 those who follow vice and misguidance suffer ahellish torment in this world too, while through the manifestations of belief, the believers and righteous may taste through the stomachs of Islam and humanity the  652 THE RAYS pleasures of Paradise. They may beneﬁt according to the degree of their belief. But in these stormy times, currents which numb the senses and scatter people’s attention on peripheral matters, plunging them into them, have deadened their senses and bewildered them. As a result of this the people of misguidance are temporarily unable to feel their torment, while the people of guidance are overwhelmed by heedlessness and cannot truly appreciate its pleasures. T h e  S e c o n d  A w e s o m e  C o n d i t i o n  T h i s  A g e : In former times, compared with the present there was very little absolute disbelief, or misguidance arising from science, or the disbelief arising from perverse obstinacy. The instruction of the Islamic scholars of those times and their arguments were therefore sufﬁcient, quickly dispelling any unbelief arising from doubts. Belief in Allah was general, and they could persuade most people to give up their misguidance and wrongdoing through teaching them about Allah and reminding them of Hell-ﬁre. But now there are a hundred absolute disbeliev ers in one small town instead of perhaps one in a whole country. Those who lose their way due to science and learning and obstinately oppose the truths of belief have increased a hundredfold in relation to former times. With pride like that of the Pharaoh and their terrible misguidance these obdurate deniers oppose the truths of belief. A sacred truth is therefore much needed that will completely destroy the bases of their disbelief in this world, like an atom bomb, and will halt their aggression and bring some of them to belief. All praise be to Almighty Allah that with its many comparisons, as the perfect remedy for the wounds of this time, the R i s a l e - i  N u r -a miracle of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition proceeding from its effulgence- has routed even the worst of those obdurate deniers with the diamond sword of the Qur’an. Its proofs and arguments to the number of the atoms of the universe demonstrating divine unity and the truths of belief show that in twenty-ﬁve years it has not been defeated in the face of

Say in manly fashion: “ O Most Patient One! ” and shoulder the three sorts of patience. If you do not squander on the wrong way the forces of patience Almighty Allah has given you, they should be enough to withstand every difﬁculty and disaster. So hold out with those forces! Fourth Warning FOURTH WARNING O my foolish soul! Is this duty of worship without result and is its recom pense little that it causes you weariness? Whereas if someone were to give you a little money or to intimidate you, he could make you work till evening, and you would work without slacking. So is it that the prescribed prayers are without result, which in this guesthouse of the world are sustenance and wealth for your impotent and weak heart, and in your grave, which will be a certain dwelling-place for you, sustenance and light, and at the resurrec tion, when you will anyway be judged, a document and patent, and on the Bridge of Sirat, over which you are bound to pass, a light and a mount? Are their recompense little? Someone promises you a present worth a hundred liras and makes you work for a hundred days. You trust the man who may go back on his word and work without slacking. So if One for Whom the breaking of a promise is impossible, promises you recompense like Paradise and a gift like eternal happiness, and employs you for a very short time in a very agreeable duty, if you do not perform that service or you act accus ingly towards His promise or slight His gift by performing it unwillingly like someone forced to work, or by being bored, or by working in half-hearted fashion, you will deserve a severe reprimand and awesome punishment. Have you not thought of this? Although you serve without ﬂagging in the heaviest work in this world out of fear of imprisonment, does the fear of an  308 THE WORDS eternal incarceration like Hell not ﬁll you with enthusiasm for a truly light and agreeable act of service?

But if you heed truth and the Qur’an, you will rise to the highest of the high and become the Most Excellent Pattern of the universe. Fifth Remark FIFTH REMARK Man has been sent to this world as an ofﬁcial and guest, and has been given abilities of great signiﬁcance. And he has been entrusted with impor tant duties in accordance with those abilities. In order to employ man in  fulﬁlling those aims and duties, powerful encouragement and severe threats have been made. We shall here summarize the fundamentals of worship and of man’s duties, which we have explained at length elsewhere, so that the mystery of ‘the Most Excellent of Patterns’ may be understood. On coming into the universe man has two aspects related to worship and being a slave of Allah. One is worship and contemplation in the absence of the Object of Worship. The other is worship and supplication in His pres ence and addressing Him directly. First Aspect: It is to afﬁrm submissively the sovereignty of dominicality apparent in the universe and to observe its perfections and virtues in wonder. Then it is to proclaim and herald the unique arts which consist of the inscriptions of the sacred divine names and to display them as an example to others. Then it is to weigh on the scales of perception the jewels of the dominical names, which are all like hidden treasures; it is to appreciatively afﬁrm their v

Your place is very constricted, but the expansiveness of your hearts does not allow this to distress you; it is also relatively freer than where I am. Know that solidarity is our ﬁrmest strength and support. Beware! Do not let the irritability caused by these tribulations make you ﬁnd fault with one another. Complaining and blaming each other and saying “ If such-and-such had not happened it would not have been like this ” is the equivalent of com plaining about fate and divine determining; do not do this. I have realized that there was no way we could have been saved from their assaults, what ever we did they would have attacked us. For the short time till divine grace comes to our assistance, we must respond with patience and thanks, and resignation towards the divine decree and submission to divine determining, and try to gain plentiful reward and merit with few acts. I pray for the well-being of our brothers there. S a i d  N u r s i My Dear, Loyal Brothers! A signiﬁcant solace in the face of the swift changes of this worldly life and its decline, and its ﬂeeting, fruitless pleasures, and its blows of separa tion, is meeting with true friends. Yes, sometimes one travels for twenty days and spends a hundred liras to see a single friend for an hour or two. So now in these strange, friendless times, our seeing forty to ﬁfty friends all together for one or two months and our speaking together for Allah’s sake and receiving and giving true consolation, make these difﬁculties and ﬁnan cial losses that have befallen us extremely cheap and unimportant. I myself would have accepted this hardship to see only one of my brothers here after having been parted from them for ten years. Complaint is criticism of divine determining, while thanks is submission to it. I assure you that if the appointed hour were to come now and I were to die, I would meet it with perfect ease of heart. For I know that among you are many strong, steadfast young Saids who will own, inherit, and protect the R i s a l e - i  N u r far more effectively than this wretched, elderly, ill and debili tated Said. I felt very grateful and happy at those whose names are written in Nazif’s note, who effectively strengthen morale.

I am not free and independent; I am a traveller charged with duties. One day I too will be old and weak. ” He suddenly starts to feel a sympathy and respect for those he wanted to cruelly assault. This too is explained with proofs in the R i s a l e - i N u r , so deeming that sufﬁcient, we here cut it short. Another important section of humankind are the sick, the oppressed, the disaster-stricken like us, the poor and the life prisoners; if belief in the hereafter does not come to their aid, death, of which they are continu ously reminded by illness, unavenged wrongs, the arrogant treachery of the oppressor, from whom they cannot save their honour, the terrible despair of having lost their property or children in serious disasters, the distress at hav ing to suffer the torments of prison for ﬁve or ten years because of a minute or two, or an hour or two, of pleasure – these surely make the world into a prison for such unfortunates, and life into agonizing torment. But if belief in the hereafter comes to their assistance, they suddenly breathe freely, and according to the degree of their belief, their distress, despair, anxiety, anger, and desire for vengeance abate, sometimes partially, sometimes entirely. I can even say that if belief in the hereafter had not helped me and some of my brothers in this fearsome calamity of our being imprisoned for no reason, to stand it for one day would have been as grievous as death and driven us to resign from life. But endless thanks be to Allah, despite suffer ing the distress of my brothers, whom I love as much as my life, as well as my own, in addition to the weeping and sorrow of thousands of copies of the R i s a l e - i  N u r and my gilded, decorated, valuable books, which I love as much as my eyes, and although I could never stand the slightest insult or to  252 THE RAYS be dominated, I swear that the light and strength of belief in the hereafter afforded me the patience, endurance, solace, and steadfastness; indeed, it ﬁlled me with enthusiasm to gain greater reward in the proﬁtable, instructive exertions of this ordeal, for as I said at the begin

My state of mind at that time prompted me to write a supplication in Persian. It was  printed in Ankara, in a treatise entitled, H u b a b . 298 THE FLASHES together, was being trampled underfoot. That was no remedy, it only added further pain to my affliction. Then I was forced to look behind me. I saw that this unstable, transient world was tumbling, disappearing, into the valleys of nothingness and the darkness of non-existence. I was seeking a salve for my pain, but it only added poison. Since I could see no good in that direction I looked in front of me, I sent my view forward to the future. I saw that the door of the grave was open right in the middle of my path; it was watching me with its mouth agape. The highway beyond it which stretched away to eternity, and the convoys travelling that highway, struck the eye from the distance. But apart from a limited will as my support and defensive weapon in the face of the horrors coming from these six directions, I had nothing. The faculty of will, man’s only weapon against those innumerable ene mies and endless harmful things, is both defective, and short, and weak, and lacks the power to create, so he is capable of nothing apart from ‘acquisi tion.’ It could neither pass to the past in order to silence the sorrows which came to me from there, nor could it penetrate the future to prevent the fears which arose from there. I saw that it was of no benefit for my hopes and pains concerning the past and future.  As I was struggling in the horror, desolation, darkness and despair pro ceeding from these six directions, the lights of belief which shine in the sky of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition suddenly came to my assistance. They lit up and illuminated those six directions to such a degree that if the terrors and darkness I had seen increased a hundredfold, the light would still have been sufficient to meet them. One by one it transformed all those hor rors into solace and the desolation into familiarity. It was as follows: Belief rent asunder the desolate view of the past as a vast grave, and showed it with utter certainty to b

For they are able to say: “ Since we are not citizens, you are not our government! ” Furthermore, no government can inﬂict two penalties at the same time. It either imprisons a murderer, or it executes him. To punish by both imprison ment and capital punishment is a principle nowhere! However, despite the fact that I have caused no harm whatsoever to this country and nation, for eight years you have held me in captivity in a way not inﬂicted on even a criminal belonging to the wildest and most foreign nation. Although you have pardoned criminals, you have negated my free dom and deprived me of all civil rights.

Since in the Great War you have counted as nothing all the heroic deeds to which this person was the means and were testiﬁed to by the army’s commanders, and considered his self-sacrﬁcing struggles for the sake of this country to be crimes; and since you deemed his preserving the good morality of this unfor tunate nation and his serious and effective work to secure its happiness in this world and the next to be treason; and since you have punished for eight years ( and now the punishment has been for twenty-eight years ) someone who does not for himself accept your injurious, dangerous, arbitrary princi ples, which in reality are without beneﬁt and spring from unbelief and from Europe; the punishment is the same.

This is the point of assistance.  It is also knowledge of the Maker which is the only point of support against the calamities and troubles of the tumultuous world in which life – the ﬁeld of conﬂict and struggle – is constantly under attack.  Yes, if a person does not believe in the All-Wise Maker and His works, all of which are in accordance with wisdom and order, and blindly ascribes them to chance, and if he thinks of the total insufﬁciency of his power in the face of disaster, he will become more wretched than anything due to the resulting hellish, piteous state comprising terror, desolation, anxiety, and fear, and he will oppose the perfect order and regularity of the universe. This is the point of support; yes, his only refuge is knowledge of the Maker.  This means that since, to be dominant in the world’s order through these two points is the exclusive quality of the truth itself, from them the Maker’s existence is manifested in the conscience, for they are two windows. Even if the intellect does not see this, man’s essential nature does. The conscience is the observer and the heart, its window.  Note There are four methods by which to ascend to knowledge of the Maker,  the throne of attainment and perfections:  T h e  F i r s t is the way of the Suﬁ mystic-scholars, which is based on puri ﬁcation and illumination. T h e  S e c o n d  is the way of the scholars of the science of k a l ā m , which is based on contingency and createdness.

T h e  F i f t h  C a l a m i t y : One of things that taking the hands of those unfor tunates who go to one extreme or the other and cast them into darkness, is their seeking literal truth in every part of ﬁgurative speech. For sure a seed of truth has to be found in all ﬁgurative speech from which the ﬁgures may sprout and grow. Alternatively, truth is a light-giving wick, while ﬁgurative speech is the lamp’s glass, increasing the light. Yes, love is in the heart, and the intellect in the brain; it’s futile to search for them in the hand or foot.  S i x t h C a l a m i t y : What screens the sight and conceals eloquence is restrict ing the view to literal meanings. This means that however much the truth is perceived by the intellect, so ﬁgures cannot be aggressed against. If they are, the meanings are hidden. It is due to this that the beauty and eloquence of the Qur’an’s verses and of Hadiths cannot be shown through exegesis or translations. It is as though the literalists consider the associated meaning of the ﬁgure to be opposed to what is reasonably true. But such meanings may be either mental, or emotional, or customary, or contextual, or any of a lot of other things. If you wish, enter the two hundred and twenty-ﬁrst door of D a l ā ’ i l  a l - I ‘ j ā z , a garden of Paradise, and you’ll see how the mighty ‘Abd al-Qāhir 1 angrily drew such unfortunates to him and rebuked and scolded them.

Third Aspect THIRD ASPECT It is this: there are certain hidden connections between things. There are even the threads of connections between things you least expect. They are either there in fact, or your imagination made them according to the art with  TWENTY-FIRST WORD – SECOND STATION 313 which it was preoccupied and tied them together. It is due to this mystery of connections that sometimes seeing a sacred thing calls to mind a dirty thing. As stated in the science of ﬁgurative speech, “ Although opposition is the cause of distance in the outer world, it is the cause of proximity in the imagination. ” That is, an imaginary connection is the means of bringing together the images of two opposites. The recollection which arises from this connection is called the association of ideas.  For example, while performing the prayers or reciting supplications before the Ka‘ba in the divine presence, this association of ideas takes hold of you and drives you to the furthest, lowest trivia, although you are reﬂect ing on Qur’anic verses. If your head is afﬂicted with an association of ideas in this way, beware, do not be alarmed. Rather, the moment you come to your senses, turn back. Do not say: “ I’ve done a great wrong ” and keep playing with the trigger, lest through your attention, that tenuous connection strengthens. For the more you feel regret, the more importance you give it and that faint memory of yours becomes ingrained. It becomes an imaginary sickness. Do not be frightened, it is not a sickness of the heart. This sort of recollection is mostly involuntary. Especially in sensitive, nervous people it is more common. Satan works the mine of this sort of scruple a great deal. The cure for this wound is as follows:  The association of ideas is mostly involuntary. One is not answerable for it.

For they have shaken human society by making labour contest capital and causing the poor to clash with the rich by founding banks through usury and compound interest, and amassing wealth through wiles and fraud. Moreover, it was again that nation who, in order to take their revenge on the victors and governments under which they had suffered dep rivation and oppression, were involved in every sort of corrupting covert organization and had a ﬁnger in every sort of revolution. And, for example: ( 2:94 ) . That is, “ If what you say is true, seek death, but you won’t seek it! ” Thus, regarding a minor incident in a small gathering in the presence of the Prophet  454 THE WORDS ( UWBP ), it points out that the Jewish nation, which is famous among the nations of mankind for its greed for life and fear of death, will not, accord ing to its tongue of disposition, seek death till Doomsday and will not give up its greed for life. And, for example: ( 2:61 ) ¸ ¶ μ ´ With this, it describes generally that nation’s future destiny. It is because of these fearsome rules governing the destiny and character of this nation that the Qur’an acts so severely against them. It deals them awesomely punish ing blows.

From this point of  446 THE FLASHES view, in regard to creation and dominicality, life makes the universe into an indivisible whole, a universal whose being broken into parts and in which others can share is outside the bounds of possibility. Yes, the stamp on your face shows self-evidently that the One who cre ates you is the One who creates all humankind. For the nature of man’s creation is the same; it cannot be split up. Also, by means of life the parts of the universe are like the individual members of mankind, and the uni verse, like the species. It shows the seal of divine oneness and stamp of eter nal besoughtedness on every individual, the same as it shows them on the whole, thus in every way repulsing the associating of partners with Allah. Also, there are such extraordinarily wondrous miracles of dominical art in life that one, a power, that cannot create the whole universe cannot create the tiniest animate creature. Yes, a pen that inscribes in a tiny seed the index of the huge pine tree, and the programme of its life, like writing the whole Qur’an in a chickpea, can surely be none other than the pen that writes the heavens together with the stars. And the one who places in the tiny head of a bee the ability and faculties to know the flowers in the garden of the uni verse, be connected with most of its realms, convey a gift of divine mercy like honey, and know on the day it comes into the world the conditions of life, can surely be none other than the Creator of the entire universe. I n  S h o r t : Life is a shining seal of divine unity on the face of the universe; and in respect of life all beings with spirits are stamps of divine oneness; and the embroideries and art in every living being form a seal of eternal besoughtedness; and living creatures set their signatures with their lives on the missive of the universe in the name of the Ever-Living and Self-Sub sistent One to their number, and are seals of divine unity, stamps of divine oneness, and signets of divine eternal besoughtedness. Similarly, just as all living beings are seals of divine unity in this book of the universe, like life; so a seal of divine oneness has been placed of the faces and features of each. Furtherm

If I had resorted to trickery this last ﬁve years, I would have made application to you in sycophantic manner. A wily man tries to ingratiate himself. He does not hold back; he always tries to deceive and hoodwink. Whereas I have not condescended to respond to the severest attacks and criticisms levelled at me. Saying, “ I place my trust in Allah, ” I turned my back on the worldly. Moreover, if he is sensible, a person who discovers the reality of this world and knows the hereafter, is not sorry; he does not turn back to the world and struggle with it again. After the age of ﬁfty, a person who has no connection with anything and is alone, will not sacriﬁce eternal life for one or two years of the chatter and deception of this world. If he does, he is not cunning but foolish and crazy. What can a crazy lunatic do so that anyone should bother with him? As for suspecting me of outwardly abandoning the world while inwardly seeking it, in accordance with the verse, ( 12:53 ) ) ( ' & % $ # " I do not exonerate my soul, for it wants everything bad.

Similarly, the one hundred and twenty-four million saints who conﬁrm the reports of the prophets through unveiling and witnessing, give testimony to the existence of the hereafter in the form of certain knowledge.  And all the names of the cosmos’ All-Wise Maker also necessitate the existence of an eternal realm through the manifestations they display in this world. The existence of the hereafter is furthermore necessitated by the inﬁ nite pre-eternal power, the unlimited and exact everlasting wisdom, that revives every spring the countless dead trees scattered all over the earth with the command of ² ± , thus making of them manifestations of ِتْو َ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)ا َدْ(cid:151)َ(cid:92) ُثْ(cid:151)َ(cid:92) and that resurrects three hundred thousand different species of the various groups of plant and nations of animals, as hundreds of thou sands of specimens of the supreme resurrection. The existence of the hereafter is also necessitated by the everlasting mercy and permanent grace that sustains in wondrous and solicitous fash ion all animate beings that stand in need of nurture, and that display each spring, in the briefest of periods, inﬁnite different varieties of adornment and beauty.

So it was with astonish ment and bewilderment that I saw the pseudo-scholarly objections in the indictment. Even if I had made some errors and the indictment was correct in what it imputed, although thousands of scholars had not spotted them or objected to them, they still would not constitute a crime; they would only be scholarly errors. Moreover, three courts have acquitted the entire R i s a l e - i  N u r and ourselves. Only Eskişehir Court gave light sentences to myself and ﬁfteen out of a hundred of my companions because of ﬁfteen words in the Twenty-Fourth Flash, which is about the veiling of women. I wrote in the addendum to my objections that if there is justice on the face of the earth, it would not accept my being convicted for expounding that verse and comply ing with what was laid down in three hundred and ﬁfty thousand Qur’anic commentaries. As though collecting water from a thousand streams and in its cleverness, the prosecution tried to use against us a number of points in books and letters written over twenty years. That makes the, not three, but ﬁve or six courts which acquitted us on this point our accomplices in this imaginary crime. I am reminding the prosecution not to insult the honour of those just courts. T h e  T h i r d : Even if explicitly, to criticize and object to a leader who is dead and gone, whose relations with the government have ceased, and who was the cause of certain faults in the reforms, cannot be a legal offence. But there was not anything explicit; the prosecution applied my general state ments to him through its misrepresentations. It publicized those conﬁdential meanings, which we do not tell to everyone, and drew everyone’s attention to them. If there is any crime involved, the prosecution is guilty. Because it is inciting the people, and attracting their attention to those meanings.

 deviated a little. On the page now open before me, the word “ m a ḥ b ū b ” ( beloved ) is repeated twice; one on the third line and one on the ﬁfteenth; they look to each other in perfectly balanced fashion. Between them, four instances of the word “ a ş k ” ( love ) have been arranged look ing to each other. Other coincidences from the Unseen may be compared to these. Whoever the scribe, and whatever form their lines and pages take, these coincidences are bound to occur to such an extent that it cannot be doubted that they are neither the work of chance nor the creation of the author and scribes. However, they are more striking when written by some of them. This means there is a handwriting that ﬁts these treatises. Some of the scribes approach it. It is strange, it appears most not with the most skilful of them but with the most inexperienced. It is understood from this that the art, grace, and virtues of the Wo r d s , which are a sort of commentary on the Qur’an, are not anybody’s; the garments of the harmonious, well-ordered style, which ﬁt the blessed stature of the orderly, beautiful Qur’anic truths, are not measured and cut out voluntarily and consciousnessly by anyone. It is that their stature requires them to be thus; it is an unseen hand that meas ures them and cuts them according to the stature, and clothes it in them. As for myself ( lit. us ), I am an interpreter among them, a servant. Fourth Point FOURTH POINT In your ﬁrst question, you ask ﬁve or six questions: “ What will the Great Gathering and Last Judgement be like? Will everyone be naked? How shall we ﬁnd our friends there, and how shall we ﬁnd Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) in order to avail ourselves of his inter cession? How will innumerable people meet with a single person? What will the garments of the people of Paradise and those of Hell be like?

Since the All-Glorious Maker’s pre-eternal wisdom and providence neces sitate these truths, they require the puriﬁcation of those opposites in order to deliver the world from the turmoil of change and transience, transformation and extinction, and to separate out the causes of change and the matters of conﬂict.

I even told my respected brothers in prison: if those who have sought my execution because of the heavy blows of the R i s a l e - i  N u r , which was sent to Ankara, save their belief through the R i s a l e - i  N u r  and are delivered from eternal annihilation, you bear witness that I forgive them with all my life and soul! I told those who were pestering me with their surveillance in Denizli after our acquittal, and the high-ranking ofﬁcials and police chief and inspectors: It is an undeniable wonder of the R i s a l e - i  N u r that in nine months of close investigations no document has been found or connection of any kind with any movement, association, or society here or abroad, in the twenty years of my life of oppression, or in the hundreds of my treatises and letters, or among my thousands of students. Could this extraordinary situation have been achieved by the power of thought or through some arrangement? If the private concerns of one person over a number of years are brought to light, certainly there would be twenty matters to embarass or convict him.  1.

Metin:
 excites a pathetic sorrow arising from the lack  of friends, from being ownerless; not an elevated sorrow. For it is a woebegone sadness inspired by deaf nature and blind force. It  shows the world as desolate, not in any other way. It depicts it in this way, holds the sorrowing man there, places him ownerless  among strangers, leaving him without hope. Due to this feeling of consternation it has given him, he gradually sinks into misguidance; it opens up the way to atheism, from whence it is difﬁcult to return. Perhaps he never will return. Qur’anic literature produces a sorrow, but it is the sorrow of love, not of orphans. It arises from separation from friends, not from the lack of them. Its view of the universe, in place of blind nature, is as conscious, merciful  divine art; it does not speak of nature. Instead of blind force, it describes wise and purposeful divine power. The universe, therefore, does not take on the form of a desolate wasteland. Indeed, in the view of the grieving one it addresses, it becomes a gathering of friends. On every side mutual love and response, which cause no distress. The friendliness at every corner draws the melancholy person into society, giving him a yearning sorrow, an elevated feeling; not a dejected mournfulness. Both give rise to eagerness. But through the eagerness provoked by the foreign literature, the soul becomes excited, the desires are stimulated; its gives no joy to the spirit. The Qur’an’s eagerness, however, ﬁres the spirit, gives rise to a lofty eagerness. It is for this reason that the Shari‘a of Muhammad ( UWBP ) wants no amusements or diversion. GLEAMS 833 It has forbidden some musical instruments, for amusement, and permitted others. That is to say, instruments producing Qur’anic sorrow or revelational  eagerness are not harmful. But if it produces the woebegone grief of the orphan or carnal thrills, the instrument is prohibited. It changes from person to person, not everyone is the same. * * * Branches Offer Fruits in the Name of Mercy On every side the branches of the tree of creation apparently extend the  fruits of bounties to the hands of beings with spirits. But in reality it is a hand of mercy, a hand of power, which holds out to us  those branches and fruits. You should kiss that hand of merc
