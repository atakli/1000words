 solidarity, and the community is strengthened. GLEAMS 805 Its service takes the form of guidance and direction instead of lust and passion. And the mark of guidance is progress and prosperity in a way beﬁtting humanity; The spirit is illumined and perfected in the way it requires. The way it uniﬁes  the masses repulses racialism and negative nationalism; It establishes in place of them the bonds of religion, patriotic relations, ties  of class, and the brotherhood of belief.  The mark of these bonds are sincere brotherhood, general well-being; defence in case of external aggression. You have understood now the reason Islam was affronted, and did not embrace civilization. Up to the present, Muslims have not entered this present civilization voluntarily, it has not suited them, moreover it has clamped on them fetters of bondage. While it should be the cure for mankind, it has become poison. It has cast eighty per cent into penury and misery, and produced a false happiness for ten per cent. The remaining ten per cent it has left uneasily between the two. Commercial proﬁts have been the tyrannical minority’s. But true happiness is happiness for all; Or at least salvation for the majority. The Qur’an, revealed as a mercy for  mankind, only accepts civilization of this kind, Happiness for all, or at least for the majority. In its present form the passions  are unrestricted, caprice too is free; it is an animal freedom. The passions dominate, caprice too is despotic; they have made inessential  needs essential, and banished comfort and ease. In primitive life, a man was in need of four things, civilization has put him  in need of a hundred and has impoverished him.  Lawful labours are insufﬁcient to meet the cost. This has driven mankind to trickery and the unlawful. It is on this point that it corrupted morality. It bestowed wealth and glitter on society and mankind, but made the individual immoral and indigent. There are numerous witnesses to this. This malignant civilization vomited all at once the combined savagery and crimes, all the cruelty and treachery, of former centuries, and its stomach is still queasy. 1 The Islamic world’s holding back from it is both meaningful and noteworthy.  It has been loath to accept it, and has acted coldly.  1. This means it wi

 freedom in accordance  with the Shari‘a. ” I told them: Mr. Prosecutor and Members of the Court! You are accus ing me of holding an idea opposite to that which I have held for ﬁfty years. If you ask me about the secular republic, what I understand by it is that secular ( laic ) means to be impartial; that is, a government which, in accord ance with the principle of freedom of conscience, does not interfere with the religiously- minded and pious, the same as it does not interfere with the irreligious and dissipated. I withdrew from political and social life twenty ﬁve years ago, and what form the government of the republic has taken, I do not know. If, I seek refuge with Allah, it has assumed a fearsome form whereby, on account of irreligion, it passes and accepts laws to incriminate those who work for their belief and lives in the hereafter, then I announce to you fearlessly and warn you that if I had a thousand lives, I would be ready to sacriﬁce all of them for belief and life in the hereafter. Do whatever you will! My last word is ( 3:173 ) Ø × Ö Õ In response to your wrongfully condemning me to capital punishment or hard labour, I say: as the R i s a l e - i  N u r has discovered and shown with absolute certainty, I am not being executed; I am being discharged and departing for the world of light and happiness. As for you, our covert enemies, wretches who oppress us on account of misguidance! Since I know you are condemned to eternal extinc tion and everlasting solitary conﬁnement, and I have seen this, I have taken my revenge on you totally, and am ready to surrender up my spirit with a perfectly easy mind! Seventh Principle: In consequence of superﬁcial investigations held in other places, Afyon Court looked on us as a political society. My reply is this: 394 THE RAYS F i r s t l y :  As is testiﬁed to by all those who have befriended me, I have read no newspaper for nineteen years, nor listened to one, nor asked about one, and for the past ten years ﬁve months have received no news except about the German defeat and the terror of communism, and I have not been curious, and have not known.

 stamp particular to the Creator of All Things, the Glorious Lord and Sustainer of the universe. Thus, if only one seal out of many dominical seals on living beings thus displays its light and makes read its signs, and you were able to see and con sider all those seals at once, would you not declare:  ِهِروُ(cid:183)ُ(cid:146) ِةَ ّد ِ(cid:131)ِ(cid:92) ى ٰ(cid:159)َ(cid:99)ْ(cid:114)ا ِنَ(cid:174) َناَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126) Fourth Flash FOURTH FLASH Look carefully at the multicoloured, multifarious beings swimming in the seas of the heavens and scattered over the face of the earth! You will see that on each are inimitable signatures of the Pre-Eternal Sun. Just as the stamps on life and seals on living beings are apparent and we saw one or two of them, so are there such signatures on the giving of life. Since comparisons bring profound meanings closer to the understanding, we shall employ one to demonstrate this truth. For example, from the planets to droplets of water, to fragments of glass and sparkling snowﬂakes, a signature is apparent from the sun’s image and reﬂection, a luminous work particular to the sun. If you do not accept the tiny suns that are visible in those innumerable things to be the manifestation of the sun’s reﬂection, you have to accept the actual existence of a true, natu ral sun in every droplet and fragment of glass facing the light and in every transparent speck before it, thus descending to the depths of lunacy. In just the same way, in regard to the giving of life from among the luminous manifestations of the Pre-Eternal Sun, such a signature is present on all living beings that supposing all causes were gathered together and  TWENTY-SECOND WORD – SECOND STATION 335 had the power to act and possessed will, they still could not imitate it. For all being miracles of divine power, living beings are points of focus of the divine names, the rays of the Pre-Eternal Sun. If that strange inscription of art, that wondrous ordering of wisdom, that manifestation of the mys tery of Oneness on living beings is not ascribed to the Single and Eternally Besought One, it necessitates accepting that concealed within each living creature, and even in a ﬂy or a ﬂower, is an inﬁnite creative power, a knowl edge encompassing all things, an absolu

 encounter places that are ready and prepared for them and know their value, they are transformed into trouble and revenge. T h e  F i f t h :  Just as, if one disregards the words, there is a correspond ence between the meanings [ of the second parable and of the story of the  146 SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS dissemblers it portrays ], which form the basis of the parabolic metaphor ( a l - i s t i ‘ ā r a  a l - t a m t h ī l i y y a ); so too there are relationships between the parts [ of both of these ]. For a cloudburst is the life of plants, as Islam is the life of spirits. The thunder and lightning indicate promise and threat, while the darknesses show you the doubts of disbelief and scepticism of dissembling. The positioning of [ and relationships between ] the verses’ phrases With the phrase = < ; : the Qur’an infers that [ the dissem blers ] resemble people forced to travel through a wild desert on a dark night in a violent rainstorm, the calamitous rain pelting down on them like bullets from the brimming sky. In this way it is alerting the listener’s mind, for he is waiting for an explanation of why the rain clouds, which are essentially much desired mercy, are such a ghastly calamity. So to illustrate their awe someness, it says: ? > suggesting that the rain contains the clouds’ darkness and denseness. Similarly, because of its abundance and being so widespread and general, it is as though with its black droplets [ the rain ] contains the fragmenting night. As soon as the listener hears ? > he expects an explanation, as though the speaker hears the sound of thunder in his brain so says: @ This suggests its menacing threats, for the skies, the commander of beings, are intent on wiping out [ the dissemblers ] and they rumble and roar at them with their thunder. In the face of this, the terriﬁed calamity-stricken [ dissemblers ] imagine that the universe, whose beings co operate and assist each other, is bent on harming them despite its tranquil lity, and despite its silence is howling at them horribly. When they hear the thunder they imagine it is uttering threats at them, for out of fear they think it is roaring at them.  Then as soon as the listener hears the thunder, its constant companion strikes his mind, and for this reason [ the Qur’an ] says: A wh

 temporary lamps. Those lamps do not smile at them with joy, they rather smirk idiotically at their pitiful and lamentable state. Those lights mock and make fun of them. In the view of your pupils, all living beings are miserable, calamity striken, and subject to the assaults of oppressors. The world is a place of uni versal mourning. Issuing from it are cries and wails at death and suffering. The pupil who has absorbed your instruction thoroughly becomes a pharaoh. But he is an abject pharaoh who worships the basest things and holds him self to be lord over everything he reckons advantageous. A student of yours is obstinate, but an obstinate wretch who accepts utter abasement for a sin gle pleasure. He is so despicable as to kiss Satan’s foot for some worthless benefit. And he is a bully. But because he has nothing in his heart on which to rely, he is an impotent bullying braggart. His whole aim and endeavour is to satisfy the lusts of his soul, to cunningly seek his own personal interests under the screen of patriotism and devotion, and work to satisfy his ambition and pride. He loves seriously nothing at all other than himself and sacrifices everything for his own sake.  As for the sincere, wholehearted student of the Qur’an, he is a wor shipping servant. But he is an esteemed servant who does not stoop to bow in worship before even the mightiest of creatures, and does not make the supreme benefit of Paradise the aim of his worship. And he is mild and gentle, but at the same time noble and gracious and lowers himself before none but the All-Glorious Creator, and only stoops before the lowly with His permission and at His command. And he is needy, but due to the reward his All-Generous Owner is storing up for him in the future,  SEVENTEENTH FLASH 167 he is at the same time self-sufficient. And he is weak, but he is strong in his weakness for he relies on the strength of his Lord whose power is infinite. Would the Qur’an make its true student take this fleeting, transient world as his aim and purpose while not making him have even eternal Paradise as his goal? Thus you can understand how the two students’ aims and endeavours differ from one another. You can further compare the zeal and self-sacrifice of the All-Wise  Qur’an’s students with the pupils of sick

 depraved animal. Like vermin who enjoy the stink of putrifying matter and snakes who take pleasure at biting and poisoning, they take pride and pleas ure at the evils and wicked immorality of the swamp of misguidance, being gratified at the harms and crimes of the darkness of evil-doing; quite simply they take on the nature of Satan. Yes, a decisive indication of the existence of devils from the jinn, is the existence of human satans. S e c o n d l y : All the hundreds of decisive evidences proving the existence of angels and spirit beings in the Twenty-Ninth Word prove also the exist ence of evil spirits. We refer this aspect to that Word. T h i r d l y : The existence of the angels, the representatives and supervisors of the laws of the good matters in the universe, is established and agreed upon by all the religions. So too, the existence of evil and satanic spirits, who are the representatives and ushers of evil matters and the means of the laws of such matters, is required by wisdom and reality, and is certain. Indeed, in evil matters, a conscious screen is more necessary. For as is stated at the beginning of the Twenty-Second Word, since everyone cannot see the true good of everything, the All-Glorious Creator has made apparent inter mediaries a screen to apparent evils and defects, so that objections should not be levelled at Him, nor His mercy be accused, nor his wisdom criti cized or unjustly complained about, and so that objections, criticisms, and complaints should be directed at the screen, and not turned to the Generous Creator, the Absolutely Wise One. Just as He made illness a screen to the  THIRTEENTH FLASH  121 appointed hour of death in order to save Azra’il from the complaints 1 of His servants who die, so too He made Azra’il a screen to the seizing of the spirits of the dying so that the complaints at that situation, which is fancied to be lacking in compassion, should not be directed at Almighty Allah. And even more certainly, dominical wisdom demanded the existence of Satan, so that objections and criticisms in the face of evils and bad things should not be directed at the All-Glorious Creator.
