 dissemblers and disbelievers would attack the R i s a l e - i  N u r , but they would be the losers. For the R i s a l e - i  N u r is a cause of calamities like earthquake and war abating. It may be a concealed sign that its ceasing from activity attracts disaster. S a i d  N u r s i * * * My Dear Brothers! It is my guess that our ﬁnal and true defence will be the short treatise that is the fruit of Denizli Prison. For the extensive plots hatched against us over the past year, originally due to unfounded suspicions, are the following: they attacked us on baseless pretexts such as founding a Suﬁ order, establishing a secret society, being a tool of external forces, exploiting religious feelings for political ends, working against the republic, meddling in government and breaching public security. Thanks be to Almighty Allah, their plans failed. Other than the truths of belief and the Qur’an, study of the hereafter, and working for everlasting bliss, they found nothing, even over such an exten sive area, among hundreds of students, in hundreds of treatises, in the letters and books written over a period of eighteen years. They began to seek out anything at all to make a pretext of, in order to conceal their plots. But I think that in the face of a fearsome, covert atheistic organization which has deceived some leaders of the government, turning them against us, possibly attacking us directly on behalf of absolute disbelief, we were made to write the treatise of T h e  F r u i t s  o f  B e l i e f , which is as clear as the sun and dispels all doubts and is as ﬁrm and unshakeable as a mountain, as the most powerful defence against them and to silence them. S a i d  N u r s i * * * THE THIRTEENTH RAY 341 My Brothers! Your place is very constricted, but the expansiveness of your hearts does not allow this to distress you; it is also relatively freer than where I am. Know that solidarity is our ﬁrmest strength and support. Beware! Do not let the irritability caused by these tribulations make you ﬁnd fault with one another. Complaining and blaming each other and saying “ If such-and-such had not happened it would not have been like this ” is the equivalent of com plaining about fate and divine determining; do not do this. I have realized that there was no way we

 consolation, I again had recourse to the verse “ F o r  u s A l l a h  s u f f i c e s . ” It told me: “ Recite me and consider my meaning carefully! ” So I entered the observatory of the verse in Sura al-Nur,  ( 24:35 ) | { z y and looked through the telescope of belief to the most distant levels of the verse “ F o r  u s  A l l a h  s u f f i c e s , ” then through the microscope of the insight of belief at its most subtle mysteries, and saw the following: Mirrors, pieces of glass, transparent things, and even bubbles, show the various hidden beauties of the sun’s light and of the seven colours in its light; and through their motion and renewal, and different capacities and refrac tion, they renew that beauty; and through their refracting, they display the hidden beauties and loveliness of the sun and its light. In exactly the same way, in order to act as mirrors to the sacred beauty of the All-Beauteous One of Glory, the Pre-Eternal and Post-Eternal Sun, and to the everlasting loveli ness of His most beautiful names, and to renew their manifestations, these beautiful creatures, these lovely artefacts, these exquisite beings, arrive and depart without stopping. Powerful proofs are expounded in detail in the R i s a l e - i  N u r that demonstrate that the beauties apparent on them belong not to them, but are signs, indications, flashes, and manifestations of a per petually manifesting, eternal, holy beauty which desires to appear, a tran scendent, sacred loveliness which wants to be seen. The explanation begins by saying that three of those proofs have been mentioned briefly and most  TWENTY-SIXTH FLASH 331 reasonably. The treatise leaves in amazement everyone of fine perception who sees it so that in addition to benefiting from it themselves, they find it necessary to try to allow others to benefit from it. Anyone whose mind is not rotten and heart not corrupted will appreciate, admire, and recommend the five points explained in the second proof, and exclaiming: “ M a ’s h a l l a h !  B a r a k a l l a h ! ” will perceive and affirm that it is a wondrous marvel which will exalt his apparently lowly, wanting being.

 immortal youth; a shining, endless life awaits you. You will be joy fully reunited with the children and relatives you have lost. All your good deeds have been preserved and you will receive your reward. ” It affords  THE FRUITS OF BELIEF – EIGHTH TOPIC 251 them such solace and joy that were they to experience old age a hundred times over all at the same time, it would not cause them despair. One third of humankind is formed by the youth. With their turbulent emotions, the youths are not always able to control their bold intelligences and are overcome by their passions. If then they lose their faith in the here after and do not recall the torments of Hell, it puts in danger the property and honour of the upright people in society and the peace and self-respect of the weak and elderly. One youth may destroy the happiness of a contented home for one minute’s pleasure, then pay the penalty in prison for four or ﬁve years, degenerating into a wild animal. If belief in the hereafter comes to his assistance and he swiftly comes to his senses, saying: “ It’s true the government informers can’t see me and I can hide from them, but the angels of a Glorious Monarch Who has a prison like Hell see me and are recording all my evil deeds. I am not free and independent; I am a traveller charged with duties. One day I too will be old and weak. ” He suddenly starts to feel a sympathy and respect for those he wanted to cruelly assault. This too is explained with proofs in the R i s a l e - i N u r , so deeming that sufﬁcient, we here cut it short. Another important section of humankind are the sick, the oppressed, the disaster-stricken like us, the poor and the life prisoners; if belief in the hereafter does not come to their aid, death, of which they are continu ously reminded by illness, unavenged wrongs, the arrogant treachery of the oppressor, from whom they cannot save their honour, the terrible despair of having lost their property or children in serious disasters, the distress at hav ing to suffer the torments of prison for ﬁve or ten years because of a minute or two, or an hour or two, of pleasure – these surely make the world into a prison for such unfortunates, and life into agonizing torment. But if belief in the hereafter comes to their assistance, they suddenly b

 astonish ment and bewilderment that I saw the pseudo-scholarly objections in the indictment. Even if I had made some errors and the indictment was correct in what it imputed, although thousands of scholars had not spotted them or objected to them, they still would not constitute a crime; they would only be scholarly errors. Moreover, three courts have acquitted the entire R i s a l e - i  N u r and ourselves. Only Eskişehir Court gave light sentences to myself and ﬁfteen out of a hundred of my companions because of ﬁfteen words in the Twenty-Fourth Flash, which is about the veiling of women. I wrote in the addendum to my objections that if there is justice on the face of the earth, it would not accept my being convicted for expounding that verse and comply ing with what was laid down in three hundred and ﬁfty thousand Qur’anic commentaries. As though collecting water from a thousand streams and in its cleverness, the prosecution tried to use against us a number of points in books and letters written over twenty years. That makes the, not three, but ﬁve or six courts which acquitted us on this point our accomplices in this imaginary crime. I am reminding the prosecution not to insult the honour of those just courts. T h e  T h i r d : Even if explicitly, to criticize and object to a leader who is dead and gone, whose relations with the government have ceased, and who was the cause of certain faults in the reforms, cannot be a legal offence. But there was not anything explicit; the prosecution applied my general state ments to him through its misrepresentations. It publicized those conﬁdential meanings, which we do not tell to everyone, and drew everyone’s attention to them. If there is any crime involved, the prosecution is guilty. Because it is inciting the people, and attracting their attention to those meanings. T h e  F o u r t h :  Due to baseless suspicions, repeating the same old story, collecting water from a thousand streams, the prosecution investigated hints of a secret society, despite our unequivocal acquittal on this point by three courts. However, while there are numerous political societies which are harmful for this nation and country, which they permit and look on tolerantly,  THE FOURTEENTH RAY  421 to call a secret society the solidarity o

 annihilated and from aimlessness, afforded a profound joy. Then the angels who record human actions came to mind; I saw that they yielded numerous sweet fruits like the previous one. Another: Everyone tries earnestly to preserve through writing, poetry, or even the cinema, a worthwhile saying or deed, in order to immortalize it. Particularly if the deeds produce everlasting fruits in Paradise, they are even more anxious to preserve them. The recording angels hovering over people’s shoulders so that they may show their deeds in eternal vistas and continually gain their performers reward, seemed so agreeable to me, I can not describe it. Then, when the worldly had isolated me from all aspects of social life and kept me from all my books, friends, assistants, and the things that con sole me, and I was being crushed by the desolation of exile and my empty world was tumbling down all around me, one of the many fruits of belief in  283 284 THE RAYS the angels came to my assistance. It cheered up the universe and my world, ﬁlling it with angels and spirit beings, and making my world laugh for joy. 1 It showed too that the worlds of the people of misguidance weep in desola tion, emptiness, and darkness. While enjoying the pleasures of this fruit, my imagination plucked one of the numerous fruits of belief in the prophets, which resembles it, and tasted it. Then suddenly my belief that all the proph ets of the past were as though living, and my assent to them, lit up those times and made my belief universal and expanded it, and set thousands of signatures to their teachings concerning belief in the Prophet of the End of Time ( UWBP ), silencing the Satans. Then, a question occurred to me the decisive answer to which is included in the Thirteenth Flash, about the wisdom in seeking refuge with Allah from Satan. In meaning it asked me: “ The people of guidance are assisted and strengthened by innumerable sweet fruits and beneﬁts like these, the ﬁne results of good deeds, and the Most Merciful of the Merciful’s compas sionate succour and assistance, so why are they frequently defeated by the people of misguidance, and sometimes twenty or a hundred of them are routed? ” While pondering over this, I recalled the mobilizations and angels in the Qur’an in the face of Satan’s
