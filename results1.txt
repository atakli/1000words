Metin:
A day will come when this assembly of examination is closed and the
period of trial is finished, and the divine names have carried out their decree,
and the pen of divine determining has completed writing its missives, and
divine power completed the embroideries of its art, and beings have fulfilled
their duties, and creatures accomplished their acts of service, and everything
has stated its meaning, and this world produced the seedlings of the hereaf-
ter, and the earth has displayed and exhibited all the miracles of power of the All-Powerful Maker and all the wonders of His art, and this transient world has attached to the string of time the tableaux forming the panoramas of eternity. For the eternal wisdom and pre-eternal providence of the All-Glorious Maker necessitate such truths as the results of the examination and trial, the truths of those divine names’ manifestations, the truths of the missives of the pen of divine determining, the originals of those sample-like embroi deries of art, the aims and beneﬁts of the duties of beings, the wages of the acts of service of creatures, the truths of the meanings that the book of the universe’s words stated, the sprouting of the seeds of innate disposition, the opening of a supreme court of judgement, the displaying of the sample-like panoramas taken from this world, the rending of the veil of apparent causes, and the surrendering of everything directly to the All-Glorious Creator. Since the All-Glorious Maker’s pre-eternal wisdom and providence neces sitate these truths, they require the puriﬁcation of those opposites in order to deliver the world from the turmoil of change and transience, transformation and extinction, and to separate out the causes of change and the matters of conﬂict. Most certainly they will bring about the resurrection and purify those opposites in order to obtain these results. Thus, as a result of this puriﬁcation Hell will take on its eternal and dread ful form and its inmates will manifest the threat: AYET While Paradise will assume its everlasting and majestic form, and its people and companions will manifest the address of: AYET As is proved in the Second Question of the First Station of the Twenty Eighth Word, through His perfect power, the Pre-Eternally All-Wise One will give the inhabitants of these two houses eternal and permanent bodies which will not be subject to dissolution, change, old age, or decline. For there will be no causes of change, which are the cause of decline.

 intrigues of the foreigners and the stratagems of the secret societies, nothing was found to connect any R i s a l e - i  N u r  student with any of the many existent associations. This was a most clear and brilliant instance of dominical protection and divine preservation, and was a favour of the Most Merciful corroborating the wondrous predictions concerning the R i s a l e - i  N u r of Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) and Ghawth al-A‘zam ( May Allah be pleased with him ). The hands of forty-two of our innocent, wronged brothers raised in supplication to the divine court halted a missile directed at them, turned it back and in effect exploded it over the heads of those who had fired it. Our losses amount to only a few minor cuts and bruises which will gain us reward. It is a marvel to be saved with such minor injury from a gun that was being charged for the past year. One should respond with thanks and joy to such a great bounty. After this our lives will not be our own, for according to the plans of the spreaders of corruption, we were to be completely wiped out. That means after this we should pledge our lives not to ourselves, but to truth and reality. We should try to always see the trace, face, and essence of mercy in things, which will cause us not to complain, but to offer thanks. S a i d  N u r s i I request of my brothers that they are not offended at one another due to discomfort, or distress of the spirit, or fastidiousness, or being deceived by Satan’s wiles, or at the offensive language uttered by some of them. They should not say that their honour has been insulted. I take upon myself any bad words that are spoken. They should not be offended. If I had a hundred honours, I would sacrifice all of them for love and cordiality among my brothers. S a i d  N u r s i * * * * * * 364 THE FLASHES My Brothers! I have understood certainly the last two or three days that unfortunately we suffered a blow from divine mercy. I understood even that one of the many indications of a verse concerning the people of rebellion looks to us. It is this: ( 6:44 ) Ù  ... Î Í Ì Ë Ê That is, “ When they forgot the instruction and advice with which we have warned them and did not act in accordance with it, We took hold of them and afflicted them with disaste

 acquit us on the second day made this ﬁery speech  superﬂuous. ) S a i d  N u r s i , in total isolation and solitary conﬁnement * * * The Correct Answer to an Important Question Several high-ranking ofﬁcials asked me: “ Why did you not accept Mus tafa Kemal’s offer of a three-hundred-lira salary and the post of general preacher in Kurdistan and the Eastern Provinces in place of Shaykh Sanusi? 1 If you had accepted it, you would have been instrumental in saving the lives of the hundred thousand people who were slaughtered because of the revolution. ” I told them in reply: the R i s a l e - i  N u r , which has been the means of gain ing for hundreds of thousands of our fellow-countrymen millions of years of life in the hereafter, has performed that task a thousand times over, in place of twenty or thirty years of worldly life I was unable to save for those people. If I had accepted the offer, the R i s a l e - i  N u r would not have come into being, which can be the tool of nothing nor follow anything and holds the mystery of sincerity. I even told my respected brothers in prison: if those who have sought my execution because of the heavy blows of the R i s a l e - i  N u r , which was sent to Ankara, save their belief through the R i s a l e - i  N u r  and are delivered from eternal annihilation, you bear witness that I forgive them with all my life and soul! I told those who were pestering me with their surveillance in Denizli after our acquittal, and the high-ranking ofﬁcials and police chief and inspectors: It is an undeniable wonder of the R i s a l e - i  N u r that in nine months of close investigations no document has been found or connection of any kind with any movement, association, or society here or abroad, in the twenty years of my life of oppression, or in the hundreds of my treatises and letters, or among my thousands of students. Could this extraordinary situation have been achieved by the power of thought or through some arrangement? If the private concerns of one person over a number of years are brought to light, certainly there would be twenty matters to embarass or convict him.  1. See page 381-2, footnote 9. 322 THE RAYS Since the fact is this, you will say either that some brilliant undefeatable genius is organizing the matter, or t

Metin:
 excites a pathetic sorrow arising from the lack  of friends, from being ownerless; not an elevated sorrow. For it is a woebegone sadness inspired by deaf nature and blind force. It  shows the world as desolate, not in any other way. It depicts it in this way, holds the sorrowing man there, places him ownerless  among strangers, leaving him without hope. Due to this feeling of consternation it has given him, he gradually sinks into misguidance; it opens up the way to atheism, from whence it is difﬁcult to return. Perhaps he never will return. Qur’anic literature produces a sorrow, but it is the sorrow of love, not of orphans. It arises from separation from friends, not from the lack of them. Its view of the universe, in place of blind nature, is as conscious, merciful  divine art; it does not speak of nature. Instead of blind force, it describes wise and purposeful divine power. The universe, therefore, does not take on the form of a desolate wasteland. Indeed, in the view of the grieving one it addresses, it becomes a gathering of friends. On every side mutual love and response, which cause no distress. The friendliness at every corner draws the melancholy person into society, giving him a yearning sorrow, an elevated feeling; not a dejected mournfulness. Both give rise to eagerness. But through the eagerness provoked by the foreign literature, the soul becomes excited, the desires are stimulated; its gives no joy to the spirit. The Qur’an’s eagerness, however, ﬁres the spirit, gives rise to a lofty eagerness. It is for this reason that the Shari‘a of Muhammad ( UWBP ) wants no amusements or diversion. GLEAMS 833 It has forbidden some musical instruments, for amusement, and permitted others. That is to say, instruments producing Qur’anic sorrow or revelational  eagerness are not harmful. But if it produces the woebegone grief of the orphan or carnal thrills, the instrument is prohibited. It changes from person to person, not everyone is the same. * * * Branches Offer Fruits in the Name of Mercy On every side the branches of the tree of creation apparently extend the  fruits of bounties to the hands of beings with spirits. But in reality it is a hand of mercy, a hand of power, which holds out to us  those branches and fruits. You should kiss that hand of merc
