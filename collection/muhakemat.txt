Publisher’s Preface

Bediuzzaman Said Nursi ( 1876–1960 ) states clearly at both the begin-
ning and end of the present book his intention in writing it. His chief aim 
was to set out the principles of Qur’anic exegesis, and in so doing to demon-
strate the straight path of Islam, thereby removing the doubts of the sceptics 
on the one hand and rectifying a number of misunderstandings adhered to 
by literalist ulema on the other. The basis of the doubts and misunderstand-
ings he was attempting to reply to was “ the groundless idea ” of there being 
a clash and conﬂict between Islam and science. This preface will ﬁrstly set 
the work in context and explain brieﬂy the backgound to its writing and then 
in the light of this will outline the way the book is set out.

Some time after returning to eastern Anatolia from Istanbul in early 1910 
two years after the reinstatement of the Constitution, Bediuzzaman made a 
journey around the region which produced two fruits: one was a work which 
recorded  his  debates  with  Kurdish  tribesmen  about  constitutionalism  and 
what  it  meant  for  them  and  was  called  D i s p u t a t i o n s   (   M ü n â z a r a t   ) ,  while 
the other was the present work, which addressed the ulema and was enti-
tled R a t i o n a l   A r g u m e n t s   (   M u h â k e m a t   )  and in the original Arabic version, 
A   P r e s c r i p t i o n   f o r   t h e   U l e m a .  The  full  title  of  the  Turkish  version  is  T h e  
P r e s c r i p t i o n   f o r   a   S i c k  A g e ,  A n   I l l   P e o p l e ,  A   D i s e a s e d   M e m b e r,   o r   P o l i s h i n g  
I s l a m ,   o r   B e d i u z z a m a n ’s   R a t i o n a l   A r g u m e n t s . It’s shortened title, however, 
is generally used.

The projects for educational reform that Bediuzzaman proposed as the 
mainspring  of  the  development  of  eastern  Anatolia  within  the    Ottoman 
Empire envisaged the introduction of the modern sciences into medrese edu-
cation and their joint teaching with the traditional religious sciences. This 
demanded the acceptance of science by the religious scholars of standing, 
the  ulema,  who  were  held  in  respect  by  the  people,  in  both  the  medreses 
and the mosques. Most probably due to the inﬂuence of certain traditional 
schools  of  thought,  the  ulemas’  literalist  interpretation  of  verses  of  the 
Qur’an and Hadiths, together with their lack of knowledge of modern sci-
ence  and  their  associating  it  with  increasing  European  inﬂuence,  had  led

many of them to bitterly oppose it, chieﬂy on the grounds that some of its 
matters conﬂicted with Revelation. In this they were in agreement with reli-
gious sceptics who lacked knowledge of Islam and put their faith in science. 
Bediuzzaman therefore speciﬁed literalism and those who practised it as a 
key  factor  hindering  the  development  and  progress  of  the  region  and  the 
Ottomans generally. 

The solution for the above situation that Bediuzzaman offered with this 
book lay in his setting out a number of rational principles for Qur’anic exe-
gesis, included in a variety of disciplines. What he was proposing was not 
new as is shown below; what was new was his approach and style and his 
pinpointing speciﬁc problems associated with literalism and his demonstrat-
ing how they could be overcome. He was also at pains to show that, if inter-
preted correctly in the light of such sciences as rhetoric, Arabic, and logic, 
verses of the Qur’an that had been imagined to conﬂict with modern science, 
were in fact congruent with it.

The basis of Bediuzzaman’s argument was that “ Islam ... is founded on 
reality, girded with proof, consults with reason, is seated on the throne of 
truth, and is conformable with the principles of wisdom [ in the cosmos ] that 
continue  in  sequence  from  pre-eternity  to  post-eternity. ”  In  the  course  of 
time, however, Islam as it was in reality had become obscured due to neglect 
and  other  circumstances,  causing  the  decline  of  the  Muslims  and  Islamic 
world. Bediuzzaman argued that since the Qur’an addresses the human rea-
son  and  conscience  and  other  inner  faculties,  it  indicates  both  the  path  to 
be taken to reverse the decline, and its superiority over other  religions. He 
therefore  exposed  what  he  saw  to  be  the  main  matters  obscuring  Islam’s 
reality,  causing  superstition  and  false  beliefs  to  become  confused  with  it, 
and  he  showed  that  applying  the  disciplines  of  logic,  rational  demonstra-
tion and argumentation, rhetoric, and the linguistic sciences, truth, in other 
words, the reality of Islam, might be revealed. In any event the purpose of all 
these disciplines, as well as of all the Islamic sciences, is the ascertainment 
of truth and reality. It is the purpose too of modern science, as Bediuzzaman 
was at pains to show, for which reason, just as the Qur’an and the universe 
are mutually interpretative, so the Qur’an and Islam are “ completely com-
patible ” with the physical sciences, let alone conﬂicting or being contradic-
tory. Hence the title of the First Article, The Element of Reality.

In his endeavours to reveal the reality of Islam Bediuzzaman employed 
the disciplines mentioned above. This was not an innovation, however, for 
they were all taught in the medreses. He states his position and method with 

PUBLISHER’S PREFACE

the ﬁrst proposition of the First Premise of the First Article: if reason and 
scripture  conﬂict,  reason  is  taken  as  basic  and  scripture  is  interpreted.  As 
he says, this is “ an established principle, ” for it was an exegetical principle 
favoured by scholars of the Ash‘arī School. It had been called “ the rule of 
interpretation ” by al-Ghazali, “ the universal rule ” by al-Razi, and had been 
expounded by al-Taftazani and al-Sayyid al-Sharif al-Jurjani, whose k a l ā m  
manuals  were  basic  texts  taught  in  the  medreses.  Mention  is  made  of  all 
these eminent scholars in various contexts in this book.

Recalling the importance of logical reasoning and the other disciplines 
he has elucidated in outlining his proposed principles for Qur’anic exegesis, 
Bediuzzaman invites his readers to combine the Element of Reality, the First 
Article, with the Element of Rhetoric and Eloquence, the Second Article, as 
though the former were the major premise and the latter the minor premise, 
so  as  to  produce  the  result  or  conclusion  of  the  Element  of  Doctrine,  the 
Third Article.

In the Third Article, Bediuzzaman intended to offer proofs for the four 
main aims of the Qur’an; that is, proof of the Single Maker, prophethood, 
bodily resurrection, and justice, the chief tenets of  belief. However, hav-
ing established the truth of the ﬁrst two of the four main aims with various 
proofs and in places making reference to modern science, the work remained 
unﬁnished with the third, the resurrection of the dead, to be completed only 
thirty years later with the R i s a l e - i   N u r .
A   n o t e   o n   t h e   t e r m   ‘ h i k m e t ’ ,   a   k e y   t e r m   i n   t h e   F i r s t   A r t i c l e :

Historically, various meanings have been assigned the term h i k m e t  in dif-
ferent branches of Islamic thought in addition to its usual meaning, wisdom. 
It has been deﬁned as “ knowledge of, or the theoretical science that inves-
tigates to the limits of human ability, the true nature or reality of the things 
in existence. ” It was thus used synonymously with the term philosophy, and 
often with what was known as natural philosophy. By natural philosophy 
was meant natural science, especially the physical sciences and the study of 
nature. In the nineteenth century, what we now know as science acquired its 
modern meaning, together with the development of its various branches, that 
is, biology, botany, geology, and so on. With the introduction of the modern 
sciences into the Ottoman Empire in the nineteenth century, writers used the 
term  hikmet  to  refer  to  both  Islamic  philosophy  and  Western  philosophy. 
H i k m e t - i   c e d i d e   referred  to  modern  philosophy.  H i k m e t   was  also  used  to 
refer to modern science in such expressions as h i k m e t - i   t e c r ü b i y e  ( empiri-
cal science ). When it comes to Bediuzzaman, he uses the term h i k m e t  in all 

10

three meanings: he occasionally uses in the sense of philosophy generally, 
as  when  referring  to  Greek  philosophy;  he  more  frequently  uses  it  mean-
ing natural philosophy, but in doing this, distinguishes between ancient phi-
losophy  (   e s k i   h i k m e t ,   h i k m e t - i   a t î k a   ) , which he denigrates as superstition 
since it was based on the geocentric Ptolemaic system, and modern science 
(   h i k m e t - i   c e d i d e   ) . He also uses the term h i k m e t  on its own meaning modern 
science. For modern science he also and more usually uses the newer term 
fenn ( pl. f ü n u n  ) and in the text mentions many of its disciplines.

All  benedictions  are  due  to  the  Pre-Eternal  Sovereign,  Eternally  All-
Wise,  the  Undying  Most-Merciful,  Who  has  honoured  us  with  Islam  and 
guided us with the Illustrious Shari‘a to the straight path.

Such  a  Shari‘a  that  reason  and  transmitted  knowledge  have  united  to 

affirm the veracity of its truths.

Such truths that being firmly rooted in the ground of reality, their boughs 
and branches rise spreading to the skies of perfection. Such branches that 
they yield the fruits of happiness in this world and the next.
And He has guided us through the Inimitable Qur’an;
Such a Book that having disclosed through its principles the precise, pro-
found, divine laws inscribed by the hand of destiny and pen of wisdom in the 
book of the world’s creation, and are in force in it, it has become the abso-
lute guarantor through its just injunctions of mankind’s order, balance, and 
progress, and is its universal master.

Endless blessings be bestowed upon the Prince of the Universe and Glory 
of the World to whose messengership the world with all its realms and their 
beings testified, and to whose miracles it bore witness, and announced the 
lofty wares he brought from the treasury of the unseen. As though on coming 
into the world, each realm applauded him in its own tongue. The Pre-Eternal 
Monarch, plucking the strings of the heavens and the earth so that each with 
a  different tongue hymned the strains of his miracles, caused the empyrean 
to ring out with the sweet sound. And so it will for all eternity. As though the 
skies uttered felicitations with the heavenly tongues of the angels and moons 
and his own ascension; and the earth lauded his miracles with the tongues 
of its stones, trees, and animals; and the atmosphere gave the glad tidings of 
his prophethood through the signs of the jinns and the shady clouds; and the 
past betokened through the prognostications of the prophets and soothsayers

the dawn of that sun of truth; and the present, that is, the Era of Bliss, held 
up as witness to his prophethood the mighty revolution that occurred in the 
character of the Arabs and the almost instantaneous emergence of absolute 
civilisation out of absolute primitivity; and the future welcomed his propiti-
ous arrival through its events and the stages of its precise sciences, and offe-
red thanks with its wise tongue for his guidance; and humankind proclaimed 
through  its  seekers  after  truth,  and  particularly  through  the  articulate  ton-
gue of Muhammad ( UWBP ) himself, being a proof of himself, that he had 
come from the Truth; and the All-Glorious One recited through the eloquent 
tongue of His Qur’an the decree of the Unlettered Prophet’s messengership. 
And so they do all recite and declaim it.

To proceed: this wretched, strange Nursi, who although he deserves to 
be called the Oddity of the Age became known as the Wonder of the Age 
( Bediuzzaman ), cries out in extreme pain at the nation’s decline, alas and 
alack! For abandoning the essence and kernel of Islam, we fixed our gazes 
on its exterior and shell. And due to misunderstandings and ill manners, we 
did not afford Islam its right nor pay it the respect it was due. So in disgust it 
swathed itself in clouds of illusion and delusion, and concealed itself. And it 
had the right, for we mixed i s r a i l i y y a t  1 with the fundamentals of belief, and 
stories with the tenets of faith, and metaphors with the truths of belief, and 
did not appreciate its value. So to punish us in this world, it left us in abase-
ment and penury. And what will save us, is again its mercy.

O Muslim brothers! We shall offer it an apology. Together we shall dec-
lare our loyalty and pay it allegiance. We shall grasp hold of its strong rope.
Also, I declare fearlessly that what has stirred me up and given me the 
courage to contest the ideas of past centuries, and to defend against the ima-
ginings and misapprehensions that have gained strength through the strate-
gies of hundreds of years, is my certain conviction that truth will sprout and 
grow, although it is concealed in the earth; and its partisans and supporters 
will be triumphant, although they may be weak and few in number due to the 
inclemency of time and place.

It is also my belief that it shall be the reality of Islam (   h a k i k a t - ı  İ s l a m i y e   )  
which will prevail over the future and be absolute ruler in every continent. 
It is Islam that will conquer them; the signs of this are to be seen. For in the 
past, eight obstacles prevented the Illustrious Shari‘a vanquishing comple-
tely the bigotry and blind imitation of tent-dwellers in their far-ﬂung priva-
tion, and the embellished trivia and despotism of house-dwellers in the lands 
of ignorance. But now they have been routed by three truths, or are being 
routed. The obstacles obstructing the Europeans were their blind imitation, 
ignorance, and bigotry, and the authority of their priests; while those obs-
tructing us were various forms of despotism, immorality, our confused cir-
cumstances, and despair, which leads to idleness. These obstacles caused the 
steady eclipsing of the sun of Islam.

1.   İ s r a i l i y y a t  ( Ar.  i s r ā ’ ī l i y y ā t  ): the body of narrative material derived from Jewish 
and Christian sources that from an early date was introduced into Islam and used chieﬂy 
in t a f s i r s  and histories to illustrate and enlarge upon topics about which few details were 
given or known.

16

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

The  eighth,  and  principal,  obstacle  and  chief  calamity  is  this:  together 
with the Europeans we deludedly imagined (   t e v e h h ü m   )  there to be a clash 
and contradiction between some of the apparent matters of Islam (   z e v â h i r - i  
İ s l a m i y e t   )  and some questions of science. Bravo to the abounding efforts of 
education and science (   f ü n u n   ) ! For they have decked us out with the desire 
to search for the truth, love of humanity, and the tendency to be fair, and 
have overturned those obstacles and got rid of them, and are so doing.

Yes, the chief reason we have been deprived of the comforts of this world 
and the Europeans have been deprived of the happiness of the next and the 
sun of Islam has been eclipsed, is the misunderstanding and groundless idea 
of the clash and conﬂict between Islam and science. How strange! How can 
a slave hostilely oppose his master, or a servant his lord, or a child his fat-
her?  For  Islam  is  the  master  and  guide  of  the  sciences  (   f ü n u n   ) ,  and  the 
chief  and  father  of  all  true  knowledge  (   u l û m   ) .  But  regretably,  the  above 
misapprehension and false idea has prevailed up to the present, and with its 
doubts has caused despair and closed up the door or civilisation and learning 
(   m a ’ a r i f   )  to the Kurds and their likes. For imagining some of the apparent 
matters of religion to be opposed to some questions of science, they shied 
away from them. For instance, the sphericity of the earth, the very first step 
of geography, is the most elementary matter of science. But because they 
supposed this self-evident matter to be contrary to the six matters to be dis-
cussed later, they did not hold back from arrogantly challenging it.

O  you  who  is  scrutinizing  this  book  of  mine!  Know  that  the  service  I 
want to perform with it is this: by demonstrating the straight path of Islam, 
I want both to repel the doubts of those inimical to religion – who go to one 
extreme – and to throw their doubts in their faces; and to repulse the misapp-
rehensions of the literalists (   z â h i r p e r e s t   )  and those who go to the other ext-
reme and deserve the epithet ‘fatuous friends’ and to show their false noti-
ons to be baseless. I want too to help and support the genuine scholars of 
Islam, and the intelligent and loyal, who guide to the truth and pave the way 
leading to Islam’s good fortune and future, striving with complete certainty 
of victory.

I n   S h o r t :  My aim is to polish that diamond sword.
I f   y o u   a s k :   What  is  this  anxiety  of  yours?  And  what  need  is  there  to 
provide proofs (   b ü r h a n   )  for knowledge that is axiomatic? For to advance 
proofs for questions that have become self-evident through the admixture 
of ideas and discoveries of the empirical sciences, is to announce what is 
known.

B y   w a y   o f   a n s w e r   I   s a y   t h i s :  Regretably, although all those who share 
with me this slice of time are apparently the children of the thirteenth cen-
tury, they are in respect of ideas and progress, relics of the Middle Ages. 
It is as if our contemporaries are the index of the centuries from the end of 
the third to the thirteenth, or are samples of them, or are a hybrid people. 
In fact, many self-evident matters of the present, are deemed by them to 
be delusions.

THE ELEMENT OF REALITY
Introduction 

This book is set out as three articles. The First Article throws light on the 
element of reality, or on the polishing up of Islam by means of a number of 
premises and matters. The Second Article discloses the element of rhetoric. 
The Third elucidates by means of the element of doctrine the answers to the 
Japanese. As for the books, 1 they are a sort of Qur’anic commentary (   t e f -
s i r   )  realised through investigation of the sciences of the heavens, earth, and 
humankind alluded to in the Qur’an.

The First Article

It is one of the rules of the authoritative scholars to use premises (   m u k a d -
d e m e   )  in order to reach one’s objective. We therefore shall build a staircase 
of twelve steps.

The First Premise

The First Premise 
It  is  an  established  principle  that  when  reason  and  transmitted  sacred 
texts conﬂict, reason is taken as basic and the sacred text is interpreted. 2 But 
then reason has to be [ true ] reason.

It  is  also  established  that  the  fundamental  aims  of  the  Qur’an  and  its 
essential elements, which pervade all parts of it, are fourfold. They are proof 
of the Single Maker, prophethood, bodily resurrection, and justice. That is 
to say, it is only the Qur’an that can supply decisive answers to the questions 

1.  The books  (   k i t a p   )  here mentioned, which in other places in the text are said to 
number three, evidently refer to three sections which were planned for this uncompleted 
work but remained unwritten. They were to contain more detailed expositions of some of 
the matters discussed. See pages 57, 103, 115, 118, 125. It is suggested that these books 
were realised in different form in Bediuzzaman’s Qur’anic commentary, I s h ā r ā t   a l - I ‘ j ā z , 
composed 1913-14, published 1918. English tr., S i g n s   o f   M i r a c u l o u s n e s s .   T h e   I n i m i t a b i l -

posed to the universe by science (   h i k m e t   ) :  1 “ Tell me, O universe, where 
do  you  come  from  and  at  whose  command?  Who  is  your  ruler?  Who  is 
your guide and your spokesman? What will you do here and where will you 
go afterwards? ” Accordingly, apart from in connection with its main aims, 
mention of the universe in the Qur’an is digressive; it should lead by way 
of deductive reasoning  (   i s t i d l â l   )  from the order of its art to the Glorious 
Maker. Yes, order is apparent; in its perfect clarity it is self-evident. Its art 
testiﬁes decisively to the Maker’s existence, intention, and will, and shows 
itself in every facet of the universe, displaying the shining beauty of its crea-
tion to the gaze of science. It is as though every creature is a tongue extolling 
the Maker’s wisdom, and every species and realm of being raises its ﬁnger, 
testifying and pointing to it. Since the purpose is this, and since we are learn-
ing the signs and indications of the order from the book of the universe, and 
since the conclusions are all the same; how the universe is actually formed 
does not concern us. However, each being that enters the lofty council of the 
Qur’an is charged with four duties:

T h e   F i r s t :  To proclaim through its conforming with the order, the sover-

eignty of the Pre-Eternal Monarch. 

T h e   S e c o n d :  Since each is the subject of a true science (   f e n n - i   h a k i k î   ) , it 

is to show that Islam is the sum and substance of the true sciences. 

T h e   T h i r d :  Since each is a sample of its species, to prove that Islam is in 
conformity with the divine laws and principles in force in the universe, and 
corresponds to them. Then Islam may grow and ﬂourish through the assist-
ance of those natural laws. Yes, in this respect the clear religion of Islam is 
far superior to other religions, which uncertain and unaided, at the behest of 
whim and caprice sometimes scatter light and sometimes darkness, and are 
subject to change.

T h e   F o u r t h :  Since each being is a sample of reality, its duty is to direct 
minds  towards  truths  and  to  encourage  them  and  admonish  them.  For 
instance,  the  heavenly  bodies,  both  lofty  and  lowly,  are  distinguished  by 
being the subject of oaths in the Qur’an, and constantly exhort the heedless 
to ponder over themselves. Yes, the Qur’anic oaths are a rap over the knuck-
les for those drifting in slumbers of heedlessness.

We have now established this to be the case, so it should in no way be 
doubted that the Guiding Qur’an, which is inimitable and whose eloquence 
is  of  the  very  highest  degree,  will  choose  the  most  appropriate  styles  of

Arabic and the most direct, the clearest, and the shortest method of deduc-
tive reasoning. This means that to an extent it will take into account the feel-
ings of the masses in order to get them to understand and to guide them. So 
it will mention the universe’s order, which forms the evidence, in a way that 
is familiar to them and known by them. Otherwise the evidence would be 
more obscure than the thing claimed, and that would be contrary to correct 
methods of guidance, eloquence, and inimitability.

For example, if the Qur’an had said: O people! Behold the globe ecstati-
cally whirling in space, and the sun stationary in its settled abode although 
it is in motion, and the power of gravity holding the lofty bodies together, 
and the chemical reactions between the many elements, the tree of creation 
the branches of which spread through inﬁnite space; ponder over these and 
envisage the sublimity of the world’s Maker. Or peer through microscope 
of your mind at a drop of water, for it contains a world of organisms despite 
its small size, and afﬁrm that the cosmos’ Maker is powerful over all things.
The evidence would surely then be more obscure than the thing claimed 
and more in need of explanation. Is that not so? And would it not be unrea-
sonable to elucidate the truth with something that is unknown to them or to 
confuse their honest emotions with sophistries? The Qur’an’s miraculous-
ness is so elevated and free of fault, however, that the dust of misleading 
statements cannot cloud its shining purity.

Nevertheless, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition both makes allusion 
to its true aims within the convolutions of its clear verses, and it beams light 
on them with the apparent meanings of some of its verses, as with the allu-
sions (   k i n â y e   )  it makes.

Also, it is an established principle in the art of rhetoric that when using 
metonymies and making allusions, the literal meanings, known as primary 
meanings, are not deemed true or false. For such ﬁgures refer to the second-
ary meaning, which is what is intended. For example, if it is said that so-and-
so’s sword-belt is long, the statement is true if the person is tall, even if he 
does not have a sword. It is not a lie.

Also, just as in speech one word is the indicator (   k a r i n e   )  of a metaphor; 
so some verses of Allah’s Word, which resembles a single word, act as indi-
cators of the truths and substance of their brothers, and show them the way, 
and point to the secrets in their neighbours’ hearts, and interpret them.

I n   S h o r t :  Those people who cannot visualize this truth and balance up 
and judge the verses properly only make themselves ridiculous in the view

of reality, like the famous Bektashi who when seeking an excuse to give up 
the obligatory prayers, said: “ The Qur’an says: ( 4:43 ) x  w  v and 
I haven’t memorised the rest. ”

The Second Premise

The Second Premise

Something that in the past was theoretical may in the future be self-evi-
dent. It has been as follows: present in the world is an inclination towards 
perfection  1  due  to  which  creation  is  dependent  on  the  law  of  evolution 
(   t e k â m ü l   ) . Humanity, too, inclines towards perfection and desires progress 
since it is one of the world’s fruits and parts. This desire grows and develops 
through the meeting of minds and accumulation of ideas, and the accumula-
tion of ideas expands through basic principles being perfected. Basic princi-
ples being perfected fertilises the seeds of the physical sciences by sowing 
them in the ground from the loins of creation cultivated by the times. As for 
the seeds, they sprout and grow through gradual experimentation.

In consequence, there are numerous questions that are now obvious and 
have become common knowledge, but in the past were completely theoreti-
cal and hidden and in need of proof. For we see that thanks to the perfect-
ing of principles and means and the discoveries of combined minds, many 
matters of geography, astronomy, chemistry and applied geometry are not 
unknown even to the children of today; they play with them like toys, but 
to Ibn Sina  2 and his likes they were theoretical and hidden. Ibn Sina was 
like the father of science, and in respect of his acute intelligence, powerful 
thought,  mature  wisdom,  and  breadth  of  imaginative  power,  would  prove 
far superior if compared with even hundreds of today’s sages. He was not 
lacking anything, for he was a son of his times; he was made deﬁcient by the 
deﬁciency of the times. Isn’t it clear that if the discovery of the New World, 
which was the reason for the learned Columbus’  3 fame, had remained to

today, any caique owner, the least worthy of sea captains, would have been 
capable of making the New World the neighbour of the Old. A small boat 
and a compass would have been sufﬁcient substitute for the wide knowledge 
and braving of hazards of the earlier explorer. Attention should also be paid 
to the following truth. The matters are of two sorts:

The meeting of minds is inﬂuential on the ﬁrst; indeed, it is dependent on 
it; just as co-operation is necessary to lift a large physical stone. But in the 
second sort, co-operation and combining ideas are essentially without effect. 
One and a thousand are equal. Just like jumping over a chasm or passing 
through a narrow deﬁle; the whole and a part are the same. Co-operation is 
proﬁtless.

According to this analogy, some of the sciences (   f ü n u n   )  are in need of 
co-operation, like when lifting a large boulder. These are mostly the physical 
sciences  (   u l û m - u   m â d d i y e   ) . The other sort resemble the second example; 
they are perfected instantaneously, or so it seems. They are mostly sciences 
dealing with ethics or metaphysics (   m â n e v i y a t   )  or theology. The accumu-
lation of ideas does not alter, perfect, or augment them, but it does clarify, 
disclose, and strengthen their methods of proof.

It should also be noted that if a person becomes deeply involved in some-
thing, it usually makes him slow in other things. It is because of this that 
the  person  who  becomes  absorbed  in  materiality  grows  ignorant  of  spir-
itual and non-material matters and his knowledge is superﬁcial. Hence, just 
as the pronouncement concerning moral and spiritual matters of someone 
proﬁcient in material ones will not be authoritative, so most of the things 
he says about them will not be worth listening to. For sure, if, drawing an 
analogy between medicine and engineering, an invalid were to consult an 
engineer instead of the doctor and take the medicine he prescribed, it would 
mean inviting his relatives to his wake and asking for a report ordering his 
transfer to the hospital of the graveyard. Similarly, to consult the ideas of the 
materialists concerning spiritual matters, which are sheer truths and totally 
abstract, is quite simply to announce the arrest of the heart, a subtle domini-
cal faculty, and the death of the mind, a luminous substance. Yes, the minds 
of those who seek everything in materiality see no further than their eyes, 
and the eyes cannot see spiritual matters.

The Third Premise

The Third Premise

On entering the fold of Islam, a sort of i s r a i l i y y a t  1 and a part of Greek 
philosophy assumed the garb of religion and threw minds into confusion. It 
was like this: the Arabs had been an illiterate people in the Era of Ignorance. 
Then the truth was manifested among them and their emotions were awak-
ened with all their potentialities. And since they had seen the Clear Religion 
open  up  a  way  in  full  view,  they  focused  all  their  efforts  and  desires  on 
learning it alone. And they observed the universe not with the dissecting eye 
of philosophy but in second place, for purposes of deduction. The only inspi-
ration  their  sensitive  natural  intuition  received  was  from  their  expansive, 
elevated surroundings, which were in tune with their primordial natures; and 
the only training and education their unsullied, capable innate dispositions 
received was from the Qur’an. Later, just as the Arabs swallowed up other 
peoples, so too the knowledge of the other nations began to become Muslim, 
even. By virtue of this, such scholars of the People of the Book as Wahb and 
Ka‘b found a way into the treasuries of the Arabs’ imaginings and caused 
confusion in their unspoilt minds. Later they were even held in respect. For 
the scholars of the People of the Book who embraced Islam acquired great 
dignity and they advanced through its distinction, and their former gilded 
knowledge  became  accepted  and  seemingly  incontestable,  and  it  was  not 
refuted. For since it did not clash with the principles of Islam, it was narrated 
like  stories,  and  because  of  its  unimportance,  the  Arabs  listened  without 
criticising it. But alas! It was later looked on as fact and became the cause of 
many doubts and uncertainties.

Also,  the  i s r a i l i y y a t   could  have  been  source  of  some  allusions  of  the 
Qur’an and Sunna, or, by some connection or other, a reference for some of 
their concepts. But supposing the i s r a i l i y y a t  had been true, since it was pos-
sible that it corroborated aspects of the scriptures’ meanings, due to their ill 
judgement some literalist scholars who could ﬁnd no other source or did not 
look for one, applied certain verses and Hadiths to those i s r a i l i y y a t  stories 
and expounded them by means of them. However, it is only the Qur’an itself 
and sound Hadiths that can expound the Qur’an, not the Gospels and Torah, 
whose injunctions have been abrogated and stories even are corrupted. Yes, 
the meaning of a thing and something that corroborates it  (   m â s a d a q   )  are 

1. See page 15 fn 1 above.

FIRST ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF REALITY

25

different.  But  then  something  that  could  have  corroborated  the  meaning 
was substituted for it, and numerous possibilities were confused with facts.
Also, in Ma’mun’s time, Greek philosophy was translated so as to make 
it Muslim. But since it had as its source numerous myths and superstitions, 
it was somewhat putrid, and confused to a degree the unspoiled minds of the 
Arabs when it intermixed with them. So too it paved the way leading from 
investigative study to blind imitation.

Also, although with their innate imaginative faculties they had the abil-
ity to deduce matters from Islam, the water of life, they deigned to become 
pupils of that philosophy. Yes, just as when their ability to speak truly elo-
quent Arabic 1 began to be impaired by mixing with non-Arabs, the authori-
tative scholars codiﬁed the rules of the sciences of Arabic so as to preserve 
them;  so  too,  when  philosophy  and  i s r a i l i y y a t   entered  the  fold  of  Islam, 
some  punctilious  Islamic  scholars  attempted  to  sort  them  out  and  purify 
Islam of them. But alas! they were not altogether successful.

But that was not all; for when they endeavoured to expound the Qur’an, 
literalists applied the transmitted knowledge it contains (   n a k l i y a t   )  to some 
i s r a i l i y y a t  and adapted its verses requiring reasoned interpretation (   a k l i y a t   )  
to the above-mentioned philosophy. For they saw that the Qur’an comprises 
both transmitted (   m e n k u l   )  and reasoned (   m â k u l   )  knowledge. Hadiths are 
the same. Then they deduced a correspondence and relation between some 
of the true matters of the Qur’an and Sunna, and corrupted matters of the 
i s r a i l i y y a t . And because they imagined similarities and agreement between 
the matters addressing reason of the former, which are true, and philosophy, 
which is fallacious and delusive, they supposed that the correspondence and 
similarities expounded the meanings of the Book and Sunna and elucidated 
their purposes.

Allah forbid! The criterion of the Book of Miraculous Exposition is its 
miraculous inimitability. What will expound it is its own parts. Its mean-
ing is within it. Even its shell is of pearl, not clods. Even if their purpose in 
disclosing the congruity had been to pronounce ﬁt that truthful witness, it 
still would have been futile. For the Perspicuous Qur’an is far above such 
pronouncements  concerning  reasoned  and  revealed  knowledge,  which 
have anyway handed over to it the keys of submission, and it stands in no 
need of them. For if it does not pronounce them ﬁt, their testimony will

not be heard. Yes, you have to search for the Pleiades in the skies not on 
the ground. And you should seek the Qur’an’s meanings in its shells, not 
in your pocket, which is all mixed up. For you won’t ﬁnd them there. And 
even if you do, the Qur’an will not accept them, for they will not bear the 
stamp of miraculousness.

For it is established that the true meaning is that which the words empty 
out in the ear-hole then penetrating the mind, suffuses the conscience and 
produces copious blossoms of ideas. For if some possibilities have impinged 
on  your  imagination  due  to  your  preoccupation  with  other  things,  or  you 
have ﬁlched some futilities from philosophy and fables and stories, and ﬁll-
ing your pockets with them have hidden them in amongst the convolutions 
of the Qur’an’s verses and Hadiths, then pulled them out, held them up and 
called out: “ The meaning is this! Come and take it! ”  - if you were to do 
this, you would receive this answer: “ Come on! This meaning of yours is 
unclear.  It  bears  the  stamp  of  blind  imitation! ”  The  assayer  of  truth  will 
reject it. The Sultan of Miraculousness will send the minter packing. You 
will have transgressed against the orderliness of the verses and Hadiths, so 
they  will  issue  a  complaint  against  you,  and  the  judge  of  eloquence  will 
imprison  your  delusions  in  your  imagination.  Moreover,  the  customer  for 
reality will not buy these wares of yours. He’ll say: “ The verses’ meanings 
are of pearl and this is mere clods. What the Hadiths impart is spirit, but this 
resembles nothing more than a gadﬂy! ”
An Explanatory Tale

A literary tale told by the Kurds: There was a man called Alo who used 
to steal honey. He was told he would be found out. So in order to fool them, 
he got wild bees to ﬁll up an empty comb and stole honey from somewhere 
else. This he hid in the hive. If anyone asked him about it, he would say: 
“ It’s  the  artwork  of  my  bees,  for  they  are  honey  engineers. ”  Then  when 

conversing with his bees, they would say together: 
“ You do the buzzing, I provide the honey! ”

ْ(cid:299) ِ(cid:296) ِژ  ْ(cid:299)(cid:315)ِ(cid:335) ِ(cid:349)ْ(cid:301) ِ(cid:304) ه َو ِژ  ْ(cid:267)ِ(cid:334)  ْ(cid:267)ِ(cid:334)  

Good  Sir  who  makes  forced  interpretations  with  good  appetite!  Don’t 
ﬁnd solace in this tale; it is a parable (   t e ş b i h   ) . The meaning you produce is 
not honey; it’s poison. And those words are not bees; they are the words of 
that consummate Book, revealing the spirits of truths to the heart and con-
science, like angels. Hadiths are the source of life and inspire reality. 

I n   S h o r t :   To  be  deﬁcient  is  harmful,  as  is  going  to  excess.  Perhaps  it 
is even more harmful. But going to excess is more at fault since it causes 
deﬁciency.  Yes,  excess  opened  the  door  to  indulgence.  For  rotten  things

had  been  mixed  in  with  those  lofty  truths,  so  the  deﬁcient  and  the  unfair 
cavillers unjustly felt disgust at the truths, and, Allah forbid, deemed them 
blemished and worthless. But if one defaced coin is found in a treasury and 
one rotten windfall from elsewhere is spotted in an orchard, is it right and 
fair to assume that the entire treasury is false or all the apples are rotten, and 
so defame them by spurning them?
Conclusion

Conclusion

My aim with this Premise: public opinion wants a [ new ] interpretation 
(   t e f s i r   )  of the Qur’an. In every era one particular thing is dominant; time too 
is an interpreter; situations and circumstances also disclose things. The gen-
erally held ideas of the ulema still educate public opinion. In consequence 
of this and basing my view on it, it is my wish that a Qur’anic commentary 
should be written through consultation, by setting up an assembly of depu-
ties elected from among authoritative scholars, each a specialist in one of 
the physical sciences  (   f e n   ) , under the chairmanship of time, the supreme 
interpreter. They should collect together in this commentary in order to gild 
and emend it, the best points and virtues scattered through other commentar-
ies. Yes, this is the time of constitutionalism; mutual consultation governs 
in everything. Public opinion is the watchman. The validity of the agreed 
opinions among the scholars (   i c m a - ı   ü m m e t   )  is proof of this.

The Fourth Premise

The Fourth Premise

Fame ascribes to man what is not his. It is like this: it is a human charac-
teristic to ascribe something unusual or precious together with similar things 
to the person who gains fame through them in order to draw attention to his 
excellence. In order to gain acceptance for their ideas, or not to have them 
denied, or for some other purpose, people despotically and wrongfully see in 
one person the ideas and virtues of a nation and their results, and they think 
of them as originating from him. He, however, will reject their tyrannical 
gift. For a person who is famous for some ﬁne attribute or elevated art will 
reject something unjustly ascribed to his art-loving view, the mark of which 
is to see beneath the surface, for if it is presented as his own work, it will mar 
the beauty arising from the proportion and balance of his art. He will decline 
it and avoid it, exclaiming: “ Allah forbid! ”

In  consequence  of  this  characteristic  and  in  accordance  with  the  well-
known rule “ If something is established, it is established together with its 
corollaries, ” in order to set in order the things they imagine in the famous 
person,  people  are  obliged  to  ascribe  to  him  extraordinary  attributes  such 

28

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

as  great  power,  eminence,  and  intelligence  so  that  he  can  be  a  source  of 
assistance  for  all  his  followers.  He  is  thus  embodied  in  their  minds  as  a 
marvel. If you like, think of  Rustam Zal’s image, nourished in the Persian 
imagination. See what a marvel he is! Because he became famous for his 
courage, and because the Persians were never ever able to free themselves 
from  oppression  and  despotism,  through  the  power  of  fame  he  grew  and 
grew and plundered all their means of glory. He was aggrandised and ﬁlled 
their imaginations. Then since lies breed lies, extraordinary valour was aug-
mented  by  a  wondrous  life  and  awesome  stature  and  many  other  matters 
that these necessitated. That frightful fantasy cried out: “ The whole race is 
embodied in me! ” Trailing behind him superstitions like an ogre, he is ever 
on people’s tongues.

You who wish to see the naked truth! Pay close attention to this Premise, 
for this is where the door to superstion opens. It is also where the door to ver-
iﬁcation of the truth is blocked up. It is also the salt-marsh where the story’s 
moral is lost, and the attempt to build – thanks to the inclination to progress 
– on the foundations of the earlier scholars (   m ü t e k a d d i m î n   )  is foiled as are 
efforts to work on the legacy of the righteous forefathers  (   s e l e f   ) , and the 
courage  to  do  more  than  this  is  destroyed.  If  you  like,  ask  the  renowned 
Molla Nasreddin Efendi: “ Are all these strange words yours? ” He will of 
course reply: “ If they were, they would ﬁll volumes and need a lifetime at 
that. For not everything I say is a witticism. I’m a teacher. I’d be happy if 
they were to give me the z a k a t  due on them as well. I wouldn’t want more. 
Because my wit would cease being natural and become forced. ” Yes, super-
stitions and customs sprout and grow from this root, choking the power of 
what is right.
Conclusion

Conclusion

Favour  greater  than  divine  favour  is  not  favour.  A  grain  of  truth  is 
preferable to a stack of illusions. It is obligatory to content oneself with 
divine  favour  when  making  ascriptions.  The  member  of  a  community 
should not infringe its regulations. A thing’s honour looks to the thing 
itself, not to its offspring. It is the fruit of a thing that shows its essential 
character. Even if valuable, mixing other property with one’s own makes 
it worthless; it will also lead to its seizure. Now, basing it on these points 
I say the following: it is a serious instance of ignorance to ascribe false 
Hadiths to persons like Ibn ‘Abbas 1 in order to encourage the common

people to do what is right and to deter them from what is wrong. Yes, 
truth  stands  in  need  of  nothing  else,  and  reality  is  rich.  The  Hadiths’ 
lights  are  sufﬁcient  to  illuminate  hearts.  Sound  Hadiths,  the  Qur’an’s 
expounder, sufﬁce us. And we are content with authentic histories which 
have been weighed up on the scales of logic.

The Fifth Premise

The Fifth Premise

If ﬁgures of speech  (   m e c a z   )  fall into the hand of the ignorance from 
that of learning, they are taken literally and open the door to superstition. 
It is like this: whenever the dark left hand of ignorance seizes ﬁgures of 
speech and similes (   t e ş b i h   )  from the luminous right hand of knowledge, 
or when such ﬁgures are long-lived, they acquire a literal meaning and lose 
their freshness and translucence. While being a cordial they turn into vin-
egar, and though once fresh and comely they grow old and withered. Yes, 
it is the transparency of ﬁgurative language that allows the rays of real-
ity to shine out from it. Once it is taken literally, it becomes opaque and 
obscures the original truth. Such a transformation is a natural law. If you 
want evidence for this, refer to the mysteries of the change and renewal of 
words, and their shared and synonymous meanings. If you listen carefully, 
you will hear the following:

Numerous words, tales, fantasies, and meanings which were to the taste 
of the people of early times have become old and vapid. Since they did not 
coincide with the childish caprices of the people of later times, they gave 
rise to the desire for renewal and the idea of invention, and bold desire for 
change. This rule governs in imaginings, meanings, and stories as it does 
in words. In which case, everything should not be judged according to its 
apparent meaning. The mark of the investigative scholar is to be thorough, 
divest himself of the inﬂuences of time, enter the depths of the past, weigh 
up things on the scales of logic, and ﬁnd the source of everything.

What  made  me  aware  of  this  was  an  eclipse  of  the  moon  when  I  was 
young. I asked my mother about it, and she replied: “ A snake has swallowed 
the moon. ” So I asked: “ Why can you still see it? ” So she said: “ The snakes 
in the sky are semi-transparent. ”

See how a simile (   t e ş b i h   )  had become reality and with its interposition, 
obscured the reality. For employing a simile, astronomers called the inter-
sections of the two arcs of the two imaginary circles formed by the moon’s 
orbit and the zodiac, the head and tail of the great serpent. Then when the 

30

moon passes either the head or the tail and the sun passes the other, the moon 
will be eclipsed by the interposition of the earth. 1 

Gentle reader who is not bored with these confused words of mine! Study 
this  Premise  attentively  too.  Scrutinise  it  with  a  microscope.  For  numer-
ous superstitions and contradictions have been born of this stock. Logic and 
rhetoric should be taken as the guide. 
Conclusion

Conclusion

The  true  meaning  should  bear  a  stamp.  What  deﬁnes  the  stamp  is  the 
sheer beauty born of the balance between the aims of the Shari‘a. Figura-
tive language (   m e c a z   )  is permissible if subject to the rules of rhetoric. For 
to look on a rhetorical ﬁgure as reality and reality as ﬁgurative, and to show 
them  thus,  is  to  strengthen  the  despotism  of  ignorance.  However  harmful 
the  tendency  to  be  negligent,  which  continually  understanding  everything 
literally  gave  rise  to  the  misguided  way  of  the  literalists  ( z â h i r i y y û n ;  Ar. 
ẓ ā h i r i y y ū n  ); so love of excess was even more harmful, for continually inter-
preting everything ﬁguratively, it gave rise to the futile school of the esoter-
ists ( b a t ı n ı y y û n ; Ar. b ā ṭ i n i y y ū n  ). It is only the philosophy of the Shari‘a and 
rhetoric, and logic and science   (   h i k m e t   )  that will show the middle way  2 
and confute the two extremes.

I  say  science  (   h i k m e t   ) ,  because  for  the  greater  part  it  is  good.  It  con-
tains evil, but this is minor. It is an incontestable principle that to abandon 
a matter which is mostly good because of some minor evil is to perpetrate a 
greater evil. It is essential to choose the lesser of two evils. Yes, ancient phi-
losophy contained little good, its superstitions were many, [ it led to ] minds 
losing their capacity, to the limiting of ideas due to blind imitation, and to 
ignorance ruling the mass of people. For these reasons later generations pro-
hibited it to an extent. But relatively to ancient philosophy, philosophy now 
[ modern science ] contains much good from the material point of view, its 
lies are few; thought is free and learning predominates. In any event, every 
age has its ethos.

that a person skilful in engineering may be unversed in another profession 
such as medicine. And it is a rule of the science of the principles of reli-
gion that the opinions of a person who is not an authority in jurisprudence 
(   ﬁ q h   )   are  not  held  to  be  valid  by  the  consensus  of  the  scholars  of  that 
science, even if he is a m u j t a h i d  in the principles (   u s û l   )  of ﬁ q h . Because 
compared to them his knowledge is deﬁcient.

Furthermore, it is an historical fact that one person cannot be expert and 
proﬁcient in numerous sciences (   f e n   ) . Only an exceptional person can be a 
specialist in four or ﬁve sciences. To attempt all means abandoning all. Pro-
ﬁciency in a science is that science’s true form. It has to assume its true form 
through it. For if a person is not an expert in one science and does not use the 
rest of his knowledge to complete and supplement it, all the miscellaneous 
things he knows will form an anomalous conglomeration.

A humorous yarn to explain this:
Suppose there is a portraitist who arrives on the earth from another world. 
He has seen the entire ﬁgure of neither man nor beast, so if he wants to draw 
the picture of a man or a ﬁgure out of all the things he has observed; for 
instance, a man out of one hand, one foot, one eye, half a face, a nose, and 
a turban; or an animal made up of various things that strike his eye like a 
horse’s tail, a camel’s hump, a man’s face, and a lion’s head: the people will 
tell him that because of the incompatibility of those things they cannot sup-
port life, and such weird creatures do not meet the conditions of life. They 
will pour scorn on the portraitist.

This  rule  is  exactly  applicable  to  the  modern  sciences.  The  solution  is 
to take one science as one’s main science and to make all the rest of one’s 
knowledge a reservoir and pool for it. 

Also, it is a constant law that if a single book contains numerous sciences 
(   u l û m   ) ,  the  sciences  will  push  and  jostle  each  other.  For  since  they  will 
lead to one another and take each other by the hand, they will embrace and 
answer each other, and will therefore be so interwoven that in comparison 
with the book as a whole, the matters of any one science (   f e n   )  will be neg-
ligible. It is because this question has been disregarded that when a literalist 
or a Sophist sees a matter included parethetically in a work about the Shari‘a 
or a Qur’anic commentary (   t e f s i r   ) , he declares: “ That is the Shari‘a or the 
commentary! ” [ and holds such matters to be fundamental to the work ]. If 
he is friendly, he says: “ The person who doesn’t accept this can’t be Mus-
lim. ” Or if hostile, he makes it a pretext, [ and condemns the work, ] saying: 
“ The Shari‘a or the commentary is wrong. ”

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

O you who goes to one extreme or the other! Qur’anic commentaries and 
the Shari‘a are one thing, and books written about them are something else. 
For books are more extensive. Worthless things may be found in such shops 
besides the jewels. If you’ve grasped this, you’ll be saved from doubts. Just 
as the necessities of a household can’t all be obtained from a single crafts-
man, but each has to be sought from an expert in the craft needed; so too, in 
the palace of civilisational achievements the law in question has to be com-
plied with. Isn’t it clear that if someone asks the tailor to sew up his broken 
watch, he will receive nothing but a blast of invective?
Indication

The  gist  of  this  Premise  is  as  follows:  although  it  is  obligatory  to  act 
in accordance with the law of progress, which has been made operative in 
the world’s creation by the Glorious Maker and issues from the rule of the 
division of labour, and to comply with what it infers, this has not been fully 
observed. It is like this: by virtue of the potentialities and inclinations planted 
in human nature by the gracious hand of divine wisdom – which necessitates 
the division of labour – a sort of command has been given to practise the arts 
and sciences. This is an obligation on a section of the community (   f a r z ü ’ l -
k i f â y e   )  imposed by the Shari‘a of Creation. But we abused this and due to 
our  desire  for  superiority,  which  is  a  false  ambition  and  pure  hypocrisy, 
we extinguished the enthusiasm that would strengthen and assist the incli-
nations born of those potentialities, and wasted it. Certainly the rebellious 
deserve Hell. And we were tormented by the hell of ignorance because we 
did  not  comply  with  the  code  of  natural  laws  (   ş e r i a t - ı   f ı t r i y e   )   known  as 
creation. But if we act in conformity with the law of the division of labour, 
we will be saved from this torment. For our forebears acted in accordance 
with it and entered the paradise of the sciences.
Conclusion

Conclusion

Just as a non-Muslim does not become a Muslim by merely entering a 
mosque; so some matter of a natural science like geography or history does 
not become Shari‘a or Qur’anic commentary by being included in a book of 
the Shari‘a or a commentary. Also, – on condition he is an expert – a ruling 
made by a scholar of the Shari‘a or Qur’anic interpretation, is authoritative 
only in the science concerned. His statements about intrusive matters that 
have  entered  works  of  the  Shari‘a  and  exegesis  (   t e f s i r   )   without  permis-
sion  are  not  authoritative.  For  they  are  probably  just  spongers.  But  those 
who have related them should not be blamed. Yes, if a person whose words 
on one science are authoritative holds his rulings on another science to be 

FIRST ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF REALITY

33

authoritative by moving them from one to the other or just as an assertion, 
it means he is not complying with the divine laws of the division of labour 
and organisation of work.

Also,  it  is  accepted  in  logic  that  the  proposition  necessitates  the  state-
ments of the subject and predicate in only one respect. Others of their state-
ments are not part of that science. They have to be matters of some other 
science. 

It is also established that a general statement cannot express a particular 
one with any of the three signiﬁcations. 1 For example, it is completely illog-
ical to consider deﬁnitive the interpretation of the verse,  ( 18:96 ) ß  Þ 
in the tefsir of B a y ḍ ā w ī , 2 that refers to what lies between the mountains of 
Armenia and Azerbaijan. For basically it is a narration (   n a k i l   ) . Also, what 
it states speciﬁcally is not what the Qur’an indicates; such an interpretation 
cannot be considered exegesis (   t e f s i r   ) , for it is a speciﬁc statement (   t e ş r i h   )  
based on another science about part of the verse. It is unfair, therefore, to 
make such weak points a pretext and raise doubts about the well-grounded 
competence in Qur’anic exegesis of that masterly commentator. The essen-
tial truths of Qur’anic commentaries and the Shari‘a are clear. They shine 
like the stars. Their power and clarity give courage to someone powerless 
like myself. So I claim that however many fundamental truths there are in 
the Shari‘a and in Qur’anic commentaries, if they are studied closely, it will 
be  seen  that  each  one  of  them  emerges  from  reality,  is  weighed  up  with 
wisdom,  and  as  truth  returns  to  truth.  Dubious  points,  whatever  they  are, 
have appeared from prattling minds which have then muddled them. This is 
a challenge to whoever doubts the essential truth of Qur’anic commentaries 
and the Shari‘a! Let him step forward and show himself!

Exaggeration is a revolutionary. It is like this: it is a human character-
istic to mix imagination with truth by tending to excess in what one takes 
pleasure  in,  to  overstate  something  one  describes,  and  to  exaggerate 
something one relates. In consequence, doing good is actually to do evil. 
Although one is not aware of it, deﬁciency arises from the excess, corruption

from reform, disparagement from praise, and ugliness from beautiﬁcation. 
For, ُرُ(cid:151) ْ(cid:131)َ(cid:192)  َ(cid:202)  ُثْ(cid:193)َ(cid:110)  ْنِ(cid:174) mars the beauty arising from the balance and propor-
tion. Just as to increase the dose of a medicine because you deem it salutary 
will make the cure injurious; so to show backbiting to be equal to murder 
or  passing  water  while  standing  to  be  equal  to  adultery  due  to  enjoining 
the good and deterring from evil in exaggerated terms – although the truth 
never needs this, or to hold giving one  d i r h e m  as charity equal to making 
the Hajj, is to take murder and adultery lightly and to devalue the Hajj. In 
consequence, the preacher should speak both wisely and in reasoned man-
ner. Yes, those preachers whose words are unbalanced cause the eclipse of 
many luminous truths of religion. Due to the tendency to exaggerate, it has 
been added to the shining, unanimously related miracle of the splitting of the 
moon that the moon descended to earth, entered the Messenger’s ( UWBP ) 
pocket then emerged from it. This has both made that sun-like miracle as 
faint as the star Suha and eclipsed that moon-like proof of prophethood, and 
opened the door to the deniers’ pretexts.

I n   S h o r t :  Everyone  who  loves  religion  and  is  enamoured  of  the  truth 
should content himself with the worth of things [ as they are ] and not exag-
gerate and go to excess. For to do so is to decry divine power. It is to be dis-
satisﬁed with the perfection and beauty in creation, which caused al-Ghazali 
to declare: “ There could be nothing better in the sphere of contingency than 
what exists,” 1 and to belittle them.

Gentle  reader!  Sometimes  comparisons  (   t e m s i l   )   serve  as  proofs 
(   b ü r h a n   ) . See! Just as the value and properties of diamonds, gold, silver, 
lead, iron, and so on are all different; so the value of the aims of religion 
and their proofs are all different. If the place of one is the imagination, the 
place of another is the conscience, and of yet another the inner heart. If when 
engaged in commerce someone gives a diamond or a piece of gold instead 
of a ﬁsh-scale or ten p a r a , he will be judged incompetent and denied right 
of  disposal;  or  if  the  reverse  is  the  case,  he  will  rightly  be  sent  packing. 
Similarly, those, who lacking discernment, fail to distinguish between the 
truths of religion and do not accord to each the right and respect it deserves; 
who  do  not  recognise  the  stamp  of  the  Shari‘a  on  each  of  its  ordinances, 
and even arrest the motion of the components of that vast factory, each on 
its own axis – they resemble an apprentice who sees a tiny cogwheel in a

phrase is “ There could be nothing more beautiful, perfect, or complete in the sphere of

fact a composite of variations of the phrase in others of al-Ghazali’s works.

huge, smoothly-running machine and because it appears incongruous to his 
superﬁcial view, is deceived by his arrogance although he has no knowledge 
of engineering, and attempts to alter its ﬁne-tuning in order to correct it, so 
overturns the order of the factory and ruins it.

To   C o n c l u d e :  Each  of  the  Shari‘a’s  ordinances  bears  the  Lawgiver’s 
stamp  of  approval.  The  stamp  has  to  be  read.  An  ordinance  is  in  need  of 
nothing to give it value over and above the stamp. And it stands in no need 
whatsoever of the embellishments or interference of the verbose exaggera-
tions of those addicted to excess. Take note! How ugly in the view of truth 
are those exaggerators when they proffer advice. For instance, one of them, 
not being content with the Shari‘a’s method of restraint, said something in 
a large gathering to put people off intoxicants, but I was ashamed to write 
it and crossed it out. You scoundrel, you’re opposing the Shari‘a with these 
words of yours! Supposing you were faithful to it even, you would still be 
foolishly faithful. You’re more harmful than the worst enemy.
Conclusion

Conclusion

O  you  unfair  people  who  try  to  criticise  Islam  from  outside  and  from 
afar!  Don’t  be  deceived!  Think  and  reason!  Don’t  make  do  with  looking 
superﬁcially, for those people who are the cause of these pretexts of yours 
are called “ reprehensible religious scholars ” ( lit. scholars of evil, wicked-
ness  –  u l e m a - i   s û ’  )  in  the  language  of  the  Shari‘a.  Look  beyond  the  veil 
caused by their imbalance and externalist literalness. You’ll see that each 
truth  of  Islam  is  a  light-scattering  proof,  like  a  luminous  star.  It  appears 
within a tapestry stretching from pre-eternity to post-eternity. Indeed, that 
which proceeds from pre-eternal divine speech will go to post-eternity. But 
alas! Due to love of self and taking the part of oneself and exonerating one-
self, which arise from egotism and impotence, they blame their own faults 
on others. They want to exonerate themselves by ascribing something they 
say or do that might possibly be wrong to some lofty person or esteemed 
book, or even sometimes to religion and very often to Hadiths, and ﬁnally to 
divine determining. Allah forbid! Darkness cannot come from light. Even if 
they conceal the stars appearing in their own mirrors, they cannot hide the 
stars in the sky. It’s only themselves who can’t see them!

Kind  sir  who  objects  and  opposes!  It  is  a  great  injustice  to  regard  as 
proofs  doubts  arising  from  misunderstandings  or  attitudes  springing  from 
opposition to the Shari‘a, and to seek pretexts like a child looking for some-
thing to cry about or a rancorous enemy seeking revenge, and so to tarnish 
Islam. For not every attribute a Muslim possesses, has to derive from Islam. 

The Eighth Premise

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

Introduction

The Eighth Premise

Do not be wearied by the lengthy introduction that follows, for its con-
clusion is extremely important. Moreover, it will eliminate despair, which 
annihilates every moral quality, and will revive hope, the leaven of all happi-
ness. It gives the good news that while the past belongs to others, the future 
shall be ours. We are happy at this apportionment. Its subject is this: weigh-
ing up the people of the past and those of the future. Indeed, the alphabet is 
not taught in high schools. Even if the knowledge is essentially the same, the 
way it is taught differs. Yes, the school of the emotions (   m e k t e b - i   h i s s i y a t   )  
called the past is not the same as the school of ideas (   m e d r e s e - i  e f k â r   )  called 
the future.

Firstly, what I mean by the people of the past are the non-Muslims of the 
Middle Ages from before the tenth century ( AD sixteenth century ), and in 
ancient times. As for the Muslim peoples (   m i l l e t - i   I s l a m   ) , for the ﬁrst three 
hundred  years  they  were  eminent  and  superior,  and  in  ﬁve  hundred  years 
reached full development. I call the period from the ﬁfth to the twelfth cen-
turies the past, and the subsequent centuries I call the future. Now, it is well-
known that it is either the reason or the eye that governs in human beings. 
Or to put it another way, it is either thought or emotions; or truth or force; or 
wisdom or imperatives; or either the inclinations of the heart or the leanings 
of the intellect; or either whims or guidance. In consequence, we see that 
with  the  people  of  the  past  their  mostly  uncorrupted  morals  and  unmixed 
emotions predominated and their unenlightened minds caused personalities 
and  conﬂicts  to  gain  the  upperhand.  But  since  the  somewhat  enlightened 
minds of the people of the future have conquered their emotions, which are 
clouded by lust and appetites, and have subjugated them to its command, it 
is certain that the rights of people generally shall rule. Humanity has become 
manifest to a degree, giving the glad tidings that in the cloudless skies of the 
future Islam, which is supreme humanity, will shine over the lands of Asia 
like the sun.

Rancour and hatred reigned over the valleys of the past, together with 
brute force, feelings, and emotion, all of which breed the desire for superior-
ity. Persuasion was sufﬁcient to guide the people of those times. For embel-
lishing and aggrandising what one said to ﬂatter their emotions and touch 
their feelings, or employing drama or powerful eloquence to familiarise it 
to  their  imaginations,  took  the  place  of  proof.  But  to  compare  us  now  to 

FIRST ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF REALITY

37

them means conﬁning us to the corner of those times as though in a military 
retreat. We want proof; we are not deceived by embroidered words.

The source of the steam of the facts of science, which causes the rain to 
fall ceaselessly in the plains of the present and on the mountains of the future, 
is thought, reason, truth, and science (   h i k m e t   ) . One’s assertions, therefore, 
can be proved only by conclusive arguments, and these give rise to the wish 
to search for reality and the love of truth, and preferring the general good 
to one’s own, and the inclination to act humanely. We are the people of the 
present and are destined for the future. Embellishing what is claimed does 
not satisfy our minds; we want proof.

Let’s talk a little about the good things and the bad of the past and future, 
which  resemble  two  kings.  For  the  most  part,  in  the  country  of  the  past 
force, caprice, nature, feelings, and emotions ruled, one of the evils of which 
was that despotism and domination were present in all matters, if only on 
the whole. Hostility towards outlooks other than one’s own was preferred 
to love and partiality for one’s own outlook. While hatred for one person 
was manifested as love for another. And partisanship and ﬁerce support and 
partiality intervened, all of which form obstacles to the discovery of truth.

I n   S h o r t :  Since the above tendencies were various, feelings of partisan-
ship incited differences and revolt by pointing the ﬁnger at everything, and 
the truth ﬂed and was hidden.

Another evil of the emotions’ despotism was that it was mostly bigotry 
or accusing others of error or sophistry that led to the founding of schools 
of thought and law and ways (   m e s â l i k   v e   m e z â h i b   ) . Whereas all three are 
reprehensible  in  the  view  of  the  Shari‘a,  and  opposed  to  Islamic  brother-
hood and human relations and natural mutual assistance. It reached such a 
pitch that if a person was to give up his bigotry and false stand, as though 
afﬁrming the people’s consensus and unanimity he would have to change 
his school and outlook altogether. Whereas if he was to take truth instead 
of bigotry, and proof instead of sophistry, and adaptability, conformability, 
and mutual consultation instead of accusing others of error, the whole world 
even could not make him change his true school and way, even if it were to 
unite against him. Similarly to the time of the Prophet ( UWBP ) and right-
eous ﬁrst generations of Islam, doubt and scepticism were of little conse-
quence since truth, proof, reason, and consultation prevailed.

Similarly, we see that thanks to science, at the present time for the most 
part truth governs in place of force, proof instead of sophistry, reason instead 
of  instinct,  guidance  instead  of  caprice,  steadfastness  in  place  of  bigotry, 

38

zeal instead of malice, the propensities of the intellect rather than the desires 
of the soul, and thought rather than emotion. In the future this will be the 
case completely, Allah willing, as it was in the ﬁrst, second, and third centu-
ries of Islam, and was mostly so until the ﬁfth. From the ﬁfth centuries down 
to the present force overcame right. 

It is one of the beneﬁcial works of the rule of ideas that the sun of Islam 
has been saved from the clouds of misapprehensions and imaginings, and 
has started to illuminate everywhere. Even those rotting in the bog of irreli-
gion have begun to proﬁt from its light. Moreover, it is one of the advantages 
of  the  consultation  of  ideas  that  aims  and  outlooks  are  being  founded  on 
certain proofs and are being bound to ﬁxed truths and right, which extend to 
every attainment. In consequence, falsehood will be unable to deceive minds 
by assuming the garb of truth.

Brother  Muslims!  With  the  tongue  of  disposition  the  present  hails  us

eternal justice, will rule time and the natural dispositions of men until the 
onset of doomsday, for it is what is called supreme humanity. What is called 
lesser  humanity,  that  is,  the  virtues  of  civilisation,  is  its  precursor.  Has  it 
not  become  apparent  that  with  minds  being  illuminated  through  meeting 
with other minds, the misapprehensions and delusions, resembling soil, have 
lifted  from  the  shoulders  of  the  truths  of  Islam.  This  indicates  that  those 
truths, which are the stars of the skies of guidance, will be disclosed com-
pletely and will shine and shimmer.

truths in relation to the expansion of minds, is it’s being founded on reality, 
girded with proof, consulting with reason, being seated on the throne of truth, 
and its conformity with the principles of wisdom that continue in sequence 
from pre-eternity to post-eternity. It is seen, is it not, that the beginnings and 
ends of the Qur’an’s verses enjoin human beings to refer to their consciences 
and to consult with their reasons. Its verses say:

The Ninth Premise

The Ninth Premise

It is most deﬁnitely true according to those of sound mind that good is 
essential to creation and evil is secondary. Good is universal and evil par-
ticular. It appears that a science has been formed about every realm of being 
( lit. species – n e v ‘  ) and is being formed. The sciences consist of universal 
laws. The universality of the laws disclose the ﬁne order in the ﬁeld con-
cerned. That is to say, each science is a faithful witness to the ﬁne order. 
Yes, universality points to order. For if there is no order in a thing, the rule 
cannot be in force universally; it will be all awry with numerous exceptions. 
It is inductive reasoning and the teleological view (   n a z a r - i   h i k m e t   )  that pro-
nounces those witnesses acceptable. But sometimes the order is not visible, 
for it extends farther than can be envisaged and cannot be completely com-
prehended and conceived of. So the incomparable picture of the order does 
not reveal itself. In consequence, it is established by the testimony of all the 
sciences and afﬁrmed by inductive reasoning, which is born of the view of 
wisdom, that it is good, beauty, truth, and perfection that are intended in the 
creation of the world and that predominate absolutely. As for evil, ugliness, 
and  futility,  they  are  secondary,  subordinate,  and  overwhelmed.  If  some-
times they transgress, they do so temporarily.

It  is  also  established  that  the  noblest  of  creation  is  humankind.  Man’s 
inborn disposition and art testiﬁes to this. And the best of humankind are 
true Muslims, who are the people of truth and reality. Just as the truths of 
Islam are witness to this, so will the events of the future bear witness to it. 

40

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

It is also established that the most perfect in every way was Muhammad 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), as is testiﬁed to by his miracles and 
excellent morals, and is afﬁrmed by the authoritative scholars (   m u h a k k i k î n   )  
among  humankind.  His  enemies  even  had  to  admit  to  this  truth,  and  are 
compelled to do so.

At one time it was thus. I wonder, will mankind despite its wretchedness 
be able to refute the testimony of the sciences, and annul and invalidate the 
inductive reasoning, and obstinately oppose divine will? No! They are not 
able and will not be able. I swear by the names Merciful and Compassion-
ate of the Absolutely All-Wise and Just One that humankind will not easily 
be able to swallow and digest evil, ugliness, and futility. In any case, divine 
wisdom would not permit it.

Indeed, the person who transgresses the general rights of beings is not 
forgiven. Thousands of years during which evil predominates will result in 
at least a thousand years of its total defeat in this world alone, and in the 
next world, good will sentence evil to eternal extinction. Otherwise all the 
orderly, perfect species and sorts of beings in the world, which comply with 
the divine commands, will not agree to having wretched, disorderly human-
kind amongst them, and will request that human beings are denied the rights 
of  existence,  are  banished  to  the  dark  abode  of  non-being,  and  dismissed 
from  the  duties  of  creation.  This  would  necessitate  the  futility  and  mean-
inglessness of all the human potentialities, and all the abilities and talents 
with which human beings have been decked out in order to hold sway over 
this world and experience everlasting bliss in the next. Futility is contrary 
to inductive reasoning, just as it is at variance with the All-Wise Maker’s 
wisdom and opposed to the Truthful Prophet’s ( UWBP ) word. 

The future will reﬁne a part of these assertions, but complete clariﬁcation 
will be in the hereafter. It is as follows: not taking into account individual 
persons, it is in the future that general, universal good will preponderate. If 
we die, our nation will live. We will not accept forty years, we want at least 
a thousand years’ supremacy. However, the supreme tribunal and place of 
ascendancy of beauty, truth, good, and perfection, which are both personal 
and general, and particular and universal, is the hereafter, where humankind 
will be set in order like the rest of its brothers, the orderly universe, and will 
receive reward and punishment commensurate with its innate capabilities. 
For it is there that truth and absolute justice will be manifested.

This narrow world is not suitable for the sprouting of the unlimited abil-
ities  lodged  in  man’s  essential  being,  and  of  his  desires  and  inclinations,

which are created for eternity. He will be sent to another world where they 
may be nourished and trained. Man’s essential being is great, his nature is 
lofty, his crimes too are vast. His order is important, he does not resemble 
other beings; he cannot exist without order. Yes, one destined for eternity is 
great; he cannot be meaningless, he cannot be futile. He cannot be doomed 
to absolute oblivion. He cannot escape to pure non-being. Hell has opened 
its jaws and Paradise has thrown wide its sweet arms. Both are awaiting him.

Conclusion

Conclusion

From afar, Islam’s future and that of Asia appear to be brilliant, for four 
or ﬁve irresistible strengths have united allowing the supremacy of Islam, 
which is the ﬁrst ruler of Asia and its last.

F i r s t   S t r e n g t h :  Islam’s true strength, which is its being decked out with 

civilisation and the teaching of knowledge. 

T h e   S e c o n d :  Severe need, which is equipped with the perfecting of ways 

and means. 

T h e   T h i r d :  Envy, competition, and hidden rancour, which are equipped 
by a total awakening resulting from seeing the utter deprivation of Asia and 
the afﬂuence of other places.

T h e   F o u r t h :  Its innate disposition, which is equipped with the rule of the 
afﬁrmers of divine unity – unity of word; the characteristic of the place – 
moderation and a balanced temperament; the light of the times – the enlight-
enment  of  minds;  the  law  of  civilisation  –  the  conjunction  of  ideas;  the 
inherent quality of a primitive way of life – unspoilt natures; and the fruits 
of exigency – bold enterprise and unencumberedness.

T h e   F i f t h :  The longing for civilisation and desire for renewal, which are 
equipped with the upholding of the Word of Allah. This, at the present time, 
is contingent on material progress, and on hope, which has sprung to life 
at Islam’s command at the death of despair, the annihilator of every desire, 
and is demanded by the times and necessitated by our intense poverty. The 
above strengths will also be assisted by the evils of civilisation overcoming 
its virtues and causing decline and revolution among the Europeans, and by 
their human labour and effort being unequal to vice and dissipation. There 
are two reasons for this:

T h e   F i r s t :   Permissiveness  and  leniency  towards  the  lusts  of  the  soul, 
which result from failing to make religion and virtue the bases of civilisa-
tion. 

42

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

T h e   S e c o n d :  The appalling inequality in livelihoods, which arises from 
a lack of compassion, which in turn results from pandering to the appetites 
and  impiety.  Yes,  impiety  has  become  interlarded  with  the  inner  face  of 
European civilisation to such an extent that it has given birth to numbers of 
revolutionary and seditious groups. If recourse is not had to the ﬁrm rope of 
Islam and the truth of the Illustrious Shari‘a, which resembles the barrier of 
Dhu’l- Qarnayn, those forces of corruption will overturn the world of their 
civilisation, just as they are now threating to do so.

If z a k a t , the puriﬁcation tax, which is only one of the thousands of mat-
ters of the reality of Islam (   h a k i k a t - i   İ s l â m i y e   ) , were to be taken as a basic 
principle of civilisation, for its assistance, would it not be the healing rem-
edy for the calamity and snakes’ lair of this appalling inequality in incomes? 
It would indeed the most effective and incorruptible cure.

I f   i t   i s   a s k e d :  Why shouldn’t whatever made Europe dominant up to the 

present continue to ensure its dominance?

T h e   A n s w e r :  Study the introduction to this book, then study the follow-
ing attentively: the causes of their progress were the cold climates of their 
countries, which make people slow to act and be unprecipitant and constant; 
the smallness of those lands; the idea of education and desire for crafts and 
industry, arising from their numerous inhabitants; and the co-operation and 
mutual assistance allowed by the seas, mines, and other means of develop-
ment. But now just as with the development of means of transport the world 
has become like a single town; so with such means of communication as the 
press and telegraph, the world’s people have become like the members of a 
council. In short: because their loads are heavy and ours are light, we shall 
catch up with them and overtake them – if we are accompanied by divine 
assistance. 1 
Conclusion of the Conclusion

Conclusion of the Conclusion

It is only constitutional government and liberty that will disclose the good 
fortune of Asia and reveal the prospects of Islam. But only on condition the 
Illustrious Shari‘a is adhered to. 

R e m i n d e r :  The matters known as the virtues of civilisation are each ordi-

nances of the Shari‘a put in another form. 

1. NOTE: Fellow Nur students! The Party of the Qur’an that our beloved Master was 
addressing at that time has emerged today as the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students. Take careful note, 
for these pages address us. You must make science and civilisation serve Islam and pro-
claim Islamic civilisation to the world.

A speaker should not be blamed for what springs to other people’s minds 
from what he says. For it is only by an act of will that he takes on himself 
meanings  other  than  what  he  intends  from  his  speech.  If  he  has  no  such 
intention, he should not be blamed. But he is deﬁnitely responsible for what 
is intended and meant. It is established by the science of ﬁgurative speech 
( f e n n - i   b e y a n ;  Ar.  ‘ i l m   a l - b a y ā n  )  that  true  and  false  follow  on  from  the 
intention  and  aim  of  the  speaker.  Hence,  blame  and  criticism  levelled  at 
what  is  intended  and  aimed  at  in  speech  looks  to  the  speaker.  However, 
any faults ascribed to the allusions and hints termed associative meanings 
(   m ü s t e t b e â t   ) , and to depictions of the meanings and the manner of expres-
sion, and the literary style and means called the primary meanings (   m a â n î - i  
û l â   ) ,  and  the  censure  directed  at  them,  look  to  customary  usage  and  col-
loquial speech not to the speaker. For common usages and generally under-
stood meanings are respected so as to facilitate understanding. Moreover, if 
the speech is a story, any faults or errors look to what is being related; the 
speaker certainly should not be blamed for any literary devices or allusive 
meanings. For his intention is not to grasp them and seize their fruits, but 
to  climb  up  to  the  branches  of  the  higher  aims.  If  you  wish,  take  note  of 
the  following  metonymical  things.  For  example,  “ So-and-so’s  sword-belt 
is long ” and “ he has lots of ashes. ” If someone says this, meaning that the 
man is tall and generous, it is true even if he has no sword or ashes. If you 
wish take note now of allegory and parables: you will see that by virtue of 
the value and power gained from fame, they become worthy of being ambas-
sadors between people’s minds and in the exchange of ideas. In fact, even 
such veracious authors and exacting sages as the author of the M a t h n a w ī  1 
and Sa‘di Shirazi 2 were never contested because they used parables. If the 
meaning of this is now clear to you and has been lit up, light your candle 
from it and betake yourself to the nooks of stories and tales. For what is valid 
in the part may sometimes be valid in the whole.

going to mention it very brieﬂy here. It is like this: the main purpose of the 
Wise Book is the guidance of the mass of people, who form the majority. For 
the elite can proﬁt from the common people’s way, but the common people 
cannot properly understand a discussion addressed to the elite. The greater 
part of the mass of people are uneducated (   a v a m   ) , and the uneducated can-
not  disengage  themselves  from  their  imaginings  and  their  habitual  modes 
of thought and see the naked, unadorned truth or purely abstract ideas. To 
allow them to see them, abstract ideas have to be presented in a dress famil-
iar to them, in order to accustom their minds to them. They then may see and 
understand  the  abstract  ideas  by  beholding  them  beyond  those  imaginary 
forms.  In  which  case,  pure  truth  will  be  clothed  in  something  familiar  to 
them. But attention should not be fastened on the form or style. It is because 
of this that included in the styles of Arabic used in the Qur’an of MiracuI-
ous Exposition is ‘divine condescension to the minds of men’ in considera-
tion of people’s understanding and as a concession made to their intelligen-

Conclusion

Conclusion

The  difﬁculty  or  obscurity  of  speech  arises  either  from  the  muddled 
words and style – and there is nothing of this in the Qur’an of Clear Exposi-
tion – or because the meaning is subtle and profound, or of high value, or 
unfamiliar or rare; it as though acts coyly before the understanding, and in 
order to excite its appetite hides itself so as to accord itself value and impor-
tance. The obscurities of the Qur’an are of this sort.
Reminder

As in Hadiths, all the verses of the Qur’an have an inward ( b a t ı n ; Ar. 
b ā ṭ i n  ) and an outward ( z a h i r ; Ar. ẓ ā h i r  ) meaning; and each of those have 
a  moral  ( h a d ;  Ar.  ḥ a d d  )  and  an  anagogical  or  mystical  meaning  ( m u t -
t a l a ’ ; Ar. m a ṭ l a ‘  or m u ṭ ṭ a l a ‘  ); 1 and each of those have numerous branches 
and boughs. The Islamic sciences testify to this. Each of these levels has a 
degree, a value, a station, and these have to be distinguished between. They 
do not, however, impinge on each other. But complications lead to doubt. 
If  the  sphere  of  causes  (   d â i r e - i   e s b a b   )   is  confused  with  that  of  beliefs

(   d â i r e - i   a k â i d   ) , it leads to laziness under the name of reliance on Allah, or 
to joining the Mu‘tazilites (   i ‘ t i z a l   )  and calling it having recourse to causes; 
if  those  spheres  and  degrees  are  not  differentiated,  it  produces  the  results 
described.

Numerous injunctions may be contained in a single discourse. A single 
shell  may  contain  numerous  pearls.  It  is  accepted  by  men  of  understand-
ing that a single premise comprises numerous premises; each emerges from 
a  different  source,  just  as  each  produces  different  friuts.  The  person  who 
does not differentiate between them will remain unaware of the truth. For 
example, it says in a Hadith: ﯗﮑْ(cid:192)َذ ٰ(cid:183)ﯬﯦ ُةَ(cid:150)ا َ
ّ(cid:127)(cid:170)اَو اَ(cid:178)َا “ I and the Last Hour are 
as [ close as ] these two [ ﬁngers. ] ” 1 That is, there will be no Messenger to 
intervene between us. Or, whatever it means, it is right. Now, this Hadith 
comprises three propositions: 

T h e   F i r s t :  It was spoken by Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ). This proposi-
tion results from there being a consensus among witnesses of it (   t e v a t ü r   ) , if 
there was such a consensus. 

T h e   S e c o n d :   The  meaning  intended  by  the  statement  is  true  and  right. 
This proposition results from the proof born of miracles. Both these have 
to be agreed to. And if a person denies the ﬁrst, he is arrogant, while if he 
denies the second, he falls into misguidance and darkness. 

T h e   T h i r d :  This is what is intended by the statement and this is the jewel 
found in the shell; I am showing it. The proposition is this: it is the result of 
an independent judgement, not wishful thinking. In any event, someone who 
makes such judgements is not obliged to follow the judgements of others like 
himself. This proposition has been the cause of ﬁerce dispute. All the gossip 
about it testiﬁes to this. If it proceeds from an independent judgement, the 
person who denies it is neither ignorant, nor does he fall into disbelief. For a 
general matter is not extinguished when one particular thing is extinguished. 
In consequence, all houses should be entered by their own doors since each 
has its own door and each lock has its own key.
Conclusion

Conclusion

These three propositions are relevant to verses of the Qur’an just as they 
are relevant to Hadiths. For they are general. However, there is a subtle dif-
ference in the ﬁrst one. And besides this, any statement comprises numerous

implied  matters.  But  these  are  particular;  they  may  each  have  different 
sources and fruits. 
Reminder

Due  to  such  ignominious  and  contemptible  qualities  as  supporting  the 
opposition,  cold  bigotry,  one-upmanship,  partisanship,  self-justiﬁcation 
through  falsely  ascribing  misapprehensions  to  facts,  seeing  weak  things 
as strong since they are tally with one’s wishes, showing off one’s perfec-
tions by belittling others, and advertising one’s own honesty by declaring 
others liars or misguided – due to these, all of which arise from self-love, 
numerous fallacious arguments may be advanced in matters such as these, 
and pretexts found.

The Twelfth Premise

One who does not ﬁnd the kernel will busy himself with the shell. One 
who does not recognize the truth, will deviate into fancies. One who cannot 
see the mean ( lit. straight path – s ı r a t - ı   m ü s t a k î m  ), will go to one extreme 
or  the  other.  The  unbalanced,  unstable  person  will  often  deceive  and  be 
deceived. Something that deceives the literalists is confusion about the rela-
tionship between the tale and its moral, and the association in the mind of 
the premise and what is intended, and its association in external existence 
and what is intended. Take note of this point, because you will need it later.
Furthermore, something, and perhaps the foremost thing, that gives rise 
to confusion and is a cause of conﬂict, creates superstitions, and gives rise 
to  exaggeration  is  dissatisfaction  with  the  beauty,  grandeur,  and  loftiness 
of creation. Allah forbid, this is to decry its order out of vicious pleasure. 
Whereas the beauty of the order, and the perfection and loftiness of the truths 
of the world – each of which in the view of reason and wisdom is a clear mir-
acle of power – have been so embroidered by the hand of wisdom that if they 
were to be compared with all the past amazing beauty and perfection of all 
the fanciful and the exaggerators, it would show those wondrous delusions 
to be utterly commonplace and those divine practices to be utterly beautiful 
and full of majesty. But familiarity, the sister of compounded ignorance and 
mother of superﬁciality, have closed the eyes of those exaggerators. It is to 
open such eyes that the Wise Book commands that attention be directed to 
the outside world and to the self, both of which are familiar. Yes, it is only 
the  stars  of  the  Qur’an  that  will  open  eyes.  They  are  stars  so  bright  they 
both disperse the darkness of ignorance and the dimness of superﬁciality; 

ٰ
FIRST ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF REALITY

47

and with their perspicuousness, they rend the veils of familiarity and super-
ﬁciality and rip up the masks of the literalists, and direct them towards the 
truths of the world and of the self and offer them guidance.

Furthermore, what gives rise to the tendency to exaggerate is man’s innate 
propensity to actualise the potential. For one of his predilections is to see and 
display unusual things that arouse wonder, and to renew and innovate. In 
consequence, since due to his superﬁcial view man does not appreciate the 
spiritual sustenance in the dishes of the universe beneath the lid of familiar-
ity, he becomes weary at licking the dish and the lid; and since it produces 
nothing but dissatisfaction and desire for the extraordinary and appetite for 
fancies, the desire for the extraordinary gives rise to the tendency to exag-
gerate,  to  effect  renewal  and  to  give  it  currency.  Then  the  exaggeration, 
like a snowball at the top of a mountain, rolling down from the summit of 
the imagination to the tongue, then rolls along from tongue to tongue, both 
scatters pieces of its own truth to left and right, and grows like an avalanche 
as numerous fanciful notions increase its size from every tongue due to the 
tendency to exaggerate. Then it does not ﬁt in the heart, or in the ear, or even 
in the imagination. Eventually the eye of truth comes, and divesting it of the 
conglomeration of all its accretions, shows it for what it is. The meaning of 
“ the truth comes and falsehood perishes ” is made manifest.

I   n      S   h   o   r   t : A recent happening may be related here by way of exam-
ple: I do not say this out of pride, but ever since my youth, essentially my 
way has been to cleanse the truths of Islam of the stains made by those who 
go to one extreme or the other and to polish up those diamond-like truths. 
Numerous events in my life testify to this. In connection with this, recently 
I mentioned the sphericity of the earth, a self-evident matter, and some rel-
evant  religious  matters,  and  I  applied  and  adapted  them  and  thus  refuted 
the  objections  of  enemies  and  the  doubts  of  those  who  love  religion.  But 
then it seemed that since the brains of the literalists are accustomed to such 
make-belief things as ghouls, they would not accept it. But the true reason 
must have been something else. They acted idiotically as though by shutting 
their eyes they could make it nighttime, or by pufﬁng they could extinguish 
the sun. They suppose that by accepting the sphericity of the earth, one is 
opposing numerous questions of religion. Making it a pretext they uttered 
serious  calumnies.  And  it  did  not  remain  at  that:  suspicious  minds  found 
grounds suitable for the spread of the slander, and so increased it they caused 
extreme distress to the religiously minded and made the patriotic despair of 
Islam’s progress. But it provided an exemplary lesson. It awakened me to 

48

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

the fact that an ignorant friend can cause as much harm as an enemy. Until 
now, I considered only the enemy’s side and smashed their excesses with 
the diamond sword I was wielding. But now I shall have to poke gently with 
the sword at those friends’ vulgar and excessive imaginings in order to edu-
cate them. For sure, one should not have to mention such personal things in 
discussions of this sort, but it is no longer personal; it has become a general 
matter concerning the life of the medreses. The literalists should know cer-
tainly that their efforts are futile. They have kept us ignorant uptil now with 
their banal sophistries, and want in the future to take advantage of our igno-
rance. But it is not to be! The medreses will spring to life, and that’s that!

Also,  what  confuses  the  literalists’  ideas  and  spoils  the  order  of  their 
imaginings  is  their  believing  that  the  evidences  of  the  prophets’  veracity 
are limited to marvels  (   h a r i k u l â d e l e r   ) , as well as their supposing that all 
or most of our Prophet’s ( UWBP ) acts have to be wondrous. But existence 
does  not  allow  this,  so  their  fancies  remain  disordered.  For  such  a  belief 
arises from disregarding the mystery of divine wisdom and the divine laws 
in force in the creation of the world, and the prophets submitting to these 
and complying with them; it results from a serious disregard of the truth. 
Yes, although all the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) actions and behaviour indicate his 
veracity  and  testify  that  he  adhered  to  the  truth,  he  still  submitted  to  and 
followed those divine laws. Attention is drawn to this in the Third Article.

Marvels  (   h a r i k u l â d e   )   are  displayed  in  order  to  verify  prophethood. 
Such veriﬁcation may be obtained by their miracles (   m u ’ c i z e   )  being in the 
best possible form. If the miracles are more wondrous than they need to be, 
they would be either futile or opposed to the mystery of man’s account-
ability  –  for  accountability  is  a  test  or  trial  about  something  theoretical 
(   n a z a r î   ) .  The  most  inferior  and  most  superior  may  be  equal  in  things 
that are obvious or nearly obvious – or they would be opposed to submis-
sion to the inner workings of wisdom in things and compliance with them. 
Whereas  more  than  everyone,  the  prophets  were  charged  with  servitude 
and submission to Allah Almighty.

O searcher after truth who is scrutinising these disorderly words of mine! 
The proclivities planted in your nature will sprout and grow with the light 
of the sun of truth, which travels despite being stationary, and will produce 
ﬂowers.

Both those sayyids who deny being sayyids, and non-sayyids who claim

is proscribed to either add to the Qur’an or miss something out from it. To 
add to it is more harmful since it spoils the order and opens the door to base-
less ideas. To miss any part out arises from ignorance and may therefore be 
forgiven to an extent. But adding to it needs knowledge, and a knowledge-
able person is not to be excused. Similarly it is not permissible to eliminate 
anything from religion or to join something alien to it. To include the base 
metal of stories and the refuse of i s r a i l i y y a t  and misleading similes among 
the diamonds of the tenets of belief, the jewels of the Shari ‘a, and the pearls 
of its injunctions, reduces their value to an even greater degree and disgusts 
their customers, the seekers after truth, even more.
Conclusion of the Conclusion

Conclusion of the Conclusion

It is a serious act of non-compliance with the Shari‘a of Creation for a 
person to give up what he has a propensity for and to attempt something for 
which he has no ability. For the mark [ of those laws ] is for the man’s poten-
tialities to enter into and expand within his craft, and to esteem and love it, 
and to comply with and follow its rules; in short, to become engrossed in his 
craft. While his duty towards creation is this, by failing to comply, he alters 
the true form of the craft and infringes its laws. And because his inclination 
is towards the craft for which he has an innate capacity, he makes disagree-
able  the  form  of  the  craft  he  attempts  in  contravention  of  his  nature.  For 
confusion is born of the incompatibility of the propensity, which is potential, 
and the actual craft. In consequence, because out of their tendency to domi-
neer and control and desire to be superior, numerous people want to assume 
positions  of  domination,  they  give  up  offering  encouragement,  guidance, 
and  advice,  and  being  gracious,  which  are  the  marks  of  knowledge,  and 
they use their despotic, superior positions as means of compulsion and harsh 
censure and castigation. They exploit knowledge instead of serving it. The 
duties of teaching have thus passed into the hands of the incompetent, and 
the medreses in particular have headed for ruin. The sole solution for this is 
for the instructors, who form a single faculty, to be reorganized into numer-
ous faculties like a university. Then everyone, impelled by their humanity 
and claiming their rights, will follow their natures and obey the command of 
pre-eternal wisdom, and put into practice the rule of the division of labour. 
Reminder

One  of  the  main  reasons  for  the  decline  of  the  medrese  sciences  and 
their  being  diverted  from  their  natural  channel  was  the  instrumental  sci-
ences  (   ‘ u l û m - u   â l i y e   )  being given priority over the fundamental sciences 
(   ‘ u l û m - u   ‘ â l i y e   ) .  Just  as  the  latter  were  neglected,  so  brains  were  busied

with deciphering Arabic phraseology; the main sciences became subsidiary, 
and those profusely wordy works that were made the ofﬁcial syllabus took 
everyone’s time and attention, and allowed them no opportunity to escape.

Scrupulous brother! I reckon you want to know now what the three books 
1 consist of, according to which these Premises are set out. Bide in patience 
a while longer, for now I’m going to tell you about a subject that forms a 
consise summary of those books, or is a photograph or an abbreviated chart. 
I am also going to present to you hastily eight or nine matters from those 
books.  I  have  the  idea  to  discuss  them  in  detail  after  the  Third  Article,  if 
divine will sees ﬁt and I am visited with divine assistance. The subject is 
this: I’m going to rise to the sciences (   u l û m   )  of the heavens on a journey of 
the spirit directly through the power of science (   h i k m e t   )  by means shown 
by the Qur’an. From there we shall gaze down on the earth and see that it 
revolves like a ball or top, or a pebble ﬂung by the All-Wise Maker’s hand 
of power and is spinning. With the eye of wisdom we shall see that breaking 
into pieces it will be transformed into something better. Descending from 
the heavens, we shall pass through the atmosphere and gradually descend to 
the earth, our cradle, which the Merciful Creator has laid out and prepared 
for the ease and comfort of humankind. We shall then observe attentively 
how  humankind  throws  away  its  cradle  on  emerging  from  childhood  and 
destroys  it,  and  is  sent  to  the  everlasting  palace  of  bliss.  Having  watched 
this in its entirety, we shall embark on a journey of the spirit, which is unre-
stricted by time and space, to the past and with the electric current of history 
shall there exchange news with its people. We shall learn of events in that 
dusky eventide, and build a railway with its ideas. Then turning towards the 
morningtide of the future, we shall visit and welcome our fellow humans, 
who are on the point of departure, and view and point out from afar the true 
dawn of happiness. Boarding the train of progress and ship of endeavour, 
and holding up the lamp of proof, we shall enter upon those times, which 
although  their  beginnings  appear  dark,  are  bright  indeed.  There  we  shall 
embrace the people of the future, and congratulate them on their achieve-
ment and happiness.

Brother! Before taking you by the hand and leading you to the treasury of 
truths, I am going to dispel the fancies that veil the eye of your discernment 
and quickly mention the several matters I mentioned. The fancies are such 
that with their hands they blind your eyes like ghouls, beat you on the chest, 
and terrify you. If they show you anything at all, they make light appear as 
ﬁre and pearls as clods. Beware of those imaginings! The most important 
source of the satanic whisperings that afﬂict you are several matters related 
to the sphericity of the earth. For instance, the ox and ﬁsh; Qaf mountain; the 
barrier of Dhu’l-Qarnayn; the mountains acting as pegs; and Hell as being as 
being speciﬁcally located beneath the earth; and such matters as  ( 79:30 ) n 
( 88:20 ) ® ; ( 36:38 ) ¶       μ  ´  ³ ; and

reality in order to close up the eyes of the enemies of religion and open the 
eyes of its friends. I am commencing:The First Matter

  .  I  shall  explain  what  they  mean  in 

The First Matter

Your fair mind knows that the investigative scholars of Islam have agreed 
on the sphericity of the earth, if only tacitly. If you have any doubts, go to 
the  M a q ā ṣ i d   and  M a w ā q i f ,  study  them  and  become  acquainted  with  their 
purpose, and you will see that Sa‘d 1 and the Sayyid 2 hold the globe in their 
hands like a ball and are looking at every side of it.

If  that  door  does  not  open  to  you,  enter  upon  Imam  Razi’s  extensive 
commentary,  M a f ā t i ḥ   a l - G h a y b ,  3  and  join  his  study  circle  as  he  teaches, 
and listen to him. 

1. Sa‘d al-Dīn al-Taftazānī ( d. 793/1390 ). Renowned scholar of grammar, rhetoric, 
k a l ā m ,   ﬁ q h ,  and t a f s i r . Among his many works is his own commentary on his k a l ā m  work, 
a l - M a q ā ṣ i d , called, S h a r ḥ   a l - M a q ā ṣ i d . Which of the two is referred to here is uncertain, 
probably the latter. He was born in Khurasan and died in Samarqand.

2. Abū  al-Ḥasan  ‘Alī  ibn  Muḥammad  al-Sayyid  al-Sharīf  al-Jurjānī  ( d.  816/1413 ). 
Born near Astarabad and died in Shiraz. An authority in the sciences Arabic, k a l ā m , and 
ﬁ q h . The work referred to here is his famous commentary on ‘Aḍud al-Dīn al-Ījī’s k a l ā m  
manual, a l - M a w ā q i f . al-Jurjānī’s work, S h a r ḥ   a l - M a w ā q i f , was a standard medrese text. 
For the earth’s sphericity, see. S h a r ḥ   a l - M a w ā q i f  ( Beirut: 1433/2012 ), vii, 145-7.

3. Abū ‘Abd Allāh Muḥammad b. ‘Umar Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī ( d. 606/1209 ). One of 
the most celebrated theologians and exegetists of Islam. His numerous works are mostly 
concerned with k a l ā m , philosophy, and Qur’anic exegesis, his most famous work of ex-
egesis being a l - Ta f s ī r   a l - K a b ī r  otherwise known as M a f ā t ī ḥ   a l - G h a y b . He as born in Rayy 
and died at Herat. For the earth’s sphericity, see for example, a l - Ta f s ī r   a l - K a b ī r  ( Beirut:

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

If  you  are  not  assured  by  him  and  you  still  have  not  grasped  the  idea 
of sphericity, follow İbrahim Hakkı,  1 approach Imam Ghazali, the Hujjat 
al-Islam,  2  and  request  a  f a t w a .  Ask  him  if  there  is  any  dispute  over  the 
earth’s sphericity, he is bound to reply: “ If you don’t accept it, there’ll be 
a dispute! ” For even at that time he issued such a f a t w a : “ If anyone denies 
a deﬁnitely proven and established matter like the earth’s sphericity on the 
pretext  of  defending  religion,  he  perpetrates  a  serious  crime.  To  do  so  is 
betrayal of religion, not loyalty towards it. ” 

If you are illiterate and can’t read his f a t w a , listen to what Husayn Jisr 3 
has to say, since he is our contemporary and holds similar ideas to us. For he 
both loudly threatened those who deny that the earth is round, and with the 
power of truth declared fearlessly: “ Whoever denies the earth’s sphericity 
citing religion and to defend it is a foolish friend and more harmful than a 
ﬁerce enemy. ”

If  his  resounding  voice  does  not  rouse  your  idea  of  the  truth  from  its 
slumbers and your eyes do not open, take the hand of people like Ibn Humam 
4 and Fakhr al-Islam. 5 Go to Imam Shaﬁ‘i 6 and ask for a f a t w a . Ask him:

“ It is included in the Shari‘a that all ﬁve of the daily ṣ a l ā t  may be per-
formed in a single period between two of the ṣ a l ā t . Moreover, there is a peo-
ple for whom there are times they cannot perform the ‘ I s h ā ’  ṣ a l ā t , and there 
is another people for whom the sun never sets for days and for many nights 
the sun never rises, so how can they perform the fast? ” And ask that since

according to the Shari‘a a matter is stipulated in accordance with its connec-
tion (   m u k â r i n   )  with other principal matters, how should the direction of the 
q i b l a  be ﬁxed, which is obligatory for the ṣ a l ā t ? For there is a connection 
(   m u k â r e n e t   )  only in those parts of the ṣ a l ā t  performed while standing and 
half-sitting?

You  may  be  certain  that  Imam  Shaﬁ‘i  would  solve  the  ﬁrst  matter  by 
depicting a curved sphere stretching from east to west, while the second and 
third matters he would solve by describing a curve stretching from south to 
north.  He  would  reply  as  though  with  a  rational  demonstration  (   b ü r h a n - ı  
a k l î   ) . Concerning the  q i b l a  he would say that the  q i b l a  and Ka‘ba form a 
column of light so luminous it fastens the heavens to the divine throne in 
regular order, and piercing all the levels of the globe to the innermost, has 
become a luminous pillar of the universe. If the veil were to be lifted, fol-
lowing a perpendicular line the beam of your eye would meet and salute the 
Ka‘ba’s eye at every action of the ṣ a l ā t .

Brother! If you are the man I think you are, the strange fancies you have, 
have found nowhere other than the world of imagination to settle and lack 
any value that they should enter your heart. You don’t believe them yourself 
even and you can’t convince your soul, but you’ve gone astray. If the globe, 
which is many times smaller than your imagination, cannot be situated in 
your heart, which is open to those fancies and closed to the truth, broaden 
your horizons and expand your mind! Behold the dwellers on the earth, who 
have  become  like  the  members  of  a  council,  and  ask  them.  For  the  land-
owner knows his house. Basing it on observation and consensus, they will 
tell you unanimously: “ Our globe, our cradle and railway through space, is 
not so crazy as to make itself an unbridled exception to the divine laws in 
force in the lofty bodies. ” And they would proffer some relief maps.
Indication

The Divine Shari‘a of Creation, called the order of the world’s creation, 
has made it obligatory that the travelling globe, in ecstasy like a Mevlevi, 
joins  the  row  of  the  orderly  stars  and  complies  with  it.  For  together  with 
its partner, the earth declared: ( 41:11 ) Â  Á  . Worshipful obedience is 
preferable and more meritorious in congregation. 

I n   S h o r t :  The world’s Maker created the earth as He wished and as His 
wisdom  required,  not  as  your  appetites  wanted,  you  fond  imaginers!  He 
didn’t appoint your intelligences as the world’s engineers!

Another matter that indicates weakness of belief, or a tendency towards 
the Sophists’ way, or a perusing customer, is the idiotic statement: “ This 
fact is opposed to religion. ” For the person who deems it possible that some-
thing established by decisive proof to be true and right is opposed to reli-
gion, and is frightened of such contraiety, either has a Sophist hidden in his 
brain who is confusing it, or a whispering devil has pierced his heart and 
being concealed there is inciting a revolution, or he is again thinking of tak-
ing up religion and is examining it critically.

The Second Matter

The Second Matter

It’s no secret that the Bull ( Taurus ) and the Fish ( Pisces ) in the famous 
story are intruders on Islam and spongers. They became Muslim together 
with their narrator. If you like, go to the Third Premise and see by which 
door they entered Islam. And look in the mirror of the Fourth Premise for 
its relation to Ibn ‘Abbas; you’ll see the reason for its appropriation. It was 
subsequently narrated as a Hadith: “ The earth rests on a bull and a ﬁsh. ” 

F i r s t l y :   We  do  not  accept  that  it  is  a  Hadith,  for  it  has  signs  of  being 

i s r a i l i y y a t . 1 

S e c o n d l y :   Even  if  it  is  a  Hadith,  it  is  narrated  from  a  single  source 
(   â h â d   ) ,  which  infers  doubt.  It  may  not  be  included  among  the  tenets  of 
belief, because for those certain knowledge is requisite. 

T h i r d l y :   Even  though  there  is  agreement  in  narrations  concerning  it 
(   m ü t e w â t i r   )  and its text is certain, there is nothing deﬁnite to substantiate 
it. If you wish, refer to the Fifth Premise and consult the Eleventh. You’ll 
see that just as fanciful imaginings deluded the literalists; so the literalists 
distorted the Hadith’s correct aspects. The correct aspects are threefold: 

The bearers of the divine throne, called the Bull, the Vulture, Man, and 
others, are angels. The Bull and Fish are two such angels. For it is contrary 
to the world’s order to load the sublime throne on angels and the globe on a 
bull, which is in need of support like the globe itself. Moreover, it is heard 
from the tongue of the Shari‘a that each realm of being has a particular and 
appropriate angel appointed to it. Due to the relationship, the angel is called 
after the realm in question; indeed, in the angelic realm it represents it. It 
is heard as a Hadith: “ Every evening the sun approaches the divine throne. 
There it prostrates and receives permission before returning. ” Yes, the angel

FIRST ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF REALITY

55

appointed  to  the  sun  bears  the  sun’s  name  and  is  it’s  similitude;  it  is  the 
angel that goes and returns. Furthermore, according to the philosopher theo-
logians, every realm and species of being has a transcendent nature which is 
living and articulate and brings assistance and aid to its members. In the ter-
minology of the Shari‘a they are called the Angel of the Seas, the Angel of 
the Mountains, and the Rain Angel. Nevertheless, they have no true effect; 
it is solely the Most Pure and Holy One who creates effects.

The reason for external causes is so that the hand of power, the term for 
the display of grandeur and sovereignty, should not appear without veil to be 
in contact with lowly matters to those looking towards the sphere of causes 
(   d â i r e - i   e s b â b   ) . But in reality and in the inner dimensions of things (   m e l e -
k û t i y e t   ) , known as the sphere of belief (   d â i r e - i   a k î d e   ) , everything is lofty; 
there it is in keeping with divine dignity that the hand of power should have 
contact without veil.

T   h   e     S   e   c   o   n   d     M   e   a   n   i   n   g : Thawr ( the Bull ) is the ox, the main 
means of cultivating the earth and developing it. While Hût ( the Fish ) is 
the means of livelihood of people who live near the sea, indeed, for many 
of humankind. If someone asks: “ What does the state rest on? ” , he is told: 
“ On the sword and the pen. ” Or if he asks: “ What sustains civilisation? ”, 
he is told: “ Education, industry, and commerce. ” Or if he asks: “ How does 
humankind perpetuate itself? ” , he is told: “ With knowledge and labour. ” 
Similarly, and Allah knows best, the Glory of the World ( UWBP ) answered 
the  way  he  did  in  reply  to  a  similar  question.  The  person  who  asked  it, 
although it was not his business, did so because his mind had not acquired 
the capacity for such truths – as discussed in the Second Premise. So our 
Prophet ( UWBP ) gave an appropriate answer, which was: “ The earth rests 
on the bull. ” That is, it is humankind that cultivates the earth. The means 
of  livelihood  of  rural  communities,  one  of  its  groups,  is  agriculture.  And 
agriculture rests on the backs of oxen and is their job. The people of coastal 
regions, another group, subsist mostly on ﬁsh; indeed, ﬁsh is one of the main 
commodities  the  city-dwellers’  trade  rests  on.  It  corroborates  the  saying:

ّ(cid:163)َ(cid:171)َ(cid:98)  the  Prophet  ( UWBP )  gave  the  appropriate  and 
required answer. He did not give the answer the sick questioner wanted due to 
his false appetite. The verse,  ( 2:189 ) ¦  ¥  ¤  £  ¢¡  ﮯ   ~ 
is an apt introduction to this truth.

ّ(cid:127)(cid:170)ا ىَ

T h e   T h i r d   M e a n i n g :  The  Bull  ( Taurus )  and  the  Fish  ( Pisces )  are  two 
constellations  determined  in  the  earth’s  annual  orbit.  They  are  certainly 
hypothetical and imaginary, but because the law of divine practice known as 
gravity, which is in force in the world and is charged with holding the physi-
cal  heavenly  bodies  in  order,  is  centred  on  those  constellations,  it  makes 
permissible the wise saying: “ The earth rests on the constellations. ” This is 
the point of view of modern science. For ancient philosophy supposed the 
constellations to be in the heavens, while modern science assumes they are 
in the earth’s orbit. This interpretation has great value in the view of science.
It is also narrated that the question was asked several times. One time, 
the reply was “ it’s ( the earth’s ) on the Fish, ” which means that a month 
later it would be on the Bull. That is, since the rays and beams of the above-
mentioned  law,  radiating  in  every  direction  through  endless  space,  were 
focused on the constellation of Pisces, the globe of the earth had raced from 
the constellation of Aquarius, grabbed the law as it was lowered from Pisces, 
and was hung like a fruit on a branch of the tree of creation. Or it alighted 
on it like a bird. That is, the ﬂying earth built its nest on the constellation 
of Taurus. Having learnt this, consider it fairly! As is explained in the Fifth 
Premise, how can the well-known ﬁctitious tale be interpreted, other than by 
ascribing futility to pre-eternal wisdom, proving divine art to be superﬂu-
ous, and spoiling the wondrous order of the universe, which is proof of the 
Maker? May ignorance be damned a thousand times !

The Third Matter

The Third Matter
Qāf Mountain

As is well-known, it is one thing to know the nature of something, and 
another to afﬁrm its existence. The two have to be distinguished between. 
For there are many things whose existence is certain but then a person is 
beset by misgivings and deems them impossible, let alone probable. If you 
like,  ask  the  Seventh  Premise;  it  will  reply  in  the  afﬁrmative.  Moreover, 
there  are  many  texts  that  are  incontrovertible,  yet  doubts  have  thronged 

FIRST ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF REALITY

57

around what they signify. Indeed, confusion has been caused by the answer 
received to the question: “ What does it mean? ” If you wish, crack the shell 
of the Eleventh Premise and you’ll ﬁnd this pearl.
Reminder

It is like this: among certain texts, only the verse ( 50:1 ) $  #  "! 
indicates “ Qāf. ” But “ Qāf ” could have been like “   Ṣ ā d ;   ”  not in the east of 
the world, but in the west of the mouth. Such a possibility, however, causes 
the evidence to cease being certain. Furthermore, evidence that what it deﬁ-
nitely signiﬁes is not other than this is that Qarāﬁ, 1 an authoritative scholar 
(   m u j t a h i d   )  of the Shari‘a, said that it was ُهَ(cid:170)  َل ْ(cid:134)َا  َ(cid:202) However, you may refer 
to  the  Fourth  Premise  for  the  well-known  ascriptions  to  Ibn  ‘Abbas.  2  Its 
relevance  will  become  clear  to  you.  Nevertheless,  just  as  everything  Ibn 
‘Abbas said did not have to be a Hadith, so everything he related did not 
have to be acceptable. For in his youth, he used some i s r a i l i y a t  in order to 
disclose certain truths by means of stories.

I f   y o u   a s k :   “ The  Suﬁ  veriﬁers  of  reality  depicted  Qāf  [ Mountain ]  in 

many ways, didn’t they? ” 

I   s a y   i n   r e p l y :  The renowned World of Similitudes is where they make 
their peregrinations. They slip out of their bodies as we take off our clothes, 
and journeying in the spirit gaze on its strange wonders. As for Qāf, it is 
represented in that world as they describe it. Like the heavens and its stars 
may be displayed in a small piece of glass, even tiny things in this Manifest 
World – for instance seeds – become huge trees in the World of Similitudes 
through the embodiment of meanings and its effects. The laws of the two 
realms should not be confused. Those familiar with the gist of Muhyi al-Din 
‘Arabi’s 3 ideas will afﬁrm this. So if you want to learn the worth of what has 
gained currency among the common people or those who resemble them: 
that Qāf encompasses the earth and is numerous; that between the two is a 
ﬁve-hundred-year distance; and that its peak touches the skies; go and light 
the lamp of the Third Premise, then come back here and enter the darkness. 
Perhaps you’ll espy it’s eloquence, like the water of life.

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

If you want to understand my conviction concerning this matter, know 
that I have decided that Qāf [ Mountain ] exists, but I’ll pass over what it is 
in reality. If there is a sound, unanimously reported Hadith explaining this, 
I’ll believe that what the Prophet ( UWBP ) meant is right and true and real. 
But what he intended, not what  people imagine. Because sometimes what 
is understood is not what was intended. What we know about this matter is 
as follows:

Qāf Mountain is the Himalaya mountain range, which covers most of the 
East and in olden times divided the civilised peoples from the nomadic ones, 
and is the mother of the Chamus, 1 the highest mountains in the world. It is 
said that most of the mountains of the world branched out from this range 
( lit.  from  its  “ roots ” ).  This  shows  that  the  famous  fanciful  idea  that  Qāf 
encompasses the world must have originated from this branching out. 

And  secondly,  the  World  of  Similitudes  solves  the  riddle,  since  it 
resembles  the  Manifest  World  in  form  and  the  World  of  the  Unseen  in 
meaning.  Whoever  wishes  may  behold  that  world  to  a  degree  through 
the window of true visions, the aperture of true dreams, the telescope of 
transparent objects, or at least beyond the veils of imagination. There are 
numerous indications that the World of Similitudes exists and that mean-
ings are embodied in it. Hence, the Qāf on the earth may be the seed of the 
wonderful Qāf on that world.

Moreover, the Maker’s dominions are extensive and not restricted to this 
lowly globe. As for space, it is Allah’s world and truly vast, and may con-
tain Qāf with its wonders. But it is not reasonably impossible to touch the 
heavens, which are “ a wave rolled back, ” although they are a ﬁve-hundred-
year distance from the earth, reckoned in “ the days of Allah. ” For like the 
heavens, Qāf may be transparent and invisible.

And  fourthly,  why  shouldn’t  Qāf  consist  of  a  mighty  mountain-chain, 
manifested from the sphere of the horizon? Just as the horizon’s name may 
be a source of Qāf, for wherever one looks a band of ranges appears like 
concentric circles. They gradually disappear from sight and hand over to the 
imagination. Finally the imagination conceives of an encompassing circle of 
mountain ranges touching the skies. By virtue of the sphericity, even if they 
are ﬁve-hundred-years distant, they still appear contiguous.

The Fourth Matter

The Fourth Matter
The Barrier of Dhu’l-Qarnayn 1 

You know that it is one thing to know something exists and another to 
know its nature and what it is. Also, a single proposition comprises numer-
ous assumptions. Some of them are necessary, and some are theoretical and 
controversial. Furthermore, it is well-known that if an obstinate, imitative 
man asks someone about something he sees in a book in order to test him, 
although it may have been somewhat falsiﬁed, and the second man answers 
in  accordance  with  what  the  ﬁrst  man  knows,  which  is  unexpressed;  his 
reply is right in two respects. If he replies directly, or he gives an answer 
that conforms to what the obstinate questioner knows, either explicitly or 
interpreting it, both are right. That is to say, one answer both satisﬁes real-
ity, because it is true; and it convinces the questioner, because even it is not 
what was intended, it conforms with what he knows. It does not offend the 
context either, because it inserts a spark of life into the answer from which 
the original intention will draw life.

The  Qur’an’s  answers  are  thus,  so  from  now  on  we  shall  distinguish 
between the necessary [ belief in which is obligatory ] and the unnecessary 
[ belief in which is not obligatory ]. Thus, the matters in the Qur’an’s answer 
belief in which is understood to be obligatory may not be denied. It is like 
this: Dhu’l-Qarnayn was a person whose existence is corroborated by Allah. 
Under  his  direction  and  guidance  a  barrier  was  constructed  between  two 
mountains  in  order  to  repel  the  incursions  of  brigands  and  nomads.  Gog 
and Magog were two raiding tribes. At the divine command, the barrier will 
be destroyed. And so on. According to this analogy, belief in the Qur’an’s 
statements referring to him is compulsory. Not even a letter of them may be 
denied. However, the Qur’an makes no deﬁning or speciﬁc statement con-
cerning the nature of those subjects and their predicates. Rather, in accord-
ance with the rule, “ A general statement can express or signify a particular 
( h â s  ) one with none of the three types of signiﬁcation ” (   d e l â l â t - i   s e l â s e   ) ,  2 
and the rule of logic, “ The subject and predicate of a proposition may be 

1. Dhu’l-Qarnayn, the two-horned one, mentioned in Qur’an 18:83-98. Below the 
author disagrees with the view that it refers to Alexander the Great of Macedon ( 356-
323 BC ).

to refer respectively to the primary or literal meanings of words or phrases, the implied 
meanings, and ﬁgurative signiﬁcations.

conceived of in any form ” it is established that the Qur’an does not denote 
them speciﬁcally; but it may accept them. That is to say, the above state-
ments are theoretical or speculative (   n a z a r î   )  statements. They may denote 
other things. They are open to interpretation and may be interpreted. Their 
being disputed by authoritative scholars shows that they are theoretical or 
speculative. But regretably, fancying that the answer should conform with 
the question in every respect and attaching no importance to the defects of 
the question, they garnered the essential and theoretical components of the 
answer  from  the  questioner  and  the  question,  and  became  commentators. 
No, they became interpreters; no, they gave meanings at variance with the 
truth. No, they interpreted something that might possibly have conﬁrmed the 
meaning as something inferred or understood. But as explained in the Third 
Premise, the literalists listened to them uncritically and accepted them as did 
the authoritative scholars, since they considered them to be trivial tales. If 
those speciﬁc statements are accepted as they are in the corrupted Torah and 
Gospels,  it  means  opposing  the  infallibility  (   m â s u m i y e t   )   of  the  prophets, 
which is a doctrine of the Sunnis. The stories of Lot and David ( Upon whom 
be peace ) both testify to this. One may make independent judgements and 
interpretations  concerning  the  matter  and  how  it  was.  So  seeking  Allah’s 
assistance, I say: Firm belief in what Allah and His Prophet intended is deﬁ-
nitely obligatory, because belief in it is a religious obligation. But what they 
actually intended is disputed. It is as follows:

I do not say that Dhu’l-Qarnayn was Alexander, for the name does not ﬁt. 
Some of the commentators called him m a l i k  ( king ) spelling it with k a s r a , 
others called him m a l a k , spelling it with a f a t ḥ a , others said he was a prophet, 
and others said he was a saint, and so on. But certainly Dhu’l-Qarnayn was 
the person who conducted the construction of the Barrier.

As  for  the  Barrier,  some  commentators  said  it  was  the  Wall  of  China, 
others said it was a great mountainous barrier somewhere else, others said 
it was a hidden barrier, concealing the revolutions and circumstances of the 
world. And others said such-and-such, and so on and so forth. Most prob-
ably  it  was  a  mighty  rampart  or  huge  wall  to  repulse  the  depradations  of 
marauders.

As for Gog and Magog, some commentators said they were two tribes 
descended from Yasef, 1 others said they were the Mongols and Manchuri-
ans, others said they were the peoples of the north-east, and yet others said 
that they were a vast body of men, a horde which would overturn the world

and  civilisation;  and  still  others  said  they  were  a  sort  of  creature,  either 
human or sub-human, from beyond the earth or from inside it. They would 
be the cause of the end of the world and would thus overturn humankind. 
Yet other commentators said other things. What is certain and the point on 
which  they  are  agreed  is  this:  Gog  and  Magog,  two  pillaging  plundering 
tribes, and the people of civilisation are two groups of Allah’s creatures.

As for the destruction of the Barrier, some say that it will occur on the 
Last  Day;  others,  near  to  the  Last  Day;  others,  when  it’s  still  a  long  way 
off, but as a sign of it; and still others, that it has been destroyed. But it has 
not been demolished. Much has been said about it. Most probably, what is 
agreed upon is that its ruin will be a sign that a grey hair has appeared in 
the Earth’s beard and that the human race, its offspring, is growing old. If 
you have weighed up and contemplated this discussion, you will admit that 
the following is possible: the Qur’anic Barrier is the Great Wall of China, 
which  is of great length and, as one of the seven wonders of the world, was 
built under the guidance of a person whose existence is conﬁrmed by Allah. 
He delivered the city-dwellers of that time from the despoliation of nomadic 
tribes. The Huns, one group of those savages, overturned Europe; the Mon-
gols, another, overturned Asia. Then the Barrier’s destruction was looked 
on as a sign of the last times. But it’s being levelled is something else. The 
Prophet ( UWBP ) said: “ I’m one of the signs of the last times. The end of 
the world and myself are as [ close as ] these two [ ﬁngers ], ” so why should 
it be thought strange that the Barrier’s destruction will be a sign of the end 
of the world after the Era of Bliss? Also, in view of the earth’s great age, 
it’s ruin is merely a wrinkle of old age on its face, or like the fading light of 
evening compared to high noon. Though admittedly there is an interval of 
thousands of years. Similarly, the turmoil of Gog and Magog resembles a 
fever arising from humanity’s decrepitude. After all this, the opening section 
of the Twelfth Premise will open the door for you to another interpretation. 
It is like this:

Just  as  the  Qur’an  relates  its  stories  to  give  lessons;  so  it  makes  vital 
points suitably to one of its aims (   m a k a s ı d   )  and joins them to it. Although 
outwardly the light and ﬁre of things do not appear together, they still may 
embrace  and  accompany  one  another  in  the  mind  or  in  style.  The  story’s 
purpose is its moral; you don’t need the details; whatever they are, they do 
not concern you. Take your lesson and go! Also, you can seek further expla-
nation from the Tenth Premise. Figurative speech opens the door to further 
ﬁgurative speech. ٍةَ(cid:87) ِ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:110)  ٍنْ(cid:193)َ(cid:150) يِ(cid:158) (   ُس ْ(cid:175)ـ ّ(cid:131)(cid:170)ا  )  ُبُرْ(cid:155)َ(cid:98) drives the literalists out.

The key to Allah’s argument ( h ü c c e t u l l a h  – the Qur’an ), which is mani-
fested  in  the  styles  of  Arabic,  lies  in  rhetoric  and  eloquence  (   b e l â g a t   ) , 
which is founded on metaphor and ﬁgurative speech and is the basis of its 
miraculous inimitability (   i ’ c a z   ) . It does not consist of baubles found by the 
wayside through false conjecture due to their fame and hidden in the shells 
of  its  verses  without  their  consent.  If  you  wish,  experience  with  pleasure 
the  conclusion  of  the  Tenth  Premise,  for  it  is  sweet  indeed  and  contains 
honey. Moreover, like other signs of the last times, the Barrier, about which 
nothing is known, may be concealed somewhere else and remaining there 
unknown through various revolutions until the end of the world, will then 
be destroyed.
Indication

As is well-known, habitations survive longer than their inhabitants. Cita-
dels last longer than those who fortiﬁed them. Dwelling and fortiﬁcation are 
the reason (   ‘ i l l e t   )  for their existence, not for their continuance and survival. 
Even if they are the reason for their survival, this does not necessitate their 
enduring and not being vacant. The continuation of the purpose of some-
thing, or its existence even, is not one of the things that necessitate its con-
tinuance. Numerous buildings remain vacant and empty although they were 
built as dwellings or forts. Misunderstandings about this question have led 
to false notions. 
Reminder

The aim of these details is to pave the way for distinguishing and dif-
ferentiating between exegesis and interpretation, certitude and supposition, 
existence and modality, a question and various explanations of it, meaning 
and veriﬁcations of it, and occurrence and possibility.

The Fifth Matter

The Fifth Matter

As is well-known, Hell is beneath the earth, but we Sunnis cannot spec-
ify its location with any certainty. Nevertheless, what is clear is ‘beneath-
ness;’  its  being  under  the  earth.  Our  globe,  like  the  other  celestial  bodies 
(   n ü c û m   ) , is a fruit of the world’s creation, which resembles the Tuba tree. 
What is beneath the fruit encompasses all that is under the tree’s branches. 
In consequence, Hell is among the branches under the earth. Its place is there 
wherever it is. Its distance below does not have to be long and contiguous. 
According to modern science, ﬁre overruns most of the cosmos. This shows 
that beyond this Hell, which is the origin and basis of the ﬁre and accom-
panies humankind on the road to eternity, will one day  rend the veil and 
emerge, commanding attention. I want to draw attention to this point.

FIRST ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF REALITY

S e c o n d l y :  It is under the earth and is its centre inside it. Because of this, 
the globe is pregnant with the seed of the Zakkum tree of Hell, and one day 
it will give birth to it. Indeed, the earth ﬂying through space will lay such an 
egg that even if it is not Hell in its entirety, it will comprise its head or some 
other  organ,  folded  up.  On  the  Last  Day,  uniting  with  others  of  its  parts, 
the ghastly demons of Hell will assault the people of rebellion. Think of it! 
Even if you yourself are not destined for Hell, reckoning and calculation can 
take you that far. For heat increases one degree approximately every thirty-
three metres, which means it reaches around two hundred thousand degrees 
at the centre. This is two hundred times hotter than our heat, which gener-
ally reaches one thousand degrees, as is proved by the Hadith: “ The ﬁre of 
Hell is two hundred times ﬁercer than ours. ” Furthermore, part of Hell is 
extremely cold. This cold  (   z e m h e r i r   )  burns as it freezes. It is established 
by natural science (   h i k m e t - i   t a b i i y y e   )  that ﬁre may reach such a degree it 
freezes water. It instantaneously consumes the heat and burns with its cold. 
This means that ﬁre encompasses all degrees, one of which is extreme cold.
Reminder

It should be known that the world of the hereafter, which is destined for 
eternity,  cannot  be  measured  or  dealt  with  with  the  criteria  of  this  world, 
which doomed to pass. Be ready! The hereafter will be offered in small part 
for your consideration at the end of the Third Article. 
Indication

The testimony of the order established by all the sciences, and the instruc-
tion of philosophy’s  (   h i k m e t   )  inductive reasoning, and the intimations of 
the essence of humanity, and the signs of never-ending human hope, and the 
indications of the repeated resurrections of all the realms of beings like the 
days and the years, and the hints of the lack of futility and pointers of pre-
eternal wisdom, and tokens of inﬁnite divine mercy, and the explicit state-
ments of the Truthful Prophet ( UWBP ), and the guidance of the miraculous 
Qur’an, all reveal eight doors and two windows through which the eye of the 
intellect may behold the gardens of bliss of the hereafter.

The Sixth Matter

The Sixth Matter

It  is  certain  that  what  is  attractive  about  Revelation  is  its  miraculous 
inimitability (   i ’ c a z   ) . Its miraculousness is born of the high level of rheto-
ric and eloquence ( b e l â g a t ; Ar. b a l ā g h a  ). Rhetoric is founded on linguistic 
ﬁgures and qualities, and particularly on metaphor and ﬁgurative language. 
Any person who does not look through the telescope of metaphor and ﬁgures

of speech will be unable to perceive its qualities. For Revelation, which con-
veys the spring waters of the sciences of the styles of Arabic in order to bring 
its  truths  close  to  the  minds  of  men,  takes  into  consideration  their  under-
standing  and  shows  regard  and  respect  for  their  feelings,  which  is  called 
divine condescension. At that time it was thus.

Qur’anic commentators should give the Qur’an its due and not diminish 
its value, nor interpret it with anything that does not bear the ratifying stamp 
of eloquence. For it is clearer and more obvious than any truth that just as 
the Qur’an’s meanings are true, so are its manner of expression and ways 
of  conveying  meaning  eloquent  and  elevated.  So  one  who  does  not  refer 
particulars to that source and mine is being niggardly in giving it its due. We 
shall point out one or two examples, since they attract attention.

F i r s t  E x a m p l e :  ( 78:7 ) :  9 ( Allah knows best what he intended ). It 
is permissible that the ﬁgure of speech indicated here alludes to the follow-
ing notion: the globe is like a submarine in the oceans of space and since, 
with its mountains planting masts or casting anchor, it merges with the air, 
its balance has been preserved. That is to say, the mountains resemble the 
ship’s anchor and masts. 

S e c o n d l y :  The earth’s inner revolutions and tremors are calmed through 
the mountains, for they are as though the earth’s pores. When an internal 
excitement occurs, the earth breathes through the mountains and its anger 
and upset are calmed. That is to say, the mountains are means of its calm 
and tranquillity.

T h i r d l y :  The earth is cultivated by means of human beings. And human 
life  is  perpetuated  by  human  beings  preserving  water,  earth  and  air,  the 
sources of life, so that they may be proﬁted from. And what ensures these 
three conditions of life are the mountains. For the mountains serve both as 
reservoirs for the water, and as combs for the air as they attract the moisture, 
and since they are the means of precipitating the harmful gases mixed with 
the air so purifying it, they also water the earth. So too they preserve the 
earth from the formation of muddy swamps and the encroachment of the sea.
F o u r t h l y :  The relevance and similitude [ of the verse ] according to elo-
quence is this: Suppose a man ascends high up in the balloon of his imagi-
nation, and looking down on the mountain ranges imagines them to be the 
haircloth shelters of nomads thrown over the poles of the layers of earth, and 
the individual mountains to be tents erected on poles. Would this be opposed 
to nature and imagination? If, in conversation with a nomad, you fancy and 

FIRST ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF REALITY

65

conceive of the face of the earth together with its mountain ranges and the 
mountains as tents pitched on it, you would not be far from the Arabs’ imag-
ination and styles. They would not condemn you if gazing from afar through 
the telescope of wisdom at the earth, man’s cradle, and the skies, its lofty 
roof, you imagine the sky stretching from the wide horizons to the heavens 
as a tent-roof bound with the pegs of the mountains on the face of the earth. 
One or two more examples follow in the Reminder of the Eighth Matter.

The Seventh Matter

The Seventh Matter

In order to mislead people, certain literalists persistently cite verses like 

the following: ( 79:30 ) n ;   ( 88:20 ) ®  ;   ( 51:48 ) É ;  
( 18:86 ) 8  7  6  5 . There is no need for us to defend [ the verses’ 
interpretation ], for the great commentators have divulged the secrets in the 
pronouns ( T. z a m â i r ; Ar. ḍ a m ā ’ i r  ) the verses contain. 1

ي۪(cid:86)اﯬﯧُ(cid:93)ِ(cid:170) ُ

ّقُرَ(cid:192) ٍمـْ(cid:110)َر وُذ  َتاَ(cid:183)ْ(cid:193)َ(cid:182)َو     َءاـَ(cid:167)ُ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا  َىِ(cid:170) اوُ(cid:107)َ

It  is  futile  to  state  the  obvious,  especially  if  it  is  observed,  as  everyone 
knows. This means there must be some singular point to save it from mean-
inglessness. If it is said: “ Look! The earth has been spread out although it is 
spherical, and is a cradle for you, and has been saved from being overrun by 
the seas; ” or “ The sun is both stationary and travels to regulate your liveli-
hood; ” or “ Although the sun is thousands of [ light ] years away, it sets in 
a muddy spring ” – the verses’ meanings cease being allusive (   k i n â y e   )  and 
become unambiguous. These singular points are ﬁne points of eloquence.

The Eighth Matter

The Eighth Matter

One of the things that casts the literalists into the abyss of doubt and hesi-
tation, perhaps the chief of them, is their confusing possibilities with actual 
occurrences. For instance, they say: “ If it were such-and-such, it would be 
possible for divine power, and to our way of thinking, would indicate divine 
power more compellingly. So it should occur. ” Alas, you wretches! When 
have your minds been shown to be sufﬁciently proﬁcient to act as engineers 
for the cosmos? You can’t comprehend the universal good with your insig-
niﬁcant particular intellects. If there were a cubit-long nose made of gold 
and all gazes were ﬁxed on it alone, only then would someone appear who 
found it beautiful.

1. This is a play on words: z a m i r  also means heart or inner consciousness.

66

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

Furthermore,  what  bewilders  literalists  is  their  fancying  that  essential 
possibility is opposed to certain knowledge. They almost become Sophists 
(   l â e d r î l e r   )  since they are in doubt concerning sensory knowledge (   u l û m - u  
â d i y e   ) . They are unashamed even that their way demands that they doubt 
self-evident things like Lake Van and Mount Subhan due to the possibility 
that Lake Van may turn into grape molasses and Mount Subhan into sugar-
encrusted honey. Or because they do not accept that the earth is round like 
some of our friends, the possibility that dragging their feet they will tumble 
into  the  oceans  of  non-existence.  So  one  shouldn’t  afﬁrm  that  Lake  Van 
and Mount Subhan remain permanently in their original states. So now you 
know, O wretches! Where are you? Look! It is accepted in logic that con-
jectures about concrete perceptible things are held to be self-evident. If you 
deny  such  self-evident  matters,  I’ll  send  you  my  condolences  rather  than 
giving  you  advice.  Because  you  look  on  knowledge  obtained  through  the 
external senses (   u l û m - u   â d i y e   )  as dead and sophistries as living.

T h e   F o u r t h   C a l a m i t y  that confuses the literalists is their mixing up con-
jectural or delusive possibilities (   i m k â n - ı   v e h m î   )  with reasonable ones. But 
because  conjectural  possibilities  have  given  birth  to  sophistry  out  of  the 
rootless  race  of  blind  imitation,  without  offering  proof  (   d e l î l   )   they  have 
each opened the way in self-evident matters to a “ perhaps, ” a “ possibly, ” 
and to doubts. This arises mostly from the failure to reason, a weakness of 
the heart or nervous disorder of the brain, and the failure to conceive of the 
subject and attribute of propositions. Whereas, to doubt a reasonable pos-
sibility means being hesitant about a matter that is not necessary and about 
which  there  is  no  certain  proof  of  its  existence  or  non-existence.  If  such 
doubt has arisen from proof (   d e l î l   )  it is acceptable; otherwise it is not cred-
itable. However, concerning conjectural possibilities, some people given to 
delusions say: “ They may not be as the proofs (   b ü r h a n   )  show, because rea-
son cannot comprehend everything. Our reasons tell us that this may be the 
case. ” Yes, no, what affords such a possibility is your delusive imagination. 
For the mark of the reason is to operate through proofs (   b ü r h a n   ) . For sure it 
cannot weigh up everything, but it can judge such material matters and any 
matter that cannot escape the clutches of sight, its smallest servant. If it can’t 
do this, then like a child, we should not be held accountable.
Reminder

My  literalist  and  superﬁcial-viewing  addressee  of  the  mind,  whom  I 
have scolded and rebuked and exposed: it is usually the enemies of religion 
who going to one extreme and looking on Islam from afar are unable to see 

FIRST ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF REALITY

its beauty. But sometimes its ignorant friends who go to the other extreme 
cause harm, thinking they are doing good. 

T h e   F i f t h   C a l a m i t y :  One of things that taking the hands of those unfor-
tunates who go to one extreme or the other and cast them into darkness, is 
their seeking literal truth in every part of ﬁgurative speech. For sure a seed 
of truth has to be found in all ﬁgurative speech from which the ﬁgures may 
sprout and grow. Alternatively, truth is a light-giving wick, while ﬁgurative 
speech is the lamp’s glass, increasing the light. Yes, love is in the heart, and 
the intellect in the brain; it’s futile to search for them in the hand or foot. 

S i x t h  C a l a m i t y :  What screens the sight and conceals eloquence is restrict-
ing the view to literal meanings. This means that however much the truth is 
perceived  by  the  intellect,  so  ﬁgures  cannot  be  aggressed  against.  If  they 
are, the meanings are hidden. It is due to this that the beauty and eloquence 
of the Qur’an’s verses and of Hadiths cannot be shown through exegesis or 
translations. It is as though the literalists consider the associated meaning of 
the ﬁgure to be opposed to what is reasonably true. But such meanings may 
be either mental, or emotional, or customary, or contextual, or any of a lot 
of other things. If you wish, enter the two hundred and twenty-ﬁrst door of 
D a l ā ’ i l   a l - I ‘ j ā z , a garden of Paradise, and you’ll see how the mighty ‘Abd 
al-Qāhir  1 angrily drew such unfortunates to him and rebuked and scolded 
them.

S e v e n t h   C a l a m i t y :  One of the things that makes the [ grammatical ] deﬁ-
nite indeﬁnite is the literalists restricting such inessentials as vowel points to 
what is essential (   z â t i y e   ) . This necessitates denying a usual quality (   v a s f - i  
c â r î   )  which is other than the subject (   g a y r - i   m e n   h ü v e   l e h   ) , so diverting the 
sun of truth from its course. Such people have evidently never studied the 
Arabs’ literary styles, for the Arabs say: “ The mountains came to us then 
departed,  then  the  peak  of  another  appeared,  then  disappeared  and  parted 
from  us, ”  and  so  on.  As  explained  in  the  M i f t ā ḥ   of  al-Sakkaki,  2  imagi-
nary inversion (   k a l b - i   h a y a l i   ) , a literary device of the science of ﬁgurative 
speech  (   b e y a n   ) ,  is  used  in  many  places  to  elucidate  its  mysteries.  It  is  a 
subtle art which is based on fallacious imaginings. I’m now going to cite two

important examples by way of explanation, to pursue the discussion:

 ( 36:38  ) ¶       μ  ´  ³ ( 24:43 ) Þ  Ý  Ü  Û  Ú  Ù  Ø  ×

These two verses are truly striking. To ascribe them a rigid apparent mean-
ing is to deny rhetoric its right. For the ﬁne metaphor of the ﬁrst is so warm 
it  melts  frozen,  solid  things  such  as  ice,  and  like  lightning  rends  the  veil 
of  the  apparent,  such  as  cloud.  While  the  eloquence  of  the  second  is  so 
ﬁrm and brilliant that it halts the sun’s travel. Similar to this is the verse, 
( 76:16 )  y  x  w which comprises a ﬁne metaphor, as follows: the food 
dishes of Paradise are neither crystal nor silver. The difference between the 
two constitutes the indicator (   k a r i n e   )  of the metaphor. That is to say, with 
its transparency the crystal and with its shining whiteness, the silver are two 
samples to depict the paradisaical goblets which the Beneﬁcent Maker has 
sent to this world to excite with His wares the appetites of customers desir-
ous of Paradise, and to stimulate demand.

Similarly, a ﬁne metaphor may be distilled from Þ  Ý  Ü  Û  Ú which 
is based on imagining a beauty contest between the earth and the sky and 
a competition between them. Its ﬁeld is this: it’s as though just as the earth 
is  adorned  with  its  mountains  clothed  in  white  garments  of  snow  and  ice 
and with its colourful gardens; so too as though competing with it, the sky 
appears  veiled,  attired  in  the  broken  clouds  like  towering  mountains  and 
hills and valleys, and tinted with various colours like the earth’s gardens. 
Were  those  towering,  billowing  clouds  to  be  likened  to  mountains,  ships, 
gardens,  valleys,  and  caravans  of  camels,  there  would  be  no  error  in  the 
simile. The thunder acts as shepherd to those itinerent bodies of the atmos-
phere, whisking the lightning around their heads like a whip. The ﬂoating 
clouds travelling through the oceans of the skies recall mountains crumbling 
on  doomsday.  As  though  the  sky  summons  to  arms  with  the  thunder  the 
molecules of water vapour, which, having later received the order to retire, 
return to their places and are hidden.

Indeed, very often the clouds wear the dress of the mountains, assume 
their forms, together with the whiteness of snow and ice and their moisture 
and coldness. The two are thus friends and neighbours and are compelled to 
exchange what they have. This brotherhood and mutual exchange of forms 
and  dress  is  found  in  many  places  in  the  Qur’an.  The  Revelation  testiﬁes 
to their shaking hands as they converse and embrace each other on many 
lines of the page of the earth in the book of the world. For we see the clouds

resting on the mountain making the mountain like a dock or anchorage for 
the ships of the clouds.

The  second  verse:  ( 36:38 ) ¶       μ  ´  ³  .  Here,  just  as 
´ indicates a style, so μ hints at a truth. That is to say, it is per-
missible  that  with  the  former  it  indicates  that,  like  a  gilded  ironclad  ship 
with a golden anchor, the sun voyages through the oceans of the sky, which 
are known as “ waves held back. ” The molten golden sun is at anchor in its 
point of rest, yet is in motion. But its motion is accidental and secondary, 
and is presented visually as a concession and to facilitate understanding. In 
reality it has two motions, but even if this were not the case, it would not be 
important, for the purpose is to demonstrate the order. Whether the motion 
is secondary or actual as in the styles of Arabic, from the point of view of 
the order it is the same.

S e c o n d l y :  Since the sun is in motion in its resting point in its orbit, its 
parts of molten gold are in motion too. Its true motion is the seed of its meta-
phorical movement, mentioned above; indeed, it is its spring.

T h i r d l y :  The sun’s travelling through the deserts of the world in its lit-
ter or couch, known as its resting place, and with its planets, appears to be 
required by wisdom, for divine power made everything living and in motion 
and condemned nothing to absolute motionlessness. His mercy left nothing 
in absolute idleness, the brother of death and cousin of non-existence, that it 
should be recorded as such. Hence, the sun is free on condition it complies 
with  the  divine  law.  It  can  roam,  but  on  condition  it  does  not  transgress 
the freedom of others. Yes, the sun is a desert chieftain who complies with 
the divine command and in each of its motions carries out the divine will. 
Yes, just as its motion is actual and essential, so it may be accidental and 
perceived. Just as it is real, so it may be metaphorical. ´ illuminates the 
metaphor. μ alludes to the style’s vitalising signiﬁcation.

I n   S h o r t :  The divine aim here is to point out the order and regularity. The 
order shines like the sun. In accordance with the rule:  ْلَ(cid:127)َ(cid:98)  َ(cid:202)َو  َلَ(cid:127)َ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)ا  ِلﯭﯦ 
whether it is the sun’s motion or the earth’s rotation that results in the order, 
we are not obliged to search out the fundamental cause since it does not spoil 
the true aim. For example, a lightness is obtained with the  a l i f  of  َلاَ(cid:162) ( he 
said ). Whatever the original vowel, even if it were k ā f  ( k ) instead of w ā w  
( w ) it would make no difference. It’s still a l i f  and light.

Basing  it  on  the  external  sense  of  sight  and  the  above  depictions,  I 
say this: to display a bigoted, literalist, lifeless frigidity is opposed to the 
warmth and subtlety of eloquence; similarly, it wounds and opposes the 
intellectual appreciation which testiﬁes to the divine wisdom underlying 
the world’s order, which is proof of the Maker. For example, if you turn 
yourself towards Mount Subhan from a great distance and you want it to be 
opposite you on every side; or you’ve seen it opposite you on every side; 
and you give up the short way of taking a few steps in order to bring about 
the  change  and  imagine  or  propose  taking  the  enormously  long  way  of 
traversing a vast circle around the huge mountain, it would be an extraor-
dinary example of waste and futility and in my view a crime against the 
world’s order. Now look fairly with the eye of truth at this cold bigotry: 
just as it opposes a self-evident fact that is established through the testi-
mony of inductive reasoning – the facts that there is no waste or futility 
in creation, and pre-eternal wisdom never leaves the short and direct way 
or chooses long and injurious ways; so too, could anything be conceived 
that prevents inductive reasoning being the indicator of a ﬁgure of speech? 
Why shouldn’t it be permissible?
Reminder

If you wish, return to the Premises and make the First, the lesser and the 
Third the greater. They will lead you to the conclusion that what confuses 
the minds of the literalists is the attractions of Greek philosophy. They even 
look on it as an incontestable principle in understanding verses of the Qur’an. 
An example that would make even an elderly widow who has lost her only 
son roar with laughter is this: some of them who were unable to distinguish 
the triﬂes of philosophy from the jewels of truth in the words of an elevated, 
discerning  person  who  was  far  superior  to  themselves,  said  in  Kurdish: 

ْכَ(cid:293) َ(cid:296)   ْ(cid:299)ِ(cid:300)ا َو ِژ   ْن ِرא َ(cid:305) ِ(cid:338)  

(cid:243) ِ(cid:256)אَ(cid:301)َ(cid:272)  But  these  words  are  taken  from  the  school  of 

philosophy which states that the angels are luminous bodies created from 
the elements, and this explicitly refutes the fact that the angels are free of 
corporeality. They understood that the elements are fourfold and from Islam. 
But their being four and elements and simple are philosophers’ terms and 
among the basic principles of the false natural sciences. They have no con-
nection with any principle of Islam. It is rather a matter based on superﬁcial 
observation. Yes, everything that touches on religion does not have to have 
originated from religion. And to believe that every matter that has combined

with Islam is derived from its elements infers that one does not know the 
character of Islam’s elements. For the Book, Sunna, consensus, and analogy, 
the four elements of Islam, would not give rise to or comprise such matters.
I n   S h o r t :  The idea that the elements are elementary and fourfold origi-
nated from the swamp of philosophy, not from the pure mine of the Shari‘a. 
But since philosophy’s error entered our forefathers’ language, it found a 
sound bearer. For when they said “ they are fourfold, ” they meant they were 
apparently four. Or oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon, which in truth 
form the members of bodies, are also four in number. 

If you are openminded, consider these evils of philosophy, see how they 
have captivated minds and cast them into poverty. Bravo to the efforts of 
freedom-loving modern science, which has overturned tyrannous Greek phi-
losophy with all its four walls. This means that it is certain that the key to the 
evidences of the Qur’an’s verses’ miraculousness and the discloser of the 
secrets of eloquence are to be taken only from the mine of Arabic rhetoric, 1 
not from the workbench of Greek philosophy. 

Brother! The desire to uncover the mysteries has brought us this far, and 
we have drawn you along with us. We have annoyed you. And we know that 
you’re very weary. Yet I want to take you on a tour of the Element of Rheto-

to the Qur’an’s miraculous inimitability  (   i ’ j ā z   ) . But beware, don’t let the 
obscure style and wretchedness of the matters’ dress put you off. For what 
makes it complicated is the ﬁneness and value of the meanings. And what 
makes it wretched and disdainful of outward adornment, is the meanings’ 
essential beauty. 

The  dowries  of  delicate  creatures  who  feign  reluctance  and  disdain  is 
their ﬁnesse, and their alighting place is the centre of the heart. The dress I 
have clothed them in is contrary to the fashion of the times, for I was raised 
in the high mountains known as the school of Kurdistan and have not grown 
accustomed to à   l a   Tu r c a  tailoring. Also, a person’s style represents his per-
sonality. And as you see or have heard, I am a riddle that is difﬁcult to solve.

The First Matter

The First Matter 
History teaches us regretfully that when, attracted by the Arabs’ rule the 
non-Arabs intermingled with them, the non-Arabs both confused Qur’anic 
eloquence, known as the natural speech of the Mudarī, 1 and, although nov-
ices, when they adopted the art of Arabic rhetoric, they changed rhetorical 
taste from composition following the meanings, which is the natural course 
of  ideas  and  essence  of  eloquence,  into  composition  based  on  the  words 
themselves. As follows: 

The natural channel for ideas and emotions is the ordering of the mean-
ings  expressed.  The  arrangement  of  the  meanings  is  constructed  ﬁrmly 
through the rules of logic. Logic progresses step by step towards truths. And 
thought  reaches  truths  when  it  penetrates  the  subtleties  of  the  natures  of 
things (   m â h i y a t   ) . The subtleties of the essences of things are derived from 

1.  This refers to the Arabic spoken by the tribe, Muḍar, whose speech in that era was 
reputed to be the most eloquent and whose dialect was favoured when differences arose on 
the Qur’an being put down in writing.

and  reinforce  the  world’s    perfect  order.  Within  the  perfect  order  resides 
sheer beauty, the source of all beauty. And sheer beauty is the garden of the 
elegant and reﬁned sayings that are the ﬂowers of eloquence. This ﬂower-
ﬁlled garden is where the nightingales wander who are known as the poets 
and lovers of blooms. And what imparts to the sweet, soft songs of those 
nightingales their spiritual harmony is the meanings’ arrangement. But while 
this was the case, the non-Arab newcomers, spongers, and novices tried to 
enter the ranks of the literary masters of Arabic rhetoric, and the matter went 
off the rails. For a nation’s temperament is the source of its emotions and 
its  language  reﬂects  those  emotions.  Just  as  the  temperaments  of  nations 
differ,  so  does  the  rhetorical  capacity  of  their  languages  differ,  especially 
a  grammatical  language  like  Arabic.  It  was  due  to  this  that  because  they 
turned from the ordering of the meanings, the natural channel of ideas, to 
the ordering of the words, which is much too deﬁcient, dry, and infertile to 
be the channel for the ﬂow of ideas and garden for the ﬂowers of eloquence, 
they threw rhetoric into disorder. For the newcomers, due to ill choice or 
driven by need, and because they had need to learn the words’ literal mean-
ings and their positioning and enhancement, and because since the words are 
channels, they are easier, clearer, and more familiar to the superﬁcial view, 
and more suitable for popular display and drawing the people’s attention, the 
newcomers expended all their efforts on the words. That is to say, however 
much they progressed, they kept their minds from becoming immersed in 
the ordering of the meanings before them, which may reveal dazzling vistas, 
and wandered around chasing the words.

After  imagining  the  meanings,  their  ideas  bifurcated  on  pursuing  the 
words. Using mere words, these by degrees came to predominate over the 
meanings,  and  since  the  natural  function  of  words,  serving  the  meanings, 
was  reversed,  a  vast  distance  opened  up  between  true  eloquence  and  the 
art of those word-worshipping braggarts, or rather, their artiﬁciality. If you 
wish, consider a literary genius like a l - Ḥ a r ī r ī ; 1 take a look at his M a q ā m ā t : 
he was  defeated by his passion for words and this stained his ﬁne writing. So 
too he was imitated by the word-worshippers and was responsible for sub-
sequent developments. So to cure the illness, the renowned ‘Abd al-Qāhir 
ﬁlled a third of his D a l ā ’ i l   a l - I ‘ j ā z  and Asrār al-Balāgha 2 with his remedies. 
Yes, the passion for words is an illness, but it is not known as such.

Note

Just as the passion for words is an illness, so too through its excesses the 
passion for literary forms, styles, similes, imaginings, and rhyme becomes 
an  illness,  each  type  of  which  sacriﬁces  the  meaning  for  itself.  For  some 
witty point even, or for the sake of the rhyme, many literary ﬁgures immedi-
ately offend against propriety. Writing should be embellished, but on condi-
tion it is natural to its meaning; and the form expressing the meaning should 
be made imposing, but on condition permission is sought from the meaning; 
and the style should be made brilliant, but on condition the relationship with 
its purpose is taken into consideration and it consents to it; and the imagi-
nation should be allowed to roam and to sparkle, but on condition it is not 
detrimental to reality and is not burdensome, and is a simile for reality and 
seeks assistance from reality.

The Second Matter

The Second Matter 
Speech springs to life and burgeons when, by embodying meanings and 
breathing spirit into inanimate things, it is infused with conversation and dis-
cussion. It is like this: built on a fanciful sophistry proceeding from the con-
vention called juxtaposition (   d e v e r a n   )  according to which two things, one 
existent and the other non-existent, are supposed to be the cause and source 
of each other on their being associated, thus making one another speak. With 
the rhetorical magic produced by the power of imagination this animates the 
inanimate like a magician. It also embodies meanings, and gives them life 
and vital warmth. 

If you wish, enter the following lines, which worthily evoke the idea of 

a noisy house:

That is, “ the breaking of a promise addresses me from beneath the delayed 
restitution of my right. It tells me not to be deceived, for which reason hope 
and despair have begun to struggle in my heart; they are destroying the heav-
ing house that is my breast. ” You can see how with his magic the poet has 
breathed  life  into  the  verse  by  embodying  the  hope  and  despair,  and  has 
represented the conﬂict and dissension caused by the broken promise. As in 
a dream, these lines appear to one’s mind like a ﬁlm. Yes, such rhetorical 
magic is hypnotic in a way.

That is, it complains to the rain on its late arrival, then absorbs its waters as 
though from the mouth of its beloved. These lines conjure up in the imagina-
tion the image of Majnun as the earth and the clouds as Layla, do they not?

What beautiﬁes these verses is their imaginary subjects being somewhat 
close to reality. For when the rains are late, the earth makes a cracking sound 
and  absorbs  the  rainwater.  One  who  observes  this  will  think  of  the  rain’s 
belatedness and the earth’s intense need, which, by exercising the power of 
imagination and employing the famous device of juxtapositioning, will take 
on the form of love-making and conversation.

The Third Matter

It is imperative that a seed of truth be present in every fanciful idea. 
The Third Matter 
The garment in which speech is clothed, or its beauty and form, lie in its 
manner of expression (   ü s l û b   ) ; that is, in its mould or framework (   k a l ı p   ) . 
It is like this: [ the speaker’s ] inclinations arise in the imagination due to the 
cross-pollination of his perceptions or preoccupations or contacts or work. 
The  manner  of  expression,  which  is  illuminated  and  takes  form  from  the 
joining of the pieces of the parabolic metaphor (   i s t i a r e - i   t e m s i l i y e   )  which 
in turn is composed of the facets of those inclinations, is both the speech’s 
mould, and the source of its beauty and workbench of its ﬁne garment. As 
though, on the sounding of the will, which deserves to be called the intel-
lect’s bugle, the meanings reposing in the dark corners of the heart emerge 
bare-footed and bare-headed and enter the imagination, where forms reside. 
In the store of the imagination they don whichever form they ﬁnd there. At 
least they tie a kerchief around their heads, or put on a slipper, or at least pin 
on a bauble, and emerge. Or at least they show through a button or a word 
where they have been raised.

If you study some speech, but one that has deviated from its nature, you 
will  see  through  the  mirror-like  manner  of  expression,  the  speaker,  who 
expresses things in line with his own art. Even, if you form an image of him 
from his breathing and his voice and you imagine his temperament and art

on regaining your appetite you wish to see how the pure water of meaning 
in the phial of reality known as the manner of expression, is appropriate for 
you and how it agrees with you, and you have appetite for that pure water, go 
to the tavern and ask the taverner what eloquent speech is. He will tell you 
that eloquent speech is what is cooked in the cauldrons of knowledge – the 
elegant water-bearers swill around the water of life which stands in the jars 
of wisdom and is ﬁltered through understanding, and imbibe ideas – speech 
which, pervading the innermost faculties, excites the emotions.

If you do not ﬁnd such drunkard’s words agreeable, listen to the news 
brought from Saba’ by Solomon’s Hoopoe, a deviser of water-works. See 
how it describes the All-Glorious One Who sent down the Qur’an and cre-
ated the heavens and earth. The Hoopoe says:

perfection [ the Qur’an ] chose only the above-mentioned, which alludes to 
the Hoopoe’s water-divining.

Indication

What I intend by the manner of expression (   ü s l û b   )  is the form of speech 
and its mould (   k a l ı p   ) . Others say otherwise. Its rhetorical value is its bring-

intention,  in  accordance  with  the  rule,  “ If  something  is  established,  it  is 
established together with its corollaries, ” is, by prompting a part, to invigor-
ate the whole of the story. As though, by the speaker pointing out a corner 
of his expression (   ü s l û b   ) , his addressee will himself be able to see all of it, 
if only faintly.

I n   S h o r t :   Mutual  response  and  co-operation  are  necessary  so  that  the 
form  of  the  speech’s  aim,  which  is  traced  on  the  mind’s  networks  by  the 
view of reason, should not be confused. 

Indication

Order emerges from this point, from which proportion is born and beauty 
and elegance shine. If you wish, ponder over the word of the Lord of Dig-
nity. Consider, for instance, the verse, 

It was revealed to induce fear of punishment an atom of which crushes like

a huge boulder and to show how anxious and querulous is man. In accord-
ance with the rhetorical rule of ‘causing a thing to be reﬂected through its 
opposite,’ it wants to illustrate the severity of a small amount of punishment 
in order to scare, so every part of the verse reaches out and reinforces the 
basic aim, which is littleness or fewness. As follows:

The  words,  ْنِا  signify  doubt,  and  doubt  looks  to  littleness  or  fewness. 
The word  ْت َ
ّ(cid:127)َ(cid:174) means to touch lightly and expresses a small amount. And 
just as the word 0 is merely a whiff, so is it in the singular form. Gram-
matically it is a m a ṣ d a r   m a r r a  and signiﬁes once. Also the t a n w ī n  indicating 
indeﬁniteness in 0 expresses littleness or fewness and means it is so 
insigniﬁcant it can scarcely be known. The word 1 signiﬁes division or a 
part; it means a bit and indicates paucity. The word 2 points to a light 
sort of punishment in relation to chastisement (   n a k ā l   )  and suggests a small 
amount. And by alluding to mercy the word 3 indicates littleness or few-
ness. If the small amount of punishment suggested in all this paucity is such, 
Allah protect us from what is greater.

Warning

This  is  a  pattern  or  model  for  you;  if  you  know  calligraphy,  you  can 
copy it out, for all the Qur’anic verses display the same order, proportion, 
and beauty. However, the aims are sometimes overlapping and in unbroken 
succession; the one that follows the previous is connected with the next, but 
they are not mixed up. You have to study them carefully, for a superﬁcial 
reading may lead to much confusion. 

The Fifth Matter

The Fifth Matter 
Just as the manner in which a speech is composed (   s u r e t - i   t e r k i b   )  indi-
cates the speech’s main aim; so too the allusions of its secondary meanings 
and of its styles indicate the speech’s subsidiary aims and purport, and enli-
ven it; it is in these that the speech’s richness and scope lie. For allusions and 
hints are a powerful source stimulating slumbering imaginings and by excit-
ing their silent aspects, elicit praise and appreciation in the furthest corners 
of the heart. Yes, hints and allusions are for promenading and beholding the 
sides of the path; they are not for purposeful demanding and disposal. This 
means that the speaker is not answerable for them. If you wish, enter into the 
following lines, for they contain points worthy of note.

(cid:243)َ(cid:281)ْ(cid:300)ا َو ُر ْ(cid:239)َ(cid:277)ْ(cid:292)ا 

If you do not want to go far off, take a look at what preceded this Article 
(   M a k a l e   ) ; you will ﬁnd many pieces which are examples of this. For exam-
ple, “ The key to the evidences for the verses’ inimitability and the discloser 
of  the  secrets  of  eloquence  are  [ derived ]  only  from  Arabic  rhetoric.  Not 
from Greek philosophy. ” Or take a look at the Indication in the Conclusion 
of  the  First  Matter  of  the  First  Article.  Thus:  “ The  code  of  natural  laws 
(   ş e r i a t - ı   f ı t r i y y e   )  ruled that the ecstatic guest, the globe of the earth, should 
remain in the ranks of the stars that follow the sun and should not quit them. 
For together with its spouse, the earth declared: ( 41: 11 ) Â  Á  À . As 
for  obedient  worship,  it  is  worthier  in  conjunction  with  the  community. ” 
These examples point to such levels before and beyond them that beyond 
them, further levels appear faintly.

The Sixth Matter

The Sixth Matter 
As for the fruits of speech, they are the meanings obtained on various 
levels in various forms. Thus: as is known by those familiar with chemistry, 
when some matter, for example an element (   u n s u r   )  like gold is produced, 
it is passed through various machines and pipes with their sedimentation, 
and assumes various forms at various stages. Finally, an amount is obtained 
from  it.  Like  a  reduced  photograph  taken  with  a  camera  and  comprising 
various meanings, called speech, various ideas take form is this way: 

By  some  of  the  heart’s  sensitivities  being  stimulated  by  outside  inﬂu-
ences, inclinations arise. As a consequence, empty meanings  impinge on 
the intellect’s view, and turn it towards themselves. Then with some of those 
steam-like meanings condensing, a number of inclinations and ideas are sus-
pended, while the intellect shows an interest in others since they are distilled 
into  droplets.  Then  since  some  of  those  that  are  liquid  solidify,  the  intel-
lect  includes  them  in  speech.  Then  since  some  of  the  solidiﬁed  meanings 
take on a form and manifestation through a particular depiction, the intellect 
presents the meanings with a particular ﬁgure in accordance with their stat-
ure. That is to say, those thus distinguished are assimilated in the particular 

ْ
َ
82

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

form of the speech. Those that do not solidify are handed to its general tenor 
and import. And those that are not reproduced are assigned to the speech’s 
implications.  Those  that  are  not  distilled  are  handed  over  to  the  speech’s 
allusions, and those that are not condensed assist the speech’s effectiveness 
through the speaker’s attitude which accompanies the speech.

Thus, of the pipes of this sequence, the one named, and the verb’s mean-
ing, and what is indicated by the letters, and contained in the ordering, and 
understood by the whole, and alluded to by the style, and referred to by 
what is denoted, are the stimuli arising from the speaker’s attitudes which 
escort  the  speech.  So  too,  what  is  intended  by  the  literal  meanings,  the 
allusive meanings, the analogical meanings, the necessary meanings, and 
others, all come together from the sequence’s different levels and emerge 
from this mine.

If you would like to observe this, take a look at your own conscience; you 

will see the levels, as follows: 

If,  sometime,  the  rays  and  ﬂashes  of  your  beloved’s  beauty  shine  on 
your conscience through window of your eyes, the searing ﬁre of passion 
will  suddenly  ﬂare  up.  On  the  emotions  swelling,  hopes  and  desires  will 
be ﬁred also, and because those hopes will pierce the ceiling of the imagi-
nation on the upper ﬂoor, calling for help; and because in the treasury  of 
imagination, ranged in rank they hold the beloved’s beauties in their hands 
or picture them on bringing them to mind, the imaginings, sated with the 
loveliness of  others, hasten to the aid of those hopes. Together they assault, 
and together descending from imagination to tongue, the beloved’s beauties 
cause thirst for the water of union from behind them, and on the right grief 
at separation, on the left yearning to exalt and extol, before them mercy and 
kindness, and to take in their hands the necklace of compliment and pearls 
of rapture. In so doing they evince the need to describe her virtues, which 
draw the water of union, so to extinguish the ﬁre, which may be depicted as,

are undaunted, take a look at the awesome consciences of Ibn al-Fāriḍ 1 and

compassion, they point out many tender imaginings from the mass of feel-
ings that excite the emotions.

Indication

In the working of any government, the ofﬁcials should all be given wages 
commensurate with their capabilities, duties, and functions. Similarly, the 
muddle of meanings proceeding from the various levels of speech should 
be distinguished from one another fairly and carefully, appropriately to their 
dues,  and  proportionately  to  their  closeness  to  the  general  aim,  purpose, 
and intention. Then from the proportion proceeding from the order, which 
results from that balance, and from the agreeable harmony proceeding from 
the proportionateness, and from the beauty of the relationships proceeding 
from the harmony, a ﬁne balance may emerge to achieve the speech’s per-
fection. Otherwise those who should serve yet have puerile natures become 
conceited and in their conceit, confuse the relationships and spoil the order. 
This means that the capabilities of the parts of speech should be borne in 
mind. Yes, each should be promoted in accordance with its abilities. It is 
clear that however beautiful a member like an eye or nose may be, if it is 
smaller or bigger than it should be, it renders the whole ugly.

Note

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

Sometimes  a  lowly  private  may  perform  a  task,  for  example,  discover 
the  enemy’s  secrets,  that  a  ﬁeld  marshall  could  not  perform.  Or  a  young 
student may carry out some task that an eminent scholar could not perform. 
For an eminent person is not necessarily eminent in everything. Everyone 
is eminent or proﬁcient in his own profession. Similarly, among conﬂicting 
meanings,  a  minor  meaning  may  govern  and  gain  value.  For  its  function 
has importance due to some future cause. The thrust of the speech is thus 
because  the  explicit  meaning  lacks  competence.  For  it  is  either  clear  and 
obvious, or it is tenuous and slight, and adds nothing to the main aim of the 
speech. Or there is no addressee to greet it favourably and accept and heed 
it. Or it is neither in agreement with the speaker’s state of mind nor does 
it serve the impulse which prompted the speech. Or it appears alien to its 
context and implications. Or it lacks the ability to preserve its aim and pro-
cure its necessities. This means that at each level only one of these causes is 
heeded. Nevertheless, if they unite, they raise the speech to the highest level. 

Conclusion

Conclusion

There are some suspended meanings which have no deﬁned form or par-
ticular domicile. They can enter all the bureaux like inspectors. Sometimes 
they assume a word particular to themselves. They are ephemeral, signiﬁca-
tive  meanings.  They  draw  other  words  into  themselves  and  absorb  them. 
Sometimes they penetrate a sentence or a story even. If such a sentence is 
pressed,  the  meaning  may  be  distilled  from  it;  such  meanings  as  longing, 
desire, self-praise, regret, and so on.

The Seventh Matter

The Seventh Matter 
The source of vitality in rhetoric, or to put in another way, the philosophy 
of ﬁgurative speech or the purpose (   h i k m e t   )  of poetry is their representing 
the laws and measures of the outside world. Like this: the source of their 
vitality and art is their situating the laws of external truths in notional situ-
ations  by  means  of  parabolic  analogies  and  juxtapositioning  and  fanciful 
depictions. They show like a mirror the rays of reality reﬂected from outside, 
as though imitating creation and nature with their own imaginative art and 
literary embellishments. Yes, even if speech cannot be reality, it can at least 
seek assistance from its similitudes and order, and can sprout from its seed. 
But all seeds produce their own seedlings; a wheat-grain cannot grow into 
a tree. If the science of ﬁgurative speech is disregarded, rhetoric yields no 
beneﬁts other than arousing wonder in the listener, like tales about fantastic 
monsters.

SECOND ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF RHETORIC

85

Like the science of ﬁgurative speech, grammar has a philosophy, and 
that  philosophy  makes  known  the  wisdom  and  purpose  of    the  one  who 
instituted it. It is founded on the famous rules (   m ü n â s e b a t   )  mentioned in 
the grammar books. For instance, a word cannot be governed by two other 
different words. The interrogative particle ‘hal’ will not wait patiently on 
seeing the verb, but desires to join with it. Also, the doer (   f ā ‘ i l   )  is power-
ful; it seizes for itself the nominative vowel point ‘u’(   ḍ a m m a   ) , which is 
strong. Each is a reﬂection and similitude of the laws in force in the uni-
verse and external world.

Note

The  manifest  wisdom  in  these  rules  of  grammar  and  syntax  has  great 
value, even if it is less than that of the science of ﬁgurative speech. In short: 
the rules transform the transmitted sciences  (   u l û m - u   n a k l i y e   ) , established 
through induction, into rational sciences (   u l û m - u   a k l i y e   ) . 

The Eighth Matter

The Eighth Matter 
With the ﬁgurative meanings being grafted and fecundated and the signi-
ﬁcations being transposed and transformed, the true meaning absorbs either 
the aim or one of the suspended meanings and draws it to itself. For when 
either of them enters into it, it is changed into the truth and fundament. The 
meaning, which is the word’s true owner, assumes a vital form, and assists 
it, and seeks help from the secondary meanings. It is because of this that a 
single word may have numerous meanings. The transpositions and fecunda-
tions arise from this. Anyone who neglects this point, loses out on a signiﬁ-
cant point of eloquence.

Note

Whichever of these concentric meanings touches more on your aim and 
is closer to your purpose, advance it and impart it and make the others cor-
roborate it. Your manner of expression will otherwise lack impressiveness 
and be devoid of rhetorical embellishment. 

The Ninth Matter

The Ninth Matter 
The  highest  degree  of  eloquence,  which  confounds  the  faculty  of  will 
and simple conceptions, is by the aims, which are one within the other yet 
in sequence, being numerous; and the inferences, which are interconnected, 
being in succession; and the basic intentions, which produce a single result, 
coming together; and the many branches comprising different fruits, or hav-
ing the potential to produce them. It is like this: 

Breadth  and  grandeur  are  imparted  to  speech  when  the  aims  that  have 
departed from and are furthest from the ultimate aim are interconnected and 
they complete each other’s deﬁciences and fulﬁl their duties to their neigh-
bours.  It  is  as  though  when  one  of  the  aims  is  positioned,  so  is  the  next 
positioned, then the next and the next, and so on. With their relations being 
observed in every respect to the right and left, together the aims found the 
well-constructed palace of the speech; as though they have consulted and 
employed many intelligences to assist their own; as if each of the clusters 
of  aims  is  an  element  participating  in  the  interconnected  representations. 
Just as if an artist puts a black spot on a picture overlying other pictures, the 
spot will be an eye in one of the pictures, a mole on the face in another, a 
nostril in another one, and a mouth in another; so too are there such points 
in elevated speech. 

S e c o n d   P o i n t :  With compound and branching analogies, the aims mul-
tiply successively.  1 As though the speaker is pointing to the aim’s con-
tinuance  and  a  natural  history  of  its  increase.  For  example,  the  world  is 
beautiful, which means its Maker is wise; He does nothing in vain, wastes

logism. This is a multi-premise syllogism – a string of any number of propositions forming 
together a sequence of syllogisms, such that the conclusion of each syllogism, together 
with the next proposition, is a premise for the next, and so on.

nothing, nor neglects the potentialities of anything. Therefore, He will per-
petually  perfect  the  world’s  order.  He  will  not  condemn  human  beings 
to non-existence, which is harrowing, intolerable, eternal separation, for 
eternal separation destroys all hope and perfections. There will therefore 
be everlasting happiness.

The above is a good example of the third aspect of difference between 
man and the animals in the discussion on general prophethood in the intro-
duction to the second part of the profession of faith in the Third Article.

T h e   T h i r d   P o i n t  puts together and mentions a number of fundamentals 
(   u s û l   )  that produce a single result. For even if each fundamental (   a s l   )  is 
not intentionally and itself linked to some elevated result, it at least provokes 
it and causes it to emerge. As though the exempliﬁcations, which are called 
fundamentals, indicate the aim’s abstract loftiness, caused by the mirrors’ 
difference and the sameness of the result and what is shown, and indicate 
too the conjoining of the vital power of the speech with the truth known as 
universal life, or the general motion called the life of the world. The First 
Aim of the Third Aim at the end of the Third Article is an example of this. 
Another example is furnished by the Indication, Guidance, Note and Judge-
ment in the Fourth Matter and Way of the Third Article.

Yes, if attention is paid to the Lord of Glory’s Word, this truth is seen 
to shine everywhere like light. Indeed, with all its elements combining like 
light in its corners and crossroads, this truth causes the pure water of elo-
quence to pour forth. Curses upon those literalists who ignoring it, call it

F o u r t h   Tr u t h :  This is to mould and shape the speech in such a way that it 
comprises the seeds of numerous branches, is the source of numerous state-
ments, and indicates numerous meanings and different aspects. As though, 
since the speech holds such a potentiality, this truth alludes to its power to 
grow and the abundance of its produce. As if all those branches and aspects 
crowd  together  in  the  matter  so  as  to  balance  the  virtues  and  ﬁne  points, 
direct each branch towards an aim and lay a duty on each aspect.

Yes, Moses’ staff is more useful than the proverbial staff in the famous 
tale. 1 The staff in the story still found a use, however much it was split up, 
just like the story of Moses. It was owing to this that the Qur’an took the 
story with the shining white hand of its miraculous exposition and exhibited 
it in many different forms. It employed every side of it brilliantly so that the 
magicians of the science of rhetoric (   b e y a n   )  prostrated before it in wonder-
ment and love. 

Brother! With these literary styles, the elusive eloquence of this matter 
depicts  for  you  a  tree  of  reality  with  vast  intertwining  roots,  well  placed 
nodes,  interwoven  branches,  and  diverse  fruits.  Take  a  look  at  the  Sixth 
Matter if you wish, for even if poorly arranged, it illustrates this matter to a 
degree. 

Note and Apology

Brother! I know that this Article appears to be quite obscure to you. But 
what can I do? The mark of premises and preliminaries is conciseness and 
abbreviation. It will be made clear to you in the three books. 2

The Tenth Matter

The Tenth Matter 
The ﬂuency of speech is achieved by not complicating matters or entirely 
eschewing feelings; but by imitating nature, representing the outside world, 
appositely following the drift of what is intended, and making the main aim 
distinct. For it will mar the ﬂuency to push forward in speech and combine 
with others without fully addressing the emotions. 

One should beware of disorderly complications and progress gradually 

with the consecutive meanings. 

Furthermore, one should be a student of nature in applying imaginative 

art so to reﬂect the natural laws in the art. 

Also, one should make one’s conceptualisations imitate the outside world 
and be similar to it in form. If they were to escape from the brain and become 
embodied  outside  it,  the  beings  outside  would  annex  them  and  not  reject

their progeny. They would say: “ They’re mine! ”, or “ It’s as though they 
are, ” or “ they’re my offspring. ” 

Also, one has to be apt and to the point so that the drift and ﬂow are not 
impeded and what is intended does not become disparate and deviate to left 
and  right.  The  sides  should  not  absorb  the  power  of  the  aim  so  lessening 
its import. Indeed, with their freshness and pleasantness the corners should 
assist the aim like a pool. 

Also, to ensure the ﬂuency, the main aim should be made distinct and 

The Eleventh Matter

where the subsidiary aims come together, speciﬁed. 
The Eleventh Matter 
The integrity and correctness of speech are obtained by its proving the 
proposition together with its necessary consequences and conditioning prec-
edents and means of defence. It is like this: so as not to impair the necessary 
consequences  or  disturb  the  proposition’s  equanimity  and  to  seek  vitality 
from the precedents and have recourse to them, the speech has to be girded 
with parts that will reply to implicit questions and the assaults of nagging 
objections. That is to say, speech is a fruit-bearing tree; it is decked out with 
thorns  and  bayonets  to  protect  it  from  abuse  and  fruit-thieves.  As  though 
the  devils  of  delusions  cannot  share  in  listening  to  that  speech  since  it  is 
the elevated result of many debates and is the substance of much thought 
and reasoning; they cannot look on it malevolently. As though the speaker 
has raised up walls all around it, considering its six sides. That is, placing 
defenders against the assaults of misapprehensions by reinforcing the sub-
ject and predicate, and the adjectives, or at other strategic points, so decking 
it out from top to bottom with parts that reply to implicit questions. If you 
would like an example of this, the whole of this book provides a lengthy one. 
The Third Article is an especially ﬁne example of it.
The Twelfth Matter 
Speech may be correct and be honed and moderate by allotting each part 
its right and due and clothing it in the appropriate style. Also, if recounting 
a tale, the speaker should put himself in the place of the one recounted. That 
is, if he is describing another’s feelings and thoughts, he should enter into 
that person, visit his heart as a guest, and speak with his tongue. While if 
he is directing his own affairs, he should dispense justice by allotting care 
and attention, the sign of worth, taking into account the right, capacity, and 
rank of each part, and should fashion the garment of the literary styles and 
devices in accordance with the disposition of each. Then  each of the aims 

The Twelfth Matter

90

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

will acquire a striking beauty from the style that is appropriate to it. For there 
are three basic styles or modes of speech:

T h e   F i r s t  is a sheer or detached style, like the uncomplicated style of the 

works of Sayyid Sharīf 1 and Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī. 2

T h e   S e c o n d   is  the  embellished  style,  like  the  brilliant,  shining  style  of 

‘Abd al-Qāhir’s D a l ā ’ i l   a l - I ‘ j ā z  and A s r ā r   a l - B a l ā g h a .  3

T h e   T h i r d  is the high style, like some of the majestic writing  (   k e l â m   )  
of al-Sakkākī, 4 al-Zamakhsharī, 5 and Ibn Sīnā. 6 Or like the Arabic pieces 
in the Turkish translation of this book, especially the disorderly yet sound 
pieces  in  the  Third  Article.  For  the  loftiness  of  the  subject  fashioned  this 
book in the high style; the inﬂuence of my own skills has been negligible.

I n   S h o r t :  When speaking of theological matters and the principles of reli-
gion and describing them, you should not depart from the high style, which 
comprises intensity, power, and grandeur. 

When engaged in oratory and persuasion, never give up the embellished 
style if you can, which is ornamented and brilliant and both encourages and 
alarms. But you should not be pretentious, artiﬁcial, or vulgarly ostentatious. 
When  engaged  in  business,  discussions,  or  the  instrumental  sciences, 
make do with the detached style, which is characterised by its faithfulness, 
conciseness,  correctness,  ﬂuency,  and  naturalness,  and  displays  its  innate 
beauty through its simplicity. 

T h e   C o n c l u s i o n   o f   t h i s   M a t t e r :  Speech may be self-sufﬁcient,  independ-
ent, and ardent when the style is not sought outside the context. It is like this: 
when you want to fashion a literary style commensurate with the meaning’s 
stature, it should at least be pieced together with parts necessitated by the 
subject or story that the speech comprises or its art and be sourced from the 
subject’s factory, and it should be sewn in a style out of the pieces of the 
secondary meanings. It will certainly add power to the speech if, as long as 
there is no need, you don’t ﬁx your gaze beyond and you boycott the outside 
– if the expression’s not mistaken, for this is one of the main ways to prevent

your wealth being dissipated. In this way, both meaning and context and art 
may assist what the speech alludes to with its arrangement. Just as speech 
indicates the meaning through its manner of composition, so does the style 
or mode point through itself to the meaning. If you would like an example, 
take a look at the Arabic pieces in the Ninth Matter.

Take  a  look  at  the  prefaces  of  the  books  on  the  instrumental  sciences; 
even if their rhetorical eloquence is not overly subtle and elegant, their intro-
ductory lines furnish good introductions to this truth. Also, in the preface 
of this book when alluding to miracles, our Prophet’s ( UWBP ) person is 
shown to be a miracle of his prophethood. Also, in the preface of the Third 
Article, the two parts of the profession of faith are shown to testify to each 
other. Also, in the Seventh Premise it is said to those who added to the Split-
ting of the Moon that it descended to the earth: “ You’ve been the cause of 
the moon of the miracle being eclipsed and a sun-like proof of prophethood 
being  obscured! ”  Making  analogies,  you  can  ﬁnd  numerous  examples  of 
this truth in this book. For like myself, its way is to  boycott the outside. 
Indeed, as long as it is not necessary, it is to boycott ideas, matters, exam-
ples, and styles. But there may be coincidences, for the truth is one. You will 
see the same thing, whatever door you enter by.
Conclusion 
It has been said that one should look to what is said, not to the one who 
said it. But I say: Who said it? To whom did they say it? In what context did 
they say it? For what reason did they say it? In respect of eloquence these 
should be considered as well as what is said; indeed, this is of the utmost 
importance. 

Conclusion

Indication

It should be known that according to eloquence, the features of the sci-
ences of  M a ‘ ā n ī   ( the semantics of syntax ) and  B a y ā n  ( ﬁgurative speech ) 
are dependent on your showing your aim and purpose by planting signs and

allusions indicating them. For randomness renders them worthless. While 
the science of B a d ī ‘  ( the embellishment of speech ) and verbal ornamenta-
tion (   t e z y i n a t - ı   l a f z i y y e   )  are dependent on chance and the lack of intention, 
or to be close to the true meaning as though by chance. 

It is no secret that the most penetrating of instruments that points to exter-
nal truths and fastens a mental proposition to the external law, and if one 
may say so, rends the veil and discloses the truth behind it, is the intensive 
particle َ

the Qur’an.

Allusion

Note

Brother! You should not be misled by the subtle laws described in this 
article standing aloof from these wretched styles of mine and their disliking 
them. For instance, one should not think that if the laws had been good, they 
would have given a good lesson in rhetoric to the person who included them, 
and they would have donned a ﬁne style. But the person who included them 
is illiterate and his  style of writing is wretched too. But don’t get carried 
away  imagining  this,  for  all  those  knowledgeable  about  a  science  are  not 
necessarily expert in it. Moreover, the power of attraction, which is centrip-
etal, prevails over the power of repulsion, which is centrifugal. For the ear 
is near the brain and close to the intellect, whereas the heart, the source of 
speech, is distant from the tongue and a stranger to it. Also, very often the 
tongue does not understand the heart’s tongue. Especially if the heart tintin-
nabulates from the depths of some matter, like from the bottom of a well, the 
tongue will not hear it at all, so how could it interpret it? 

I n   S h o r t :  It is easier to understand than to make understood, and that’s 

that!

Just as these lofty words are the very fundament of Islam, so, ﬂying over 
the  universe,  are  they  its  most  luminous  and  lofty  banner.  With  the  pre-
eternal  covenant,  belief,  our  oath  and  pledge,  was  written  on  this  sacred 
proclamation. Yes, Islam, the water of life, ﬂows forth from the life-giving 
spring of these words. This proclamation is a pre-eternal decree given to the 
hands of humankind, which, destined for eternity, is awarded the good news 
of  everlasting  happiness.  It  is  a  lucent  chart  proclaiming  the  Pre-Eternal 
Monarch with its luminous image taken by the camera of the dominical sub-
tle faculty called the heart, which is seated in its window facing the unseen 
worlds. It is the heart’s eloquent interpreter. Yes, it is the eloquent orator 
deputed to declaim before the universe the conscience’s mysterious, expres-
sive  address.  It  is  an  eternal  banner  in  the  hands  of  the  tongue,  the  lucid 
herald of belief, which proclaims the Pre-Eternal Sovereign to the universe.

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

The principal beliefs of the Islamic religion and their truths are proved 
and explicated in all their details in the books on Islam, and are there to 
be  seen.  Since  to  point  out  what  may  be  seen  obscures  the  obvious  or 
infers  the  stupidity  of  the  one  addressed  and  his  ignorance,  I  am  going 
to expound only three or four elements of those beliefs, and for the other 
truths refer readers to the books of the authoritative scholars. For they have 
left no need for me. 

Premise

It is known by the heedful and attentive that, in short, the Qur’an has four 
[ main ] aims: proof of the Single Maker, prophethood, the resurrection of 
the body, and justice.

T h e   F i r s t   A i m   explicates  evidences  (   d e l â i l   )   of  the  Maker.  One  proof 
(   b ü r h a n   )  of Him is Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). The 
Maker’s existence and unity are beyond any need of proof. They are abun-
dantly clear and obvious, especially for Muslims. As a consequence, I have 
directed my address to foreigners, and the Japanese in particular, for at one 
time they asked me some questions and I replied to them. Now I am going 
to recount brieﬂy a part of my answer to only one or two of their questions. 
One of their questions was: 

  ٍء ْيَ(cid:130)  ّ

ِىَا  ْنِ(cid:174) ُقْ(cid:171)َ(cid:115)ْ(cid:170)اَو ِهْ(cid:193)َ(cid:170)ِا اَ(cid:179)َ(cid:178)وُ(cid:150) ْدَ(cid:98) ي ِذَ

That is to say: Is there clear proof of the Maker’s existence?

words such as these. It is therefore to be hoped that any ambiguity in what I 
have to say will be excused.

Note

The purpose of the following discussion is to point out the way to employ 
the reason and to weigh up matters so that the truth may become manifest in 
the whole. For, due to the mind’s particularity,  if one seeks the conclusion 
of the whole in every part of it, it causes the surmising faculty to beset one 
and obscures the truth with its delusive notions amid uncertainties.

Premise

If you can comply with my conditions by restraining yourself from such 
things as the desire to oppose and taking the part of the opposer and consid-
ering  yourself  excused  when  ascribing  baseless  misgivings  to  some  other 
person in order to justify yourself, and from seeing only faults like a cus-
tomer, and making excuses like children, then listen to the following with 
an easy heart. 

The First Aim

The First Aim 
All the atoms in existence, while hesitant as regards essence, attributes 
and  other  aspects  amid  innumerable  possibilities,  take  one  way  which 
results  in  wondrous  beneﬁts,  thus  testifying  to  the  necessary  existence  of 
the Maker. This lights up from the subtle inner faculties of man – which are 
samples of the worlds of the unseen – the lamp of belief and proclaims the 
Maker. Yes, just as each minute particle on its own proclaims the Maker; 
so too, all particles, by each preserving the balance of the general current 
in  all  its  relationships  at  every  stage  of  the  ascending,  intermingled  com-
pounds of the universe, which resemble concentric circles, and by producing 
different beneﬁcial results with every relationship, recite and proclaim the 
Maker’s  wisdom  and  purpose,  thus  showing  that  proofs  of  the  Maker  far 
exceed atoms in number.

I f   y o u   a s k :  Why doesn’t everyone see this with their minds?
T h e   A n s w e r :  Because of its perfect clarity. Indeed, some things are so 
intensely evident, they reach the degree of invisibility. Like the body of 
the sun.

That  is,  behold  with  the  eye  of  wisdom  the  lines  of  successive  events 
the Pre-Eternal Inscriber has written on the outspread pages of the wide 
world. Embrace the idea of truth, then the continuous missives arriving 
from  the  Sublime  Assembly  may  raise  you  up  to  the  certainty  of  the 
highest of the high.

Indication

By reason of the source of assistance and point of support in his heart, 
man’s  conscience  does  not  forget  the  Maker.  Even  if  his  mind  ceases  to 
work, his conscience does not; it is preoccupied with two important duties. It 
is like this: if one refers to his conscience, [ he will see that ] like the physical 

98

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

heart conveys life to all the parts of the body, knowledge of the Maker, the 
source of the heart’s vitality, spreads life to all his various desires and incli-
nations which arise from his unlimited abilities and potentialities; it affords 
them pleasure and value and expands and extends them. This is the point of 
assistance. 

It  is  also  knowledge  of  the  Maker  which  is  the  only  point  of  support 
against the calamities and troubles of the tumultuous world in which life – 
the ﬁeld of conﬂict and struggle – is constantly under attack. 

Yes, if a person does not believe in the All-Wise Maker and His works, 
all of which are in accordance with wisdom and order, and blindly ascribes 
them to chance, and if he thinks of the total insufﬁciency of his power in 
the face of disaster, he will become more wretched than anything due to the 
resulting  hellish,  piteous  state  comprising  terror,  desolation,  anxiety,  and 
fear, and he will oppose the perfect order and regularity of the universe. This 
is the point of support; yes, his only refuge is knowledge of the Maker. 

This means that since, to be dominant in the world’s order through these 
two points is the exclusive quality of the truth itself, from them the Maker’s 
existence is manifested in the conscience, for they are two windows. Even if 
the intellect does not see this, man’s essential nature does. The conscience is 
the observer and the heart, its window. 

Note

There are four methods by which to ascend to knowledge of the Maker, 

the throne of attainment and perfections: 

T h e   F i r s t  is the way of the Suﬁ mystic-scholars, which is based on puri-

ﬁcation and illumination.

T h e   S e c o n d   is  the  way  of  the  scholars  of  the  science  of  k a l ā m ,  which 
is  based  on  contingency  and  createdness.  For  sure  these  two  ways  have 
branched out from the Qur’an, but since human thought has poured them 
into different moulds, they have acquired lengthy glosses and annotations, 
making them onerous. 

T h e   T h i r d  is the way of the philosophers. 
These three are not free of the assaults of delusive notions. 
As for  T h e   F o u r t h , it is the Qur’anic ascent, which proclaims the lofty 
rank of the Qur’an’s eloquence, and is the shortest and most direct, and in 
respect of clarity is the most comprehensive, embracing all humankind. We 
too have chosen this way. It is of two kinds: 

The First

THIRD ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF DOCTRINE

99

THE FIRST is the proof of divine providence  (   d e l i l - i   i n â y e t   ) . All the 
Qur’anic verses that recount the beneﬁts of things allude to this proof and 
they set it in order. Its essence is the following of beneﬁts and instances of 
wisdom in the universe’s superlative order. This proves the Maker’s wisdom 
and purpose and banishes erroneous ideas about chance.

Premise

Premise

For sure not everyone can perceive through induction the following of 
beneﬁts  and  order  in  the  world  and  not  everyone  can  comprehend  it.  But 
thanks to the meeting of minds among men, a science has been and is being 
formed consisting of the regular, universal laws particular to each species 
and realm of beings in the universe. 

On the other hand, if there is no order in a matter, since the proposi-
tion  (   h ü k ü m   )   will  not  be  in  force  universally,  the  law’s  universality  is 
evidence  for  the  good  order  of  the  species.  This  means  that  by  reason 
of the universality of their laws, through induction the physical sciences 
(   f ü n u n - u   e k v â n   )  are each proofs producing (   i n t â c   )  the perfect order. Yes, 
by showing the beneﬁts and fruits hanging from the links of the chains of 
beings, and the instances of wisdom and advantages hidden in the inter-
twined revolutions of events, all the physical sciences both point to and 
testify to the  Maker’s intention and wisdom, and each is a shooting star 
repulsing devilish delusions.

Indication

If you detach yourself from familiarity, which leads one to view things 
superﬁcially and gives rise to compounded ignorance, and you restrain your 
soul  from  perpetual  argumentation,  the  nest  of  misapprehensions  which 
block up the path to reason; you won’t be able to deceive yourself that the 
wondrous, miniscule, divine machine underlying the form of a microscopic 
organism  came  into  being  out  of  simple,  lifeless,  natural  causes.  For  the 
causes lack intelligence, and their paths and trajectories are unlimited, and 
they possess nothing to cause either their existence or their non-existence, 
and are the objects of that workbench. You won’t be able to convince your-
self  and  feel  assured.  Unless,  after  proving  that  each  atom  possesses  the 
intelligence  of  Plato  and  the  wisdom  of  Galen,  you  believe  that  each  can 
communicate without means with all the other atoms, and you can remove 
the brand of impossibility from the snout of the combining of the powers of 
attraction and repulsion in the smallest indivisible atom, which is like the 
fundament of natural causes.

100

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

If your soul allows the possibility of all these impossibilities, it will erase 
you from the book of humanity. It is permissible, however, that attraction, 
repulsion, and motion, which they suppose to be the basis of everything, are 
each names for the laws of divine practice. We accept them only on condi-
tion the laws neither cease being laws nor become nature, and neither cease 
to be mental nor are given external existence, and neither cease to be theo-
retical nor are supposed to be actual, and neither cease being means nor are 
ascribed an actual effect.

Note

Take a look around the world with the verse,

( 67:3 )  K  J  I  H G  F
Can you see any deﬁciency anywhere? Absolutely not! No one with sight 
can see any. If anyone did, he would have to be either blind or afﬂicted with 
myopia. If you wish, refer to the Qur’an; you will ﬁnd there the proof of 
divine providence in its ﬁnest possible form. For just as it commands reﬂec-
tion on the universe, so it mentions the beneﬁts and recounts the bounties. 
Such verses display the proof of divine providence. In brief it is as above, so 
hold on to it! As for a detailed exposition, if divine will is manifested, it will 
be expounded in the three books 1 which will be bound, by way of explicat-
ing the signs in the outer and inner worlds, to the sciences of the heavens, 
the earth, and humankind. Then this proof will appear to you in its entirety.
THE SECOND QUR’ANIC PROOF is the proof that things are given 
existence out of nothing ( d e l i l - i   i h t i r a ’ ; Ar. i k h t i r ā ‘ ). In summary it is this: 
it is the giving to all the species of creatures and all their members a body 
that will produce the particular works that are planned for those species and 
members, and is appropriate for the perfecting of their innate abilities. For 
no successive species is pre-eternal. Contingency does not permit this. And 
necessarily, the createdness of some things is apparent through observation 
and the createdness of the rest is to seen by the intellect in respect of wisdom 
and purpose. 

The Second Qur’anic Proof

Misapprehension and Note

Truth cannot be turned into its opposite (   i n k ı l a b - ı   h a k i k a t   ) . The chains 
of  intermediate  species  do  not  persist.  The  transformation  or  mutation  of 
classes of beings (   t a h a v v ü l - ü   e s n a f   )  is not the same as the turning of reali-
ties into their opposites.

1.  For the three books see, page 19 fn 1.

THIRD ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF DOCTRINE

101

Indication

Since all species have a progenitor and forefather, the false notion aris-
ing  from  the  reproduction  occurring  in  the  chains  of  beings,  may  not  be 
imputed to those progenitors and forefathers. Yes, according to natural phi-
losophy  and  the  sciences  of  geology,  biology,  and  botany,  the  number  of 
species  exceeds  two  hundred  thousand.  The  origins  of  the  species,  which 
are like their ‘Adams’  or progenitors, each testify independently to created-
ness ( h u d û s ; Ar. ḥ u d ū t h  ). Similarly, the natural laws, which are imaginary 
and theoretical, and natural causes, which lack intelligence, lack the ability 
to create and fashion the innumerable astonishing chains of beings and the 
countless,  wondrous,  divine  machines  which  form  the  chains.  Therefore, 
every  single  being  and  all  the  species  proclaim  independently  and  make 
known that they proceed from the All-Wise Maker’s hand of power. Yes, 
the All-Glorious Maker put the stamp of contingency and createdness on the 
foreheads of all things.

Note

Note

When deeming possible such false questions as the pre-eternity of matter 
and the formation of the species from the motion of particles, the intention 
is  to  persuade  oneself  by  something  else,  so  the  error  arises  from  giving 
those  questions  secondary  importance  then  failing  to  perceive  their  falla-
cious principles. For if one addressed oneself to them in order to convince 
oneself, one would see that they are irrational and precluded. Supposing one 
did accept them, one could do so only out of the distress caused by forgetful-
ness of the Maker. 

Being noble and honourable, by virtue of the human essence man always 
wants to buy what is right and always seeks the truth and his perpetual goal 
is happiness. But unsuspectingly, while seeking the truth, he obtains what 
is false and wrong. While digging the mine of truth, the false falls on his 
head. Or else, if forced to ﬁnd the truth or he ﬁnds no part of it, his inborn 
nature, conscience, and mind are compelled to accept something he knows 
to  be  irrational  and  invalid,  because  he  considers  it  superﬁcially  and  in 
second place. 

Now, keep this fact in view. You will see that the inborn natures of those 
who have mistaken ideas about the pre-eternity of matter and motion due to 
their not heeding the order in the world, and imagine blind coincidence in 
the wondrous art and embroidery, which leaves all minds in astonishment, 

102

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

and who believe that lifeless causes have an actual effect despite the testi-
mony of all the purposes and instances of wisdom, and ﬁnd consolation by 
making imaginary, embodied nature the source due to misleading their souls 
and  the  seductions  of  unending  delusions  –  you  will  see  that  their  inborn 
natures surely reject all this. But those baseless delusions assault them with-
out warning from the sides of the road only because they are turned to the 
truth and their intention is to discover it. So for sure, the person who has 
ﬁxed his gaze on his goal, looks at those false conjectures superﬁcially and 
secondarily. He does not penetrate into the adorned lies. But if and when he 
considers them purposefully with the intention of buying them, he does not 
condescend to look at them even, let alone buy them.

Indeed, the conscience and reason see that such ugly things are impos-
sible.  The  heart  does  not  accept  them  either.  Unless  with  squabbling  and 
empty words they ascribe to every single particle the intellects of the phi-
losophers and the politicking of the rulers so that each might unite with his 
brothers, consult concerning the general order, and communicate with each 
other. An animal would not accept such a way, let alone a human being. But 
what can one do? A way necessitates whatever it necessitates. This way can-
not be depicted in any other manner. Yes, the mark of fallaciousness is that 
whenever a matter is not given primary importance and is seen as secondary, 
it may appear to be valid; but if it is given full attention, the possibility of its 
validity disappears.

Indication

What they call matter can never be abstracted from ever-changing forms 
and the evanescent motion of events. This means that createdness ( h u d û s ; 
Ar. ḥ u d ū t h  ) is certain. How astonishing it is! How is it that those who cannot 
ﬁt in their minds the pre-eternity of the necessarily existent Maker, which is 
a self-evident necessity, can ﬁt into them the pre-eternity of matter, which is 
in every way contrary to pre-eternity? It really is astonishing. The more one 
thinks of it, the more it makes one regret one’s humanity that they should 
consider anomalous and deny the Maker, Who possesses all the attributes 
of perfection, and ascribe these wondrous artefacts to blind chance and the 
motion of particles.

Allusion

In so far as they are accidents, the forces and forms which, it is claimed, 
are produced from the motion of particles cannot constitute the substan-
tial differences in the species of beings. Accidents cannot be substances. 
Hence, all the families of the species and the distinguishing characteristics 

THIRD ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF DOCTRINE

103

of substances are given existence ( lit. invented; T. m u h t e r a ’  A. m u k h t a r a ‘  ) 
out of nothing. Successive generation is one of the theoretical habitual con-
ditions  in  the  chains  of  beings.  That,  in  brief,  is  the  proof  that  things  are 
given existence out of nothing (   d e l i l - i   i h t i r a ’   ) . If you want a clear, detailed 
exposition,  enter  the  garden  of  the  Qur’an,  for  there  is  nothing  “   f r e s h   o r  
d r y   ”   ( 6:59 ) in that place of promenading that is not found as a ﬂower or a 
bud. If our allotted span permits, and divine will and assistance accompany 
us, the jewels which adorn this proof in the shells of the Qur’an’s words will 
be set out in the forthcoming books.

Misconception and Note

I f   y o u   a s k :  What is this nature that they’re always going on about? What 

are these laws and forces that they are always muttering about?

We   a n s w e r   a s   f o l l o w s :  There is the code of divine natural laws (   ş e r i a t - ı  
f ı t r i y e - i   i l â h i y e   ) , which holds in order the acts of the elements and members 
of the body of creation, called the Manifest World  (   â l e m - i   ş e h â d e t   ) . It is 
this code of natural laws which is called nature or the divine printing press. 
Yes, nature consists of the totality of the theoretical laws in force in the crea-
tion of the universe. Each of what they call forces is an article of the code of 
laws, and the things they call laws are each a matter of the code. But because 
of the continuance of the code’s articles, and, because the abilities of those 
who perceive the imaginary to be truth have prepared saline ground, delu-
sion and imagination have prevailed and this delusory nature has become 
established and embodied, and has assumed external existence and become 
a cliché rather than imaginary. Delusions and erroneous views play many 
tricks like this. 

Indication

Nature and the matters they call the general laws possess nothing at all 
to persuade the reason or make themselves agreeable to thought or appear 
familiar to the truth, and they lack the ability to be the source and original 
cause of the universe. Therefore, to consider the astounding works of divine 
power  to  proceed  from  the  artistry  of  nature,  which  resembles  a  printing 
press, and to imagine nature to be the source rather than a pattern is the result 
of an absurd analogy that attempts to extrapolate a particular necessary con-
sequence from the most general precedent, and is due solely to heedlessness 
of  the  Maker  and  the  distress  arising  from  the  constraints  of  the  cosmic 
order. This absurd analogy has opened up numerous paths to the valleys of 
misguidance and perplexity.

104

Elucidation

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

Despite suffering much opposition and violation, the Shari‘a and laws, 
which set voluntary actions in order, have been imagined by many ignora-
muses to be some sort of spiritual ruler; fancying the order to be a monarch, 
they suppose it possesses effectiveness. Yes, wouldn’t it be peculiar if a sav-
age observed the regular actions of a regiment of soldiers and their uniform 
movements,  and  supposed  those  numerous  individuals  to  be  tied  together 
with string? Or would one ever see a vagrant or rhymester attributing exter-
nal existence to the system which endowed a large number of people with a 
pleasing arrangement, seeing the code of laws as a sort of leader? In which 
case, why should the code of divine natural laws which is linked to events 
in the cosmos and is called nature and is violated only to afﬁrm the prophets 
and exalt the saints and is ceaseless, why should it be embodied due to delu-
sions? Why should it be considered strange? 

Misapprehension and Note

Just as man’s mind, tongue, and hearing are particular and follow each 
other in succession, so are his thought and endeavour minor and particular. 
His attention can be focused on only one thing after another and he is busy 
with things one at a time. Also, man’s worth and nature are proportionate 
to his aspirations. And the  degree of his aspirations are proportionate to his 
goals and what he is preoccupied with. Moreover, man becomes absorbed 
and lost in his aims and what he is turned to. It is because of this that lowly or 
minor matters are not ascribed to the great, for they would not condescend to 
them and their aspirations could not be contained in such petty matters. The 
balance  would  be  broken  because  such  aspiration  is  weighty,  while  petty 
matters are light. Also, whatever man beholds, he seeks its criteria and prin-
ciples in himself. If he cannot ﬁnd them there, he seeks them in his surround-
ings or in his fellow men. Even, if he ponders over the Necessary Existent, 
Who  in  no  way  resembles  contingent  beings,  his  surmising  faculty  wants 
to  make  its  false  conjectures  into  principles  and  telescopes.  Whereas  the 
All-Glorious Maker may not be beheld in this way. There is no limit to His 
power. His power, knowledge, and will are all-embracing and comprehen-
sive like the light of the sun, and may not be restricted or measured. As they 
connect with the greatest thing, so they connect with the tiniest and lowliest. 
The measure of the grandeur and balance of their perfection is the totality 
of His works. So to compare the Necessary Existent to contingent beings is 
absurd and a contrariety.

THIRD ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF DOCTRINE

105

To reason in accordance with the above-mentioned futile conjectures is 
pure error. It is due to the unfortunate results of this boorish error and delu-
sive surmise that the Naturalists believed that causes have an actual effect, 
the Mu‘tazilites believed they created their voluntary actions, the philoso-
phers denied that divine knowledge encompassed particulars, and the Zoro-
astrians ascribed the creation of evil to things other than Allah. As though 
according to them with His mighty grandeur the Maker would not conde-
scend  to  busy  Himself  with  lowly,  particular  matters.  Pooh  to  their  intel-
ligences for becoming captive to such futile delusions! Brother! Even if not 
by way of their beliefs, this delusory notion has assailed some believers due 
to the whisperings of Satan.

Indication

I f  y o u  s a y :  The proof that things are given existence out of nothing ( d e l i l -
i  i h t i r a ’ ; Ar. i k h t i r ā ‘  ) is the giving of existence. The giving of existence goes 
together with annihilation. But with our intelligences we cannot conceive of 
existence out of pure non-existence and absolute non-existence out of pure 
existence.

M y   r e p l y :  Your surprise and supposing this to be difﬁcult is the unfortu-
nate result of a misleading analogy. For you are comparing divine creation 
and giving of existence with the art and acts ( k i s b , lit. acquisition ) of His 
servants. Yet the servants’ power is insufﬁcient to give existence to an atom 
even or to annihilate it. They have only some proﬁciency and acquisition in 
theoretical matters and in manipulating existent ones. This analogy is decep-
tive; one cannot save oneself from it [ and make sense of it ]. 

I n   S h o r t :  Man has never seen in the contingent beings in the universe a 
power and strength that might bestow pure existence and annihilate it. But 
essentially he always judges with his reason from what he observes. That is 
to say, he looks at the divine works by way of contingent beings. Whereas 
he should behold them by way of the Maker’s power, which is proven by its 
wonder-provoking works. That is, he imagines the Maker within the imagi-
nary power of the powers and forces that have no effect, for they are merely 
theoretical matters pertaining to the cosmos and His servants, and he con-
siders this question from their point of view. He should, however, look at it 
from the side of the Necessary Existent and from the point of view of His 
absolute power.

If one reasons about the works of a person, one has to take his charac-
teristics into consideration. This has not been done in this question. For it 
has been looked at beneath the veil of parabolic analogies (   k ı y a s - ı   t e m s i l î   )  
behind the powerlessness of the servants and by way of the power of con-
tingent beings. Whereas, concerning the world’s being given existence, they 
have disregarded the fact that the perfection of divine power is demonstrated 
by some of the miracles of so many astonishing works being brought into 
existence without matter and others being compounded from matter. They 
have regarded the Necessary Existent in accordance with a limited rule, like 
making the false analogy of looking on the unseen as  present and judging 
it as they judge their fellow-men. Even, they imagine to be irrational many 
questions which sound minds consider reasonable.

Quite apart from existents from non-being, if one beholds from the point 
of view of perfect divine power the astonishing laws of the luminescence of 
the world’s eye, which they call light and is the most obvious and luminous 
of  works,  as  well  as  the  astonishing  laws  of  the  eye’s  light,  which  is  the 
former’s fruit and a miniature sample of it, and if one compares them with 
matters that are imagined to be irrational and distant, they will appear more 
than familiar between the eyelashes of the mind’s eye. 

Just as theoretical matters are deduced from necessary ones (   z a r û r i y a t   ) , 
so too, the necessary matters of the Maker’s works are proof of the hidden 
matters of His art. Both prove this question together.

Allusion

Can  the  mind  conceive  of  anything  ﬁner,  stranger,  or  more  wondrous 
than  the  art  in  the  world’s  order  and  anything  further  from  the  power  of 
contingent beings? It surely cannot. For the sciences necessarily testify to 
the Maker’s intention, art, and wisdom through the beneﬁts and instances of 
wisdom they show, thus compelling the reason to accept them. If it had been 
left to the human intellect alone, it would not have accepted even the most 
minor of these self-evident matters. 

Why  should  it  be  considered  strange  that  what  is  inﬁnitely  easier  and 
lighter be ascribed to the Most Pure and Holy One Who upholds the earth 
and  skies  and  employs  the  cosmic  bodies  within  the  universal  order  and

none of Whose commands are disobeyed? It is pure sophistry to doubt that 
one who lifts a mountain cannot lift an inkwell. 

I n   S h o r t :  Just as parts of the Qur’an expound other parts, so some of 
the lines of the book of the universe expound the art and wisdom that lie 
beyond them. 

Indication

I f   y o u   s a y :  Union, uniﬁcation, and metempsychosis are apparent in what 
some of the Suﬁs have said. One might surmise from this a connection with 
the unity of existence (   v a h d e t ü ’ l - v ü c û d   ) , which is the way of some of the 
materialists.

T h e   A n s w e r :   With  their  ecstatic,  symbolic  utterances,  the  Suﬁ  veriﬁ-
ers of reality became immersed in beholding the Most Holy Existent and, 
withdrawing  from  contingent  beings,  saw  the  result  in  the  evidence.  That 
is to say, on the way they followed in beholding the Maker from the world, 
they gazed on the ﬂowing manifestations in the streams of the world and 
the swirling effusions in the inner face of things and the manifestation of 
the divine names in the mirrors of beings, and used due the lack of words 
such terms as, ‘suffusing divinity’  (   u l û h i y e t - i   s â r i y e   )  and ‘suffusing life’ 
(   h a y a t - ı   s â r i y e   ) , but others did not understand the truths these expressed. 
Due to the misunderstanding, they applied the words and utterances of the 
Suﬁ mystics to the garbled nonsense that emerged from their own stunted 
abilities. Pooh to their intelligences! The abstract ideas of the Suﬁ veriﬁers 
of reality, at the heights of the Pleiades, are inﬁnitely distant from the lowly 
thoughts of the materialists’ imitators in the pits of the earth. Any attempt to 
correlate these two sets of ideas shows that the human mind has suffered an 
arrest at this time of progress and has fallen into the abyss of death! Observ-
ing this with regret, humankind is compelled to declare with the tongue of 
its investigative and progressive abilities:

the unity of existence. However, in reality, the unity of existence is the fal-
lacious way of some ancient philosophers.

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

The  leader  and  shaykh  of  the  Suﬁs  stated  that  those  who  made  claims 
about  union  or  uniﬁcation  or  metempsychosis  had  apprehended  nothing 
about  the  knowledge  of  Allah.  Is  union  or  uniﬁcation  with  the  Necessary 
Existent possible? Absolutely not! What value have contingent beings that 
the Necessary Existent should incarnate in them? Allah forbid! An emana-
tion from the superabundance of divine muniﬁcence may be manifested in 
contingent beings. Their way [ the way of the Suﬁs’ leader and shaykh ] has 
no relation or link with the other one. For since on their way the materialists 
concentrated solely on materiality and became immersed in it, their ideas 
grew distant from any idea of the divinity and were dissociated from it. They 
attached  such  importance  to  matter  that  the  regretable  way  they  adopted 
beheld matter alone and even combined divinity with it.

However, the Suﬁ veriﬁers of reality who were followers of the unity of 
witnessing restricted their view to the Necessary Existent to such an extent 
that contingent beings ceased to have any value at all. They said: “ All is 
one. ”  Be  reasonable!  The  Necessary  Being  and  contingent  beings  are  as 
far from each other as the ground is from the Pleiades! I swear by the All-
Glorious Creator Who creates matter with all its sorts and in all its forms, 
that there is no idea more ugly or base or ludicrous than this, which attempts 
to associate these two ways, thus proving that those who subscribe to it are 
utterly deranged.
Elucidation

If the globe of the earth is imagined to consist of multicoloured, multi-
farious fragments of glass, each fragment will receive an emanation (   f e y z   )  
from the sun relative to its colour, shape, and proportions. This imaginary 
emanation is neither the sun’s essence nor the essence of its light. Also, if the 
hues of these multicoloured blooms, which are the manifestation (   t e c e l l î   )  of 
the sun and the depiction of the seven colours in its light, were to speak, each 
would say: “ The sun’s like me ” or “ The sun’s mine.”

The way of the followers of the unity of witnessing, however, is the way 
of those who practise intoxication and self-annihilation. The purest and best 
way is that of sobriety and separation.

Note

The above are proofs of the Maker’s existence in brief; detailed exposi-
tion will be the three books. If you say that you want a clear exposition of the 
proofs of divine unity here, even if only in summary, I would say that they 
are so well-known and so many that there is no need to mention them in this 
book. The proof t a m ā n u ‘ , which is hidden in the shell of the verse,   ( 21:22 ) 
¶  μ    ´  ³       ²     ±  ° , is a beaming lighthouse for this way. Yes, 
independence is an essential quality of the Godhead, and necessary to Him.

Elucidation

The similarity between works in the universe, and the various sides of it 
embracing each other, and their co-operating to maintain the order, and their 
replying favourably to each other’s questions and cries for help, and their 
looking to one point, and their revolving around a single orbit all hint at the 
Maker’s unity, indeed they declare in all clarity the unity of the Pre-Eternal 
All-Wise One. For sure, a machine has only one maker and inventor.

Hoca Tahsin  2 uses “ limitless ” and “ numberless ” relatively here; he does 
not intend actually inﬁnite numbers.

Indication

However many the attributes of perfection, the All-Glorious Maker pos-
sesses them all. For it is established that the traces of perfection in creatures 
are  faint  shadows  derived  from  the  Maker’s  perfection.  Hence,  however 
much beauty, goodness, and perfection there are in the universe, the Maker 
possesses attributes of beauty and perfection at a level inﬁnitely higher than

all of them. Bounty is derived from and is evidence of riches, and the giv-
ing  of  existence  is  evidence  of  existence,  and  necessitating  of  necessity, 
and  beautifying  of  beauty.  Moreover,  the  All-Glorious  Maker  is  free  of 
every  sort  of  defect.  He  utterly  lacks  the  imperfections  arising  from  the 
essential incapacity of material beings. He is exalted above the attributes 
intrinsic to the contingent natures of all beings.

The Second Aim
Premise

I f   y o u   s a y :  You said in the preface that the second part of the profession 

of faith both testiﬁes to the ﬁrst and is testiﬁed to by it. 

T h e   A n s w e r :  Yes, indeed! The straightest and ﬁrmest of the ways lead-
ing to the k a ‘ b a   of perfections known as knowledge of Allah, is the lumi-
nous, felicitous way laid out by the Master of Medina the Illumined ( Upon 
whom  be  blessings  and  peace ).  For  the  veracious  tongue  of  Muhammad 
( Upon whom be peace ), who was the spirit of guidance, reﬂected and inter-
preted his heart, which was a light-scattering lamp encapsulating the Unseen 
Worlds, and was the truest living proof of the proofs of the Maker, and the 
most eloquent and articulate evidence. Yes, both his self and his tongue were 
illuminating proofs. The person of Muhammad ( UWBP ) was a clear proof 
from the side of creation; his tongue was a truthful witness from the side of 
reality. Yes, Muhammad ( Upon whom be peace ) was a decisive proof of 
both the Maker, and prophethood, and the resurrection of the dead, and truth, 
and reality. Detailed exposition is coming later. 

Note

Foreword

This does not necessitate a circular argument, for proof of truthfulness is 

not dependent on the Maker’s evidences. 

Our prophet was a proof of the Maker, in which case, the veracity of this 
proof has to be established, and its consequences, and its validity in form 
and content. As follows:

origin, nor seek the whole’s result from each of the parts. For to do so is 
weakness and causes inability and rejection of the result. 1

Also, cleanse the mirror of the heart of the childish or inimical propensity 
to offer pretexts and of such traits as seeing only faults like a customer, and 
polish it up. Respond to and balance up the truths. Deduce from the burn-
ing brand of the truth which appears from the combining of the allusions of 
the greater part, an illumined conjecture, so that the dark delusions of the 
lesser  may  be  lit  up  and  repulsed.  Listen  fairly  and  attentively,  and  don’t 
object  until  what  I  have  to  say  is  ﬁnished.  My  words  form  an  entirety,  a 
whole statement. If any delusive ideas remain in your mind when they are 
completed, state them!

Note

Indication

The  minor  premise  is  prophethood  generally,  the  major  premise  is  the 
prophethood  of  Muhammad  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace ).  We 
begin: 

The Maker’s wisdom and the absence of futility in His actions, and the 
observance of order in even the lowliest and least thing in the universe 
and its never being neglected, and the ineluctable need which is human-
kind’s teacher, most certainly necessitate the existence of prophethood 
in humankind.

I f   y o u   s a y :  I don’t understand so brief a statement. Explain it further.
I   s a y :  Listen! The proof of prophethood generally is humanity’s advanc-
ing  from  animality  in  respect  of  three  points.  For  prophethood  resembles 
the centre and mine of the material and spiritual order of humankind and of 
the order given to the disposition of the numerous species which have been 
placed under its disposal owing to the power of the human faculty of reason. 
THE FIRST POINT is the strange mystery inferred by the rule ‘To think 
ﬁrst is to act afterwards; to act ﬁrst, is to think afterwards.’ It is like this: 
humankind’s ability to develop sciences by discovering through the light of 
speculative thought the sequences and conﬁgurations of causes, and by ana-
lysing and reducing to elementary substances the compounds that are like 
the seeds of human attainments; and in respect of its ability to produce art, 
which it does through copying nature and employing the laws in force in the 
things they call compound wholes, the human being’s faulty view, thronging 

1.  This should be noted. ( Author )

THIRD ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF DOCTRINE

113

anxieties, and inability to arouse humanity, all show the need for a prophet-
guide, so that the balance of the perfect order in the world may be preserved.
THE SECOND are the human potentialities, which are inﬁnite; human 
beings’ hopes and desires, which are unrestricted; their thoughts and ideas, 
which are boundless; and their appetitive powers and power of anger, which 
are unlimited. 

Indication

Even  if  a  person  were  to  be  given  a  lifetime  of  millions  of  years  and 
complete enjoyment of all worldly pleasures in every respect, he would still 
sigh  “ if  only  ... ”  due  to  the  inﬁnity  within  his  innate  disposition.  It  is  as 
though  his  discontentment  suggests  and  hints  that  humankind  is  destined 
for eternity and is created for everlasting happiness so that the unrestricted 
innate human capabilities may emerge in fact in inﬁnite time in an unlim-
ited, expansive world. 

Note

The absence of futility and the realities of things intimate that the human 
perfections cannot be contained in this narrow, restricted, and lowly world, 
which is not free of the conﬂict and envy arising from the numerous factors 
hindering every single pleasure. There must be a wide world where there 
are no obstructions and disorder so that human beings may truly burgeon 
and blossom, and setting their own circumstances and attainments in order, 
conform to the order in the world. 

Note and Indication

The resurrection of the dead has been alluded to indirectly and will any-
way be proved conclusively below. The point I want to make here is that the 
innate human potentialities look to eternity. If you wish, study and ponder 
over  the  human  essence,  the  value  of  man’s  rationality,  and  the  require-
ments  of  his  innate  capabilities.  Then  take  a  look  at  his  imagination,  the 
least and lowliest servant of the human essence. Approach it and say: “ Hey, 
imagination! You’ll be given sovereignty over the world and all it holds and 
a lifetime of millions of years, but your end will be demise and extinction 
never to return. ” How would your imagination respond to you, I wonder? 
Would it reply joyfully and happily, or regretfully and sorrowfully? Surely, 
the human essence would cry out woefully from the depths of its conscience, 
“ Alas and alack at the loss of everlasting happiness! ” It would reproach the 
imagination  bitterly,  saying:  “ Don’t  be  content  with  this  ﬂeeting  world! ” 

114

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

My brother, if such transient sovereignty does not satisfy the lowliest servant 
of humanity’s sovereign – the human essence, or its poet, artist, or painter, 
how could it satisfy the sovereign itself, who has many servants such as the 
imagination? It could in no way do so! Only eternal happiness could satisfy 
it, concealed as it is in the shell of bodily resurrection.

THE THIRD are the moderateness and sensitivity of human nature and 
the wish for ﬁne things. It is humanity’s innate desire for a way of living 
appropriate to itself. Yes, human beings should not live like animals; they 
cannot. They have to live with a completeness that is congruous with human 
honour. In consequence, for their dress, food, and dwellings, they need to 
engage in numerous industries. But because singly, a person’s power is insuf-
ﬁcient for these industries, he has to mingle with his fellow-men, and this 
requires participating with them, and this, co-operating with them, and this, 
exchanging the fruits of their labours. Then due to the pertinaciousness and 
truculence of the human powers, they are in need of justice, and, because the 
human reason lacks the capacity for justice, of the laying down of universal 
laws to preserve it. Then in order to perpetuate the laws’ effectiveness, they 
need a lawgiver to enforce them. Also, the lawgiver has to be superior mate-
rially (   m a d d e t e n   )  and morally (   m â n e n   )  so that he may preserve his inward 
and outward domination. And since he has been assigned certain duties by 
the world’s Maker, worship is needed since it repeatedly recalls and instils 
in people’s minds the idea of the Maker’s grandeur, and ensures obedience 
to  the  lawgiver’s  position  and  relative  power,  and  to  his  commands.  And 
worship directs minds towards the Maker, and being directed in this way, 
induces submission, and such submission leads to the establishment of a per-
fect order. The perfect order is born of the mystery of wisdom, and the inner 
meaning of wisdom makes the absence of futility and the Maker’s wisdom 
and the skilful art in creatures testify to itself.

Thus,  if  you  have  been  able  to  understand  these  three  ways  in  which 
humankind is privileged over the animals, the necessary conclusion is that 
prophethood is the pole of humanity; indeed, is its centre and pivot, for all 
human affairs turn on it. It is like this: consider carefully the upper aspect, 
see how the management of humankind and the insufﬁciency of the human 
being’s  natural  inclinations  and  the  faultiness  of  his  views  and  mixing  of 
doubts in the progress of his reason all make humankind extremely needy 
for a guide and teacher. Such teachers are the prophets. Then study the sec-
ond aspect. It is as follows: man-made laws are in conformity neither with 
the stature of the human person’s innate potentialities which have the ability 

THIRD ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF DOCTRINE

115

to progress and are like the fruit of a branch of the world’s tendency towards 
perfection, nor with his desire for inﬁnity and the inclination towards aggres-
sion  in  his  nature  and  the  lack  of  restrictions  on  his  faculties  and  hopes; 
man-made laws are lifeless and temporary. They have come into existence 
gradually through the meeting of minds and their products and experiments. 
Due to the inadequate training of and assistance for the seeds of those fruits 
of the human potentialities, there is need for a divine code of laws that will 
ensure human happiness materially and spiritually in this world and the next, 
and being living and eternal, will expand together with the development of 
the stature of the human potentialities. It is the Prophet who brings that code 
of laws, the Shari ‘a.

I f  y o u  s a y :  We see that the affairs of the irreligious or of members of false 

religions are orderly and just.

T h e   A n s w e r :   Such  order,  justice,  and  virtues  are  obtained  through  the 
warnings  and  guidance  of  the  religious,  since  the  latter’s  principles  have 
been established by the prophets. That is to say, the prophets laid down the 
principles and matters; they practised the principles and virtues, and the rest 
followed  what  they  did.  Other  systems  and  attainments  are  temporary.  If 
they are upright and straight in one respect, in many respects they are mis-
shapen and crooked. That is, no matter how orderly they are superﬁcially, 
materially, and in regard to livelihood, they are corrupt and impaired mor-
ally, spiritually, and in meaning. 

Brother! It is the turn of the third aspect. Think about it! It is like this: 
both  extremes  in  morality,  that  is,  excess  and  negligence,  corrupt  man’s 
innate  capabilities,  and  such  corruption  results  in  futility.  Futility  is  con-
trary to the divine wisdom which governs in the world and is self-evident in 
the beneﬁts and purposes followed in even the smallest and least important 
things in the universe. 

Misapprehension and Note

The conceptions of the irreligious and their rejection of the divine Shari‘a 
concerning the matters they call “ knowledge of the law, ” which they instil 
by continually bruiting the harms of every sort of wrong, and “ conforming 
to the law, ” which is achieved by informing public opinion, are false delu-
sions. For the world has grown old. And the premises of such a thing are not 
clear. On the contrary, evils progress together with good things and assume 
a  more  fearsome  and  deceptive  form.  Indeed,  just  as  the  laws  of  wisdom 
are not unrelated to the principles of government, so too they have intense 

116

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

need for the laws of the Shari‘a and virtue. The above-mentioned mistaken 
moral  training  is  insufﬁcient  to  preserve  the  mean  of  the  three  powers  – 
wisdom, chastity, and courage. In consequence, of necessity man is in need 
of a prophet who will uphold the balance of divine justice, that it might be 
thoroughly effective on his conscience and disposition. 

Thousands  of  prophets  have  claimed  prophethood  and  supported  their 
claims  with  thousands  of  miracles.  All  their  miracles  proclaim  in  unison 
prophethood generally. This is a decisive proof of our minor premise too. 
You can call this t e v â t ü r  ( Ar. t a w ā t u r  )1 in meaning or anything you like, it 
is ﬁrm evidence. 

Indication

Note

The points of similarity in these reasoned arguments (   m u h â k e m a t   )  are 
these: if one considers all the sciences, and if one observes the good order 
and  harmony  the  sciences  have  disclosed  by  reason  of  the  universality  of 
their laws; and if one studies from the point of view of divine providence 
how such disorderly matters and acts as eating and marriage become con-
nected  and  linked  by  adding  a  pleasure  or  affection  or  some  other  thing, 
which are the vitalising leaven of various useful things; and if one dwells 
upon the absence of futility and of neglect in things, which is testiﬁed to by 
the wisdom and purpose they display; one will conclude through induction 
that as the pole and pivot of universal uses and beneﬁts and the source of 
their life, prophethood is necessary for humankind. If it were not so and one 
believes  that  wretched  humanity  fell  into  this  well-ordered  world  from  a 
chaotic world, so spoiling the balance and harmony of the general course of 
things, how could we human beings face the other beings in the universe? 

Note

Brother! If the minor premise of the proof of the Maker has been engraved 
on the page of your mind, prepare yourself, for we are moving on to discus-
sion of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) prophethood, the major premise.

Indication and Guidance

The  major  premise  is  true,  for  if  you  study  the  works  of  the  prophets 
which are inscribed on the instructive page of the world, and if you listen to 
their exploits recounted by the tongue of history, and if you are able to divest

the truth of the various forms it has assumed due to the effects of time and 
place, you will see that the prophets acted in accordance with the principles 
of  public  law  (   h u k û k u l l a h   )   and  private  law  (   h u k û k - u   i b a d   ) ,  which  are  a 
ﬂame of sheer virtue and a light of divine providence, and they taught how 
people should be regarded by humanity and how they should act towards 
other peoples and renounce personal interests, and other matters. The princi-
ples that were the pivot of prophethood were found in Muhammad ( UWBP ) 
in clearer and more perfect form, since he is the master of the sons of man at 
the age of their maturity and elderliness, and the source of the high sciences 
in the medrese of the Arabian Peninsula and their teacher. That is, in addi-
tion to pointing to the conclusion of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) prophethood 
through induction, particularly with the assistance of the hidden syllogism 
in one type based on the regular order [ in the universe ] and corroborated 
by the analogy known as evlevi, through the tongue of their miracles and in 
respect of the procedure of discarding extraneous matters called  t e n k i h - ü l  
m e n â t , 1 the prophets testiﬁed to the veracity of Muhammad ( UWBP ), who 
was a clear proof of the Maker’s existence.

Apology

I can’t express this in short sentences and it becomes unclear. For these 
truths  have  sent  out  deep  roots  in  every  direction  and  the  discussion  has 
become protracted. I don’t want to spoil the form of the question, or to break 
it up and injure the truth. I want also to draw a circle around the truth so that 
it is hemmed in and can’t escape. If I can’t capture it, others should do so. If 
you excuse me, so be it. Anyway, there is liberty and no oppression, so it’s 
up to you! 

Premise

Premise

The evidence (   d e l î l   )  of the Prophet’s veracity is all his actions and all 
his  conduct.  Yes,  the  absence  of  hesitation  in  everything  he  did,  and  his 
disregard for his objectors, and unconcern in the face of his opponents, and 
lack of fear of his enemies all show his veracity and seriousness. Also, the 
fact that the truth of his commands struck his very spirit shows his rightness. 

1.  The hidden syllogism ( k ı y a s - ı   h a f î ; Ar. q i y ā s   k h a f ī  ) is an enthymeme: an argument 
in which one premise is not explicitly stated. The analogy called e v l e v î   (   k ı y a s - ı   e v l e v î   )  is 
an analogy in which the reason or purpose for it is more compelling in the subject (   f e r ‘   )  
than  in  the  analogue  or  thing  from  which  the  analogy  is  drawn.  Te n k i h - ü l   m e n â t   ( Ar. 
t a n q ī ḥ   a l - m a n ā ṭ  ) is the procedure of removing irrelevant details from the reason for or 
cause of a legal judgement reached by analogical reasoning.

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

I n   S h o r t :  While being free of things like fear, hesitation, alarm, and dis-
quiet which infer trickery and a lack of conﬁdence and assurance, he estab-
lished  fearlessly  and  with  complete  conﬁdence  and  completely  appositely 
in the most perilous situations, living rules that would produce fruits in this 
world and the next. This being the case, from beginning to end his actions 
and  attitudes  show  plainly  to  the  attentive  his  seriousness  and  veracity. 
Indeed, like a corruscating light his seriousness and rightness appear from 
the  blending  of  the  totality  of  his  actions,  and  like  ﬂashing  lightning,  his 
veracity and percipience are manifested from their reﬂections and balance. 

Indication

The past and the present, that is, the Era of Bliss and the future, dem-
onstrate to anyone not blind that together and in unison they proclaim the 
proofs of prophethood in the person of Muhammad ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ), who was a mine of high morals, also in reply to the cry of 
the proof supplied by his person, as the summoner to truthfulness and herald 
of prophethood. In which case, we shall study the three pages from the chap-
ter of time from the book of the world. And we shall visit and behold the 
person of Muhammad ( UWBP ), the supreme, illumined matter of that book. 
With him we shall submit our main proof and assertion.

In consequence of this point, the ways of prophethood are fourfold. The 

ﬁfth is both famous and concealed. 

The First Way

The First Way 
Four points should be known in beholding the elevated question of his 

person.

T h e   F i r s t :  In accordance with the rule  ِلُ

ّ(cid:99)(cid:170)اَ(cid:166)  ُلَ(cid:111)ﯬﯧْ(cid:170)ا  َسْ(cid:193)َ(cid:170) no mat-
ter how perfect, the artiﬁcial and fake can never take the place of the genu-
ine, for it gives an impression of showy pretence. 

ّ(cid:111)ﯬﯧَ

T h e   S e c o n d :  What ﬁxes elevated morals in the ground of truth is seri-
ousness. And what perpetuates their life like the circulation of blood, and 
strengthens the self-respect born of their blending, and sets those moral vir-
tues in order is truthfulness. Yes, the moment the bonds of truthfulness and 
seriousness are severed, elevated morals dry up and wither. 

T h e   T h i r d :  The famous rule that attraction is felt between mutually cor-
responding things and repulsion is experienced between mutually contra-
dictory things is valid in spiritual and moral matters just as it is in material 
ones. 

THIRD ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF DOCTRINE

ّلﯭﯧِ(cid:170)  َسْ(cid:193)َ(cid:170) ٌمﯰﯧُ(cid:110)  ّ

ِلﯭﯧْ(cid:171)ِ(cid:170)  Let us come now to the main 
aim.  According  to  the  testimony  of  the  books  of  the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP ) 
biography, the self-respect and dignity arising from the multiplicity of ele-
vated morals which he most certainly possessed, and from their being com-
prehensive and blending together, indicated that – by reason of the honour 
and  integrity  which  proceeded  from  that  self-respect  and  dignity  and  due 
to the mystery of opposites, like the angels are exempted from mixing with 
devils – those high morals were exalted above and exempt from lying and 
trickery. And also, since they comprised truthfulness and rightness, which 
are their very life and leaven, they proclaim prophethood as brilliantly as a 
blaze of light. 

Note

Brother! You see that a man who is famous for bravery alone does not 
stoop easily to lying, lest he wounds the honour his fame accords him. So 
how could a person who possessed all the moral qualities at once descend 
to deceit? Yes, there is found in the whole what is not present in the parts. 

Indication and Note

We see that at the present time there is only the space of a ﬁnger between 
truthfulness and lying. Both are sold in the same market. Each age has its 
ruling ethos. At no time has the distance between truthfulness and lying been 
so great as it was in the Era of Bliss. Since truthfulness displayed its true 
beauty in all its glory, it raised Muhammad ( UWBP ), who adhered to it, to 
the highest of the high and was the cause of a mighty revolution in the world. 
It raised its market value by showing that it was as distant from lying as the 
East is from the West and it made itself highly sought after and in demand. 
1 As for lying, since it drained its great undertakings of life, like carrion or 
corpses, it displayed its despicable ugliness, and casting down Musaylima 
and his likes to the lowest of the low since they became addicted to it, ren-
dered inactive the market for its poisonous wares and made it stagnant. 2

True to their character, with their powerful self-esteem and penchant for 
boasting,  the  Arab  people  competed  with  each  other  to  increase  demand, 
and abandoned that stagnant lying. Acquiring beauty through practising that 
sought-after truthfulness, they caused the world to accept their justice. The 
Companions’ reasoned justice arose from this point.

Guidance and Indication

Considered from the point of view of history and the books of biogra-
phy, the facts that from the age of four until forty when the natural pas-
sions are vigorous and intense and any character traits become evident, the 
Prophet ( UWBP ) lived with complete rectitude and perfect steadfastness 
and  regularity,  and  total  balance  and  perfect  chastity,  with  none  of  his 
actions remaining secret and displaying not the slightest hint of trickery in 
the face of his most obdurate enemies. Then consider the supreme revo-
lution he brought about after the age of forty when habitual conduct and 
morals have become ingrained and permanent, if one doesn’t afﬁrm that 
that  revolution proceeded from the truth and was truth, he has only him-
self to blame, for there must be a Sophist hidden in his head. Then again, 
the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) conduct, stance, and state in the most perilous of 
situations,  like  in  the  cave,  when  there  was  no  escape  and  all  hope  was 
lost: his unwavering staunchness and perfect assurance and conﬁdence are 
sufﬁcient testimony to his prophethood and seriousness and are evidence 
that he adhered to the truth.

The Second Way

The Second Way 
The ﬁrst page, that is, the past. Attention needs to be drawn to four points 

on this page:

T h e   F i r s t :  If a person acquires the principles, spirit, and bases of a sci-
ence or a tale and constructs his assertions on them, he will display his skill 
and proﬁciency in that science.

T h e   S e c o n d :  Brother! If you know human nature, you will be aware that 
no matter how inconsequential, opposing views cannot be voiced concern-
ing some minor case among few people or a small tribe. So if a cause of the 
very greatest importance which comprises matters exceeding human reason, 
is advanced boldly and fearlessly and with the utmost assurance among very 
numerous predominantly illiterate peoples who display extremes of obdu-
racy,  you  will  see  that  truthfulness  will  rise  like  the  sun  over  everyone’s 
heads out of what is written and what is said.

T h e   T h i r d :  There are many theoretical sciences which, while remaining 
unknown to nomadic peoples, for the civilised have become axiomatic due 
to  the  inculcation  of  customs  and  practices.  In  consequence,  if  one  is  to 
judge the nomads’ circumstances, one has to imagine oneself as present in 
their desert habitations. If you wish, you may refer to the Second Premise 
above, for it sets out this point clearly.

THIRD ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF DOCTRINE

121

T h e   F o u r t h :  If an illiterate person propounds his ideas before the ulema 
concerning some current science, and agrees with the points on which they 
are agreed and disagrees with the points of dispute and corrects any errors, it 
establishes his superiority and that his knowledge is not acquired. In accord-
ance with these points we say this: notwithstanding his well-known illiteracy, 
the Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) traversed 
time with his ﬂeet, untrammelled spirit and entered the hidden depths of the 
past then described the circumstances and secrets of the previous prophets as 
though he had been present and witnessed them. He attracted the gaze of all 
the intelligent and proclaimed his mighty cause before the whole world. In 
preparation he fearlessly and with utter conﬁdence announced the principles 
of his cause, which in essence were similar to the endeavours of the previ-
ous prophets’ missions and their mysteries. The facts that he related to us the 
stories of the prophets and afﬁrmed the points of agreement of the previous 
scriptures and corrected points of difference, furnish necessary proof of his 
veracity and prophethood.

A d d e n d u m :  The proofs of the prophethood of all the previous prophets 
are evidence of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) veracity, and all their miracles are 
in  effect  a  miracle  of  his.  You  will  understand  this  if  you  ponder  over  it 
carefully.

gaze; his true way disdained deception.

The Third Way

The Third Way 
Four points from the page of the present, that is, the Era of Bliss. Atten-

tion will be drawn to one point in particular.

T h e   F i r s t :   Consider  the  following:  even  with  considerable  effort  a 
mighty ruler cannot easily eradicate an unimportant custom from an incon-
siderable people or an insigniﬁcant trait from a small tribe,  yet someone 

َ
122

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

lacking power extirpates from the depths of an extremely numerous, big-
oted,  and  perverse  people’s  spirits  their  very  various,  long-held,  deep-
seated, and completely ingrained customs and practices with little effort 
and in a short time. If you don’t agree that this is quite wondrous, I shall 
inscribe your name in the book of Sophists.

T h e   S e c o n d :  The formation, or natural growth, of a state – which resem-
bles a collective personality – is slow. And only gradually can a state gain 
mastery over a former state since submission to the latter has become like 
second nature to it. In which case, the formation in a short time of a vast, 
and materially and morally powerful state, and its almost instantly gaining 
ascendancy over other, ﬁrmly established states shows that its customs and 
practices in both moral and material matters are necessarily extraordinary. 
If you can’t see this, your name will be written in the register of the blind. 
T h e  T h i r d :  It is possible to dominate outwardly through force and oppres-
sion, but to conquer minds, and be loved by spirits, and command human 
nature, and permanently preserve one’s rule over consciences is the distin-
guishing mark of the truth. If you are unaware of this quality, you are unac-
quainted with the truth. 

T h e   F o u r t h :  Employing false or deceptive incentives or threats will have 
only a superﬁcial effect and will block up paths to the intellect. In which 
case, to penetrate to the depths of the heart, excite the ﬁnest emotions, dis-
close the bud-like human potentialities, arouse latent, dormant abilities, ﬁre 
the passion of the human essence, and reveal the value of human reason must 
be the mark of the rays of the truth. Yes, Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) cleans-
ing their hearts of such things as the live burial of girl-children, a concrete 
embodiment of hardness of heart, and his adorning them with such things as 
kindness to animals, to ants even, which is a ﬂash of tender-heartedness, was 
such a mighty revolution – especially among those primitive peoples – that 
it has been endorsed as extraordinary by the perspicacious since it was not 
conformable with any natural laws. You too will afﬁrm it if you have any 
understanding. 

N o w   l i s t e n   t o   t h e   P o i n t :  History testiﬁes that only the greatest geniuses 
can arouse a few emotions in people and develop one or two of their abilities 
and ﬁre their passions, for if their dormant emotions are not awakened, the 
effects of their efforts will be temporary and go for nothing. Even the great-
est geniuses have succeeded in arousing only one or two of the emotions.

Arabian  Peninsula  thousands,  even,  of  elevated  dormant,  latent,  hidden 
emotions,  and  to  cause  them  to  burst  into  ﬂower  instantaneously  was  the 
mark  of  the  light-scattering  sun  of  truth.  For  anyone  whose  mind  cannot 
comprehend this Point, we shall lay out before his eyes the Arabian Penin-
sula. Take Arabia: if a hundred of the most eminent philosophers were to 
be  sent  there  after  thirteen  centuries  of  human  progress  and  they  were  to 
labour there for a hundred years, could they achieve at the present time one 
hundredth of what he achieved there at that time?

Indication

Whoever seeks success has to be acquainted with and comply with divine 
practice ( â d e t u l l a h  – the natural laws ), creation, and the nature of things. 
The innate disposition of things will otherwise confound his efforts and he 
will  be  unsuccessful;  the  general  current  of  things  casts  into  nothingness 
those who oppose it. In consequence, consider the following. You will see 
the degree to which the truths of the Shari‘a are in conformity with the pro-
found, precise laws in force in creation, which are invisible to the micro-
scope of the mind. Those truths are cognisant of them and in harmony with 
them. For they have preserved the balance of those laws. Yes, the fact that 
the Shari‘a has preserved its truths throughout the mighty unheavals of the 
long ages, indeed, has caused them to unfold, shows that the way of the Most 
Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  is  founded  upon 
the truth, which can never perish. Having grasped these points, listen with a 
broad, reasoning, and attentive mind to the following:

Despite being unlettered and lacking any outward power or rule  or wish 
for sovereignty, Muhammad Hashimi ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 
set  out  with  perfect  assurance  in  a  most  perilous  situation,  and  conquer-
ing minds, becoming loved by spirits, and commanding natures, demolished 
numerous, deep-seated, ingrained, habitual, and savage customs and mores. 
Together with instilling elevated morals in their place, so ﬁrmly as to mix 
with  the  people’s  very  ﬂesh  and  blood,  he  stiﬂed  the  savage  cruelty  of  a 
people moribund in the far-ﬂung corners of barbarism, and excited the ﬁn-
est of feelings. Yes, arousing lofty emotions and disclosing the essence of 
their humanity, he raised them in a short time to the peak of civilisation. He 
founded in a brief time a vast empire that spread from East to West, swal-
lowed up other empires like a swirling ﬁre or blinding light or Moses’ staff 
and brought those empires to the point of extinction. He thus demonstrated 
to anyone whose vision and insight are not impaired his veracity, prophet-
hood, and that he adhered to the truth. If you cannot see this, it will erase you 
from the book of humanity.

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

The Fourth Way

future. 

The Fourth Way 
This  is  the  question  of  the  Shari‘a  in  particular,  from  the  page  of  the 

You must not hold back from considering four points carefully. 
T h e   F i r s t :  One person cannot be an expert and proﬁcient in four or ﬁve 

sciences, unless he is a marvel. 

T h e   S e c o n d :  Two people speak of a single matter. One of them expresses 
it suitably to the context and what precedes and succeeds it and its relation-
ship with them and situates it suitably; that is, he sets it in fertile ground, 
thus indicating his skill and proﬁciency in the science and his knowledge 
of it. The other one, however, because he neglects these points, displays his 
superﬁcial and plagiaristic knowledge. Whereas what they speak of is the 
same. If you cannot not discern this with your mind, your spirit discerns it. 
T h e   T h i r d :  As described in the Second Premise, if a discovery which 
two centuries ago was considered wondrous had remained undiscovered 
until the present, even a child could discover it now  due to the progress of 
science. Keep this in mind and go back thirteen centuries. Divest yourself 
of the developments of the intervening time and seat yourself in the wild 
Arabian  Peninsula.  Observe  it  carefully  and  you  will  see  an  unlettered, 
inexperienced man, unassisted by time and place. He is alone, yet he has 
established in accordance with the laws of science – which have been dis-
covered not only through human intelligence but also through very many 
experiments – such a system and such justice that if the human stature and 
potentialities  were  to  increase  through  absorbing  the  products  of  man’s 
thought,  that  system  and  Shari‘a  also  would  expand  and  head  for  eter-
nity. It thus proclaims that it proceeds from Allah’s pre-eternal speech and 
ensures the happiness of this world and the next. If you are fair, you will 
see that this is beyond the power of the people of that time, and even of all 
humankind, unless evil doubts have rotted your inborn nature’s eye  1 so 
that it looks only to the here and now.

T h e   F o u r t h :  As is described in the Tenth Premise and will be mentioned 
in the answer to the second objection, the Shari‘a offers guidance in accord-
ance with the mental capacity of the mass of the people. Since people gen-
erally have little education and cannot comprehend abstract truths without 
their being presented in familiar form, the Shari‘a depicts them with ﬁgures 
of  speech  and  allegories  and  metaphors.  Also,  since  the  people  perceive

things through their external senses, and consider necessary what is contrary 
to reality and in the physical sciences have not the followed the necessary 
steps in their development, the Shari‘a is vague and unspeciﬁc in such mat-
ters lest the people fall into the abyss of error. But it is still not devoid of 
hints to the truth.

Misapprehension and Note

Truthfulness shines forth in all the conduct and actions of the Most Noble 
Messenger  ( UWBP ),  but  all  his  acts  and  all  his  conduct  did  not  have  to 
be wondrous. For the purpose of his displaying marvels was to afﬁrm his 
claim to prophethood. When there was no need or it was inappropriate, he 
complied with the laws of divine practice and followed the general course of 
things. And it was requisite that he did so.

Brother! This note is of the same type as the premise (   m u k a d d e m e   )  of 
the First Way. It lost its way and place due to forgetfulness and ended up 
here. Keep these points ﬁrmly in mind, for now we are embarking on the 
conclusion.

Consider this, my brother! The Islamic Shari‘a and religion, which are 
founded on rational proofs, comprise the sum and substance of the sciences 
and branches of knowledge. These include the science of reﬁning the spirit, 
and of training the heart, and of educating the conscience, and the science 
of physical training, and domestic science, and the science of local govern-
ment, and that of international relations, and the legal sciences, and so on. 
The Shari‘a explains and elucidates where necessary or needed, and is con-
cise where it is not necessary or people’s minds are not ready or the times 
do not allow, and it lays down principles that can be elaborated, deduced, 
and expanded through consultation and the exercise of reason. At the present 
time, all these sciences or even a third of them after thousand three hundred 
years – having grown through the meeting of minds and expansion of their 
results – could not be found in a single person even in a civilised place and 
among clever people. In all fairness, your conscience could not prevent your 
afﬁrming this.

Virtue is such that enemies even cannot deny it. The New World’s most 
famous  philosopher,  Carlyle,  1  quoted  a  German  thinker  and  politician, 
who after conducting some close studies, asked himself: “ If Islam is thus,

wouldn’t present-day civilisation ﬂourish within the bounds of its truths? ” 
He  replied  to  himself  in  the  afﬁrmative.  The  punctilious  scholars  of  the 
present are living  within its sphere. The above-mentioned philosopher said 
that when the truths of Islam burst forth, they swallowed up like ﬂames the 
religions and ideas of that time as though they were dead wood. And it was 
right  they  they  did,  for  nothing  but  falsehood  proceeded  from  those  reli-
gions. And so so.

Yes, Islam has preserved its truths for thirteen centuries despite all the 
clashes and confrontations. Indeed, the clashes have lessened and lightened 
the dust of concealment settled on the shoulders of the truths of Islam. Yes, 
existence and the state of the world testify to this. One needs to ponder over 
the Premises in the First Article above.

I f   y o u   s a y :  It’s possible for one person to know all the sciences in sum-

T h e   A n s w e r :  Yes and no, because the summaries are such that as with 
the points mentioned above, being employed appositely in suitable posi-
tions and fertile ground, they show like glass full knowledge of and pro-
ﬁciency in [ the sciences ] beyond them. Yes, if two people speak of the 
same matter, what they say will hint at the ignorance of one and the knowl-
edge of the other.

Indication and Guidance and Note

Brother  of  conscience  who  has  travelled  with  me  in  the  imagination 
through the previous stopping places of this book! Take a broad look and 
weigh them up. Convene a high council in your imagination to judge them. 
Then summon your choice from the Twelve Premises to secure their pres-
ence. Then consult with the following rules.

One  person  cannot  be  an  expert  and  proﬁcient  in  numerous  sciences. 
Also,  when  two  people  speak  of  the  same  matter,  what  they  say  differs. 
Also, the sciences are the product of the meeting of minds in the course of 
time. Also, something that is self-evident in the future, may have been hypo-
thetical in the past. Also, what is known by the civilised may be unknown to 
the uncivilised. Also, it is a false analogy and misleading to compare the past 
to the future.  Also, the simplicity of hunters and desert dwellers is quite dis-
similar to the trickery and cunning of peasants and the civilised; trickery is 
disguised behind the veil of civilisation. Also, many sciences may be given 
rise to and provoked by customs, circumstances, and events. Also, the light

of human vision cannot penetrate the future and cannot see what is particular 
to it. Also, human laws have a natural lifespan; at some point they cease like 
human respiration. Also, time and place have a powerful effect on the affairs 
of people. Also, things that formerly were considered marvels, may now be 
looked on as commonplace, for ways and means have been perfected. Also, 
no matter how wondrous human intelligence may be, it is inadequate to per-
fect a science all at once, so how could it perfect numerous sciences?

Brother! Consult with these matters, then withdraw and assume the posi-
tion of inspector. Divest yourself completely of the imaginings and assump-
tions of time and place; then from the shore of this age enter the boundless 
ocean of time and emerge on the island of the Era of Bliss. What will strike 
your eye before all else is a single person who bereft of helper and power is 
challenging the whole world. He has taken on his shoulders a truth greater 
than the globe – a Shari‘a and code of laws which guarentees the happiness 
of all humankind; which as the sum and substance of all the divine sciences 
and branches of true knowledge, expands in conjunction with the unfolding 
of  the  human  potentialities,  and  establishes  such  justice  that  it  organises 
humankind’s circumstances – yielding fruits in this world and the next – as 
though men were members of a single council and the people of the same 
era. If you were to ask the Shari‘a’s laws whence they had come and where 
they were going, they would tell you that they had come from pre-eternity, 
and that, accompanying humankind for its well-being on the road to eternity, 
they were headed for post-eternity. Even if their outward links with us are 
severed after departure from this transient world, in spirit they will always 
be the guide and spiritual sustenance of human kind. 
Conclusion

Conclusion

There are three sources of doubts. It is like this: you feign ignorance of 
what the Lawgiver intends and the guidance that is commensurate with the 
capacity of people’s minds, and you object, uttering the following errone-
ous  statement,  which  is  the  breeding  ground  of  all  evil  suspicions:  “ The 
Qur’an, which is the chief component of the Shari‘a, comprises three doubt-
ful points. ” 

T h e   F i r s t :  The Qur’an contains allegorical verses and obscurities, which 
are opposed to eloquence, and eloquence is the cause of its distinction and is 
based on clarity of expression. 

T h e   S e c o n d :  The Qur’an is vague and general concerning the physical 
sciences and this is contrary to guidance and instruction, the true purposes 
of the Shari‘a. 

128

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

T h e   T h i r d :  Some of the Qur’an’s literal meanings tend to be contrary to 
rational  proof  and  so  may  be  opposed  to  reality,  and  this  is  incompatible 
with veriﬁcation and guidance, which constitute its method and way. 

Brother! Success is from Allah. I say that these three points which you 
claim are defects, are not as you imagine. The three of them are rather vera-
cious witnesses to the Qur’an’s miraculous inimitability. 

A n s w e r   t o   t h e   F i r s t   P o i n t :  You have anyway twice received the implicit 
answer to this. It is as follows: ordinary people form the majority, and in 
the Lawgiver’s view, the minority follows the majority. For the elite under-
stand and proﬁt from a discourse addressed to the common people, while the 
opposite is not true. The common people cannot free themselves from what 
they are familiar with and how they imagine them, and they can comprehend 
abstract ideas and sheer truths only through the telescope of the imagination. 
But to see the depictions ( lit. forms–s u v e r ; sing. s u r e t  ) of imaginary things 
and restrict attention to them necessarily gives rise to such impossibilities as 
their embodiment and having physical dimensions. And then they are seen 
as actual things rather than mere depictions. For instance, the mass of people 
can  see  divine  rule  over  the  beings  in  the  cosmos  in  the  form  of  the  sul-
ّ(cid:195)ا َ
ّنِا 
tan’s rule on the throne of his dominion, as in ( 20:5 ) ىَوَ(cid:99) ْ(cid:126)ا 
.  Since  they  perceive  things  in  this  way,  guidance  and  eloquence  require 
that their feelings are taken into account and respected and that allowance is 
made for their understanding. Such respect and allowance for human under-
standing is called ‘divine condescension.’ The purpose of this condescen-
sion is to familiarise and get the people to understand. You may refer to the 
Tenth Premise.

ِشْرَ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)ا ىَ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) َ

By reason of the above, the depictions in the allegorical verses have been 
put as telescopes to ﬂatter the feelings of the mass of people with their fanci-
ful views so that they may look on the abstract truths. This answer is corrob-
orated by the fact that numerous metaphors are utilised in speech generally 
in order to conceptualise or depict profound or various meanings in a simple 
and straightforward way. That is to say, the allegorical verses are the most 
abstruse  of  metaphors.  For  they  are  the  parabolic  forms  of  hidden  truths. 
This means that the abstruseness is due not to the incomprehensibility of the 
words, but to the subtlety of the meanings. 

You  who  objects!  Consider  this  fairly:  is  it  not  in  conformity  with 
eloquence, which is to speak suitably to any situation and clearly in any 
context,  to  bring  close  to  the  people’s  understanding  in  this  way  those 

ٰ
THIRD ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF DOCTRINE

129

truths which are furthest from them, or is it as you imagine it to be? You 
judge for yourself!

A n s w e r   t o   t h e   S e c o n d   P o i n t :  This was discussed in detail in the Second 
Premise. The sciences are successive and sequential, for they are the fruits 
of man’s inclination to progress – a branch of the desire in the world to be 
perfected – and are like the steps of the ladder of progress formed through 
numerous experiments and the products of the meeting of minds. The forma-
tion of the succeeding one is dependent on the forming of the previous one. 
That  is,  the  science  which  is  previous  becomes  established  as  axiomatic, 
then it may be preliminary to one that succeeds it. It is because of this that 
supposing a man had tried ten centuries ago to teach a science which had 
come into being through the reﬁnement of experiments, he would have done 
nothing but cause confusion and error. For instance, if he had said: “ Behold 
the  stationary  sun  and  rotating  earth  and  the  swarming  millions  of  living 
organisms in a droplet of water, then conceive of the Maker’s grandeur! ”, 
the mass of people would have either denied it due to their superﬁcial view 
and their supposing it to be contrary to what their external senses perceived, 
or they would have deceived themselves, or competed with it. But to con-
fuse people, especially over a period of a thousand years, is a grievous error 
when offering guidance. In short, the earth being ﬂat and the rotation of the 
sun were considered by them to be self-evident truths since that is how they 
saw them.

Note

Matters like this cannot be compared with future theoretical matters. For 
matters that belong to the future are possible in two respects since they are 
not connected with the external senses. They may be believed in, for they 
are possible. One may feel conﬁdent about them. Clearly their right is to be 
clariﬁed. But errors arising from the senses raised this matter of ours [ that 
is, matters dealt with by the physical sciences ] from the level of possibil-
ity to that of plain self-evidence, that is, to that of compounded ignorance. 
Whereas their undeniable right in the view of eloquence is to be vague and 
indeﬁnite lest the people’s minds become confused. Nevertheless, allusions, 
hints, and indications should be made to the truth. Doors should be opened 
to minds and they should be invited to enter. That is anyway what the Illus-
trious Shari‘a has done. 

Brother! Is it fair, is it investigating the truth, to imagine to be contrary to 
guidance the thing that is the very essence of guidance and pure eloquence? 
And to suppose to be defective something which according to eloquence is 

130

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

perfection itself? Is it eloquence according to your defective understanding 
to cast the people’s minds into error and confusion and to propose things 
reason cannot support because time and place have not adequately equipped 
their understanding? Allah forbid! The rule ْمـِ(cid:183)ِ(cid:170)وُ(cid:163)ُ(cid:150) ِرَدَ(cid:162) ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150)  َساَ

wise and meaningful. Refer to the Premises if you wish, especially the First 
Premise; ponder over it.

ّ(cid:179)(cid:170)ا ِمـّ

N o w  t h e  A n s w e r  t o  t h e  T h i r d  P o i n t , which is that some of the literal mean-
ings  of  verses  are  contrary  to  rational  evidences.  Study  the  First  Premise 
then listen to this: the Lawgiver’s main aims in guiding the mass of people 
are proof of the Single Maker, prophethood, the resurrection of the dead, and 
justice. In which case, mention of the universe is secondary and digressive; 
it is in order to deduce from the wondrous order in the art which is clearly 
apparent to people [ the existence ] of the All-Glorious Maker, Who is the 
True Orderer. The works of art and their order are apparent in everything; 
the manner of their formation is unrelated to their main purpose.

Note

It is an established fact that the evidence has to be known before what 
is  being  asserted.  Therefore,  the  literal  meanings  of  some  verses  incline 
towards  the  people’s  beliefs,  which  are  acquired  through  their  external 
senses, in order to clarify the evidence and familiarise the ideas. They are 
not for purposes of deduction. For the Qur’an has placed hints and associa-
tions in the web of its verses which for investigators of the truth point to 
and indicate the pearls in those shells and the truths in the literal meanings. 
Yes, some verses of the Perspicuous Qur’an, which is the Word of Allah, 
expound other verses. That is, some verses disclose what is hidden in their 
sisters’ hearts. In which case, some may indicate others; their literal mean-
ings are not intended.

Misapprehension and Note

If it is said by way of inference or deduction (   i s t i d l â l   ) : consider the won-
ders of electricity, the marvels of [ the laws of ] general attraction, the daily 
and  annual  rotations  of  the  earth,  the  chemical  combinations  of  the  more 
than seventy elements, and the motionlessness of the sun together with its 
apparent motion! Know that the Maker exists! In this case, the art, which is

the evidence, would be more obscure than the conclusion, which is knowl-
edge of the Maker, and since it would be more obscure and contrary to the 
rules of inference, people would incline towards understanding some of the 
verses  literally.  But  such  verses  contain  associative  expressions  and  allu-
sions, and these are neither true nor false. For instance, the a l i f  in the word 
َلاَ(cid:162) is a l i f ; even if it is actually w ā w , or k ā f  even, it does not affect it.

Brother! Be fair! Aren’t these three objections the very clearest evidence 
of the miraculous inimitability of the Qur’an, which was revealed to guide 
all the people of all times. Indeed,

Indeed,  how  could  imagination  show  itself  to  be  the  truth  in  his  light-
scattering view. His way is pure truth and his method, purely right. Truth 
and right are free of deception and do not lead astray.

The Fifth Way

The Fifth Way 
This concerns the well-known apparent wonders and perceptible mira-
cles. The books of biography and history are loaded with them. The illus-
trious  ulema  ( May  Allah  reward  them  well )  have  categorised  them  and 
expounded  them  appropriately.  We  have  skipped  the  details  so  as  not  to 
teach what is already known. 

Although there may be no consensus concerning the transmission of all 
the instances of the apparent wonders (   m ü t e v â t i r   ) , 1 there are many in their 
different categories and so may be considered to be unanimously reported in 
respect of their meanings (   m ü t e v â t i r - i   b i l m â n â   ) . There are several catego-
ries of those wonders.

O n e   C a t e g o r y  is the various  i r h â s â t ;  2 As though that century  proﬁted 
from the Messenger ( UWBP ) as a highly sensitive wonderworker that had 
premonitions of his coming, and gave news of it.

1.  M ü t e v â t i r  ( Ar. m u t a w ā t i r  ) refers to the kind of report that is transmitted by numer-
ous authorities and about which there is no room for doubt; that is, a report concerning the 
authenticity of which there is a consensus of opinion.

2.    I r h ā s ā t :   the  paranormal  events  that  took  place  before  the  prophetic  mission  but 

which were related to it.

132

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

A n o t h e r   C a t e g o r y  was the numerous predictions of the future. As if the 
Messenger’s ( UWBP ) ethereal, winged spirit rent the bonds of ﬁxed time 
and space, roamed in the climes of the past and the future, then told us of 
what it had witnessed.

A n o t h e r :   Wonders  that  could  be  perceived  by  the  physical  senses  and 
were  performed  during  the  period  of  his  challenging  the  existing  order. 
These  have  been  said  to  number  nearly  a  thousand.  That  is  to  say,  as  we 
said, even if each miracle was reported from only one source  (   â h â d î   ) , in 
total they may be considered as being reported unanimously in respect of 
their meanings.

A n d  A n o t h e r  is water ﬂowing from his blessed ﬁngers. As though with its 
ﬂowing from his blessed hand, which was a source of muniﬁcence, the water 
– the leaven of life – was depicting the outpouring of the water of guidance 
– the leaven of spirits – from his tongue, which was the source of guidance.
A n d   A n o t h e r  was the utterances of trees, stones, and animals. As though 
the spiritual life of his guidance spread to inanimate beings and animals and 
brought them to speech.

A n d   A n o t h e r  was the splitting of the moon. As though the moon, which 
is like the heart of the sky, longingly split its pure shining breast at the sign 
of his blessed ﬁnger in order to form a relationship with his blessed heart.

Note

The  splitting  of  the  moon  may  be  held  to  be  unanimously  reported  in 
respect  of  its  meaning  (   m ü t e v â t i r - i   b i ’ l - m â n a   ) ,  and  is  established  by  the 
verse, ( 54:1 ) ﮯ  ~ . For those who denied the Qur’an did not object to 
it. And apart from one forced interpretation that does not deserve attention, 
the verse has not been interpreted otherwise.

Doubt and Note

The whole world did not necessarily witness the splitting of the moon 
since it was both unexpected, and it occurred at night when  people were 
heedless,  and  there  were  no  celestial  observations  at  that  time,  and  there 
were shooting stars, and the times of moonrise differed according to place. 
But it was afﬁrmed by those who were present at the time it occurred. One 
of these, and the ﬁrst and foremost, was the Perspicuous Qur’an. Its miracu-
lousness has been proved above to a small extent, in seven respects. And so 
on and so forth. I refer you to the relevant reliable books for the rest of the 
miracles.

Indication, Guidance, and Note

On science (   f e n n - i   h i k m e t   )  being sent as interrogator and questioner by 
the universe and the government of creation, it happened upon the vanguard 
of  humankind,  which  was  turned  towards  the  future,  and  it  posed  human 
beings  with  the  following  questions:  “ Sons  of  men!  Where  do  you  come 
from and at whose command? What are you doing? Where are you going? 
What is your origin? And what is your destination? ” Upon this, the guide, 
leader, and orator of humankind, Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ) rose to his feet and replied to science, which had proceeded from the 
government  of  creation:  “ Interrogator,  sir!  We  companies  of  beings  have 
come as ofﬁcials from the realm of divine power on the orders of the Pre-
Eternal Monarch. He is the Pre-Eternal Ruler, the Necessary Existent, the 
possessor of all the attributes of perfection. He has clothed us in the garment 
of existence and bestowed on us our faculties and capabilities, which are our 
capital and felicity. We companies of men are at present busy preparing for 
everlasting happiness. Then later we shall depart all together for the bodily 
resurrection of the dead and shall head for eternity. ”

So  science  (   h i k m e t   ) !  Don’t  quibble  or  talk  nonsense!  Relate  exactly 

what you have seen and heard! 

134

The Third Aim

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

The Third Aim 
This is the bodily resurrection of the dead. Yes, there would be no crea-
tion without it; it would be futile. The resurrection is indeed true and right, 
and its clearest proof is Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ).
Introduction

Introduction

The Perspicuous Qur’an has set forth bodily resurrection so clearly it has 
left not the slightest doubt concerning it. Here, as far as we can, we are going 
to point out several of its aims and stopping places in order to expound its 
proofs.

The First Aim

THE FIRST AIM: The following are truthful witnesses to bodily resur-
rection and true, veriﬁable proofs of it: the perfect order in the universe, the 
total wisdom in creation, the absence of futility in the world, the absence of 
waste in the innate disposition of things, the induction established by all the 
sciences, the repeated resurrections of a sort in many realms of beings such 
as the alternations of the days and years, the essence of the human capabili-
ties, the inﬁnite hopes of human beings, the All-Wise Maker’s mercy, the 
veracious Messenger’s ( UWBP ) tongue, and the expositions of the Inimi-
table Qur’an.

Stopping Place and Indication

1. If there were no everlasting happiness, the [ cosmic ] order would con-
sist only of a ﬂimsy and fatuous form. All its non-material aspects, bonds, 
and  relationships  would  go  for  nothing.  This  means  that  what  makes  the 
order order is eternal happiness.

2.  Divine  wisdom,  the  exempliﬁcation  of  pre-eternal  providence,  pro-
claims eternal happiness since it pursues uses and purposes in all beings. For 
if there were no eternal happiness, all the self-evident instances of wisdom 
and beneﬁts in the universe would compete with each other and cease to be 
thus. 

3. The absence of futility in creation, which is testiﬁed to by reason, wis-
dom, and induction, points to eternal happiness within the resurrection of 
the dead; indeed, is evidence of it. For absolute non-existence would make 
everything futile and pointless. 

4. The absence of waste in the nature of things, for instance, in the micro-
cosm that is man, which is testiﬁed to by the science of anatomy, proves the 

THIRD ARTICLE—THE ELEMENT OF DOCTRINE

135

absence of waste in man’s mental faculties, and hopes, ideas, and desires. 
And this announces that he is destined for eternal happiness. 

5. If it were not so, those faculties and desires would all wither up and go 
for nothing. Is it at all possible? Could the shell of a pearl worth the world 
be cherished and prized, protecting it from a speck of dust even, and then 
that priceless pearl be smashed and destroyed? No, indeed! It is cherished 
for its own sake.

6. Indeed, as explained above, the perfect [ cosmic ] order, the existence 
of which is established by induction and all the sciences, necessitates ever-
lasting  happiness  within  bodily  resurrection,  which  saves  the  order  from 
defect and disturbance, and will manifest perfectedness and eternal life. 

7. The days, years, human lifespan, and rotations of the world precede 
each other like the workings of a clock which count the seconds, minutes, 
hours, and days. They indicate that as the morning follows the night, and 
spring the winter, so the resurrection will follow on after death and appear 
from that workshop. Yes, each individual human being resembles a species, 
for the light of thought has given such breadth to his hopes that he would not 
be satisﬁed even if he swallowed all time. The nature, worth, view, attain-
ments, pleasures and pains of the members of other species are particular, 
individual, limited, restricted, and instantaneous; but those of  human beings 
are elevated, universal, and everlasting. The various sorts of recurrent diur-
nal and annual resurrections of many species hint at and point to a general, 
personal resurrection of man; indeed, they testify to it.

8. The unlimited potentialities included in the essence of man’s spirit, 
and the unlimited abilities contained in those potentialities, and the endless 
desires arising from those abilities, and the inﬁnite hopes resulting from 
those endless desires, and the limitless thoughts and ideas born of those 
inﬁnite  hopes  are  hands  stretched  out  towards  eternal  happiness,  which 
is  beyond  this  Manifest  World,  and  are  eyes  gazing  at  it,  being  turned 
towards it. 

9. The mercy of the All-Wise Maker, the All-Merciful and Compassion-
ate One, will bestow on the human race everlasting happiness, to make His 
bounties bounty and save them from being an afﬂiction and deliver the uni-
verse from the anguish of eternal separation. For if divine mercy were not to 
bestow everlasting happiness, the chief of all bounties, the bounties would 
turn into rancour and be transformed into an afﬂiction and one would have 
to deny the mercy the existence of which is indubitably established by the 
testimony of the whole universe. 

136

A PRESCRIPTION FOR THE ULEMA

Brother! Consider the various bounties of love, compassion, and affection, 
then think of everlasting separation and unending parting! Love becomes a 
grievous calamity. This means that eternal separation cannot confront love. 
Everlasting happiness will deal everlasting separation such a blow, it will 
despatch it to eternal non-existence! 

10. The ﬁve Ways set out above together with the tongue of our Prophet 
( UWBP ), whose truthfulness and veracity has been proven, are the keys to 
everlasting happiness within the treasury of bodily resurrection. 

11. The Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, the miraculous inimitability 
of which has been proved in seven respects for thirteen centuries, is the dis-
closer of bodily resurrection, and is its revealer and initiator. 

The Second Aim

THE SECOND AIM is an exposition of two proofs of resurrection which 

are alluded to by the Qur’an. As follows:

ِمـ(cid:193) ِ(cid:110)َ

ّر(cid:170)ا  ِن ٰ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:110)َ

ّر(cid:170)ا ِ

ّ(cid:195)ا ِمـ ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92)  : وُ(cid:115)َ(cid:178)

Ustad Bediuzzaman, the author of this treatise, wrote at the beginning of 

the Ninth Ray 1 of the Risale-i Nur, which he composed thirty years later: 

It is a subtle instance of dominical grace that thirty years ago at the end of his 
work entitled M u h â k e m a t  (   R a t i o n a l  A r g u m e n t s :  P r e s c r i p t i o n  f o r  t h e  U l e m a   ) , 
which  was  written  to  set  out  the  principles  of  Qur’anic  exegesis,  the  Old 
Said wrote: “ Second Aim: Two Qur’anic verses alluding to the resurrection 
ّ(cid:195)ا ِمـ ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92)  : وُ(cid:115)َ(cid:178)  ” 
of the dead will be expounded and explained. ِمـ(cid:193) ِ(cid:110)َ
There he stopped and could write no further. Now, praise and thanks be to 
my  Compassionate  Creator  to  the  number  of  signs  and  indications  of  the 
resurrection, that thirty years later He has given me success.
