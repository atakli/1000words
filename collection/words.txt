[ Brother! You wanted a few words of advice from me, so listen to a few 
truths included in eight short stories, which since you are a soldier, are 
in the form of comparisons of a military nature. I consider my own soul 
to need advice more than anyone and at one time I addressed it at some 
length  with  eight  Words  inspired  by  eight  verses  of  the  Qur’an  from 
which  I  had  beneﬁted.  Now  I  shall  address  my  soul  with  these  same 
Words,  but  brieﬂy  and  in  the  language  of  ordinary  people.  Whoever 
wishes may listen together with me. ]

The First Word 

ّ(cid:195)ا ِمـ ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) “ In the Name of Allah, ” is the start of all things good. We too 
shall start with it. Know, O my soul! Just as this blessed phrase is a mark 
of Islam, so too it is constantly recited by all beings through their tongues 
of disposition. If you want to know what an inexhaustible strength, what an 
unending source of bounty is ِ
ّ(cid:195)ا ِمـ ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) listen to the following story which is 
in the form of a comparison. It goes like this:

Someone who makes a journey through the deserts of Arabia has to 
travel in the name of a tribal chief and enter under his protection, for in 
this way he may be saved from the assaults of bandits and secure his needs.

THE WORDS

On  his own he will perish in the face of innumerable enemies and needs. As 
it happened, two men went on such a journey and entered the desert. One of 
them was modest and humble, the other proud and conceited. The humble 
man assumed the name of a tribal chief, while the proud man did not. The 
ﬁrst travelled safely wherever he went. If he encountered bandits, he said: “ I 
am travelling in the name of such-and-such tribal leader, ” and they did not 
molest him. If he came to some tents, he was treated respectfully due to the 
name. But the proud man suffered indescribable calamities throughout his 
journey. He both trembled before everything and begged from everything. 
He was abased and became an object of scorn.

My  proud  soul!  You  are  the  traveller  and  this  world  is  a  desert.  Your 
impotence and poverty have no limit, and your enemies and needs are end-
less. Since it is thus, take the name of the Pre-Eternal Ruler and Post-Eternal 
Lord of the desert and be saved from begging before the whole universe and 
trembling before every event.

Yes, this phrase is a treasury so blessed that your inﬁnite impotence and 
poverty bind you to an inﬁnite power and mercy; it makes your impotence 
and poverty an acceptable intercessor at the court of One All-Powerful and 
Compassionate. The person who acts saying “ In the Name of Allah ” resem-
bles someone who enrolls in the army. He acts in the name of the govern-
ment; he has fear of no one; he speaks, performs every matter, and with-
stands everything in the name of the law and the name of the government.

At the beginning we said that all beings say ِ

ّ(cid:195)ا ِمـ ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) through the tongue 

of disposition. Is that so?

Indeed, it is so. If you were to see that a single person had come and had 
driven all the inhabitants of a town to a place by force and compelled them 
to work, you would be certain that he had not acted in his own name and 
through his own power, but was a soldier, acting in the name of the govern-
ment and relying on the power of the king. 

In the same way, all things act in the name of Almighty Allah, for minute 
things like seeds and grains bear huge trees on their heads; they raise loads 
like mountains. That means all trees say: ِ
ّ(cid:195)ا ِمـ ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) ﬁll their hands from the 
treasury of mercy, and offer them to us. All gardens say: ِ
ّ(cid:195)ا ِمـ ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) and become 
cauldrons from the kitchens of divine power in which are cooked numerous 
varieties of different foods. All blessed animals like cows, camels, sheep, 
and goats, say: ِ
ّ(cid:195)ا ِمـ ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) and produce springs of milk from the abundance of

mercy, offering us a most delicate and pure food like the water of life in the 
name of the Provider. The roots and rootlets, soft as silk, of plants, trees, 
and grasses say: ِ
ّ(cid:195)ا ِمـ ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) and pierce and pass through hard rock and  earth. 
Mentioning the name of Allah, the name of the Most Merciful, everything 
becomes subjected to them.

The roots spreading through hard rock and earth and producing fruits as 
easily as the branches spread through the air and produce fruits, and the deli-
cate green leaves retaining their moisture for months in the face of extreme 
heat, deal a slap in the mouths of naturalist philosophers and jab a ﬁnger in 
their blind eyes, saying: “ Even heat and hardness, in which you most trust, 
are under a command. For like the Staff of Moses, each of those silken root-
lets conforms to the command, ( 60 :2 ) R Q P O and splits 
the  rock.  And  the  delicate  leaves  ﬁne  as  cigarette  paper  recite  the  verse, 
( 21:69 ) « ª © ¨ against the heat of the ﬁre, each like the members 
of Abraham ( UWP ).

Since  all  things  say:  ِ

ّ(cid:195)ا ِمـ ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92)  and  bearing  Allah’s  bounties  in  Allah’s 
ّ(cid:195)ا ِمـ ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) We should give in the 
name, give them to us, we too should say: ِ
name of Allah and take in the name of Allah. And we should not take from 
heedless people who neglect to give in Allah’s name.

Q u e s t i o n :  We give a price to people, who are like tray-bearers. So what 

price does Allah want, who is the true owner?

T h e  A n s w e r :  Yes, the price the True Bestower of Bounties wants in return 
for those valuable bounties and goods is three things: one is r e m e m b r a n c e , 
another is t h a n k s , and the other is r e ﬂ e c t i o n . Saying, ِ
ّ(cid:195)ا ِمـ ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) at the start is 
ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا at the end is thanks. And perceiving and think-
remembrance, and ِ
ing of those bounties, which are priceless wonders of art, being miracles of 
power of the Unique and Eternally Besought One and gifts of His mercy, is 
reﬂection. However foolish it is to kiss the foot of a lowly man who conveys 
to you the precious gift of a king and not to recognize the gift’s owner, it is a 
thousand times more foolish to praise and love the apparent source of boun-
ties and forget the True Bestower of Bounties.

O my soul! If you do not wish to be foolish in that way, give in Allah’s 
name, take in Allah’s name, begin in Allah’s name, and act in Allah’s name. 
And that should sufﬁce you!

Second Mystery

SECOND MYSTERY

In order not to overwhelm minds by divine unity, which is apparent in 
the boundless multiplicity of creatures, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposi-
tion constantly points out the manifestation of divine oneness within divine 
unity. For example, the sun encompasses numberless things with its light. A 
truly extensive conceptual ability and comprehensive view are necessary to 
behold the sun itself in the totality of its light. So, lest the sun be forgotten, it 
is displayed in every shining object by means of its reﬂection. And in accord-
ance  with  their  capacities,  all  lustrous  objects  reﬂect  the  sun’s  attributes, 
such as its light and heat and the seven colours in its light, together with the 
manifestation of its essence. So too, the sun’s attributes encompass all the 
things facing it. 

In exactly the same way,  ( 16:60 )  j  i  h – but let there be no 
mistake  in  the  comparison  –  just  as  divine  oneness  and  eternal  besough-
tedness  have  a  manifestation  together  with  all  the  divine  names  in  eve-
rything,  in  animate  creatures  in  particular,  and  especially  in  man’s  mir-
ror-like  essence;  so  too  through  divine  unity  each  of  the  divine  names 
connected  to  beings  encompasses  all  things.  Thus,  lest  minds  become 
overwhelmed  by  divine  unity  and  hearts  forget  the  Most  Pure  and  Holy 
Essence,  the  Qur’an  constantly  draws  attention  to  the  stamp  of  divine 

19

ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92)

What  makes  this  boundless  universe  rejoice  is  clearly  divine  mercy. 
What illuminates these dark beings is self-evidently divine mercy. What fos-
ters and raises creatures struggling with their endless needs is self-evidently 
again divine mercy. What causes the whole universe to be turned towards 
man,  like  a  tree  together  with  all  its  parts  is  turned  towards  its  fruit,  and 
causes it to look to him and run to his assistance is clearly divine mercy. 
What ﬁlls and illuminates boundless space and the empty, vacant world and 
makes it rejoice is self-evidently divine mercy. And what designates ephem-
eral man for eternity and makes him the addressee and beloved of the Pre-
Eternal and Post-Eternal One is self-evidently divine mercy.

ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) adhere to this truth and be saved 
from absolute desolation and the pains of unending needs! Draw close to the 
throne of the Pre-Eternal and Post-Eternal Monarch, and availing yourself of 
the compassionateness, intercession, and rays of divine mercy, become His 
addressee, friend, and beloved.

ّر(cid:170)ا ِ

All the realms of beings in the universe are purposively gathered around 
man and are made to hasten to meet all his needs with the utmost order 
and wisdom, and this clearly arises from one of two situations. Either each 
realm of beings knows man, obeys him, and runs to help him, which just as 
it is completely irrational is also impossible in many respects; or an abso-
lutely impotent being like man has to possess the power of the mightiest 
absolute sovereign; or this assistance occurs through the knowledge of an 
Absolutely Powerful One behind the veil of the universe. That is to say, 
it is not that the different beings in the universe know man, but that they 
are the evidences of a Knowing, Compassionate Being Who is acquainted 
with him and knows him.

O man! Come to your senses! Is it at all possible that the All-Glorious 
One, Who causes all the varieties of creatures to turn towards you and stretch 
out their hands to assist you, and to say: “ Here we are! ” in the face of your 
needs – is it possible that He does not know you, is not acquainted with you, 
does not see you? Since He does know you, He informs you through His 

20

ٰ
ٰ
mercy that He knows you. So you should know Him too, and with respect let 
Him know that you know Him, and understand with certainty that what sub-
jugates the vast universe to an absolutely weak, absolutely impotent, abso-
lutely needy, ephemeral, insigniﬁcant creature like you, and despatches it to 
assist you, is the reality of divine mercy, which comprises wisdom, favour, 
knowledge, and power.

and  earnest  and  genuine  respect.  Therefore,  say: 

Most certainly, a mercy such as this requires universal and sincere thanks, 
ّ(cid:195)ا  ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) 
which is the interpreter and expression of such sincere thanks and genuine 
respect. Make it the means of attaining to the mercy and an intercessor at the 
court of the All-Merciful.

ّر(cid:170)ا   ِن ٰ(cid:175)ْ(cid:110)َ

ِم(cid:193) ِ(cid:110)َ

ّر(cid:170)ا  ِ

The existence and reality of divine mercy are as clear as the sun. For just 
as a woven tapestry centred on one point is formed by the order and situa-
tion of the threads of its warp and weft coming from all directions, so too the 
luminous threads extending from the manifestation of the thousand and one 
divine names in the vast sphere of the universe weave such a seal of compas-
sionateness, tapestry of clemency, and seal of benevolence within a stamp 
of mercy, that it demonstrates itself to minds more brilliantly than the sun. 

The  Beauteous  All-Merciful  One,  Who  orders  through  the  rays  of  His 
thousand and one names the sun and moon, the elements and minerals, and 
plants  and  animals  like  the  warp  and  weft  of  a  vast  woven  tapestry,  and 
causes  them  to  serve  life;  and  demonstrates  His  compassion  through  the 
exceedingly  sweet  and  self-sacriﬁcing  compassion  of  mothers,  plant  and 
animal; and subjugates animate creatures to human life, and from this dem-
onstrates  man’s  importance  and  a  vast,  truly  delightful  tapestry  of  divine 
dominicality, and manifests His brilliant mercy; – that Most Merciful One 
has, in the face of His own absolute lack of need, made His mercy an accept-
able intercessor for animate creatures and man.
O man! If you are truly a human being, say: 

ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) Find 
that intercessor! For sure, it is clearly, self-evidently, divine mercy which, 
without forgetting or confusing any of them, raises, nurtures, and adminis-
ters the innumerable plant and animal species on the earth at precisely the 
right time and with perfect order, wisdom, and beneﬁcence, and stamps the 
seal of divine oneness on the face of the globe of the earth. The existence of 
divine mercy is as certain as the existence of the beings on the face of the 
earth, so do the beings offer evidences of its reality to their own number.

ٰ

Just as there is this seal of mercy and stamp of divine oneness on the face 
of the earth, so on the face of man’s nature is a stamp of divine mercy that is 
not inferior to the stamp of compassion and vast stamp of mercy on the face 
of the universe. Simply, man has so comprehensive a nature he is as though 
the point of focus of a thousand and one divine names.

O man! Is it at all possible that the One who gives you this face and places 
such a stamp of mercy and seal of oneness on it would leave you to your own 
devices, attach no importance to you, pay no attention to your  actions, make 
the whole universe, which is turned towards you, futile and pointless, and 
make the tree of creation rotten and insigniﬁcant with decayed fruit? Would 
He cause His mercy to be denied, although it is as obvious as the sun, as well 
as His wisdom, which is as clear as daylight, and neither of which can in any 
way be doubted, nor are in any way deﬁcient? Allah forbid!

mercy,  and  that  is, 

O man! Understand that there is a way to ascend to the throne of divine 
ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92)  If  you  want  to  understand  the 
importance of this ascent, look at the beginning of the one hundred and four-
teen suras of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, and at the beginnings of 
all estimable books, and at the start of all good works. A clear proof of the 
Allah-determined grandeur of  ِ
ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) is that Imam Shaﬁ‘i ( May Allah be 
pleased with him ), one of the very foremost Islamic scholars, said: “ In the 
Name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate is only one verse, yet it was 
revealed one hundred and fourteen times in the Qur’an. ”1

Fourth Mystery

FOURTH MYSTERY

In the face of the manifestation of divine unity within boundless multi-
plicity, to declare:  ( 1:5 ) 3 2 is not sufﬁcient for everyone; the mind 
wanders.  One’s  heart  would  have  to  be  as  broad  as  the  globe  to  observe 
the  Single  One  behind  the  unity  in  the  totality  of  beings,  and  to  say: 
5 4 3 2  In consequence, so that the seal of divine one-
ness  should  be  apparent  on  all  species  and  realms  of  beings  just  as  it  is

Single One, it is shown within the stamp of divine mercy. Thus everyone

ٰ
at  every  level  may  turn  to  the  Most  Pure  and  Holy  One,  and  declaring: 
“ You alone do we worship, and from You alone do we seek help, ” address 
Him directly.

It is in order to express this mighty mystery and clearly point out the seal 
of divine oneness that the All-Wise Qur’an suddenly mentions the smallest 
sphere and most particular matter when describing the vastest sphere of the 
universe, for example, the creation of the heavens and the earth. That is, so 
that the mind does not wander, nor the heart drown, and the spirit may ﬁnd 
its  True  Object  of  Worship  directly,  while  mentioning  the  creation  of  the 
heavens and earth it opens a discussion of man’s creation and voice, and the 
subtle details of the bounties and wisdom in his features, for example. This 
truth is demonstrated in miraculous fashion by the verse, 

( 30:22 ) w v u t s r q p o
Within innumerable creatures and inﬁnite multiplicity, there are stamps 
of unity like concentric circles of many sorts and degrees from the greatest 
stamp  to  the  smallest.  But  however  clear  the  unity,  it  is  still  unity  within 
multiplicity; it does not truly address observers. Hence, there has to be the 
stamp  of  divine  oneness  behind  unity  so  that  unity  does  not  call  to  mind 
multiplicity and before the Most Pure and Holy One a way may be opened 
up to the heart directly.

Furthermore, a truly captivating design, shining light, agreeable sweet-
ness,  pleasing  beauty,  and  powerful  truth  –  which  is  the  stamp  of  divine 
mercy  and  seal  of  divine  compassion  –  has  been  placed  on  the  stamp  of 
divine  oneness  in  order  to  direct  gazes  towards  it  and  attract  hearts.  Yes, 
it is the strength of that mercy that attracts the gazes of conscious beings, 
draws  them  to  it,  and  causes  them  to  reach  the  seal  of  oneness  and  to 
observe  the  Single  One,  and  from  that  to  truly  manifest  the  address  of

divine mercy. And the person who causes this interpreter to speak may learn 
about the mysteries of divine mercy and behold the lights of divine compas-
sion and pity.

Fifth Mystery

FIFTH MYSTERY

  1 ﯗﮑ ٰ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:110)َ

There is a Hadith which goes something like this: 
ّ(cid:195)ا َ
ّنِا
ْ(cid:202)ا  َقَ(cid:171)َ(cid:114) َ

ّر(cid:170)ا ِةَرو ُ(cid:134) ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) َناَ(cid:127)ْ(cid:178)ِ
It has been interpreted by some Suﬁs in an extraordinary way, unﬁtting for 
the  tenets  of  belief.  Some  of  them  who  were  ecstatics,  even,  considered 
man’s spiritual nature to be in the form of the All-Merciful. Since ecstatics 
are mostly immersed in contemplation and confused, they may be excused 
in holding views contrary to reality. But on consideration, people in their 
right senses cannot accept ideas of theirs that are contrary to the fundamen-
tals of belief. If they do, they are in error.

Indeed, the Most Pure and Holy Deity, Who administers with order the 
whole universe as though it were a palace or house, and spins the stars as 
though  they  were  particles  and  causes  them  to  travel  through  space  with 
wisdom and ease, and employs minute particles as though they were orderly 
ofﬁcials, has no partner, match, opposite, or equal. So too, according to the 
meaning of the verse:

( 42:11 ) 7 6 5  3 2 1
He has no form, like, or peer, and there is nothing resembling Him or similar 
to Him. However, according to the meaning of the following verse and its 
parabolic comparison,

( 30:27 ) P O N M L K J I H G 
His actions, attributes, and names may be considered. That is to say, allegory 
and  comparison  may  be  used  in  connection  with  His  actions.  One  of  the 
many things intended by the above-mentioned Hadith is: “ Man is in a form 
that  displays  the  divine  name  of  All-Merciful  in  its  entirety. ”  Yes,  as  we 
explained before, the divine name of All-Merciful is manifested through the 
rays of a thousand and one names on the face of the universe, and is apparent 
through the innumerable manifestations of Allah’s absolute dominicality on 
the face of the earth. Similarly, its complete manifestation is apparent in a 
small measure in man’s comprehensive form, the same as on the faces of the 
earth and universe.

The  Hadith  suggests  also  that  the  evidences  of  the  Necessarily  Exist-
ent  One  offered  by  such  proofs,  mirrors,  and  manifestations  of  the  Most

Merciful as animate creatures and human beings are so certain, clear, and 
obvious that just as it may be said of a shining mirror which reﬂects the 
image  of  the  sun:  “ That  mirror  is  the  sun, ”  indicating  the  clarity  of  its 
brilliance and evidence, so it has been said and may be said: “ Man is in 
the form of the All-Merciful One, ” indicating the clarity of his evidence 
and completeness of his relation. It is in consequence of this mystery that 
the more moderate of those who believed in the Unity of Existence said: 
“ There is no existent but He, ” as a way of expressing the clarity of this 
evidence and perfection of the relation.

Sixth Mystery

SIXTH MYSTERY

O  unhappy  man  afﬂicted  by  boundless  impotence  and  endless  wants! 
See from the following how valuable and acceptable an intercessor is divine 
mercy. For it is a way to know the All-Glorious Sovereign in Whose army 
both the stars and minute particles serve together in perfect order and obe-
dience – the Glorious Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, Who is 
self-sufﬁcient and utterly without need. He is rich without limit and in no 
way in need of the universe and its beings. The whole cosmos is under His 
command and direction, utterly obedient beneath His majesty and grandeur, 
submissive before His sublimity. That is divine mercy for you, O man! It 
raises you to the presence of the One Who lacks all need, the Eternal Sover-
eign, and makes you His friend, addressee, and well-loved servant. But just 
as you cannot reach the sun and are far from it although it ﬁlls your mirror 
with  its  light,  reﬂection,  and  manifestation,  and  you  can  in  no  way  draw 
near to it; in the same way you are inﬁnitely distant from the Most Pure and 
Holy One, the Sun of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, and cannot draw near 
to Him, but the light of His mercy brings Him nearer to us. 

O man! Anyone who ﬁnds this mercy ﬁnds an eternally unfailing treas-
ury  of  light.  And  the  way  to  ﬁnd  it  is  by  following  the  practices  of  the 
Most  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace ),  who  was 
the most brilliant exemplar and representative of mercy, its most eloquent 
tongue and herald, and was described in the Qur’an as a “ Mercy to All the 
Worlds. ”( 21:107 )

THE WORDS

The  way  to  attain  to  this  embodiment  of  mercy  who  is  a  mercy  to  all 
the worlds is to utter the prayer calling down Allah’s blessings upon him. 
Indeed, the meaning of this prayer is mercy. As a prayer of mercy for that 
living embodiment of divine mercy, it is a means of reaching the Mercy to 
All the Worlds ( UWBP ).1 So, make this prayer the means to the mercy to all 
the worlds for yourself, and at the same time make him the means of reach-
ing the mercy of the Most Merciful One.

The  whole  Muslim  community  in  all  its  vastness  uttering  this  prayer 
which is synonymous with mercy for the Mercy to All the Worlds ( UWBP ) 
proves  in  brilliant  fashion  what  a  precious  gift  is  divine  mercy,  and  how 
broad is its sphere.

To   C o n c l u d e :  Just as the most precious jewel in the treasury of mercy 
is  the Prophet Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), its door-
ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) and its most easy key the 

keeper, so is its ﬁrst key

If you want to understand what great happiness and bounty, what great 
pleasure and ease are to be found in belief in Allah, listen to this story which 
is in the form of a comparison:

One  time,  two  men  went  on  a  journey  for  both  pleasure  and  business. 
One  set  off  in  a  selﬁsh,  inauspicious  direction,  and  the  other  on  a  godly, 
propitious way.

Since the selﬁsh man was both conceited, self-centred, and pessimistic, 
he ended up in what seemed to him to be a wicked country due to his pes-
simism. He looked around and everywhere saw the powerless and the unfor-
tunate lamenting in the grasp of fearsome bullying tyrants, weeping at their 
destruction. He saw the same grievous, painful situation in all the places he 
travelled. The whole country took on the form of a house of mourning. Apart 
from drunkenness, he could ﬁnd no way of not noticing this grievous and 
sombre situation. For everyone seemed to him to be an enemy and foreign. 
All around he saw horrible corpses and despairing, weeping orphans. His 
conscience was in a state of torment.

The other man was godly, devout, fair-minded, and with ﬁne morals so 
that the country he came to was most excellent in his view. This good man 
saw universal rejoicing in the land he had entered. Everywhere was a joyful 
festival, a place for the remembrance of Allah overﬂowing with rapture and 
happiness; everyone seemed to him a friend and relation. Throughout the 
country he saw the festive celebrations of a general discharge from duties 
accompanied by cries of good wishes and thanks. He also heard the sound of 
a drum and band for the enlistment of soldiers, with happy calls of “ Allah is 
Most Great! ” and “ There is no god but Allah! ” Rather than being grieved at

THE WORDS

the suffering of both himself and all the people like the ﬁrst, miserable man, 
this fortunate person was pleased and happy at both his own joy and that of 
all the inhabitants. Furthermore, he was able to do some proﬁtable trade. He 
offered thanks to Allah.

After some while he returned and came across the other man. He under-
stood  his  condition,  and  said  to  him:  “ You  were  out  of  your  mind.  The 
ugliness  within  you  must  have  been  reﬂected  on  the  outer  world  so  that 
you imagined laughter to be weeping, and the discharge from duties to be 
sack  and  pillage.  Come  to  your  senses  and  purify  your  heart  so  that  this 
calamitous veil is raised from your eyes and you can see the truth. For the 
country of an utterly just, compassionate, beneﬁcent, powerful, order-lov-
ing, and kind king could not be as you imagined, nor could a country which 
demonstrated this number of clear signs of progress and achievement. ” The 
unhappy man later came to his senses and repented. He said, “ Yes, I was 
crazy through drink. May Allah be pleased with you, you have saved me 
from a hellish state. ”

O my soul! Know that the ﬁrst man represents an unbeliever, or some-
one  depraved  and  heedless.  In  his  view  the  world  is  a  house  of  universal 
mourning. All living creatures are orphans weeping at the blows of death 
and separation. Man and the animals are alone and without ties being ripped 
apart by the talons of the appointed hour. Mighty beings like the mountains 
and oceans are like horrendous, lifeless corpses. Many grievous, crushing, 
terrifying delusions like these arise from his unbelief and misguidance, and 
torment him. 

As for the other man, he is a believer. He recognizes and afﬁrms Almighty 
Allah. In his view this world is an abode where the names of the All-Mer-
ciful are constantly recited, a place of instruction for man and the animals, 
and a ﬁeld of examination for human beings and the jinn. Animal and human 
deaths are a demobilization. Those who have completed their duties of life 
depart from this transient world for another, happy and trouble-free, world, 
so that place may be made for new ofﬁcials to come and work. The birth of 
animals and humans marks their enlistment into the army, their being taken 
under arms, and the start of their duties. Every living being is a joyful regular 
soldier, an honest, contented ofﬁcial. And all voices are either gloriﬁcation 
of Allah and the recitation of His names at the outset of their duties, and the 
thanks and rejoicing at their ceasing work, or the songs arising from their 
joy at working. In the view of the believer, all beings are the friendly serv-
ants, amicable ofﬁcials, and agreeable books of his Most Generous Lord and

All-Compassionate  Owner.  Very  many  more  subtle,  exalted,  pleasurable, 
and sweet truths like these become manifest and appear from his belief.

That is to say, belief in Allah bears the seed of what is in effect a Tuba 
tree of Paradise, while unbelief conceals the seed of a Zakkum tree of Hell.
That means that salvation and security are only to be found in Islam and 

belief. In which case, we should continually say,

If you want to understand what great proﬁt and happiness lie in worship, 
and what great loss and ruin lie in vice and dissipation listen to and take heed 
of the following story which is in the form of a comparison.

One time, two soldiers received orders to proceed to a distant city. They 
set off and travelled together until the road forked. At the fork was a man 
who said to them, “ The road on the right causes no loss at all, and nine out 
of ten of those who take it receive a high proﬁt and experience ease of mind. 
While the road on the left provides no advantages and nine out of ten of its 
travellers make a loss. But the roads are the same as regards distance. Only 
there  is  one  difference:  those  who  take  the  left-hand  road,  which  has  no 
rules and no one in authority, travel without baggage and arms. They feel an 
apparent lightness and deceptive ease. Whereas those travelling on the right-
hand road, which is under military order, are compelled to carry a kitbag full 
of nutritious rations four  o k k a s  or so in weight and a superb army riﬂe of 
about two k ı y y e s  1 which will overpower and rout every enemy. ”

After the two soldiers had listened to what this instructive man had to 
say, the fortunate one took the road to the right. He loaded the weight of one 
b a t m a n  onto his back, but his heart and spirit were saved from thousands 
of b a t m a n s  of fear and feeling obliged to others. As for the other, luckless, 
soldier, he left the army. He did not want to conform to the order and he 
went  off  to  the  left.  He  was  released  from  bearing  a  load  of  one  b a t m a n , 
but his heart was constricted by thousands of b a t m a n s  of indebtedness and 
his spirit was crushed by innumerable fears. He proceeded on his way both 
begging from everyone and trembling before every object and every event

until he reached his destination. And there he was punished as a mutineer 
and a deserter.

As for the soldier who loved the order of the army, had guarded his kit-
bag and riﬂe, and taken the right-hand road, he had gone on his way being 
obliged to no one, fearing no one, and with an easy heart and conscience 
until he reached the city he was seeking. There he received a reward worthy 
of an honourable soldier who had carried out his duty faithfully.

O rebellious soul, know that one of those two travellers represents those 
who submit to the divine law, while the other represents the rebellious and 
those who follow their own desires. The road is the road of life, which comes 
from the Spirit World, passes through the grave, and carries on to the here-
after. As for the kit-bag and riﬂe, they are worship and fear of Allah. There 
is an apparent burden in worship, but there is an ease and lightness in its 
meaning that deﬁes description. For in the prescribed prayers the worshipper 
َ(cid:202) ْنَا ُدَ(cid:183) ْ(cid:130)َا That is to say, he ﬁnds the door of a treasury of 
declares, ُ
mercy in everything because he is believing and saying, “ There is no Crea-
tor and Provider other than Him. Harm and beneﬁt are in His hand. He is 
both All-Wise; He does nothing in vain, and He is All-Compassionate; His 
bounty and mercy are abundant. ” And he knocks on the door with his sup-
plication. Moreover, he sees that everything is subjugated to the command 
of his own Sustainer, so he takes refuge in Him. He places his trust in Him 
and relies on Him, and is fortiﬁed against every disaster; his belief gives him 
complete conﬁdence.

ّ(cid:202)ِا َهٰ(cid:170)ِا  ٓ

ّ(cid:195)ا  َ

Indeed,  like  with  every  true  virtue,  the  source  of  courage  is  belief  in 
Allah and worship. And as with every iniquity, the source of cowardice is 
misguidance.

In fact, for a worshipper with a truly illuminated heart, even if the globe 
of the earth were to become a bomb and explode, it would not frighten him. 
He  would  watch  it  with  pleasurable  wonder  as  a  marvel  of  the  Eternally 
Besought One’s power. But when a famous degenerate philosopher with a 
so-called enlightened mind but no heart saw a comet in the sky, he trembled 
on the ground and exclaimed anxiously: “ Isn’t that comet going to hit the 
earth? ” ( On one occasion, America was quaking with fear at such a comet 
and many people left their homes in the middle of the night. )

Yes,  man  is  in  need  of  numberless  things,  yet  his  capital  is  as  noth-
ing.  He  is  subject  to  endless  calamities,  yet  his  power  too  is  as  nothing. 
Simply,  his  capital  and  power  extend  only  as  far  as  his  hand  can  reach.

THE WORDS

However, his hopes, desires, pains, and tribulations reach as far as the eye 
and the imagination can stretch. Anyone who is not totally blind can see and 
understand then what a great proﬁt, happiness, and bounty for the human 
spirit, which is thus impotent and weak, and needy and wanting, are wor-
ship, the afﬁrmation of Allah’s unity, and reliance on Allah and submission 
to Him.

It is obvious that a safe way is preferable to a harmful way, even if the 
possibility of its safety is only one in ten. But on the way of worship, which 
our  matter  here,  there  is  a  nine  out  of  ten  possibility  of  its  leading  to  the 
treasury of eternal happiness, as well as its being safe. While it is established 
by  the  testimony  –  which  is  at  the  degree  of  consensus  –  of  innumerable 
experts and witnesses that besides being without beneﬁt, the way of vice and 
dissipation ends in eternal misery, as even the dissolute confess. According 
to the reports of those who have uncovered the mysteries of creation this is 
absolutely certain.

I n   S h o r t :  Like that of the hereafter, happiness in this world lies in wor-
ship and being a soldier for Almighty Allah. In which case, we should con-
stantly say:  ِق(cid:193)ِ(cid:158)ْوَ(cid:99)(cid:170)اَو ِةَ(cid:150)اَ

If you want to understand with the certainty that two plus two equals four 
just how valuable and important are the prescribed prayers, and with what 
little expense they are gained, and how crazy and harmful is the person who 
neglects them, pay attention to the following story which is in the form of a 
comparison:

One time, a mighty ruler gave each of two of his servants twenty-four 
gold  pieces  and  sent  them  to  settle  on  one  of  his  rich,  royal  farms  two 
months’ distance away. “ Use this money for your tickets, ” he commanded 
them, “ and buy whatever is necessary for your house there. There is a sta-
tion one day’s distance from the farm. And there is both road-transport, and 
a railway, and boats, and aeroplanes. They can be beneﬁted from according 
to your capital. ”

The two servants set off after receiving these instructions. One of them 
was fortunate so that he spent a small amount of money on the way to the 
station. And included in that expense was some business so proﬁtable and 
pleasing to his master that his capital increased a thousandfold. As for the 
other servant, he was luckless and a layabout, so spent twenty-three pieces 
of gold on the way to the station, wasting it on gambling and amusements. 
A single gold piece remained. His friend said to him: “ Spend this last gold 
piece  on  a  ticket  so  that  you  will  not  have  to  walk  the  long  journey  and 
starve. Moreover, our master is generous; perhaps he will take pity on you 
and forgive you your faults, and put you on an aeroplane as well. Then we 
shall reach where we are going to live in one day. Otherwise you will be 
compelled to walk alone and hungry across a desert which takes two months

to cross. ” The most unintelligent person can understand how foolish, harm-
ful, and senseless the servant would be if out of obstinacy he did  not spend 
that single remaining gold piece on a ticket, which is like the key to a treas-
ury, and instead spent it on vice for passing pleasure. Is that not so?

O you who do not perform the prescribed prayers! And O my own soul, 
which does not like to pray! The ruler in the comparison is our Sustainer, 
our Creator. Of the two travelling servants, one represents the devout who 
perform their prayers with fervour, and the other, the heedless who neglect 
their prayers. The twenty-four pieces of gold are life in every twenty-four-
hour day. And the royal domain is Paradise. As for the station, it is the grave. 
While the journey is man’s passage to the grave, and on to the resurrection, 
and the hereafter. Men cover that long journey to different degrees accord-
ing to their actions and the strength of their fear of Allah. Some of the truly 
devout have crossed a thousand-year distance in a day like lightning. And 
some have traversed a ﬁfty-thousand-year distance in a day with the speed 
of imagination. The Qur’an of Mighty Stature alludes to this truth with two 
of its verses (32:5; 70:4).

The ticket in the comparison represents the prescribed prayers. A single 
hour a day is sufﬁcient for the ﬁve prayers together with taking the ablutions. 
So what a loss a person makes who spends twenty-three hours on this ﬂeet-
ing worldly life, and fails to spend one hour on the long life of the hereafter; 
how he wrongs his own self; how unreasonably he behaves. For would not 
anyone  who  considers  himself  to  be  reasonable  understand  how  contrary 
to reason and wisdom such a person’s conduct is, and how far from reason 
he has become, if, thinking it reasonable, he gives half of his property to a 
lottery in which one thousand people are participating and the possibility of 
winning is one in a thousand, and does not give one twenty-fourth of it to an 
eternal treasury where the possibility of winning has been veriﬁed at ninety-
nine out of a hundred?

Moreover,  the  spirit,  the  heart,  and  the  mind ﬁnd  great  ease  in  prayer. 
And it is not trying for the body. Furthermore, with the right intention, all 
the other acts of the person who performs the prescribed prayers become like 
worship. He can make over the whole capital of his life to the hereafter in 
this way. He can make his transient life permanent in one respect.

( 16:128 ) Ø × Ö Õ Ô Ó Ò Ñ 
If you want to see what a truly human duty and what a natural, appropri-
ate result of man’s creation it is to perform the prescribed prayers and not 
to commit serious sins, listen to and take heed of the following comparison.
Once, at a time of general mobilization, two soldiers found themselves 
together in a regiment. One was well-trained and conscientious, the other, 
a  raw  recruit  and  self-centred.  The  conscientious  soldier  concentrated  on 
training and the war and did not give a thought to rations and provisions, for 
he knew that it was the state’s duty to feed and equip him, treat him if he was 
ill, and even to put the food in his mouth if the need arose. He knew that his 
essential duty was to train and ﬁght. But he would also attend to some of the 
rations and equipment as part of his work. He would boil up the saucepans, 
wash up the mess tins, and bring them. If it was then asked him: “ What are 
you doing? ”, he would reply: “ I am doing fatigues for the state. ” He would 
not say: “ I am working for my living. ”

The raw recruit, however, was fond of his stomach and paid no attention 
to training and the war. “ That is the state’s business. What is it to me? ”, he 
would say. He thought constantly of his livelihood, and pursuing it would 
leave the regiment and go to the market to do shopping. One day his well-
trained friend said to him:

“ Your duty is to train and ﬁght, brother. You were brought here for that. 
Trust in the king; he won’t let you go hungry. To feed you is his duty. Any-
way,  you’re  powerless  and  wanting;  you  can’t  feed  yourself  everywhere. 
And this is a time of mobilization and war; he’ll tell you that you’re muti-
nous and will punish you. Yes, we have two duties. One is the king’s duty: 

35

36

THE WORDS

sometimes we do his fatigue duties and he feeds us for it. The other is our 
duty: training and ﬁghting, and sometimes the king helps us with it. ”

Of course you will understand in what danger the layabout soldier would 
be if he did not pay attention to the striving, well-trained one. O my lazy 
soul! That turbulent place of war is this stormy worldly life, and the army 
divided into regiments, human society. The regiment in the comparison is 
the community of Islam in this century. One of the two soldiers is a devout 
Muslim who knows his religious obligations and performs them, and strug-
gles with Satan and his soul in order to give up serious misdoings and not to 
commit sins. While the other is a degenerate wrongdoer who is so immersed 
in the struggle for livelihood that he casts aspersions on the True Provider, 
abandons his religious obligations, and commits any sins that come his way 
as he makes his living. As for the training and instruction, it is foremost the 
prescribed prayers and worship. And the war is the struggle against the soul 
and its desires, and against the satans among jinn and men, to deliver them 
from sin and bad morals, and save the heart and spirit from eternal perdition. 
And the ﬁrst of the two duties is to give life and sustain it, while the other is 
to worship and beseech the Giver and Sustainer of life. It is to trust in Him 
and rely on Him.

Indeed, whoever made and bestowed life, which is a brilliant miracle of 
the Eternally Besought One’s art and a wonder of dominical wisdom, is he 
who maintains and perpetuates it through sustenance. It cannot be another. 
Do you want proof? The most impotent and stupid animals are the best nour-
ished; like ﬁsh, and worms in fruit. And it is the most helpless and delicate 
creatures who have the choicest food; like infants and the young of all spe-
cies. For sure, it is enough to compare ﬁsh with foxes, newly born animals 
with wild beasts, and trees with animals in order to understand that licit food 
is  obtained  not  through  power  and  will,  but  through  impotence  and  help-
lessness. That is to say, someone who gives up performing the prescribed 
prayers  because  of  the  struggle  for  livelihood  resembles  the  soldier  who 
abandoning his training and trench, went and begged in the market. But to 
seek one’s rations from the kitchens of the All-Generous Provider’s mercy 
after performing the prayers, and to go oneself so as not to be a burden on 
others is ﬁne and manly. It too is a sort of worship. 

Furthermore,  human  nature  and  spiritual  faculties  show  that  human 
beings are created for worship. For in respect of the power and actions nec-
essary  for  the  life  of  this  world,  they  cannot  compete  with  a  lowly  spar-
row. While in respect of knowledge and need, and worship and supplication,

which are necessary for spiritual life and the life of the hereafter, they are 
like the monarchs and commanders of the animals.

O my soul! If you make the life of this world the aim of your life and 
work constantly for that, you will become like the lowest sparrow. But if 
you make the life of the hereafter your aim and end, and make this life the 
means of it and its tillage, and strive in accordance with it, then you will be 
like a lofty commander of the animals and a petted and suppliant servant of 
Almighty Allah, and His honoured and respected guest.

Those two ways are open to you! You can choose whichever you wish! 

So ask for guidance and success from the Most Merciful of the Merciful!

If you wish to understand how proﬁtable a trade it is, and how honour-
able a rank, to sell one’s person and property to Allah, to be His slave and 
His soldier, then listen to the following comparison.

Once a king entrusted each of two of his subjects with an estate, includ-
ing all necessary workshops, machinery, horses, weapons and so forth. But 
since it was a tempestuous and war-ridden age, nothing enjoyed stability; it 
was destined either to disappear or to change. The king in his inﬁnite mercy 
sent  a  noble  lieutenant  to  the  two  men  and  by  means  of  a  compassionate 
decree conveyed the following to them:

“ Sell me the property you now hold in trust, so that I may keep it for you. 
Let it not be destroyed for no purpose. After the wars are over, I will return 
it to you in a better condition than before. I will regard the trust as your prop-
erty and pay you a high price for it. As for the machinery and the tools in the 
workshop, they will be used in my name and at my workbench, but the price 
and the fee for their use shall be increased a thousandfold. You will receive 
all the proﬁt that accrues. You are indigent and resourceless and unable to 
provide the cost of these great tasks, so let me assume the provision of all 
expenses and equipment, and give you all the income and the proﬁt. You 
shall keep it until the time of demobilization. So see the ﬁve ways in which 
you shall proﬁt! Now if you do not sell me the property, you can see that 
no  one  is  able  to  preserve  what  he  possesses,  and  you  too  will  lose  what 
you now hold. It will go for nothing and you will lose the high price I offer. 
The delicate and precious tools and scales, the precious metals waiting to 
be used, will also lose all value. You will have the trouble and concern of 
administering and preserving, but at the same time be punished for betraying 

38

SIXTH WORD

39

your trust. So see the ﬁve ways in which you may lose! Moreover, if you sell 
the property to me, you become my soldier and act in my name. Instead of 
being a common prisoner or irregular soldier, you will be the free lieutenant 
of an exalted monarch. ”

After they had listened to this gracious decree, the more intelligent of the 
two men said: “ By all means, I’m proud and happy to sell. I offer thanks a 
thousandfold. ”

But the other was arrogant, selﬁsh, and dissipated; his soul had become 
as proud as the Pharaoh. As if he were going to stay eternally on the estate, 
he ignored the earthquakes and tumults of this world. He said: “ No! Who is 
the king? I won’t sell my property, nor spoil my enjoyment. ”

After  a  short  time,  the  ﬁrst  man  reached  so  high  a  rank  that  everyone 
envied his state. He received the favour of the king, and lived happily in the 
king’s own palace. The other by contrast fell into such a state that everyone 
pitied him, but also said he deserved it. For as a result of his error, his happi-
ness and property departed, and he suffered punishment and torment.

O soul full of caprices! Look at the face of truth through the telescope 
of this parable. As for the king, he is the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-
Eternity, your Sustainer and Creator. The estates, machinery, tools and scales 
are your possessions while in life’s fold; your body, spirit, and heart within 
those possessions, and your outward and inward senses such as the eye and 
the tongue, intelligence, and imagination. As for the most noble lieutenant, 
it is the Noble Messenger of Allah; and the wise decree is the Wise Qur’an, 
which describes the trade we are discussing in this verse:

  ± ° ¯ ® ¬ « ª © ¨ § 
The surging ﬁeld of battle is the tempestuous surface of the world, which 
ceaselessly changes, dissolves and reforms and causes every man to think:

“ Seeing that everything will leave our hands, will perish and be lost, is 
there  no  way  in  which  we  can  transform  it  into  something  eternal  and  so 
preserve it? ”

While engaged in these thoughts, he suddenly hears the heavenly voice 
of the Qur’an saying: “ Indeed there is, a beautiful and easy way which com-
prises ﬁve proﬁts. ”

What is that way? To sell the trust received back to its true owner. Such 

a sale yields a ﬁvefold proﬁt.

40

THE WORDS

T h e  F i r s t  P r o ﬁ t :  Transient property becomes everlasting. For this waning 
life, when given to the Eternal and Self-Subsistent Lord of Glory and spent 
for His sake, will be transmuted into eternity. It will yield eternal fruits. The 
moments of one’s life apparently vanish and rot like kernels and seeds. But 
then the ﬂowers of blessedness and auspiciousness will open and bloom in 
the realm of eternity, and each will also present a luminous and reassuring 
aspect in the Intermediate Realm.

T h e   S e c o n d   P r o ﬁ t :  The high price of Paradise is given in exchange.
T h e   T h i r d   P r o ﬁ t :  The value of each limb and each sense is increased a 
thousandfold. The intelligence is, for example, like a tool. If you do not sell 
it to Allah Almighty, but rather employ it for the sake of the soul, it will 
become an ill-omened, noxious and debilitating tool that will burden your 
weak person with all the sad sorrows of the past and the terrifying fears of 
the future; it will descend to the rank of an inauspicious and destructive tool. 
It is for this reason that a sinful man will frequently resort to drunkenness 
or  frivolous  pleasure  in  order  to  escape  the  vexations  and  injuries  of  his 
intelligence. But if you sell your intelligence to its True Owner and employ 
it on His behalf, then it will become like the key to a talisman, unlocking 
the inﬁnite treasures of compassion and the vaults of wisdom that creation 
contains. It will thus rise to being a dominical guide preparing its owner for 
eternal bliss.

To take another example, the eye is one of the senses, a window through 
which  the  spirit  looks  out  on  this  world.  If  you  do  not  sell  it  to  Allah 
Almighty, but rather employ it on behalf of the soul, by gazing upon a hand-
ful of transient, impermanent beauties and scenes, it will sink to the level of 
being a pander to lust and the concupiscent soul. But if you sell the eye to 
your All-Seeing Maker, and employ it on His behalf and within limits traced 
out by Him, then your eye will rise to the rank of a reader of the great book 
of being, a witness to the miracles of dominical art, a blessed bee sucking on 
the blossoms of mercy in the garden of this globe.

Yet another example is that of the tongue and the sense of taste. If you do 
not sell it to your Wise Creator, but employ it instead on behalf of the soul 
and for the sake of the stomach, it sinks and declines to the level of a gate-
keeper at the stable of the stomach, a watchman at its factory. But if you sell 
it to the Generous Provider, the sense of taste contained in the tongue will 
rise to the rank of a skilled overseer of the treasuries of divine compassion, 
a grateful inspector in the kitchens of Allah’s eternal power.

SIXTH WORD

41

So  look  well,  O  intelligence!  See  the  difference  between  a  tool  of 
destruction and the key to all being! And look carefully, O eye! See the 
difference between an abominable pander and the learned overseer of the 
divine  library!  And  taste  well,  O  tongue!  See  the  difference  between  a 
stable  doorkeeper  or  a  factory  watchman  and  the  superintendent  of  the 
treasury of Allah’s mercy!

Compare all other tools and limbs to these, and then you will under-
stand that in truth the believer acquires a nature worthy of Paradise and 
the unbeliever a nature conforming to Hell. The reason for each of them 
attaining  his  respective  value  is  that  the  believer,  by  virtue  of  his  faith, 
uses the  trust of his Creator on His behalf and within the limits traced out 
by  Him,  whereas  the  unbeliever  betrays  the  trust  and  employs  it  for  the 
sake of the instinctual soul.

T h e   F o u r t h   P r o ﬁ t :   Man  is  helpless  and  exposed  to  numerous  misfor-
tunes. He is indigent, and his needs are numerous. He is weak, and the bur-
den  of  life  is  most  heavy.  If  he  does  not  rely  on  the  Omnipotent  One  of 
Glory, place his trust in Him and conﬁdently submit to Him, his conscience 
will always be troubled. Fruitless torments, pains and regrets will suffocate 
him and intoxicate him, or turn him into a beast.

T h e   F i f t h   P r o ﬁ t :   Those  who  have  experienced  illumination  and  had 
unveiled to them the true nature of things, the elect who have witnessed the 
truth, are all agreed that the exalted reward for all the worship and gloriﬁca-
tion of Allah performed by your members and instruments will be given to 
you at the time of greatest need, in the form of the fruits of Paradise.

If you spurn this trade with its ﬁvefold proﬁt, in addition to being deprived 

of its proﬁt, you will suffer ﬁvefold loss.

The First Loss: The property and offspring to which you are so attached, 
the soul and its caprice that you worship, the youth and life with which you 
are infatuated, all will vanish and be lost; your hands will be empty. But they 
will leave behind them sin and pain, fastened on your neck like a yoke.

The Second Loss: You will suffer the penalty for betrayal of trust. For 
you will have wronged your own self by using the most precious tools on the 
most worthless objects.

The Third Loss: By casting down all the precious faculties of man to a 
level much inferior to the animals, you will have insulted and transgressed 
against Allah’s wisdom.

42

THE WORDS

The Fourth Loss: In your weakness and poverty, you will have placed 
the heavy burden of life on your weak shoulders, and will constantly groan 
and lament beneath the blows of transience and separation.

The Fifth Loss: You will have clothed in an ugly form, ﬁt to open the 
gates of Hell in front of you, the fair gifts of the Compassionate One such 
as the intelligence, the heart, the eye and the tongue, given to you to make 
preparation for the foundations of everlasting life and eternal happiness in 
the hereafter.

Now  is  it  so  difﬁcult  to  sell  the  trust?  Is  it  so  burdensome  that  many 
people shun the transaction? By no means! It is not in the least burdensome. 
For the limits of the permissible are broad, and are quite adequate for man’s 
desire; there is no need to trespass on the forbidden. The duties imposed by 
Allah are light and few in number. To be the slave and soldier  of Allah is an 
indescribably pleasurable honour. One’s duty is simply to act and embark 
on all things in Allah’s name, like a soldier; to take and to give on Allah’s 
behalf; to move and be still in accordance with His permission and law. If 
one falls short, then one should seek His forgiveness, say:

“ O   L o r d !   F o r g i v e   o u r   f a u l t s ,   a n d   a c c e p t   u s   a s   Yo u r   s l a v e s .   M a k e   u s   s u r e

and make petition unto Him.

If you want to understand what valuable, difﬁculty-resolving talismans 
are the two parts of the phrase  ِر ِ(cid:114)ٰ
ّ(cid:195)اِ(cid:92)  ُتْ(cid:179)َ(cid:174)ٰا which solve both the 
enigmatical riddle of creation and open the door of happiness for the human 
spirit, and what beneﬁcial and curative medicines are reliance on your Crea-
tor and taking refuge in Him through patience and entreaty, and supplicating 
your Provider through thanks, and what important, precious, shining tickets 
for the journey to eternity – and provisions for the hereafter and lights for the 
grave – are listening to the Qur’an, obeying its commands, performing the 
prescribed prayers, and giving up serious sins, then listen and pay attention 
to this comparison:

One  time  a  soldier  fell  into  a  grave  situation  in  the  ﬁeld  of  battle  and 

examination, and the round of proﬁt and loss. It was as follows:

The soldier was wounded with two deep and terrible wounds on his right 
and left sides and behind him stood a huge lion as though waiting to attack 
him. Before him stood a gallows which was putting to death and annihilating 
all those he loved. It was awaiting him too. Besides this, he had a long jour-
ney before him: he was being exiled. As the unfortunate soldier pondered 
over his fearsome plight in despair, a kindly person shining with light like 
Khidr appeared. He said to him: “ Do not despair. I shall give you two talis-
mans and teach you them. If you use them properly, the lion will become a 
docile horse for you, and the gallows will turn into a swing for your pleas-
ure and enjoyment. Also I shall give you two medicines. If you follow the 
instructions,  those  two  suppurating  wounds  will  be  transformed  into  two 
sweet-scented  ﬂowers  called  the  Rose  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP ).  Also,  I 
shall give you a ticket; with it, you will be able to make a year’s journey in 

43

THE WORDS

a day as though ﬂying. If you do not believe me, experiment a bit, then you 
will see it is true. ” The soldier did experiment a bit, and afﬁrmed that it was 
true. Yes, I, that is, this unfortunate Said, afﬁrm it too. For I experimented 
and saw it was absolutely true. 

Some  time  later  he  saw  a  sly,  debauched-looking  man,  cunning  as  the 
Devil, coming from the left bringing with him much ornamented ﬁnery, and 
many decorated pictures and fantasies, and intoxicants. He stopped before 
the soldier, and said:

“ Hey, my friend! Let’s go and drink and make merry. We can look at 
these pictures of beautiful girls, listen to the music, and eat this tasty food. ” 
Then he asked him: “ What is it you are reciting under your breath? ”

“ A talisman, ” came the reply.
“ Stop that incomprehensible nonsense! Let’s not spoil our present fun! ” 

And he asked a second question: “ What is that you have in your hand? ”

“ Some medicine, ” the soldier replied.
“ Throw it away! You are healthy, there is nothing wrong with you. It 
is the time of cheer. ” And he asked: “ What is that piece of paper with ﬁve 
marks on it? ”

“ It is a ticket and a rations card. ”
“ Oh, tear them up! ”, the man said. “ What need do we have of a journey 
this beautiful spring? ” He tried to persuade him with every sort of wile, and 
the poor soldier was even a bit persuaded. Yes, man can be deceived. I was 
deceived by just such cunning deceptions.

Suddenly from the right came a voice like thunder. “ Beware! ”, it said. 
“ Do not be deceived! Say to that trickster: ‘If you have the means to kill 
the lion behind me, remove the gallows from before me, repulse the things 
wounding my right and my left, and prevent the journey in front of me, then 
come on and do so! Show that you can and let us see it! Then say, come on, 
let’s go and enjoy ourselves. Otherwise be silent!’ Speak in the same way as 
that Khidr-like Allah-inspired man. ”

O my soul, which laughed in its youth and now weeps at its laughter! 
Know that the unfortunate soldier is you, and man. The lion is the appointed 
hour. As for the gallows, it is death, decline, and separation, through which, 
in the alternation of night and day, all friends bid farewell and are lost. Of 
the two wounds, one is man’s inﬁnite and troublesome impotence, while the 
other  is  his  grievous  and  boundless  poverty.  The  exile  and  journey  is  the 

SEVENTH WORD

45

long journey of examination which passes from the world of spirits through 
the womb and childhood to old age; through the world and the grave and the 
Intermediate Realm, to the resurrection and the Bridge of Sirat. As for the 
two talismans, they are belief in Almighty Allah and the hereafter.

Yes,  through  the  second  sacred  talisman,  death  takes  on  the  form  of  a 
mastered horse, a steed to take believing man from the prison of this world to 
the gardens of Paradise and the presence of the Most Merciful. It is because 
of this that the wise who have seen death’s reality have loved it. They have 
wanted it before it came. And through the talisman of belief in Allah, the 
passage of time, which is decline and separation, death and decease and the 
gallows, takes on the form of the means to observe and  contemplate with 
perfect  pleasure  the  miracles  of  the  All-Glorious  Maker’s  various,  multi-
coloured,  ever-renewed  embroideries,  the  wonders  of  His  power,  and  the 
manifestations of His mercy. Yes, when mirrors reﬂecting the colours of the 
sun’s light are changed and renewed, and the images of the cinema changed, 
better, more beautiful scenes are formed. 

As for the two medicines, one is trusting in Allah and patience, and the 
other  is  relying  on  the  power  of  one’s  Creator  and  having  conﬁdence  in 
His wisdom. Is that the case? Indeed it is. What fear can a man have, who, 
through the certiﬁcate of his impotence, relies on a Monarch of the World 
with the power to command: ( 2:117 ) ² ± For in the face of the worst 
calamity, he says: ( 2:156 ) G F E D C and places his trust in his Most 
Compassionate Sustainer. A person with knowledge of Allah takes pleas-
ure  from  impotence,  from  fear  of  Allah.  Yes,  there  is  pleasure  in  fear.  If 
a  twelve-month  baby  were  sufﬁciently  intelligent  and  it  were  asked  him: 
“ What is most pleasurable and sweetest for you? ”, he might well say: “ To 
realize my powerlessness and helplessness, and fearing my mother’s gentle 
smack to at the same time take refuge in her tender breast. ” But the compas-
sion of all mothers is but a ﬂash of the manifestation of divine mercy. It is 
for this reason that the wise have found such pleasure in impotence and fear 
of  Allah,  vehemently  declaring  themselves  to  be  free  of  any  strength  and 
power, and have taken refuge in Allah through their powerlessness. They 
have made powerlessness and fear an intercessor for themselves.

The second medicine is thanks and contentment, and entreaty and sup-
plication, and relying on the mercy of the All-Compassionate Provider. Is 
that so? Yes, for how can poverty, want and need be painful and burdensome 

46

THE WORDS

for a guest of an All-Generous and Muniﬁcent One Who makes the whole 
face of the earth a table of bounties and the spring a bunch of ﬂowers, and 
Who places the ﬂowers on the table and scatters them over it? Poverty and 
need take on the form of a pleasant appetite. The guest tries to increase his 
poverty in the same way he does his appetite. It is because of this that the 
wise have taken pride in want and poverty. But beware, do not misunder-
stand this! It means to be aware of one’s poverty before Allah and to beseech 
Him, not to parade poverty before the people and assume the air of a beggar.
As for the ticket and voucher, it is to perform the religious duties, and 
foremost the prescribed prayers, and to give up serious sins. Is that so? Yes, 
it is, for according to the consensus of those who observe and have knowl-
edge  of  the  Unseen  and  those  who  uncover  the  mysteries  of  creation,  the 
provisions, light, and steed for the long, dark road to post-eternity may  only 
be obtained through complying with the commands of the Qur’an and avoid-
ing what it prohibits. Science, philosophy, and art are worth nothing on that 
road. Their light reaches only as far as the door of the grave.

O my lazy soul! How little and light and easy it is to perform the ﬁve 
daily prayers and give up the seven deadly sins! If you have the faculty of 
reason and it is not corrupted, understand how important and extensive are 
their results, fruits, and beneﬁts! Say to the Devil and that man who were 
encouraging you to indulge in vice and dissipation: “ If you have the means 
to kill death, and cause decline and transience to disappear from the world, 
and  remove  poverty  and  impotence  from  man,  and  close  the  door  of  the 
grave, then tell us and let us hear it! Otherwise, be silent! The Qur’an reads 
the universe in the vast mosque of creation. Let us listen to it. Let us be illu-
minated with its light. Let us act according to its guidance. And let us recite 
it constantly. Yes, the Qur’an is the word. That is what they say of it. It is the 
Qur’an which is the truth and comes from the Truth and says the truth and 
shows the truth and spreads luminous wisdom. ”

If  you  want  to  understand  this  world,  and  the  human  spirit  within  the 
world, and the nature and value of religion for man, and how the world is a 
prison if there is no true religion, and that without religion man becomes the

Long ago, two brothers set off on a long journey. They continued on their 
way until the road forked. At the fork they saw a serious-looking man and 
asked him: “ Which road is good? ” He told them: “ On the road to the right 
one is compelled to comply with the law and order, but within that hardship 
is security and happiness. However, on the left-hand road there is freedom 
and no restraint, but within its freedom lie danger and wretchedness. Now, 
the choice is yours! ”

After listening to this, saying, ِ

ّ(cid:195)ا ىَ(cid:171)َ(cid:150)  ُتْ(cid:171) َ
ﯯﯦَوَ(cid:98), the brother with a good 
character  took  the  right  road  and  conformed  to  the  order  and  regulations. 
The other brother, who was immoral and a layabout, chose the road to the 
left just for the lack of restrictions. With our imaginations, we shall follow 
this man in his situation, which was apparently easy but in reality burden-
some.

Thus, the man went up hill and down dale until he found himself in a 
desolate  wilderness.  He  suddenly  heard  a  terrifying  sound  and  saw  that  a

great lion had come out of the forest and was about to attack him. He ﬂed. 
He came across a waterless well sixty yards deep and in his fear jumped into 
it. He fell half-way down it where his hands met a tree. He clung on to it. 
The tree, which was growing out of the walls of the well, had two roots. Two 
rats, one white and one black, were attacking and gnawing through them. 
He looked up and saw that the lion was waiting at the top of the well  like a 
sentry. He looked down and saw a ghastly dragon. It raised its head and drew 
it close to his foot thirty yards above. Its mouth was as big as the mouth of 
the well. Then he looked at the well’s walls and saw that stinging, poisonous 
vermin had gathered round him. He looked up at the mouth of the well and 
saw a ﬁgtree. But it was not an ordinary tree; it bore the fruit of many differ-
ent trees, from walnuts to pomegranates.

Thus, due to his lack of thought and foolishness, the man did not under-
stand that this was not just some ordinary matter, these things were not here 
by chance, and that there were mysterious secrets concealed in these strange 
beings.  And  he  did  not  grasp  that  there  was  someone  powerful  directing 
them. Now, although his heart, spirit, and mind were secretly weeping and 
wailing at this grievous situation, his evil-commanding soul pretended that 
it was nothing; it closed its ears to the weeping of his heart and spirit, and 
deceiving itself, started to eat the tree’s fruit as though it were in a garden. 
But some of the fruit was poisonous and harmful. Almighty Allah says in a 
sacred hadith: يـِ(cid:92) ي ِدْ(cid:93)َ(cid:150)  ّ

ِنَ(cid:146) َدْ(cid:179)ِ(cid:150) اَ(cid:178)َا 1

Thus,  due  to  his  foolishness  and  faulty  thinking,  this  unhappy  man 
thought what he saw to be ordinary and the actual truth. So that is the way 
he was treated, and is treated, and will be treated. He neither dies so that he 
is saved from it, nor does he live – he is in such torment. Now we shall leave 
this ill-omened man in his afﬂiction and return, so that we may consider the 
situation of the other brother.

This  fortunate  and  intelligent  person  went  on  his  way,  but  he  suffered 
no distress like his brother. For, due to his ﬁne morals, he thought of good 
things and imagined good things. Everything was friendly and familiar to 
him. He did not suffer any difﬁculty and hardship like his brother, for he 
knew the order and followed it. He found it easy. He went on his way freely 
and in peace and security. Then he came across a garden in which were both

THE WORDS

lovely ﬂowers and fruits, and, since it was not looked after, rotting and ﬁlthy 
things. His brother had also entered such a garden, but he had noticed and 
occupied himself with the ﬁlthy things and they had turned his stomach, so 
he had left it and moved on without being able to rest himself. But this man 
acted according to the rule, ‘look on the good side of everything,’ and had 
paid no attention to the rotting things. He had beneﬁted a lot from the good 
things, and taking a good rest, he had left and gone on his way.

Later, also like the ﬁrst brother, he had entered a vast desert and had sud-
denly heard the roar of a lion which was attacking him. He was frightened, 
but not as much as his brother. For, because of his good thoughts and posi-
tive attitude, he thought to himself: “ This desert has a ruler, and it is possible 
that this lion is a servant under the ruler’s command, ” and found consola-
tion. But he still ﬂed until he came across an empty well sixty yards deep. He 
threw himself into it. Like his brother, his hand clasped a tree half-way down 
and he remained suspended in the air. He looked and saw two animals gnaw-
ing through the tree’s two roots. He looked up and saw the lion, and looked 
down and saw the dragon. Just like his brother he was seeing a most strange 
situation. He was terriﬁed like him, but his terror was a thousand times less 
than his brother’s. For his good morals had given him good thoughts, and 
good  thoughts  show  the  good  side  of  everything.  So,  because  of  this,  he 
thought as follows: 

“ These strange happenings are connected to someone, also it seems that 
they are acting under orders. In which case, these matters contain a talisman. 
Yes, everything is happening at the command of a hidden ruler. Therefore, I 
am not alone; the hidden ruler is watching me, he is testing me, he is impel-
ling  me  somewhere  for  some  purpose,  and  inviting  me  there.  A  curiosity 
arising from this pleasant fear and these agreeable thoughts prompt me to 
say: I wonder who it is that is testing me, wants to make himself known to 
me, and is impelling me for some purpose on this strange road. ”

Then, love for the owner of the talisman arose out of the desire to know 
him,  and  from  that  love  arose  the  desire  to  solve  the  talisman.  And  from 
that desire arose the will to acquire good qualities which would please and 
gratify the talisman’s owner. Then he looked at the tree and saw it was a ﬁg 
tree, but it was bearing the fruits of thousands of trees. So then all his fear 
left him, for he understood that for certain the ﬁg tree was a list, an index, 
an exhibition. The hidden ruler must have attached samples of the fruits in 
the garden to the tree through a miracle and with a talisman, and must have 

EIGHTH WORD

51

adorned the tree in a way that would point to each of the foods he had pre-
pared for his guests. For there is no other way a single tree could produce the 
fruits of thousands of different trees. Then he began to entreat that he would 
be inspired with the key to the talisman. He called out:

“ O ruler of this place! I have found myself here and I take refuge with 
you. I am your servant and I want to please you. I am searching for you. ” On 
making this supplication, the walls of the well suddenly parted and a door 
opened onto a wonderful, pleasant, quiet garden. Indeed, the dragon’s mouth 
was transformed into the door, and both it and the lion took on the forms of 
two servants; they invited him to enter. The lion even became a docile horse 
for him.

O my lazy soul! And O my imaginary friend! Come! Let us compare the 
position of these two brothers so that we can see how good comes of good 
and evil comes of evil. Let us ﬁnd out.

Look, the unhappy traveller on the left road is all the time trembling with 
fear waiting to enter the dragon’s mouth, while the fortunate one is invited 
into  a  blooming,  splendid  garden  full  of  fruit.  And  the  unfortunate  one’s 
heart is being pounded by an awful terror and grievous fear, while the fortu-
nate one is gazing at and observing strange things as a delightful lesson, with 
a pleasant fear and loving knowledge. Also the miserable one is suffering 
torments  in  desolation,  despair,  and  loneliness,  while  the  fortunate  one  is 
enjoying himself, full of hope, longing, and a sense of belonging. Further-
more, the unfortunate one sees himself as a prisoner subject to the attacks of 
wild beasts, while the fortunate one is an honoured guest who is on friendly 
terms and enjoying himself with the strange servants of his generous host. 
Also the unhappy one is hastening his torments by indulging in fruits which 
are  apparently  delicious  but  in  fact  poisonous.  For  the  fruits  are  samples; 
there is permission to taste them so as to seek the originals and become cus-
tomers for them, but there is no permission to devour them like an animal. 
But the fortunate one tastes them and understands the matter; he postpones 
eating them and takes pleasure in waiting. Moreover, the unfortunate one is 
wronging himself. Due to his lack of discernment, he is making a truth and a 
situation which are as clear and bright as daylight into a dark and oppressive 
fear, into a hellish delusion. He does not deserve pity, nor does he have the 
right to complain to anyone.

For example, if a person at a pleasant banquet in a beautiful garden in 
summer among his friends makes himself drunk through ﬁlthy intoxicants, 

52

THE WORDS

then  imagines  himself  hungry  and  naked  in  the  middle  of  winter  among 
wild animals and starts shouting out and crying, he does not deserve to be 
pitied; he is wronging himself, and he is insulting his friends by imagining 
them to be wild beasts. The unfortunate brother is like this. But the fortunate 
one sees the truth. And the truth is good. By perceiving the beauty of the 
truth, the fortunate brother is being respectful towards the truth’s owner. So 
he  deserves  his  mercy.  Thus,  the  meaning  becomes  clear  of  the  Qur’anic 
decree:  ( 4:79 ) ã â á à ß Þ Ý Ü Û Ú Ù Ø ×    If  you  com-
pare  the  other  differences  in  the  same  way,  you  will  understand  that  the 
evil-commanding soul of the ﬁrst brother has prepared a sort of hell for him, 
while the good intention, good will, good character, and good thoughts of 
the other have allowed him to receive abundant bounty, experience true hap-
piness and prosperity, and to display shining virtue.

O my soul! And O you who is listening to this story together with my  
soul! If you do not want to be the unfortunate brother and want to be the 
fortunate one, listen to the Qur’an, obey its decrees, adhere to them, and act 
in accordance with them!

If you have understood the truths in this comparison, you will be able to 
make them correspond to the truths of religion, the world, man, and belief 
in Allah. I shall point out the important ones, then you may deduce the ﬁner 
points yourself.

So, look! Of the two brothers, one is a believing spirit and a righteous 
heart. The other is an unbelieving spirit and a depraved heart. Of the two 
roads, the one to the right is the way of the Qur’an and belief in Allah, while 
the left one is the road of rebellion and denial. The garden on the road is 
man’s ﬂeeting life in human society and civilization, where good and evil, 
and  things  good  and  bad  and  clean  and  dirty  are  found  side  by  side.  The 
sensible person is he who acts according to the rule: ْرَدﯬﯦ اَ(cid:174) ْعَد اَ(cid:159)َ(cid:134) اَ(cid:174) ْذُ(cid:114) 
and goes on his way with tranquillity of heart. As for the desert, it is the 
earth  and  this  world.  The  lion  is  death  and  the  appointed  hour.  The  well 
is man’s body and the time of his life, while its sixty-yard depth points to 
the normal lifespan of sixty years. And the tree is the period of life and the 
substance of life. The two animals, one white and one black, are night and 
day. The dragon is the road to the Intermediate Realm and pavilion of the 
hereafter, whose mouth is the grave. But for the believer, its mouth is a door 

EIGHTH WORD

53

opening from a prison onto a garden. As for the poisonous vermin, they are 
the calamities of this world. But for the believer they are like gentle divine 
warnings and favours of the Most Merciful to prevent him slipping off into 
the sleep of heedlessness. The fruits on the tree are the bounties of this world 
which the Absolutely Generous One has made in the form of a list of the 
bounties of the hereafter, and both as examples of them, and warnings, and 
samples inviting customers to the fruits of Paradise. And the tree producing 
numerous different fruits despite being a single tree indicates the seal of the 
Eternally Besought One’s power, the stamp of divine dominicality, and the 
signet of the sovereignty of the Godhead. For ‘to make everything from one 
thing,’ that is, to make all plants and fruits from earth, and create all animals 
from a ﬂuid, and to create all the limbs and organs of animals from a simple 
food, together with ‘making everything one thing,’ that is, arts like weav-
ing a simple skin and making ﬂesh particular to each animal from the great 
variety of foods that animals eat, is an inimitable stamp and seal peculiar to 
the Ruler of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, Who is the Single and Eternally 
Besought. For sure, to make one thing everything, and everything one thing 
is a sign, a mark, peculiar to the Creator of all things, the One Powerful over 
all things.

As for the talisman, it is the mystery of the purpose of creation which is

guidance and rebellion the grave is a door opening, in desolation and obliv-
ion, onto a grave distressing as a dungeon and narrow as a dragon’s stomach, 
for the people of the Qur’an and belief, it is a door which opens from the 
prison of this world onto the ﬁelds of immortality, from the arena of exami-
nation onto the gardens of Paradise, and from the hardships of life onto the 
mercy of the All-Merciful. The savage lion turning into a friendly servant 
and a docile mount is a sign that, although for the people of misguidance, 
death is a bitter, eternal parting from all their loved ones, and the expulsion 
from  the  deceptive  paradise  of  this  world  and  the  entry  in  desolation  and 
loneliness into the dungeon of the grave, for the people of guidance and the 
Qur’an it is the means of joining all their old friends and beloved ones who 
have already departed for the next world, and the means of entering their 
true homeland and abode of everlasting happiness. It is an invitation to the 
meadows of Paradise from the prison of this world, and a time to receive the

wage bestowed out of the generosity of the Most Merciful and Compassion-
ate One for services rendered to Him, and a discharge from the hardship of 
the duties of life, and a release from the drill and instruction of worship and 
examination.

I n   S h o r t :  Whoever makes this ﬂeeting life his purpose and aim is in fact 
in Hell even if apparently in Paradise. And whoever is turned in all serious-
ness  towards  eternal  life  receives  the  happiness  of  both  worlds.  However 
difﬁcult and distressing this world is for him, since he sees it as the waiting-
room for Paradise, he endures it and offers thanks in patience.

Brother!  You  ask  me  concerning  the  wisdom  in  the  speciﬁed  times  of 
the ﬁve daily prayers. 1 I shall point out only one of the many instances of 
wisdom in the times.

Yes, just as each of the times of prayer marks the start of an important 
revolution, so also is each a mirror to the divine disposal of power and to the 
universal divine bounties within that disposal. Thus, more gloriﬁcation and 
extolling of the All-Powerful One of Glory have been ordered at those times, 
and more praise and thanks for all the innumerable bounties accumulated 
between each of the times, for this is the meaning of the prescribed prayers. 
In order to understand a little this subtle and profound meaning, you should 
listen together with my own soul to the following ﬁve points.

FIRST POINT

The meaning of the prayers is the offering of gloriﬁcation, praise, and 
ّ(cid:195)ا َناَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126) by word and

THE WORDS

and body, it is to offer thanks before His utter beauty. That is to say, glori-
ﬁcation, exaltation, and praise are like the seeds of the prayers. That is why 
the three are present in every part of  them, in all the actions and words. It 
is  also  why  these  blessed  words  are  each  repeated  thirty-three  times  after 
the prayers 1, in order to strengthen and reiterate the prayers’ meaning. The 
prayers’ meaning is conﬁrmed through these concise summaries.

SECOND POINT

The  meaning  of  worship  is  this,  that  the  servant  sees  his  own  faults, 
impotence, and poverty, and in the divine court prostrates in love and won-
derment  before  dominical  perfection,  divine  mercy,  and  the  power  of  the 
Eternally Besought One. That is to say, just as the sovereignty of dominical-
ity demands worship and obedience, so also does the holiness of domini-
cality require that the servant sees his faults through seeking forgiveness, 
ّ(cid:195)ا  َناَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126)  proclaims  that  his 
and  through  his  gloriﬁcations  and  declaring  ِ
Sustainer is pure and free of all defects, and exalted above and far from the 
false ideas of the people of misguidance, and hallowed and exempt from all 
the faults in the universe.

Also, the perfect power of dominicality requires that understanding his 
own weakness and the impotence of other creatures, the servant proclaims 
ّ(cid:195)َا in admiration and wonder before the majesty of the works of the 
ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ
Eternally Besought One’s power, and bowing in deep humility seeks refuge 
in Him and places his trust in Him.

Also, the inﬁnite treasury of dominicality’s mercy requires that the serv-
ant makes known his own need and the needs and poverty of all creatures 
through the tongue of entreaty and supplication, and proclaims his Sustain-
ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا 
er’s bounties and gifts through thanks and laudation and uttering ِ
That is to say, the words and actions of the prayers comprise these meanings, 
and have been laid down from the side of Divinity.

THIRD POINT

Just  as  man  is  an  example  in  miniature  of  the  greater  world  and  Sura 
al-Fatiha a shining sample of the Qur’an of Mighty Stature, so are the pre-
scribed prayers a comprehensive, luminous index of all the varieties of wor-
ship, and a sacred map pointing to all the shades of worship of all the classes 
of creatures.

The second hand, minute hand, hour hand, and day hand of a clock which 
tells the weeks look to one another, are examples of one another,  and follow 
one another. Similarly, the alternations of day and night, which are like the 
seconds of this world – a vast clock of Almighty Allah – and the years which 
tell its minutes, and the stages of man’s lifespan which tell the hours, and 
the epochs of the world’s lifespan which tell the days look to one another, 
are examples of one another, resemble one another, and recall one another. 
For example:

T h e   t i m e   o f   F a j r ,   t h e   e a r l y   m o r n i n g :  This time until sunrise resembles 
and calls to mind the early spring, the moment of conception in the mother’s 
womb, and the ﬁrst of the six days of the creation of the heavens and earth; 
it recalls the divine acts present in them.

T h e   t i m e   o f   Z u h r ,   j u s t   p a s t   m i d d a y :  This resembles and points to mid-
summer,  and  the  prime  of  youth,  and  the  period  of  man’s  creation  in  the 
lifetime of the world, and calls to mind the manifestations of mercy and the 
abundant bounties they contain.

T h e   t i m e   o f   ‘ A s r ,   a f t e r n o o n :  This is like autumn, and old age, and the 
time of the Final Prophet ( UWBP ), known as the Era of Bliss, and recalls 
the divine acts and favours of the All-Merciful present in them.

T h e   t i m e   o f   M a g h r i b ,   s u n s e t :  By recalling the departure of many crea-
tures  at  the  end  of  autumn,  and  human  death,  and  the  destruction  of  the 
world at the commencement of the resurrection, this time puts in mind the 
manifestations of divine glory and sublimity, and rouses man from his slum-
bers of heedlessness.

T h e   t i m e   o f   ‘ I s h a ,   n i g h t f a l l . As for this time, it calls to mind the world 
of darkness veiling all the objects of the daytime world with a black shroud, 
and  winter  hiding  the  face  of  the  dead  earth  with  its  white  cerement,  and 
even the remaining works of departed men dying and passing beneath the 
veil of oblivion, and this world, the arena of examination, being shut up and 
closed down for ever, and this proclaims the awesome and mighty disposals 
of the All-Glorious and Compelling Subduer.

As for t h e   n i g h t t i m e , through putting in mind both the winter, and the 
grave, and the Intermediate Realm, it reminds man how needy is the human 
spirit for the Most Merciful One’s mercy. And the t a h a j j u d   p r a y e r  informs 
him what a necessary light it is for the night of the grave and darkness of 
the Intermediate Realm; it warns him of this, and by recalling the inﬁnite 

58

THE WORDS

bounties of the True Bestower, proclaims how deserving He is of praise 
and thanks.

And t h e   s e c o n d   m o r n i n g  calls to mind the morning of the resurrection. 
For sure, however reasonable and necessary and certain the morning of this 
night is, the morning of the resurrection and the spring following the Inter-
mediate Realm are certain to the same degree.

That is to say, just as each of these ﬁve times marks the commencement 
of an important revolution and recalls other great revolutions, so through the 
awesome daily disposals of the Eternally Besought One’s power, each calls 
to mind the miracles of divine power and gifts of divine mercy of both every 
year, and every age, and every epoch. That is to say, the prescribed prayers, 
which are an innate duty and the basis of worship and an incontestable debt, 
are most appropriate and ﬁtting for these times.

FIFTH POINT

By nature man is extremely weak, yet everything touches him and sad-
dens and grieves him. Also he is utterly lacking in power, yet the calamities 
and enemies that afﬂict him are extremely numerous. Also he is extremely 
wanting, yet his needs are indeed many. Also he is lazy and incapable, yet 
life’s  responsibilities  are  most  burdensome.  Also  his  humanity  has  con-
nected him to the rest of the universe, yet the decline and disappearance of 
the things he loves and with which he is familiar continually pains him. Also 
his reason shows him exalted aims and lasting fruits, yet his hand is short, 
his life brief, his power slight, and his patience little.

It can be clearly understood from this how essential it is for a spirit in this 
state at the time of F a j r  in the early morning to have recourse to and present 
a petition at the court of an All-Powerful One of Glory, an All-Compassion-
ate All-Beauteous One through prayer and supplication, to seek success and 
help from Him, and what a necessary source of support it is so that he can 
face the things that will happen to him in the coming day and bear the duties 
that will be loaded on him.

The time of  Z u h r  just past midday is the time of the day’s zenith and 
the start of its decline, the time when daily labours approach their comple-
tion,  the  time  of  a  short  rest  from  the  pressures  of  work,  when  the  spirit 
needs a pause from the heedlessness and insensibility caused by toil, and a 
time divine bounties are manifested. Anyone may understand then how ﬁne 
and agreeable, how necessary and appropriate it is for the human spirit to 
perform the midday prayer, which means to be released from the pressure, 

NINTH WORD

shake  off  the  heedlessness,  and  leave  behind  those  meaningless,  transient 
things, and clasping one’s hands at the court of the True Bestower of Boun-
ties,  the  Eternally  Self-Subsistent  One,  to  offer  praise  and  thanks  for  all 
His gifts, and seek help from Him, and bowing to display one’s impotence 
before His glory and tremendousness, and to prostrate and proclaim one’s 
wonder, love, and humility. The person who does not understand this is not 
a true human being.

As for the time of ‘ A s r  in the afternoon, it calls to mind the melancholy  
season of autumn and the mournful state of old age and the sombre period at 
the end of time. It is also when the matters of the day reach their conclusion, 
and the time such divine bounties as have been received that day like health, 
well-being, and beneﬁcial duties have accumulated to form a great total, and 
the time that proclaims through the mighty sun hinting by starting to sink 
that man is a guest-ofﬁcial and that everything is transient and inconstant. 
Now, the human spirit desires eternity and was created for it; it worships 
benevolence, and is pained by separation. Thus, anyone who is truly human 
may  understand  what  an  exalted  duty,  what  an  appropriate  service,  what 
a  ﬁtting  way  to  repay  a  debt  of  human  nature,  indeed,  what  an  agreeable 
pleasure it is to perform the afternoon prayer. For by offering supplications 
at the eternal court of the Everlasting Pre-Eternal One, the Eternally Self-
Subsistent One, it has the meaning of taking refuge in the grace of unending, 
inﬁnite mercy, and by offering thanks and praise in the face of innumerable 
bounties, of humbly bowing before the mightiness of His dominicality, and 
by prostrating in utter humility before the everlastingness of His Godhead, 
of ﬁnding true consolation of heart and ease of spirit, and being girded ready 
for worship in the presence of His grandeur.

The time of M a g h r i b  at sunset recalls the disappearance amid sad fare-
wells of the delicate, lovely creatures of the worlds of summer and autumn at 
the start of winter. It calls to mind the time when due to his death, man will 
leave behind all those he loves in sorrowful departure and enter the grave. 
It brings to mind when at the death of this world amid the convulsions of its 
death-agonies, all its inhabitants will migrate to other worlds and the lamp of 
this place of examination will be extinguished. It is a time which gives stern 
warning to those who worship transient, ephemeral beloveds.

Thus, at such a time, for the M a g h r i b prayer, the human spirit, which by 
its nature is a mirror desirous for an Eternal Beauty, turns its face towards the 
throne of mightiness of the Eternal Undying One, the Enduring Everlasting

lime Sustainer. And prostrating before the undying beauty of His Essence, 
His unchanging sacred attributes, His constant everlasting perfection, and 
abandoning all things other than Him, man proclaims his love and worship 
in wonder and self-abasement. He ﬁnds an All-Compassionate Eternal One.

Then,  he  testiﬁes  to  Allah’s  unity  and  the  prophethood  of  Muhammad 
( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace ).  He  sits,  and  on  his  own  account 
offers as a gift to the Undying All-Beauteous One, the Enduring All-Glo-
rious  One,  the  blessed  salutations  and  benedictions  of  all  creatures.  And 
greeting Allah’s Most Noble Messenger ( UWBP ), he renews his allegiance 
to him and proclaims his obedience to his commands. In order to renew and 
illuminate his belief, he observes the wise order in this palace of the universe 
and testiﬁes to the unity of the All-Glorious Maker. And he testiﬁes to the 
messengership of Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ), who is the herald of the sovereignty of Allah’s dominicality, the pro-
claimer of those things pleasing to Him, and the interpreter of the signs and 
verses of the book of the universe. To perform the M a g h r i b  prayer is this. 
So how can a person be considered a human being if he does not understand 
what a ﬁne and pure duty is the prayer at sunset, what an exalted and pleas-
urable act of service, what an agreeable and pleasing act of worship, what a 
serious matter, and what an unending conversation and permanent happiness 
it is in this transient guesthouse?

At  the  time  of  ‘ I s h a   at  nightfall,  the  last  traces  of  the  day  remaining 
on  the  horizon  disappear  and  the  world  of  night  enfolds  the  universe.  As 
ّ(cid:171)َ(cid:163)ُ(cid:174) ( See, 24:44 ), turns the 
the All-Powerful and Glorious One,  ِراَ(cid:183)َ
white page of day into the black page of night through the mighty disposals 
of His dominicality, it recalls the divine activities of that All-Wise One of 
Perfection, ِر َ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:163)ْ(cid:170)اَو 
ّ(cid:115)َ(cid:127)ُ(cid:174) ( See, 13:2 ), turning the green-adorned page 
of  summer  into  the  frigid  white  page  of  winter.  And  with  the  remaining 
works of the departed being erased from this world with the passing of time, 
it recalls the divine acts of “ T h e   C r e a t o r   a n d   L i f e   a n d   D e a t h  ”( See, 67:2 ) in 
their passage to another, quite different world. It is a time that calls to mind 
the disposals of “ T h e   C r e a t o r   o f   t h e   H e a v e n s   a n d   t h e   E a r t h ’s ” awesome-
ness and the manifestations of His beauty in the utter destruction of this nar-
row, ﬂeeting, and lowly world, the terrible death-agonies of its decease, and 
in the unfolding of the broad, eternal, and majestic world of the hereafter. 
And the universe’s Owner, its  True Disposer, its True Beloved and Object 
of Worship can only be the One Who with ease turns night into day, winter 
into spring, and this world into the hereafter like the pages of a book; Who 
writes and erases them, and changes them.

Thus,  at  nightfall,  man’s  spirit,  which  is  inﬁnitely  impotent  and 
weak,  and  inﬁnitely  poor  and  needy,  and  plunged  into  the  inﬁnite  dark-
ness  of  the  future,  and  tossed  around  amid  innumerable  events,  per-
forms the  ‘ I s h a  prayer, which has this meaning: like Abraham, man says: 
( 6:76 ) L K J and with the prayers seeks refuge at the court of an 
Undying Object of Worship, an Eternal Beloved, and in this transient world 
and ﬂeeting life and dark world and black future he supplicates One Who 
is Enduring and Everlasting, and for a moment of unending conversation, 
a few seconds of immortal life, he asks to receive the favours of the All-
Merciful  and  Compassionate  One’s  mercy  and  the  light  of  His  guidance, 
which will strew light on his world and illuminate his future and bind up the 
wounds resulting from the departure and decline of all creatures and friends. 
Temporarily man forgets the hidden world, which has forgotten him, and 
pours out his woes at the court of mercy with his weeping, and whatever hap-
pens, before sleeping – which resembles death – he performs his last duty 
of worship. And in order to close favourably the daily record of his actions, 
he  rises  to  pray;  that  is  to  say,  he  rises  to  enter  the  presence  of  an  Eter-
nal Beloved and Worshipped One in place of all the mortal ones he loves, 

62

THE WORDS

of an All-Powerful and Generous One in place of all the impotent creatures 
from which he begs, of an All-Compassionate Protector so as to be saved 
from the evil of the harmful beings before which he trembles.

He starts with the Sura al-Fatiha, that is, instead of praising and being 
obliged  to  defective,  wanting  creatures,  for  which  they  are  not  suited, 
he  extols  and  offers  praise  to  “ T h e   S u s t a i n e r   o f   A l l   t h e   Wo r l d s , ”  Who  is 
Absolutely  Perfect  and  Utterly  Self-Sufﬁcient  and  Most  Compassionate 
and  All-Generous.  Then  he  progresses  to  the  address: 3 2  That  is, 
despite  man’s  smallness,  insigniﬁcance,  and  aloneness,  through  his  con-
t h e   D a y   o f   J u d g e m e n t , ”  Who  is  the  Sover-
nection  with  “ T h e   O w n e r   o f  
eign  of  Pre-Eternity  and  Post-Eternity,  he  attains  to  a  rank  whereat  he  is 
an  indulged  guest  in  the  universe  and  a  high-ranking  ofﬁcial.  Declaring: 
5 4 3 2 he presents to Him in the name of all creatures 
the  worship  and  calls  for  assistance  of  the  mighty  congregation  and  huge 

community of the universe. Then saying: 9 8 7 he asks to 

be guided to the Straight Path, which leads to eternal happiness and is the 
luminous way.

And then he thinks of the mightiness of the All-Glorious One, of Whom  
the  by  now  sleeping  plants  and  animals,  the  hidden  suns  and  sober  stars 
are all soldiers, subjugated to His command, and lamps and servants in this

Merciful One of Perfection, the All-Compassionate One of Beauty in won-
derstruck  love  and  eternity-tinged  humility  and  digniﬁed  self-effacement,

For sure you will have understood by now how agreeable and ﬁne and pleas-
ant and elevated, how high and pleasurable, how reasonable and appropriate 
a duty, service, and act of worship, and what a serious matter it is to perform 
the ‘Isha prayer.

Thus, since each of these ﬁve times points to a mighty revolution, is a 
sign indicating the tremendous dominical activity, and a token of the univer-
sal divine bounties, it is perfect wisdom that being a debt and an obligation, 
the prescribed prayers should be speciﬁed at those times.

Resurrection and

Once  two  men  were  travelling  through  a  land  as  beautiful  as  Paradise 
( by that land, we intend the world ). Looking around them, they saw that 
everyone had left open the door of his home and his shop and was not pay-

all  that  he  fancied,  stealing  it  and  usurping  it.  Following  his  inclinations, 
he committed every kind of injustice and abomination. None of the people 
of that land moved to stop him. But his friend said to him:

“ What  are  you  doing?  You  will  be  punished,  and  I  will  be  dragged 
into  misfortune along with you. All this property belongs to the state. The 
people of this land, including even the children, are all soldiers or govern-
ment servants. It is because they are at present civilians that they are not 
interfering with you. But the laws here are strict. The king has installed 
telephones everywhere and his agents are everywhere. Go quickly, and try 
to settle the matter. ”

But  the  empty-headed  man  said  in  his  obstinacy:  “ No,  it  is  not  state 
property; it belongs instead to some endowment, and has no clear or obvi-
ous owner. Everyone can make use of it as he sees ﬁt. I see no reason to 
deny myself the use of these ﬁne things. I will not believe they belong to 
anyone unless I see him with my own eyes. ” He continued to speak in this 
way,  with  much  philosophical  sophistry,  and  an  earnest  discussion  took 
place between them.

First  the  empty-headed  man  said:  “ Who  is  the  king  here?  I  can’t  see 

him, ” and then his friend replied:

“ Every village must have its headman; every needle must have its manu-
facturer and craftsman. And, as you know, every letter must be written by 
someone.  How,  then,  can  it  be  that  so  extremely  well-ordered  a  kingdom 
should have no ruler? And how can so much wealth have no owner, when 
every hour a train 1 arrives ﬁlled with precious and artful gifts, as if coming 
from  the  realm  of  the  unseen?  And  all  the  announcements  and  proclama-
tions, all the seals and stamps, found on all those goods, all the coins and 
the ﬂags waving in every corner of the kingdom – can they be without an 
owner? It seems you have studied foreign languages a little, and are unable 
to read this Islamic script. In addition, you refuse to ask those who are able 
to read it. Come now, let me read to you the king’s supreme decree. ”

The  empty-headed  man  then  retorted:  “ Well,  let  us  suppose  there  is  a 
king; what harm can he suffer from the minute use I am making of all his 
wealth? Will his treasury decrease on account of it? In any event, I can see 
nothing here resembling prison or punishment. ”

His friend replied: “ This land that you see is a manoeuvering ground. It 
is, in addition, an exhibition of his wonderful royal arts. Then again it may

be regarded as a temporary hospice, one devoid of foundations. Do you not 
see that every day one caravan arrives as another departs and vanishes? It is 
being constantly emptied and ﬁlled. Soon the whole land will be changed; its 
inhabitants will depart for another and more lasting realm. There everyone 
will be either rewarded or punished in accordance with his services. ”

That  treacherous  empty-headed  one  retorted  rebelliously:  “ I  don’t 
believe it. Is it at all possible that a whole land should perish, and be trans-
ferred to another realm? ”

His faithful friend then replied: “ Since you are so obstinate and rebel-
lious, come, let me demonstrate to you, with twelve out of the innumerable 
proofs  available,  that  there  is  a  supreme  tribunal,  a  realm  of  reward  and 
generosity and a realm of punishment and incarceration, and that just as this 
world is partially emptied every day, so too a day shall come when it will be 
totally emptied and destroyed.

First Aspect: Is it at all possible that in any kingdom, and particularly so 
splendid a kingdom as this, there should be no reward for those who serve 
obediently and no punishment for those who rebel? Reward and punishment 
are virtually non-existent here; there must therefore be a Supreme Tribunal 
somewhere else.

Second Aspect: Look at the organization and administration of this king-
dom! See how everyone, including the poorest and the weakest, is provided 
with perfect and ornate sustenance. The best care is taken of the sick. Royal 
and delicious foods, dishes, jewel encrusted decorations, embroidered gar-
ments, splendid feasts – all are to be found here. See how everyone pays due 
attention to his duties, with the exception of empty-headed people such as 
yourself. No one transgresses his bounds by as much as an inch. The great-
est of all men is engaged in modest and obedient service, with an attitude of 
fear and awe. The ruler of this kingdom must possess, then, great generosity 
and all-embracing compassion, as well as, at the same time, great dignity, 
exalted awesomeness and honour. Now generosity requires liberality; com-
passion  cannot  dispense  with  beneﬁcence;  and  awesomeness  and  honour 
make it imperative that the discourteous be chastised. But not even a thou-
sandth part of what that generosity and awesomeness require is to be seen in 
this realm. The oppressor retains his power, and the oppressed, his humilia-
tion, as they both depart and migrate from this realm. Their affairs are, then, 
left to the same supreme tribunal of which we speak.

Third  Aspect:  See  with  what  lofty  wisdom  and  ordering  affairs  are 
managed, and with what true justice and balance transactions are effected! 

TENTH WORD

67

Now a wise polity requires that those who seek refuge under the protecting 
wing of the state should receive favour, and justice demands that the rights 
of subjects be preserved, so that the splendour of the state should not suf-
fer. But here in this land, not a thousandth part of the requirements of such 
wisdom and justice is fulﬁlled; for example, empty-headed people such as 
yourself usually leave this realm unpunished. So again we say, matters are 
postponed for the consideration of a supreme tribunal.

Fourth  Aspect:  Look  at  these  innumerable  and  peerless  jewels  that 
are displayed here, these unparalleled dishes laid out like a banquet! They 
demonstrate that the ruler of these lands is possessed of inﬁnite generosity 
and  an  inexhaustible  treasury.  Now  such  generosity  and  such  a  treasury 
deserve and require a bounteous display that should be eternal and include 
all  possible  objects  of  desire.  They  further  require  that  all  who  come  as 
guests to partake of that display should be there eternally and not suffer the 
pain of death and separation. For just as the cessation of pain is pleasurable, 
so too is the cessation of pleasure painful! Look at these displays and the 
announcements concerning them! And listen to these heralds proclaiming 
the ﬁne and delicate arts of a miracle-working monarch, and demonstrat-
ing his perfections! They are declaring his peerless and invisible beauty, 
and speaking of the subtle manifestations of his hidden beauteousness; he 
must  be  possessed,  then,  of  a  great  and  astounding  invisible  beauty  and 
perfection. This ﬂawless hidden perfection requires one who will appre-
ciate and admire it, who will gaze on it exclaiming, “ M a ’s h a l l a h ! , ” thus 
displaying it and making it known.

As for concealed and peerless beauty, it too requires to see and be seen, 
or  rather  to  behold  itself  in  two  ways.  The  ﬁrst  consists  of  contemplat-
ing  itself  in  different  mirrors,  and  the  second  of  contemplating  itself  by 
means of the contemplation of enraptured spectators and astounded admir-
ers. Hidden beauty wishes, then, to see and be seen, to contemplate itself 
eternally  and  be  contemplated  without  cease.  It  desires  also  permanent 
existence for those who gaze upon it in awe and rapture. For eternal beauty 
can never be content with a transient admirer; moreover, an admirer des-
tined to perish without hope of return will ﬁnd his love turning to enmity 
whenever he imagines his death, and his admiration and respect will yield 
to  contempt.  It  is  in  man’s  nature  to  hate  the  unknown  and  the  unac-
customed.  Now  everyone  leaves  the  hospice  of  this  realm  very  quickly 
and vanishes, having seen only a light or a shadow of the perfection and 

68

THE WORDS

beauty  for  no  more  than  a  moment,  without  in  any  way  being  satiated. 
Hence, it is necessary that he should go towards an eternal realm where he 
will contemplate the divine beauty and perfection.

Fifth Aspect: See, it is evident from all these matters that that peerless 
Being  is  possessed  of  most  great  mercy.  For  he  causes  aid  to  be  swiftly 
extended to every victim of misfortune, answers every question and petition; 
and mercifully fulﬁls even the lowliest need of his lowliest subject. If, for 
example, the foot of some herdsman’s sheep should hurt, he either provides 
some medicine or sends a veterinarian.

Come  now,  let  us  go;  there  is  a  great  meeting  on  that  island.  All  the  
nobles of the land are assembled there. See, a most noble commander, bear-
ing exalted decorations, is pronouncing a discourse, and requesting certain 
things from that compassionate monarch. All those present say: “ Yes, we 
too desire the same, ” and afﬁrm and assent to his words. Now listen to the 
words of that commander favoured by his monarch:

“ O monarch that nurtures us with his bounty! Show us the source and 
origin of these examples and shadows you have shown us! Draw us nigh 
to your seat of rule; do not let us perish in these deserts! Take us into your 
presence  and  have  mercy  on  us!  Feed  us  there  on  the  delicious  bounty 
you have caused us to taste here! Do not torment us with desperation and 
banishment! Do not leave your yearning, thankful and obedient subjects to 
their own devices; do not cause them to be annihilated! ” Do you not hear 
him thus supplicating? Is it at all possible that so merciful and powerful a 
monarch should totally fulﬁl the humblest desire of his humblest soldier 
and  not  fulﬁl  the  ﬁnest  and  highest  aim  of  his  most  beloved  and  noble 
commander?

Moreover, the purpose of that commander is the purpose of all men, and 
its fulﬁlment is required by the pleasure, the compassion and the justice of 
the king, and it is a matter of ease for him, not difﬁculty, causing him less 
difﬁculty than the transient places of enjoyment contained in the hospice of 
the world. Having spent so much effort on these places of witnessing that 
will  last  only  ﬁve  or  six  days,  and  on  the  foundation  of  this  kingdom,  in 
order to demonstrate instances of his power, he will, without doubt, display 
at his seat of rule true treasures, perfections and skills in such a manner, and 
open before us such spectacles, that our intellects will be astonished.

Those sent to this ﬁeld of trial will not, then, be left to their own devices; 

palaces of bliss or dungeons await them.

TENTH WORD

69

Sixth  Aspect:  Come  now,  look!  All  these  imposing  railways,  planes, 
machines, warehouses, exhibitions show that behind the veil an imposing 
monarch exists and governs.1

Such a monarch requires subjects worthy of himself. But now you see all 
his subjects gathered in a hospice for wayfarers, a hospice that is ﬁlled and 
emptied each day. It can also be said that his subjects are now gathered in 
a testing-ground for the sake of manoeuvres, and this ground also changes 
each  hour.  Again,  we  may  say  that  all  his  subjects  stay  in  an  exhibition-
hall for a few minutes to behold specimens of the monarch’s beneﬁcence, 
valuable  products  of  his  miraculous  art.  But  the  exhibition  itself  changes 
each moment. Now this situation and circumstance conclusively shows that 
beyond the hospice, the testing-ground, the exhibition, there are permanent 
palaces, lasting abodes, and gardens and treasuries full of the pure and ele-
vated  originals  of  the  samples  and  shapes  we  see  in  this  world.  It  is  for 
the  sake  of  these  that  we  exert  ourselves  here.  Here  we  labour,  and  there 
we receive our reward. A form and degree of felicity suited to everyone’s 
capacity awaits us there.

Seventh  Aspect:  Come,  let  us  walk  a  little,  and  see  what  is  to  be 
found  among  these  civilized  people.  See,  in  every  place,  at  every  corner, 

1.  When a vast army in the present age receives the order, “ take up your weapons and 
ﬁx your bayonets, ” in accordance with the rules of war while on manœuvre, it comes to re-
semble a forest of upright oaks. Similarly, when the soldiers of a garrison are commanded 
on festive days to don their parade uniforms and pin on their medals, it will resemble from 
one end to the other a colourful and ornate garden, where all the ﬂowers have blossomed. 
Conversely, when on the parade-ground of the world, the various and inﬁnite species of the 
soldiery of the Pre-Eternal Monarch – angels, jinn, men, animals and even unfeeling plants 
– receive the order of ² ± in the struggle for life’s preservation and the command, 
“ take up your weapons and equipment, and prepare to defend yourselves, ” when they ﬁx 
the minute bayonets that are the spiked trees and plants found throughout the world – then 
they resemble a magniﬁcent army advancing with bayonets ﬁxed. 

Similarly, each day and each week of the spring is like a festival for each class of the 
vegetable kingdom, and each class presents itself to the witnessing gaze of the Pre-Eternal 
Monarch with the jewelled decorations He has given them, as if it were on parade in order 
to display the ﬁne gifts He has bestowed on them. It is as if all the plants and trees were 
heeding a dominical command, don the bejewelled garments produced by Allah’s artistry, 
put on the decorations made by His creative power – ﬂowers and fruit. The face of the 
earth then comes to represent a parade-ground on a splendid festive day, a magniﬁcent 
parade brilliant with the uniforms and jewelled decorations of the soldiers.

Such wise and well-ordered arrangement and ornament demonstrates of a certainty, to 
all who are not blind, that they derive from the command of a monarch inﬁnite in power 
and unlimited in wisdom.

THE WORDS

photographers  are  sitting  and  taking  pictures.  Look,  everywhere  there  are 
scribes sitting and writing things down. Everything is being recorded. They 
are  registering  the  least  signiﬁcant  of  deeds,  the  most  commonplace  of 
events. Now look up at the tall mountain; there you see a supreme photog-
rapher installed, devoted to the service of the king;1 he is taking pictures of 
all that  happens in the area. The king must, then, have issued this order; 
“ Record all the transactions made and deeds performed in the kingdom. ” In 
other words, that exalted personage is having all events registered and pho-
tographically recorded. The precise record he is keeping must without doubt 
be for the sake of one day calling his subjects to account.

Now  is  it  at  all  possible  that  an  all-wise  and  all-preserving  being  who 
does not neglect the most banal doings of the lowest of his subjects, should 
not  record  the  most  signiﬁcant  deeds  of  the  greatest  among  his  subjects, 
should not call them to account, should not reward and punish them? After 
all,  it  is  those  foremost  among  his  subjects  that  perform  deeds  offensive 
to his glory, contrary to his pride and unacceptable to his compassion, and 
those deeds remain unpunished in this world. It must be, therefore, that their 
judgement is postponed to a supreme court.

Eighth  Aspect:  Come,  let  me  read  to  you  the  decrees  issued  by  that 
monarch. See, he repeatedly makes the following promises and dire threats: 
“ I will take you from your present abode and bring you to the seat of my 
rule. There I shall bestow happiness on the obedient and imprison the diso-
bedient.  Destroying  that  temporary  abode,  I  shall  found  a  different  realm 
containing eternal palaces and dungeons. ” 

He can easily fulﬁl the promises that he makes, of such importance for 
his  subjects.  It  is,  moreover,  incompatible  with  his  pride  and  his  power 
that he should break his promise. So look, o confused one! You assent to 
the claims of your mendacious imagination, your distraught intellect, your 
deceptive soul, but deny the words of a being who cannot be compelled in 
any fashion to break his promise, whose high stature does not admit any 

1.  Some of the truths indicated in this parable have been set forth in the Seventh Truth. 
However, let us point out here that the ﬁgure of the “ supreme photographer devoted to 
the service of the king ” is an indication of the Preserved Tablet. The reality and existence 
of  the  Preserved  Tablet  has  been  proved  in  the  Twenty-Sixth  Word  as  follows:  a  little 
portfolio suggests the existence of a great ledger; a little document points to the existence 
of a great register; and little drops point to the existence of a great water tank. So too the 
retentive faculties of men, the fruits of trees, the seeds and kernels of fruit, being each like 
a little portfolio, a Preserved Tablet in miniature or a drop proceeding from the pen that 
inscribes the great Preserved Tablet – they point to, indicate and prove the existence of 
a Supreme Retentive Faculty, a great register, an exalted Preserved Tablet. Indeed, they 
demonstrate this visibly to the perceptive intellect.

such  faithlessness,  and  to  whose  truthfulness  all  visible  deeds  bear  wit-
ness. Certainly you deserve a great punishment. You resemble a traveller 
who closes his eyes to the light of the sun and looks instead upon his own 
imagination. His fancy wishes to illuminate his awesomely dark path with 
the light of his brain, although it is no more than a glow-worm. Once that 
monarch makes a promise, he will by all means fulﬁl it. Its fulﬁlment is 
most easy for him, and moreover most necessary for us and all things, as 
well as for him too and his kingdom.

There is therefore, a supreme court, and a lofty felicity.
Ninth Aspect: Come now! Look at the heads of these ofﬁces and groups.1 
Each has a private telephone to speak personally with the king. Sometimes 
too  they  go  directly  to  his  presence.  See  what  they  say  and  unanimously 
report,  that  the  monarch  has  prepared  a  most  magniﬁcent  and  awesome 
place for reward and punishment. His promises are emphatic and his threats 
are most stern. His pride and dignity are such that he would in no way stoop 
to the abjectness inherent in the breaking of a promise. The bearers of this 
report,  who  are  so  numerous  as  to  be  universally  accepted,  further  report 
with the strong unanimity of consensus that “ the seat and headquarters of 
the  lofty  monarchy,  some  of  whose  traces  are  visible  here,  is  in  another 
realm far distant from here. The buildings existing in this testing-ground are 
but temporary, and will later be exchanged for eternal palaces. These places 
will change. For this magniﬁcent and unfading monarchy, the splendour of 
which  is  apparent  from  its  works,  can  in  no  way  be  founded  or  based  on 
so transient, impermanent, unstable, insigniﬁcant, changing, defective and 
imperfect matters. It is based rather on matters worthy of it, eternal, stable, 
permanent and glorious. ”

There is, then, another realm, and of a certainty we shall go toward it.
Tenth Aspect: Come, today is the vernal equinox.2 Certain changes will 
take place, and wondrous things will occur. On this ﬁne spring day, let us 

1.  The meanings indicated in this Aspect can be found in the Eighth Truth. For ex-
ample, by heads of ofﬁces we mean the prophets and the saints. As for the telephone, it is 
a link and relation with Allah that goes forth from the heart and is the mirror of revelation 
and the receptacle of inspiration. The heart is like the earpiece of that telephone.

2.  You will ﬁnd what this Aspect alludes to in the Ninth Truth. The vernal equinox is 
equivalent to the beginning of spring. As for the green plain covered with ﬂowers, this is 
the face of the earth in springtime. The changing scenes and spectacles are an allusion to 
the different groups of vernal beings, the classes of summer creation, and the sustenance 
for men and animals, that the All-Powerful and Glorious Maker, the All-Wise and Beaute-
ous Creator, from the beginning of spring to the end of summer, brings forth in orderly 
succession, renews with the utmost compassion, and despatches uninterruptedly.

72

THE WORDS

go for a walk on the green plain adorned with beautiful ﬂowers. See, other 
people are also coming toward it. There must be some magic at work, for 
buildings  that  were  mere  ruins  have  suddenly  sprung  up  again  here,  and 
this once empty plain has become like a populous city. See, every hour it 
shows a different scene, just like a cinema screen, and takes on a different 
shape. But notice, too, that among these complex, swiftly changing and mul-
tifarious scenes perfect order exists, so that all things are put in their proper 
places. The imaginary scenes presented to us on the cinema screen cannot 
be as well-ordered as this, and millions of skilled magicians would be inca-
pable of this artistry. This monarch whom we cannot see must, then, have 
performed even greater miracles.

O foolish one! You ask: “ How can this vast kingdom be destroyed and 

re-established somewhere else? ”

You see that every hour numerous changes and revolutions occur, just 
like that transfer from one realm to another that your mind will not accept.  
From this gathering in and scattering forth it can be deduced that a certain 
purpose  is  concealed  within  these  visible  and  swift  joinings  and  separa-
tions, these compoundings and dissolvings. Ten years of effort would not 
be devoted to a joining together destined to last no longer than an hour. So 
these  circumstances  we  witness  cannot  be  ends  in  themselves;  they  are  a 
kind  of  parable  of  something  beyond  themselves,  an  imitation  of  it.  That 
exalted  being  brings  them  about  in  miraculous  fashion,  so  that  they  take 
shape and then merge, and the result is preserved and recorded, in just the 
same way that every aspect of a manoeuvre on the battleground is written 
down and recorded. This implies that proceedings at some great concourse 
and meeting will be based on what happens here. Further, the results of all 
that occurs here will be permanently displayed at some supreme exposition. 
All the transient and ﬂuctuating phenomena we see here will yield the fruit 
of eternal and immutable form.

All  the  variations  we  observe  in  this  world  are  then,  for  the  sake  of  a 
supreme  happiness,  a  lofty  tribunal,  for  the  sake  of  exalted  aims  as  yet 
unknown to us.

Eleventh Aspect: Come, o obstinate friend! Let us embark on a plane 
or a train travelling east or west, that is, to the past or the future. Let us see 
what miraculous works that being has accomplished in other places. Look, 
there are marvels on every hand like the dwellings, open spaces and exhibi-
tions we see. But they all differ with respect to art and to form. Note well, 

TENTH WORD

73

however, what order betokening manifest wisdom, what indications of evi-
dent compassion, what signs of lofty justice, and what fruits of comprehen-
sive mercy, are to be seen in these transient dwellings, these impermanent 
open spaces, these ﬂeeting exhibitions. Anyone not totally devoid of insight 
will understand a certainty that no wisdom can be imagined more perfect 
than his, no providence more beauteous than his, no compassion more com-
prehensive than his, and no justice more glorious than his.

If,  for  the  sake  of  argument,  as  you  imagine,  no  permanent  abodes, 
lofty  places,  ﬁxed  stations,  lasting  residences,  or  resident  and  contented 
population existed in the sphere of his kingdom; and if the truths of his 
wisdom, compassion, mercy and justice had no realm in which to manifest 
themselves fully ( for this impermanent kingdom is no place for their full 
manifestation ) – then we would be obliged to deny the wisdom we see, to 
deny the compassion we observe, to deny the mercy that is in front of our 
eyes, and to deny the justice the signs of which are evident. This would be 
as idiotic as denying the sun, the light of which we clearly see at midday. 
We would also have to regard the one from whom proceed all these wise 
measures we see, all these generous acts, all these merciful gifts, as a vile  
gambler or treacherous tyrant ( Allah forbid! ). This would be to turn truth 
on its head. And turning a truth into its opposite is impossible, according 
to the unanimous testimony of all rational beings, excepting only the idiot 
Sophists who deny everything.

There is, then, a realm apart from the present one. In it, there is a supreme 
tribunal, a lofty place of justice, an exalted place of reward, where all this 
compassion, wisdom, mercy and justice will be made fully manifest.

Twelfth Aspect: Come, let us return now. We will speak with the chiefs 
and  ofﬁcers  of  these  various  groups,  and  looking  at  their  equipment  will 
inquire  whether  that  equipment  has  been  given  them  only  for  the  sake  of 
subsisting for a brief period in that realm, or whether it has been given for 
the sake of obtaining a long life of bliss in another realm. Let us see. We 
cannot look at everyone and his equipment. But by way of example, let us 
look at the identity card and register of this ofﬁcer. On his card, his rank, 
salary, duty, supplies and instructions are recorded. See, this rank has not 
been  awarded  him  for  just  a  few  days;  it  may  be  given  for  a  prolonged 
period. It says on his card: “ You will receive so much salary on such-and-
such a day from the treasury. ” But the date in question will not arrive for 
a long time to come, after this realm has been vacated. Similarly, the duty 

74

THE WORDS

mentioned on his card has not been given for this temporary realm, but rather 
for  the  sake  of  earning  a  permanent  felicity  in  the  proximity  of  the  king. 
Then, too, the supplies awarded him cannot be merely for the sake of sub-
sisting in this hospice of a few days’ duration; they can only be for the sake 
of a long and happy life. The instructions make it quite clear that he is des-
tined for a different place, that he is working for another realm.

Now look at these registers. They contain instructions for the use and dis-
position of weapons and equipment. If there were no realm other than this, 
one exalted and eternal, that register with its categorical instructions and that 
identity card with its clear information, would both be quite meaningless. 
Further, that respected ofﬁcer, that noble commander, that honoured chief, 
would fall to a degree lower than that of all men; he would be more wretched, 
luckless, abased, afﬂicted, indigent and weak than everyone. Apply the same 
principle to everything. Whatever you look upon bears witness that after this 
transient world another and eternal world exists.

O friend! This temporary world is like a ﬁeld. It is a place of instruction, 
a market. Without doubt a supreme tribunal and ultimate happiness will suc-
ceed it. If you deny this, you will be obliged also to deny the identity cards 
of all the ofﬁcers, their equipment and their orders; in fact, you  will have to 
deny too all the order existing in the country, the existence of a government 
in it and all the measures that the government takes. Then you will no longer 
deserve the name of man or the appellation of conscious. You will be more 
of a fool than the Sophists.

Beware, do not imagine that the proofs of the transfer of creation from 
one realm to another are restricted to these twelve. There are indications 
and proofs beyond counting and enumeration, all showing that this imper-
manent,  changing  kingdom  will  be  transformed  into  a  permanent  and 
immutable  realm.  There  are  also  innumerable  signs  and  evidences  that 
men will be taken from this temporary hospice and sent to the eternal seat 
of rule of all creation.

I  will  show  one  proof  in  particular  that  is  stronger  than  all  the  twelve 

aspects taken together.

Come now, look, in the midst of the great assembly visible in the distance 
the same noble commander whom we previously saw on the island, adorned 
with numerous decorations, is making an announcement. Let us go and lis-
ten. See, that luminous and most noble commander is conveying a supreme 
edict, beautifully inscribed. He says:

TENTH WORD

75

“ Prepare yourselves; you will go to another and permanent realm, a realm 
such that this one will appear as a dungeon by comparison. You will go to 
the seat of rule of our king, and there receive his compassion and his bounty, 
if you heed this edict well and obey it. But if you rebel and disobey it, you 
will be cast into awesome dungeons. ” Such is the message that he conveys. 
If you look at the decree, you will see that it bears such a miraculous seal 
that it cannot in any way be imitated. Everyone apart from idiots such as 
yourself knows of a certainty that the decree is from the king. Moreover, the 
noble commander bears such bright decorations that everyone except those 
blind like yourself understands full well that he is the veracious conveyer of 
the king’s orders.

Is it at all possible that the teaching of transfer from one realm to another, 
challengingly conveyed by that noble commander in the supreme edict he 
has received, should at all be open to objection? No, it is not possible, unless 
we deny all that we have seen.

Now, o friend, it is your turn to speak. Say what you have to say.
“ What should I say? What can be said to contradict all of this? Who can 
speak against the sun at midday? I say only: Praise be to Allah. A hundred 
thousand thanks that I have been saved from the dominance of fancy and 
vain imagination, and delivered from an eternal dungeon and prison. I have 
come  to  believe  that  there  is  an  abode  of  felicity  in  the  proximity  of  the 
monarch, separate from this confused and impermanent hospice, for which 
we too are destined. ”

Our comparison indicating the truth of resurrection and the hereafter is 
now complete. Now with Allah’s grace, we will pass on to the most exalted 
truth.  We  shall  set  forth  twelve  interrelated  truths,  corresponding  to  the 
twelve aspects discussed above, as well as an Introduction.

First Indication

Introduction

[ By  means  of  a  few  indications,  we  refer  here  to  several  matters 
explained  elsewhere,  that  is,  in  the  Twenty-Second,  Nineteenth  and 
Twenty-Sixth Words. ]

FIRST INDICATION

respond to three other pairs:

The foolish man in the previous story and his trustworthy companion cor-

• The instinctual soul and the heart;
• The students of philosophy and the pupils of the All-Wise Qur’an;
• The people of unbelief and the community of Islam.
The worst error and misguidance of the students of philosophy, the peo-
ple of unbelief and the instinctual soul, lies in not recognizing Allah. Just 
as in the preceding story the trustworthy man said, “ there can be no letter 
without a scribe, no law without a legislator, ” we too say the following:

A  book,  particularly  one  in  each  word  of  which  a  minute  pen  has 
inscribed  another  whole  book,  and  in  each  letter  of  which  a  ﬁne  pen  has 
traced a poem, cannot be without a writer; this would be entirely impossible. 
So too this cosmos cannot be without its inscriber; this is impossible to the 
utmost degree. For the cosmos is precisely such a book that each of its pages 
includes many other books, each of its words contains a book, and each of 
its letters contains a poem. The face of the earth is but a single page in the 
book of the cosmos. See how many books it contains. Every fruit is a let-
ter, and every seed is a dot. In that dot is contained the index of the whole 
tree in its vastness. A book such as this can have been inscribed only by the 
mighty pen of a Possessor of Glory Who enjoys the attributes of splendour 
and beauty, and Who is the holder of inﬁnite wisdom and power. Faith, then, 
follows inevitably on the observation of the world, unless one is drunk on 
misguidance.

Similarly,  a  house  cannot  arise  without  a  builder,  particularly  a  house 
adorned with miraculous works of art, wondrous designs, and amazing orna-
ments. As much art has been put into one of its stones as into a whole  pal-
ace. No intelligence will accept that it could arise without a builder; deﬁ-
nitely it needs a master architect. Moreover, within the building, veritable 
rooms  take  shape  and  change  each  hour  with  the  utmost  order  and  ease, 
just as if clothes were being changed, or as if scenes were passing across a 

THE TENTH WORD – INTRODUCTION

77

cinema screen. We can say even that numerous little rooms are constantly 
being created in each of those scenes.

In like manner, the cosmos also requires an inﬁnitely wise, all-knowing 
and all-powerful maker. For the magniﬁcent cosmos is a palace that has 
the sun and the moon as its lamps and the stars as its candles; time is like a 
rope or ribbon hung within it, on to which the Glorious Creator each year 
threads  a  new  world.  And  within  the  world  that  He  thus  threads  on  the 
string of time He places three hundred and sixty fresh and orderly forms. 
He changes them with the utmost orderliness and wisdom. He has made 
the face of the earth a bounteous spread that He adorns each spring with 
three hundred thousand species of creation, that He ﬁlls with innumerable 
kinds of generous gifts. This He does in such a fashion that they all stand 
apart from each other, quite separate and distinct, despite their being at the 
same time so close and intermingled. Is it possible to overlook the exist-
ence of the Maker of such a palace?

Again, to deny the existence of the sun, on a cloudless day at noon, when 
its traces are to be observed and its reﬂection is to be seen in every bub-
ble on the surface of the ocean, in every shining object on dry land, and in 
every particle of snow – to make such a denial would be to rave like the 
deranged. For if one denied and refused to accept the existence of the sin-
gle, unique sun, he would be compelled to accept the existence of a whole 
series of minor suns, each real and existent in its own right, as numerous as 
the drops and bubbles of the ocean, as countless as the particles of snow. It 
would be necessary to believe that each minute particle contains a huge sun, 
even though the particle is large enough only to contain itself. It would be 
an even greater sign of lunacy and misguidance to refuse one’s assent to the 
attributes of perfection of the Glorious Creator, even while beholding the 
well-ordered cosmos that is constantly changing in wise and regular fashion, 
that is being ceaselessly renewed in disciplined manner. This, too, would be 
like the ravings of a lunatic, since it would then become necessary to believe 
and accept that absolute divinity is present in all things, even a particle. For 
every particle of air is somehow able to enter and work its effects upon every 
ﬂower, fruit and leaf, and unless the particle be entrusted with this task by 
a  Creator,  it  must  know  of  itself  the  structure  and  form  of  all  the  objects 
it penetrates and affects. In other words, it must possess all-encompassing 
power and knowledge.

Every particle of soil is potentially capable of giving rise to all the differ-
ent seeds that exist. If it is not acting under command, it must contain within 

78

THE WORDS

itself equipment and instruments corresponding to all the various trees and 
plants in the world. Or, to put it differently, one must attribute to the parti-
cle such artistry and power that it is aware of the structure of each of them, 
knows the forms that each of them is caused to assume, and is capable of 
fashioning  those  forms.  The  same  is  true  with  respect  to  the  particle  and 
other realms of creation.

From this you can understand that in all things there are numerous and 
manifest proofs of Allah’s unity. To create all things from one thing, and to 
make all things into one thing, is a task possible only for the Creator of all 
things. Pay heed to the sublime declaration: ( 17:44 ) o n m l k j  
For if one does not accept Allah, the One and Unique, one must accept gods 
as numerous as created beings.

SECOND INDICATION

In our story, we made mention of a Most Noble Commander and said 
that whoever is not blind and sees his decorations and medals will under-
stand that he acts in accordance with the commands of a monarch and is 
his favoured servant. Now that Most Noble Commander is the Most Noble 
Messenger of Allah, upon whom be blessings and peace. The sacred Crea-
tor of so ornamented a cosmos must of necessity have a Noble Messenger, 
just as the sun must of necessity have light. For the sun cannot exist with-
out giving light, and Divinity cannot be without showing itself through the 
sending of prophets. Is it at all possible that a beauty of utter perfection 
should not desire to manifest itself by means of one who will demonstrate 
and display it?

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  a  perfection  of  beauteous  artistry  should  not 
desire  to  make  itself  known  by  means  of  a  herald  that  will  draw  men’s 
gazes upon it?

Is it at all possible that the universal monarchy of all-embracing domini-
cality  should  not  desire  to  announce  its  unity  and  eternal  besoughtedness 
throughout  the  different  levels  of  multiplicity  and  particularity  by  means 
of an envoy possessing two aspects? By the two aspects, we mean that he 
is both the envoy of the realm of multiplicity to the divine court, by virtue 
of his universal worship, and also the messenger of the divine court to the 
realm of multiplicity, by virtue of his closeness to Allah and being entrusted 
with His message.

Is it at all possible that a possessor of inﬁnite inherent beauty should not 
wish both to behold himself and to display to others, in numerous  mirrors, 

THE TENTH WORD – INTRODUCTION

79

the charms of his beauty and the allurements of his fairness? Allah’s Mes-
senger ( UWBP ) is His beloved, making himself beloved of Him by means 
of his worship and holding up a mirror to Him, and he is also the bearer of 
His message, making Him beloved of men and demonstrating to them the 
beauty of His names.

Is it at all possible that the owner of treasuries full of wondrous miracles, 
rare and valuable items, should not wish and desire to display them to men’s 
gaze by means of an expert jeweller, and eloquent describer, thereby reveal-
ing his hidden perfections?

Is it at all possible that the One Who manifests the perfection of all His 
names in the cosmos by means of artful adornment for men to look upon, 
so that the cosmos comes to resemble a palace decorated with all kinds of 
wondrous and subtle art, should not also designate a teacher and a guide to 
the wonders of his creation?

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  the  Lord  of  the  cosmos  should  not  solve,  by 
means of a messenger, the complex talisman of the aim and purpose of all 
the changes that take place in the cosmos, and the riddle contained in the 
three difﬁcult questions posed by all beings: “ What is our origin? What is 
our destination? What is our purpose? ”

Is it at all possible that the Glorious Maker Who makes Himself known 
to sentient beings by means of His fair creation, and Who makes himself 
loved by means of His precious bounties, should not also communicate to 
sentient beings, by means of a messenger, what His pleasure desires of them 
in exchange?

Is it at all possible that Allah should create mankind in a form predispos-
ing it to suffer the consciousness of multiplicity but also containing the abil-
ity to engage in universal worship, without at the same time wishing to turn 
it away from multiplicity to unity, by means of a teacher and guide?

There are numerous other functions of prophethood, each of which is a 

decisive proof that Divinity necessarily implies messengership.

Did anyone ever appear in the world more worthy and more in possession 
of  the  abovementioned  qualities  and  functions  than  Muhammad,  the  Ara-
bian Prophet, may peace and blessings be upon him? Has time ever shown 
us one more ﬁtting and suited to the rank of messengerhood and the task of 
conveying Allah’s message? No, by no means! He is the master of all mes-
sengers, the foremost of all prophets, the leader of all pure ones, the closest 
to Allah of all those who have drawn nigh unto Him, the most perfect of all 
creatures, the monarch of all guides to righteousness.

80

THE WORDS

Quite apart from the countless indications of his prophethood deriving 
from more than a thousand miracles, such as the splitting of the moon and  
the  ﬂowing  of  water  from  his  ﬁngers,  that  all  scholars  unanimously  con-
ﬁrm, the supreme miracle of the Glorious Qur’an – an ocean of truth and a 
book miraculous in forty different respects – is itself enough to demonstrate 
his prophethood as clearly as the sun. Since we discuss the forty different 
aspects  of  the  Qur’an’s  miraculousness  in  other  treatises,  particularly  the 
Twenty-Fifth Word, we curtail our discussion of the matter here.

Third Indication

THIRD INDICATION

Let it not be thought that petty man is too insigniﬁcant for this vast world 
to be brought to an end and another realm to be unfolded simply for the sake 
of his being brought to account. For apparently petty man bears great impor-
tance as the master of all creatures, by virtue of the comprehensiveness of 
his  disposition,  as  the  herald  of  Allah’s  monarchy,  and  the  manifester  of 
universal worship. Also let nobody ask: “ How can one earn eternal torment 
in the course of a very brief life? ” For unbelief seeks to drag creation, some-
thing as valuable and exalted as a letter written by Allah, down to the depths 
of meaninglessness and purposelessness. It is an insult to all being, since it 
denies and rejects the manifestations and impresses of Allah’s sacred names 
that are visible in all being, and it seeks to negate all the inﬁnite proofs that 
demonstrate the veracity and truthfulness of Allah Almighty. Hence, unbe-
lief is a crime of inﬁnite proportions, deserving of inﬁnite punishment.

Fourth Indication

FOURTH INDICATION

In the story, we saw by means of twelve aspects that a king who had 
one realm resembling a transient hospice must of a necessity have another 
realm, one eternal and permanent, manifesting his splendour and the sub-
limity of his power. In the same way, it is not at all possible that the Eternal 
Creator of the transient world should not create also an eternal realm. It is 
not possible that the Everlasting Maker of this ﬁne but unstable cosmos, 
should not create another cosmos, permanent and lasting. It is not possible 
that the Wise, Powerful and Merciful Creator of this world, which is like 
an exhibition, or a testing-ground, or a ﬁeld, should not create also a here-
after in which the purposes of this world shall be made manifest. Entry is 
to be had to this truth by means of twelve gates, and the twelve gates are 
to be unlocked by means of twelve other truths. We will begin with the 
shortest and simplest of them:

TENTH WORD – SECOND TRUTH

81

FIRST TRUTH
The Gate of Dominicality and Sovereignty,
the Manifestation of the Name of Sustainer

Is it at all possible that the glory of Allah’s dominicality and His divine 
sovereignty should create a cosmos such as this, in order to display His per-
fections, with such lofty aims and elevated purposes, without establishing a 
reward for those believers who through faith and worship respond to these 
aims and purposes? Or that He should not punish those misguided ones who 
treat His purposes with rejection and scorn?

SECOND TRUTH
The Gate of Generosity and Mercy,
the Manifestation of the Names of Generous and Merciful

Is it at all possible that the Lord of this world, Who in His works dem-
onstrates inﬁnite generosity, inﬁnite mercy, inﬁnite splendour and inﬁnite 
glory,  should  not  give  reward  in  a  manner  beﬁtting  His  generosity  and 
mercy,  and  not  punish  in  a  manner  beﬁtting  His  splendour  and  glory?  If 
one looks at the disposition of affairs in this world, one sees that all animate 
beings  –  from  the  weakest  to  the  most  powerful  –  are  given  some  ﬁtting 
form of sustenance.1 Indeed, the weakest and most powerless are given the 
best form of sustenance. This largesse and bounty is distributed with such 
lofty generosity that a hand of inﬁnite generosity is manifestly at work.

For example, in the spring, all the trees are garbed in clothes as ﬁne as 
silk,  just  like  the  houris  in  Paradise;  they  are  encrusted  with  ﬂowers  and 
fruits,  as  if  with  jewels,  and  caused  to  offer  us  numerous  varieties  of  the 
choicest fruits, on branches delicately outstretched like the hands of a serv-
ant. Similarly, we are given wholesome and sweet honey to eat, from the 
hand  of  the  bee  with  its  sting;  we  are  clothed  in  the  ﬁnest  and  softest  of 
clothes by means of an insect that has no hands; and within a small seed a 
great treasure of mercy is preserved for us. It is self-evident that all of this  
is the effect of a most beauteous generosity, a most delicate sense of mercy.

1.  All licit nourishment is obtained not through the exercise of strength, but through 
the existence of need. The decisive proof of this is that powerless infants enjoy the ﬁnest 
of livelihoods, while strong wild beasts suffer from all kinds of deﬁciency, and that ﬁsh, 
for all their lack of intelligence, wax fat, while the cunning fox and monkey remain thin in 
their quest for livelihood. There is, therefore, an inverse relationship between sustenance 
on the one hand and strength and will power on the other. The more one relies on strength 
and will power the more difﬁcult it will be to sustain one’s livelihood.

82

THE WORDS

Then, too, the fact that, with the exception of man and certain wild ani-
mals, all things, from the sun, the moon and earth to the smallest of crea-
tures,  perform  their  functions  with  the  utmost  exactitude,  do  not  overstep 
their  bounds  by  an  inch,  and  observe  a  universal  obedience  in  a  spirit  of 
great awe – this shows that they act by the command of a Possessor of great 
glory and dignity. It is also apparent that the fashion in which all mothers, in 
the vegetable, animal and human realms, succour their weak and powerless 
infants with the delicate nurture of milk, in tender compassion, is a manifes-
tation of Allah’s all-embracing mercy.1

Since the master of this world has, then, such inﬁnite generosity, mercy, 
splendour and glory, it follows that His inﬁnite glory and splendour require 
the  chastisement  of  the  discourteous;  that  His  inﬁnite  generosity  requires 
inﬁnite bounty, and His inﬁnite mercy requires a bestowal of favour worthy 
of itself. Now in this transitory world and brief life, only a millionth part of 
all this, like one drop from the ocean, establishes and manifests itself. There 
must therefore be a realm of blessedness appropriate to that generosity and 
worthy of that mercy. One would otherwise have to deny the existence of the 
mercy that is visible to us, and this would be like denying the existence of 
the sun that ﬁlls every day with its light. For irrevocable death would trans-
form compassion into disaster, love into afﬂiction, blessing into vengeance, 
intellect into a tool of misery, and pleasure into pain, so that the very essence 
of Allah’s mercy would vanish.

There must in addition be a realm of punishment appropriate to Allah’s 
glory and dignity. For generally the oppressor leaves this world while still 
in possession of his might, and the oppressed while still subjected to humili-
ation.  These  matters  are  therefore  deferred  for  the  attention  of  a  supreme 
tribunal; it is not that they are neglected. It sometimes happens too that pun-
ishment is enacted in this world. The torments suffered by disobedient and 
rebellious peoples in previous centuries show that man is not left to his own 
devices, and that he is always subject to the blows that Allah’s splendour and 
majesty may choose to inﬂict on him.

1.  The fact that a hungry lion will prefer its offspring to itself, and give to it a piece 
of meat it would otherwise have eaten; that the cowardly rabbit will attack a lion in order 
to protect its young; that the ﬁgtree contents itself with mud while giving pure milk to its 
offspring, the fruit – this shows to anyone not blind that they act in accordance with the 
commands  of  a  Being  inﬁnitely  merciful,  generous  and  solicitous. Again,  the  fact  that 
even unconscious plants and beasts function in the wisest and most conscious of fashions 
demonstrates irrefutably that One Utterly Knowing and All-Wise has set them to work, 
and that they are acting in His name.

TENTH WORD – THIRD TRUTH

83

Is it at all possible that man should have the most important duty in all 
of creation and be endowed with the most important capacities; that man’s 
Sustainer  should  make  Himself  known  to  him  with  all  His  well-ordered 
works,  and  man  should  then  fail  to  recognize  Him  in  return  by  way  of 
worship – or that Allah should make Himself beloved of men through the 
numerous adorned fruits of His mercy, and man should then fail to make 
himself  beloved  of  Allah  through  worship  –  or  that  Allah  should  dem-
onstrate His love and mercy to man through His variegated bounties and 
man should then fail to respect Him with thanks and with praise – is it at 
all possible that man should remain unpunished, left to his own devices, 
or that that powerful Possessor of Splendour and Glory should not make 
ready for him a realm of requital?

Is it at all possible, on the other hand, that He should not prepare a realm 
of reward and eternal bliss for those believers who respond to the Merciful 
and Compassionate One’s making Himself known by recognizing Him in 
faith; to His making Himself beloved by loving Him in worship; and to His 
mercy by offering thanks and veneration?

THIRD TRUTH
The Gate of Wisdom and Justice,
the Manifestation of the Names of Wise and Just

Is it at all possible1 that the Lord of Glory, Who demonstrates His domin-
ical sovereignty in the wisdom and order, the justice and equilibrium that 
pervade all things, from the atom to the sun, should not bestow favour on 
those believers who seek refuge beneath the protective wing of His domini-
cality, who believe in His wisdom and justice, and whose acts are for the 
purpose of worshipping Him?

Again, is it possible that He should not chastise those rude and discourte-
ous men who disbelieve in His wisdom and justice, and rebel against  Him 

1.  The sentence “ is it at all possible? ” is indeed repeated many times, because it ex-
presses a most signiﬁcant mystery. Misguidance and lack of belief generally spring from 
the habit of imagining things to be impossible, far removed from the realm of reason, and 
therefore denying them. Now in this discussion of resurrection it has been decisively dem-
onstrated that true impossibility, absurdity and irrationality pertain to the path of misbelief 
and the road of misguidance, whereas true possibility, facility and rationality are charac-
teristics of the path of faith and highway of Islam. 

In short, the philosophers tend to unbelief on account of their regarding things as im-
possible, whereas the Tenth Word ( discussion of resurrection ), by means of the repeated 
sentence, “ is it at all possible? ” shows where impossibility lies, and thus deals them a 
blow in the mouth.

84

THE WORDS

in insolence? Now not even a thousandth part of that wisdom and justice is 
exercised with respect to man, in this transient world; it is rather deferred. 
Most of the people of misguidance leave this world unpunished, and most of 
the people of guidance leave it unrewarded. All things are, then, postponed 
for a supreme tribunal, an ultimate bliss.

Yes,  it  is  apparent  that  the  Being  Who  controls  this  world  does  so  in 
accordance with an inﬁnite wisdom. Do you require a proof? It is the pres-
ervation of interest and beneﬁt in all things. Do you not see that numerous 
wise beneﬁts are intended in all the limbs, bones and veins of man, even in 
the cells of his brain and in every particle of his body? Do you not see that 
from certain limbs wise beneﬁts are to be had as numerous as the fruits of 
a tree? All of this shows that matters are done in accordance with inﬁnite 
wisdom. The existence of the utmost regularity in the making of all things is 
a proof of the same truth.

The  compression  of  the  exact  programme  of  development  of  a  beauti-
ful ﬂower into a minute seed, the inscription on a small seed by the pen of 
destiny of the scroll of deeds of a tree, its life history and list of equipment, 
show that a pen of utmost wisdom is at work.

The existence of a high degree of ﬁne artistry in all things proves that 
there exists also the impress of an inﬁnitely Wise Maker. Further, the inclu-
sion within the minute body of man of an index of all being, of the keys to 
all the treasuries of mercy, and of the mirrors of all the divine names, dem-
onstrates the existence of wisdom within that inﬁnitely ﬁne artistry. Now is 
it at all possible that the wisdom that thus permeates the workings of domini-
cality should not wish eternally to favour those who seek refuge beneath the 
wing of dominicality and who offer obedience in faith?

Do you wish for a proof that all things are done with justice and balance? 
The fact that all things are endowed with being, given shape and put in their 
appropriate place in accordance with precise equilibrium and in appropriate 
measure, shows that all matters are done in accordance with inﬁnite justice 
and balance.

Similarly, the fact that all things are given their rights in accordance with 
their disposition, that they receive all the necessities of their being and all 
the requirements of life in the most ﬁtting form – this too is the sign left by 
a hand of inﬁnite justice.

Again, the fact that answer is always given to every petition and request 
made by the tongue of disposition, and of natural need or necessity, demon-
strates the existence of inﬁnite justice and wisdom.

TENTH WORD – FOURTH TRUTH

85

Now is it at all possible that the justice and wisdom that hasten to relieve 
the pettiest need of the smallest of creation should fail to provide  immortal-
ity, the greatest need of man, the greatest of creatures? That it should fail 
to respond to his greatest plea and cry for assistance? Or that it should not 
preserve the dignity of Allah’s dominicality by preserving the rights of His 
servants? Man, whose life is so brief, cannot experience the true essence of 
justice in this transient world; it is for this reason that matters are postponed 
for  a  supreme  tribunal.  For  true  justice  requires  that  man,  this  apparently 
petty creature, should be rewarded and punished, not in accordance with his 
pettiness, but in accordance with the magnitude of his crime, the importance 
of his nature and the greatness of his function. Since this passing and tran-
sient world is far from manifesting such wisdom and justice for man, who is 
created for eternity, of necessity there will be an eternal Hell and everlast-
ing Paradise of that Just and Awesome Possessor of Beauty, that Wise and 
Beauteous Possessor of Awe.

FOURTH TRUTH
The Gate of Generosity and Beauty,
the Manifestation of the Names of Generous and Beautiful

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  inﬁnite  generosity  and  liberality,  inexhaustible 
riches, unending treasures, peerless and eternal beauty, ﬂawless and ever-
lasting perfection, should not require the existence of grateful supplicants, 
yearning spectators and astounded onlookers, all destined to stay an eternity 
in an abode of bliss, a place of repose? Yes, adorning the face of the world 
with all these objects of beauty, creating the moon and the sun as its lamps, 
ﬁlling the surface of the earth with the ﬁnest varieties of sustenance and thus 
making it a banquet of bounty, making fruit trees into so many dishes, and 
renewing them several times each season – all this shows the existence of 
inﬁnite generosity and liberality. Such unending liberality and generosity, 
such inexhaustible treasures of mercy, require the existence of an abode of 
repose, a place of bliss, that shall be everlasting and contain all desirable 
objects within it. They also require that those who enjoy such bliss should 
remain in that abode of repose eternally, without suffering the pain of cessa-
tion and separation. For just as the cessation of pain is a form of pleasure, so 
too the cessation of pleasure is a form of pain, one that such inﬁnite gener-
osity is unwilling to countenance. It requires, then, the existence both of an 
eternal paradise and of supplicants to abide in it eternally.

86

THE WORDS

Inﬁnite generosity and liberality desire to bestow inﬁnite bounty and inﬁ-
nite kindness. The bestowal of inﬁnite bounty and inﬁnite kindness require 
in turn inﬁnite gratitude. This necessitates the perpetual existence of those 
who receive all the kindness so that they can demonstrate their  thanks and 
gratitude  for  that  perpetual  bestowal  and  constant  bounty.  A  petty  enjoy-
ment, made bitter by cessation, and lasting for only a brief time, is not com-
patible with the requirements of generosity and liberality.

Look too at the different regions of the world, each like an exhibition 
where Allah’s crafts are displayed. Pay attention to the dominical procla-
mations in the hands of all the plants and animals on the face of the earth1 
and  listen  to  the  prophets  and  the  saints,  the  heralds  of  the  beauties  of 
dominicality.  They  unanimously  display  the  ﬂawless  perfections  of  the 
Glorious Maker by demonstrating His miraculous arts, and thus invite the 
gazes of men.

The  Maker  of  this  world  has,  then,  most  important,  astounding  and 
secret perfections. It is these He wishes to display by means of His miracu-
lous arts. For secret, ﬂawless perfection wishes to be manifested to those 
who will appreciate, admire and wonderingly gaze at it. Eternal perfection 
requires eternal manifestation. Such eternal manifestation in turn requires 
the perpetual existence of those who are to appreciate and admire it. The 
value  of  perfection  will  always  sink  in  the  view  of  its  admirer  if  he  is 
devoid of perpetual existence.2 Again, the beauteous, artistic, brilliant and 
adorned creatures that cover the face of the globe, bear witness to the fair-
ness of a peerless, transcendent beauty, and indicate the subtle charms of 
an unparalleled, hidden pulchritude, just as sunlight bears witness to the 
sun.3 Each manifestation of that sacred, transcendent beauty, indicates the 

1.  The existence of a brightly designed and brilliantly adorned ﬂower, a most artfully 
conceived and bejewelled fruit on a twig as thin as a wire, afﬁxed to a dry, bonelike tree 
– this is without doubt a proclamation to all animate beings of the ﬁne arts produced by a 
most skilled, wise and miraculous maker. This holds true not only of the vegetable king-
dom, but also of the animal realm.

2.  There is a proverbial occurrence pertaining to this point. A celebrated beauty once 
expelled from her presence a common man who had become infatuated with her. In order 
to console himself, he said, “ how ugly she is! ”, thus denying her beauty. 

Once a bear stood beneath a vine trellis, and wished to eat the grapes. But he was un-
able to reach out for the grapes, or to climb up the trellis. So he said to himself, by way of 
consolation, “ the grapes must be sour, ” and growling went on his way.

3.   Although  all  beings  that  act  as  mirrors  for Allah’s  beauty  constantly  vanish  and 
disappear, those that succeed them display and manifest in their forms and features the 
same beauty and fairness. This shows that the beauty in question does not belong to them; 
the visible instances of beauty are rather the signs and indications of a transcendent and 
sacred beauty.

TENTH WORD – FOURTH TRUTH

87

existence of countless hidden treasures in each of Allah’s names. Now so 
exalted,  peerless  and  hidden  a  beauty,  just  as  it  desires  to  view  its  own 
fairness in a mirror and to behold the degrees and measures of its beauty in 
a conscious, yearning reﬂection, desires also to become manifest, in order 
to look on its own beauty through the eyes of others. That is, it wishes to 
look at its own  beauty in two ways; ﬁrstly, by beholding itself in mirrors 
of variegated colour; secondly, through the gaze of yearning witnesses to 
itself, of bewildered admirers of its beauty.

In  short,  beauty  and  fairness  desire  to  see  and  be  seen.  Both  of  these 
require the existence of yearning witnesses and bewildered admirers. And 
since  beauty  and  fairness  are  eternal  and  everlasting,  their  witnesses  and 
admirers must have perpetual life. An eternal beauty can never be satisﬁed 
with  transient  admirers.  An  admirer  condemned  to  irreversible  separation 
will  ﬁnd  his  love  turning  to  enmity  once  he  conceives  of  separation.  His 
admiration will yield to ridicule, his respect to contempt. For just as obsti-
nate man is an enemy to what is unknown to him, so too he is opposed to 
all that lies beyond his reach, and love that is not inﬁnite will respond to a 
beauty that deserves unending admiration with implicit enmity, hatred and 
rejection. From this we understand the profound reason for the unbeliever’s 
enmity to Allah.

So endless generosity and liberality, peerless fairness and beauty, ﬂaw-
less  perfection  –  all  these  require  the  existence  of  eternally  grateful  and 
longing supplicants and admirers. But we see in this hospice of the world 
that everyone quickly leaves and vanishes, having had only a taste of that 
generosity, enough to whet his appetite but not to satiate him, and having 
seen only a dim light coming from the perfection, or rather a faint shadow of 
its light, without in any way being fully satisﬁed. It follows, then, that men 
are going toward a place of eternal joy where all will be bestowed on them 
in full measure.

In short, just as this world, with all its creatures, decisively demonstrates 
the  existence  of  the  Glorious  Maker,  so  too  do  His  sacred  attributes  and 
names indicate, show and logically require, the existence of the hereafter.

FIFTH TRUTH
The gate of Compassion and Muhammadan Worship,
the Manifestation of the Names of
Answerer of Prayer and Compassionate

Is it at all possible that a Lord possessing inﬁnite compassion and mercy, 
Who  most  compassionately  fulﬁls  the  smallest  need  of  His  lowliest  crea-
tures in the most unexpected fashion, Who heeds the mufﬂed plea for help of 
His most obscure creature, and Who responds to all the petitions He hears, 
whether vocal or mute – is it at all possible that such a Lord should not pay 
heed to the greatest petition of the foremost among His servants, the most 
beloved among his creatures, that He should not hear and  grant his most 
exalted prayer? The kindness and ease manifested in the feeding and nurtur-
ing of weak and young animals show that the Monarch of the cosmos exer-
cises his dominicality with inﬁnite mercy.

Is it at all possible that a compassion merciful to this degree in the exer-
cise of dominicality should not accept the prayer of the most virtuous and 
beautiful of all creation?1 This truth is explained in the Nineteenth Word, but 
let us repeat our statement of the matter here:

O friend listening to these words together with my own soul! We said 
in the comparison that a meeting took place on a certain island, and a most 
noble  commander  delivered  a  speech  there.  In  order  to  ﬁnd  out  the  truth 
indicated in the comparison, come, let us depart from this age, and in our 
mind and imagination travel to the Arabian Peninsula in the blessed age of 
the Prophet ( UWBP ), in order to visit and watch him while he is performing 

1.  He whose kingdom has lasted one thousand three hundred and ﬁfty years, who has 
generally had more than three hundred and ﬁfty million subjects, to whom his subjects dai-
ly renew their pledge of allegiance and to whose perfections they continually bear witness, 
whose commands are obeyed in perfect submission, whose spiritual hue has coloured half 
of the globe and a ﬁfth of mankind, who is the beloved of men’s hearts and the educator 
of their spirits – such a being is without doubt the greatest servant of the Lord Who holds 
sway over the universe. Also, since most of the realms of beings applauded that being’s 
function and duty through each bearing the fruit of his miracles, he is for sure the most 
beloved creature of the Fashioner of the cosmos. Similarly, the desire for perpetuity exist-
ing in all men by virtue of their very nature, a desire that lifts men from the lowest of the 
low to the highest of the high, is the greatest of all desires and petitions, ﬁt to be presented 
to the Provider of all Needs only by the greatest among His servants.

his duties and engaging in worship. See, just as he is the means for the attain-
ment of eternal bliss, by means of his messengerhood and guidance, so too 
he is the cause for the existence of that bliss and the means for the creation 
of Paradise, by means of his worship and prayer.

Now see! That being is praying for eternal bliss in such supreme supplica-
tion, with such sublime worship, that it is as if this island, or even the whole 
world, were praying and supplicating together with him. For the worship he 
performs contains within itself not only the worship of the community that 
follows him, but also that of all the other prophets, in its essential form, by 
virtue of the correspondence existing between him and them. Moreover, he 
performs his supreme prayer and offers his supplications in such a vast con-
gregation that it is as if all luminous and perfect men, from the time of Adam 
down to the present, were following him in prayer and saying “ amen ” to 
his supplications!1 He is praying for so universal a need – immortality – that 
not merely the people of this earth, but also the inhabitants of the heavens 
and the entirety of creation are participating in his supplications and silently 
proclaiming, “ yes, o Lord! Grant his prayer; we too desire it. ” He petitions 
for everlasting bliss with such touching sadness, in so yearning, so longing, 
and so pleading a fashion, that he causes the whole of the cosmos to weep 
and thus to share in his prayer.

See, he desires and prays for bliss, for such a purpose and goal that he 
elevates man and all creatures from captivity in the abysmal state of utter 
annihilation,  from  worthlessness,  uselessness,  and  purposelessness  to  the 
apex  of  preciousness,  eternity,  exalted  function,  and  the  rank  of  being  a 
script penned by Allah.

See,  he  makes  his  petition  with  such  elevated  plea  for  succour,  makes 
his supplication with so sweet a request for mercy, that it is as if he caused 

1.  From the time that the Prophet ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) ﬁrst made 
his  supplication  down  to  the  present,  all  the  invocations  upon  him  of  peace  and  bless-
ings made by his community are a kind of eternal amen to his prayer, a form of universal 
participation in it. Every invocation of peace and blessings upon him by every member of 
the M u s l i m  community in the course of his prayer, as well as the prayer for him uttered 
after the second call to prayer according to the Shaﬁ‘i School – this too is a powerful and 
universal amen to his supplication for eternal bliss. So the eternity and everlasting bliss 
desired by all men with all of their strength, in accordance with their primordial disposi-
tion, is requested in the name of humanity by the Prophet ( UWBP ), and the luminous 
segment of humanity says “ amen ” after him. Is it at all possible that such a prayer should 
not be accepted?

THE WORDS

all beings, the heavens and Allah’s throne itself to listen, and to echo his 
prayer ecstatically with cries of “ amen, o Lord, amen! ” 1

See,  he  requests  bliss  and  eternity  from  a  Being,  One  so  All-Hearing, 
Generous  and  Powerful,  so  All-Seeing,  Merciful  and  Knowledgeable  that 
He sees, hears, accepts and takes pity upon the most secret wish, the slight-
est desire of the most obscure of his creatures, this, in observable form. He 
answers all pleas even if they are silently proffered. He bestows all things 
and answers all pleas in so wise, percipient and merciful a fashion that no 
doubt  remains  that  all  that  nurturing  and  regulating  can  derive  only  from 
One All-Hearing and All-Seeing, One Generous and Merciful.

Let us listen to what the Pride of All Being is requesting, that source of 
honour for all of mankind, that one unique in all of creation, who bears on  
his back the burden of all men, who standing on this earth lifts up his hands 
towards Allah’s throne and offers up a prayer which in its reality contains 
the essence of the worship of all of mankind. See, he is asking for eternal 
bliss for himself and for his community. He is asking for eternity and Para-
dise. He is making his plea together with all the divine sacred names that 
display their beauty in the mirrors of all created being. You can see, indeed, 
that he is seeking intercession from those names.

If there were not countless reasons and causes for the existence of the 
hereafter,  a  single  prayer  of  that  exalted  being  would  be  enough  for  the 

1.  Indeed, it is not at all possible that the Master of this world, all of Whose doings are 
self-evidently inspired by consciousness, knowledge and wisdom, should be unaware and 
uninformed of the acts of the foremost among all of His creatures. Again, it is not at all 
possible that the All-Knowing Master should remain indifferent to the deeds and prayers 
of that foremost among His creatures, and deem them unimportant despite being aware of 
them. It is further impossible that the Powerful and Merciful Master of the World should 
not accept his prayers, having not remained indifferent to them. Yes, through the light of 
the Muhammadan Being the form of the world has changed. The true essence of men and 
all beings in the cosmos became apparent through that light; it became clear that they are 
each missives of the Eternally Besought One proclaiming the divine names, precious and 
profound beings with Allah-given functions and destined to manifest eternity. Were it not 
for that light, beings would be condemned to utter annihilation, they would be valueless, 
meaningless, useless, confused, the result of blind chance, sunk in the darkness of illu-
sion. It is for this reason that just as men say “ amen ” to the prayer of the Prophet, so too 
all other beings, from the face of the earth up to Allah’s throne, from the soil to the stars, 
all take pride in his light, and proclaim their connection with him. The very spirit of the 
worship of the Prophet is indeed none other than this prayer. Again, all the motions and 
workings of the cosmos are in their essence prayer. For example, the progress of a seed 
until it becomes a tree is a form of prayer to the Creator.

creation of Paradise, a task as easy for the power of the Merciful Creator as 
the creation of spring.1

Indeed,  how  could  the  creation  of  Paradise  be  difﬁcult  for  the  Posses-
sor of Absolute Power Who each spring makes the face of the world into 
a  plain  of  resurrection,  and  brings  forth  there  a  hundred  thousand  exam-
ples  of  resurrection?  In  just  the  same  way  that  the  messengerhood  of  the 
Prophet was the reason for the foundation of this realm of trial – the saying 
ْ(cid:202)ا  ُتْ(cid:163)َ(cid:171)َ(cid:114) ا َ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:170)  َك َ(cid:202)ْوَ(cid:170)  َك َ(cid:202)ْوَ(cid:170) 2 being an indication of this – so too the worship 
َك َ(cid:203)ْ(cid:158)َ
he performed was the cause for the foundation of the abode of bliss.

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  the  ﬂawless  perfection  of  artistry,  the  peerless 
beauty of dominicality expressed in the order of the world and the compre-
hensive mercy that reduce all to bewilderment, should not answer his prayer, 
and  thus  tolerate  an  extreme  form  of  ugliness,  cruelty  and  disorder?  Is  it 
possible that it would listen to the most petty and insigniﬁcant desires and 
grant them, but dismiss signiﬁcant and important desires  as worthless, and 
fail to fulﬁl them? No, a thousand times no! Such beauty can never accept 
such ugliness and itself become ugly.3

So just as the Prophet ( UWBP ) opened the gates of this world with his 

messengerhood, he opens the gates of the hereafter with his worship.

ness, while yet remaining beauty, and, in our example, it is not possible that the beauty of 
dominicality, a beauty perceptible and manifest in its existence, should retain its quiddity 
as the beauty of dominicality, but become the very essence of ugliness. This would be the 
strangest of all impossible and false notions in the world.

SIXTH TRUTH
The Gate of Splendour and Eternity,
the Manifestation of the Names of Glorious and Eternal

Is it at all possible that the splendour of dominicality that subdues and 
commands all beings, from suns and trees down to particles, just like obe-
dient  soldiers,  should  concentrate  its  entire  attention  on  the  wretched  and 
transient beings that pass a temporary life in the hospice of this world, and 
not create an eternal and everlasting sphere of splendour, an unending mani-
festation of dominicality? The display of divine splendour in the changing 
of the seasons, the sublime motions of the planets in the heavens as if they 
were aeroplanes, the subjugation of all things and the creation of the earth as 
man’s cradle and the sun as his lamp, vast transformations such as the reviv-
ing and adornment of the dead and dry globe – all of this shows that behind 
the veil a sublime dominicality exists, that a splendid monarchy is at work.

Now  such  a  dominical  kingdom  requires  subjects  worthy  of  itself,  as 
well as an appropriate mode of manifestation. But look at this hospice of 
the  world, and you will see that the most signiﬁcant class of its subjects, 
endowed with the most comprehensive of functions, are gathered together 
only temporarily and that, in the most wretched of states. The hospice ﬁlls 
and empties each day. All of the subjects stay only temporarily in this abode 
of trial for the sake of being tested in service. The abode itself changes each 
hour. Again, all of the monarch’s subjects stay only for a few brief minutes 
in order to behold the samples of the precious bounty of the Glorious Maker, 
to look on His miraculous works of art in the exhibition of the world with 
the eye of a buyer. Then they disappear. The exhibition itself changes every 
minute. Whoever leaves it, never returns, and whoever comes to it, will ulti-
mately depart.

Now  this  state  and  circumstance  deﬁnitively  shows  that  behind  and 
beyond this hospice, this testing-ground, this exhibition, there are permanent 
palaces and eternal abodes that fully manifest and support Allah’s everlast-
ing sovereignty; there are gardens and treasure-houses full of the pure and 
exalted originals of the forms and copies we see in this world. If we strive 
here in this world, it is for the sake of what awaits us there. We work here, 

TENTH WORD – SIXTH TRUTH

93

and are rewarded there. Bliss awaits everyone there, in accordance with his 
capacity,  as  long  as  he  does  not  squander  his  share.  Yes,  it  is  impossible 
that such eternal kingship should concentrate exclusively on these wretched 
transient beings.

Consider this truth through the telescope of the following comparison. 
You are travelling along a road. You see a caravanserai ahead of you on the 
road, built by a great personage for people coming to visit him. Millions are 
spent on the decoration of the caravanserai so that guests should enjoy their 
one night’s stay there, and for their instruction. But the guests see very lit-
tle of those decorations, look at them for a very short time; brieﬂy tasting 
the joys of what is offered them, they go on their way without being sati-
ated. But each guest takes a photograph of the objects in the caravanserai 
by means of his special camera. Also, the servants of that great personage 
record with great care the conduct of all the guests and preserve the record. 
You see, too, that he destroys every day most of the valuable decorations, 
and replaces them with fresh decorations for the newly arriving guests. After 
seeing all this, will any doubt remain that the personage who has constructed 
this  caravanserai  on  the  road  has  permanent  and  exalted  dwellings,  inex-
haustible and precious treasures, an uninterrupted ﬂow of great generosity? 
By means of the generosity displayed in the caravanserai, he intends merely 
to whet the appetite of his guests for those things he keeps in his immediate 
presence; to awaken their desire for the gifts he has prepared for them. So 
too, if you look upon the state of the  hospice of this world without falling 
into drunkenness, you will understand the following nine principles:

First Principle

First Principle: You will understand that this world does not exist for its 
own sake, any more than does the caravanserai. It is impossible that it should 
assume this shape by itself. Rather, it is a well-constructed hospice, wisely 
designed  to  receive  the  caravan  of  beings  that  constantly  arrive  to  alight 
before departing again.

Second Principle

Second  Principle:  You  will  understand,  too,  that  those  living  within 
this hospice are guests. They are invited by their Generous Sustainer to the 
Abode of Peace.

Third Principle

Third Principle: You will understand, further, that the adornments of 
this world are not simply for the sake of enjoyment or recreation. For if they 
yield pleasure for a time, they cause pain for a longer time with their cessa-
tion. They give you a taste and whet your appetite, but never satiate you. For 
either the life of the pleasure is short, or your life is short, too brief for you 
to become satiated. These adornments of high value and brief duration must, 

94

THE WORDS

then, be for the sake of instruction in wisdom,1 for arousing gratitude, and 
for encouraging men to seek out the perpetual originals of which they are 
copies. They are, then, for other exalted goals beyond themselves.

Fourth Principle

Fourth Principle: You will understand also that the adornments of this 
world 2 are like samples and forms of the blessings stored up in Paradise by 

1.  Now the lifespan of everything is short, although its value is high and the subtleties 
of its artistry are most exalted and beautiful. This implies that everything is only a sample, 
a form of something else, that it has the function of drawing the gaze of the customer to 
the authentic and original object. This being the case, it may be said that the variegated 
adornments  of  this  world  are  the  samples  of  the  bounties  of  Paradise,  prepared  by  the 
Compassionate and Merciful One for His beloved servants.

2.  There are numerous purposes for the existence of everything, and numerous results 
ﬂow from its being. These are not restricted to this world and to the souls of men, as the 
people  of  misguidance  imagine,  being  thus  lost  in  vanity  and  purposelessness.  On  the 
contrary, the purposes for the existence and the results of the lives of all things relate to the 
following three categories.

The ﬁrst and the most exalted pertains to the Creator. It consists of presenting to the 
gaze of the Pre-Eternal Witness the bejewelled and miraculous wonders He has afﬁxed to 
the object in question, as if in a military parade. To live for a ﬂeeting second is enough to 
attain that glance. Indeed, the potentiality and intent for existence is enough, without ever 
emerging into life. This purpose is fully realized, for example, by delicate creatures that 
vanish swiftly and by seeds and kernels, each a work of art, that never come to life, that 
is, never bear fruit or ﬂower. They all remain untouched by vanity and purposelessness. 
Thus the ﬁrst purpose of all things is to proclaim, by means of their life and existence, the 
miracles of power and the traces of artistry of the Maker and display them to the gaze of 
the Glorious Monarch.

The second purpose of all existence and the result of all being pertains to conscious 
creation. Everything is like a truth-displaying missive, an artistic poem, or a wise word 
of the Glorious Maker, offered to the gaze of angels and jinn, of men and animals, and 
desiring to be read by them. It is an object for the contemplation and instruction of every 
conscious being that looks upon it.

The third purpose of all existence and result of all being pertains to the soul of the 
thing itself, and consists of such minor consequences as the experience of pleasure and joy, 
and living with some degree of permanence and comfort. If we consider the purpose of a 
servant employed as a steersman on some royal ship, we see that only one hundredth of 
that purpose relates to the steersman himself, the wage he receives; ninty-nine hundredths 
of the purpose relate to the king who owns the ship. A similar relation exists between the 
purpose of a thing related to its own self and its worldly existence, and its purpose related 
to its Maker. In the light of this multiplicity of purposes we can now explain the ultimate 
compatibility between divine wisdom and economy on the one hand, and divine liberal-
ity  and  generosity  –  in  fact,  inﬁnite  generosity  –  on  the  other  hand,  even  though  they 
appear to be opposites and contradictory. In the individual purposes of things, liberality 
and  generosity  predominate,  and  the  name  of  Most  Generous  is  manifested.  From  the 
point of view of individual purpose, fruits and grains are indeed beyond computation, ==

TENTH WORD – SIXTH TRUTH

95

the mercy of the Compassionate One for the people of faith.

Fifth Principle

Fifth  Principle:  You  will  understand,  too,  that  all  of  these  transient 
objects have not been created for the sake of annihilation, in order to appear 
brieﬂy  and  then  vanish.  The  purpose  for  their  creation  is  rather  brieﬂy  to 
be assembled in existence and acquire the desired form, so that these may 
be noted, their images preserved, their meanings known, and their results 
recorded.  This  is  so  that,  for  example,  everlasting  spectacles  might  be 
wrought for the people of eternity, and that they might serve other purposes 
in the realm of eternity. You will understand that things have been created 
for eternity, not for annihilation; and as for apparent annihilation, it has the 
sense of a completion of duty and a release from service, for every transient 
thing advances to annihilation with one aspect, but remains eternally with 
numerous other aspects.

Look, for example, at the ﬂower, a word of Allah’s power; for a short 
time it smiles and looks at us, and then hides behind the veil of annihilation. 
It departs just like a word leaving your mouth. But it does so entrusting thou-
sands of its fellows to men’s ears. It leaves behind meanings in  men’s minds 
as numerous as those minds. The ﬂower, too, expressing its meaning and 
thus fulﬁlling its function, goes and departs. But it goes leaving its apparent 
form in the memory of everything that sees it, its inner essence in every seed. 
It is as if each memory and seed were a camera to record the adornment of 
the ﬂower, or a means for its perpetuation. If such be the case with an object 
at the simplest level of life, it can be readily understood how closely tied to 
eternity is man, the highest form of life and the possessor of an eternal soul. 
Again, from the fact that the laws – each resembling a spirit – according to 
which large ﬂowering and fruit bearing plants are formed and the represen-
tations of their forms are preserved and perpetuated in most regular fashion 

==  and  they  demonstrate  inﬁnite  generosity.  But  in  universal  purposes,  wisdom  pre-
dominates,  and  the  name  of All-Wise  is  manifested.  However  many  fruits  a  tree  has, 
each of its fruits contains that many purposes, and these can be divided into the three cat-
egories we have established. Their universal purposes demonstrate an inﬁnite wisdom 
and economy. Inﬁnite wisdom and inﬁnite generosity and liberality are thus combined, 
despite their apparent opposition. For example, one of the purposes for raising an army 
is the maintenance of order. Whatever troops are available for the purpose will sufﬁce 
or be more than enough. But the whole army will be barely enough for other purposes 
such as protecting the national frontiers and repelling enemies; its size will be in perfect 
balance with utter wisdom. Thus the wisdom of the state will be joined to its splendour, 
and it can be said that there is no excess in the army.

96

THE WORDS

in tiny seeds throughout tempestuous changes – from this fact it can be eas-
ily understood how closely tied and related to eternity is the spirit of man, 
which possesses an extremely exalted and comprehensive nature, and which 
although clothed in a body, is a conscious and luminous law issuing from 
the divine command.

Sixth Principle

Sixth Principle: You will also understand that man has not been left to 
graze at will, with a halter loosely tied around his neck; on the contrary, the 
forms of all his deeds are recorded and registered, and the results of all his 
acts are preserved for the day when he shall be called to account.

Seventh Principle

Seventh Principle: You will understand, further, that the destruction 
visited upon the beautiful creatures of summer and spring in the autumn 
is not for the sake of annihilation. Instead, it is a form of dismissal after 
the completion of service.1 It is also a form of emptying in order to clear 
a  space  for  the  new  creation  that  is  to  come  in  the  following  spring,  of 
preparing  the  ground  and  making  ready  for  the  beings  that  are  to  come 
and assume their functions. Finally, it is a form of divine warning to con-
scious beings to awake from the neglect that causes them to forget their 
duties, from the drunken torpor that causes them to forget their obligation 
of offering thanks.

Eighth Principle

Eighth Principle: You will understand this, too, that the eternal Maker 
of this transient world has another, everlasting world; it is to this that He 
urges and impels His servants.

Ninth Principle

Ninth  Principle:  You  will  understand,  also,  that  so  Compassionate  a 
Being will bestow upon His choice servants in that world such gifts as no 
eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard, nor has their image crossed the 
heart of any man.2 In this we believe.

1.  Yes, it is ﬁtting that the fruits, ﬂowers and leaves on the tips and branches of a tree, 
proceeding  from  the  treasuries  of  sustenance  provided  by  divine  mercy,  should  depart 
when they become old and their duties are at an end. Otherwise the gate will remain closed 
to those that come after them, and a barrier will be erected against the expansion of Al-
lah’s mercy and the services to be performed by their brethren ( i.e., other members of the 
species ). Moreover, with the passing of youth, they will become wretched and distraught. 
Spring is like a fruit-bearing tree that in turn is an indication of the plain of resurrection. 
Similarly, the world of humanity in every age is like a tree inviting contemplation, and the 
world as a whole is like an amazing tree the fruits of which are despatched to the market 
of the hereafter.

SEVENTH TRUTH
The Gate of Protection and Preservation,
the Manifestation of the Names of Preserver and Guardian

Is it at all possible that Allah’s attribute of Preserver, which protects all 
things with the utmost order and balance – things in the heavens and on the 
earth, on dry land and in the ocean, dry and wet, large and small, common-
place and exalted – and as it were, sifts their results by way of accounting 
– is it at all possible that this attribute should permit the deeds and acts of 
man, man who has been given the lofty disposition of humanity, the rank 
of the supreme vicegerency, and the duty of bearing the Supreme Trust, not 
to be recorded, not to be passed through the sieve of accounting, not to be 
weighed in the balance of justice, not to be punished or rewarded ﬁttingly, 
even though his acts and deeds closely pertain to Allah’s universal domini-
cality? No, it is not in any way possible!

Yes, the Being that administers this cosmos preserves all things in order 
and balance. Order and balance are the manifestation of knowledge and wis-
dom, of will and power. For we see that the substance of every created object 
is fashioned in well-ordered and symmetrical fashion. Not only is each of 
the forms it changes throughout its life well-ordered, but the totality of these 
forms is also marked by the same orderliness. We see, too, that the Glori-
ous Preserver preserves many forms of all things the life of which comes to 
an end when they have performed their function and which depart from the 
Manifest World, in the memories of men, that are like a kind of preserved 
tablet,1 or in a form of archetypal mirror. He also writes and inscribes a brief 
history of their life in a seed, that is like the result and outcome of the whole. 
Thus He causes all things to be preserved in mirrors pertaining to both the 
outer and inner worlds. The memory of man, the fruit of the tree, the kernel 
of the fruit, the seed of the ﬂower – all of these demonstrate the universality 
and comprehensiveness of the law of preservation.

Do  you  not  see  that  all  the  ﬂowers  and  fruits  of  the  vast  spring,  the  
records  of  their  deeds  in  appropriate  form,  the  laws  of  their  formation, 
and  the  images  of  their  forms,  are  all  inscribed  into  the  ﬁnite  space  of  a 
minute seed and are there preserved? The following spring, their record of 
deeds is set forth, in a form of accounting appropriate to them, and another 
vast  world  of  spring  is  brought  forth,  with  the  utmost  order  and  wisdom. 

1.  See, the footnote to the Seventh Aspect above.

THE WORDS

This demonstrates with what powerful comprehensiveness Allah’s attribute 
of Preserver exercises itself. Considering that the results of such transient, 
commonplace, impermanent and insigniﬁcant things are preserved, is it at 
all possible that men’s deeds, that yield important fruit in the world of the 
unseen, the world of the hereafter, and the world of spirits, from the point 
of view of universal dominicality, is it at all possible that they should not be 
guarded and preserved, should not be recorded as a matter of importance? 
No, by no means!

Yes, from this manifestation of Allah’s attribute of Preserver it can be 
deduced that the Master of all creation devotes great care to the orderliness 
of all things that come to pass in His realm. He pays great attention to the 
function of sovereignty, and lavishes extreme care on the dominicality of 
kingship. Thus He records, or causes to be recorded, the pettiest of happen-
ings, the smallest of services, and preserves in numerous things the form of 
everything that happens in His realm. This attribute of Preserver indicates 
that an important register of deeds will be subjected to a precise examination 
and weighing: the records of men’s deeds will stand revealed.

Now is it at all possible that man should be ennobled with the vicege-
rency and the Trust, that, as a witness to the universality of dominicality, he 
should proclaim Allah’s unity in the realm of multiplicity, and thus act as 
a controller and witness by having some share in the gloriﬁcation of Allah 
and worship of most beings – is it at all possible that he should do all of this 
and then go to his grave and sleep peacefully without ever being awakened? 
Without ever being asked concerning his deeds, small and great? That he 
should not go to the plain of resurrection and be tried at the Supreme Tribu-
nal? No, by no means!

Or is it possible for man to ﬂee and hide himself in annihilation, for him 
to enter the earth and conceal himself from that Powerful and Glorious One 
to  Whose  power  over  all  contingencies  in  the  future,1  the  occurrences  of  

1.  The entirety of the past, extending from the present back to the beginning of cre-
ation, consists of occurrences. Every day, year and century that came into being is like a 
line, a page, a book, written by the pen of destiny; the hand of Allah’s power has inscribed 
His miraculous signs there with the utmost wisdom and order. 

Similarly, time from the present until resurrection, Paradise and eternity, consists en-
tirely of contingencies. The past consists of occurrences, the future of contingencies. The 
past consists of occurrences, the future of contingencies. Now if these two chains of time 
be compared with each other, it will be seen to be true of a certainty that the Being That 
created yesterday and brought into being the creatures peculiar to it, is capable, too, of 
creating tomorrow together with its creatures. Again, there is no doubt that the beings and 
wonders of past time, that wondrous display, are the miraculous works of a Powerful ==

past time – each a miracle of His power – bear witness, and Who visibly 
creates winter and spring, that, taken together, resemble resurrection? Since 
man is not called to account and judged in ﬁtting fashion while in this world, 
it follows that he must proceed to a supreme tribunal and a ﬁnal felicity.

EIGHTH TRUTH
The Gate of Promise and Threat,
the Manifestation of the Names of Beautiful and Glorious

Is it at all possible that the Maker of this world, the Possessor of Absolute 
Knowledge and Absolute Power, should not fulﬁl the oft-repeated promise 
and  threat  that  has  been  proclaimed  unanimously  by  all  the  prophets  and 
been witnessed in unison by all the veracious and the saints, and thus display 
weakness and ignorance? Allah forbid! All that is implied by His promise 
and threat is not at all difﬁcult for His power to fulﬁl; it is extremely simple 
and easy. It is as easy for Him as bringing back next spring the countless 
beings of last spring, in part identically,1 in part in  simile.2 It is our need, 
the need of everything, His own need and the need of His dominical sov-
ereignty, that He should fulﬁl His promise. For Him to break His promise 
would be contrary to the dignity of His power, and it would contradict the 
comprehensiveness  of  His  knowledge.  For  the  breaking  of  a  promise  can 
arise only from ignorance or impotence.

==  and Glorious One. They bear decisive  witness  that that  Powerful  One is capable of 
creating all of the future and its contingencies, and manifesting all of its wonders.

The one who creates an apple must of a certainty be able to create all the apples in the 
world and to bring the vast spring into being. Conversely, the one who cannot create a 
spring cannot create a single apple either, for the apple is made at the same workbench. But 
the one who makes an apple can make the spring. Each apple is an example in miniature of 
a tree, even of a garden or a cosmos. The apple seed that carries within itself the life-story 
of the huge tree is, from the point of view of artistry, such a miracle that the one who cre-
ates it thus is incapable of nothing. So too, the one that creates today is able also to create 
the day of resurrection, and it is only the one capable of creating the spring that is able, too, 
to create resurrection. The one who afﬁxes all the worlds of past time to the ribbon of time 
and displays them there in utmost wisdom and order, is without doubt capable of attaching 
other beings to the ribbon of the future and displaying them there. In several of the Words, 
particularly the Twenty-Second Word, we proved with utter certainty that: “ the one who 
cannot create everything cannot create anything, and the one who can fashion one thing, 
can fashion everything. Also, if the creation of everything is entrusted to a single being, 
the creation of all things becomes as easy as the creation of a single thing; thus facility 
arises. If, on the contrary, it is entrusted to numerous causes, and ascribed to multiplicity, 
the creation of a single thing becomes as difﬁcult as the creation of everything, and such 
difﬁculty arises as borders on impossibility. ”

O denier! Do you know how foolish a crime you are committing with 
your unbelief and denial? Paying heed to your own lying fancy, your delir-
ious intellect, your deceptive soul, you reject as a liar One Who in no way 
can be compelled to the breaking of His promise, Whose glory and stature 
can  in  no  way  admit  the  breaking  of  His  word,  and  Whose  truthfulness 
and veracity are attested by all visible matters and objects! Despite your 
inﬁnite  pettiness,  you  are  committing  a  crime  of  inﬁnitely  great  propor-
tions. Without doubt you deserve great and eternal punishment. According 
to certain narrations, the fact that the teeth of some of the people of Hell 
will be as big as mountains 1 will serve as an indication of the magnitude 
of their crime. O denier, you are like a traveller who closes his eyes to the 
sunlight  and  looks  instead  at  the  fantasy  in  his  own  mind.  His  imagina-
tion  wishes  to  illumine  the  awesome  path  in  front  of  him  with  the  light 
proceeding from his mind’s lamp that in reality is no stronger than a glow-
worm. Whatever has been promised by Allah Almighty, Whose veracious 
words are these beings we see and Whose truthful, eloquent signs are the 
processes of nature, He will of a surety fulﬁl. He will establish a Supreme 
Tribunal, and bestow an ultimate bliss.

Is it at all possible that the One Who gives life to this vast dead and dry 
earth;  Who  in  so  doing  demonstrates  His  power  by  deploying  more  than 
three hundred thousand different forms of creation, each of them as remark-
able as man; Who further demonstrates in this deployment His all-embrac-
ing knowledge by the inﬁnite distinctions and differentiations He makes in 
the complex intermingling of all of those forms; Who directs the gaze of all 
His slaves to everlasting bliss by promising them resurrection in all of His 
heavenly decrees; Who demonstrates the splendour of His dominicality by 
causing all of His creation to collaborate with one another, to revolve within 
the circle of His command and His will, to aid one another and be submit-
ted  to  Him;  Who  shows  the  importance  He  has  given  to  man  by  creating 
him  as  the  most  comprehensive,  the  most  precious  and  delicate,  the  most

valued and valuable fruit on the tree of creation by addressing him without 
intermediary  and  subjugating  all  things  to  him;  –  is  it  at  all  possible  that 
so Compassionate and Powerful a One, so Wise and All-Knowing a One, 
should not bring about resurrection; should not gather His creatures together 
or be unable to do so; should not restore man to life, or be unable to do so; 
should not be able to inaugurate His supreme court; should not be able to 
create Heaven and Hell? Nay, indeed, by no means is any of this possible.

Indeed,  the  Almighty  Disposer  of  this  world’s  affairs  creates  in  every 
century, every year and every day, on the narrow and transient face of the 
globe, numerous signs, examples and indications of the Supreme Gathering 
and the Plain of Resurrection.

Thus  in  the  gathering  that  takes  place  every  spring  we  see  that  in  the 
course of ﬁve or six days more than three hundred thousand different kinds 
of animal and plant are ﬁrst gathered together and then dispersed. The roots 
of all the trees and plants, as well as some animals, are revived and restored 
exactly as they were. The other animals are recreated in a form so similar as 
to be almost identical. The seeds which appear, in their outward form, to be 
so close to each other, nonetheless, in the course of six days or six weeks, 
become distinct and differentiated from each other, and then with extreme 
speed,  ease  and  facility,  are  brought  to  life  in  the  utmost  order  and  equi-
librium. Is it at all possible that for the One Who does all of this anything 
should be difﬁcult; that He should be unable to create the heavens and the 
earth in six days; that He should be unable to resurrect men with a single 
blast? No, by no means is it possible!

Let us suppose there were to be some gifted writer who could write out in 
a single hour the confused and obliterated letters of three hundred thousand 
books on a single sheet without any error, omission or defect, complete and 
in the best form. If someone were then to say to you that that writer could 
write out again from memory in a minute a book written by him that had 
fallen into the water and become obliterated, would you then say that he is 
unable, and would you not believe in his ability? Or think of some talented 
king who, in order to demonstrate his power or for the sake of providing a 
warning example, removes whole mountains with a single command, turns 
his realm upside down, and transforms the sea into dry land.  Then you see 
that  a  great  rock  rolls  down  into  a  valley,  so  that  the  path  is  blocked  for 
guests travelling to attend the king’s reception and they are unable to pass. 
If someone should say to you: “ that exalted one will remove or dissolve the 
stone, however great it may be, with a single command; he will not leave 

102

THE WORDS

his guests stranded, ” would you then say that he will not remove the stone, 
or be unable to do so? Or if someone one day should gather together a great 
army, and you are then informed that he will summon its battalions together 
with a blast of the trumpet after they had dispersed to rest, and the battalions 
will form up in disciplined shape, would you respond by saying, “ I don’t 
believe it? ” Were you to say any of these things your behaviour would truly 
be madness.

If  you  have  understood  these  three  parables,  now  look  further  and  see 
how  the  Pre-Eternal  Designer  turns  over  in  front  of  our  eyes  the  white 
page of winter and opens the green pages of spring and summer. Then He 
inscribes on the page of the earth’s surface, with the pen of power and des-
tiny, in the most beautiful form, more than three hundred thousand species 
of creation. Not one encroaches upon another. He writes them all together, 
but none blocks the path of another. In their formation and shape, each is 
kept separate from the other without any confusion. There is no error in the 
writing. That Wise and Preserving One, Who preserves and inserts the spirit 
of a great tree in the smallest seed, no bigger than a dot – is it permissible 
even to ask how He preserves the spirits of those who die? That Powerful 
One Who causes the globe to revolve like a pebble in a sling – is it permis-
sible even to ask how He will remove this globe from the path of His guests 
who are travelling to meet Him in the hereafter?

Again, the One of Glorious Essence Who from non-being recruits anew 
and inscribes into His battalions, with the command of ² ± and with 
utmost discipline, the troops of all living things, the very particles of all of 
their bodies, and thus creates highly disciplined armies – is it permissible 
even  to  ask  how  He  can  make  bodies  submit  to  His  discipline  like  a  bat-
talion, how He can gather together their mutually acquainted fundamental 
particles, and their component members?

You can, moreover, behold with your own eyes, the numerous designs 
made  by  Allah  as  signs,  similes  and  indications  of  resurrection,  designs 
placed by Him in every age and epoch of the world, in the alternation of 
day and night, even in the appearance and disappearance of clouds in the 
sky. If you imagine yourself to have been living a thousand years ago, and 
then compare with each other the two wings of time that are the past and the 
future, then you will behold similes of the gathering and indications of resur-
rection as numerous as the centuries and days. If, then, after  witnessing so 
many similes and indications, you regard corporeal resurrection as improb-
able and rationally unacceptable, know your behaviour to be pure lunacy.

See what the Supreme Decree says concerning the truth we are discuss-

ing:

 × Ö Õ Ô Ó Ò Ñ Ð Ï Î Í 
( 30:50 ) á à ß Þ Ý Ü Û Ú Ù Ø
In Short: There is nothing that makes impossible the gathering of res-
urrection, and much that necessitates it. The glorious and eternal domini-
cality, the almighty and all embracing sovereignty of the One Who gives 
life and death to this vast and wondrous earth as if it were a mere animal; 
Who has made of this earth a pleasing cradle, a ﬁne ship, for man and the 
animals; Who has made of the sun a lamp furnishing light and heat to the 
hostelry of the world; Who has made of the planets vehicles for the con-
veyance of His angels – the dominicality and sovereignty of such a One 
cannot rest upon and be restricted to the transitory, impermanent, unsta-
ble, insigniﬁcant, changeable, unlasting, deﬁcient and imperfect affairs of 
this  world.  He  must,  therefore,  have  another  realm,  one  worthy  of  Him, 
permanent, stable, immutable and glorious. Indeed, He does have another 
kingdom, and it is for the sake of this that He causes us to labour, and to 
this that He summons us. All those of illumined spirit who have penetrated 
from outer appearances to truth, and have been ennobled with proximity to 
the divine presence, all the spiritual poles endowed with luminous hearts, 
all the possessors of lucent intelligence, all bear witness that He will trans-
fer  us  to  that  other  kingdom.  They  inform  us  unanimously  that  He  has 
prepared for us there reward and requital, and relate that He is repeatedly 
giving us ﬁrm promises and stern warnings.

As  for  the  breaking  of  a  promise,  it  is  baseless  and  utter  humiliation. 
It  cannot  in  any  way  be  reconciled  with  the  glory  of  His  sanctity.  Simi-
larly, failure to fulﬁl a threat arises either from forgiveness or powerless-
ness. Now unbelief is extreme crime, and cannot be forgiven.1 The  Abso-
lutely Omnipotent One is exempt of and exalted above all powerlessness. 

1.  Unbelief denounces creation for alleged worthlessness and meaninglessness. It is 
an insult to all of creation, a denial of the manifestation of the divine names in the mirror 
of beings. It is disrespect to all the divine names, and rejection of the witness borne to 
the divine unity by all beings. It is a denial of all creation. It corrupts man’s potentiali-
ties in such a way that they are incapable of reform and unreceptive to good. Unbelief is 
also an act of utter injustice, a transgression against all of creation and the rights of Al-
lah’s names. The preservation of those rights, as well as the unredeemable nature of the 
unbeliever’s  soul,  make  it  necessary  that  unbelief  should  be  unpardonable. The  words, 
( 31:13 ) D C B A  express this meaning.

104

THE WORDS

Those who bring us their testimony and report, despite all the differences in 
their methods, temperaments and paths, are totally unanimous and agreed 
on this basic matter. By their number, they have the authority of unanimity. 
By their quality, they have the authority of learned consensus. By their rank, 
each  one  is  a  guiding  star  of  mankind,  the  cherished  eye  of  a  people,  the 
object of a nation’s veneration. By their importance, each one is an expert 
and an authority in the matter. In any art or science, two experts are pre-
ferred to thousands of non-experts, and two positive afﬁrmers are preferred 
to thousands of negators in the transmission of a report. For example, the 
testimony  of  two  men  afﬁrming  the  sighting  of  the  crescent  moon  at  the 
beginning of Ramadan totally nulliﬁes the negation of thousands of deniers.
In Short: In the whole world there is no truer report, no ﬁrmer claim, no 
more apparent truth than this. The world is without doubt a ﬁeld, and the res-
urrection a threshing-ﬂoor, a harvest. Paradise and Hell are each storehouses 
for the grain.

TENTH TRUTH
The Gate of Wisdom, Grace, Mercy and Justice;
the Manifestation of the Names of All-Wise,
Generous, Just and Merciful

Is it at all possible that the Glorious Possessor of all Dominion in this 
impermanent hospice of the world, in this transient place of testing, in this 
unstable showplace of the earth so manifest a wisdom, so evident a grace, 
so overwhelming a justice, so comprehensive a mercy – is it at all possible 
that in His realm, in the worlds of the outer and inner dimensions of things, 
there should not exist permanent abodes with eternal inhabitants, everlasting 
stations with immortal residents, and that as a result all the truths of wisdom, 
grace, mercy and justice that we now see should decline into nothingness.

Again, is it at all possible that that All-Wise Being should choose man, 
among all His creation, to receive direct and universal address from Him, 
should make him a comprehensive mirror to Himself, should permit him to 
taste, weigh, and become acquainted with, all the contents of His treasuries 
of mercy, should make Himself known to him with all His names, should 
love him and make Himself beloved of him – that He should do all this and 
then fail to despatch wretched man to that eternal realm, to invite him to that 
abode of permanent bliss and make him happy there?

Is it at all reasonable that He should impose on every being, even the 
seed,  a  task  as  heavy  as  a  tree,  mount  in  it  instances  of  His  wisdom  as 

TENTH WORD – TENTH TRUTH

105

numerous as the ﬂowers, and beneﬁcial aspects as numerous as the fruits, 
but assign to that task, to those instances of His wisdom and those ben-
eﬁcial  aspects,  a  purpose  pertaining  only  to  this  world,  one  as  small  as 
a seed? That He should make that purpose nothing more than the life of 
this  world,  something  less  valuable  than  a  grain  of  mustard  seed?  That 
He should not make of beings seeds for the world of meaning and tillage 
for the realm of the hereafter, for them to yield there their true and wor-
thy results? That He should permit such signiﬁcant alternations to remain 
without purpose, to be empty and vain? That He should not turn their faces 
towards the world of meaning and the hereafter, so that they might there 
reveal their true purposes and ﬁtting results?

Again,  is  it  at  all  possible  that  by  thus  causing  things  to  controvert 
their own nature He should present His own veracious names, All-Wise, 
Generous, Just, Merciful, as being characterized by their opposites – Allah 
forbid!  –  that  He  should  deny  the  true  essences  of  all  those  beings  that 
indicate His wisdom and generosity, His justice and mercy, that He should 
reject the testimony of all creatures, that He should negate the indications 
made by all things?

Can intelligence at all accept that Allah should impose on man and his 
senses duties as numerous as the hair on his head, but give him no more than 
an earthly reward, something no more valuable than a hair? That He should 
act meaninglessly, in a fashion contrary to His true justice and opposed to 
His true wisdom?

Again, is it at all possible that Allah Who proves and shows Himself to 
be a possessor of absolute wisdom, by attaching to every animate being, or 
even to every member like the tongue, indeed to every creature, instances 
of His wisdom and sources of beneﬁt as numerous as the results and the 
fruits He has attached to a tree – is it at all possible that He should fail to 
bestow of Himself the greatest of all instances of His wisdom, the most 
signiﬁcant of all sources of beneﬁt, the most necessary of all results, that 
which makes His wisdom into wisdom, His blessings into blessings, His 
mercy into mercy, the source and aim of all of His wisdom, bounty, mercy 
and  beneﬁcence  –  eternity,  the  meeting  with  Him  in  the  hereafter  and 
everlasting bliss? Were He to abandon these, He would plunge all of His 
doings unto utter pointlessness and cause Himself to resemble a being who 
constructed a palace, each stone of which contained thousands of designs, 
in each corner of which thousands of adornments were to be found, and 
in  each  part  of  which  thousands  of  precious  household  instruments  and 

106

THE WORDS

tools were provided, but failed to build a roof over it, so that everything 
rotted  and  was  needlessly  destroyed.  No,  by  no  means  can  this  be  true! 
From  absolute  goodness  comes  forth  goodness,  and  from  the  Possessor 
of Absolute Beauty comes forth beauty. So too nothing devoid of purpose 
can emerge from the Possessor of Absolute Wisdom.

Whoever in his imagination embarks on the ship of history and sets sail 
for the past, will see dead stages, places, gatherings and worlds, as numer-
ous as the years, and each like the stopping-place that is the world, the ﬁeld 
of trial, the gathering of creation, that we now see. In form and quality they 
are different from each other, but they resemble each other with respect to 
their orderliness, their wondrousness and the fashion in which they display 
the power and wisdom of the Maker.

In  those  impermanent  stopping-places,  those  transient  ﬁelds,  those 
ﬂeeting gatherings, he will also see the orderly workings of so manifest a 
wisdom, the indications of so evident a beneﬁcence, the signs of so impe-
rious a justice, the fruits of so comprehensive a mercy, that he will know 
of a certainty – unless totally devoid of perception – that a more perfect 
wisdom  that  that  which  he  beholds  is  inconceivable,  that  a  beneﬁcence 
more beauteous than that the signs of which he observes is impossible, that 
a justice more glorious than that the indications of which he sees cannot 
exist,  and  a  mercy  more  comprehensive  than  that  the  fruits  of  which  he 
sees is unimaginable.

If, to suppose the impossible, there were no permanent abodes, lofty man-
sions,  everlasting  stations  and  eternal  abodes,  with  their  eternal  residents, 
Allah’s joyous servants, in the realm of that Eternal Monarch Who disposes 
all affairs and Who constantly is changing the hospice and its inmates, then 
it would be necessary to reject the true essences of wisdom, justice, beneﬁ-
cence and compassion, those four powerful and universal spiritual elements 
that  are  like  light,  air,  water  and  earth,  and  to  deny  their  existence,  even 
though they are as apparent as that of the external elements. For it is plain 
that  this  impermanent  world  and  its  contents  cannot  be  a  complete  mani-
festation of their true essences. If there is no other place, somewhere else, 
where they can be manifested fully, it then becomes necessary, with a lunacy 
like that of the man who denies the existence of the sun even though he sees 
its light ﬁlling the day, to deny the wisdom that we can see in everything 
in  front  of  our  eyes;  to  deny  the  beneﬁcence  that  always  we  can  observe 
in our own souls and in most other things; to deny the justice the signs of 

TENTH WORD – TENTH TRUTH

which appear so strongly; 1 and to  deny the compassion we see everywhere 
in operation. It follows in turn that we must regard as a foolish prankster, a 
treacherous tyrant, the one from whom proceed all the wise processes, the 
generous  deeds  and  the  merciful  gifts  we  perceive  in  the  universe.  Allah 
forbid that this should be so; it is a totally impossible reversal of the truth. 
Even the foolish Sophists, who denied the existence of everything and even 
that of their own selves, would not readily contemplate such a proposition.

In Short: Considering the utter disparity between – on the one hand – 
this state of affairs which we see together with the universal fusions of life 
and  the  swift  separations  of  death,  the  imposing  gatherings  and  the  rapid 
dispersions, the magniﬁcent revolutions and the great manifestations, and – 
on the other hand – the petty fruits we see brieﬂy attained in this transient 
world,  the  temporary  and  insigniﬁcant  purposes  of  beings  that  pertain  to 
this world, we conclude that the non-existence of the hereafter would mean 
attaching to a little stone wise purposes as great as a mountain, and to a great 
mountain, a purpose as petty as a small stone. No intelligence or wisdom can 
ﬁnd this acceptable.

In other words, this lack of proportion between beings and these matters 
on the one hand, and their purposes pertaining to this world on the other, 
demonstrates  with  certainty  that  all  beings  have  their  faces  turned  to  the 
world of meaning. It is there that they will yield their appropriate fruits, and 
their eyes are ﬁxed on the sacred names. Their ultimate aims pertain to that 
world alone. While their substance is hidden beneath the soil of this world, 
their ﬂowers will unfold in the World of Similitudes. Man sows and is sown 
in this world, in accordance with his capacity; the harvest is gathered in the 
hereafter. If you look at the aspect of things that is turned towards the divine 

1.  There are two varieties of justice, one afﬁrmative, the other negative. The positive 
variety consists in giving the deserving his right. This form of justice exists throughout 
the world in the most obvious fashion, because, as proven in the Third Truth, it observably 
bestows, in accordance with special balances and particular criteria, all the objects of de-
sire requested by everything from its Glorious Creator with the tongue of innate capacity, 
the language of natural need, the speech of necessity, and all the requirements of life and 
existence. This variety of justice is, then, as certain as life and existence itself. 

The  other  variety  of  justice,  the  negative,  consists  in  chastising  the  unjust;  it  gives 
wrongdoers their due by way of requital and punishment. This type of justice is not fully 
manifest in this world, even though there are countless signs and indications that permit us 
to sense its true nature. For example, all the chastising blows and punitive lashes that have 
descended on all rebellious peoples, from the ‘Ad and Thamud to those of the present age, 
show deﬁnitely that an exalted justice dominates the world.

THE WORDS

names  and  the  hereafter  you  will  see  that  each  seed,  a  miracle  of  power, 
has an aim as vast as a tree. Each ﬂower, which is like a  word of divine 
wisdom, has meanings as numerous as the ﬂowers on a tree, and each fruit, 
a wonder of Allah’s workmanship and a poem dictated by His mercy, has 
wise purposes as numerous as the fruits of a tree. As for the fruit serving us 
as sustenance, it is merely one out of those many thousand wise purposes; 
it fulﬁls its purpose, expresses its meanings, and dies, being buried in our 
stomach. 1 Since these transient beings yield eternal fruits in another place, 
leave  there  permanent  forms  of  themselves,  and  express  there  everlasting 
meanings;  since  they  engage  in  ceaseless  gloriﬁcation  of  the  Maker;  and 
since man becomes man by perceiving these aspects of things that are ori-
ented to the hereafter, thus ﬁnding his way to eternity by means of the tran-
sient – since all of this is true, there must be some other purpose for all these 
beings that are cast around between life and death, that are ﬁrst gathered and 
then dispersed.

There is no error in this comparison: the above-mentioned state of affairs 
resembles circumstances formed and arranged by way of imitation and rep-
resentation. Brief gatherings and dispersions are arranged at great expense 
merely for the sake of taking pictures that can thereafter be shown in the cin-
ema. So too, one of the reasons for our passage through individual and social 
life in this life, for a brief time, is to enable pictures to be taken and images 
formed, to enable the result of our deeds to be registered and recorded, for 
display on a day of accounting, for being shown at a vast gathering, and to 
yield the fruit of supreme happiness. The noble saying of the Prophet ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) “ This world is the tillage for the hereafter, ”2 
indicates this meaning.

Since the world exists, and within this world wisdom, beneﬁcence, com-
passion and justice also exist, with their numerous evidences, of a certainty 
the hereafter also exists, just as surely as does this world. Since one aspect 
of everything in this world is turned to that world and is proceeding toward 
it, to deny that world would be denying this world with all it contains. Just 
as the allotted hour and the grave await man, so too do Paradise and Hell, 
anxiously watching for his arrival.

1.  If it be asked, “ why do your parables consist chieﬂy of ﬂowers, seeds and fruits, ” 
our answer is that they are the most wondrous, remarkable and delicate of the miracles of 
Allah’s power. Moreover, since naturalists, philosophers and the people of misguidance 
have been unable to read the subtle script written upon them by the pen of destiny and 
power, they have choked on them, and fallen into the swamp of nature.

TENTH WORD – ELEVENTH TRUTH

ELEVENTH TRUTH
The Gate of Humanity, and
the Manifestation of the Name of Truth

Is it at all possible that Allah Almighty, He Who is worshipped by right, 
should create man within creation as the most signiﬁcant of all of His serv-
ants with respect to His absolute dominicality and with respect to His uni-
versal dominicality in all of His realms; that He should make him the most 
thoughtful recipient of His glorious address, the most comprehensive mirror 
to the manifestation of His names; that He should create him as the most 
beautiful miracle of His power in the fairest of forms, in order to receive 
the manifestation of the greatest name, as well as that quality of the greatest 
name inherent in the other names, in order for him to assess and perceive the 
contents of His treasuries of mercy; that He should make him an investigator 
of secrets equipped more than any other creature with balances and instru-
ments; and He should make him the most needy of all creatures with respect 
to His inﬁnite gifts, the one suffering most from annihilation and the one 
most desirous of immortality; that He should make him the most delicate, 
the poorest and neediest of animals, most wretched and subject to pain in 
his worldly life but most sublime in disposition, in the highest of forms and 
characters – is it possible that Allah Almighty should do all this with man 
and not send him to the eternal realm for which he is suited and ﬁtted and 
for which he is longing? Is it possible that He should thus negate the whole 
essence of humanity, act in a manner totally contrary to His own veracity, 
and perform an act of injustice that the eye of truth must deem ugly?

Again, is it at all possible that He Who rules justly, Whose mercy is 
absolute,  should  bestow  on  man  such  a  disposition  that  he  took  up  the 
Supreme  Trust,  from  which  the  heavens  and  mountains  both  shrank,  in 
order to measure and know, with his slight and petty measures and crafts, 
the  all  encompassing  attributes,  the  universal  workings,  and  the  inﬁnite 
manifestations of the Creator; that He should create him as the most deli-
cate, vulnerable, weak and powerless of beings, while yet entrusting him 
with the regulation of all the vegetal and animal life upon earth, and caus-
ing him to intervene in their modes of worship and gloriﬁcation of Allah; 
that He should cause him to be a representation in miniature of His cosmic 
processes; that He should cause him to proclaim His glorious dominicality 
to all beings, in word and deed; that He should prefer him to the angels 
and give him the rank of vicegerent – is it at all possible that Allah should  

110

THE WORDS

bestow  all  of  this  on  man  and  not  give  him  eternal  bliss,  the  purpose, 
result and fruit of all of these duties? That He should cast him down to low 
degree, as the most wretched, ill-fortuned, humiliated and suffering of all 
His creatures; or that He should make of intelligence, a gift from His own 
wisdom and a most blessed and luminous tool for the attainment of hap-
piness, an inauspicious and sombre tool of torment for that wretch, thus 
acting in total contradiction to His absolute wisdom and in opposition to 
His absolute mercy? No, it is by no means possible!

In Short: Just as we saw by looking at the identity papers of an ofﬁcer in 
our comparison that his rank, duty, wage, instructions and equipment prove 
that he exists not for the sake of some temporary battleﬁeld, but rather that he 
is proceeding to some permanent kingdom, for the sake of which he is exert-
ing himself – so too those to whom truth and certainty have been unveiled 
are unanimously agreed that the subtleties inscribed in the book of man’s 
heart, the senses written down in the notebook of his intellect, the equipment 
contained in his essential character, are all turned towards eternal bliss; they 
have been given to man and fashioned in accordance with this ultimate goal.
For example, if one servant and illustrator of the intellect called the imag-
inative power, is told that “ you can have a million years of life and rule over 
the world, but in the end you shall become nothing, ” it will react with sor-
row instead of pleasure, unless deceived by vain fancy and the interference 
of the soul. The greatest of transient things cannot, then, satisfy the smallest 
faculty of man.

It is, then, this disposition of man – his desires extending to eternity, his 
thoughts that embrace all of creation and his wishes that embrace the dif-
ferent varieties of eternal bliss – that demonstrates he has been created for 
eternity and will indeed proceed to eternity. This world is like a hospice for 
him, a waiting-room for the hereafter.

TWELFTH TRUTH
The Gate of Messengerhood and Revelation,
and the Manifestation of

(cid:2)(cid:3)
Is  it  at  all  possible  that  errant  doubts,  no  stronger  than  the  wing  of  a 
ﬂy, could close the path to the hereafter and the gate to Paradise that have 
been  deﬁnitively  opened  by  the  Most  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be 
blessings and peace ), with all of his might, relying upon the power of his

thousand  certiﬁed  miracles  as  well  as  the  thousands  of  decisive  verses  of 
the All-Wise Qur’an, a book miraculous in forty different ways – that Mes-
senger whose words are afﬁrmed by all of the other prophets, relying upon 
their own miracles, whose claim is afﬁrmed by all of the saints, relying upon 
their visionary and charismatic experiences, and to whose veracity all of the 
puriﬁed scholars bear witness, relying upon their investigations of truth?

* * *

From the previous truths it has become apparent that resurrection is so 
ﬁrmly rooted a truth that not even a power capable of lifting up the globe, 
breaking it and casting it aside, could shake it. For Allah Almighty Him-
self afﬁrms this truth in accordance with the meaning of all His names and 
attributes; His Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) conﬁrms it with all of his mira-
cles and evidences; the All-Wise Qur’an establishes it with all of its truths 
and verses; and the cosmos itself bears witness to it with all the creational 
signs it contains and all the wise processes that take place within it. Is it at 
all possible that the Necessary Being should unite with all of His creation 
( excepting only the unbelievers ) on this question of resurrection, and doubts 
feebler than a whisker and satanic insinuations should shake and uproot that 
exalted  and  ﬁrmly-rooted  truth  which  resembles  a  mountain?  No,  by  no 
means!

Beware, do not imagine that the proofs of resurrection are restricted to 
the  Twelve  Truths  we  have  mentioned.  The  All-Wise  Qur’an  alone,  that 
instructed us in these twelve Truths, indicates thousands of other aspects of 
the matter as well, each aspect being a sign that our Creator will transfer us 
from this transient realm to an eternal one.

Again, do not imagine that the divine names which logically require the 
existence of resurrection are only those we have discussed – Wise, Gener-
ous, Merciful, Just, Preserver. On the contrary, all the divine names manifest 
in the ordering of the cosmos logically require the existence of resurrection, 
indeed make it imperative.

Do not imagine, either, that the creational signs indicating resurrection 
are  conﬁned  to  those  we  have  mentioned  above.  On  the  contrary,  in  the 
majority  of  beings,  there  exist  different  aspects  and  qualities  that  are  like 
curtains  opening  to  the  right  and  the  left:  one  aspect  bears  witness  to  the 
Maker, and the other aspect indicates resurrection. For example, the beauty 
of man’s being, fashioned as he is in the fairest of forms, demonstrates the 
existence of the Maker, while at the same time the fact that together with his 

112

THE WORDS

comprehensive abilities, lodged in that fairest of forms, he soon declines and 
dies, demonstrates the existence of resurrection. Sometimes, if  one looks 
at the same aspect in two different ways, one sees that it demonstrates the 
existence both of the Maker and of resurrection. For example, if one looks at 
the wise ordering, the just balance, the gracious adornment and the merciful 
favour inherent in most things, they are seen to demonstrate that they pro-
ceed from the powerful hand of a Wise, Generous, Just and Merciful Maker. 
So too, if one looks at the brief and insigniﬁcant life of the transient beings 
that are the manifestations of these qualities, despite their power and inﬁni-
tude,  the  hereafter  appears  before  one.  In  other  words,  all  things  silently 
recite and cause others to recite ِر ِ(cid:114)ٰ

Conclusion

The  preceding  twelve  Truths  conﬁrm,  supplement  and  support  each 
other. Coming together in union, they demonstrate the required result. Does 
it lie in the capacity of any doubt to penetrate those twelve ﬁrm walls, each 
like steel or diamonds, in order to shake the belief in resurrection housed 
within their closed citadel?

The verse,  ( 31:28 ) â á à ß Þ Ý Ü indicates the 
following meaning: “The creation and resurrection of all men is as easy for 
Allah’s power as the creation and resurrection of a single man.” Yes indeed. 
In a treatise entitled Nokta ( Point ), I explained in detail the truth expressed 
by this verse. Here we will indicate only a summary by means of a few com-
parisons. If you want more detail, then refer to N o k t a .

For example, ( 16:60 )  j  i  h  and there is no error in the com-
parison, if the manifestation of the sun were in accordance with its own will, 
it could be said that the sun bestows its mystery of manifestation on numer-
ous transparent objects with the same ease as on a single particle.

In accordance with the mystery of transparency, the little pupil of a trans-
parent particle is equal to the vast face of the ocean in receiving the reﬂec-
tion of the sun.

In accordance with the mystery of order, it overturns a huge battleship 

with the same ease as a child turning over his toy boat with his ﬁnger.

ٰ
TENTH WORD – CONCLUSION

113

In  accordance  with  the  mystery  of  obedience,  it  causes  a  vast  army  to 
move with the same word that a commander uses to make a single infantry-
man move.

In accordance with the mystery of equilibrium, let us imagine there to 
exist in space a balance so sensitive and at the same time so large that were 
two walnuts to be placed in its pans it would feel them, and be equally able 
to hold and to weigh two suns. If two suns of equal weight were placed in 
the pans of the scale; the same power, which causes one of the walnuts to be 
lifted up to the heavens and the other walnut to descend to the ground, will 
move these heavenly bodies with the same ease. Since in this lowly, deﬁ-
cient and transient world of contingency, the greatest and smallest things are 
equal, and numerous, inﬁnite things appear equal to a single thing, through 
the mystery of luminosity, transparency, order, obedience and balance, then 
of a certainty little and much, small and great, will be equal before the pos-
sessor of absolute power, and He will be able to summon all men to resur-
rection with a single blast on the trumpet, just as if they were one man – this, 
by virtue of the mysteries of the luminous manifestations of the inﬁnite and 
utterly perfect power of His essence, the transparency of the inner dimension 
of things, the order decreed by wisdom and destiny, the complete obedience 
of  all  things  to  His  creational  commands,  and  the  equilibrium  existing  in 
contingent being, that consists of the equivalence of the being and non-being 
of the contingent.

Furthermore, the degrees of strength and weakness that a thing possesses 
are determined by the intervention in that thing of its opposite. For exam-
ple, degrees of heat are determined by the intervention of cold; degrees of 
beauty, by the intervention of ugliness; stages of light, by the intervention 
of darkness. But if something exists of itself, and is not accidental, then its 
opposite cannot interfere with it, for then a union of opposites would logi-
cally have to occur, and that is impossible. In something that exists of itself, 
there can then be no gradation. Now the power of the Possessor of Abso-
lute Power pertains to His essence; it enjoys absolute perfection and is not 
accidental like contingent being. It is therefore impossible that its opposite, 
impotence, should intervene in it. Hence it is as easy for the Lord of Glory 
to create a spring as it is to create a ﬂower. But if creation were ascribed to 
causality, then the creation of a single ﬂower would be as difﬁcult as that of 
a whole spring. For Allah it is as easy to resurrect and gather all men as it is 
to resurrect and gather one man.

meek acceptance has disappeared. For the amount vouchsafed to each of us 
is enough for the salvation of our faith. Being content with the amount that 
we have been able to understand, we should reread the treatise and seek to 
increase our comprehension. 

One  of  the  reasons  that  it  is  impossible  to  approach  a  rational  under-
standing of resurrection is that since the supreme gathering, resurrection, is 
through the manifestation of the greatest name, only through beholding and 
demonstrating the great deeds evident in the maximum manifestation of the 
greatest name of Allah as well as His other names, is it possible to prove it as 
certain; and unshakeably believe that resurrection is as simple as the spring. 
Thus do matters appear and thus they are demonstrated in this Tenth Word 
( Resurrection and the Hereafter ), by means of the effulgence of the Qur’an. 
Were it not for this effulgence, and were our intelligence to be left to its own 
petty devices, it would be powerless, and condemned to believing in resur-
rection by way of imitation.

In this Ninth Ray will be expounded a supreme point of these sublime 
heavenly verses, which demonstrate one of the poles of belief; these mighty 
sacred proofs of the resurrection of the dead will be explained. It is a sub-
tle instance of dominical grace that thirty years ago at the end of his work 
entitled M u h â k e m a t  ( Rational Arguments ), which was written to set out the 
principles  of  Qur’anic  exegesis,  the  Old  Said  wrote:  “ Second  Aim:  Two

which was the ﬁrst of the two verses. They silenced the deniers of resurrec-
tion. Now, nine or ten years after those two impregnable bastions of belief 
in the resurrection of the dead, He bestowed with the present treatise a com-
mentary on the second of the above two sublime verses. This Ninth Ray, 
then, consists of nine elevated stations, indicated by the above-mentioned 
verses, and an important introduction.

Introduction

[ This consists of two points comprising a concise explanation of one 
comprehensive result of the numerous spiritual beneﬁts of belief in res-
urrection and of its vital consequences; a demonstration of how essen-
tial it is for human life and especially for the life of society; a summary 
of one universal proof out of numerous proofs of the tenet of belief in 
the resurrection; and a statement of how indubitable and self-evident is 
that tenet of belief. ]

First Point

FIRST POINT

First Proof

We shall indicate, as a measure, only four out of hundreds of proofs that 
belief in the hereafter is fundamental to the life of society and to man’s per-
sonal life, and is the basis of human happiness, prosperity, and achievement.
T h e   F i r s t :  It is only with the thought of Paradise that children, who form 
almost a half of humankind, can endure all the deaths around them, which 
appear to them to be grievous and frightening, and strengthen the morale of 
their weak and delicate beings. Through Paradise they ﬁnd hope in their vul-
nerable spirits, prone to weeping, and may live happily. For example, with 
the thought of Paradise, one may say: “ My little brother or friend has died 
and become a bird in Paradise. He is ﬂying around Paradise and living more 

ٰ
TENTH WORD – FIRST ADDENDUM

119

happily  than  us. ”  The  frequent  deaths  before  their  unhappy  eyes  of  other 
children  like  themselves  or  of  grown-ups  will  otherwise  destroy  all  their 
resistance and morale, making their subtle faculties like their spirits, hearts, 
and minds weep in addition to their eyes; they will either decline utterly or 
become crazy, wretched animals.

Second Proof

S e c o n d   P r o o f : It is only through the life of the hereafter that the elderly, 
who in one respect form half of mankind, can endure the proximity of the 
grave,  and  be  consoled  at  the  thought  that  their  lives,  to  which  they  are 
ﬁrmly attached, will soon be extinguished and their ﬁne worlds come to an 
end. It is only at the hope of eternal life that they can respond to the griev-
ous despair they feel in their emotional child-like spirits at the thought of 
death and decline. Those worthy, anxious fathers and mothers, so deserving 
of compassion and in need of tranquillity and peace of mind, will otherwise 
feel a terrible spiritual turmoil and distress in their hearts, and this world will 
become a dark prison for them, and life even, grievous torment. 

Third Proof

T h i r d   P r o o f : It is only the thought of Hell-ﬁre that checks the turbulent 
emotions  of  youths,  the  most  vigorous  element  in  the  life  of  society,  and 
their  violent  excesses,  restraining  them  from  aggression,  oppression,  and 
destruction, and ensuring that the life of society continues tranquilly. If not 
for fear of Hell, in accordance with the rule ‘might is right,’ in pursuing their 
desires, those drunken youths would turn the worlds of the wretched weak 
and powerless into Hell, and elevated humanity into base animality.

Fourth Proof

F o u r t h   P r o o f : The most comprehensive centre of man’s worldly life, and 
its mainspring, and a paradise, refuge, and fortress of worldly happiness, is 
the life of the family. Everyone’s home is a small world for him. And the 
life  and  happiness  of  his  home  and  family  are  possible  through  genuine, 
earnest, and loyal respect and true, tender, and self-sacriﬁcing compassion. 
This true respect and genuine kindness may be achieved with the idea of the 
members of the family having an everlasting companionship and friendship 
and togetherness, and their parental, ﬁlial, brotherly, and friendly relations 
continuing for all eternity in a limitless life, and their believing this. One 
says, for example: “ My wife will be my constant companion in an everlast-
ing world and eternal life. It does not matter if she is now old and ugly, for 
she will have an immortal beauty. ” He will tell himself that he will be as 
kind and devoted as he can for the sake of that permanent companionship, 
and treat his elderly wife lovingly and kindly as though she were a beautiful 
houri. A companionship that was to end in eternal separation after an hour 
or two of brief, apparent friendship would otherwise afford only superﬁcial, 

120

THE WORDS

temporary,  feigned,  animal-like  feelings,  and  false  compassion  and  artiﬁ-
cial respect. As with animals, self-interest and other overpowering emotions 
would prevail over the respect and compassion, transforming that worldly 
paradise into Hell.

Thus, one of the hundreds of results of belief in resurrection is connected 
with  the  life  of  society.  If  a  comparison  is  made  between  the  above  four 
proofs out of the hundreds of aspects and beneﬁts of this single consequence 
and the rest, it will be understood that the realization of the truth of resur-
rection, and its occurrence, are as certain as the elevated reality of humanity 
and its universal need. It is clearer even than the evidence for the existence 
of food offered by the existence of need in man’s stomach, and tells of its 
existence even more clearly. And it proves that if the consequences of the 
truth of resurrection were to quit humanity, whose nature is extremely sig-
niﬁcant, lofty, and living, it would descend to being a corrupt corpse fed on 
by microbes.

The sociologists, politicians, and moralists, who are concerned with the 
government  of  humankind  and  its  social  and  moral  questions  should  be 
aware of this! How do they propose to ﬁll this vacuum? With what can they 
cure these deep wounds?

Second Point

SECOND POINT

This explains in summary form a proof – one of many – proceeding from 
the testimony to the truth of resurrection of the other pillars of belief. It is 
as follows:

All the miracles indicating the messengership of Muhammad ( Upon and 
blessings be upon him ) and the evidences for his prophethood, and all the 
proofs of his veracity, together testify to the occurrence of the resurrection, 
and prove it. For after divine unity, everything he claimed throughout his life 
was centred on the resurrection of the dead. Also, all his miracles and proofs 
afﬁrming, and making afﬁrmed, all the previous prophets attest to the same 
truth. Also, the testimony of the phrase ِهِ(cid:93)ُ(cid:99)ﯭﯧِ(cid:92)َو which makes completely 
clear the testimony of the phrase ِهِ(cid:171) ُ(cid:126)ُرِ(cid:92)َو testiﬁes to the same truth. Like this:
All the miracles, truths, and proofs proving foremost the veracity of the 
Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition,  testify  to  and  prove  the  realization  and 
occurrence of resurrection. For almost a third of the Qur’an is about resur-
rection, and at the beginning of most of its short suras are powerful verses 
about it. It expresses the same truth explicitly and implicitly with thousands 

TENTH WORD – FIRST ADDENDUM

121

of its verses, and proves and demonstrates it. For example:

 ( 81:1 ) # " !
( 22:1 ) * ) ( ' & % $ # " !
 ( 84:1 ) . - ,  ( 82:1 ) # " !  ( 99:1 ) < ; : 9
( 88:1 ) 7 6 5 4   ( 78:1 ) " !
Besides demonstrating with complete certainty at the beginning of thirty 
or forty suras that resurrection is the most important and necessary truth in 
the universe, it sets forth various persuasive evidences for that truth in others 
of its verses. 

Is there any possibility that belief in the hereafter should be false, which 
emerges like the sun from the thousands of declarations and statements of 
a Book a single indication of one of the verses of which has yielded before 
our  eyes  the  fruits  of  numerous  learned  and  cosmic  truths  in  the  Islamic 
sciences? Is there any possibility of denying the sun, or the existence of the 
universe? Would it not be impossible and absurd? Is it at all possible that 
although an army may sometimes be plunged into battle so that a mere sign 
of the king should not be given the lie, to show as false the thousands of 
words, promises, and threats of that most serious, proud monarch? Is it pos-
sible that they should be false?

Although a single sign of that glorious spiritual monarch who for thirteen 
centuries  without  break  has  ruled  over  innumerable  spirits,  minds,  hearts, 
and souls within the bounds of truth and reality, and trained and raised them, 
would be sufﬁcient to prove the truth of resurrection, it has demonstrated it 
with thousands of explicit statements. Is the torment of Hell-ﬁre not neces-
sary then for the compounded idiot who does not recognize this fact? Is it 
not pure justice?

Moreover, by their deﬁnite acceptance of the truth of resurrection, which 
the Qur’an – prevailing over the future and all times – repeatedly proves in 
detail and elucidates, all the revealed scriptures and sacred books, each of 
which dominated a particular period, proved it according to their own times 
and centuries, but in undetailed, veiled, and summary manner, conﬁrming 
with a thousand signatures what the Qur’an teaches.

Included  here  since  it  is  related  to  this  discussion  is  the  testimony 
at  the  end  of  the  Third  Ray  of  the  other  pillars  of  faith  and  particularly

vincing proof of resurrection, and is in the form of a powerful yet succinct 
supplication, which dispels all doubts. It says in the supplication:

ْ(cid:202)ا ِمْوَ(cid:193)ْ(cid:170)اِ(cid:92) ٌنا َ(cid:175)ـ(cid:192)ِا It forms a con-

“ O My Compassionate Sustainer!
“ I have understood from the instruction of Your Noble Messenger 
( UWBP ) and the teaching of the All-Wise Qur’an, that foremost the 
Qur’an and the Messenger, and all the sacred scriptures and prophets, 
have unanimously testiﬁed, signiﬁed, and pointed out that the mani-
festations of the names related to Your beauty and glory, examples 
of which are to be seen all over this world, will continue even more 
radiantly for all eternity, and that Your bounties, compassionate sam-
ples and manifestations of which are to be observed in this transitory 
world, will continue in the abode of bliss in more glittering fashion, 
and that those who long for them in this world will accompany them 
for all eternity.

“ Also, relying on hundreds of evident miracles and decisive signs, 
foremost Your Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ) and the All-Wise Qur’an, and the prophets with their luminous 
spirits,  and  the  saints,  who  are  spiritual  poles  with  their  light-ﬁlled 
hearts, and the puriﬁed scholars with their enlightened intellects, rely-
ing on Your repeated threats and promises in all the sacred scriptures, 
and trusting in Your sacred attributes like power, mercy, favour, wis-
dom,  glory,  and  beauty,  and  on  Your  functions,  and  the  dignity  of 
Your glory, and the sovereignty of Your dominicality, and in conse-
quence of their illuminations and visions and beliefs at the knowledge 
of certainty and vision of certainty, give the glad tidings to men and 
jinn of eternal happiness and inform them of Hell for the people of 
misguidance; they ﬁrmly believe this and testify to it.

“ O All-Powerful and Wise One! O Most Merciful and Compas-
sionate! O Muniﬁcent One True to His Promise! O All-Compelling 
One of Glory, One of Dignity, Grandeur, and Wrath!

“ You are utterly exempt from and exalted above giving the lie to 
so many loyal friends, and so many promises, and attributes and func-
tions,  and  denying  the  certain  demands  of  the  sovereignty  of  Your 
dominicality and the endless prayers and supplications of Your innu-
merable acceptable servants, whom You love and who attract Your 

TENTH WORD – FIRST ADDENDUM

123

love by assenting to You and obeying You; and You are exempt from 
conﬁrming  the  denial  of  resurrection  by  the  people  of  misguidance 
and unbelief, who through their disbelief and rebellion and denial of 
Your promises, offend the magniﬁcence of Your grandeur and affront 
Your  dignity  and  glory  and  the  honour  of  Your  Godhead,  and  sad-
den the compassion of Your dominicality. We declare Your justice, 
beauty, and mercy to be exempt from such inﬁnite tyranny, such ugli-
ness. We believe with all our strength that the testimony of the proph-
ets, puriﬁed scholars, and saints, who are Your most numerous truth-
ful envoys, the heralds of Your sovereignty, at the degrees of absolute 
certainty, knowledge of certainty, and the vision of certainty, to the 
treasuries of Your mercy in the hereafter and the stores of Your boun-
ties in the everlasting realm, and to the wondrously beautiful mani-
festations of Your beautiful names, which will be manifested totally 
in the abode of bliss, are absolutely true and veracious, and what they 
have indicated conforms absolutely with reality, and that what they 
have given glad tidings of is true and will occur. Believing that the 
supreme  ray  of  Your  name  of  Truth,  which  is  the  source,  sun,  and 
protector  of  all  realities,  is  this  truth  of  the  resurrection  and  Great 
Gathering, they teach it to Your servants.

“ O Allah! For the sake of what they teach and in veneration of it, 
grant us and all students of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  perfect belief and a happy 
death. And allow us to receive their intercession. Amen! ”

Moreover,  just  as  all  the  proofs  demonstrating  the  truth  of  the  Qur’an 
indeed  of  all  the  revealed  scriptures,  and  all  the  miracles  and  evidences 
proving the prophethood of Allah’s Beloved (UWBP) and of all the proph-
ets,  indirectly  prove  the  reality  of  the  hereafter,  which  is  what  they  teach 
above all else; so most of the evidences for the existence and unity of the 
Necessary Existent testify indirectly to the existence and opening up of an 
eternal realm of bliss, which will be the means and supreme manifestation 
of dominicality and divinity. For as is explained and proved in the following 
paragraphs,  both  the  existence  of  the  Necessarily  Existent  One,  and  most 
of His attributes, functions and names, like dominicality, Godhead, mercy, 
grace,  wisdom,  and  justice,  necessitate  the  hereafter  with  the  utmost  cer-
tainty, and demand an eternal realm and the resurrection of the dead and Last 
Judgement for the granting of reward and punishment.

Since there is a pre-eternal and post-eternal Allah, most certainly there 

is the hereafter, the everlasting means of the sovereignty of His Godhead.

124

THE WORDS

And since there is in the universe and in living beings a most majestic, 
wise, and compassionate absolute dominicality, and it is apparent; there is 
certain to be an eternal realm of happiness which will save the majesty of 
that dominicality from abasement, its wisdom from purposelessness, and its 
compassion from cruelty; and that realm shall be entered.

And  since  the  unlimited  bestowals,  bounties,  favours,  gifts,  and 
instances of grace and mercy which are to be seen, show to minds that are 
not extinguished and hearts that are not dead that behind the veil of the 
Unseen is One All-Merciful and Compassionate; surely there is an immor-
tal  life  in  an  eternal  realm  which  will  save  the  bestowal  from  mockery, 
the  bounties  from  deception,  the  favours  from  enmity,  the  mercy  from 
torment,  the  grace  and  gifts  from  treachery,  and  will  make  the  bounties 
bounty and the bestowal bestowal.

And  since  in  the  springtime  on  the  narrow  page  of  the  earth,  a  pen  of 
power writes a hundred thousand books without error tirelessly before our 
eyes;  and  since  the  Holder  of  the  pen  has  promised  a  hundred  thousand 
times: “ I am going to write a ﬁne, immortal book in a broad realm, easier 
than this book of the spring, which is written in this narrow realm, confused 
and intermingled, and I shall allow you to read it; ” He mentions the book 
in all his decrees; certainly, the main part of the book has been written, and 
with the resurrection and Last Judgement its footnotes shall be added, and 
all the notebooks of people’s actions shall be recorded in it.

And since, with its multiplicity of creatures, and its being the dwelling, 
source,  factory,  exhibition,  and  gathering  place  of  hundreds  of  thousands 
of constantly changing species of living beings and beings with spirits, and 
the heart, centre, summary, and result of the universe, and the reason for its 
creation, the earth has supreme importance, and is held equal to the mighty 
heavens  despite  its  smallness;  in  the  heavenly  decrees,  it  is  always  said: 

P O N 

And since there is man, who rules over the earth, which is thus, has dis-
posal over most creatures, and subjects most living beings gathering them 
around himself; and so orders, displays, and gathers each remarkable species 
together in one place like a list, adorning them, that he attracts not only the 
attention and admiration of men and jinn, but of the dwellers of the heavens 
and the universe, and the appreciative gaze of the universe’s Owner, thus 
gaining great importance and high worth; and who shows through his sci-
ences and arts that he is the purpose of the universe’s creation, and its most 

TENTH WORD – FIRST ADDENDUM

125

important result, and most precious fruit, and vicegerent of the earth; and 
who because with respect to this world, he has ordered and displayed excel-
lently the miraculous arts of the world’s Maker, is left in this world despite 
his rebellion and disbelief, and whose punishment is postponed, and because 
of this work of his, whose term is prolonged and is allowed success.

And since there is an extremely powerful, wise, and compassionate Dis-
poser, Who makes the mighty globe into a treasury of every sort of metal  
and mineral that man needs in a way entirely beyond his strength and will – 
who despite being weak, impotent, and wanting by nature and creation, has 
innumerable needs and is subject to innumerable pains – and a store of every 
sort of food, and a shop stocking goods of every kind that pleases man, and 
looks to man in this way, and nurtures him, and gives him what he wants.

And  since  there  is  a  Sustainer  Who  is  thus,  Who  both  loves  man,  and 
causes man to love Him, and Who is enduring, and has eternal worlds, and 
Who  performs  every  work  with  justice,  and  carries  out  everything  with 
wisdom; and since the splendour of that Pre-Eternal Sovereign’s rule and 
His eternal rule cannot be contained in this brief worldly life, and in man’s 
ﬂeeting span, and in the temporary and transient earth; and since the exces-
sive wrongdoing and rebellion that occur among men, which are contrary 
to  and  opposed  to  the  universe’s  order,  justice,  balance,  and  beauty,  and 
their denial, treachery, and disbelief towards their Benefactor, Who nurtures 
them tenderly, are not punished in this world, and the cruel oppressor passes 
his  life  in  ease,  while  the  unhappy  oppressed  live  in  hardship;  and  since 
the absolute justice whose traces are to be seen throughout the universe is 
entirely opposed to the cruel tyrant and despairing oppressed being equal in 
death, and would in no way permit it.

And  since  just  as  the  universe’s  Owner  has  chosen  the  earth  from  the 
universe,  and  man  from  the  earth,  and  bestowed  on  him  a  high  rank  and 
importance; so out of mankind He has chosen the prophets, saints, and puri-
ﬁed ones, true human beings who conform to the aims of His dominicality 
and through their belief and submission make Him love them; He has taken 
them as friends and addressees, and bestowed miracles and success on them 
and punished their enemies with heavenly blows. And out of these worthy 
and lovable friends He has chosen their leader and source of pride, Muham-
mad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), and for long centuries has illu-
minated with his light half the globe and a ﬁfth of humanity; as though the 
universe was created for him, all its purposes become apparent through him 

126

THE WORDS

and  his  religion  and  the  Qur’an.  And  although  he  deserved  to  live  for  an 
inﬁnite time in recompense for his inﬁnitely valuable service, for millions of 
years, he only lived a brief sixty-three years of great hardship and striving. 
Is there any possibility then that he should not be resurrected together with 
all his peers and friends? That they should not now be living in the spirit? 
That they should have been annihilated eternally? Allah forbid, a hundred 
thousand times! Yes, all the universe and the reality of the world demand 
that he should be resurrected and they beseech the universe’s Owner that he 
should be living.

And since in the Seventh Ray, T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n , each with the strength 
of a mountain, the thirty-three powerful consensuses have proved that the 
universe emerged from a single hand and is the property of a single being; 
and have demonstrated self-evidently His unity and oneness, the means of 
the divine perfections; and through unity and oneness all beings become like 
soldiers under orders and subservient ofﬁcials; and with the coming of the 
hereafter, perfections are saved from decline, absolute justice from mocking 
cruelty, universal wisdom from foolish absurdity, all-embracing mercy from 
jeering torment, and the dignity of power from abased impotence, and they 
are exonerated from this.

Certainly and without any doubt, as necessitated by the truths in these 
six ‘sinces’ – eight out of hundreds of points of belief in Allah – the end of 
the world shall come and the resurrection of the dead shall occur. Abodes of 
reward and punishment shall be thrown open so that the above-mentioned 
importance of the earth, and its centrality, and man’s importance and value 
shall be realized, and the above-mentioned justice, wisdom, mercy, and sov-
ereignty of the All-Wise Disposer, Who is the Creator of the earth and of 
man,  and  their  Sustainer,  shall  be  established;  and  the  true  and  yearning 
friends of that eternal Sustainer shall be saved from eternal annihilation; and 
the most eminent and worthy of those friends receive the recompense for his 
sacred services, which have made all beings pleased and indebted; and the 
perfections of the Eternal Sovereign be exempted and exonerated from all 
fault and deﬁciency, and His power from impotence, and His wisdom from 
foolishness, and His justice from tyranny.

In Short: Since Allah exists, so does the hereafter certainly exist.
Moreover, just as with all the evidences that prove them, the above three 
pillars  of  belief  testify  to  and  indicate  resurrection;  so  do  the  two  pillars

testify in powerful fashion to the eternal realm. It is like this: 

ِرَ(cid:130)َو ِهِرْ(cid:193)َ(cid:114) ِرَدَ(cid:163)ْ(cid:170)اِ(cid:92)َو ِهِ(cid:99)ﯬﯧِ(cid:87)ٰ(cid:171) َ(cid:175)ـِ(cid:92)َو also necessitate resurrection and 

All the evidences proving the existence of the angels and their duties 
of worship, and innumerable observations of them and conversations with 
them,  prove  indirectly  the  existence  of  the  Spirit  World,  and  the  World 
of the Unseen, and the eternal realm and world of the hereafter, and the 
existence  of  an  abode  of  happiness  and  Paradise  and  Hell,  which  in  the 
future shall be populated with men and jinn. For with divine permission, 
the angels can see these worlds and enter them. And all the angels clos-
est to Allah who meet with humans, like Gabriel, tell unanimously of the 
existence of these worlds and of their travelling round them. Just as we are 
certain, due to the information of those coming from there, that the conti-
nent  of America exists, although we have not seen it, so due to informa-
tion given by the angels, which has the strength of a hundredfold consen-
sus, we should believe in the existence of the world of eternity, the realm 
of the hereafter, and Paradise and Hell with the same certainty. And thus 
we do believe in it.

Furthermore,  all  the  evidences  proving  the  pillar  of  “ belief  in  divine 
determining, ” included in the Treatise on Divine Determining, the Twenty-
Sixth Word, prove indirectly the resurrection of the dead, the balancing of 
deeds on the supreme scales, and the publishing of the pages of deeds. For 
the recording before our eyes of the appointed courses of all things on the 
tablets of order and balance, and the inscribing of the life stories of all liv-
ing beings in their faculties of memory and seeds and in other tablets in 
the World of Similitudes, and the transcribing of the notebooks of deeds of 
all beings with spirits, and especially men, on the Preserved Tablet, such 
a comprehensive determining and wise apportioning and precise record-
ing and preserving inscription could surely only be the result of a general 
judgement in a supreme tribunal set up to mete out permanent reward and 
punishment. That comprehensive and precise recording and preservation 
would otherwise be completely meaningless and purposeless, and contrary 
to wisdom and reality.

Also, if there were no resurrection, all the certain meanings of the book 
of the universe, written with the pen of divine determining, would be nul-
liﬁed,  which  is  completely  impossible.  It  is  as  impossible  as  denying  the 
universe’s existence, indeed, is a delirium.

In Short: The ﬁve pillars of belief prove and demand with all their evi-
dences  the  occurrence  of  the  resurrection  and  Last  Judgement,  and  their 
existence, and the existence and opening up of the realm of the hereafter, 
and they testify to these and necessitate them. 

Thus,  it  is  because  there  are  such  vast  and  unshakeable  supports  and 
proofs of the resurrection, completely in conformity with its vastness, that 
almost one third of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition is formed by resur-
rection and the hereafter, and it makes it the basis and foundation stone of all 
its truths, and constructs everything on it.

tion miraculously indicated in the following verse:

( 30:17-19 ) K J I H G F E
The manifest proof and brilliant evidence of Allah’s decree concerning 
resurrection  contained  in  this  verse  will  now  be  expounded  and  set  forth, 
Allah willing.1

In  connection  with  the  twenty-eighth  property  of  life  it  was  explained 
that  life  looks  upon  the  six  pillars  of  faith  and  proves  them;  it  contains  a 
series of indications of their truth.

Now the most important result, substance and reason for the creation of 
the cosmos is none other than life, and life, that exalted verity, can in no 
way be restricted to this transient, brief, defective and painful worldly life. 
Rather the purpose and result of the tree of life, the splendour of which can 
be deduced from its twenty-nine properties, the fruit of that tree worthy 
of its splendour, is the eternal life of the hereafter; it is life in the eternal 
realm  where  even  stones,  trees  and  the  soil  will  be  endowed  with  life. 
Otherwise, it will follow that the tree of life, so plentifully decked out with 
signiﬁcant instruments, yields no fruit, beneﬁt or truth for animate beings, 
especially man; and man who in his substance and faculties is twenty times 
superior to the sparrow and is indeed the most important and elevated of 
all creation, will fall to a degree twenty times lower than that of the spar-
row; with respect to the felicity of his life, he will be the most unfortunate 
and humiliated of wretches.

1.  The whole station has not yet been written and has been included here because of 
the relevance of the topic of life to resurrection. In addition, it contains a subtle and pro-
found allusion to the pillar of divine determining at the end of the topic of life.

THE WORDS

Similarly, intelligence, the most precious of gifts for man, will wound his 
heart through constant reﬂection of the pains of the past and the fears of  the 
future; it will mix nine pains with every pleasure and thus become a disaster 
to man. Now this is false to the hundredth degree. The life of this world thus 
proves decisively the pillar of faith that is belief in the hereafter and displays 
to  our  eyes  every  spring  more  than  three  hundred  thousand  specimens  of 
resurrection.

Is it at all possible that an All-Powerful Agent Who promptly supplies 
and provides, with wisdom, solicitude and mercy, all the instruments and 
tools needed for your life, in your body, your garden and your homeland, 
Who  hears  and  answers  the  private  and  particular  prayer  made  for  suste-
nance by your stomach, for the sake of its life and survival, Who shows His 
acceptance of that prayer by means of numerous delicious foods – is it at all 
possible that such a Being should not be aware of you or hear you, that He 
should not provide you with the means of life eternal, the greatest purpose of 
the human species? Is it possible that He should not accept the greatest, most 
signiﬁcant, most worthy and most universal prayer for eternity of the human 
species by establishing eternal life and creating Paradise? Is it possible that 
He should not heed the universal and insistent prayer of the human species, 
the most important creature in the cosmos, the monarch of the earth, a prayer 
that resounds throughout heaven and earth, and not pay it the same attention, 
or grant it the same gratiﬁcation, as a little stomach? Is it possible that He 
should thus cause His perfect wisdom and inﬁnite mercy to be denied? No, 
a hundred thousand times no!

Again, is it at all possible that He should hear the most secret voice of 
the most minute of beings, remedy its pain and succour its plaint; that He 
should nourish it with the utmost care and consideration and cause crea-
tures greater than itself to serve it – is it at all possible that He should do all 
of this and not hear the thunderous cry of life, the greatest, most precious, 
most eternal and most delicate form of life? That He should pay no heed to 
its powerful prayer and supplications for eternity? It would be like equip-
ping a single soldier with the utmost care and totally ignoring a vast and 
obedient army! Like seeing a speck and overlooking the sun! Like hearing 
the buzz of a ﬂy and not hearing the roar of the thunder! No, a hundred 
thousand times no!

Again,  can  the  intelligence  at  all  accept  that  an  All-Powerful  and  All-
Wise Being, Whose mercy, love and solicitude are inﬁnite, Who loves His 

TENTH WORD – SECOND ADDENDUM

131

own artistry, Who causes Himself to be loved, and Who greatly loves those 
that love Him – can it accept that such a Being would annihilate through 
permanent death a life that loves Him greatly, that is itself lovable and that 
instinctively worships its Maker; and, the essence and jewel of that life, the 
spirit? That He would offend and insult His lover and  beloved for all eter-
nity, that He would injure his feelings and deny Himself, and cause others 
to deny, the mystery of His mercy and the light of His love? No, a hundred 
thousand times no! An absolute beauty that adorns creation with its mani-
festation and the absolute mercy that makes all creatures rejoice are without 
doubt exempt and puriﬁed from such inﬁnite ugliness, such utter abomina-
tion and pitilessness.

The  result,  then,  is  that  considering  the  existence  of  life,  those  men 
who understand the purpose of life and who do not misuse their lives will 
become manifestations of eternal life in the realm of eternity and eternal 
Paradise. In this we believe. So, too, the shining of brilliant objects found 
on the earth through the reﬂection of sunlight, the brief glinting on the sur-
face of the ocean of little bubbles through ﬂashes of light, and the coming 
in their place of further bubbles that like them hold up a mirror to a whole 
series of imaginary suns – this demonstrates tangibly that those ﬂashes are 
the reﬂectory manifestation of the one supreme sun. With their manifold 
tongues, they make mention of that one sun and they point toward it with 
their luminous ﬁngers.

So,  too,  the  fashion  in  which,  through  the  supreme  manifestation  of 
the  name  Giver  of  Life  of  the  Living  and  Self-Subsistent  Being,  all  the 
animate beings on the face of the earth and in the depths of the sea shine 
through Allah’s power, and then disappear behind the veil of the unseen, 
saying, “ O Eternally Living One! ”, in order to make room for those that 
follow them – this represents a series of testimonies to and indications of 
the  life  and  necessary  existence  of  the  Eternally  Ever-Living  and  Self-
Subsistent Being.

Similarly, all the proofs that bear witness to divine knowledge the traces 
of which are visible in the ordering of all beings; all the evidences that estab-
lish the existence of a power working its will throughout creation; all the 
arguments that point to a volition and purposefulness dominating the order-
ing and administering of the cosmos; all the signs and miracles that attest 
the  messengerhood  of  the  prophets,  the  means  of  dominical  speech  and 
divine revelation, and the indications bearing witness to the seven attributes 

132

THE WORDS

of Divinity – all of them point to, testify to, and indicate unanimously the 
life of the Living and Self-Subsistent Being. For if the faculty of vision is 
present in a thing, there must also be life. If there is hearing, this too is a sign 
of life. If there is speech, this also points to the existence of life. If there are 
will and choice, this indicates life.

Similarly,  attributes  the  existence  of  which  is  proven  and  self-evident 
by virtue of their traces throughout the cosmos, attributes such as absolute 
power,  all-embracing  will,  and  comprehensive  knowledge,  bear  witness 
with all of their proofs to the life and necessary existence of the Living and  
Self-Subsistent Being. They attest His everlasting life, one shadow of which 
is  enough  to  illumine  the  whole  of  the  cosmos,  and  one  manifestation  of 
which sufﬁces to give life to the hereafter, together with all of its particles.

The divine attribute of life is also connected with the pillar of belief in 
the angels, and proves it by way of indication. For the most important of all 
goals  of  the  cosmos  is  life,  and  animate  beings  constitute  the  most  wide-
spread form of creation, with its specimens multiplied on account of their 
value;  they  constantly  animate  the  hospice  of  this  world  with  the  coming 
and going of their caravans. Further, the globe, which is ﬁlled with so many 
species of animate beings, is being constantly emptied and reﬁlled as these 
various species are renewed and multiplied, and animate beings are created 
in multiplicity even in the vilest and most corrupt substances, so that there 
is – as it were – a constant resurrection of microbes. Finally, consciousness 
and  intellect,  which  are  the  distilled  essence  of  life,  and  the  spirit,  which 
is its subtle and stable substance, are also created everywhere on the globe 
in  the  utmost  multiplicity,  so  that  it  is  as  if  the  globe  were  animated  and 
caused to rejoice by life, intellect, consciousness and spirit. If we take into 
consideration all of the foregoing, it is totally impossible that the heavenly 
bodies, which are subtler, more luminous, greater and more signiﬁcant than 
the globe, should be dead, rigid, lifeless, and dumb.

There must, then, exist and be provided with the property of life, con-
scious  and  animate  beings  that  animate  the  skies,  the  suns,  and  the  stars, 
bestow upon them their vitality, manifest the result of the purpose for the 
creation  of  the  heavens,  and  receive  address  from  the  Glorious  Creator. 
These creatures, of a nature suited to the heavens, are none other than the 
angels.

Similarly, the innermost essence of life symbolically proves the pillar of 
belief in the prophets. For the cosmos was created for the sake of life, and 

TENTH WORD – SECOND ADDENDUM

133

life is in turn one of the supreme manifestations of the Living, Self-Subsist-
ent and Eternal One. It is one of His most perfect designs, one of His most 
beauteous arts. Further, the eternal life of Allah shows itself only through the 
sending of messengers and the revelation of books. If there were no books or 
prophets, then eternal life would remain unknown. When a man speaks, he is 
recognized to be alive. Similarly, it is the prophets and revealed books that 
make manifest the words and decrees of the Being Who, from behind the 
World of the Unseen that is veiled by the cosmos, speaks, talks, and emits 
His commands and prohibitions. Just as the life existent in the cosmos bears 
decisive witness to the necessary existence of the Living and Eternal One, so 
too does it point to and indirectly conﬁrm the pillars of belief in the sending 
of messengers and the revelation of  scriptures, for these are the rays, the 
manifestations, and the relations of that eternal life. And especially the mes-
sengership of Muhammad – Upon whom be blessings and peace – and the 
Qur’anic revelation, since they are like the very spirit and intellect of life, 
their veracity is as indisputable as the existence of this life.

Life  is,  then,  the  distilled  essence  of  the  cosmos;  consciousness  and 
feeling are the distilled essence of life; the intellect is the distilled essence 
of consciousness and feeling; and the spirit, ﬁnally, is the pure and unsul-
lied substance, the stable and autonomous essence, that lies at the heart of 
life. So, too, the life of the Prophet Muhammad – Upon whom be bless-
ings  and  peace  –  in  both  its  outer  and  its  inner  aspects  is  the  distilled 
quintessence of life and the spirit of the cosmos, and the messengership of 
Muhammad – Upon whom be blessings and peace – is the pure and dis-
tilled essence of the feeling, the consciousness and the intellect of the cos-
mos. Rather, the life of the Prophet Muhammad – Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace – in its outer and inner aspects is, as his works have borne 
witness, the very essence of the life of the cosmos, and the prophethood of 
Muhammad – Upon whom be blessings and peace – is the very light and 
essence of the consciousness of the cosmos. The Qur’anic revelation, as its 
living truths testify, is also the spirit of the cosmos’ life and the intellect 
of its consciousness.

If the light of the messengership of Muhammad – Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace – were to depart from the cosmos and vanish, the cosmos 
would die. If the Qur’an were to depart, the cosmos would lose its sanity, 
and the globe would lose its sense and its head. Its dizzy, uncomprehending 
head would collide with a planet, and the end of the world would result.

134

THE WORDS

Life also looks to the pillar of belief in divine determining, and proves 
it indirectly. Because, since life is the light of the Manifest World, and it 
dominates it, and is the result and aim of existence, and since it is the most 
comprehensive mirror of the Creator of the universe and the most perfect 
sample and index of dominical activity, and – let there be no mistake in the 
comparison – is like a sort of programme, for sure, the mystery of life neces-
sitates that the creatures in the World of the Unseen, that is, the past and the 
future, that is, that have been and will come, are predisposed to conform to 
order, regularity, being known and observed, speciﬁc individual existence, 
and the creative commands, which are their lives in one respect.

The original seed of a tree and its root, as well as the seeds contained in its 
fruit and ﬁnal outcome, all manifest a sort of life, no less than the tree itself; 
indeed, they bear within themselves laws of life more subtle than those of 
the tree. Similarly, the seeds and roots left by last autumn, before  the present 
spring, as well as the seeds and roots that will be left to subsequent springs 
after this spring has departed – they all bear the manifestations of life, just 
like this spring, and are subject to the laws of life. In just the same way, all 
the branches and twigs of the cosmic tree each have a past and a future. They 
have  a  chain  consisting  of  past  and  future  stages  and  circumstances.  The 
multiple existences and stages of each species and each member of each spe-
cies, existing in divine knowledge, forms a chain of being in Allah’s knowl-
edge, and both its external existence, and its existence in Allah’s knowledge, 
is a manifestation of universal life that draws all the aspects of its life from 
these meaningful and vital tablets of divine determining.

The fact that the World of Spirits – which is one form of the World of the 
Unseen – is full of the essence of life, the matter of life and the spirits, which 
are the substances and essence of life, demands and requires of a certainty 
that past and future – which are another form of the World of the Unseen and 
its second segment – should also receive the manifestation of life.

In  addition,  the  perfect  order,  the  meaningful  circumstances  and  vital 
fruits and stages inherent in the existence of a thing within Allah’s knowl-
edge, also demonstrate the manifestation of a sort of life. Such a manifesta-
tion of life, which is the light emitted by the sun of eternal life, cannot be 
limited to this Manifest World, this present time, this external existence. On 
the contrary, each world receives the manifestation of that light in accord-
ance with its capacity, and the cosmos together with all its worlds is alive 
and illumined through it. Otherwise, as the misguided imagine, beneath a 

TENTH WORD – SECOND ADDENDUM

135

temporary and apparent life, each world would be a vast and terrible corpse, 
a dark ruin.

One broad aspect of the pillar of belief in divine determining and decree 
is, then, understood through the mystery of life and is established by it. Just 
as the life and vitality of the Manifest World and existent, visible objects 
becomes apparent from their orderliness and the consequences of their exist-
ence, so too past and future creatures – regarded as belonging to the World 
of the Unseen – have an immaterial existence and sort of life, and a spir-
itual presence in Allah’s knowledge. The trace of this life and presence is 
made manifest and known by means of the Tablet of Divine Determining 
and Decree and through all the stages and circumstances of their external 
lives and existences.

Third Part
of the Addendum

A question related to the resurrection of the dead:

The  frequently  repeated  verse,  ( 36:29 )  4 3 2 1 0    and  the 
verse,  ( 16:77 )  ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ £    show  that  the  resurrection 
of the dead and Great Gathering will occur instantaneously, in a ﬂash. But 
man’s narrow reason requires some tangible example so that it can conceive 
of this wondrous, extraordinary, and unparalleled event, and accept it.

T h e   A n s w e r : At the resurrection there will be the return of spirits to their 
bodies, the reviviﬁcation of the bodies, and the remaking of the bodies. It 
consists of three matters.

First Matter

FIRST MATTER: An example for the return of spirits to their bodies 
is the mustering, at a loud bugle call, of the members of a well-disciplined 
army after they have dispersed to rest. Yes, the Sur of the Angel Israﬁl is 
no less powerful than an army bugle. The spirits, too, who, while in post-
eternity and the realm of atoms, reply with  ( 7:172 ) F E  to the question 
( 7:172 ) C B which comes from pre-eternity, are inﬁnitely more sub-
jugated, disciplined, and obedient than the soldiers of an army. The Thirtieth 
Word  has  demonstrated  with  decisive  proofs  that  not  only  spirits,  but  all 
particles, form a divine army and are its soldiers under command.

Second Matter

SECOND MATTER: An example for the reviviﬁcation of bodies is the 
springing  to  life  in  an  instant  of  the  hundred  thousand  electric  lights  of  a 
large city on a festival night, switched on from one centre. It would be pos-
sible to light up in the same way a hundred million lamps scattered over the 
face  of  the  earth  from  one  centre.  Since  through  the  training  and  instruc-
tion  in  regularity  and  order  it  has  received  from  its  Creator,  a  creature  of 
Almighty Allah like electricity – a servant and candleholder in His guest-
house – possesses this quality, surely the resurrection of the dead could occur 
in the twinkling of an eye within the bounds of the regular laws of divine 
wisdom,  which  thousands  of  luminous  servants  represent,  like  electricity.

Third Matter

136

TENTH WORD – THIRD ADDENDUM

137

THIRD MATTER: An example for the remaking of bodies instanta-
neously is the perfect remaking within a few days of all the trees in the 
spring, which are far more numerous than all humanity, together with all  
their leaves, in exactly the same way as those of the previous spring; and 
the bringing into being, again like those of previous springs, all the blos-
soms,  fruits  and  leaves  of  the  trees  with  the  speed  of  lightning;  and  the 
sudden awakening of the uncountable numbers of seeds, grains, and roots, 
which are the source of the spring, and their unfolding and being raised to 
life; and reﬂecting the meaning of “ resurrection after death, ” the sudden 
raising to life at a command of the upright skeletal corpses of the trees; and 
the reanimation in extremely artful fashion of the innumerable members of 
all species of small animals; and the reviviﬁcation of all the sorts of ﬂying 
insects,  particularly  those  which,  continually  cleaning  their  faces,  eyes, 
and wings, remind us of our ablutions and cleanliness, and caress our faces 
– the resurrection and remaking of all the members of this tribe within a 
few days every spring before our very eyes together with all the other spe-
cies, despite being greater in number than all mankind since the time of 
Adam, provides not one example of the remaking of all human bodies at 
the resurrection, but thousands.

Yes,  since  this  world  is  the  realm  of  wisdom  and  the  hereafter  is  the 
realm of power, numerous divine names like All-Wise, Arranger, Disposer, 
and Nurturer, and dominical wisdom, require that the creation of things in 
this world is gradual and in the course of time. In the hereafter, however, 
power  and  mercy  will  be  manifested  more  than  wisdom,  and  there  being 
no need for matter, time, and waiting, things will be made instantaneously. 
Alluding to the fact that things which are made here in a day or in a year will 
be made in the hereafter in an instant or a ﬂash, the Qur’an of Miraculous 
Exposition states:  ( 16:77 ) ¬« ª © ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ £

If you want to be as certain about the occurrence of the resurrection of the 
dead as you are about the arrival of next spring, study the Tenth and Twenty-
Ninth Words carefully, which are about this, and you will see! If you do not 
then believe that it will occur as you believe the coming of spring, come and 
stick your ﬁnger in my eye!

Fourth Matter

A  FOURTH  MATTER:  The  death  of  the  world  and  Doomsday.  The 
sudden collision with this globe, our guesthouse, at a dominical command, 
of a planet or comet, could wipe out this dwelling-place of ours. Like the 
destruction in a minute of a palace the building of which had taken ten years.

As was illustrated in the third comparison in the Ninth Truth of the Tenth 
Word, some personage may one day summon together before your eyes a 
great  army.  If  someone  were  then  to  say,  “ that  personage  is  able  to  call 
together the troops in his army, who had dispersed to take rest, and assemble 
them  again  in  battalions, ”  and  you  were  to  say,  “ I  don’t  believe  it, ”  you 
know well how lunatic would be your denial. So too, an All-Powerful and 
All-Knowing  Being  Who  out  of  nothing  recorded  and  put  in  place,  with 

the command of, ( 36:82 ) ² ± all the particles and subtle aspects of the 
bodies  of  all  animals  and  other  animate  beings,  as  if  they  were  an  army 
with  the  utmost  orderliness  and  wise  equilibrium,  and  Who  creates  each 
century, or rather each spring, the hundreds of thousands of different species 
and groups of animate beings that populate the face of the earth, each like 
an army – such a Being can gather together, with one blow on the trump 
of Israﬁl, all the fundamental particles and original components that enjoy 
mutual acquaintance through joint submission to the order of the body that 
corresponds to a battalion. Were you to say, “ how can this be? ” or consider 
it unlikely, it would be idiotic lunacy.

It  sometimes  happens  in  the  Qur’an  that,  in  order  to  impress  upon  the 
heart the wondrous deeds He will perform in the hereafter and to prepare 
the mind for acceptance of them, Allah Almighty mentions the wondrous 
deeds He performs in this world as a kind of preparation. Alternatively, He 
may sometimes mention the wondrous deeds He will perform in the future 
and the hereafter in such a fashion that we are convinced of them by analogy 
with the similar deeds we observe in this world. One example is furnished 
by the verse,

( 36:77 ) b a ` _ ^ ] \ [ Z Y X

138

TENTH WORD – FOURTH ADDENDUM

139

and the remaining verses of the same sura. The All-Wise Qur’an thus proves 
the  question  of  resurrection  in  a  different  way  in  seven  or  eight  different 
forms.

It ﬁrst directs man’s attention to his own origins. It says “ you see how 
you advanced from a drop of sperm to a drop of blood, from a drop of blood 
to  a  formless  lump  of  ﬂesh,  and  from  a  formless  lump  of  ﬂesh  to  human 
form. How, then, can you deny your second creation? It is just the same as 
the ﬁrst, or even easier of accomplishment for Allah. ” Allah Almighty also 
refers to the great bounties He has bestowed on man with phrases such as:

( 36:80 ) ¤ £ ¢ ¡ ﮯ ~ }
and  says  to  man:  “ Will  the  Being  Who  thus  bestowed  bounty  upon  you 
leave you to your own devices, in such fashion that you enter the grave to 
sleep without rising again? ” He also hints at the following: “ You see how 
dead trees come to life and grow green again. Refusing to regard as a paral-
lel the reanimation of your bones, that resemble dry wood, you dismiss the 
whole matter as improbable. Now is it at all possible that the One Who cre-
ates the heavens and earth should not be empowered over the life and death 
of man, the fruit of heaven and earth? Do you imagine that He would make 
fruitless and vain the tree of creation that He has moulded with wisdom in 
all its parts, by abandoning the supreme result of that tree? ”

The Qur’an says further: “ The Being That will restore you to life at res-
urrection is such that the whole cosmos is like an obedient soldier of His. It 
bows its head submissively whenever it hears the command,

² ±
To create a spring is easier for Him than the creation of a ﬂower. To create 
the whole of the animal realm is as easy for His power as creating a ﬂy. None 
may belittlingly challenge His power by saying to Him:

Then, from the verse,

( 36:78 )m l k  

( 36:83 ) Ì Ë Ê É È Ç 
we see that the reins of all things are in His hand, the key to all things is in 
His possession; He rotates night and day, winter and summer, with as much 
ease as if He were turning the pages of a book. He is an All-Powerful, Glori-
ous Being Who closes the door on this world and opens it on the hereafter 

140

THE WORDS

as if they were two stations. This being the case, as the result of the men-
tioned evidences, ( 10:56 ) Î Í  that is, He will bring you back to life 
from your graves, take you to the plain of resurrection, and judge you in His 
majestic presence.

Now these verses prepare the mind and make ready the heart to accept 
the reality of resurrection, for they have demonstrated parallels to resurrec-
tion in worldly processes. Sometimes it also happens that He mentions the 
deeds He will perform in the hereafter in such a way as to draw attention to 
their worldly parallels, so that no room should be left for doubt and denial. 
Examples are the suras introduced by these verses:
( 84:1 ) ... . - ,     ( 82:1 ) ... # " !     ( 81:1 ) ... # " !
In these suras, Allah Almighty mentions resurrection and the vast revolu-
tions and dominical deeds that shall take place at that time, in such a fash-
ion  that  man  thinks  of  their  worldly  parallels  that  he  has  seen  in  autumn 
and spring, and then, with awe in his heart, easily accepts what the intellect 
would otherwise refuse. Even to indicate the general meaning of the three 
suras  just  mentioned  would  take  very  long.  Let  us,  then,  take  simply  one 
word as a specimen of the whole. With the words,
( 81:10 ) G F E
Allah  Almighty  expresses  the  following:  “ Upon  resurrection,  everyone’s 
deeds will be revealed on a written page. This appears to be very strange, 
and totally beyond the reach of reason. But as the sura indicates, just as the 
resurrection of the spring is a parallel to other matters, so too the ‘spreading 
out of pages’ has a very clear parallel. Every fruit-bearing tree, every ﬂow-
ering plant has its deeds, actions and functions. It performs a certain kind 
of worship, depending on the fashion in which it gloriﬁes Allah through the 
manifestations of His names. Now all of its deeds and the record of its life 
are inscribed in all the seeds that are to emerge next spring in another plot of 
soil. With the tongue of shape and form, the seeds make eloquent mention 
of the origins of those deeds, and spread out the page of deeds together with 
branch, twig, leaf, ﬂower and fruit. He Who says:  ( 81:10 ) G F E 
is  the  same  Being  that  performs,  before  our  eyes,  these  wise,  preserving, 
nurturing and subtle acts.

Compare  other  matters  with  this  by  analogy,  and  deduce  the  truth 
if  you  have  the  capacity.  Let  us  aid  you  with  the  following.  The  verse, 
# " !  refers to a brilliant similitude and hints at its parallel:

TENTH WORD – FOURTH ADDENDUM

141

F i r s t :  Allah Almighty has cast aside the curtains of non-being, the ether 
and the heavens to bring forth from His treasury of mercy and show to the 
world a jewel-like lamp illumining the world – the sun. After closing the 
world, He will wrap that jewel again in its veils and remove it.

S e c o n d :  The sun may be depicted as an ofﬁcial entrusted with the task  of 
distributing the commodity of light over the globe, and causing it and dark-
ness to succeed each other. Every evening the ofﬁcial is ordered to gather

when he is hidden by the veil of a cloud. At other times it may be that the 
moon will also form a veil, and hinder his task. Now just as that ofﬁcial has 
his goods and ledgers gathered up for inspection, so too he will one day be 
relieved of his duties. Even if there be no cause for his dismissal, there are 
two dark spots on the sun – now small, but liable to grow – that one day will 
grow to the point that the sun will take back at the dominical command the 
light it now wraps around the head of the earth with divine permission, and 
wrap it around its own head. It will then be told: “ Come, your task on earth 
is now complete. Go to Hell, and burn there those who have worshipped you 
and thus mocked with faithlessness an obedient servant like you. ” With its 
own dark and scarred face, it will read out the decree, G F E

of the Addendum

The hundred and twenty-four thousand prophets, 1 who are according to 
explicit prophetic tradition the choice part of humanity, have unanimously 
and with one accord reported, partly on the basis of direct vision and partly 
on the basis of absolute certainty, that the hereafter exists and that all human 
beings  will  be  taken  to  the  hereafter  as  the  universe’s  Creator  has  ﬁrmly 
promised.

Similarly, the one hundred and twenty-four million saints who conﬁrm 
the reports of the prophets through unveiling and witnessing, give testimony 
to the existence of the hereafter in the form of certain knowledge. 

And all the names of the cosmos’ All-Wise Maker also necessitate the 
existence of an eternal realm through the manifestations they display in this 
world.

The  existence  of  the  hereafter  is  furthermore  necessitated  by  the  inﬁ-
nite  pre-eternal  power,  the  unlimited  and  exact  everlasting  wisdom,  that 
revives  every  spring  the  countless  dead  trees  scattered  all  over  the  earth 
with  the  command  of ² ±  ,  thus  making  of  them  manifestations  of 
ِتْو َ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)ا َدْ(cid:151)َ(cid:92)  ُثْ(cid:151)َ(cid:92) and that resurrects three hundred thousand different species 
of the various groups of plant and nations of animals, as hundreds of thou-
sands of specimens of the supreme resurrection.

The  existence  of  the  hereafter  is  also  necessitated  by  the  everlasting 
mercy and permanent grace that sustains in wondrous and solicitous fash-
ion all animate beings that stand in need of nurture, and that display each 
spring,  in  the  briefest  of  periods,  inﬁnite  different  varieties  of  adornment 
and beauty. 

Finally,  there  is  the  self-evident  proof  and  indication  given  by  the 
intense, unshakeable, and permanent love of eternity, yearning for immor-
tality and hope of permanence that are lodged in man, the most beloved

creation of the Maker of the cosmos, and whose concern with all the beings 
in the cosmos is the greatest.

All of the foregoing so ﬁrmly prove that after this transient world there  
will be an eternal world, a hereafter, a realm of felicity, that we are com-
pelled to accept the existence of a hereafter as indisputably as we accept the 
existence of this world. 1

One of the most important lessons taught us by the All-Wise Qur’an, is, 
then, belief in the hereafter. This belief is so ﬁrm and contains within itself 
so powerful a hope and a consolation that if a person be assailed by old age a 
hundred thousandfold, the consolation derived from this belief will be fully

1.  It can be realized from this comparison how easy it is to make a positive afﬁrma-
tion and how difﬁcult to make a denial and negation. If, for example, someone should say, 
“ there exists somewhere on this earth a wondrous garden containing canned milk, ” and 
someone else should say, “ there is not, ” the afﬁrmer need only point to the place of that 
garden or show some of its fruits in order to prove his claim. The denier, by contrast, will 
have to inspect and display the whole world in order to justify his negation. So too the 
testimony of two veracious witnesses will be enough to establish the existence of Paradise, 
quite apart from the hundreds of thousands of traces, fruits and indications demonstrated 
by those who assert its existence. Those who deny it must examine, explore and sift the 
inﬁnite cosmos and inﬁnite time before they can prove their denial and demonstrate the 
non-existence of Paradise. So, o aged brothers of mine, understand how ﬁrm is belief in 
the hereafter.

Brother!  If  you  want  to  understand  a  little  about  the  talisman  of  the 
world’s purpose and the riddle of man’s creation and the mystery of the real-
ity of the prescribed prayers, then consider this short comparison together 
with my own soul.

One time there was a king. As wealth he possessed numerous treasuries 
containing diamonds and emeralds and jewels of every kind. Besides these 
he  had  other,  hidden,  wondrous  treasuries.  By  way  of  attainment  he  had 
consummate skill in strange arts, and encompassing knowledge of innumer-
able wondrous sciences, and great erudition in endless branches of abstruse 
learning. Now, like every possessor of beauty and perfection wants to see 
and display his own beauty and perfection, that glorious king wanted to open 
up  an  exhibition  and  set  out  displays  within  it  in  order  to  make  manifest 
and display in the view of the people the majesty of his rule, his glittering 
wealth, the wonders of his art, and the marvels of his knowledge, and so that 
he could behold his beauty and perfection in two respects:

T h e   F i r s t   R e s p e c t :  so that he himself could behold his beauty and perfec-

tion with his own discerning eye.

T h e   O t h e r :  so that he could look through the view of others.
With  this  purpose  in  mind,  the  king  started  to  construct  a  vast  and 
majestic palace. He divided it into magniﬁcent apartments and dwellings, 
and decorated it with every sort of jewel from his treasuries, and with his 
own hand so full of art adorned it with the ﬁnest and most beautiful works. 

144

ELEVENTH WORD 

145

He ordered it with the subtlest of the arts of his wisdom, and decked it out  
with the miraculous works of his knowledge. Then after completing it, he 
set up in the palace broad tables containing the most delicious of every kind 
of food and every sort of bounty. He speciﬁed an appropriate table for each 
group. He set out such a muniﬁcent and artful banquet it was as though the 
boundless priceless bounties he spread out had come into existence through 
the works of a hundred subtle arts. Then he invited his people and subjects 
from all the regions of his lands to feast and to behold the spectacle.

Later the king appointed a supreme commander as teacher, to make known 
the purposes of the palace and the meanings of its contents; to describe its 
maker and its contents to the people, make known the secrets of the palace’s 
embellishments, teach what the arts within it were pointing to, and to explain 
what the well-set jewels were, and the harmonious embroideries; to explain 
to those who entered the palace the way in which they indicated the perfec-
tions and arts of the palace’s owner; to inform them of the correct conduct in 
beholding them; and to explain the ofﬁcial ceremonies as the king, who did 
not appear, wished them to be. The teacher and instructor had an assistant in 
each area of the palace, while he himself remained in the largest apartment 
among his students, making the following announcement to all the specta-
tors. He told them:

“ O people! By making this palace and displaying these things our lord, 
who is the king of the palace, wants to make himself known to you. You 
therefore should recognize him and try to get to know him. And with these 
adornments he wants to make himself loved by you. You, too, make your-
self  loved  by  him  by  appreciating  his  art  and  admiring  his  works.  Also, 
he  shows  his  love  for  you  through  these  bounties  that  you  see,  so  you 
should love him too by obeying him. And through these bounties and gifts 
which are to be seen he shows his compassion and kindness for you, so 
you  should  show  your  respect  for  him  by  offering  thanks.  And  through 
these works of his perfection he wants to display his transcendent beauty 
to you, so you should show your eagerness to see him and gain his regard. 
And through placing a particular stamp and special seal and an inimitable 
signet on every one of these adorned works of art that you see, he wants 
to show that everything is particular to him, and is the work of his own 
hand, and that he is single and unique and independent and removed. You 
therefore should recognize that he is single and alone and without peer or 
like or match, and accept that he is such. ” He spoke further ﬁtting words 

146

THE WORDS

to the spectators like these concerning the king and this station. Then the 
people who had entered the palace separated into two groups.

T h e   F i r s t   G r o u p :  Since these people had self-knowledge, were intel-
ligent,  and  their  hearts  were  in  the  right  place,  when  they  looked  at  the 
wonders inside the palace, they declared: “ There are great matters afoot 
here! ” They understood that it was not in vain or some triﬂing plaything. 
They were curious, and while wondering: “ I wonder what the talisman to 
this is and what it contains, ” they suddenly heard the speech the master 
and instructor was giving, and they realized that the keys to all the myster-
ies were with him. So they approached him and said: “ Peace be upon you, 
O master! By rights, a truthful and exact instructor like you is necessary 
for a magniﬁcent palace such as this. Please tell us what our lord has made 
known to you! ” First of all the master repeated the speech to them. They 
listened carefully, and accepting it, proﬁted greatly. They acted as the king 
wished. And because the king was pleased at their becoming conduct and 
manners,  he  invited  them  to  another  special,  elevated,  ineffable  palace. 
And he bestowed it on them in a way worthy of such a muniﬁcent king, 
and ﬁtting for such obedient subjects, and suitable for such well-mannered 
guests, and appropriate to such an elevated palace. He made them perma-
nently happy.

A s   f o r   t h e   S e c o n d   G r o u p , because their minds were corrupted and their 
hearts  extinguished,  when  they  entered  the  palace,  they  were  defeated  by 
their evil-commanding souls and took notice of nothing apart from the deli-
cious foods; they closed their eyes to all the virtues and stopped up their ears 
to the guidance of the master and the warnings of his students. They stuffed 
themselves like animals then sank into sleep. They quaffed elixirs which had 
been prepared for certain other matters and were not to have been consumed. 
Then they became drunk and started shouting so much they greatly upset the 
other spectating guests. They were ill-mannered in the face of the glorious 
maker’s rules. So the soldiers of the palace’s owner arrested them, and cast 
them into a prison appropriate to such unmannerly people.

O friend who is listening to this story with me! Of course you have under-
stood that the glorious ruler built this palace for the above-mentioned aims. 
The achievement of these aims is dependent on two things:

T h e   F i r s t :  The existence of the master whom we saw and whose speech 
we heard. Because if it were not for him, all these aims would be in vain. For 
if an incomprehensible book has no teacher, it consists only of meaningless 
paper.

ELEVENTH WORD 

147

T h e   S e c o n d   is  the  people  accepting  the  master’s  words  and  heeding 
them. That is to say, the master’s existence is the cause of the palace’s exist-
ence, and the people’s listening to him is the cause of the continuation of 
the palace’s existence. In which case it can be said that if it were not for  the 
master, the glorious king would not have built the palace. And again it may 
be said that when the people do not heed the master’s instructions, the palace 
will of a certainty be transformed and changed.

Friend! The story ends here. If you have understood the meaning of the 

comparison, come and behold the truth of it.

The palace is this world. Its roof is the heavens illuminated with smiling 
stars, and its ﬂoor, the face of the earth adorned from east to west with mul-
tifarious ﬂowers. As for the king, he is the Most Holy One, the Pre-Eternal 
and Post-Eternal Monarch, Whom all things in the seven heavens and the 
earth glorify and extol, each with its particular tongue. He is a king so pow-
erful He created the heavens and earth in six days, then abided on the throne. 
One of Power and Majesty, Who, alternating night and day like two threads, 
one white and one black, writes His signs of the page of the universe; One to 
Whose command the sun, moon, and stars are subjugated. The apartments 
of the palace are the eighteen thousand worlds, each of which has been set 
in order and decorated in a fashion suitable to it. The strange arts you saw 
in the palace are the miracles of divine power you see in this world, and the 
foods you saw there allude to the wonderful fruits of divine mercy in this 
world,  especially  in  summer,  and  above  all  in  the  gardens  of  Barla.  The 
stove and kitchen there is the earth here, which has ﬁre in its heart, and the 
face of the earth. While the jewels of the hidden treasuries you saw in the 
comparison  are  the  similitudes  of  the  manifestations  of  the  sacred  divine 
names. And the embroideries there, and the signs of the embroideries, are 
the well-ordered and ﬁnely worked beings and the harmonious impresses of 
the pen of power which adorn this world and point to the names of the All-
Powerful One of Glory. 

As for the master, he is our Master Muhammad ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ). His assistants are the prophets ( Upon whom be peace ), and 
his students, the saints and puriﬁed scholars. The ruler’s servants in the pal-
ace indicate the angels ( Upon whom be peace ) in this world. And the guests 
invited to the banquet to spectate in the comparison are the jinn and human-
kind in this guesthouse of the world, and the animals, who are the servants of 
humankind. As for the two groups, one of them here consists of the people 
of belief, who are the students of the All-Wise Qur’an, the interpreter of the 

148

THE WORDS

verses and signs of the book of the universe. The other group are the peo-
ple of unbelief and rebellion, who follow Satan and their evil-commanding 
souls; deaf and dumb, like animals, or even lower, they form the group of the 
misguided, who recognize the life of this world only.

The First Group: These are the felicitous and the good, who listened to 
the Master, the Possessor of Two Wings. He is both the worshipping servant 
of Allah; in regard to worship he describes his Sustainer so that he is like the 
envoy of his community at the court of Almighty Allah. He is also Allah’s 
Messenger; with regard to messengership he conveys his Sustainer’s decrees 
to men and the jinn by means of the Qur’an.

This happy community heeded the Messenger and listened to the Qur’an. 
They  saw  themselves  invested  with  the  prescribed  prayers,  which  are  the 
index of all the varieties of worship, and numerous subtle duties within ele-
vated stations. Indeed, they saw in detail the duties and stations which the 
prayers point to with their various formulas and actions. It was like this:

F i r s t l y :  Since they observed the divine works, and in the form of rela-
tions with someone unseen, saw themselves in the station of observing the 
wonders  of  the  sovereignty  of  dominicality,  they  performed  the  duty  of 
extolling and glorifying Allah, declaring: ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ

ّ(cid:195)َا

S e c o n d l y :  Being seen in the station of herald of His brilliant and won-

exclaimed:  ِ

T h i r d l y :  In the station of perceiving and understanding with their inner 
and  outer  senses  the  bounties  stored  up  in  the  treasuries  of  divine  mercy, 
they started to carry out the duty of thanks and praise.

F o u r t h l y :  In the station of weighing up with the scales of their spiritual 
faculties the jewels in the treasuries of the divine names, they began the duty 
of praise and declaring Allah to be free of all fault.

F i f t h l y :  In the station of studying the Sustainer’s missives, written with 
the pen of power on the plan of divine determining, they began the duty of 
contemplation and appreciation.

S i x t h l y :  On beholding the subtle, delicate, ﬁne beauties in the creation 
of  things  and  in  the  art  in  beings,  in  the  station  of  declaring  Allah  to  be 
free of all defect, they took up the duty of love and yearning for their All-
Glorious Creator, their All-Beauteous Maker. That is to say, after observing

the universe and works and performing the duties in the above-mentioned 
stations in the form of relations with an unseen object of worship, they rose 
to the degree of beholding too the dealings and acts of the All-Wise Maker, 
whereby, in the form of relations in the presence of the person concerned, 
they responded with knowledge and wonder in the face of the All-Glorious 
Creator’s making Himself known to conscious beings through the miracles 
of His art, and declared:  َكِ(cid:99)َ(cid:158)ِرْ(cid:151)َ(cid:174)  َ

ّقَ(cid:110)  َكاَ(cid:179)ْ(cid:158)َرَ(cid:150) اَ(cid:174) 
known are the miracles of Your works of art! ”

Then, they responded with love and passion to that Most Merciful One’s 

making Himself loved through the beautiful fruits of His mercy. 
5 4 3 2  they declared.

Then they responded with thanks and praise to the True Bestower’s show-
ing His mercy and compassion through His sweet bounties, and exclaimed: 
َكَ(cid:178)اَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126) 1 How can we thank You as is Your due? You are utterly 
“  َك ِد ْ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:111)ِ(cid:92)َو 
worthy  of  thanks!  For  all  Your  bounties  spread  through  all  the  universe 
hymn  Your  praises  and  thanks  through  the  clear  tongues  of  their  beings. 
All  Your  bounties  lined  up  in  the  market  of  the  world  and  scattered  over 
the face of the earth proclaim Your praises and extol You. By testifying to 
Your muniﬁcence and generosity, all the well-ordered, ﬁnely proportioned 
fruits of Your mercy and bounty offer You thanks before the gazes of Your 
creatures. ”

Then  they  responded,  saying:  ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا  ُ

ّ(cid:195)َا  before  the  manifestation  of 
divine beauty, glory, perfection, and majesty in the mirrors of beings, ever 
changing on the face of the universe; they bowed reverently in their impo-
tence, and prostrated in humility with love and wonder.

Then  announcing  their  poverty  and  need,  they  responded  with  sup-
plication  and  beseeching  to  the  Possessor  of  Absolute  Riches’  display-
ing the abundance of His wealth and breadth of His mercy, and declared:

Then they responded appreciatively to the All-Glorious Maker’s display-
ing the subtleties and wonders of His antique art in the exhibition of crea-

tures, exclaiming: ُ

And they responded with submission and obedience to the Monarch of 
Pre-Eternity  and  Post-Eternity’s  proclamation  of  the  sovereignty  of  His 
dominicality  in  every  corner  of  the  universe  and  the  manifestation  of  His

Then, before the manifestation of the Godhead of that Sustainer of All the 
Worlds, they responded with worship and humble veneration, which con-
sists of proclaiming their weakness within powerlessness and poverty within 
need and with the prescribed prayers, which are the summary of worship. 
Thus, by performing their various duties of worship in the mighty  mosque 
known as the abode of this world, they carried out the obligations and duties 
of their lives, and assumed “ the ﬁnest of forms. ” They ascended to a rank 
above all creatures by which, through the auspiciousness of belief and assur-
ance and the Trust, they became trustworthy vicegerents of the earth. And 
after this ﬁeld of trial and place of examination, their Muniﬁcent Sustainer 
invited them to eternal happiness in recompense for their belief, and to the 
Abode of Peace in reward for their adhering to His religion of Islam. There, 
He bestowed on them out of His mercy bounties so dazzling that no eye has 
seen them, nor ear heard them, nor have they occurred to the heart of man 
1 – and so He does bestow these on them, and He gives them eternity and 
everlasting life. For the desirous, mirror-bearing lovers of an eternal, abid-
ing beauty who gaze upon it will certainly not perish, but will go to eternity. 
The ﬁnal state of the Qur’an’s students is thus. May Almighty Allah include 
us among them, Amen!

As for the other group, the sinners and the wicked, when they entered the 
palace of this world at the age of discretion, they responded with unbelief to 
all the evidences of divine unity, and with ingratitude towards all the boun-
ties, and by accusing all creatures of being valueless, insulted them in an 
unbelieving manner. And since they rejected and denied all the manifesta-
tions of the divine names, they committed a boundless crime in a short time 
and became deserving of endless punishment. For the capital of life and the 
human faculties were given to man for the duties mentioned above.

O  my  senseless  soul  and  foolish  friend!  Do  you  suppose  your  life’s 
duty is restricted to living the good life according to the requisites of civi-
lization, and, if you will excuse the expression, to gratifying the physical 
appetites? Do you suppose the sole aim of the delicate and subtle senses, 
the sensitive faculties and members, the well-ordered limbs and systems, 
the inquisitive feelings and senses included in the machine of your life is 
restricted to satisfying the low desires of the base soul in this ﬂeeting life? 
Allah forbid! There are two main aims in their creation and inclusion in 
your essential being:

T h e   F i r s t  consists in making known to you all the varieties of the True 
Bestower’s bounties, and causing you to offer Him thanks. You should be 
aware of this, and offer Him thanks and worship.

T h e   S e c o n d  is to make known to you by means of your faculties all the 
sorts of the sacred divine names’ manifestations displayed in the world and 
to cause you to experience them. And you, by recognizing them by experi-
encing them, should come to believe in them.

Thus, man develops and is perfected through the achievement of these 

two basic aims. Through them, man becomes a true human being.

Look through the meaning of the following comparison, and see that the 
human faculties were not given in order to gain worldly life like an animal.
For example, someone gave one of his servants twenty gold pieces, tell-
ing him to have a suit of clothes made out of a particular cloth. The servant 
went and got himself a ﬁne suit out of the highest grade of the cloth, and 
put  it  on.  Then  he  saw  that  his  employer  had  given  another  of  his  serv-
ants  a  thousand  gold  pieces,  and  putting  in  the  servant’s  pocket  a  piece 
of paper with some things written on it, had sent him to conclude some 
business.  Now,  anyone  with  any  sense  would  know  that  the  capital  was 
not for getting a suit of clothes, for, since the ﬁrst servant had bought a suit 
of the ﬁnest cloth with twenty gold pieces, the thousand gold pieces were 
certainly not to be spent in the same way. But since the second servant had 
not read the paper in his pocket, and looking at the ﬁrst servant, had given 
all the money to a shopkeeper for a suit of clothes, and then received the 
most inferior grade of cloth and a suit ﬁfty times worse that his friend’s, 
his employer was bound to reprimand him severely for his utter stupidity, 
and punish him angrily.

O my soul and my friend! Come to your senses! Do not spend the capital 
and potentialities of your life on pleasures of the ﬂesh and this ﬂeeting life 

152

THE WORDS

like an animal, or even lower. Otherwise, although you are ﬁfty times supe-
rior with regard to capital than the highest animal, you will fall ﬁfty times 
lower than the lowest.

O my heedless soul! If you want to understand to a degree both the aim 
of your life and its nature, and the form of your life, and the true meaning of 
your life, and its perfect happiness, then look! The summary of the aims of 
your life consists of nine matters.

T h e  F i r s t  i s  t h i s :  To weigh up on the scales of the senses included in your 
being the bounties stored up in the treasuries of divine mercy, and to offer 
universal thanks.

T h e   S e c o n d :  To open with the keys of the faculties placed in your nature 
the hidden treasuries of the sacred divine names, and through those names to 
know the Most Pure and Holy One.

T h e   T h i r d :  To consciously display and make known through your life in 
the view of the creatures in this exhibition of the world the wondrous arts 
and subtle manifestations which the divine names have attached to you.

T h e   F o u r t h :   To  proclaim  your  worship  at  the  court  of  the  Creator’s 

dominicality verbally and through the tongue of your disposition.

T h e   F i f t h :  As on ceremonial occasions a soldier wears all the decora-
tions he has received from his king, and appearing before the king, displays 
the marks of his favour towards him, so this is to consciously adorn yourself 
in  the  jewels  of  the  subtle  senses  which  the  manifestations  of  the  divine 
names have given you, and to appear in the observant view of the Pre-Eter-
nal Witness.

T h e   S i x t h :   To  consciously  observe  the  salutations  of  living  beings  to 
their Creator, known as the manifestations of life, and their gloriﬁcations of 
their Maker, known as the signs of life, and their worship of the Bestower of 
Life, known as the aims of life, and by reﬂecting on them to see them, and 
through testifying to them to display them.

T h e   S e v e n t h :  By taking as units of measurement the small samples of 
such attributes as the partial knowledge, power, and will given to your 
life,  it  is  to  know  through  those  measures  the  absolute  attributes  and 
sacred  qualities  of  the  All-Glorious  Creator.  For  example,  since,  with 
your partial power, knowledge, and will, you have made your house in 
orderly  fashion,  you  should  know  that  the  Maker  of  the  palace  of  the 
world is its Disposer and is Powerful, Knowing, and Wise to the degree 
it is greater than your house.

ELEVENTH WORD 

153

T h e   E i g h t h :  To understand the words concerning the Creator’s unity and 
Maker’s dominicality uttered by the beings in the world each in its particular 
tongue.

T h e   N i n t h :  To understand through your impotence and weakness, your 
poverty  and  need,  the  degrees  of  divine  power  and  dominical  riches.  Just 
as  the  pleasure  and  degrees  and  varieties  of  food  are  understood  through 
the degrees of hunger and the sorts of need, so you should understand the 
degrees of the inﬁnite divine power and riches through your inﬁnite impo-
tence and poverty. The aims of your life, then, brieﬂy, are matters like these. 
Now consider the nature of your life; its summary is this:

It is an index of wonders pertaining to the divine names; a scale for meas-
uring the divine qualities and attributes; a balance of the worlds within the 
universe; a list of the mighty world; a map of the cosmos; a summary of the 
vast book of the universe; a bunch of keys with which to open the hidden 
treasuries of divine power; and a most excellent pattern of the perfections 
scattered over beings and attached to time. The nature of your life consists 
of matters like these.

Now, the form of your life and the manner of its duty is this: your life is 
an inscribed word, a wisdom-displaying word written by the pen of power. 
Seen and heard, it points to the divine names. The form of your life consists 
of matters like these. 

Now the true meaning of your life is this: its acting as a mirror to the 
manifestation of divine oneness and the manifestation of eternal besought-
edness. That is to say, by virtue of the comprehensiveness arising from being 
like the point of focus for all the divine names manifested in the world, it is 
its being a mirror to the Single and Eternally Besought One. 

Now, as for the perfection of your life, it is to perceive the lights of the 
Pre-Eternal Sun which are depicted in the mirror of your life, and to love 
them.  As  a  conscious  being,  it  is  to  display  ardour  for  Him.  It  is  to  pass 
beyond yourself with love of Him. It is to establish the reﬂection of His light 
in the centre of your heart. It is due to this mystery that the Sacred Hadith 
was uttered, which is expressed by the following lines, and will raise you to 
the highest of the high:

 1  ْ(cid:299)(cid:315)ِ(cid:301)ِ(cid:296) ْ(cid:307)ُ(cid:296)  ِ(cid:213)ْ(cid:293)َ(cid:285)َ(cid:214)

[ This Word consists of a brief comparison between the sacred wisdom 
of the All-Wise Qur’an and the wisdom of philosophy and science, and 
a concise summary of the instruction and training which Qur’anic wis-
dom gives to man in his personal life and social life, and an indication 
of  the  Qur’an’s  superiority  to  other  divine  words,  and  to  all  speech. 
There are four principles in this Word. ]

FIRST PRINCIPLE

Look through the telescope of the following story which is in the form of 
a comparison, and see the differences between Qur’anic wisdom and that of 
philosophy and science:

One time, a renowned ruler who was both religious and a ﬁne craftsman 
wanted to write the All-Wise Qur’an in a script worthy of the sacredness 
of  its  meaning  and  the  miraculousness  of  its  words,  so  that  its  marvel-
displaying stature would be arrayed in wondrous apparel. The artist-king 
therefore wrote the Qur’an in a truly wonderful fashion. He used all his 
precious jewels in its writing. In order to indicate the great variety of its 
truths, he wrote some of its embodied letters in diamonds and emeralds, 
and some in rubies and agate, and other sorts in brilliants and coral, while 
others he inscribed with silver and gold. He adorned and decorated it in 
such  a  way  that  everyone,  those  who  knew  how  to  read  and  those  who 
did  not,  were  full  of  admiration  and  astonishment  when  they  beheld  it. 
Especially in the view of the people of truth, since the outer beauty was an 
indication of the brilliant beauty and striking adornment in its meaning, it 
became a truly precious antique.

155

156

THE WORDS

Then the ruler showed the artistically wrought and bejewelled Qur’an to 
a European philosopher and to a Muslim scholar. In order to test them and 
for reward, he commanded them: “ Each of you write a work about the  wis-
dom and purposes of this! ” First the philosopher, then the scholar composed 
a book about it. However, the philosopher’s book discussed only the decora-
tions of the letters and their relationships and conditions, and the properties 
of the jewels, and described them. It did not touch on their meaning at all, for 
the European had no knowledge of the Arabic script. He did not even know 
that the embellished Qur’an was a book, a written piece, expressing a mean-
ing. He rather looked on it as an ornamented antique. He did not know any 
Arabic, but he was a very good engineer and he described things very aptly, 
and he was a skilful chemist, and an ingenious jeweller. So this man wrote 
his work according to those crafts.

As for the Muslim scholar, when he looked at the qur’an, he understood 
that  it  was  the  Perspicuous  Book,  the  All-Wise  Qur’an.  This  truth-loving 
person neither attached importance to the external adornments, nor busied 
himself  with  the  ornamented  letters.  He  became  preoccupied  with  some-
thing a million times higher, more elevated, more subtle, more noble, more 
beneﬁcial, and more comprehensive than the matters with which the other 
man had busied himself. For discussing the sacred truths and lights of the 
mysteries  beneath  the  veil  of  the  decorations,  he  wrote  a  truly  ﬁne  com-
mentary. Then the two of them took their works and presented them to the 
illustrious ruler. The ruler ﬁrst took the philosopher’s work. He looked at it 
and saw that the self-centred and nature-worshipping man had worked very 
hard, but had written nothing of true wisdom; he had understood nothing of 
its meaning. Indeed, he had confused it and been disrespectful towards it, 
and ill-mannered even. For supposing that source of truths, the qur’an, to 
be meaningless decoration, he had insulted it as being valueless in regard to 
meaning. So the wise ruler hit him over the head with his work and expelled 
him from his presence.

Then  he  looked  at  the  work  of  the  other,  the  truth-loving,  scrupulous 
scholar, and saw that it was an extremely ﬁne and beneﬁcial commentary, 
a  most  wise  composition  full  of  guidance.  “ Congratulations!  May  Allah 
bless you! ”, he said. Thus, wisdom is this and they call those who possess it 
knowledgeable and wise. As for the other man, he was a craftsman who had 
exceeded his mark. Then in reward for the scholar’s work, he commanded 
that in return for each letter ten gold pieces should be given him from his 
inexhaustible treasury.

TWELFTH WORD 

157

If you have understood the comparison, now look and see the reality:
The  ornamented  qur’an  is  this  artistically  fashioned  universe,  and  the 
ruler is the Pre-Eternal All-Wise One. As for the two men, one – the Euro-
pean – represents philosophy and its philosophers, and the other, the Qur’an 
and its students. Yes, the All-Wise Qur’an is a most elevated  expounder, a 
most eloquent translator of the mighty qur’an of the universe. Yes, it is the 
Criterion which instructs man and the jinn concerning the signs of creation 
inscribed by the pen of power on the pages of the universe and on the leaves 
of time. It regards beings, each of which is a meaningful letter, as bearing 
the meaning of another, that is, it looks at them on account of their Maker. 
It  says,  “ How  beautifully  they  have  been  made!  How  exquisitely  they 
point  to  their  Maker’s  beauty! ”,  thus  showing  the  universe’s  true  beauty. 
But the philosophy they call natural philosophy or science has plunged into 
the decorations of the letters of beings and into their relationships, and has 
become bewildered; it has confused the way of reality. While the letters of 
this mighty book should be looked at as bearing the meaning of another, that 
is, on account of Allah, they have not done this; they have looked at beings 
as signifying themselves. That is, they have looked at beings on account of 
beings, and have discussed them in that way. Instead of saying, “ How beau-
tifully they have been made, ” they say “ How beautiful they are, ” and have 
made  them  ugly.  In  doing  this  they  have  insulted  the  universe,  and  made 
it complain about them. Indeed, philosophy without religion is a sophistry 
divorced from reality and an insult to the universe.

SECOND PRINCIPLE

A comparison between the moral training the wisdom of the All-Wise 

Qur’an gives to personal life and what philosophy and science teach:

The sincere student of philosophy is a pharaoh, but he is a contemptible 
pharaoh who worships the basest thing for the sake of beneﬁt; he recognizes 
everything from which he can proﬁt as his lord. Such an irreligious student 
is obstinate and refractory, but he is wretched together with his obstinacy 
and accepts endless abasement for the sake of one pleasure. And he is abject 
together with his recalcitrance and shows his abasement by kissing the feet 
of satanic people for the sake of some base beneﬁt. And that irreligious stu-
dent is conceited and domineering, but since he can ﬁnd no point of support 
in his heart, he is an utterly impotent blustering tyrant. And that student is 
a self-centered seeker of beneﬁt whose aim and endeavour is to gratify his 
animal  appetites;  a  crafty  egotist  who  seeks  his  personal  interests  within 
certain nationalist interests.

158

THE WORDS

However,  the  sincere  student  of  Qur’anic  wisdom  is  a  servant,  but  he 
does not stoop to worship even the greatest of creatures; he is an esteemed 
slave who makes not even a supreme beneﬁt like Paradise the purpose of 
his worship. And its student is humble; he is righteous and mild, yet outside 
the limits of his Maker’s leave, he would not voluntarily lower and  abase 
himself before anything other than his Maker. And he is weak and in want 
and he knows his weakness and poverty, but he is self-sufﬁcient due to the 
wealth which his All-Generous Lord has stored up for him in the hereafter, 
and he is strong since he relies on his Master’s inﬁnite power. And he acts 
and strives only for Allah’s sake, for Allah’s pleasure, and for virtue. 

The training the two give may be understood from the comparison of the 

two students.

THIRD PRINCIPLE

social life is this:

The training philosophy and science and Qur’anic wisdom give to human 

Philosophy accepts force as its point of support in the life of society. It 
considers its aim to be beneﬁts. The principle of its life it recognizes to be 
conﬂict. It holds the bond between communities to be racialism and negative 
nationalism. Its fruits are gratifying the appetites of the soul and increasing 
human needs. However, the mark of force is aggression. The mark of ben-
eﬁt – since they are insufﬁcient for every desire – is jostling and tussling. 
While the mark of conﬂict is strife. And the mark of racialism – since it is 
nourished by devouring others – is aggression. It is for these reasons that it 
has negated the happiness of humankind.

As for the Qur’anic wisdom, its point of support is truth instead of force. 
It takes virtue and Allah’s pleasure as its aims in place of beneﬁts. It takes 
the principle of mutual assistance as the principle of life in place of the prin-
ciple of conﬂict. And it holds the ties of religion, class, and country to be 
the ties bonding communities. Its aim is to form a barrier against the lusts 
of the soul, urge the spirit to sublime matters, satisfy the high emotions, and 
urging man to the human perfections, make him a true human being. And 
the mark of the truth is accord. The mark of virtue is solidarity. The mark of 
mutual assistance is hastening to assist one another. The mark of religion is 
brotherhood and attraction. And the mark of reining in and tethering the soul 
and leaving the spirit free and urging it towards perfections is happiness in 
this world and the next.

TWELFTH WORD 

FOURTH PRINCIPLE

159

If you want to understand the Qur’an’s superiority among all the divine 
scriptures and its supremacy over all speech and writings, then consider the 
following two comparisons:

T h e   F i r s t :  A king has two forms of speech, two forms of address. One is 
to speak on his private telephone with a common subject concerning  some 
minor matter, some private need. The other, under the title of sublime sov-
ereignty,  supreme  vicegerent,  and  universal  rulership,  is  to  speak  with  an 
envoy or high ofﬁcial for the purpose of making known and promulgating 
his commands, to make an utterance through an elevated decree proclaiming 
his majesty.

T h e   S e c o n d :  One man holds the mirror he is holding up to the sun. He 
receives light containing the seven colours according to the capacity of the 
mirror. He becomes connected to the sun through that relation and converses 
with  it,  and  if  he  directs  the  light-ﬁlled  mirror  towards  his  dark  house  or 
his roofed garden, he will beneﬁt, not in relation to the sun’s value, but in 
accordance with the capacity of the mirror. Another man, however, opens 
up broad windows in his house or in the roof over his garden. He opens up 
ways to the sun in the sky. He converses with the perpetual light of the actual 
sun and speaks with it, and says in gratitude through the tongue of his being: 
“ O you beauty of the world who gilds the face of the earth with his light and 
makes the faces of the ﬂowers smile! O beauty of the skies, ﬁne sun! You 
have furnished my little house and garden with light and heat the same as 
you have furnished them with light and heat. ” Whereas the man with the 
mirror  cannot  say  that.  The  reﬂection  and  works  of  the  sun  are  restricted 
and limited; they are in accordance with the restriction. Look at the Qur’an 
through the telescope of these two comparisons and see its miraculousness 
and understand its sacredness.

The Qur’an says: “ If all the trees on the land were to become pens and 
all the seas were ink and they were to write the words of Almighty Allah, 
they would never come to the end of them. ” Now, the reason the Qur’an has 
been given the highest rank among the inﬁnite words of Allah is this: the 
Qur’an has come from the greatest divine name and from the greatest level 
of every name. It is Allah’s Word in respect of His being Sustainer of All the 
Worlds; it is His decree through His title of Allah of All Beings; an address 
in regard to His being Creator of the Heavens and the Earth; a conversation 
in regard to absolute dominicality; a pre-eternal address on account of uni-
versal divine sovereignty; a notebook of the favours of the Most Merciful 

160

THE WORDS

One from the point of view of His all-embracing, comprehensive mercy; a 
collection of communications at the beginnings of which ciphers are some-
times  found  which  are  related  to  the  sublime  majesty  of  the  Godhead;  a 
wisdom-scattering holy scripture which, descending from the reaches of the 
greatest name, looks to and inspects the all-comprehensive domain of the 
supreme throne. It is for these reasons that the title of Word of Allah has 
been given with complete worthiness to the Qur’an.

In respect to the other divine words, they are speech which has become 
evident through a particular regard, a minor title, through the partial mani-
festation of a particular name; through a particular dominicality, special sov-
ereignty, a private mercy. Their degrees vary in regard to particularity and 
universality. Most inspiration is of this sort, but its degrees vary greatly. For 
example, the most particular and simple is the inspiration of animals. Then 
there is the inspiration of ordinary people; then the inspiration of ordinary 
angels; then the inspiration of the saints, then the inspiration of the higher 
angels. Thus, it is for this reason that a saint who offers supplications directly 
ّدَ(cid:110) 
without  means  by  the  telephone  of  the  heart  says:  يـِ
“ My heart tells me news of my Sustainer. ” 1 He does not say, “ It tells me 
of the Sustainer of All the Worlds. ” And he says: “ My heart is the mir-
ror, the throne, of my Sustainer. ” He does not say, “ It is the throne of the 
Sustainer of All the Worlds. ” For he can manifest the address to the extent 
of its capacity and to the degree nearly seventy thousand veils 2 have been 
raised. Thus, however much higher and more elevated is the decree of a 
king promulgated in respect of his supreme sovereignty than the limited, 
insigniﬁcant  speech  of  a  common  man,  and  however  much  more  abun-
dantly  the  effulgence  of  the  sun  in  the  sky  may  be  beneﬁted  from  than 
the manifestation of its reﬂection in the mirror, and however greater is its 
superiority, to that degree the Qur’an of Mighty Stature is superior to all 
other speech and all other books.

After the Qur’an, at the second level, the holy books and revealed scrip-
tures have superiority according to their degree. They have their share from 
the  mystery  of  that  superiority.  If  all  the  ﬁne  words  of  all  men  and  jinn 
which do not issue from the Qur’an were to be gathered together, they still

If you want to compare the results yielded by the wisdom of the All-Wise 
Qur’an and of the sciences of philosophy, and their instruction and teaching 
and  the  degrees  in  their  knowledge,  then  listen  carefully  to  the  following 
words.

With its acute expositions, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition rends the 
veil of familiarity and the habitual cast over all the beings in the universe, 
which are known as ordinary things but are all extraordinary and miracles of 
divine power, and reveals those astonishing wonders to conscious beings. It 
attracts their gazes and opens up before their minds an inexhaustible treas-
ury of knowledge.

As for philosophy, it conceals within veils of the commonplace all the 
miracles  of  power,  which  are  extraordinary,  and  passes  over  them  in  an 
ignorant  and  indifferent  fashion.  It  only  puts  forward  to  be  noted  freaks, 
which  have  fallen  from  being  extraordinary  and  deviated  from  the  order 
of creation, and sheered away from the perfections of their true natures; it 
offers them to conscious beings as objects of wise instruction. For example, 
it  says  that  man’s  creation  is  ordinary,  despite  its  being  a  comprehensive 
miracle of power, and looks on it indifferently. But then with cries of aston-
ishment, it points out as an object of instruction a person who has diverged 
from the perfection of creation and has three legs or two heads.

And for example, it considers ordinary the regular sustenance of infants 
and young, bestowed from the treasury of mercy, which is a truly delicate, 
general miracle of mercy, and draws a veil of ingratitude over it. But then,

order and is alone and isolated from its fellows, being fed with green sea-
weed,  it  wants  to  make  the  ﬁshermen  weep  for  it,  because  of  the  divine 
favour and muniﬁcence manifested on it. 1

So see the wealth and riches of the Holy Qur’an in regard to the knowl-
edge, wisdom, and cognizance of Allah, and the poverty and bankruptcy of 
philosophy  regarding  learning,  instruction,  and  knowledge  of  the  Maker! 
See them and take a lesson! 

It  is  because  of  this  that  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  is  free  of  the  fancies  of 
poetry, because it contains inﬁnite brilliant, elevated truths. Another reason 
the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition is not in verse, despite its composition 
and orderedness, which are so perfect as to be inimitable, and its expounding 
with its well-ordered styles the order and art of the book of the universe, is 
this: by not entering under the restrictions of metre, each star of its verses 
can  be  a  sort  of  centre  to  the  most  of  the  other  verses,  and  be  a  brother 
to  them,  and  each  can  form  a  connecting  line  with  the  verses  within  the 
sphere encompassing it in order to be a bond in the relationships which exist 
between them. It is as if every single verse has an eye which looks to most 
of the other verses and a face which is turned towards them. Thousands of 
Qur’ans are present within the Qur’an, each of which it offers to followers 
of the different paths. As is described in the Twenty-Fifth Word, within Sura 
al-Ikhlas is a treasury of knowledge about divine unity comprising thirty-six 
Sura  al-Ikhlas’s  and  formed  of  a  compound  of  six  phrases,  each  winged. 
Indeed, like the apparently unordered stars in the sky, each is unrestricted 
and as a sort of centre extends a connecting line to all the stars in the area 
surrounding it, indicating the hidden relation between beings. It is as if, like 
the stars of verses, each single star has an eye which looks to all stars and a 
face which is turned to them. See then the perfect order within the apparent 
lack of order and take a lesson! Understand one meaning of the verse,

( 36:69 ) Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ 
Understand from it also that the mark of poetry is to adorn insigniﬁcant 
and dull facts with big, shining images and fancies, to make them attractive. 
Whereas the truths of the Qur’an are so great, elevated, shining and brilliant, 
that even the greatest and most brilliant imaginings are dull and insigniﬁcant 
in comparison. Innumerable truths like the following verses testify to this. 
For example:

If  you  want  to  see  and  appreciate  how,  like  shining  stars,  each  of  the 
Qur’an’s verses scatters the darkness of unbelief by spreading the light of 
miraculousness and guidance, imagine yourself in the Age of Ignorance and 
desert of savagery where everything was enveloped in veils of lifelessness 
and nature amid the darkness of ignorance and heedlessness. Then suddenly 
from the elevated tongue of the Qur’an, you hear verses like:

( 62:1 ) , + * ) ( ' & % $ # " ! 
See how those dead or sleeping creatures of the world spring to life in the 
minds of those listening at the sound of “ declares the praises and glory, ” 
how they awake, spring up, and mention Allah’s names! And at the sound 
of, 

( 17:44 ) f e d c b 
the stars in those black skies, all lifeless pieces of ﬁre, and the wretched crea-
tures on the face of the earth, present the following view to those listening: 
the sky appears as a mouth and the stars each as wisdom-displaying words 
and truth-uttering lights. The earth appears as a head, the land and sea as 
tongues, and all animals and plants as words of gloriﬁcation. You will oth-
erwise not appreciate the ﬁne points and pleasure at looking from this time 
to that. For if when you consider its verses, you see them as having scattered 
their  light  since  that  time,  becoming  like  universally  accepted  knowledge 
with the passage of time, and as shining with the other lights of Islam, and 
taking their colour from the sun of the Qur’an, or if you look at them through 
a superﬁcial, simple veil of familiarity, you will not truly see the darkness 
each verse scatters or how sweet is the recital of its miraculousness; you will 
not appreciate this sort of miraculousness among its many varieties. If you 
want to understand one of the highest degrees of the Qur’an of Miraculous 
Exposition’s miraculousness, listen to the following comparison:

Let us imagine an extremely strange, vast, and spreading tree which is 
concealed  beneath  a  veil  of  the  unseen  and  hidden  in  a  level  of  conceal-
ment. It is clear that there has to be a relationship, harmony, and balance

THE WORDS

between a tree and all its members for instance its branches, fruits, leaves, 
and blossom, the same as between the human members. Each of its parts 
assumes a form and is given a shape in accordance with the tree’s nature.  
So if someone appears and traces a picture on top of the veil corresponding 
to the members of the tree, which has never been seen, then delimits each 
member, and from the branches to the fruit and the fruit to the leaves draws 
a form proportionately, and ﬁlls the space between its source and extremities 
– which are an inﬁnite distance from one another – with drawings showing 
exactly the shape and form of its members, certainly no doubt will remain 
that the artist sees the concealed tree with an eye that penetrates and encom-
passes the unseen, then he depicts it.

In  just  the  same  way,  the  discriminating  statements  of  the  Qur’an  of 
Miraculous Exposition concerning the reality of contingent beings ( that is, 
concerning the reality of the tree of creation which stretches from the begin-
ning of the world to the farthest limits of the hereafter, and spreads from the 
earth to the divine throne and from minute particles to the sun ) have pre-
served the proportion between the members to such a degree and have given 
all the members and fruits a form so suitable that all investigative scholars 
have declared when they have concluded their researches into its depictions: 
“ What wonders Allah has willed! How great are Allah’s blessings! ” They 
have said: “ It is only you who solves and unravels the talisman of the uni-
verse and riddle of creation, O All-Wise Qur’an! ”

( 16:60 )  j  i  h  – and there is no error in the comparison – let 
us represent the divine names and attributes, and dominical acts and deeds 
as a Tuba tree of light, the extent of whose grandeur stretches from pre-
eternity to post-eternity, and the limits of whose vastness spread through 
inﬁnite, endless space, and encompass it, and the compass of whose deeds

twigs and aims and fruits in a way so harmonious, so ﬁtting for one another, 
so appropriate for one another, without marring one another or spoiling the 
decree of one another, or their being remote from one another, that all those 
who have discerned the reality of things and penetrated the mysteries, and 
all  the  wise  and  the  sage  who  have  journeyed    in  the  realm  of  the  inner 
dimension of things, have declared: “ Glory be to Allah! ” in the face of that 
Discriminating Exposition, and have afﬁrmed it, saying: “ How right, how 
conformable with reality, how ﬁne, how worthy! ”

Take,  for  example,  the  six  pillars  of  belief,  which  resemble  a  single 
branch  of  those  two  mighty  trees  which  look  to  the  entire  sphere  of  con-
tingency and sphere of necessity: it depicts all the branches and boughs of 
those pillars – even the farthest fruits and ﬂowers – observing such a har-
mony and proportion between them, and describes them in a manner so bal-
anced, and illustrates them in a way so symmetrical that the human mind is 
powerless to perceive it and stands astonished at its beauty. And the proof 
that a beauty of proportion and perfect relation and complete balance have 
been preserved between the ﬁve pillars of Islam, which are like one twig of 
the branch of belief, down to the ﬁnest details, smallest point of conduct, 
furthest aims, most profound wisdom, and most insigniﬁcant fruits, is the 
perfect  order  and  balance  and  beauty  of  proportion  and  soundness  of  the 
Greater Shari‘a of Islam, which has emerged from the decisive statements, 
senses, indications, and allusions of the comprehensive Qur’an; they form 
an irrefutable and decisive proof and just witness that cannot be doubted. 
This means that the expositions of the Qur’an cannot be attributed to man’s 
partial knowledge, and particularly to the knowledge of someone unlettered. 
They rest rather on a comprehensive knowledge and are the word of One 
able to see all things together and observe in one moment all truths between 
pre-eternity and post-eternity. The verse:

[ A conversation held with some young people who, though surrounded 
by temptation, had not yet lost their powers of reason. ]

Being assaulted by the deceptive, seductive amusements of the present 
time, a group of young people were asking: “ How can we save our lives in 
the hereafter? ”, and they sought help from the  R i s a l e - i   N u r . So I said the 
following to them in the name of the R i s a l e - i   N u r :

The grave is there and no one can deny it. Whether they want to or not, 
everyone must enter it. And apart from the following three ways, there is no 
way it can be approached.

F i r s t   W a y :  For those who believe, the grave is the door to a world far 

better than this world.

S e c o n d   W a y :  For those who believe in the hereafter but who approach 
it on the path of dissipation and misguidance, it is the door to a prison of 
solitary conﬁnement, an eternal dungeon, where they will be separated from 
all their loved ones. They will receive such treatment because although they 
viewed it as such and believed in it, they did not act accordingly.

T h i r d   W a y :  For the unbelievers and the misguided who do not believe 
in the hereafter, the grave is the door to eternal extinction. That is to say, 
it is the gallows on which both themselves and all those they love will be 
executed. Since they think it is thus, that is exactly how they shall experi-
ence it: as punishment.

These last two ways are self-evident, they do not require proof, they are 
plain for all to see. Since the appointed hour is secret and death may come 
any time and cut off one’s head, and it does not differentiate between young 
and old, perpetually having such an awesome and serious matter before him, 
unhappy man will surely search for the means to deliver himself from that 
eternal extinction, that inﬁnite, endless solitary conﬁnement; the means to 
transform  the  door  of  the  grave  into  a  door  opening  on  to  an  everlasting 
world, eternal happiness, and a world of light. It will be a question for him 
that looms as large as the world.

The  certain  fact  of  death,  then,  can  only  be  approached  in  these  three 
ways, and one hundred and twenty-four thousand veracious messengers – 
the prophets with their miracles as signs of conﬁrmation – have announced 
that  the  three  ways  are  as  described  above.  And,  relying  on  their  illumi-
nations and visions, one hundred and twenty-four million saints have con-
ﬁrmed and set their signatures on the prophets’ tidings. And innumerable 
exact scholars have proved it rationally with their categorical proofs at the 
level of certainty at the degree of knowledge. 1 They have all unanimously 
declared it to be a ninety-nine per cent certain probability, saying: “ The only 
way to be saved from extinction and eternal imprisonment and be directed 
towards eternal happiness is through belief in Allah and obedience to Him. ”
If a person considers but does not heed the word of a single messenger 
not  to  take  a  dangerous  road  on  which  there  is  a  one  per  cent  danger  of 
perishing, and takes it, the anxiety at perishing he suffers will destroy even 
his  appetite  for  food.  Thus  hundreds  of  thousands  of  veracious  and  veri-
ﬁed messengers announced that there is a one hundred per cent probability 
that misguidance and vice lead to the gallows of the grave, ever before the 
eyes, and eternal solitary conﬁnement; that there is a one hundred per cent 
probability that belief and worship remove those gallows, close the solitary 
prison, and transform the ever-apparent grave into a door opening onto an 
everlasting treasury and palace of felicity; and they have pointed out signs 
and traces of these. Confronted as he is, then, with this strange, awesome, 
terrifying matter, if wretched man – especially if he is a Muslim – does not 
believe and worship, is he able to banish the grievous pain arising from the 
anxiety he suffers as he all the time awaits his turn to be summoned to those 
gallows, ever-present before his eyes, even if he is given rule over the whole 
world together with all its pleasures? I ask you.

Since  old  age,  illness,  disaster,  and  on  all  sides  death  exacerbate  the 
frightful pain and are a reminder, even if the people of misguidance and vice 
enjoy a hundred thousand pleasures and delights, they most certainly expe-
rience a sort of hell in their hearts, but a profound stupor of heedlessness 
temporarily makes them insensible to it.

Since for the people of belief and worship the grave, ever before their 
eyes, is the door to an everlasting treasury and eternal happiness, and since, 
by reason of the ‘belief coupon’, a ticket from the pre-eternal lottery of divine 
determining for millions upon millions of liras’ worth of gold and diamonds 
has  come  up  for  each  of  them,  they  all  the  time  await  the  word,    “ Come 

1.  One of these is the R i s a l e - i   N u r . And it is there for all to see. ( Author )

THE WORDS

and  collect  your  ticket ”  with  a  truly  profound  pleasure  and  real  spiritual 
delight. The pleasure is such that if it materialized and the seed became a 
tree, it would be like a private paradise. However, the person who abandons 
the delight and great pleasure due to the drives of youth, and chooses in a 
dissolute and licentious manner temporary illicit pleasures, which resemble 
poisonous honey polluted with those innumerable pains, falls to a degree a 
hundred times lower than an animal.

Furthermore, such a person will not be like unbelieving Europeans, for if 
they deny the Prophet Muhammad ( UWBP ), they may recognize the other 
prophets. And if they do not know Allah, they may possess some good quali-
ties by which to attain to certain perfections. But a Muslim knows both the 
prophets, and his Sustainer, and all perfection by means of Muhammad the 
Arabian ( UWBP ). If one of them abandons the Prophet’s instruction and 
puts himself outside his fold, he will not recognize any other prophet, nei-
ther  will  he  recognize  Allah.  Nor  will  he  know  any  of  the  fundamentals 
within his spirit which will preserve his perfections. For, since Muhammad 
( UWBP ) is the last and greatest of the prophets, and his religion and sum-
mons are for all humanity, and since he is superior to all with regard to his 
miracles  and  religion,  and  acts  as  teacher  to  all  humankind  in  all  matters 
concerning  reality,  and  has  proved  this  in  a  brilliant  manner  for  fourteen 
centuries, and is the cause of pride for humankind, a Muslim who abandons 
Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) essential training and the principles of his religion 
will most certainly be unable to ﬁnd any light, or achieve any perfection. He 
will be condemned to absolute decline.

You unfortunates who are addicted to the pleasures of this worldly life, 
and with anxiety at the future, struggle to secure it and your lives! If you 
want pleasure, delight, happiness, and ease in this world, make do with what 
is licit, for it is sufﬁcient for your enjoyment. You will surely have under-
stood from other parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  that in every pleasure that is out-
side this and is illicit, lies a thousand pains. If the events of the future – for 
example, of ﬁfty years hence – were to be shown in the cinema in the same 
way  that  they  show  at  the  present  time  the  events  of  the  past,  those  who 
indulge in vice would weep with horror and disgust at those things which 
now amuse them.

Anyone who wishes to be permanently, eternally happy in this world and 
the next should take as their guide the instruction of Muhammad ( UWBP ) 
within the bounds of belief.

A Warning, Lesson, and Reminder

A Warning, Lesson, and Reminder
Given to a Number of Unhappy Youths
One  day  a  number  of  bright  youths  came  to  me,  seeking  an  effective 
deterrent in order to guard themselves against the dangers arising from life, 
youth, and the lusts of the soul. Like I told those who had previously sought 
help from the R i s a l e - i   N u r , I said the following to those youths.

Your youth will deﬁnitely leave you, and if you do not remain within the 
bounds of the licit, it will be lost, and rather than its pleasures, it will bring 
you calamities and suffering in this world, in the grave, and in the hereaf-
ter. But if, through Islamic training, you spend the bounty of your youth as 
thanks  honourably,  in  uprightness  and  obedience,  it  will  in  effect  remain 
perpetually and will be the cause of gaining eternal youth.

As for life, if it passes without belief, or because of rebelliousness belief 
is  ineffective,  it  will  produce  pains,  sorrows  and  grief  far  exceeding  the 
superﬁcial, ﬂeeting enjoyment it brings. For, contrary to the animals, man 
possesses a mind and he thinks and so is connected to both the present time, 
and to the past and the future. He can obtain both pain and pleasure from 
them.  Whereas  since  the  animals  do  not  think,  the  sorrows  arising  from 
the past and the fears and anxieties concerning the future do not spoil their 
pleasure of the present. But, for man, if he has fallen into misguidance and 
heedlessness, such sorrows and anxieties completely spoil his partial present 
pleasure, and make it bitter. Especially if the pleasure is illicit; then it is like 
an altogether poisonous honey.

That is to say, from the point of view of life’s pleasure, man falls a hun-
dred times lower than the animals. In fact, life for the people of misguidance 
and  heedlessness,  and  indeed  their  existence,  and  their  world  even,  is  the 
day in which they ﬁnd themselves. From the point of view of their misguid-
ance, all the time and universes of the past are non-existent, are dead. So 
since their intellects connect them to the past and the future, they produce 
darkness, blackness for them. Due to their lack of belief, the future is also 
non-existent. Furthermore, because they think, the eternal separations result-
ing from this non-existence continuously produce darkness for their lives.

But if belief gives life to life, then through the light of belief, both the 
past and the future are illuminated and ﬁnd existence. Like present time, it 
produces elevated, spiritual pleasures and lights of existence for the spirit

and heart – in respect of belief. There is an explanation of this truth in the 
Seventh Hope of the Tr e a t i s e   f o r   t h e   E l d e r l y . You may refer to that.

Life is thus. If you want the pleasure and enjoyment of life, give life to 
your life through belief, and adorn it with the religious duties, and preserve 
it by abstaining from sins.

Concerning the fearsome reality of death, demonstrated by deaths every 
day, everywhere, at all times, I shall explain it to you with a comparison, in 
the same way that I told the other youths.

For  example,  a  gallows  has  been  erected  here  in  front  of  your  eyes. 
Beside it is a lottery ofﬁce, but one which gives tickets for truly huge prizes. 
We here are ten people and whether we like it or not, we shall be summoned 
there; there is no alternative. They will call us, and since the time is secret, 
any minute they may say either: “ Come and collect the ticket for your exe-
cution! Mount the gallows! ” Or: “ A ticket to win a prize of millions of liras’ 
worth of gold has come up for you. Come and collect it! ” While waiting 
for them to say this, two people suddenly appear at the door. One of them 
is a scantily dressed woman, beautiful and deceiving. In her hand is some 
apparently extremely delicious, but in fact poisonous, candy, which she has 
brought wanting us to eat it. The other is an undeceiving and undeceivable 
serious person. He enters behind the woman, and says:

“ I have brought you a talisman, a lesson. If you study it and you do not 
eat that candy, you will be saved from the gallows. With this talisman, you 
will receive your ticket for the matchless prize. Look, you see with your own 
eyes that those who eat the honey mount the gallows, and until that time they 
suffer dreadful stomach pains from the poison of the candy. And it is not 
apparent who will receive the ticket for the large prize; it seems that they too 
mount the gallows. But there are millions of witnesses who testify that they 
are not hanged but make the gallows a step so as to enter the prize arena eas-
ily. So, look from the windows! The highest ofﬁcials and the high-ranking 
persons concerned with this business proclaim in loud voices: ‘Just as you 
see with the clear certainty of your own eyes those mounting the gallows, so 
be certain as daylight, with no doubt or misgiving, that those with the talis-
man receive the ticket for the prize.’ ”

Thus, as in the comparison, since the dissolute pleasures of youth in the 
sphere of the illicit, which are like poisonous honey, cause belief to be lost, 
which is the ticket for an eternal treasury and the passport for everlasting 
happiness, a person who indulges in them descends to death, which is like 
the gallows, and to the tribulations of the grave, which is like the door to 
eternal darkness. And since the appointed hour is unknown, its executioner, 

THIRTEENTH WORD  – SECOND STATION

173

not  differentiating  between  young  and  old,  may  come  at  any  time  to  cut 
off  your  head.  If  you  give  up  the  poisonous  honey  of  illicit  desires,  and 
acquire  the  Qur’anic  talisman  of  belief  and  perform  the  religious  obliga-
tions,  one  hundred  and  twenty-four  thousand  prophets  1  ( Upon  whom  be 
peace )  together  with  innumerable  saints  and  people  of  truth  have  unani-
mously announced that you will receive the ticket for the treasury of eternal 
happiness which comes up from the extraordinary lottery of human destiny. 
And they have pointed to traces of it.

In Short: Youth will depart. And if it departs being squandered, it results 
in thousands of calamities and pains both in this world and in the next. If 
you want to understand how the majority of such youths end up in hospitals 
with imagined diseases arising from misspent youth and prodigality, and in 
prisons or hostels for the destitute through their excesses, and in bars due 
to the distress arising from their pain and suffering, then go and ask at the 
hospitals, prisons and graveyards.

For  sure,  just  as  you  will  hear  from  most  of  the  hospitals  the  moans 
and  groans  of  those  ill  from  dissipation  and  debauchery  resulting  from 
the drives of youth, so will you hear from the prisons the regretful sighs 
of unhappy youths who are being punished for illicit deeds mostly result-
ing from the excesses of youth. And you will understand that most of the 
torments of the grave – that Intermediate Realm the doors of which con-
tinuously open and shut for those who enter it – are the result of misspent 
youth, as is testiﬁed to by those who have divined the life of the grave and 
is afﬁrmed by the people of reality.

Also, ask the elderly and the sick, who form the majority of humankind. 
Certainly, the great majority of them will say with sorrow and regret: “ Alas! 
We wasted our youth on passion and fancy; indeed, harmfully. Be careful, 
do not do as we did! ” For in consequence of the illicit pleasures of ﬁve to 
ten years’ youth, a person suffers years of grief and sorrow in this world, 
torment and harm in the Intermediate Realm, and the calamities of Hell in 
the hereafter. Although such a person is in a most pitiable situation, he in no 
way deserves pity. ُهَ(cid:170) ُرَ(cid:147)ْ(cid:179)ُ(cid:192)  َ(cid:202) ِرَر َ

Those in prison are in great need of the true consolation of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r . Particularly those who having suffered the blows of youth, are passing 
their sweet, young lives in prison; they need the R i s a l e - i  N u r  as much as they 
need bread.

Indeed, youth heeds the emotions rather than reason, and emotions and 
desires are blind; they do not consider the consequences. They prefer one 
ounce of immediate pleasure to tons of future pleasure. They kill for the one 
minute pleasure of revenge, then suffer for eighty thousand hours the pain of 
prison. And one hour’s dissolute pleasure in questions of honour may result 
in life’s enjoyment being utterly destroyed due to distress at the fear of both 
prison and enemies. There are many other examples, many pitfalls for the 
unfortunate young because of which they transform their sweet lives into the 
most bitter and pitiable lives.

Consider a vast state to the north; 1 it has gained possession of the pas-
sions of its young people and is shaking this century with its storms. For it 
has made lawful for its youths the pleasing daughters and wives of upright 
people, and these youths act only according to their feelings, which are blind 
to  all  consequences.  By  permitting  men  and  women  to  go  together  to  the 
public  baths,  they  are  even  encouraging  immorality.  And  they  consider  it 
lawful for vagabonds and the poor to plunder the property of the rich. All 
humanity trembles in the face of this calamity.

It is therefore most necessary in this century for all Muslim youths to act 
heroically, and to respond to this two-pronged attack with such keen swords 
as T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f  and A   G u i d e   f o r   Yo u t h  from the R i s a l e - i   N u r . Other-
wise those unfortunate youths will destroy utterly both their futures in this 
world,  and  their  agreeable  lives,  and  their  happiness  in  the  hereafter,  and 
their eternal lives, and transform them into torment and suffering. Moreo-
ver, through their abuses and dissoluteness, they will end up in hospitals,

and through their excesses in life, in prisons. In their old age, they will weep 
copiously with a thousand regrets.

If, on the other hand, they protect themselves with Qur’anic training and  
with  the  truths  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  they  will  become  truly  heroic  youths, 
perfect  human  beings,  successful  Muslims,  and  in  some  ways  rulers  over 
animate beings and the rest of the animal kingdom.

When a youth in prison spends one hour out of the twenty-four each day 
on the ﬁve obligatory prayers, on the one hand prison prevents him com-
mitting most sins, and on the other he repents for the mistakes that were the 
cause of his disaster, and abstains from other harmful, painful sins, and this 
will be of great beneﬁt for both his life, his future, his country, his nation, 
and his relatives, and he will also gain with his ﬂeeting youth of ten to ﬁfteen 
years an eternal, brilliant youth. Foremost the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposi-
tion, and all the revealed scriptures, have given this certain good news.

If such a youth demonstrates through moderation and obedience, his grat-
itude for the pleasing, delightful bounty of youth, it will both increase it, and 
make it eternal, and make it a pleasure. Otherwise it will be both calamitous, 
and become painful, grievous, and a nightmare, then it will depart. It will 
cause him to become like a vagrant, harmful for both his relatives, and his 
country, and his nation.

If the prisoner has been sentenced unjustly, on condition he performs 
the obligatory prayers, each hour will be the equivalent of a day’s worship, 
and the prison will be like a recluse’s cell. He will be counted among the 
pious hermits of olden times who retired to caves in order to devote them-
selves to worship. If he is poor, aged, and ill, and desirous of the truths of 
belief, on condition he performs the obligatory prayers and repents, each 
hour will become the equivalent of twenty hours’ worship, and prison will 
become  like  a  resthouse  for  him,  and  because  of  his  friends  there  who 
regard him with affection, a place of love, training, and education. He will 
probably  be  happier  staying  in  prison  than  being  free,  for  outside  he  is 
confused and subject to the assaults of sins from all sides. He may receive 
a complete education from prison. On being released, it will not be as a 
murderer or thirsting for revenge, but as someone penitent, proven by trial, 
well-behaved, and beneﬁcial for his nation. In fact, the Denizli prisoners 
became so extraordinarily well-behaved after studying the R i s a l e - i   N u r  for 
only a short time that some of those concerned said: “ Studying the R i s a l e -
i   N u r  for ﬁfteen weeks is more effective at reforming them than putting 
them in prison for ﬁfteen years. ”

THE WORDS

Since death does not die and the appointed hour is unknown, it may come 
at any time; and since the grave cannot be closed and troop after troop enter 
it and are lost; and since it has been shown through the truths of the Qur’an 
that for the believers death is transformed into the discharge  papers releas-
ing them from eternal annihilation, while for the corrupt and the dissolute 
it is to disappear for ever into eternal annihilation and be separated for ever 
from their loved ones and all beings, most certainly and with no doubt at all, 
the most fortunate person is he who with patience and thanks fully beneﬁts 
from his time in prison, and studying the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  works to serve the 
Qur’an and his belief on the straight path.

O  you  who  is  addicted  to  enjoyment  and  pleasure!  I  am  seventy-ﬁve 
years  old  and  I  know  with  utter  certainty  from  thousands  of  experiences, 
proofs,  and  events  that  true  enjoyment,  pain-free  pleasure,  grief-free  joy, 
and life’s happiness are only to be found in belief and within the bounds of 
the truths of belief. For just one worldly pleasure yields numerous pains; as 
though dealing ten slaps for a single grape, it drives away all life’s pleasure.
O you unfortunate people who are experiencing the misfortune of prison! 
Since your world is weeping and your life is bitter, strive so that your here-
after will not weep too, and your eternal life may smile and be sweet! Ben-
eﬁt from prison! Just as sometimes under severe conditions faced with the 
enemy,  an  hour’s  watch  may  be  equivalent  to  a  year’s  worship,  so  in  the 
severe conditions you are experiencing, the hardship of each hour spent as 
worship becomes the equivalent of many hours, it transforms that hardship 
into mercy.

My dear and loyal brothers!
I shall explain in three points an effective solace for those who are expe-
riencing  the  calamity  of  prison,  and  for  those  who  kindly  help  them  and 
faithfully supervise their food, which comes from outside.

ّ(cid:127)(cid:170)َا    ُهَ(cid:178)اَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126) ِه ِ(cid:175)ـ ْ(cid:126)اِ(cid:92)

F i r s t   P o i n t :  Each day spent in prison may gain as much as ten days’ wor-
ship, and, with regard to their fruits, may transform those transient hours into 
enduring hours, and through ﬁve or ten years’ punishment may be the means 
of saving a person from millions of years of everlasting imprisonment. For 
the  believers,  the  condition  for  gaining  this  most  signiﬁcant  and  valuable 
advantage is to perform the obligatory prayers, repent for the sins that were 

ٰ
THIRTEENTH WORD  – SECOND STATION

177

the cause of their imprisonment, and offer thanks in patience. Prison is an 
obstacle to many sins; it provides no opportunity for them.

S e c o n d   P o i n t :  Just as the cessation of pleasure causes pain, so does the 
cessation of pain produce pleasure. Yes, on thinking of past happy, enjoy-
able days, everyone feels a pang of regret and longing and says: “ Alas! ”,  
and  recalling  calamitous,  unhappy  days  of  the  past,  experiences  a  sort  of 
pleasure since they are passed, and declares: “ Praise and thanks be to Allah, 
the calamity has left its reward and departed. ” He breathes a sigh of relief. 
That is to say, an hour’s temporary pain and sorrow leave behind a sort of 
pleasure in the spirit, while a pleasurable hour leaves a pain.

Since the reality is thus; and since past calamitous hours together with 
their  pains  are  no  longer  existent,  and  future  distressing  days  are  at  the 
present time non-existent, and there is no pain from nothing, to continually 
eat bread and drink water today, for example, because of the possibility of 
being hungry and thirsty in several days’ time, is truly foolish. In just the 
same way, to think now of the past and future unhappy hours, which simply 
do  not  exist,  and  to  display  impatience,  and  ignoring  one’s  faulty  self,  to 
moan as though complaining about Allah is also most foolish. So long as 
the power of patience is not scattered to left and right, that is, to the past and 
future, and is held ﬁrm in the face of the present of hour and day, it is suf-
ﬁcient. The distress is reduced from ten to one.

In fact, but let it not be complaining, divine favour pointed out the above 
fact to me while, during a few days of material and spiritual afﬂiction, ill-
ness and trial the like of which I had never before experienced in my life, I 
was being crushed in particular by the despair and distress of the heart and 
spirit which resulted from my being unable to serve the Qur’an and belief 
with  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r .  I  was  then  content  with  my  distressing  illness  and 
imprisonment. For, saying: “ It is great proﬁt for an unfortunate like myself 
who waits at the door of the grave to make one hour which might be passed 
in heedlessness ten hours’ worth of worship, ” I gave thanks.

T h i r d   P o i n t :  There is great gain with little trouble in compassionately 
aiding and assisting prisoners, in giving them the sustenance they need, and 
in soothing their spiritual wounds with consolation. Giving them their food 
which comes from outside is like almsgiving which, exactly to the amount 
of the food, is written in the book of good deeds of those, outside and inside, 
who do this, together with the warders concerned. Especially if the calam-
ity-stricken prisoner is old, ill, poor, or a stranger, then the reward of this 
almsgiving increases many times over.

178

THE WORDS

This high proﬁt is conditional on performing the obligatory prayers so 
that such service is for Allah’s sake. Another condition is to hasten to their 
assistance with sincerity, compassion and joy, and in such a way as to not 
make them feel obliged.

My friends in prison and brothers in religion!
It occurred to me to explain a truth to you which will save you from both 

ّ(cid:127)(cid:170)َا

worldly torment and the torment of the hereafter. It is as follows:

For example, a person killed someone’s brother or one of his relatives. 
A murder which yields one minute’s pleasure at taking revenge causes mil-
lions of minutes of distress for the heart in addition to the anguish of prison. 
While fear at the murdered man’s relatives’ revenge, and anxiety at ﬁnding 
himself face to face with his enemy drives away all his pleasure in life. He 
suffers the torment of both fear and anger. There is only one solution for this 
and that is reconciliation, which the Qur’an commands, and truth, reality, 
beneﬁt, humanity, and Islam require and encourage.

Certainly, what is required in reality is peace, because the appointed hour 
is ﬁxed, it does not change. Since the murdered man’s appointed hour had 
come, in any event he would have stayed no longer. As for the murderer, he 
was the means of Allah’s decree being carried out. So long as there is no rec-
onciliation, both sides perpetually suffer the torments of fear and revenge. 
It is because of this that Islam commands: “ A believer should not be vexed 
with another believer for more than three days. ” 1 If the murder was not the 
result of a vindictive grudge and enmity and a two-faced troublemaker insti-
gated the discord, it is essential to make peace quickly. Otherwise, a minor 
disaster becomes a large one, and continues. If they make peace and the mur-
derer repents and prays continuously for the man he killed, then both sides 
will gain much and become as brothers. In place of one departed brother,

ٰ
THIRTEENTH WORD  – SECOND STATION

he will gain several religious brothers. He will be resigned to divine decree 
and determining and forgive his enemy. Especially since they heed the les-
sons of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , both personal and public peace and well-being, and 
the brotherhood that exists within the fold of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  require that 
they put aside all the hard feelings that exist between them.

It  was  thus  in  Denizli  Prison:  all  the  prisoners  who  were  enemies 
became brothers through the lessons of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . It was one rea-
son for our acquittal and caused even the irreligious and ungodly to say 
about  those  prisoners:  “ M a s h a ’ l l a h !   B a r a k a l l a h !  ”  And  it  was  an  utter 
relief for those prisoners. I myself have seen here a hundred men suffer 
inconvenience  on  account  of  one  man  and  not  go  out  to  take  exercise 
together. It is oppression towards them. A manly believer of sound con-
science will not cause hundreds of other believers harm because of some 
insigniﬁcant and minor error or beneﬁt. If he makes a mistake and does 
cause harm, he should repent immediately.

My loyal new brothers and old prisoners!
I now feel quite certain that in respect of divine favour, you are an impor-
tant cause of our entering here. That is to say, with its consolation and the 
truths of belief, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  will save both you from the distress of this 
calamity of prison and from much worldly harm, and your life from passing 
proﬁtlessly and in vain through grief and sorrow and being wasted on the 
winds of fancy, and your hereafter from weeping like your world is weeping 
now; it will provide you with true solace.

Since the reality of the matter is this, of course you must be brothers to 
one another, like the Denizli prisoners and R i s a l e - i   N u r  students. You can 
see  that  they  examine  all  your  possessions,  food,  bread,  and  soup  which 
come from outside so that a knife does not get in among you and you do 
not attack one another. The warders who faithfully serve you suffer much 
trouble. Also, you do not go out to exercise together, as though you were 
going to attack one another like wild beasts. And so, new friends, who are 
by nature bold and courageous, with great moral courage you should say to 
the group at this time:

ٰ

THE WORDS

“ If not knives, but Mausers and revolvers were given us and the order to 
ﬁre as well, we would not hurt our friends who are unfortunate and suffering 
this calamity like ourselves. Through the guidance and at the command of 
the Qur’an, and belief, and Islamic brotherhood, and our interests, we have 
decided to forgive them and to try not to offend them, even if formerly there 
were a hundred reasons for our enmity and hostility. ” In this way you may 
transform this prison into an auspicious place of study.

An Addendum to the Second Station

An Important Matter
that occurred to my heart on the Night of Power

[ An Addendum to the Second Station of the Thirteenth Word ]

I shall allude brieﬂy to a truly extensive, lengthy truth which occurred to 

my heart on the Night of Power.

Because  of  the  extreme  tyranny  and  despotism  of  this  last  World  War 
and  its  merciless  destruction,  and  hundreds  of  innocents  being  scattered 
and ruined on account of a single enemy, and the awesome despair of the 
defeated, and the fearsome alarm of the victors and their ghastly pangs of 
conscience  arising  from  the  supremacy  they  are  unable  to  maintain  and 
the  destruction  they  are  unable  to  repair,  and  the  utter  transitoriness  and 
ephemerality of the life of this world and the deceptive, opiate nature of the 
fantasies of civilization becoming apparent to all, and the exalted abilities 
lodged in human nature and the human essence being wounded in universal, 
awesome manner, and man’s innate love and desire for immortality being 
aroused and awakened, and heedlessness and misguidance and deaf, lifeless 
nature being smashed by the diamond sword of the Qur’an, and the exceed-
ingly ugly, exceedingly cruel true face of world politics becoming apparent, 
which is the widest and most suffocating and deceptive cover for heedless-
ness and misguidance, most certainly and without any shadow of a doubt, 
since the life of this world – which is the metaphorical beloved of human-
kind – is thus ugly and transient, inborn human nature will search with all its 
strength for eternal life, which it truly loves and yearns for, just as there are 
signs of this occurring in the North, the West, and in America.

Most  certainly  there  is  also  no  doubt  that  since  the  Qur’an  of  Miracu-
lous  Exposition,  which  each  century  for  one  thousand  three  hundred  and 
sixty  years  has  had  three  hundred  and  ﬁfty  million  students,  and  sets  the 
seal on each of its pronouncements and claims through the afﬁrmation of 
millions of profound, veracious scholars, and each minute has been present 
with its sacredness in the hearts of millions of haﬁz’s and given instruction 
to humankind through their tongues, and which in a way unmatched by any 
other book conveys the good news of eternal life and everlasting happiness 
to humankind and heals all its wounds, – since the Qur’an has given this cer-
tain good news of eternal life and happiness with thousands of its insistent, 

182

THE WORDS

powerful and repeated verses, and with its certain unshakeable proofs and 
innumerable  indubitable  arguments  which  invite  and  give  news  explicitly 
and implicitly tens of thousands of times, so long as humanity does  not alto-
gether lose its mind and a material or immaterial doomsday does not erupt 
over its head, the broad masses and great states in the world will search out 
the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition,  and  having  grasped  its  truths,  will 
embrace  it  with  all  their  lives  and  spirits,  just  as  there  are  [ now ]  famous 
preachers  in  Sweden,  Norway,  Finland  and  England  working  to  have  the 
Qur’an accepted, and the important community of America is searching for 
the true religion. Because in view of this fact, the Qur’an by no means has 
– nor can have – any equal. Absolutely nothing can take the place of this 
greatest miracle.

Secondly: The R i s a l e - i   N u r  performs the duty perfectly, for it is a dia-
mond sword in the hand of this greatest miracle and has compelled its stub-
born enemies to submit. It acts as a herald to the treasures of the Qur’an 
in a fashion that illuminates and heals completely the heart, the spirit, and 
the emotions, and has no source or authority other than the Qur’an and is 
its miracle. 

Furthermore it has completely routed the obstinate atheists and their fear-
some propaganda against it, and smashed to pieces with the treatise N a t u r e :  
C a u s e   o r   E f f e c t ?  nature, which is the most impregnable bastion of misguid-
ance, and, with the Sixth Topic of the treatise T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f  together 
with the First, Second, Third and Eighth Proofs all of which are included in 
the book T h e   S t a f f   o f   M o s e s , has banished heedlessness in brilliant fashion 
in its most dense, suffocating, and extensive form beneath the wide-reaching 
veils of science and has demonstrated the light of divine unity.

For sure, since religious instruction is now ofﬁcially permitted and per-
mission has been given to open private places of study, it is necessary for us 
and essential for the nation that, as far as is possible, students of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  should open a small R i s a l e - i   N u r  study centre in every place. Although 
everyone  would  beneﬁt  to  some  extent,  not  everyone  would  understand 
every  matter  completely.  But  since  these  matters  are  explanations  of  the 
truths of belief, they are both learning, and knowledge of Allah, and lead to 
a sense of Allah’s presence, and are worship.

Allah  willing,  these  R i s a l e - i   N u r   ‘medreses’  will  secure  in  ﬁve  to  ten 
weeks the results that the former medreses produced in ﬁve to ten years – 
and they have been so doing for twenty years.

THIRTEENTH WORD  – SECOND STATION

Also,  it  is  essential  that  the  government  does  not  interfere  with  these 
ﬂashes of the Qur’an, the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which is the Qur’an’s herald and is 
beneﬁcial in many ways for the worldly and political life of this nation and 
country, and for its life in the hereafter. Indeed, it should work for its total 
spread and acceptance, so that it may atone for the grievous sins of the past, 
and form a barrier to the severe trials and anarchy of the future.

[ This consists of a single, brief proof of the pillar of belief, Belief in 
Allah, for which there are numerous decisive proofs and explanations 
in the R i s a l e - i   N u r . ]

In Kastamonu a group of high-school students came to me, saying: “ Tell 
us about our Creator, our teachers do not speak of Allah. ” I said to them: 
All the sciences you study continuously speak of Allah and make known the 
Creator, each with its own particular tongue. Do not listen to your teachers; 
listen to them.

For  example,  a  well-equipped  pharmacy  with  life-giving  potions  and 
cures  in  every  jar  weighed  out  in  precise  and  wondrous  measures  doubt-
less shows an extremely skilful, practised, and wise pharmacist. In the same 
way, to the extent that it is bigger and more perfect and better stocked than 
the pharmacy in the marketplace, the pharmacy of the globe of the earth with 
its living potions and medicaments in the jars which are the four hundred 
thousand species of plants and animals shows and makes known to eyes that 
are blind even – by means of the measure or scale of the science of medicine 
that you study – the All-Wise One of Glory, Who is the Pharmacist of the 
mighty pharmacy of the earth. 

To take another example: a wondrous factory which weaves thousands 
of sorts of cloth from a simple material doubtless makes known a manufac-
turer and skilful mechanic. In the same way, to whatever extent it is larger 
and more perfect than the human factory, this travelling dominical machine 
known  as  the  globe  of  the  earth  with  its  hundreds  of  thousands  of  heads, 
in each of which are hundreds of thousands of factories, shows and makes 
known  –  by  means  of  the  measure  or  scale  of  the  science  of  engineering 
which you study – its Manufacturer and Owner.

And,  for  example,  a  depot,  store,  or  shop  in  which  has  been  brought 
together  and  stored  up  in  regular  and  orderly  fashion  a  thousand  and  one 
varieties of provisions undoubtedly makes known a wondrous owner, pro-
prietor, and overseer of provisions and foodstuffs. In just the same way, to 
whatever degree it is vaster and more perfect than such a store or factory, 
this foodstore of the Most Merciful One known as the globe of the earth, 
this divine ship, this dominical depot and shop holding goods, equipment,

and conserved food, which in one year travels regularly an orbit of twenty-
four thousand years, and carrying groups of beings requiring different  foods 
and passing through the seasons on its journey and ﬁlling the spring with 
thousands  of  different  provisions  like  a  huge  waggon,  brings  them  to  the 
wretched animate creatures whose sustenance has been exhausted in winter, 
– by means of the measure or scale of the science of economics which you 
study – this depot of the earth makes known and makes loved its Manager, 
Organizer, and Owner.

And, for example, let us imagine an army which consists of four hun-
dred thousand nations, and each nation requires different provisions, uses 
different  weapons,  wears  different  uniforms,  undergoes  different  drill, 
and is discharged from its duties differently. If this army and camp has a 
miracle-working  commander  who  on  his  own  provides  all  those  different 
nations  with  all  their  different  provisions,  weapons,  uniforms,  and  equip-
ment without forgetting or confusing any of them, then surely the army and 
camp show the commander and make him loved appreciatively. In just the 
same way, the spring camp of the face of the earth in which every spring a 
newly recruited divine army of the four hundred thousand species of plants 
and  animals  are  given  their  varying  uniforms,  rations,  weapons,  training, 
and demobilizations in utterly perfect and regular fashion by a single Com-
mander-in-Chief  Who  forgets  or  confuses  not  one  of  them  –  to  whatever 
extent the spring camp of the face of the earth is vaster and more perfect than 
that human army, – by means of the measure or scale of the military science 
that you study – it makes known to the attentive and sensible, its Ruler, Sus-
tainer, Administrator, and Most Holy Commander, causing wonderment and 
acclaim, and makes Him loved and praised and gloriﬁed.

Another example: millions of electric lights that move and travel through 
a wondrous city, their fuel and power source never being exhausted, self-
evidently make known a wonder-working craftsman and extraordinarily tal-
ented electrician who manages the electricity, makes the moving lamps, sets 
up the power source, and brings the fuel; they cause others to congratulate 
and applaud him, and to love him. In just the same way, although some of 
the lamps of the stars in the roof of the palace of the world in the city of 
the universe – if they are considered in the way that astronomy says – are a 
thousand times larger than the earth and move seventy times faster than a 
cannonball, they do not spoil their order, nor collide with one another, nor 
become extinguished, nor is their fuel exhausted. According to astronomy, 
which you study, for our sun to continue burning, which is a million times 

186

THE WORDS

larger than the earth and a million times older and is a lamp and stove in one 
guesthouse of the Most Merciful One, as much oil as the seas of the earth 
and as much coal as its mountains or as many logs and much wood as as a 
thousand earths are necessary for it not to be  extinguished. And however 
much greater and more perfect than this example are the electric lamps of 
the palace of the world in the majestic city of the universe, which point with 
their ﬁngers of light to an inﬁnite power and sovereignty which illuminates 
the sun and other lofty stars like it without oil, wood, or coal, not allowing 
them  to  be  extinguished  or  to  collide  with  one  another,  though  travelling 
together at speed, to that degree – by means of the measure of the science 
of electricity which you either study or will study – they testify to and make 
known the Monarch, Illuminator, Director, and Maker of the mighty exhibi-
tion of the universe; they make Him loved, gloriﬁed, and worshipped.

And, for example, take a book in every line of which a whole book is 
ﬁnely written, and in every word of which a sura of the Qur’an is inscribed 
with a ﬁne pen. Being most meaningful with all of its matters corroborat-
ing one another and a wondrous collection showing its writer and author 
to be extraordinarily skilful and capable, it undoubtedly shows its writer 
and author together with all his perfections and arts as clearly as daylight, 
and makes him known. It makes him appreciated with phrases like, “ What 
wonders Allah has willed! ” and, “ Blessed be Allah! ” Just the same is the 
mighty book of the universe; we see with our eyes a pen at work which 
writes on the face of the earth, which is a single of its pages, and on the 
spring, which is a single folio, the three hundred thousand plant and ani-
mal  species,  which  are  like  three  hundred  thousand  different  books,  all 
together, one within the other, without fault or error, without mixing them 
up or confusing them, perfectly and with complete order, and sometimes 
writes an ode in a word like a tree, and the complete index of a book in a 
point like a seed. However much vaster and more perfect and meaningful 
than the book in the example mentioned above is this compendium of the 
universe and mighty embodied Qur’an of the world, which is inﬁnitely full 
of meaning and in every word of which are numerous instances of wisdom, 
to that degree – in accordance with the extensive measure and far-seeing 
vision of the natural science that you study and the sciences of reading and 
writing that you have practised at school – it makes known the Inscriber 
and Author of the book of the universe together with His inﬁnite perfec-
tions. Proclaiming ‘Allah is Most Great!’, it makes Him known. Uttering 
words like ‘Glory be to Allah!’, it describes Him. Uttering praises like ‘All 
praise be to Allah!’, it makes Him loved.

Thus,  hundreds  of  other  sciences  like  these  make  known  the  Glorious 
Creator  of  the  universe  together  with  His  names,  each  through  its  broad 
measure  or  scale,  its  particular  mirror,  its  far-seeing  eyes,  and  searching 
gaze; they make known His attributes and perfections.

It is in order to give instruction in this matter, which is a brilliant and magnif-
icent proof of divine unity, that the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition teaches 
us about our Creator most often with the verses,  ( 13:16 ) P O  N 
and, ( 6:1 ) J I H I said this to the schoolboys, and they accepted 
it completely, afﬁrming it by saying: “ Endless thanks be to Allah, for we 
have received an absolutely true and sacred lesson. May Allah be pleased 
with you! ” So I said:

Man is a living machine who is grieved by thousands of different sorrows 
and receives pleasure in thousands of different ways; and despite his utter 
impotence has innumerable enemies, physical and spiritual; and despite his 
inﬁnite poverty, has countless needs, external and inner; and is a wretched 
creature  continuously  suffering  the  blows  of  death  and  separation.  Yet, 
through belief and worship, he at once becomes connected to a Monarch so 
Glorious he ﬁnds a point of support against all his enemies and a source of 
help for all his needs, and like everyone takes pride at the honour and rank 
of  the  lord  to  whom  he  is  attached,  you  can  compare  for  yourselves  how 
pleased and grateful and thankful and full of pride man becomes at being 
connected through belief to an inﬁnitely Powerful and Compassionate Mon-
arch, at entering His service through worship, and transforming for himself 
the  announcement  of  the  execution  of  the  appointed  hour  into  the  papers 
releasing him from duty.

I repeat to the calamity-stricken prisoners what I said to the schoolboys: 
The person who recognizes Him and obeys Him is fortunate even if he is 
in prison. While one who forgets Him is wretched and a prisoner even if 
he  resides  in  a  palace.  Even,  one  wronged  but  fortunate  man  said  to  the 
wretched  tyrants  who  were  executing  him:  “ I  am  not  being  executed  but 
being demobilized and departing for where I shall ﬁnd happiness. But I see 
that you are being condemned to eternal execution and am therefore taking 
َ(cid:202) , he happily surrendered 
perfect revenge on you. ” And declaring: ُ

My Very Dear and Loyal Brothers!
My brothers, I observed in a subtle point concerning Allah’s unity, which 
suddenly became clear while studying the page of the air on a journey of 
the  imagination  and  mind,  that  is,  in  the  word  ‘He’  (  وُ(cid:182)  )  in  the  phrases 
# " ! ( 112:1 ) , and Ö Õ Ô Ó ( 2:163, 3:2, 59:22 ) , – and that was only in 
its material aspect – that the way of belief is inﬁnitely easy, easy to the point 
of being necessary, and that the way of misguidance and associating part-
ners with Allah is inﬁnitely difﬁcult, so difﬁcult as to be impossible. I shall 
explain that long and extensive point with an extremely brief indication.

Yes, if soil, one handful of which can act as a ﬂowerpot for hundreds of 
plants in turn, is attributed to nature or causes, it becomes necessary either 
for there to be present in such a handful hundreds of immaterial machines, 
indeed, machines and factories to the number of the plants, or for each par-
ticle of that small amount of soil to know how to make all those different 
plants together with their different characteristics and living organs; quite 
simply, each would have to possess inﬁnite knowledge and limitless power 
like a god.

The same is true for the air, which is a place of maximum manifestation 
of the divine will and command: either there would have to be present on 
a minute scale in each of its molecules, in each waft of wind, each breath, 
and in the tiny amount air expended with the word (  وُ(cid:182)  ), the innumerable 
different exchanges, centres, receivers and transmitters of all the telephones, 
telegraphs and radios in the world so that each could perform those innu-
merable acts at the same time; or else, each particle of each molecule of air 
exhaled  with  (  وُ(cid:182)  ),  and  indeed  of  the  element  air,  would  have  to  possess 
abilities and personalities to the number of all the different telephone users, 
telegraphers, and those who speak on the radio, and know all their different 

ٰ
THIRTEENTH WORD  – SECOND STATION

189

languages and broadcast them to the other particles at the same time. For 
such a situation is actually apparent and every bit of air possesses that abil-
ity. Thus, in the ways of the unbelievers, naturalists, and materialists not one 
impossibility, but impossibilities and difﬁculties are clearly apparent to the 
number of molecules of air.

If attributed to the All-Glorious Maker, however, the air together with all 
its particles becomes a soldier under His command. With its Creator’s per-
mission and through His power, and through being connected to its Creator 
and relying on Him, and through the manifestation of its Maker’s power, in 
an instant with the speed of lightning and with the ease of uttering the word 
(  وُ(cid:182)  ) and the movement of the air in waves, its innumerable universal duties 
are performed as easily as an orderly, single duty of a single particle. That 
is  to  say,  the  air  becomes  a  page  for  the  endless,  wonderful,  and  orderly 
writings of the pen of power, and its particles become the nibs of the pen, 
and their duties the points inscribed by it. The air functions as easily as the 
movement of a single particle. 

Thus,  while  on  my  journey  of  contemplation  prompted  by  the  phrases 
Ö Õ Ô Ó  and,  # " !  and  while  observing  the  world  of  the  air  and 
studying  the  page  of  that  element,  I  witnessed  this  brief  truth  with  utter 
certainty  and  clarity,  and  in  detail.  And  I  understood  with  knowledge  of 
certainty that it was because there is in the word (  وُ(cid:182)  ), in the air of its utter-
ance, such a brilliant proof and ﬂash of divine unity; and also in its meaning 
and allusions such a luminous manifestation of divine oneness and powerful 
proof of divine unity; and in that proof an indication that since the pronoun 
(  وُ(cid:182)  ) is unconditional and indeﬁnite, it suggests the question, “ Who does 
it refer to? ”; that both the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition and those who 
constantly recite the divine names frequently repeat this sacred word in the 
station of unity.

If, for example, there is one point on a piece of white paper and two or 
three other points are jumbled around with it and then someone who already 
has numerous jobs tries to distinguish them, he will be confused; and if many 
burdens are loaded on a small creature, it will be crushed; and if numerous 
words issue from one tongue and enter one ear altogether at the same time, 
their order will be broken and they will all be a muddle.

Despite this being the case, I saw with complete certainty that with the 
key and compass of (  وُ(cid:182)  ), although thousands of different points, letters and 

190

THE WORDS

words had been put in each molecule – and even in each particle – of the 
element air, through which I journeyed in my mind, neither did they become 
mixed up nor did they spoil their order; and although they performed a great 
many different duties, these were carried out without being confused in any 
way; and although very heavy loads were laid on each molecule and particle, 
they bore them in order without lagging or displaying any weakness at all. 
And I saw that thousands of different words of all different sorts enter and 
issue with perfect order from what is in effect those minute ears and tongues 
without  being  mixed  up  and  spoilt  in  any    way,  they  enter  those  minute 
ears  and  issue  from  those  tiny  tongues,  and  by  performing  these  extraor-
dinary duties, each particle and each molecule declares through the enrap-
tured tongue of its being and its perfect freedom, and through the testimony 
and tongue of the above truth: Ö Õ Ô Ó and, $ # " ! and travels 
among such air-clashing waves as storms and lightning and thunder without 
in any way spoiling their order or confusing their duties; one duty is not an 
obstacle to another duty. I observed this with the vision of certainty. 

That is to say, either every particle and piece of the air has to possess 
inﬁnite  wisdom,  knowledge,  will,  and  power,  and  the  qualities  for  being 
absolutely dominant over all the other particles so that it can be the means 
of those functions being carried out, which is absurd and impossible to the 
number of particles, and no devil even could imagine it, or else – and it is 
self-evident to the degree of knowledge of certainty, vision of certainty, and 
absolute certainty – that the page of the air functions through the boundless, 
inﬁnite  knowledge  and  wisdom  of  the  All-Glorious  One,  and  is  the  pro-
tean page for the pen of divine power and determining, and like a signboard 
for writing and erasing, known as a Tablet of Appearance and Dissolution, 
which has the function of the Preserved Tablet in the world of transforma-
tion and change.

Thus, just as the element of air demonstrates the above-mentioned won-
ders and manifestation of divine unity in only the duty of transmitting sound 
and  shows  the  impossibilities  of  misguidance,  so  does  it  perform  other 
important duties with order and without confusing them, such as transmit-
ting subtle forces and energy, like electricity, light, and the forces of attrac-
tion and repulsion. At the same time as conveying these, with perfect order, 
it  carries  out  duties  essential  for  the  lives  of  plants  and  animals,  such  as 
respiration and pollination. It proves in decisive fashion that it is a place of 
maximum manifestation ( throne ) of the divine will and command. I came to 
the ﬁrm conclusion that it proves with the vision of certainty that in no way 

THIRTEENTH WORD  – SECOND STATION

191

is there any possibility of vagrant chance, blind force, deaf nature, confused 
and  aimless  causes,  and  powerless,  lifeless,  unknowing  matter  interfering 
in the writing and duties of the page of the air. And I understood that every 
particle and part of it declares with the tongue of its being: Ö Õ Ô Ó and, 
$ # " ! Just as with the key of (  وُ(cid:182)  ) I saw these wonders in the 
material aspect of the air, so also, as a (  وُ(cid:182)  ), did the element air become a 
key to the World of Similitudes and the World of Meaning.

I  saw  that  the  World  of  Similitudes  is  all  the  time  taking  innumerable 
photographs  without  confusing  them,  and  that  each  photograph  contains  
innumerable events occurring in this world. I understood that it was a gigan-
tic  camera,  and  a  vast  cinema  of  the  hereafter  thousands  of  times  larger 
than  the  world  for  showing  in  eternal  theatres  the  fruits  of  the  transitory 
and impermanent states and lives of ephemeral beings, for showing to those 
enjoying everlasting bliss in Paradise scenes from their old memories and 
adventures in this world. 1

While the faculties of memory and imagination, which are two proofs, 
two small examples, and two points of both the Preserved Tablet and the 
World of Similitudes situated in man’s head, are as tiny as lentils, within 
them  are  written  in  perfect  order  and  without  being  mixed  up  as  much 
information as may be contained in a large library. This proves decisively 
that  large  examples  of  those  faculties  are  the  World  of  Similitudes  and 
the Preserved Tablet. It proves too decisively and makes known with the 
knowledge  of  certainty  that  the  World  of  Similitudes  and  the  Preserved 
Tablet are written with the pen of divine determining and power, with far 
more wisdom and will than the elements of air and water and particularly 
seminal ﬂuid and the element of earth, and that it is completely impossible 
for chance, blind force, deaf nature, or lifeless and aimless causes to inter-
fere in them, and that they are a page of the pen of power and wisdom of 
the All-Wise One of Glory.

[ In  order  to  ascend  to  some  of  the  elevated  truths  of  the  All-Wise 
Qur’an, and of Hadiths, which are the true expounder of the Qur’an, 
we shall point out a number of comparisons of those step-like truths to 
assist hearts deﬁcient in submission and obedience, and shall explain 
in  the  conclusion  an  object  lesson  and  a  mystery  concerning  divine 
favour. From among those truths, comparisons of the Resurrection and 
Day of Judgement are given in the Tenth Word and its Ninth Truth in 
particular, so there is no need to repeat them. Here we shall mention 
only ﬁve matters as examples of the other truths. ]

THE FIRST: For example, the verse,

 ( 7:54 ) ^ ] \ [ Z Y 
With these Qur’anic days, which consist of a long period of time like per-
haps  a  thousand  or  ﬁfty  thousand  years,  this  verse  alludes  to  the  fact  the 
world of human beings and of the animals will last six days. So in order to 
induce certainty about this elevated truth, we draw attention to the travel-
ling worlds, transient universes, and passing cosmoses which the Glorious 
Maker creates every day, every year, every century, each of which is like a 
day. It is as though these worlds are all guests like man. At the All-Glorious 
One’s command, each season the world is ﬁlled and emptied.

THE SECOND: For example, the verses,

    ( 6:59 ) Þ Ý Ü Û Ú Ù Ø × 
 ] \ [ Z Y X W V     ( 36:12 ) ¾ ½ ¼ » º ¹
( 34:3 ) i h g f e d c b a ` _ ^

192

FOURTEENTH WORD

193

These verses state that all things together with all their states are recorded 
before they come into existence, when they come into existence, and after 
they  have  departed,  and  that  they  are  being  recorded.  In  order  to  be  con-
vinced  of  this  elevated  truth,  we  point  out  to  be  observed  the  following. 
The  All-Glorious  Inscriber  includes  and  preserves  in  immaterial  fashion 
in the seeds and roots of the innumerable well-ordered creatures which He 
changes every season on the page of the earth and particularly in the spring, 
the indexes of their beings, their life histories, and the principles according 
to  which  they  act.  And  when  they  die  He  inscribes  in  immaterial  fashion 
with  the  same  pen  of  divine  determining  those  indexes,  life-histories  and 
principles in the simple seeds in their fruits. And every passing spring even 
He preserves them – whether fresh or dry – in perfect order in seeds resem-
bling dry chips of wood and bones, limited and tiny. It is as if each spring 
is  attached  like  a ﬂower  to  the  face  of  the  earth  in  extremely  orderly  and 
balanced fashion by the hand of One All-Beautiful and All-Glorious, then 
is plucked from it; each is placed on it, then removed. While the reality is 
this, one of the strangest forms of man’s misguidance is that he calls this 
natural writing, this artful inscribing, this passive pattern of wisdom which 
is an index of dominical art and only a reﬂection and manifestation of the 
Preserved Tablet, “ nature, ” and considers it to be the source and active and 
effective. اَ
ّ(cid:103)(cid:170)ا  َنِ(cid:174) ىَرَ
ّ(cid:103)(cid:170)ا  َنْ(cid:192)َا  Can there be any comparison between reality 
and the notions of the heedless?

ّ(cid:192)َرُ

THE THIRD: For example, the Bringer of Sure News stated concerning 
the Bearers of the Throne, the angels appointed to the earth and the skies, 
and other sorts of angels, that they glorify Allah with forty thousand heads, 
and  with  the  forty  thousand  tongues  in  each  head,  and  in  forty  thousand 
ways with each tongue. In order to ascend to this truth, consider the follow-
ing carefully. With verses like,

    ( 17:44 ) h g f e d c b 
   ( 38:18 ) 4 3 2 1 0 / .
( 33:72 ) ¶ μ ´ ³ ² ± °
the  All-Glorious  One  expresses  clearly  that  even  the  greatest  and  most 
universal of beings demonstrate that they glorify Him in accordance with 
their universality and in a way appropriate to their vastness. It appears to be 
thus. Just as the words of gloriﬁcation of the heavens, which are an ocean 

194

THE WORDS

glorifying Allah, are the suns, moons, and stars, so the words of praise of 
the earth, a ﬂying thing praising and glorifying, are the animals,  plants and 
trees. That is to say, just as the trees and stars all perform particular forms 
of gloriﬁcation, so do the earth and every part of the earth, and all the moun-
tains and valleys, and the land and the sea, and the spheres of the ﬁrmament 
and the constellations in the heavens all perform universal forms of gloriﬁ-
cation. The earth possesses these thousands of heads containing thousands 
of  tongues,  and  certainly  has  an  angel  appointed  to  it  who  translates  and 
displays in the World of Similitudes the ﬂowers of gloriﬁcation and fruits of 
praise it performs with each, and who represents and proclaims them in the 
World of Spirits.

Indeed, if numerous things take on the form of a collectivity, a collec-
tive personality comes into being. If such a collectivity fuses and becomes 
a unity, it will have a collective personality and a sort of spirit which will 
represent it, and an appointed angel who will perform its duty of gloriﬁca-
tion.  As  an  example,  consider  the  plane  tree  in  front  of  my  room  here,  a 
mighty word in the mouth of Barla and the tongue of this mountain: see how 
many hundreds of tongues of smaller branches there are on the three heads 
of the three main branches of its trunk. Study carefully how many hundreds 
of words of well-ordered and balanced fruits it has, and how many hundreds 
of letters of well-proportioned winged seeds: just as you hear and see how 
eloquently it praises and gloriﬁes the All-Glorious Maker, the Owner of the 
command of ( 36:82 ) ² ± , so too the angel appointed to it represents 
its gloriﬁcation with numerous tongues in the World of Meaning. Wisdom 
necessitates that it is so.

THE FOURTH: For example, consider the elevated truth expressed by 

such verses as:

    ( 36:82 ) Å Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ 
    ( 50:16 ) / . - , + *    ( 16:77 ) ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ £
 ( 70:4 ) À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ » º ¹ ¸ ¶ μ
The truth is this: the Absolutely Powerful One creates things with such ease 
and  speed,  with  no  direct  or  physical  contact,  that  it  appears  that  He  cre-
ates with a mere command, and this is understood. Also, although the All-
Powerful Maker is inﬁnitely close to beings, they are inﬁnitely distant from 
him. Furthermore, despite His inﬁnite might and glory, He sets in order the 

FOURTEENTH WORD

195

most insigniﬁcant and lowly matters attaching importance to them, and does 
not deny them the beauty of His art. Thus, the perfect order within absolute 
ease observed in beings testiﬁes to the existence of this Qur’anic truth. The 
following comparison demonstrates its meaning and wisdom. For example, 
( 16:60 )  j  i  h , despite  being a dense mirror to the divine name of 
Light among the All-Glorious Maker’s most beautiful names, the duties the 
sun displays through the dominical command and divine subjugation, bring 
this truth closer to the understanding. It is as follows.

Together with its loftiness, the sun is inﬁnitely close to all transparent 
and shining things, indeed, is closer to them than their own selves, and it 
has an effect on them in numerous ways such as through its manifestation, 
its image, and power of disposal, yet those transparent objects are thousands 
of years distant from it, they can in no way have an effect on it, they cannot 
claim to be close to it. Also, the fact that the sun’s is as though present and 
seeing in all transparent particles, wherever its light enters even, is under-
stood  by  reason  of  its  reﬂection  and  image  being  apparent  in  accordance 
with the particles’ capacities and colours. Furthermore, the sun’s compre-
hensiveness and penetration increase to the vast extent of its luminosity. It is 
because of the greatness of its luminosity that the tiniest things cannot hide 
or escape from it. This means that by virtue of the mystery of luminosity its 
immense vastness does not exclude even insigniﬁcant and tiny things; on the 
contrary, it takes them within the sphere of its comprehension. Moreover, if 
to suppose the impossible we were to imagine that the sun acted with will 
in the tasks and manifestations its displays, with divine permission it would 
function in everything from particles and droplets and the surface of the sea 
to the planets with such ease and speed and breadth that one would suppose 
that  it  performed  these  mighty  disposals  at  a  mere  command.  A  particle 
and a planet would be equal in the face of its command. The effulgence it 
bestowed on the surface of the sea it would bestow also with perfect order 
on a particle in accordance with the particle’s capacity.

Thus, we see that the sun, which is a luminous bubble in the seas of the 
skies and a small, dense mirror to the manifestation of the Absolutely Pow-
erful One’s name of Light, observedly displays examples of the three princi-
ples of this truth. So we surely believe with complete certainty as though wit-
nessing it that the All-Glorious One, Who is ِروُ
ّ(cid:179)(cid:170)ا ُروُ(cid:178) 
and in comparison to Whose knowledge and power the sun’s light and heat 
is as dense as earth, is all-present and all-seeing and inﬁnitely close to all

things  with  His  knowledge  and  power,  and  that  things  are  utterly  distant 
from  Him,  and  that  He  does  things  with  such  ease  and  facility  that  it  is 
understood He creates with the ease and speed of a mere command, and that 
nothing at all, great or small, particular or universal, can escape from the 
sphere of His power, and that His magniﬁcence encompasses all things. And 
this has to be believed.

THE FIFTH: The limits of the vastness of the Monarch of Pre-Eternity 
and  Post-Eternity’s  dominicality  and  the  tremendousness  of  His  Godhead 
stretch from,

So  what  is  the  purpose  of  His  stern  complaints  and  severe  and  awesome 
threats in the Qur’an against the sons of Adam, so impotent and inﬁnitely 
weak and utterly poor and endlessly needy, who possess only partial will 
and have no power to create? In what way is it conformable and how is it 
appropriate? To be convinced of this profound and elevated truth, consider 
the following two comparisons.

FOURTEENTH WORD

197

First Comparison: For example, there was a royal garden in which were 
found innumerable fruit-bearing and ﬂowering plants. Many servants were 
appointed to attend to it. The duty of one of the servants was only to open 
the water canal so that the water could spread throughout the garden and be 
beneﬁted from. But the servant was lazy and failed to open the canal, so the 
plants’ growth of the garden was impaired, or else they dried up. The rest 
of the servants had the right to complain, not about the Creator’s dominical 
art and the Sultan’s royal supervision and the obedient service of the light, 
air, and earth, but about the foolish servant, for all their duties were rendered 
fruitless, or were impeded.

Second  Comparison:  For  example,  if,  by  abandoning  his  minor  duty 
on a mighty royal ship, a common man causes harm to come to the results 
of the duties of all the others employed on the ship, and some of the duties 
come to nothing even, the ship’s owner will complain bitterly about him in 
the name of all the others. The one at fault may not then say: “ I’m just an 
ordinary person. I don’t deserve such severity because of my unimportant 
omission. ”  For  a  single  instance  of  non-existence  results  in  innumerable 
such  instances,  whereas  existence  yields  results  in  accordance  with  itself. 
For although the existence of a thing is dependent on the existence of all 
the  conditions  and  causes,  its  non-existence,  its  removal,  occurs  with  the 
removal of a single condition and results from the non-existence of a single 
particular. It is because of this that ‘destruction is very often much easier 
than  construction’  is  virtually  a  universally  accepted  principle.  Since  the 
bases of unbelief and misguidance and of rebellion and sin are denial and 
rejection,  they  are  an  abandoning  and  non-acceptance.  However  positive 
and possessing of existence they appear to be superﬁcially, in reality they 
are extinction and non-existence. In which case they are a contagious crime. 
Just as they harm the consequences of other beings’ acts, so they draw a veil 
over the manifestation of the beauties of the divine names.

The  Monarch  of  Beings,  Whose  right  it  is  to  make  these  innumerable 
complaints,  therefore  utters  awesome  complaints  about  rebellious  man  in 
the name of those beings. To do so is perfect wisdom. Rebellious man is 
certainly  deserving  of  His  severe  and  awesome  threats;  without  doubt  he 
deserves them.

[ A slap for the heedless and a warning lesson ]

O my wretched soul sunk in heedlessness, which sees this life as sweet, 
has forgotten the hereafter, and seeks only this world! Do you know what 
you resemble? An ostrich! It sees the hunter but cannot ﬂy, so sticks it head 
in the sand so that the hunter will not see it. Its bulky body remains in the 
open and the hunter sees it. But its eyes are closed in the sand and it cannot 
see him. O my soul, consider the following comparison, and see it!

Restricting  one’s  view  to  this  world  transforms  a  great  pleasure  into  a 
grievous  pain.  For  example,  there  are  two  men  in  this  village,  that  is,  in 
Barla. Ninety-nine out of a hundred of the friends of one of them have gone 
to  Istanbul,  where  they  are  living  in  ﬁne  fashion.  Only  one  has  remained 
here and he too will go there. For this reason, the man longs for Istanbul 
and thinks of it; he wants to join his friends. When he is told to go there, 
he is overjoyed and goes happily. As for the second man, ninety-nine of his 
friends have departed from here, but some have perished and others have 
been put in places where they neither see nor are seen. He imagines that they 
have departed and disappeared in utter misery. The wretched man becomes 
friendly with one single guest in place of all of them, and wants to ﬁnd con-
solation. Through him he wants to forget the grievous pain of separation.

O  my  soul!  Foremost  Allah’s  Beloved  ( UWBP ),  and  all  your  friends, 
are beyond the grave. The one or two who remain will also depart for there. 
So do not be frightened of death, anxious at the grave, and avert your head. 
Look manfully at the grave, and listen to what it seeks. Laugh in death’s face 
bravely, and see what it wants. Beware, do not be heedless and resemble the 
second man.

O  my  soul!  Do  not  say,  “ The  times  have  changed,  this  age  is  differ-
ent, everyone is plunged into this world and worships this life. Everyone is 

FOURTEENTH WORD

drunk with the struggle for livelihood. ” For death does not change. Sepa-
ration is not transformed into permanence and does not become different. 
Man’s impotence and poverty do not change, they increase. Man’s journey 
is not cut, it becomes faster.

Also, do not say, “ I am like everyone else. ” For everyone befriends you 
only as far as the grave, and the consolation of being together with every-
one else in disaster has no meaning beyond the grave. And do not suppose 
yourself to be free and independent. For if you look at this guesthouse of 
the world with the eye of wisdom, you will see that nothing at all is without 
order and without purpose. How can you remain outside the order and be 
without purpose? Such events in the world as earthquakes are not the play-
things  of  chance.  For  example,  you  see  that  the  extremely  orderly,  ﬁnely 
embroidered shirts, one over the other and one within the other, which are 
clothed on the earth from the species of animals and plants, are adorned and 
decked out from top to bottom with purposes and instances of wisdom, and 
you know that the earth revolves and is turned like an ecstatic Mevlevi in 
perfect order within most exalted aims. How is it then, as an atheist pub-
lished,  they  suppose  to  be  without  purpose  and  the  result  of  chance  such 
death-tainted events of the earth as the earthquake? 1 It resembled the earth’s 
shaking off itself the weight of certain forms of humankind’s heedlessness 
of which it disapproves, and especially that of the believers? How is it that 
they show the grievous losses of the stricken to be without recompense and 
to  have  gone  for  nothing,  so  casting  them  into  a  fearsome  despair?  They 
are both making a great error and perpetrating a great wrong. Indeed, such 
events occur at the command of One All-Wise and All-Compassionate, so 
as to transform the transient property of the believers into the equivalent of 
alms, and make it permanent. And they are atonement for their sins arising 
from ingratitude for bounties. Just as a day will come when this subjugated 
earth will see the works of man, which are the adornment of its face, to be 
tainted  by  the  attributing  of  partners  to  Allah  and  not  to  be  the  cause  of 
thanks, and it will ﬁnd them ugly. At the Creator’s command, it will wipe 
them off its entire face and cleanse it. At Allah’s command, it will pour those 
who attribute partners to Allah into Hell, and say to those who offer thanks, 
“ Come and enter Paradise! ”

( 99:1-5 ) N M L K  *    I H G

This sura states deﬁnitely that in its movements and earthquakes the earth 
shakes at a command, on receiving revelation and inspiration. And some-
times it trembles.

[ Prompted by an inspiration, the answers occurred to me to six or seven 
minor  questions  related  to  the  current  earthquakes,  importantly  from 
the  point  of  view  of  their  meaning.  Although  on  several  occasions  I 
intended to write them in detail, permission was not given, so they have 
been written brieﬂy and in short. ]

First Question: More distressing than the material disaster of the present 
severe earthquake are its immaterial aspects: the despair and fear of further 
earthquakes  are  destroying  the  nightly  rest  of  most  of  the  people  in  most 
areas. What is the reason for this terrible torment?

T h e   A n s w e r ,   a g a i n   i n   r e g a r d   t o   i t s   m e a n i n g :  It has been said that the 
drunken,  licentious  songs,  some  of  which  were  performed  by  girls,  being 
broadcast  rapturously  by  means  of  the  radio  during  the  t a r ā w ī ḥ   prayers 
of  the  month  of  Ramadan  in  every  corner  of  this  blessed  centre  of  Islam 
resulted in the torment of this fear.

Second Question: Why aren’t these heavenly blows dealt at the unbe-

lievers in their countries? Why are they visited on the unhappy Muslims?

T h e  A n s w e r :  Just as the requital for big mistakes and crimes is postponed 
and made in big centres, and the requital for small crimes is made quickly 
in small centres, as a consequence of an important instance of wisdom, the 
recompense  of  the  greater  part  of  the  unbelievers’  crimes  is  postponed  to 

200

FOURTEENTH WORD – ADDENDUM

201

the Last Judgement, while the punishment for the believers’ faults is in part 
given in this world. 1

Third Question: What is the reason for this disaster? If it arises from 
the wrongdoing of a few individuals, why does it occur somewhat generally 
throughout the country?

T h e   A n s w e r :   The  general  disaster  results  from  the  wrongdoing  of  the 
majority: most people in effect participate in the actions of those tyrannical 
individuals by supporting them either actively or morally or in some con-
nection.

Fourth Question: Since the earthquake disaster results from wrongdo-
ing and is atonement for sins, why are the innocent and those not at fault 
struck by it? How does divine justice permit this?

T h e   A n s w e r ,   a g a i n   i n   r e g a r d   t o   i t s   m e a n i n g :  This matter concerns the 
mystery of divine determining, so we refer you to the Twenty-Sixth Word of 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and here say only this:

 Ë Ê É È Ç Æ Å Ä Ã
( 8:25 ) Ð Ï Î Í Ì
That  is,  beware  of  the  calamity  or  disaster  which  when  it  occurs  is  not 
restricted to wrongdoers but strikes the innocent as well. The meaning of the 
above verse is as follows: this world is a ﬁeld of trial and examination and 
a place of striving where man is accountable for his actions. Accountability 
and examination require that reality remains veiled so that through competi-
tion and striving the Abu Bakrs may rise to the highest of the high and the 
Abu Jahls may enter among the lowest of the low. If the innocent remained 
untouched by such disasters, the Abu Jahls would submit just like the Abu 
Bakrs, and the door of spiritual and moral progress through striving would 
be closed and the mystery of accountability spoiled.

Since divine wisdom requires that oppressed and oppressor are together 
afﬂicted by disaster, what share of divine mercy and justice then falls to the 
wretched oppressed?

In reply to this question it was said: for them there is a manifestation of 
mercy within the wrath and anger in the disaster. For just as the transient 

1.  Furthermore, in abandoning an abrogated and corrupted religion, people like the 
Russians do not incur divine wrath to the extent of those who betray a true and eternal 
religion which may not be abrogated. Thus, the earth leaves them at present, and displays 
its anger towards those here.

202

THE WORDS

property of the innocent becomes like alms and gains permanence, so too 
the relatively minor, temporary difﬁculty and suffering is a form of martyr-
dom for them which also gains for their transient lives a permanent life. The 
earthquake earns for them a huge, perpetual proﬁt, so for them is an instance 
of divine mercy within the wrath.

Fifth  Question:  Why  does  the  All-Just  and  All-Compassionate,  the 
All-Powerful  and  All-Wise  not  give  particular  punishments  for  particu-
lar wrongs, but inﬂicts a mighty element? How is this in keeping with the 
beauty of His mercy and His all-encompassing power?

T h e   A n s w e r :  The All-Powerful One of Glory assigns numerous duties 
to each element and by means of each duty causes them to produce numer-
ous different results. If one result of one of an element’s duties is ugly, evil, 
or calamitous, the other good results render this result good too. If the ele-
ment, which is angry at man, is prevented from the duty to avert the single 
ugly result, then instances of good to the number of the good results will be 
abandoned. Hence, since not to perform a necessary good is evil, instances 
of evil will be perpetrated to the number of the instances of good. A single 
evil being averted would be extremely ugly, opposed to wisdom, contrary to 
reality, and a fault. And power, wisdom and reality are free of fault. Since 
some  errors  constitute  rebellion  comprehensive  enough  to  bring  the  earth 
and  elements  to  anger,  and  are  insulting  aggression  against  the  rights  of 
numerous creatures, for sure, in order to demonstrate the extraordinary ugli-
ness of such a crime, it is perfect wisdom and justice that a mighty element 
be commanded to reprimand them among its other general duties, and for 
the oppressed, it is perfect mercy.

Sixth Question: The neglectful and heedless put it about that the earth-
quake resulted from a fault in the rock strata inside the earth, and they look 
upon it as quite simply a chance event, natural, and without purpose. They 
do not see the non-material causes and results that they may come to their 
senses. Does matter, on which they base their views, have some reality?

T h e   A n s w e r :   It  has  no  reality  other  than  misguidance  for  the  follow-
ing reason. Take the ﬂy out of all the species on the earth, which each year 
is clothed in and changes more than ﬁfty million ﬁnely embroidered well-
proportioned shirts: the intention, will, purpose, and wisdom manifested on 
the  wing  of  a  single  ﬂy,  which  is  only  one  organ  out  of  hundreds  of  one 
individual  ﬂy  out  of  the  countless  numbers  of  all  the  ﬂies  on  the  face  of 
the  earth,  and  the  fact  that  it  is  not  neglected  or  left  to  its  own  devices, 

FOURTEENTH WORD – ADDENDUM

all show that no aspect of the signiﬁcant acts and states of the huge globe 
of the earth, whether particular or universal, can be outside the divine will, 
choice, and purpose, for it is the cradle, mother, place of recourse, and pro-
tector of innumerable conscious beings. However, as is required by His wis-
dom, the Possessor of Absolute Power makes apparent causes a veil to His 
disposals. When He wills an earthquake, and sometimes He does, He com-
mands the movement of the strata and ignites them. Even if it results from 
this movement or a fault in the strata, it is still at the divine command and in 
accordance with His wisdom; it cannot occur in any other way.

For example, one man shot another with a riﬂe. If the man who ﬁred the 
shot is entirely disregarded and only the gunpowder in the bullet igniting is 
taken into consideration, the rights of the wretched victim would be com-
pletely violated, and it would be the epitome of foolishness. In just the same 
way, the earth is a docile ofﬁcial of the All-Powerful One of Glory, rather, 
a ship or an aircraft of His. So to forget the dominical command concerning 
it: “ Explode a bomb inside the earth prepared through wisdom and will in 
order to arouse the heedless and the rebellious! ” and to deviate into nature, 
is the very peak of stupidity.

A n   A d d i t i o n   a n d   F o o t n o t e   t o   t h e   S i x t h   Q u e s t i o n :  In order to defend 
their way and counter the awakening of the believers and hinder them, 
the  people  of  misguidance  and  the  atheists  display  an  obduracy  so 
strange and a stupidity so peculiar it makes a person regret his humanity. 
For example, in order to make men give up their wicked and wrongful 
rebellion  which  recently  has  become  somewhat  general,  and  to  arouse 
humanity  and  make  it  forego  this  awesome  revolt  and  recognize  the 
universe’s  Sovereign,  Whom  it  does  not  want  to  recognize,  the  Crea-
tor  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth  –  not  on  account  of  a  particular  title 
but as Sustainer and Ruler of the whole universe and all the worlds and 
through a widespread and general manifestation throughout the universe 
in the universal sphere of His dominicality – has struck humankind in the 
face with awesome, widespread calamities like earthquakes, storms, and 
world wars due to the universal elements coming to anger, with water, 
the air, and electricity, which are matchless and constant. He has demon-
strated through them in all clarity His wisdom, power, justice, and self-
subsistence. Although this is the case, certain brainless satans in human 
form respond to these universal dominical signs and divine reprimands 
with a foolish obstinacy, saying: 

204

THE WORDS

“ It’s  nature.  It’s  the  explosion  of  some  strata  under  the  earth  and  just 
chance.  It’s  the  sun’s  heat  clashing  with  electricity,  which  happened  in 
America  and  brought  all  the  machinery  to  a  standstill  for  ﬁve  hours,  and 
also caused the atmosphere in Kastamonu Province to turn red and take on 
the appearance of a conﬂagration. ” They utter meaningless nonsense like 
this. Due to a boundless ignorance resulting from misguidance and an ugly 
obduracy arising from aggressive atheism, they do not know that causes 
are each only a pretext and a veil. A small seed taking the place of a village 
full of factories and looms to weave and produce the members of a pine 
tree as tall as a mountain shows this. By saying, “ The tree emerged from 
the seed, ” they in effect deny the thousand miracles displayed in the pine  
tree and cite a number of apparent causes. They reduce to nothing a huge 
dominical act worked through the Creator’s will and wisdom. Sometimes 
they  attach  a  scientiﬁc  term  to  a  profound,  unknowable,  and  signiﬁcant 
truth which has purposes in a thousand respects, as though by using the 
term it has been understood. Whereas it is merely made commonplace, and 
without purpose, wisdom, or meaning.

So, come and see the innumerable degrees of stupidity and foolishness! 
They attach a name to a truth so profound and broad and unknown it could 
be completely understood only if it and its purposes and instances of wisdom 
were described in a hundred pages. As though it were something obvious 
they say: “ It is this. ” For example, “ It is some substance in the sun clash-
ing with electricity. ” Furthermore, they ascribe a particular and intentional 
dominical event to one of the natural laws, which are each the titles of uni-
versal, all-encompassing will and universal sovereignty, and are known as 
divine  laws.  By  doing  this  they  sever  its  connection  with  divine  will  and 
choice, then refer it to chance and nature. They display an ignorance more 
profound than that of Abu Jahl. It is a rebellious foolishness like attributing 
the victorious battle of an individual soldier or a battalion to military regu-
lations and discipline, so cutting its connection with the commander, king, 
government, and purposeful action.

Similarly,  if  a  wonder-working  craftsman  produces  a  hundred  o k k a s   1 
of various foodstuffs and a hundred yards of varying cloths from a chip of 
wood the size of ﬁngernail, like the creation of a fruitbearing tree from a 
seed, and someone points to the chip of wood and declares that these things 
have come into being out of it “ naturally ” and “ by chance, ” so reducing to

nothing the craftsman’s wondrous arts and skills, what utter lunacy it would 
be. It is exactly the same as that.

Seventh  Question:  What  should  one  understand  from  this  terrestrial 
event happening to the Muslim people of this country and its being aimed at 
them? And why are the areas of Erzincan and Izmir affected most?

T h e   A n s w e r :  As is indicated by many signs, such as the event occurring 
during a hard winter in the dark of night in severely cold weather, and its 
restriction to a region where due respect is not paid to the month of Ram-
adan, and the earthquakes continuing mildly in order to arouse the neglect-
ful – it suggests that the earthquakes are aimed at and look to the believers 
and are shaking the earth in order to warn them to perform the prayers and 
their supplications, and the earth itself is shaking. There are two reasons for 
places like unfortunate Erzincan being shaken more than other places. 
O n e :  Since its faults are few, their puriﬁcation has been expedited.
T h e  S e c o n d :  Since there is the opportunity in some places of strong, loyal 
defenders of the faith and protectors of Islam being defeated to a degree or 
entirely and atheists establishing an effective centre of activity, it is possible 
that punishment has been visited on them ﬁrst.

Oh, modern-educated Sir whose brain has shrunk through studying the 
soulless matters of astronomy, whose mind can see no further than the tip of 
his nose, and who cannot squeeze the mighty mystery of the above verse into 
his constricted brain! The heaven of the verse may be reached by a stairway 
of seven steps. Come, let us climb them together!

FIRST STEP: Truth and wisdom require that the heavens have inhab-
itants appropriate to them as the earth has. According to the Shari‘a, those 
various  beings  are  called  angels  and  spirit  beings.  Reality  requires  it  to 
be thus, for despite its small size and insigniﬁcance, the earth being ﬁlled 
with living and conscious beings, then emptied from time to time and once 
again repopulated suggests, indeed makes it clear, that the heavens too, in 
which are magniﬁcent constellations and are like adorned palaces, should 
be ﬁlled with conscious and percipient creatures. Like human beings and 
the jinn, those creatures are spectators of the palace of the universe, observ-
ers of the book of creation, and heralds of the sovereignty of dominicality. 
For the universe is arrayed and embellished with innumerable adornments, 
decorations,  and  ornaments,  and  self-evidently  requires  the  thoughtful 
gazes of those who will appreciate it and wonder at it. Certainly, beauty 
requires a lover and sustenance is given to the hungry. However, human 
beings  and  the  jinn  are  able  to  perform  only  a  millionth  of  this  endless 
duty,  this  grand  viewing,  this  extensive  worship.  That  is  to  say,  endless 
sorts  of  angels  and  spirit  beings  are  necessary  to  perform  these  endless 
duties and diverse worship.

As is indicated by certain narrations and the wisdom in the order of the 
universe, some kinds of travelling bodies, from planets to drops of water, 

206

FIFTEENTH WORD

207

are the mounts of a kind of angel. It may be said that they mount them 1 with 
Allah’s permission and tour and gaze upon the Manifest World. It also may 
be said that the various types of animal bodies, from the birds of Paradise 
called  “ the  green  birds ”  2  in  a  Hadith,  to  ﬂies,  are  each  the  aircraft  for  a 
sort of spirit being. They enter them at Allah’s command, travel around the 
physical universe observing the miracles of creation through the windows of 
the senses of the animals’ bodies.

The Creator, Who continuously creates subtle life and luminous percipi-
ent beings from dense earth and turbid water, surely also creates conscious 
beings suitable for spirit and life, from those seas of light and even from the 
oceans of darkness. And He creates them in great abundance. The existence 
of angels and spirit beings has been proved with the certainty of two plus 
two equals four in my treatise entitled Nokta ( Point ), and in the Twenty-
Ninth Word. If you wish, you may refer to them.

SECOND STEP: The earth and the heavens are connected to one another 
like two countries under a single government. There are important relations 
and  transactions  between  them.  Things  necessary  for  the  earth  like  light, 
heat, blessings, and mercy in the form of rain come from the sky, that is, 
they are sent. According to the consensus of the heavenly religions, which 
are founded on revelation, and the agreement of all those who uncover the 
mysteries of the universe, relying on what they have witnessed, the angels 
and spirit beings descend to the earth from the skies. From this it may be 
understood through a surmise so certain it is almost perceptible that for the 
inhabitants of the earth there is a way to ascend to the heavens.

Indeed, everyone’s mind, imagination, and gaze perpetually rise to the 
skies.  So  too,  having  discarded  all  heaviness,  the  spirits  of  the  prophets 
and saints rise there with Allah’s permission, and having stripped off their 
bodies, the spirits of the dead. Since those who become light and subtle 
rise to the heavens, for sure, one sort of the inhabitants of the earth and 
the air who are clothed in wraith-like bodies and are light and subtle like 
spirits may rise there.

THIRD  STEP:  The  silence  and  tranquillity  of  the  heavens,  and  their 
order and regularity, and vastness and luminosity, show that their inhabit-
ants  are  not  like  those  of  the  earth;  they  are  obedient,  they  do  whatever 
they are commanded. The country there is vast and there is nothing to cause

THE WORDS

overcrowding and disputes. Their natures are pure, they are innocent, their 
stations are ﬁxed. 

On  the  earth,  opposites  come  together,  evils  are  mixed  with  good  and 
disputes start between them, and conﬂict and suffering are born. From them 
examination and competition are set. And from them progress and retrogres-
sion occur. The wisdom in these facts is as follows:

Man is the fruit of the tree of creation, its furthest part. It is well-known 
that  the  fruit  of  something  is  its  most  distant,  most  comprehensive,  most 
delicate, and most important part. Therefore, since man, who is the fruit of 
the  universe,  is  a  most  comprehensive,  most  wonderful,  most  powerless, 
most weak, and most subtle miracle of power, the earth, which is his cradle 
and dwelling-place, is the heart and centre of the whole universe as regards 
meaning and art, despite being physically small and insigniﬁcant in relation 
to the heavens; it is the exposition and exhibition-place of all the miracles of 
art; and the display and point of focus of all the manifestations of the divine 
names; the place of assembly and reﬂection of unending dominical activ-
ity; the means and market of boundless divine creativity, whose liberality 
is especially evident in the numerous small species of plants and animals; 
the place, in a small measure, of samples of the artefacts to be found in the 
truly vast worlds of the hereafter; the speedily operating workshop for eter-
nal textiles; the fast-changing place of imitation of everlasting panoramas; 
the narrow, temporary ﬁeld and tillage rapidly raising the seeds for never-
ending gardens. 

It is because of this immaterial greatness of the earth  1 and its impor-
tance in regard to art that the All-Wise Qur’an puts it on a par with the 

1.  Despite its small size, the globe of the earth may be thought of as equal to the heav-
ens, for it may be said that “ a constant spring is greater than a lake with no inlet. ” And, 
a pile of grain the size of a mountain apparently seems to be thousands of times larger 
than a measure, but since it has all passed through the measure and been transferred to 
another place, the measure may be seen as in balance with the grain. It is exactly the same 
with the globe of the earth: Allah Almighty has created it as a place for exhibiting His 
art, a place where His creativity is concentrated, as a pivot of His wisdom, a place for the 
manifestation of His power, a garden of His mercy, a ﬁeld for His Paradise, the measure 
for uncountable universes and worlds of creatures, and like a spring ﬂowing into the seas 
of the past and the World of the Unseen. Think of all those renewed worlds whose shirts 
woven of beings are changed every year, layer upon layer, in hundreds of thousands of 
different forms, how they ﬁll the earth many times and being emptied into the past are 
poured into the World of the Unseen; consider those numerous shirts of the earth. That is, 
suppose all the past to be present, and then compare it with the somewhat monotonous and 
plain heavens: you will see that even if the earth does not weigh more than the heavens, it 
does not weigh less, either. Thus, you may understand the meaning of, I H G

heavens, although it is like the tiny fruit of a huge tree. It places it in one 
pan of a pair of scales and the whole of the rest of the universe in the other.  
It repeatedly says,

( 18:14 ;17:102 ;13:16 ) I H G
Furthermore,  the  speedy,  constant  change  and  transformation  of  the 
earth, which arises from the instances of wisdom mentioned above, requires 
that its inhabitants undergo change in accordance with it. It is because this 
limited earth manifests unlimited miracles of power that according to their 
creation and unlike other animate beings, no natural limit or restriction has 
been  placed  on  the  faculties  and  powers  of  human  beings  and  jinn,  who 
are its most important inhabitants. As a consequence, they have manifested 
endless progress and endless retrogression. A great ﬁeld of trial and exami-
nation has opened, from the prophets and the saints to the nimrods and the 
devils. Since this is so, of course, with their boundless evil, the pharaoh-like 
devils will throw stones at the heavens and its inhabitants.

FOURTH STEP: The All-Glorious One, Who is the Sustainer, Control-
ler, and Creator of all the worlds, has numerous principles and rules, and 
very many appellations, titles, and most beautiful names, all of which differ. 
Whichever  name  and  title  necessitated  sending  angels  to  the  ranks  of  the 
Prophet ( UWBP )’s Companions in order to do battle against the unbeliev-
ers also required that there should be battle between angels and devils, and 
contest between the good inhabitants of the heavens and the evil inhabitants 
of the earth. The All-Powerful One of Glory, Who holds within the grasp of 
His power the breathing-in and breathing-out of the unbelievers, does not 
wipe them out with a single command, a single trumpet-blast. With His title 
of universal Sustainer and names of All-Wise and Controller, He inaugu-
rates a ﬁeld of examination and contest.

If the comparison is not mistaken, we see that a king has numerous dif-
ferent titles and names in respect of the different areas of his rule. For exam-
ple, in the judiciary he is known by the name of Wise Judge, in the army as 
Commander-in-Chief, in the ofﬁce of the Shaykh al-Islam as Khalifa, and 
in the civil service as Sultan. His obedient subjects call him Gracious Sov-
ereign, while the rebellious call him All-Compelling Ruler. You may think 
of further examples.

Thus,  it  sometimes  happens  that  such  an  exalted  king,  whose  subjects 
are all under his power, does not issue the command to execute an impo-
tent,  contemptible  rebel;  he  sends  him  to  court  under  his  name  of  Wise 
Judge. Also, he knows a both capable and honest ofﬁcial who is worthy of 
being favoured, but he does not favour him with his particular knowledge

by private telephone. Instead, under his titles relating to the majesty of sov-
ereignty and expedients of government, he opens a ﬁeld of competition in 
order to make public how deserving the ofﬁcial is of reward, and he gives 
the command to his minister and invites the people to watch. He organizes a 
welcoming ceremony, and, as a result of a grand, elevated trial and examina-
tion, favours him in a distinguished assembly; he proclaims his worthiness. 
You can think of further examples in the same way.

Thus,  ( 16:60 )   j  i  h  the  Monarch  of  Pre-Eternity  and  Post-
Eternity has numerous most beautiful names. Through the manifestations of 
His glory and appearances of His beauty, He has many attributes and titles. 
The  name,  title,  and  attribute  which  necessitate  the  existence  of  light  and 
darkness, summer and winter, and Paradise and Hell, require also numerous 
general  laws  like  the  law  of  generation,  those  of  competition  and  mutual 
assistance, and the making general to a degree also of the law of contest. 
From the contest of inspirations and satanic whisperings around the heart to 
the contest between angels and devils on the bounds of the heavens, 1 they 
require that law to be all-embracing.

FIFTH  STEP:  Since  there  is  coming  and  going  from  the  earth  to  the 
heavens, and there is descent and ascent from the heavens to the earth and 
important necessities for the earth are sent from there; and since good spirits 
rise to the heavens, for sure, imitating the good spirits, evil spirits will also 
attempt to ascend to the realm of the heavens. For they are light and subtle 
in  respect  of  their  beings.  However,  they  will  doubtless  be  repulsed  and 
expelled, for by nature they are evil and inauspicious. Moreover, there will 
doubtless be a sign, an indication, in the Manifest World of this important 
exchange, this contest outside the realm of materiality. For the wisdom of 
the sovereignty of dominicality requires that it should place a sign and leave 
an  indication  of  these  signiﬁcant  disposals  in  the  Unseen  for  man  in  par-
ticular, whose most important duty is observation, witnessing, supervision, 
and acting as a herald; in the same way that it has made rain an indication 
of  the  endless  miracles  of  spring,  and  made  apparent  causes  signs  of  the 
wonders of divine art. It thus summons the people of the Manifest Realm to 
witness them; indeed, it attracts the attentive gazes of all the inhabitants of 
the heavens and the earth to that wondrous exhibition. That is, it shows the 
vast heavens to be a castle or city arrayed with towers on which sentries are 
posted, so that they may reﬂect on the majesty of dominicality.

Since  wisdom  requires  that  there  should  be  an  announcement  for  this  
elevated contest, there is surely an indication of it. But – other than shoot-
ing stars – no event appropriate to this announcement is apparent among the 
events  of  the  atmosphere  and  heavens;  there  is  nothing  more  appropriate 
than this. For it may be understood clearly how suitable for the repulsion of 
devils are these stellar events, which resemble missiles and signal rockets 
ﬁred from the sturdy bastions of towering castles. There is no other known 
purpose,  wisdom,  and  aim,  no  other  purpose  appropriate  to  these  occur-
rences  other  than  these.  Other  occurrences  are  not  like  this.  Furthermore, 
this purpose of them has been well-known since the time of Adam, and has 
been witnessed by the people of reality.

SIXTH STEP: Since human beings and the jinn are capable of inﬁnite 
evil and exertion, they are inﬁnitely obdurate and rebellious. It is because of 
this that the Holy Qur’an restrains them from rebellion and insubordination 
with an eloquence so miraculous, styles so elevated and clear, comparisons 
and stories so exalted and evident that they cause the universe to tremble. 
For example, observe carefully the awesome warning, fearsome threat, and 
severe restraining in the verses:

 ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ £ ¢ ¡ ﮯ ~ } | {
 ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´ *   ² ± ° ¯ * ¬ « ª ©
( 55:33-35 ) ¼ » º
They have this meaning: “ O men and jinn! If you are not going to obey my 
commands, come on, pass beyond the bounds of My realms if you are able! ” 
With miraculous eloquence, it smashes the excessively arrogant obstinacy 
of man and jinn. It proclaims their impotence, and shows just how powerless 
and wretched they are in relation to the immense grandeur of the sovereignty 
of dominicality. It is as though it says with the above verse, and the verse,

( 67:5 )  _ ^ ] 
“ O men and jinn, proud and obstinate within your baseness, and obdu-
rate  and  refractory  within  your  weakness  and  poverty!  How  are  you  so 
bold  as  to  oppose  with  your  rebellion  the  commands  of  a  Monarch  so 
Glorious that the stars, moons, and suns obey His commands like soldiers 
under orders? Through your deﬁance you contest a Glorious Ruler Who 
has obedient soldiers so awesome that, if to suppose the impossible your 
devils could withstand them, they would drive them off with cannonballs 

212

THE WORDS

the size of mountains. With your ingratitude, you revolt in the realm of a 
Lord of Glory Who has servants and troops so fearsome, let alone insig-
niﬁcant impotent creatures like you, if you were each inﬁdel enemies the 
size of mountains or the earth, they would be able to hurl stars, ﬂaming 
projectiles,  and  molten  metal  the  size  of  mountains  or  the  earth  at  you, 
and rout you. And you break such a law that those bound by it could if 
necessary strike your earth in your face, and rain down on you stars like 
cannonballs the size of your globe. ”

Yes,  in  the  Qur’an  are  important  concentrations  of  forces  which  arise 
not from the enemies’ strength, but from reasons like the displaying of maj-
esty and exhibiting the enemy’s wickedness. Then sometimes it mobilizes 
against the littlest and weakest thing, the largest and most powerful causes, 
in order to show its perfect order, inﬁnite justice, vast knowledge, and power 
of wisdom, and it holds them above it; but does not make them fall upon it 
or aggress against it. For example, look at this verse,

 r q p o n m l k j i h 
( 66:4 ) v u t s
How respectful it is concerning the Prophet ( UWBP ), and how compassion-
ate towards the rights of his wives! This important concentration of forces 
is only to express compassionately its tremendous respect for the Prophet 
( UWBP ) and the importance of the complaints of two weak beings and the 
observance of their rights.

SEVENTH STEP: As with angels and ﬁsh, there are numerous differ-
ent varieties of stars. Some are extremely small  1 and some are extremely 
large.  2  Everything  that  shines  in  the  sky  even  is  called  a  star.  Thus,  the 
stars of one sort the Glorious Creator and Beauteous Maker created are like 
the embossed decorations on the face of the delicate heavens, and the shin-
ing fruits of that tree, and the praising and extolling ﬁshes of its seas; He 
made them the places of excursion and thousands of dwelling-places for the 
angels. And one sort of small star He made the means for driving off devils. 
Thus, these shooting stars ﬁred to repulse satans may have three meanings:
T h e   F i r s t :  They are a sign and indication that the law of contest is also in 

force in the vastest sphere.

T h e   S e c o n d :  There are vigilant guards and obedient inhabitants in the 
heavens. The shooting stars are a proclamation and indication that there are 
divine forces found there who are displeased at the rebellion of evil earther-
dwellers and their eavesdropping on them.

T h e   T h i r d :   It  is  the  rejection  and  repulsion  with  missile-like  shooting 
stars and signal rockets of spying satans,  1 which are the execrable repre-
sentatives of the ﬁlth of the earth, from the portals of the heavens, so that 
they do not soil the pure and clean and the dwelling-place of the pure, the 
skies; to prevent them spying on account of evil spirits, and to scare off man-
nerless spies.

Astronomer Sir, who relies on the torch in his head like a ﬁreﬂy and shuts 
his eyes to the sun of the Qur’an! Look all at once at the truths indicated in 
the Seven Steps above. Open your eyes, put aside the torch in your head, and 
see within the light of miraculousness as bright as daylight the meaning of 
the verse at the beginning! Take one star of truth from the heavens of that 
verse, cast it at the satan in your head, and drive away your own devil! And 
we must do the same. Together we should say,

A Proof of the Qur’an against Satan and His Party

This First Topic defeats in argument the Devil, silences the rebellious, 
and strikes them dumb by refuting in the most clear manner a fearsome and 
cunning stratagem of the Devil, which is to be unbiased. It concerns an event 
part of which I described in summary form ten years ago in my work entitled 
Leme’ât. It is as follows:

Eleven years before this treatise was written in the month of Ramadan, 
I was listening to the Qur’an being recited in Beyazit Mosque in Istanbul. 
Suddenly, although I could not see anyone, I seemed to hear an unearthly 
voice which captured all my attention. I listened with my imagination and 
realized that it was saying to me:

“ You  consider  the  Qur’an  to  be  extremely  elevated  and  brilliant.  Be 
unbiased for a minute and consider it again. That is, suppose it to be man’s 
word. I wonder, would you still see the same qualities and beauty in it? ”

In truth, I was deceived by the voice; I thought of the Qur’an as being 
written by man. And just as Beyazit Mosque is plunged into darkness when 
the electric switch is turned off, I observed that with that thought the brilliant 
lights of the Qur’an began to be extinguished. At that point I understood that 
it was the Devil who was speaking to me. He was drawing me towards the 
abyss. I sought help from the Qur’an and a light was at once imparted to my 
heart giving me ﬁrm strength for the defence. I began to argue back at the 
Devil, saying:

214

FIFTEENTH WORD – ADDENDUM

215

“ O  Satan!  Unbiased  thinking  is  to  take  a  position  between  two  sides.  
Whereas what both you and your disciples from among men call unbiased 
thinking is to take the part of the opposing side; it is not impartiality, it is 
temporary unbelief. Because, to consider the Qur’an to be man’s word and 
to judge it as such is to take the part of the opposing side; it is to favour 
something baseless and invalid. It is not being unbiased, it is being biased 
towards falsehood. ”

The Devil replied: “ Well, in that case, say it is neither Allah’s Word nor 

man’s word. Think of it as between the two. ” To which I rejoined:

“ That is not possible either. For if there is a disputed property for which 
there are two claimants and the claimants are close both to one another and 
to the property, the property will either be given to someone other than them, 
or will be put somewhere accessible so that whoever proves ownership can 
take it. If the two claimants are far apart with one in the east and one in the 
west, then according to the rule, it will remain with the one who has pos-
session of it, as it is not possible for it to be left somewhere between them. 1
“ Thus,  the  Qur’an  is  a  valuable  property,  and  however  distant  man’s 
word is from Allah’s, the two sides in question are that far apart; indeed, 
they are inﬁnitely far from one another. It is not possible for the Qur’an to 
be left between the two sides, which are as far apart as the Pleiades and the 
ground. For they are opposites like existence and non-existence or the two 
magnetic poles; there can be no point between them. In which case, for the 
Qur’an, the one who possesses it is Allah’s side. It will be accepted as being 
in His possession and the proofs of ownership will be regarded in that way. 
Should the opposing side refute all the arguments proving it to be Allah’s 
Word,  it  may  claim  ownership  of  it,  otherwise  it  may  not.  Allah  forbid! 
What  hand  can  pull  out  the  nails  fastening  that  vast  jewel  to  the  sublime 
throne of Allah, riveted as it is with thousands of certain proofs, and break 
its supporting pillars, causing it to fall? ”

“ And so, inspite of you, O Satan!, the just and the fair-minded reason in 
this equitable and rightful manner. They increase their belief in the Qur’an 
through  even  the  slightest  evidences.  While  according  to  the  way  shown 
by you and your disciples, if just once it is supposed to be man’s word and 
that mighty jewel fastened to the divine throne is cast to the ground, a proof 
with the strength of all the nails and the ﬁrmness of many proofs becomes 
necessary in order to raise it from the ground and fasten it once more to the

throne, and so be saved from the darkness of unbelief and  reach the lights 
of belief. But because it is extremely difﬁcult to do this, due to your wiles, 
many people are losing their belief at this time by imagining themselves to 
be making unbiased judgements. ”

The  Devil  turned  and  said:  “ The  Qur’an  resembles  man’s  word.  It  is 
similar  to  the  way  men  converse.  That  means  it  is  man’s  word.  If  it  was 
Allah’s Word, it would be appropriate to Him and would be altogether out 
of the ordinary. Just as His art does not resemble man’s art, so also should 
His Word not resemble man’s word. ” 

I replied: “ It may be understood as follows: apart from his miracles and 
special attributes, the Prophet Muhammad ( UWBP ) was a human being in 
all his actions, conduct, and behaviour. He submitted to and complied with 
the divine laws and commands manifested in creation. He too suffered from 
the cold, experienced pain, and so on. His deeds and attributes were not all 
made out of the ordinary so that he could be the leader of his community 
through his actions, its guide through his conduct, and instruct it through all 
his behaviour. If he had been out of the ordinary in all his conduct, he could 
not have been the leader in every respect, the total guide of everyone, the 
Mercy to All the Worlds through all his attributes.

“ In just the same way, the All-Wise Qur’an is the leader of the aware and 
the conscious, the guide of jinn and men, the teacher of those attaining to 
perfection, and instructor of those seeking reality. It is of necessity and of a 
certainty, therefore, in the same form as human conversation and style. For 
men and jinn take their supplications from it and learn their prayers from 
it; they express their concerns in its language, and learn from it the rules of 
social behaviour, and so on. Everyone has recourse to it. If, therefore, it had 
been in the form of the divine speech that the Prophet Moses ( Upon whom 
be peace ) heard on Mount Sinai, man could not have borne listening to it 
and hearing it, nor made it the point of reference and recourse. Moses ( Upon 
whom be peace ), one of the ﬁve greatest prophets, could only endure to hear 
a few words. He said:
 1  ِةَ(cid:179) ِ(cid:127)ْ(cid:170)َ

ّ(cid:195)ا  َلاَ(cid:162) ؟ َكُ(cid:174) َ(cid:203)ﯬﯦ اَذﯬﯧٰ(cid:182)َا

ْ(cid:202)ا  ِع(cid:193) ِ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:106) ُةَ

Next, the Devil said: “ Many people speak of matters similar to those in 
the Qur’an in the name of religion. Is it not possible, therefore, that a human 
being did such a thing and made up the Qur’an in the name of religion? ”

FIFTEENTH WORD – ADDENDUM

Through the light of the Qur’an I replied as follows:
“ F i r s t l y :  Out of love of religion, someone who is religious may say, 
‘The truth is thus, the reality of the matter is this. Almighty Allah  com-
mands that.’ But he would not make Allah speak to suit himself. Trem-
bling at the verse,

( 39:32 ) ' & % $ # " 
he  would  not  overstep  his  mark  to  an  inﬁnite  degree,  imitate  Allah,  and 
speak on His behalf.

“ S e c o n d l y :  It is in no way possible for a human being to be successful in 
doing such a thing on his own, in fact, it is completely impossible. Persons 
who resemble one another may imitate one another, those of the same kind 
may take on one another’s forms, those who are close to one another in rank 
or status may imitate one another and temporarily deceive people, but they 
cannot do so for ever. For in any event, the falseness and artiﬁciality in their 
behaviour will show up their imposture to the observant, and their deception 
will not last. If the one who is attempting to imitate another under false pre-
tences is quite unlike them; for example, if an uneducated man wants to imi-
tate in learning a genius like Ibn Sina, or a shepherd to assume the position 
of a king, of course, they will not deceive anyone at all, they will only make 
fools of themselves. Everything they do will proclaim, ‘This is an impostor.’
“ Thus, to suppose – Allah forbid! a hundred thousand times – the Qur’an 
to be man’s word is utterly impossible, no rational being can accept it as 
possible, to do so is a delirium like imagining to be possible something that 
is self-evidently impossible like a ﬁreﬂy being seen by astronomers as a real 
star for a thousand years; or a ﬂy appearing to observers in the true form of 
a peacock for a year; or a bogus common private posing as a famous lofty 
ﬁeld marshal, taking over his position and remaining in it for a long period 
without  giving  away  his  deception;  or  like  a  slandering,  unbelieving  liar 
affecting the manner and position of the most truthful, trustworthy, upright 
believer throughout his life and being completely unrufﬂed before even the 
most observant while concealing his fraud from them.

“ In just the same way, if the Qur’an is supposed to be man’s word, then 
it  has  to  be  supposed,  Allah  forbid,  that  that  Perspicuous  Book,  which  is 
considered  to  be  clearly  a  most  brilliant  star,  rather,  a  sun  of  perfections 
perpetually scattering the lights of truth in the heavens of the world of Islam, 
is like a ﬁreﬂy, a spurious sham made up by a counterfeiting human. And 
those who are closest to it and study it most carefully do not realize this, 

218

THE WORDS

and consider it to be a perpetual, exalted star and source of truth. Together 
with this being impossible a hundred times over, even if you went a hundred 
times further in your diabolical machinations, O Satan, you could not make 
such  an  assertion,  you  could  not  deceive  anyone  of  sound    reason!  Only 
sometimes you trick people by making them look from a great distance, thus 
making the star appear as small as a ﬁreﬂy.

“ T h i r d l y :   Also,  if  the  Qur’an  is  imagined  to  be  man’s  word,  it  neces-
sitates that the hidden reality of a criterion of truth and falsehood, which is 
miraculous in its exposition, and through the testimony of its fruits, results, 
and effects, is gilded with the most spiritual and life-giving, the most truth-
ful and happiness-bringing, the most comprehensive and exalted qualities in 
the world of humankind, is, Allah forbid, the fabrication of a single unaided 
and unlearned man’s mind; and that the great geniuses and brilliant scholars 
who observed that being closely and studied him meticulously at no time 
saw any trace of counterfeit or pretence in him and always found him seri-
ous, genuine, and sincere.

“ This is completely impossible, an idea so nonsensical as to shame the 
Devil himself, like dreaming up an utterly impossible situation. For it entails 
supposing one who throughout his life demonstrated and taught trust, belief, 
conﬁdence,  sincerity,  seriousness,  and  integrity  through  all  his  conduct, 
words, and actions, and raised eminently truthful and sincere followers, and 
was accepted to possess the highest and most brilliant and elevated virtues 
to  be  the  most  untrustworthy,  insincere,  and  unbelieving.  Because  in  this 
question there is no point between the two.

“ If, to suppose the impossible, the Qur’an was not the Word of Allah, 
it would fall as though from the divine throne to the ground, it would not 
remain  somewhere  between.  While  being  the  meeting-point  of  truths,  it 
would become the source of superstition and myth. And if, Allah forbid, the 
one who proclaimed that wonderful decree was not Allah’s Messenger, it 
would necessitate his descending from the highest of the high to the lowest 
of the low, and from the degree of being the source of accomplishments and 
perfections to the pits of being a mine of trickery and intrigue; he could not 
remain between the two. For one who lies and fabricates in Allah’s name 
falls to the very lowest of degrees.

“ However impossible it is to permanently see a ﬂy as a peacock, and to 
all the time see the peacocks’s attributes in the ﬂy, this matter is that impos-
sible. Only someone lacking all intelligence could imagine it to be possible.

“ F o u r t h l y :  Also, if the Qur’an is imagined to be man’s word, it neces-
sitates fancying that the Qur’an, which is a sacred commander of the com-
munity  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP ),  humanity’s  largest  and  most  powerful 
army, is – Allah forbid – a powerless, valueless, baseless forgery. Whereas, 
self-evidently, through its powerful laws, sound principles, and penetrat-
ing commands, it has equipped that huge army both materially, and mor-
ally    and  spiritually,  has  given  it  an  order  and  regularity  and  imposed  a 
discipline on it that are such as to conquer both this world and the next, and 
has  instructed  the  minds,  trained  the  hearts,  conquered  the  spirits,  puri-
ﬁed the consciences, and employed and utilized the limbs and members of 
individuals according to the degree of each. To imagine it to be a counter-
feit necessitates accepting a hundredfold impossibility.

“ This  impossibility  entails  the  further  complete  impossibility  of  sup-
posing  that  one  who,  through  his  deliberate  conduct  throughout  his  life 
taught humankind Almighty Allah’s laws, and through his honest behaviour 
instructed it in the principles of truth, and through his sincere and reason-
able words showed and established the straight way of moderation and hap-
piness, and as all his life testiﬁes, felt great fear of divine punishment and 
knew Allah better than anyone else and made Him known, 1 and in splendid 
fashion  has  for  one  thousand  three  hundred  and  ﬁfty  years  commanded  a 
ﬁfth of humankind and half the globe, and through his qualities of renown is 
in truth the means of pride of humanity, indeed, of the universe, Allah forbid 
a  hundred  thousand  times,  neither  feared  Allah,  nor  knew  Him,  nor  held 
back from lying, nor had any self-respect. Because in this matter there is no 
point between the two. For if, to suppose the impossible, the Qur’an is not 
the Word of Allah, if it falls from the divine throne to the ground, it cannot 
remain somewhere in between the two. Indeed, it then has to be accepted to 
be the property of the very worst of liars. As for this, O Satan, even if you 
were a hundred times more satanic, you could not deceive any mind that was 
not unsound, nor persuade any heart that was not corrupted. ”

The Devil retorted: “ How should I not deceive them? I have deceived 
most of humankind and their foremost thinkers into denying the Qur’an and 
Muhammad. ” 

I replied: “ F i r s t l y :  When seen from a great distance, the greatest thing 

appears the same as the smallest. A star may even appear as a candle.

“ S e c o n d l y :  Also, when seen both as secondary and superﬁcially, some-

thing which is completely impossible may appear to be possible.

attention and thought that impossibility was possible.

“ T h i r d l y :   Also,  non-acceptance  is  one  thing  and  denial  is  something 
quite  different.  Non-acceptance  is  indifference,  a  closing  of  the  eyes  to 
something, an ignorant absence of judgement. Many completely impossible 
things may be concealed within it, and the mind does not concern itself with 
them. As for denial, it is not non-acceptance, but an acceptance of non-exist-
ence; it is a judgement. The mind is compelled to work. So a devil like you 
takes hold of the mind of a person, then leads it to denial. And, showing the 
false as truth and the impossible to be possible through such satanic wiles 
as  heedlessness,  misguidance,  fallacious  reasoning,  obstinacy,  false  argu-
ments, pride, deception, and habit, you make those unfortunate creatures in 
human form swallow unbelief and denial, although they comprise innumer-
able impossibilities.

“ F o u r t h l y :   Also,  if  the  Qur’an  is  supposed  to  be  the  word  of  man,  it 
necessitates  imagining  to  be  its  opposite  a  book  which  has  self-evidently 
guided the puriﬁed, veracious saints and spiritual poles, who shine like stars 
in the heavens of the world of humanity, has continuously instructed every 
level of the people of perfection in truth and justice, veracity and ﬁdelity, 
faith and trustworthiness, and has ensured the happiness of the two worlds 
through the truths of the pillars of belief and the principles of the pillars of 
Islam, and through the testimony of these achievements is of necessity vera-
cious, and pure, genuine truth, and absolutely right, and most serious – it 
necessitates imagining, Allah forbid, that this Book comprises the opposites 
of these qualities, effects, and lights. And that, regarding it as a collection 
of fabrications and lies, it is a frenzy of unbelief that would shame even the 
Sophists and the devils, and cause them to tremble.

“ And this impossibility necessitates the further most ugly and abhorrent 
impossibility that the one who, according to the testimony of the religion 
and Shari‘a of Islam which he proclaimed, and the unanimous indications 
to the extraordinary fear of Allah and pure and sincere worship which he 
demonstrated  throughout  his  life,  and  as  necessitated  by  the  good  moral 
qualities unanimously witnessed in him, and according to the afﬁrmation of 
the people of truth and perfection whom he reared, was the most believing,

the most steadfast, the most trustworthy, and the most truthful, was – Allah 
forbid, and again, Allah forbid – without belief, that he was most untrust-
worthy, did not fear Allah, nor shrink from lying. To imagine this necessi-
tates imagining the most loathsome form of impossibility and perpetrating 
the most iniquitous and vicious sort of misguidance.

“ I n   S h o r t :  As is stated in the Eighteenth Sign of the Nineteenth Letter, 
the common people, whose understanding of the Qur’an is gained by listen-
ing to it, say, ‘Were the Qur’an to be compared with all the books I  have 
listened to and the other books in the world, it would not resemble any of 
them; it is not of the same sort as them nor of the same degree.’ The Qur’an, 
then,  is  of  a  degree  either  above  all  of  them  or  below  all  of  them.  To  be 
below them is impossible, and no enemy nor the Devil even could accept it. 
In which case, the Qur’an is above all other books and is therefore a mira-
cle. In just the same way, we say according to the categorical proof called 
‘investigation [ of possible cases ] and disjunction,’ taken from the sciences 
of method and logic: 1

“ O  Satan  and  O  disciples  of  Satan!  The  Qur’an  is  either  the  Word  of 
Allah  come  from  the  supreme  throne  of  Allah  and  His  greatest  name,  or, 
Allah  forbid,  and  again,  Allah  forbid,  it  is  a  human  forgery  fabricated  on 
earth by someone without belief who neither feared Allah nor knew Him. In 
the face of the above proofs, O Satan, you can neither say that, nor could you 
have said it, nor will you be able to say it in the future. Therefore, the Qur’an 
is the Word of the universe’s Creator. For there is no point between the two; 
it is impossible and precluded that there should be. Just as we have proved in 
the most clear and decisive manner; and you have seen it and heard it.

“ In  the  same  way,  Muhammad  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace ) 
is  either  Allah’s  Messenger  and  the  highest  of  the  prophets  and  the  most 
superior of creatures, or, Allah forbid, he has to be imagined to be someone 
without belief who fell to the lowest of the low because he lied concerning 
Allah, and did not know Allah, and did not believe in His punishment.2 And 
as for this, O Devil, neither you nor the atheistic philosophers of Europe and 
hypocrites of Asia on whom you rely could say it, nor could you say it in the 
past, neither shall you be able to say it in the future, for there is no one in the

2.  Relying on the fact that the Qur’an mentions the blasphemies and obscenities of 
the unbelievers, in order to refute them, trembling, I too have been compelled to use these 
expressions in the form of impossibilities so as to demonstrate the total impossibility and 
complete worthlessness of the blasphemous ideas of the people of misguidance.

world who would listen to it and accept it. It is because of this that the most 
corrupting of those philosophers and the most lacking in conscience of the 
hypocrites,  even,  admit  that  ‘Muhammad  the  Arabian  ( UWBP )  was  very 
clever, and was most moral and upright.’

“ Since this matter is restricted to these two sides, and the second one is 
impossible and no one at all claims it to be true, and since we have proved 
with decisive arguments that there is no point between them, for sure and of 
necessity, in spite of you and your party, self-evidently and most certainly 
Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) was Allah’s 
Messenger, and the highest of the prophets and the best of all creatures. ”

One  time  while  reading  these  verses  from  Sura  Qaf,  the  Devil  said  to 
me: “ You consider the most important aspects of the Qur’an’s eloquence 
to lie in its clarity and ﬂuency of style. But in this verse it jumps from one 
subject  to  another.  It  jumps  from  death  agonies  to  the  resurrection  of  the 
dead, from the blowing of the trumpet to the Last Judgement, and from that 
to the entry into Hell of the unbelievers. What ﬂuency of style remains with 
this extraordinary switching about? In most places in the Qur’an, it brings 
together subjects that bear little relation to each other like this. Where is its 
eloquence and smoothness with such discontinuity? ”

I answered as follows:
After its eloquence, one of principal elements of the miraculousness of 
the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition is its conciseness. Conciseness is one of 
the strongest and most signiﬁcant elements of the Qur’an’s miraculousness.

FIFTEENTH WORD – ADDENDUM

Instances of this miraculous conciseness of the Qur’an are so numerous and 
beautiful that exacting scholars are left in wonder at it. For example:

 É È Ç Æ Å Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼
( 11:44 ) Í Ì Ë Ê
It describes the Great Flood and its consequences so concisely and mirac-
ulously in a few short sentences that it has caused many scholars of rhetoric 
to prostrate before its eloquence. And, for example:

 *X W V U T S R * P O N *    L K J
 * ` _ ^ ] \ [ Z
( 91:11-15 ) d c b
In these few short sentences and with a miraculousness within the con-
ciseness, ﬂuency, and clarity, and in a way that does not spoil the under-
standing, the Qur’an relates the strange, momentous events concerning the 
Thamud people, together with the consequences and their calamitous end. 
And for example:

 j i h g f e d c b a ` _ ^
( 87 :21 ) t s r q p o n m l k

Here, many sentences have be ‘rolled up’ between the words 

g f e d  and j i h but these omitted sentences neither 
spoil  the  understanding,  nor  mar  the  ﬂuency  of  the  style.  It  mentions  the 
main elements of the story of Jonah ( Upon whom be peace ), and refers the 
rest to the intelligence.

And for example, in Sura Yusuf, the seven or eight sentences between the 

 ( 12:46 ) 9 8 7  

words 5 and 
have been skipped in concise-
ness. It neither impairs the understanding, nor mars the smoothness of the 
style. There are a great many instances of this sort of miraculous conciseness 
in the Qur’an, and they are very beautiful indeed.

However, the conciseness of the verses from Sura Qaf are particularly 
wonderful and miraculous. For they each point out the truly dreadful future 

224

of the unbelievers when each endless day will last ﬁfty thousand years, and 
the grievous, dire things that will happen to them in the awesome revolutions 
of the future. It conveys the mind over them like lightning, presenting that 
long, long period of time to the mind’s eye as a single present page. Refer-
ring  to  the  imagination  the  events  which  are  not  mentioned,  it  describes 
them with a most elevated ﬂuency and smoothness of style.

And now if you have anything to say, O Satan, say it!
Satan replied: “ I cannot oppose what you say, nor defend myself. But 
there are many foolish people who listen to me; and many devils in human 
form  who  assist  me;  and  many  pharaohs  among  philosophers  who  learn 
things from me which ﬂatter their egos, and prevent the publication of works

[ This  Word  was  written  to  impart  insight  and  understanding  to  my 
blind soul by pointing out four rays from the light of the above verse, to 
dispel the darkness and afford me certainty. ]

FIRST RAY

O my ignorant soul! You say: “ The oneness of the divine essence together 
with the universality of the divine acts, the unity of Almighty Allah’s person 
together  with  His  unassisted  comprehensive  dominicality,  His  singleness 
together with His unshared all-embracing disposal, His being beyond space 
yet present everywhere, His inﬁnite exaltedness together with being close to 
all things, and His being one yet Himself holding all matters in His hand, are 
among the truths of the Qur’an. But the Qur’an is all-wise and that which is 
wise does not impose on the reason things which are unreasonable, yet the 
reason sees an apparent contradiction between these things. I would like an 
explanation of them which will impel the reason to submit. ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  Since that is the way it is and you want to be certain and 
reassured, relying on the effulgence of the Qur’an, we say: the divine name 
of Light has solved many of our difﬁculties. Allah willing it will solve this 
one too. The way of comparison brings clarity to the mind and luminosity to 
the heart. So choosing it, like Imam-i Rabbani, we say:

THE WORDS

Since comparison is a brilliant mirror to the Qur’an’s miraculousness, we 
too shall look at this mystery by means of a comparison. It is as follows:

A  single  person  may  gain  universality  by  means  of  various  mirrors. 
While he is in fact one particular individual, he as though becomes a univer-
sal possessing general qualities. For example, although the sun is a single 
particular, by means of transparent objects it becomes so universal it ﬁlls the 
face of the earth with its images and reﬂections. Even, it has manifestations 
to the number of droplets and shining motes. Just as the sun’s heat, light, and 
the seven colours in its light comprehend, encompass, and embrace all the 
things which confront them; so too all transparent things hold in the pupils 
of their eyes the sun’s heat, and its light and seven colours, and its image. 
And they make a throne for them in their hearts. That is to say, with regard 
to unity, the sun encompasses all the things that face it, while with regard to 
oneness, the sun is present together with many of its attributes in everything 
through a sort of manifestation of its essence. Since we have passed from the 
comparison to a discussion of representation, we shall indicate three of the 
many sorts of representation, for it will assist in understanding this matter.
The First: This is the reﬂection of dense, physical objects. These reﬂec-
tions are both other than the thing reﬂected; they are not the same, and they 
are  dead,  without  life.  They  possess  no  quality  other  than  their  apparent 
identity.  For  example,  if  you  enter  a  store  full  of  mirrors,  one  Said  will 
become thousands of Saids, but the only living one is you, all the others are 
dead. They possess none of the characteristics of life.

The  Second:  This  is  the  reﬂection  of  physical  luminous  objects.  This 
reﬂection is not the same as the thing reﬂected, but neither is it other than 
it. It does not hold the luminous object’s nature, but it possesses most of its 
characteristics  and  may  be  considered  to  be  living.  For  example,  the  sun 
entered the world and displayed its reﬂection in all mirrors. Present in each 
of the reﬂections are light and the seven colours in light, the equivalent of 
the  sun’s  qualities.  Let  us  suppose  the  sun  possessed  consciousness,  and 
its heat was pure power; its light, pure knowledge; and its seven colours, 
the seven attributes: the single sun would be present in all mirrors at one 
moment, and would be able to make each a throne for itself and a sort of 
telephone. One mirror would not be an obstacle to another. It would be able 
to meet with all of us by means of our mirrors. While we are distant from it, 
it would be nearer to us than ourselves.

The Third: This is the reﬂection of luminous spirits. This reﬂection is 
both living, and the same as the spirits. But since it appears in relation to 

SIXTEENTH WORD

227

the capacity of the mirrors, it does not hold completely the spirit’s essence 
and nature. For example, at the moment the Angel Gabriel ( Upon whom 
be peace ) is in the presence of the Prophet ( UWBP ) in the form of Dihya, 
1 he is  prostrating with his magniﬁcent wings in the divine presence before 
the sublime throne. 2 And at the same moment he is present in innumerable 
places and is relaying the divine commands. One task is not an obstacle 
to another. Thus, it is through this mystery that the Prophet Muhammad 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), whose essence is light and whose 
nature is luminous, in this world hears at the same time all the benedictions 
recited for him by all his community, and at the resurrection will meet with 
all the puriﬁed at the same time. One will not be an obstacle to another. 
In fact, some of the saints who have acquired a high degree of luminosity 
and are called Substitutes ( a b d ā l  ) have been observed in many places at 
the same time and the same person has performed numerous different acts 
at the same time. 

Indeed, just as such things as glass and water act as mirrors to physical 
objects, so the air and ether and certain beings of the World of Similitudes 
are like mirrors to spirit beings; they become like means of transport and 
conveyance with the speed of lightning and imagination. The spirit beings 
travel in those pure mirrors and subtle dwellings with speed of imagination. 
They enter thousands of places at the same time. Despite being restricted 
particulars,  through  the  mystery  of  luminosity  impotent  and  subjugated 
creatures  like  the  sun  and  semi-luminous  beings  restricted  by  matter  like 
spirit beings may be present in numerous places while being in one place, 
thus becoming like absolute universals and with a limited power of choice 
being able to perform many matters simultaneously.

Thus, what thing may hide itself from address of oneness which is within 
the manifestation of the attributes and acts of the Most Pure and Holy One 
through His universal will, absolute power, and all-encom-passing knowl-
edge? The Most Holy One, Who is far beyond and exalted above matter; free 
and exempt from any restriction or limitation and the darkness of density; of 
the sacred lights of Whose names all these lights and luminous beings are but 
dense shadows; and of Whose beauty all existence and all life and the World 
of Spirits and the World of Similitudes are semi-transparent mirrors; Whose

attributes are all-encompassing and Whose qualities, universal? What matter 
could be difﬁcult for Him? What thing can be concealed from Him? What 
individual can be distant from Him? What person can draw close to Him 
without acquiring universality?

Although by means of its unrestricted light and immaterial reﬂection, the 
sun is closer to you than the pupil of your eye, since you are restricted, you 
are truly distant from it. In order to draw close to it, you have to transcend 
numerous  restrictions  and  pass  over  many  universal  degrees.  Simply,  in 
effect you have to expand to the size of the earth and rise as far as the moon, 
then you may be able to a degree to approach directly the sun’s essential 
level and meet with it without veil. In just the same way, the Glorious One of 
Beauty and Beauteous One of Perfection is inﬁnitely close to you, and you 
are inﬁnitely distant from Him. If your heart has strength, and your mind, 
eminence, try to put the points in the comparison into practice.

SECOND RAY

O my senseless soul! You say that verses like,

( 36:82 ) Å Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼

and,

and,

( 36:53 ) Ò Ñ Ð Ï Î Í Ì Ë Ê É
show that the existence of things is instantaneous and merely through a com-
mand, and that verses like,

( 27:88 ) à ß Þ Ý Ü Û

( 32:7 ) x w v u
show  that  the  existence  of  things  is  gradual,  through  a  vast  power  within 
knowledge and a ﬁne art within wisdom. How are these compatible? 
T h e   A n s w e r :  Relying on the effulgence of the Qur’an, we say:
Firstly: There is no contradiction. Some are like the former, like primary 

creation. And some are like the latter, like the repetition of creation.

Secondly: The inﬁnite order and extreme skill, ﬁne art, and perfect crea-
tion together with the ease, speed, multiplicity, and extensiveness that are 
observed in beings testify decisively to the existence of the truths of these 
two sorts of verses. Since this is so, it is unnecessary to prove this to be true 
outside this and make it the point of discussion. It should rather be asked: 

SIXTEENTH WORD

229

“ What is the wisdom in these verses? What is their meaning and purpose? ” 
Thus, we shall point to this wisdom with an allegoric analogy. 

For example, a craftsman, for instance a tailor, creates something artistic 
with  much  difﬁculty  and  employing  many  skills,  then  makes  a  model  for 
it. For thereafter he can make others similar to it quickly and without  dif-
ﬁculty. It may even become so easy they are as though made at a command, 
and in that way may acquire a powerful order; like a clock, they function and 
work as though at the touch of a command.

In just the same way, after making this palace of the world and all its con-
tents originally, the All-Wise Maker and All-Knowing Inscriber gave eve-
rything, particular and universal, the whole and the parts, a speciﬁed meas-
ure  and  proportion  through  the  ordering  of  divine  determining,  as  though 
they were models. So, look! Making every century a model, the Pre-Eternal 
Inscriber clothes each with bejewelled new worlds through the miracles of 
His  power.  Making  every  year  a  scale,  He  sews  skilfully  fashioned  new 
universes through the wonders of His mercy according to their stature. And 
making every day a line, He writes the decorated, constantly renewed beings 
in them through the subtleties of His wisdom.

Furthermore, just as that Absolutely Powerful One makes each century, 
each year, and each day a model, so He makes the face of the earth, and the 
mountains  and  plains,  gardens  and  orchards,  and  trees  each  a  model.  He 
continuously sets up new universes on the earth and creates new worlds. He 
removes one world and replaces it with another, well-ordered world. Season 
after season He displays in all the gardens and orchards the miracles of His 
power and the gifts of His mercy. He writes them all as wisdom-displaying 
books, establishes them as kitchens of His mercy, and clothes them in ever-
renewed garments full of art. Every spring He arrays the trees in raiments of 
brocade and adorns them with fresh jewels like pearls. He ﬁlls their hands 
with the star-like gifts of His mercy. 

Thus,  the  One  Who  performs  these  matters  with  inﬁnitely  ﬁne  art  and 
perfect order and changes with inﬁnite wisdom, bounty, and perfection of 
power and art the travelling worlds which follow on one after the other and 
are attached to the string of time, is certainly All-Powerful and All-Wise. He 
is All-Seeing and All-Knowing to an inﬁnite degree. Chance cannot inter-
fere in His works. He is the All-Glorious One Who decrees,

and both proclaims the perfection of His power, and that in relation to His 
power the resurrection and Great Gathering are most easy and free of trou-
ble. Since His creational command comprises power and will, and all things 
are entirely subjugated and obedient to His command, and He creates with 
no contact or hindrance, in order to express the absolute ease in His creat-
ing, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition decrees that He does this through 
a mere command.

T o   C o n c l u d e :  Some verses proclaim the extremely ﬁne art and inﬁnite 
perfection of wisdom in beings, especially at the start of their creation. While 
others describe the extreme ease and speed and inﬁnite compliance and lack 
of difﬁculty in the recreation and return of things in particular.

You say that verses like,

truths  like  the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  Ascension  show  that  we  are  inﬁnitely 
distant from Him. I would like an explanation that will bring this profound 
mystery closer to the understanding.

T h e   A n s w e r :  Then listen to the following:

‘Āṣim, a l - S u n n a , ii, 367.

SIXTEENTH WORD

231

F i r s t l y :  At the end of the First Ray we said that with regard to its unre-
stricted light and immaterial reﬂection, the sun is closer to you than the pupil 
of your eye, which is the window of your spirit and its mirror, yet you are 
extremely distant from it, for you are restricted and imprisoned in material-
ity. You can make contact with it only through some of its reﬂections and 
shadows, and meet with it through some of its minor, particular manifesta-
tions, and draw close to its colours, which are like a category of attribute, 
and to its rays and manifestations, which are like a class of its names. If you 
want to approach the sun’s essential level and meet with the  sun’s essence 
directly  in  person,  then  you  have  to  transcend  very  many  restrictions  and 
traverse very many levels of universality. Simply, after abstracting yourself 
from materiality, becoming enlarged to the extent of the earth, expanding in 
the spirit like the air, rising as far as the moon and resembling the full moon, 
only then can you claim to meet with it in person without veil and to draw 
close to it to any degree.

In just the same way, the All-Glorious One of Perfection, the Peerless 
One of Beauty, the Necessarily Existent One, the Giver of existence to all 
beings, the Eternal Sun, the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, is 
closer to you than yourself. Yet you are inﬁnitely distant from Him. If you 
have the power, put the ﬁne points in the comparison into practice.

Secondly: For example, ( 16:60 )  j  i  h among many names, a 
king’s name of commander appears in many spheres, one within the other. 
It has a manifestation and appearance in spheres extensive and narrow, uni-
versal and particular, from the universal sphere of commander-in-chief, to 
those of ﬁeld marshal and general, then those of captain and corporal. Now, 
in his military duties, a private soldier holds as his authority the minor point 
of commandership apparent in the rank of corporal; he is in touch with and 
connected to the commander-in-chief through this  minor manifestation of 
his name. If he wishes to get in touch with him through his essential name 
and meet with him through that title, he will have to rise from the corporal-
ship to the universal rank of commander-in-chief. That is to say, the king is 
extremely close to the soldier through his name, decree, law and knowledge, 
his telephone and regulations, and if he is luminous like a saint who is an 
a b d ā l ,  with  his  presence  in  person.  Nothing  at  all  can  be  an  obstacle  or 
obstruction for him. Whereas the soldier is extremely distant. Thousands of 
degrees form obstructions and thousands of veils intervene. But sometimes 
the king is compassionate and contrary to his practice, receives a soldier into 
his presence and favours him with his grace.

232

THE WORDS

In just the same way, the All-Glorious One, the Lord of the command 
of, ² ± , for Whom the suns and stars are as though His soldiers under 
orders, is closer to all things than they themselves, yet all things are inﬁnitely 
distant from Him. If you want to enter the presence of His grandeur without 
veil, you have to pass through seventy thousands of veils of darkness and 
light, that is, material and physical veils and the veils of the divine names 
and attributes, rise through the thousands of particular and universal degrees 
of manifestation of each name, pass on through the most elevated levels of 
His attributes, and ascend as far as the sublime throne, which manifests His 
greatest name, and if you are not the object of  favour and attraction, you 
have to work and journey spiritually for thousands of years. For example, 
if you want to draw close to Him through His name of Creator, you have to 
have a relationship through the particularities of your own Creator, then in 
regard to the Creator of all humankind, then through the title of Creator of all 
living creatures, then through the name of Creator of all beings. Otherwise 
you will remain in shadow and only ﬁnd a minor manifestation.

A REMINDER: Because of his impotence, the king in the comparison 
put means like ﬁeld marshal and general in the degrees of his names. But 
the Absolutely Powerful One, É È Ç Æ  ( 36:83 ) , has no need 
of intermediaries. Intermediaries are only apparent; a veil to His dignity and 
grandeur. They are heralds and observers of the sovereignty of His domini-
cality immersed in awestruck worship, impotent and wanting. They are not 
His assistants and cannot be partners in the sovereignty of His dominicality.

FOURTH RAY

O  my  lazy  soul!  Like  the  soldier  in  the  previous  comparison  was 
received into the royal presence as a pure favour, the reality of the ﬁve daily 
prayers,  which  are  like  a  sort  of  Ascension,  are  a  being  received  into  the 
presence of the All-Glorious One of Beauty, the Beauteous One of Glory, 
Who is the True Object of Worship, as an instance of pure mercy. Declar-
ّ(cid:195)َا it is to traverse the two worlds either in the mind or in the 
ing  ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ
imagination  or  by  intention,  be  divested  of  the  restrictions  of  materiality, 
pass  to  a  universal  degree  of  worship  or  a  shadow  or  form  of  universal-
ity; being honoured with a sort of presence, it is to manifest the address of 
( 1:5 ) 3 2  – each person according to his capacity; it is a truly ele-
ّ(cid:195)َا in the actions of 
vated attainment. The repetition of ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ
the  prayers  indicates  rising  through  the  degrees  of  spiritual  progress,  and 

ّ(cid:195)َا * ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ

ascending from minor particulars to universal spheres, and is a concise title 
of the perfections of divine sublimity which are beyond our knowledge. It is 
ّ(cid:195)َا indicates traversing a step in the Ascension. To attain to 
as if each ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ
a shadow or a ray of this reality of the prayers either in the mind or by inten-
tion or conceptually or with the imagination is a great happiness.
The above is the reason for the frequent declaration of ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ

ّ(cid:195)َا during 
the Hajj. For the blessed Hajj is worship for everyone at a universal level. 
Just as on a special day or festival a soldier attends the king’s celebrations 
like a general in the sphere of general, and receives his favours, in the same 
way, like a saint who has traversed all the degrees, a  Hajji, no matter how 
lowly,  is  turned  towards  his  Sustainer  under  the  title  Mighty  Sustainer  of 
every region of the earth. He is honoured with universal worship. For sure, 
the universal degrees of dominicality opened with the key of the Hajj, and 
the horizons of the tremendousness of the Godhead which are visible to his 
eye through its telescope, and the spheres of worship which gradually unfold 
to his heart and imagination through its observances, and the heat, wonder, 
awe, and dread of dominicality caused by the levels of sublimity and last 
ّ(cid:195)َا 
stage of manifestation, can only be quietened by  ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ
And those observed or imagined unfolded degrees can only be proclaimed 
by it. Following the Hajj, this meaning is found in various exalted and uni-
versal degrees in the Festival (   ‘ E i d   )  Prayers, the prayers for rain, and those 
recited at solar and lunar eclipses, and in prayers performed in congregation. 
This is the reason for the importance of the marks and observances of Islam, 
even if of the category of Sunna.

A Short Addendum

The  All-Powerful  and  All-Knowing  One,  the  All-Wise  Maker,  shows 
His power and His wisdom and that chance can in no way interfere in His 
works through the system and order His rules and practices demonstrate in 
the universe in the form of laws. So too, through exceptions to the laws, the 
wonders of His practices, changes of form, differences in individual charac-
teristics, and changes in the times of appearance and descent, He shows His 
volition, will, choice, that He is the volitional Agent, and that He is under no 
restrictions whatsoever. Thus, rending the veil of monotony and proclaim-
ing that everything is in need of Him every moment for everything in every 
way and is obedient to His dominicality, He dispels heedlessness and turns 
the gazes of humankind and the jinn from causes to the Producer of Causes. 
The statements of the Qur’an look to this principle.

For example, in most places fruit-bearing trees produce fruit one year, 
that is, it is given to their hands from the treasury of mercy, and they offer 
it. Then the following year while all apparent causes are present, they do 
not take it and offer it; that is, they do not produce fruit. Also, for example, 
contrary  to  other  necessities,  rainfall  is  so  unpredictable  that  it  has  been 
included  among  the  Five  Hidden  Things  ( 31:34 )  .  For  the  most  important 
position in existence is that of life and mercy. And rain is the source of life 
and  pure  mercy.  Thus,  the  water  of  life  and  rain  of  mercy  does  not  enter 
under  a  monotonous  law,  which  is  a  veil  and  conducive  to  heedlessness, 
rather, the All-Glorious One, Who is Most Merciful and All-Compassionate 
and  is  the  Bestower  of  Bounties  and  Giver  of  Life,  holds  it  in  His  hand 
directly, without veil, so that the doors of supplication and thanks will all the 
time be left open. And, for example, the giving of sustenance and determin-
ing  of  particular  features  are  works  of  special  favour,  and  their  occurring 
in unexpected ways shows in excellent fashion the will and choice of the 
Sustainer. You may make further comparisons with other divine acts, such 
as the disposals of the air and weather and the subjugation of the clouds.

( 6:32 )  v u t s r q 

[ This Word consists of two elevated stations, and one brilliant addendum. ]

The All-Compassionate Creator, the Muniﬁcent Provider, the All-Wise 
Maker  made  this  world  in  the  form  of  a  festival  and  celebration  for  the 
World of Spirits and spirit beings. Adorning it with the wondrous embroi-
deries of all His names, He clothes each spirit, great or small, elevated or 
lowly, in a body decked out with senses, suitable to it and appropriate for 
beneﬁting  from  the  innumerable,  various  good  things  and  bounties  in  the 
festival; He gives each a corporeal being and sends it to the spectacle once. 
And He divides the festival, which is very extensive in regard to both time 
and space, into centuries, years, seasons, and even days and their parts, and 
makes them all exalted festivals in the form of parades for all the groups of 
His creatures with spirits and for His plant and vegetable artefacts. Espe-
cially the face of the earth in spring and summer, it is a series of festivals for 
the groups of small beings so glittering it draws the gazes of the spirit beings 
and angels and the dwellers of the heavens in the high levels of the world. 
For those who think and contemplate it is a place for reﬂection so wonderful 
the mind is powerless to describe it. But in the face of the manifestations 
of the divine names of Most Merciful and Giver of Life in this divine feast 
and dominical festival, the names of Subduer and Dealer of Death appear 
with death and separation. And this is apparently unconformable with the 
all-embracing mercy of,

ٍء ْى َ(cid:130)  َ

ّلﯭﯦ يِ(cid:99) َ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:110)َر  ْتَ(cid:151) ِ(cid:126)َو

235

236

THE WORDS

However, in reality there are several ways in which it is conformable and 
one of these is as follows:

After each group of beings has completed its turn in the parade and the 
desired results have been obtained from it, compassionately the Most Gener-
ous Maker and Compassionate Creator makes most of them feel weariness 
and disgust with the world, and bestows on them a desire for rest and a long-
ing to migrate to another world. And when they are to be discharged from 
their duties of life, He awakens in their spirits a compelling desire for their 
original home. 

Moreover, it is not far from the inﬁnite mercy of the Most Merciful that 
just as He bestows the rank of martyrdom on a soldier who perishes per-
forming his duty of ﬁghting, and rewards a sheep slaughtered sacriﬁcially by 
giving it an eternal corporeal existence in the hereafter and the rank of being 
a mount for its owner on the Bridge of Sirat 1 like Buraq; so too with other 
animals and beings with spirits who perish while performing the dominical 
duties peculiar to their natures and obeying the divine commands, and who 
suffer severe distress – it is not unlikely that there should be for them in the 
inexhaustible treasuries of His mercy a sort of spiritual reward and kind of 
wage suitable to their capacities, and that they should not be unduly troubled 
at departing this world, indeed, that they should be pleased.

Man, however, is the noblest of beings with spirits and the one who ben-
eﬁts  most  from  the  festivals  with  regard  to  both  quality  and  quantity;  he 
is captivated by the world and absorbed in it, but as a work of mercy, the 
Most Merciful induces in him a state of mind whereby he feels disgust at the 
world and a longing to travel to the eternal realm. A person whose human-
ity is not plunged in misguidance proﬁts from that state of mind and departs 
with a tranquil heart. Now, by way of example, we shall explain ﬁve of the 
aspects which produce it.

•   T h e   F i r s t :  By showing with the season of old age the stamp of transi-
ence  and  decline  on  the  beautiful,  inviting  things  of  this  world  and  their 
bitter meaning, it makes a person feel disgust at the world and causes him to 
seek a permanent beloved in place of the transient.

•   T h e   S e c o n d :  Since ninety-nine per cent of the friends to whom a person 
is attached have departed this world and settled in another, impelled by his 
heartfelt love, it bestows on him a longing for the place they have gone to, 
and makes him meet death and the appointed hour with joy.

•   T h e   T h i r d :   Due  to  certain  circumstances,  it  makes  a  person  realize 
the  inﬁnite weakness and impotence of human beings, and understand how 
heavy are the burdens of life and responsibilities of living, and awakens in 
him a serious wish for rest and a sincere desire to go to another world.

•   T h e   F o u r t h :  Through the light of belief, it shows to the believer’s heart 
that death is not execution but a change of abode; that the grave is not the 
mouth  of  a  dark  well  but  the  door  to  light-ﬁlled  worlds;  and  that  for  all 
its glitter, the world resembles a prison in relation to the hereafter. To be 
released  from  the  prison  of  this  world  and  enter  the  gardens  of  Paradise, 
and  pass  from  the  troublesome  turmoil  of  bodily  life  to  the  world  of  rest 
and the arena where spirits soar, and to slip free from the vexatious noise of 
creatures and go to the presence of the Most Merciful is a journey, indeed, a 
happiness, to be desired with a thousand lives.

•   T h e   F i f t h :   By  informing  the  person  who  heeds  the  Qur’an  concern-
ing the knowledge of reality it contains, and through the light of reality the 
world’s true nature, it makes him realize that love for the world and attach-
ment to it are quite meaningless. That is, it says the following to humanity, 
and proves it:

“ The world is a book of the Eternally Besought One. Its letters and words 
point not to themselves but to the essence, attributes and names of another. 
In which case, learn its meaning and grasp it, but ignore its decorations, then 
go!

“ The world is also an arable ﬁeld;  1 sow and reap your crop, then pre-

serve it. Throw away the chaff and give it no importance!

“ The world is also a collection of mirrors which continuously pass on 
one after the other; so know the Being Who is manifested in them, see His 
lights, understand the manifestations of the names which appear in them and 
love the One they signify. Sever your attachment to the fragments of glass, 
which are doomed to be broken and perish!

“ The world is also a travelling place of trade. So do your commerce and 
come; don’t chase in vain the caravans which ﬂee from you and pay you no 
attention. Don’t weary yourself for nothing!

1.  See, al-Ghazālī, I ḥ y ā ’  ‘ U l ū m   a l - D ī n , iv, 19; al-Sahāwī, a l - M a q ā ṣ i d   a l - Ḥ a s a n a , 497.

238

THE WORDS

“ The world is also a temporary exhibition. So gaze on it and take les-
sons. Pay attention, not to its apparent, ugly face, but to its hidden, beautiful 
face which looks to the Eternal All-Beauteous One. Go for a pleasant and 
beneﬁcial promenade, then return. Don’t weep like a silly child at the disap-
pearance of scenes displaying ﬁne views and showing beautiful things, and 
don’t feel anxious!

“ The world is also a guesthouse. So eat and drink within the limits  per-
mitted by the Generous Host Who made it, and offer thanks. Act and behave 
within the bounds of His law. Then leave it without looking behind you, and 
go! Don’t interfere in it in a delirious or ofﬁcious manner. Don’t busy your-
self for nothing with things which part from you and do not concern you. 
Don’t attach yourself to passing things and drown! ”

This Fifth Aspect discloses the secrets in the world’s inner face through 
apparent truths like these and greatly lightens the parting from it. Indeed, 
to the aware it makes parting desirable, and shows that there is a trace of 
mercy in everything and in every aspect of it. The Qur’an indicates these ﬁve 
aspects and its verses point to other particular aspects too.

Woe to the person who has no share of these ﬁve aspects!

O my Sustainer! Heedlessly not trusting in You but in my own power and 
will, I cast an eye over ‘the six aspects’ searching for a cure for my ills. Alas, 
I could ﬁnd no cure for them, and I understood I was being told: “ Are your 
ills not sufﬁcient as cure for you? ”

(cid:219) ْ(cid:249)َ(cid:301) َ(cid:296)  ِر َ(cid:239)َ(cid:330)  ِرا َ(cid:245) َ(cid:296)  ْزوُر ى ِد (cid:303)ــِכ  ْم َ(cid:239)(cid:314) ِد (cid:309) ِ(cid:296) (cid:219) ْ(cid:248)ا َر  ْرَد

In heedlessness I looked to the past on my right to ﬁnd solace, but I saw 
that yesterday appeared as my father’s grave and past time as the vast tomb 
of all my forbears. It ﬁlled me with horror rather than consolation.( * )

( * ) Belief shows that horriﬁc vast grave to be a familiar and enlightened meet-
ing and a gathering of friends.

Then I looked to the future on the left, but again could ﬁnd no cure. For 
tomorrow appeared as my grave and the future as the vast tomb of my con-
temporaries  and  the  forthcoming  generations;  it  afforded  a  feeling  not  of 
familiarity, but of fright.( * )

( * ) Belief and the peace of belief shows that terrible huge grave to be a feast 
of the Most Merciful in delightful palaces of bliss.

Since no good appeared from the left either, I looked at the present day 
and I saw that it resembled a bier; it was bearing my desperately struggling 
corpse.( * )

( * ) Belief shows the bier to be a place of trade and a glittering guesthouse.

dering, which is the basis of the translation here. ( Tr. )

(cid:243)َ(cid:214)

Thus, I could ﬁnd no cure from this aspect either, so I raised my head and 
looked at the top of the tree of my life. But I saw that its single fruit was my 
corpse; it was looking down on me from the tree-top.( * )

( * ) Belief shows the tree’s fruit to be not the corpse, but the worn-out home of 
my spirit, which will manifest eternal life and is destined for everlasting hap-
piness, from which it has departed to travel among the stars.

(cid:219) ْ(cid:249)َ(cid:301) َ(cid:296)  ِمאَ(cid:269) ِ(cid:272)  ِ(cid:243)َ(cid:221) ْ(cid:249)ــِכא َ(cid:236)  َو  ْ(cid:299) َ(cid:296)  ِ(cid:219)َ(cid:285)ْ(cid:293) ِ(cid:236)  ِكא َ(cid:236)  ِبۤا  ْم َ(cid:239)َ(cid:284)  ْرَد

Despairing of that aspect too, I lowered my head. I looked and saw that 
the dust of my bones underfoot had mixed with the dust of my ﬁrst creation. 
It afforded no cure, but added further pain to my ills.( * )

( * ) Belief shows the dust to be the door leading to mercy and a curtain before 
the halls of Paradise.

(cid:219) ْ(cid:249) َ(cid:339)(cid:315) ِ(cid:304)  ْرَد  ْ(cid:337)(cid:315) ِ(cid:304) ْدא

ْ(cid:247)َ(cid:330)  ْرَد  ْن(cid:307)ُ(cid:338)

I turned away from that too and looked behind me, where I saw a tran-
sient  world  without  foundation  revolving  and  departing  in  the  valleys  of 
nothingness and darkness of non-existence. It was no salve for my ills, it 
rather added the poison of horror and fright.( * )

( * )  Belief  shows  the  world  revolving  in  darkness  to  consist  of  missives  of 
the Eternally Besought One and pages of divine inscriptions, which, having 
completed their duties and expressed their meanings, have left their results in 
existence in their place.

ْ(cid:251)(cid:315)ِ(cid:330)  ْرَد َو

Since I could see no good in that either, I switched my gaze to before me. 
I saw that the door of the grave stood open at the end of my road. The high-
way leading to eternity beyond it, struck my gaze from afar.( * )

( * ) Since belief shows the door of the grave to open onto the world of light 
and the road to eternal happiness, it was both a salve for my ills and a cure.

(cid:243) َ(cid:296)

Thus, rather than receiving consolation and a feeling of familiarity, I felt 
only horror and fear at these six aspects. Apart from the faculty of will I had 
nothing to withstand them with and act in the face of them.( * )

THE WORDS

( * ) Belief gives a document for relying on an inﬁnite power in place of the 
power of choice, which is like the smallest indivisible particle; indeed, belief 
itself is a document.
(cid:315)ـَ(cid:272) 

(cid:295)ــ َ(cid:304) ، ْ(cid:245)ـ
But the human weapon called the faculty of will both lacks power and its 
range is short. And it is inaccurate. It cannot create, and apart from ‘acquir-
ing,’ can do nothing.( * )

(cid:295)ــ َ(cid:304) ء ْ(cid:245)ـ ُ(cid:228) وُا (cid:303)ــِכ

(cid:219) ْ(cid:248) َرא

ِ(cid:228)אَ(cid:272) 

(cid:295)ــَכ 

( * )  Belief  causes  the  faculty  of  will  to  be  employed  in  Allah’s  name,  and 
makes it sufﬁcient before everything it may face. As when a soldier employs 
his  insigniﬁcant  strength  on  account  of  the  state,  he  can  perform  deeds  far 
surpassing his own strength.

(cid:219) ْ(cid:248)َذ(cid:307)ُ(cid:281)ُ(cid:300)  ِرا َ(cid:239) َ(cid:296)  ْ(cid:291)ـ

It can neither penetrate the past nor discern the future and was without 

beneﬁt in the face of my hopes and fears concerning these.( * )

( * ) Belief takes its reins from the hand of the animal body and hands them 
over to the heart and the spirit, and may therefore penetrate the past and the 
future. For the sphere of life of the heart and spirit is broad.

instant.

Thus, despite all my needs and weakness, want and poverty, and my 
wretched  state  induced  by  the  horrors  and  terrors  arising  from  the  six 
aspects, desires stretching to eternity and hopes spreading through inﬁn-
ity were clearly written on the page of my being by the pen of power, and 
included in my nature.

In  fact,  however  far  the  imagination  stretches,  needs  extend  that  far. 
There is need there too. Whatever man lacks, he is in need of. What he does 
not have, he needs. And what he lacks is endless.

So, what use is the faculty of will, worth nothing in relation to my needs 
which encompass the world and can only be obtained for millions of liras? 
They cannot be bought with it and cannot be gained by it. In which case, one 
has to search for another solution.

The solution is this: to forego one’s own will and leave matters to the 
divine will; to give up one’s own power and strength, and seeking refuge in 
the power and strength of Almighty Allah, to adhere to true reliance on Him.

in the boundless darkness of the night, while the honey-bee does not rely on 
itself so ﬁnds the sun of daytime and gazes on its friends, the ﬂowers, gilded 
with the sunlight; if you rely on yourself and your own being and your ego, 
you will resemble the ﬁreﬂy. Whereas if you sacriﬁce your transient being in 
the way of the Creator Who gave it to you, you will  become like the honey-
bee and ﬁnd an unending light of existence. So sacriﬁce it! For your being is 
a trust given to you for safekeeping.

Moreover, it is His property, it is He Who bestowed it. So don’t reject 
the favour, sacriﬁce it unhesitatingly. Sacriﬁce it so that it will be made per-
manent. For negation of a negation is an afﬁrmation. That is, if non-being 
is not, there is being. If non-being is negated, existence comes into being.

Yes, within the bounty the bestowal is to be seen and the Most Merci-
ful’s favour perceived. Passing from bounty to bestowal, you will ﬁnd the 
Bestower. Also, like a missive, each work of the Eternally Besought One 
makes known the All-Glorious Maker’s names. If you pass from the decora-
tion to the meaning, by way of His names you will ﬁnd the One signiﬁed. 
Since you can ﬁnd the kernel, the essence, of these ephemeral beings, obtain 
it. Then without pity you can throw away their meaningless shells and exter-
nals onto the ﬂood of ephemerality.

It seeks a true path leading to reality. The spirit, however, has withdrawn 
from  “ those  that  set ”  and  the  ephemeral,  and  the  heart  has  renounced  its 
metaphorical  beloveds  and  the  conscience  turned  its  face  from  transitory 
beings. So, like Abraham, my wretched soul, you too seek the assistance of 
L K J and be saved.

How well Mawlana Jami expressed it! For his self was kneaded with love 

and intoxicated with the cup of ardour:

That is, 
1. Want only One; the rest are not worth wanting.
2. Call One; the others will not come to your assistance.
3. Seek One; the rest are not worth it.
4. See One; the others are not always to be seen; they hide themselves 

behind the veil of ephemerality.

5.  Know  One;  knowledge  other  than  that  which  assists  knowledge  of 

Him is without beneﬁt.

6.  Say  One;  words  not  concerning  Him  may  be  considered  meaningless.

1.  Only this line is Mawlana Jami’s. ( Author )

[ About twenty-ﬁve years ago on Yûşa Tepesi ( Mount Joshua ) above 
the Istanbul Bosphorus, at a time I had decided to give up the world, a 
number of important friends came to me in order to call me back to the 
world and my former position. I told them to leave me till the following 
morning so that I might seek guidance. That morning the following two 
tables were imparted to my heart. They resemble poetry, but they are 
not. For the sake of that blessed memory I have not changed them; they 
have been preserved as they occurred to me. They were appended to 
the Twenty-Third Word, but have now been included here on account 
of their station. ]

[ Twenty-ﬁve years ago in Ramadan after the Afternoon Prayer, I read 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qadir Geylani’s versiﬁed piece about the most beauti-
ful names. I felt a desire to write a supplication with the divine names, 
and at that time only this much was written. I wanted to write a sup-
plication similar to that of my holy master, but, alas! I have no ability to 
write poetry and it left much to be desired. Nevertheless, it was added to 
the Thirty-Third Letter of the Thirty-Third Word, known as the Thirty-
Three Windows, then was included here on account of its station. ]

A Fruit

THE WORDS

A Fruit of the Pine, Cedar, Juniper,
and Black Cypress Trees
in the Uplands of Barla

[ While being a part of the Eleventh Letter, this has been included here 
on account of its station. ]

One  time  during  my  captivity  a  gentle  breeze  was  blowing  as  I  gazed 
at  the  majestic  and  wonderful  forms  of  the  pine,  cedar,  and  juniper  trees 
on  the  mountain  top.  Then  the  scene  was  transformed  into  a  magniﬁcent, 
delightful, and clamorous display of dancing and a rapturous performance 
of praise and gloriﬁcation, and the delight at beholding became instruction 
for my eyes and wisdom for my ears. I suddenly recalled the Kurdish lines 
of Ahmad al-Jizri:

The heart reads the mystery of divine unity in these trees, each like an 
embodied sign, from the elevated composition of their inimitability. That is, 
there is so wonderful an order, art, and wisdom in the manner of their crea-
tion, that if all the causes in existence had the power to act and choose, and 
they gathered together, they could not imitate them.

The imagination sees that appointed angels have entered these trees like 
bodies, from whose branches hang many ﬂutes. It is as though an Eternal 
Monarch has clothed the angels in the trees for a splendid parade accompa-

to be not lifeless, unconscious bodies, but highly conscious and meaningful.

The Utterance of the Stars

[ One  time  at  night  in  a  high  spot  on  Çamdağı  ( the  Pine  Mountain ) 
near Barla I was looking at the face of the heavens when the following 
lines  suddenly  occurred  to  me.  With  the  imagination  I  heard  the  the 
stars  speaking  through  the  tongue  of  disposition,  and  that  is  how  the 
lines were written. I do not know the rules of versiﬁcation, so they were 
written not according to the rules but as they occurred to me. The piece 
has been taken from the Fourth Letter and from the last part of the First 
Stopping Place of the Thirty-Second Word. ]

A Chastening Slap for my Evil-Commanding Soul

O my foolish soul, charmed by glory, enamoured of fame, addicted to 
praise, and without equal in egotism! If it is a just claim that the source of the 
ﬁg tree and its thousands of fruits is its tiny seed, and that all the grapes in 
their hundred bunches hanging from a dry vine branch are produced through 
the skill of the branch, and that those who beneﬁt from them should praise 
and esteem the branch and the seed, then perhaps you have the right to be 
proud and conceited about the bounties with which you are loaded. But in 
fact you deserve to be constantly chided, because you do not resemble the 
seed and the branch: since you have the faculty of will, you reduce the value 
of  those  bounties  through  your  pride.  Through  your  conceit,  you  destroy 
them; through your ingratitude, you nullify them; through claiming them as 
your own, you lay hands on them unlawfully. Your duty is not to glory in 
your deeds, but to offer thanks. What is ﬁt for you is not fame, but humility 
and shame. Your right is not praise, it is repentance and to seek forgiveness. 
Your perfection lies not in self-centredness, but in recognizing Allah. 

263

264

THE WORDS

Yes, you in my body resemble nature in the world. Both of you were cre-
ated to receive good and be the thing to which evil is referred. That is to say, 
you are not the agent and source, but the recipient and passive. You have 
only an effect, and that is being the cause of evil because you did not accept 
as you should have done a good arising from absolute good. Also  you were 
both created as veils, so that things that are apparently ugly, whose beauty 
is not obvious, would be attributed to you, and you would be means of the 
Most Holy Divine Essence being acknowledged to be free of defect. But you 
have taken on a form entirely contrary to the duty of your natures. Although 
out of your incapacity you have transformed good into evil, you as though 
act as partners to your Creator. That means one who worships himself and 
worships nature is extremely foolish and perpetrates a great wrong.

And do not say: “ I am a place of manifestation, and one who manifests 
beauty becomes beautiful. ” For since you have not assimilated it, you are 
not a place of manifestation but a place of passage.

And do not say: “ Among people I was chosen. These fruits, these ﬁne 
works, are shown through me. I must therefore have some merit. ” No! Allah 
forbid! Rather they were given to you ﬁrst because you are more bankrupt, 
needy, and sad than everyone else! 1

SECOND POINT

This point elucidates one meaning of the verse:

and is as follows:

( 32:7 )  x w v u

In everything, even the things which appear to be the most ugly, there 
is an aspect of true beauty. Yes, everything in the universe, every event, is 
either in itself beautiful, which is called essential beauty, or it is beautiful 
in  regard  to  its  results,  which  is  called  relative  beauty.  There  are  certain 
events which are apparently ugly and confused, but beneath that apparent 
veil reside truly shining instances of beauty and order.

Beneath the veil of stormy rains and muddy soil in the season of spring 
are  hidden  the  smiles  of  innumerable  beautiful  ﬂowers  and  well-ordered 
plants.  And  behind  the  veils  of  autumn’s  harsh  destruction  and  mournful 
separations the amiable small animals, the friends of the coy ﬂowers, are dis-
charged from the duties of their lives so as to preserve them from the blows

and torments of winter events, which are manifestations of divine might and 
glory. Under this veil the way is paved for the new and beautiful spring.

Beneath the veil of such events as storms, earthquakes, and plague numer-
ous hidden immaterial ﬂowers unfold. The seeds of many latent potentiali-
ties sprout and grow beautiful on account of events which are  apparently 
ugly. As though general upheavals and universal change are immaterial rain. 
But because man is both enamoured of the apparent and is self-centred, he 
considers  only  the  externals  and  pronounces  them  ugly.  Since  he  is  self-
centred, he reasons according to the result which looks to himself and judges 
it to be ugly. Whereas, if one of their aims looks to man, thousands look to 
their Maker’s names. 

For example, one reckons to be harmful and meaningless thorned plants 
and  trees,  which  are  among  the  great  miracles  of  the  Creator’s  power. 
Whereas they are the well-equipped heroes of the grasses and trees. And for 
example, hawks harrying sparrows is apparently incompatible with mercy, 
but due to it, the sparrow’s abilities unfold. And for example, one considers 
the snow to be cold and uninviting, but under its chilly, unpleasing veil are 
aims so warm and results so sweet they defy description. Also, since man 
is  self-centred  and  worships  the  apparent  and  therefore  judges  everything 
according  to  the  face  that  looks  to  him,  he  supposes  to  contrary  to  good 
manners many things that are perfectly polite and correct. For example, in 
his view, discussion of his sexual organ is shameful. But this veil of shame 
pertains to the face which looks to human beings, whereas the faces that look 
to creation, and art, and to its aims and purposes are veils which if consid-
ered with the eye of wisdom, are perfectly correct. Shame does not touch 
them at all.

Thus, certain expressions of the All-Wise Qur’an, the source of politeness 
and right conduct, are in accordance with these faces and veils. Beneath the 
apparent faces of creatures and events which seem ugly to us, are extremely 
ﬁne,  wise  art  and  beautiful  faces  looking  to  their  creation,  which  look  to 
their  Maker.  Similarly,  there  are  numerous  beautiful  veils  which  conceal 
their wisdom, and moreover, great numbers of apparent instances of disor-
der and confusion which in fact are regular, sacred writing.

THIRD POINT

( 3:31 ) E D C B A @ ? > 
Since in the universe there is observedly beauty of art, and this is certain, 
it necessitates the messengership of Muhammad ( UWBP ) with a certainty as 
deﬁnite as actually witnessing it. For the beauty of art and ﬁnely ornamented 

266

THE WORDS

forms of these beautiful creatures show that their Fashioner possesses a sig-
niﬁcant will to make beautiful and a powerful desire to adorn. And this will 
and desire show that the Maker possesses an elevated love and sacred incli-
nation towards the perfections of the art He displays in His creatures. And 
this love and inclination require to be most turned  towards and concentrated 
on man, the most enlightened and perfect of beings. For he is the conscious 
fruit  of  the  tree  of  creation.  And  the  fruit  is  the  most  comprehensive  and 
furthest part, the part with the most general view and universal conscious-
ness. And of human beings the one with the most comprehensive view and 
universal consciousness should be the most elevated and brilliant, who will 
meet with and be addressed by the Beauteous Maker; who will expend his 
universal consciousness and comprehensive view entirely on the worship of 
his Maker, the appreciation of His art, and offering thanks for His bounties.
Now, two signboards, two spheres, appear. One is a magniﬁcent, well-
ordered sphere of dominicality and exquisitely fashioned, bejewelled sign-
board of art. The other is an enlightened and illumined sphere of worship 
and broad, comprehensive signboard of thought and reﬂection, admiration, 
thanks, and belief. This second sphere acts with all its strength in the name 
of the ﬁrst sphere.

Thus, it will be clearly understood how closely connected with the Maker 
is the leader of the second sphere, which serves all the Maker’s art-cherish-
ing aims, and how beloved and acceptable he is in His eyes.

Is it at all reasonable to accept that the muniﬁcent Fashioner of these ﬁne 
creatures,  Who  so  loves  His  art  and  even  takes  into  consideration  all  the 
tastes  of  the  mouth,  would  remain  indifferent  towards  His  most  beautiful 
creature, who is worshipfully turned towards Him in a clamour of admira-
tion and appreciation which makes the Throne and earth reverberate and in 
a litany of thanks and exaltation which brings to ecstasy the land and the 
sea? Would He not speak with him and want to make him His Messenger 
and wish his commendable conduct to pass to others? It is impossible that 
He would not speak with him and make him His Messenger. By no means!

Yes, this Word is beautiful, but what makes it so is the most beautiful of 

all things, the attributes and qualities of Muhammad ( UWBP ).

This Word consists of fourteen Droplets and is also the Fourteenth Flash.

FIRST DROPLET

There are three great and universal things which make known to us our 
Sustainer. One is the book of the universe, a jot of whose testimony we have 
heard from the thirteen Flashes together with the thirteenth lesson from the 
Arabic  R i s a l e - i   N u r . Another is the Seal of the Prophets ( Upon whom be 
blessings  and  peace ),  the  supreme  sign  of  the  book  of  the  universe.  The 
other  is  the  Qur’an  of  Mighty  Stature.  Now  we  must  become  acquainted 
with  the  Seal  of  the  Prophets  ( UWBP ),  who  is  the  second  and  articulate 
proof, and must listen to him.

Yes, consider the collective personality of this proof: the face of the earth 
has  become  his  mosque,  Mecca,  his  mihrab,  and  Medina,  his  pulpit.  Our 
Prophet ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), this clear proof, is leader of 
all the believers, preacher to all mankind, the chief of all the prophets, lord 
of all the saints, the leader of a circle for the remembrance of Allah com-
prising all the prophets and saints. He is a luminous tree whose living roots 
are all the prophets, and fresh fruits are all the saints; whose claims all the 
prophets relying on their miracles and all the saints relying on their wonder-
َ(cid:202) All 
working conﬁrm and corroborate. For he declares and claims: ُ
on right and left, that is, those luminous reciters of Allah’s names lined up in 
the past and the future, repeat the same words, and through their consensus 

ّ(cid:202)ِا َهٰ(cid:170)ِا  ٓ

ّ(cid:195)ا  َ

268

ٰ
NINETEENTH WORD

269

in effect declare: “ You speak the truth and what you say is right! ” What 
false idea has the power to meddle in a claim which is thus afﬁrmed and 
corroborated by thousands?

SECOND DROPLET

Just as that luminous proof of divine unity is afﬁrmed by the unanimity 
and  consensus  of  those  two  wings,  so  do  hundreds  of  indications  in  such 
revealed scriptures as the Torah and Bible, 1 all conﬁrm and corroborate him 
as do the thousands of signs that appeared before the beginning of his mis-
sion, and the well-known news given by the voices from the Unseen and the 
unanimous  testimony  of  the  soothsayers,  the  indications  of  the  thousands 
of his miracles like the Splitting of the Moon, and the justice of Shari‘a. So 
too, his person and his laudable morals, which were at the summit of perfec-
tion; and in his duties, his complete conﬁdence and elevated qualities, which 
were of the highest excellence, and his extraordinary fear of Allah, worship, 
seriousness, and fortitude, which demonstrated the strength of his belief, and 
his total certainty and his complete steadfastness, – these all show as clearly 
as the sun how utterly faithful he was to his cause.

THIRD DROPLET

If you wish, come! Let us go to Arabian Peninsula, to the Era of Bliss! In 
our imaginations we shall see him at his duties and visit him. Look! We see a 
person distinguished by his ﬁne character and beautiful form. In his hand is a 
miraculous book and on his tongue, a truthful address; he is delivering a pre-
eternal sermon to all humankind, indeed, to humans, the jinn, and the angels, 
and to all beings. He solves and expounds the strange riddle of the mystery 
of the world’s creation; he discovers and solves the abstruse talisman which 
is the mystery of the universe; and he provides convincing and satisfying 
answers to the three awesome and difﬁcult questions that are asked of all 
beings  and  have  always  bewildered  and  occupied  minds:  “ Where  do  you 
come from? What are you doing here? What is your destination? ”

FOURTH DROPLET

See! He spreads such a light of truth that if you look at the universe as 
being outside the luminous sphere of his truth and guidance, you see it to 
be  like  a  place  of  general  mourning,  and  beings  strangers  to  one  another 

1.  In his R i s a l e - i   H a m i d i y e , Husayn Jisri includes one hundred and fourteen indica-
tions he discovered in those scriptures. If this many have remained after the texts have 
become corrupted, there were surely many explicit mentions before.

270

THE WORDS

and hostile, and inanimate beings to be like ghastly corpses and living crea-
tures like orphans weeping at the blows of death and separation. Now look!  
Through  the  light  he  spreads,  that  place  of  universal  mourning  has  been 
transformed into a place where Allah’s names and praises are recited in joy 
and ecstasy. The foreign, hostile beings have become friends and brothers. 
While the dumb, dead inanimate creatures have all become familiar ofﬁcials 
and docile servants. And the weeping, complaining orphans are seen to be 
either reciting Allah’s names and praises or offering thanks at being released 
from their duties.

FIFTH DROPLET

Also, through that Being’s light, the motion and movement of the uni-
verse, and its variations, changes, and transformations cease being meaning-
less, futile, and the playthings of chance; they rise to being dominical mis-
sives, pages inscribed with the signs of creation, mirrors to the divine names, 
and the world itself becomes a book of the Eternally Besought One’s wis-
dom.  Man’s  boundless  weakness  and  impotence,  poverty  and  need,  make 
him inferior to all other animals, while his intelligence, an instrument for 
conveying grief, sorrow, and sadness, makes him more wretched, yet when 
he is illumined with that light, he rises above all animals and all creatures. 
Through entreaty, his illuminated impotence, poverty, and intelligence make 
him  a  petted  monarch;  due  to  his  complaints,  he  becomes  a  spoiled  vice-
gerent of the earth. That is to say, if it were not for that Being’s light, the 
universe and man, and all things, would be nothing. Yes, certainly such a 
person is necessary in such a wondrous universe; otherwise the universe and 
ﬁrmaments would not be in existence.

SIXTH DROPLET

Thus, that Being brings and announces the good news of eternal happi-
ness; he is the discoverer and proclaimer of an inﬁnite mercy, the herald and 
observer of the beauties of the sovereignty of dominicality, and the discloser 
and displayer of the treasures of the divine names. If you regard him in that 
way, that is, in regard to his being a worshipful servant of Allah, you will see 
him to be the model of love, the exemplar of mercy, the glory of humankind, 
and the most luminous fruit of the tree of creation. While if you look in this 
way, that is, in regard to his messengership, you see him to be the proof of 
Allah, the lamp of truth, the sun of guidance, and the means to happiness. 
And look! His light has lit up from east to west like dazzling lightning, and 
half the earth and a ﬁfth of mankind has accepted the gift of his guidance 

NINETEENTH WORD

271

and preserved it like life itself. So how is it that our evil-commanding souls 
and satans do not accept with all its degrees, the basis of all such a Being 

ّ(cid:202)ِا َهٰ(cid:170)ِا  ٓ
َ(cid:202)?
claimed, that is, ُ
SEVENTH DROPLET

ّ(cid:195)ا  َ

Now, consider how he eradicated in no time at all the evil, savage cus-
toms and habits of the various wild, unyielding peoples of that broad penin-
sula to which they were fanatically attached, and he decked them out with all 
the ﬁnest virtues, and made them teachers of all the world and masters to the 
civilized nations. See, it was not an outward domination, he conquered and 
subjugated their minds, spirits, hearts, and souls. He became the beloved of 
hearts, the teacher of minds, the trainer of souls, the ruler of spirits.

EIGHTH DROPLET

You know that a small habit like cigarette smoking among a small nation 
can  be  removed  permanently  only  by  a  powerful  ruler  with  great  effort. 
But look! This Being removed numerous ingrained habits from intractable, 
fanatical large nations with slight outward power and little effort in a short 
period of time, and in their place he so established exalted qualities that they 
became as ﬁrm as if they had mingled with their very blood. He achieved 
very many extraordinary feats like this. Thus, we present the Arabian Penin-
sula as a challenge to those who refuse to see the testimony of the blessed 
age of the Prophet ( UWBP ). Let them each take a hundred philosophers, go 
there, and strive for a hundred years; would they be able to carry out in that 
time one hundredth of what he achieved in a year?

NINTH DROPLET

Also, you know that an insigniﬁcant man of small standing among a small 
community in a disputed matter of small importance cannot tell a small but 
shameful  lie  brazen-faced  and  without  fear  without  displaying  anxiety  or 
disquiet enough to inform the enemies at his side of his deception. Now look 
at that Being; although he undertook a tremendous task which required an 
ofﬁcial of great authority and great standing and a situation of great security, 
can any contradiction at all be found in the words he uttered among a com-
munity of great size in the face of great hostility concerning a great cause 
and matters of great signiﬁcance, with great ease and freedom, without fear, 
hesitation, difﬁdence, or anxiety, with pure sincerity, great seriousness, and 
in an intense, elevated manner that angered his enemies? Is it at all possible 

ٰ
272

THE WORDS

that any trickery should have been involved? Allah forbid! 4 3 2 1 0 
( 53:4 )  The  truth  does  not  deceive,  and  one  who  perceives  the  truth  is  not 
deceived. His way, which is truth, is free of deception. How could a fancy 
appear to be truth to one who sees the truth, and deceive him?

TENTH DROPLET

Now, look! What curiosity-arousing, attractive, necessary, and awesome 

truths he shows, what matters he proves!

You know that what impels man most is curiosity. Even, if you were to 
be told: “ If you give half of your life and property, someone will come from 
the moon and Jupiter and tell you all about them. He will also tell you the 
truth about your future and what will happen to you, ” you would be bound 
to give them if you have any curiosity at all. Whereas that Being tells of such 
a Monarch that in His realm, the moon ﬂies round a moth like a ﬂy, and the 
moth, the earth, ﬂutters round a lamp, and the lamp, the sun, is merely one 
lamp among thousands in one guesthouse out of thousands of that Monarch. 
Also, he speaks truly of a world so wondrous and a revolution so momen-
tous that if thousands of earths were to become bombs and explode, it would 
not be all that strange. Look! Listen to the suras he recites like, 

 ( 101:1 ), 

  ( 82:1 ) # " !  ( 81:1 )# " !

Also, he speaks truly about a future in comparison with which the future 
in this world is like a tiny mirage. And he tells most seriously of a happiness 
in  comparison  with  which  all  worldly  happiness  is  but  a  ﬂeeting  ﬂash  of 
lightning in relation to an eternal sun.

ELEVENTH DROPLET

For  sure,  such  wonders  await  us  behind  the  apparent  veil  of  the  uni-
verse which is thus strange and perplexing. So a Being thus wonderful and 
extraordinary, a displayer of marvels, is necessary to tell of its wonders. It 
is apparent from that Being’s conduct that he has seen them, and sees them, 
and says that he has seen them. And he instructs us most soundly concerning 
what the Allah of the heavens and the earth, Who nurtures us with His boun-
ties,  wants  and  desires  of  us.  Everyone  should  therefore  leave  everything 
and run to and heed this Being who teaches numerous other necessary and 
curiosity-arousing truths like these. So how is it that most people are deaf 
and blind, and mad even, so that they do not see this truth and they do not 
listen to it and understand it?

NINETEENTH WORD

TWELFTH DROPLET

273

Thus, just as this Being is an articulate proof and true evidence at the 
degree of the veracity of the unity of the Creator of beings, so is he a deci-
sive proof and clear evidence for the resurrection of the dead and eternal 
happiness. Yes, with his guidance he is the reason for eternal happiness  
coming about and is the means of attaining it; so too through his prayers 
and  supplications,  he  is  the  cause  of  its  existence  and  the  reason  for  its 
creation.  We  repeat  here  this  mystery,  which  is  mentioned  in  the  Tenth 
Word, due to its station.

See! This Being prays with a prayer so supreme it is as if the Arabian 
Peninsula  and  the  earth  itself  performs  the  prayers  through  his  sublime 
prayer, and offers entreaties. See, he also entreats in a congregation so vast 
that it is as if all the luminous and perfected members of humankind from 
the time of Adam till our age and until the end of time, are following him 
and saying “ Amen ” to his supplications. And see! He is beseeching for a 
need so universal that not only the dwellers of the earth, but also those of the 
heavens, and all beings, join in his prayer, declaring: “ Yes! O our Sustainer! 
Grant it to us! We too want it! ” And he supplicates with such want, so sor-
rowfully, in such a loving, yearning, and beseeching fashion that he brings 
the whole cosmos to tears, leading them to join in his prayer.

And  see!  The  purpose  and  aim  of  his  prayer  is  such  it  raises  man  and 
the  world,  and  all  creatures,  from  the  lowest  of  the  low,  from  inferiority, 
worthlessness, and uselessness to the highest of the high; that is to having 
value,  permanence,  and  exalted  duties.  And  see!  He  seeks  and  pleads  for 
help and mercy in a manner so elevated and sweet, it is as if he makes all 
beings and the heavens and the earth hear, and bringing them to ecstasy, to 
exclaim: “ Amen, O our Allah! Amen! ” And see! He seeks his needs from 
One so Powerful, Hearing, and Muniﬁcent, One so Knowing, Seeing, and 
Compassionate, that clearly, He sees and hears the most secret need of the 
most hidden living being and its entreaties, accepts them, and has mercy on 
it. For He gives what is asked for, if only through the tongue of disposition. 
And He gives it in so Wise, Seeing, and Compassionate a form that it leaves 
no doubt that that nurturing and regulation is particular to the All-Hearing 
and All-Seeing, the Most Generous and Most Compassionate.

What does he want, this pride of the human race, who taking behind 
him all the eminent of humankind, stands on top of the world facing the 
sublime throne, and raising up his hands, is praying? What is he seeking,

THE WORDS

this unique being who is truly the glory of the cosmos? Listen! He is seek-
ing eternal happiness. He is asking for eternal life, and to meet with Allah. 
He wants Paradise. And he wants all the sacred divine names, which dis-
play  their  beauty  and  decrees  in  the  mirrors  of  beings.  Even,  if  it  were 
not for reasons for the fulﬁlment of those countless requests, like mercy, 
grace,  wisdom,  and  justice,  a  single  of  that  Being’s  prayers  would  have 
been sufﬁcient for the construction of Paradise, the creation of which is as 
easy for divine power as the creation of the spring. Yes, just as his mes-
sengership  was  the  reason  for  the  opening  of  this  place  of  examination 
and trial, so too his worship and servitude to Allah were the reason for the 
opening of the next world.

dominicality  –  would  these  permit  the  ugliness,  the  cruelty,  the  lack  of 
order of its hearing and responding to the least signiﬁcant, the least impor-
tant desires and voices, and its considering unimportant the most impor-
tant, the most necessary wishes, and its not hearing them or understanding 
them, and not carrying them out? Allah forbid! A hundred thousand times, 
Allah forbid! Such a beauty would not permit such an ugliness; it would 
not become ugly.

My imaginary friend! That is enough for now, we must return. For if 
we remain a hundred years in this age in the Arabian Peninsula, we still 
would only completely comprehend one hundredth of the marvels of that 
Being’s duties and the wonders he carried out, and we would never tire of 
watching him.

Now, come! We shall look at the centuries, turning above us. See how 
each has opened like a ﬂower through the effulgence it has received from 
that  Sun  of  Guidance!  They  have  produced  millions  of  such  enlightened 
fruits  as  Abu  Hanifa,  Shaﬁ‘i,  Abu  Bayazid  Bistami,  Shah  Geylani,  Shah 
Naqshband, Imam Ghazali, and Imam-i Rabbani. But postponing the details 
of our observations to another time, we must recite some benedictions for 
that displayer of miracles and bringer of guidance that mention a number of 
his certain miracles:

THE WORDS

FOURTEENTH DROPLET

The  All-Wise  Qur’an,  the  treasury  of  miracles  and  supreme  miracle, 
proves the prophethood of Muhammad ( UWBP ) together with divine unity 
so decisively it leaves no need for further proof. So here we shall set out its 
deﬁnition and allude to one or two ﬂashes of its miraculousness which have 
been the target of criticism.

The All-Wise Qur’an, which makes known to us our Lord and Sustainer, 
is thus: it is the pre-eternal translation of the great book of the universe; the 
discloser of the treasures of the divine names concealed in the pages of the 
earth and the heavens; the key to the truths hidden beneath the lines of events; 
the treasury of the Most Merciful’s favours and pre-eternal addresses, which 
come forth from the World of the Unseen beyond the veil of this Manifest 
World; the sun, foundation, and plan of the spiritual world of Islam, and the 
map of the worlds of the hereafter; the distinct  expounder, lucid exposition, 
articulate  proof,  and  clear  translator  of  the  divine  essence,  attributes,  and 
deeds; the instructor, true wisdom, guide, and leader of the world of human-
ity; it is both a book of wisdom and law, and a book of prayer and worship, 
and a book of command and summons, and a book of invocation and divine 
knowledge – it is book for all spiritual needs; and it is a sacred library offer-
ing books appropriate to the ways of all the saints and veracious, the puriﬁed 
and the scholars, whose ways and paths are all different.

Consider  the  ﬂashes  of  miraculousness  in  its  repetitions,  which  are 
imagined to be a fault: since the Qur’an is both a book of invocation and 
a book of prayer and a book of summons, the repetition in it is desirable, 
indeed, it is essential and most eloquent. It is not as the faulty imagine. 
For  the  mark  of  invocation  is  illumination  through  repetition.  The  mark 
of prayer is strengthening through repetition. The mark of command and 
summons  is  conﬁrmation  through  repetition.  Moreover,  everyone  is  not 
capable  of  always  reading  the  whole  Qur’an,  but  is  mostly  able  to  read 
one sura. Therefore, since the most important purposes of the Qur’an are 
included in most of the longer suras, each is like a small Qur’an. That is to 
say, so that no one should be deprived, certain of its aims, like divine unity, 
the resurrection of the dead, and the story of Moses, have been repeated. 
Also, like bodily needs, spiritual needs are various. Man is need of some 
of them every breath; as the body needs air, so the spirit needs the word 
Hū (He). Some he is in need of every hour, like “ In the Name of Allah. ” 
And so on. That means the repetition of verses arises from the repetition 

NINETEENTH WORD

277

of need. It makes the repetition in order to point out the need and awaken 
and provoke it, and to excite desire and appetite.

Also, the Qur’an is a founder; it is the basis of the Clear Religion and the 
foundation of the world of Islam. It changed human social life, and is the 
answer to the repeated questions of its various classes. Repetition is neces-
sary  for  a  founder  in  order  to  establish  things.  Repetition  is  necessary  to 
corroborate them. Conﬁrmation, veriﬁcation and repetition are necessary to 
emphasize them.

Also, it speaks of such mighty matters and minute truths that numerous 
repetitions are necessary in different forms in order to establish them in eve-
ryone’s hearts. Nevertheless, they are repetitions only apparently; in reality 
every verse has numerous meanings, numerous beneﬁts, and many aspects 
and levels. In each place they are mentioned with a different meaning, for 
different beneﬁts and purposes.

Also, the fact that the Qur’an is unspeciﬁc and concise in certain matters 
to do with cosmos is a ﬂash of miraculousness for purposes of  guidance. 
This should not be the target of criticism and is not a fault, like some atheists 
imagine.

I f   y o u   a s k :  “ Why does the All-Wise Qur’an not speak of beings in the 
same way as philosophy and science? It leaves some matters in brief form, 
and some it speaks of in a simple and superﬁcial way that is easy in the gen-
eral view, does not wound general feelings, and does not weary or tax the 
minds of ordinary people. Why is this? ”

B y   w a y   o f   a n   a n s w e r   w e   s a y :  Philosophy has strayed from the path of 
truth, that’s why. Also, of course you have understood from previous Words 
and what they teach that the All-Wise Qur’an speaks of the universe in order 
to make known the divine essence, attributes, and names. That is, it explains 
the meanings of the book of the universe to make known its Creator. That 
means it looks at beings, not for themselves, but for their Creator. Also, it 
addresses  everyone.  But  philosophy  and  science  look  at  beings  for  them-
selves and address scientists in particular. In which case, since the All-Wise 
Qur’an makes beings evidences and proofs, the evidence has to be super-
ﬁcial so that it will be quickly understood in the general view. And since 
the Qur’an of Guidance addresses all classes of men, the ordinary people, 
which form the most numerous class, want guidance which is concise with 
unnecessary things being vague, and which brings subtle things close with 
comparisons, and which does not change things that in their superﬁcial view 

278

THE WORDS

are obvious into an unnecessary or even harmful form, lest it causes them to 
fall into error.

For example, it says about the sun: “ The sun is a revolving lamp or lan-
tern. ” For it does not speak of the sun for itself and its nature, but because 
it is a sort of mainspring of an order and centre of a system, and order and 
system are mirrors of the Maker’s skill. It says:

( 36:38 ) ´ ³ 
that is, the sun revolves. Through calling to mind the orderly disposals of 
divine power in the revolutions of winter and summer, and day and night 
with  the  phrase,  “ The  sun  revolves ”,  it  makes  understood  the  Maker’s 
tremendousness. Thus, whatever the reality of this revolving, it does not 
affect the order, which is woven and observed, and which is the purpose. 
It also says,

( 71:16 ) J I H 
By depicting with the word “ l a m p  ” the world in the form of a palace and 
the things within it as decorations, necessities, and provisions prepared for 
human beings and living beings, and inferring that the sun is also a subju-
gated candleholder, it makes known the mercy and bestowal of the Creator. 
Now look and see what this foolish and prattling philosophy says:

“ The sun is a vast burning liquid mass. It causes the planets which have 
been ﬂung off from it to revolve around it. Its mass is such-and-such. It is 
this, it is that. ” It does not afford the spirit the satisfaction and fulﬁlment of 
true knowledge, just a terrible dread and fearful wonder. It does not speak of 
it as the Qur’an does. You may understand from this the value the matters 
of  philosophy  have,  whose  inside  is  hollow  and  outside,  ostentatious.  So 
don’t be deceived by its glittering exterior and be disrespectful towards the 
miraculous expositions of the Qur’an!

One  day  while  reading  these  verses,  three  points  were  imparted  to  me 
from the effulgence of the Qur’an against the promptings of Satan. His sug-
gestions took this form:

He said: “ You say the Qur’an is a miracle and of inﬁnite eloquence and 
that it is guidance for everyone at all times. So what is the meaning in its 
persistently repeating in historical form such minor events as the following: 
how  is  it  appropriate  to  mention  an  insigniﬁcant  event  like  the  slaughter-
ing of a cow as though it were something signiﬁcant, and even naming the 
important sura in which it is found, The Cow? Also the event of ‘prostrating 
before Adam’; it occurred in the realm of the Unseen and cannot be under-
stood  rationally.  It  may  be  submitted  to  and  accepted  with  certainty  only 
after  one  has  attained  a  strong  belief.  Whereas  the  Qur’an  instructs  those 
who use their ability to think; in many places it says: ( 36:68 ) َنوُ(cid:171)ِ(cid:163)ْ(cid:151)َ(cid:192)  َ(cid:203)َ(cid:158)َا and 
refers what it says to the reason. Also, how is it guidance to show certain nat-
ural conditions of rocks to be important although they result from chance? ”

The points with which I was inspired took this form:

First Point

280

TWENTIETH WORD – FIRST STATION

281

FIRST  POINT:  The  All-Wise  Qur’an  relates  numerous  minor  events 
behind which are concealed universal principles, and which are shown as the 
tips of general laws. For example,

( 2:31 ) C B A @ 
This is the teaching of the names, which was a miracle of Adam ( Upon 
whom be peace ) before the angels because of his ability to be vicegerent 
of the earth, and was a minor event. But it forms the tip of a universal prin-
ciple which is as follows: it was the teaching, due to the comprehensive 
human  disposition,  of  countless  sciences,  and  numerous  all-embracing 
branches of knowledge about the universe, and extensive learning about 
the Creator’s attributes and qualities, which afforded human beings superi-
ority over not only the angels but also the heavens and earth and mountains 
in the question of the bearing of the Supreme Trust. And just as the Qur’an 
states  that  by  reason  of  their  comprehensive  dispositions,  human  beings 
are spiritual vicegerents of the earth, so the minor event in the Unseen of 
the angels prostrating before Adam and Satan not prostrating is the tip of 
a broad and universal observed principle; these hint at an extensive truth 
which is as follows: 

By mentioning the angels’ obedience and submission before the person 
of Adam and Satan’s pride and refusal, the Qur’an makes understood that 
most  of  the  physical  beings  in  the  universe  and  their  non-physical  repre-
sentatives and appointed beings are subjugated to human beings, and that the 
human senses are predisposed and amenable to beneﬁting from all of them. 
And pointing out what a fearsome enemy and serious obstacle in the path of 
human progress are evil matter and its representatives and indwelling evil 
spirits, which corrupt human nature and drive human beings down wrong 
paths, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, while speaking of a minor mat-
ter with Adam ( Upon whom be peace ), converses in elevated fashion with 
the whole universe and all humankind.

Second Point

SECOND POINT: Although the Land of Egypt is a part of the Greater 
Sahara Desert, through the blessing of the Nile, it has become an extremely 
fertile arable ﬁeld. Such a blessed heavenly place being found adjacent to 
the hellish Sahara has made its agriculture highly sought after by its people 
and has so ﬁxed it in their characters that for them it has become sacred and 
the cow and the bull, the means of agriculture, have also become sacred and 
objects of worship even. The people of Egypt of that time considered the 
cow  and  bull  to  be  so  holy  they  worshipped  them.  Thus,  it  is  understood 

282

THE WORDS

from the question of the calf that the Children of Israel of that time, who 
grew up in Egypt, had come to have a share of that custom.

Thus, the All-Wise Qur’an makes understood through the sacriﬁce of a 
cow that through his messengership, Moses excised and destroyed the con-
cept of cow-worship, which had become a part of that nation’s character and 
worked in their very natures.

Thus, through this minor incident, it expounds with an elevated miracu-
lousness a universal principle which is essential instruction in wisdom for 
everyone at all times.

Making an analogy with this, you may understand that certain minor inci-
dents in the Qur’an which are mentioned in the form of historical events, 
are the tips of universal principles. Even, in Lemeât, in the section on the 
Miraculousness  of  the  Qur’an,  taking  the  seven  sentences  of  the  story  of 
Moses, which is mentioned and repeated in many suras, we have explained 
how each part of those particular sentences comprises an important univer-
sal principle. If you wish, you may refer to that treatise.

While reading the above verse, the Whisperer said: “ What meaning is 
there in discussing and explaining as though they were the most important 
and signiﬁcant of matters, certain natural states of rocks which are common-
place and everyone knows about? How is it ﬁtting and what need is there? ”
In the face of this suggestion, the following point was imparted to me 

from the effulgence of the Qur’an:

Yes, it is ﬁtting and there is need for it. And it is so ﬁtting and there is 
a meaning so signiﬁcant and a truth so enormous and necessary that only 
through the Qur’an’s miraculous conciseness and guiding grace has it been 
simpliﬁed to a degree and summarized. Yes, conciseness, one foundation of 
the Qur’an’s miraculousness, and guiding grace and ﬁtting instruction, which 
are one light of its guidance, require that in the face of ordinary people, who 
form the majority of those whom the Qur’an addresses, universal truths and 
profound and general principles are shown in familiar and particular forms, 

TWENTIETH WORD – FIRST STATION

283

and that, due to their simple minds, only the tips of vast truths are shown, 
and in a simple form, and, moreover, that the divine disposals, which are 
wondrous and extraordinary beneath the veil of the commonplace and under 
the earth, are shown brieﬂy. Thus, it is due to this mystery that the All-Wise 
Qur’an says the following with the above verse:

O Children of Israel and Sons of Adam! What has happened to you that 
your hearts have become harder and more lifeless than stone? For do you 
not see that those extremely hard, lifeless, huge rocks formed in vast strata 
under  the  earth  are  so  obedient  and  subjugated  before  the  divine  com-
mands and so soft and tractable under the dominical works that to what-
ever degree the divine disposals occur without resistance in the formation 
of  trees in the air, orderly water channels and veins, like the circulation 
of  blood  in  veins,  occur  with  the  same  ease  and  order  and  with  perfect 
wisdom in those hard, deaf rocks under the earth. 1 And like the way the 
branches of trees and plants spread in the air with ease encountering no 
obstacles, so too, at the divine commands the delicate veins of roots spread 
with the same ease in the rocks under the earth. The Qur’an indicates this 
and teaches an extensive truth with the verse, and by allusion says the fol-
lowing to the hard-hearted:

O Children of Israel and Sons of Adam! What sort of heart do you bear 
within your weakness and impotence so that with its hardness it resists the 
command of such a One? Whereas how perfectly and obediently the huge 
strata  of  hard  rocks  carry  out  their  delicate  duties  in  the  darkness  before 
His  commands.  They  display  no  disobedience.  Indeed,  those  rocks  act  as 
treasurers for the water of life and other means of life of all the living crea-
tures above the earth, and are the means for their division and distribution. 
They do this with such wisdom and justice that they are soft like wax or air 
in the hand of power of the All-Wise One of Glory; offering no resistance, 

1.  Yes, it is only ﬁtting that the Qur’an should explain the three important duties of 
the rock strata, the foundation stone of the majestic travelling palace known as the earth, 
which are entrusted to it by the All-Glorious Creator.

T h e i r   F i r s t   D u t y :   Just  as  earth  acts  as  a  mother  to  plants  and  raises  them  through 
dominical power, so through divine power, the rocks act as a nurse to the earth and raise it.
T h e i r   S e c o n d   D u t y :  They  serve  the  orderly  circulation  of  waters  in  the  body  of  the 

earth, like the circulation of the blood.

T h e i r   T h i r d   D u t y :  This  is  to  act  as  treasurer  to  the  rising  and  continuous  ﬂow  with 
regular balance of the springs and rivers, sources and streams. Indeed, the evidences of 
divine unity which the rocks make ﬂow with all their strength in mouthfuls in the form of 
the water of life, they write and sprinkle over the face of the earth.

284

THE WORDS

they prostrate before His mighty power. For just like well-ordered creatures 
and  wise,  gracious  divine  disposals  occur  on  top  of  the  earth,  which  we 
observe, the same occur beneath it. Indeed, divine wisdom and favour are 
manifested there more wondrously and strangely in regard to wisdom and 
order. See how like wax those hard, unfeeling mighty rocks display a soft-
ness towards the creational commands, and how they offer no resistance or 
hardness to the delicate waters, the ﬁne roots, and silken veins, which are 
divine ofﬁcials. As though like a lover, the rock’s heart melts at the touch of 
those delicate, beautiful things and becomes earth in their path.

And, with, ª © ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤   the Qur’an shows the tip of a 
vast truth which is like this: like in the event of Moses asking for the vision 
of Allah and the famous mountain crumbling  at the divine manifestation 
and  the  rocks  being  scattered,  through  the  manifestations  of  divine  glory 
in the form of earthquakes and the mountains shaking, most of which are 
like great monoliths formed of solidiﬁed liquid, and certain other geological 
occurrences – through such awesome manifestations of glory, the rocks fall 
from the high summits of the mountains and are broken up. Some of these 
crumble and being transformed into earth, become the source of plants. Oth-
ers  remain  as  rocks,  and  rolling  down  to  the  valleys  and  plains,  are  scat-
tered. They serve many purposes in the works of the earth’s inhabitants; by 
being  utilized  in  their  houses  for  example;  and  prostrating  in  submission 
before divine wisdom and power for certain hidden instances of wisdom and 
beneﬁts, they take on the form of being at the command of the principles 
of divine wisdom. The evidence that their leaving their high places out of 
awe, choosing lower places in humble fashion, and being the means of those 
signiﬁcant beneﬁts, and that they are neither futile, nor acting of their own 
accord, nor are objects of chance, but that within the disorder, through the 
wise  disposals  of  One  All-Wise  and  All-Powerful  they  are  within  a  wise 
order not apparent to the superﬁcial eye – the evidence for this are the pur-
poses and beneﬁts attached to the rocks, and the perfect order and ﬁne art 
of the shirts adorned and embossed with the jewels of the fruits and ﬂowers 
with which the bodies of the mountains down which they roll are clothed. 
These testify in a decisive fashion that cannot be doubted.

Thus,  you  have  seen  how  valuable  these  three  parts  of  the  verse  are 
from the point of view of wisdom. Now see the Qur’an’s subtle manner of 
exposition and miraculous eloquence. See how it shows through the three 
famous and observed events in the three parts of the verse, the tips of the 

TWENTIETH WORD – FIRST STATION

285

above-mentioned extensive and important truths, and by recalling three fur-
ther events, which are a warning lesson, it offers subtle guidance; its restrains 
in a way that cannot be resisted.

For example, in the second part of the verse, it says:

 ¢ ¡ ﮯ ~ } | { 
By alluding with this sentence to the rock which split with perfect eagerness 
under the Staff of Moses ( Upon whom be peace ) and poured forth twelve 
streams from twelve sources, it imparts the following meaning: O Children 
of Israel! Great rocks become soft and crumble before a single miracle of 
Moses ( UWP ). They shed tears in ﬂoods, pouring forth out of either awe or 
joy. How is it you are so unfair you are obstinate in the face of all Moses’ 
miracles, and not weeping, your eyes are lifeless and your hearts, hard?

And in the third part, it says: 

ª © ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤
By  calling  to  mind  with  this  part  the  famous  event  of  the  huge  mountain 
crumbling  and  being  scattered  out  of  awe  at  the  manifestation  of  divine 
glory, which occurred on Mount Sinai at the supplications of Moses ( Upon 
whom  be  peace ),  and  the  rocks  rolling  down  all  around  again  in  awe,  it 
teaches this meaning: O people of Moses ( UWP )! How is it that you do not 
fear Allah when the mountains which are composed of rocks are crushed and 
scattered out of awe of Him? You know that He upheld Mount Sinai above 
you to take the Covenant from you ( 2:63 ) and that the mountain crumbled 
when Moses sought the vision of Him ( 7:143 ) , and you saw it, so how is it 
you are so bold as to not tremble out of fear of Allah, and you make your 
hearts hard and unfeeling?

And, in the ﬁrst part, it says:

y x w v u t s
By  recalling  with  this  part  rivers  like  the  blessed  Nile  and  the  Tigris  and 
Euphrates, which gush up out of mountains, the Qur’an makes understood 
the  miraculous  fashion  rocks  receive  the  creational  commands  and  are 
subjugated  to  them.  It  infers  the  following  meaning  to  vigilant  hearts:  it 
is  certainly  not  possible  that  the  mountains  could  be  the  actual  source  of 
such mighty rivers. For let us suppose the water was cut completely and the 
mountains each became a conical reservoir, they would only remain a few 
months before losing the balance to the swift and abundant ﬂow of those 

286

THE WORDS

large rivers. And the rain, which penetrates only about a metre into the earth, 
would not be sufﬁcient income for that high expenditure. This means that 
the  springs  of  these  rivers  are  not  something  ordinary  and  natural  arising 
from chance, but that the All-Glorious Creator makes them ﬂow forth from 
an unseen treasury in truly marvellous fashion.

Thus, alluding to this mystery and stating this meaning, it is narrated in a 
Hadith: “ Each of those three rivers is a drop from Paradise which continu-
ously  issues  forth  from  Paradise,  as  a  result  of  which  they  are  sources  of 
abundance. ” And in another it is said: “ The source of these three rivers is 
from Paradise. ” 1 The truth of these narrations is this: since physical causes 
are not capable of producing their abundant ﬂow, their sources must be in 
an unseen world and must arise from a treasury of mercy; the equilibrium 
between their incomings and outgoings is maintained in this way. 

Thus, by inferring this meaning, the All-Wise Qur’an gives the follow-
ing instruction: O Children of Israel and Sons of Adam! With your hardness 
of heart, unfeelingness, and heedlessness you disobey and close your eyes 
to  the  commands  and  light  of  knowledge  of  the  Pre-Eternal  Sun,  One  so 
Glorious He makes ﬂow forth from the mouths of common, lifeless rocks 
mighty rivers like the blessed Nile, which transforms Egypt into a paradise 
and produces miracles of His power and witnesses to His unity for the uni-
verse’s  heart  and  earth’s  mind  as  eloquent  as  the  force,  appearance,  and 
abundant ﬂow of those mighty rivers, and makes them ﬂow to the hearts and 
minds of jinn and men. How is it that while some unfeeling, lifeless rocks 
manifest the miracles of His power in such wondrous fashion, 2 showing the 
All-Glorious Creator as the sunlight shows the sun, you are blind before the 
light of His knowledge, and do not see it?

2.  The blessed Nile rises in the Mountains of the Moon, the main stream of the River 
Tigris in a cave in the district of Müküs in the province of Van, and the main branch of 
the Euphrates, in the foothills of a mountain in the region of Diyadin. It is established by 
science that the origins of mountains are rocks solidiﬁed from liquid matter. One of the

dence that the original creation of the earth was as follows: some liquid matter solidiﬁed 
at the divine command and became rock. With divine leave, the rock became earth. The 
word Earth ( a r z  ) in the gloriﬁcation, means earth ( soil ). That is to say, the liquid matter 
was too soft to support anything and the rock was too hard to be beneﬁted from. Therefore, 
the All-Wise and Compassionate One spread the earth over the rock and made it the place 
of habitation for living beings.

[ A ﬂash of the Qur’an’s miraculousness which shines on the 
Miracles of the Prophets. ]

Note carefully the two questions and answers at the end.

Fourteen years ago ( and now thirty years have passed ) in my Qur’anic 
commentary  called  I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z   ( Signs  of  Miraculousness ),  I  wrote  a 
discussion in Arabic about one of the mysteries of this verse. Now two of my 
brothers whose wishes are important in my view have asked for an expla-
nation in Turkish of that discussion. And so, relying on Almighty Allah’s 
assistance and on the effulgence of the Qur’an, I say this:

According to one interpretation, the Clear Book or Record consists of the 
Qur’an. The above verse states that everything, fresh or dry, is found within 
it, is that so? Yes, everything is found in it, but everyone cannot see this, for 
all the things it contains are found at different levels. Sometimes the seeds, 
sometimes the nuclei, sometimes the summaries, sometimes the principles, 
sometimes the signs, are found either explicitly, or implicitly, or allusively, 
or vaguely, or as a reminder. One of these is expressed according to need, in 
a manner suitable to the purposes of the Qur’an and in connection with the 
requirements of the position. For instance:

Things like the aeroplane, electricity, railways, and the telegraph have 
come into existence as wonders of science and technology as the result of 
human progress in science and industry, and play a pivotal role in mate-
rial  life.  Surely  the  All-Wise  Qur’an,  which  addresses  all  humankind, 
does  not  neglect  these.  Indeed,  it  has  not  neglected  them;  it  indicates 
them in two ways.

T h e   F i r s t :  In the form of the miracles of the prophets.

Since numerous people have occupied themselves with this second sort, and 
they are in need of much care and elucidation, and since they are many, for 
now we shall content ourselves with the above verses that allude to the rail-
way and electricity, and shall not open that door.

As for T h e   F i r s t   S o r t , it indicates them in the form of the miracles of the 

prophets. We shall mention some of these by way of example.

Introduction

INTRODUCTION: The All-Wise Qur’an sends the prophets to human 
communities as leaders and vanguards of spiritual and moral progress. Simi-
larly it gives all of them a number of wonders and makes them the masters 
and  foremen  in  regard  to  humankind’s  material  progress,  and  commands 
men  to  follow  them  absolutely.  Thus,  just  as  by  speaking  of  the  spiritual 
and  moral  perfections  of  the  prophets,  it  is  encouraging  people  to  beneﬁt 
from them; so too in discussing their miracles it is inferring encouragement 
to achieve similar things and to imitate them. It may even be said that like 
spiritual and moral attainments, material attainments and wonders were ﬁrst 
given to humankind by the hand of miracles as a gift. Thus, it was the hand

2.  The sentence, Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ » º ¹ ¸  illuminates that allusion.

THE WORDS

of miracles that ﬁrst gave humanity the gift of the ship, which was a miracle 
of Noah ( Upon whom be peace ), and the clock, a miracle of Joseph ( Upon 
whom be peace ). A subtle allusion to this truth is the  face that most crafts-
men have a prophet as the patron of their trade. For example, seamen have 
Noah ( UWP ), watchmakers have Joseph ( UWP ), tailors have Idris ( UWP ), 
and so on.

Indeed,  investigative  scholars  and  the  science  of  rhetoric  are  in  agree-
ment that all the Qur’an’s verses contain numerous aspects of guidance and 
instruction. The verses about the miracles of the prophets are the most bril-
liant of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition’s verses; they are not therefore 
mere  historical  stories,  but  comprise  numerous  meanings  and  varieties  of 
guidance. Yes, by mentioning the prophets’ miracles, it is tracing the ﬁnal 
limit of human science and industry. It is pointing the ﬁnger at humanity’s 
furthest  aims.  It  is  specifying  its  ﬁnal  goals.  And  by  striking  the  hand  of 
encouragement on humanity’s back, it is urging it forward towards them. Just 
as the past is the store of the seeds of the future and mirror to its attributes, so 
the future is the arable ﬁeld of the past and the mirror to its states. Now we 
shall explain only a few samples of that most extensive source as examples:

For example, the verse:

( 34:12 )  w v u t s r
which  describes  one  of  Solomon’s  ( Upon  whom  be  peace )  miracles,  the 
subjugating  of  the  air.  It  says:  “ Solomon  traversed  the  distance  of  two 
months in one day by ﬂying through the air. ” It is thus suggesting that the 
road is open for humankind to cover such a distance in the air. In which case, 
O humankind! The road is open to you, so reach this level! And in meaning 
Almighty Allah is saying through the tongue of this verse: “ O humankind! 
I mounted one of my servants on the air because he gave up the desires of 
his soul. If you too give up laziness, which comes from the soul, and beneﬁt 
thoroughly from some of my laws in the cosmos, you too may mount it. ”

And the verse,

( 2:60 ) X W V   UT SRQ P O 
which  describes  a  miracle  of  Moses  ( Upon  whom  be  peace ).  This  verse 
indicates that the treasuries of mercy concealed under the earth may be prof-
ited from with simple tools. The water of life may be drawn with a staff, 
even from places hard as rock. Thus, with this meaning the verse says to 
humanity: “ You may ﬁnd the subtlest effulgence of mercy, the water of life,

with a staff. In which case, come on, work to ﬁnd it! ” And by implication 
Almighty Allah says through the verse’s allusive tongue: “ O humankind! I 
put in the hand of one of my servants who trusted in Me a staff that draws 
the water of life from wherever he wishes, if you too rely on the laws of 
My mercy, you may obtain an implement resembling it or close to it. So, 
come on and do so! ” And one of the most important contributions to human 
progress was the creation of an implement that causes water to ﬂow forth 
from most of the places it is struck. The verse traces farther goals and limits, 
and points beyond that, just as the previous verse speciﬁed ﬁnal points far 
ahead of today’s aircraft
And for example,

( 3:49 ) h g f e d c b  
which  concerns  a  miracle  of  Jesus  ( Upon  whom  be  peace ).  Just  as  the 
Qur’an explicitly urges humankind to follow Jesus’ ( Upon whom be peace ) 
high  morals,  so  it  allusively  encourages  it  towards  the  elevated  art  and 
dominical medicine of which Jesus was the master. The verse suggests the 
following: “ Remedies may be found for even the most chronic ills. In which 
case, O humanity!, O calamity-afﬂicted children of Adam! Don’t despair! 
Whatever the ill, a cure may be found. Search for it and you will ﬁnd it. It 
is possible even to give a temporary tinge of life to death. ” And by implica-
tion Almighty Allah is saying through the ﬁgurative tongue of this verse: 
“ O humankind! I gave two gifts to one of My servants who abandoned the 
world for Me. One was the remedy for spiritual ills, and the other the cure 
for physical sicknesses. Moribund hearts were raised to life through the light 
of guidance, and sick people who were as though dead found health through 
his breath and cure. You too may ﬁnd the cure for every ill in the pharmacy 
of My wisdom. Work to ﬁnd it! If you seek, you will certainly ﬁnd. ” Thus, 
this verse traces the limit which is far ahead of man’s present progress in 
medicine. It hints at it and urges him towards it.

And for example, the verses:

    ( 34:10 ) a ` _
( 38:20 ) B A @ ?

which are about David ( Upon whom be peace ), and,

( 34:12 ) | { z y 

292

THE WORDS

which  is  about  Solomon  ( Upon  whom  be  peace ).  These  indicate  that  the 
softening of iron is one of the greatest of divine bounties, through which is 
shown the virtue of one of the greatest prophets. Indeed, softening iron, that 
is, making it soft like dough, and smelting copper, and discovering minerals 
and extracting them is the origin and source, and basis and foundation of all 
humankind’s material industries. Thus, the verse indicates: “ The softening 
of iron was a great bounty bestowed on a great messenger and vicegerent of 
the earth as a great miracle. Making it as soft as dough and ﬁne as a thread 
and smelting copper are the bases of most of the general industries. ” Since 
wisdom was given to the tongue of a person who was both messenger and 
vicegerent, that is, to one who was both a spiritual and a material leader, and 
craft and industry were given him; the verse is on the one hand explicitly 
urging men towards the wisdom on his tongue, and on the other is implicitly 
encouraging them towards the craft in his hand. With the allusive tongue of 
this verse, Almighty Allah is implying this meaning:

“ O  children  of  Adam!  I  gave  such  wisdom  to  the  tongue  and  heart  of 
a servant of Mine who complied with my commands and obligations that 
he rendered judgement on everything with the ﬁnest distinction and made 
manifest the truth. And I gave him such art that he could mould iron into 
any shape in his hand as though it were wax. It was a signiﬁcant means of 
power for his vicegerency and rule. Since it is possible, it is given. For it is 
important, and you are in much need of it in your social life. If you too obey 
my commands in creation, similar wisdom and craft will be given you. You 
will attain to it in the course of time and draw close to it. ” 

Thus, it has been through the softening of iron and smelting of copper 
that humankind has achieved its greatest progress in industry, and its great-
est power and strength. In the verse, the word “ q i t r  ” is used to describe cop-
per. These verses direct humanity’s sight towards this truth; as they sternly 
warned the people of former times who did not appreciate their importance, 
so they warn the lazy of modern times.

And, for example, the verse,

 k j i h g f e d c b a ` _ ^ ]
( 27:40 ) ... o n m l
which  points  to  the  following  wondrous  event:  in  order  to  attract  Bilkis’ 
throne to him, one of Solomon’s ( Upon whom be peace ) ministers who was 
versed in the science of attraction said: “ I’ll have the throne here before you 

TWENTIETH WORD – SECOND STATION

293

before you can blink your eyes. ” The verse thus suggests that it is possible to 
bring either things themselves or their images to one instantaneously from 
far away. It is a fact that Almighty Allah bestowed this ability on Solomon 
( UWP ) in the form of a miracle, to establish his innocence and justice. For 
being  honoured  with  rulership  in  addition  to  his  messengership,  Solomon 
could in this way be informed of events in all the regions of his  extensive 
dominions, and see the condition of his subjects and hear of their ills. This 
means, if man relies on Almighty Allah, and asks it of Him with the tongue 
of his innate capacity, like Solomon ( UWP ) asked for it with the tongue of 
his chastity, and if he conforms to His laws of wisdom in the universe, the 
world may become like a town for him. That is to say, while Bilkis’ throne 
was  in  Yemen,  it  was  instantaneously  present  in  Damascus,  or  its  image 
was, and it was seen. The images of the people around the throne were also 
certainly conveyed there, and their voices were heard. This therefore indi-
cates  splendidly  the  attraction  of  images  and  sounds  from  long  distances, 
and in effect says:

“ O Kings and Rulers! If you wish to act with pure justice, endeavour to 
observe and understand the face of the earth in all its details, like Solomon. 
For, by rising to the level of being informed whenever he wishes about every 
part of his realm, a just ruler and king who cherishes his subjects will avoid 
inequity, and may rule with complete justice. ” And Almighty Allah in effect 
says through the allusive tongue of the verse:

“ O children of Adam! I bestowed on one of My servants a broad realm, 
and so that he could act completely justly within it, I allowed him to know 
personally of all situations and events that occurred there. And since I have 
given all men the innate capacity to be vicegerent of the earth, I gave them 
also the ability to see, consider, and understand the whole face of the earth 
in accordance with that ability, for My wisdom requires this. If individuals 
do not reach that point, human beings may reach it as a race. And if they do 
not reach it physically, the saints may reach it in meaning. In which case, 
you may take advantage of this great bounty. Come on, let’s see you do it! 
On condition you do not neglect your duties of worship, strive to transform 
the face of the earth into a garden every part of which you may see, and 
the sounds of every corner of which you may hear. Heed the decree of the 
Most Merciful:

The above-mentioned verse thus alludes to the farthest limit far in the future 

294

THE WORDS

in the attraction of images and sounds, one of man’s ﬁnest arts, and hints 
encouragement.

And, for example, the verses,

 & % $ # " !   ( 38:38 ) À ¿ ¾ ½
( 21:82 ) - , + * ) ( '
state that Solomon ( UWP ) subjugated jinns, satans, and evil spirits, and pre-
venting their evil, employed them usefully, and they say: the jinn, the most 
important intelligent inhabitants of the earth after man, may serve him. Con-
tact may be made with them. Devils too may be compelled to give up their 
enmity and whether they want to or not be made to serve. Thus, Almighty 
Allah subjected them to one of His servants who was obedient to His com-
mands.  Through  the  allusive  tongue  of  the  verses,  in  meaning  Almighty 
Allah is saying: “ O man! I made jinns, devils, and their evil obey one of 
My servants who obeyed Me. If you too are subjugated to my commands, 
numerous beings, and even jinns and devils, may be subjugated to you. ”

These verses trace the ﬁnal limits of the calling-up of spirits, and con-
versing with jinns, like spiritualism, which have been ﬁltered from a blend 
of art and science and have arisen from man’s extraordinary physical and 
spiritual sensitivity. The verses specify the most beneﬁcial form of these and 
open up the way to them. But this does not mean being subjugated to jinns, 
devils,  and  evil  spirits,  who  sometimes  call  themselves  the  spirits  of  the 
dead, and becoming their playthings and a laughing-stock, like nowadays, 
but means subjugating them through the talisman of the Qur’an and being 
delivered from their evil.

Other  verses  about  Solomon  ( Upon  whom  be  peace )  which  allude  to 
spirits appearing in physical form, and his calling up demons and subjugat-
ing them, and other verses besides, such as,

( 19:17 ) X W V U T S R  
indicate both the calling-up of spirits, and spirit beings assuming physical 
form. But the calling-up of good spirits alluded to here is not in the manner 
of the so-called civilized, to be disrespectful to spirits in that utterly serious 
world  and  attract  them  to  where  they  are  and  their  games,  but  –  like  one 
group of such saints as Muhyiddin al-‘Arabi, who, most seriously and for 
a  serious  purpose,  met  with  spirits  when  they  wanted  –  to  be  attracted  to 
them and to form a relation with them, and by going to where they are and 

TWENTIETH WORD – SECOND STATION

295

drawing close to their world to an extent, to beneﬁt from their spirituality. It 
is this that the verses allude to, and within the allusion, make it understood 
that they are encouraging man to achieve it. They trace the furthest limit of 
occult arts and sciences of this sort, and point to their best form.

And, for example, the verses about David’s ( Upon whom be peace ) mir-

acles:

    ( 38:18 ) 4 3 2 1 0 / . 
     ( 34:10 ) a ` _ ^ ] \ [ Z
( 27:16 ) ... H G F
These  indicate  that  Almighty  Allah  gave  to  David’s  ( UWP )  praises  and 
gloriﬁcations such strength and a sound so reverberating and agreeable they 
brought the mountains to ecstasy, which, each like a huge gramophone or a 
man, formed a circle on the horizon around the chief reciter, reciting with 
him the gloriﬁcations. Is this possible, I wonder? Is it the truth?

Yes,  it  is  the  truth.  Every  mountain  with  caves  can  speak  with  human 
being in human language like a parrot. By means of an echo. You declare: 
“ All  praise  be  to  Allah! ”  to  the  mountain  before  you,  and  the  mountain 
will proclaim: “ All praise be to Allah! ”, exactly as you do. Since Almighty 
Allah has given this ability to mountains, it can surely be made to develop 
and that seed be made to sprout.

Thus,  since  He  gave  to  David  ( UWP )  the  vicegerency  of  the  earth  in 
exceptional form together with his messengership, He made the seed of that 
ability unfold to such an extent, as a miracle worthy of his extensive messen-
gership and magniﬁcent rule, that mighty mountains followed him like sol-
diers, students, or followers, and at his command and in his tongue declared 
the praises and gloriﬁcations of the All-Glorious Creator. Whatever David 
( UWP )  pronounced,  they  repeated.  Now  at  the  present  time,  because  the 
means of communication have multiplied and developed, a powerful com-
mander may compel his large army dispersed in the mountains to declare: 
“ Allah  is  Most  Great! ”,  and  could  make  the  mountains  speak,  bringing 
them to tumult. Since a commander of men can make the mountains speak 
metaphorically  in  the  tongue  of  those  present  in  the  mountains,  surely  a 
magniﬁcent  commander  of  Almighty  Allah  could  make  them  speak  actu-
ally and recite His praises. In addition, I have explained in previous Words 
that  all  mountains  have  a  collective  personality  or  corporate  identity,  and 
offer  gloriﬁcations  and  worship  in  a  way  suitable  to  each.  That  is  to  say, 

296

THE WORDS

just as through the mystery of echo all mountains recite gloriﬁcations in the 
tongue  of  men,  so  too  they  glorify  the  All-Glorious  Creator  in  their  own 
particular tongues.
Also, the verses,

( 38:19 )  7 6
( 27:16 ) ..H G F
show that Almighty Allah bestowed on David and Solomon ( Upon whom 
be peace ) knowledge of the tongues of the bird species, and of the tongues 
of  their innate capacities; that is, of the things for which they would be use-
ful. Yes, since it is the truth and since the face of the earth is a laden table set 
up by the Most Merciful in honour of humankind, most of the other animals 
and birds who beneﬁt from it may be subjugated to humans and serve them. 
They employ some of the smallest of them, the honey-bee and silk-worm, 
and through divine inspiration have opened up a beneﬁcial highway, and by 
employing pigeons in various tasks and teaching birds like parrots to speak, 
they have added ﬁne things to the virtues of human civilization. In the same 
way, if the tongues of the innate capacities of other birds and animals were 
known, those many other species could be employed in important tasks like 
their  brothers,  the  domesticated  animals.  For  example,  against  plagues  of 
locusts: starlings eat and destroy locusts; if their language was known and 
their movements could be regulated, what valuable services they could be 
employed in free of charge. 

Thus,  this  verse  traces  the  furthest  limit  in  subjugating  birds  and  ben-
eﬁting  from  them  in  this  way,  and  in  making  lifeless  beings  speak  like  a 
telephone or gramophone, and in proﬁting from birds. It speciﬁes the most 
distant goal. It points a ﬁnger at it in majestic fashion and in a way urges 
humankind towards it. Through the allusive tongue of these verses, Almighty 
Allah is therefore saying in meaning:

“ O men! In order to honour the prophethood of one of your fellow men’s 
justice who was totally submissive to me and the complete justice of his rule, 
I  subjugated  to  him  the  mighty  creatures  in  my  dominions,  causing  them 
to speak, and I made most of my troops and animals his servants. In which 
case, since I have committed to each of you the Supreme Trust, from which 
the sky, earth, and mountains shrank, and I have given you the ability to be 
My vicegerent on earth, you should yield to Me. For it is I Who holds the 
reins of these creatures in His hand. The creatures in My dominions may 

TWENTIETH WORD – SECOND STATION

297

then yield to you also and you may gain possession of their reins in the name 
of their Holder and rise to a position worthy of your abilities.

Since the truth is this, rather than listening to the gramophone, playing 
with pigeons and making them deliver letters, and teaching parrots to speak, 
you should strive to attain to the most agreeable and elevated amusement. 
Then the mountains may be huge gramophones for you like David’s, and 
the harmonious recitations of divine praises may reach your ears from the 
trees and plants at the touching of the breeze, and the mountains may reveal 
their  true  natures  as  wondrous  creatures  who  recite  the  divine  praises  in 
thousands of tongues, and most birds may be clothed in the form of intimate 
friends or obedient servants, like Solomon’s Hoopoe. Then they may enter-
tain you and drive you eagerly towards the perfections  and attainments of 
which you are capable, and not make you fall from the position required of 
the human being, like other amusements. ”

And, for example, in the verse,

( 21:69 ) ® ¬ « ª © ¨ § 
which is about one of Abraham’s ( Upon whom be peace ) miracles, are three 
subtle indications:

T h e   F i r s t :  Like other natural causes, ﬁre does not act on its own wishes 
and nature, blindly, but performs a duty under a command. Thus it did not 
burn Abraham ( Upon whom be peace ), because it was commanded not to.
T h e   S e c o n d :  There is a degree of heat which burns through its cold-
ness. That is, it has an effect like burning. With the words, اً(cid:174) َ(cid:203)َ(cid:126) 1 Almighty 
Allah is saying to the coldness: “ Do not burn him with your coldness, as 
with your heat! ” That is to say, ﬁre at that degree has an effect through its 
coldness like burning. It is both ﬁre and cold. In fact, in natural science 
there is a degree of ﬁre, the state of white heat, the heat of which does not 
spread to its surroundings. It attracts the heat around it to itself and with 
this cold, freezes surrounding liquids such as water, in effect burning them 
with its cold. Thus, intense cold is a category of ﬁre which burns through 
its cold. In which case, this intense cold is surely a part of Hell, for Hell 
contains all the degrees and sorts of ﬁre.

T h e   T h i r d :   Just  as  there  is  an  immaterial  substance  like  belief  which 
counters the effects of Hell-ﬁre and affords protection against it – the armour 

1.  One Qur’anic commentary states: If He had not said: اً(cid:174) َ(cid:203)َ(cid:126) , it would have burnt 

him with its coldness.

THE WORDS

of Islam, so there is a physical substance which protects against the effects 
of worldly ﬁre. For as is required by the name of All-Wise, this world is the 
abode of wisdom, and Almighty Allah carries out His works under the veil 
of  causes.  Therefore,  the  ﬁre  burnt  neither  Abraham’s  body,  nor  his  gar-
ments; He imbued them with a state which resisted ﬁre. With this allusion, 
the verse is in effect saying: “ O nation of Abraham! Resemble Abraham, 
so that your material and immaterial garments may be your armour against 
ﬁre,  your  greatest  enemy  both  here  and  there.  Clothe  your  spirit  in  belief 
in  Allah  so  it  may  be  your  armour  against  Hell-ﬁre.  Moreover,  there  are 
certain  substances  which  Almighty  Allah  has  hidden  in  the  earth  for  you 
which will protect you from the evils of ﬁre. Search for them, extract them, 
and clothe yourselves in them! ” Thus, one of man’s important discoveries 
and a step in his progress was his ﬁnding a substance that ﬁre does not burn; 
and he clothed himself in garments resistant to ﬁre. So  see how elevated, 
subtle, and ﬁne a garment this verse weaves on the loom of “ H a n ī f a n   M u s l i -
m a n  ”( See, 3:67, etc. ) , which will not be rent in all eternity.

And, for example, the verse,

( 2:31 ) C B A @
which says: “ Adam’s ( UWP ) greatest miracle in the question of the supreme 
vicegerency was the teaching of the names. ” Just as the miracles of the other 
prophets each allude to a particular human wonder; so the miracle of Adam, 
who was the father of all the prophets and the inauguration of the ofﬁce of 
prophethood, points almost explicitly to the ﬁnal points of all human attain-
ment and progress, and humanity’s ﬁnal goals. Through the tongue of allu-
sion, Almighty Allah ( May His glory be exalted ) is saying with this verse: 
“ O children of Adam! Since as a proof of his superiority over the angels 
in the question of the vicegerency, I taught your forefather all the names, 
you too, since you are his progeny and the inheritors of his abilities, should 
learn all the names and in your position as holder of the Supreme Trust dem-
onstrate your worthiness before all creatures. For the way is open to you to 
rise to such exalted rank as holding the highest positions over all beings in 
the universe whereat vast creatures like the earth will be subjected to you. 
Come on, step forward, adhere to all My names, and rise! Your forefather 
was once deceived by Satan and temporarily fell to the earth from the posi-
tion of Paradise. Beware! In your progress, do not follow Satan and from 
the heavens of divine wisdom fall into the misguidance of nature. Continu-
ously raising your head and studying carefully My most beautiful names, 

TWENTIETH WORD – SECOND STATION

make  your  sciences  and  your  progress  steps  by  which  to  ascend  to  those 
heavens. Then you may rise to My dominical names, which are the realities 
and  sources  of  your  sciences  and  attainments,  and  you  may  look  to  your 
Lord and Sustainer with your hearts through the telescope of the names. ”

A Signiﬁcant Point and Important Mystery

A   S i g n i ﬁ c a n t   P o i n t   a n d   I m p o r t a n t   M y s t e r y

By describing under the title of the teaching of the names all the attain-
ments of learning and scientiﬁc progress and wonders of technology which 
humans manifest through their comprehensive dispositions, this wondrous 
verse contains the following subtle and elevated allusion: all attainments and 
perfections, all learning, all progress, and all sciences, have an elevated real-
ity which is based on one of the divine names. On being based on the name, 
which is concealed under numerous veils and has various manifestations and 
different spheres, the sciences and arts and attainments ﬁnd their perfection 
and become reality. They are not some incomplete and deﬁcient shadow.

For example, engineering is a science; its reality and ﬁnal point reaches 
to Almighty Allah’s names of All-Just and Determiner, and observes with 
all their majesty the wise manifestation of those names in the mirror of engi-
neering. 

And, for example, medicine is a science, and also an art; its ﬁnal point 
and  reality  are  based  on  the  Absolutely  Wise  One’s  name  of  Healer,  and 
through  observing  that  name’s  compassionate  manifestations  in  the  vast 
pharmacy of the earth, medicine ﬁnds its perfection and becomes reality.

And,  for  example,  the  natural  sciences,  which  discuss  the  reality  of 
beings;  by  seeing  the  regulating,  nurturing  supreme  manifestations  of 
Almighty Allah’s ( May His glory be exalted ) name of All-Wise in things, in 
their beneﬁts and advantages, and by attaining to the name, and being based 
on  it,  these  sciences  may  contain  true  wisdom.  Otherwise  they  are  either 
transformed into superstition, or become nonsense, or open up the way to 
such misguidance as naturalist philosophy.

There, three examples for you! You may make analogies with these for 

the other sciences and attainments. 

Thus, with this verse, the All-Wise Qur’an strikes the hand of encourage-
ment on man’s back, urging him to the highest peaks, the furthest limits, the 
ﬁnal degrees, which he is far behind at the present degree of his progress. 
It points its ﬁngers at those degrees, commanding: “ Forward march! ” Con-
tenting ourselves for now with these jewels from the sublime treasury of this 
verse, we close this door.

THE WORDS

Also, for example, the All-Wise Qur’an, the supreme miracle of Muham-
mad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), the seal of the ofﬁce of prophet-
hood, in the face of whose claim to divine messengership the miracles of all 
the former prophets were like a single conﬁrmatory miracle; the leader of the 
prophets and cause of pride of the universe; who manifested in detail with all 
their degrees all the names which were taught summarily to Adam ( UWP ); 
who, on raising his ﬁnger, through the manifestation of divine glory split the 
moon, and lowering it, through the manifestation of divine beauty poured 
water from it like the Spring of Kawthar; and who was veriﬁed and corrobo-
rated by a thousand miracles. Through numerous of the All-Wise Qur’an’s 
clear verses like,

( 17:88 ) > = < ; : 9 8 7
which describe the purity of its exposition, the eloquence of its expression, 
the comprehensiveness of its meanings, and the elevatedness and sweetness 
of its styles concerning truth and reality, which are the most brilliant of its 
aspects of miraculousness – through verses like these, the All-Wise Qur’an 
directs the gazes of men and jinn to the clearest and most brilliant aspects of 
this post-eternal miracle. It provokes all men and jinn. Arousing the eager-
ness of its friends and obstinacy of its enemies, it urges them with intense 
encouragement to imitate and copy it, to resemble it with their words. It also 
places its miracle before the eyes of creatures in such a way that it is as if the 
only aim in humanity’s coming into this world is to take that miracle as its 
goal and guiding principle, and studying it to understand the purpose of its 
creation, and to proceed towards it.

I n   B r i e f :  The miracles of the other prophets ( Upon whom be peace ) all 
indicate the wonders of a human art or craft, and Adam’s ( Upon whom be 
peace ) miracle indicates in concise form, besides the bases of those crafts, 
the index of the sciences and branches of knowledge, and of the wonders 
and perfections, and urges humankind towards them. As for the Qur’an of 
Miraculous Exposition, the supreme miracle of Muhammad ( UWBP ), since 
it shows in detail the reality of the teaching of the names, it points clearly 
to the true goal of the sciences and branches of knowledge, which are truth 
and  reality,  as  well  as  the  perfections,  attainments,  and  happiness  of  this 
world and the next. With truly powerful encouragement, it urges humankind 
towards them. It encourages and urges in a such way it says: 

“ O humankind! In the face of manifestations of dominicality, the elevated 
purpose of the universe is humanity’s universal worship and submission to 

TWENTIETH WORD – SECOND STATION

301

Allah, while humankind’s furthest aim is to attain to that worship by means 
of those sciences and perfections. ” In stating this, it hints: 

“ At the end of time, humankind will spill into science and learning. It 
will obtain all its strength from science. Power and rule will pass to the hand 
of science. ” 

Also, since the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition repeatedly puts forward 
its eloquence and beauty of expression, by allusion it says: “ At the end of 
time, eloquence and beauty of expression, the most brilliant of the sciences 
and branches of knowledge, will be most sought after in all their varieties. 
Even, in order to make one another accept their ideas and implement their 
word, people will ﬁnd their most effective weapon in eloquent expression, 
and their most irresistible force in ﬁne oratory. ”

I n   S h o r t :  Most of the Qur’an’s verses are keys to a treasury of perfec-

tions and guides to a store of knowledge.

If you wish, you may reach up to the skies of the Qur’an and the stars of 
its verses by making the previous twenty Words a stairway of twenty steps. 
1 By means of them you will see what a brilliant sun is the Qur’an! See how 
it sprinkles a pure light over the divine truths and the truths of the contingent 
realm! See what a brilliant effulgence it spreads!

C o n c l u s i o n :  Since together with alluding to the wonders of present-day 
human progress, all the verses about the prophets are also in a style which 
as though infers and traces their limits in the future; and since it is certain 
that  all  the  verses  point  to  numerous  meanings,  indeed,  it  is  unanimously 
agreed upon, and since there are categorical commands to follow and obey 
the prophets, then together with the explicit meanings of the above verses, 
it may be said that they indicate in allusive fashion the main human arts and 
sciences, and that they urge humankind towards them.

spheres the rights of human wonders diminish to being only a weak sign and 
slight indication. For if they were to demand their rights from the sphere of 
dominicality, they would receive very few. 

For example, if man’s aeroplane 1 were to say to the Qur’an: “ Give me 
the right to speak and a place in your verses, ” the planets, earth, and moon, 
which are the aircraft of the sphere of dominicality, would reply in the  name 
of the Qur’an: “ You take a place relative to your size! ” And if man’s sub-
marines were to ask for a place from the Qur’an’s verses, the submarines 
of that sphere, that is, the earth and stars which swim in the vast ocean of 
the atmosphere and the ether would say: “ Your place beside us is so small 
as  to  be  negligible. ”  And  if  the  brilliant,  star-like  electric  lights  were  to 
demand the right to speak and ask to be included in its verses, the electric 
lights of that sphere, the shooting stars, lightning, and stars and lamps which 
adorn the face of the skies, would say: “ You may enter its discussions and 
explanations in relation to your light. ” If the wonders of civilization were to 
demand their rights with a view to ﬁneness of art and seek a place from its 
verses, then a single ﬂy would bid them to be silent, saying: “ Your rights are 
not equal to even one of my wings! For if all the ﬁne arts and delicate instru-
ments achieved through man’s faculty of will were to be gathered together, 
they could never be as wondrous as the ﬁne art of my delicate members and 
tiny body. ” The verse,

( 22:73 ) 3 2 1 0 / . - , + * ) (

bids you to fall silent! ”

If  the  marvels  of  civilization  were  to  go  to  the  sphere  of  worship  and 
demand their rights, they would receive a reply like this: “ Your relations 
with us are very few and you may not easily enter our sphere. For our pro-
gramme is this: the world is a guesthouse, and as for human beings, they 
remain there only a short time. They are guests with many duties and in a 
brief lifetime are charged with preparing all the necessities for eternal life. 
The most important and essential matters will be offered to you. But most 
of  you  see  this  ﬂeeting  world  through  a  veil  of  heedlessness,  as  an  eter-
nal abode, coloured and shaped by worldly feelings. So your share of wor-
ship, the basis of which is love of the truth and thinking of the hereafter,

is very small. However, if there are among you respected craftsmen and art-
ists and inspired inventors, who, purely for the beneﬁt of Allah’s servants, 
serve the general interest and public well-being and betterment of social life, 
which is all valuable worship, these signs and indications of the Qur’an are 
surely sufﬁcient for those discerning people, who of course form a minority, 
in order to encourage their efforts and appreciate their art. ”

The Second

THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION

I f   y o u   a s k :  “ None of my doubts remains now after these investigations, 
and I afﬁrm that together with other wonders, in the Qur’an are allusions 
to and indications of the wonders of modern civilization, indeed, to further 
advancements. Everything necessary for human happiness in this world  and 
the next is found within it in relation to its worth. But why does the Qur’an 
not  mention  them  explicitly  so  that  obstinate  unbelievers  would  be  com-
pelled to conﬁrm it and our hearts also would be easy? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  Religion is an examination, a test, proposed by Allah so 
that  in  the  arena  of  competition  elevated  spirits  and  base  spirits  may  be 
distinguished from one another. Just as materials are plunged in the ﬁre so 
that diamonds and coal, gold and earth, separate out from one another, so 
too religion is a trial concerning the obligations placed on human beings by 
Allah and a driving to competition, which is what this abode of examina-
tion consists of. In this way the elevated jewels in the mine of human abili-
ties become separated out from the dross. Since the Qur’an was revealed 
in this abode of examination for humans to be perfected through trial in 
the arena of competition, it will surely only allude to the hidden events of 
the future pertaining to this world which everyone will see, and will only 
open the door to the intelligence to a degree that proves its argument. If 
it mentioned them explicitly, the mystery of human accountability would 

َ(cid:202) clearly 
be negated. Simply, it would be as self-evident as writing ُ
in  stars  on  the  face  of  the  skies.  Then  everyone  would  have  to  afﬁrm  it 
whether  they  wanted  to  or  not.  There  would  be  no  competition  and  the 
examination would go for nothing. A coal-like spirit would remain on the 
same level as a diamond-like spirit. 1

ّ(cid:202)ِا َهٰ(cid:170)ِا  ٓ

I n  S h o r t :  The All-Wise Qur’an is wise; it affords everything a position in 
relation to its value. Thus, one thousand three hundred years ago, the Qur’an 

1.  Abu Jahl the Accursed and Abu Bakr the Truthful would appear to be equal, and the 

mystery of the examination set by Allah, lost.

The Twenty-First Word 

[ This Word consists of two stations. ]

First Station 

(cid:2)(cid:3)

( 4:103 ) y x w v u t s
One time, a man great in age, physique, and rank said to me: “ The prayers 
are ﬁne, but to perform them every single day ﬁve times is excessive. Since 
they never end, it becomes wearying. ”

A long time after the man said these words, I listened to my soul and I 
heard it say exactly the same things. I looked at it and saw that with the ear 
of laziness, it was receiving the same lesson from Satan. Then I understood 
that those words were as though said in the name of all evil-commanding 
souls, or else they had been prompted. So I said: “ My soul commands to evil 
and the person who does not reform his own soul cannot reform others. In 
which case, I shall begin with my own soul. ”

I said: O soul! Listen to ﬁve warnings in response to those words which 
you uttered in compounded ignorance, on the couch of idleness, in the slum-
ber of heedlessness.

First Warning

FIRST WARNING

O  my  wretched  soul!  Is  your  life  eternal,  I  wonder?  Have  you  any 
incontrovertible document to show that you will live to next year, or even 
to  tomorrow?  What  causes  you  boredom  is  that  you  fancy  you  shall  live 
for  ever.  You  complain  as  though  you  will  remain  in  this  world  to  enjoy 
yourself  for  ever.  If  you  had  understood  that  your  life  is  brief  and  that  it 

305

306

THE WORDS

is departing fruitlessly, to spend one hour out of the twenty-four on a ﬁne, 
agreeable, easy, and merciful act of service which is a means of gaining the 
true happiness of eternal life, surely would not cause you boredom but excite 
a real eagerness and agreeable pleasure.

Second Warning

SECOND WARNING

O my stomach-worshipping soul! Every day you eat bread, drink water, 
and  breathe  air;  do  they  cause  you  boredom?  They  do  not,  because  since 
the need is repeated, they cause not boredom but pleasure. In which case, 
the ﬁve daily prayers should not bore you, for they attract the needs of your 
companions in the house of my body, the sustenance of my heart, the water 
of life of my spirit, and the air of my subtle faculties. Yes, it is by knocking 
through supplication on the door of One All-Compassionate and Muniﬁcent 
that sustenance and strength may be obtained for a heart afﬂicted with inﬁ-
nite griefs and sorrows and captivated by inﬁnite pleasures and hopes. And it 
is by turning towards the spring of mercy of an Everlasting All-Worshipped, 
an Eternal Beloved through the ﬁve daily prayers that the water of life may 
be  imbibed  by  a  spirit  connected  with  most  beings,  which  swiftly  depart 
from this transitory world crying out at separation. And being most needy 
for air in the sorrowful, crushing, distressing, transient, dark, and suffocat-
ing conditions of this world, it is only through the window of the prayers 
that a conscious inner sense and luminous subtle faculty can breathe, which 
by its nature desires eternal life and was created for eternity and is a mirror 
of the Pre-Eternal and Post-Eternal One and is inﬁnitely delicate and subtle.

Third Warning

THIRD WARNING

O my impatient soul! Is it at all sensible to think today of past hardships 
of worship, difﬁculties of the prayers, and troubles of misfortune, and be dis-
tressed, and to imagine the future duties of worship, service of the prayers, 
and  sorrows  of  disaster,  then  display  impatience?  In  being  thus  impatient 
you resemble a foolish commander who, although the enemy’s right ﬂank 
joined  his  right  ﬂank  and  became  fresh  forces  for  him,  sent  a  signiﬁcant 
force to the right ﬂank and weakened the centre. Then, while there were no 
enemy soldiers on the left ﬂank, he sent a large force there and gave them 
the order to ﬁre. No forces then remained in the centre, and the enemy under-
stood this and attacked it and routed him. 

Yes, you resemble this, for the troubles of yesterday have today been 
transformed  into  mercy;  the  pain  has  disappeared  while  the  pleasure 
remains.  The  difﬁculty  has  been  turned  into  blessings,  and  the  hardship 

TWENTY-FIRST WORD – FIRST STATION

307

into reward. In which case, you should not feel wearied at it, but make a 
serious effort to continue with a new eagerness and fresh enthusiasm. As 
for future days, they have not yet arrived, and to think of them now and 
feel bored and wearied is a lunacy like thinking today of future hunger and 
thirst, and starting to shout and cry out. Since the truth is this, if you are  
reasonable, you will think of only today in connection with worship, and 
say: “ I am spending one hour of it on an agreeable, pleasant, and elevated 
act of service, the reward for which is high and whose trouble is little. ” 
Then your bitter dispiritedness will be transformed into sweet endeavour.
My impatient soul! You are charged with being patient in three respects. 
One is patience in worship. Another is patience in refraining from sin. And 
a third is patience in the face of disaster. If you are intelligent, take as your 
guide  the  truth  apparent  in  the  comparison  in  this  Third  Warning.  Say  in 
manly  fashion:  “ O  Most  Patient  One! ”  and  shoulder  the  three  sorts  of 
patience. If you do not squander on the wrong way the forces of patience 
Almighty Allah has given you, they should be enough to withstand every 
difﬁculty and disaster. So hold out with those forces!

Fourth Warning

FOURTH WARNING

O my foolish soul! Is this duty of worship without result and is its recom-
pense little that it causes you weariness? Whereas if someone were to give 
you a little money or to intimidate you, he could make you work till evening, 
and you would work without slacking. So is it that the prescribed prayers 
are without result, which in this guesthouse of the world are sustenance and 
wealth for your impotent and weak heart, and in your grave, which will be 
a certain dwelling-place for you, sustenance and light, and at the resurrec-
tion, when you will anyway be judged, a document and patent, and on the 
Bridge of Sirat, over which you are bound to pass, a light and a mount? Are 
their recompense little? Someone promises you a present worth a hundred 
liras and makes you work for a hundred days. You trust the man who may 
go back on his word and work without slacking. So if One for Whom the 
breaking of a promise is impossible, promises you recompense like Paradise 
and a gift like eternal happiness, and employs you for a very short time in 
a very agreeable duty, if you do not perform that service or you act accus-
ingly towards His promise or slight His gift by performing it unwillingly like 
someone forced to work, or by being bored, or by working in half-hearted 
fashion,  you  will  deserve  a  severe  reprimand  and  awesome  punishment. 
Have you not thought of this? Although you serve without ﬂagging in the 
heaviest work in this world out of fear of imprisonment, does the fear of an 

308

THE WORDS

eternal incarceration like Hell not ﬁll you with enthusiasm for a truly light 
and agreeable act of service?

Fifth Warning

FIFTH WARNING

O  my  world-worshipping  soul!  Does  your  slackness  in  worship  and 
remissness  in  the  prescribed  prayers  arise  from  the  multiplicity  of  your  
worldly  occupations,  or  because  you  cannot  ﬁnd  time  due  to  the  struggle 
for livelihood? Were you created only for this world that you spend all your 
time on it? You know that in regard to your abilities you are superior to all 
the animals, but in regard to procuring the necessities of worldly life you 
cannot compete with even a sparrow. So why can you not understand that 
your basic duty is not to labour like an animal, but to strive for a true, per-
petual life, like a true human being. In addition, the things you call worldly 
occupations  mostly  do  not  concern  you  and  are  trivial  matters  which  you 
meddle in ofﬁciously. You neglect the essential things and pass your time 
acquiring  inessential  information  as  though  you  were  going  to  live  for  a 
thousand years. For example, you squander your precious time on worth-
less things like learning what the rings around Saturn are like or how many 
chickens there are in America. As though you were becoming an expert in 
astronomy or statistics.

I f   y o u   s a y :  “ What keeps me from the prayers and worship and causes me 
to be lax is not unnecessary things like that, but essential matters like earn-
ing a livelihood, ” then my answer is this: you work for a daily wage of one 
hundred kurush, and someone comes to you and says: “ Come and dig here 
for ten minutes, and you will ﬁnd a brilliant and an emerald worth a hundred 
liras. ” If you reply: “ No, I won’t come, because ten kurush will be cut from 
my wage and my subsistence will be less, ” of course you understand what 
a foolish pretext it would be. In just the same way, you work in this orchard 
for your livelihood. If you abandon the obligatory prayers, all the fruits of 
your effort will be restricted to only a worldly, unimportant, and unproduc-
tive  livelihood.  But  if  you  spend  your  rest  periods  on  the  prayers,  which 
allow your spirit to relax and heart to take a breather, you will discover two 
mines which are an important source, for both a productive worldly liveli-
hood, and your livelihood and provisions of the hereafter.

First Mine: If you have a sound intention, you will receive a share of the 
praises and gloriﬁcations offered by all the plants and trees, whether ﬂower-
ing or fruit-bearing, that you grow in the garden. 1

1.  This First Station was a lesson for someone in a garden, so it was explained in this 

way.

TWENTY-FIRST WORD – FIRST STATION

309

Second  Mine:  Whatever  is  eaten  of  the  garden’s  produce,  whether  by 
animals or man, cattle or ﬂies, buyers or thieves, will become like almsgiv-
ing from you. But on condition you work in the name of the True Provider 
and within the bounds of what He permits, and see yourself as a distribution 
ofﬁcial giving His property to His creatures.

So see what a great loss is made by the person who abandons the pre-
scribed  prayers.  What  signiﬁcant  wealth  he  loses  and  he  is  deprived  of 
those  two  results  and  mines  which  would  otherwise  cause  him  to  work 
eagerly  and  ensure  his  morale  is  strong;  he  becomes  bankrupt.  Even,  as 
he grows old, he will grow weary of gardening and lose interest in it, say-
ing, “ What is it to me? I am anyway leaving this world, why should I put 
up with so much difﬁculty? ” He will sink into idleness. But the ﬁrst man 
says: “ I shall work harder at both worship and licit activities in order to 
send even more abundant light to my grave and procure more provisions 
for my life in the hereafter. ”

I n   S h o r t :  O my soul! Know that yesterday has left you and as for tomor-
row, you have nothing to prove that it will be yours. In which case, know 
that your true life is the present day. So throw at least one of its hours into 
a mosque or prayer-mat, a coffer for the hereafter like a reserve fund, set up 
for the true future. Know too that for you and for everyone each new day 
is the door to a new world. If you do not perform the prayers, your world 
that day will depart dark and wretched, and will testify against you in the 
World of Similitudes. For everyone, every day, has a private world out of 
this  world,  and  its  nature  is  dependent  on  the  person’s  heart  and  actions, 
like a splendid palace reﬂected in a mirror takes on the colour of the mir-
ror; if it is black, it appears black; if it is red, it appears red. Also it takes 
on the qualities of the mirror; if the mirror is smooth, it shows the palace to 
be beautiful, and if it is not, it shows it to be ugly. Just as it makes the most 
delicate things appear coarse, so you alter the shape of your own world with 
your  heart,  mind,  actions,  and  wishes.  You  may  make  it  testify  either  for 
you or against you. If you perform the ﬁve daily prayers and through them 
you are turned towards that world’s Glorious Maker, all of a sudden your 
world, which looks to you, is lit up. Quite simply as though the prayers are 
an electric lamp and your intention to perform them touches the switch, they 
disperse the world’s darkness and show the changes and movements within 
the  confused  wretchedness  of  worldly  chaos  to  be  a  wise  and  purposeful 
order and the meaningful writing of divine power. They scatter one light of 
the light-ﬁlled verse,

over your heart and your world on that day is illuminated through the light’s 
reﬂection. It will cause it to testify in your favour through its luminosity.

B e w a r e ,   d o   n o t   s a y :  “ What are my prayers in comparison with the real-
ity of the prayers? ”, for the seed of a date palm represents its tree as a date 
palm. The difference is only in the summary and details; like the prayers of  
a great saint, the prayers of ordinary people like you or me, even if they are 
not aware of it, have a share of that light. This truth holds a mystery, even if 
the conscious mind does not perceive it. But the unfolding and illumination 
differ according to the degrees of those performing them. However many 
stages and degrees there are from the seed of a date palm to the mature tree, 
the  degrees  of  the  prayers  and  their  stages  are  even  more  numerous.  The 
essence of that luminous truth, however, is present in all the degrees.

O you who is afﬂicted with the sickness of scruples! Do you know what 
your scruples resemble? A calamity! The more importance they are given, 
the more they grow. While if you give them no importance, they die away. 
If you see them as big, they grow bigger. If you see them as small, they grow 
smaller. If you fear them, they swell and make you ill. If you do not fear 
them, they are light and remain hidden. If you do not know their true nature, 
they persist and become established. While if you do know them and recog-
nize them, they disappear. I shall therefore explain only ﬁve aspects which, 
of the many sorts of these calamitous scruples, are those which occur most 
frequently. Perhaps it may be curative for you and for me, for these scruples 
are such that ignorance invites them and knowledge repulses them. If you do 
not recognize them they come, if you do recognize them they go.

First Aspect

FIRST ASPECT – FIRST WOUND

Satan  ﬁrst  casts  a  doubt  into  the  heart.  If  the  heart  does  not  accept  it, 
it  turns  from  a  doubt  into  abuse.  It  depicts  before  the  imagination  some 
unclean memories and unmannerly, ugly states which resemble abuse, and 
causes  the  heart  to  declare:  “ Alas! ”  and  to  fall  into  despair.  The  person 
suffering  from  scruples  supposes  that  he  has  acted  wrongfully  before  his 
Sustainer and feels a terrible agitation and anxiety. In order to be saved from 
it, he ﬂees from the divine presence and wants to plunge into heedlessness. 
The cure for this wound is this:

O wretched man suffering from scruples! Do not be alarmed! For what 
comes to your mind is not abuse, but something imaginary. And just as to

THE WORDS

imagine unbelief is not unbelief, so to imagine abuse is not abuse either.  For 
according to logic, an imagining is not a judgement, and abuse is a judge-
ment. Moreover, those ugly words do not come from your heart, because 
your heart is saddened and sorry at them. Rather they come from the inner 
faculty situated near the heart which is a means of Satanic whisperings. The 
harm of scruples is imagining the harm. That is, it is to suffer harm in the 
heart through imagining them to be harmful. For it is fancying to be reality 
an  imagining  which  is  devoid  of  judgement.  Also,  it  is  to  attribute  to  the 
heart Satan’s works; to suppose his words to be from it. Such a person thinks 
it is harmful, so it becomes harmful. That is anyway what Satan wanted.

Second Aspect

SECOND ASPECT

It is this: when meanings arise in the heart, they enter the imagination 
stripped of form; it is there that they are clothed in an image or form. The 
imagination, always affected by some cause, weaves images of a sort. It 
leaves on the way the images of the things to which it gives importance. 
Whatever  meaning  passes  through  it,  it  either  clothes  it,  or  wears  it,  or 
taints it, or veils it. If the meanings are pure and clean, and the images, 
dirty and base, there is no clothing, but there is contact. The man with scru-
ples  confuses  the  contact  with  being  clothed.  He  exclaims:  “ Alas!  How 
corrupted my heart has become. This lowness has made me despicable and 
rejected! ” Satan takes advantage of this vein of his. The cure for such a 
wound is as follows:

Listen,  O  you  unfortunate!  Just  as  outward  cleanliness,  which  is  the 
means to the correct conduct of your prayers, is not affected by the unclean-
ness of the inside of your inner organs and is not spoiled by it, so the sacred 
meanings being close to unclean forms does not harm them. For example, 
you are reﬂecting on some divine signs or verses when suddenly you feel ill, 
or an appetite, or a stimulation like the need to pass water. Of course your 
imagination will see whatever is necessary to cure the ill or answer the need, 
and will look at it, weave lowly forms appropriate to them, and the mean-
ings that arise will pass between them. But there is no harm in their passing, 
nor soiling, nor error, nor injury. If there is any mistake, it is in paying them 
attention and imagining the harm.

Third Aspect

THIRD ASPECT

It is this: there are certain hidden connections between things. There are 
even the threads of connections between things you least expect. They are 
either there in fact, or your imagination made them according to the art with 

TWENTY-FIRST WORD – SECOND STATION

313

which it was preoccupied and tied them together. It is due to  this mystery 
of  connections  that  sometimes  seeing  a  sacred  thing  calls  to  mind  a  dirty 
thing. As stated in the science of ﬁgurative speech, “ Although opposition 
is the cause of distance in the outer world, it is the cause of proximity in the 
imagination. ”  That  is,  an  imaginary  connection  is  the  means  of  bringing 
together  the  images  of  two  opposites.  The  recollection  which  arises  from 
this connection is called the association of ideas. 

For  example,  while  performing  the  prayers  or  reciting  supplications 
before the Ka‘ba in the divine presence, this association of ideas takes hold 
of you and drives you to the furthest, lowest trivia, although you are reﬂect-
ing on Qur’anic verses. If your head is afﬂicted with an association of ideas 
in this way, beware, do not be alarmed. Rather, the moment you come to 
your  senses,  turn  back.  Do  not  say:  “ I’ve  done  a  great  wrong ”  and  keep 
playing with the trigger, lest through your attention, that tenuous connection 
strengthens. For the more you feel regret, the more importance you give it 
and that faint memory of yours becomes ingrained. It becomes an imaginary 
sickness. Do not be frightened, it is not a sickness of the heart. This sort of 
recollection is mostly involuntary. Especially in sensitive, nervous people it 
is more common. Satan works the mine of this sort of scruple a great deal. 
The cure for this wound is as follows: 

The  association  of  ideas  is  mostly  involuntary.  One  is  not  answerable 
for it. In association there is proximity; there is no contact or intermingling. 
Therefore the nature of the ideas do not pass to one another and do not harm 
one another. Just as Satan and the angel of inspiration being in proximity to 
one another around the heart, and sinners and the pious being close to one 
another in the same house cause no harm, so too, if at the prompting of the 
association of ideas, dirty imaginings come and enter among clean thoughts, 
they  cause  no  harm.  Unless  it  is  intentional,  or  by  imagining  them  to  be 
harmful, one is over-occupied with them. And sometimes the heart becomes 
tired  and  the  mind  occupies  itself  with  anything  it  encounters  in  order  to 
entertain  itself.  Then  Satan  ﬁnds  an  opportunity  and  scatters  dirty  things 
before it, and goads it.

Fourth Aspect

FOURTH ASPECT

This is a scruple arising from searching for the best form of an action. 
Supposing it to be fear of Allah, the more rigorous it becomes, the more 
severe  the  condition  becomes  for  the  person.  It  even  reaches  the  point 
that while searching for even better forms of action, he deviates into what 
is  unlawful.  Sometimes  searching  for  an  act  which  is  Sunna  makes  him 

314

THE WORDS

give  up  what  is  obligatory.  He  says:  “ I  wonder  if  my  act  was  sound? ”, 
and  repeats it. This state continues and he falls into terrible despair. Satan 
takes advantage of this state of his and wounds him. There are two cures 
for such a wound.

The First Cure

T h e  F i r s t  C u r e :  Scruples like this are worthy of the Mu‘tazilites, because 
they say: “ Actions and things for which a person is responsible are either, 
of themselves and in regard to the hereafter, good, and because of this good 
they were commanded, or they are bad, and because they are bad they were 
prohibited. This means, from the point of view of reality and the hereafter, 
the  good  and  bad  in  things  are  dependent  on  the  things  themselves,  and 
the divine command and prohibition follow this. ” According to this school 
of  thought,  the  following  scruple  arises  in  every  action  which  a  person 
performs: “ I wonder if my action was performed in the good way that in 
essence  it  is? ”  While  the  true  school,  the  Sunni  School,  says:  “ Almighty 
Allah  orders  a  thing,  then  it  becomes  good.  He  prohibits  a  thing,  then  it 
becomes bad. ” That is, goodness becomes existent through command, and 
badness through prohibition. They look to the awareness of the one who per-
forms the action and are established accordingly. And this good and bad is 
not in the apparent face which looks to this world, but in the face that looks 
to the hereafter. 

For example, you performed the prayers or took the ablutions and there 
was a cause that of itself would spoil them, but you were completely una-
ware of it. Your prayers and ablutions, therefore, are both sound and accept-
able. However, the Mu‘tazilites say: “ In reality it was bad and unsound. But 
it may be accepted from you because you were ignorant and did not know, 
so you have an excuse. ” Therefore, according to the Sunni School, do not 
say about an action which is conformable with the externals of the Shari‘a: 
“ I wonder if it was sound? ”; do not have scruples about it. Say: “ Was it 
accepted? ”; do not become proud and conceited!

The Second Cure

T h e   S e c o n d   C u r e :  This is: “ There is no difﬁculty in religion. ” 
ِد(cid:170)ا يِ(cid:158)   َجَرَ(cid:110)  َ(cid:202) Since the four schools of law are true; and since realizing a 
ِن(cid:192)ّ
fault which leads to the seeking of forgiveness is preferable – for the person 
afﬂicted with scruples – to seeing actions as good, which leads to pride, that 
is, it is better if such a person sees his action as faulty and seeks forgiveness, 
rather than considering it to be good and falling into pride; since it is thus, 
throw away your scruples and say to Satan: “ This state is a difﬁculty. It is dif-

ﬁcult to be aware of the reality of things. It is contrary to the ease in religion 

TWENTY-FIRST WORD – SECOND STATION

315

ِد(cid:170)ا  يِ(cid:158)   َجَرَ(cid:110) َ(cid:202)  It  is  contrary  to  the  principle,  ٌر ْ(cid:127)ُ(cid:192)  ُن(cid:192)ّ

ِد(cid:170)َا  1 
expressed  by:  ِن(cid:192)ّ
Certainly such an action is conformable with  a true school of law. That is 
enough for me. And at least by admitting my inability to perform the wor-
ship in a way worthy of it, it leads me to seek refuge with divine compassion 
through humbly beseeching forgiveness and to meekly supplicating that my 
faulty actions be accepted.

Fifth Aspect

FIFTH ASPECT

In matters of belief, what occurs to one in the form of doubts are scruples. 
The unhappy man suffering from scruples sometimes confuses conceptions 
in his mind with imaginings. That is, he imagines a doubt that has occurred 
to  his  imagination  to  be  a  doubt  that  has  entered  his  mind,  and  supposes 
that his beliefs have been damaged. Sometimes he supposes a doubt he has 
imagined to have harmed his belief. Sometimes he supposes a doubt he has 
imagined  to  have  been  conﬁrmed  by  his  reason.  Sometimes  he  supposes 
pondering over a matter related to unbelief to be unbelief. That is, he sup-
poses to be contrary to belief his exercising his ability to reﬂect while trying 
to understand the causes of misguidance, and his ability to study and reason 
in impartial fashion. Then, taking fright at these suppositions, which result 
from the whisperings of Satan, he exclaims: “ Alas! My heart is corrupted 
and my beliefs spoiled. ” Since those states are mostly involuntary, and he 
cannot put them to rights through his faculty of will, he falls into despair. 
The cure for this wound is as follows:

Just as imagining unbelief is not unbelief, neither is erroneously surmis-
ing unbelief, unbelief. And just as imagining misguidance is not misguid-
ance, so too reﬂecting on misguidance is not misguidance. For both imagin-
ing, and surmising, and supposing, and reﬂecting, are different from conﬁr-
mation with the reason and submission of the heart, they are other than them; 
they are free to an extent; they do not listen to the faculty of will; they are not 
included among the obligations of religion. But afﬁrmation and submission 
are not like that; they are dependent on a measuring. And just as imagin-
ing, surmising, supposing, and reﬂecting are not afﬁrmation or submission, 
so  they  cannot  be  said  to  be  doubt  or  hesitation.  But  if  they  are  repeated 
unnecessarily and become established, then a sort of real doubt may be born 
of  them.  Also,  continually  taking  the  part  of  the  opposing  side  and  call-
ing it unbiased reasoning or being fair reaches the point where the person 

1.  B u k h ā r ī , Imān, 29; N a s ā ’ ī , Imān, 28; M u s n a d , v, 69.

316

THE WORDS

involuntarily  favours  the  opposing  side.  His  advocacy  of  the  truth,  which 
is incumbent on him, is spoiled. He too falls into danger. A state of mind 
becomes ﬁxed in his head whereby he becomes an ofﬁcious representative 
of Satan or the enemy.

The most serious of this sort of scruple is this: the person suffering from 
it confuses something that is actually possible with something which is rea-
sonably possible. That is, if he sees something which is of itself possible, 
he imagines it to be reasonably possible and reasonably doubtful. Whereas 
one of the principles of theology ( k a l ā m  ) is that something which is of itself 
possible  is  not  opposed  to  certain  knowledge  and  does  not  contradict  the 
demands of reason. For example, the Black Sea sinking into the earth at this 
moment is of itself possible, but we judge with certainty that the sea is in 
its place, and we know this without doubting it, and the possibility which 
is actually possible causes us no doubt and does not damage our certainty. 
And, for example, of itself it is possible that the sun will not set today or that 
it will not rise tomorrow. But this possibility in no way damages our cer-
tainty that it will rise and gives rise to no doubt. Similarly, unfounded suspi-
cions arising from possibilities of this sort about, for example, the setting of 
the life of this world and rising of the life of the hereafter, which are among 
the truths of belief, cause no harm to the certainty of belief. Furthermore, 
ْ(cid:203)ِ(cid:170) َةَرْ(cid:93)ِ(cid:150) َ(cid:202) ‘A possibility that 
the well-known rule,  ٍل(cid:193)ِ(cid:170)َد  ْنَ(cid:150) ِئ ِ(cid:130)اَ
does not arise from any proof or evidence is of no importance’ is one of the 
established principles of both the sciences of the principles of religion and 
the principles of jurisprudence ( ﬁ q h  ).

ّ(cid:179)(cid:170)ا ِرْ(cid:193)َ(cid:155)ْ(cid:170)ا  ِلا َ(cid:175)ـِ(cid:99)ْ(cid:110)ِ

I f  y o u  a s k :  “ What is the wisdom and purpose in scruples being visited on 

us, which are thus harmful and an afﬂiction for believers? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  On condition they do not lead to excess or overwhelm a 
person, essentially scruples are the cause of vigilance, lead to seeking the 
best way, and give rise to seriousness. They banish indifference and repulse 
carelessness. Therefore, in this realm of examination and arena of competi-
tion, the Absolutely Wise One put them in the hand of Satan as a whip of 
encouragement for us. He strikes it at our heads. If it hurts excessively, one 
must complain to the All-Wise and Compassionate One, and say:

( 59:21 ) k j i h g f 
One time two men were washing in a pool. Under some extraordinary 
inﬂuence they lost their senses and when they opened their eyes, they saw 
that they had been transported to a strange world. The world was such that 
with its perfect order it resembled a country, or rather a town, or a palace. 
They looked around themselves in complete bewilderment: if it was looked 
at in one way, a vast world was apparent; if in another, an orderly country; 
and if in another, a ﬁne town. And if it was looked at in still another way, it 
was a palace which comprised a truly magniﬁcent world. Travelling around 
this strange world, they observed it and saw that creatures of one sort were 
speaking in a fashion, but they did not understand their language. Neverthe-
less, it was understood from their signs that they were performing important 
works and duties.

One of the two men said to his friend: “ This strange world must have 
someone to regulate it, and this orderly country must have a lord, and this 
ﬁne town, an owner, and this ﬁnely made palace, a master builder. We must 
try to know him, for it is understood that it was he who brought us here. 
If we do not recognize him, who will help us? What can we expect from 
these impotent creatures whose language we do not know and who take no

notice of us? Moreover, surely the being who makes a vast world in the form 
of a country, town, and palace, and ﬁlls it from top to bottom with wonderful 
things, and embellishes it with every sort of adornment, and decks it out with 
instructive  miracles  wants  something  from  us  and    from  those  that  come 
here. We must get to know him and ﬁnd out what he wants. ”

The other man said: “ I do not believe it, that there is a person such as the 

one you speak of, and that he governs this whole world on his own. ”

His friend replied to him: “ If we do not recognize him and remain indif-
ferent towards him, there is no advantage in it at all, and if it is harmful, its 
harm will be immense. Whereas if we try to recognize him, there is little 
hardship involved, and if there is beneﬁt, it will be great. Therefore, it is in 
no way sensible to remain indifferent towards him. ”

The foolish man said: “ I consider all my ease and enjoyment to lie in 
not thinking of him. Also, I am not going to bother with things that make 
no sense to me. All these things are the confused objects of chance, they are 
happening by themselves. What is it to me? ”

His intelligent friend replied: “ This obstinacy of yours will push me, and 
a lot of others, into disaster. It sometimes happens that a whole country is 
laid waste because of one ill-mannered person. ”

So the foolish man turned to him and said: “ Either prove to me decisively 
that this large country has a single lord and single maker, or leave me alone. ”
His  friend  replied:  “ Your  obstinacy  has  reached  the  degree  of  lunacy; 
you will be the cause of some disaster being visited on us and even on the 
country. So I shall point out to you twelve proofs demonstrating that this 
world  which  is  like  a  palace  and  country  which  is  like  town  has  a  single 
maker  and  that  it  is  only  he  who  runs  and  administers  everything.  He  is 
totally free of all deﬁciency. This maker, who does not appear to us, sees us 
and everything, and hears our words. All his works are miracles and mar-
vels. All these creatures whom we see but whose tongues we do not under-
stand are his ofﬁcials. ”

Come  and  look  carefully  at  everything  around  you:  a  hidden  hand  is 
working  within  all  these  works.  For  something  which  has  not  even  an

sands  of  pounds.  And  something  that  does  not  have  even  a  particle  of

consciousness 1 is performing extremely wise and purposeful works. This 
means  that  they  are  not  working  by  themselves,  but  that  a  powerful  yet 
hidden person is causing them to work. If they were independent, it would 
necessitate all the works which we see everywhere in this land being mira-
cles and everything to be a wonder-working marvel. And that is nonsense.

Second Proof

SECOND PROOF

Come, look carefully at the things which adorn all these plains, ﬁelds, 
and dwellings! Each bears marks telling of that hidden one. Simply, each 
gives news of him like a seal or stamp. Look in front of your eyes: what does 
he make from one ounce of cotton? 2 See how many rolls of cloth, ﬁne linen, 
and ﬂowered material have come out of it. See how many sugared delights 
and  round  sweets  are  being  made.  If  thousands  of  people  like  us  were  to 
clothe themselves in them and eat them, they would still be sufﬁcient. And 
look! He has taken a handful of iron, water, earth, coal, copper, silver, and 
gold, and made some ﬂesh 3 out of them. Look at that and see it! O foolish 
one! All these are the works of such a being that this whole land together 
with  all  its  parts  is  under  his  miraculous  power  and  is  submissive  to  his 
every wish.

such  a  way  that  quite  simply  it  is  a  miniature  sample  of  the  huge  palace. 
Whatever there is in the palace, it is found in these tiny mobile machines. 
Is it at all possible that someone other than the palace’s maker could come 
and include the wondrous palace in a tiny machine? Also, is it at all possible 
that although he has included a whole world in a machine the size of a box, 
there could be anything in it that was purposeless or could be attributed to 
chance? This means that however many skilfully fashioned machines you

cot stone, and a tiny melon seed, produce from the treasury of mercy woven leaves ﬁner

and delicious than sweets and conserves, and they offer them to us.

3.  This indicates the creation of animal bodies from the elements, and living creatures

Fourth Proof

FOURTH PROOF

O my stubborn friend! Come, I shall show you something even stranger. 
Look! All these works and things in this land have changed and are chang-
ing. They do not remain in any one state. Note carefully that each of these 
lifeless bodies and unfeeling boxes has taken on the form of being absolutely 
dominant. Quite simply it is as though each rules all the others. Look at this 
machine next to us;  1 it is as though issuing commands; all the necessities 
and substances necessary for its adornment and functioning come hastening 
to it from distant places. Look over there: that lifeless body  2 is as though 
beckoning; it makes the largest bodies serve it and work in its own work-
place. You may make further analogies in the same way. 

Simply,  everything  subjugates  to  itself  all  the  beings  in  this  world.  If 
you do not accept the existence of that hidden one, you have to attribute all 
his skills, arts, and perfections in the stones, earth, animals, and creatures 
resembling man everywhere in this land to the things themselves. In place of 
a single wonder-working being, which your mind deems unlikely, you have 
to accept millions like him, who are both opposed to one another and similar 
and one within the other so they do not cause confusion everywhere and the 
order be spoiled. Whereas if two meddlers interfere in a country, they cause 
confusion. For if there are two headmen in a village, or two governors in a 
town, or two kings in a country, the result is chaos. So what would happen if 
there were innumerable absolute rulers?

Fifth Proof

even, set up their workbenches on dry rock, and work.

2.  This alludes to grains, seeds, and the eggs of ﬂies. For example, a ﬂy leaves its eggs 
on the leaves of the elm. Suddenly the huge tree turns its leaves into a mother’s womb and 
a cradle for the eggs, and into a store full of a honey-like food. Simply, in that way the tree, 
which is not fruit-producing, produces fruits bearing spirits.

are not worked by the pen of someone hidden who possesses inﬁnite skills 
and miraculous powers, and are attributed to unconscious causes, to blind 
chance and deaf nature, then every stone and every plant in this land has to 
be an inscriber so wondrous it can write a thousand books in every letter and 
include millions of works of art in a single inscription.  Look at the inscrip-
tions on these stones; 1 in each are the inscriptions of all the palace, and the 
laws ordering all the town, and the programmes for organizing the whole 
country. This means that to make these inscriptions is as wonderful as mak-
ing the whole country. In which case, all the inscriptions, all the works of 
art, are proclamations of that hidden one, and seals of his.

Since a letter cannot exist without showing the one who wrote it and an 
artistic inscription cannot exist without making known its inscriber, how is 
it that an inscriber who writes a huge book in a single letter and inscribes a 
thousand inscriptions in a single inscription, should not be known through 
his writing and through his inscribing?

Sixth Proof

SIXTH PROOF

Come,  let  us  go  out  onto  this  broad  plain.  2  On  it  is  a  high  mountain 
whose summit we shall climb to so that we can see all the surrounding coun-
try. We shall take with us a good pair of binoculars which will bring every-
thing close, for strange things are happening in this strange land. Every hour 
things are taking place that we could not imagine. Look! These mountains, 
plains, and towns are suddenly changing. And how? In such a way that mil-
lions of things are being changed in regulated and orderly fashion one within 
the other. Truly wondrous transformations are being wrought, just as though 
millions  of  various  cloths  are  being  woven  one  within  the  other.  Look! 
These ﬂowery things which we know and are familiar with are disappearing 
and others have come in their place in orderly fashion; they resemble them 
in nature but are different in form. It is quite simply as though this plain and 
the mountains are each a page, and within them and on them hundreds of

tree’s programme and index. For whatever the pen of power has written in the great book 
of the universe, it has written its summary in man’s nature. And whatever the pen of divine 
determining has written in a tree the size of a mountain, it has included in its fruit the size 
of a ﬁnger nail.

2.  This indicates the face of the earth in the spring and summer. For the groups of 
hundreds of thousands of different creatures are created one within the other and written 
there. They are changed without fault or error and with perfect order. Thousands of tables 
of the Most Merciful One are laid out, then removed and replaced by fresh ones. All the 
trees as though bear trays, all the gardens are like cauldrons.

322

THE WORDS

thousands of different books are being written. And they are being written 
faultlessly and without defect.

It is impossible a hundred times over that these matters could have come 
about on their own. Yes, for these works which are skilfully and carefully 
fashioned  to  an  inﬁnite  degree  to  have  occurred  on  their  own  is  impossi-
ble  a thousand times, for rather than themselves, they show the artist who 
fashioned  them.  Moreover,  the  being  who  did  this  displays  such  miracles 
that nothing at all could be difﬁcult for him. It is as easy for him to write 
a thousand letters as to write one book. Look all around you: he both puts 
everything  in  its  proper  place  with  perfect  wisdom,  and  he  muniﬁcently 
showers the favours on everyone of which they are worthy, and he draws 
back  general  veils  and  opens  doors  so  bountifully  that  everyone’s  desires 
are satisﬁed. He sets up tables so generously that a feast of bounties is given 
to all the people and animals of this land; each group and individual is given 
bounties particular to it and suitable for it, even. So, is there anything more 
impossible in the world than that there is anything attributable to chance in 
these matters that we see, or that among them there is anything purposeless 
or vain, or that many hands are interfering in them, or that their maker is not 
capable of everything, or that everything is not be subjugated to him? And 
so, my friend, ﬁnd a pretext in the face of these if you can!

Seventh Proof

SEVENTH PROOF

Come, my friend! Now we shall leave these particular matters and turn 
our  attention  to  the  mutual  positions  of  the  parts  of  this  wondrous  world 
which is in the form of a palace. Look! Universal works are being carried 
out and general revolutions are occurring in this world with such order that 
all the rocks, earth, trees, and everything in this palace observe the universal 
systems of the world and conform to them as if each were acting with will. 
Things which are distant hasten to assist one another. Now look, a strange 
caravan 1 has appeared, coming from the Unseen. The mounts in it resemble 
trees, plants, and mountains. Each bears a tray of provisions on its head. And 
look, they are bringing provisions for the various animals awaiting them on 
this side. And see, the mighty electric lamp  2 in that dome both furnishes 
them with light, and cooks all their food so well that the foods to be cooked 
are each attached to a string 3 by an unseen hand and held up before it. And 

1.   These  are  the  caravans  of  plants  and  trees,  which  bear  the  sustenance  of  all  the

on this side, see these wretched, weak, powerless little animals: how before 
their heads are attached two small pumps 1 full of delicate sustenance, like 
two springs; it is enough for those powerless creatures to only press their 
mouths against them.

I n   S h o r t :  Just as all the things throughout the world look to one another, 
so  they  assist  one  another.  And  just  as  they  see  one  another,  so  they  co-
operate with one another. And just as they perfect each other’s works, so 
they support one another; standing shoulder to shoulder, they work together. 
Make  analogies  with  this  for  everything;  they  are  uncountable.  Thus,  all 
these things demonstrate as decisively as two plus two equals four that eve-
rything is subjugated to the maker of this wondrous palace, that is, to the 
owner of this strange world. Everything works on his account. Everything 
is like a soldier under his command. Everything turns through his strength. 
Everything acts at his command. Everything is set in order through his wis-
dom. Everything helps the others through his muniﬁcence. Everything has-
tens to the assistance of the others through his compassion, that is, they are 
made to hasten to it. Now, my friend, say something in the face of this if 
you can!

Eighth Proof

EIGHTH PROOF

Come,  my  foolish  friend  who  like  my  soul  thinks  himself  reasonable! 
You do not want to recognize the owner of this magniﬁcent palace, but eve-
rything shows him, points to him, testiﬁes to him. How can you deny the 
testimony of all these things? You have therefore to deny the palace as well, 
and say: “ There is no world, no country. ” Deny yourself, too, and disap-
pear! Or else come to your senses and listen to me! Now, look, there are 
uniform elements and minerals inside the palace and encompassing the land. 
2  Simply,  everything  appearing  in  the  country  is  made  of  those  elements. 
That means, whoever the elements belong to, everything made of them is 
also his. Whoever the ﬁeld belongs to, the crops are his too. And whoever 
the sea belongs to, the things within it are also his. 

And  look,  these  textiles,  these  decorated  woven  materials,  are  being 
made  out  of  a  single  substance.  It  is  self-evidently  the  same  person  who 

1.  And the two small pumps allude to the breasts of mothers.
2.  As for the elements and minerals, these indicate the elements of air, water, light, and 
earth, which have numerous well-ordered duties; they hasten to the assistance of all needy 
beings with dominical leave, enter everywhere and bring help at the divine command, and 
raise all the things necessary for life and suckle living creatures, and are the source of the 
weaving and inscribing of the divine artefacts, and are their progenitors and cradles.

324

THE WORDS

brings the substance, prepares it, and makes it into string. For such a work 
disallows the participation of others. In which case, all the woven, skilfully 
made things are his alone. 

And look! Every sort of these woven, manufactured goods is found in 
every part of the country; they have spread with all their fellows, and are 
being made and woven together and one within the other, in the same way,  
at the same instant. This means they are the work of the same person and 
the same act through a single command, otherwise their correspondence and 
conformity at the same instant, in the same fashion, of the same sort, would 
be impossible. In which case, each of these skilfully fashioned things is like 
a proclamation of that hidden one that points to him. As if each sort of ﬂow-
ered material, each ingenious machine, each sweet mouthful, is a stamp of 
that miracle-displaying person; a stamp of his, a mark, a decoration; each 
says  through  the  tongue  of  disposition:  “ Whosever  work  of  art  I  am,  the 
boxes and shops where I am found are also his property. ” Each inscription 
says: “ Whoever wove me also wove the roll of cloth of which I am a part. ” 
Every sweet mouthful says: “ Whoever makes me and cooks me, the caul-
dron in which I am is also his. ” And every machine says: “ Whoever made 
me, also makes all those like me who have spread throughout the land, and 
the one who raises us in every part of it, is also he. This means he is also the 
country’s owner. In which case, whoever the owner of all this country and 
palace is, he may be our owner too. ” 

For example, in order to be the true owner of a single cartridge-belt or 
even a button belonging to the government, one also has to own all the facto-
ries in which they are made. If a bragging irregular soldier claims otherwise, 
he will be told: “ They are government property. ” They will be taken from 
him and he will be punished.

I n   S h o r t :  Just as the elements in this country all surround and encom-
pass it and their owner can only be the owner of the whole country, in the 
same way, since the works of art that are spread throughout it resemble one 
another and display a single stamp, they show that they are the art of one 
single person who governs everything.

My friend! There is a sign of oneness, a stamp of unity, in this country, 
that  is,  this  magniﬁcent  palace.  For  while  being  the  same,  certain  things 
are all-encompassing. And while being numerous, some display a unity or 
similarity  of  kind,  since  they  resemble  one  another  and  are  found  every-
where. As for unity, it shows a single being. This means that this country’s 
maker, owner, lord, and fashioner has to be one and the same. In addition, 

TWENTY-SECOND WORD – FIRST STATION

look carefully at this: from behind the veil of the unseen a thickish string has 
appeared. 1 Now look, thousands of strings have hung down from it. And see 
the tips of the strings: to each is attached a diamond, a decoration, a favour, 
a gift. Suitable presents are being given to everyone. Do you know what a 
lunatic  action it is not to recognize or thank the one who stretches out to 
these creatures from behind the strange veil of the unseen such wondrous 
favours and gifts. For if you do not recognize him, you will be compelled to 
say: “ These strings are themselves making the diamonds and other gifts on 
their tips and offering them. ” Then you have to accept that each string is in 
effect a king. Whereas before our eyes an unseen hand is making the strings 
too and attaching the gifts to them. This means, everything in this palace 
points to that miracle-displaying being rather than to themselves. If you do 
not recognize him, by denying all of them, you fall a hundred times lower 
than an animal.

Ninth Proof

NINTH PROOF

Come, my unreasoning friend! You do not recognize this palace’s owner 
and  you  do  not  want  to  recognize  him  because  you  deem  his  existence 
unlikely. You deviate into denial because with your narrow brain you can-
not comprehend his wondrous arts and acts. Whereas the true unlikelihood, 
real difﬁculties, hardships, and awesome trouble lie in not recognizing him. 
For if we recognize him, this whole palace, this world, becomes as easy, as 
trouble-free as a single thing; it becomes the means to the abundance and 
plenty around us. But if we do not recognize him and he does not exist, then 
everything becomes as difﬁcult as the whole palace, because everything is 
as skilfully made as the palace. Then neither the abundance nor the plenty 
would remain. Indeed, not one of these things which we see would pass into 
anyone’s hand, let alone ours. Look at just the jar of conserve attached to this 
string; 2 if it had not emerged from his hidden, miracle-displaying kitchen, 
we could not have bought it for a hundred l i r a s , although we buy it now for 
forty p a r a . 3

Yes, all unlikelihood, difﬁculty, trouble, arduousness, indeed, impossi-
bility,  lies  in  not  recognizing  him.  For  a  tree  is  given  life  from  one  root, 

1.  The thickish string alludes to fruit-bearing trees, the thousands of strings indicate 
their branches, and the diamonds, decorations, favours, and gifts allude to the varieties of 
blossoms and fruits.

2.  The jar of conserve indicates such gifts of divine mercy as melons, water melons, 
pomegranates, and coconuts, which are the conserves of divine power and are like tins of 
milk.

THE WORDS

in accordance with one law, in one centre, and the formation of thousands 
of fruits is as easy as one fruit. But if the fruits were tied to different centres 
and roots, and different laws, each fruit would be as difﬁcult to produce as 
the tree. And if the equipping of an entire army is in one centre, in accord-
ance with one law, and from one factory, in regard to quantity it is as easy 
as  equipping  a  single  soldier.  While  if  each  soldier  is  equipped  from  all 
different places, then to equip one soldier there would have to be as many 
factories as there are soldiers in the entire army.

Just  like  these  two  examples,  if  the  creation  of  all  these  things  in  this 
well-ordered palace, this ﬁne town, this advanced country, this magniﬁcent 
world is attributed to a single being, it becomes inﬁnitely easy and light and 
is the reason for the inﬁnite abundance, availability, and muniﬁcence we see. 
Otherwise everything would become so expensive, so difﬁcult, that even if 
the whole world were to be given to someone, they still would not be able to 
obtain a single thing.

Tenth Proof

TENTH PROOF

Come, my friend, who has come a little to his senses! We have been here 
ﬁfteen days  1 now. If we have not learnt the regulations of this world and 
do not recognize its king, we shall deserve punishment. We have no excuse, 
because for ﬁfteen days, as though given a respite, they did not interfere with 
us. Of course we have not just been left to our own devices. We cannot wan-
der around among these delicate, well-balanced, subtle, skilfully made and 
instructive creatures like an animal and spoil them; they would not permit 
us to harm them. The penalties of this country’s august king are bound to be 
awesome. You can understand how powerful and majestic he is from the way 
he orders this huge world as though it were a palace, and makes it revolve 
like a machine. He administers this large country like a house, missing noth-
ing. See, like ﬁlling a container and emptying it, he continuously ﬁlls this 
palace, this country, this town, with perfect order, and empties it with perfect 
wisdom. Like spreading out a table then clearing it away, varieties of foods 
are brought in turn and given to eat in the form of a great variety of tables 2 
being laid out by an unseen hand in every part of his vast country, and then 
being cleared away. The unseen hand clears away one, then brings another 
in its place. You see this too, and if you use your head, you will understand 
that within that awesome majesty is an inﬁnitely muniﬁcent liberality. 

1.  Fifteen days indicates the age of ﬁfteen, the age of discretion.
2.  The tables indicate the face of the earth in summer, during which hundreds of tables 
of the Most Merciful emerge fresh and various from the kitchens of mercy. Every garden 
is a cauldron, every tree, a tray-bearer.

And see, just as all these things testify to that unseen being’s sovereignty 
and  unity,  so  too  these  revolutions  and  changes  which  pass  on  in  succes-
sion  like  caravans  and  are  opened  and  closed  from  behind  that  true  veil, 
testify to his continuance and permanence. For the causes of things  disap-
pear along with them. Whereas the things which we attribute to them, which 
follow on after them, are repeated. That means those works are not theirs, 
but the works of one who does not perish. It is understood from the bubbles 
on the surface of a river disappearing and the bubbles which succeed them 
sparkling in the same way that what makes them sparkle is a constant and 
elevated possessor of light. Similarly, the speedy changing of things and the 
things that follow on after them assuming the same colours shows that they 
are the manifestations, inscriptions, mirrors, and works of art of one who is 
perpetual, undying, and single.

Eleventh Proof

ELEVENTH PROOF

Come, my friend! Now I shall show you a decisive proof as powerful as 
the ten previous ones. We shall board a boat,  1 and sail to a peninsula, far 
away. For the key to this riddle-ﬁlled world is there. Moreover, everyone is 
looking to the peninsula and awaiting something from it; they are receiving 
orders from there. See, we are on our way. Now we have arrived and have 
alighted  at  the  peninsula.  There  is  a  vast  gathering,  a  great  concourse,  as 
though all the notables of the country have gathered there. Look carefully, 
this  great  community  has  a  leader.  Come,  we  shall  draw  closer;  we  must 
become acquainted with him. Look! What brilliant decorations he has, more 
than a thousand of them. 2 How powerfully he speaks! How pleasant is his 
conversation! In these ﬁfteen days I have learnt a little of what he says. You 
learn them from me. See, he is speaking of this country’s miracle-displaying 
king. He is saying that the glorious king sent him to us. And he is display-
ing such wonders that they leave no doubt that he is his special envoy. Look 
carefully, it is not only the creatures on this peninsula that are listening to 
what he says; in wondrous fashion he is making the whole country hear. For 
near and far everyone is trying to hear the speech here. It is not only humans 

1.  The ship indicates history, and the peninsula, the Era of Bliss or Age of the Prophet 
( UWBP ).  Casting  off  the  dress  of  this  low  civilization  on  its  dark  shore,  entering  the 
seas of time, boarding the ship of history and alighting at the Arabian Peninsula and Era 
of Bliss, and visiting the Glory of the World ( UWBP ) at his duties, we know that he is a 
proof of divine unity so brilliant that he illuminates the entire globe and the two faces of 
the past and the future, and disperses the darkness of unbelief and misguidance.

that are listening, animals are listening too. Look, even the mountains are 
listening to the commands he brought so that they are stirring in their places, 
and the trees, too, move to the place he indicates. He brings forth water from 
wherever he wishes. He even makes his ﬁngers  into a Spring of Kawthar 
and gives to drink from them. Look, at his sign, an important lamp 1 in the 
dome of this palace splits into two. That means this country together with all 
its beings recognizes that he is an ofﬁcial and envoy. They heed and obey 
him, as though knowing that he is the most eminent, true interpreter of an 
unseen displayer of miracles, and the herald of his sovereignty, the discloser 
of his talisman, and a trustworthy envoy delivering his commands. All those 
with intelligence around him declare: “ Yes, that is right! ” about everything 
he says, and they afﬁrm it. Indeed, submitting to his signs and commands, 
the mountains and trees in this country and the huge lamp 2 that illuminates 
it, say: “ Yes, yes, everything you say is true! ”

My foolish friend! Could there be any contradiction or deception con-
cerning the miracle-displaying king about whom this most luminous, mag-
niﬁcent, and serious being, who bears a thousand decorations particular to 
the king’s own treasury, is speaking with all his strength, conﬁrmed by all 
the country’s notables, and concerning the king’s attributes which he men-
tions, and the commands which he relays? If there is anything contrary to 
the truth in these things, it will be necessary to deny this palace, these lamps, 
this community, both their reality and their existence. If you can, raise any 
objections against these; but you will see that they will be smashed by the 
power of the proof, and ﬂung back at you.

Twelfth Proof

TWELFTH PROOF

Come, my brother, who has come to his senses a little! I shall show you 
a further proof of the strength of all the eleven preceding proofs. See this 
luminous decree,  3 which descends from above and which everyone looks

Mawlana Jami said: “ With the pen of his ﬁnger, that unlettered one who knew no writing, 
wrote an a l i f  on the page of the skies and made one forty, two ﬁfties. ” That is, before it 
split, the moon resembled m ī m , the value of which is forty; and after splitting it became 
two crescents, and resembled two n ū n s , the value of which is ﬁfty.

2.  The huge light is the sun; when it reappeared from the east on the earth’s revolving

the prayers since the Prophet ( UWBP ) was sleeping in his arms, due to this miracle, was 
able to perform the prayers on time.

thousand decorations has stopped by it and is explaining its meaning to eve-
ryone. The styles of the decree so shine they attract everyone’s appreciative 
gaze, and it speaks of matters so important and serious that everyone is com-
pelled to give ear to them. For it describes all the qualities, acts, commands, 
and  attributes  of  the  being  who  governs  this  whole  land,  who  made  this 
palace, and exhibits these wonders. Just as there is a mighty stamp on the 
decree as a whole, look! there is an inimitable seal on every line and every 
sentence, and, moreover, the meanings, truths, commands, and instances of 
wisdom it states are seen to be in a style particular to him, thus bearing the 
meaning of a stamp.

I n   S h o r t :  The supreme decree shows the Supreme Being as clearly as the 

sun, so that anyone who is not blind can see it.

My friend! If you have come to your senses, this is enough for now. If 

you have something to say, say it. 

In reply, the once-obstinate man said: “ I can only say this in the face of 
these proofs of yours: All praise be to Allah for I have come to believe. And 
I believe as brilliantly as the sun and as clearly as daylight that this country 
has a single King of Perfection, this world, a Single Glorious Owner, and 
this palace, a Single Beauteous Maker. May Allah be pleased with you, for 
you have saved me from my former obstinacy and foolishness. Each of the 
proofs you showed was sufﬁcient to demonstrate the truth. But because with 
each successive proof, clearer, pleasanter, more agreeable, more luminous, 
and ﬁner levels of knowledge, veils in acquaintanceship, and windows of 
love were opened and revealed, I waited and listened. ”

The above story in the form of a comparison indicating the mighty truth 
of divine unity and belief in Allah has reached its conclusion. Through the 
grace of the Most Merciful, the effulgence of the Qur’an, and the light of 
belief, we shall now set out twelve Flashes and an introduction from the sun 
of true divine unity corresponding to the twelve proofs in the story.

Introduction

In my treatise entitled K a t r e , which is about belief in Allah, the prin-
cipal pole of the pillars of belief, I explained in brief the evidence of 
and  testimony  to  Almighty  Allah’s  existence  and  unity  furnished  by 
all beings through ﬁfty-ﬁve tongues. Also, in the treatise N o k t a  I men-
tioned four universal proofs out of the evidences of Almighty Allah’s 
existence and unity each of which has the strength of a thousand proofs. 
Moreover, since I have discussed in around twelve of my Arabic trea-
tises hundreds of decisive proofs demonstrating Almighty Allah’s nec-
essary existence and unity, I shall be content with those and not now 
undertake any profound investigations. Here, I shall try only to explain 
in this Twenty-Second Word, twelve Flashes from the sun of belief in 
Allah which I have written brieﬂy in other places in the R i s a l e - i   N u r .

FIRST FLASH

The afﬁrmation of divine unity is of two sorts. For example, if the goods 
of a rich man arrive in a market or a town, there are two ways in which one 
may know they are his. Brieﬂy and simply, one of them is as with ordinary 
people:  “ No  one  apart  from  him  is  capable  of  owning  this  vast  amount 
of goods. ” However, much of it may be stolen when under the  supervi-
sion of such people. Many others may claim ownership of parts of it. The 
second  sort  is  this:  by  reading  the  rich  man’s  writing  on  every  packet, 
recognizing his signature on every roll, and seeing his seal on every bill, 
others declare: “ Everything belongs to that person. ” In this case, virtually 
everything shows the important man. Similarly, the afﬁrmation of divine 
unity is of two sorts:

O n e  is the superﬁcial, common afﬁrmation of divine unity which says: 

“ Almighty Allah is One, He has no partner or like. This universe is His. ”

T h e   S e c o n d  is the true afﬁrmation of divine unity which, by seeing on 
everything  the  stamp  of  His  power,  the  seal  of  His  dominicality,  and  the 
inscriptions of His pen, is to open a window directly onto His light from eve-
rything and to conﬁrm and believe with almost the certainty of seeing it that 
He is One and that everything emerges from the hand of His power; and that 
in no way has He any partner or assistant in His Godhead or in His domini-
cality or in His sovereignty; and so to attain to a sort of perpetual awareness 
of the divine presence. In this Word, we shall mention rays demonstrating 
this pure and elevated true afﬁrmation of divine unity.

A Reminder within the First Point: O heedless worshipper of causes! 
Causes are a veil; for divine dignity and grandeur require them to be thus. But 
that which acts and performs matters is the power of the Eternally Besought 
One;  for  divine  unity  and  glory  require  it  to  be  thus  and  necessitate  their 
independence. The ofﬁcials of the Pre-Eternal Monarch are not executives 
of the sovereignty of dominicality, they are the heralds of His sovereignty 
and  the  observers  and  superintendents  of  His  dominicality.  Their  purpose 
is to make known the dignity of power and majesty of dominicality so that 
power should not be seen to be associated with base and lowly matters. Not 
like a human king who, tainted by impotence and indigence, takes ofﬁcials as 
partners. That is to say, causes have been placed so that the dignity of power 
may be preserved in the superﬁcial view of the mind. For like the two faces 
of a mirror, everything has an outer face that looks to this manifest world, 
which resembles the mirror’s coloured face and may reﬂect various colours 
and states, and an inner face that looks to its Maker, which resembles the 

332

THE WORDS

mirror’s shining face. The outer face which looks to the manifest world may 
include states incompatible with the dignity and perfection of the Eternally 
Besought One’s power, so causes have been put to be both the source and 
the means of those states. But in the inner face, that of reality, which looks to 
their Creator, everything is transparent and beautiful; it is ﬁtting that power 
should  itself  be  associated  with  it;  it  is  not  incompatible  with  its  dignity. 
Causes are  therefore purely apparent and have no true effect in the inner 
face of things and in reality.

A further instance of wisdom in apparent causes is this: causes have been 
put so that unjust complaints and baseless objections should be directed at 
them and not at the Absolutely Just One. For the faults arise from them, from 
their incapacity and lack of ability. There is a narration in the form of a com-
parison which provides a subtle example illustrating this mystery.

The  Angel  Azra’il  ( Upon  whom  be  peace )  said  to  Almighty  Allah: 
“ Your  servants  will  complain  about  me  as  I  carry  out  my  duty  of  taking 
possession of the spirits of the dying; they will be resentful towards me. ” 
So Almighty Allah said to him through the tongue of wisdom: “ I shall leave 
the veil of disasters and illnesses between you and my servants so that the 
complaints will be directed at them, and they will not be indignant at you. ” 
So see, illnesses are a veil; what are imagined to be the bad things at the 
appointed hour are attributed to them, and what are in reality the good things 
in  the  seizure  of  the  spirits  of  the  dying  are  attributed  to  Azra’il’s  ( UWP ) 
duty. Azra’il is also a veil; he is a supervisor of that duty and a veil to divine 
power  so  that  certain  conditions  that  occur  when  spirits  are  seized  which 
are apparently unkind and are inappropriate to the perfection of mercy, are 
attributed to him.

Yes, dignity and grandeur demand that causes are a veil to the hand of 
power in the view of the mind, while divine unity and glory demand that 
causes withdraw their hands and have no true effect.

Look at this garden of the universe, this orchard of the earth; look care-
fully at the beautiful face of the heavens gilded with stars! You will see that 
on all the artefacts spread out and scattered over them are stamps particular 
to  the  Creator  of  All  Things,  and  on  all  creatures  are  seals  special  to  the 
Maker of All Things, and on the levels of being – which are written on the 
pages of night and day and summer and winter and are published by the pen 
of power – are inimitable, illustrious signatures of an All-Glorious Maker, 

TWENTY-SECOND WORD – SECOND STATION

333

an All-Beauteous Creator. We shall now, by way of example, mention a few 
of those stamps, seals, and signatures.

For example, of the innumerable stamps, consider this one out of the 
many placed on life: “ He makes everything out of one thing and makes 
one  thing  out  of  everything. ”  For  He  makes  the  innumerable  members 
and systems of animals out of a ﬂuid and also out of simple water which 
is drunk; to make one thing everything is surely the work of a Possessor 
of Absolute  Power. And the being who with perfect order transforms into 
a particular body numerous substances from the innumerable foods con-
sumed, whether plant or animal, and weaves from them a particular skin, 
and makes from them simple members, is surely One Powerful over All 
Things and One Knowing of All Things. Indeed, the Creator of Life and 
Death administers life through His wisdom in this workshop of the world 
in accordance with a law that issues from His command and is so miracu-
lous that only one who holds the whole universe in the grasp of his power 
could apply that law and enforce it.

Thus, if your mind is not extinguished and your heart not blind, you will 
understand that what makes one thing everything with perfect ease and order, 
and makes everything one thing skilfully with perfect balance and order, is a 
stamp particular to the Maker of everything and a seal special to the Creator 
of All Things. For example, you see that in addition to weaving a hundred 
rolls of broadcloth and various other cloths like silk or cambric from a single 
ounce of cotton, a wonder-worker makes many foods from it like helva and 
pastries, then you see that he takes a handful of iron and stone, honey and 
butter, and water and earth then makes some ﬁne gold – seeing this you will 
certainly declare that he possesses unique skill and art, for all the elements 
of  the  earth  are  subjugated  to  his  command  and  all  the  substances  of  the 
earth subject to his word. The manifestation of power and wisdom in life, 
however, is a thousand times more wondrous than this example.

Thus, one stamp on life out of many.

Look at the living creatures revolving in this ﬂowing universe, in this 
ﬂood of beings! You will see that many seals have been placed on each 
by the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One. One of them is this: a living 
creature, for example a human being, is quite simply a miniature sample 
of the universe, a fruit of the tree of creation, and a seed of the world, for 
he comprises samples of most of the realms of beings in the world. It is as 
if, as an animate being, he is a drop ﬁltered from the universe in extremely

ﬁne  measure.  So  to  create  him  and  be  his  Sustainer,  one  would  have  to 
hold the whole universe in the grasp of one’s power.

Thus,  if  your  mind  is  not  submerged  in  delusions  you  will  understand 
that to make a word of power, for example, a honey-bee, a minute index of 
most things, and to write in one page, for example in man, most of the mat-
ters in this book of the universe, and to include in one point, for example in 
a tiny ﬁg seed, the programme of the mighty ﬁg tree, and to display in a  sin-
gle letter, for example in the human heart, the works of all the divine names 
which are manifested in the pages of the macrocosm and encompass them, 
and to make written in the human faculty of memory, which is situated in a 
place the size of a lentil, writings enough to ﬁll a library, and to include in 
that tiny faculty a detailed index of all events in the cosmos – to do all these 
things is most certainly a stamp particular to the Creator of All Things, the 
Glorious Lord and Sustainer of the universe.

Thus, if only one seal out of many dominical seals on living beings thus 
displays its light and makes read its signs, and you were able to see and con-
sider all those seals at once, would you not declare:

Look  carefully  at  the  multicoloured,  multifarious  beings  swimming  in 
the seas of the heavens and scattered over the face of the earth! You will 
see that on each are inimitable signatures of the Pre-Eternal Sun. Just as the 
stamps on life and seals on living beings are apparent and we saw one or two 
of them, so are there such signatures on the giving of life. Since comparisons 
bring profound meanings closer to the understanding, we shall employ one 
to demonstrate this truth.

For example, from the planets to droplets of water, to fragments of glass 
and sparkling snowﬂakes, a signature is apparent from the sun’s image and 
reﬂection, a luminous work particular to the sun. If you do not accept the 
tiny suns that are visible in those innumerable things to be the manifestation 
of the sun’s reﬂection, you have to accept the actual existence of a true, natu-
ral sun in every droplet and fragment of glass facing the light and in every 
transparent speck before it, thus descending to the depths of lunacy.

In  just  the  same  way,  in  regard  to  the  giving  of  life  from  among  the 
luminous manifestations of the Pre-Eternal Sun, such a signature is present 
on  all  living  beings  that  supposing  all  causes  were  gathered  together  and 

TWENTY-SECOND WORD – SECOND STATION

had the power to act and possessed will, they still could not imitate it. For 
all being miracles of divine power, living beings are points of focus of the 
divine  names,  the  rays  of  the  Pre-Eternal  Sun.  If  that  strange  inscription 
of  art,  that  wondrous  ordering  of  wisdom,  that  manifestation  of  the  mys-
tery of Oneness on living beings is not ascribed to the Single and Eternally 
Besought  One,  it  necessitates  accepting  that  concealed  within  each  living 
creature, and even in a ﬂy or a ﬂower, is an inﬁnite creative power, a knowl-
edge encompassing all things, an absolute will with which to govern the uni-
verse, and even the eternal attributes particular to the Necessarily  Existent 
One. One otherwise falls to the most ludicrous degree of misguidance and 
superstition. Quite simply, it necessitates attributing divinity to each particle 
of the ﬂower or ﬂy. For a state has been given to those particles, especially if 
they are in seeds, whereby they look to the living being of which they are a 
part and take up a position in accordance with its systems and ordering. The 
particle is even in a position to look to all members of the species to which 
its living being belongs, or to ﬂy with wings so as to be planted in a place 
conducive to the perpetuation of its species and to plant the species’ ﬂag. 
In fact, it holds a position whereby that living being’s transactions with all 
other beings may be continued and its relations with them connected with 
sustenance. For it is in need of all of them.

Thus, if the particle is not an ofﬁcial of an Absolutely Powerful Being 
and if its relation with Him is severed, it has to be ascribed an eye which sees 
all things and a consciousness which encompasses all things.

I n   S h o r t :  If the miniature suns and various colours in droplets of water 
and fragments of glass are not attributed to the sun’s reﬂection and the mani-
festation  of  its  reﬂection,  one  has  to  accept  the  existence  of  innumerable 
suns in place of the one sun; it necessitates accepting an utterly impossible 
superstition. In exactly the same way, if everything is not attributed to the 
Absolutely Powerful One, it necessitates accepting inﬁnite gods instead of 
the Single Allah; indeed, gods to the number of particles in existence, thus 
falling to the degree of accepting a hundredfold impossibility.

T o   S u m   U p :  From every particle three windows open up onto the light of 

unity and necessary existence of the Pre-Eternal Sun.

First Window

First Window: A soldier has a relation with each of the spheres of the 
army, that is, with his squad, his company, his battalion, his regiment, his 
division, and the army, and duties in accordance with those relations, and 
actions in accordance with the duties and army regulations. Particles have 
similar relations.

336

THE WORDS

For example, a lifeless particle in the pupil of your eye has relations with 
your  eye,  your  head,  your  body,  your  powers  of  reproduction,  attraction, 
depiction and repulsion, with your veins and arteries, and motor and sensory 
nerves, and with the rest of the human race, and it has duties in relation to 
each. This shows self-evidently to eyes that are not blind that it is the work 
of art and charged ofﬁcial of the Pre-Eternal All-Powerful One, and is under 
his regulation.

Second Window

Second Window: All molecules of air may visit all ﬂowers and fruits. 
They may also enter them and work within them. If they are not the sub-
jugated  ofﬁcials  of  an  Absolutely  Powerful  One  Who  sees  and  knows  all 
things, those wandering molecules would have to know all the systems and  
structures of the fruits and ﬂowers and their art, and the tailoring of the all-
different  forms  which  clothe  them  with  its  perfect  and  all-embracing  art. 
Thus those particles all display as clearly as the sun the rays of a light of 
divine unity. You may compare light with air, and earth with water.

In  any  event,  the  original  sources  of  things  are  these  four  substances. 
According to modern science they are hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitro-
gen, the components of the former elements.

Third Window

Third Window: You ﬁll a ﬂower-pot with some earth, which is com-
posed  of  particles  and  is  the  means  of  growth  of  any  ﬂowering  or  fruit-
bearing plant, then put some seeds in it. In the same way that the seed of 
animals does not differ, but is a ﬂuid, the seeds of all the ﬂowering and fruit-
bearing plants in the world do not differ from one another. Being composed 
of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, they only differ in respect of the 
programme of their progenitors, deposited in them through the immaterial 
writing of the pen of divine determining. 

Thus,  if  we  put  these  seeds  in  turn  in  the  ﬂower-pot,  we  believe  as 
though  it  has  already  occurred  that  each  plant  will  appear  together  with 
its wonderful forms and shapes and parts. If the particles are not ofﬁcials 
under the orders of one who knows all the states and conditions of every-
thing, is capable of giving everything a being suitable to it and everything 
necessary for it, and to whose power everything is subjugated with utterly 
facility, every particle of the earth would then have to contain immaterial 
factories and printing-presses to the number of all the ﬂowering and fruit-
bearing plants, so that it could be the source of all those various and dif-
ferent beings whose parts, members, and forms are all distant and different 
from one another. It would otherwise be necessary to attribute to all those 
beings comprehensive knowledge and a power capable of forming them, 
so that they could be the means of the above.

TWENTY-SECOND WORD – SECOND STATION

That is to say, if the connection with Almighty Allah is severed, it becomes 
necessary to accept gods to the number of particles of earth, and this is an 
impossible superstition compounded a thousand times over. However, when 
they are ofﬁcials, it becomes extremely easy. Just as, in his king’s name and 
through his power, a common soldier of a mighty king can make a whole 
country migrate, or join two seas, or take another king prisoner; so at the 
command of the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, a ﬂy did away 
with Nimrod and an ant destroyed Pharaoh’s palace, razing it to the ground, 
and a ﬁg seed bears the load of a ﬁg tree. 

Moreover, in all particles are two further truthful witnesses to the Mak-
er’s necessary existence and unity. One is that together with their absolute 
impotence, they all perform important and various duties. The  other is that 
despite their lifelessness, they all conform to the universal order and sys-
tems, thus displaying a universal consciousness. That is to say, through the 
tongue of its impotence each particle testiﬁes to the necessary existence of 
the Absolutely Powerful One, and through its conforming to the order in the 
world, each testiﬁes to His unity.

ٍىَ(cid:110)  ّ
Just as every particle testiﬁes in two ways to His being the Necessarily 
Existent One of Unity, so too on every living being there are two signs indi-
cating that He is the Single and Eternally Besought One.

Yes, present on all living beings are a seal of divine oneness and a stamp 
of  eternal  besoughtedness.  For  each  displays  together  in  the  mirror  of  its 
being most of the divine names, the manifestations of which are apparent in 
the universe. Quite simply, like a point of focus each displays the manifesta-
tion of the greatest name of the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One. Thus, 
since it displays a sort of shadow of the oneness of the Divine Essence under 
the veil of the name of Giver of Life, it bears a stamp of divine oneness. And 
since the living being is like a miniature sample of the universe and a fruit of 
the tree of creation, it shows a seal of divine eternal besoughtedness, which 
with ease conveys to the tiny sphere of its life all its needs, which are as 
many as the universe. That is to say, this demonstrates that it has a Sustainer 
Whose regard and favour take the place of all things. Everything in exist-
ence cannot take the place of His regard.

Furthermore, this situation shows that its Sustainer is in need of nothing, 
nor does anything diminish His treasury, nor is anything at all difﬁcult for 
His power. This, then, is a sort of seal of eternal besoughtedness.

Thus,  on  every  living  being  are  a  seal  of  divine  oneness  and  stamp  of 
eternal  besoughtedness.  Yes,  through  the  tongue  of  its  life,  every  living 
being recites:

( 112:1-2 ) ' & *$ # " ! 
In addition to these two seals are several more important windows, but 
they have been explained in detail in other places, so our discussion here has 
been brief.

Seeing that each particle in existence at once opens up three windows 
and two openings onto the unity of the Necessarily Existent, and life too 
opens two doors, you can compare how all the levels of beings from parti-
cles to the sun spread the light of knowledge of the All-Glorious One. You 
can understand from this the degrees of progress in knowledge of Allah, 
and the levels of awareness of His presence.

If a book is handwritten and in the form of a letter, a single pen is suf-
ﬁcient  to  write  it,  while  if  it  is  printed,  pens,  that  is,  pieces  of  print,  are 
necessary to the number of the book’s letters so that it can be printed and 
come into existence. If most of the book is written in an extremely ﬁne script 
within some of its letters, like the sura Y ā .   S ī n .  is sometimes written within 
the letters Y ā .   S ī n . , then for it to be printed all the small pieces of print are 
necessary for those single letters. 

Similarly, if you say the book of the universe is the writing of the pen 
of the Eternally Besought One’s power and the missive of the Single and 
Unique One, you travel a reasonable road so easy it is necessary. But if you 
attribute the book to nature and causes, you travel a road so difﬁcult it is 
impossible and so full of superstition and delusion it is unacceptable. For 
then there would have to be present in every bit of earth and every drop of 
water  and  every  piece  of  air  millions  of  metal  printing  presses  and  innu-
merable  immaterial  factories  which  could  fashion  and  form  the  countless 

TWENTY-SECOND WORD – SECOND STATION

339

numbers of ﬂowering and fruit-bearing plants. Otherwise one would have 
to accept that they possess all-encompassing knowledge and power over all 
things so they could be the true source of those creatures. For every piece 
of earth, water, and air can be the source of most plants. However, plants, 
whether ﬂowering or fruit-bearing, are formed in so well-ordered and bal-
anced a fashion, and are so distinctive and different from one another, that 
a different immaterial factory or different printing press would be necessary 
for each. This means that if nature ceases being a pattern and becomes the 
source,  everything  must  necessarily  contain  the  machines  to  make  every-
thing else. Nature-worship is therefore based on an idea so superstitious that 
even those who subscribe to it are ashamed of it. See the inﬁnitely delirious 
unreason of the misguided, who suppose themselves to be intelligent, and 
take a lesson!

I n   S h o r t :  All the letters of a book describe themselves to the extent of 
a  letter  and  point  to  their  own  existence  in  one  way,  while  they  describe 
their writer with ten words and show him in many ways. For example: “ The 
one who wrote me has ﬁne handwriting. His pen is red, and so on. ” In just 
the  same  way,  all  the  letters  of  the  mighty  book  of  the  universe  point  to 
themselves to the extent of their own size and physical beings, but describe 
the names of the Pre-Eternal Inscriber like odes and testify to the One they 
signify and point to His names with ﬁngers to the number of their attributes. 
Therefore, even if one denies both oneself and the universe like the foolish 
Sophists, he still should not deny the All-Glorious Maker.

Just as the All-Glorious Creator has placed the seals of His oneness on 
the heads of all His beings and on the foreheads of all His creatures, some of 
which you have seen in the previous Flashes; so in brilliant fashion He has 
placed many stamps of oneness on all species and numerous seals of unity 
on all universals, as well as the various stamps of unity on the world as a 
whole. Of those many seals and stamps, we shall point out one on the page 
of the face of the earth in the springtime. It is like this.

The Pre-Eternal Inscriber’s raising to life in the spring and summer at 
least three hundred thousand species of plants and animals with complete 
distinction and differentiation and total order and separation amid inﬁnite 
intermingling and confusion, is a stamp of divine unity as clear and bril-
liant as the spring itself. Yes, anyone with an iota of consciousness will 
understand  that  to  create  with  perfect  order  while  raising  to  life  of  the 

340

dead earth in the spring, three hundred thousand samples of the resurrec-
tion of the dead, and to write without fault, error, mistake or deﬁciency, in 
most well-balanced, well-proportioned, well-ordered, and perfect fashion 
the  individual  members  of  three  hundred  thousand  different  species  one 
within the other on the face of the earth, is a seal particular to an All-Glo-
rious One, an All-Powerful One of Perfection, an All-Wise One of Beauty, 
possessing inﬁnite power, all-encompassing knowledge, and a will capa-
ble of governing the whole universe. The All-Wise Qur’an decrees:

 Ü Û Ú Ù Ø × Ö Õ Ô Ó Ò Ñ Ð Ï Î Í
( 30:50 ) á à ß Þ Ý
Yes, it is surely easy for the creative power which, within a few days, 
demonstrates examples of three hundred thousand resurrections in raising 
the  earth  to  life,  to  raise  men  to  life.  For  example,  could  it  be  said  to  a 
displayer of miracles who at a sign will remove the mountains of Gelincik 
and Sübhan: “ Are you able to remove from this valley the huge rock that is 
blocking our path? ” Similarly, can it be said in a way that infers doubt to 
an All-Wise and Powerful One, an All-Generous and Compassionate One, 
Who created the sky and the mountains and the earth in six days and con-
tinuously  ﬁlls  and  empties  them:  “ Can  you  remove  from  us  this  layer  of 
earth that is blocking our way to your banquet, which was prepared and laid 
out in eternity? Can you level the earth and let us pass on? ”

You observed a seal of divine unity on the face of the earth in the sum-
mertime. Now look! A stamp of unity is clearly obvious on the vast, wise 
and perspicacious disposals of the spring on the face of the earth. For that  
activity is on an absolutely vast scale, and the vastness is together with an 
absolute speed, and that speed is together with an absolute muniﬁcence, and 
together with these are apparent an absolute order and perfect beauty of art 
and exquisiteness of creation. These form a seal which could only belong to 
a being who possesses inﬁnite knowledge and boundless power. Yes, we see 
that on the earth within an absolute extensiveness are a creation, disposal, 
and activity which are on an absolutely vast scale. And these are occurring 
within  that  vast  scope  with  absolute  speed.  And  together  with  that  speed 
and  vast  scope  an  absolute  muniﬁcence  is  apparent  in  the  multiplication 
of individual beings. And together with that muniﬁcence, vast scope, and 
speed,  an  absolute  ease  is  apparent.  And  to  create  the  absolute  order  and 
exceptional beauty of art to be seen in all species and individuals, and the 
perfect differentiation within inﬁnite intermingling, and the valuable works

within extreme abundance, and the complete correspondence on an exten-
sive scale, and the artistic marvels with the greatest ease, and to demonstrate 
a wondrous art and miraculous activity at one moment, everywhere, in the 
same  fashion,  in  every  individual  –  together  with  that  muniﬁcence,  ease, 
speed, and vast scope, is certainly and without doubt the stamp of One Who 
although He is nowhere is all-present and all-seeing everywhere. Nothing is 
hidden from Him, nor is anything difﬁcult for Him. Particles and stars are 
equal in relation to His power.

For  example,  in  a  garden  of  that  All-Beauteous  and  Compassionate 
One’s  muniﬁcence,  I  counted  the  bunches  hanging  from  a  grapevine  two 
ﬁngers thick, which I saw to be like one little pip among the bunches of His 
miracles: there were one hundred and ﬁfty-ﬁve. I counted the grapes in one 
bunch:  there  were  around  one  hundred  and  twenty.  I  thought:  if  this  vine 
were a tap from which ﬂowed honeyed water and it produced water con-
tinuously, it would only just be enough for the bunches which, in the face 
of this heat, suckle those hundreds of little pumps of the sherbet of mercy. 
However, it only occasionally obtains a little moisture. The One Who does 
this, then, must surely be powerful over all things.

Look! With little difﬁculty you can see the seals of the Single, Eternally 
Besought One on the page of the earth, so raise your head, open your eyes, 
and look too at the great book of the universe. You will see that on it as a 
whole a stamp of unity is read out which is as clear as it is big. For like the 
components of a factory or members of a palace or orderly town, beings sup-
port one another, stretch out their hands to assist one another, and  answer 
the  needs  and  requests  of  one  another,  saying:  “ Here  I  am,  at  your  serv-
ice! ”  Assisting  one  another,  they  work  together  in  order.  Joining  efforts, 
they serve animate beings. Co-operating and turned a single goal, they obey 
an All-Wise Disposer. They conform to a rule of mutual assistance which is 
in force from the sun and moon, night and day, and winter and summer, to 
plants coming to the assistance of hungry and needy animals, and animals 
hastening  to  the  assistance  of  weak,  noble  men,  and  even  nutritious  sub-
stances ﬂying to assist delicate, weak infants and fruits, and particles of food 
passing to the assistance of the cells of the body. They show to anyone who 
is not altogether blind that they are acting through the strength of a single, 
most generous Nurturer and at the command of a single, most wise Disposer.

342

THE WORDS

Thus, on the one hand this mutual support and assistance, this answering 
one another’s needs, this mutual embracing, this subjugation, and this order 
that are in force in the universe testify decisively that beings are adminis-
tered and organized by a single Disposer and are being impelled and directed 
by a single Nurturer. And on the other hand, the perfect grace within the uni-
versal wisdom to be seen plainly in the art of things; and the all-embracing 
mercy which shines within the providence; and the sustenance spread over 
that mercy and scattered so as to answer the needs of all living beings needy 
for sustenance; – these form a stamp of divine unity so brilliant that anyone 
whose  mind  is  not  altogether  extinguished  will  understand  it  and  anyone 
who is not altogether blind will see it. 

Yes, a veil of wisdom demonstrating intention, consciousness, and will 
has  covered  the  whole  universe,  and  upon  that  veil  of  wisdom  has  been 
spread a veil of grace and favour exhibiting beneﬁcence, adornment, embel-
lishment, and benevolence; and over that adorned veil of favour a garment 
of mercy displaying ﬂashes of making known and loved, of bestowal and 
the granting of gifts has enveloped the universe; and spread over that illu-
minated  veil  of  universal  mercy  is  a  table  of  general  provisions  showing 
kindness  and  bestowal  and  benevolence  and  perfect  compassion  and  ﬁne 
nurturing and dominical favour.

Yes, all beings from particles to suns, whether individuals or species, or 
large or small, have been clothed in a magniﬁcent shirt of wisdom embroi-
dered  with  fruits  and  aims,  beneﬁts  and  purposes.  And  over  the  wisdom-
displaying shirt, a garment of favour embroidered with ﬂowers of grace and 
beneﬁcence has been cut out in accordance with the stature of things; and 
over that ornamented garment of favour, a general table of sustenance has 
been set up, lit up with ﬂashes of love, bestowal, affection, and the granting 
of gifts, to which the decorations of mercy have been attached,  and which, 
together with bestowing those illuminated and jewel-encrusted decorations, 
is sufﬁcient for all the groups of living beings on the face of the earth and 
meets all their needs. Thus, this matter points to an All-Beauteous Provider 
Who is All-Wise, All-Generous, and All-Compassion-ate, and shows Him 
as clearly as the sun.

Is that so? Is everything in need of sustenance?
Yes, like individual beings are in need of sustenance and all the neces-
sities  to  continue  their  lives,  we  see  that  all  the  beings  in  the  world,  and 
especially  living  beings,  whether  universal  or  particular,  wholes  or  parts, 
have  many  desires  and  needs,  material  and  otherwise,  for  their  existence,

Any sort of seed sown in a ﬁeld shows that the ﬁeld must be at the dis-

sameness and uncomplex nature, and the plants and animals – these fruits of 
mercy, miracles of power, and words of wisdom known as creatures – and 
their spreading to most places and settling everywhere as well as their being 
similar and resembling one another, show that they are under the disposal 
of a single miracle-displaying Maker, and in such a way that it is as if every 
ﬂower, fruit, and animal is a seal, stamp, and signature of its Maker. Wher-
ever they are found, each says through the tongue of disposition: “ Whosever 
seal I am, the place I am found is also of his making. Whosever stamp I am, 
this place is a missive of His. Whosever signature I am, this land too is of his 
weaving. ” This means, to be Sustainer of the least creature is particular to 
the One Who holds all the elements in the grasp of His power. Anyone not 
blind can see that to regulate and govern the simplest animal is particular to 
the One Who has all beings in the grasp of His dominicality.

Indeed,  through  the  tongue  of  similarity  to  other  individual  beings,  all  
individual beings say: “ Only one who owns my species can be my owner. 
It  cannot  be  otherwise. ”  And  through  the  tongue  of  spreading  over  the 
face of the earth together with other species, each species says: “ Only one 
who owns the whole face of the earth can be our owner. It cannot be other-
wise. ” And through the tongue of being bound to the sun and other planets 
and mutually supportive with the skies, the earth says: “ Only one who is 
owner  of  the  whole  universe  can  be  my  owner.  It  cannot  be  otherwise. ” 
Yes,  supposing  someone  were  to  say  to  a  conscious  apple:  “ You  are  my 
work  of  art. ”  Through  the  tongue  of  disposition,  the  apple  would  reply:

THE WORDS

“ Be silent! If you are capable of fashioning all the other apples on the earth; 
indeed, if you can have disposal over all my fellows, the other fruit-bearing 
trees, spread over the earth, and all the gifts of the Most Merciful proceed-
ing from the treasury of mercy in boatloads, then you can claim to be my 
Sustainer. ” The apple would say that and aim a slap at that foolish person.

We have pointed out some of the seals, stamps, and signatures on particu-
lars and parts, universals and wholes, on the world as a whole, and on life, 
living beings, and raising to life. Now, we shall indicate one of the countless 
stamps on species.

Since  the  countless  fruits  of  a  fruit-bearing  tree  are  administered  from 
one centre, in accordance with one law and a single way of raising, the dif-
ﬁculty,  hardship,  and  expense  are  transformed  into  ease.  It  is  so  easy  the 
numerous  fruits  raised  become  equal  to  a  single  fruit.  This  means  that  in 
regard to quantity, multiplicity and numerous centres necessitate the whole 
tree’s difﬁculty, expense, and equipment for a single fruit. The difference is 
only in regard to quality, like all the factories required for the whole army 
are  needed  to  manufacture  all  the  military  equipment  of  a  single  soldier. 
That  is  to  say,  if  the  matter  passes  from  unity  to  multiplicity,  in  respect 
of quantity the difﬁculties increase to the number of individuals. Thus, the 
extraordinary ease to be seen clearly in all species is the result of the ease 
and facility arising from unity.

I n   S h o r t :  The conformity and similarity in basic members between all 
the members of a species and all the species of a genus prove that they are 
the works of a single Maker, because the unity of the pen and oneness of 
the seal require this. Similarly, the observable absolute ease and lack of dif-
ﬁculty require – indeed, necessitate – that they are the works of One Maker. 
Otherwise difﬁculties rising to the degree of impossibility would doom the 
genus and the species to non-existence.

T o   C o n c l u d e :  If all things are ascribed to Almighty Allah, they become  
as easy as a single thing, while if they are attributed to causes, they become as 
difﬁcult as everything. Since it is thus, the extraordinary profusion observed 
in the universe and the boundless abundance before our eyes display a stamp 
of unity like the sun. If the fruits which we obtain in such plenty were not the 
property of the Single One of Unity, we would not have a single pomegran-
ate to eat, even if we gave the whole world for it.

Just as life, which displays a manifestation of divine beauty, is a proof 
of divine oneness and a sort of manifestation of unity; death too, which dis-
plays the manifestation of divine glory, is a proof of divine unity.

For  example,  ( 16:60 )   j  i  h,  by  showing  the  sun’s  light  and 
reﬂection, the bubbles on a wide ﬂowing river which sparkle in the sun tes-
tify to the sun as do transparent objects which glisten on the face of the 
earth. On those tribes of bubbles and transparent objects disappearing, the 
continued magniﬁcent manifestation of the sun and the uninterrupted and 
constant  display  of  its  light  on  the  successive  groups  and  tribes  of  bub-
bles and transparent objects which follow on after them, testify decisively 
that  the  little  images  of  the  sun  and  the  lights  and  ﬂashes  which  appear 
and sparkle, ﬂare up and die away, and are changed and renewed, are the 
manifestations of an enduring, perpetual, elevated, single sun whose mani-
festation is undying. That is to say, just as through their appearance and 
becoming visible, the shining droplets demonstrate the sun’s existence; so 
with their disappearance and extinction, they demonstrate its continuation, 
permanence, and unity.

In  exactly  the  same  way,  through  their  existence  and  lives  these  ﬂow-
ing beings testify to the necessary existence and oneness of the Necessarily 
Existent  One,  and  with  their  deaths  and  disappearance,  they  testify  to  the 
His pre-eternity, everlastingness, and oneness. Yes, the beautiful creatures 
and ﬁne beings which are renewed and restored within the decline and dis-
appearance that occur through the alternation of night and day, winter and 
summer, and the centuries and ages, surely point to the existence, continu-
ance, and unity of an elevated, eternal possessor of continually manifested 
beauty. While the deaths and disappearance of those beings together with 
their apparent and lowly causes demonstrate that the causes are nothing but a 
mere veil. This situation proves decisively that these arts, these inscriptions, 
these manifestations, are the constantly renewed arts, the changing inscrip-
tions, the moving mirrors of an All-Beauteous One of Glory, all of Whose 
names are sacred and beautiful; that they are His seals which follow on one 
after the other and His stamps that are changed with wisdom.

I n   S h o r t :   The  mighty  book  of  the  universe  both  teaches  us  the  crea-
tional  signs  concerning  divine  existence  and  unity,  and  it  testiﬁes  to  all 
the  attributes  of  perfection,  beauty,  and  glory  of  that  All-Glorious  One. 
And  they  prove  the  faultless,  ﬂawless  perfection  of  the  divine  essence. 

346

THE WORDS

For it is obvious that perfection in a work points to the perfection of the act 
which is the source and origin of the work. And the perfection of the act 
points to the perfection of the name, and the perfection of the name, to the 
perfection of the attribute, and perfection of the attribute to the perfection of 
the essential qualities, and the perfection of the qualities point necessarily 
and self-evidently to the perfection of the essence possessing those qualities. 
For example, the perfect inscriptions and adornments of a faultless pal-
ace indicate the perfection of a master builder’s acts behind them. And the 
perfection of the acts shows the perfection of that active master’s titles and 
names,  which  demonstrate  his  rank.  And  the  perfection  of  the  names  and 
titles show the perfection of the other attributes qualifying the master build-
er’s art. And the perfection of the art and attributes show the perfection of 
the abilities and essential capacity of that craftsman, which are called the 
essential qualities. And the perfection of those essential qualities and abili-
ties show the perfection of the master’s essential nature.

In exactly the same way, the faultless works observed in the world, which 
manifest  the  meaning  of  ( 67:3 ) K J I H  this  art  in  the  well-ordered 
beings of the universe, point observedly to the perfect acts of an active pos-
sessor of power. And the perfect acts point clearly to the perfect names of 
a Glorious Agent. And the perfection necessarily points and testiﬁes to the 
perfect  attributes  of  the  Beauteous  One  signiﬁed  by  the  names.  And  cer-
tainly the perfect attributes point and testify to the perfection of the Perfect 
One qualiﬁed by the attributes. And those perfect qualities point with such 
absolute certainty to the perfect essence of the One possessing the qualities 
that they indicate that all the sorts of perfection to be seen in the entire uni-
verse are but signs of His perfections, hints of His glory, and allusions to His 
beauty, and pale, weak shadows in relation to His perfection.

THE ELEVENTH FLASH, WHICH HAS THE STRENGTH OF SUNS
As is deﬁned in the Nineteenth Word, our master Muhammad the Trust-
worthy  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  is  the  supreme  sign  of  the 
mighty book of the universe and the greatest name of that mighty Qur’an, 
the seed of the tree of the universe and its most luminous fruit, the sun of 
the  palace  of  the  world  and  the  radiant  moon  of  the  world  of  Islam,  the 
herald  of  the  sovereignty  of  divine  dominicality,  and  the  wise  discloser 
of the  talisman of the universe, who ﬂies in the levels of reality with the 
wings  of  messengership,  which  take  under  their  shade  all  the  prophets,

and the wings of Islam, which take under their protection all the world of 
Islam; who took behind him all the prophets and messengers, all the saints 
and  veracious  ones,  all  the  puriﬁed  and  the  scholars,  and  demonstrated 
divine unity with all his strength and opened up the way to divine oneness. 
Has any doubt or suspicion, then, the power to conceal or obscure the belief 
in Allah which he demonstrated or the divine unity which he proved? In 
the Nineteenth Word and Nineteenth Letter we have deﬁned and described 
brieﬂy and to a small degree in Fourteen Droplets and Nineteen Signs from 
the water of life of that Clear Proof’s knowledge that miracle-displaying 
Being together with his various miracles. Here we shall therefore content 
ourselves with this indication and conclude with a benediction for him that 
indicates fundaments which commend that decisive proof of divine unity 
and testify to his truthfulness:

Twelfth Flash

THE TWELFTH FLASH, WHICH HAS THE STRENGTH OF SUNS

This  Twelfth  Flash  of  the  Twenty-Second  Word  is  such  an  ocean  of 
truths that all the previous twenty-two Words form only twenty-two droplets 
of it, and it is a source of such lights that they form only twenty-two ﬂashes 
of that Sun. Yes, the previous twenty-two Words are all ﬂashes of the stars 
of the verses shining in the skies of the Qur’an; all are single droplets from 
the river of a verse ﬂowing from that ocean of discernment distinguishing 
truth and falsehood; each is but one pearl from a single of its verses, all of 
which are chests of jewels in the sublime treasury of Allah’s Book. Thus, 
the Word of Allah, which is in small part deﬁned in the Fourteenth Droplet 
of the Nineteenth Word, has been revealed from the greatest name, the sub-
lime throne, and the greatest manifestation of dominicality, and it repeatedly 
states with all its strength within a breadth and elevatedness that binds pre-
eternity to post-eternity and ties the ground to the divine throne, and with the 
َ(cid:202) it calls the whole universe to witness and 

certainty of all its verses: ُ
makes it testify. Yes,

If you look at the Qur’an with the eyes of a sound heart, you will see 
that its six aspects are so brilliant and transparent that no darkness, no mis-
guidance, no doubt or suspicion, no trickery could enter it or ﬁnd a ﬁssure 
through which to enter and violate its purity. For above it is the stamp of 
miraculousness; beneath it, proof and evidence; behind it, its point of sup-
port, pure dominical revelation; before it, the happiness of this world and

the next; on its right, questioning the reason and ensuring its conﬁrmation; 
on its left, calling on the conscience to witness and securing its submission; 
within it is self-evidently the pure guidance of the Most Merciful; its outside 
observedly consists of the lights of belief; and its fruits, with all certainty 
the puriﬁed and veracious scholars and saints, who are adorned with all the 
human perfections and attainments. If you fasten your ear to the breast of 
that tongue of the Unseen, you will hear from afar a most familiar and con-
vincing,  an  inﬁnitely  serious  and  elevated  heavenly  voice  equipped  with 
proof which repeats َوُ(cid:182)  َ
َ(cid:202)  It states this so certainly it is at the degree of 
absolute certainty, and illuminates you with a knowledge of certainty resem-
bling the vision of certainty.

I n   S h o r t :  Both Allah’s Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-
ings  and  peace )  and  the  Decisive  Criterion  of  Truth  and  Falsehood  were 
suns. One, the tongue of the Manifest World, pointing with the ﬁngers of 
Islam  and  messengership  and  conﬁrmed  by  all  the  prophets  and  puriﬁed 
ones supported by a thousand miracles, demonstrated this truth with all his 
strength.

And the other, like the tongue of the World of the Unseen, indicates the 
same truth with the ﬁngers of truth and justice and guidance under the con-
ﬁrmation of all the creational signs in the universe within forty aspects of 
miraculousness, and demonstrates it with all seriousness. Is that truth then 
not clearer than the sun and more brilliant than sunlight?

Oh,  obdurate  little  man  sunk  in  misguidance!  1  How  can  you  oppose 
these  suns  with  the  lamp  of  your  head,  dimmer  than  a  ﬁreﬂy?  How  can 
you show disdain for them? Are you trying to extinguish them by pufﬁng? 
Pooh  to  your  denying  mind!  How  can  you  deny  the  words  and  claims 
which those two tongues of the Manifest and Unseen Worlds speak in the 
name of the Sustainer of All the Worlds and Owner of the Universe; which 
they speak on His behalf? Oh, you wretch, lower and more impotent than 
a ﬂy! Who are you that you attempt to give the lie to the universe’s Glori-
ous Owner?

First Chapter 

We shall explain in ﬁve points only ﬁve of the virtues of 
belief out of thousands.

First Point

FIRST POINT

Through  the  light  of  belief,  man  rises  to  the  highest  of  the  high  and 
acquires a value worthy of Paradise, while through the darkness of unbelief, 
he descends to the lowest of the low and falls to a position ﬁt for Hell. For 
belief connects man to the All-Glorious Maker; it is a relation. Thus, man 
acquires value by virtue of the divine art and inscriptions of the dominical 
names which become apparent in him through belief. Unbelief severs the 
relation and due to that severance the dominical art is concealed. His value 
then is only in respect to the matter of his physical being. And since this mat-
ter has only a transitory, passing, temporary animal life, its value is virtually 
nothing. We shall explain this mystery by means of a comparison.

For example: among man’s arts, the value of the materials used and that 
of  the  art  are  entirely  different.  Sometimes  they  are  equal,  sometimes  the 
material is more valuable, and sometimes it happens that ﬁve  l i r a s ’  worth 

351

352

THE WORDS

of  art  is  to  be  found  in  material  like  iron  worth  ﬁve  k u r u s h .  Sometimes, 
even, an antique work of art is worth a million while the material of which 
it is composed is not worth ﬁve k u r u s h . If such a work of art is taken to the  
antiques market and ascribed to a brilliant and accomplished artist of former 
times, and announced mentioning the artist and that art, it may be sold for 
a  million  l i r a s .  Whereas  if  it  is  taken  to  the  scrap  dealers,  the  only  price 
received will be for the ﬁve k u r u s h ’s worth of iron.

Thus, man is such an antique work of art of Almighty Allah. He is a 
most subtle and graceful miracle of His power whom He created to mani-
fest all His names and their inscriptions, in the form of a miniature speci-
men of the universe. If the light of belief enters his being, all the meaning-
ful inscriptions on him may be read. As one who believes, he reads them 
consciously, and through that relation, causes others to read them. That is 
to say, the dominical art in man becomes apparent through meanings like, 
“ I am the creature and artefact of the All-Glorious Maker. I manifest His 
mercy and muniﬁcence. ” That is, belief, which consists of being connected 
to the Maker, makes apparent all the works of art in man. Man’s value is 
in accordance with the dominical art and by virtue of being a mirror to the 
Eternally Besought One. In this respect insigniﬁcant man becomes Allah’s 
addressee and a guest of the Sustainer worthy of Paradise, superior to all 
other creatures.

However, should unbelief, which consists of the severance of the rela-
tion, enter man’s being, then all those meaningful inscriptions of the divine 
names are plunged into darkness and become illegible. For if the Maker is 
forgotten,  the  spiritual  aspects  which  look  to  Him  are  not  comprehended, 
they are as though reversed. The majority of those meaningful sublime arts 
and elevated inscriptions are hidden. The remainder, those that may be seen 
with  the  eye,  are  attributed  to  lowly  causes,  nature,  and  chance,  and  will 
become utterly devoid of value. While they are all brilliant diamonds, they 
become dull pieces of glass. His importance looks only to his animal, physi-
cal being. And as we said, the aim and fruit of his physical being is only to 
pass a brief and partial life as the most impotent, needy, and grieving of ani-
mals. Then it decays and departs. See how unbelief destroys human nature 
and transforms it from diamonds into coal.

Second Point

SECOND POINT

Just as belief is a light which illuminates man and makes legible all the 
missives of the Eternally Besought One inscribed upon him, so too it illu-
minates  the  universe  and  delivers  the  past  and  the  future  from  darkness. 

TWENTY-THIRD WORD – FIRST CHAPTER

353

I shall explain this mystery with a comparison I saw during a vision, which 
concerns one meaning of the verse:

 ( 2:257 )  ) ( ' & % $ # " ! 

It was like this:

I saw in a vision an awesome bridge built between two high mountains 
situated  opposite  one  another.  Beneath  the  bridge  was  a  valley  of  great 
depth. I was on the bridge. A dense darkness had enveloped every part of 
the world. I looked to my right and saw a vast grave swathed in an unending 
dense gloom, that is, I imagined it. I looked to my left and as though saw 
violent storms and calamities gathering amid terrifying waves of blackness. 
I looked beneath the bridge and imagined I saw a profound abyss. I had a 
dim torch in the face of this terrifying darkness. I used it and could see a 
little with its light. A truly horriﬁc situation appeared to me. In fact, such 
awful dragons, lions, and monsters appeared around me and on the bridge in 
front of me I wished I had no torch and had not witnessed those horrifying 
things. Whichever way I shone it, I felt the same horror. I exclaimed: “ This 
torch brings me only trouble! ” and I angrily cast it to the ground and broke 
it.  Then  on  smashing  it,  the  darkness  suddenly  dispersed  as  though  I  had 
turned on the switch for a huge electric lamp that lit up the whole world. 
Everywhere was ﬁlled with the lamp’s light. It showed everything as it was 
in reality. 

I saw that the bridge I had seen was a highway through a plain passing 
over even ground. The vast grave I had seen on my right I realized consisted 
from top to bottom of beautiful, verdant gardens and gatherings for worship, 
service, conversation, and the remembrance of Allah under the direction of 
luminous men. The precipices and peaks on my left which I had imagined 
to be tempestuous and stormy I now saw ﬂeetingly to be a vast, lovely, and 
elevated place of feasting, recreation, and enjoyment behind mountains that 
were adorned and pleasant. And the creatures I had thought to be terrifying 
monsters  and  dragons,  I  saw  were  familiar  domestic  animals  like  camels, 
ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا  I  recited  the 
oxen,  sheep,  and  goats.  Declaring,  ِنا َ(cid:175)ـ(cid:192)ِ
verse, 

ْ(cid:202)ا ِرُو(cid:178) ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) ِ

 ) ( ' & % $ # " ! 

and I awoke from my vision.

Thus,  the  two  mountains  were  the  beginning  and  end  of  life;  that  is, 
this  world  and  the  Intermediate  Realm.  The  bridge  was  the  road  of  life. 

ٰ
ّ
354

THE WORDS

To the right was the past, and to the left, the future. As for the small torch, it 
was the human ego, which is egotistical, relies on what it knows, and does 
not heed the heavenly Revelation. The things imagined to be monsters were 
the events and strange creatures of the world. 

Thus, one who relies on his ego, who falls into the darkness of heedless-
ness and is afﬂicted with the blackness of misguidance resembles my ﬁrst 
state in the vision, which, like with the pocket-torch and due to deﬁcient and 
misguided knowledge, saw the past in the form a huge grave amid darkness 
imbued with non-existence. It showed the future to be a stormy and desolate 
wasteland  governed  by  coincidence,  and  events  and  beings,  which  are  all 
submissive  ofﬁcials  of  One  All-Wise  and  All-Compassionate  to  be  mon-
sters. Such a person as though manifests the verse,

( 2:257 ) 3 2 1 0 / . - , + 
But if such a man attains to divine guidance and belief enters his heart, 
and if the tyranny of his soul is smashed and he heeds Allah’s Book, he will 
resemble my second state in the vision. Then the universe will suddenly take 
on the colour of day and be ﬁlled with divine light. The world will recite the 
verse,

( 24:35 ) | { z y
Then he will see with the eye of the heart that the past is not a vast grave, 
but where the groups of puriﬁed spirits who each century having performed 
their duties of worship under the leadership of a prophet or saint exclaim, 
ّ(cid:195)َا  on  completion  of  the  duties  of  their  lives,  and  ﬂy  to  elevated 
ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ
abodes, moving on to the future. He will look to the left, and through the 
light of belief distinguish in the distance a feasting-place of the Most Merci-
ful set up in palaces of bliss in the gardens of Paradise, beyond the moun-
tainous  revolutions  of  the  Intermediate  Realm  and  the  hereafter.  And  he 
will realize that the storms and earthquakes and tempestuous events are all 
submissive ofﬁcials, and understand that they are the means for instances 
of wisdom which though apparently harsh are in fact most gentle, like the 
storms and rains of spring. He will even see death to be the introduction to 
eternal life, and the grave, the door to everlasting happiness. You can deduce 
further aspects for yourself. Apply the reality to the comparison!

Third Point

ٰ
TWENTY-THIRD WORD – FIRST CHAPTER

355

THIRD POINT

Belief is both light and strength. Yes, one who acquires true belief may 
challenge the whole universe and be saved from the pressure of events in 

ّ(cid:195)ا ىَ(cid:171)َ(cid:150)  ُتْ(cid:171) َ

accordance with the strength of his belief. Saying, ِ
ﯯﯦَوَ(cid:98) he trav-
els through the mountainous waves of events in the ship of life in complete 
safety. He entrusts all his burdens to the hand of power of the Absolutely 
Powerful One, voyages through the world in ease, then takes his rest in the 
Intermediate Realm. Later he may ﬂy up to Paradise in order to enter eternal 
happiness. Otherwise, if he does not rely on Allah,  rather than ﬂying, the 
burdens of the world will drag him down to the lowest of the low. That is 
to say, belief necessitates afﬁrmation of divine unity, afﬁrmation of divine 
unity necessitates submission to Allah, submission to Allah necessitates reli-
ance on Allah, and reliance on Allah necessarily leads to happiness in this 
world and the next. But do not misunderstand this, reliance on Allah is not 
to reject causes altogether; it is rather to know that causes are a veil to the 
hand of power and have recourse to them. Knowing that attempting causes 
is a sort of active prayer, it is to seek the effects only from Almighty Allah, 
recognize that the results are from Him alone, and to be thankful to Him.

Those who place their trust in Allah and those who do not, resemble the 

two men in this story:

One time two men loaded heavy burdens onto both their backs and heads, 
and buying tickets, boarded a large ship. As soon as they boarded it, one of 
them left his load on the deck and sitting on it guarded it. The other, how-
ever, since he was both stupid and arrogant, did not put down his load. When 
he was told: “ Leave that heavy load on the deck and be comfortable, ” he 
replied: “ No, I won’t put it down, it might get lost. I am strong, I’ll guard 
my property by carrying it on my head and back. ” He was told again: “ This 
reliable royal ship which is carrying you and us is stronger, it can protect it 
better than you. You may get giddy and fall into the sea together with your 
load. Anyway you will gradually lose your strength, and by degrees those 
loads will get heavier and your bent back and brainless head will not have 
the  power  to  bear  them.  And  if  the  captain  sees  you  in  this  state,  he  will 
either say that you are crazy and expel you from the ship, or he will think 
you are ungrateful, accusing our ship and jeering at us, and he will order 
you to be put into prison. Also you are making a fool of yourself in front of 
everyone. For the perceptive see that you are displaying weakness through 
your conceit, impotence through your pride, and abasement and hypocrisy 

ٰ
356

THE WORDS

through your pretence, and have thus made yourself a laughing stock in the 
eyes of the people. Everyone’s laughing at you. ” Whereupon the unfortu-
nate man came to his senses. He put down his load on the deck and sat on it. 
He said to the other: “ Ah! May Allah be pleased with you. I’ve been saved 
from that difﬁculty, from prison, and from making a fool of myself. ”

O  man  who  does  not  place  his  trust  in  Allah!  You  too  come  to  your 
senses like that man and place your trust in Him, so that you may be deliv-
ered  from  begging  before  all  the  universe,  trembling  before  every  event, 
from pride, making a fool of yourself, misery in the hereafter, and the prison 
of the pressures of this world.

Fourth Point

FOURTH POINT

Belief makes human beings into human beings, indeed, it makes them 
into kings. Since this is so, their basic duty is belief and supplication. Unbe-
lief makes them into extremely impotent beasts.

Out of thousands of proofs of this matter, the differences in the ways 
animals and man come into the world are a clear indication and decisive 
proof.  Yes,  these  differences  show  that  humanity  becomes  humanity 
through  belief.  For  when  animals  come  into  the  world,  they  come  com-
plete in all points in accordance with their abilities as though having been 
perfected in another world; that is, they are sent. They learn all the condi-
tions of their lives, their relationships with the universe, and the laws of 
life in either two hours or two days or two months, and become proﬁcient 
in them. Animals like sparrows and bees acquire in twenty days the power 
to survive and proﬁciency in their actions that man only acquires in twenty 
years; that is, they are inspired with them. This means that the animals’ 
fundamental duty is not to be perfected through learning and progress by 
acquiring knowledge, nor to seek help and offer supplications through dis-
playing their impotence, but in accordance with their abilities to work and 
act. Their duty is active worship.

As for man, he needs to learn everything when he comes into the world; 
he is ignorant and cannot even learn completely the conditions of life in 
twenty  years.  Indeed,  he  needs  to  go  on  learning  till  the  end  of  his  life. 
Also he is sent to the world in a most weak and impotent form, and can 
only rise to his feet in one or two years. Only in ﬁfteen years can he distin-
guish between harm and beneﬁt, and with the help of humankind’s experi-
ence attract things advantageous to him and avoid others that are harmful. 
This means that man’s innate duty is to be perfected through learning and 

TWENTY-THIRD WORD – FIRST CHAPTER

357

to proclaim his worship of Allah and servitude to Him through supplica-
tion. That is to say, it is to know the answers of the questions: “ Through 
whose compassion is my life so wisely administered in this way? Through 
whose generosity am I so kindly raised? Through whose graciousness am 
I so delicately nurtured and ministered to? ” It is to beseech and supplicate 
the Provider of Needs through the tongue of impotence and poverty since 
he cannot himself meet even a thousandth of his needs; it is to seek from 
Him. It is to ﬂy to the high station of worship and servitude to Allah on the 
wings of impotence and poverty.

This  means  that  man  came  to  this  world  to  be  perfected  by  means  of 
knowledge and supplication. In regard to his nature and abilities everything 
is tied to knowledge. And the foundation, source, light, and spirit of all true  
knowledge is knowledge of Allah, and its essence and basis is belief in Allah.
Furthermore,  since  man  is  subject  to  endless  tribulations  and  afﬂicted 
with  innumerable  enemies  despite  his  boundless  impotence,  and  suffers 
from endless needs and has innumerable desires despite his boundless pov-
erty,  after  belief,  his  fundamental  innate  duty  is  supplication.  As  for  sup-
plication, it is the basis of worship of Allah and servitude to Him. In order 
to  secure  a  desire  or  wish  he  cannot  obtain,  a  child  will  either  cry  or  ask 
for it, that is, he will supplicate through the tongue of his impotence either 
actively or verbally, and will be successful in securing it. In the same way, 
man is like a delicate, petted child in the world of living creatures. He has 
to either weep at the court of the Most Merciful and Compassionate through 
his weakness and impotence, or supplicate through his poverty and need, so 
that the things he wants may be made subject to him, or he may offer thanks 
for their being made so. Otherwise like a silly child who creates a fuss over 
a ﬂy, he displays ingratitude for the bounties saying: “ With my own strength 
I subjugate things it is not possible to subjugate and things a thousand times 
more powerful, and I make them obey me through my own ideas and meas-
ures. ” Just as this is contrary to man’s innate nature, so he makes himself 
deserving of severe punishment.

Belief  necessitates  supplication  as  a  certain  means  of  securing  needs. 
Both human nature has an intense desire for it, and Almighty Allah decrees,
( 25:77 ) » º ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´
which has the meaning of: What importance would you have if you did not 
offer Me supplications? He also commands:

358

THE WORDS

( 40:60 )  1 0 /
I f   y o u   s a y :  We frequently offer supplications, but they are not accepted. 

But the verse is general, it states that every supplication is answered.

T h e   A n s w e r :  To answer is one thing, to accept is something quite dif-
ferent. Every supplication is answered, but its being accepted and exactly 
what  was  sought  being  given  is  dependent  on  Almighty  Allah’s  wisdom. 
For example, if a sick child calls the doctor, saying: “ Doctor! Doctor! ”, and 
he replies: “ Here I am, what do you want? ”, and the child says: “ Give me 
that medicine! ”, the doctor will either give him exactly what he asks for or 
something better and more beneﬁcial for him. Or knowing that medicine is 
harmful for his illness, he will give him nothing. 

Thus, since Almighty Allah is all-present and all-seeing, He responds to 
the supplications of His servants. Through His presence and response, He 
transforms the desolation of loneliness and solitude into familiarity. But He 
does  this  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  dominical  wisdom,  not 
in  accordance  with  man’s  capricious  and  importunate  demands;  He  gives 
either what is sought or what is better than it, or He gives nothing at all.

Also, supplication is a form of worship and recognition of human servi-
tude to Allah. The fruits of this pertain to the hereafter. The aims pertain-
ing to this world are the occasions of a particular sort of supplication and 
worship. For example, the prayers and supplications for rain are a form of 
worship. Drought is the occasion for such worship. Worship and supplica-
tions of this sort are not in order to bring rain. If they are performed with that 
intention alone they are not worthy of acceptance, for they are not sincere 
worship. Sunset is the time of the evening prayers. And eclipses of the sun 
and moon are the times of two particular prayers known as  ṣ a l ā t   a l - k u s ū f  
a n d   ṣ a l ā t   a l - k h u s ū f .  That  is  to  say,  with  the  veiling  of  the  two  luminous 
signs  of  the  night  and  day,  Allah’s  tremendousness  is  proclaimed  so  He 
calls his servants to a sort of worship at those times. The prayers are not so 
that the sun and moon will be revealed ( whose appearance and how long the 
eclipses will continue have anyway been reckoned by astronomers ).

In just the same way, drought is the time for the prayers for rain, and the 
visitation of calamities and inﬂiction of harmful things the times of certain 
supplications when man realizes his impotence and through his supplication 
and entreaty seeks refuge at the court of One Possessing Absolute Power. 
Even if the calamities are not lifted despite many supplications, it may not 
be said that they were not accepted. It should rather be said that the time for 

TWENTY-THIRD WORD – FIRST CHAPTER

359

the supplication is not yet over. If through His graciousness and muniﬁcence 
Almighty Allah removes the calamity, light upon light, then the time for that 
supplication is over and done with. That is to say, supplication has the mean-
ing of worship and man’s acknowledging his servitude to Allah.

As for worship and servitude to Allah, it should be purely and sincerely 
for Allah’s sake. Man should only proclaim his impotence and seek refuge 
with Him through supplication, he should not interfere in His dominicality. 
He should leave the taking of measures to Him and rely on His wisdom. He 
should not accuse His mercy. 

Indeed, what is in reality established by the Qur’an’s clear verses is that 
just as all beings offer their own particular gloriﬁcation and worship, so it 
is supplication that rises to the divine court from all the universe. This is 
either through the tongue of innate ability like the supplication of plants  and 
animals through which they seek their forms from the Absolute Bestower 
and to display and manifest His names. Or it is through the tongue of innate 
need. These are the supplications for all their essential needs – beyond their 
power to obtain – offered by animate beings. Through this tongue, the ani-
mate beings seek certain things from the Absolutely Generous One for the 
continuance  of  their  lives,  like  a  sort  of  sustenance.  Or  it  is  supplication 
through the tongue of exigency, through which all beings with spirits who 
ﬁnd themselves in some plight or predicament make supplication and seek 
urgent refuge with an unknown protector; indeed, they turn to the All-Com-
passionate  Sustainer.  If  there  is  nothing  to  prevent  it,  these  three  sorts  of 
supplication are always accepted.

The  fourth  sort  of  supplication  is  the  most  well-known;  it  is  our  sup-
plication. This too is of two sorts: one is active and by disposition, and the 
other,  verbal  and  with  the  heart.  For  example,  having  recourse  to  causes 
is an active prayer. To gather together causes is not in order to create the 
effect, but through the tongue of disposition to take up an acceptable posi-
tion in order to seek the effect from Almighty Allah. To plough a ﬁeld is to 
knock at the door of the treasury of mercy. Since this sort of active supplica-
tion is directed towards the Absolutely Generous One’s name and title, it is 
accepted in the great majority of cases.

The second sort is to offer supplication with the tongue and the heart. It 
is to seek certain wishes which the hand cannot reach. The most important 
aspect, the most beautiful aim, the sweetest fruit of this is this: “ The person 
who  offers  the  supplications  knows  that  there  is  someone  who  hears  the 
wishes of his heart, whose hand can reach all things, who can bring about 
each of his desires, who takes pity on his impotence, and answers his need. ”

O  impotent,  indigent  man!  Do  not  neglect  a  means  like  supplication

Including Five Remarks With Respect to
Human Happiness and Misery 

[ Since man has been created on the most excellent of patterns and has 
been given comprehensive abilities, he has been cast into an arena of 
trial  and  examination  in  which  he  may  rise  or  fall  to  stations,  ranks, 
and degrees from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high, from 
the earth to the divine throne, and from minute particles to the sun. He 
has been sent to this world as a miracle of divine power, the result of 
creation,  and  a  wonder  of  divine  art  before  whom  have  been  opened 
two roads leading to either inﬁnite ascent or inﬁnite descent. We shall 
explain  the  mystery  of  this  awesome  human  progress  and  decline  in 
ﬁve remarks. ]

First Remark

FIRST REMARK

Man stands in need of most of the varieties of beings in the universe and 
is connected to them. His needs spread through every part of the world and 
his desires extend to eternity. As he wants a ﬂower, so he wants the spring. 
As he desires a garden, so does he desire everlasting Paradise. As he longs 
to see a friend, so does he long to see the All-Beauteous One of Glory. Just 
as in order to visit a person he loves who lives somewhere else, he is in need 
for his beloved’s door to be opened to him, so too in order to visit the ninety-
nine per cent of his friends who have travelled to the Intermediate Realm 
and so be saved from eternal separation, he needs to seek refuge at the court 
of an Absolutely Powerful One. For it is He Who will close the door of this 
huge  world  and  open  the  door  of  the  hereafter,  which  is  an  exhibition  of 
wonders, remove this world and establish the hereafter in its place.

Thus for man in this position the only true object of worship will be one 
in whose hand are the reins of all things, with whom are the treasuries of all 
things, who sees all things, and is present everywhere, who is beyond space, 
exempt from impotence, free of fault, and far above all defect; an All-Pow-
erful One of Glory, an All-Compassionate One of Beauty, an All-Wise One 
of Perfection. For only one possessing inﬁnite power and all-encompassing 
knowledge can meet man’s endless needs. In which case, He is the only one 
worthy of worship.

THE WORDS

O man, if you are the slave of Him alone, you will earn a place superior 
to all creatures. But if you hold back from this servitude to Him, you will 
become an abased slave to impotent creatures. If you rely on your ego and 
own power and abandoning reliance on Allah and supplication, deviate into 
pride and boasting, then you will fall lower than an ant or bee in regard to 
goodness and creation, and become weaker than a spider or a ﬂy. You will 
become heavier than a mountain in regard to evil and destruction, and more 
harmful than a pestilence.

Yes, O man! You have two aspects: one is that of creation, good, acts, 
and  positivity.  The  other  is  the  aspect  of  destruction,  non-existence,  evil, 
negativity, and passivity. In regard to the ﬁrst aspect, you are lower than a 
bee or sparrow, and weaker than a spider or ﬂy. Whereas in regard to the 
second aspect, you surpass the mountains, earth, and skies; you take on a 
burden before which they expressed their impotence and from which they 
shrank, and you assume a sphere more extensive and vaster than them. For 
when you create and do good, you can do so only to the extent of your own 
power and strength and to the degree your hand can reach. But when you 
commit evil and destruction, then your evil overwhelms and your destruc-
tion spreads.

For example, unbelief is an evil, a destruction, an absence of afﬁrmation. 
But  that  single  evil  comprises  insulting  the  whole  universe,  belittling  all 
the divine names, and abusing all humanity. For these beings have elevated 
positions and important duties; they are dominical missives, divine mirrors, 
and divine ofﬁcials. But unbelief dismisses them from the rank at which they 
are mirrors, ofﬁcials charged with duties, and bear meanings, and reduces 
them to the level of futility and being the playthings of chance. Due to the 
destruction of death and separation, it lowers them to the degree of being 
swiftly decaying ephemeral matter lacking all importance and value, to being 
nothing. So too due to denial it insults the divine names, the inscriptions, 
manifestations, and beauties of which are to be seen throughout the universe 
and in the mirrors of beings. And it casts down to a position more abased 
and weaker, more powerless and needy than the lowliest ephemeral animal 
the being who holds the rank of vicegerent of the earth, known as man. For 
man is a well-composed ode of wisdom proclaiming the manifestations of 
the  sacred  divine  names,  and  is  a  seed-like  self-evident  miracle  of  divine 
power containing all the members of an eternal tree, and who, by assuming 
the Supreme Trust, rose to being higher than the earth, sky and mountains 
and gained superiority over the angels. It  reduces him to the level of being 
a common signboard lacking all meaning, confused, and swiftly decaying.

TWENTY-THIRD WORD – SECOND CHAPTER

363

I n   S h o r t :   In  regard  to  destruction  and  evil,  the  evil-commanding  soul 
may commit inﬁnite crimes, but concerning creativity and good, its power 
is extremely little and partial. Yes, he may destroy a house in one day, while 
it cannot be built in a hundred. However, if the soul gives up egoism and 
seeks good and existence from divine assistance, and if it foregoes evil and 
destruction and reliance on the soul, and seeking forgiveness becomes a true 
slave of Allah, then it will manifest the meaning of the verse,

( 25:70 ) M L K J
Its inﬁnite capacity for evil will be transformed into an inﬁnite capacity for 
good. It will acquire the value of the Most Excellent of Patterns and ascend 
to the highest of the high.

O  heedless  man!  See  Almighty  Allah’s  muniﬁcence  and  generosity! 
Although it would be justice to record one evil as a thousand and a single 
good deed as one or not at all, He records a single evil as one, and a single 
good deed as ten, and sometimes as seventy or seven hundred, or even some-
times as seven thousand. You will also understand from this Remark that 
to be sent to Hell, which is so dreadful, is retribution for the deed and pure 
justice, while to be sent to Paradise is pure generosity.

Second Remark

SECOND REMARK

Man  has  two  faces:  one,  concerning  his  ego,  looks  to  the  life  of  this 
world. The other, concerning worship and servitude to Allah, looks to eter-
nal life. In respect to the ﬁrst face he is a wretched creature whose capital 
consists only of the following: of will he has only a partial power of choice 
like a hair; of power, a weak ability to acquire; of life, a fast dying ﬂame; of 
a lifespan, a ﬂeeting brief spell; and of being, a swiftly decaying small body. 
Together with this, he is one delicate, weak individual out of the innumer-
able individuals of the numberless varieties of beings dispersed through the 
levels of the universe.

In respect of the second face and especially his impotence and poverty, 
which  are  turned  towards  worship,  man  has  truly  great  breadth  and  vast 
importance. For the All-Wise Creator has included in man’s nature an inﬁ-
nitely  vast  impotence  and  boundlessly  huge  poverty  so  that  he  can  be  an 
extensive mirror containing the innumerable manifestations of an All-Pow-
erful and Compassionate One Whose power is inﬁnite, an All-Generous All-
Rich One Whose wealth is boundless.

Indeed,  man  resembles  a  seed.  This  seed  has  been  given  signiﬁcant  
immaterial members by divine power and a subtle, valuable programme by 

364

THE WORDS

divine determining, so that it may work beneath the ground, and emerging 
from that narrow world, enter the broad world of the air, and asking its Crea-
tor with the tongue of its disposition to be a tree, ﬁnd a perfection worthy of 
it. If, due to bad temperament, the seed uses the immaterial members given 
it in attracting certain harmful substances under the ground, in a short time 
it  will  rot  and  decay  in  that  narrow  place  without  beneﬁt.  But  if  the  seed 
conforms to the creational command of,

( 6:95 ) & % $ 
and employs well those immaterial members, it will emerge from that nar-
row world, and through becoming a large fruit-bearing tree, its tiny particu-
lar reality and its spirit will take on the form of an extensive universal reality.
Similarly,  signiﬁcant  members  and  valuable  programmes  have  been 
deposited  in  man’s  nature  by  divine  power  and  determining.  If  man  uses 
those immaterial members on the desires of his soul and on trivial pleasures 
under the soil of worldly life in the narrow conﬁnes of this earthly world, 
he  will  decay  and  decompose  in  the  midst  of  difﬁculties  in  a  brief  life  in 
a  constricted  place  like  the  rotted  seed,  and  load  the  responsibility  on  his 
unfortunate spirit, then depart from this world.

If, however, he nurtures the seed of his abilities with the water of Islam 
and  light  of  belief  under  the  soil  of  worship  and  servitude  to  Allah,  con-
forms to the commands of the Qur’an, and turns his faculties towards their 
true aims, they will produce branches and buds in the World of Similitudes 
and the Intermediate Realm; he will be a seed of great value and a shining 
machine containing the members of an everlasting tree and permanent truth 
which will be the means to innumerable perfections and bounties in Para-
dise. And he will be a blessed and luminous fruit of the tree of the universe.
Yes, true progress is to turn the faces of the heart, spirit, intellect, and 
even the imagination and other subtle faculties given to man towards eternal 
life and for each to be occupied with the particular duty of worship worthy 
of it. Progress is not as the people of misguidance imagine, to plunge into 
the life of this world in all its minute details and in order to taste every sort 
of pleasure, even the basest, make subject to the evil-commanding soul all 
the subtle faculties and the heart and intellect, and make them assist it; to do 
this is not progress, it is decline. I saw this fact in a vision which is described 
in the following comparison:

I  was  entering  a  large  town  when  I  looked  and  saw  that  it  was  full  of  
large palaces. At the doors of some of these palaces was brilliant theatre-like 

TWENTY-THIRD WORD – SECOND CHAPTER

365

merrymaking; it captured and held everyone’s attention and was entertain-
ing them. I looked carefully and saw that the lord of one of the palaces had 
come to the door; he was playing with a dog and assisting the merrymak-
ing.  The  ladies  were  indulging  in  sweet  conversation  with  ill-mannered 
youths.  Grown-up  girls  were  organizing  the  children’s  games.  And  the 
doorkeeper  had  assumed  the  role  of  directing  the  others.  I  then  realized 
that  inside,  the  huge  palace  was  completely  empty.  Its  reﬁned  duties  all 
remained  undone.  Its  inhabitants’  morals  had  declined  so  that  they  had 
taken on these roles at the door.

I passed on until I came to another large palace. I saw that there was a 
faithful dog stretched out at the door and a stern, taciturn doorkeeper; it had 
an undistinguished appearance. I was curious: why was the other the way it 
was and this palace like this? I went inside. Then I saw that the inside was 
very merry. Apartment over apartment, the people of the palace were busy 
with their various reﬁned duties. The men in the ﬁrst apartment were over-
seeing the administration and running of the palace. In the apartment over 
that, girls were teaching the children. Above that the ladies were occupied 
with ﬁne arts and beautiful embroideries. And on the top ﬂoor, the lord was 
exchanging news with the king, and was busy with his own elevated duties 
in order to maintain the peoples’ tranquillity and his own attainments and 
progress. They did not stop me since I was not visible to them, and I was 
able to wander around. Then I came out and looked around: everywhere in 
the town were these two sorts of palaces. I asked about this and they told me: 
“ The palaces where there is merrymaking at the door and whose insides are 
empty belong to the foremost of the unbelievers and people of misguidance. 
The others belong to honourable Muslim notables. ” Then in one corner I 
came across a palace on which was written my name, SAID. I was curious. I 
looked more closely and as though saw my image on it. Calling out in utter 
bewilderment, I came to my senses and awoke.

Now I shall interpret the vision for you. May Allah cause good to come 

of it.

The town was human social life and the city of human civilization. Each 
of the palaces was a human being. The people of the palaces were the sub-
tle  human  faculties  like  the  eyes,  ears,  heart,  inner  heart,  spirit,  intellect, 
and things like the soul and caprice, and powers of lust and anger. Each of 
the  faculties  has  a  different  duty  of  worship,  and  different  pleasures  and 
pains.  The  soul  and  caprice  and  powers  of  lust  and  anger  are  represented 
by the doorkeeper and the dog. So to subject the elevated subtle faculties to  

366

THE WORDS

the soul and caprice and make them forget their essential duties is certainly 
decline and not progress. You can interpret the rest for yourself.

Third Remark

THIRD REMARK

In regard to his acts and deeds and his labour man is a weak animal, an 
powerless creature. The extent of his power of disposal and ownership in 
this respect is so narrow that it is no greater than as far as his hand can reach. 
Domestic animals, even, the reins of which have been given to man, have 
each taken a share of his weakness, impotence, and laziness, so that if they 
are  compared  with  their  wild  counterparts,  a  great  difference  is  apparent. 
( Like domestic goats and cattle, and wild goats and cattle ). But in regard to 
passivity, acceptance, supplication, and entreaty, man is an honoured travel-
ler in this hostel of the world. He is the guest of one so generous that inﬁnite 
treasuries of mercy have been opened to him and innumerable unique beings 
and servants subjugated to him. And a sphere so large has been prepared for 
this guest’s recreation, amusement, and beneﬁt that half its diameter is as 
long and broad as the eye can see, indeed, as the imagination can stretch.

Thus, if man relies on his ego, and making worldly life his goal, attempts 
to taste temporary pleasures while struggling to make his living, he becomes 
submerged  within  an  extremely  constricted  sphere,  then  departs.  All  the 
members,  systems,  and  faculties  given  him  will  testify  against  him  at  the 
resurrection and will bring a suit against him. Whereas if he knows himself 
to be a guest and spends the capital of his life within the sphere of permis-
sion of the Generous One of Whom he is the guest, he will strive for a long, 
eternal life within a broad sphere, then take his rest and ease. And later, he 
may rise to the highest of the high.

Moreover, all the members and systems given to man will be happy with 
him and testify in favour of him in the hereafter. For sure, all the wonderful 
faculties given to human beings were not for this insigniﬁcant worldly life, 
but for an everlasting life of great signiﬁcance. For if we compare man with 
the animals, we see that he is very rich in regard to faculties and members, 
a hundred times more so than the animals. But in the pleasures of worldly 
life and in animal life he falls a hundred times lower. For present in each 
pleasure  he  receives  is  the  trace  of  thousands  of  pains.  The  pains  of  the 
past  and  fears  of  the  future  and  the  pain  at  each  pleasure’s  passing  spoil 
the enjoyment to had from them, and leave a trace in the pleasure. But ani-
mals are not like that. They receive pleasure with no pains. They take enjoy-
ment with no sorrow. Neither the sorrows of the past cause them suffering, 

TWENTY-THIRD WORD – SECOND CHAPTER

367

nor  the  fears  of  the  future  distress  them.  They  live  peacefully  and  offer 
thanks to their Creator.

This means that if man, who is created on the most excellent of patterns, 
thinks only of the life of this world, he falls a hundred times lower than a 
creature like a sparrow, although he is a hundred times higher than the ani-
mals with respect to his capital. I explained this in another place by means of 
a comparison. It is relevant, so I shall repeat it here. It was like this:

A man gave one of his servants ten pieces of gold and told him to have 
a suit of clothes made in a particular cloth. Then to a second one, he gave 
a thousand pieces of gold, and putting in the servant’s pocket a note on 
which  certain  things  were  written,  sent  him  to  a  market.  The  ﬁrst  serv-
ant bought an excellent suit of the ﬁnest cloth with the ten pieces of gold. 
While the second servant did not use his head, and looking at the ﬁrst serv-
ant and not reading the account-note in his pocket, he gave the thousand 
pieces of gold to a shopkeeper and asked for a suit of clothes. The dishon-
est shopkeeper gave him a suit of the very worst quality cloth. Then the 
wretched servant returned to his lord and received a severe reprimand and 
a terrible punishment.

Thus,  even  the  most  unintelligent  will  understand  that  the  thousand 
pieces of gold given the second servant were not to buy a suit of clothes, but 
for some important trade.

In just the same way, each of the immaterial members and subtle facul-
ties in man have expanded to a degree a hundred times greater than that of 
the animals. For example, consider faculties and members like man’s eyes, 
which can discern all the degrees of beauty, and his sense of taste, which can 
distinguish all the varieties of the particular tastes of foods, and his mind, 
which can penetrate to all the subtlest points of reality, and his heart, which 
yearns for every sort of perfection, and then consider the extremely simple 
members  of  the  animals  which  have  developed  only  one  or  two  degrees. 
There  is  just  this  difference,  that  in  animals  a  member  particular  to  some 
function and special to a particular species develops more. But this develop-
ment is particular.

The reason for man’s wealth in regard to faculties is this: by reason of 
the mind and thought, man’s senses and feelings have greatly developed and 
expanded.  And  numerous  emotions  have  come  into  being  because  of  the 
multiplicity of his needs. And his senses have become extremely diverse. 
And because of the comprehensiveness of his nature, desires have appeared 
turned towards numerous aims. And because he has numerous duties due to 

368

THE WORDS

his nature, his members and faculties have expanded greatly. And since he 
has been created with a nature capable of performing every sort of worship, 
he has been given abilities which embrace the seeds of all perfections.

Thus, this great wealth in faculties and abundant capital was certainly 
not given for procuring this unimportant temporary worldly life. Rather, 
man’s fundamental duty is to perform his duties, which look to innumer-
able aims; and proclaim his impotence, poverty, and faults in the form of 
worship; and observing the gloriﬁcations of beings with a universal eye, 
to bear witness to them; and seeing the instances of the Most Merciful’s 
assistance within the bounties, to offer thanks; and gazing on the miracles 
of  dominical  power  in  beings,  to  contemplate  on  them  as  objects  from 
which lessons may be drawn.

O man who worships this world, is the lover of worldly life, and is heed-
less of the meaning of the most excellent of patterns! The Old Said saw the 
reality of worldly life in a vision. It transformed him into the New Said. You 
too listen to it in the form of a comparison:

I  saw  that  I  was  a  traveller  and  was  going  on  a  long  journey;  that  is 
to say, I was being sent. The person who was my lord gradually gave me 
some of the money from the sixty gold pieces he had allotted me. I spent 
them, and came to a hostel where there were amusements of all kinds. In 
one  night  in  that  hostel  I  spent  ten  pieces  of  gold  on  gambling,  amuse-
ments,  and  the  enjoyment  of  fame.  In  the  morning  I  had  no  money  left. 
Moreover I had done no trade nor bought any goods for the place I was 
going. All that remained to me from the money were sins and pains, and 
from the amusements, wounds and sorrow. While in that sorry state, a man 
suddenly appeared. He said to me:

“ You  have  wasted  all  your  capital  and  deserve  punishment.  You  are 
going to your destination bankrupt and with your hands empty. But if you 
have any sense, the door of repentance is open. When you receive the ﬁf-
teen pieces of gold that remain to you, keep half of them in reserve. That is, 
obtain the things necessary for you in the place where you are going. ”

I looked, my soul did not agree to this.
So he said: “ A third, then. ”
My soul still did not obey him.
Then he said: “ A quarter. ”
My soul could not give up the habits to which it was addicted, so the man 

angrily turned his back on me and left.

TWENTY-THIRD WORD – SECOND CHAPTER

369

Suddenly, the scene changed. I was in a train in a tunnel, which was trav-
elling fast as though downwards vertically. I took fright. But what could I 
do, there was no escape anywhere. Strangely, attractive ﬂowers and enticing 
fruits appeared on both sides of the train. And I, like the foolish and inex-
perienced, looked at them and stretching out my hand, tried to pick them. 
But they were covered in thorns and tore at my hands when I  touched them 
making them bleed. With the movement of the train, my hands were lacer-
ated at being parted from them. They cost me much. Suddenly a porter on 
the train said:

“ Give me ﬁve  k u r u s h  and I shall give you as much of the ﬂowers and 
fruits as you want. You are caused the loss of a hundred k u r u s h  with your 
hands being torn, rather than ﬁve k u r u s h . Also there is a penalty; you cannot 
pick them without permission. ”

In  distress  I  put  my  head  out  of  the  window  and  looked  ahead  to  see 
when  the  tunnel  would  end.  I  saw  that  in  place  of  the  tunnel’s  entrance 
were numerous holes. People were being thrown into them from the long 
train. I saw a hole opposite me. At each end of it was a gravestone. I looked 
in amazement. I saw that written on one of the gravestones was the name 
SAID.  In  my  bewilderment  and  anxiety  I  exclaimed:  “ Alas! ”  Then  sud-
denly I heard the voice of the man who had given me advice at the door of 
the hostel. He asked:

“ Have you come to your senses? ”
I replied: “ Yes, but it is too late now. ”
So he said: “ Repent and place your trust in Allah. ”
I replied that I would. Then I awoke and saw myself as the New Said; the 

Old Said had disappeared.

That was the vision. May Allah cause good to come of it! I shall interpret 

one or two parts of it, then you can interpret the rest for yourself.

The  journey  was  the  journey  which  passes  from  the  World  of  Spirits, 
through  the  mother’s  womb,  youth,  old  age,  the  grave,  the  Intermediate 
Realm, the resurrection, and the Bridge of Sirat towards eternity. The sixty 
pieces of gold were the sixty years of life. I reckoned I saw the vision when 
I was forty-ﬁve years old. I had nothing to guarantee it, but a sincere student 
of the All-Wise Qur’an advised me to spend half of the ﬁfteen that remained 
to me on the hereafter. The hostel for me was Istanbul. The train was time, 
and each year a carriage. As for the tunnel, it was the life of this world. The 
thorny ﬂowers and fruits were illicit pleasures and forbidden amusements 

370

THE WORDS

which cause pain while indulging in them on thinking of their passing, and 
on separation lacerate the heart, making it bleed. They also cause a punish-
ment to be inﬂicted. The porter on the train told me to give him ﬁve kurush 
so that he would give me as many as I wanted.

The  meaning  of  this  is  as  follows:  the  pleasures  and  enjoyment  man 
receives through licit striving within the sphere of the lawful are sufﬁcient 
for him. No need remains to enter upon the unlawful. You may interpret the 
rest for yourself.

Fourth Remark

FOURTH REMARK

Man resembles a delicate and petted child in the universe. There is great 
strength in his weakness and great power in his impotence. For it is through 
the strength of his weakness and power of his impotence that beings have 
been subjected to him. If man understands his weakness and offers supplica-
tions verbally and by state and conduct, and recognizes his powerlessness 
and seeks help, since he has offered thanks for their subjugation, he achieves 
his aims and his desires are subjugated to him in a way far exceeding what 
he  could  achieve  through  his  own  power.  Only,  he  sometimes  wrongly 
attributes to his own power the attainment of a wish that has been obtained 
for him through the supplications offered by the tongue of his disposition. 
For example, the strength in the weakness of a chick causes the mother hen 
to attack a lion. And a newly-born lion cub subjugates to itself its savage and 
hungry lioness-mother, leaving the mother hungry and the cub full. See the 
strength in weakness and manifestation of divine mercy, which are worthy 
of notice!

By crying or asking or looking unhappy, a child subjugates the strong 
to himself, and is so successful in getting what he wants that he could not 
obtain one thousandth of it with a thousand times his own strength. That is 
to say, since weakness and helplessness excite compassion and a sense of 
protection towards him, the child can subjugate heroes to himself with his 
tiny ﬁnger. Now, if with foolish conceit such a child were to deny the com-
passion and accuse the protection saying: “ I subjugate these with my own 
strength ”, of course he will receive a slap. 

In the same way, if, like Qarun, a person says:

( 28:78 ) & % $ # "
that  is,  “ I  gained  this  through  my  own  knowledge  and  my  own  power ” 
in a way that demonstrates ingratitude and denies his Creator’s mercy and 

TWENTY-THIRD WORD – SECOND CHAPTER

371

accuses His wisdom, he will of course deserve a punishing blow. This means 
that man’s domination and human advances and the attainments of civiliza-
tion, which are to be observed, have been made subject to him not through 
his attracting them or conquering them or through combat, but due to his 
weakness. He has been assisted because of his impotence. They have been 
bestowed on him due to his indigence. He has been inspired with them due 
to his ignorance. They have been given him due to his need. And the rea-
son for his domination is not strength and the power of knowledge, but the 
compassion and clemency of the Sustainer and divine mercy and wisdom: 
they have subjugated things to him. Yes, what clothes man, who is defeated 
by such vermin as eyeless scorpions and legless snakes, in silk  from a tiny 
worm and feeds him honey from a poisonous insect is not his own power, 
but the subjugation of his Lord and Sustainer and the bestowal of the Most 
Merciful, which are the fruits of his weakness.

O man! Since the reality of the matter is thus, give up egotism and arro-
gance.  Proclaim  your  impotence  and  weakness  at  the  divine  court  with 
the tongue of seeking help, and your poverty and need with the tongue of 
entreaty and supplication. Show that you are His slave. Say:

and rise in degree.

( 3:173 ) Ø × Ö Õ

Also, do not say: “ I am nothing. What importance do I have that the 
universe should purposefully be made subject to me by an Absolutely All-
Wise One, and universal thanks be required of me? ” Because for sure you 
are as though nothing with respect to your soul and form, but in regard to 
duty and rank, you are an observant spectator of this majestic universe, an 
eloquent, articulate tongue of these beings so full of wisdom, a discerning 
reader of this book of the universe, a supervisor of these creatures full of 
wonder at their gloriﬁcations, and like a foreman of these beings full of 
respect for their worship.

Yes, O man! In regard to your vegetable physical being and animal soul, 
you are a miniscule particle, a contemptible atom, a needy creature, a weak 
animal, who, tossed on the awesome waves of the ﬂood of beings, is depart-
ing.  But  being  perfected  through  the  light  of  belief,  which  comprises  the 
radiance of divine love, and through the training of Islam, which is enlight-
ened, in regard to humanity and servitude to Allah, you are a king, and a 
universal within particularity, and within your insigniﬁcance, a world, and 
within your contemptibility, a supervisor of such high rank and extensive 
sphere that you can say: “ My Compassionate Sustainer has made the world 

372

THE WORDS

a house for me, the sun and moon lamps for it, and the spring, a bunch of 
ﬂowers for me, and summer, a table of bounties, and the animals, He has 
made my servants, and plants the decorated furnishings of my house. ”

T o   c o n c l u d e :  If you heed Satan and your soul, you will fall to the lowest 
of the low. But if you heed truth and the Qur’an, you will rise to the highest 
of the high and become the Most Excellent Pattern of the universe.

Fifth Remark

FIFTH REMARK

Man has been sent to this world as an ofﬁcial and guest, and has been 
given abilities of great signiﬁcance. And he has been entrusted with impor-
tant  duties  in  accordance  with  those  abilities.  In  order  to  employ  man  in  
fulﬁlling those aims and duties, powerful encouragement and severe threats 
have been made. We shall here summarize the fundamentals of worship and 
of man’s duties, which we have explained at length elsewhere, so that the 
mystery of ‘the Most Excellent of Patterns’ may be understood.

On coming into the universe man has two aspects related to worship and 
being a slave of Allah. One is worship and contemplation in the absence of 
the Object of Worship. The other is worship and supplication in His pres-
ence and addressing Him directly.

First Aspect: It is to afﬁrm submissively the sovereignty of dominicality 
apparent in the universe and to observe its perfections and virtues in wonder.
Then  it  is  to  proclaim  and  herald  the  unique  arts  which  consist  of  the 
inscriptions of the sacred divine names and to display them as an example 
to others.

Then it is to weigh on the scales of perception the jewels of the dominical 
names, which are all like hidden treasures; it is to appreciatively afﬁrm their 
value with a discerning heart.

Then it is to study and ponder over in wonder the pages of beings and 

leaves of the earth and sky, which are like missives of the pen of power.

Then  through  beholding  admiringly  the  adornment  and  subtle  arts  in 
beings, it is to feel love for knowledge of their All-Glorious Creator, and 
to yearn to ascend to the presence of their All-Perfect Maker and to receive 
His favours.

Second Aspect: This is the station of presence and address whereat man 
passes from the work to the producer of the work and he sees that an All-
Beauteous Maker wants to make Himself known and acquainted through the 
miracles of His art, and he responds with knowledge and belief.

TWENTY-THIRD WORD – SECOND CHAPTER

373

Then he sees that an All-Compassionate Sustainer wants to make Him-
self loved through the ﬁne fruits of His mercy. So conﬁning his love and 
worship to Him, he makes himself love Him.

Then he sees that an All-Generous Bestower is nurturing him with the 
delights  of  bounties  material  and  immaterial,  and  in  return  he  offers  Him 
thanks and praise with his actions, conduct, words, and as far as he can, with 
all his senses and faculties.

Then he sees that an All-Beauteous and Glorious One is announcing His 
tremendousness and perfections, and glory and beauty in the mirrors of these 
beings, and is drawing attentive gazes to them. So in response he declares: 
“ Allah is Most Great! Glory be to Allah! ”, and in humility prostrates in love 
and wonder.

Then he sees that a Possessor of Absolute Riches is displaying His  bound-
less  wealth  and  treasuries  amid  an  absolute  muniﬁcence.  So  in  response, 
exalting  and  praising  Him,  he  entreats  and  asks  for  them,  expressing  his 
utter need.

Then he sees that the All-Glorious Creator has made the face of the earth 
like  an  exhibition  and  displayed  on  it  all  His  antique  works  of  art.  So  in 
response he exclaims in appreciation: “ What wonders Allah has willed! ”, 
and in admiration: “ What blessings Allah has bestowed! ”, and in wonder: 
“ Glory be to Allah! ”, and in astonishment: “ Allah is Most Great! ”

Then he sees that in His palace of the universe a Single One of Unity has 
struck seals of unity on all beings with His inimitable signature, and with His 
stamps, signets, and cyphers particular to Him; that He inscribes the signs 
of His unity; and planting the banner of unity in every region of the world, 
He proclaims His dominicality. And he responds with assent, belief, submis-
sion, worship, and afﬁrmation of His unity.

Thus, through worship and contemplation of this kind he becomes a true 
man. He shows that he is on the Most Excellent of Patterns. Through the 
auspiciousness of belief he becomes a reliable vicegerent of the earth worthy 
of bearing the Trust.

O heedless man created on the Most Excellent of Patterns, who, through 
the misuse of his will is descending to the lowest of the low! Listen to me! 
In the heedlessness induced by the intoxication of youth I, like you, thought 
the world was ﬁne and lovely. Then the moment I awoke in the morning of 
old age, I saw how ugly was the world’s face that was not turned towards 
the hereafter, which I had previously imagined to be beautiful. To see this 

374

THE WORDS

and how beautiful was its true face, which looks to the hereafter, you may 
refer to the two Signboards in the Second Station of the Seventeenth Word, 
and see for yourself.

The  First  Signboard  depicts  the  reality  of  the  world  of  the  people  of 
neglect, which long ago, like the people of misguidance, I saw through the 
veil of heedlessness, but without being intoxicated.

The Second Signboard indicates the reality of the worlds of the people 
of guidance. I left it in the form it was written long ago. It resembles poetry, 
but it is not really that.

(cid:2)(cid:3)

( 20:8 ) { z y x w v u t s 
We shall indicate ﬁve branches of one of the many truths from the lumi-

nous tree of this glorious verse.

FIRST BRANCH

A  sultan  has  different  titles  in  the  spheres  of  his  government,  and  dif-
ferent styles and attributes among the classes of his subjects, and different 
names  and  signs  in  the  levels  of  his  rule,  for  example,  Just  Judge  in  the 
judiciary, Sultan in the civil service, Commander-in-Chief in the army, and 
Caliph in the learned establishment. If, making an analogy with these, you 
know the rest of his names and titles, you will understand that a single sul-
tan may possess a thousand names and titles in the spheres of his rule and 
levels of his government. It is as if, through his corporate personality and 
telephone, the ruler is present and knowing in every sphere; and through his 
laws and regulations and representatives, sees and is seen; and behind the 
veil in every degree, disposes and sees, governs and observes through his 
decree, knowledge, and power.

It is exactly the same for the Lord and Sustainer of All the Worlds, Who 
is the Ruler of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity; in the degrees of His domini-
cality He has attributes and designations which are all different but which 
look to each other; and in the spheres of His Godhead He has names and 
marks which are all different but which are one within the other; and in His 
magniﬁcent activities He has representations and appellations which are all 
different but which resemble each other; and in the disposals of His power 

375

376

THE WORDS

He has titles which are all different but which hint of one another; and in 
the  manifestations  of  His  attributes  He  has  sacred  appearances  which  are 
all  different  but  which  show  one  another;  and  in  the  displays  of  His  acts 
He    has  wise  disposals  which  are  of  numerous  sorts  but  which  complete 
one another; and in His multicoloured art and varieties of creatures, He has 
splendid aspects of dominicality which are all different but which look to one 
another. And together with this, in every world, in every realm of beings, the 
title of one of the most beautiful names is manifested. In each sphere one 
name is dominant and the other names are subordinate to it, rather, they are 
there on account of it.

Furthermore, in every level of beings, many or few, great or small, partic-
ular or general, He has an appearance through a particular manifestation, a 
particular dominicality, a particular name. That is to say, although the name 
in  question  is  general  and  encompasses  everything,  it  is  turned  towards  a 
thing with such intention and importance that it is as if it is special to that 
thing  alone.  Moreover,  although  the  All-Glorious  Creator  is  close  to  eve-
rything, there are almost seventy thousand luminous veils obscuring Him. 
You can compare how many veils there are from the particular degree of 
creativity of the name of Creator which is manifested on you to the greatest 
degree and the supreme title, which is Creator of the whole universe. That 
is to say, on condition you leave the universe behind you, from the door of 
creativity you may reach the limits of the name of Creator and draw close to 
the sphere of attributes.

The veils have windows which look to one another, and the names appear 
one within the other, and the acts look to one another, and the similitudes 
enter one within the other, and the titles hint of one another, and the mani-
festations  resemble  each  other,  and  the  disposals  assist  and  complete  one 
another,  and  the  various  dispositions  of  dominicality  help  and  assist  one 
another. It surely therefore necessitates not denying the other titles, acts, and 
degrees of dominicality when Almighty Allah is known through one of His 
names, titles, or degrees of dominicality. Indeed, it is harmful if a transition 
is not made from the manifestation of any one name to the others. For exam-
ple,  if  the  works  of  the  names  of  All-Powerful  and  Creator  are  seen,  and 
not the name of All-Knowing, a person may fall into heedlessness and the 
misguidance of nature. He should always keep in view and recite:  َوُ(cid:182) and: 
ّ(cid:195)ا َوُ(cid:182) He should listen, and hear from everything: ( 112:1 ) $ # " !  
His tongue should utter and proclaim: “ All the world declares: There is no

god but He! ” Thus, through the decree of { z y x w v u t s 
( 20:8 ) , the Qur’an points to these truths we have mentioned.

If you want to observe these elevated truths from close to, go and ask a 
stormy sea or the quaking earth: “ What are you saying? ” You will hear that 
they  are  declaring:  “ O  Glorious  One!  O  Glorious  One!  O  One  of  Might,  
All-Compelling! ” Then ask the small animals and their young being raised 
with kindness and compassion in the sea and on the land: “ What are you 
saying? ” They will surely reply: “ O Beauteous One! O Beauteous One! O 
Most Compassionate! O Most Compassionate! ”  1 Then listen to the skies; 
they say: “ O Glorious One of Beauty! ” And give your ear to the earth; it 
says: “ O Beauteous One of Glory! ” Listen carefully to the animals; they are 
saying: “ O Most Merciful One! O Provider! ” And ask the spring; you will 
hear many names like: “ O Gentle One! O Most Merciful! O Most Compas-
sionate! O Most Generous! O Gracious One! O Benevolent One! O Giver 
of Forms! O Giver of Light! O Bestower! O Adorner! ” Then ask a human 
being  who  is  a  true  human,  and  see  how  he  recites  all  the  most  beautiful 
names and how they are written on his forehead. If you look carefully, you 
too may read them. It is as if the universe is a huge orchestra celebrating the 

1.  Even, one day I looked at the cats; all they were doing was eating, playing, and 
sleeping. I wondered: how is it these little monsters which perform no duties are known as 
blessed. Later, I lay down to sleep for the night. I looked; one of the cats had come. It lay 
against my pillow and put its mouth against my ear, and murmuring: “ O   M o s t   C o m p a s -
s i o n a t e !   O   M o s t   C o m p a s s i o n a t e !  ” most clearly, as though refuted in the name of its spe-
cies the objection and insult which had occurred to me, throwing it in my face. Then this 
occurred to me: I wonder if this recitation is particular to this cat, or is it general among 
cats? And is it only an unfair objector like me who hears it, or if anyone listens carefully, 
can they hear it? 

The next morning I listened to the other cats; it was not so clearly, but to varying de-
grees they were repeating the same invocation. At ﬁrst, “ O Most Compassionate! ” was 
discernible following their purring. Then gradually their purrings and meaowings became 
the same “ O Most Compassionate! ” It became an inarticulated, eloquent and sorrowful 
recitation. They would close their mouths and utter a ﬁne “ O Most Compassionate! ”

I related the story to the brothers who visited me and they listened carefully as well, 
then said that they heard it to an extent. Later I wondered what this name’s special fea-
ture was, and why they recite it in the way of men and not in animal tongue. Then it was 
imparted to my heart that since these animals are very delicate and petted like children 
and are a friend of man, they are in much need of kindness and compassion. When they 
are stroked and paid attention to in the way they like, as praise and thanks for the bounty, 
and unlike dogs, they proclaim the mercy of their All-Compassionate Creator in their own 
worlds. They warn men in the sleep of heedlessness, and through their cry of “ O   M o s t  
C o m p a s s i o n a t e !  ”, they remind those who worship causes Who it is that help comes from 
and from Whom mercy may be awaited.

378

THE WORDS

divine names. Mixing the faintest song with the most powerful refrains, it 
produces a sublime and subtle harmony. You may make further analogies in 
the same way.

For  sure,  the  human  being  is  the  place  of  manifestation  of  all  the 
names, but the names being various has resulted in the universe’s vari-
ety  and  the  differences  in  the  angels’  worship,  and  has  also  caused  a 
degree  of  variety  among  men.  The  different  laws  of  the  prophets  have 
arisen from this mystery, as have the different ways of the saints, and the 
different paths of the puriﬁed scholars. For example, together with the 
other names, the name of All-Powerful was predominant in Jesus ( Upon 
whom be peace ). And in those who follow the path of love, the name of 
Loving One prevails, and in those who follow the path of contemplation 
and reﬂection, the name of All-Wise.

Thus, if someone is both a teacher and a policeman and a clerk of the 
court, and an inspector in the civil service, in each ofﬁce he has both rela-
tions,  and  duties,  and  obligations,  and  salaries,  and  responsibilities,  and 
promotion, and enemies and rivals who are the cause of his failures. He 
appears before the king with many titles, and he sees the king. He seeks 
help from him with many tongues. He has recourse to many of the ruler’s 
titles and seeks his help in many forms in order to be saved from the evil 
of his enemies.

In just the same way, man, who manifests many names and is charged 
with  many  duties  and  afﬂicted  with  many  enemies,  invokes  many  of  the 
names in his prayers and supplications. Like Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ), the cause of pride of mankind and truly the 
most perfect man, supplicated with a thousand and one names in his prayer, 
J a u s h a n   a l - K a b i r ,  seeking  refuge  from  Hell-ﬁre.  It  is  due  to  this  mystery 
that the sura,

 * Y X * V U * S R Q P 
 ( 114:1-4 ) ...^ ] \ [

commands that we take refuge with Allah through three titles, and,

(cid:2)(cid:3)

shows the seeking of help through three names.

This  explains  two  mysteries  which  comprise  the  keys  to  many  further 

FIRST  MYSTERY:  “ Why  do  the  saints  differ  greatly  in  their  visions 
and  illuminations  although  they  are  unanimous  on  the  fundamentals  of 
belief? Why are their illuminations, which are at the degree of witnessing, 
sometimes opposed to reality and contrary to the truth? And why in their 
ideas which they consider to be the truth, establishing them through decisive 
proofs, do thinkers and scholars see and show reality in a way that contra-
dicts one another? Why does one truth take on numerous colours? ”

SECOND MYSTERY: “ Why did the early prophets deal with some of 
the  pillars  of  belief  like  bodily  resurrection  brieﬂy  and  not  explain  them 
in    detail  like  the  Qur’an  so  that  in  the  future  some  of  their  communities 
went as far as denying some of those concise pillars? Also, why did some 
of  the  saints  who  had  true  knowledge  only  advance  in  the  afﬁrmation  of 
divine unity, and although they progressed as far as the degree of absolute 
certainty in divine unity, some of the pillars of belief appear in their paths 
very infrequently and in summary form? As a result, those who followed 
them in the future did not give the necessary importance to those pillars and 
some of them even fell into error? Since true perfection is found through the 
unfolding of all the pillars of belief, why did the people of reality advance 
signiﬁcantly in some of the pillars while remaining very backward in oth-
ers, whereas Allah’s Most Noble Messenger ( UWBP ), who manifested all 
the divine names at their maximum degree and was the chief of the proph-
ets, and the All-Wise Qur’an, which is the luminous chief of all the sacred 
scriptures, described in detail all the pillars of belief, clearly, and in a most 
serious manner and deliberate way? ”

Because  in  reality  the  most  true  and  complete  perfection  is  thus.  Yes, 
the wisdom in these mysteries is this: for sure man is the place of manifes-
tation of all the names and is predisposed to all perfections, but since his 
power is slight, his will partial, his abilities various, and his desires differ-
ent,  he  searches  for  reality  among  thousands  of  veils  and  barriers.  So,  in 
uncovering reality and witnessing the truth, barriers intervene. Some people 
cannot by-pass the barriers. Their abilities are all different. The abilities of 
some cannot support the unfolding of some of the truths of belief. Moreo-
ver,  the  colours  of  the  name’s  manifestations  vary  according  to  the  place 
they are manifested; they become various and different. Some people who 

380

THE WORDS

manifest them cannot be the means to the complete manifestation of a name. 
Also, the manifestation of the names takes on different forms in respect of 
universality,  particularity,  shadow,  or  originality.  Some  capacities  cannot 
transcend particularity. And some cannot emerge from the shadow. In some 
capacities, sometimes one name is predominant and it carries out its word 
and rules in that capacity. Now we shall make a few indications to this pro-
found mystery and this extensive wisdom with an enigmatical, comprehen-
sive, true, but somewhat complex, comparison.

For example, let us suppose an adorned ﬂower, a living droplet enam-
oured of the moon, and a translucent atom which looks to the sun. Each of 
these possesses consciousness and some perfection, and each has a yearning 
for that perfection. Together with indicating many truths, these three things 
also  allude  to  the  spiritual  voyaging  of  the  soul,  the  mind,  and  the  heart. 
They also correspond to three levels of those who investigate reality. 1

T h e   F i r s t  indicates the followers of the path of intellectual thought; the 
followers of the path of sainthood; and the followers of the path of prophet-
hood.

T h e   S e c o n d  corresponds to those who approach reality by striving for 
perfection through the bodily systems; and those who approach it by striv-
ing with the mind and reﬁning the soul; and those who approach it through 
belief, submission, and purifying the heart.

T h e   T h i r d  is the comparison of those who do not give up egotism, are 
plunged  in  works,  and  approach  reality  through  inference  ( i s t i d l â l  )  only; 
and  of  those  who  search  for  reality  through  knowledge  and  science  ( h i k -
m e t  ), reason and learning; and those who approach reality swiftly through 
belief and the Qur’an, poverty and worship. These comparisons point to the 
wisdom in the differences between the three groups, whose innate capacities 
are also different.

Thus, under the titles of Flower, Droplet, and Atom, we shall show by 
means of a comparison, the mystery and extensive wisdom in the progress of 
the three groups. For example, with its Creator’s permission and at His com-
mand, the sun has three sorts of manifestation, reﬂection and radiance: one is 
its reﬂection on ﬂowers, one its reﬂection on the moon and the planets, and 
one its reﬂection on shining objects like glass and water.

1.  There are also three groups in each level. The three things given as examples in the 
comparison look to these three groups which are in each level. Indeed, they look to those 
nine groups, not the three levels.

TWENTY-FOURTH WORD – SECOND BRANCH

381

The First is in three ways:
O n e  is a universal and general manifestation and reﬂection whereby its 

radiance encompasses all ﬂowers at once.

A n o t h e r  is a special manifestation whereby it has a special reﬂection for 

each species.

A n o t h e r  is a particular manifestation whereby its effulgence is in accord-

ance with the individuality of each ﬂower. 

This comparison of ours is in conformity with this statement: the adorned 
colours of ﬂowers arise from the changing reﬂections of the seven colours in 
the sun’s light. According to this, ﬂowers too are sorts of mirrors to the sun.
The Second is the light and effulgence which, with the All-Wise Crea-
tor’s  permission,  the  sun  gives  to  the  moon  and  planets.  Having  received 
this extensive, universal light and effulgence, the moon, whose light is like 
a shadow of that light, proﬁts from the sun in a universal fashion. Then its 
radiance and effulgence shines in a particular way on the seas and air and  
shining earth, and partially on the bubbles on the sea and translucent parti-
cles of the earth and the molecules of the air.

The Third is, through the divine command, a reﬂection of the sun which, 
making the air and the surface of the seas into mirrors, is pure, universal, and 
without shadow. Then the sun gives to each of the bubbles on the sea, the 
droplets of water, molecules of air, and snowﬂakes, a particular reﬂection 
and tiny image of itself. 

Thus, in the three ways mentioned above, the sun bestows an effulgence 
and favour on every ﬂower, the moon, and all droplets and atoms. And these 
in turn are each in two ways:

T h e   F i r s t   W a y  is direct, and without barrier or veil. This way represents 

the way of prophethood.

T h e   S e c o n d   W a y :  In this, barriers intervene. The capacities of the mir-
rors and places of manifestation add colour to the sun’s manifestations. This 
way represents the way of sainthood.

Thus, on the First Way, Flower, Droplet, and Atom can each say: “ I am 
a mirror to the Sun of all the world. ” But on the Second Way they cannot 
say that; they can rather say: “ I am the mirror to my own sun, or the mirror 
to the sun which is manifested in my species. ” For that is the manner in 
which they know the sun. They cannot see a sun which looks to the whole 
world; the sun of that individual or species or genus appears to it within 
narrow conﬁnes and under limiting restrictions. And it cannot ascribe to the 

382

THE WORDS

restricted sun the works of the unrestricted, unconﬁned, absolute sun. For 
within those narrow restrictions and limited conﬁnes it cannot attribute to 
the sun with the certain witnessing of the heart its majestic works like fur-
nishing the whole face of the earth with light and heat, stirring all plants and 
animals into life, and making the planets revolve around it. Indeed, even if 
those three things, which we suppose to have consciousness, ascribe those 
wondrous  works  to  the  sun  which  they  see  under  those  restrictions,  they 
can only do so with the mind and through belief, and through submitting 
to the fact that that restricted thing is absolute. Whereas these judgements 
of Flower, Droplet, and Atom, which we suppose to possess reason like a 
human being, that is, their ascribing those mighty works to the sun, is with 
the mind and reason, it is not through illumination. Indeed, sometimes their 
judgements concerning belief clash with their illuminations regarding the 
cosmos. They can only believe them with great difﬁculty.

Now the three of us must enter into this comparison, which is narrow for 
reality but in some of the corners of which the members of reality are to be 
seen and which is mixed with reality. The three of us shall suppose ourselves 
to be Flower, Droplet, and Atom. For the consciousness which we suppose 
them to have is insufﬁcient. We must add our reasoning faculties to theirs. 
That is to say, just as they receive effulgence from their physical sun, we too 
shall receive effulgence from our immaterial sun, and must understand it.

My friend, who has not forgotten the world, is preoccupied with mate-
riality, and whose soul is dense! You be Flower. Flower takes on a colour 
dissolved from the sun’s light, and it mixes the sun’s image in with that 
colour and clothes itself in an adorned form. For your capacity resembles 
it as well. Then let this philosopher who has studied secular science and 
is plunged in causes like the Old Said be Droplet, which is enamoured of 
the moon. For the moon affords him the shadow of light it has received 
from the sun, and it gives a light to the pupil of his eye. Droplet too shines 
with  the  light,  but  he  can  only  see  the  moon  with  it,  he  cannot  see  the 
sun. Rather, he can only see it through his belief. Then, let this poor man 
be Atom, who knows everything to be directly from Almighty Allah and 
looks on causes as veils. He is such an Atom that knows himself to be poor 
in his own self. He has nothing on which to depend so as to rely on himself 
like Flower. He possesses no colour that he should appear through it. He 
does not recognize other things that he should turn towards them. He has 
a sheer purity by which he holds the sun’s image directly in the pupil of 
his eye. Now, since we have taken the place of these three things, we must 
consider ourselves. What do we have? What must we do?

TWENTY-FOURTH WORD – SECOND BRANCH

383

Thus, we look and see that through his favours a Most Muniﬁcent One 
is  adorning,  illuminating,  and  nurturing  us.  Now,  man  worships  one  who 
bestows  favours  on  him.  He  wants  to  be  close  to  one  worthy  of  worship, 
and  desires  to  see  him.  In  which  case,  in  accordance  with  our  capacities, 
each  of  us  journeys  through  the  attraction  of  that  love.  You  who  is  like 
Flower, you are going, but go as a ﬂower. See, you have gone. You have 
advanced and advanced till you have reached a universal degree, as though 
you have become like all ﬂowers. But Flower is a dense mirror; it dissolves 
and refracts the seven colours in light; it conceals the sun’s reﬂection. You 
will not be successful in seeing the face of the sun which you love, for the 
colours and characteristics, which are restricted, disperse it, draw a veil over 
it and obscure it. In this situation, you cannot be saved from the separation 
which occurs with the interposing of barriers. However, you can be saved 
on one condition, which is that you raise your head, which is sunk in love of 
your own soul, and withdraw your gaze, which glories and takes pleasure in 
its own merits, and cast it at the face of the sun in the sky. But on condition 
you turn your face looking down to the earth to gain your  livelihood, up to 
the sun. For you are its mirror. Your duty is to act as a mirror to it. Whether 
you know it or not, your sustenance will anyway come from the earth, the 
door to the treasury of mercy. Yes, a ﬂower is a miniscule mirror of the sun, 
and the sun too is merely a drop-like ﬂash manifesting in the seas of the skies 
the name of Light of the Pre-Eternal Sun.

O heart of man! Understand from this, of what sort of a sun you are the 
mirror. After fulﬁlling this condition, you will ﬁnd your perfection. But just 
as in actual reality you cannot see the sun in that way, so you cannot under-
stand this truth naked; the colours of your attributes give it a colour and your 
cloudy telescope imposes a form on it, and your limited capacity restricts it.
Now, wise philosopher who has entered into Droplet! You have advanced 
as far as the moon with the telescope of your droplet of thought and by the 
stairway of philosophy. You have entered the moon. Look, of itself the moon 
is dense and dark; it has neither light nor life. Your endeavour has all been 
in vain and your knowledge has proved to be proﬁtless. You can only be 
saved from the darkness of despair, the desolation of loneliness, the pester-
ing of evil spirits, and the horrors of that bleakness through these conditions: 
that you give up the night of nature and turn to the sun of reality, and you 
believe with complete certainty that the light of this night are the shadows 
of the lights of the daytime sun. After fulﬁlling these conditions, you will 
ﬁnd your perfection. You will ﬁnd the majestic sun in place of the poor and 

384

THE WORDS

darksome moon. But like your previous friend, you will not be able to see 
the sun clearly; you will see it beyond the veils with which your reason and 
your philosophy are familiar and conversant, and behind the screens woven 
by science and learning, and within a colour conferred by your capacity.

And now our Atom-like third friend, who is both poor and colourless. 
He swiftly evaporates in the sun’s heat, abandons his egotism, mounts the 
steam, and rises into the air. The dense matter within him catches ﬁre with 
the ﬂame of love and is transformed into light and radiance. He adheres to 
a ray proceeding from the manifestations of that light, and draws close to 
it. O you who resembles Atom! Since you act as a direct mirror to the sun, 
at  whatever  degree  you  are,  you  will ﬁnd  an  opening,  a  window,  looking 
purely at the sun itself in a fashion that yields the vision of certainty. And 
you will experience no difﬁculty in attributing to the sun its wondrous works. 
Without hesitation you will be able to ascribe to it the majestic attributes of 
which it is worthy. Nothing will be able to take you by the hand and make 
you forego ascribing to it the awesome works of its essential sovereignty. 
Neither the constriction of barriers, nor the limitations of your capacity, nor 
the  smallness  of  mirrors  will  confuse  you,  nor  impel  you  contrary  to  the 
truth. Because, since you look at it purely, sincerely, and directly, you have 
understood that what appears in the places of manifestation and is observed 
in the mirrors, is not the sun, but manifestations of it of a sort, and coloured 
reﬂections of it of a sort. For sure those reﬂections are its titles, but they do 
not display all the works of its splendour.

Thus,  in  this  comparison,  which  is  mixed  with  reality,  perfection  is 
reached by means of three ways which are all different and which differ 
concerning the virtues of those perfections and the details of the degrees of 
witnessing. But in conclusion and in submitting to the truth and conﬁrming 
the reality, they are in agreement. Just as a man of the night who has never 
seen the sun and has only seen its shadow in the mirror of the moon, can-
not squeeze into his mind the resplendent light and awesome gravity par-
ticular to the sun, but submits to those who have seen it and imitates them; 
similarly,  the  person  who  cannot  attain  through  the  legacy  of  Muham-
mad  ( UWBP )  to  the  maximum  degrees  of  such  names  as  All-Powerful 
and Giver of Life, accepts the resurrection of the dead and Great Gather-
ing imitatively, and declares that it is not a matter that can be understood 
through the reason. For the reality of the resurrection and Last Judgement 
is  the  manifestation  of  the  greatest  name  and  of  the  supreme  degree  of 
certain other names. Those whose gaze cannot rise there are compelled to 

TWENTY-FOURTH WORD – THIRD BRANCH

385

believe in it by way of imitation. While those whose minds can enter there, 
see  the  resurrection  and  Last  Judgement  as  easily  as  day  and  night,  and 
spring and winter, and accept it with an easy mind.

Thus, it is due to this mystery that the Qur’an speaks of the resurrection 
and Great Gathering at the highest level and in a perfect and detailed man-
ner, and our Prophet ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), who manifested 
the greatest name, taught it thus. And as required by the wisdom of guid-
ance, the former prophets did not teach their communities about the resur-
rection of the dead at the highest level and with the most extensive details for 
they were at a somewhat simple and primitive level. It was also due to this 
mystery that some of those who followed the path of sainthood did not see or 
could not demonstrate some of the truths of belief at the greatest degree. It is 
also due to this mystery that there are pronounced differences in the degrees 
of those who have knowledge of Allah. Numerous other similar mysteries 
unfold from this truth. Now, since both this comparison hints at the truth 
a  little,  and  the  truth  is  extremely  extensive  and  profound,  we  also  shall 
content ourselves with the comparison and not attempt mysteries which are 
beyond our limit and capacity.

THIRD BRANCH

Hadiths that speak of the signs of the end of time, the events at the end 
of time, and the merits and rewards of certain actions have not been well 
understood, in consequence of which some scholars who rely on their reason 
have pronounced some of them to be either weak or false. While some of the 
scholars whose belief was weak but whose egotism was strong have gone as 
far as denying them. For now we shall not attempt any detailed discussion, 
but shall only explain twelve principles.

First Principle

FIRST PRINCIPLE: This is a matter which we have explained in the 
question and answer at the end of the Twentieth Word. Its summary is this: 
Religion  is  an  examination,  a  test,  which  distinguishes  elevated  spirits 
from base ones. It therefore speaks of matters that everyone shall see with 
their eyes in the future in such a way that they remain neither altogether 
unknown, nor so self-evident that everyone will be compelled to conﬁrm 
them. They open the door to the reason but do not take the will from the 
hand. For if a sign of the Last Day appeared completely self-evidently and 
everyone  was  compelled  to  afﬁrm  it,  then  a  disposition  like  coal  would 
remain equal to one like diamonds. The mystery of human accountability 
and the results of examination would go for nothing. It is because of this 
that there has been much dispute over many matters like that of the Mahdi 

386

THE WORDS

and Sufyan. Also, the narrations differ greatly; there have been statements 
concerning them that contradict one another.

Second Principle

SECOND PRINCIPLE: There are various levels in the matters of Islam. 
If one requires certain proof, for another the prevailing opinion is sufﬁcient. 
Others require merely assent and acceptance and not to be rejected. In which 
case, secondary matters or particular events in time which are not among 
the fundamentals of belief do not require certain belief and compliance and 
deﬁnite proof, just not to be rejected and to be submitted to, and not to be 
interfered with.

Third Principle

Fourth Principle

THIRD PRINCIPLE: Most of the Jewish and Christian scholars entered 
Islam during the time of the Companions of the Prophet ( UWBP ) and their 
former knowledge became Muslim along with them. Some of their former 
knowledge was contrary to the truth but was imagined to be a part of Islam.
FOURTH PRINCIPLE: Some of the Hadith narrators’ own words or the 
meanings they assumed were considered to be part of the original texts of 
the Hadiths. Man cannot be free of fault, however, and some of their deduc-
tions or words which were contrary to the truth were supposed to be Hadiths 
and were pronounced weak.

Fifth Principle

ّ(cid:174)ُا يِ(cid:158) َ

FIFTH PRINCIPLE: In accordance with the inner meaning of: 
ّدَ(cid:111)ُ(cid:174) يِ(cid:99)َ

َنوُ(cid:102)َ
ّنِا inferring, َنوُ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:183)ْ(cid:171)ُ(cid:174) 1 some meanings of Hadiths that were 
attained through the inspirations of inspired Hadith scholars who followed 
the path of illumination and sainthood were supposed to be wholly Hadiths. 
Whereas, certain obstructions may give rise to errors in the saints’ inspira-
tions. Some Hadiths of this type may therefore be contrary to the truth.

Sixth Principle

SIXTH PRINCIPLE: There are certain popular, well-known stories that 
heve become proverbial; their true meanings are not thought of. What comes 
to mind is the purpose they were spread. Thus, some stories and fables which 
had become well-known among people in this way, Allah’s Noble Messen-
ger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) told in the form of comparisons 
and allusions for purposes of guidance. If there are any errors in the literal 
meanings of stories of this sort, they arise from the people’s customs and 
traditions, and the way they have been transmitted among them.

Seventh Principle

SEVENTH PRINCIPLE: There are many similes and parables that with 
the passage of time or with passing from the hand of learning to the hand 
of ignorance have been supposed to be physical fact and become erroneous. 

1.  B u k h ā r ī , Faḍā’il al-Ṣaḥāba, 6; Anbiyā’, 54; M u s l i m , Faḍā’il al-Ṣaḥāba, 23; Ti r m i d h ī ,

For example, two of Allah’s angels in the World of Similitudes called the 
Bull ( Taurus ) and the Fish ( Pisces ), who are among the supervisors of the 
animals of the land and the sea and are represented as a bull and ﬁsh, were 
imagined to be huge bull and a physical ﬁsh, and the Hadith was wrongly 
interpreted. And for example, one time in the presence of the Prophet a deep 
rumbling  was  heard.  Allah’s  Messenger  ( UWBP )  decreed:  “ That  is  the 
sound of a rock that has been rolling downhill for seventy years and only 
now has hit the bottom of Hell. ” 1 Someone who heard this Hadith but did 
not know the truth might have deviated into denial. But then, twenty minutes 
after the Hadith was spoken the truth was deﬁnitely established, for someone 
came and told Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ): “ The famous dissembler died 
twenty minutes ago. ” Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) had described most elo-
quently how the dissembler’s seventy-year lifetime of unbelief as a stone of 
Hell had been a continuous descent to the lowest of the low. Almighty Allah 
had made that rumbling heard at the moment of his death and apprised him 
with a sign.

Eighth Principle

EIGHTH PRINCIPLE: In this arena of trial and realm of examination, 
Almighty Allah, the Absolutely Wise One, conceals things of great impor-
tance  in  the  midst  of  numerous  others,  and  this  is  tied  to  many  purposes, 
beneﬁts, and instances of wisdom. For example, He has hidden the Night of 
Power in the whole of Ramadan, and the hour when prayers are answered in 
the whole of Friday, and well-accepted saints among the people generally, 
and the appointed hour in a person’s lifetime as well as the time of Dooms-
day in the life of the world. For if the time of man’s death were speciﬁed, 
the  ﬁrst  half  of  his  life  would  be  passed  in  absolute  heedlessness  and  the 
second, in terror, like progressing step by step to the gallows. Whereas for 
the balance to be preserved between this world and the next, and to remain 
perpetually between hope and fear, to live or die every moment has to be 
possible.  In  which  case,  twenty  years  of  uncertain  life  are  preferable  to  a 
thousand years of life that are speciﬁed. 

Thus, the Last Day is the appointed hour of the world, the macroanthro-
pos.  If  the  time  had  been  speciﬁed,  all  the  Early  Ages  and  Middle  Ages 
would have been plunged into absolute heedlessness, and the latter centu-
ries, into terror. Just as in his personal life man is concerned with the contin-
ued existence of his home and village, so in his social life and as a member 
of humankind he is concerned with the continued existence of the earth and 
the world. The Qur’an says,

1.  See, M u s l i m , Janna, 31; M u s n a d , iii, 341, 346.

388

THE WORDS

( 54:1 ) } |
That is, Doomsday is near.The fact that it still has not occurred after a thou-
sand or this many years does not negate its nearness. For it is the appointed 
hour of the world, and in relation to the life of the world one or two thousand 
years are like one or two days or one or two minutes in relation to a year. It is 
not only the appointed hour of humankind that it should be related to it and 
seen as distant. It is because of this that the Absolutely Wise One conceals 
Doomsday in His knowledge among the Five Hidden Things. It is due to 
the mystery of this vagueness that every age including the Age of the Bliss, 
the Age of the Prophet ( UWBP ), people have been frightened of the end of 
the world. Some of them even said that the conditions had all but appeared.
Thus,  unfair  people  who  do  not  know  this  truth  say:  “ Why  with  their 
vigilant hearts and keen sight did the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) Companions, who 
had  been  taught  all  the  details  of  the  hereafter,  suppose  a  fact  that  would 
occur one thousand four hundred years later to be close to their century, as 
though their ideas had deviated a thousand years from the truth? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  Because, through the effulgence of the Prophet’s conver-
sation,  the  Companions  thought  of  the  hereafter  more  than  anyone.  They 
knew the world’s transience and understood the divine wisdom in the hour  
of  Doomsday  being  vague,  so  they  assumed  a  stance  of  always  awaiting 
the world’s appointed hour and worked seriously for the hereafter. Allah’s 
Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) repeatedly used to 
say: “ Expect Doomsday. Wait for it ” which was prophetic guidance arising 
from this wisdom, not a pronouncement of Revelation concerning the spe-
ciﬁc time of its occurrence, thus being far from the truth. The cause or occa-
sion is one thing and the wisdom or underlying purpose is another. This sort 
of utterance of the Prophet ( UWBP ) was related to the wisdom in inexplicit 
and ambiguous statements.

It is also due to this mystery that the persons who will come at the end 
of time like the Mahdi and Sufyan were expected long beforehand, even 
in  the  time  of  the  generation  succeeding  the  Prophet  ( UWBP ),  and  the 
people hoped to live long enough to see them. Some of the saints, even, 
said that they had passed. Divine wisdom requires that the times of these 
persons are not speciﬁed, as with the end of the world. For every age is in 
need of the Mahdi’s signiﬁcance, for he strengthens morale and saves the 
people from despair. Every century needs a share of this. Moreover, every 
century the fearsome persons who appear to lead strife should be shrunk 

TWENTY-FOURTH WORD – THIRD BRANCH

389

from and feared, so that people do not heedlessly follow evil nor indiffer-
ently let free the reins of the soul. If such persons had been speciﬁed, the 
beneﬁts of general guidance would have been lost.

Now, the difference in the narrations about persons like the Mahdi, and 
their meaning, is this: the expounders of Hadiths applied the Hadith texts 
to  their  own  interpretations  and  commentaries.  For  example,  at  that  time 
Damascus  and  Medina  were  the  centres  of  power,  so  they  imagined  that 
the  events  connected  with  the  Mahdi  and  Sufyan  would  occur  in  places 
like Basra, Kufa, and Syria, which were in the region of those centres, and 
expounded them accordingly. Moreover, they imagined the mighty works 
belonging to the collective identity or community which those ﬁgures repre-
sent, to belong to their persons and they expounded them thus. They there-
fore ascribed those extraordinary individuals a form to them whereby when 
appear, everyone will recognize them. However, as we said, this world is 
the arena of trial. The door is opened to the reason, but the will is not taken 
from the hand. So, when those persons, even the terrible Dajjal, appear, to 
start with many people and Dajjal himself even will not know that he is the 
Dajjal. Those ﬁgures of the end of time will be known through the insight 
and light of belief.

It is narrated in a Hadith about the Dajjal, who is one of the signs of the 
end of time: “ His ﬁrst day is like a year, his second day like a month, his 
third day like a week, and his fourth day like other days. When he appears  
the world will hear. He will travel the world in forty days. ” 1 Some unfair 
people have said about this narration that it is impossible, Allah forbid, and

have gone as far as to deny it and to declare it null. Whereas, ِ
the truth of it must be this:

It indicates the appearance of a person from the north who will come to 
lead a great current issuing forth from the godless ideas of naturalism, in the 
north, where the world of unbelief is at its densest, and who will be athe-
ist. There is an instance of wisdom in this, for in the latitudes close to the 
North Pole the whole year is one day and one night; there are six months 
of night and six months of day. “ One day of the Dajjal is a year ” alludes 
to his appearance close to those latitudes. What is meant from “ His second 
day is a month ” is that passing in this direction from the north, it sometimes 
happens that for a month in the summer the sun does not set. This suggests

THE WORDS

that the Dajjal will emerge in the north and invade southwards towards the 
civilized  world.  By  attributing  the  day  to  the  Dajjal,  it  points  to  this.  He 
comes further in this direction, and the sun does not set for a week, and so it 
continues until there are three hours between its rising and setting. I was in 
such a place while being held in Russia as a prisoner-of-war. Near to us was 
a place where the sun did not set for a week. They used to go there to watch 
it. As for the part, “ When the Dajjal appears, all the world will hear of it, ” 
the telegraph and radio have solved it. As for his travelling the world in forty 
days, this has been solved by the railway and aeroplane, his mounts. Deniers 
who  formerly  considered  these  two  statements  to  be  impossible,  now  see 
them as commonplace!

Since  in  another  treatise  I  have  written  in  some  detail  about  Gog  and 
Magog and the Barrier, which are among the signs of the end of the world, 
I refer readers to those and here only say this: there are narrations stating 
that the tribes known as the Manchurians and Mongols, who threw human 
society into chaos and were the cause of the building of the Great Wall of 
China, will again overturn human civilization close to Doomsday with an 
idea like anarchy.

Some atheists say: “ Where are the tribes that perform these extraordinary 

acts and that will perform them? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  A calamity like locusts appears in one season in enormous 
numbers, then on the change of the seasons, those numerous tribes which 
disrupt the country consign their reality to a few limited individuals. Then, 
when the time comes, at the divine command, great numbers appear from  
those limited individuals and embark on the same corruption. As though the 
reality of their national identity is ﬁned down, but not destroyed, and when 
the time arrives, it reemerges. In just the same way, those same tribes which 
overturned the world at one time will when the time comes again overturn 
human civilization with divine permission. But what impels them will be in 

a different form. ُ

to this restricted, narrow world, while others look to the world of the here-

of  either  encouraging  or  restraining,  some  Hadiths  about  the  merits  and 
rewards of actions are in an eloquent style and some unthinking people have 
supposed them to be exaggerated. However, since they are all pure truth and 
reality, they contain no exaggeration or overstatement.

For instance, this Hadith has worried the heads of the unfair more than 

any. 

ٍءاَ(cid:174) َةَ(cid:150)ْرُ(cid:106) اَ(cid:183)ْ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174) ُرِ(cid:158)اﯬﯧْ(cid:170)ا  َبِرَ(cid:130) اَ(cid:174) ٍةَ(cid:138)وُ(cid:151)َ(cid:92)  َحاَ(cid:179)َ(cid:106) ِ

ّد(cid:170)ا  ِتَ(cid:178)ِزَو ْوَ(cid:170)

The sense of it is: “ If the world had the value of a ﬂy’s wing for Almighty 
Allah, the unbelievers would not have had so much as a mouthful of water 
ّ(cid:195)ا َدْ(cid:179)ِ(cid:150) refers to the eternal realm. 
from it. ” 1 The truth of it is this: the phrase ِ
Yes, since a light as small as a ﬂy’s wing from the eternal realm is everlast-
ing, it is greater than a temporary light that ﬁlls the face of the earth. It is 
not to say that the huge world is equal to a ﬂy’s wing, but that everyone’s 
private world which is situated within their short lives, is not equal to even a 
tiny amount – a ﬂy’s wing – of an everlasting divine effulgence and bounty 
from the eternal realm. 

Furthermore,  the  world  has  two  faces,  indeed,  three  faces.  One  is  the 
mirror to Almighty Allah’s names, another looks to the hereafter and is its 
arable ﬁeld, and the third looks to transience and non-existence. This latter is 
the world of the people of misguidance which is not in accordance with the 
things that please Allah that we know. That is to say, the Hadith infers that 
the world of those who worship the world, which is opposed to the hereafter 
and is the source of all wrongs and the spring of calamities, is not worth a 
single everlasting particle that will be given to the believers in the hereafter, 
not the vast world which is the mirror to the most beautiful names, consists 
of missives of the Eternally Besought One, and is the tillage of the hereafter. 
Thus, how can the unfair atheists’ understanding be compared with this most 
true  and  serious  truth?  What  has  the  exaggerated  and  overstated  meaning 
they fancy to do with this?

And,  for  example,  the  unfair  atheists  have  also  supposed  narrations  
about the rewards for actions and merits of some of the Qur’an’s suras to 
be  exaggeration  and  even  impossible  overstatement.  For  instance,  there 
are narrations that state: “ Sura al-Fatiha is equal in merit to the Qur’an; ” 2 
“ Sura al-Ikhlas equals a third of the Qur’an, ” “ Sura al-Zilzal, a quarter, ” 
“ Sura al-Kaﬁrun, a quarter, ” “ Sura Ya. Sin., ten times the Qur’an. ” Unjust, 
unthinking people have said this is impossible because Sura Ya. Sin. and the 
other meritorious suras are part of the Qur’an, which makes the narrations 
meaningless.

THE WORDS

T h e   A n s w e r :  The truth is this: for each of the All-Wise Qur’an’s letters 
is a merit. Each is a good deed. Out of divine grace the merits of those letters 
sprout and yield sometimes ten, sometimes seventy, and sometimes seven 
hundred, merits, like the letters of Ay a t   a l - K u r s i . Sometimes they yield one 
thousand ﬁve hundred, like the letters of Sura al-Ikhlas, and sometimes ten 
thousand, like verses recited on the Night of Acquittal and those that coin-
cide with other acceptable times. And sometimes they yield thirty thousand, 
like verses recited on the Night of Power, which are like poppy seeds in their 
multiplicity. This is understood from the verse indicating that that night was 
2  1  0  /  ( 97:3 ) : a single letter on that night yields thirty thousand 
merits. Thus, with its multiplication of merits the All-Wise Qur’an is surely 
incomparable, comparisons cannot be made with it. Nevertheless, parallels 
may  be  drawn  between  its  essential  merits  and  some  suras.  For  example, 
let us suppose there is a ﬁeld planted with maize, one thousand plants of it. 
If some seeds produce seven shoots and from each shoot a hundred grains 
appear, then a single seed becomes the equivalent of two thirds of the whole 
ﬁeld.  Or,  if  one  seed  produces  ten  shoots,  and  each  yields  two  hundred 
grains, then a single seed is the equivalent of twice the original ﬁeld. You 
can make further analogies in the same way.

Now,  let  us  imagine  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  to  be  a  luminous,  sacred, 
heavenly  ﬁeld.  Each  of  its  letters  together  with  its  original  merit  is  like 
a  seed.  Their  shoots  will  not  be  taken  into  consideration.  They  may  be 
compared with the suras and verses about which are narrations concerning 
their merits, like Ya. Sin., Ikhlas, Fatiha, Kaﬁrun, Zilzal. For example, the 
Qur’an  has  three  hundred  thousand  six  hundred  and  twenty  letters,  and 
Sura al-Ikhlas together with B i s m i l l a h , sixty-nine. Three times sixty-nine is 
two hundred and seven letters, so the merits of each letter of Sura al-Ikhlas 
number nearly one thousand ﬁve hundred. Thus, if Sura Ya. Sin.’s letters 
are reckoned and compared with all the letters of the All-Wise Qur’an, and 
then multiplied ten times, it produces the following result: each letter of  
Sura Ya. Sin. has close on ﬁve hundred merits. That is, good deeds to that 
number may be reckoned. And so, if you apply the others to this, you will 
understand what a subtle, ﬁne, true, and unexaggerated truth it is.

Tenth Principle

TENTH  PRINCIPLE:  Like  with  most  of  the  other  sorts  of  creatures, 
there are among humankind certain individuals who are extraordinary by 
virtue of their acts and deeds. If they have advanced in good deeds, they 
have  been  the  cause  of  pride  of  humankind.  Otherwise,  they  have  been 
the cause of humanity’s shame. Also, they are hidden. It is as though each 
becomes a collective identity, an imaginary goal. Other individuals try to 

TWENTY-FOURTH WORD – THIRD BRANCH

393

emulate them, and it is possible. This means that since they are absolute 
and indeﬁnite, it is possible for such perfect, extraordinary persons to be 
present  everywhere.  In  regard  to  this  indeﬁniteness,  according  to  logic, 
their  universality  may  be  posited  in  the  form  of  a  possible  proposition. 
That is, it is possible for all acts to produce the following result: for exam-
ple, “ Whoever performs two r a k ’ a t s  of prayers at such and such a time has 
performed the equivalent of the Hajj. ” 1 It is thus the truth that at certain 
times two r a k ’ a t s  of prayers may be the equivalent of the Hajj. Due to its 
universality,  this  meaning  may  apply  to  all  prayers  of  two  r a k ’ a t s .  This 
means that what narrations of this sort refer to is not in fact continuous and 
universal; this is disallowed because there are conditions of acceptance. It 
is either temporary and absolute or possible and universal. That is to say, 
the universality in this sort of Hadith is in regard to possibility. For exam-
ple, “ Backbiting is like murder. ” This means, there is a sort of backbiting 
that is more harmful than deadly poison, like a killer. And for example, 
“ A good word is a deed so good it is like freeing a slave. ” 2 Here, in order 
to encourage and motivate, it points out the possibility of the unspeciﬁc 
perfect individual being present everywhere in absolute form as though it 
is actually the case, thus arousing eagerness for good and disgust for evil. 
Furthermore, the things of the eternal world cannot be measured with the 
scales of this world. The greatest thing here is not equal to the least thing 
there. The merits of actions look to that world; our worldly view is too nar-
row for them; we cannot ﬁt them into our minds. For example,

THE WORDS

inﬁnitely needy servants in the world of eternity and everlasting happiness 
in return for a single invocation may be equal to the reward of those two, but 
equal to the rewards as we conceive of them and surmise them to be. 

For example, there is a primitive, uncouth man who has never seen the 
king and does not know the majesty of his rule. He imagines a village head-
man, and with his limited ideas thinks of the king as a more exalted version 
of him. Long ago with us even, there was a simple-minded tribe who used to 
say: “ Our chief knows what the sultan does as he cooks his bulgur soup on 
his stove in a saucepan. ” That is to say, they imagined the sultan in such a 
narrow situation and so common a form that he cooked his own wheat soup; 
they supposed him to have the grandness of a captain. Now, if someone were 
to say to a member of the tribe: “ If you do this job for me today, I’ll give 
you as much grandeur as you think the sultan has; that is, a rank as high as a 
captain. ” To say that is right, because with his limited mind, the tribesman 
can only conceive of the grandeur of kingship as the grandness of a captain.
Thus,  with  our  worldly  views  and  narrow  minds,  we  cannot  envisage 
the true rewards which look to the hereafter, even as much as that primitive 
man. We cannot reckon the true rewards of Moses and Aaron ( Upon whom 
be peace ), which are unknown to us. For according to the rule of similes and 
comparisons, the unknown is compared to the known. So the true reward, 
which we do not know, for an invocation of one of Allah’s believing serv-
ants is compared with the rewards that we do know and may surmise. 

Moreover,  the  surface  of  the  sea  and  the  heart  of  a  droplet  are  equal 
when it comes to holding a total reﬂection of the sun. The difference is only 
in  quality.  The  reward  reﬂected  in  the  mirrors  of  the  ocean-like  spirits  of 
Moses and Aaron ( Upon whom be peace ) is exactly the same in nature as 
the reward that a believing servant, who is like a droplet, receives from a 
Qur’anic verse. They are the same in nature and quantity, while their quality 
is dependent on capacity. 

Also,  it  sometimes  happens  that  a  single  word,  a  single  gloriﬁcation, 
opens a treasury of happiness that does not open with sixty years of striving. 
That is to say, it sometimes happens that a single verse may be as beneﬁcial 
as the Qur’an. 

Also, the divine effulgence which Allah’s Noble Messenger ( UWBP ), 
who manifested the greatest name, received from a single verse, may have 
been as much as all the effulgence one of the other prophets ever received. 
And it would not be contrary to the truth to say that a believer who through 
the  legacy  of  prophethood  manifests  the  shadow  of  the  greatest  name, 

TWENTY-FOURTH WORD – THIRD BRANCH

395

receives, in accordance with his own capacity and in regard to quantity, a 
reward as great as a prophet’s effulgence. Furthermore, reward and merit are 
from the World of Light, and one world from that world may be contained in 
a speck. Just as the heavens and all its stars may appear in a tiny fragment of 
glass, so reward and merit as luminous as the heavens may be contained in 
an invocation or verse which acquires transparency through a pure intention.
C o n c l u s i o n :   O  unfair,  unthinking,  self-centred,  cavilling  man  whose 
belief is weak and philosophy, strong! Consider these ten principles, then 
don’t make a narration you thought was contrary to the truth and opposed 
to reality the pretext for objecting to Hadiths, thus casting aspersions on the 
Noble Messenger’s ( UWBP ) sinlessness! Firstly, these ten principles and 
what they entail will make you give up your denial. They say: “ If there is 
any real fault, it is ours, ” it may not be ascribed to the Hadiths. They say too: 
“ If the fault is not real, it springs from your misunderstanding. ” In short; 
if anyone undertakes to deny and reject them, he has ﬁrst to deny these ten 
principles and show them to be false. Now, if you are fair, having studied 
these  principles  with  due  attention,  do  not  attempt  to  deny  a  Hadith  your 
reason considers to be contrary to the truth! Say: “ There is either an expla-
nation, or an interpretation, or an exegesis of this, ” and do not criticize it!

Eleventh Principle

ELEVENTH PRINCIPLE: Just as the Qur’an has obscure verses which 
are  in  need  of  interpretation  or  else  require  absolute  submission,  Hadiths 
also contain difﬁculties like the obscurities of the Qur’an. They are some-
times in need of extremely careful expounding and interpretation. The above 
examples may be sufﬁcient for you.

Yes, someone who is awake interprets the dream of someone else who 
is sleeping, and sometimes someone who is sleeping hears the words spo-
ken by others nearby him who are awake, but he gives them some mean-
ing and interprets them in a way that applies to his own world of sleep. 
O  man  stupiﬁed  by  the  sleep  of  heedlessness  and  philosophy!  Do  not  
deny in your dream what the Being saw who manifested the meaning of, 
َ(cid:202)َو يِ(cid:179)ْ(cid:193)َ(cid:150) ُماَ(cid:179)َ(cid:98)  1 and who was truly

awake  and  aware;  interpret  it.  Yes,  if  a  mosquito  bites  someone  who  is 
asleep, the person sometimes dreams that he has received terrible wounds 
in war and this has a reality in sleep. If he is questioned, he says: “ Truly 
I have been wounded. Guns and riﬂes were ﬁred at me. ” Those sitting by

THE WORDS

him laugh at his anguish in sleep. Thus, the sleep-stained view of heed-
lessness and philosophical thought certainly cannot be the criterion for the 
truths of prophethood.

Twelfth Principle

TWELFTH  PRINCIPLE:  Since  prophethood,  the  afﬁrmation  of  divine 
unity, and belief all look to unity, the hereafter, and the Godhead, they see 
truth and reality accordingly. While philosophers and scientists look to mul-
tiplicity, causes, and nature, and see in accordance with them. Their points 
of view are extremely distant from one another. The greatest aim of the peo-
ple of philosophy is so small and insigniﬁcant as to be imperceptible among 
the aims of the scholars of religion and theology.

It  is  because  of  this  that  scientists  have  advanced  greatly  in  detailed 
explanation of the nature of beings and their minutest states, but they are so 
far behind the exalted divine sciences and sciences concerned with the here-
after, which are true wisdom and knowledge, that they are more backward 
than a simple believer. People who do not understand this mystery suppose 
the investigative scholars of Islam to be backward relatively to the philoso-
phers. But how can those whose minds see no further than their eyes and 
are submerged in multiplicity reach those who follow elevated sacred aims 
through the legacy of prophethood?

Furthermore, when something is considered from two points of view, it 
shows two different truths, and both of them may be the truth. No certain 
fact of science can touch the sacred truths of the Qur’an. The short hand of 
science cannot reach up to its pure sublimity. We shall mention an example 
to illustrate this.

For  example,  if  the  globe  of  the  earth  is  considered  from  the  point  of 
view of the people of science, its reality is this: as a middle-sized planet, it 
revolves around the sun amid countless stars; it is a small creature in rela-
tion to the stars. But as is explained in the Fifteenth Word, if it is consid-
ered from the point of view of the people of the Qur’an, its reality is this: 
since man, the fruit of the world, is a most comprehensive, most wondrous, 
most  impotent,  most  weak,  and  most  subtle  miracle  of  divine  power,  the  
earth,  his  cradle  and  dwelling-place,  is  in  regard  to  meaning  and  art,  the 
universe’s heart and centre; despite its smallness and lowliness in relation 
to the heavens, it is the display and exhibition of all the miracles of divine 
art; the place of reﬂection and point of focus of the manifestations of all the 
divine names; the place of display and reﬂection of inﬁnite dominical activ-
ity; the means and market of boundless divine creativity and especially the 
muniﬁcent  creation  of  the  numerous  species  of  plants  and  small  animals; 

TWENTY-FOURTH WORD – FOURTH BRANCH

397

and  the  place  in  small  measure  of  samples  of  the  creatures  of  the  broad 
worlds  of  the  hereafter;  it  is  a  rapidly  working  loom  weaving  everlasting 
textiles; the swiftly changing place producing views for eternal panoramas; 
and the narrow and temporary arable ﬁeld and seedbed producing at speed 
the seeds for everlasting gardens.

It  is  because  of  this  vastness  of  meaning  and  importance  of  art  of  the 
earth that the All-Wise Qur’an holds it – like a tiny fruit of the vast tree of 
the heavens – equal to all the heavens, like holding a tiny heart equivalent to 
a huge body. It places it in one pan of a scales and places all the heavens in 
the other, and repeatedly says: P O N ( 18:14, etc. ) . Compare other 
matters with this and understand that the soulless, dim truths of philosophy 
cannot clash with the brilliant, living truths of the Qur’an. Since the points 
of view are different, they appear differently.

We shall point out only a single jewel from the treasure of this extensive 

and sublime verse. It is as follows.

The All-Wise Qur’an states clearly that everything from the heavens to 
the  earth,  from  the  stars  to  ﬂies,  from  angels  to  ﬁshes,  and  from  planets 
to particles, prostrates, worships, praises and gloriﬁes Almighty Allah. But 
their worship varies according to their capacities and the divine names that 
they manifest; it is all different. We shall explain one of the varieties of their 
worship with a comparison.

For example, ( 16:60 )  j  i  h when a mighty lord of all dominion 

builds a city or splendid palace, he employs four categories of workers.

The First Category are his slaves and bondsmen. This sort receive no  
wage or remuneration, but for each item of work that they carry out at their 
lord’s command, they experience a subtle pleasure and pleasant eagerness. 
Whatever they utter by way of praise and description of their lord increases 
their pleasure and eagerness. Knowing their connection with their holy lord 
to be a great honour, they content themselves with that. They ﬁnd pleasure 

398

THE WORDS

from looking to their work with the view of their lord, and for his sake and 
in his name. They are in no need of any wage, rank, or remuneration.

The  Second  Category  are  ordinary  servants.  They  do  not  know  why 
they are working or that they are being employed by the glorious lord. He 
causes them to work through his own ideas and knowledge and gives them 
an  appropriately  small  wage.  These  servants  are  unaware  of  the  various, 
comprehensive aims and exalted matters that result from their work. Some 
of them even imagine that their work concerns themselves alone and has no 
aim besides their wage.

The Third Category: The lord of all dominion has some animals which 
he  employs  in  various  jobs  in  the  construction  of  the  city  and  palace.  He 
only gives them fodder, but their working at tasks suitable for their abilities 
gives them pleasure. For if a potentiality or ability is realized in action and 
work, there is a breathing in and expansion and this results in pleasure. The 
pleasure to be had from all activity stems from this. The wage and remunera-
tion of this sort of servant, then, is only fodder and that pleasure. They are 
content with that.

The Fourth Category are workers who know what they are doing, and 
why and for whom they are working, and why the other workers are work-
ing, and what the purpose of the lord of all dominion is and why he is caus-
ing  them  to  work.  Workers  of  this  category  are  therefore  the  bosses  and 
supervisors of the other workers. They receive remuneration that is graded 
according to their rank and degree.

In exactly the same way, the Sustainer of All the Worlds, Who is the All-
Glorious Lord of the heavens and the earth and the All-Beauteous Builder 
of this world and the hereafter, employs both angels, and animals, and inani-
mate beings and plants, and human beings in the palace of this world, in this 
realm of causality. He employs them not out of need, for the Creator of eve-
rything is He, but for certain instances of wisdom such as the functioning of 
His might, sublimity, and dominicality. He causes them to worship and has 
charged these four categories with their different duties of worship.

THE FIRST CATEGORY: is the angels, who are represented in the com-
parison by the slaves. For the angels there is no striving and progress; they 
all  have  their  ﬁxed  station  and  determined  rank,  and  receive  a  particular 
pleasure from the work itself and an emanation from their worship accord-
ing to their rank. That is to say, the reward of these servants is found within 
their  duties.  Just  as  man  is  nourished  by  air,  water,  light,  and  food,  and 
receives pleasure from them, so are the angels nourished by the varieties of 

TWENTY-FOURTH WORD – FOURTH BRANCH

399

remembrance, gloriﬁcation, praise, worship, knowledge, and love of Allah, 
and they take pleasure in them. For, since they are created out of light, light 
is sufﬁcient for their sustenance. Fragrant scents, even, which are close to 
light,  are  a  sort  of  nourishment  for  them  which  they  enjoy.  Indeed,  good 
spirits take pleasure in sweet smells.

Furthermore, present in the tasks that the angels perform at the command 
of the One Whom they worship, in the work they accomplish for His sake, 
in the service they discharge in His name, in the supervision they execute 
through His favour, in the honour they gain through their connection with 
Him, in the immaculateness they attain through studying His dominion in 
both its outer face and its face which looks to Him, and in the ease they ﬁnd 
through beholding the manifestations of His beauty and glory, is such sub-
lime bliss that the human mind cannot comprehend it and one who is not an 
angel cannot perceive it.

One sort of the angels are worshippers, and the worship of another sort 
is  work.  Of  the  angels  of  the  earth,  the  sort  that  are  workers  have  a  kind 
of human occupation. If one may say so, one type are like shepherds and 
another like farmers. That is to say, the face of the earth resembles a general 
farm and an appointed angel supervises all the species of animals within it at 
the command of the Glorious Creator, and with His permission, for His sake 
and through His power and strength. And for each species of animal there is 
a lesser angel who is appointed to act as a special shepherd.

The face of the earth is also a place of cultivation; all the plants grow in 
it. There is an angel charged with supervising them in the name  of Allah 
Almighty and through His power, and there are angels who are lesser than 
him and who worship and glorify Allah by supervising particular species. 
The Archangel Michael ( Upon whom be peace ), who is one of the bearers 
of the throne of sustenance, is the most important overseer of these.

The angels who are in the position of shepherd and farmer do not bear 
any  resemblance  to  human  beings,  for  their  supervision  is  purely  for  the 
sake of Almighty Allah, and in His name and through His power and com-
mand.  Their  supervision  consists  only  in  beholding  the  manifestations  of 
dominicality in the species where they are employed; studying the manifes-
tations of power and mercy in it; making known to that species the divine 
commands by way of a sort of inspiration; and in some way ordering the 
voluntary actions of the species.

Their  supervision  of  the  plants  in  the  ﬁeld  of  the  earth  in  particular 
consists  in  representing  the  plants’  gloriﬁcation  in  the  angelic  tongue; 

400

THE WORDS

proclaiming  in  the  angelic  tongue  the  salutations  the  plants  offer  to  the 
All-Glorious Creator through their lives; and employing the faculties given 
to plants correctly and directing them towards certain aims and ordering 
them  to  some  extent.  These  duties  of  the  angels  are  meritorious  actions 
of a sort by reason of the angels’ faculty of will. Indeed, they are a kind 
of worship and adoration. But the angels have no real power of disposal, 
for on everything is a stamp peculiar to the Creator of all things. No other 
being’s hand can interfere in creation. That is to say, this sort of work of 
the angels forms their worship. It is not a custom like with human beings.
THE SECOND CATEGORY of workers in this palace of the universe 
are animals. Since animals also have an appetitive soul and faculty of will, 
their work is not purely for the sake of Allah; to some extent, they take a 
share for their souls. Therefore, since the Glorious and Muniﬁcent Lord 
of All Dominion is all-generous, He bestows a wage on them during their 
work so that their souls receive a share. For example, the All-Wise Creator 
employs the famous nightingale,  1 renowned for his love of the rose, for 
ﬁve aims.

F i r s t   A i m :  It is the ofﬁcial employed to proclaim in the name of the ani-
mal species the intense relationship that exists between them and the plant 
species.

S e c o n d   A i m :  It is a dominical orator from among the animals, who are 
like guests of the All-Merciful One needy for sustenance, and is employed 
to acclaim the gifts sent by the All-Generous Provider and to announce their 
joy.

T h i r d   A i m :  It is to announce to everyone the welcome offered to plants, 

which are sent for the assistance of its fellow animals.

F o u r t h   A i m :  It is to announce over the blessed heads of the plants and 
to  their  beautiful,  the  intense  need  of  the  animal  species  for  them,  which 
reaches the degree of love and passion.

F i f t h  A i m :  It is to present with acute yearning at the court of mercy of the 
All-Glorious, Beauteous, Muniﬁcent Lord of All Dominion a truly graceful 
gloriﬁcation inspired by the delicate face of the rose.

There  are  further  meanings  similar  to  these  ﬁve  aims  and  they  are  the 
purpose  of  the  deeds  the  nightingale  performs  for  the  sake  of  Truth  ( All 
glory be unto Him and may He be exalted ). The nightingale speaks in his

But it is not imaginary, it is the truth.

TWENTY-FOURTH WORD – FOURTH BRANCH

401

own tongue, but we understand these meanings from his plaintive words. If  
he himself does not altogether know the meaning of his own song like the 
angels and spirit beings understand it, it does not impair our understanding. 
The saying, “ One who listens understands better than the one who speaks ” 
is well-known. Also, the nightingale’s not knowing these aims in detail does 
not mean that they do not exist. At least he informs you of them like a clock 
informs you of the time. What difference does it make if he is not aware of 
them? It does not prevent you from knowing.

However, the nightingale’s small wage is the delight he experiences from 
gazing  on  the  smiling,  beautiful  roses,  and  the  pleasure  he  receives  from 
conversing with them and pouring out his woes. That is to say, his sorrow-
ful song is not a complaint arising from animal grief, it is thanks in return 
for the Most Merciful’s gifts. Compare the bee, the spider, the ant, creep-
ing  insects,  the  male  animals  that  are  the  means  of  reproduction,  and  the 
nightingales of all small creatures, with the nightingale: the deeds of all of 
them have numerous aims. For them, too, a particular pleasure, like a wage, 
has been included in their duties. By virtue of that pleasure, they serve the 
important aims contained in dominical art. Just as an ordinary seaman acts 
as helmsman on an imperial ship and receives a small wage, so do the ani-
mals employed in duties of gloriﬁcation each receive a small wage.

A n   A d d e n d u m   t o   t h e   D i s c u s s i o n   o n   t h e   N i g h t i n g a l e :  However, do not 
suppose this proclaiming and heralding and these songs of gloriﬁcation are 
peculiar  to  the  nightingale.  In  most  species  there  is  a  class  similar  to  the 
nightingale that consists of a ﬁne individual or individuals which represent 
the species’ ﬁnest feelings with the ﬁnest gloriﬁcation and ﬁnest poetry. The 
nightingales of ﬂies and insects, in particular, are both numerous and vari-
ous. Through their humming poetry they make all animals with ears, from 
the largest to the smallest, hear their gloriﬁcations and give them pleasure. 
Some of them are nocturnal. These poetry-declaiming friends of all small 
animals are their sweet-voiced orators when all beings are plunged into the 
silence and tranquillity of the night. Each is the centre of a circle of silent 
recollection, an assembly in solitude, to which all the others listen, and, in 
a fashion, recollect and extol the All-Glorious Creator in their own hearts.

Another sort are diurnal. By day, in spring and summer, they proclaim 
the mercy of the Most Merciful and Compassionate to all animate beings 
from  the  pulpits  of  the  trees  with  their  ringing  voices,  subtle  songs,  and 
poetic gloriﬁcations. It is as if, like the leader of a gathering for the reci-
tation  of  Allah’s  names  induces  the  ecstasy  of  those  participating,  all  the 

402

THE WORDS

creatures listening start to praise the All-Glorious Creator each in its own 
special tongue and with a particular chant.

That is to say, every sort of being, even the stars, have a chief reciter  and 
light-scattering nightingale. But the most excellent, the most noble, the most 
luminous, the most dazzling, the greatest and the most honourable nightin-
gale, whose voice was the most ringing, whose attributes the most brilliant, 
whose recitation the most complete, whose thanks the most universal, whose 
essence was the most perfect, and whose form was the most beautiful, who 
brought all the beings of the heavens and the earth in the garden of the uni-
verse to ecstasy and rapture through his subtle poetry, his sweet song, his 
exalted gloriﬁcation, was the glorious nightingale of humankind, the night-
ingale of the Qur’an: Muhammad the Arabian, 

ِتا َ(cid:175)ـ(cid:193)ِ(cid:171) ْ(cid:127)َ

ّ(cid:99)(cid:170)ا  ُل َ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:106)َاَو ِة َ(cid:203) َ

T o   C o n c l u d e :  The animals, who serve in the palace of the universe, con-
form with complete obedience to the creational commands and display per-
fectly in the name of Almighty Allah the aims included in their natures. The 
gloriﬁcation and worship they perform by carrying out the duties related to 
their lives in this wonderful fashion through the power of Allah Almighty, 
are gifts and salutations which they present to the court of the All-Glorious 
Creator, the Bestower of Life.

THE  THIRD  CATEGORY  OF  WORKERS  are  plants  and  inanimate 
creatures. They have no faculty of will and therefore receive no wage. Their 
work is purely for the sake of Allah, and in His name, on His account, and 
through His will, power and strength. However, it may be perceived from 
their growth and development that they receive a sort of pleasure from their 
duties of pollination and producing seeds and fruits. But they experience no 
pain at all. Due to their will, animals experience pain as well as pleasure. 
Since  will  has  no  place  in  the  work  of  plants  and  inanimate  beings,  their 
work is more perfect than that of animals, who have will. Among those who 
possess  will,  the  work  of  creatures  like  the  bee  which  are  enlightened  by 
Revelation and inspiration is more perfect than the work of those animals 
which rely on their faculty of will. 

All the species of plants in the ﬁeld of the face of the earth pray and ask of 
the All-Wise Creator through their tongues of disposition and potentiality: 
“ O our Sustainer! Give us strength so that by raising the ﬂag of our species 
in every part of the earth, we may proclaim the splendour of Your domini-
cality; and grant us prosperity so that we may worship You in every corner 

TWENTY-FOURTH WORD – FOURTH BRANCH

403

of the mosque of the earth; and bestow on us the power to spread and travel 
in order to exhibit through our particular tongue the embroideries of Your 
most beautiful names and Your wonderful, antique arts. ”

The  All-Wise  Creator  answers  their  silent  prayer  and  bestows  on  the 
seeds of one species tiny wings made of hair: they ﬂy away spreading every-
where. They cause the divine names to be read in the name of their species. 
( Like the seeds of most thorned plants and some yellow ﬂowers. ) He gives 
to some species beautiful ﬂesh that is either necessary or pleasant for human 
beings; He causes man to serve them and plant them everywhere. To some 
He gives, covering a hard and indigestible bone, ﬂesh that animals eat so that 
they disperse the seeds over a wide area. On some He bestows small claws 
that grip onto everything that touches them; moving on to other places, they 
raise the ﬂag of the species and exhibit the antique art of the All-Glorious 
Maker. And to some species, like to the bitter melon, He gives the force of a 
buckshot riﬂe so that, when the time is ripe, the small melons which are its 
fruits, fall and ﬁre out their seeds like shot to a distance of several metres, 
and  sow  them.  They  work  so  that  numerous  tongues  will  glorify  the  All-
Glorious  Creator  and  recite  His  beautiful  names.  You  may  think  of  other 
examples in the same way.

The All-Wise Creator, Who is All-Powerful and All-Knowing, has cre-
ated everything beautifully and with perfect order. He has ﬁtted them out 
beautifully,  turned  their  faces  towards  beautiful  aims,  employed  them  in 
beautiful duties, caused them to utter beautiful gloriﬁcations and to worship 
beautifully. O man! If indeed you are a human being, do not confuse nature, 
chance, futility, and misguidance with these beautiful matters. Do not make 
them ugly. Do not act in an ugly fashion. Do not be ugly!

THE FOURTH CATEGORY are human beings. Human beings, who are 
servants  of  a  sort  in  the  palace  of  the  universe,  resemble  both  angels  and 
animals.  They  resemble  angels  in  universality  of  worship,  extensiveness 
of supervision, comprehensiveness of knowledge, and in being heralds of 
divine dominicality. However, man is more comprehensive in his worship, 
but since he has an appetitive soul that is disposed towards evil, contrary to 
the angels, he is subject to progress and decline, and this is of great impor-
tance. Also, since in his work man seeks pleasure for his soul and a share for 
himself, he resembles an animal. Since this is so, he receives two wages: the 
ﬁrst is insigniﬁcant, animal, and immediate; the second, angelic, universal, 
and postponed.

404

THE WORDS

Now, man’s duty and his wages, and his progress and decline, have been 
discussed in part in all thirty-three of the Words, and have been explained 
in greater detail in the Eleventh and Twenty-Third Words in particular. We 
shall therefore cut short the discussion here and close the door. And beseech-
ing the Most Merciful to open to us the gates of His mercy and grace us with 
the ability to complete this Word, and seeking forgiveness for our faults and 
errors, we conclude it here.

The Fifth Branch has ﬁve fruits.

First Fruit

FIRST FRUIT

O my self-worshipping soul! O my world-worshipping friend! Love is 
the cause of the universe’s existence and what binds it, and it is both the 
light of the universe and its life. Man is the most comprehensive fruit of 
the universe, hence a love that will conquer the universe has been included 
in his heart, the seed of that fruit. Thus, only a being that possesses inﬁnite 
perfection may be worthy of such an inﬁnite love. 

O soul and O friend! Two faculties, through which one may experience 
fear and love, have been included in human nature. This love and fear are 
bound  to  be  turned  towards  either  creatures  or  Creator.  However,  fear  of 
creatures is a grievous afﬂiction, while love for them is a calamitous tribu-
lation. For you fear people who will neither pity you nor accept your pleas 
for mercy. So fear is a grievous calamity. As for love, the one you love will 
either not recognize you or will depart without bidding you farewell. Like 
your youth and property. Or else he will despise you because of your love. 
Have you not noticed that in ninety-nine out of a hundred cases of meta-
phorical love, the lover complains about the beloved. For to love and idolize 
worldly beloveds with the inner heart, which is the mirror of the Eternally 
Besought One, oppresses the beloved and he ﬁnds it disagreeable and rejects 
it. For human nature rejects and casts away things that are contrary to it and 
unworthy of it. ( Physical loves are outside our discussion. )

That is to say, the things you love either will not recognize you, or they 
will scorn you, or they will not accompany you. They will part from you in 
spite of you. Since this is so, direct your fear and love to the One through 
Whom your fear will become pleasurable abasement, and your love, shadow-
less happiness. Yes, to fear the Glorious Creator means ﬁnding a way to His 
compassionate mercy, and taking refuge in it. Fear is a whip; it drives you 
into the embrace of His mercy. It is well-known that a mother gently scares 

TWENTY-FOURTH WORD – FIFTH BRANCH

405

her infant, for example, and draws it to her breast. The fear is most pleasur-
able for the child, because it drives him to her tender embrace. Whereas the 
tenderness of all mothers is but a ﬂash of divine mercy. That means there 
is a supreme pleasure in fear of Allah. If there is such pleasure in fear of 
Allah, it is clear what inﬁnite pleasure there is to be found in love of Allah. 
Moreover, one who fears Allah is saved from the calamitous and distressing 
fear of other beings. Also, because it is for Allah’s sake, the love he has for 
creatures is not tinged with sorrow and separation.

Indeed, man loves ﬁrstly himself, then his relations, then his nation, then 
living creatures, then the universe, and the world. He is connected  with all 
these  spheres.  He  may  receive  pleasure  at  their  pleasure  and  pain  at  their 
pain. However, since nothing is stable in this world of upheavals and revo-
lutions swift as the wind, man’s wretched heart is constantly wounded. The 
things his hands cling onto tear at them as they depart, even severing them. 
He remains in perpetual distress, or else plunges into heedless drunkenness. 
Since it is thus, my soul, if you have sense, gather together all those loves 
and give them to their true owner; be saved from those calamities. These 
inﬁnite loves are particular to the One Who possesses inﬁnite perfection and 
beauty. When you give it to its true owner, you will be able to love every-
thing without distress in His name and as His mirrors. That means this love 
should not be spent directly on the universe. Otherwise, while being a deli-
cious bounty, it becomes a grievous afﬂiction.

There is another aspect besides this, O soul! and it is the most important. 
You spend all your love on yourself. You make your own soul your object 
of worship and beloved. You sacriﬁce everything for your soul. Simply, you 
ascribe to it a sort of dominicality. Whereas the cause of love is either per-
fection, because perfection is loved for itself, or it is beneﬁt, or it is pleasure, 
or it is goodness, or causes like these. Now, O soul! In several of the Words 
we have proved decisively that your essential nature is kneaded out of fault, 
deﬁciency, poverty, and impotence, and like the relative degree of darkness 
and obscurity shows the brightness of light, with regard to opposites, you act 
as a mirror through them to the perfection, beauty, power, and mercy of the 
Beauteous Creator. That means O soul, that it is not love you should have for 
your soul, but enmity, or you should pity it, or after it is at peace, have com-
passion on it. If you love your soul because it is the source of pleasure and 
beneﬁt and you are captivated by their delights, do not prefer the pleasure 
and beneﬁt of the soul, which is a mere jot, to inﬁnite pleasure and beneﬁts. 
Do not resemble a ﬁreﬂy. For it drowns all its friends and the things it loves 

406

THE WORDS

in the darkness of desolation and sufﬁces with a tiny glimmer in itself. You 
should love a Pre-Eternal Beloved on Whose gracious favours are dependent 
all the pleasures and beneﬁts of your soul together with all the beneﬁts and 
bounties  and  creatures  of  the  universe  with  which  you  are  connected  and 
from which you proﬁt and through whose happiness you are happy, so then 
you may take pleasure at both your own and their happiness, and receive an 
inﬁnite pleasure from the love of the Absolutely Perfect One.

Anyway, your intense love for yourself and your soul is love for the divine 
essence which you misuse and spend on your own self. In which case, rend 
the egotism in your soul and show Him. All your loves dispersed through 
the  universe  are  love  given  to  you  to  spend  on  His  names  and  attributes. 
You have misused it and you are suffering the  penalty. For the penalty for 
an illicit, mis-spent love is merciless torment. For sure, one particle of the 
love of a Pre-Eternal Beloved Who, through the names of Most Merciful and 
Compassionate, has prepared for you a dwelling like Paradise adorned with 
houris in which all your bodily desires will be gratiﬁed, and through others 
of His names has readied for you in that Paradise everlasting favours that 
will satisfy all the longings of your spirit, heart, inner heart, mind, and other 
subtle inner faculties, and in all of whose names are contained many treasur-
ies of grace and muniﬁcence – one particle of His love may take the place of 
the whole universe. But the universe cannot take the place of even a particu-
lar manifestation of His love. In which case, heed this Pre-Eternal Decree 
which that Pre-Eternal Beloved caused His own Beloved to announce, and 
follow it:

Second Fruit

SECOND FRUIT

O  soul!  Worship  is  not  the  introduction  to  additional  rewards,  but 
the result of previous bounties. Yes, we have received our wage and are 
accordingly charged with the duties of service and worship. For since the 
All-Glorious  Creator,  Who  clothed  you  in  existence,  O  soul!,  which  is 
pure  good,  has  given  you  a  stomach  and  appetite,  through  His  name  of 
Provider He has placed before you all foods on a table of bounties. Then, 
since He has given you a life decked out with senses, life too requires sus-
tenance like a stomach; all your senses like eyes and ears are like hands 
before which He has placed a table of bounties as broad as the earth. Then, 
because He has given you humanity, which requires many immaterial foods 
and bounties, He has laid out before that stomach of humanity, in so far as 

TWENTY-FOURTH WORD – FIFTH BRANCH

407

the hand of the mind can reach, an extensive table of bounties as broad as 
the worlds of both the inner and outer dimensions of things. Then, since 
He has given you Islam and belief, which require inﬁnite bounties and are 
nourished  through  countless  fruits  of  mercy  and  are  supreme  humanity, 
He has opened up before you a table of bounties, pleasure, and happiness 
which includes the sphere of contingency together with the sphere of His 
sacred  names  and  attributes.  Then,  by  giving  you  love,  which  is  a  light 
of  belief,  He  has  bestowed  on  you  an  endless  table  of  bounties,  happi-
ness, and pleasure. That is to say, with regard to your corporeality you are 
an  insigniﬁcant,  weak,  helpless,  lowly,  restricted,  limited  particular,  but 
through His favour you have as though risen from being an insigniﬁcant 
particular to being a universal, luminous whole. For by giving you life, He 
has raised you from particularity to a sort of universality; and by giving 
you humanity, to true universality; and by bestowing Islam on you, to an 
exalted, luminous universality; and by giving you knowledge and  love of 
Him, He has elevated you to an all-encompassing light.

O soul! You have received this wage and you are charged with the pleas-
urable, bountiful, easy, and light duty of worship. But you are lazy in this 
too. If you perform it half-heartedly, it is as though the former wages are 
insufﬁcient for you and you are overbearingly wanting greater things. Also, 
you are complaining: “ Why was my prayer not accepted? ” But your right 
is not complaint, it is supplication. Out of His pure grace and muniﬁcence, 
Almighty Allah bestows Paradise and eternal happiness. So constantly seek 
refuge in His mercy and muniﬁcence. Trust in Him and heed this decree:
( 10:58 ) j i h g f e d c b a 
I f   y o u   s a y :  “ How can I respond to these countless, universal bounties 

with my limited and partial thanks? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  With a universal intention and boundless belief. For exam-
ple, a man enters a king’s presence with a gift worth ﬁve k u r u s h , and he sees 
that other gifts worth millions have arrived from acceptable people and have 
been lined up there. It occurs to him: “ My present is nothing. What shall I 
do? ” Then he says suddenly: “ My Lord! I offer you all these valuable gifts 
in my name. For you are worthy of them. If I had the power, I would have 
given  you  gifts  equal  to  them. ”  Thus,  the  king,  who  has  need  of  nothing 
and accepts his subjects’ gifts as a sign of their loyalty and respect, accepts 
the wretched man’s universal intention and wish and the worthiness of his 
elevated belief as though it were the greatest gift.

408

THE WORDS

In exactly the same way, while performing the ﬁve daily prayers a power-
less servant of Almighty Allah declares: “ Salutations be to Allah! ” That is, 
“ I offer You on my own account all the gifts of worship all creatures offer 
you through their lives. If I had been able, I would have offered You as many 
salutations as them, for You are worthy of them and of more besides. ” Such 
an intention and belief comprise extensive, universal thanks. The seeds and 
grains of plants are their intentions.

And for example, the melon utters a thousand intentions in its heart in 
the form of the nuclei of its seeds: “ O my Creator! I want to proclaim the 
embroideries of Your most beautiful names in many places on the earth. ” 
Since Almighty Allah knows how future things will come about, He accepts 
their intention as actual worship. The rule, “ A believer’s intention is better 
than his actions ” 1 alludes to this mystery. The wisdom in offering gloriﬁca-
tions in inﬁnite numbers is understood from this mystery. For instance:

O soul! If, in a brief life, you want to do something that will proﬁt you 
inﬁnitely in the hereafter, and you want every moment of your life to be as 
beneﬁcial as a lifetime, and if you want to transform your habitual actions 
into worship and your heedlessness into awareness of the divine presence, 
follow the illustrious practices of the Prophet ( UWBP ). For when you apply 
your actions to the rulings of the Shari‘a, it affords a sort of awareness of 
Allah’s presence; it becomes worship of a sort and yields many fruits for 
the hereafter. For example, you bought something. The moment you applied 
what is acceptable and required by the Shari‘a, that ordinary act of shop-
ping acquired the value of worship. Recalling the injunctions of the Shari‘a 
calls to mind Revelation. And by thinking of the Lawgiver, you are turned 
towards Allah. And that makes you aware of His presence. That means, in 
applying the illustrious Sunna to your actions, are such advantages as mak-
ing this ﬂeeting life the means of gaining an everlasting life which produces 
eternal fruits. Heed the decree:

O soul! Do not look at the worldly, and especially the dissipated and the 
unbelievers, and be deceived by their superﬁcial glitter and illicit pleasures; 
do not imitate them. For even if you do imitate them, you will not be like 
them; you will decline immeasurably. You cannot be an animal even. For 
the  intellect  in  your  head  becomes  an  inauspicious  tool  which  constantly 
beats you over the head. For example, there is a palace and in one of its large 
apartments is a powerful electric lamp. Small electric lights which branch 
out from it and are attached to it have been divided among its small apart-
ments. Now, someone touches the switch of the big light and turns it off; 
all the apartments are plunged into deep darkness and desolation. Another 
palace has small electric lights in all its apartments which are not connected 
to the large light. If the owner of the latter palace presses the switch of the 
large electric light and turns it off, there may still be lights on in the other 
apartments  by  which  he  can  carry  out  his  work  and  which  will  not  allow 
thieves to proﬁt from the darkness.

410

THE WORDS

O soul! The ﬁrst palace is a Muslim and the Prophet Muhammad ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) is the large electric light in his heart. If he 
forgets him, or ( I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the Accursed ) he expels 
him  from  his  heart,  he  will  accept  none  of  the  other  prophets,  indeed,  no 
place will remain in his spirit for any perfection. He will not even recognize 
His Lord and Sustainer. All the apartments and subtle faculties in his nature 
will be plunged into darkness, and there will be a terrible destruction and 
desolation in his heart. How will he proﬁt in the face of this destruction and 
desolation, where will he ﬁnd familiarity? What beneﬁt will he secure which 
will repair the damage? However, Europeans resemble the second palace; 
even if they cast out from their hearts the light of the Prophet Muhammad 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), lights of a sort may remain, or they 
suppose  they  remain.  They  may  continue  to  have  a  sort  of  belief  in  their 
Creator and in Moses and Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ), which will allow 
them to attain good morals and character. 

O  my  evil-commanding  soul!  If  you  say:  “ I  am  not  a  European  and  I 
want to be an animal, ” how many times have I told you: “ You cannot be an  
animal. For there is intelligence in your head, and it strikes your face, eyes, 
and head with the pains of the past and fears of the future, and beats you. 
It adds a thousand pains to one pleasure. Whereas animals receive pleasure 
without pain. So ﬁrst pluck out your intelligence and throw it away, then be 
an animal! You will also receive the chastening slap of 
( 7:179 ) = < ; : 9  ”

Fifth Fruit

FIFTH FRUIT

O my soul! As we have stated repeatedly, since man is the fruit of the 
tree of creation, he is a creature which, like a fruit, is the furthest and most 
comprehensive and looks to everything, and bears the seed of a heart which 
holds within it the aspects of unity of everything, and whose face looks to 
multiplicity, transience, and the world. As for worship, it is a line of union 
which turns his face from transience to permanence, from creation to Crea-
tor, from multiplicity to unity, and from the extremity to the source, or it is a 
point of union between the source and the extremity. If a valuable, conscious 
fruit  that  will  form  a  seed  looks  to  the  living  creatures  beneath  the  tree, 
and relying on its beauty throws itself into their hands; if being heedless, it 
falls; it will fall to their hands and be smashed, and will go for nothing like 
a common fruit. But if the fruit ﬁnds its point of support, and it is able to 
think that by the seed within it holding the aspects of unity of the whole tree, 
it will be the means of tree’s continuance and the continued existence of the 

TWENTY-FOURTH WORD – FIFTH BRANCH

411

tree’s reality, then a single seed within that single fruit will manifest a per-
petual universal truth within an everlasting life.

In the same way, if man plunges into multiplicity, is drowned in the uni-
verse  and  intoxicated  by  love  of  the  world,  is  deceived  by  the  smiles  of 
ephemeral beings and casts himself into their arms, he certainly falls into 
inﬁnite  loss.  He  falls  into  both  transitoriness,  and  ephemerality,  and  non-
existence. In effect he sentences himself to death. But if he listens with the 
ear of his heart to the lessons in belief from the tongue of the Qur’an and 
raises his head and turns towards unity, he may rise through the ascension 
of worship to the throne of attainments and perfections. He may become an 
eternal man.

O my soul! Since the reality is thus, and since you are a member of the 

nation of Abraham ( Upon whom be peace ), like Abraham, say: 
( 6:76 ) L K J  Turn your face to the Eternal Beloved and weep the 
following lines like me. The Persian verses to be included here have been 
included in the Second Station of the Seventeenth Word, and have not been

A REMINDER

[ At the start, our intention was to write this Word in the form of ﬁve 
Lights, but at the end of the First Light, we were compelled to write 
extremely fast in order to print it in the old [ Ottoman ] script. 1 On some 
days even we wrote twenty to thirty pages in two or three hours. There-
fore, writing three Lights in a brief and concise manner, we have for 
now abandoned the last two. I hope that my brothers will look fairly and 
with tolerance at any faults and defects, and difﬁculties and mistakes, 
which may be attributed to me. ]

Most of the verses in this treatise of The Miraculousness of the Qur’an 
have either been the cause of criticism by atheists, or have been objected 
to by scientists, or have been the subject of doubt and misgiving by satans 
among jinn and men. Thus, this Twenty-Fifth Word has explained the truths 
and ﬁne points of those verses in such a way that the very points which the 
atheists and scientists imagined to be faults have been proved according to 
scholarly principles to be ﬂashes of miraculousness and the sources of the 
perfections of the Qur’an’s eloquence. In order not to cause aversion, deci-
sive answers have been given without mentioning their doubts. Only, in the 
ﬁrst Station of the Twentieth Word their doubts have been stated concerning 
three or four verses, like, ( 78:7 ) : 9   ( 36:38 ) ´ ³

studies it will not understand all the matters discussed, there is a signiﬁcant 
share for everyone in this garden. In spite of the defects in the phraseology 
and manner of expression due to its being written very fast and under con-
fused conditions, it explains the truth and reality of most important matters.

Introduction

First Part

The Introduction consists of three parts.
FIRST PART: What is the Qur’an? How is it deﬁned?
A n s w e r :   As  is  explained  in  the  Nineteenth  Word  and  proved  in  other 
Words, the Qur’an is the pre-eternal translator of the mighty book of the uni-
verse; the post-eternal interpreter of the various tongues reciting the verses 
of  creation;  the  commentator  of  the  book  of  the  Worlds  of  the  Seen  and 

414

THE WORDS

the Unseen; the revealer of the treasuries of the divine names hidden in the 
heavens and on the earth; the key to the truths concealed beneath the lines 
of events; the tongue of the Unseen World in the Manifest World; the  treas-
ury of the post-eternal favours of the Most Merciful and of the pre-eternal 
addresses  of  the  Most  Holy,  which  come  from  the  World  of  the  Unseen 
beyond the veil of this Manifest World; it is the sun, foundation, and plan of 
the spiritual world of Islam; the sacred map of the worlds of the hereafter; 
the expounding word, lucid exposition, decisive proof, and clear interpreter 
of the divine essence, attributes, names, and functions; it is the instructor of 
the world of humanity; the light and water of Islam, the macroanthropos; the 
true wisdom of humankind; and the true guide and leader urging humanity 
to prosperity and happiness; it is a both a book of law, and a book of prayer, 
and a book of wisdom, and a book of worship, and a book of command and 
summons, and a book of invocation, and a book of thought, and a unique, 
comprehensive sacred book comprising many books to which recourse may 
be had for all the needs of all humankind; it is a revealed scripture resem-
bling a sacred library which offers treatises suitable for all the various ways 
and different paths of the all the saints and the veracious ones and the wise 
and the learned, which is appropriate for the illuminations of each way and 
enlightens it, and is suitable for the course of each path and depicts it.

Second Part

SECOND PART and complement to the deﬁnition
As is explained and proved in the Twelfth Word, since the Qur’an has 
come from the sublime throne and the greatest name, and from the highest 
degree of each name, it is Allah’s Word in regard to His being Sustainer of 
All The Worlds; it is a divine decree through His title of Allah of All Beings; 
it is an address in the name of the Creator of the Heavens and the Earth; 
it  is  a  conversation  in  respect  of  absolute  dominicality;  it  is  a  pre-eternal 
discourse  on  account  of  universal  divine  sovereignty;  it  is  a  notebook  of 
the favours of the Most Merciful from the point of view of all-embracing, 
all-encompassing divine mercy; it is a collection of addresses at the start of 
which are certain ciphers in respect of the tremendousness of divine maj-
esty;  and  through  its  descent  from  the  comprehensiveness  of  the  greatest 
name, it is a holy scripture full of wisdom which looks to and inspects all 
sides of the sublime throne.

It is by reason of this mystery that with complete ﬁtness the title of the 
Word of Allah has been given to the Qur’an, and is always given. After the 
Qur’an comes the level of the books and scriptures of the other prophets. 
However,  those  other  innumerable  divine  words  are  each  in  the  form  of 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – FIRST RAY

415

inspiration  made  manifest  through  a  special  regard,  a  partial  title,  a  par-
ticular manifestation, a particular name, a special dominicality, a particular 
sovereignty, a special mercy. The inspirations of the angels, human beings, 
and the animals vary greatly with regard to universality and particularity.

Third Part

THIRD  PART:  The  Qur’an  is  a  revealed  scripture  which  contains  in 
summary the books of all the prophets, whose times were all different, the 
writings  of  all  the  saints,  whose  paths  are  all  different,  and  the  works  of 
all  the  puriﬁed  scholars,  whose  ways  are  all  different.  Its  six  aspects  are 
all brilliant and reﬁned of the darkness of doubts and scepticism; its point 
of support is certain heavenly revelation and the pre-eternal Word; its aim 
and goal is self-evidently eternal happiness; its inner aspect is clearly pure 
guidance; its upper aspect is necessarily the lights of belief; its lower aspect 
is undeniably evidence and proof; its right aspect is evidently the surrender 
of the heart and conscience; its left aspect is manifestly the subjugation of 
the reason and intellect; its fruit is indisputably the mercy of the Most Mer-
ciful and the realm of Paradise; and its rank and desirability are assuredly 
accepted by the angels and man and the jinn.

Each of the attributes in these three parts concerning the Qur’an’s deﬁni-
tion have been proved decisively in other places, or they will be proved. Our 
claims are not isolated; each may be proved with clear proofs.

FIRST LIGHT

First Ray

This Light consists of three rays.
•  FIRST  RAY:  This  is  the  eloquence  of  the  Qur’an,  which  is  at  the 
degree of miraculousness. Its eloquence is a wonderful eloquence born of 
the beauty of its ordering and composition, the perfection of its conciseness, 
the marvels of its style, its singularity and pleasantness, the excellence of its 
expression, its superiority and clarity, the power and truth of its meanings, 
and  from  the  purity  and  ﬂuency  of  its  language,  which  for  one  thousand 
three hundred years has challenged humanity’s most brilliant men of letters, 
its most celebrated orators, and the most profoundly learned of them, and 
invited them to dispute it. It has provoked them intensely. And although it 
has invited them to dispute it, those geniuses whose heads touch the skies in 
their pride and conceit have been unable to so much as open their mouths to 
do so, and have bowed their heads utterly humiliated. Thus, we shall point 
to the miraculous inimitability of its eloquence in two aspects.

First Aspect

F i r s t   A s p e c t :  It possesses miraculousness and its miraculousness exists 
for the following reasons. The great majority of the people of the Arabian 

416

THE WORDS

Peninsula at that time were illiterate. Due to this, rather than in writing, they 
preserved the sources of their pride, historical events and stories encourag-
ing their valued mores, by means of poetry and eloquence.  Due to the attrac-
tion of poetry and eloquence, meaningful sayings would remain in people’s 
memories and be passed down the generations. In consequence of this innate 
need, therefore, the goods most in demand in the immaterial market of that 
people  were  eloquence  and  ﬁne  speech.  A  tribe’s  poet  or  orator  was  like 
its greatest national hero. It was he who was their greatest source of pride. 
Thus, among the peoples of the world, the eloquence and rhetoric of that 
clever people, who by virtue of their intelligence ruled the world after the 
establishment  of  Islam,  was  at  the  highest  and  most  advanced  degree.  It 
was the thing most highly prized among them that they felt greatest need 
of,  and  was  their  cause  of  pride.  They  attached  such  value  to  eloquence 
that  two  tribes  would  do  battle  at  the  word  of  a  poet  or  orator,  and  they 
would make peace at his word. They even wrote in gold on the walls of the 
Ka‘ba the seven q a s i d a s  of seven poets called the a l - M u ‘ a l l a q a t   a l - S a b ‘ a , 
and took great pride in them. It was at such a time when eloquence was thus 
most sought after that the Qur’an was revealed. Just as at the time of Moses 
( Upon whom be peace ) it was magic that was most sought after and at the 
time of Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ), it was medicine. The most important 
of their miracles were in those ﬁelds.

The Qur’an, therefore, invited the Arabian orators of that time to reply to 
even one of the shortest of the suras. It challenged them with the decree of:

( 2:23 ) ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ » º ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´ ³
It also said: “ If you do not believe, you shall be damned and shall go 
to  Hell. ”  It  provoked  them  intensely.  It  smashed  their  pride  in  fearsome 
manner. It was contemptuous of their arrogant minds. It condemned them 
ﬁrstly to eternal extinction and then to eternal extinction in Hell, as well as 
to worldly extinction. It said: “ Either dispute me, or you and your property 
shall perish. ”

If  it  had  been  possible  to  dispute  the  Qur’an,  is  it  at  all  possible  that 
while there was an easy solution like disputing it with one or two lines and 
nullifying the claim, they should have chosen the most dangerous and most 
difﬁcult, the way of war? Yes, is it at all possible that that clever people, 
that politically-minded nation, who at a later time were to govern the world 
through  politics,  should  have  abandoned  the  shortest,  easiest,  and  lightest 
way,  and  chosen  the  most  dangerous,  which  was  going  to  cast  their  lives 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – FIRST RAY

417

and all their property into peril? For if their literary ﬁgures had been able to 
dispute it with a few words, the Qur’an would have given up its claim and 
they  would  have  been  saved  from  material  and  moral  disaster.    Whereas 
they chose a perilous, lengthy road like war. That means it was not possible 
to dispute in by word; it was impossible, so they were compelled to ﬁght it 
with the sword.

Furthermore, there are two compelling reasons for the Qur’an being imi-
tated. The ﬁrst is its enemies’ ambition to dispute it, the other, its friends’ 
pleasure at imitating it. Impelled by these, millions of books in Arabic have 
been written, but not one of them resembles the Qur’an. Whether learned or 
ignorant, whoever looks at it and at them is bound to say: “ The Qur’an does 
not resemble these. Not one of them has been able to imitate it. ” The Qur’an 
is therefore either inferior to all of them, and according to the consensus of 
friend and foe alike, this is completely futile and impossible, or the Qur’an 
is superior to all of them.

I f  y o u  s a y :  “ How do you know that no one has tried to dispute it, and that 
no one has had sufﬁcient conﬁdence to challenge it, and that no one’s help 
for anyone else was of any avail? ”

T h e  A n s w e r :  If it had been possible to dispute it, most certainly it would 
have been attempted. For it was a question of honour and pride, and life 
and property were at risk. If it had been attempted, numerous people would 
have  supported  such  an  attempt.  For  those  who  obstinately  oppose  the 
truth have always been many. And if many people had supported it, they 
surely would have found fame. For insigniﬁcant contests, even, attracted 
the wonder of people and found fame in stories and tales. So an extraor-
dinary contest and event such as that would never have remained secret. 
The most ugly and infamous things against Islam have been passed down 
and become famous, but apart from one or two stories about Musaylima 
the  Liar,  no  such  thing  has  been  related.  Musaylima  was  very  eloquent, 
but  when  compared  with  the  exposition  of  the  Qur’an,  which  possesses 
inﬁnite beauty, his words passed into the chronicles as nonsense. Thus, the 
miraculous inimitability of the Qur’an’s eloquence is as certain as twice 
two equals four; and that is how it is.

Second Aspect

S e c o n d   A s p e c t :  We shall now explain in ﬁve points the wisdom of the 

Qur’an’s miraculousness contained in its eloquence.

First Point

First Point: There is a wonderful eloquence and purity of style in the 
Qur’an’s ordering and composition. From beginning to end, I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z  
( Signs of Miraculousness ) demonstrates this eloquence and conciseness in 

418

THE WORDS

its  composition.  The  way  the  second,  minute,  and  hour  hands  of  a  clock 
each complete the order of the others, that is the way all the sentences of the 
All-Wise Qur’an, and its words, and the order in the relationships between 
the sentences and words, have been expounded in I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z , from it 
ﬁrst page to its last. Whoever wishes may look at that and  see the wonder-
ful eloquence in the ordering and composition. Here, we shall mention one 
or two examples in order to demonstrate the composition in the parts of a 
sentence. For example:

( 21:46 ) 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 / .
In  this  sentence,  it  wants  to  point  out  how  terrible  the  punishment  is  by 
showing the severity of the least amount. That is to say, it expresses little-
ness or fewness, and all the parts of the sentence look also to this littleness 
or fewness and reinforce it. Thus, the words, Y signify doubt, and doubt 
looks to littleness or fewness. The word Ö means to touch lightly and 
expresses a small amount. And just as the word 0 is merely a whiff, so 
is it in the singular form. Grammatically it is a m a ṣ d a r   m a r r a  and signiﬁes 
once. Also the t a n w ī n  indicating indeﬁniteness in 0 expresses littleness 
or fewness and means it is so insigniﬁcant that it can scarcely be known. The 
ﹾﻦﹺﻣ signiﬁes division or a part; it means a bit and indicates paucity. The 
word 
word 2 points to a light sort of punishment in relation to chastisement 
( n a k ā l  )  or  penalty  ( i ‘ q ā b  ),  and  suggests  a  small  amount.  And  by  allud-
ing to compassion and being used in place of Subduer, All-Compelling, or 
Avenger, the word 3 indicates littleness or fewness. It says, if the small 
amount of punishment suggested in all this paucity has such an effect, you 
can compare how dreadful divine chastisement will be. How much then do 
the small parts of this sentence look to one another and assist one another! 
How each reinforces the aim of the whole! This example looks to the words 
and aim to a small degree.
Second Example:

( 2:3 ) 4 3 2
The  parts  of  this  sentence  point  out  ﬁve  of  the  conditions  which  make 
almsgiving acceptable.

F i r s t   C o n d i t i o n :  This is to give only so much alms as will not cause the 
giver to be in need of receiving alms himself. It states this condition through 
the division or parts signiﬁed by 

ﹾﻦﹺﻣ in the words x .

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – FIRST RAY

419

S e c o n d   C o n d i t i o n :  It is not to take from ‘Ali and give to Wali, but to 
give out of a one’s own property. The words 3 express this condition. It 
means: “ Give out of the sustenance that is yours. ”
T h i r d   C o n d i t i o n :  This is not to place an obligation on the recipient. The 
word اَ(cid:178) in اَ(cid:179)ْ(cid:162)َزَر states this condition. That is to say: “ I give you the suste-
nance. When you give some of My property to one of My servants, you can-
not place them under an obligation. ”

F o u r t h   C o n d i t i o n :  You should give it to a person who will spend it on 
his livelihood, for alms given to those who will squander it idly is not accept-
able. The word 4  points to this condition.

F i f t h   C o n d i t i o n :  This is to give in Allah’s name. The words 3 states 
this. That is to say: “ The property is Mine; you should give it in My name. ”
These conditions may be extended. That is, the form almsgiving should 
take, with what goods. It may be given as learning and knowledge. It may be 
given as words, or as acts, or as advice. The word اَ(cid:174) in x indicates these 
various sorts through its generality. Furthermore, it indicates this with the 
sentence itself, because it is absolute and expresses generality. Thus, with 
the ﬁve conditions in this short sentence describing almsgiving, it opens up a 
broad ﬁeld before the mind, granting it to it through the sentence as a whole. 
Thus, in the sentence as a whole, the composition has many aspects.

Similarly, the ordering of the words encompasses a broad compositional 

sphere and has many aspects. And between phrases. 

For  example,  ( 112:1 ) $ # " !  contains  six  sentences.  Three  of 
them are positive and three negative. It proves six degrees of divine unity 
and  at  the  same  time  refutes  six  ways  of  associating  partners  with  Allah. 
Each sentence is both the proof of the other sentences and their result. For 
each sentence has two meanings. With one meaning it is their result, and 
with the other the proof. That is to say, within Sura al-Ikhlas are thirty suras 
composed of proofs that demonstrate each another to be as well-ordered as 
the sura itself. For example:

You can continue in the same way.

A further example:

( 2:1-2 ) + * ) ( ' & % $ # * !
Each  of  these  four  phrases  has  two  meanings.  With  one  meaning  each  is 
a proof of the other phrases, with the other, it is their result. From the six-
teen  threads  of  their  relationships,  a  miraculously  ordered  embroidery  is 
wrought. It is described thus in I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z . Also, as is explained in the 
Thirteenth Word, it is as though all the Qur’an’s verses have eyes that see 
most of the other verses and faces that look to them, so that each extends to 
the others the immaterial threads of relationship; each weaves an inimitable 
embroidery.  From  beginning  to  end  I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z   expounds  this  beauty 
and eloquence of the ordering and composition.

Second Point

Second Point: This is the wonderful eloquence in its meaning. Consider 
this example, which is explained in the Thirteenth Word. For example, if 
you want to understand the eloquence of the verse,

( 57:1 ) μ ´ ³ ² ± ° ¯ ® ¬ « 
imagine yourself in the Age of Ignorance in the deserts of barbarism before 
the light of the Qur’an. Then, at a time everything is swathed in the darkness 
of ignorance and heedlessness and enveloped in the lifeless veils of nature, 
you hear verses from the heavenly tongue of the Qur’an like:

or,

 ± ° ¯ ® ¬ « 

( 17:44 ) h g f e d c b 
Now look! See how the dead or sleeping creatures in the world are raised to 
life in the minds of listeners at the sound of b , « ; how they become 
conscious and rise up and recite Allah’s names. And how at the cry and light 
of b the stars, which had been lifeless lumps of ﬁre in the black skies,

all appear in the view of those who hear it to be wisdom-displaying words 
in the mouth of the sky and truth-pronouncing lights. The earth, too, rather 
than being a desolate wasteland is seen to be a head with the land and sea as 
tongues, and animals and plants as words of gloriﬁcation and praise.

Now consider this example, which is proved in the Fifteenth Word. Lis-

ten to these verses. What do they say?

These verses say: “ O men and jinn, arrogant and refractory in your impo-
tence  and  baseness,  and  rebellious  and  obstinate  in  your  weakness  and 
poverty! If you disobey My commands and you have the power to do so, 
pass beyond the boundaries of My dominions! How can you dare to oppose 
the commands of a Monarch Whose commands the stars, moons, and suns 
obey  as  though  they  were  soldiers  under  orders?  In  your  rebelliousness 
you oppose One All-Wise and Glorious Whose obedient soldiers are thus 
awesome. Suppose your satans were to resist, His soldiers could rain down 
stones on them like cannonballs. In your godlessness you revolt in the lands 
of a Sovereign so glorious that among His forces are some which, it is not 
insigniﬁcant powerless creatures like you, but supposing the impossible you 
were  inﬁdel  enemies  the  size  of  mountains  or  the  globe,  they  could  hurl 
down stars and ﬂaming missiles on you of that magnitude and rout you. You 
infringe a law which binds beings such as those; if it was necessary, they 
could hurl the globe of the earth in your face and rain down stars and heav-
enly bodies on you as though they were missiles, with Allah’s permission. ” 
You can compare with these the power, eloquence, and elevated manner of 
expression of other verses and their meanings.

Third Point

Third Point: This is the wonderful uniqueness of its style. Indeed, the 
Qur’an’s style is both strange, and original, and wonderful, and convincing. 
It has imitated nothing and no one. And no one has been able to imitate it. 
Its style has always preserved the freshness, youth, and singularity it pos-
sessed when it was ﬁrst revealed and it continues to preserve it. For instance, 
the unique style of the cipher-like m u q a t t a ‘ a t , the Disjointed Letters, like, 
# , a , < , E , ! , !  , at the beginning of some of the suras. 

422

THE WORDS

We have described ﬁve or six of the ﬂashes of miraculousness they comprise 
in I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z .

For  example,  the  letters  at  the  start  of  some  suras  have  taken  half 
of  each  category  of  the  many  well-known  categories  of  letters,  like  the 
emphatic letters ( K ā f ,  Q ā f ,  Ṭ ā ,  A l i f ,  J ī m ,  D ā l ,  T ā ,  B ā  ), the sibilants, the 
stressed letters, the soft letters, the labiolinguals, and tremolo ( q a l q a l a  ) 
letters ( Q ā f , Ṭ ā , D ā l , J ī m , B ā  ). Taking more than half from the light letters 
and less than half from the heavy letters, neither of which are divisible, it 
has halved every category. Although the human mind would be capable of 
it, halving all those categories overlapping one within the other, hesitant 
among two hundred possibilities, in the only way possible, which was hid-
den to the human mind and unknown to it, and organizing all the letters in 
that way, over that broad distance, was not the work of the human mind. 
And chance could not have interfered in it. 

Thus,  in  addition  to  the  fact  that  these  letters  at  the  beginning  of  the 
suras – divine ciphers – display ﬁve or six similar ﬂashes of miraculousness, 
scholars versed in the mysteries of the science of letters and the authorities 
from among the saints deduced many secrets from these disjointed letters. 
They discovered such truths that they declared that on their own these let-
ters form a brilliant miracle. Since we are not party to their secrets and also 
we cannot provide proofs that are clear to everyone, we cannot open that 
door.  We  shall  therefore  sufﬁce  with  referring  readers  to  the  explanation 
in  I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z ,  which  deals  with  ﬁve  or  six  ﬂashes  of  miraculousness 
related to them.

Now  we  shall  point  out  the  Qur’anic  styles  with  regard  to  sura,  aim, 

verse, phrase, and word.

For example, if the sura ( 78:1 ) " ! is studied carefully, it shows the 
events of the hereafter, the resurrection of the dead, and Paradise and Hell 
in a style so unique and wonderful that it proves the divine acts and domini-
cal works in this world as though looking at each of those events of the next 
world, and convinces the heart. To expound the style of this sura fully would 
be lengthy, so we shall merely indicate one or two points, as follows:

At the start of the sura, to prove the resurrection, it says: “ We have made 
the earth a beautifully decked-out cradle for you, and the mountains masts 
and  poles  full  of  treasure  for  your  house  and  your  lives.  We  have  made 
you as couples, loving and close to one another. We have made the night a 
coverlet for your sleep of comfort, the daytime the arena in which you earn 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – FIRST RAY

423

your livelihood, the sun a light-giving, heat-supplying lamp, and from the 
clouds  We  pour  down  water  as  though  they  were  a  spring  producing  the 
water of life. And We create easily and quickly from the simple water the 
various ﬂower-bearing and fruit-bearing things which bear all your suste-
nance. Since this is so, the Day of Resurrection, the day when good and evil 
shall be separated out, awaits you. It is not difﬁcult for Us to bring about 
that Day. ” In a veiled way it points to proofs that after this at the resurrec-
tion, the mountains will be scattered, the skies shattered, Hell  readied, and 
the people of Paradise given gardens and orchards. It says in effect: “ Since 
He does these things related to the mountains and the earth before your very 
eyes, He shall do things resembling these in the hereafter. ” That is to say, 
the mountain at the beginning of the sura looks to the state of the mountains 
at the resurrection, and the garden to the gardens and paradises in the here-
after. You may compare other points to this and see what a beautiful and 
elevated style it has.
And, for example:

 c b a ` _ ^ ] \ [ Z Y X W
 v u t s * q p o n m l k j i h g f e d
 ¥ ¤ £ ¢ ¡ ﮯ ~ } | { z y x w
 ( 3:26-27 ) ª © ¨ § ¦
These verses describe the divine acts in humankind, and the divine manifes-
tations in the alternations of night and day, and the dominical acts of disposal 
in the seasons of the year, and the dominical deeds in life and death on the 
face of the earth and in the resurrections in this world in a style so elevated 
that it captivates the minds of the attentive. Since its brilliant, elevated, and 
wide-reaching style is clearly understood with little study, we shall not open 
that treasury for now.
And for example,

 * ; : 9 8  * 6 5 4  *  2 1 0  *  . - , 
( 84:1-5 ) ? > =
This explains in a truly elevated style the degree of submission and obedi-
ence  to  Almighty  Allah’s  command  of  the  skies  and  the  earth.  It  is  like 
this: a commander-in-chief opens two ofﬁces to accommodate the matters 

424

THE WORDS

necessary for ﬁghting, like one for strategy and one for the enrolment of sol-
diers, and when those matters are accomplished and the ﬁghting is over, he 
addresses himself to the two ofﬁces in order to convert them into something 
else for some other business. They both say, either through the tongues of 
those employed in them or through their own tongues: “ O Chief! Give us a 
short respite so that we can clean up the bits and pieces of the former busi-
ness and throw them out, then you may honour us with your presence. There, 
we  have  thrown  them  out,  we  await  your  command.  Command  what  you 
wish. We hear and obey! Everything you do is true, good, and beneﬁcial. ”

In the same way, the heavens and the earth were opened as two arenas of 
obligation, trial, and examination. After the allotted period is ﬁnished, they 
will put aside the things pertaining to the arena of trial and say: “ O our Sus-
tainer! The command is Yours, employ us now in whatever You wish. Our 
right is only to obey You. Everything You do is right. ” Consider carefully 
the majestic style of those sentences! 

And for example, 

 Å Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ 
( 11:44 ) Í Ì Ë Ê É È Ç Æ
In order to point to a mere drop from the sea of eloquence of this verse, we 
shall show one aspect of its style in the mirror of a comparison.

On the victory being won in a great war, the commander says “ Cease 
ﬁre! ” to one ﬁring army and “ Halt! ” to another, assaulting, army. He issues 
the command, and at that instant the ﬁring ceases and the assault is halted. 
He says: “ It is ﬁnished, we’ve beaten them. Our ﬂag is planted at the top of 
the high citadel at the enemies’ centre. Those mannerless tyrants have met 
with their reward and been cast down to the lowest of the low! ”

In just the same way, the Peerless Sovereign issued the command to the 
heavens and the earth to annihilate the people of Noah. When they had car-
ried out their duty, He decreed: “ Drink up your water, O earth! Cease from 
your work, O skies! It is ﬁnished. Now the waters are receding. The Ark, 
which is a divine ofﬁcial performing its duty as a tent, is settled on the top of 
the mountain. The wrongdoers have received retribution. ” See the elevated 
nature of this style. It is saying: “ The heavens and earth obey the command 
like two well-disciplined soldiers. ” It is thus alluding to the fact that the uni-
verse becomes angry at man’s rebellion. The heavens and the earth become 
incensed.  And  with  this  allusion  it  is  saying:  “ One  whose  commands  the 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – FIRST RAY

425

skies and the earth obey like two disciplined soldiers may not be rebelled 
against, ” restraining man in awesome fashion. Thus, it describes a universal 
event like the Flood with all its consequences and truths in a few sentences 
in a concise, miraculous, beautiful, and succinct manner. You can compare 
this  droplet  from  the  ocean  with  other  drops.  Now  consider  the  style  dis-
played by the window of the words.

For example, consider the words Ä Ã   in, 

( 36:39 ) Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾
see what a subtle style it displays. It is like this: one of the moon’s man-
sions is in the Pleiades. The Qur’an likens the crescent moon to a withered 
and  whitened  old  date  stalk.  With  this  simile  it  depicts  for  the  eye  of  the 
imagination a tree behind the green veil of the skies; one of its white, curved, 
luminous branches has rent the veil and raised its head; the Pleiades are like 
a bunch of grapes on the branch and the other stars all luminous fruits of 
that hidden tree of creation. If you have any discernment, you will under-
stand what an appropriate, graceful, subtle, and elevated style and manner of 
expression this is in the view of the desert-dwellers, for whom the date palm 
is the most important means of livelihood.

And  for  example,  as  is  proven  at  the  end  of  the  Nineteenth  Word,  the 

words ´ in,

( 36:38 ) ¶ μ ´ ³
opens a window onto an elevated style, as follows: with the words ´ 
that  is,  the  sun  revolves,  it  puts  in  mind  the  Maker’s  tremendousness  by 
recalling the orderly disposals of divine power in the alternations of winter 
and summer and day and night, and directs one’s gaze to the missives of the 
Eternally Besought One inscribed by the pen of power on the pages of the 
seasons. It proclaims the wisdom of the All-Glorious Creator.

And with the word “ l a m p  ” in,

( 71:16 ) J I H 
it  opens  a  window  onto  the  style  like  this:  it  makes  one  understand  the 
Maker’s majesty and Creator’s bounty by recalling that the world is a pal-
ace  and  the  things  within  it  are  adornments,  food,  and  necessities  pre-
pared for man and living creatures and that the sun is a subservient candle, 
demonstrating  that  the  sun  is  an  evidence  of  Allah’s  unity,  and  that  the 
idolators’ greatest, most brilliant object of worship is merely a subjugated 

426

THE WORDS

lamp,  an  inanimate  creature.  That  is  to  say,  the  word J  calls  to  mind 
the Creator’s mercy within the grandeur of His dominicality; it recalls His 
favours within the breadth of His mercy, and in so doing informs of His 
muniﬁcence  within  the  majesty  of  His  sovereignty,  thereby  proclaiming 
divine unity, and saying indirectly: “ An inanimate, subservient lamp is in 
no way ﬁt to be worshipped. ”

And  in  the  “ c o u r s e  ”  of ´  it  calls  to  mind  the  wondrous  orderly 
disposals  of  divine  power  in  the  revolutions  of  night  and  day  and  winter 
and summer, and in so doing makes known the grandeur of a single Mak-
er’s  power  in  His  dominicality.  That  is  to  say,  it  turns  man’s  mind    from 
the  points  of  the  sun  and  moon  to  the  pages  of  night  and  day  and  winter 
and summer, and draws his attention to the lines of events written on those 
pages. For the Qur’an does not speak of the sun for the sake of the sun, but 
for the One Who illuminates it. Also, it does not speak of the sun’s nature, 
for which man has no need, but of the sun’s duty, which is that of mainspring 
for the order of dominical art, and centre of the order of dominical creativ-
ity, and a shuttle for the harmony and order of dominical art in the things 
the Pre-Eternal Inscriber weaves with the threads of day and night. You can 
compare others of the Qur’an’s words with these. While all are simple, ordi-
nary words, each performs the duty of a key to treasuries of subtle meanings.
It is because the Qur’an’s style is for the greater part elevated and bril-
liant in the ways described above, that on occasion Arab nomads were cap-
tivated by a single phrase, and without being Muslims would prostrate. One 
nomad prostrated on hearing the phrase:

( 15:94 ) 0 / . 
When asked: “ Have you become a Muslim? ”, he replied: “ No. I am pros-
trating at the eloquence of these words. ”

Fourth Point

Fourth Point: This is the wonderful eloquence in its wording; that is, 
in the words employed. Yes, just as the Qur’an is extraordinarily eloquent 
in regard to its style and manner of exposition, so is there a truly ﬂuent elo-
quence in its wording. Clear evidence of the existence of this eloquence is 
the fact that it does not bore or cause weariness; while the testimony of the 
brilliant scholars of the sciences of rhetoric, the semantics of syntax, and of 
ﬁgurative speech, forms a decisive proof of the wisdom of the eloquence. 

Yes,  the  Qur’an  does  not  weary  even  if  repeated  thousands  of  times; 
indeed, it gives pleasure. Neither is it burdensome for the memory of a small 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – FIRST RAY

427

and  simple  child;  children  can  memorize  it  easily.  Nor  is  it  unpleasant  to 
the ear, pained by the slightest word, of someone extremely ill; it is easy on 
it. It is like sherbet to the palate of one in the throes of death; its recitation 
gives sweet pleasure to the person’s ear and mind of such a person just like 
Zamzam water to his mouth and palate. 

The reason for the Qur’an’s not causing boredom, and the wisdom of it, is 
this: it is food and sustenance for the heart, strength and wealth for the mind, 
water and light for the spirit, and the cure and remedy for the soul. Everyday 
we eat bread, yet we never tire of it. But if we were to eat the choicest fruit 
every day, we would get bored of it. This means that it is because the Qur’an 
is truth and reality and truthfulness and guidance and wonderfully eloquent 
that it does not cause weariness and preserves its  freshness and agreeable-
ness as though preserving a perpetual youth. One of the Qurayshi leaders 
even, an expert orator, was sent by the idolators to listen to the Qur’an. He 
went and listened, then returned and said to them: “ These words have such 
sweetness and freshness, they do not resemble the words of men. I know the 
poets and soothsayers; these words do not resemble theirs. The best we can 
do is mislead our followers and say it is magic. ” Thus, even the All-Wise 
Qur’an’s most obdurate enemies were amazed at its eloquence.

It would be very lengthy to explain the sources of the All-Wise Qur’an’s 
eloquence in its verses and words and sentences, therefore we shall keep the 
explanation brief and show by way of example the ﬂuency and eloquence 
of the wording in one sentence obtained through the position of the letters 
and a single ﬂash of miraculousness that shines forth from that positioning. 
Take the verse:

( 3:154 )  +  * ) ( ' & % $ # " !    to  the 

end of the verse.

In this verse, all the letters of the alphabet are present. But, see, although 
all the categories of emphatic letters are together, it has not spoilt the smooth-
ness of style. Indeed, it has added a brilliance, a harmonious, congruent, elo-
quent melody issuing from varied strings. Also, note carefully the following 
ﬂash of eloquence: of the letters of the alphabet, ( ا ) and ( ى ), since they are 
the lightest and have been transposed with one another like sisters, they have 
each been repeated twenty-one times. And since ( م ) and ( ن ) 1 are sisters and 
have changed places, they have each been mentioned thirty-three times. And 
since ( ش )  , ( س )  , ( ص )  are  sisters  in  regard  to  articulation,  quality,  and 

1.  Ta n w ī n  is also a N ū n .

428

THE WORDS

sound, each has been mentioned three times. And although ( ع ) and ( غ ) are 
sisters, since ( ع ) is lighter, it is mentioned six times, while because ( غ ) is 
harsher, it is mentioned half as many, three times. And since ( ذ ) , ( ظ ) , ( ط ) , 
( ز ) are sisters in regard to articulation, quality, and sound, each is mentioned 
twice, while ( ل ) and ( ا ) in the form of ( (cid:202) ) have united and ( ا )’( s ) share 
in the the form of ( (cid:202) ) is half that of ( ل ) , ( ل ) is mentioned forty-two times 
and as ( a ) half of it ( ا ) twenty-one times. Since ‘H a m z a ’ and ( ـ(cid:182) ) are sisters 
in regard to articulation, ‘H a m z a ’1 is mentioned thirteen times and being ( a ) 
degree lighter ( ـ(cid:182) ) is mentioned fourteen times. And ( ك ) , ( ف ) , ( ق ) are sis-
ters; since ( ق ) has an additional point, it is mentioned ten times, ( ف ), nine 
times, ( ك ) nine times, ( ب ) nine times, and ( ت ) twelve times. Since ( ت ) 
comes third, it is mentioned twelve times. ( ر ) is ( ل )’( s ) sister, but according 
to their numerical value, ( ر ) is two hundred, and ( ل ) thirty, so since it has 
risen six times more, it has fallen six. Also, since ( ر ) is repeated on pronun-
ciation, it becomes emphatic and is only mentioned six times. And because 
( ح )  , ( ث )  , ( ض ) ,  and ( خ )  are  emphatic  and  gain  additional  qualities  in 
connection  with  other  letters,  they  have  each  been  mentioned  only  once. 
Since ( و ) is lighter than ( ـ(cid:182) ) and ‘H a m z a ’, and heavier than ( ى ) and ( ا ) , it 
is mentioned seventeen times, four times more than heavy ‘H a m z a ’ and four 
times less than light ( ا ).

Thus,  the  extraordinary  positioning  of  the  letters  in  the  passage  men-
tioned here and their hidden relationships, and the beautiful order and ﬁne, 
subtle regularity and harmony show as clearly as twice two equals four that 
it would not be within the limits of human thought to have composed it. As 
for chance and coincidence, it is impossible that it should have interfered. 
And so, just as the strange and wonderful order and regularity in the position 
of these letters leads to a ﬂuency and eloquence in the words, so may there 
be many other hidden instances of wisdom. Since such an order has been 
followed in the letters, surely in the words, sentences and meanings such a 
mysterious order, such a luminous harmony, has been observed that should 
the eye see it, it would declare: “ M a ’s h a l l a h !  ” and should the reason com-
prehend it, it would exclaim: “ B ā r a k a l l a h !  ”

Fifth Point: This is the excellence in its manner of exposition; that is to 
say, the superiority, conciseness, and grandeur. Just as there is lucidity in its 
ordering and composition, ﬂuency in its wording, eloquence in its meaning, 
and a uniqueness in its style, so in its manner of exposition is there a supe-
riority and excellence. Indeed, all the categories and levels of speech and 
address, such as encouragement and deterring, praise and censure, proof and 
guidance, explanation and silencing in argument are present at the highest 
degree in the Qur’an’s exposition.

Of the innumerable examples of its manner of exposition 1 in the category 
of encouragement and urging is that in the sura ( 76:1 ) °¯®¬  this is 
as sweet as the water of Kawthar and ﬂows with the ﬂuency of the spring of 
Salsabil, it is as ﬁne as the raiment of the houris.

Of the numerous examples of the category of deterring and threatening is 
the start of the sura ( 88:1 ) 7654 Here the Qur’an’s exposi-
tion has an effect like lead boiling  in the ears of the people of misguidance, 
and ﬁre burning in their brains, and z a q q u m  scalding their palates, and Hell 
assaulting  their  faces,  and  like  a  bitter  thorny  tree  in  their  stomachs.  An 
ofﬁcial like Hell charged by someone with inﬂicting torment and torture in 
order to demonstrate his threats, and its splitting apart with seething rage, 
and  its  saying:  ( 67:8 )  { z y x  certainly  show  how  awesomely 
dreadful that person’s threats are.

Of  the  thousands  of  examples  in  the  category  of  praise,  the  Qur’an’s 
ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا is as brilliant as the 
manner of exposition in the ﬁve suras starting ِ
sun,  2 as adorned as the stars, as majestic as the heavens and the earth, as 
lovable as the angels, as compassionate as tenderness towards young in this 
world, and as beautiful as Paradise in the hereafter.

Of the thousands of examples in the category of censure and restraint, in 
the  verse,    ( 49:12 ) ; : 9 8 7 6 5 4    it  cen-
sures six times. It restrains from backbiting forcibly six times over. It is 
like this: as is known, the H a m z a  at the beginning of the verse is interroga-
tive. This seeps through all the words of the verse like water. Thus, with 
the ﬁrst H a m z a  it asks: Have you no reason, the seat of question and answer, 
that you do not understand how ugly it is? 

1.  The style here has slipped into the clothes of this sura’s meaning.
2.  In these phrases is an allusion to the matters discussed in these suras. [ The ﬁve 

suras are al-Fātiḥa ( 1 ), al-An’ām ( 6 ), al-Kahf ( 18 ), Sabā’ ( 34 ), and al-Fāṭir ( 35 ). Tr.]

THE WORDS

With the second, it asks with the word 4 : Is your heart, the seat of 

love and hate, so corrupted that it loves the most despicable thing? 

With the third, it asks with the words 5 : What has happened to 
your social life and civilization, which receives its vitality from the commu-
nity, that it ﬁnds acceptable an act which thus poisons your life?

With the fourth, it asks with the words 8 7 6 : What has hap-
pened to your humanity that you tear apart your friend like a savage beast? 
With the ﬁfth, it asks with the words 9 : Have you no compassion and 
fellow-feeling that you unjustly tear with your teeth at the character of the 
one injured, your brother in so many respects? Have you no intelligence that 
you bite at your own limbs like a madman?

And with the sixth it asks with the word : : Where is your conscience? 
Is  your  nature  so  corrupted  that  you  do  the  most  repulsive  thing  to  the 
most respected person, your brother, like eating his ﬂesh? That is to say, 
backbiting is censured and despised by the reason, the heart, humanity, the 
conscience, human nature, and social and national solidarity. So see! How 
this verse restrains from this crime in six concise degrees, on six miracu-
lous levels!

Of the thousands of examples of the category of proof, is the verse:

 Ü Û Ú Ù Ø × Ö Õ Ô Ó Ò Ñ Ð Ï Î Í 
 ( 30:50 ) á à ß Þ Ý
Its exposition is such in proving resurrection  and  banishing  doubts that  it 
could  not  be  more  clearly  demonstrated.  It  is  like  this:  it  says  that,  as  is 
proved and explained in the Ninth Truth of the Tenth Word and in the Fifth 
Flash of the Twenty-Second Word, every spring examples of resurrection 
are provided in three hundred thousand ways in the earth being raised to life 
with  the  utmost  order  and  differentiation  despite  the  innumerable  species 
being  all  mixed  up  together  in  total  confusion,  thus  demonstrating  to  the 
human observer that the resurrection of the dead would not be difﬁcult for 
the One who does this. Also, since to write without fault or error with the 
pen of power hundreds of thousands of species on the page of the earth, all 
together and one within the other, is the seal of the Single One of Unity; with 
this verse it both proves divine unity as the clearly as the sun, and it dem-
onstrates the resurrection of the dead as easily and decisively as the rising 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – FIRST RAY

431

and setting of the sun. Thus, the Qur’an indicates this truth in regard to the 
manner of its occurrence, as described by the word  َفْ(cid:193)َ(cid:166) , just as it mentions 
it in detail in many suras.

And for example, in the sura,  ( 50:1 ) $# <! , it proves res-
urrection  in  such  a  brilliant,  ﬁne,  sweet,  and  exalted  manner  that  it  con-
vinces as certainly as the coming of spring. Look! In answer to the unbeliev-
ers  denying  the  raising  to  life  of  decomposed  bones  and  saying:  “ This  is 
extraordinary; it could not be! ”, it decrees:

 * [ Z Y X W V U T S R Q P
 k j i * g f e d c b a ` _ ^ ]
 z * x w v u t s r q p o * m l
( 50:6-11 ) ª © ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ £ ¢ ¡  * ~ } | {
Its manner of exposition ﬂows like water and shines like the stars. It gives 
both pleasure and delight to the heart like dates. And it is sustenance.

And in one of the most subtle examples of the category of proof, it says:
( 36:1-3 ) C B A * ? > * < 
That is, “ I swear by the Wise Qur’an that you are one of the divine mes-
sengers. ” This oath indicates that the proof of messengership is so certain 
and true and its veracity is so worthy of honour and respect, that it is sworn 
by. By indicating this, it is saying: “ You are the Messenger, for you hold the 
Qur’an in your hand, and the Qur’an is the truth and it is the word of Truth. 
For it contains true wisdom and bears the seal of miraculous inimitability. ”
And one of the concise and miraculous examples of the category of proof 

is this:

 w v u t s r q  * o n m l k j
( 36:78-79 ) { z y x
That is, “ Man asks: Who will resurrect decayed bones? You say: Whoever 
made them in the ﬁrst place and gave them life, He will resurrect them. ” As 
was depicted in the third comparison of the Ninth Truth in the Tenth Word, 
someone reassembles a large army in one day before your eyes and someone 
else says: “ At a bugle-call that person brought together the members of a 
battalion who had dispersed to rest; he is able to bring the battalion under 

432

THE WORDS

order. ” So, O man, if you say: “ I don’t believe it, ” you can see what a fool-
ish denial it would be.

In just the same way, the All-Powerful and All-Knowing One enrolls and 
unites anew with the command of ( 36:82 ) ² ± , and with perfect order 
and the balance of wisdom, the particles and subtle faculties of the battalion-
like bodies of all the animals – which resemble an army – and other living 
creatures, and creates every century, and every spring even, all the hundreds 
of thousands of army-like species of living creatures on the face of the earth. 
Can it be questioned then how He can gather together at one blast of Israﬁl’s 
trumpet the fundamental parts and particles of a battalion-like body, which 
are already familiar with one another, through taking them under order? Can 
it be considered unlikely? To consider it unlikely is a mindless foolishness.
In  the  category  of  guidance,  the  Qur’an’s  manner  of  exposition  is  so 
moving and tender, so familiar and gentle, that it ﬁlls the spirit with ardour, 
the heart with delight, the mind with interest, and the eyes with tears. Of 
thousands of examples is this verse:

( 2:74 ) ...q p o n m l k j i h g  to the end of 

the verse. 

As is proved and explained in the discussion of the third verse in the First 
Station of the Twentieth Word, it says to the Children of Israel: “ What has 
happened to you that although hard rocks shed tears from twelve springs like 
eyes before a miracle like the staff of Moses ( Upon whom be peace ), you 
remain indifferent in the face of all his miracles, with your eyes dry and tear-
less and your hearts hard and without fervour? ” Since guidance in this sense 
is explained there, we refer you to that Word and curtail this here.

Of  thousands  of  examples  in  the  category  of  making  understood  and 

silencing in argument, consider only the following two:

 ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ » º ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´ ³ 
( 2:23 ) Ç Æ Å     Ä Ã Â Á À
That is, “ If you have any doubts, summon all your elders and supporters to 
help you and testify for you, then compose the like of a single sura. ” Since 
this has been explained and proved in I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z , here we shall sufﬁce 
with a brief summary of it. It is as follows.

The  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  says:  “ O  men  and  jinn!  If  you 
have any doubts that the Qur’an is Allah’s Word and imagine it to be man’s 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – FIRST RAY

433

word, then come on, here it is, let’s see! You produce a book like this Qur’an 
from someone unlettered who does not know how to read and write like the 
person you call Muhammad the Trustworthy, and get him to compose it! If 
you cannot do this, then he need not be untaught, let him be a famous man of 
letters and learned. And if you are not able to do this, alright, not on his own, 
take all the ﬁnest works of all your orators and men of eloquence, and indeed 
of  all  the  literary  geniuses  of  the  past  and  all  those  of  the  future,  and  the 
assistance of all your gods. Work with all your strength, compose the like of 
this Qur’an. And if you cannot do this, leave aside the truths of the Qur’an 
and its many miraculous aspects, which are impossible to imitate, and com-
pose a work which is its equal in only the eloquence of its composition! ”

With the silencing words,

( 11:13 ) * ) ( ' &
it says: “ Come on, I do not want its true meaning from you, let it be fabrica-
tions and lies and false tales. You will not be able to do this. So it need not 
be as much as the whole Qur’an, just produce ten suras like it. You will not 
be able to do this either, so produce a single sura. This will be too much as 
well. So alright, make it the equivalent of a short sura. You will not be able 
to do this either, although the need for you to do so is so great. For your 
honour and self-respect, your dignity and religion, your tribal honour and 
pride, your life and property, and your lives in this world and the next will 
all be saved by producing the like of it. Otherwise in this world you will 
remain in abasement, without honour, dignity, religion, or pride, and your 
lives and property will be destroyed and will perish, and in the hereafter, as 
is indicated by the verse,

( 2:24 ) Ó Ò Ñ Ð Ï Î
you will be condemned to everlasting incarceration in Hell; together with 
your idols you will be fuel to its ﬁres. Since your need is thus great, and  
since you have now understood your impotence in eight degrees, you should 
be certain eight times over that the Qur’an is a miracle. So either believe 
in it, or be silent and go to Hell! ” So see the way the Qur’an forces them 
to accept the argument in this category of silencing in argument, which is 
within that of making understood, and say: ﮯﮐاَ(cid:193)َ(cid:92)  ِنٰاْرُ(cid:163)ْ(cid:170)ا  ِناَ(cid:193)َ(cid:92) َدْ(cid:151)َ(cid:92)  َسْ(cid:193)َ(cid:170)

Indeed, no need remains for further exposition after that of the Qur’an.

Here we shall explain only one of the thousands of truths of these verses as 
a further example of the category of silencing in argument. It is as follows: 
with the word,  ْمَا , ْمَا it silences every group of the people of misguidance 
with a rhetorical question expressing surprise and stops up all the sources 
of their doubts. It leaves no satanic chink through which doubts might enter 
and conceal themselves; it closes them all. It leaves no veil of misguidance 
under which they might creep and lurk; it rends all of them. It leaves not 
one of their lies; it crushes them. In each sentence it either demolishes the 
essence of the blasphemous ideas of one group with a short phrase, or since 
the falsity is obvious, it exposes it by silence, or since it is refuted in detail 
in other verses, it here alludes to it brieﬂy. For example, the ﬁrst sentence 
alludes to the verse:

While the ﬁfteenth sentence points to the verse:

( 36:69 )  Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ 

( 21:22 ) ¶ μ ´ ³ ² ± °
You  can  make  further  examples  from  the  other  sentences  like  these.  It  is 
like  this:  it  says  at  the  start:  Announce  the  divine  decrees.  You  are  not  a 
soothsayer, for the words of soothsayers are confused and conjectural, while 
yours are true and certain. And you are not mad; your enemies even attest to 
your perfect sanity.

( 52:30 ) Ô Ó Ò Ñ Ð Ï Î 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – FIRST RAY

Do they call you a poet, like the unreasoning, common inﬁdels? Are they 
waiting for you to perish? You say to them: “ Wait! I shall wait with you! ” 
Your vast and brilliant truths are free of the imaginings of poetry and inde-
pendent of their fancies.

( 52:32 ) $ # " !  
Or like unreasoning philosophers who rely on their reasons, do they hold 
back from following you, saying: “ Our faculties of reason are sufﬁcient. ” 
But reason commands that you are followed, because everything you say is 
reasonable. But again the reason on its own cannot reach it.

( 52:32 ) ) ( ' &  
Or is the reason for their denial their not submitting to Almighty Allah like 
wicked tyrants? But the ends are known of the Pharaohs and Nimrods, who 
were the leaders of arrogant oppressors.

( 52:33 ) 1 0 / . - , + 
Or  like  lying  dissemblers  without  conscience  do  they  accuse  you  saying: 
“ You have made up the Qur’an! ”? But up to this time they have known you 
to  be  the  most  truthful  among  them  and  have  called  you  Muhammad  the 
Trustworthy. It means that they have no intention to believe. Otherwise let 
them ﬁnd the like of the Qur’an among the works of men.

( 52:35 ) > = < ; :
Or  like  the  absurd  philosophers  who  believed  the  universe  to  be  without 
purpose and in vain, do they suppose themselves to be aimless and without 
wisdom, purpose, duty, or Creator? Have they become blind that they do not 
see that the universe is adorned from top to bottom with instances of wisdom 
and bears the fruit of aims, and that beings from particles to the suns are 
charged with duties and are subjugated to the divine commands?

( 52:35 ) A @ ?
Or do they imagine like the pharaoh-like materialists that “ They came into 
being  by  themselves,  feed  themselves,  and  themselves  create  everything 
they need, ” so that they hold back from believing and worship? That means 
they all suppose themselves to be the Creator. Whereas the Creator of one 
thing  has  to  be  the  Creator  of  everything.  That  is  to  say,  their  pride  and 
conceit  have  made  them  so  utterly  stupid  they  imagine  to  be  a  Possessor 
of Absolute Power one who is absolutely impotent and may be defeated by 
a ﬂy or a microbe. Since they have abdicated their reason and humanity to

beings, do not be saddened at their denial. Consider them to be a variety of 
harmful animal and ﬁlthy matter! Ignore them and give them no importance!

( 52:36 ) J I H G F E D C 
Or, like the mindless, confused Mu‘attila, who denied Allah all attributes 
and  denied  the  Creator,  do  they  deny  Allah  so  that  they  do  not  heed  the 
Qur’an? In which case, let them deny the existence of the heavens and the 
earth, or let them say: “ We created them! ” Let them lose their minds alto-
gether and begin uttering the frenzied ravings of lunacy. For in the heavens 
as many proofs of divine unity are apparent and are recited as the stars, and 
on the earth as many as the ﬂowers. That means they have no intention of 
acquiring certain knowledge and ﬁnding the truth. Otherwise how do they 
suppose  to  be  without  inscriber  the  book  of  the  universe,  in  one  word  of 
which is written a whole book, although they know that a letter cannot exist 
without the one who wrote it.

( 52:37 ) O N M L 
Or, like one group of misguided philosophers who denied Almighty Allah 
the  power  of  choice,  or  like  the  Brahmans,  do  they  deny  the  source  of 
prophethood  so  that  they  do  not  believe  in  you?  In  which  case,  let  them 
deny all the traces of wisdom and purpose, all the order and fruits which are 
apparent in all beings and demonstrate will and choice, let them deny all the 
works of mercy and grace, and all the miracles of all the prophets! Or let 
them say: “ All the treasuries of the bounties given to creatures are with us 
and under our control. ” Let them prove they are not ﬁt to be addressed! Do 
not be grieved at their denial, say: “ Allah’s unreasoning animals are many! ”

( 52:37 ) R Q P 
Or, like the arrogant Mu‘tazilites, who made the reason dominant, do they  
imagine  themselves  to  be  rivals  to  and  inspectors  of  the  Creator’s  works, 
and want to hold the All-Glorious Creator responsible? Beware, do not lose 
heart! Nothing can come of the denials of self-centred people like that! You 
do not be deceived either!

( 52:38 ) ] \ [ Z Y X W V U T 
Or, like the spiritualists and phony soothsayers, do they follow Satan and the 
jinn and suppose they have found another way to the World of the Unseen? 
In which case, have they a ladder by which to ascend to the heavens which

are closed to the satans? Do they imagine that they can give the lie to your 
news from the heavens? The denials of such charlatans are worth nothing!
( 52:39 ) c b a ` _ 
Or, like the polytheist philosophers who ascribed partners to Allah under 
the  name  of  the  Ten  Intellects  and  the  Masters  of  the  Species,  and  the 
Sabeans, who attributed a sort of godhead to the stars and the angels, do 
they ascribe offspring to Almighty Allah? Like the heretics and misguided, 
do  they  ascribe  a  son  to  Him,  which  is  contrary  to  the  necessary  exist-
ence, unity, eternity, and absolute self-sufﬁciency of the Single and Eter-
nally Besought One? Do they ascribe femininity to that offspring, which 
is  opposed  to  the  angels’  worship,  purity,  and  kind?  Do  they  suppose  it 
to  be  an  intercessor  for  them,  so  that  they  do  not  follow  you?  Genera-
tion is the means of multiplying, mutual assistance, perpetuation, and life 
for creatures like man, who is contingent, transitory, and in need of per-
petuating the species, is corporeal and divisible, capable of multiplying, 
impotent and needy for an heir to help him. So to ascribe offspring – and 
a sort of offspring that those impotent, contingent, wretched men did not 
themselves  like  and  could  not  equate  with  their  arrogant  pride,  that  is, 
female  offspring  –  to  the  All-Glorious  One,  Whose  existence  is  neces-
sary and perpetual, Who endures from pre-eternity to post-eternity, Whose 
essence is utterly remote from and exalted above corporality, Whose being 
is free of and exempt from division and multiplication, and Whose power 
is far above and beyond all impotence, is indeed such a delirium, such a 
lunatic raving that the lies and denials of those wretches who subscribe to 
such an idea are worth nothing. You must not be deceived. The scatter-
brained nonsense, the delirious ravings of every crazy lunatic, should not 
be heeded!

Or, like the rebellious, overweening worshippers of this world, who have 
made a habit of greed and miserliness, do they ﬁnd what you propose bur-
densome, so that they ﬂee from you? Do they not know that you seek your 
wage and recompense from Allah alone? Is it a burden to give to their own 
poor one fortieth of the property given to them by Allah Almighty, or a part 
of it, and as a consequence both receive plenty, and be saved from the envy 
and curses of the poor? Do they consider the command to give zakat burden-
some and therefore hold back from Islam? Their denials hold no importance, 
and what they deserve is a slap, not an answer.

imagine that the World of the Unseen, which is disclosed to no one apart 
from  the  divine  messengers,  who  receive  revelation,  and  which  no  one 
has the ability to enter, is present and laid open before them, and that they 
obtain information from it and write it down. So do not be disheartened by

That means they have become blind and do not see the perfect order and 
ﬂawless harmony throughout the universe, which is as clear as day. For in 
accordance with the decree,

reason, wisdom, feeling, and what is obvious, don’t let their lies put you off 
proclaiming the message!

Thus, of the hundreds of jewels of these verses, which constitute a series 
of truths, we have brieﬂy explained only a single jewel of the Qur’an’s man-
ner of exposition in the category of giving to understand and silencing in 
argument.  If  I  had  had  the  power  and  shown  a  few  more  jewels,  you  too 
would have said: “ These verses are a miracle just on their own. ” But the 
Qur’an’s manner of exposition in making understood and instruction is so 
wonderful, subtle, and ﬂuent that even a simple ordinary person easily com-
prehends a profound truth from the way it explains it. Yes, the Qur’an of 
Miraculous  Exposition  simply  and  clearly  teaches  most  abstruse  truths  in 
a  way  that  caresses  the  view  of  people  in  general,  and  neither  hurts  their 
feelings,  nor  irritates  their  minds,  nor  tires  them.  Just  as  when  speaking 
with a child, childish words are used, in the same way the Qur’anic styles 
come down to the level of those it addresses – called in the terminology of 
the scholars of theology, “ divine condescension to the mind of man ” – it 
addresses them in that way; through comparisons in the form of allegories, it 
allows an illiterate common person to understand abstruse divine truths and 
dominical mysteries which the minds of learned philosophers cannot rise to.

For example, by means of a comparison, the verse,

( 20:5 ) \ [ Z Y
depicts divine dominicality as a kingdom, and the degree of that domini-
cality as that of a king seated on the throne of his sovereignty exercising 
His rule. Indeed, as the speech of the All-Glorious Creator of the universe, 
the Qur’an proceeds from the ultimate degree of His dominicality, passes 
over  all  the  other  degrees  guiding  those  who  rise  to  them,  and  passing 
through seventy thousand veils, it looks to each and illuminates it. It scat-
ters its radiance and spreads its light to the thousands of levels of those it 
addresses,  the  understanding  and  intelligence  of  whom  are  all  different. 
Although it has lived through ages and centuries whose capacities are all 
different, and has broadcast its meaning to this great extent, it has not lost 
an iota of its perfect youth and juvenility, and retaining its total freshness 
and delicacy, it teaches every ordinary person in a most easy, skilful, and 
comprehensible  manner.  Whatever  aspect  of  a  wonder-displaying  book 
which thus teaches, convinces, and satisﬁes with the same lesson, the same 
words, numerous levels of people whose understanding and degrees are all 
different – whatever aspect of such a book is studied, a ﬂash of miracu-
lousness will surely appear.

THE WORDS

I n   S h o r t :  Just as when some words of the Qur’an such as “ All praise and 
thanks be to Allah ” are recited, they ﬁll a cave, which is the ear of a moun-
tain, in the same way that they ﬁll the tiny ears of a ﬂy, so too the Qur’an’s 
meanings  satisfy  ears  like  mountains  in  the  same  way  that  with  the  same 
words they teach and satisfy tiny simple minds, like a ﬂy. For the Qur’an 
calls to belief all the levels of men and jinn. It teaches the sciences of belief 
to all. In which case, the most lowly of the common people kneels shoul-
der to shoulder with the highest of the elite, and together they listen to the 
Qur’an’s teachings and beneﬁt from them. That is to say, the Holy Qur’an is 
a heavenly repast at which the thousands of different levels of minds, intel-
lects,  hearts,  and  spirits  ﬁnd  their  nourishment.  Their  desires  are  fulﬁlled 
and their appetites are satisﬁed. In fact, numerous of its doors remain closed 
and are left to those who will come in the future. If you want an example 
of this category, from beginning to end the Qur’an provides examples of it. 
All the Qur’an’s students and those who listen to its teachings – the inter-
preters of the law, the veracious ones, the Islamic philosophers, the sages, 
the scholars of jurisprudence and scholars of theology, the saintly guides of 
those seeking knowledge of Allah, the spiritual poles of the lovers of Allah, 
the learned and exacting scholars, and the mass of Muslims – unanimously 
declare: “ We understand thoroughly what the Qur’an teaches us. ” In short, 
ﬂashes  of  the  Qur’an’s  miraculousness  sparkle  in  the  category  of  making 
understood and instruction just as they do in the other categories.

This Ray is the Qur’an’s extraordinary comprehensiveness. It consists of 

T h e   F i r s t   F l a s h   is  the  comprehensiveness  in  the  words.  This  compre-
hensiveness is clearly apparent from the verses mentioned both in  all the 
previous Words, and in this Word. As is indicated by the Hadith 
ّدَ(cid:110)َو ٌنْ(cid:143)َ(cid:92)َو ٌرْ(cid:183)َ(cid:146) ٍةَ(cid:192)ٰا  ّ

the  words  of  the  Qur’an  have  been  positioned  in  such  a  way  that  all  its 
phrases, words even, and even letters, and sometimes even an omission, 
has many aspects. It gives to all those it addresses their share from a dif-
ferent door.

Take, for example, the verse,

( 78:7 ) : 9

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – SECOND RAY

a phrase which says, “ I made the mountains as stakes and masts for that earth 
of yours. ” An ordinary person’s share from this phrase would be this: he 
sees the mountains which appear like stakes driven into the ground, thinks of 
the beneﬁts and bounties in them, and offers thanks to his Creator. A poet’s 
share  from  this  phrase:  he  imagines  the  earth  as  the  ground  on  which  is 
pitched in a sweeping arc, the dome of the heavens like a mighty green tent 
adorned with electric lamps, and he sees the mountains skirting the base of 
the heavens to be the pegs of the tent. He worships the All-Glorious Maker 
in wondering amazement.

A tent-dwelling literary man’s share of this phrase: he imagines the face 
of the earth to be a barren desert and the mountain chains as the multifarious 
tents of nomads, as if the soil layer had been cast over high posts and the 
pointed tips of the posts had raised up the cloth of the soil, which he sees as 
the habitation of numerous different creatures looking one to the other. He 
prostrates in wonder before the Glorious Creator, Who placed and pitched 
so easily these august and mighty beings like tents on the face of the earth.

The share of a geographer with a literary bent from this phrase: he thinks 
of the globe of the earth as a ship sailing the oceans of either the air or the 
æther, and the mountains as masts and posts driven into the ship to balance 
َكَ(cid:178)اَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126) before the All-Powerful 
and stabilize it. He declares:  َكَ(cid:178)اَ(cid:130) َمـَ(cid:147)ْ(cid:150)َا اَ(cid:174) 
One of Perfection, Who makes the mighty globe as an orderly ship, places 
us on it, and makes it voyage through the far reaches of the world.

A sociologist and philosopher of human society’s share of this phrase; 
his  thoughts  would  go  like  this:  the  earth  is  a  house,  and  the  supporting 
post of the house’s life is animal life, while the supporting post of animal 
life are water, air, and earth, the conditions of life. And the supporting post  
of water, air, and earth are the mountains. For the mountains are the reser-
voirs for water, the combs for the air: they precipitate the noxious gases and 
purify it; they are the earth’s preserver: they preserve it from being trans-
formed into a swamp, and from the encroachment of the sea. They are also 
the treasuries for other necessities of human life. In utter reverence he offers 
praise  and  thanks  to  the  Maker  of  Glory  and  Kindness,  Who  made  these 
great mountains as posts for the earth – the house of our life – in this way, 
and appointed them as the keepers of the treasuries of our livelihood.

The share of a scholar of natural science from this phrase would be this: 
he  would  think  of  the  earthquakes  and  tremors  which  occur  as  the  result 
of  upheavals  and  fusions  in  the  heart  of  the  earth  being  calmed  with  the 
upthrust of mountains; that the emergence of mountains is the cause of the 

442

THE WORDS

earth’s stable rotation on its axis and in its orbit and its not deviating in its 
annual rotation as a result of the convulsions of earthquakes; and that the 
anger and wrath of the earth is quieted through it breathing through the vents 
in the mountains. He would come to believe completely, and would exclaim: 
ِ(cid:195) ُة َ(cid:175)ﯰﯧ ِ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا

Another example:

( 21:30 ) l k j i h g 
A  scholar  untainted  by  the  study  of  philosophy  would  explain  the  words 
k  like this: while the skies were shining and cloudless and the earth was 
dry and without life and incapable of giving birth, the skies were opened 
up with rain and the earth with vegetation, and all living beings were cre-
ated through a sort of marriage and impregnation. To do this was the work 
of One so Powerful and Glorious that the face of the earth is merely a small 
garden of His, while the clouds veiling the face of the skies, sponges for 
watering it. The scholar understands this and prostrates before the tremen-
dousness of His power.

A searching philosopher would explain the same words in this way: while 
at the start of creation the heavens and earth were a formless mass, each con-
sisting of wet dough-like matter without beneﬁt, offspring, or creatures, the 
All-Wise Creator both rolled them out and expanded them into a beautiful, 
beneﬁcial form, and made them the source of numerous adorned creatures. 
The philosopher would stand in wonder before the breadth of His wisdom.

A  modern  philosopher  would  explain  the  words  thus:  originally,  our 
globe and the other planets which form the solar system were fused together 
in the form of an undifferentiated dough. Then the All-Powerful  and Self-
Subsistent  One  rolled  out  the  dough  and  placed  each  of  the  planets  in  its 
position; leaving the sun where it was and bringing the earth here, He spread 
earth over the globe of the earth and sprinkled it with rain from the skies, 
scattered light over it from the sun, and inhabited it placing us on it. The 
philosopher would pull his head out of the swamp of nature, and declare: 

And another example:

ِدَ(cid:110)َ

ْ(cid:202)ا  ِد ِ(cid:110)اَوْ(cid:170)ا ِ

ّ(cid:195)اِ(cid:92)  ُتْ(cid:179)َ(cid:174)ٰا

( 36:38 ) ¶ μ ´ ³
The L ā m , translated here as ‘to’ also expresses the meaning of ‘in’. Thus, 
ordinary  believers  see  it  as  meaning  ‘to’  and  understand  that  the  sun, 

ِ
ٰ
ّ
ٰ
TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – SECOND RAY

443

which is a mobile lamp providing light and heat for them, will certainly con-
clude its journeying and reach its place of rest, then take on a form which 
will no longer be beneﬁcial. Pondering over the great bounties the All-Glo-
rious Creator has attached to the sun, they declare: “ Glory be to Allah! All 
praise and thanks be to Allah! ”

A learned scholar would also ascribe the L ā m  the meaning of ‘to’, but he 
would think of it not only as a lamp, but also as a shuttle weaving the Sus-
tainer’s tapestries on the loom of spring and summer, as an ink-pot whose 
ink is light for the Eternally Besought One’s letters written on the pages of 
night and day. Thinking of the order and regularity of the world, of which 
the apparent movement of the sun is a sign and to which it points, he would 
exclaim before His wisdom: “ What wonders Allah has willed! ”, and declare 
before the All-Wise Maker’s art: “ How great are His blessings! ”, and he 
would bow in prostration. 

A geographer and philosopher would explain the L ā m  as meaning ‘in’, 
like  this:  the  sun  orders  and  propels  the  solar  system  at  the  divine  com-
mand and with a spring-like motion on its own axis. Exclaiming in wonder 
and amazement before the All-Glorious Maker Who thus creates and sets 
in order this mighty clock: “ All mightiness is Allah’s and all power! ”, he 
would cast away philosophy and embrace the wisdom of the Qur’an.

A precise scholar would consider this L ā m  as both causal and adverbial, 
and would explain it like this: “ Since the All-Wise Maker has made appar-
ent causes a veil to His works, through a divine law of His called gravity, 
He has tied the planets to the sun like stones in a sling and causes them to 
revolve with different but regular motions within the sphere of His wisdom; 
and He has made the sun’s spinning on its own axis an apparent cause giving 
rise to the gravity. That is, the meaning of μ  is 
اَ(cid:183)ِ(cid:99)َ(cid:174)وُ(cid:147)ْ(cid:179)َ(cid:174) ِراَرْ(cid:163)ِ(cid:99) ْ(cid:126)ِ
ٍرَ(cid:163)َ(cid:99) ْ(cid:127)ُ(cid:174) يِ(cid:158)  it is in motion in its own appointed place for 
the stability of the solar system. For it is a divine rule, a dominical law like 
motion apparently giving rise to heat, and heat giving rise to force, and force  
giving  rise  to  gravity. ”  On  understanding  this  from  a  single  letter  of  the 
Qur’an, the philosopher would declare: “ All praise and thanks be to Allah! 
It is in the Qur’an that true wisdom is to be found. I consider philosophy to 
be worth virtually nothing! ”

ِ(cid:202) اَ(cid:183)َ(cid:170) ّ

And the following idea would occur to a thinker of poetic bent from this 
La\m and the stability mentioned above: “ The sun is a luminous tree and the 

444

THE WORDS

planets are its mobile fruits. But contrary to trees the sun shakes itself so the 
fruits do not fall. If it did not shake itself, they would fall and be scattered. ” 
Then he would think to himself: “ The sun is the ecstatic leader of a group 
reciting Allah’s names. It recites in ecstasy in the centre of the circle and 
causes others to recite. ” In another treatise, I described this idea as follows:
Ye s ,   t h e   s u n   i s   a   f r u i t - b e a r i n g   t r e e ;   i t   s h a k e s   i t s e l f ,   s o   t h a t   t h e   p l a n e t s  

I f   i t   r e s t e d   i n   s i l e n c e ,   t h e   a t t r a c t i o n   w o u l d   c e a s e ;   a n d   t h e y   w o u l d   w e e p  

f a l l   n o t ,   i t s   f r u i t s .

t h r o u g h   s p a c e ,   i t s   e c s t a t i c s .

A further example:

( 2:5 ) > = <
This verse is general and unspeciﬁc, it does not specify in what way they 
shall  be  successful  so  that  each  person  may  ﬁnd  what  he  wants  in  it.  Its 
words are few so that they may be lengthy. For the aim of some of those it is 
addressing is to be saved from the Fire. Others think only of Paradise. Some 
desire eternal happiness. Yet others seek only Allah’s pleasure. While others 
know their aim and desire to be the vision of Allah; and so on. In numer-
ous places, the Qur’an leaves the words open in this way so that they might 
be general. It leaves things unsaid so that it can express many meanings. It 
makes it brief so that everyone may ﬁnd his share. Thus, it says, >   
It does not determine how they shall prosper. It is as if with this omission 
it  is  saying:  “ O  Muslims!  Good  news!  O  you  who  fear  Allah!  You  shall 
ﬁnd prosperity through being saved from Hell. O righteous one! You shall 
ﬁnd prosperity in Paradise. O you who seeks knowledge of Allah! You will 
attain Allah’s pleasure. O lover of Allah! You will experience the vision of 
Allah. ” And so on. 

Thus,  out  of  thousands  we  have  offered  one  example  of  each  of  the 
phrases, words, letters, and omissions illustrating the comprehensiveness of 
the Qur’an’s words. You may make analogies and compare its verses and 
stories with these.

Another example, the verse,

( 47:19 ) ã â á à ß Þ Ý Ü
This verse contains so many aspects and degrees that all the levels of saints 
have  found  their  needs  from  it  in  all  their  spiritual  journeyings  and  in  all 
their  degrees,  and  have  found  spiritual  sustenance  and  a  fresh  meaning 
from  it  appropriate  for  their  own  level.  For,  since  the  name  of  Allah  is  a 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – SECOND RAY

445

comprehensive name, it comprises aspects of divine unity to the number of 
ّ(cid:202)ِا  َن ٰ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:110)َر  َ(cid:202)  *  َوُ(cid:182)  َ
the most beautiful names: َوُ(cid:182)  َ
ّزَر  َ(cid:202) :  ْىَا  
and so on. 

ّ(cid:202)ِا  َقِ(cid:170)اَ(cid:114)  َ(cid:202)  *  َوُ(cid:182)  َ

ّ(cid:202)ِا  َقاَ

And, for example, among the stories of the Qur’an, the story of Moses 
( Upon whom be peace ) contains thousands of beneﬁts, just like the staff of 
Moses. There are numerous aims and aspects in the story, such as consol-
ing and comforting the Prophet Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ), threatening the unbelievers, censuring the dissemblers, and rebuking 
the Jews. For this reason it is repeated in many suras. Although it expresses 
all the aims in every place it is repeated, only one is the main aim and the 
others are secondary.

I f   y o u   s a y :  How can we know all the meanings in the examples you have 

given, which the Qur’an intends and points to?

W e   w o u l d   r e p l y :  Since the Qur’an is a pre-eternal address, and sitting 
above and beyond the centuries, which, layer upon layer, are all different, 
addresses  and  instructs  all  of  humankind  lined  up  within  them,  certainly 
it  will  include  and  intend  numerous  meanings  according  to  those  varying 
understandings  and  will  make  allusions  to  what  it  intends.  The  numerous 
meanings contained in the Qur’an’s words similar to those mentioned here 
have been proved in I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z  ( Signs of Miraculousness ) according 
to the rules of Arabic grammar and syntax, and the sciences of ﬁgurative 
speech, the semantics of syntax, and rhetoric, and their rules. According to 
the  consensus  of  those  qualiﬁed  to  interpret  the  Shari‘a  and  the  Qur’anic 
commentators and scholars of theology and jurisprudence, and according to 
the testimony of their differences, on condition they are considered correct 
by the sciences of Arabic and the principles of religion, all the aspects and 
meanings which are found acceptable by the science of ﬁgurative speech, 
and appropriate by the science of the semantics of syntax, and desirable by 
the science of rhetoric, may be considered among the Qur’an’s meanings. 
The Qur’an has placed allusions to each of those meanings according to its 
degree. They are either literal or signiﬁcative. If signiﬁcative, there are allu-
sions to them in either the preceding context or the after context or in other 
verses. Some of them have been expounded in the hundreds of thousands 
of  Qur’anic  commentaries  of  twenty,  thirty,  forty,  sixty,  and  even  eighty 
volumes, written by exacting scholars, which are clear and decisive proofs 
of the extraordinary comprehensiveness of the Qur’an’s  words. However, if 
in this Word we were to point out the allusions indicating all the meanings 

446

THE WORDS

together with their rules, the discussion would become extremely prolonged. 
So we cut it short here, and for a part of it, refer you to I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z .

Second Flash

S e c o n d   F l a s h :  This is the extraordinary comprehensiveness of its mean-
ing.  Yes,  together  with  bestowing  from  the  treasuries  of  its  meaning  the 
sources for all the interpreters of the Shari‘a, the illuminations of all those 
seeking knowledge of Allah, the ways of all those seeking union with Allah, 
the paths of all the perfected from among mankind, and the schools of all the 
scholars, the Qur’an has at all times been the guide of all of them and has 
directed them in their progress; it is veriﬁed unanimously by all that it has 
illuminated their ways from its treasuries.

Third Flash

T h i r d   F l a s h :  This is the extraordinary comprehensiveness of its knowl-
edge. The Qur’an has caused to ﬂow forth from the oceans of its knowledge, 
the numerous and various sciences of the Shari‘a, the multifarious sciences 
of reality ( h a k i k a t  ), and the innumerable different sciences of Suﬁsm ( t a r i -
k a t  ). Similarly, it has caused to ﬂow forth in abundance and good order the 
true wisdom of the sphere of contingency, the true sciences of the sphere of 
necessity, and the enigmatic knowledge of the sphere of the hereafter. One 
would have to write a whole volume to provide examples of this Flash, and 
so as mere samples, we point to the twenty-ﬁve Words so far written. Yes, 
the veracious truths of all twenty-ﬁve Words comprise a mere twenty-ﬁve 
droplets  from  the  ocean  of  the  Qur’an’s  knowledge.  Any  errors  in  those 
Words spring from my defective understanding.

Fourth Flash

F o u r t h   F l a s h :  This is the extraordinary comprehensiveness of the sub-
jects it advances. Together with bringing together the extensive subjects of 
man and his duties, the universe and the Creator of the universe, the heavens 
and the earth, this world and the hereafter, the past and the future, and pre-
eternity and post-eternity, the Qur’an explains all the essential and important 
topics from man’s creation from seminal ﬂuid till when he enters the grave; 
from  the  correct  conduct  of  eating  and  sleeping  to  the  matters  of  divine 
decree and determining; from the creation of the world in six days, to the 
duties of the wind blowing, indicated by the oaths of,

to their being rent with smoke and the stars falling and being scattered in 
inﬁnite space; from the world’s being opened for test and examination, to its 
closing; from the grave, the ﬁrst dwelling of the hereafter, and then from the 
Intermediate Realm, the resurrection, and the Bridge, to eternal happiness; 
from the events of the past, and the creation of the body of Adam and the 
dispute of his two sons, to the Flood, and the drowning of the people of Phar-
aoh, and the major events of most of the prophets; and from the pre-eternal 
circumstance alluded to by,

to the post-eternal occurrence expressed by,

( 7:172 ) C B 

( 75:22-23 ) / . -  *  + * ) 
all these fundamental, important subjects are explained in a way beﬁtting 
the All-Glorious One Who administers the whole universe as though it were 
a palace, and opens and closes this world and the hereafter like two rooms, 
and  regulates  the  earth  as  if  it  were  a  garden  and  the  heavens  as  though 
they were a roof adorned with lamps, and beholds the past and the future as 
though they were two pages present in His sight like a single night and day, 
and looks on pre-eternity and post-eternity as though they were yesterday 
and tomorrow, like the two sides of a chain  of  events are joined  together 
and touching in present time. Just as a master builder speaks of two houses 
he  has  constructed  and  arranged,  and  makes  out  the  programme  and  list 
and index of the matters involved; so the Qur’an is ﬁtting for the One Who 

448

THE WORDS

makes the universe and arranges it, and writes out and displays the list and 
index and – if one may say so – the programme of  the matters concerned 
with it. There is no sign of any artiﬁciality or false display. And just as there 
is no trace of imitation or hint of any fraud as though it were speaking on 
behalf of someone else or supposing itself to be in someone else’s place and 
speaking, so too with all its seriousness, all its purity, all its sincerity, the 
Qur’an’s  pure,  shining,  brilliant  exposition  declares:  “ I  am  the  word  and 
exposition of the Creator of the world, ” just as the light of day declares: “ I 
came from the sun. ”

Indeed, apart from the Maker Who adorns this world with antique arts 
and ﬁlls its with delicious bounties and scatters bountifully over the face of 
the world together with these wonders of His art so many valuable gifts, and 
setting them in orderly lines spreads them out over the face of the earth, apart 
from this Bestower of Bounties, who else could the Qur’an of Miraculous 
Exposition be ﬁtting for – the Qur’an which ﬁlls the world with this clamour 
of salutation and acclaim, this resounding praise and thanks, and transforms 
the earth into a place for the recitation of Allah’s names, a mosque, and place 
for gazing on the divine works of art? Whose speech could it be apart from 
His? Who can claim ownership of it apart from Him? Whose word could it 
be other than His? Whose light could the exposition of the Qur’an be, which 
solves the talisman of creation and illuminates the world, other than the Pre-
Eternal Sun’s? Who has the ability to produce the like of it, and imitate it? 
In truth, it is impossible for the Artist Who adorns this world with His arts 
not to speak with man, who appreciates His art. Since He makes and knows, 
He  surely  speaks.  And  since  He  speaks,  it  is  surely  the  Qur’an  which  is 
appropriate to His speech. How should a Lord of All Dominion Who is not 
indifferent to the way a ﬂower is ordered remain indifferent to a discourse 
which brings all His dominion to a clamour of salutation and praise? Would 
He permit it to be attributed to others and be made as nothing?

Fifth Flash

F i f t h   F l a s h :  This is the wonderful comprehensiveness of the Qur’an’s 

style and conciseness. It consists of ﬁve glows.

First Glow

F i r s t   G l o w :  The Qur’an’s style has a comprehensiveness so wonderful 
that a single sura contains the ocean of the Qur’an, which in turn contains the 
universe. A single of its verses contains the treasury of the sura. And most 
of the verses are each a short sura, while most of the suras are short Qur’ans. 
Thus, this is a great favour and guidance and facilitating, and arises from its 
miraculous conciseness. For although everyone has need of the Qur’an all 
the time, either due to foolishness or for some other reason, they do not have 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – SECOND RAY

449

the time to read all of it, or they do not have the opportunity. So in order 
that they should not to be deprived of it, each sura is like a short Qur’an, 
and each long verse even has the rank of a sura. Those who  penetrate to the 
inner meaning of things agree that the whole Qur’an is contained in the Sura 
al-Fatiha, even, and the Fatiha in the B i s m i l l a h . The proof of this fact is the 
consensus of the scholars who have investigated it.

Second Glow

S e c o n d   G l o w :  The verses of the Qur’an are comprehensive through their 
denoting and indicating all the categories of speech and true knowledge and 
human needs, such as command and prohibition, promise and threat, encour-
agement and deterring, restraint and guidance, stories and comparisons, the 
divine ordinances and teachings, the sciences related to the universe, and the 
laws and conditions of personal life, social life, the life of the heart, spiritual 
life, and the life of the hereafter. By reason of this, the truth of the saying, 
َتْ(cid:87) ِ(cid:130) ا َ(cid:175)ـِ(cid:170)  َتْ(cid:87) ِ(cid:130) اَ(cid:174) ْذُ(cid:114) “ Take whatever you want from the Qur’an for whatever 
you want ” has been so accepted by the people of reality that it has become 
proverbial  among  them.  The  verses  of  the  Qur’an  have  such  comprehen-
siveness that they may be the cure for every ill and the sustenance for every 
need. Yes, they have to be like that, for the absolute guide of all the levels 
of the people of perfection, who continually rise in the degrees of progress, 
has to possess this property.

Third Glow

T h i r d   G l o w :  This is the Qur’an’s miraculously inimitable conciseness. It 
sometimes happens that the Qur’an mentions the two ends of a long chain in 
such a way that it shows clearly the whole chain. And sometimes it happens 
that it includes explicitly, implicitly, ﬁguratively, or allusively in one word 
many proofs of an assertion. For example, the verse:

( 30:22 ) v u t s r q p o
by mentioning the beginning and end of the chain of the universe’s creation, 
which forms a chain of signs and indications of divine unity, the verse shows 
the second chain. It makes the ﬁrst chain read it out. Yes, the ﬁrst degree of 
the world’s pages which testify to an All-Wise Maker is the origin of the 
heavens  and  the  earth,  their  creation.  Next  is  the  heavens  being  adorned 
with stars and the earth made to rejoice with living beings. Then the change 
of the seasons through the subjugation of the sun and the moon. Then is the 
alternation of day and night, and the chain of events within these. And so 
it goes on as far as the characteristics and distinguishing features on faces 
and in voices, the most widely spread loci of multiplicity. Thus, since there 
is an astonishing and wise order in the characteristics of individual faces, 

450

THE WORDS

which  are  the  furthest  from  order  and  most  subject  to  the  interference  of 
chance, if it is shown that the pen of a wise craftsman works there, surely 
the  other  pages,  whose  order  is  clear,  will  themselves  be  understood  and 
display their Inscriber. And since the works of art and  wisdom of a Maker 
are  apparent  in  the  original  creation  of  the  vast  heavens  and  earth,  Who 
positions  them  purposefully  as  the  foundation  stones  of  the  palace  of  the 
universe; the works of His art and the impress of His wisdom will surely be 
most clear in His other beings. Thus, by exposing the concealed and con-
cealing the obvious, this verse expresses a truly beautiful succinctness.

Similarly in the verses from:
2 1 0 / . - .... till

( 30:17-27 ) P O N M L K J I H G 
the  chain  of  proofs  which  begins  six  times  with  the  words, p o 
p o is a sequence of jewels, a sequence of light, a sequence of mirac-
ulous inimitability, a sequence of miraculous conciseness. I wish from the 
heart to display the hidden diamonds in these treasuries, but what can I do?, 
the discussion here does not support it. So postponing it to another time, I 
am not opening that door for now.

And for example:

( 12:45-46 ) 9 8 7 * 5 ...

Between 5 and 7 are these words:

ُف ُ(cid:126)وُ(cid:192)  َلاَ(cid:162)َو  ِنْ(cid:107) ّ

ِ(cid:127)(cid:170)ا ىَ(cid:170)ِا  َبَ(cid:182)َذَ(cid:158) ُهوُ(cid:171) َ(cid:126)ْرَاَ(cid:158) اَ(cid:192)ْؤُ

That is to say, although ﬁve sentences have been abbreviated and summa-
rized in one sentence, it does not mar the clarity or hinder the understanding.

And, for example:

( 36:80 ) ¤ £ ¢ ¡ ﮯ ~ }
Here  the  Qur’an  is  saying  in  the  face  of  rebellious  man’s  denials,  who  is 
as though challenging the Qur’an by saying, “ Who will raise to life rotten 
bones? ”, “ Whoever created them in the ﬁrst place, He will raise them to life. 
And their Creator knows every single aspect of every single thing. Further-
more, He who provides ﬁre for you from the green tree, is able to give life 
to dry bones. ” Thus, this sentence looks in numerous ways to the claim that 
man will raised to life, and proves it. 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – SECOND RAY

451

Firstly, with these words the Qur’an starts off the chain of bounties it lays 
before man, moves its forward, and calls it to mind. Having described it in 
detail in other verses, it cuts short the description here, and refers it to the 
intelligence. That is, “ You cannot ﬂee from the One Who gives you fruit and 
ﬁre from trees, sustenance and seeds from plants, cereals and grains from 
the earth, and makes the earth a ﬁne cradle for you ﬁlled with all your suste-
nance, and the world a palace in which is found all your  needs – you cannot 
be independent of Him, or disappear into non-existence and hide there. You 
cannot enter the grave without duties to sleep in comfort not to be awoken.

Then it points out an evidence of the claim. With the words, 

£ ¢ it implies: “ O you who deny resurrection! Look at the trees! 
One Who raises to life and makes green in spring numberless bone-like trees 
which  have  been  dead  throughout  winter,  and  in  every  tree  even  demon-
strates three examples of resurrection through the leaves, blossoms, and fruit 
– the power of such a One cannot be challenged through denial or by consid-
ering resurrection improbable. ” 

Then  it  points  out  another  evidence,  saying:  “ How  do  you  deem  it 
unlikely that One Who extracts for you out of the dense, heavy, dark matter 
of a tree, subtle, light, luminous matter like ﬁre should give ﬁre-like life and 
light-like consciousness to wood-like bones? ” 

Then it states another evidence explicitly; it says: “ One Who creates 
the famous tree which while green produces ﬁre for nomads in place of 
matches when two of its branches are rubbed together, and combines two 
opposites like the green and damp and the dry and hot, and makes them 
the source of the ﬁre – everything, even the fundamental elements, looks to 
His command and acts through His power. It cannot be considered unlikely 
that the One Who demonstrates that none of these is independent and acts 
of its own accord should raise up man from the earth once again, who was 
made from earth and later returned to the earth. He may not be challenged 
with rebellion. ”

Then, recalling Moses’s ( Upon whom be peace ) famous tree, it shows 
that this claim of Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) is also 
that of Moses ( UWP ). Lightly alluding to the consensus of the prophets, it 
adds one more subtle point to the phrase.

Fourth Glow

F o u r t h   G l o w :  The Qur’an’s conciseness is so comprehensive and won-
derful  that  when  studied  carefully  it  becomes  apparent  that  sometimes, 
through some simple detail or particular event, it compassionately shows to 

452

THE WORDS

simple, ordinary minds extensive, lengthy, universal rules and general laws, 
like showing an ocean in a ewer. We shall point out only two examples of 
this out of thousands.

First Example: This is the three verses expounded in detail in the First 
Station of the Twentieth Word, which describe under the title of the teach-
ing of the names to the person of Adam, the teaching of all the sciences and 
branches of knowledge with which the sons of Adam have been inspired. 
Through the angels prostrating before Adam and Satan not prostrating, they 
state that most beings from ﬁsh to angels are subjugated to  humankind, just 
as harmful creatures from snakes to Satan do not obey man and are hostile 
to him. And with the people of Moses ( Upon whom be peace ) slaughter-
ing a cow, they state that the concept of cow-worship – which was taken 
from the worship of cows in Egypt and showed its effect in the event of the 
calf – was slaughtered by Moses’ knife. And with water gushing forth from 
the rock and springs ﬂowing out and spreading, they also state that the rock 
layer which is under the soil layer acts as the source of both water springs 
and the soil.

Second Example: This is the whole and the parts of the story of Moses 
( Upon  whom  be  peace ),  which  is  frequently  repeated  in  the  Qur’an,  and 
each of the repetitions of which is shown to be the tip of a universal rule, 
with each repetition stating the rule in question. For example:

( 40:36 ) a ` _ ^ 
Pharaoh is commanding his minister: “ Build me a high tower so that I can 
take a look at the heavens and observe them. I wonder if there is a Allah 
who  governs  in  the  skies  like  Moses  claims,  who  can  be  seen  from  their 
disposition? ” Thus, through the word a and this minor incident, it states 
a  strange  rule  dominant  in  the  traditions  of  the  Egyptian  Pharaohs,  who, 
because they lived in the desert with no mountains, wanted mountains, and 
because they did not recognize the Creator, were worshippers of nature and 
claimed godhead; and worshipping fame, by displaying the works of their 
dominion perpetuated their name and constructed the famous mountain-like 
pyramids; and agreed to magic and metempsychosis, and had their corpses 
mummiﬁed and preserved in their mountain-like tombs.

And, for example:

( 10:92 ) U T S
By saying to the drowning Pharaoh: “ Today I am going to save your body 
which will drown, ” it is expressing a death-tainted, exemplary rule of the 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – SECOND RAY

453

Pharaohs’ lives, which was, as a consequence of the idea of metempsychosis 
and mummifying their bodies, to take them from the past and send them to 
be viewed by the generations of the future. This present century a body was 
discovered which was the very body of Pharaoh, thrown up on the seashore 
where he drowned. The verse thus states a miraculous sign of the Unseen, 
that the body was to be borne on the waves of the centuries and cast up from 
the sea of time onto the shore of this century.

And, for example:

( 2:49 ) , + * ) 
Referring to an event in the time of one of the Pharaohs, the slaughtering 
of  the  sons  of  the  Children  of  Israel  and  the  sparing  of  their  women  and  
daughters, it mentions the numerous massacres which the Jewish nation has 
suffered every age, and the role their women and girls have played in dis-
solute human life.

    ( 5:62 ) ¢ ¡ ﮯ ~ } | { z
   ( 5:64 ) ê é è ç æ å ä ã â
   ( 17:4 ) Y X W V U T S R Q P
( 2:60 ) i h g f e
These two statements of the Qur’an directed at the Jews, comprise the two 
fearsome general rules, that their nation hatches plots in human social life 
with their trickery. For they have shaken human society by making labour 
contest capital and causing the poor to clash with the rich by founding banks 
through usury and compound interest, and amassing wealth through wiles 
and  fraud.  Moreover,  it  was  again  that  nation  who,  in  order  to  take  their 
revenge on the victors and governments under which they had suffered dep-
rivation  and  oppression,  were  involved  in  every  sort  of  corrupting  covert 
organization and had a ﬁnger in every sort of revolution.

And, for example:

( 2:94 ) . -
That is, “ If what you say is true, seek death, but you won’t seek it! ” Thus, 
regarding a minor incident in a small gathering in the presence of the Prophet 

454

THE WORDS

( UWBP ), it points out that the Jewish nation, which is famous among the 
nations of mankind for its greed for life and fear of death, will not, accord-
ing to its tongue of disposition, seek death till Doomsday and will not give 
up its greed for life.

And, for example:

( 2:61 ) ¸ ¶ μ ´
With this, it describes generally that nation’s future destiny. It is because of 
these fearsome rules governing the destiny and character of this nation that 
the Qur’an acts so severely against them. It deals them awesomely punish-
ing  blows.  You  may  draw  analogies  from  these  examples  with  the  other 
stories and passages about Moses ( Upon whom be peace ) and the Children 
of Israel. There are very many ﬂashes of miraculousness like the ﬂash in this 
Fourth Glow behind the simple words and speciﬁc subjects of the Qur’an. A 
hint is enough for the wise.

Fifth Glow

F i f t h   G l o w :   This  is  the  Qur’an’s  extraordinary  comprehensiveness  in  
regard to its aims and subjects, meanings and styles, and its subtle qualities 
and ﬁne virtues. Indeed, if the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition’s suras and 
verses  are  studied  carefully,  especially  the  openings  of  the  suras,  and  the 
beginnings and ends of the verses, it will be seen that not a trace of confu-
sion is apparent although it gathers together all the categories of rhetoric, 
all  the  parts  of  ﬁne  speech,  all  the  classes  of  elevated  styles,  all  sorts  of 
ﬁne morality, all the summaries of the sciences relating to the universe, all 
the indexes of divine knowledge, all the beneﬁcial rules for individual and 
social human life, and all the luminous laws of the exalted physical sciences. 
In  truth,  to  gather  together  in  one  place  this  many  different  categories  of 
knowledge and cause no disagreement or difﬁculty can only be the work of 
an overwhelming miraculous order.

Then, as is expounded and proved in the previous twenty-four Words, 
together  with  maintaining  the  order  within  this  comprehensiveness,  to 
rend the veils of the habitual and commonplace, which are the source of 
compounded ignorance, and to draw out the wonders concealed beneath 
them and display them; to smash with the diamond sword of proof the idol 
of  nature,  which  is  the  source  of  misguidance;  to  scatter  with  thunder-
ous  trumpet-blasts  the  dense  layers  of  the  sleep  of  heedlessness;  and  to 
uncover  and  reveal  the  obscure  talisman  of  being  and  the  strange  riddle 
of the creation of the world, before which human philosophy and science 
have  remained  impotent  –  to  do  this  could  surely  only  be  the  wondrous 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – THIRD RAY

455

work of a wonder-worker like the Qur’an – the Qur’an, which sees reality, 
is familiar with the Unseen, bestows guidance, and shows the truth.

If the Qur’an’s verses are considered carefully and fairly, it will be seen 
that they do not resemble a gradual chain of thought, following one or two 
aims,  like  other  books.  For  the  Qur’an’s  manner  is  sudden  and  instanta-
neous;  it  is  inspired  on  the  moment;  its  mark  is  that  all  its  aspects  arrive 
together but independently from distant places, a most serious and important 
discourse which comes singly and concisely. 

Yes,  who  apart  from  the  universe’s  Creator  could  produce  a  discourse 
concerned to this degree with both the universe and its Creator? Who could 
step beyond his mark to an inﬁnite degree and make the All-Glorious Crea-
tor  speak  according  to  his  own  whims,  then  make  the  universe  speak  the 
truth? Yes, in the Qur’an, the universe’s Maker is seen to be speaking and 
making others speak seriously and truthfully and in elevated, true fashion. 
There is no sign to suggest imitation. He speaks and makes speak. If, to sup-
pose the impossible, someone like Musaylima were to step beyond his mark 
to an inﬁnite degree, and by way of imitation make the All-Glorious Creator, 
the Sublime and Majestic One, speak according to his own ideas,  and the 
universe as well, there certainly would be thousands of signs of imitation 
and indications of falsehood. For when the contemptible assume the manner 
of the lofty, their every action shows up their pretence. So consider carefully 
these verses, which proclaim this fact with an oath:

Third Ray

• THIRD RAY

This is the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition’s miraculous inimitability, 
which proceeds from its giving news of the Unseen, its preserving its youth 
in every age, and its being appropriate to every level of person. This Ray has 
three Radiances.

First Radiance

FIRST RADIANCE: This is its giving news of the Unseen. It consists 

of three Glistens.

The First Glisten

T h e   F i r s t   G l i s t e n   is  its  telling  about  the  past,  one  part  of  the  Unseen. 
Indeed, the All-Wise Qur’an mentions through the tongue of a person whom 
everyone agreed was both unlettered and trustworthy, the important events 
and signiﬁcant facts concerning the prophets from the time of Adam till the 
Era of Bliss in a way which, conﬁrmed by scriptures like the Torah and the 

456

THE WORDS

Bible, tells of them with the greatest power and seriousness. It concurs with 
the  points  on  which  the  former  Books  were  agreed,  and  decides  between 
them on the points over which they differed, pointing out the truth of the 
matter. That is to say, the Qur’an’s view which penetrates the Unseen sees 
the events of the past in a way over and above all the previous scriptures, 
and pronounces them right and conﬁrms them in the matters on which they 
are agreed, and acts as arbiter between them, correcting matters about which 
they are at variance.

However, the facts the Qur’an relates about the events of the past are not 
things that could have been learnt through the exercise of reason that they 
were communicated by it; they were rather transmitted knowledge, depend-
ent on the heavens, on Revelation. And as for transmitted knowledge, it is 
the domain of those who know how to read and write, yet these facts were 
revealed to someone known by friend and foe alike as knowing neither how 
to read nor how to write, and as being trustworthy; someone described as 
unlettered.

Also, the Qur’an tells of those past events as though it had actually seen 
them. For it takes the spirit and vital point of a lengthy event, and makes 
them introductory to its purpose. That is to say, the summaries and extracts 
which the Qur’an contains show that it sees all the past together with all its  
events. For just as someone who is an expert in some science or craft shows 
his  skill  and  proﬁciency  through  some  succinct  words  or  a  concise  state-
ment, so the summaries and spirits of events mentioned in the Qur’an show 
that the one who said them comprehends all the events and sees them, and, 
if one may say so, relates them with extraordinary skill.

The Second Glisten

T h e   S e c o n d   G l i s t e n  is its giving news of the future, which is another part 
of the Unseen. There are many sorts of these predictions. The ﬁrst sort is 
particular, and special to the saints and those seek the truth through illumina-
tion. For example, Muhyiddin al-‘Arabi discovered numerous instances of 
the Qur’an’s giving news of the Unseen in the sura,

( 30:1-2 ) ~ } *{
And Imam-i Rabbani saw many signs of the events of the Unseen and the 
communicating of them through the Disjointed Letters at the beginning of 
some suras, and so on. For scholars of the Batiniyya School, the Qur’an con-
sisted from beginning to end of information about the Unseen. We, however, 
shall indicate some which are general. These too have many levels, one of 
which we shall discuss. Thus, the All-Wise Qur’an says to Allah’s Noble

1.  Since these verses which give news of the Unseen have been expounded in numer-
ous Qur’anic commentaries, and also due to the haste imposed on the author by his inten-
tion to have this work printed in the old [ Ottoman ] script,* they have not been explained 
here  and  those  valuable  treasuries  have  remained  closed.  ( *See,  page  385,  footnote  1

The information about the Unseen which many verses like these give turned 
out to be exactly true. Because it was given by a person who was subject to 
many  criticisms  and  objections  and  could  have  lost  his  cause  through  the 
tiniest mistake; it was spoken unhesitatingly, and with absolute seriousness 
and  conﬁdence  in  a  way  that  conﬁrmed  its  authenticity.  This  news  of  the 
Unseen, therefore, demonstrates with certainty that the person who gave it 
had received instruction from the Pre-Eternal Master, and then he spoke.

The Third Glisten

T h e   T h i r d   G l i s t e n  is its giving news of the divine truths, cosmic truths, 
and  the  matters  of  the  hereafter.  The  Qur’an’s  expositions  of  the  divine 
truths  and  its  explanations  of  the  cosmos  which  solve  the  talisman  of  the 
universe  and  riddle  of  creation,  are  the  most  important  of  its  disclosures 
about the Unseen. For it is not reasonable to expect the human reason to dis-
cover those truths about the Unseen and follow them without deviating amid 
innumerable ways of misguidance. It is well-known that the most brilliant 
philosophers of mankind have been unable to solve the most insigniﬁcant of 
those matters by use of the reason. Furthermore, it is only after the Qur’an 
has elucidated those divine truths and cosmic truths, which it points out, and 
after man’s heart has been cleansed and his soul puriﬁed, and after his spirit 
has advanced and his mind been perfected that his mind afﬁrms and accepts 
those truths, and he says to the Qur’an: “ How great are Allah’s blessings! ” 
This section has been in part explained and proved in the Eleventh Word, 
so there is no need to repeat it. But when it comes to facts concerning the 
hereafter and Intermediate Realm, the human mind certainly cannot rise to 
them and see them on its own, but it can prove them to the degree it sees 
them through the ways shown by the Qur’an. It is  explained and proved in 
the Tenth Word just how right and true are these disclosures of the Qur’an 
about the Unseen.

Second Radiance

SECOND RADIANCE: This is the Qur’an’s youth. It preserves its fresh-
ness and youth every age as though newly revealed. In fact, the Qur’an has 
to have perpetual youth since as a pre-eternal address, it addresses at once 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – THIRD RAY

459

all the levels of humankind in every age. And that is how it has been seen 
and is seen. Even, although all the centuries are different with regard to ideas 
and capacity, it as though looks to each particularly, and teaches it. Human 
works and laws grow old like man, they change and are changed. But the rul-
ings and laws of the Qur’an are so ﬁrm and well-founded that they increase 
in  strength  as  the  centuries  pass.  Indeed,  this  present  age  and  the  People 
of the Book this age, who have more than any other relied on themselves 
and stopped up their ears to the words of the Qur’an, are in such need of its 
guiding address of,  < ; , < ; that it is as if it addresses 
this age directly, and the phrase < ; comprises also the meaning of 
ِبَ(cid:99)ﯰﯧ َ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)ا  َلْ(cid:182)َا اَ(cid:192) 1 It delivers its shout of,

( 3:64 ) ..B A @ ? > = < ; : 
to the ends of the world with all its strength, all its freshness, all its youth.

For  example,  as  the  product  of  the  thought  of  all  humankind  and  per-
haps the jinn as well, modern civilization has taken up a position opposed to 
the Qur’an, although individuals and communities have failed to dispute it. 
With its sorcery it impugns the Qur’an’s miraculousness. Now, in order to 
prove the claim of the verse:

( 17:88 ) .. 0 / . - ,
we shall compare the foundations and principles which civilization has laid 
in the form of dispute, with the principles of the Qur’an.

A t   t h e   F i r s t   D e g r e e :  The comparisons and balances which form all the 
Words from the First to the Twenty-Fifth, and the verses at their heads which 
form their truths, all prove with the certainty that two plus two equals four 
the Qur’an’s miraculousness and superiority in the face of civilization.

A t   t h e   S e c o n d   D e g r e e :  Like the proofs in the Twelfth Word, this sum-
marizes  a  number  of  principles.  By  reason  of  its  philosophy,  present-day  
civilization  accepts  force  as  the  point  of  support  in  the  life  of  society.  It 
takes  as  its  aim  beneﬁts,  and  considers  the  principle  of  its  life  to  be  con-
ﬂict. It considers the bond between communities to be racialism and neg-
ative  nationalism.  While  its  aim  is  to  provide  amusements  for  gratifying 
the appetites of the soul and increasing man’s needs. However, the mark of 
force is aggression. And since the beneﬁts are insufﬁcient to meet all needs, 

1.  E h l - i   M e k t e b , those educated in modern secular schools, as opposed to E h l - i   K i t a b . 

( Tr. )

460

THE WORDS

their mark is that everyone tussles and jostles over them. The mark of con-
ﬂict is contention, and the mark of racialism, aggression, since it thrives 
on devouring others. Thus, it is because of these principles of civilization 
that despite all its virtues, it has provided a sort of superﬁcial happiness for 
only twenty per cent of humankind and cast eighty per cent into distress 
and poverty.

The wisdom of the Qur’an, however, takes as its point of support truth 
instead of force, and in place of beneﬁt has virtue and Allah’s pleasure as 
its aims. It considers the principle of mutual assistance to be fundamental 
in life, rather than conﬂict. In the ties between communities it accepts the 
bonds  of  religion,  class,  and  country,  in  place  of  racialism  and  national-
ism.  Its  aims  are  to  place  a  barrier  before  the  illicit  assaults  of  the  soul’s 
base  appetites  and  to  urge  the  spirit  to  sublime  matters,  to  satisfy  man’s 
elevated emotions and encourage him towards the human perfections. As for 
the truth, its mark is concord, the mark of virtue is mutual support, and the 
mark of mutual assistance, hastening to help one another. The mark of reli-
gion is brotherhood and attraction. And the result of reining in and tethering 
the evil-commanding soul and leaving the spirit free and urging it towards 
perfection is happiness in this world and the next. Thus, despite the virtues 
present-day  civilization  has  acquired  from  the  guidance  of  the  Qur’an  in 
particular and from the earlier revealed religions, in point of fact it has thus 
suffered defeat before the Qur’an.

T h i r d   D e g r e e :  Of thousands of matters, we shall point out only three or 
four by way of example. Since the Qur’an’s principles and laws have come 
from pre-eternity, they shall go to post-eternity. They are not condemned to 
grow old and die like civilization’s laws. They are always young and strong. 
For example, despite all its societies for good works, all its establishments 
for the teaching of ethics, all its severe discipline and regulations, civiliza-
tion has been unable to contest the All-Wise Qur’an on two of its matters, 
and has been defeated by them. These two matters are:

and,

We shall describe them, this miraculous victory, by means of an intro-

duction. It is like this:

tions among humankind, so another is the origin of all immorality.

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – THIRD RAY

461

F i r s t   P h r a s e :  “ So long as I’m full, what is it to me if others die of hun-

ger. ”

S e c o n d   P h r a s e :  “ You work so that I can eat. ”
Yes, the upper and lower classes in human society, that is, the rich and 
the poor, live at peace when in equilibrium. The basis of that equilibrium is 
compassion and kindness in the upper classes, and respect and obedience in 
the lower classes. Now, the ﬁrst phrase has incited the upper classes to prac-
tise oppression, immorality, and mercilessness. And just as the second has 
driven the lower classes to hatred, envy, and to contend the upper classes, 
and has negated man’s tranquillity for several centuries, so too this century, 
as the result of the struggle between capital and labour, it has been the cause 
of the momentous events in Europe, well-known by all. Thus, together with 
all its societies for good works, all its establishments for the teaching of eth-
ics, all its severe discipline and regulations, it could not reconcile these two 
classes of mankind, nor could it heal the two fearsome wounds in human 
life. The Qur’an, however, eradicates the ﬁrst phrase with its injunction to 
pay z a k a t , and heals it. While it uproots the second phrase with its prohibi-
tion on usury and interest, and cures that. Indeed, the Qur’anic verse stands 
at the door of the world and declares usury and interest to be forbidden. It 
reads out its decree to mankind, saying: “ If the door of strife is to be closed, 
close ﬁrst the door of usury and interest! ” It forbids its students to enter it.

Second Principle: Civilization does not accept polygamy. It considers 
the Qur’an’s decree to be contrary to wisdom and opposed to man’s beneﬁts. 
Indeed, if the purpose of marriage was only to satisfy lust, polygamy would 
have been contrary to it. But as is testiﬁed to by the animals and corrobo-
rated by plants that ‘marry’, the purpose and aim of marriage is reproduc-
tion. The pleasure of satisfying lust is a small wage given by divine mercy to 
encourage performace of the duty. Since in truth and according to wisdom, 
marriage is for reproduction and the perpetuation of the species, and since 
women can give birth only once a year, and can be impregnated only half the 
month, and after the age of ﬁfty fall into despair, and men can impregnate 
till a hundred years old and one woman is therefore insufﬁcient for one man, 
civilization has been compelled to accept numerous houses of ill-repute.

Third Principle: Unreasoning civilization criticizes the Qur’anic verse  
which  apportions  to  women  one  third  in  inheritance.  However,  most  of 
the rulings concerning social life are in accordance with the majority, and 
mostly a women ﬁnds someone to protect her. As for the man, she will be a 
burden on him and will have to combine efforts with someone else who will 

462

THE WORDS

leave her her means of subsistence. Thus, in this form, if a woman takes half 
of the father’s legacy, her husband makes up her deﬁciency. But if the man 
receives two parts from his father, one part he will give to maintaining the 
woman he has married, thus becoming equal with his sister. The justice of 
the Qur’an requires it to be thus. It has decreed it in this way. 1

Fourth Principle: Just as the Qur’an severely prohibits the worship of 
idols, so it forbids the worship of images, which is a sort of imitation of idol-
worship. Whereas civilization counts the representation of forms as one of 
its virtues and has attempted to dispute the Qur’an in this matter. But repre-
sented forms, whether pictorial or concrete, are either embodied tyranny, or 
embodied hypocrisy, or embodied lust; they excite lust and encourage man 
in oppression, hypocrisy, and licentiousness. Moreover, the Qur’an compas-
sionately commands women to wear the veil of modesty so that they will 
be treated with respect and those mines of compassion will not be trodden 
under the feet of low desires, nor be like worthless goods for the excitement 
of lust. 2 Civilization, however, has drawn women out of their homes, rent 
their  veils,  and  corrupted  mankind.  For  family  life  continues  through  the 
mutual love and respect of man and wife. But immodest dress has destroyed 
sincere respect and affection and has poisoned family life. While worship 
of the human form in particular has shaken morality in appalling fashion, 
causing the abasement of the human spirit. This may be understood from 
the following: to look lustfully and desirously at the corpse of a beautiful 
woman who is in need of pity and compassion destroys morality; so too, to 
look lasciviously at the representations of dead women, or of living women 
for they resemble little corpses, shakes the elevated human emotions to their 
very roots, and destroys them.

Thus, together with assisting human happiness in this world, thousands 
of  matters  of  the  Qur’an  like  the  above  three  examples  also  serve  eternal 
happiness. You can compare other matters to these.

1.  This is part of my court defence, which was the supplement for the Appeal Court 
and which silenced the court. It is appropriate as a footnote for this passage. I told the 
court of law: Surely if there is any justice on the face of the earth, it will reject and quash 
an unjust decision which has convicted someone for expounding a most sacred, just divine 
rule which governs in the social life of three hundred and ﬁfty million people in the year 
one thousand three hundred and ﬁfty, and in every century, relying on the conﬁrmation and 
consensus of three hundred and ﬁfty thousand Qur’anic commentaries, and following the 
beliefs of our forefathers of one thousand three hundred and ﬁfty years.

2.    The  Twenty-Fourth  Flash  of  the  Thirty-First  Letter  about  the  veiling  of  women 
has proved decisively that Islamic dress is natural for women, and that to cast it aside is 
contrary to women’s nature.

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – THIRD RAY

463

Just as present-day civilization stands defeated before the Qur’anic prin-
ciples  concerning  human  social  life  and  in  reality  is  bankrupt  in  the  face 
of the Qur’an’s miraculousness, so too it has been proved decisively in the 
previous  twenty-ﬁve  Words  through  the  comparisons  between  European 
philosophy and human science – which are the spirit of civilization – and 
the wisdom of the Qur’an that philosophy is impotent and the wisdom of 
the Qur’an miraculous. The impotence and bankruptcy of philosophy and 
miraculousness  and  wealth  of  Qur’anic  wisdom  have  been  proved  in  the 
Eleventh and Twelfth Words; you may refer to those.

Furthermore, just as present-day civilization is defeated before the mirac-
ulousness  of  the  Qur’an’s  wisdom  in  regard  to  learning  and  actions,  the 
same is true for literature and rhetoric. The comparison of the literature and 
rhetoric of civilization and those of the Qur’an is that of the dark grief and 
hopeless wailing of a motherless orphan and the low, uproarious song of a 
drunkard, and the yearning, hopeful sorrow of an elevated lover arising from 
a temporary separation and patriotic songs urging victory or war and high 
self-sacriﬁce. For in regard to the effects of its styles, literature and rhetoric 
produce either sorrow or joy. And sadness is of two sorts. It is either a dark 
sorrow arising from the lack of friends, that is, having no friends or owner, 
which is the sorrow produced by the literature of civilization, stained as it 
is by misguidance and is enamoured of nature and tainted by heedlessness, 
or it is the second sorrow. This arises from the separation of friends, that 
is, the friends exist, but their absence causes a yearning sorrow. This is the 
guidance-giving,  light-scattering  sorrow  which  the  Qur’an  produces.  Joy, 
too, is of two sorts. One stimulates the desires of the soul. This is the mark 
of  civilization’s  literature  in  the  ﬁelds  of  theatre,  cinema,  and  the  novel. 
While the other joy silences the soul, and is subtle and mannerly, innocently 
urging the spirit, heart, mind, and subtle faculties to attain to sublime mat-
ters, to their original home and eternal abode, and their companions of the 
hereafter; it is the joy the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition produces. It ﬁlls 
man  with  eagerness  for  Paradise  and  eternal  happiness  and  the  vision  of 
Allah’s beauty. 

Thus, the vast meaning and mighty truth expressed by the verse,

 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 / . - , 
( 17:88 ) > = < ; :
is imagined by those of scant intelligence to be an impossible supposition 
for the purposes of uttering an exaggerated piece of eloquence. Allah forbid! 

464

THE WORDS

It is not an exaggeration, nor is it an impossible supposition; it is an abso-
lutely truthful piece of rhetoric, and possible and actual.

One aspect of its being in this form is this: if all the ﬁne words of men 
and jinn which do not issue from the Qur’an and do not belong to it were 
to be gathered together, they could not imitate the Qur’an. And they have 
not  been  able  to  imitate  it,  for  they  have  been  unable  to  show  that  they 
have. The second aspect is this: civilization, and science and philosophy 
and European literature, which are the products of the thought and efforts 
of mankind and the jinn and even satans, remain in the very pits of impo-
tence before the decrees, wisdom, and eloquence of the Qur’an. Just as we 
showed in the examples.

Third Radiance

THIRD RADIANCE: It is as though the All-Wise Qur’an is every cen-
tury turned directly towards all the classes of humanity, and addresses each 
particularly. Indeed, since the Qur’an summons all humankind together with 
all its classes and instructs them in belief, the highest and most subtle sci-
ence, and in knowledge of Allah, the broadest and most luminous branch 
of  learning,  and  in  the  laws  of  Islam,  which  are  the  most  important  and 
various of the sciences, it is essential that it should instruct every class and 
group appropriately. What it teaches, however, is the same; it does not dif-
fer. In which case, there have to be different levels in the same lesson so 
that according to its degree, every class may receive its share from one of 
the veils of the Qur’an. We have given many examples of this and they may 
be referred to. Here we shall indicate only one or two minor points and the 
share of understanding of one or two classes. For example:

( 112:3-4 ) 2 1 0 / . * , + * ) 
The share in understanding this of the ordinary people, who form the most 
numerous class: “ Almighty Allah is above having mother and father, rela-
tives or wife. ” While the share of a middle class: “ It is to deny the divinity 
of Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ), of the angels, and of anything that has been 
born. ” For although denying something impossible is apparently purpose-
less,  according  to  the  rules  of  rhetoric,  a  necessary  statement  is  intended 
and  this  gives  it  purpose.  Thus,  the  purpose  of  denying  son  and  begetter, 
which are particular to corporality, is to deny the divinity of those who have 
offspring and parents and equals, and to show that they are not worthy of 
being worshipped. It is because of this that Sura al-Ikhlas is beneﬁcial for 
everyone all the time. The share of a more advanced class:  “ Almighty Allah 
is above all relations which infer giving birth and being born. He is exempt 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST LIGHT – THIRD RAY

465

from having any partners, helpers, or fellows. His relations with all beings 
are those of Creator. He creates through His pre-eternal will with the com-
mand of ( 36:82 ) ² ±  He is far beyond having any relation which is con-
trary to perfection, or is compelling, necessitating, or involuntary. ” And the 
share in understanding of a higher class still: “ Almighty Allah is pre-eternal 
and post-eternal, He is the First and the Last. Neither in His essence, nor in 
His attributes, nor in His actions, has He in any way any equal, peer, like, or 
match, or anything similar, resembling, or analogous to Him. Only, in His 
acts, there may be comparisons expressing similarity: 

( 16:60 )  j  i  h
You can draw analogies with the above for other classes, which all receive 
different shares, such as those who have attained knowledge of Allah, the 
lovers of Allah, and the truly sincere.

A Second Example:

( 33:40 ) À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ » º ¹ 
The  share  in  understanding  this  of  the  ﬁrst  class:  “ Zayd,  the  servant  of 
Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), whom he 
also addressed as ‘my son,’ divorced his stately wife because he did not ﬁnd 
himself equal to her. On Allah’s command, the Messenger ( UWBP ) took 
her. The verse says: ‘If the Prophet calls you son, it is in respect of his mes-
sengership. In regard to his person, he is not your father, so that the women 
he takes should be unsuitable for him.’ ” 

The second class’s share is this: “ A great ruler looks on his subjects with 
paternal compassion. If he is a spiritual monarch ruling both outwardly and 
inwardly, then since his compassion goes a hundred times beyond that of 
a father, his subjects look on him as a father and on themselves as his real 
sons. A father’s view cannot be transformed into that of a husband, and a 
daughter’s  view  cannot  be  easily  transformed  into  the  view  of  a  wife,  so 
since the Prophet’s taking the believers’ daughters would seem inappropri-
ate, the Qur’an says: ‘The Prophet ( UWBP ) acts kindly towards you with 
the eye of divine compassion and treats you in a fatherly manner. In respect 
of his messengership, you are like his children, but with regard to his human 
person, he is not your father so that his taking a wife from among you should 
be unﬁtting.’ ”

The third group would understand it like this: “ You should not claim a 
connection with the Prophet ( UWBP ), and relying on his perfections and 

466

THE WORDS

trusting in his fatherly compassion, commit errors and faults. ” Yes, many  
people  are  lazy  because  they  lean  on  their  elders  and  guides.  They  even 
sometimes say: “ Our prayers have been performed. ” ( Like some ‘Alawis )
The  Fourth  Point.  Another  group  would  understand  a  sign  from  the 
Unseen from this verse, as follows: The Prophet’s male children would not 
remain at the degree of ‘men’ [ r i j ā l  ]; in consequence of some wise purpose, 
his descendants would not continue as mere men. Since through the use of 
the term ‘r i j ā l ’ it indicates that he is the father of women, his line would 
continue through women. Praise be to Allah, Fatima’s blessed descendants, 
Hasan and Husayn, the radiant moons of two luminous lines, continued the 
physical and spiritual line of the Sun of Prophethood.

SECOND LIGHT

First Beam

The Second Light comprises three Beams.
• FIRST BEAM: According to the testimony of thousands of brilliant 
scholars of the rhetorical sciences of ﬁgurative speech ( i l m - i   b e y â n  ) and 
the semantics of syntax ( f e n n - i   m a ‘ â n î  ) like Zamakhshari, Sakkaki, and 
‘Abd al-Qahir Jurjani, there is in the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition as a 
whole a pleasant ﬂuency, a superior correctness, a ﬁrm mutual solidarity, 
and  compact  proportionateness,  powerful  co-operation  between  the  sen-
tences  and  parts,  and  an  elevated  harmony  between  the  verses  and  their 
aims. Yet, while there are eight or nine signiﬁcant factors that might mar 
or  destroy  the  harmony,  co-operation,  and  mutual  support,  and  the  ﬂu-
ency and correctness, they do not mar them, indeed, they give strength to 
the ﬂuency, correctness, and proportionateness. Only, those causes have 
exerted an inﬂuence to some extent and taken others out of the veil of the 
order and ﬂuency. But just as a number of bumps and excrescences appear 
on a tree, not to spoil the harmony of the tree but to produce fruit which 
will be the means for the tree reaching its adorned perfection and beauty; 
in just the same way, these factors stick out their knobbly heads in order 
to express meanings which will enhance the Qur’an’s ﬂuent ordering and 
composition.  Thus,  although  the  Perspicuous  Qur’an  was  revealed  part 
by part like stars over twenty years in response to the circumstances and 
needs, it possesses such a perfect harmony and displays such a proportion-
ateness that it is as though it was revealed all at once.

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – SECOND LIGHT – SECOND BEAM

467

Furthermore, although the circumstances which prompted the Qur’an’s 
revelation were all different and various, its parts are so mutually supportive 
that  it  is  as  though  it  was  revealed  in  response  to  only  one  of  them.  And 
although the Qur’an came in response to different and repeated questions, it 
displays the utmost blending and unity, as though it is the answer to a sin-
gle question. And although the Qur’an came to explain the requirements of 
numerous diverse events, it displays such a perfect order that it is as though 
it explains a single event. And although the Qur’an was revealed through 
divine condescension in styles appropriate to the understanding of the innu-
merable people it would address, whose circumstances were different and 
diverse,  it  displays  such  a  ﬁne  correspondence  and  beautiful  smoothness 
of  style  that  it  is  as  though  the  circumstances  were  one  and  the  level  of 
understanding  the  same;  it  ﬂows  as  smoothly  as  water.  And  although  the 
Qur’an  addresses  numerous  classes  distant  from  one  another,  it  possesses 
such an ease of exposition, such an eloquence in its composition, such a clar-
ity in its manner of expression it is as though it is addressing a single class. 
Even, each class supposes that it alone is being addressed. And although the 
Qur’an was revealed in order to guide and lead to various aims, it possesses 
such an perfect integrity, such a careful balance, such a ﬁne order it is as 
though it follows only one aim.

Thus, while these are all causes of confusion, they have been employed 
in the Qur’an’s miraculous manner of exposition, in its ﬂuency and propor-
tionateness. For sure, everyone whose heart is free of disease, whose mind 
is sound, whose conscience is not sick, whose taste is unimpaired sees in the 
Qur’an’s manner of exposition a beautiful smoothness of style, a graceful 
harmony, a pleasing proportionateness, a unique eloquence. All the clear-
sighted see that the Qur’an possesses an eye that sees the whole universe 
together with its outer and inner aspects clearly before it as though it were 
a page; that it turns the page as it wishes and tells the page’s meanings as 
it  wishes.  Several  volumes  would  be  necessary  if  we  were  to  explain  the 
meaning  of  this  First  Beam  together  with  examples,  so  sufﬁcing  with  the 
explanations and proofs in my Arabic treatises and in I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z , and in 
the twenty-ﬁve Words up to here, I have pointed out here only these features 
in the Qur’an as a whole.

Second Beam

• SECOND BEAM

This concerns the miraculous qualities in the Qur’an’s unique style in 
the summaries and most beautiful divine names, which it shows at the ends 
of its verses.

468

THE WORDS

Reminder: There are many verses in this Second Beam. These are not 
only examples for this Beam, but for all the preceding examples and 
Rays. It would be extremely lengthy to explain them all giving them 
their due, so for now I am compelled to be brief and succinct. I have 
therefore indicated very concisely all the verses which form examples 
of this mighty mystery of miraculousness, and have postponed detailed 
explanation of them to another time.
Thus, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition mostly mentions summa-
ries at the conclusion of its verses which either contain the divine names 
or  their  meanings;  or  refer  the  verse  to  the  reason  in  order  to  urge  it 
ponder over it; or they comprise a universal rule from among the aims 
of the Qur’an in order to corroborate and strengthen the verse. Thus, 
the  summaries  contain  certain  indications  from  the  Qur’an’s  exalted 
wisdom and certain droplets from the water of life of divine guidance, 
and certain sparks from the lightning of the Qur’an’s miraculousness. 
Now I shall mention brieﬂy only ten of those numerous indications and 
point out a concise meaning of only one of numerous truths, which all 
form one example out of many. Most of these ten indications are found 
together in compact form in most verses and form a true embroidery of 
miraculousness. Furthermore, most of the verses we give as examples 
are examples of most of the indications. We shall point out only one 
indication for each verse, and shall just point lightly to the meanings of 
those verses given as examples in the preceding Words.

First Quality of Eloquence

FIRST QUALITY OF ELOQUENCE: With its miraculous exposition, 
the Wise Qur’an lays out, spreads out before the eyes, the acts and works of 
the All-Glorious Maker. Then it extracts the divine names from those works 
and acts, or it proves the Qur’an’s basic aims, such as the resurrection of the 
dead and divine unity. An example of the ﬁrst meaning is this:

 É È Ç Æ Å Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾ 
( 2:29 ) Ñ Ð Ï Î Í Ì Ë Ê

And an example of the second part:

.... = <  *   : 9   *   7 6 5 4

until,  

  ( 78:6-17 ) f e d c b

In the ﬁrst verse it describes the divine works and sets out the mightiest 
of them, which testify through their order and aims to knowledge and power, 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – SECOND LIGHT – SECOND BEAM

469

like the premises of a conclusion, or a momentous aim. Then it extracts the 
name  of  All-Knowing.  In  the  second  verse,  as  is  explained  brieﬂy  in  the 
Third Point of the First Ray in the First Light, it mentions Almighty Allah’s 
mighty acts and works, then concludes the resurrection of the dead, which is 
the Day of Sorting Out.

Second Point of Eloquence

SECOND POINT OF ELOQUENCE: The Qur’an unrolls the woven 
fabrics of divine art and displays them to the human gaze. Then, in the sum-
maries  it  passes  over  the  weaving  within  the  divine  names,  or  else  refers 
them to the reason.

The ﬁrst example of these:

 º ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´ ³ ² ± ° ¯ ® ¬ « ª
 *È Ç Æ Å Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ »
( 10:31-32 ) Í Ì Ë Ê
Thus, at the start it asks: “ Who is it that readies the skies and the earth as 
though they were two storehouses for your sustenance, and causes one to 
produce  rain  and  the  other,  seeds?  Is  there  anyone  other  than  Allah  Who 
could  make  them  two  subservient  storekeepers?  In  which  case,  thanks 
should be offered to Him alone. ”

In the second phrase, it asks: “ Who is the owner of your eyes and ears, 
the  most  precious  of  your  members?  From  which  workbench  or  shop  did 
you obtain them? It is only your Sustainer that could give you them. It is He 
Who creates and raises you, and gave you them. In which case, there is no 
Sustainer but He, and the only one ﬁt to be worshipped is He. ”

In the third phrase, it says: “ Who is it that resurrects the dead earth and 
raises  to  life  hundreds  of  thousands  of  sorts  of  dead  beings?  Who  could 
bring this about apart from the True God and Creator of all the universe? It 
is surely He Who brings it about, He raises them to life. Since He is Truth, 
He will not violate rights; He will send you to a Supreme Tribunal. He will 
raise you to life just as He raises to life the earth. ”

In the fourth phrase, it asks: “ Who other than Allah can administer and 
regulate this vast universe with perfect order as though it were a palace or 
a city? Since it can be none other than Allah, the power which administers 
with extreme ease the vast universe and all its heavenly bodies is so faultless 
and inﬁnite it can have no need of partner or associate, assistance or help. 

470

THE WORDS

The One Who directs the vast universe will not leave small creatures to other 
hands. That means you will be obliged to say: ‘Allah.’ ”

Thus, the ﬁrst and fourth phrases say “ Allah, ” the second, “ Sustainer, ” 
and the third, “ Truth. ” So understand how miraculously apt are the words: 
Í Ì Ë Ê It mentions Almighty Allah’s vast disposals, the mean-
ingful  weavings  of  His  power.  Then  by  mentioning  the  names  “ Allah, ” 
“ Sustainer, ”  and  “ Truth, ”  it  shows  the  source  of  those  vast  disposals  of 
divine power.

An example of the second:

 + * ) ( ' & % $ # " !
 : 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 / . - ,
 E D C B A @ ? > = < ;
( 2:164  ) K J I H G F
First this enumerates the manifestations of divine sovereignty in the crea-
tion of the heavens and the earth, which demonstrates Almighty Allah’s 
perfect  power  and  the  vastness  of  His  dominicality,  and  testiﬁes  to  His 
unity; and the manifestation of dominicality in the alternation of night and 
day, and the manifestation of divine mercy in the subjugation of the ships 
in  the  sea,  the  most  important  means  of  transport  in  human  social  life; 
and the manifestation of the immensity of divine power, which sends the 
water of life to the dead earth from the skies and raises to life hundreds 
of  thousands  of  species  and  makes  it  an  exhibition  of  wonders;  and  the 
manifestation of mercy and power in the creation of inﬁnite numbers of 
different animals on the earth from simple soil; and the manifestation of 
wisdom  and  mercy  in  the  employment  of  the  winds  in  important  duties 
such as assisting in the pollination and respiration of plants and animals 
and in the impelling and regulating of them so as to make them suitable to 
perform those duties; and the manifestation of dominicality in the subjuga-
tion and gathering together of the clouds, the means of mercy, suspended 
between  the  skies  and  the  earth  in  great  strange  masses,  and  dispersing 
them,  as  though  dispersing  an  army  for  rest  and  then  summoning  them 
back to their duties. Then, in order to urge the mind to ponder over their 
details  and  essential  truths,  it  says: K J I    In  order  to  arouse 
people’s minds with it, it refers it to their faculties of reason.

Third Quality of Eloquence

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – SECOND LIGHT – SECOND BEAM

471

THIRD QUALITY OF ELOQUENCE: Sometimes the Qur’an explains 
Almighty Allah’s acts in detail, then sums them up with a summary. It con-
vinces  with  the  details  and  commits  it  to  the  memory  and  ﬁxes  it  there  by 
summarizing it. For example:

 = < ; : 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 
( 12:6 ) K J I H G F E D C B A @ ? >
With this verse, it points out the bounties bestowed on the Prophet Joseph 
( UWP ) and his forefathers. It says: “ Out of all mankind divine favour has  
ennobled you with the rank of prophethood, and tied all the lines of prophet-
hood to your line and made it the chief of all lineages among humankind. 
It  has  made  your  family  a  cell  of  instruction  and  guidance  in  the  divine 
sciences and dominical wisdom, and united in you through that knowledge 
and wisdom, prosperous worldly dominion and the eternal happiness of the 
hereafter.  And  it  has  made  you  both  a  mighty  ruler  of  Egypt,  and  a  high 
prophet, and a wise guide, and has distinguished you and your forefathers 
with knowledge and wisdom. ” It enumerates these divine bounties, then it 
says: “ I n d e e d ,   y o u r   S u s t a i n e r   i s   A l l - K n o w i n g ,   A l l - Wi s e . ” “ His dominical-
ity and wisdom require that He made manifest in you and your fathers and 
forefathers the divine names of All-Knowing and All-Wise. ” Thus, it sums 
up those detailed bounties with this summary.

And, for example:

 ( 3:26 ) ^ ] \ [ Z Y X W 
This verse shows Almighty Allah’s disposals in humankind’s social life in 
such a way that it ties glory and abasement, poverty and riches directly to 
Almighty  Allah’s  will  and  wish.  It  means,  “ Even  the  disposals  most  dis-
persed through the levels of multiplicity occur through divine will and deter-
mining. Chance and coincidence cannot interfere. ” After making this state-
ment, it mentions the most important matter in human life, sustenance. This 
verse  proves  with  one  or  two  introductory  phrases  that  man’s  sustenance 
is sent directly from the True Provider’s treasury of mercy. It is like this: 
“ Your sustenance is tied to the earth’s life, and the earth’s being raised to 
life looks to the spring, and the spring is in the hands of the One Who sub-
jugates the sun and the moon, and alternates the night and the day. In which 
case, only the One Who ﬁlls the face of the earth with all the fruits can give 
an apple to someone as true sustenance. Only He can be his true Provider. ” 
Then it says:

It summarizes and proves those detailed acts in this sentence. That is, “ The 
One Who gives you unlimited sustenance is He Who performs these acts. ”

Fourth Point of Eloquence

FOURTH POINT OF ELOQUENCE: It sometimes happens that the 
Qur’an mentions the divine creatures with a particular arrangement of the 
sentence, then by showing that the creatures are within an order and balance 
and that they are its fruits, affords a sort of transparency and brilliance. The 
transparency and brilliance then show the divine names, the manifestation 
of which obtains through that mirror-like arrangement. It is as though the 
above-mentioned creatures are words, and the names are their meanings, or 
the seeds of the fruits, or their essences. For example:

 * r q p o n m *  k j i h g f e
 } | { z y x w v u t
( 23:12-14 ) ª © ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ £ ¢ ¡ ﮯ ~
Thus, the Qur’an mentions in order those wonderful, strange, amazing, well-
ordered and balanced stages of man’s creation in such a mirror-like fashion 
that the phrase,

ª © ¨ §
appears of itself from within them and makes itself exclaimed. A scribe who 
was  writing  out  this  verse  uttered  the  words  before  coming  to  them,  and 
wondered to himself: “ Has revelation come to me as well? ” Whereas it was 
the perfection of the order and transparency of the preceding words and their 
coherence that had showed up the ﬁnal words before coming to them.

And for example:

 b a ` _ ^ ] \ [ Z Y X W V U 

 m l k j i h g f e d c
( 7:54 ) v u t s r q p o n
In this verse, the Qur’an points out the sublimity of divine power and the 
sovereignty of dominicality. It shows an All-Powerful One of Glory estab-
lished on the throne of His dominicality, Who, with the sun, moon and stars 
like soldiers under orders awaiting his command, rotates the night and day 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – SECOND LIGHT – SECOND BEAM

one after the other like two lines or two ribbons, one white and one black, 
and writes the signs of His dominicality on the pages of the universe. This 
he does in such a way that when a spirit hears the verse, it feels the desire to 
exclaim:  َن(cid:193) ِ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:170)اَ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)ا  ُ
ّ(cid:195)ا َءاَ(cid:130) اَ(cid:174) ، ُ

life, of what has preceded it.

Fifth Quality of Eloquence

FIFTH QUALITY OF ELOQUENCE: The Qur’an sometimes men-
tions material, particular matters which are subject to change and are the 
cause of various circumstances, then in order to transform them into the 
form  of  constant  truths,  summarizes  them  with  constant,  luminous,  uni-
versal  divine  names,  and  ties  them  up.  Or  it  concludes  with  a  summary 
which  encourages  thought  and  the  taking  of  lessons.  An  example  of  the 
ﬁrst meaning:

 J I H G F E D C B A @
 X W V U T S R Q P * N M L K
( 2:31-32 ) \ [ Z Y
First of all this verse mentions a particular matter, which is, “ In the question 
of Adam’s vicegerency, knowledge gave him superiority over the angels. ” 
Then within this event it mentions the angels’ defeat before Adam in respect 
of  knowledge.  Then  it  summarizes  these  two  events  with  two  universal 
names: \ [ Z That is: since You are All-Knowing and Wise, You 
instructed Adam and he prevailed over us. And since You are All-Wise, You 
treated us according to our abilities and gave him preference in accordance 
with his abilities.

An example of the second meaning:

until,

milk for man, and makes artefacts like grapes and dates into cauldrons and 
trays laden with deliciously sweet bounties for him, and tiny miracles of His 
power like the honey-bee into makers of a sweet, health-giving sherbet, and 
then conclude with the words, ~ } | { z y thus urging man 
to think and take lessons and compare these with other things.

Sixth Quality of Eloquence

SIXTH  QUALITY  OF  ELOQUENCE:  It  sometimes  happens  that  a 
verse spreads out dominical decrees over a great multiplicity of things, then 
it uniﬁes them with a tie of unity resembling an aspect of unity, or it situates 
them within a universal rule. For example:

( 2:255 ) Ï Î Í Ì Ë Ê É È Ç Æ Å Ä  
Thus, together with proving with ten phrases in Ay a t   a l - K u r s i  ten levels of 
divine unity in varying hues, with the phrase,

± ° ¯ ® ¬ « ª 
it rejects utterly and vehemently the associating of partners with Allah and 
interference of others, and casts them away. Also, since this verse manifests 
the greatest name, its meanings related to the divine truths are at a maximum 
degree, so that it demonstrates the dominical acts of disposal at a maximum 
level. Furthermore, after mentioning the divine regulation of all the heavens 
and the earth and a preservation encompassing all things at the maximum 
degree,  a  tie  of  unity  and  aspect  of  unity  summarize  the  sources  of  those 
maximum manifestations with the phrase, Ï Î Í

And, for example:

 ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´ ³ ² ± ° ¯ ® ¬ «
 *Ç Æ Å Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ » º
 " ! * Ò Ñ Ð Ï Î Í Ì Ë Ê É
( 14:32-34 ) , + * ) ( ' & % $ #
These  verses  describe  how  Almighty  Allah  created  the  huge  universe  as 
a palace for man, and sending the water of life from the skies to the earth, 
made the skies and the earth two servants producing food for him. Similarly, 
He made ships subject to men so that they might beneﬁt from the fruits of the 
earth found in every part of it, and also exchange the fruits of their labours 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – SECOND LIGHT – SECOND BEAM

475

and secure their livelihoods in every respect. That is, He made the winds as 
whips, ships as horses, and the seas as a desert beneath their hooves. And 
besides connecting man with every region of the earth by means of ships, 
He  subjugated  the  rivers,  great  and  small,  to  him  by  making  them  means 
of  transport.  And  causing  the  sun  and  moon  to  travel,  the  True  Bestower 
of  Bounties  alternates  the  seasons  and  makes  them  two  obedient  servants 
whereby He offers man His multicoloured bounties which change with the 
seasons; He created them also as two steersmen turning that mighty wheel. 
And He made the night and day subject to man; that is, He made the night 
as a veil for his sleep and repose, and the day a place of trade for winning 
his livelihood. 

After enumerating these divine bounties, with the summary:

, + * ) ( ' &% $ # " !
it  points  out  the  vast  extent  of  the  bounties  bestowed  on  man,  and  their  
abounding profusion and abundance. That is, whatever man asks for through 
the tongue of his capacity and innate needs, they have all been given him. An 
end can never be reached in counting the divine bounties bestowed on man 
nor can they be exhausted. Certainly, since the heavens and the earth are a 
table of bounties for man, and things like the sun and the moon and night and 
day some of the bounties on the table, the bounties directed towards man are 
most surely beyond count and calculation.

Seventh Mystery of Eloquence

SEVENTH MYSTERY OF ELOQUENCE: It sometimes happens that 
in order to disallow apparent causes the ability to create and to demonstrate 
how far they are from this, a verse points out the aims and fruits of the effects 
so that it may be understood that causes are only an apparent veil. For to will 
that most wise and purposeful aims are followed, and important results are 
obtained, is of necessity the work of one who is most Knowing and Wise. 
Whereas causes are lifeless and without intelligence. So by mentioning the 
aims and results, such verses show that although causes are superﬁcially and 
as beings joined to and adjacent to their effects, in reality there is a great dis-
tance between them. The distance from the cause to the creation of the effect 
is so great that the hand of the greatest causes cannot reach the creation of 
the most insigniﬁcant effects. Thus, it is within this long distance between 
cause and effect that the divine names each rise like stars. The place of their 
rising is this distance. To the superﬁcial glance mountains on the horizon 
appear to be joined to and contiguous with the skirts of the sky, although 
from the mountains to the sky is a vast distance in which the stars rise and 

476

THE WORDS

other things are situated; so too the distance between causes and effects is 
such that it may be seen only with the light of the Qur’an through the tel-
escope of belief. For example:

 *  μ ´ ³  * ± ° ¯ ® * « ª © ¨  * ¦ ¥ ¤ £
( 80:24-32 ) Æ Å Ä  * Â  Á * ¿ ¾ *  ¼ » *  ¹ ¸
By mentioning miracles of divine power in a purposeful sequence, this verse 
ties causes to effects and with the words, Å Ä points to an aim at its con-
clusion. The aim proves that within the sequence of all the causes and effects 
is a hidden disposer who sees and follows the aim, to whom the causes are 
a veil. Indeed, with the phrase, Æ Å Ä it disallows all the causes 
the  ability  to  create.  It  is  in  effect  saying:  “ Rain  comes  from  the  sky    in 
order to produce food for you and your animals. Since water does not pos-
sess the ability to pity you and produce food, it means that the rain does not 
come, it is sent. And the earth produces plants and your food comes from 
there. But lacking feelings and intelligence, it is far beyond the ability of 
the earth to think of your sustenance and feel compassion for you, so it does 
not produce it itself. Furthermore, since it is remote from plants and trees to 
consider your food and compassionately produce fruits and grains for you, 
the verse demonstrates that they are strings and ropes which One All-Wise 
and Compassionate extends from behind the veil, to which He attaches His 
bounties and holds out to animate creatures. ” Thus, from this explanation 
numerous divine names rise, like All-Compassionate, Provider, Bestower, 
and All-Generous.

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – SECOND LIGHT – SECOND BEAM

477

causing of rainfall, which is one of the most important miracles of domini-
cality and strangest veil of the treasury of mercy. Like soldiers who have 
dispersed to rest gather together at the call of a bugle, clouds gather and form 
at the divine command when their parts have been dispersed and hidden in 
the atmosphere. Then, like an army is formed of small groups, the pieces of 
cloud come together and form masses – which are vast and towering, moist 
and white, and contain snow and hail like the moving mountains at the resur-
rection – from which the water of life is sent to living beings. But in its being 
sent a will and purpose are apparent; it comes in accordance with need. This 
means it is sent. While the skies are clear and empty, the mountainous pieces 
of cloud do not gather together of their own accord into a great gathering of 
wonders, they are sent by One Who knows the living creatures. In this dis-
tance, then, such divine names rise as All-Powerful, All-Knowing, Disposer, 
Designer, Nurturer, Succourer, and Giver of Life.

Eighth Quality of Eloquence

EIGHTH QUALITY OF ELOQUENCE: It sometimes happens that in 
order to impel the heart to accept Almighty Allah’s wondrous works in the 
hereafter and make the mind afﬁrm them, the Qur’an mentions His amaz-
ing works in this world by way of preparation, or it mentions the wondrous 
divine works of the future and hereafter in such a way that we form a ﬁrm 
conviction  about  them  due  to  similar  things  which  we  observe  here.  For 
example:

( 36:77 ) b a ` _ ^ ] \ [ Z Y X  to the end of 
the sura. In this discussion of the resurrection of the dead, the Qur’an proves 
the resurrection in seven or eight different ways. Firstly it draws attention to 
the ﬁrst creation, saying: “ You see your creation from sperm to a blood-clot, 
from a blood-clot to a foetus lump, and from that to the human creation, so 
how is it that you deny the second creation, which is like it or even easier? ”

And with the words:

( 36:80 ) ¤ £ ¢ ¡ ﮯ ~ }
Almighty Allah indicates the mighty favours He bestows on man, saying: 
“ The One Who bestows such bounties on you will not leave you at liberty to 
enter the grave and sleep never to rise again. ” And by allusion it says: “ You 
see  the  dead  trees  come  to  life  and  grow  green,  but  you  draw  no  conclu-
sions from their bones springing to life when like dry ﬁrewood, and so deem 
man’s rising again unlikely. Also, could the One Who creates the heavens 
and the earth remain impotent before the life and death of man, the fruit of 
the heavens and the earth? Would the One Who administers the mighty tree 

478

THE WORDS

attach no importance to its fruit and allow others to claim it? Do you suppose 
that He would abandon the result of all the tree, thus making purposeless and 
vain the tree of creation, which together with all its parts is kneaded with 
wisdom? ” It says: “ The One Who will raise you to life at the resurrection is 
such that the whole universe is like a soldier under His orders. ” It is utterly 
submissive before His command of ( 36:82 ) ² ± It is as easy for Him 
to create the spring as to create a ﬂower. He is One for Whose power it is 
as easy to create all animals as to create a ﬂy. Such a One may not be chal-
lenged with the words: 

( 36:78 ) m l k
and His power belittled. Then, with the phrase:

( 36:83 ) Ì Ë Ê É È Ç 
it says: “ He is an All-Powerful One of Glory in Whose hands are the reins 
of all things, with Him are the keys to all things; He alternates day and night 
and winter and summer as easily as turning the pages of a book, and opens 
and closes this world and the hereafter as though they were two houses. ” 
Since it is thus, the conclusion of all these evidences is:

( 36:83 ) Î Í 
That is, “ He will raise you to life from the grave and bring you to the resur-
rection; there you will be called to account in the presence of the Almighty. ” 
Thus, all these verses have prepared the mind to accept the resurrection, 
and so have they prepared the heart, for they have pointed out similar deeds 
in this world.

It  sometimes  happens  also  that  the  Qur’an  mentions  Almighty  Allah’s 
deeds of the hereafter in such a way that man may understand similar things 
in  this  world.  Then  no  possibility  remains  to  deny  them  or  deem  them 
unlikely. An example are the suras which begin:

( 81:1 ) # " !
( 82:1 ) # " ! 
( 84:1 ) . - , 
In these suras it mentions the mighty revolutions and dominical acts of dis-
posal in the resurrection and Great Gathering in such a way that, since man 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – SECOND LIGHT – SECOND BEAM

479

sees things similar to them in this world, for example, in the autumn and 
spring, he accepts those revolutions easily, which cause dread to the heart 
and cannot be comprehended by the mind. To provide even a summary of 
the meaning of these three suras would be very lengthy, so for now we shall 
point out a single phrase by way of example.

For example, the phrase

( 81:10 ) G F E 
expresses the following: at the resurrection all the deeds of everyone will be 
published written on pages. Being very strange on its own, the mind cannot 
grasp this matter. But as the sura indicates, since in the resurrection of the 
spring things occur that are similar to other points, the things similar to this 
laying open of the pages are quite clear. For all fruit-bearing trees or ﬂower-
ing plants perform deeds, acts, and duties, and in whatever way they display 
the divine names and glorify Allah, they perform worship. All these deeds 
are written in their seeds together with their life histories, then emerge in 
another spring in another place. Just as they mention most eloquently the 
deeds of their mothers and their stock through the tongues of the shapes and 
forms they display, so they publish the pages of their deeds through their 
branches,  leaves,  ﬂowers,  and  fruits.  Thus,  the  One  Who  carries  out  this 
Wise, Preserving, Planned, Nurturing, Benevolent work, is He Who says:

G F E 
You can make analogies with other points from this and deduce them if you 
can. To help you, I shall say the following: the phrase:

( 81:1 ) # " !
is  a  brilliant  metaphor  meaning  ‘rolling  up’  and  ‘gathering  up’;  so  too  it 
alludes to things similar to it.

T h e   F i r s t :   Almighty  Allah  drew  back  the  veils  of  non-existence,  the 
ether, and the skies, and taking from the treasury of His mercy a lamp resem-
bling  a  sparkling  brilliant  to  illuminate  the  world,  He  displayed  it  to  the 
world. When the world is closed, He shall rewrap that brilliant in its veils 
and remove it.

T h e   S e c o n d :  The sun is an ofﬁcial charged with spreading out the wares 
of its light and wrapping the head of the earth alternately in light and dark-
ness. Every evening it gathers up its wares and conceals them, and some-
times it does scant business due to the veil of a cloud, and sometimes the 

480

THE WORDS

moon draws a veil over its face and somewhat hinders its transactions, then 
it adjusts the account books of its wares and transactions. Similarly, a time 
will  come  when  this  ofﬁcial  will  resign  from  its  post.  Even  if  there  is  no 
cause for its dismissal, due to the enlargement of the two black spots on its 
face, as has begun, with divine permission the sun will take back the light 
that it spreads at a dominical command and wrap it around its own head. It 
will be told: “ No work remains for you on Earth. Go to Hell and burn those 
who worshipped you and insulted an obedient ofﬁcial like yourself by infer-
ring you were disloyal! ” It will read out the decree of # " ! through 
its black-spotted face.

Ninth Point of Eloquence

NINTH POINT OF ELOQUENCE: It sometimes happens that the All-
Wise  Qur’an  mentions  certain  particular  aims,  then  in  order  to  impel  the 
mind by means of them, conﬁrms, establishes, veriﬁes, and proves the aims 
through the divine names, which are like universal rules. For example:

  . - , + * ) ( ' & % $ # " !
( 58:1 ) 3 2 1 0
Here the Qur’an is saying: “ Almighty Allah is absolutely All-Hearing; He 
hears everything. Through the divine name of Truth ( Right ), He even hears 
a wife arguing with you and complaining about her husband, a truly insig-
niﬁcant matter. Since women manifest the subtlest manifestations of mercy 
and are mines of self-sacriﬁcing compassion, He hears through the name of  
Most  Compassionate  the  rightful  claim  of  a  woman  and  her  complaint  to 
Him, and through the name of Truth ( Right ) takes it seriously, affording it 
the greatest importance. ” Thus, the Being outside the sphere of contingency 
of the universe Who hears and sees a minor incident among creatures, must 
of necessity hear and see all things, and so makes a particular aim universal. 
And the Being Who is Sustainer of the universe of necessity sees the suffer-
ing of insigniﬁcant creatures within the universe who are wronged and hears 
their cries. One who does not see their suffering and does not hear their cries 
for help cannot be the Sustainer. In which case, it establishes two mighty 
truths with the phrase,  3 2 1 0

And, for example:

 , + * ) ( ' & % $ # " !
( 17:1 ) 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 / . -

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – SECOND LIGHT – SECOND BEAM

481

Here,  after  mentioning  the  Noble  Messenger’s  ( Upon  whom  be  bless-
ings and peace ) journey from the Sacred Mosque in Mecca to the Farthest 
Mosque in Jerusalem, which was the start of his Ascension, the Qur’an says: 
6 5 4 3  The pronoun 3 refers either to Almighty Allah or 
to the Prophet ( UWBP ). If it refers to the Prophet ( UWBP ), it is like this: 
“ There was within this particular journey a general journey and universal 
ascension, during which, as far as “ t h e   F a r t h e s t   L o t e - t r e e   a n d   d i s t a n c e   o f  
t w o   b o w - s t r i n g s , ”  he  heard  and  saw  the  dominical  signs  and  wonders  of 
divine art which were apparent to his eyes and ears in the universal degrees 
of the divine names. ” It shows that the particular and insigniﬁcant journey 
was like a key to a journey which was universal and an assembly of wonders.
If the pronoun refers to Almighty Allah, it is like this: “ He invited one 
of His servants to journey to His presence; and in order to entrust him with 
a duty, sent him from the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque, where He 
caused him to meet with the prophets who were gathered there. Then after 
showing that he was the absolute heir to the principles of all their religions, 
conveyed him through His realms in their inner and outer aspects as far as 
‘t h e   d i s t a n c e   o f   t w o   b o w - l e n g t h s .’ ”

He was certainly a servant and he journeyed on an ascension that was 
particular, but he held a trust that was related to the whole universe, and a 
light that would change the universe’s colour. Since he had with him a key 
to open the doors of eternal happiness, Almighty Allah described this Being  
with the attributes of hearing and seeing all things. For in this way he could 
demonstrate the world-embracing purposes and instances of wisdom of the 
trust, the light, and the key.

And, for example:

 | { z y x w v u t s r q p o  

( 35:1 ) © ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ £ ¢ ¡ ﮯ ~ }
In this sura, the Qur’an says: “ By adorning the heavens and the earth in this 
way  and  displaying  the  works  of  His  perfection,  their  All-Glorious  Crea-
tor causes innumerable spectators to extol and praise Him. He decks them 
out with uncountable bounties so that the heavens and the earth praise and 
extol unendingly the Most Merciful Creator through the tongues of all the 
bounties and those who receive them. ” After this it points out that since the 
Creator has given men and the animals and birds members and wings with 

482

THE WORDS

which to travel through the towns and lands of the earth, and since that All-
Glorious One has also given wings to the angels, the inhabitants of the realm 
of the heavens, in order to ﬂy through the celestial palaces of the stars and 
lofty  lands  of  the  constellations,  He  is  certainly  powerful  over  all  things. 
The One Who gives wings to a ﬂy, to ﬂy from fruit to fruit, and wings to a 
sparrow to ﬂy from tree to tree, is the One Who gives wings to the angels 
to ﬂy from Venus to Jupiter. Furthermore, the angels are not restricted to 
particularity like the dwellers of the earth; they are not conﬁned by a speciﬁc 
place. With the words: { z y it suggests that at one time they may 
be present on four or more stars; it gives details. Thus, by describing “ the 
arraying of the angels with wings, ” which is a particular event, it points to a 
universal, general workshop of divine power and its immensity, and veriﬁes 
and establishes it with the summary: © ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ 

Tenth Point of Eloquence

TENTH POINT OF ELOQUENCE: It sometimes happens that a verse 
mentions man’s rebellious acts, then restrains him with severe threats. Then, 
so that the severity of the threats should not cast him into despair and hope-
lessness, it concludes with some divine names which point to His mercy and 
console him. For example:
 ^ ] \ [ * Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M
 o n m l k j i h g f e d c b * ` _
( 17:42-44 ) x w v u t s r q p
This verse says: “ Say: if, like you say, Allah had had partners in his sover-
eignty, there would surely have been some signs of disorder, caused by the 
hand that stretched up to the throne of His dominicality and interfered. How-
ever, through the tongues of the manifestations and inscriptions of the divine 
names  which  they  manifest,  all  creatures,  universal  or  particular,  great  or 
small, from the seven levels of the heavens to microscopic organisms, glo-
rify the All-Glorious One signiﬁed by those names, declaring Him to be free 
of partners or like.

Yes, just as the heavens declare Him to be All-Holy through the light-
scattering words of the suns and stars, and through the wisdom they display 
and  their  order,  and  testify  to  His  unity,  so  the  atmosphere  gloriﬁes  and 
sanctiﬁes  Him  through  the  voice  of  the  clouds  and  words  of  the  thunder, 
lightning,  and  rain,  and  testiﬁes  to  His  unity.  The  earth  too  gloriﬁes  and 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – SECOND LIGHT – THIRD BEAM

483

declares to be One the All-Glorious Creator through its living words known 
as animals, plants, and other beings; and so does it glorify Him and testify 
to His unity through the words of its trees and their leaves, blossoms, and 
fruits. Similarly, despite their tiny size and insigniﬁcance, the smallest crea-
tures and most particular beings glorify the All-Glorious One signiﬁed by 
the numerous universal names they display, and testify to His unity through 
the inscriptions they bear.

Thus, since man is the summary and result of the universe, and vicege-
rent of the earth, and its delicate fruit, this verse points out how ugly and 
deserving of punishment is his unbelief and associating partners with Allah. 
For it is counter and contrary to the whole universe, which altogether glori-
ﬁes unanimously, with one tongue, its All-Glorious Creator and testiﬁes in 
its own way to His unity, and performs the duty of worship with which it is 
charged, carrying it out in perfect submission. But in order not to cast man 
into despair, and to show the wisdom in the All-Glorious Subduer’s permit-
ting such an inﬁnitely ugly rebellion and not destroying the universe around 
mankind, it says: 

x w v u
It shows with this summary the wisdom in His postponing it, and leaves a 
door open for hope.

Thus, you may understand from these ten indications of miraculousness 
that in the summaries at the conclusions of verses are numerous sprinklings 
of guidance and ﬂashes of miraculousness. The greatest geniuses among  the 
scholars of rhetoric have bitten their ﬁngers in absolute wonder and admira-
tion at these unique styles, and declared: ٍرَ(cid:131)َ(cid:92) ُم َ(cid:203)ﯬﯦ اَذٰ(cid:182) اَ(cid:174) and have believed 
with absolute certainty that

( 53:4 ) 4 3 2 1 0
This means that together with the above-mentioned indications, numerous 
further facets not included in our discussion are contained in other verses in 
the arrangement of which such an impress of miraculousness is apparent that 
even the blind may see it.

Third Beam

• THE THIRD BEAM of the Second Light

The  Qur’an  cannot  be  compared  with  other  words  and  speech.  This  is 
because speech is of different categories, and in regard to superiority, power, 
beauty and ﬁneness, has four sources: one is the speaker, another is the per-
son  addressed,  another  is  the  purpose,  and  another  is  the  form.  Its  source 

484

THE WORDS

is not only the form as literary people have wrongly shown. So in speech 
one should consider, “ Who said it? To whom did they say it? Why did they 
say it? In what form did they say it? ” One should not consider the words 
only and stop there. Since speech draws its strength and beauty from these 
four sources, if the Qur’an’s sources are studied carefully, the degree of its 
eloquence, superiority, and beauty will be understood. Indeed, since speech 
looks to the speaker, if it is command or prohibition, it comprises also the 
speaker’s will and power in accordance with his position. Then it eliminates 
resistance; it has an effect like physical electricity and increases in propor-
tion to the speech’s superiority and power. Take, for example, the verse:

( 11:44 ) Á À ¿ ¾ ½
That is, “ O earth! Your duty is completed, swallow your water. O skies! No 
need now remains, cease giving rain. ” And for example:

( 41:11 ) Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ » º ¹ 
That is, “ O earth! O skies! Come whether you want to or not, you are anyway 
submissive to my wisdom and power. Emerge from non-being and come to 
the exhibition-place of my art in existence. ” And they replied: “ We come 
in perfect obedience. Through Your power, we perform every duty that You 
have shown us. ” Consider the power and elevatedness of these true, effec-
tive commands, which comprise power and will, then look at human words 
like the following nonsensical conversation with inanimate beings:

ُة َ(cid:175)ٰ(cid:193)ِ(cid:163)ْ(cid:170)ا اَ(cid:183)ُ(cid:99)َ

ّ(cid:192)َا ىِ(cid:174)وُ(cid:162)َو ُءا َ(cid:175)َ(cid:126) اَ(cid:192) يِ

Can  the  two  commands  be  compared?  Yes,  is  there  are  any  comparison 
between  wishes  arising  from  desires  and  the  ofﬁcious  commands  issuing 
from those wishes, and the command of a commander of real authority? Can 
there be any comparison between such words and the effective command, 
“ Forward march! ” of a supreme commander of a vast army? For if such a 
command is heard from a common soldier, while the two commands are the 
same in form, in meaning they are as different as a common soldier and the 
commander of an army.

And for example the verses:

( 36:82 ) Å Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼  

and,

( 2:34 ) z y x w v 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – SECOND LIGHT – THIRD BEAM

485

Look at the power and elevatedness of these two verses, then look at man’s 
speech in the form of commands. Is the latter not like a ﬁreﬂy in relation 
to  the  sun?  In  order  to  describe  his  act  to  both  eye  and  ear,  a  true  owner 
describes his act while performing it, and a true artist explains his art as he 
works it, and a true bestower explains his bounties as he bestows them, that 
is, in order to combine both word and act, each says: “ Look! I have done 
this and I am doing this in this way. I did that for this reason, and this will be 
thus, and I am doing this so it will be like that. ”

And for example:

 ] * [ Z Y X W V U T S R Q P
 l k j i * g f e d c b a ` _ ^
 z * x w v u t s r q p o * m
( 50:6-11 ) ª © ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ £ ¢ ¡  * ~ } | {
Can there be any comparison between these descriptions, these acts, which 
shine like the starry fruits of Paradise in the constellation of this sura in the 
skies of the Qur’an, and this mentioning many levels of proofs within them 
by means of the order of rhetoric, and this proving the resurrection of the  
dead, its conclusion, with the phrase ª ©   thus silencing those people 
at the start of the sura who deny resurrection – can there be any compari-
son between this and the discussions of men about meddlesome acts which 
have little connection with them? It is not even the comparison of pictures 
of ﬂowers drawn by copying, and real living ﬂowers. To fully explain the 
meaning from Q P to ª ©  would be very lengthy, so we shall 
just pass over it with a brief indication, as follows. 

Since,  at  the  start  of  the  sura,  the  unbelievers  deny  resurrection,  the 
Qur’an gives a long introductory passage in order to compel them to accept 
it. It says: “ Do you not look at the skies above you, which we have con-
structed in such magniﬁcent, orderly fashion? Do you not see how We have 
adorned it with stars and the sun and the moon, and how We have allowed 
no fault or defect? Do you not see how We have spread out the earth for you 
and with what wisdom We have furnished it? We have ﬁxed mountains on it 
and protected it from the encroachment of the sea. Do you not see how We 
have created every variety of plant and growing thing on the earth, beautiful 

486

THE WORDS

and of every colour, and how We have made beautiful every part of it with 
them. And do you not see how we send down bounteous rain from the skies, 
and with it create gardens and orchards, and grains, and tall, fruit-bearing 
trees like the delicious date, and how I cause them to grow and send My 
servants sustenance with them? And do you not see that I raise to life the 
dead country with the rain? I create thousands of worldly resurrections. Just 
as I raise up with My power these plants out of this dead country, that is 
how your coming-forth will be at the resurrection. At the resurrection, the 
earth will die and you will come forth alive. ” Can there be any comparison 
between the eloquent explanations these verses set forth in proving resurrec-
tion, only one thousandth of which we have been able to allude to, and the 
words man puts forward to support a claim?

From the beginning of this treatise up to here, in endeavouring to make 
an obstinate enemy accept the Qur’an’s miraculousness by way of impartial 
reasoning, known as ascertaining the truth, we have left secret many of the 
Qur’an’s  rights.  We  have  brought  that  Sun  in  among  candles  and  drawn 
comparisons. We have carried out the duty of ascertaining the truth and have 
proved its miraculousness in brilliant fashion. Now, in one or two words, not 
in the name of ascertaining the truth, but in that of reality, we shall point to 
the Qur’an’s true station, which is beyond comparison.

Indeed, the comparison of other speech to the Qur’an is that of minuscule 
reﬂections of stars in pieces of glass. How can the Qur’an’s words, each of 
which depict and show a constant truth, be compared with the  meanings 
man  depicts  through  his  words  in  the  minute  mirrors  of  his  thoughts  and 
feelings?  How  can  the  angelic,  living  words  of  the  Qur’an,  which  inspire 
the lights of guidance and are the speech of the All-Glorious Creator of the 
sun and the moon, be compared with man’s biting words with their bewitch-
ing substance and sham subtleties for arousing base desires? Yes, the com-
parison of poisonous vermin and insects, and blessed angels and luminous 
spirit beings, is that of man’s words and those of the Qur’an. The Twenty-
Fifth Word together with the previous twenty-four Words have proved these 
truths. This claim of ours is not unsubstantiated; its proof is the above-men-
tioned conclusion. Indeed, how can the words of the Qur’an, which are all the 
shells of jewels of guidance, and sources of the truths of belief and springs 
of the fundamentals of Islam, and have come directly from the throne of the 
All-Merciful, and above and beyond the universe look to man and descend 
to him, and comprise divine knowledge, power, and will, and are the pre-
eternal address – how can its words be compared with man’s vain, fanciful, 
futile, desire-nurturing words?

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – SECOND LIGHT – THIRD BEAM

487

Yes, how can the Qur’an, which is like a tree of Tuba, and spreads in the 
form of leaves the world of Islam with all its qualities, marks, and perfec-
tions, all its ordinances and principles, and displays as fresh and beautiful 
through its water of life its puriﬁed scholars and saints, each like a ﬂower, 
and produces all perfections and cosmic and divine truths as fruits, and again 
like a fruit-bearing tree produces numerous seeds within its fruits each like a 
principle and programme for actions and displays truths in continuous suc-
cession  –  how  can  this  be  compared  with  man’s  speech,  which  we  know 
about?  اَ

ّ(cid:103)(cid:170)ا  َنْ(cid:192)َا

ّ(cid:103)(cid:170)ا  َنِ(cid:174) ىٰرـَ

ّ(cid:192)َرُ

Although for one thousand three hundred and ﬁfty years, the All-Wise 
Qur’an has set forth and displayed all its truths in the market of the uni-
verse, and everyone, all nations, all countries have taken some of its jewels 
and its truths, and they do take them, neither the familiarity, nor the abun-
dance,  nor  the  passage  of  time,  nor  the  great  changes  have  damaged  its 
valuable truths and ﬁne styles, or caused it to age, or desiccated it, or made 
it lose its value, or extinguished its beauty. This on its own is an aspect of 
miraculousness.

If someone were to come forward now and put some of the truths the 
Qur’an brought into a childish order according to his own fancies, and 
if he were to compare these with some of the Qur’an’s verses in order to 
contest  them,  and  say  “ I  have  uttered  words  close  to  the  Qur’an’s, ”  it 
would be utterly foolish, like in the following example: there is a com-
mon man, a builder of ordinary houses, incapable of understanding the 
elevated inscriptions of a master builder who has built a splendid palace 
the  stones  of    which  are  various  jewels  and  has  decorated  it  with  har-
monious  adornments  which  look  to  the  elevated  inscriptions  of  all  the 
palace and their relation to the stones. If the common man, who had no 
share in any of the jewels and adornment of the palace, were to enter it, 
destroy the elevated inscriptions in the valuable stones and put it into a 
form, an order, similar to that of an ordinary house in accordance with 
his childish desires and tack on a few beads pleasing to his juvenile view, 
and then say, “ Look! I have greater skill and wealth and more precious 
adornments than the builder of the palace; ” in comparison, it would be 
the art of a crazy, raving forger.

THIRD LIGHT

First Gleam

The Third Light consists of three Gleams.
FIRST  GLEAM:  An  important  aspect  of  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous 
Expositions’s  miraculous  inimitability  was  explained  in  the  Thirteenth 
Word. It has been included here so that it might take its place among the 
other aspects of miraculousness, its brothers. It is as follows: if you want 
to see and appreciate how, like shining stars, all the Qur’an’s verses scatter 
the darkness of unbelief by spreading the light of miraculousness and guid-
ance, imagine yourself in the age of ignorance and desert of savagery where 
everything was enveloped in lifeless veils of nature, under the darkness of 
ignorance and heedlessness. Then suddenly from the elevated tongue of the 
Qur’an, you hear verses like:

( 57:1 ) μ ´ ³ ² ± ° ¯ ® ¬ « 
( 62:1 ) , + * ) ( ' & % $ # " !
See how those dead or sleeping creatures of the world spring to life in the 
minds of those listening at the sound of  !  «  how they awake, spring 
up, and mention Allah’s names! And at the sound of,

( 17:44 ) f e d c b 
the stars in those black skies, each a lifeless piece of ﬁre, and the wretched 
creatures on the face of the earth present the following view to those listen-
ing: the sky appears as a mouth and the stars as wisdom-displaying words 
and truth-uttering lights. The earth appears as a head, the land and sea as 
tongues, and all the animals and plants as words of gloriﬁcation. Otherwise 
you  will  not  appreciate  the  subtleties  of  the  pleasure  at  looking  from  this 
time to that. For if you look at each verse as having scattered its light since  
that time, and having become like universally accepted knowledge with the 
passage of time, and as shining with the other lights of Islam, and taking its 
colour from the sun of the Qur’an, or if you look at it through a superﬁcial 
and simple veil of familiarity, you will not truly see what sort of darkness 
each  verse  scatters  or  how  sweet  is  the  recital  of  its  miraculousness,  and 
you will not appreciate this sort of its miraculousness among its many sorts. 
If you want to see one of the highest degrees of the Qur’an of Miraculous 
Exposition’s miraculous inimitability, listen to the following comparison:

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – THIRD LIGHT – FIRST GLEAM

489

Let us imagine an extremely strange and vast and spreading tree which 
is concealed beneath a veil of the unseen and hidden in a level of conceal-
ment. It is clear that there has to be a relationship, harmony, and balance 
between a tree and all its members, such as its branches, fruits, leaves, and 
blossom, the same as between man’s members. Each of its parts takes on 
a form and is given a shape in accordance with the nature of the tree. So 
if someone appears and traces a picture on top of the veil corresponding 
to the members of the tree, which has never been seen, then delimits each 
member,  and  from  the  branches  to  the  fruit,  and  the  fruit  to  the  leaves 
draws a form proportionately, and ﬁlls the inﬁnitely distant space between 
its source and its extremities with drawings showing exactly the shape and 
form of its members, certainly no doubt will remain that the artist sees the 
concealed  tree  with  an  eye  that  penetrates  and  encompasses  the  unseen, 
then he depicts it.

In  just  the  same  way,  the  discriminating  statements  of  the  Qur’an  of 
Miraculous  Exposition  concerning  the  reality  of  contingent  beings  ( that 
is, concerning the reality of the tree of creation which stretches from the 
beginning of the world to the farthest limits of the hereafter, and spreads 
from the earth to the divine throne and from minute particles to the sun ) 
have preserved the proportion between the members to such a degree and 
have given each member and fruit a form so suitable that at the depictions 
of the Qur’an, all exacting scholars have declared at the conclusion of their 
investigations:  “ What  wonders  Allah  has  willed!  How  great  are  Allah’s 
blessings! ” They have said: “ It is only you who solves and unravels the 
talisman of the universe and riddle of creation, Oh All-Wise Qur’an! ” 

( 16:60 )  j  i  h – and there is no error in the comparison – let us 
represent the divine names and attributes and dominical acts and deeds as a 
Tuba tree of light, the sphere of whose grandeur stretches from pre-eternity 
to  post-eternity,  and  the  limits  of  whose  vastness  spread  through  inﬁnite, 
endless space and encompass it, and the limits of whose deeds stretch from,

THE WORDS

The All-Wise Qur’an has described that luminous reality, the truths of those 
names and attributes, and acts and deeds, together with all their branches and 
twigs and aims and fruits, in a way so harmonious, so ﬁtting for one another, 
so appropriate for one another, without marring one another or spoiling the 
decree of one another, or their being remote from one another, that all the 
people of illumination and those who have penetrated to the realities, and all 
the wise and the sage who have journeyed in the realm of the inner dimen-
sions of things, have declared: “ Glory be to Allah! ” in the face of that Dis-
criminating Exposition, and have afﬁrmed it, saying: “ How right, how con-
formable with reality, how ﬁne, how worthy! ”

Take, for example, the six pillars of belief. They resemble a single branch 
of  those  two  mighty  trees  which  look  to  the  entire  sphere  of  contingency 
and sphere of necessity: it depicts all the branches and boughs of those pil-
lars – as far as the furthest fruits and ﬂowers – observing such a harmony 
and proportion between them, and describes them in a manner so balanced, 
and illustrates them a way so symmetrical that the human mind is powerless 
to perceive it and stands astonished at its beauty. The proof that a beauty of 
proportion and perfect relation and complete balance have been preserved 
between the ﬁve pillars of Islam, which are like one twig of the branch of 
belief, down to the ﬁnest details, smallest point of conduct, furthest aims, 
most profound wisdom, and most insigniﬁcant fruits, is the perfect order and 
balance and beauty of proportion and soundness of the Greater Shari‘a of 
Islam, which has emerged from the decisive statements, senses, indications, 
and  allusions  of  the  comprehensive  Qur’an;  they  form  an  irrefutable  and 
decisive proof and just witness that cannot be doubted. This means that the 
expositions of the Qur’an cannot be attributed to man’s partial knowledge, 
and particularly to the knowledge of someone unlettered. They rest rather on 
a comprehensive knowledge and are the word of One Who is able to see all 
things together and observe in one moment all truths between pre-eternity 
and post-eternity. In this we believe.

Second Gleam

SECOND  GLEAM:  Just  how  far  the  human  philosophy  which  chal-
lenges  Qur’anic  wisdom  has  fallen  in  the  face  of  that  wisdom  has  been 
explained and illustrated with comparisons in the Twelfth Word and proved 
in the other Words. We therefore refer readers to those treatises and  for now 
offer a further comparison from another point of view. It is as follows:

Human science and philosophy look at the world as ﬁxed and constant. 
And they discuss the nature of beings and their characteristics in detail; if 
they do speak of their duties before their Maker, they speak of them brieﬂy. 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – THIRD LIGHT – SECOND GLEAM

491

Quite simply, they speak only of the decoration and letters of the book of 
the universe and attach no importance to its meaning. Whereas the Qur’an 
looks on the world as transient, passing, deceptive, travelling, unstable, and 
undergoing  revolution.  It  speaks  brieﬂy  of  the  nature  of  beings  and  their 
superﬁcial and material characteristics, but mentions in detail the worship-
ful duties with which they are charged by the Maker, and how and in what 
respects they point to His names, and their obedience before the divine crea-
tional commands. We therefore shall take a look at the differences between 
human philosophy and Qur’anic wisdom in regard to detailed or summary 
consideration, and shall see which is pure truth and reality.

A watch we hold in our hand appears to be unmoving and at rest, but its 
inside is in perpetual upheaval through the motion of the workings and the 
constant anguish of the cogwheels and parts. In just the same way, together 
with its apparent stability, this world, which is a huge clock of divine power, 
is perpetually revolving within upheaval and change, transience and evanes-
cence. Indeed, since time has entered the world, night and day are like a two-
headed hand counting the seconds of that huge clock. The years resemble 
a hand counting its minutes, while the centuries count its hours. Thus, time 
casts the world onto the waves of death and decline. It assigns all the past 
and the future to non-existence, leaving in existence only the present. 

Together with this form which time gives the world, with regard to space 
also it is like an unstable clock undergoing revolution. For since the space of 
the atmosphere changes swiftly and quickly passes from one state to another 
due to being ﬁlled and emptied with clouds sometimes several times a day, 
it  causes  change  like  a  hand  counting  the  seconds.  And  the  space  of  the 
earth, the ﬂoor of the house of the world, since with life and death and the 
animals and plants its face changes very rapidly, like a minute-hand it shows 
that this aspect of the world also is transient. And just as the earth is thus in 
regard to its face, so through the revolutions and upheavals within it, and the 
mountains emerging as a result and disappearing, this aspect of the world is 
slowly passing also, like an hour hand. And such change as the movements 
of the celestial bodies, the appearance of comets, the occurrence of solar and 
lunar eclipses, and falling stars, the space of the  heavens too, the ceiling of 
the house of the world, shows that the heavens also are not unmoving and 
at rest, but are progressing towards old age and destruction. Their change 
is slow and tardy like the hand counting the days in a weekly clock, but in 
every respect it demonstrates that they are transient and passing and heading 
for destruction.

492

THE WORDS

Thus, the world, in regard to the world, has been constructed on these 
seven pillars. These pillars perpetually shake it. But when the world which is 
thus in motion and being shaken looks to its Maker, the motion and change 
become the working of the pen of power, writing the missives of the Eter-
nally Besought One. And those changing states are the mirrors of the divine 
names, which, being constantly renewed, display with ever-differing depic-
tions the manifestation of the names’ qualities. 

Thus,  in  respect  of  the  world,  the  world  is  both  transient  and  hastens 
towards death, and is undergoing revolution. Although in reality it is depart-
ing like ﬂowing water, to the heedless eye it appears to be frozen; due to the 
idea of nature, it has become dense and turbid and a veil concealing the here-
after. Thus, through philosophical investigation and natural science, and the 
seductive amusements of dissolute civilization and its intoxicated passions, 
sick philosophy has both increased the world’s frozen state and inaction, and 
made denser heedlessness, and increased its opaqueness and turbidity, and 
caused the Maker and the hereafter to be forgotten. Whereas, with its verses,

( 56:1 ) _ ^ ]   ( 101:1-2 )/ . * ,
( 52:1-2 ) q p * n
the Qur’an cards the world in regard to the world like cotton, and casts it 
away. Through such expositions as,

   ( 7:185 ) ﮯ ~ } | { z
   ( 50:6 ) V U T S R Q P
( 21:30 ) k j i h g f e d c 
it gives the world a transparency and removes its turbidity. Through such 
light-scattering illuminations as,

    ( 24:35 ) | { z y 

( 6:32 )  v u t s r q
it melts the frozen, inactive world. Through such death-tainted expressions 
as,

  ( 82:1 ) # " ! 
  ( 81:1 ) # " !

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – THIRD LIGHT – THIRD GLEAM

493

   ( 84:1 ) . - ,
( 39:68 ) . - , + * ) ( ' & % $ # " ! 
it smashes the delusion that the world is eternal. Through such thunderous 
blasts as,

 = < ; : 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 / .
( 57:4 ) G F E D CB A @ ? >
( 27:93 ) k j i h g f e d c b a `

it scatters the heedlessness born of the notion of nature.

Thus, from beginning to end the Qur’an’s verses which are turned towards 
the universe proceed according to this principle. They reveal and display the 
reality of the world as it is. Through showing just how ugly the ugly world 
is, it turns man’s face from it and points out the beautiful world’s beautiful 
face,  which  looks  to  the  Maker.  It  fastens  man’s  eye  on  that.  It  instructs 
in true wisdom and knowledge, teaching the meanings of the book of the 
universe, and looking infrequently at the letters and decorations. It does not 
cause the meaning to be forgotten like drunken philosophy, nor make man 
enamoured of the ugly and waste his time on meaningless things due to the 
decoration of the letters.

Third Gleam

THIRD GLEAM: In the Second Gleam we pointed to the fall of human 
philosophy before Qur’anic wisdom and to the miraculousness of Qur’anic 
wisdom. Now, in this Gleam, we shall show the degree of the wisdom and 
science – before Qur’anic wisdom – of the puriﬁed scholars, the saints, and 
the enlightened among philosophers, the I s h r ā q i y y ū n , who are all students 
of the Qur’an, and shall brieﬂy indicate the Qur’an’s miraculousness in this 
respect.

The truest evidence of the All-Wise Qur’an’s sublimity, and the clearest 
proof of its truth and justice, and the most powerful sign of its miraculous 
inimitability  is  this:  it  has  preserved  the  balance  of  all  the  degrees  of  all 
the  areas  of  divine  unity  together  with  all  their  necessities  and  not  spoilt 
it, and has expounded them; it has preserved the balance of all the exalted 
divine truths; it has brought together all the ordinances dictated by the divine 
names and preserved their mutual proportion; and it has brought together the 
dominical and divine acts with perfect balance. Thus, such preserving and 

494

THE WORDS

balance and bringing together is a characteristic that is certainly not  present 
in human works nor in the products of the thought of the eminent among 
humankind. It is to be found nowhere in the works of the saints who have 
penetrated to the inner face of beings, which looks to their Creator, nor in the 
books of the I s h r a q i y y u n , who have passed to the inward, hidden meaning of 
things, nor in the knowledge of the spiritual who have penetrated the World 
of the Unseen. It is as if each group adheres to only one or two branches of 
the mighty tree of reality, as though they have practised a division of labour; 
each busies itself with only the fruit or the leaves. They either know nothing 
of the others, or do not concern themselves with them.

Absolute reality cannot be comprehended by restricted views. To com-
prehend it, a universal view like that of the Qur’an is necessary. For sure 
others  are  instructed  by  the  Qur’an,  but  with  their  particular  intelligences 
they can see completely only one or two sides of universal reality, and are 
preoccupied with them, and imprisoned in them. Due to either excess or neg-
ligence they spoil the balance of reality and mar its proportion and harmony. 
This truth is explained with an unusual comparison in the Second Branch of 
the Twenty-Fourth Word, and now we shall point to the matter with another 
comparison.

For  example,  let  us  suppose  there  is  some  treasure  under  the  sea,  full 
of innumerable jewels of various kinds. Divers are plunging the depths to 
search for the treasure’s jewels. Since their eyes are closed, they understand 
what is there through the dexterous use of their hands. A longish diamond 
comes into the hand of one of them. The diver assumes that the whole treas-
ure consists of a long, pillar-like diamond. When he hears of other jewels 
from his companions, he imagines that they are subsidiary to the diamond he 
has found, and are facets and embellishments of it. Into the hand of another 
passes a round ruby, while another ﬁnds a square piece of amber, and so on; 
each of them believes that the jewel he perceives with his hand is the essen-
tial,  major  part  of  the  treasure,  and  supposes  that  the  things  about  which 
he hears are additional parts and details of it. The balance of the truths is 
thus  spoilt,  and  the  mutual  proportion  too  is  marred.  The  colour  of  many 
truths changes; in order to see the true colour of reality they are obliged to 
resort to forced interpretation and elaborate explanations. Sometimes even 
they go as far as denial and rejection. Anyone who studies the books of the 
I s h r a q i y y u n  philosophers and the works of the Suﬁs who rely on illumina-
tions  and  visions  without  weighing  them  on  the  scales  of  the  Sunna,  will 
doubtless conﬁrm this statement of ours. That is to say, although their works 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – THIRD LIGHT – THIRD GLEAM

495

concern truths similar to those of the Qur’an and are taken from the Qur’an’s 
teachings, because they are not the  Qur’an, they are defective in that way. 
The  Qur’an’s  verses  also,  which  are  oceans  of  truths,  are  divers  for  that 
treasure under the sea. But their eyes are open and encompass the treasure. 
They see what there is in the treasure and what there is not. They describe 
and expound it with such harmony, order, and proportion that they show the 
true beauty and ﬁneness. For example, they see the vastness of dominicality 
expressed by the verses,
( 39:67 ) Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½
( 21:104 ) = < ; : 9 8

So too they see the all-encompassing mercy expressed by these:

The Qur’an’s verses see and show in detail each of the six pillars of belief 
in respect of this world and the hereafter, action and knowledge. They see 
and show intentionally and seriously each of the ﬁve pillars of Islam, and all 
the principles which ensure happiness in this world and the next. They pre-
serve their balance, perpetuate their proportion, and a form of the Qur’an’s 
miraculousness  comes  into  being  from  the  source  of  the  beauty  which  is 
born of the mutual proportion of the entirety of those truths.

It  is  due  to  this  great  mystery  that  although  the  scholars  of  theology 
( k a l ā m  )  are  students  of  the  Qur’an  and  one  section  of  them  has  written 
thousands of works of ten volumes each on the pillars of belief, because like 
the Mu‘tazilites they preferred reason to revelation, they have not been able 
to express with clarity so many as ten of the Qur’an’s verses, or prove them 
decisively, or convince persuasively concerning them. It is quite simply as 
though they have dug tunnels under distant mountains, taken pipes with the 
chains of causes to the ends of the world, there cut the chains and then dem-
onstrated knowledge of Allah and the existence of the Necessarily Existent

One, which are like the water of life. The Qur’an’s verses, however, can all 
extract water from every place like the staff of Moses, open up a window 
from everything, and make known the All-Glorious Maker. We have actu-
ally proved and demonstrated this fact in the Arabic treatise K a t r e , and in the 
other Words, which ﬂow forth from the ocean of the Qur’an.

It  is  also  due  to  this  mystery  that  since  the  leaders  of  the  heretical 
groups who have passed to the inward nature of things ( b ā ṭ i n  ) have not 
followed  the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  Sunna  but  relied  on  their  visions,  they 
have returned having gone half way. Becoming leaders of a community, 
they have founded sects. And being unable to preserve the proportion and 
balance of the Qur’anic truths, they have fallen into innovation and mis-
guidance and driven a community of people down the wrong road. Thus, 
the complete impotence of all of them demonstrates the miraculousness of 
the Qur’an’s verses.

Conclusion

* * *
Conclusion 
Two ﬂashes of the Qur’an’s miraculousness were mentioned in the Four-
teenth Drop of the Nineteenth Word: its repetitions and brevity concerning 
the physical sciences, which are imagined to be faults, yet are both sources 
of ﬂashes of miraculousness. Also, a ﬂash of the Qur’an’s miraculousness 
which shines on the miracles of the prophets is demonstrated clearly in the 
Second Station of the Twentieth Word. Similarly to these, numerous ﬂashes 
of miraculousness have been mentioned in others of the Words and in my 
Arabic treatises. Deeming those to be sufﬁcient, here we shall say only this: a 
further miracle of the Qur’an is that just as all the prophets’ miracles display 
an impress of the Qur’an’s miraculousness, so together with all its miracles, 
is  the  Qur’an  itself  a  miracle  of  the  Prophet  Muhammad  ( UWBP ).  And 
all the miracles of the Prophet Muhammad ( UWBP ) are a miracle of the 
Qur’an that demonstrate its relation with Almighty Allah. With the appear-
ance of that relation, all of its words become miracles. For then a single of 
its words may contain the meaning of a tree of truths, like a seed; and may 
be connected with all the members of a mighty truth, like the centre of the 
heart;  and  since  its  relies  on  an  all-encompassing  knowledge  and  inﬁnite 
will, it may look to innumerable things together with their letters, totalities, 
situations, and positions. It is because of this that the scholars of the science 
of letters claim that they have found a pageful of secrets in a single of the 
Qur’an’s letters, and they prove what they claim to adepts of that science.

Now, gather together in your mind’s eye all the Lights, Rays, Flashes,

First Addendum

[ Of the Addenda added to the Twenty-Fifth Word, this First Addendum 
consists of the Seventeenth Degree of the First Station of the Seventh 
Ray, T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n , on account of its station. ]

Knowing the aim of life in this world, and the life of life, to be belief, 
the tireless and insatiable traveller through the world who was questioning 
the universe concerning his Sustainer then said to himself: “ Let us refer to 
the book called the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, which is known as the 
word and speech of the One we are seeking, and is the most famous, bril-
liant,  dominant  book  in  the  world,  challenging  everyone  in  every  century 
who does not submit to it. But ﬁrst we must prove that it is the book of our 
Creator. ” And he started to search.

Since the traveller lived at this time, he looked ﬁrst at the R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
which consists of ﬂashes of the Qur’an’s miraculousness, and saw that its 
one hundred and thirty parts are ﬁne points and lights of the verses of that 
Distinguisher between Truth and Falsehood, and authentic explanations of 
them. Although through striving and endeavour the R i s a l e - i   N u r  has spread 
the Qur’anic truths everywhere in an age as obstinate and atheistic as this, 
the  fact  that  no  one  has  opposed  it  successfully  proves  that  the  Qur’an, 
which is its master, source, authority, and sun, is heavenly and revealed, and 
not man’s word. Only one proof of the Qur’an out of the hundreds of the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , the Twenty-Fifth Word together with the last part of the Nine-
teenth Letter, has proved so decisively that the Qur’an is miraculous in forty 
aspects that everyone who has seen them, rather than criticizing or objecting 
to them, has been full of wonder at their proofs, appreciating and praising 
them. So referring it to the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  to prove the Qur’an’s miraculous 
aspects and its being the Word of Allah, the traveller only noted with brief 
indications several points demonstrating its greatness. 

First Point

F i r s t   P o i n t :  Just as with all its miracles and all its truths, which are an 
indication  of  its  veracity,  the  Qur’an  is  a  miracle  of  Muhammad  ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ), so too with all his miracles and the evidences 

499

500

THE WORDS

Second Point

of his prophethood and perfections of his knowledge, Muhammad ( UWBP ) 
is a miracle of the Qur’an, and a decisive proof that it is the Word of Allah.
S e c o n d   P o i n t :  The Qur’an caused a transformation in social life in this 
world in so luminous, happy, and truthful a fashion, and brought about such 
a  revolution  in  both  men’s  souls,  and  hearts,  and  spirits,  and  minds,  and 
in  their  personal  lives,  social  lives,  and  political  lives,  and  continued  and 
directed that revolution, that every minute for fourteen centuries its six thou-
sand six hundred and sixty-six verses have been recited with deep reverence 
by the tongues of at least one hundred million men, and it has trained men, 
puriﬁed their souls and cleansed their hearts, and has caused spirits to unfold 
and progress, given direction and light to minds, and vitality and happiness 
to life. For sure, such a book has no like; it is a wonder, a marvel, a miracle.
T h i r d   P o i n t :  The eloquence the Qur’an has demonstrated from that age 
till now is illustrated by the following: it caused Labid’s daughter to remove 
from the walls of the Ka‘ba the famous verses written in gold of the most 
celebrated  poets  called  the  Seven  Hanging  Poems,  and  to  declare  while 
doing so: “ Beside the verses of the Qur’an these no longer have any value! ”

Third Point

Also, when a bedouin poet heard the verse, 
( 15:94 ) 0 / .
being recited, he bowed down in prostration. When asked if he had become 
a Muslim, he replied: “ No, I was prostrating before the eloquence of this 
verse. ”

Also,  thousands  of  brilliant  scholars  and  learned  literary  ﬁgures  like 
the geniuses of the science of rhetoric, ‘Abd al-Qahir Jurjani, Sakkaki, and 
Zamakhshari, all reached the conclusion that, “ The Qur’an’s eloquence is 
beyond man’s power, he could not achieve it. ”

Also, although from that time it has continuously issued a challenge pro-
voking  conceited  and  egotistical  orators  and  poets,  proclaiming  in  a  way 
which  will  sting  their  pride:  “ Produce  the  like  of  one  single  sura  or  be 
resigned  to  ignominy  and  ruin  in  this  world  and  the  next! ”,  the  obdurate 
orators of that time gave up disputing it verbally, the short way of producing 
the like of one sura, and chose the way of the war, which was lengthy and 
threw their lives and property into peril, thus proving that it was not possible 
to take the short way. 

Also, millions of Arabic books are in circulation, written since that time 
by the Qur’an’s friends through the desire to resemble and imitate it, and 
by its enemies, driven to combat and criticize it, and such works are being 

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST ADDENDUM

501

written and have improved through the meeting of minds and ideas, but if 
even  the  most  common  man  should  listen  to  them,  he  would  declare  that  
none of them have reached it, saying: “ The Qur’an does not resemble these 
and is not of their level. It is either lower than all of them or higher. No one 
in the world, no unbeliever, nor an idiot even, can say that it is lower, which 
means that the degree of its eloquence is above all of them. ” 

One time, a man recited the verse,

( 57:1 ) ± ° ¯ ® ¬ «
and said: “ I can’t see the eloquence in this, although it is considered won-
derful. ” So it was said to him, “ You return to that time like the traveller, and 
then listen to it. ” So imagining himself to be there before the Qur’an was 
revealed, he saw the beings of the world to be lifeless, without conscious-
ness  and  duties,  wretched  and  obscure  in  an  unstable,  transitory  world  in 
the middle of limitless, empty space. Suddenly, listening to this verse from 
the tongue of the Qur’an, he saw that it drew back a veil from the universe 
and face of the world, illuminating it. He saw that this pre-eternal address 
and eternal decree instructs the conscious beings lined up in the centuries, 
revealing the universe to be like a huge mosque, and foremost the heavens 
and the earth, and all beings, to be employed in the gloriﬁcation and remem-
brance of Allah, enthusiastically performing their duties with joy and eager-
ness. He appreciated the degree of eloquence of this verse, and comparing 
the others to it, understood one of the thousands of instances of wisdom in 
the recitation of the Qur’an’s eloquence overspreading half the earth and a 
ﬁfth of mankind, and, being held in utter veneration, perpetuating its sub-
lime sovereignty for fourteen centuries without break.

Fourth Point

F o u r t h  P o i n t :  The Qur’an displays an agreeableness so true that for those 
who recite it, its many repetitions, which cause weariness of even the sweet-
est things, do not cause weariness, rather for those whose hearts are not cor-
rupted nor taste spoilt, the repetitions increase its agreeableness. Since early 
times this has been accepted by everyone and become proverbial. Further-
more, it demonstrates such a freshness, youth, and originality that although 
it has lived for fourteen centuries and has been freely available to everyone, 
it has preserved its freshness as though newly revealed. Each century has 
seen it to be young as though it was addressing that century in particular. 
And  although  in  order  to  beneﬁt  from  it  all  the  time,  all  the  branches  of 
scholars have always had copies of it present with them in large numbers 
and have followed and emulated its style and manner of expression, it has 
preserved the originality in its style and manner of exposition exactly.

Fifth Point

502

THE WORDS

Sixth Point

F i f t h   P o i n t :   One  wing  of  the  Qur’an  is  in  the  past,  and  one  is  in  the 
future, and just as its root and one wing are the agreed truths of the former 
prophets, and it conﬁrms and corroborates them, and they too conﬁrm it with 
the  tongue  of  unanimity;  so  too  all  the  true  Suﬁ  paths  and  ways  of  saint-
hood  whose  fruits,  the  saints  and  puriﬁed  scholars,  who  receive  life  from 
the Qur’an, show through their vital spiritual progress that their blessed tree 
is living, effulgent, and the means to truth. They grow and live under the 
protection of its second wing, and testify that the Qur’an is pure truth and 
the assembly of truths and in its comprehensiveness, is a matchless wonder.
S i x t h   P o i n t :   The  Qur’an’s  truthfulness  and  veracity  show  that  its  six 
aspects are luminous. Indeed, the pillars of argument and proof beneath it; 
the ﬂashes of the stamp of miraculousness above it; the gifts of happiness 
in this world and the next before it, its goal; the truths of heavenly revela-
tion, its point of support behind it; the assent and evidence of innumerable 
upright minds to its right; and the true tranquillity, sincere attraction, and 
submission of sound hearts and clean consciences on its left all prove that 
the Qur’an is a wondrous, ﬁrm, unassailable citadel of both the heavens and 
the earth. 

Similarly, the universe’s Disposer, Who has made it His practice to fore-
most always exhibit beauty in the universe, protect good and right, and elim-
inate imposters and liars, has set His seal on its being sheer truth and right 
on six levels, and not being man’s word, and its containing no error; and by 
giving it the most acceptable, highest, and most dominant place of respect 
and degree of success in the world, has conﬁrmed and endorsed the Qur’an. 
So too, the one who is the source of Islam and interpreter of the Qur’an 
– his believing in it and holding it in greater respect than everyone else, and 
being  in  a  sleep-like  state  when  it  was  revealed,  and  others  of  his  words 
and speeches not resembling or even approaching it, and that Interpreter’s 
describing  without  hesitation  and  with  complete  conﬁdence  through  the 
Qur’an true cosmic events of the past and the future hidden in the Unseen 
World, and no trickery or fault being observed in him while being under the 
gazes of the sharpest eyes, and his believing and afﬁrming every pronounce-
ment of the Qur’an with all his strength and nothing shaking him, is a stamp 
conﬁrming that the Qur’an is revealed and true and the blessed Word of his 
own Compassionate Creator.

Also,  a  ﬁfth  of  mankind,  indeed  the  greater  part  of  it,  being  drawn  to 
the Qur’an and bound to it in religion and giving ear to it eagerly desirous 
of the truth, and according to the testimony of many indications and events  

TWENTY-FIFTH WORD – FIRST ADDENDUM

503

and illuminations, the jinn, angels, and spirit beings also gathering around 
it in truth-worshipping fashion like moths whenever it is recited is a stamp 
conﬁrming  the  Qur’an’s  acceptance  by  all  beings  and  that  it  occupies  an 
elevated position.

Also, all the classes of mankind from the most stupid and lowly to the 
cleverest and most learned taking their full share of the Qur’an’s instruction 
and their understanding its profoundest truths, and all branches of scholars 
like the great interpreters of the Greater Shari‘a in particular, and hundreds 
of Islamic sciences and branches of knowledge, and the brilliant and exact-
ing scholars of theology and the principles of religion extracting from the 
Qur’an all the needs and answers for their own sciences – this is a stamp 
conﬁrming that the Qur’an is a source of truth and mine of reality.

Also, although the Arab literary ﬁgures, who were the most advanced in 
regard to literature, – those of them who were not Muslims – had the greatest 
need to dispute the Qur’an, their avoiding producing the like of only a single 
sura and its eloquence, eloquence being only one aspect of the seven major 
aspects of the Qur’an’s miraculousness, as well as the famous orators and 
brilliant scholars up to the present who have wanted to gain fame through 
disputing  it  being  unable  to  oppose  a  single  aspect  of  its  miraculousness 
and their remaining silent in impotence – this is a stamp conﬁrming that the 
Qur’an is a miracle and beyond the powers of man. 

Yes, the value, superiority, and eloquence of a speech or word is appar-
ent through knowing, “ from whom it has come and to whom, and for what 
purpose; ” the Qur’an then can have no like, and none can reach it. For the 
Qur’an is the speech and address of the Sustainer of all the worlds and Crea-
tor of the whole universe and a dialogue in no way hinting of imitation and 
artiﬁciality. It is addressed to the one sent in the name of all men, indeed 
of all beings, the most famous and renowned of mankind, the strength and 
breadth of whose belief gave rise to mighty Islam and raised its owner to the 
level of ‘the distance of two bow-strings’ and returned him as the addressee 
of the Eternally Besought One. It describes and explains the matters con-
cerning happiness in this world and the next, the results of the creation of the 
universe, and the dominical purposes within it. It expounds also the belief of 
the one it addresses, which was the highest and most extensive, and bore all 
the truths of Islam. It turns and shows every side of the huge universe like a 
map, a clock, or a house, and teaches and describes it in the manner of the 
Craftsman Who made them – to produce the like of this Qur’an of Miracu-
lous Exposition is not possible; the degree of its miraculousness cannot be 
attained to.

THE WORDS

Also,  thousands  of  precise  and  learned  scholars  of  high  intelligence  
have all written commentaries expounding the Qur’an, some of which are 
of  thirty,  forty,  or  even  seventy  volumes,  showing  and  proving  through 
evidence and argument the innumerable qualities, ﬁne points, characteris-
tics, mysteries, elevated meanings, and numerous indications concerning 
every sort of hidden and unseen matter in the Qur’an. And the one hundred 
and thirty parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  in particular, each of which proves with 
decisive arguments one quality, one ﬁne point of the Qur’an, – all its parts, 
such as T h e   M i r a c u l o u s n e s s   o f   t h e   Q u r ’ a n , and the Second Station of the 
Twentieth Word, which deduces many things from the Qur’an concerning 
the wonders of civilization like the railway and the aeroplane, and the First 
Ray, called S i g n s   o f   t h e   Q u r ’ a n , which divulges allusions of verses to the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  and electricity, and the eight short treatises called T h e   E i g h t  
S i g n s , which show how well-ordered, full of meaning, and mysterious are 
the letters of the Qur’an, and the small treatise proving in ﬁve aspects the 
miraculousness of the verses at the end of Sura al-Fath in regard to their 
giving news of the Unseen – each part of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  shows one truth, 
one light of the Qur’an. All this forms a stamp conﬁrming that the Qur’an 
has no like, is a miracle and a marvel, and that it is the tongue of the World 
of the Unseen in the Manifest World and the Word of One All-Knowing 
of the Unseen.

Thus, due to these qualities and characteristics of the Qur’an indicated 
above in six points, six aspects, and six levels, its sublime, luminous sover-
eignty and sacred, mighty rule have continued in perfect splendour illumi-
nating the centuries and the face of the earth for one thousand three hundred 
years. Also, on account of these qualities of the Qur’an, each of its letters 
has gained the sacred distinction of yielding at least ten rewards, ten merits, 
and ten eternal fruits, and the letters of certain verses and suras yielding a 
hundred or a thousand fruits, or even more, and at blessed times the light, 
reward, and value of each letter rising from ten to hundreds. The traveller 
through the world understood this and said to his heart: “ The Qur’an, which 
is thus miraculous in every respect, through the consensus of its suras, the 
agreement of its verses, the accord of its lights and mysteries, and the con-
currence of its fruits and works, so testiﬁes with its evidences in the form of 
proofs of the existence, unity, attributes, and names of a Single Necessarily 
Existent One that it is from its testimony that the endless testimony of all the 
believers has issued forth. ”

The Eleventh Ray 

A Flower of Emirdağ

[ An  extremely  powerful  reply  to  objections 
raised against repetition in the Qur’an. ]

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
Due to my wretched situation, this Matter is confused and graceless. But 
I  knew  deﬁnitely  that  beneath  the  confused  wording  was  a  most  valuable 
sort of miraculousness, though unfortunately I was incapable of expressing 
it.  But  however  dull  the  wording,  since  it  concerns  the  Qur’an,  it  is  both 
worship in the form of reﬂection, and the shell of a sacred, elevated, shin-
ing jewel. The diamond in the hand should be looked at, not its torn clothes. 
Also,  I  wrote  it  in  one  or  two  days  during  Ramadan  while  extremely  ill, 
wretched,  and  without  food,  of  necessity  very  concisely  and  brieﬂy,  and 
including many truths and numerous proofs in a single sentence. Its deﬁcien-
cies, then, should be overlooked! 1

My True and Loyal Brothers! While reading the Qur’an of Miraculous 
Exposition in Ramadan, whichever of the thirty-three verses I came to that 
in  the  First  Ray  describe  the  allusions  to  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  I  saw  that  the 
page and story of the verse also look to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its students to 
a degree – in so far as they have a share of the story. Particularly the Light 
Verse in Sura al-Nur, just as it points to the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  with ten ﬁngers, 
so  the  Darknesses  Verse  following  it  points  directly  at  those  opposing  it; 
these afford a further share. Quite simply, I understood that this station rises 
from particularity to universality and that one part of that universality is the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its students. 

Indeed,  in  regard  to  the  breadth,  exaltedness,  and  comprehensiveness 
that the Qur’an’s address receives from ﬁrstly the extensive station of the 

1.  As the Tenth Matter of the fruit of Denizli Prison, it is a small shining ﬂower of 
Emirdağ  and  of  this  month  of  Ramadan.  By  explaining  one  instance  of  wisdom  in  the 
repetitions of the Qur’an, it dispels the poisonous, putrid illusions of the people of mis-
guidance.

universal dominicality of the Pre-Eternal Speaker, and from the extensive 
station of the  one addressed in the name of humankind, indeed of all beings, 
and the most extensive station of all humankind’s guidance in all the centu-
ries, and from the station of the elevated comprehensive expositions of the 
divine  laws  concerning  the  regulation  of  this  world  and  the  hereafter,  the 
heavens and the earth, pre-eternity and post-eternity, and the dominicality of 
the Creator of the universe, and of all beings, this Address displays such an 
elevated miraculousness and comprehensiveness that both its apparent and 
simple level, which ﬂatters the simple minds of ordinary people, the most 
numerous  group  the  Qur’an  addresses,  and  its  highest  level,  grants  a  full 
share to all. But it is as though, in addressing every age and every class of 
people, not with only one share of a story or one moral of a historical tale, 
but with the elements of a universal principle, it is newly revealed. Particu-
larly its often repeated threats of U  ... U  and its severe expo sitions 
of the calamities coming from the heavens and the earth, – visited as retribu-
tion on the ‘Ad and Thamud peoples and on Pharaoh in punishment for their 
wrongdoing – with these it draws attention to the unequalled wrongs of this 
century, and through the salvation of such prophets as Abraham ( UWP ) and 
Moses ( UWP ) gives consolation to the oppressed believers.

Indeed, all past time and the departed ages and centuries, which in the 
view  of  heedlessness  and  misguidance  appear  to  be  a  fearsome  place  of 
non-existence and a grievous, ruined graveyard, the Qur’an of Miraculous 
Exposition presents to every century and class of people as living instructive 
pages, strange worlds, living and endowed with spirits, and existent realms 
of the Sustainer which are connected with us; with an elevated miraculous-
ness, it sometimes conveys us to those times, and sometimes brings those 
times to us. Infusing with life the universe, which in the view of misguid-
ance is lifeless, wretched, dead, and a limitless wasteland revolving amid 
separation and decline, with the same miraculousness this same Qur’an of 
Mighty Stature raises to life those dead beings, makes them converse with 
one another as ofﬁcials charged with duties and hasten to the assistance of 
one another; it instructs mankind, the jinn, and the angels in true, luminous, 
and pleasurable wisdom. 

For sure, then, it gains sacred distinctions, such as each of its letters yield-
ing ten merits, and sometimes a hundred, a thousand, or thousands of merits; 
and if all men and jinn were to gather together, their being unable to produce 
the  like  of  it;  and  its  speaking  completely  appropriately  with  all  mankind 
and all beings; and its always being inscribed with eagerness in the hearts of 

508

THE WORDS

millions of h a ﬁ z e s ; and its not causing weariness through its  frequent and 
numerous repetitions; and despite its many obscure passages and sentences, 
its being settled perfectly in the delicate, simple heads of children; and its 
being as agreeable as Zamzam water in the ears of the sick, the dying, and 
those distressed by a few words; and its gaining for its students happiness in 
this world and the next.

Its smoothness of style, which, observing exactly its interpreter’s being 
unlettered,  allows  for  no  bombast,  artiﬁciality,  or  affectedness,  and  its 
descending directly from the heavens, demonstrate a ﬁne  miraculousness. 
So too it shows a ﬁne miraculousness in the grace and guidance of ﬂatter-
ing the simple minds of ordinary people, the most numerous of the classes 
of  men,  through  the  condescension  in  its  expression  and  mostly  opening 
the clearest and most evident pages such as the heavens and the earth, and 
teaching the wondrous miracles of power and meaningful lines of wisdom 
beneath those commonplace things. 

It  makes  known  too  that  it  is  also  a  book  of  prayer  and  summons,  of 
invocation  and  divine  unity,  which  require  repetition.  For  it  demonstrates 
a sort of miraculousness by making understood in a single sentence and a 
single story through its agreeable repetitions, numerous different meanings 
to numerous different classes of people. Similarly, it demonstrates a sort of 
miraculousness  by  making  known  that  minor,  unimportant  things  in  ordi-
nary, commonplace events are within its compassionate view and the sphere 
of its will and regulation. For it attaches importance to even minor events 
involving the Companions of the Prophet ( UWBP ) when Islam was being 
established and the Shari‘a was being codiﬁed, showing those minor events 
to be general and universal principles which would produce most important 
fruits, as though they were seeds.

With regard to repetition being necessary due to the repetition of need, 
the repetition of certain verses is not a fault, for as the answers to numerous 
repeated questions over a period of twenty years, they instruct numerous dif-
ferent levels of people. Indeed, it is most powerful miraculousness and most 
elevated eloquence to repeat sentences so powerful they produce thousands 
of results and verses resulting from countless evidences. For they describe 
an inﬁnite, awesome, all-embracing revolution that by destroying utterly the 
vast universe and transforming it at Doomsday, will remove this world and 
found  the  mighty  hereafter  in  its  place,  and  will  prove  that  all  particulars 
and  universals  from  atoms  to  the  stars  are  in  the  hand  and  under  the  dis-
posal of a single Being, and will show the divine wrath and dominical anger 

A FLOWER OF EMİRDAĞ

– on account of the result of the universe’s creation – at mankind’s wrongdo-
ing, which brings to anger the earth and the heavens and the elements. Such 
repetition demonstrates an  eloquence and lucid style corresponding exactly 
to the requirements of the subject.

For example, as is explained in the Fourteenth Flash of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , 

the sentence,

(cid:2)(cid:3)
which constitutes a single verse and is repeated one hundred and fourteen 
times in the Qur’an, is a truth which binds the divine throne and the earth, 
and illuminates the cosmos, and for which everyone is in need all the time; 
if it were repeated millions of times, there would still be need for it. There 
is need and longing for it, not only every day like bread, but every moment 
like air and light.

And, for example, the verse,

j i h g f
which  is  repeated  eight  times  in  Sura    ٓمٓ(cid:127)ٰ(cid:142)  Repeating  on  account  of  the 
result  of  the  universe’s  creation  and  in  the  name  of  universal  dominical-
ity, the salvation of the prophets whose stories are told in the sura, and the 
punishments of their peoples, in order to teach that that dominical dignity 
requires  the  torments  of  those  wrongdoing  peoples  while  divine  compas-
sion requires the prophets’ salvation, is a concise, miraculous, and elevated 
miraculousness, for which, if repeated thousands of times, there would still 
be need and longing.

And, for example, the verse,

which is repeated in Sura al-Rahman, and the verse,

} | { z

º ¹ ¸
in Sura al-Mursalat shout out threateningly to mankind and the jinn across 
the centuries and the heavens and the earth, the unbelief, ingratitude, and 
wrongdoing of those who bring the universe and the heavens and earth to 
anger, spoil the results of the world’s creation, and deny and respond slight-
ingly to the majesty of divine rule, and violate the rights of all creatures. If 
a general lesson thus concerned with thousands of truths and of the strength 
of thousands of matters were repeated thousands of times, there would still 

510

be need for it and its awe-inspiring conciseness and beautiful, miraculous 
eloquence.

And, for example, the repetition of the phrase, 
ْ(cid:202)ا  َتْ(cid:178)َا  َ
ِ(cid:107)َ(cid:178)َو اَ(cid:178)ْر ِ(cid:106)َاَو اَ(cid:179) ْ(cid:135)ّ

ّ(cid:179)(cid:170)ا  َنِ(cid:174) اَ(cid:179)ـّ

ِ(cid:171)َ(cid:114) ُناَ(cid:174)َ

ْ(cid:202)ا ُناَ(cid:174)َ

 ِراـَ

ّ(cid:202)ِا َهٰ(cid:170)ِا  ٓ

َ(cid:202) اَ(cid:192) 

َكَ(cid:178)اَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126)

in  the  supplication  of  the  Prophet  ( PBUH )  called  a l - J a u s h a n   a l - K a b i r , 
which is a true and authentic supplication of the Qur’an and a sort of sum-
mary proceeding from it. It contains the greatest truth and the most impor-
tant  of  the  three  supreme  duties  of  creatures  in  the  face  of  dominicality, 
the gloriﬁcation and praise of Allah and declaring Him to be All-Holy, and 
the most awesome question facing man, his being saved from eternal mis-
ery, and worship, the most necessary result of human impotence. So if it is 
repeated thousands of times, it is still few.

Thus, repetition in the Qur’an looks to ﬁrm principles like these. Some-
times  on  one  page,  even,  with  regard  to  the  requirements  of  the  position 
and  the  need  for  explanation  and  the  demands  of  eloquence,  it  expresses 
the  truth  of  divine  unity  perhaps  twenty  times,  explicitly  and  by  implica-
tion.  It  does  not  cause  boredom  but  affords  it  a  power  and  eagerness.  It 
has been explained in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  with proofs how appropriate, ﬁtting, 
and acceptable in the eyes of rhetoric are the repetitions in the Qur’an. The 
wisdom and meaning of the Meccan and Medinan Suras in the Qur’an of 
Miraculous Exposition being different in regard to eloquence, miraculous-
ness, and detail and brevity is as follows:

In Mecca, the ﬁrst line of those it was addressing and those opposed to 
it were the idolators of the Quraysh and untaught tribesmen, so a powerful 
and elevated rhetorical style was necessary, and a miraculous, convincing, 
persuasive conciseness. And to establish it, repetition was required. Thus, in 
most of the Meccan suras, repeating and expressing the pillars of belief and 
degrees in the afﬁrmation of divine unity with a most powerful, elevated, 
and miraculous conciseness, it proved so powerfully the ﬁrst creation and 
the Resurrection, Allah and the hereafter, not only in a single page, verse, 
sentence or word but sometimes in a letter, through grammatical devices like 
altering the positions of the words or sentences, making a word indeﬁnite 
and omissions and inclusions, that the geniuses and authorities of the science 
of rhetoric met it with wonder. The R i s a l e - i   N u r  and the Twenty-Fifth Word 
and its Addenda in particular, which prove in summary forty aspects of the 
Qur’an’s  miraculousness,  and  the  Qur’anic  commentary  I s h ā r ā t   a l - I ‘ j ā z  
from the Arabic R i s a l e - i   N u r , which in wondrous fashion proves the aspect 

A FLOWER OF EMİRDAĞ

511

of the Qur’an’s miraculousness in its word-order, have demonstrated in fact 
that the Meccan suras and verses contain the highest styles of eloquence and 
the most elevated, concise miraculousness.

As for the Medinan suras and verses, since the front line of those they 
were addressing and who opposed them were the People of the Book, the 
Jews and Christians who afﬁrmed Allah’s existence, what was required by 
eloquence and guidance and for the discussion to correspond to the situation, 
was not explanation of the high principles of religion and pillars of belief 
in a simple, clear, and detailed style, but the explanation of particular mat-
ters in the Shari’a and its injunctions, which were the cause of dispute, and 
the origins and causes of secondary matters and general laws. Thus, in the 
Medinan suras and verses, through explanations in a detailed, clear, simple 
style, in the matchless manner of exposition peculiar to the Qur’an, it mostly 
mentions within those particular secondary matters, a powerful and elevated 
summary – a conclusion and proof, a sentence related to divine unity, belief, 
or the hereafter which makes the particular matter of the Shari’a universal 
and  ensures  that  it  conforms  to  belief  in  Allah.  It  illuminates  the  passage 
and elevates it. The R i s a l e - i   N u r  has proved the qualities and ﬁne points and 
elevated eloquence in the summaries and conclusions, which express divine 
unity and the hereafter, and come mostly at the end of verses, like:

  ﴾ j i h g f e
  ﴾R Q P O N ﴿
  ﴾z y x ﴿
Ä Ã Â ﴿ 
It  explains  in  the  Second  Beam  of  the  Second  Light  of  the  Twenty-Fifth 
Word, ten out of the many ﬁne points of those summaries and conclusions, 
and proves to the obstinate that they contain a supreme miracle.

Yes, in expounding those secondary matters of the Shari’a and laws of 
social life, the Qur’an at once raises the views of those it addresses to ele-
vated, universal points, and transforming a simple style into an elevated one 
and instruction in the Shari’a to instruction in divine unity, it shows it is both 
a book of law and commands and wisdom, and a book of the tenets of faith 
and belief, and of invocation and reﬂection and summons. And by teaching 
many of the aims of Qur’anic guidance in every passage it displays a bril-
liant and miraculous eloquence different to that of the Meccan suras.

It  says:  “ While  creating  the  vast  majestic  earth  and  skies,  He  knows  and 
regulates  the  sentiments  of  the  heart. ”  With  an  exposition  of  this  sort,  it 
transforms  that  simple,  unlettered  level  and  particular  discussion  which 
takes into account the minds of ordinary people, into an elevated, attractive, 
and general conversation for the purpose of guidance.

A Question

A Question: “ Sometimes an important truth is not apparent to a superﬁ-
cial view, and in some positions the connection is not known when a concise 
phrase expounding divine unity or a universal principle is drawn out from 
a minor, ordinary matter, and it is imagined to be a fault. For example, to 
mention the extremely elevated principle:

( 12:76 ) ª © ¨ § ¦
when Joseph ( Peace be upon him ) seized his brother through subterfuge, 
does not appear to be in keeping with eloquence. What is its meaning and 
purpose? ”

The  Answer:  In  most  of  the  long  and  middle-length  suras,  each  of 
which is a small Qur’an, and in many pages and passages, not only two 
or three aims are followed, for by its nature the Qur’an comprises many 
books and teachings such as being a book of invocation, belief, and reﬂec-
tion, and a book of law, wisdom, and guidance. Thus, since it describes 
the majestic manifestations of divine dominicality and its encompassing 
all  things,  as  a  sort  of  recitation  of  the  mighty  book  of  the  universe  it 
follows many aims in every discussion and sometimes on a single page.

While instructing in knowledge of Allah, the degrees in divine unity, and 
the truths of belief, with an apparently weak connection it opens another 
subject of instruction in the following passage, joining powerful connec-
tions to the weak one. It corresponds perfectly to the discussion and raises 
the level of eloquence.

A Second Question

A Second Question: “ What is the purpose of the Qur’an proving and 
drawing attention to the hereafter, divine unity, and man’s reward and pun-
ishment thousands of times, explicitly, implicitly, and allusively, and teach-
ing them in every sura, on every page, and in every discussion? ”

The  Answer:  To  instruct  in  the  most  important,  most  signiﬁcant,  and 
most awesome matters in the sphere of contingency and in the revolutions 
in the universe’s history concerning man’s duty and the means to his eter-
nal  misery  or  happiness  –  man  who  undertook  the  supreme  trust  and  the 
divine vicegerency of the earth – and to remove his countless doubts and to 
smash his violent denials and obduracy, indeed, to make man conﬁrm those 
awesome revolutions and submit to those most necessary essential matters 
which are as great as the revolutions, if the Qur’an draws his attention to 
them thousands, or even millions of times, it is not excessive, for those dis-
cussions  in  the  Qur’an  are  read  millions  of  times,  and  they  do  not  cause 
boredom, nor does the need cease.
For example, since the verse,

( 85:11 )  ...    n m l k j i h g f e d

اًدـَ(cid:92)َا آ

َ(cid:183)ـ(cid:193)ِ(cid:158)  َن(cid:192) ِدِ(cid:170)اَ(cid:114)

announces  the  good  news  of  eternal  happiness  and  “ saves  from  the  eter-
nal extinction of death, which every moment shows itself to wretched man, 
both himself, and his world, and all those he loves, and gains for them an 
everlasting  sovereignty  if  it  were  repeated  thousands  of  millions  of  times 
and given the importance of the universe, it still would not be excessive nor 
lose its value. Thus, in teaching innumerable, invaluable matters of this sort, 
and  endeavouring  to  persuade,  convince,  and  prove  the  occurrence  of  the 
awesome revolutions that will destroy the present form of the universe and 
transform it as though it were a house, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposi-
tion certainly draws attention to those matters thousands of times explicitly, 
implicitly, and allusively, and this is not excessive but renews the bounty 
which  is  like  an  essential  need,  the  same  as  the  essential  needs  of  bread, 
medicine, air, and light are renewed.

THE WORDS

And, for example, as is proved decisively in the Risale-i Nur, the wisdom 
in the Qur’an repeating severely, angrily, and forcefully threatening verses 
like,

is that man’s unbelief is such a transgression against the rights of the uni-
verse and most creatures that it makes the heavens and earth furious and 
brings the elements to anger so that they deal blows on those wrongdoers 
with tempest and storm. According to the clear statement of the verses,
( 67:7-8 )  { z y x  *     v u t s r q p o
Hell so rages at those iniquitous deniers that it almost disintegrates with 
fury.  Thus,  through  the  wisdom  of  showing,  not  from  the  point  of  view 
of  man’s  smallness  and  insigniﬁcance  before  such  a  general  crime  and 
boundless aggression, but the importance of the rights of the Monarch of 
Universe’s subjects before the seriousness of the wrongful crime and the 
awesomeness of the unjust aggression, and the boundless ugliness in the 
unbelief  and  iniquity  of  those  deniers  –  in  accordance  with  the  wisdom 
of showing this, if repeating in His decree most wrathfully and severely 
the  crime  and  its  punishment,  thousands,  millions,  or  even  hundreds  of 
millions of times, it still would not be excessive and a fault, because for 
a  thousand  years  thousands  of  millions  of  people  have  read  such  verses 
every day with total eagerness and need, never becoming bored.

of the Qur’an. It shows that the torments of Hell are pure justice for the 
deniers who do not heed them.

And, for example, by repeating many times the stories of Moses ( Peace 
be upon him ), which contain many instances of wisdom and beneﬁts, like 
the  story  of  his  staff,  and  of  the  other  prophets  ( Peace  be  upon  them ),  it 
demonstrates that the prophethoods of all the other prophets are a proof of 
the veracity of the messengership of Muhammad ( PBUH ), and that one who 
does not deny all of them cannot in truth deny his messengership. For this 
purpose, and since everyone does not always have the time or capability to 
read the whole Qur’ an, it repeats those stories as it does the main pillars of 
belief, so as to make all the long and middle-length suras each like a small 
Qur’an. To repeat them then is not excessive, it is required by eloquence and 
teaches that the question of Muhammad ( PBUH ) is the greatest question of 
mankind and the most crucial matter of the universe.

It has been demonstrated decisively in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  with many proofs 
and indications that by giving the highest position to the person of Muham-
mad in the Qur’an and including him in four pillars of belief and holding 
ّ(cid:195)ا  َ
َ(cid:202) shows that the messengership 
ّ(cid:195)ا ُلو ُ(cid:126)َر ٌد َ
of Muhammad ( PBUH ) is the greatest truth in the universe, and the person 
of Muhammad is the most noble of creatures, and his universal collective 
personality and sacred rank, known as the Muhammadan Reality, is the most 
radiant Sun of the two worlds. His worthiness for this extraordinary position 
has also been proved. One of these proofs is this: 
According to the principle of  ِلِ(cid:150)اَ(cid:159)ْ(cid:170)اﯬﯦ  ُبَ(cid:93) َ

ّ(cid:127)(cid:170)َا since the equivalent of all 
the good works performed by all his community at all times enters his book 
of good works; and the light which he brought illuminates all the truths of 
the cosmos; and he makes grateful not only the jinn, mankind, and animate 
beings, but also the universe and the heavens and earth; and since the sup-
plications of plants, offered through the tongue of disposition, and the sup-
plications of animals offered through the tongue of their innate need, and 
the righteous of his ( PBUH ) community every day bequeathe to him their 
benedictions and supplications for mercy and spiritual gains, whose millions 
– and together with spirit beings, even, millions of millions – of unreject-
able supplications are accepted, as we actually witness with our eyes; and 
since each of the three hundred thousand letters of the Qur’an yield from a 
hundred to a thousand merits, only with regard to the recitation of the Qur’an 
by all his community, inﬁnite numbers of lights enter the book of his deeds;

– the One All-Knowing of the Unseen saw and knew that the Muhammadan 
( PBUH ) Reality, which is his collective personality, would in the future be 
like a Tuba-tree of Paradise, and in accordance with that rank accorded him 
supreme importance in the Qur’an, and in His Decree showed the following 
of him and receiving of his intercession through adhering to his Illustrious 
Sunna to be one of the most important matters concerning man. And from 
time to time He took into consideration his human personality and human 
state in his early life, which was a seed of the majestic Tuba-tree.

Thus, since the truths repeated in the Qur’an hold such value, all sound 
natures  will  testify  that  its  repetitions  represent  a  powerful  and  extensive 
miracle. Unless, that is to say, a person is afﬂicted with some sickness of the 
heart and malady of the conscience due to the plague of materialism, and is

Two Additions, Which Form a Conclusion
to the Tenth Topic

THE FIRST: Twelve years ago I heard that a fearsome, obdurate atheist 
had instigated a conspiracy against the Qur’an, which was to have it trans-
lated. He said: “ The Qur’an should be translated so that everyone can know 
just what it is. ” That is, he hatched a dire plan with the idea that everyone 
would  see  its  unnecessary  repetitions  and  its  translation  would  be  read  in 
its place. However, the irrefutable proofs of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  proved deci-
sively that “ A true translation of the Qur’an is not possible, and other lan-
guages cannot preserve the Qur’an’s qualities and ﬁne points in place of the 
grammatical language of Arabic. Man’s trite and partial translations cannot 
be substituted for the miraculous and comprehensive words of the Qur’an, 
every  letter  of  which  yields  from  ten  to  a  thousand  merits;  they  may  not 
be read in its place in mosques. ” Then the R i s a l e - i   N u r  spread everywhere 
and confounded that fearsome plan. I surmise that it was due to the idiotic 
and lunatic attempts of dissemblers to extinguish the sun of the Qur’an on 
account of Satan by pufﬁng at it like silly children having taken lessons from 
that atheist, that I was inspired to write this Tenth Matter while under great 
constraint and in a most distressing situation. But I do not know the reality 
of the situation since I have been unable to meet with anyone.

Second Addition

SECOND  ADDITION:  After  our  release  from  Denizli  Prison,  I  was 
staying on the top ﬂoor of the famous Şehir Hotel. The subtle, graceful danc-
ing of the leaves, branches, and trunks of the many poplar trees in the ﬁne 
gardens opposite me at the touching of the breeze, each with a rapturous and 
ecstatic  motion  like  a  circle  of  dervishes,  pained  my  heart,  sorrowful  and 
melancholy  at  being  parted  from  my  brothers  and  remaining  alone.  Sud-
denly the seasons of autumn and winter came to mind and a heedlessness 
overcame me. I so pitied those graceful poplars and living creatures swaying 
with perfect joyousness that my eyes ﬁlled with tears. With this reminder of 
the separations and non-being beneath the ornamented veil of the universe, 
the grief at a world-full of deaths and separations pressed down on me. Then 
suddenly, the Light the Muhammadan  ( UWBP ) Truth brought came to my 
assistance and transformed my grief and sorrow into joy. Indeed, I am eter-
nally grateful to the Muhammadan Being ( UWBP ) for  the assistance and 

517

THE WORDS

consolation which alleviated my situation at that time, only a single instance 
of the boundless effulgence of that Light for me, like for all believers and 
everyone. It was like this:

By showing those blessed and delicate creatures to be without function 
or purpose, and their motion to be not out of joy, but as though trembling 
on the brink of non-existence and separation and tumbling into nothingness, 
that heedless view so touched the feelings in me of desire for permanence, 
love  of  good  things,  and  compassion  for  fellow-creatures  and  life  that  it 
transformed the world into a sort of hell and my mind into an instrument 
of torture. Then, just at that point, the Light Muhammad ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ) had brought as a gift for humankind raised the veil; it 
showed in place of extinction, non-being, nothingness, purposeless, futility, 
and  separations,  meanings  and  instances  of  wisdom  to  the  number  of  the 
leaves of the poplars, and as is proved in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , results and duties 
which may be divided into three sorts: 

T h e   F i r s t   S o r t  looks to the All-Glorious Maker’s names. For example, 
if a master craftsman makes a wondrous machine, everyone applauds him, 
saying: “ What wonders Allah has willed! Blessed be Allah! ” Similarly, the 
machine congratulates the craftsman through the tongue of its disposition, 
through displaying perfectly the results intended from it. All living beings 
and all things are such machines; they applaud their Craftsman through their 
gloriﬁcations.

T h e   S e c o n d   S o r t   o f   t h e   I n s t a n c e s   o f   W i s d o m  looks to the views of liv-
ing creatures and conscious beings. Beings each become an agreeable object 
of study, a book of knowledge. They leave their meanings in the sphere of 
existence in the minds of conscious beings and their forms in their memo-
ries, and on the tablets in the World of Similitudes, and in the notebooks 
of the World of the Unseen, then they depart from the Manifest World and 
withdraw to the World of the Unseen. That is, they leave behind an appar-
ent existence, but gain many existences pertaining to meaning, the Unseen, 
and  knowledge.  Yes,  since  Allah  exists  and  His  knowledge  encompasses 
everything, in the view of reality, in the world of believers there is surely no 
non-being,  extinction,  nothingness,  annihilation,  and  transitoriness,  while 
the  world  of  unbelievers  is  full  of  non-existence,  separation,  nothingness, 
and  transience.  This  is  taught  by  the  saying,  which  is  on  everyone’s  lips, 
“ For those for whom Allah exists, everything exists; and for those for whom 
He does not exist, nothing exists; for them there is nothing. ”

519

IN  SHORT:  Just  as  belief  saves  man  from  eternal  annihilation  at  the 
time of death, so it saves everyone’s private world from the darknesses of 
annihilation and nothingness. Whereas unbelief, and especially if it is abso-
lute unbelief, both sends man and his private world to non-existence with 
death, and casts him into infernal darknesses. It transforms the pleasures of 
life into bitter poisons. Let the ears ring of those who prefer the life of this 
world to that of the hereafter! Let them come and ﬁnd a solution for this, or 
else let them embrace belief and be saved from these dreadful losses!

[ Divine determining 1 and the power of choice 2 are two important mat-
ters. We shall attempt to disclose a few of their mysteries in four topics. ]

First Topic

FIRST TOPIC

Divine determining and the power of choice are aspects of a belief per-
taining  to  state  and  conscience  which  show  the  ﬁnal  limits  of  Islam  and 
belief; they are not theoretical and do not pertain to knowledge. That is to 
say, a believer attributes everything to Almighty Allah, even his actions and 
self, till ﬁnally the power of choice confronts him, so he cannot evade his 
obligation and responsibility. It tells him: “ You are responsible and under 
obligation. ” Then, so that he does not become proud at his good deeds and 
his achievements, divine determining confronts him, saying: “ Know your 
limits; the one who does them is not you. ” Yes, divine determining and the 
power of choice are at the ﬁnal degrees of belief and Islam; the former has 
been included among the matters of belief to save the soul from pride, and 
the  latter,  to  make  it  admit  to  its  responsibility.  Obdurate  evil-command-
ing souls clinging to divine determining in order to clear themselves of the 
responsibility of the evils they have committed, and their becoming proud

2.  The power of choice or faculty of will ( j u z ’ ī   i r ā d a ,   j u z ’ - i   i k h t i y ā r ī  ), also known as 

free will. ( Tr. )

TWENTY-SIXTH WORD

and conceited on account of the virtues bestowed on them and their relying 
on the power of choice, are actions totally opposed to the mystery of divine 
determining and wisdom of the power of choice; they are not matters per-
taining to knowledge which might give rise to such actions.

For  ordinary  people  who  have  not  progressed  spiritually  there  may  be 
occasions when divine determining is used, and these are calamities and dis-
asters when it is the remedy for despair and grief. But it should not be used 
to justify rebellion and in matters of the future so that it becomes a cause 
of dissipation and idleness. That is to say, divine determining has not been 
included among the matters of belief to relieve people from their obligations 
and responsibility, but to save them from pride and conceit. While the power 
of choice has been included in order to be the source of evils, not to be the 
source of virtues, so that people become like the Pharaoh. 

Yes, as the Qur’an states, man is totally responsible for his evils, for it is 
he who wants the evils. Since evils are destructive, man may perpetrate much 
destruction with a single evil act, like burning down a house with one match, 
and he becomes deserving of an awesome punishment. However, he does 
not have the right to take pride in good deeds; his part in them is extremely 
small. For what wants and requires the good deeds is divine mercy, and what 
creates them is dominical power. Both request and reply, reason and cause, 
are from Allah. Man only comes to have them through supplication, belief, 
consciousness, and consent. As for evils, it is man’s soul that wants them, 
either through capacity or through choice – like in the white and beautiful 
light of the sun some substances become black and putrefy, and the black-
ness is related to their capacity – however, it is Almighty Allah Who creates 
the evils through a divine law which comprises numerous beneﬁts. That is to 
say, the cause and the request are from the soul, so that it is the soul which 
is responsible, while it is Almighty Allah Who creates the evils and brings 
them into existence, and since they have other results and fruits which are 
good, they are good. 

It is for the above reason that the ‘acquisition’ ( k e s b  ) of evil, that is, the 
desire for evil, is evil, but the creation of evil is not evil. A lazy man who 
receives damage from rain may not say that the rain is not mercy, for it com-
prises many instances of good. Yes, together with a minor evil in its crea-
tion are numerous instances of good. To abandon that good for a minor evil 
becomes a greater evil. Therefore, a minor evil becomes like good. There 
is no evil or ugliness in divine creation; they rather pertain to His servant’s 
wish and to his capacity.

522

THE WORDS

Furthermore, divine determining is both exempt from evil and ugliness 
with  regard  to  results  and  fruits,  and  free  from  tyranny  and  ugliness  with  
respect to reason and cause. Because divine determining looks to the true 
causes and acts justly. Men construct their judgements on causes which they 
see superﬁcially and fall into error within the pure justice of divine deter-
mining.  For  example,  a  judge  ﬁnds  you  guilty  of  theft  and  sends  you  to 
prison. You are not a thief, but you have committed a murder which no one 
knows about. Thus, divine determining also sentenced you to imprisonment, 
but it sentenced you for the secret murder and acted justly. Since the judge 
sentenced  you  for  a  theft  of  which  you  were  innocent,  he  acted  unjustly. 
Thus, in a single thing the justice of divine determining and divine creation 
and  man’s  wrongful  choice  or  acquisition  were  apparent  in  two  respects; 
you  can  make  analogies  with  this  for  other  things.  That  is  to  say,  divine 
determining and creation are exempt from evil, ugliness, and tyranny with 
regard to origin and end, source and branch, cause and results.

I f   i t   i s   s a i d :   “ Man  has  no  ability  to  create  with  his  power  of  choice 
and has nothing apart from ‘acquisition,’ which is as though theoretical, 
so how is it that in the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition he is shown to 
be rebellious and hostile towards the Creator of the heavens and the earth, 
Who complains greatly about him; the Creator mobilizes Himself and all 
His angels to assist His believing servants against the rebellious, affording 
them the greatest importance? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  Because disbelief, rebellion, and evil are destruction and 
non-existence.  However,  vast  destruction  and  innumerable  instances  of 
non-existence may result from a single theoretical matter and one instance 
of non-existence. If the helmsman of a large ship abandons his duty, the 
ship  may  sink  and  the  labour  of  all  those  employed  on  it  go  for  noth-
ing; all those instances of destruction will result from a single instance of 
non-existence.  Similarly,  since  disbelief  and  rebellion  are  non-existence 
and destruction, the power of choice may provoke them with a theoretical 
matter  and  cause  awesome  consequences.  For  although  disbelief  is  only 
one  evil,  it  insults  the  whole  universe,  accusing  it  of  worthlessness  and 
futility, and denies all beings, which display proofs of divine unity, and 
is contemptuous towards all the manifestations of the divine names. It is 
therefore pure wisdom that Almighty Allah utters severe complaints about 
the unbelievers, threatening them awesomely in the name of the universe 
and all beings and the divine names; it is pure justice that they should suf-
fer  eternal  punishment.  Since  through  unbelief  and  rebellion  man  takes 
the way of destruction, with a small act of service, he may perform a great 

TWENTY-SIXTH WORD

523

many  works.  In  the  face  of  unbelief  therefore,  the  believers  are  in  need 
of  Almighty  Allah’s  boundless  grace.  For  if  one  troublesome  child  tries 
to  burn    down  a  house,  ten  strong  men  who  have  undertaken  to  protect 
and repair it may be obliged to beseech the child’s parents, or even have 
recourse to the king. In the same way, the believers are in need of many 
divine favours in order to withstand the unmannerly people of rebellion.

I n   S h o r t :   If  the  one  speaking  of  divine  determining  and  the  power  of 
choice has perfect belief and is aware of the divine presence, he attributes 
the universe and himself to Almighty Allah, knowing them to be under His 
disposal. He has the right to speak of them. For since he knows himself and 
everything to be from Almighty Allah, he assumes the responsibility, basing 
it on his power of choice. He accepts that it is the source of evils and pro-
claims his Sustainer free of fault. He remains within the sphere of worship 
and undertakes the obligations with which he is charged by Almighty Allah. 
Moreover, he does not become proud at his good deeds and achievements; 
he  rather  looks  to  divine  determining  and  offers  thanks.  He  sees  divine 
determining in the calamities that befall him, and endures them in patience.
However, if the one speaking of divine determining and the power of 
choice is one of the heedless and neglectful, then he has no right to speak 
of  them.  For,  impelled  by  his  misguidance,  his  evil-commanding  soul 
attributes  the  universe  to  causes  and  divides  up  Allah’s  property  among 
them. And he attributes the ownership of himself to himself. He ascribes 
his acts to himself and to causes. His responsibility and faults, he refers to 
divine determining. He will ﬁnally ascribe the power of choice to Almighty 
Allah, and he will consider divine determining last of all; thus discussion 
of them becomes meaningless. To discuss them is only a trick of the soul 
which is entirely contrary to the wisdom in them, in order to save such a

choice? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  In seven ways:

The First

1.  This Second Topic is the most profound and difﬁcult of the questions of the mystery 
of divine determining. It is held by the all learned scholars to be one of the most impor-
tant and controversial questions of theology and belief, yet the R i s a l e - i   N u r  has solved it 
completely.

524

THE WORDS

The First: The All-Just and Wise One, to Whose wisdom and justice 
the universe testiﬁes with the tongue of order and balance, gave to man a 
power of choice of unknown nature which would be the means of reward 
and punishment for him. We do not know many of the numerous aspects 
of the All-Just and Wise One’s wisdom; our not knowing how the power 
of choice is compatible with divine determining does not prove that it is 
not so.

The Second

The  Second:  Of  necessity  everyone  perceives  in  himself  a  will  and 
choice; he knows it through his conscience. To know the nature of beings is 
one thing; to know they exist is something different. There are many things 
which  although  their  existence  is  self-evident,  we  do  not  know  their  true 
nature. The power of choice may be included among these. Everything is not 
restricted to what we know; our not knowing them does not prove the things 
we do not know do not exist.

The Third

The Third: The power of choice is not opposed to divine determining, 
indeed, divine determining corroborates the power of choice. For divine 
determining is a sort of divine knowledge. Divine knowledge is connected 
with our will and choice, in which case it corroborates it, it does not nul-
lify it.

The Fourth

The Fourth: Divine determining is a sort of knowledge. Knowledge is 
dependent on the thing known. That is, it knows it as it is. The thing known 
is not dependent on knowledge. That is, the principles of knowledge are not 
fundamental so that the knowledge directs the thing known with regard to 
its external existence. For the essence of the thing known and its external 
existence look to will and are based on power. Also, pre-eternity is not the 
tip of a chain reaching into the past which should be considered the end point 
in the existence of things and a source of compulsion. Rather, pre-eternity 
holds the past, the present, and the future all at once, looking at them from 
above like a mirror. In which case, it is not right to imagine an end to past 
time which stretches back within the sphere of contingency and call it pre-
eternity, and to suppose that things enter the knowledge of pre-eternity in 
sequence and that oneself is outside it; to reason thus is not right. Consider 
the following example to explain this mystery:

Suppose  you  holding  are  a  mirror  in  your  hand  and  the  area  to  your 
right is the past and the area to your left, the future; the mirror only holds 
what is opposite it. Then with a movement it holds both sides, but it cannot 
hold all of it. However low the mirror is held, less will appear in it, and the 
higher it rises, the area it encompasses expands, until it can hold both sides 

TWENTY-SIXTH WORD

525

in their entirety simultaneously. Whatever occurs in the areas reﬂected in 
the mirror in this position cannot be said to precede or follow one another, 
or to conform to or oppose one another. Divine determining is part of pre-
eternal knowledge, and in the words of the Hadith, pre-eternal knowledge 
is at an elevated station which from its lofty viewpoint encompasses eve-
rything  that  has  been  and  will  be  from  pre-eternity  to  post-eternity.  We 
and  our reasoning cannot be outside of it so we can be like a mirror to the 
area of the past.

The Fifth

The Fifth: Divine determining has a connection with cause and effect. 
That is, this effect will occur through this cause. In which case, it may not 
be asked: “ Since so-and-so’s death is determined at such-and-such a time, 
what fault has the man who ﬁred the riﬂe through his own choice, for if he 
had not ﬁred it, the other man still would have died? ”

Q u e s t i o n :  Why may it not be said?
T h e   A n s w e r :   Because  divine  determining  speciﬁed  that  so-and-so’s 
death would occur through the man’s riﬂe. If you suppose that he did not ﬁre 
the riﬂe, then you are supposing that divine determining had no connection 
with it, so what would you decree his death with? If you imagine cause and 
effect to be separate like the Jabriyya, or you deny divine determining like 
the Mu‘tazila, you leave the Sunni School and join the heretics. We people 
of truth say: “ If he had not ﬁred the riﬂe, we do not know whether or not the 
man would have died. ” The Jabriyya say: “ If he had not ﬁred it, the man 
still would have died. ” While the Mu‘tazila say: “ If he had not ﬁred it, he 
would not have died. ”

The Sixth

The Sixth: 1 According to Maturidi, inclination, the essence of the power 
of choice, is a theoretical or relative matter and may be attributed to Allah’s 
servants. But Ash‘ari considered it to have existence, so did not attribute it 
to them. However, according to Ash‘ari, the power of disposal within incli-
nation is a theoretical matter which makes the inclination and the disposal 
together a relative matter lacking a deﬁnite external existence. Theoretical 
or relative matters do not require causes through which, for their existence, 
necessity will intervene and nullify the will and power of choice. Rather, if 
the cause of the theoretical matters acquires the weight of preference, the 
theoretical  matter  may  become  actual  and  existent.  In  which  case,  at  that 
juncture, it may be abandoned. The Qur’an may say to a person at that point: 
“ This is evil; do not do it. ” Indeed, if Allah’s servants had been the creators 

1.  This is a truth addressing exact scholars in particular.

526

THE WORDS

of their actions and had had the power to create, then their wills would have 
been removed. For an established rule in the sciences of the principles of 
religion and philosophy is: ْدَ(cid:106)وُ(cid:192) ْمـَ(cid:170)  ْب ِ(cid:107)َ(cid:192) ْمـَ(cid:170) اَ(cid:174) “ If a thing is not necessary, it 
cannot come into existence [ of itself ]. ” That is, there has to be a cause for a 
thing to come into existence. The cause necessarily requires the effect. Then 
no power of choice would remain.

I f   y o u   s a y :  Preference without a cause or attribute to cause the prefer-
ence is impossible. Whereas the theoretical or relative matter we call  human 
acquisition sometimes does a thing and sometimes does not; if there is noth-
ing to cause the preference, preference without something to cause it would 
necessarily occur, and this demolishes one of the most important bases of 
theology and its principles?

T h e   A n s w e r :  A being preferable without something to make it preferable 
is impossible. That is, a being deemed preferable or superior without a cause 
or attribute to make it so is impossible. But preference without something 
to cause it is permissible and occurs. Will is an attribute, and its mark is to 
perform a work such as that.

I f   y o u   a s k :  “ Since it is Almighty Allah Who creates the murder, why do 

you call me a murderer? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  Because according to the rules of grammar, the active par-
ticiple  is  derived  from  the  inﬁnitive,  which  is  a  relative  matter.  It  cannot 
be derived from the verbal noun, which is an actual or existent matter. The 
inﬁnitive is our acquisition; so we are called the murderer. The verbal noun 
is Almighty Allah’s creature. Something which gives an inkling of respon-
sibility cannot be derived from the verbal noun.

The Seventh

The Seventh: For sure, man’s faculty of will and power of choice are 
weak  and  a  theoretical  matter,  but  Almighty  Allah,  the  Absolutely  Wise 
One, made that weak and partial will a condition for the connection of His 
universal will. He in effect says: “ My servant! Whichever way you wish to 
take with your will, I will take you there. In which case the responsibility is 
yours! ” If the comparison is not mistaken, you lift a powerless child onto 
your  shoulders  and  leaving  the  choice  to  him,  tell  him  you  will  take  him 
wherever he wishes. The child wants to go to a high mountain so you take 
him there, but he either catches cold or falls. So of course you reprimand 
him,  saying,  “ You  wanted  to  go  there, ”  and  you  give  him  a  slap.  Thus, 
Almighty Allah, the Firmest of Judges, makes His servant’s will, which is 
utterly weak, a condition, and His universal will follows it.

TWENTY-SIXTH WORD

527

I n   S h o r t :  O man! You have a will known as the power of choice which 
is extremely weak, but whose hand in evil acts and destruction is extremely 
long and in good deeds is extremely short. Give one of the hands of that will 
of yours to supplication, so that it may reach Paradise, a fruit of the chain 
of good deeds, and stretch to eternal happiness. And give its other hand to 
the seeking of forgiveness, so that it may be short for evil deeds and will not 
reach the Zakkum tree of Hell, which is one fruit of that accursed tree. That 
is, just as supplication and reliance on Allah greatly strengthen the inclina-
tion to do good, so repentance and the seeking of forgiveness cut the inclina-
tion to do evil, putting an end to its transgressions.

Third Topic

THIRD TOPIC

Belief in divine determining is one of the pillars of belief. That is, the 
belief  that  “ everything  is  determined  by  Almighty  Allah. ”  The  certain 
proofs for divine determining are so numerous they cannot be calculated. 
We shall show in an introduction, simply and clearly, how strong and broad 
is this pillar of belief.

Introduction

INTRODUCTION

Numerous verses of the Qur’an, like,

( 6:59 ) Þ Ý Ü Û Ú Ù Ø × 
state  clearly  that  everything  is  written  before  it  comes  into  existence  and 
after it passes from existence. With its creational signs like the order, balance, 
regularity,  adornment,  differentiation,  and  the  giving  of  form,  the  verses, 
the  signs,  of  the  mighty  Qur’an  inscribed  by  divine  power  and  called  the 
universe conﬁrm these statements of the Qur’an. Indeed, the well-ordered 
missives and ﬁnely balanced verses of the book of the universe testify that 
everything  is  written.  The  indication  that  everything  is  determined  and 
written before it comes into existence are all beginnings, seeds, measured 
proportions, and forms; each of these testiﬁes to this. For seeds and grains 

are subtle containers appearing from the workbench of ( 36:82 ) ² ± in 
each of which is deposited a tiny index traced by divine determining. Divine 
power employs minute particles according to that plan of divine determin-
ing, and constructs the mighty miracles of power on the seeds. That is to 
say, everything that will happen to the tree is as though inscribed in its seed. 
For in regard to their substance seeds are simple and similar to one another; 
materially they are nothing.

528

THE WORDS

Furthermore, the well-measured proportions of everything clearly show 
divine  determining.  Yes,  whatever  living  creature  is  considered,  it  seems 
its form and measure emerged from a wisely and skilfully wrought mould. 
For it to receive such a measure, form, and shape, either there has to be a 
truly  wondrous  and  inﬁnitely  intricate  physical  mould,  or  else  pre-eternal 
power cuts out the form and shape according to a well-proportioned imma-
terial mould that exists in knowledge and comes from divine determining, 
and it clothes it in it. For example, look carefully at this tree or that animal, 
you will see that the particles, which are lifeless, deaf, blind, unconscious, 
and similar to one another, are in motion in its growth and development. In 
some of the being’s intricate extremities the particles halt, as though seeing, 
knowing and recognizing the place of fruits and beneﬁts. Then in  another 
place they change their direction as though following some important aim. 
This means they are in motion in accordance with the immaterial measured 
proportions of the tree or animal, which come from divine determining and 
are governed by those proportions. 

Since  there  are  the  manifestations  of  divine  determining  to  this  extent 
in  physical  and  visible  things,  certainly  the  forms  with  which  things  are 
clothed with the passing of time and the states acquired through the motions 
they perform will also be dependent on the ordering of divine determining. 
Present in a seed are two manifestations of divine determining; one is evi-
dent and points to the Clear Book, which is a title of will and the creational 
commands; the other is theoretical and points to the Clear Record, which is a 
title of divine knowledge and the divine command. Evident divine determin-
ing speciﬁes the physical nature, states, and parts of the tree which the seed 
comprises. While theoretical divine determining speciﬁes the stages, states, 
forms, motions, and gloriﬁcations which the tree will undergo and perform 
over  the  period  of  its  life,  and  which  are  in  the  seed  and  will  be  created 
from it; these stages, states, forms, and acts, which constantly change and 
are called its life history, each have a regulated measure in accordance with 
divine determining, the same as the tree’s branches and leaves. 

Since there is such a manifestation of divine determining in the common-
est and simplest of things, it surely demonstrates that all things are written 
before they come into existence; this may be understood with little attention. 
Now, evidence for the fact that the story of everything’s life is written after 
its existence are all fruits, which in this world tell of the Clear Book and 
the Clear Record, and the faculty of memory in man, which points to the 
Preserved Tablet; these all hint and testify to this fact. Indeed, the appointed 

TWENTY-SIXTH WORD

529

events of a tree’s life are written in its seeds, which are like the hearts of its 
fruits. And man’s life history together with some of the past events of the 
world are written in his memory in such a way that, as though copying out 
with the hand of power and pen of divine determining in a faculty as tiny as 
a mustard seed a small note from the page of his actions, the memory gives 
the note to man’s hand and puts it in the pocket of his mind, so that with it 
he will call his actions to mind at the time of reckoning. So too, due to it he 
may be conﬁdent that within the upheavals of transience and death there are 
numerous lasting mirrors in which the All-Powerful and Wise One depicts 
and makes permanent the identities of transient beings; and truly numerous 
tablets which shall endure for all eternity on which that All-Knowing Pre-
server inscribes the meanings of transitory beings.

I n   S h o r t :  Since plant life, the simplest and lowest level of life, is depend-
ent to this extent on the ordering of divine determining, certainly human life, 
the highest level of life, has been drawn in all in its details according to the 
scale and measuring of divine determining and is inscribed by its pen. Yes, 
just as raindrops tell of clouds, and drops of water point to the existence of 
a water-source, and notes and portfolios to the existence of a large ledger, 
so too, the evident divine determining which we observe and which is the 
physical  order  in  living  beings  indicates  the  notebook  of  divine  will  and 
creational commands known as the Clear Book. Similarly, their fruits, seeds, 
grains, forms, and shapes, which are like the droplets, notes, and portfolios 
of theoretical divine determining, which is the non-physical order and per-
tains to life, indicates the Preserved Tablet, one ofﬁce of divine knowledge, 
which is called the Clear Record.

To Conclude

T o   C o n c l u d e :  We see clearly that at the time of their growth and devel-
opment the particles of living beings travel to their intricate extremities and 
halt, then they change their path. At each of the extremities they produce 
the fruits of beneﬁts, uses, and instances of wisdom. Clearly, the forms of 
those things and their measures are drawn with a pen of determining. Thus, 
observable, evident determining shows that in the non-physical states of liv-
ing beings also are well-ordered, fruitful extremities and limits drawn with 
the pen of determining. Divine power is the source, divine determining is 
the  pattern.  Power  writes  the  meaningful  book  on  that  pattern.  Since  we 
understand  clearly  that  the  fruitful  limits  and  purposeful  extremities  have 
been drawn with the pen of divine determining, physical and non-physical, 
certainly the states and stages which all living beings undergo in the course 
of  their  lives  are  also  drawn  with  that  pen.  For  their  life  stories  follow  a 

530

THE WORDS

course with order and balance; they change forms and receive shapes. Since 
the pen of divine determining thus rules in all living beings, surely the life 
history of man, the world’s most perfect fruit and vicegerent of the earth and 
bearer of the Supreme Trust, is more than anything dependent on the law of 
divine determining.

I f   y o u   a s k :  “ Divine determining has bound us like this. It has negated 
our freedom. Isn’t belief in it a burden and irksome for the heart and spirit, 
which yearn for expansion and to roam freely? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :   Absolutely  not!  It  is  not  burdensome;  it  rather  affords  a 
luminosity and joy producing a lightness, ease, and spirit, and ensuring con-
ﬁdence and security. For if man does not believe in divine determining, he 
is  compelled  to  bear  a  burden  as  heavy  as  the  world  on  the  shoulders  of 
his spirit within a constricted space, which allows him only an insigniﬁcant 
independence and temporary freedom. For man is connected with the  whole 
universe.  He  has  inﬁnite  aims  and  desires.  But  since  his  power,  will,  and 
freedom are insufﬁcient to meet a millionth of these, it may be understood 
how awesome is the burden of the distress he bears. Thus, belief in divine 
determining throws that burden in its entirety onto the ship of divine deter-
mining, allowing him to roam free within its perfections with perfect ease 
and perfect freedom of spirit and heart. It only negates the petty freedom of 
the evil-commanding soul and smashes its Pharaoh-like tyranny and lord-
ship, and its acting as it wishes. Belief in divine determining produces such 
pleasure and happiness it is beyond description. We shall only allude to it 
with the following comparison.

Two men travelled to the seat of government of a king and there entered 
his private palace, a place of rare wonders. One of them did not recognize 
the king and laying hands on everything and stealing them, wanted to set-
tle there. However, he experienced certain difﬁculties, for he had to man-
age  the  palace  and  its  park,  oversee  its  revenues,  work  its  machines,  and 
feed  its  strange  animals;  he  suffered  constant  distress.  The  paradise-like 
park became hell for him. He pitied everything. He could not govern them. 
He  passed  his  time  regretfully.  Then  this  thieving,  unmannerly  man  was 
cast into prison as a punishment. The second man recognized the king and 
knew himself to be his guest. He believed that all the matters in the park 
and palace occurred through the regulation of the law, and that everything 
functioned with perfect ease in accordance with a programme. Leaving the 
difﬁculties to the king’s law, he beneﬁted with complete enjoyment from all 
the pleasures of that Paradise-like garden, and relying on the king’s mercy

able and passed his life in perfect pleasure and happiness. He understood the 
meaning of the saying: ِرَدﯬﯧْ(cid:170)ا  َنِ(cid:174)  َنِ(cid:174)َا ِرَدَ(cid:163)ْ(cid:170)اِ(cid:92)  َنَ(cid:174)ٰا  ْنَ(cid:174) 1
FOURTH TOPIC

Fourth Topic

I f   y o u   s a y :  “ In the First Topic you proved that everything about divine 
determining is good and beautiful. Even the evil that comes from it is good, 
and the ugliness, beautiful. But the disasters and tribulations in this world 
refute that statement. ”

T h e  A n s w e r :  O my soul and my friend who feel severe pain out of intense 
compassion!  The  facts  that  all  virtues  and  perfections  return  to  existence 
and that the basis of all rebellion, calamities, and defects is non-existence 
are  proof  that  existence  is  pure  good  and  non-existence,  pure  evil.  Since 
non-existence is pure evil, circumstances that either result in non-existence 
or  give  an  inkling  of  it,  also  comprise  evil.  Therefore,  life,  the  most  bril-
liant light of existence, proceeds through different circumstances and ﬁnds 
strength; it encounters varying situations and is puriﬁed; it takes on numer-
ous qualities and produces the desired results, and enters many stages and 
displays comprehensively the impresses of the Bestower of Life’s names. It 
is due to this fact that certain things happen to living creatures in the form of 
griefs, calamities, difﬁculties, and tribulations whereby the lights of exist-
ence  are  renewed  in  their  lives,  and  the  darkness  of  non-existence  draws 
distant and their lives are puriﬁed. For arrest, repose, silence, idleness, rest, 
and monotony are all, both in quality and as conditions, non-existence. Even 
the greatest pleasure is reduced to nothing by monotony.

I n   S h o r t :  Since life displays the impresses of the most beautiful names, 
everything that happens to it is good. For example, an extremely rich and 
inﬁnitely skilful person who is proﬁcient in many crafts, for an hour and in 
return  for  a  wage,  clothes  a  miserable  wretch  in  a  bejewelled,  artistically 
fashioned garment. This garment he made in order to make the miserable 
man  act  as  a  model  and  to  display  the  works  of  his  art  and  his  extensive 
wealth. He works the garment on the man, gives it various forms, and alters 
it.  In  order  to  display  every  variety  of  his  art,  he  cuts  it,  changes  it,  and 
lengthens and shortens it. Can the poor man receiving the wage be justiﬁed if 
he says to the person: “ You are giving me trouble. You are making me bow

down and stand up. By cutting and shortening this garment which makes me 
more beautiful, you are spoiling my beauty ”? Does he have the right to tell 
him: “ You are acting unkindly and unfairly ”? Thus, like him, in order to 
display the impresses of His most beautiful names, the All-Glorious Maker, 
the Peerless Creator, alters within numerous circumstances the garment of 
existence He clothes on living creatures, bejewelled with such senses and 
subtle faculties as eyes, ears, the reason, and the heart. He changes it within 
very many situations. Among these are circumstances in the form of suffer-
ing and calamity which show the meanings of some of His names, and the 
rays of mercy within ﬂashes of wisdom, and the subtle instances of beauty 
within those rays of mercy.

Conclusion

Conclusion

[ Five paragraphs which silenced the Old Said’s rebellious, proud, vain, 
conceited, and hypocritical soul, and compelled it to submit. ]

First Paragraph

FIRST PARAGRAPH: Since things exist and they are full of art, they 
surely have a maker. As is decisively proved in the Twenty-Second Word, 
if everything is not one person’s, then each thing becomes as difﬁcult and 
problematical as all things. Since someone made the earth and the heavens 
and created them, for sure that most wise and skilful Being would not leave 
to others living beings, which are the fruits, results, and aims of the heavens 
and the earth, and so spoil his work. Making it futile and without purpose, 
He would not hand over all His wise works to others; He would not give 
their thanks and worship to others.

Second Paragraph

SECOND PARAGRAPH: O my conceited soul! You resemble a grape-
vine. Don’t be proud! The vine itself did not attach the bunches of grapes; 
someone else attached them.

Fourth Paragraph

FOURTH PARAGRAPH: If you want knowledge of reality and true 
wisdom, gain knowledge of Almighty Allah. For the realities of beings are 
rays of the divine name of Truth and the manifestations of His names and 
attributes. The reality of all things, whether physical, non-physical, essen-
tial, non-essential, and the reality of all human beings, is based on a name 
and relies on its reality. Things are not merely insigniﬁcant forms without 
reality. There is a brief discussion of this mystery at the end of the Twentieth 
Word. O my soul! If you long for the life of this world and ﬂee death, know 
certainly that the conditions you suppose to be life are only the  minute in 
which you are. All the time previous to the present minute and the things of 
the world within that time are dead in the present minute. And all the time 
subsequent to the present minute and all it contains are non-existent in it, 
and nothing. This means that the physical life on which you rely is only a 
minute. Some of the learned, even, said it was a tenth of a minute, rather, 
the passing instant. It is due to this mystery that some saints stated that this 
world is non-existent in respect of this world. Since it is thus, give up the 
physical life of the soul; rise to the level of life of the heart, spirit, and inner 
faculties; see the broad sphere of life they enjoy. For them, the past and the 
future, which for you are dead, are living; they are existent and full of life. O 
my soul! Weep like my heart, and cry out and say:
I   a m   e p h e m e r a l ;   I   w a n t   n o   o t h e r   w h o   i s   t h u s ;

Addendum 

(cid:2)(cid:3)

[ This short Addendum has great importance; it is beneﬁcial for everyone. ]

The ways leading to Almighty Allah are truly numerous. While all true 
ways are taken from the Qur’an, some are shorter, safer, and more general 
than others. One of these is the way of impotence, poverty, compassion, and 
reﬂection, from which, with my defective understanding, I have beneﬁted.

Indeed, like ecstatic love, impotence is a path which, by way of worship, 
leads to winning Allah’s love; but it is safer. Poverty too leads to the divine 
name of All-Merciful. And, like ecstatic love, compassion leads to the name 
of All-Compassionate, but is a swifter and broader path. Also like ecstatic 
love, reﬂection leads to the name of All-Wise, but it is a richer, broader, and 
more  brilliant  path.  This  path  consists  not  of  ten  steps  like  the  ten  subtle 
faculties of some of the Suﬁ orders ( t a r i k a t  ) employing silent recollection, 
nor of seven stages like the seven souls of those practising public recitation, 
but of four steps. It is reality ( h a k i k a t  ), rather than a t a r i k a t . It is Shari‘a.

However, let it not be misunderstood. It means to see one’s impotence, 
poverty and faults before Almighty Allah, not to fabricate them or display 
them to people. The method of this short path is to follow the practices of 
the Prophet ( UWBP ), perform the religious obligations and give up serious 
sins.  And  it  is  especially  to  perform  the  prescribed  prayers  correctly  and 
with attention, and following them to say the tesbihat.

The verse,   ( 53:32 ) « ª © points to the ﬁrst step.
The verse, ( 59:19 ) H G F E D C B A points to the sec-

ond step.

The verse,  ( 4:79 ) ã â á à ß Þ  Ü Û Ú Ù Ø × points 

to the third step.

The verse, ( 28:88 ) j i h g f   points to the fourth step.
A brief explanation of these four steps is as follows:

535

536

First Step

THE WORDS

THE FIRST STEP: As the verse, « ª © suggests, it is to not 
purify  the  soul.  For  on  account  of  his  nature  and  innate  disposition,  man 
loves himself. Indeed, he loves himself before anything else, and only him-
self. He sacriﬁces everything other than himself to his own soul. He praises 
himself in a manner beﬁtting some object of worship. He absolves and exon-
erates himself from faults in the same way. As far as he possibly can, he does 
not see faults as being appropriate for him, and does not accept them. He 
defends himself passionately as though worshipping himself. Even, using on 
himself the members and faculties given him as part of his nature in order 
to praise and glorify the True Object of Worship, he displays the meaning 
of the verse,  ( 25:43 ) Ä Ã Â Á   He considers himself, he relies on 
himself, he fancies himself. Thus, his puriﬁcation and cleansing at this stage, 
in this step, is to not purify himself; it is not to absolve himself.

Second Step

SECOND  STEP:  As  the  verse, G F E D C B A  
teaches, man is oblivious of himself and is not aware of himself. If he thinks 
of  death,  it  is  in  relation  to  others.  If  he  sees  transience  and  decline,  he 
does not attribute them to himself. His evil-commanding soul demands that 
when it comes to inconvenience and service of others, he forgets himself, 
but when it comes to receiving his recompense and to beneﬁts and enjoy-
ment, he thinks of himself and takes his own part fervently. His puriﬁcation, 
cleansing, and training at this stage is the reverse of this state. That is to say, 
when oblivious of himself, it is not to be oblivious. That is, to forget himself 
when it comes to pleasure and ambition and greed, and to think of himself 
when it comes to death and service of others.

Third Step

THE THIRD STEP: As the verse, 

ã â á à ß Þ Ý Ü Û Ú Ù Ø ×  teaches,  the  nature  of  the 
evil-commanding  soul  demands  that  it  always  considers  goodness  to  be 
from  itself  and  becomes  vain  and  conceited.  Thus,  in  this  Step,  a  person 
sees only faults, defects, impotence, and poverty in himself, and understands 
that all his good qualities and perfections are bounties bestowed on him by 
the All-Glorious Creator. He gives thanks instead of being conceited, and 
offers  praise  instead  of  boasting.  According  to  the  meaning  of  the  verse,  
( 91:9 ) C B A @  his puriﬁcation at this stage is to know his perfection 
to lie in imperfection, his power in impotence, and his wealth in poverty.

Fourth Step

TWENTY-SIXTH WORD – ADDENDUM

537

THE FOURTH STEP: As the verse, j i h g f  teaches, 
the evil-commanding soul considers itself to be free and independent and to 
exist of itself. Because of this, man claims he possesses a sort of dominical-
ity. He harbours a hostile rebelliousness towards his True Object of Wor-
ship. Thus, through understanding the following fact, he is saved from this. 
The fact is this:

According to the apparent meaning of things, which looks to each thing 
itself, everything is transitory, lacking, accidental, non-existent. But accord-
ing to the meaning that signiﬁes something other than itself and in respect 
of each thing being a mirror to the All-Glorious Maker’s names and charged 
with various duties, each is a witness, it is witnessed, and it is existent. The 
puriﬁcation and cleansing of a person at this stage is as follows:

In his existence he is non-existent, and in his non-existence he has exist-
ence. That is to say, if he values himself and attributes existence to himself, 
he is in a darkness of non-existence as great as the universe. That is, if he 
relies  on  his  individual  existence  and  is  unmindful  of  the  True  Giver  of 
Existence, he has an individual light of existence like that of a ﬁreﬂy and is 
submerged in the endless darkness of non-existence and separation. But if 
he gives up egotism and sees that he is a mirror of the manifestations of the 
True Giver of Existence, he gains all beings and an inﬁnite existence. For he 
who ﬁnds the Necessary Existent One, the manifestation of Whose names all 
beings manifest, ﬁnds everything.

Conclusion

Conclusion
The  four  steps  in  this  way  of  impotence,  poverty,  compassion,  and 
reﬂection  have  been  explained  in  the  twenty-six  Words  so  far  written, 
which are concerned with knowledge of reality, the reality of the Shari‘a, 
and the wisdom of the Qur’an. So here we shall allude brieﬂy to only one or 
two points, as follows:

Indeed,  this  path  is  shorter,  because  it  consists  of  four  steps.  When 
impotence removes the hand from the soul, it gives it directly to the All-
Powerful One of Glory. Whereas, when the way of ecstatic love, the swift-
est way, removes the hand from the soul, it attaches it to the metaphorical 
beloved. Only after the beloved is found to be impermanent does it go to 
the True Beloved.

Also, this path is much safer, because the ravings and high-ﬂown claims 
of  the  soul  are  not  present  on  it.  For,  apart  from  impotence,  poverty,  and 
defect, the soul possesses nothing so that it oversteps its mark.

538

THE WORDS

Also,  this  path  is  much  broader  and  more  universal.  For,  in  order  to 
attain  to  a  constant  awareness  of  Allah’s  presence,  a  person  is  not  com-
pelled  to  imagine  the  universe  to  be  condemned  to  non-existence  and  to 
declare: “ There is no existent but He, ” like those who believe in the unity 
of existence, nor to suppose the universe to be condemned to imprisonment 
in absolute oblivion and to say, “ There is nothing witnessed but He, ” like 
those who believe in the unity of witnessing. Rather, since the Qur’an has 
most  explicitly  pardoned  the  universe  and  released  it  from  execution  and 
imprisonment, the person on this path disregards the above, and dismissing 
beings from working on their own account and employing them on account 
of the All-Glorious Creator, and in the duty of manifesting the most beauti-
ful names and being mirrors to them, he considers them from the point of 
view of signifying something other than themselves; and being saved from 
absolute heedlessness he enters the divine presence permanently; he ﬁnds a 
way leading to Almighty Allah in everything.

I n   S h o r t :  Dismissing beings from working on account of other beings, 

this way is to not look at them as signifying themselves.

The Twenty-Seventh Word 

Treatise on Independent Judgements
of the Law ( I j t i h a d  ) 

[ Five or six years ago in an Arabic treatise, I wrote concerning a matter 
to do with independent judgements on points of the Shari‘a. Now, at the 
request of two of my brothers, this Word was written about that matter 
in order to put in his place a person who had overstepped the mark in 
his attacks on it. ]

(cid:2)(cid:3)

( 4:83 ) o n m l k j i h g f e d 
The door of independent judgements on the law is open, but at the present 

time there are six obstacles to entering it.

THE FIRST: In winter when the storms are ﬁerce even small holes are 
blocked up and it is in no way reasonable to open up new doors. When under 
the onslaught of a mighty ﬂood, to make openings in the wall in order to 
repair it will only cause one to be engulfed. In just the same way, at this time 
of denial and the assault of the customs of Europe and the legion of innova-
tions and the destruction of misguidance, to open up new doors in the citadel 
of Islam in the name of i j t i h a d , and make openings that will allow those bent 
on destruction to scale the walls and enter, is a crime against Islam.

THE  SECOND:  Independent  judgements  may  not  be  made  about  the 
essential teachings of religion, for they are speciﬁed and deﬁnite. Moreover, 
they are like basic food and sustenance. Although at this time all effort and 
endeavour should be expended on their being upheld and revitalized, they 
are being abandoned and degraded. So to give them up, despite their being 
among the theoretical matters of Islam and are not inadequate for the needs

of all times since they are the pure and sincere interpretations of the  ﬁrst 
generations of Islam, and to make new interpretations of the law in arbitrary 
fashion, is an innovation and betrayal of Islam.

THE  THIRD:  Just  as  varying  goods  in  the  market  are  sought  after 
according to the season; they are in demand one after the other, so in the 
exhibition of the world and market of human society and civilization, every 
century  different  goods  are  sought  after  and  are  in  demand;  they  are  dis-
played in the market, demand attracts them, gazes are turned on them, minds 
are drawn by them. Like at the present time the goods of politics and secur-
ing the life of this world and the demand for philosophy are sought after, for 
example. While at the time of the ﬁrst generations of Islam and in the market 
of  that  age,  the  most  sought-after  goods  were  deducing  the  wishes  of  the 
Creator of the Heavens and the Earth from His Word and what He wants of 
us, and obtaining the means of winning through the light of prophethood and 
the Qur’an eternal happiness in the world of the hereafter, which had been 
revealed to such a degree it could not be concealed.

At that time, people’s minds, hearts and spirits were directed with all their 
strength towards understanding the wishes of the Sustainer of the Heavens 
and the Earth, so it was to those wishes that the discussions, conversations, 
events, and circumstances of social life all looked. Since they were held and 
occurred accordingly, whoever had high ability, his heart and nature uncon-
sciously  received  instruction  in  knowledge  of  Allah  from  everything.  He 
received knowledge from the circumstances, events, and discussions which 
took place at that time. As though everything became a teacher for such a 
person, and inculcated in his nature and disposition the preparatory knowl-
edge for independent judgements. That natural instruction illuminated him 
to such a degree that he was almost capable of interpreting the law with-
out  acquiring  the  knowledge,  to  be  illuminated  without  ﬁre.  Thus,  when 
someone capable who received such natural instruction in this way began to 
work at interpreting the law, his by then match-like capacity manifested the 
mystery of L i g h t   u p o n   L i g h t ; he became qualiﬁed to interpret it ( m u j t a h i d  ) 
swiftly and in a brief time.

At  this  time,  however,  due  to  the  domination  of  European  civilization 
and the supremacy of natural philosophy and the preponderance of the con-
ditions of worldly life, minds and hearts have become scattered, and endeav-
our and favour divided. Minds have become strangers to non-material mat-
ters. It is because of this that if someone now was to memorize the Qur’an 
at the age of four and have the intelligence of a  m u j t a h i d  like Sufyan ibn 

TWENTY-SEVENTH WORD

Uyayna,  who  held  discussions  with  religious  scholars  at  an  early  age,  he 
would need ten times longer than Sufyan to become qualiﬁed to  interpret the 
law. If Sufyan acquired the learning in ten years, this man would need one 
hundred years. For the period of Sufyan’s natural study began at the age of 
reason. His disposition and abilities were slowly prepared and illuminated; 
they took lessons from everything and became like a match. But his coun-
terpart  at  the  present  time,  since  his  thought  is  submerged  in  philosophy, 
his mind plunged in politics, and his heart is giddy at the life of this world, 
his  disposition  and  abilities  have  grown  distant  from  interpretation  of  the 
law. For sure, they have become distant from interpretation of the Shari‘a to 
the degree they have been preoccupied with the modern sciences, and have 
remained backward in regard to it to the extent he has become learned in the 
physical sciences. Therefore, he may not say: “ I am as intelligent as he was; 
why can’t I be on a par with him? ” He does not have the right to say this and 
he cannot be on the same level as him.

THE FOURTH: The inclination to expand is present within a body for 
its growth and development. And, since it is from within, the inclination to 
expand leads to the perfection of the body. Whereas if it were from outside 
it, it would rip the body’s skin; it would destroy it; it would not expand it. In 
the same way, when the inclination to expand and will to interpret the law 
were present in those people who were within the sphere of Islam by way of 
the door of perfect taqwa and the path of conforming to the essential teach-
ings of Islam, like the righteous early generations, it was a perfection and 
a being perfected. But if such an inclination and desire are present in those 
who give up the essentials, prefer the life of this world to that of the hereaf-
ter, and are tainted with materialist philosophy, it is instrumental in destroy-
ing the body of Islam and casting off the chain of the Shari‘a from the neck.
THE FIFTH: Three points of view make interpretation of the law earthly 
at this time, and prevent it being heavenly. Whereas the Shari‘a is heavenly, 
revealed, and since interpretations of it disclose its hidden ordinances, they 
also are heavenly.

The First

T h e   F i r s t :  The wisdom in an ordinance is one thing, while the reason for 
it is something different. Wisdom and beneﬁt are the cause of its choice, not 
the means of its being necessitated and created. While the reason for it is the 
means for its existence. For example, the obligatory prayers are shortened 
while travelling; two r a k ’ a t s  are performed. The reason for this permission 
of the Shari‘a is the journey, while its wisdom is the hardship. If there is a 
journey but no hardship, the prayers are still shortened. For the reason exists. 

542

THE WORDS

But if there is no journey yet hardship, this may not  be a reason for shorten-
ing the prayers. Thus, in opposition to this fact, the prevailing view at the 
present time is to advance the beneﬁt and wisdom in place of the reason, 
and to make the judgement in accordance with that. Such an interpretation is 
most deﬁnitely earthly, not heavenly.

The Second

T h e   S e c o n d :  At the present time eyes are ﬁxed primarily on worldly 
happiness, whereas the Shari‘a looks primarily to happiness in the hereaf-
ter, and to happiness in this world in second place and indirectly as leading 
to that of the hereafter. That is to say, the prevailing attitude at this time is 
alien to the spirit of the Shari‘a; in which case, it may not make interpreta-
tions in its name.

The Third

ّ(cid:139)(cid:170)ا  َ

T h e   T h i r d :   There  is  a  rule: 

ِتاَروُ(cid:147)ْ(cid:111) َ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)ا  ُح(cid:193)ِ(cid:93)ُ(cid:98)   ِتاَروُر َ

ّنِا    Necessity 
makes permissible what is forbidden. 1 This rule is not universal; necessity 
makes licit what is forbidden as long as it is not by way of what is forbidden. 
But if something has become a necessity due to abuse and for illicit reasons, 
this necessity may not be the basis of ordinances permitting it, nor form an 
excuse. For example, if, through misuse of his will someone makes himself 
drunk in an unlawful way, according to scholars of the Shari‘a, his actions 
act against him and he may not be deemed excused. If he divorces his wife, 
the divorce is in force. And if he commits a crime, he receives the punish-
ment. But if it is not due to misuse of his will, the divorce is not in force, 
nor does he receive punishment. And, for example, even if an alcoholic is 
addicted to alcohol to the degree of necessity, he may not say: “ It is a neces-
sity, and lawful for me. ”

Thus, at this time there are many matters which have reached the degree 
of necessity and have taken on the form of a general calamity afﬂicting peo-
ple,  and  which,  since  they  have  arisen  from  ill  choice,  illicit  desires,  and 
forbidden acts, may not be the basis of rulings permitting them and mak-
ing  what  is  unlawful  lawful.  However,  since  those  who  make  interpreta-
tions at the present time make those necessities the basis of legal rulings, 
their  interpretations  are  earthly,  the  products  of  their  own  fancies,  tainted 
by  philosophy,  and  cannot  be  heavenly  or  revealed,  or  conformable  with 
the Shari‘a. For if exercise of authority concerning the divine ordinances of 
the Creator of the Heavens and the Earth and interference in His servants’ 
worship is without the Creator’s permission, such exercise and interference 
are rejected. An example is some of the heedless and neglectful approving

changes in such marks of Islam as the Friday Sermon, and substituting the 
language of each country for Arabic. Two reasons are given:

The First: “ So that the mass of Muslims will understand current  poli-
tics. ” But current politics has become so intermixed with lies and trickery 
and evil that it has come to resemble the very whisperings of Satan. How-
ever, the pulpit is the seat of delivering divine revelation; political gossip 
does not have the right to rise to that high position.

The Second: “ The purpose of the Friday Sermon is that the admoni-
tions of certain Qur’anic suras should be understood. ” Yes, if the major-
ity of the Islamic nation conformed to the essential teachings and incon-
testable matters of Islam and the ordinances which are well-known, and 
they carried them out, it might have been desirable for the Sermon to be 
given in a known language and for the Qur’an to be translated, 1 if it were 
possible, so that the theoretical matters of the Shari‘a and its subtle mat-
ters and abstruse teachings might be understood. But Islam’s well-known, 
incontrovertible ordinances such as the ﬁve daily prayers, fasting in Ram-
adan,  and  z a k a t ,  and  the  unlawfulness  of  murder,  fornication,  and  wine 
are  neglected.  The  ordinary  people  do  not  need  to  learn  their  necessity 
or  unlawfulness;  they  need  through  encouragement  and  warning,  to  be 
reminded of those sacred decrees, and, by their sense of belief and feelings 
for Islam being stirred, to be prompted, encouraged, and reminded to con-
form to them. However lowly and ignorant they may be, they understand 
the  following  brief  meaning  from  the  Qur’an  and  Arabic  Sermon:  “ The 
preacher and the reciter of the Qur’an are recalling the pillars of belief and 
Islam, which are known by me and everyone, and teaching us, and reciting 
them. ” A longing for them is born in their hearts. What words are there 
in  the  universe  which  can  be  compared  with  the  miraculous,  instructive 
reminders, warnings, and encouragement of the All-Wise Qur’an, which 
comes from the sublime throne?

THE SIXTH: Since the great interpreters of the law among the right-
eous early generations of Islam lived close to the time of the Companions 
of the Prophet ( UWBP ), the age of light and age of truth, they were able 
to receive a pure light and make pure interpretations. But the interpreters 
of the law at this time look at the book of reality from behind so many veils 
and from such a long distance it is only with difﬁculty that they can see 
even its clearest letters.

a true translation of the Qur’an is not possible. (Author)

THE WORDS

I f   y o u   s a y :  The Companions also were human and not free of error and 
differences, but interpretation of the law and the ordinances of the Shari‘a 
depend on their justice and truthfulness, on which the Islamic community  
have  agreed,  saying:  “ All  the  Companions  were  just  and  all  spoke  the 
truth. ” 1

T h e   A n s w e r :   Yes,  the  absolute  majority  of  the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP ) 
Companions were lovers of the truth, truthfulness, and justice. For in that 
era, the ugliness of lies and falsehood was shown in all its ugliness and 
the  beauty  of  right  and  truthfulness  was  shown  in  all  its  beauty  in  such 
a  way  that  the  distance  between  them  stretched  from  the  ground  to  the 
divine throne. They were clearly separated, from the depths of Musaylima 
the Liar at the lowest of the low to the utmost truthfulness of the Prophet 
Muhammad  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  at  the  highest  of  the 
high.  Indeed,  just  as  it  was  lying  that  brought  Musaylima  to  the  lowest 
of the low, so it was truthfulness and right which raised Muhammad the 
Trustworthy to the highest of the high.

Thus,  the  Companions,  who  had  elevated  sentiments  and  worshipped 
good morals and were illuminated with the light of the Sun of Prophethood’s 
conversation, did not stretch out their hands to the buffoonery and ﬁlth of 
the lying in Musaylima’s shop, which was so ugly and the cause of descent, 
and they shrank from unbelief. So too they shrank from lying, the compan-
ion of unbelief, and sought as far as they were able – especially in relating 
the ordinances of the Shari‘a and propagating them – truth, truthfulness, and 
right, which are so ﬁne and the cause of pride and glory, ascent and progress, 
and  were  the  thing  most  in  demand  from  the  Glory  of  Messengership’s 
( UWBP )  elevated  treasury,  and  which  illuminate  human  social  life  with 
their beauteous splendour; the Companions acted in conformity with them 
and were desirous of them; this is certain, deﬁnite, and necessary. Whereas 
at this time, the distance between truth and lying has become so narrow that 
they are now quite simply shoulder to shoulder. It is extremely easy to pass 
from truthfulness to lying. Lying is even preferred to truthfulness due to the 
propaganda of politics and diplomacy. And so, if the most ugly and the ﬁn-
est things are sold in the same shop for the same price, certainly the jewel 
of truthfulness and right, which is elevated and penetrates to the essence of 
reality, will not be obtained blindly, relying on the word and competence of 
the shopkeeper.

TWENTY-SEVENTH WORD – CONCLUSION

Conclusion 
Sacred laws change according to the ages. Indeed, in one era different 
prophets  may  come,  and  they  have  come.  Since  subsequently  to  the  Seal 
of  the  Prophets  ( UWBP ),  his  Greater  Shari‘a  is  sufﬁcient  for  all  peoples 
in every age, no need has remained for different laws. However, in second-
ary  matters,  the  need  for  different  schools  has  persisted  to  a  degree.  Just 
as  clothes  change  with  the  change  of  the  seasons  and  medicines  change 
according to dispositions, so sacred laws change according to the ages, and 
their ordinances change according to the capacities of peoples. Because the 
secondary matters of the ordinances of the Shari‘a look to human circum-
stances; they come according to them, and are remedial.

At the time of the early prophets, since social classes were far apart and 
men’s characters were both somewhat coarse and violent, and their minds, 
primitive and close to nomadism, the laws at that time came all in differ-
ent forms, appropriate to their conditions. There were even different proph-
ets  and  laws  in  the  same  continent  in  the  same  century.  Then,  since  with 
the coming of the Prophet of the End of Time ( UWBP ), human beings as 
though  advanced  from  the  primary  to  the  secondary  stage,  and  undergo-
ing numerous revolutions and upheavals reached a position at which all the 
human peoples could receive a single lesson and listen to a single teacher 
and act in accordance with a single law, no need remained for different laws, 
nor was there necessity for different teachers. But the schools of law mul-
tiplied because they were not all at completely the same level and did not 
proceed in the same sort of social life. If, like students of a school of higher 
education, the vast majority of humankind were clothed in the same sort of 
social life and attained the same level, then all the schools could be united. 
But just as the state of the world does not permit that, so the schools of law 
cannot be the same.

I f   y o u   s a y :  The truth is one; how can the different ordinances of the four 

and twelve schools all be true?

T h e   A n s w e r :  The same water governs in ﬁve different ways in ﬁve ill 
people of different disposition, thus: for one, the water is a cure for his ill-
ness and medically necessary. For another, it is as harmful as poison for his 
sickness  and  medically  prohibited.  For  another,  it  causes  a  small  amount 
of harm and is reprehensible medically. For another the water is beneﬁcial 
and without harm; according to medicine that is Sunna for him. And for yet 

546

THE WORDS

another it is neither harmful nor beneﬁcial; he can drink it with good health  
and for him it is medically permissible. Thus, here the truth has multiplied; 
all ﬁve are true. Are you able to say: “ The water is only a cure, only neces-
sary, and it governs in no other way? ”

Similarly,  impelled  by  divine  wisdom,  the  divine  ordinances  change 
according to the schools of law and those who follow them, and they change 
as truth, and all are true and right. For example, in accordance with divine 
wisdom  and  determining,  the  majority  of  those  who  follow  Imam  Shaﬁ‘i 
are  closer  to  village  life  and  nomadism  than  the  Hanaﬁs,  and  are  lacking 
in  social  life,  which  makes  the  community  like  a  single  body.  As  a  con-
sequence, each person recites the  F a t i h a  behind the prayer leader so as to 
himself  express  his  pains  at  the  court  of  the  Fulﬁller  of  Needs  and  utter 
his private wishes. And this is absolutely right and pure wisdom. However, 
since most Islamic governments favoured the school of Imam-i A’zam, the 
great majority of those who follow that school are closer to civilization and 
urban life and more ﬁtted for social life. Thus, the community becomes like 
a single individual and one man speaks in the name of all; all afﬁrm him with 
their hearts and bind their hearts to his and his word becomes the word of all; 
according to the Hanaﬁ school, the F a t i h a  is not recited behind the prayer 
leader. And its not being recited is absolutely right and pure wisdom.

And, for example, since the Shari‘a forms a barrier against the assaults of 
nature, it modiﬁes it and trains the evil-commanding soul. Thus, according to 
the Shaﬁ‘i School most of whose followers are villagers, semi-nomadic, and 
occupied in manual labour: “ Ablutions are spoilt by touching a woman; the 
slightest uncleanliness is harmful. ” While according to the Hanaﬁ School, 
since the great majority of it followers have entered social life and become 
‘semi-civilized:’  “ Touching  women  does  not  spoil  the  ablutions;  there  is 
licence for a small amount of uncleanliness. ”

Now we shall consider a manual worker and a gentleman. Due to his craft 
and the manner of his livelihood, a worker is afﬂicted with mixing with and 
being in contact with women who are canonically strangers to him. Since he 
sits at the same hearth as them and is involved with unclean things, nature 
and  his  evil-commanding  soul  ﬁnd  the  ﬁeld  empty  and  may  attack  him. 
Therefore, in order to form a barrier against such attacks, the Shari‘a states 
concerning them: “ Your ablutions will be spoilt; do not touch the women. 
Your  prayers  will  be  invalid;  do  not  be  tainted. ”  A  heavenly  voice  rings 
in his spiritual ears. Whereas, in accordance with social custom and in the 
name of common morality, the gentleman – on condition he is honourable – 

TWENTY-SEVENTH WORD – CONCLUSION

547

is not afﬂicted with being in contact with women who are canonically stran-
gers to him, and in the name of civilized cleanliness, he is not tainted to any 
degree with unclean things. Therefore, in the Hanaﬁ School, the Shari‘a has 
not shown him harshness and censure; it has shown its permissive side and 
lightened it. “ If your hand has been touched, your ablutions are not spoilt. 
If you are ashamed and do not perform the i s t i n j a  in public, there is no harm 
in it. A small amount of uncleanliness is permitted. ” It saves him from scru-
ples. Thus, two drops from the ocean as examples for you. Make analogies 
with them, and if you can, balance them on the scales of the Shari‘a in this 
way, with the balance of Sha‘rani’s M i z a n .

Y o u   A s k :  There are some narrations which say: “ At a time innovations 
are rife, some of the righteous from among the believers and those who fear 
Allah will be equal in virtue to the Companions, or of even greater virtue. ” 
Are these narrations sound? And if so, what is their true meaning?

T h e   A n s w e r :  The Sunnis’ consensus that after the prophets the Compan-
ions were the most virtuous of mankind, 1 is a certain proof that those that are 
sound out of those narrations refer to minor virtues. For a quality considered

to be a minor virtue or particular perfection may be deemed preferable to 
that  which  is  superior  and  in  fact  preferable.  But  in  respect  of  universal, 
general virtues, the Companions cannot be reached; for they are the subject 
of divine praise at the end of Sura al-Fath, and are praised and applauded 
in the Torah, Gospels, and Qur’an. For now, we shall explain three points 
of wisdom concerning this truth which comprise three reasons out of very 
many reasons and instances of wisdom.

First Instance of Wisdom

FIRST  INSTANCE  OF  WISDOM:  The  conversation  of  the  Prophet 
( UWBP ) was such an elixir that a person who experienced it for one minute 
received  lights  of  reality  equivalent  to  years  of  spiritual  journeying.  For 
present in conversation is reﬂection and a being coloured. It is well-known 
that  a  truly  exalted  level  may  be  reached  by  means  of  reﬂection  and  fol-
lowing and imitating, and through the sublime light of prophethood – like 
through  allegiance  to  his  sovereign  and  following  him,  a  sultan’s  servant 
may  rise  to  a  position  so  high  a  king  cannot  rise  to  it.  It  is  by  reason  of 
this mystery that the greatest saints cannot reach the level of the Compan-
ions. Even saints like Jalaluddin al-Suyuti, who conversed many times with 
Allah’s Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) while awake, even if they do this and 
are  honoured  in  this  world  with  his  company,  they  still  cannot  reach  the 
Companions. For through the light of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) prophethood, 
the Companions’ conversation was with him as Prophet. While the saints 
saw him ( UWBP ) after his death and conversed with him ( UWBP ) through 
the light of his sainthood. That is to say, the personiﬁcation and appearance 
of Allah’s Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) is in respect of his sainthood, not in 
regard to his prophethood. Since that is so, however much higher the level 
of prophethood is to that of sainthood, one should differentiate between the 
two conversations to that degree.

Just how luminous an elixir was the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) company may 
be  understood  from  the  following:  a  primitive  man  so  hard-hearted  and 
savage  he  buried  his  daughter  alive  would  come  and  be  honoured  with 
the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) conversation for an hour, and would acquire such 
kindness and compassion that he would not step on an ant. And an igno-
rant savage would converse with the Prophet ( UWBP ) for a day, then go 
to lands like China and India and instruct civilized peoples in the realities 
and guide them in perfections.

Second Reason

SECOND  REASON:  As  is  explained  and  proved  in  the  discussion 
about interpretation of the law in the Twenty-Seventh Word, the vast major-
ity  of  the  Companions  were  at  the  highest  level  of  human  perfections. 

550

THE WORDS

For at that time in the mighty revolution of Islam, good and truth appeared 
in  all  their  beauty,  and  evil  and  falsehood,  in  all  their  ugliness,  and  they 
were felt physically. Such a difference was apparent between good and evil 
and such a distance opened up between truth and falsehood that they drew 
as distant from one another as belief is from unbelief, and even Hell is from 
Paradise. The Companions, who by nature possessed elevated emotions and 
were  captivated  by  the  highest  morality  and  inclined  towards  dignity  and 
virtue, would not voluntarily stretch out their hands to evil and falsehood, 
and so  fall to the level of Musaylima the Liar and his ridiculous utterances. 
For the latter was the herald of falsehood, evil, and lies, and their embodi-
ment. The Companions’ characters demanded that they looked to the rank 
of the perfections, those of Allah’s Beloved ( UWBP ) at the highest of the 
high, for he was the herald and embodiment of truthfulness, good, and right, 
and that with all their strength and endeavour they hastened in that way.

For example, it sometimes happens that in the market of human civili-
zation and shop of social life, everyone ﬂees in disgust from the fearsome 
results and ugly consequences of certain things, as from deadly poison, let 
alone buying them, while the beautiful results and valuable consequences of 
other things and of immaterial goods attract the general view and demand 
to themselves like a universal panacea and a sparkling brilliant; everyone 
tries their utmost to buy them. In just the same way, in the Era of Bliss in the 
market of human social life, since goods like lying, evil, and unbelief gave 
rise to such results as everlasting misery and base buffoons like Musaylima 
the Liar, it is certain and clear that the Companions, who were captivated 
by elevated characteristics and love of exalted things, would ﬂee from them 
with loathing as from fatal poison. And of a necessity, the Companions, with 
their  pure  natures  and  praiseworthy  characteristics,  would,  with  all  their 
strength,  emotions,  and  faculties,  be  desirous  of  and  customers  for  truth, 
truthfulness and belief, which yielded the results of eternal happiness and 
luminous fruits such as Allah’s Noble Messenger ( UWBP ), as though for 
the most effective panacea and precious diamond. However, after that time, 
the distance between truthfulness and lying gradually and by degrees dimin-
ished, until now they have become shoulder to shoulder. They have begun to 
be sold together in the same shop, and social morality has become corrupted. 
The propaganda of politics has caused greater demand for lying. At a time 
the awesome ugliness of lying has begun to be concealed and the shining 
beauty of truthfulness has begun not to be apparent, who can attain to the 
strength, constancy, and t a q w a  of the Companions in the matters of justice, 

TWENTY-SEVENTH WORD – ADDENDUM

551

truthfulness,  exaltedness,  and  right,  or  surpass  their  level?  I  shall  explain 
something which occurred to me which will illuminate this to a degree. It 
was like this: 

ْ(cid:202)ا  َيـِ

One time, it occurred to me, why couldn’t wondrous persons like Muhy-
iddin al-‘Arabi attain to the levels of the Companions? Then, while saying, 
ّ(cid:92)َر َناَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126)  during the prayers, the phrase’s meaning was unfolded to 
ىٰ(cid:171)ْ(cid:150)َ
me. Not its complete meaning, but its reality in part became apparent to me. 
I said in my heart: “ If only I could perform one of the ﬁve daily prayers in 
the same way as this phrase; it would be better than a year’s worship. ” After 
the prayers I understood that  that thought and state of mind was guidance 
indicating  that  the  high  degree  of  the  Companions’  worship  could  not  be 
reached. In the mighty social revolution brought about by the lights of the 
Qur’an when opposites were separated from one another, and evils together 
with  all  their  darkness,  details  and  all  who  followed  them,  and  good  and 
perfections together with all their lights and results came face to face – at 
such a stirring time, all gloriﬁcations of Allah and recitations of His names 
expressed all the levels of their meanings freshly and newly and in a pristine 
and unfaded fashion. So too, under the crashing of that mighty revolution all 
the senses and subtle inner faculties of people were awakened, even senses 
like  those  of  fancy  and  imagination,  and  in  an  awakened  and  aware  state 
received  the  numerous  meanings  of  those  recitations  and  gloriﬁcations  in 
accordance with their own perceptions, and absorbed them.

Thus,  due  to  this  wisdom,  when  the  Companions,  whose  senses  were 
awakened and subtle faculties, alert, uttered those blessed words compris-
ing the lights of belief and gloriﬁcation, they did so in all their meaning and 
they  partook  of  them  with  all  their  senses.  However,  after  that  revolution 
and  upheaval,  the  subtle  faculties  have  gradually  sunk  into  sleep  and  the 
senses fallen from that point of realities into heedlessness; like fruits, under 
the veil of familiarity those blessed words have gradually lost their delicacy 
and freshness. Simply, as though drying up due to the air of superﬁciality, 
only a little freshness remains, and this may be restored to its former state 
only through drastic surgery of a reﬂective and reasoning kind. Thus, it is 
because of this that only in forty years can others reach the virtue and level 
the Companions attained to in forty minutes.

Third Reason

THIRD  REASON:  As  is  proved  in  the  Twelfth,  Twenty-Fourth,  and 
Twenty-Fifth Words, the comparison of prophethood and sainthood is that 
of the sun itself and the sun’s image as it appears in mirrors. Thus, however 

552

THE WORDS

much higher the sphere of prophethood is than that of sainthood, the serv-
ants of the sphere of prophethood and the Companions, the stars of that Sun, 
must be superior to the same degree to the righteous in the sphere of saint-
hood. The legacy of prophethood and veracity, which is the supreme saint-
hood, is the Companions’ sainthood; even if a saint attains to this, he still 
cannot reach the level of the Companions, the ﬁrst rank. We shall explain 
three out of the numerous aspects of this third reason.

First Aspect

F i r s t   A s p e c t :   The  Companions  cannot  be  reached  in  interpretation  of 
the law, that is, in deducing its ordinances, that is, in understanding what 
pleases Almighty Allah from His Word. This is because that mighty divine 
revolution revolved around understanding the dominical wishes and divine  
ordinances. All minds were turned towards deducing those ordinances. All 
hearts were eager to know, “ What does our Sustainer want from us? ” All 
that happened at that time did so in such a way as to make this known and 
understood. Discussions at that time concerned them. Thus, since everything 
and all situations and discussions and conversations and stories occurred in 
such a way as to give some sort of instruction in these meanings, and since 
this perfected the Companions’ capacities and illuminated their minds, and 
since their ability to interpret the law and deduce its ordinances was ready 
to be lit up like a match, no one at the present time can reach in ten years or 
perhaps in a hundred, the level of deduction and interpretation they reached 
in  a  day  or  a  month,  even  if  they  have  the  Companions’  intelligence  and 
capacity. Because now, worldly happiness is the focus of attention in place 
of eternal happiness. Humankind’s attention and view are directed towards 
different  goals.  The  struggle  for  livelihood  together  with  lack  of  reliance 
on Allah have bewildered man’s spirit, and naturalist and materialist phi-
losophies  have  blinded  his  intellect.  As  a  consequence,  just  as  the  social 
environment does not strengthen a person’s mind and capacity in respect of 
interpreting the divine law, so it confuses and scatters it. We proved in the 
discussion on interpretation of the law in the Twenty-Seventh Word in the 
comparison  between  Sufyan  ibn  Uyayna  and  someone  of  his  intelligence 
today that today’s person could not acquire in a hundred years what Sufyan 
acquired in ten.

Second Aspect

S e c o n d   A s p e c t :  The Companions’ station in closeness to Allah cannot be 
attained to with the feet of sainthood. For Almighty Allah is inﬁnitely close 
to us; closer to us than everything, but we are inﬁnitely distant from Him. 
divine proximity may be gained in two ways:

TWENTY-SEVENTH WORD – ADDENDUM

553

The  First  is  through  the  unfolding  of  divine  immediacy,  to  which  the 
divine proximity in prophethood looks, and which the Companions mani-
fested through the legacy of prophethood and conversation of the Prophet 
( UWBP ).

The Second Way is to traverse the degrees in our distance from Allah 
and be honoured with divine proximity to an extent. Most of the spiritual 
voyaging of sainthood is in accordance with this, and illumination through 
the self and through the outside world proceeds in this way.

Thus, the ﬁrst way is solely given, it is not acquired; it is attraction, the 
drawing  of  the  Most  Merciful,  and  it  is  being  loved  by  Him.  The  path  is 
short, but very severe, very elevated, very pure, and without shadow. The 
other is acquired, long, and in shadow. Even if its strange wonders are many, 
it cannot reach the ﬁrst in regard to quality and divine proximity. For exam-
ple, there are two ways of reaching yesterday. The ﬁrst is not to  be subject 
to the course of time. Through a sacred power, it is to rise above time and 
see yesterday as present like today. The second is to traverse the distance of 
a year, to travel and turn, and come to yesterday. But still yesterday cannot 
be held; it leaves the person and departs. In just the same way, there are two 
ways of passing from the apparent to reality. The ﬁrst is to be carried away 
directly  on  the  attraction  of  reality  and  without  entering  the  intermediate 
realm of the Suﬁ way, to ﬁnd reality within the apparent itself. The second 
is to pass through many levels by spiritual journeying. For sure, the saints 
are successful in annihilating the soul and kill the evil-commanding soul, 
but they still cannot reach the Companions. Because, since the Companions’ 
souls had been puriﬁed and cleansed, by virtue of the many faculties within 
the  soul  they  manifested  to  a  greater  degree  the  varieties  of  worship  and 
thanks and praise. After the soul has been annihilated, the worship of the 
saints acquires a simpleness and plainness.

Third Aspect

T h i r d   A s p e c t :  The Companions cannot be reached in regard to virtuous 
actions and good deeds pertaining to the hereafter. Because, just as in certain 
conditions in a frightening yet crucial post, a soldier may gain in one hour’s 
watch the virtue of a year’s worship, 1 and by being hit by a bullet may rise 
in one minute to a station similar to a degree of sainthood that can only by 
gained in at least forty years; so too, the Companions’ service in the estab-
lishment of Islam and propagating the Qur’an’s decrees and their declaring 
war on the whole world for Islam was so elevated that others cannot reach 

1.  See, B u k h ā r ī , Jihād, 73; M u s l i m , Amāra, 163; Ti r m i d h ī , Jihād, 2; N a s ā ’ ī , Jihād, 39;

THE WORDS

one minute of it in a year. It may even be said that in that sacred service 
all their minutes were like the one minute of the martyred soldier. All their 
hours were like the one hour’s watch of a faithful soldier in some terrifying 
post in which the acts are few, but the recompense great and value high. 

Indeed, since the Companions formed the ﬁrst rank in the establishment 
of Islam and spreading of the lights of the Qur’an, in accordance with the 
rule,  ِلِ(cid:150)اَ(cid:159)ْ(cid:170)اﯬﯦ  ُبَ(cid:93) َ
ّ(cid:127)(cid:170)َا 1 a share of all the good works of all the Islamic com-
munity passes to them. The Islamic community saying

receive a share of the good works of their whole community.

ّ(cid:171)(cid:170)َا  shows  that  the  Companions

Furthermore, just as an insigniﬁcant characteristic in the root of a tree 
is    greatly  magniﬁed  in  the  tree’s  branches  and  is  larger  than  the  largest 
branch; and just as a small protuberance at the beginning gradually forms a 
mass; and just as an excess the size of a needle point at a central point may 
become more than a metre at the circumference of the circle, just like these 
four examples, since the Companions were from the roots and foundations 
of the luminous tree of Islam, and were at the beginning of luminous lines of 
the structure of Islam, and were from among the leaders of the Islamic com-
munity and were the ﬁrst of their number, and since they were close to the 
centre of the Sun of Prophethood and Lamp of Reality ( UWBP ), a few of 
their actions were many and their small acts of service, great. To reach their 
level necessitates being a true Companion.

have believed without seeing him, in which case our belief is stronger. Also, 
there are narrations mentioning the strength of our belief, 1 are there not?

T h e   A n s w e r :  At that time, when all ideas were opposed and hostile to 
the truths of Islam, the Companions believed so strongly – sometimes on 
only seeing the person of Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) and without mira-
cles – that all the generally held ideas in the world did not shake them. Let 
alone doubts, they did not even cause some of them the slightest anxiety or 
scruple.  You  are  comparing  your  belief  with  that  of  the  Companions,  but 
how can there be any comparison? For despite your seeing with the mind’s 
eye, not the Messenger’s ( UWBP ) humanity and bodily form, which was 
the seed of the Tuba tree of his prophethood, but through all the lights of 
Islam  and  truths  of  the  Qur’an,  his  luminous,  magniﬁcent  collective  per-
sonality, encompassed by a thousand miracles – despite this, you waver and 
fall into  doubt at the word of a European philosopher. Yet owing to their 
belief, the Companions did not waver in the face of the attacks of the entire 
world of unbelief and of the Christians, Jews, and philosophers? And how 
can you compare the intense fear of Allah of the Companions and their com-
plete righteousness, which demonstrated the strength of their belief and pro-
ceeded from it, and your dull belief, which due to your extreme weakness 
does not impel you to perform even the obligatory practices completely, O 
you who make such a claim? However, the Hadith the meaning of which is: 
“ Those at the end of time who do not see me and believe, are more accept-
able, ” 2 refers to particular virtues. It concerns certain special persons. Our 
discussion, however, is in regard to general virtue and the majority.

Second Question

S e c o n d   Q u e s t i o n :  They say that the saints and possessors of perfection 
abandoned the world. It even says in a Hadith: “ Love of this world is the 
source of all error. ”  3 Whereas the Companions were very involved in the 
world.  Let  alone  abandoning  the  world,  some  of  them  were  ahead  of  the 
civilized of that time, even. How is it that you say that even the least of such 
Companions was of greater worth than the greatest saint?

T h e  A n s w e r :  It has been proved decisively in the Second and Third Stop-
ping-Places of the Thirty-Second Word that to love the face of the world 
which  looks  to  the  hereafter  and  that  which  looks  to  the  divine  names  is 
not the cause of loss, but the means to perfection and attainment, and how-
ever far one goes in those two faces, the further one goes in worship and

knowledge of Allah. The Companions’ world was within those two faces. 
They looked on this world as the arable ﬁeld of the hereafter, and sowed and 
reaped it. They saw beings as the mirrors of the divine names, and gazed on 
them yearningly. As for the transience of the world, that is its transitory face, 
which looks to man’s base desires.

Third Question

T h i r d   Q u e s t i o n :   The  Suﬁ  paths  are  the  ways  of  reality.  Some  of  the 
heroes and leaders of the Naqshbandi Order, which is claimed to be the most 
famous, the most elevated, and the highway among the Suﬁ ways, deﬁned 
its basis as follows. They said: 

 :ك
(cid:243)َ(cid:220)  ِك
ْك

(cid:215)(cid:253) ْ(cid:285)َ(cid:300)  ِ(cid:283)(cid:314) ِ(cid:243)َ(cid:264)  ْرَد

(cid:243)َ(cid:220) ،א

(cid:243)َ(cid:220)  ِرא َ(cid:338)  ْ(cid:239) َ(cid:296)ٰا  ْم ِز َ(cid:378) ى ِ(cid:239)ْ(cid:301)
(cid:243)َ(cid:220) ،(cid:309)ِ(cid:221) ْ(cid:249) َ(cid:304)  ِك
(cid:243)َ(cid:220) ،(cid:309)ـ
“ On the Naqshbandi way four abandonings are necessary: abandoning the 
world,  abandoning  the  hereafter,  abandoning  existence,  and  abandoning 
abandoning. ”  That  is  to  say,  on  the  Naqshi  way  one  has  to  give  up  four 
things: both give up this world; and, on account of the soul, not make even the 
hereafter one’s true aim; forget one’s existence; and in order not to become 
vain and proud, not think about  these acts of renunciation. This means that 
true knowledge of Allah and human perfections are attained through giving 
up what is other than Allah?

(cid:243)َ(cid:220)

T h e   A n s w e r :  If man consisted of only a heart, one would have to give 
up everything other than Allah and to leave behind even the divine names 
and  attributes  and  bind  one’s  heart  to  the  divine  essence  alone.  But  man 
possesses many senses and subtle faculties charged with duties, such as the 
mind, spirit, soul, and others. The perfect man is he who, driving all those 
subtle senses towards reality on the different ways of worship particular to 
them,  marches  heroically  like  the  Companions  in  a  broad  arena  and  rich 
fashion towards the goal, with the heart as commander and the subtle facul-
ties as soldiers. For the heart to abandon its soldiers in order to save only 
itself and to proceed on its own is the cause not of pride, but of distress.

Fourth Question

F o u r t h   Q u e s t i o n :  Where does the claim of the Companions’ superiority 
spring from? And who put it forward? Why should this matter be made the 
subject of discussion at this time? Also, why is there this claim of equality 
with the great interpreters of the law?

T h e   A n s w e r :  There are two groups who say these things. Some are the 
sincere religious scholars and men of religion who, seeing certain Hadiths, 
open up such discussions in order to encourage and hearten the pious and 
the upright at this time. We have nothing to say to them. They are anyway

few  and  are  quickly  made  aware.  The  other  group,  however,  consists  of 
fearsome, conceited people who want to spread their denial of the schools of 
law by claiming equality with the great interpreters of the law, and to further 
their irreligion by claiming equality with the Companions. For ﬁrstly, those 
people of misguidance have become depraved and have become addicted to 
depravity and cannot carry out the obligations of the Shari‘a since they form 
an obstacle to their depravity. In order to ﬁnd a pretext for themselves, they 
say: “ These questions may be interpreted. The schools of law are opposed 
to each other in these matters. The interpreters of the law were human beings 
like  us  and  may  have  made  mistakes.  In  which  case,  like  them  we  shall 
interpret the divine law and perform our worship as we wish. Why should 
we  be  compelled  to  follow  them? ”  Thus,  due  to  these  Satanic  wiles,  the 
wretches put themselves outside the fold of the schools of law. It is dem-
onstrated clearly in the Twenty-Seventh Word just how baseless and rotten 
these claims are, so we refer you to that.

S e c o n d l y ;  that group of the people of misguidance saw that the matter 
does not end with the interpreters of the law, for what lay on their shoulders 
were only the theoretical matters of religion. Whereas this group wants to 
give up and change the essential teachings. If they say: “ We are better than 
them, ”  the  matter  does  not  ﬁnish  there.  For  interpreters  of  the    law  may 
interfere in theoretical matters and in secondary matters which are not cat-
egorical, but these people of misguidance who follow no school of law want 
to mix their ideas in the essentials of religion as well and to change matters 
which it is not possible to change, and to oppose the incontrovertible pillars 
of Islam. So they are bound to attack the Companions, who are the bearers 
and supports of the essentials of religion. Alas! It has been proved decisively 
in  the  Twenty-Seventh  Word  that  not  animals  in  human  form  like  them, 
but true human beings and the greatest of the saints even, who are the most 
perfect of true human beings, cannot win the case claiming equality with the 
least of the Companions.

indicates some of the subtle wonders of Paradise. However, it does not

summary of the Tenth Word and the Second Station of this Word. This 
station discusses a number of the aspects of Paradise which have given

The brief answers to a number of questions about eternal Paradise.
The descriptions of the Qur’an’s verses about Paradise, which are more 
beautiful than Paradise, more lovely than the houris, and sweeter than the 
water of Salsabil, leave nothing to be said about it so that anyone should 
say it. However, in order to bring closer to the understanding those shining, 
pre-eternal, post-eternal, elevated and exquisite verses, we shall mention a 
number of steps, and, as samples of that Qur’anic Paradise, a number of ﬁne 
points which are like samples of its ﬂowers. We shall indicate these with ﬁve 
allusive questions and answers. Indeed, Paradise is the forum for both all 
spiritual and non-physical pleasures, and all physical pleasures.

QUESTION:  What  connection  with  eternity  and  Paradise  has  faulty, 
deﬁcient,  changing,  unstable,  and  suffering  corporeality?  Since  the  spirit  
has elevated pleasures, that is sufﬁcient. Why should bodily resurrection be 
necessary for bodily pleasures?

THE ANSWER: Because, just as in relation to water, air, and light, earth 
is dense and dark, but since it is the source and means of all the varieties of 
divine artefacts, in meaning it rises above the other elements; and just as in 
regard to the mystery of its comprehensiveness and on condition it is puri-
ﬁed, the human soul, which is also dense, rises above all the other human 
subtle faculties; so too corporeality is the richest and most comprehensive 
and all-embracing mirror to the manifestation of the divine names. All the 
tools and instruments for measuring the contents of the treasuries of mercy 
and reckoning their balances lie in corporeality. For example, if scales to the 
number of sorts of food and their pleasures did not originate in the sense of 
taste in the tongue, it could not taste and weigh them all up, and recognize 
and experience them. Also, the instruments for experiencing and knowing 
the manifestations of most of the divine names, and tasting and recognizing 
them,  again  lie  in  corporeality.  And  the  faculties  for  experiencing  all  the 
inﬁnitely various pleasures are also found in corporeality.

As is proved in the Eleventh Word, it is understood clearly from the dis-
position of the universe and man’s comprehensiveness that the universe’s 
Maker wants to make known through the universe all the treasuries of His 
mercy, and all the manifestations of His names, and to make experienced 
all the varieties of His bounties. The abode of bliss, therefore, will resem-
ble the universe to a degree since it is a vast pool formed from the ﬂood of 
the universe and a great exhibition of the textiles woven on the loom of the 
universe and an everlasting store of the crops produced in the arable ﬁeld of 
this world. And it will preserve all its fundamental matters, both corporeal 
and  spiritual.  Its  All-Wise  Maker,  the  All-Just  Most  Compassionate  One, 
will also give as recompense for the duties of the physical tools and instru-
ments, pleasures worthy of them; and to His servants, as a wage and reward 
for the particular worship of each. Otherwise a situation would occur that 
was contrary to His wisdom, justice, and mercy, and that would be in no way 
ﬁtting for the beauty of His mercy and perfection of His justice, and in no 
way compatible with them.

QUESTION: If a body is living, its parts are constantly being formed 
and dissolved; it is doomed to extinction and cannot be eternal. The purpose 
of eating and drinking is to perpetuate the individual, and marital relations 
are for the perpetuation of the species. These are fundamental to this world, 

560

THE WORDS

but there will be no need for them in the world of eternity and hereafter. So 
why will they be among the greatest pleasures of Paradise?

THE ANSWER: Firstly, the bodies of living creatures are doomed to 
annihilation and death in this world because of an imbalance between what 
is  taken  in  and  what  is  expended.  From  childhood  until  maturity  much  is 
taken in, and after that what is expended increases; the balance is spoilt, and 
the body dies. In the world of eternity, however, the particles of the body 
remain constant and are not subject to composition and dissolution, or else 
the balance remains constant;1 intake and discharge are in equilibrium. Like 
a closed circle or perpetual motion, a living creature’s body becomes eternal 
together with the machine of bodily life’s functioning for pleasure. Although 
in this world eating and drinking and marriage arise from need and perform 
various functions, delights and pleasures have been placed within them as 
an immediate wage for the duty performed, and these are superior to other 
pleasures. Since in this abode of sorrows eating and marriage are the means 
to so many wonderful and various pleasures, certainly in Paradise, which is 
the abode of pleasure and bliss, those pleasures will take on a sublime form. 
The recompense of the duties pertaining to the hereafter performed here will 
also be added to them as pleasure, and they will be augmented by worldly 
needs  which  have  taken  the  form  of  agreeable,  otherworldly  appetites,  so 
will become an all-embracing, living source of pleasure worthy of Paradise 
and suitable to eternity. Indeed, according to an inner meaning of the verse,

( 29:64 ) - , + * )  ' & % $ # " !
substances  and  matters  which  are  inanimate  and  without  consciousness 
and life in the abode of this world, there will be living and conscious. Like 
human beings and animals here, the trees and stones there will understand 
commands and carry them out. If you tell a tree to bring you such-and-such 
a fruit, it will bring it. And if you tell such-and-such a stone to come, it will 
come. Since stones and trees will take on this elevated form, it surely neces-
sitates that, together with preserving their bodily realities, eating, drinking, 
and marriage also will take on a form higher than their worldly form, higher 
to the degree that Paradise is higher than this world.

1.    In  this  world,  the  bodies  of  humans  and  animals  are  like  guesthouses,  barracks, 
and schools for particles. The lifeless particles enter them and acquire worthiness to be 
particles for the everlasting realm, which is living, then they leave them. In the hereafter, 
however,  according  to  the  verse,  ( 29:64 ) - , + * )  the  light  of  life  is 
general. There is no necessity for that travelling, drill, and instruction in order to be illumi-
nated. Particles will remain constant as permanent ﬁxtures.

QUESTION: According to the meaning of:
 1 َ
ّبَ(cid:110)َا  ْنَ(cid:174) َعَ(cid:174) ُءْر َ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)َا
in  Paradise,  friend  will  be  together  with  friend.  Therefore,  the  love  for 
Allah’s sake kindled in a simple nomad during one minute’s conversation 
with  the  Prophet  ( UWBP ),  means  he  has  to  be  with  the  Prophet  ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) in Paradise. But since Allah’s Noble Mes-
senger ( UWBP ) receives limitless effulgence, how can it be united with that 
of a simple nomad?

THE ANSWER: We shall allude to this elevated truth with a compari-
son. For example, a magniﬁcent personage set up a vast banquet and ﬁnely-
adorned spectacle in a splendid garden. He prepared it in such a way that it 
included all the delicious foods that the sense of taste can experience, and all 
the ﬁne things that please the sense of sight, and all the wonders that amuse 
the faculty of imagination, and so on; he included in it everything that would 
gratify and give pleasure to the external and inner senses. Now, there were 
two friends and they went together to the banquet and sat down at a table 
in a pavilion. But the sense of taste of one of them was very limited, so he 
received  only  minor  pleasure.  His  eyes  could  see  only  a  little,  he  had  no 
sense of smell, and he could not understand the wondrous arts nor compre-
hend the marvels. He could only beneﬁt from and take pleasure in a thou-
sandth or even a millionth of that beautiful place, to the extent of his capac-
ity. The other man however had developed his outer and inner senses, his 
mind, heart, emotions, and subtle faculties so perfectly and to such a degree 
that although he was next to his friend, he could perceive and experience all 
the subtleties and beauties and marvels and ﬁne things in the exhibition, and 
receive their different pleasures. 

Since this confused, sorrowful, and narrow world is thus, and although 
the greatest and the least are together the difference between them is as great 
as  from  the  ground  to  the  Pleiades,  surely  in  Paradise,  the  realm  of  bliss 
and eternity, while friend is together with friend, each will receive his share 
from the table of the Most Merciful and Compassionate One in accordance 
with his capacity and to the extent of his abilities. Even if the Paradises in 
which they are found are different, it will not be an obstacle to their being 
together. For although the eight levels of Paradise are one above the other,

they all have the sublime throne as their roof. 1 If there are  walled circles 
around  a  conical  mountain,  one  within  the  other  and  one  above  the  other 
from its foot to the summit, the circles are one over the other and look to 
one another, but do not prevent any of the others seeing the sun. There are 
also various narrations of Hadiths indicating that the way the Paradises are 
situated is close to this.

QUESTION: It is said in Hadiths: “ Although the houris are clothed in 
seventy garments, the marrow of their leg-bones may be seen. ” 2 What does 
this mean? What sort of meaning can it have? What sort of beauty is this?

THE  ANSWER:  Its  meaning  is  truly  beautiful  and  its  beauty  is  most 
lovely. It is like this: in this world, which is ugly, inanimate, lifeless, and for 
the most part just a husk, beauty and loveliness only appear beautiful to the 
eye, and so long as familiarity is not an obstacle, that is sufﬁcient. Whereas 
in  Paradise,  which  is  beautiful,  living,  brilliant,  and  entirely  the  essence 
without the husk and the kernel without the shell, all the human senses and 
subtle  faculties  will  want  to  receive  their  different  pleasures  and  various 
delights from the houris, the gracious, fair sex, and from the women of this 
world, who will be like houris and even more beautiful, the same as the eye. 
That  is  to  say,  the  Hadith  indicates  that  from  the  beauty  of  their  top  gar-
ments to the marrow of their bones, each layer will be a source of pleasure 
for a sense and a subtle faculty. Yes, by saying, “ The houris wear seventy 
garments and the marrow of their leg-bones can be seen, ” the Hadith points 
out that however many senses, feeling, powers, and faculties human beings 
possess which are enamoured of beauty, worship pleasure, are captivated by 
ornament, and yearn for loveliness, the houris comprise all of them – every 
sort of adornment and exquisite loveliness, physical and spiritual and imma-
terial, which will please and satisfy all of them, and gratify them and make 
them all happy. 

That is to say, since the seventy varieties of paradisaical adornment the 
houris  are  clothed  in  are  not  of  one  sort,  none  conceal  the  others  so  the 
houris  display  sorts  and  kinds  of  beauty  and  loveliness  perhaps  seventy 
times greater than their own bodies and beings and selves. They demonstrate 
the truth indicated by the verse:

There is also a Hadith that states that since in Paradise there are no unnec-
essary,  extraneous,  waste  matters,  the  people  of  Paradise  will  not  excrete  
waste after eating and drinking. 1 Since in this lowly world, trees, the most 
ordinary  of  living  beings,  do  not  excrete  despite  taking  in  much  nourish-
ment, why should the people of Paradise, who are the highest class of life?

QUESTION:  It  says  in  Hadiths:  “ Some  of  the  people  of  Paradise  are 
given lands as extensive as the world, and thousands of palaces and hun-
dreds  of  thousands  of  houris  are  bestowed  on  them. ”  2  What  need  has  a 
single person of all these things, why should it be necessary? How can this 
be and what does it mean?

THE ANSWER: If man was only a lifeless being, or was only a veg-
etable  creature  consisting  of  a  stomach,  or  consisted  only  of  a  limited, 
heavy, temporary, simple corporeality or animal body, he could not own 
many palaces and houris, or be ﬁt for them. But man is such a compre-
hensive miracle of power that even in this transitory world and brief life, 
if he is given the rule of the whole world with its wealth and pleasures, 
his ambition is not satisﬁed – in respect of the need of some of his subtle 
faculties, which do not develop here. It is therefore reasonable, right, and 
true that a person possessing an inﬁnite capacity who knocks on the door 
of  an  inﬁnite  mercy  with  the  hand  of  inﬁnite  desires  and  the  tongue  of 
inﬁnite needs will receive in an eternal abode of bliss the divine bounties 
described in Hadiths. We shall observe this elevated truth through the tel-
escope of a comparison. It is as follows:

Although,  like  this  valley  garden,  3  all  the  gardens  and  vineyards  of 
Barla have different owners, all the birds and sparrows and honey-bees in 
Barla, who have only a handful of grain for food, may say: “ All the gar-
dens and orchards of Barla are my pleasant resorts where I ﬂy around and 
enjoy  myself. ”  Each  may  take  possession  of  Barla  and  include  it  in  its 
property. Others sharing it does not invalidate his ownership. Similarly, a 
man  who  is  a  true  human  being  may  say:  “ My  Creator  made  this  world 
a house for me. The sun is my lamp and the stars, my electric lights. The 
face of the earth is my resting-place spread with ﬂowered carpets. ” And he 
offers  thanks  to  Allah.  The  other  creatures  sharing  it  does  not  negate  his 
statement. On the contrary, the creatures adorn his house like decorations.

And so, if, by virtue of his humanity, man – and even a bird – in this narrow 
ﬂeeting world, claims a sort of power of disposal over such a vast sphere and 
receives such a vast bounty, how can it be deemed unlikely that  he will be 
given ownership of a property stretching over a ﬁve-hundred-year distance 
in a broad and eternal abode of bliss?

Moreover, just as in this dense, dark and narrow world the sun is present 
in the same way at the same time in numerous mirrors, so too, as is proved in 
the Sixteenth Word, a luminous being may be present in many places in the 
same way at the same time. For example, Gabriel ( Upon whom be peace ) 
simultaneously being on a thousand stars, and at the divine throne, and in 
the presence of the Prophet ( UWBP ), and in the divine presence; and the 
Prophet  Muhammad  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  meeting  with 
most  of  the  righteous  of  his  community  at  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  at 
the same time and appearing in this world in innumerable places simultane-
ously; and a strange group of the saints known as  a b d ā l , appearing at the 
same time in many places; and ordinary people sometimes carrying out in a 
dream as much as a year’s work in one minute and observing this; and eve-
ryone being in contact with and concerned with numerous places at the same 
time  in  their  hearts,  spirits,  and  imaginations  –  all  these  are  well-known 
and may be witnessed. Most certainly, therefore, in luminous, unrestricted, 
broad, and eternal Paradise, the people of Paradise, whose bodies have the 
strength and lightness of the spirit and the swiftness of imagination, being 
in hundreds of thousands of places at the same time, and conversing with 
hundreds of thousands of houris, and receiving pleasure in hundreds of thou-
sands of ways, is ﬁtting for that eternal Paradise, that inﬁnite mercy, and as 
told by the Bringer of Sure News ( UWBP ), is reality and the truth. Never-
theless, these vast truths cannot be weighed on the scales of our tiny minds.

TWENTY-EIGHTH WORD

A Short Addendum
to the Word on Paradise
On Hell 

As is proved in the Second and Eighth Words, belief bears the seed of a 
sort of Paradise, while unbelief conceals the seed of a sort of Hell. And just 
as unbelief is a seed of Hell, so Hell is one of its fruits. And just as unbelief 
is  the  reason  for  being  sent  to  Hell,  so  it  is  the  cause  of  Hell’s  existence 
and creation. For if an insigniﬁcant ruler of small dignity, small pride, and 
small majesty is told impudently by some unmannerly person: “ You may 
not punish me and you cannot, ” if there is no prison in that place, the ruler 
will certainly have one built for him and will throw him into it. However, 
by denying Hell, the unbeliever is giving the lie to One of inﬁnite dignity, 
pride,  and  glory,  Who  is  sublimely  and  inﬁnitely  powerful,  and  is  accus-
ing Him of impotence, lying, and powerlessness; he is insulting terribly His 
dignity  and  offending  His  pride.  He  is  rebelliously  causing  affront  to  His 
glory. If, to suppose the impossible, there were no reason for Hell’s exist-
ence, it would certainly be created for unbelief, which comprises denial and 
ascribing impotence to this degree, and such an unbeliever would certainly 
be cast into it.

[ This station consists of two main aims and an introduction ]

Introduction
It  may  be  said  that  the  existence  of  the  angels  and  spirit  beings  is  as 
deﬁnite as that of human beings and animals. Indeed, as is explained in the 
First Step of the Fifteenth Word, reality undoubtedly requires and wisdom 
certainly demands that like the earth the heavens have inhabitants, and that 
its inhabitants are intelligent, and suitable for the heavens. In the tongue of 
the Shari‘a, those inhabitants, of which there are numerous kinds, are called 
angels and spirit beings. 

Reality requires it to be thus. For despite the earth’s smallness and insig-
niﬁcance in relation to the heavens, its being ﬁlled with intelligent beings 
and from time to time being emptied and then reﬁlled with new ones sug-
gests – indeed, states clearly – that the heavens too, with their majestic con-
stellations like adorned palaces, are ﬁlled with animate creatures, the light 
of the light of existence, and conscious and intelligent creatures, the light of 
animate creatures. Like man and the jinn, those creatures are spectators of 
the palace of the world, and ponderers over the book of the universe, and her-
alds of this realm of dominicality. With their universal and comprehensive 

566

ٰ
TWENTY-NINTH WORD – FIRST AIM

worship, they represent the gloriﬁcation of the universe’s large and univer-
sal beings. 

The nature of the universe surely points to their existence. For since it 
is  embellished and decked out with uncountable numbers of ﬁnely adorned 
works of art and meaningful decorations and wise embroideries, it self-evi-
dently requires the gazes of thoughtful admirers and wondering, apprecia-
tive lovers; it demands their existence. Yes, just as beauty requires a lover, 
so is food is given to the hungry. Thus, the sustenance of spirits and nourish-
ment of hearts in this boundless beauty of art looks to the angels and spirit 
beings; it points to them. For while such inﬁnite adornment requires an inﬁ-
nite duty of contemplation and worship, man and the jinn can perform only a 
millionth of that inﬁnite duty, that wise supervision, that extensive worship. 
This means that boundless varieties of angels and spirit beings are necessary 
to perform those inﬁnitely diverse duties and worship, and to ﬁll and inhabit 
the mighty mosque of the world with their ranks.

Indeed, a species of the spirit beings and angels is present in every aspect, 
in every sphere, of the universe, each charged with a duty of worship. It may 
be said in accordance with both the allusive narrations of Hadiths and the 
wisdom in the order of the world that from lifeless planets and stars to rain-
drops, all are ships or vehicles for a kind of angel. The angels mount these 
vehicles with divine permission and travel observing the Manifest World; 
they represent their praise and gloriﬁcation. 

It also may be said that certain sorts of living bodies act as aircraft for 
different kinds of spirits. From the birds of Paradise, called the Green Birds 
in  a  Hadith  which  says:  “ The  spirits  of  the  people  of  Paradise  enter  into 
Green Birds in the Intermediate Realm and travel around Paradise in them, ” 
1 to ﬂies, each is the vehicle for a sort of spirit. The spirits enter into them 
at a divine command, and through such faculties and senses of those living 
bodies as the eyes and ears, observe the miracles of creation in the corporeal 
world. They perform the gloriﬁcation particular to each.

Just  as  reality  necessitates  it  to  be  thus,  so  does  wisdom.  For,  with  an 
intense  activity,  the  All-Wise  Maker  continuously  creates  subtle  life  and 
luminous  intelligent  beings  from  dense  earth,  which  has  little  connection 
with spirit, and from turbid water, which has small relation with the light 
of  life.  He  surely  then  creates  certain  sorts  of  intelligent  beings  from  the 
seas of light and even from the oceans of darkness, from the air, electricity,

and other subtle matter suitable for spirit and appropriate for life. And surely 
these creatures are exceedingly numerous.

First Aim 

To believe in the angels and afﬁrm that belief is a pillar of faith. There are 

four fundamental points in this aim.

First Fundamental Point

FIRST FUNDAMENTAL POINT

The perfection of existence is through life. Rather, the true existence of 
existence is through life. Life is the light of existence, and consciousness is 
the light of life. Life is the summit and foundation of everything. Life appro-
priates everything for each and every living being; it is as though it makes 
one thing the owner of everything. By virtue of life, a living thing may say: 
“ All these things belong to me. The world is my house. The universe is my 
property, given to me by my owner. ”

Just as light is the cause of things being seen, and, according to some, of 
the existence of colours, so is life the revealer of beings; it is the cause of 
their qualities being realized. Furthermore, it makes an insigniﬁcant particu-
lar general and universal, and is the cause of universal things being concen-
trated in a particular. It is also the cause of all the perfections of existence, 
by, for example, making innumerable things co-operate and unite, and mak-
ing them the means of unity and being endowed with spirit. Life is even a 
sort of manifestation of divine unity in the levels of multiplicity, and a mir-
ror reﬂecting divine oneness.

Consider the following: a lifeless object, even if it is a great mountain, is 
an orphan, a stranger, alone. Its only relations are with the place in which it 
is situated and with the things which encounter it. Whatever else there is in 
the cosmos, it does not exist for the mountain. For the mountain has neither 
life through which it might be related to life, nor consciousness by which it 
might be concerned.

Now  consider  a  tiny  object  like  a  bee,  for  example.  The  instant  life 
enters  it,  it  establishes  such  a  connection  with  the  universe  that  it  is  as 
though it concludes a trading agreement with it, especially with the ﬂowers 
and plants of the earth. It can say: “ The earth is my garden; it is my trading 
house. ” Thus, through the unconscious instinctive senses which impel and 
stimulate it in addition to the well-known [ ﬁve ] external senses and inner 
senses of animate beings, the bee has a feeling for, and a familiarity and 
reciprocal relationship with, most of the species in the world, and they are 
at its disposal.

TWENTY-NINTH WORD – FIRST AIM

569

If life then displays its effect thus in the tiniest of animate beings, cer-
tainly when it rises to the highest level, that of man, it will be revealed and 
extended and illumined to such a degree that just as a human being is able 
to move through the rooms of his house with his consciousness and mind, 
which are the light of life, so he may travel through the higher, and the spir-
itual and corporeal worlds with them. That is to say, just as that conscious 
and  animate  being  may  go  in  spirit  as  though  as  a  guest  to  those  worlds, 
those worlds too come as guests to his mirror-like spirit by being reﬂected 
and depicted there.

Life is a brilliant proof of the All-Glorious One’s unity, and one of the 
greatest sources of His bounty; it is a subtle manifestation of His compas-
sionateness,  and  a  hidden,  unknowable,  and  incomparable  embroidery  of 
His art.

Life is hidden and subtle, because the life of plants even, which is the 
lowest of the levels of life, and the awakening of the life force in seeds, that 
is, their stirring, opening, and growth, which are the ﬁrst steps in plant life, 
has remained unfathomed by human science since the time of Adam, despite 
being so evident and familiar, so ubiquitous and common. Human reason 
has been unable to discover its true reality.

Moreover, life is so pure and unblemished that in both its aspects, that is 
in both its inner and outer faces, it is pure, translucent, transparent. Not veil-
ing it with causes, the hand of power touches it directly. Whereas that hand 
made apparent causes a veil, to be the source of the insigniﬁcant aspects of 
things  and  their  unclean  external  qualities,  which  are  inappropriate  to  the 
dignity of power.

I n   S h o r t :  It may be said that if there were no life, existence would not be 
existence; it would be no different from non-existence. Life is the light of the 
spirit, and consciousness is the light of life. Since life and consciousness are 
important to this great extent; and since there is self-evidently an absolutely 
perfect order in the universe, and a masterly precision and most wise har-
mony; and since our lowly, wretched globe, our wandering earth has been 
ﬁlled with uncountable numbers of animate beings, intelligent beings, and 
beings with spirits; it may be concluded intuitively and with decisive cer-
tainty that those heavenly palaces, those lofty constellations also have ani-
mate and conscious inhabitants appropriate to them. As ﬁsh swim in water, 
so are those luminous inhabitants present in the ﬁre of the sun. Fire does not 
consume light; indeed, ﬁre aids light.

570

THE WORDS

Moreover, since, as is plain to see, pre-eternal power creates innumerable 
animate beings and beings with spirits from the most common substances 
and densest matter, and giving it great importance, transmutes  dense mat-
ter by means of life into a subtle substance; and since it strews the light of 
life  everywhere  in  great  abundance,  and  gilds  most  things  with  the  light 
of consciousness; with such ﬂawless power and faultless wisdom, the All-
Wise and All-Powerful One would certainly not neglect the other ﬂoods of 
subtle matter like light and ether, which are close to and ﬁtting for the spirit; 
He  would  not  leave  them  without  life,  without  consciousness,  inanimate. 
Indeed,  He  creates  animate  and  conscious  beings  in  great  numbers  from 
light, which is also matter, and even from darkness and from ether, and even 
from meanings, air, and even words. Just as He creates numerous different 
species of animals, so from these torrents of subtle matter He creates numer-
ous  different  spirit  creatures.  One  kind  of  them  are  the  angels,  others  are 
the varieties of spirit beings and jinn. If you wish to see just how true, self-
evident, and rational it is to accept the existence of great numbers of angels 
and  spirit  beings,  and  just  how  contrary  to  truth  and  wisdom,  and  what  a 
superstition, aberration, delirium and foolishness it is not to accept them as 
the Qur’an explains, consider the following comparison.

There  were  two  men,  one  rustic  and  uncouth,  the  other  civilized  and 
intelligent, who made friends and went to a splendid city like Istanbul. In 
a distant corner of that civilized, magniﬁcent city they came across a dirty, 
wretched  little  building,  a  factory.  They  looked  and  saw  that  the  strange 
factory was full of miserable, impoverished men working. All around the 
building  were  beings  with  spirits  and  animate  beings,  but  their  means  of 
livelihood and conditions of life were such that some were herbivorous, they 
lived only on plants, while others were piscivorous, they ate nothing but ﬁsh.
The  two  men  watched  the  scene.  Then  they  saw  in  the  distance  thou-
sands  of  adorned  palaces  and  lofty  castles.  Among  the  palaces  were  spa-
cious workshops and broad squares. Because of either the distance, or the 
defectiveness of the men’s eyesight, or because they had hidden themselves, 
the inhabitants of the palaces were not visible to the two men. Moreover, the 
wretched conditions in the factory were not to be seen in the palaces. In con-
sequence, because they were not to be seen and the conditions of life here 
were not present there, the uncouth country bumpkin, who had never before 
seen a city, declared: “ Those palaces have no inhabitants, they are empty, 
there are no beings with spirits in them, ” uttering ignorant garbled nonsense. 
To which the second man replied:

TWENTY-NINTH WORD – FIRST AIM

571

“ O  you  miserable  man!  This  insigniﬁcant  little  building  you  see  here 
has been ﬁlled with beings endowed with spirits, with workers, and there 
is someone who continually employs and replaces them. Look, there is no 
empty space anywhere around this factory, it has been ﬁlled with animate 
beings and beings with spirits. Do you think it is at all possible that there  
would be no high-ranking inhabitants suitable to so orderly a city, to those 
wise  adornments,  to  those  palaces  so  full  of  art  which  we  can  see  in  the 
distance?  Of  course  they  are  all  occupied,  and  the  different  conditions  of 
life  there  are  appropriate  for  those  who  live  there.  In  place  of  grass,  they 
may eat pastries, and in place of ﬁsh, cakes. Their not being visible to you 
because of the distance, or your weak eyesight, or their hiding themselves, 
can at no time prove their not being there.” The fact that a thing is not visible 
does not indicate its non-existence. Not seeing something does not prove its 
non-being.

As the above comparison indicates, the fact that the globe of the earth is 
the home of these inﬁnite numbers of beings endowed with consciousness 
and spirit, despite its insigniﬁcance and density among the lofty heavenly 
bodies and planets, and even its grossest and rottenest particulars becoming  
sources of life and masses of micro-organisms necessarily, demonstrably, 
in the best way, and by conjecture, decisively indicates and testiﬁes to and 
proclaims that inﬁnite space and the majestic heavens with their constella-
tions and stars are full of animate beings, conscious beings, and beings with 
spirits.  The  Illustrious  Shari‘a  of  Muhammad  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings 
and peace ) and the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition call these beings, who 
are created from ﬁre, light, darkness, air, sound, scents, words, ether, and 
even from electricity and from other subtle ﬂowing matter, “ The angels, the 
jinn, and spirit beings. ” There are different kinds of angels, just as there are 
different kinds of corporeal beings. Indeed, the angel who is appointed to a 
raindrop will not be similar in kind to the angel appointed to the sun. There 
are also a great many different sorts of jinn and spirit beings.

Conclusion

The Conclusion of this
Fundamental Point

As may be established empirically, matter is not essential so that exis-
tence may be made subject to it and dependent on it. Rather, matter subsists 
through a meaning, and that meaning is life, it is spirit.

Also, as may be established through observation, matter is not the thing 
served  so  that  everything  may  be  ascribed  to  it.  It  is  rather  the  servant; 

572

THE WORDS

it renders service to the process of the perfection of a truth. And that truth is 
life, and the fundament of that truth is spirit.

Also, as is self-evident, matter is not dominant so that recourse may be 
made to it or perfections sought from it. Rather, it is dominated; it looks to 
the decree of some fundament, it is in motion in the way that that decree 
dictates. And that fundament is life, it is spirit, it is consciousness.

Also, as is necessary, matter is not the kernel, it is not the fundament, it 
is not a settled abode so that events and perfections may be afﬁxed to it or  
constructed on it. Rather, it is a shell prepared to be split, rent, dissolved; it 
is a husk, it is froth, it is a form. 

It is apparent, isn’t it that a creature so minute it can only be seen with 
a microscope has such acute senses it can hear its friend’s voice and see its 
sustenance; it has extremely sensitive and sharp senses? This demonstrates 
that the effects of life increase and the light of the spirit intensiﬁes propor-
tionately  to  the  reducing  and  reﬁning  of  matter.  It  is  as  though  the  more 
matter is reﬁned and the more we become distanced from our material exist-
ences the closer we draw to the world of the spirit, the world of life, and the 
world of consciousness; and the more intensely the heat of the spirit and the 
light of life are manifested.

Is it therefore at all possible that there should be so many distillations of 
life, consciousness, and spirit within the veil of materiality, and that the inner 
world which is beyond this veil should not be full of conscious beings and 
beings with spirits? Is it at all possible that the sources of these numberless 
distillations, ﬂashes, and fruits of meaning, spirit, life and the truth appar-
ent in this material existence in the Manifest World should be ascribed only 
to matter and the motion of matter, and be explained by it? Allah forbid! 
Absolutely not! These innumerable distillations and ﬂashes demonstrate that 
this material and manifest world is but a lace veil strewn over the inner and 
spirit worlds.

Second Fundamental Point

SECOND FUNDAMENTAL POINT

It may be said that all the scholars of the formal, rational sciences and 
the transmitted sciences have, knowingly or unknowingly, united to effect 
a consensus in afﬁrming, despite difference of expression, the existence of 
the angels, the truth of spirit beings, and their existent reality. One group 
of Peripatetic philosophers of the Illuminist School even, who made much 
progress  in  the  study  of  matter,  stated  without  denying  the  meaning  of 
the angels that each realm in creation has a spiritual, incorporeal essence. 
They  described  the  angels  thus.  Also,  a  group  of  the  early  philosophers 

TWENTY-NINTH WORD – FIRST AIM

573

who  were  Illuminists,  being  compelled  to  accept  the  meaning  of  the 
angels, were only wrong in naming them the Ten Intellects and Masters of 
the Realms of Creation. Through the inspiration and guidance of Revela-
tion, scholars of all the revealed religions have accepted that each realm of 
creation has an angel appointed to it and have named them the Mountain 
Angel, the Sea Angel, and the Rain Angel, for example. Even the material-
ists and naturalists, whose reasoning is restricted to what is immediately 
apparent to them and who have in effect fallen from the level of humanity 
to that of inanimate matter, rather than being  able to deny the meaning of 
the angels,  1 have been compelled to accept them in one respect, though 
naming them the suffusing forces.

O  you  wretched  man  who  is  reluctant  to  accept  the  angels  and  spirit 
beings, on what do you base this view? What facts do you rely on that you 
oppose the conscious or otherwise unanimity of all rational people concern-
ing the existence and reality of the meaning of the angels and the real exist-
ence  of  spirit  beings?  And  since,  as  was  proved  in  the  First  Fundamental 
Point, life is the revealer of beings, indeed, is their consequence, their quin-
tessence; and since all the scholars are in effect unanimous in their accept-
ance of the meaning of the angels; and this world of ours has been ﬁlled to 
such a degree with animate creatures and beings with spirits; is it all possible 
that the vastness of space and the rareﬁed heavens would remain empty of 
dwellers and have no inhabitants? You should never suppose that the laws 
in force in this creation are sufﬁcient for the universe to be alive, because 
those governing laws are insubstantial commands; they are imaginary prin-
ciples;  they  may  be  considered  non-existent.  If  there  were  no  absolutely 
obedient creatures called angels to represent them, make them apparent, and 
take their reins into their hands, those laws could not be deﬁned as existent, 
nor be represented as having a particular identity, nor be an external real-
ity. Whereas, life is an external reality, and an imaginary command cannot 
sustain an external reality.

In Short: Since the scholars of religion and philosophy, and of the formal, 
rational and transmitted sciences, have in effect agreed that beings are not 
restricted  to  this  Manifest  World;  and  since,  despite  being  inanimate  and 
inappropriate  for  the  formation  of  spirits,  the  visible  Manifest  World  has 

1.  They have been unable to ﬁnd a way to deny the reality and meaning of the angels 
and  spirit  beings.  In  fact,  they  have  been  compelled  to  afﬁrm  them  in  one  respect  by 
claiming them to be one of the natural laws, although they described them wrongly, nam-
ing them k u v a - y ı   s â r i y a  or suffusing forces. ( Hey you who consider yourselves to be so 
clever! )

574

THE WORDS

been adorned to such an extent with beings with spirits; existence is surely 
not limited to it. There are numerous other levels of existence in relation to 
which the Manifest World is an embroidered veil.

Furthermore, since, just as the sea is appropriate for ﬁsh and the World 
of the Unseen and the World of Meaning are appropriate for spirits, and this 
necessitates their being ﬁlled with them; and since all commands testify to 
the existence of the angels’ meaning; certainly and without any shadow of 
a doubt, the most beautiful form of the angels’ existence and spirit beings’ 
reality, and the most rational view of their nature which sound intellects will 
accept and acclaim, is that which the Qur’an has expounded and elucidated. 
The Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition states that: “ The angels are honoured 
slaves. Never contesting a command, they do whatever they are ordered. The 
angels are subtle, luminous beings, and are divided into different kinds. ”

Just as humankind is a nation and human beings are the bearers, repre-
sentatives,  and  embodiments  of  the  Shari‘a  or  code  of  divine  laws  which 
proceeds  from  the  attribute  of  divine  speech,  so  are  the  angels  a  mighty 
nation, and those of them who are workers are the bearers, representatives, 
and embodiments of the code of laws pertaining to creation, which proceeds 
from the attribute of divine will. They are a class of Allah’s slaves who are 
dependent on the commands of the creative power and pre-eternal will, the 
true effective agent, and for whom all the heavenly bodies are places of wor-
ship, like mosques.

Third Fundamental Point

THIRD FUNDAMENTAL POINT

The angels and spirit beings are one of those questions in which the real-
ity of a universal may be inferred from the existence of a single particular. 
If a single individual is seen, the existence of the species may be concluded. 
Whoever denies it, denies it as a member of the species to which it belongs. 
While whoever accepts the single individual is compelled to accept its whole 
species. Since it is thus, consider the following:

Have you not seen and heard that all the scholars of the revealed religions 
throughout the ages from the time of Adam until now have agreed on the 
existence of the angels and the reality of spirit beings? The different groups 
of humankind have concurred in having seen and conversed with angels and 
in their narrations concerning them, as though they were discussing and nar-
rating events about one another. Do you think that if a single angel had not 
been seen, and the existence of one or numerous individuals not been estab-
lished certainly through observation, and their existence not been perceived 
clearly, self-evidently, that it would have been at all possible for such accord 

TWENTY-NINTH WORD – FIRST AIM

575

and such a consensus to continue, and to continue persistently and unani-
mously in such an afﬁrmative and positive manner, based on observation?

Also, is it at all possible that the source of this general belief should 
not  be  some  necessary  principles  and  self-evident  matters?  And  is  it  all 
possible that a baseless delusion should persist and become permanent in 
all the beliefs of mankind throughout all the revolutions it has undergone? 
And is it all possible that the basis of the assertion of these scholars of the 
religions, of this mighty consensus, should not be as a result of a certain 
intuition and empirical certainty? And is it at all possible that that certain 
intuition  and    empirical  certainty  which  result  from  innumerable  signs, 
and  those  signs  which  have  been  observed  on  numerous  occasions,  and 
those numerous observations should not all, without doubt or hesitation, 
be founded on necessary principles? In which case, the cause and the basis 
of the assertion of the universal belief held by these scholars are the neces-
sary and categorical principles resulting from the great number of times 
the angels and spirit beings have been observed and seen, which demon-
strates the strength of the consensus.

Furthermore,  is  it  all  possible,  rational  or  feasible  that  the  unanimous 
testimony and agreement of the prophets and saints, who are like the suns, 
moons, and stars in human society, and the strength of their consensus con-
cerning the existence of the angels and spirit beings and their actually seeing 
them,  should  be  prey  to  doubts  or  be  the  object  of  suspicion?  Especially 
since they are qualiﬁed to speak in this matter. It is obvious that two people 
who are qualiﬁed to speak on a matter are preferable to thousands who are 
not. Moreover, in this question they are afﬁrming a matter, and it is well-
known that two people who afﬁrm a matter are preferable to thousands who 
deny or reject it.

Is it at all possible for there to be any doubt especially concerning the 
pronouncements of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, the Sun of Suns in 
the world of truths, which never at any time sets, shining continuously in the 
skies of the universe? And can there be doubt concerning the testimony and 
witnessings of the Muhammadan Being ( UWBP ), the Sun of Prophethood?
Since, if on a single occasion the existence of a single spirit being is veri-
ﬁed, this demonstrates the actual existence of the whole species; and since 
it proves the existence of the whole species to be true, for sure, the best and 
most rational and acceptable form of their real existence will be similar to 
that expounded by the Shari‘a, described by the Qur’an, and seen by the One 
who made the Ascension.

Fourth Fundamental Point

576

THE WORDS

FOURTH FUNDAMENTAL POINT

If the creatures of the universe are observed with care, it may be seen that 
like particulars, universals have collective identities, each of which appears 
as a universal function; it is apparent that each performs a universal duty. 
For example, just as a ﬂower as itself displays an embroidery full of art and 
with the tongue of its being recites the Creator’s names, so the garden of 
the globe resembles a ﬂower and performs an extremely orderly, universal 
duty of gloriﬁcation. And just as a fruit issues a proclamation expressing its 
gloriﬁcation of Allah within an order and regularity, so does a mighty tree 
in its entirety have a most orderly natural duty and worship. And just as a 
tree gloriﬁes Allah through the words of its fruits, ﬂowers and  leaves, so do 
the vast oceans of the heavens glorify the All-Glorious Creator and praise 
the Sublime Maker through their suns, moons, and stars, which are like their 
words;  and  so  on.  Although  external  beings  are  outwardly  inanimate  and 
unconscious, they all perform extremely vital, living, and conscious duties 
and gloriﬁcation. Of a certainty, therefore, just as angels are their representa-
tives expressing their gloriﬁcation in the World of the Inner Dimensions of 
Things, so are they the counterparts, dwellings, and mosques of those angels 
in the external and manifest world.

As  is  explained  in  the  Fourth  Branch  of  the  Twenty-Fourth  Word,  the 
ﬁrst of the four categories of workers employed by the All-Glorious Maker 
of  the  palace  of  this  world  is  that  of  the  angels  and  spirit  beings.  Since, 
without knowing it, plants and inanimate beings perform extremely impor-
tant though wageless duties at the command of One Who does know; also 
without  knowing  it,  animals  serve  extensive  universal  aims  in  return  for 
an insigniﬁcant wage; and since, observedly, in return for two wages, one 
immediate and the other postponed, human beings, knowing the All-Glori-
ous Maker’s aims, are employed by their conforming to them, their taking a 
share of everything for themselves, and their supervising the other servants; 
certainly, the servants and workers will be the fourth, rather, the ﬁrst cat-
egory. The latter both resemble human beings in that knowing the universal 
aims of the All-Glorious Maker, they conform to them through worship, and 
they are contrary to human beings. For being beyond sensual pleasure and 
some partial wage, they consider sufﬁcient the pleasure, perfection, delight 
and  bliss  they  experience  from  the  All-Glorious  Maker’s  attention,  com-
mand,  favour,  consideration,  and  name,  through  their  perception  of  Him, 
connection with Him, and proximity to Him. They labour with the purest 
sincerity, their duties of worship varying according to their different kinds, 
and according to the varieties of the creatures in the universe. 

TWENTY-NINTH WORD – FIRST AIM

577

Like in a government there are various ofﬁcials in the various ofﬁces, so 
too the duties of worship and gloriﬁcation vary in the spheres of the realm of 
dominicality. For example, through the power, strength, reckoning and com-
mand of Allah Almighty, the Archangel Michael is like the general overseer 
of Allah’s creatures sown in the ﬁeld of the face of the earth. If one may 
say  so,  he  is  the  head  of  the  angels  that  resemble  farmers.  And,  through 
the  permission,  command,  power,  and  wisdom  of  the  All-Glorious  Crea-
tor, the incorporeal shepherds of the animals have a head, a supreme angel 
appointed to the task.

Thus, since it is necessary for there to be an angel appointed to each of 
these external creatures in order to represent in the World of the Inner  Dimen-
sions of Things the duties of worship and service of gloriﬁcation which it 
performs, and to present them knowingly at the divine court, the way the 
angels are described in the narrations of the Bringer of Sure News ( UWBP ) 
is certainly most appropriate and rational. For example, he declared: “ There 
are some angels which have either forty, or forty thousand, heads. In each 
of the heads are forty thousand mouths, and with the forty thousand tongues 
in each of those mouths they glorify Allah in forty thousand ways. ” This 
Hadith expresses a truth, and both contains a meaning, and has a form or 
manner of expression. Its meaning is as follows:

The angels’ worship is both orderly and perfect, and universal and com-

prehensive. As for the form of the truth, it is this:

There are certain mighty corporeal beings that perform their duties of 
worship with forty thousand heads in forty thousand ways. For example, 
the  heavens  glorify  Allah  with  the  suns  and  the  stars.  While  the  earth, 
which is a single being, performs its duty of worship, its dominical gloriﬁ-
cation, with a hundred thousand heads and with the hundreds of thousands 
of mouths in each head, and with the hundreds of thousands of tongues in 
each mouth. Thus, the angel appointed to the globe of the earth has to be 
envisaged in this way in order to display this meaning in the World of the 
Inner Dimensions of Things.

I myself, even, saw a medium-sized almond tree which had close on forty 
large branches resembling heads. When I looked at one branch, I saw it had 
nearly forty smaller branches like tongues. Then I looked at one tongue of one 
of those small branches; forty ﬂowers had opened on it. I studied the ﬂowers 
considering the wisdom in them, and saw in each close on forty exquisite, 
well-ordered stamens, colours, and arts, each of which proclaimed one of the 
All-Glorious  Maker’s  names  and  their  constantly  varying  manifestations. 

578

THE WORDS

Is it at all possible that the All-Wise and Beauteous One, Who is the All-
Glorious Maker of the almond tree, would impose this many duties on an 
inanimate tree, and not mount on it an appointed angel appropriate to it, to 
be like its spirit, to understand and express its meaning, proclaim it to the 
universe, and present it at the divine court?

O friend! So far, our explanation has been an introduction to bring the 
heart to acceptance, to compel the soul to submit, and to induce the reason 
to understand. If you have understood it to some degree and wish to meet 
with  the  angels,  prepare  yourself.  Moreover,  purify  yourself  of  wrongful 
prejudice. Now look, the doors of the Qur’an’s world are open! Look, the

Second Aim 

The Second Aim is about the resurrection of the dead, the end of the 
world,  and  the  life  of  the  hereafter.  It  consists  of  four  fundamental 
points, and an introduction which is in the form of a comparison.

Introduction

INTRODUCTION

If someone was to claim about a palace or a city: “ This palace or city will 
be destroyed, and will then be repaired and reconstructed so that it is intact, ” 
six questions would surely arise in the face of his claim.

The First

The First: Why should it be destroyed? Is there a reason or something to 

necessitate it? If the answer is “ Yes, ” he would have to prove it.

The Second

The Second: A question such as the following would arise: “ Does the 
builder who would destroy and then reconstruct it possess the power to do 
so? Would he be capable of it? ” If the answer is “ Yes, ” he would have to 
prove it.

The Third

The Third: The following such question would arise: “ Is its destruction 
possible? And, is it going to be destroyed in the future? ” If the answer is 
“ Yes, ” and if he proves both the possibility of the destruction and its occur-
rence, the following two further questions would arise: “ Is it possible for 
this strange palace or city to be reconstructed from scratch, I wonder? If it 
is possible, will it be reconstructed? ” If the answer is “ Yes ” and he proves 
these as well, then in no aspect or corner of this matter can a gap or chink 
remain through which any doubt, misgiving or suspicion might enter.

Thus, like in the comparison, there are facts necessitating the destruction 
and  reconstruction  of  the  palace  of  the  earth  and  city  of  the  universe.  Its 
author and builder is powerful enough; its destruction is possible, and will 
occur. Its reconstruction is possible, and will occur. These matters will be 
proved after the First Fundamental Point.

First Fundamental Point

FIRST FUNDAMENTAL POINT

The human spirit is deﬁnitely immortal. Almost all the indications in 
the First Aim which point to the existence of the angels and spirit beings 
also point to the immortality of the human spirit, which is our topic here. 
In my opinion, the matter is so certain that further explanation would be 
proﬁtless. Indeed, the distance between us and the caravans of innumerable  

580

THE WORDS

immortal spirits who are waiting to go to the hereafter in the Intermediate 
and Spirit Worlds is so ﬁne and slight that there is no need to demonstrate it 
with proofs. Numberless saints and people of illumination getting in touch 
with them, and those who discern the secrets of the grave seeing them, and 
even a number of ordinary people communicating with them, and the mass 
of people forming relations with them in true dreams, have formed a mass 
of unanimous reports and have quite simply become part of the commonly 
accepted knowledge of humankind. However, because materialist thought 
has stupiﬁed everyone this age, it has been able to implant doubts in their 
minds concerning even the most evident matters. In order to remove these 
doubts, therefore, we shall set forth an introduction and four sources from 
the  numerous  sources  springing  from  the  heart’s  intuition  and  the  intel-
lect’s insight.

Introduction

INTRODUCTION:  As  is  proved  in  the  Fourth  Truth  of  the  Tenth 
Word, an eternal, everlasting, and peerless beauty requires the eternity and 
permanence  of  mirror-bearing  enraptured  admirers.  A  faultless,  eternal, 
and perfect art seeks the perpetuation of thoughtful heralds. A boundless 
mercy and beneﬁcence require the continued ease and happiness of needy 
ones  to  thank  it.  And  the  foremost  of  those  mirror-bearing  enraptured 
admirers, those heralding thoughtful ones, those needy thankful ones is the 
human spirit, in which case, it will accompany that beauty, that perfection, 
that mercy on the endless road to eternity; it will be immortal.

As  is  also  proved  in  the  Tenth  Word,  in  the  Sixth  Truth,  not  only  the 
human spirit, but also the simplest levels of existence have not been created 
for extinction; they manifest a form of immortality. Even an insigniﬁcant 
ﬂower, which has no spirit, manifests a sort of immortality in a thousand 
ways when it quits its external existence. For its form is made permanent in 
countless memories. And being perpetuated in its hundreds of seeds, the law 
of its formation continues. Since the ﬂower’s law of formation, the model 
of its form, which resembles a tiny fragment of spirit, is made permanent 
by  an  All-Wise  Preserver;  and  since  it  is  preserved  throughout  turbulent 
transformations  with  perfect  order  in  its  tiny  seeds  and  made  permanent; 
you should understand the degree to which the human spirit, which has an 
extremely  comprehensive  and  elevated  nature,  and  has  been  clothed  with 
external  existence,  and  is  a  conscious,  living,  and  luminous  commanding 
law,  most  certainly  manifests  immortality  and  is  tied  to  eternity  and  con-
nected to endless time; if you do not understand this, how can you claim to 
be a conscious human being? Can it be asked of an All-Wise One of Glory, 

TWENTY-NINTH WORD – SECOND AIM

581

an Imperishable Preserver, Who includes and preserves in the  tiny dot-like 
seed of a mighty tree the programme and law of its formation, which to some 
degree resembles a spirit, “ How can He preserve the spirits of the dead? ”

First Source

FIRST SOURCE: This is subjective. That is to say, if anyone studies his 
own life and self, he perceives an immortal spirit. Indeed, despite changing 
bodies as many times as the years it lives, the spirit self-evidently remains 
constant. In which case, the body’s ephemerality does not affect the spirit’s 
permanence, nor spoil its nature, even though the spirit is completely naked 
at death. However, in the course of life, the spirit gradually changes its body-
clothes, and at the time of death, it is suddenly undressed. It has been estab-
lished by virtue of certain intuition, indeed, as a result of observation, that 
the body subsists though the spirit; in which case, the spirit does not subsist 
through the body. Rather, since the spirit subsists and is dominant of itself, 
the body may be dispersed and gathered together again as it wishes; it will 
not infringe the spirit’s independence.

In fact, the body is the spirit’s house, it is its home; it is not its clothes. 
What clothes the spirit is a subtle, ﬁne sheath, something which may be lik-
ened to a body, is to some extent constant, and is ethereal and appropriate 
for the spirit. At the time of death, then, the spirit is not completely naked, it 
leaves its home dressed in its wraithlike sheath.

Second Source

SECOND  SOURCE:  This  is  objective.  That  is  to  say,  it  is  a  sort  of 
empirical judgement which has arisen due to repeated observations, numer-
ous occurrences of events, and relations on many occasions. Indeed, when it 
is understood that a single spirit continues to exist after death, this necessi-
tates the continued existence of all spirits as a category of being. For accord-
ing to the science of logic it is certain that if an intrinsic quality is observed 
in a single individual, the existence of that quality may be assumed in all 
individuals. Because it is intrinsic. If it is intrinsic, it will be present in each 
individual.  Whereas  the  indications  based  on  not  one  observation  but  on 
observations  beyond  calculation  and  count  and  the  signs  pointing  to  the 
immortality of spirits, are so deﬁnite that we can in no way doubt their exist-
ence. Just as for us there is a place called the New World, that is, America, 
and we cannot doubt that human beings are found there. In the same way, it 
is unacceptable to doubt that the spirits of the dead are now present in great 
numbers in the World of the Inner Dimension of Things and in the Spirit 
World, and that they have relations with us. Our immaterial gifts go to them 
and their luminous emanations come to us.

582

THE WORDS

Moreover,  one  may  perceive  intuitively  and  certainly  with  one’s  con-
science  that  a  fundamental  aspect  of  human  beings  continues  after  death. 
And  that  fundamental  aspect  is  spirit.  As  for  spirit,  it  is  not  subject  to 
destruction and dissolution. This is because it is simple and uncompounded, 
it has unity. As for destruction, dissolution, and decomposition, they are the 
function of complex and compound substances. As we explained above, life 
ensures a form of unity within multiplicity; it causes a sort of permanence. 
That is to say, unity and permanence are fundamental to spirit, from which 
they spread to multiplicity.

The mortality of the human spirit would occur either through destruction 
and  dissolution,  whereas  unity  provides  no  opportunity  for  these,  and  its 
simple nature disallows decomposition; or it would be through annihilation. 
But  the  limitless  compassion  of  the  Absolutely  Generous  One  would  not 
permit annihilation, and His boundless muniﬁcence would not allow that He 
should take back from the human spirit the bounty of existence which He 
has bestowed on it, which it ardently desires and of which it is worthy.

Third Source

THIRD SOURCE: The human spirit, which has been clothed in a living, 
conscious, luminous external existence, is a comprehensive and veracious 
commanding law disposed to acquiring universality. Even the weakest com-
manding  laws  manifest  stability  and  permanence.  For  if  considered  care-
fully, it will be seen that present in all species which are subject to change, 
is a constant truth that, revolving within the changes, transformations, and 
stages of life, causes the outer forms of things to change, and yet living and 
not dying, is permanent.

Thus, while being an individual, the human person resembles a species  
owing to the comprehensiveness of his nature, his universal consciousness, 
and all-embracing imagination. A law that governs and is in force in the spe-
cies is also in force in the human individual. Since the All-Glorious Creator 
has created man as a comprehensive mirror, for universal worship, and with 
an exalted nature, even if the spirit-truth which is present in each individual 
causes his outer form to change hundreds of thousands of times, with the 
Sustainer’s permission it will not die but will continue, departing as it came. 
In which case, at Allah’s command and with His permission and through His 
making it permanent, the human individual’s spirit, which is the conscious 
element and living part of him, is immortal.

Fourth Source

FOURTH SOURCE: Consider the laws that govern in species, for they 
resemble  the  spirit  to  a  degree:  they  issue  from  the  World  of  the  Divine 
Command and Will and so by virtue of their source they are to some extent 

TWENTY-NINTH WORD – SECOND AIM

583

appropriate for the spirit. But if only the laws governing in species that lack 
sensory  perception  are  observed  and  studied,  it  will  be  seen  that  if  those 
commanding laws were clothed  in external existence, each of them would 
become  the  spirit  of  one  of  those  species.  Moreover,  the  laws  are  always 
permanent;  they  are  perpetual  and  constant.  No  change  or  transformation 
affects their unity, or spoils them.

For example, should a ﬁg tree die and be dispersed, the law of its for-
mation, which is like its spirit, will persist in its tiny seeds; it will not die. 
Therefore, since even commonplace and weak commanding laws are thus 
connected to permanence and continuance, the human spirit must be con-
nected not only with permanence and immortality, but with all eternity. For 
according to the Qur’an’s glorious decree of:

( 17:85 ) È Ç Æ Å Ä
spirit too is a conscious and living law which proceeds from the World of 
the Divine Command and which pre-eternal power has clothed with exter-
nal  existence.  That  is  to  say,  just  as  the  unconscious  laws  which  proceed 
from the divine attribute of will and the World of the Divine Command are 
always, or mostly, enduring, so it is even more deﬁnite that the spirit mani-
fests immortality, for it is a sort of brother to them and like them is a mani-
festation of the attribute of will and comes from the World of the Command. 
It is also more worthy of it, because it is existent, it has an external reality. 
And it is more potent, more elevated, because it possesses consciousness. 
It is also more enduring than them, and more valuable, because it is living.

Second Fundamental Point

SECOND FUNDAMENTAL POINT

There are matters necessitating eternal happiness, and the All-Glorious 
Agent is capable of bestowing such happiness. Also, the destruction of the 
universe and death of the world are possible, and they will occur. And the 
resurrection of the world and the Last Judgement are possible, and they will 
occur. We shall explain all these six matters brieﬂy and in such a way as to 
satisfy the reason. In fact, in the Tenth Word, arguments are presented which 
raise the heart to the level of perfect belief, while here, we shall discuss them 
in  the  manner  of  the  Old  Said’s  explanations  in  his  treatise  called  N o k t a  
( The Point ), which convince and silence the reason only.

There are matters which necessitate eternal happiness. A decisive argu-
ment  proving  those  matters  consists  of  an  intuition  ﬁltered  through  ten 
sources and central points.

First Point

584

THE WORDS

F i r s t   P o i n t :  If observed carefully, it will be seen that a perfect and inten-
tional order embraces the whole universe. Traces of choice and ﬂashes of 
purpose are to be seen in every aspect of it. What strikes the eyes through 
the testimony of their fruits is that in everything is a light of intention; in 
every function, a ﬂash of will; in every motion, a gleam of choice; in every 
composite whole, a blaze of wisdom. Thus, if there were no eternal happi-
ness, this authentic order would merely consist of a weak and futile form. It 
would be a false, baseless order, not a true order. Connections and relations 
and immaterial things, which are the spirit of order, would be lost and come 
to nothing. That is to say, what gives order to order is eternal happiness. In 
which case, the order of the universe points to eternal happiness.

Second Point

S e c o n d   P o i n t :   Total  wisdom  is  apparent  in  the  universe’s  creation. 
Indeed,  divine  wisdom,  which  is  the  representation  of  pre-eternal  provi-
dence,  proclaims  eternal  happiness  with  the  tongue  of  the  observance  of 
beneﬁts  and  following  of  purposes  demonstrated  by  the  universe  in  its 
entirety. For if there were no eternal happiness, it would be necessary, out of 
pride, to deny the wisdom and beneﬁts that are self-evidently constant in the 
universe. Since the Tenth Truth of the Tenth Word demonstrates this truth 
as clearly as the sun, so we shall content ourselves with that and cut short 
the discussion here.

Third Point

T h i r d   P o i n t :  The absence of futility and absence of waste in the creation 
of beings, established by the testimony of reason, wisdom, induction, and 
experience, indicate eternal happiness. The sign of there being no waste and 
nothing vain in creation is the All-Glorious Maker’s choosing and preferring 
the shortest way, the closest point, the lightest form, and the best manner in 
the creation of everything, and His sometimes imposing a hundred duties 
on one thing, and His attaching a thousand fruits and aims to a slight being. 
Since  there  is  no  waste  and  nothing  in  vain,  there  will  surely  be  eternal 
happiness. For non-existence and no return would make everything futile; 
everything would be a waste. The absence of waste in all creation, and in 
man  for  instance,  which  is  established  by  the  sciences  of  physiology  and 
anatomy, demonstrates that his limitless immaterial inclinations, and inﬁnite 
hopes,  ideas,  and  desires  will  not  be  wasted  either.  In  which  case,  man’s 
deep-rooted desire to be perfected points to the existence of a perfection, and 
his desire for happiness proclaims that he is deﬁnitely destined for eternal 
happiness.  If  it  were  not  so,  contrary  to  other  beings,  which  are  all  made 
wisely and purposefully, those authentic immaterial faculties, those elevated 
hopes, which constitute man’s true nature, would go to waste and be futile; 

TWENTY-NINTH WORD – SECOND AIM

585

they would wither up and go for nothing. Since this truth is proved in the 
Eleventh Truth of the Tenth Word, we cut the discussion short here.

Fourth Point

F o u r t h   P o i n t :   In  each  of  many  different  things,  in  night  and  day  and 
winter and spring, in the skies, and even in the human person and in the bod-
ies which he changes throughout his lifetime, and in sleep, which resembles 
death, is a different sort of resurrection resembling the resurrection of the 
dead; they all tell of and allude to the realization of Resurrection Day. For 
example, the day, year, lifetime of man, and revolution of Allah’s great clock 
known as the world resemble the dials of a weekly clock of ours that tell the 
seconds, minutes, hours and days; each the forerunner of the following, they 
give news of one another; they turn and function. Just as they show morn-
ing after night and spring after winter, so they intimate that after death the 
morning of the resurrection will appear from that instrument, that vast clock.
There are many varieties of resurrection that a person experiences during 
his lifetime. He sees the signs of the resurrection by dying in a sort of way 
every night and being reborn every morning; it is agreed that he undergoes 
what resembles a resurrection every ﬁve or six years by changing all the par-
ticles in his body; and he even undergoes a gradual resurrection twice a year. 
Also, every spring he witnesses more than three hundred thousand sorts of 
resurrection and rising to life in the animal and plant species. So many signs 
and indications and marks of resurrection most certainly point to the great 
resurrection of the dead as though they were droplets of it. 

An indication of a personal resurrection of the human being within the 
general resurrection may be the fact that an All-Wise Maker causes a sort 
of  resurrection  in  the  animal  and  plant  worlds,  that  is,  He  raises  to  life 
exactly the same plant roots and some animals in the spring, and restores 
other parts of them, such as their leaves, ﬂowers and fruits not exactly the 
same but similarly. For the human being resembles a species in compari-
son with the other species, and the light of the human mind has given such 
a breadth to man’s actions and thought that they encompass the past and 
the future. If he consumes the world even, he is not satisﬁed. In the other 
species  the  individual  being’s  nature  is  particular;  its  value  is  personal; 
its  view,  restricted;  its  qualities,  limited;  its  pleasure  and  pain,  instanta-
neous.  Whereas  man’s  nature  is  exalted;  his  value,  most  high;  his  view, 
universal; his qualities, limitless; his immaterial pleasure and pain in part 
unceasing. In which case, the various resurrections which are repeated in 
the other animate species self-evidently tell of and point to human beings 
being resurrected individually and restored to life exactly the same in the

great resurrection of the dead. Since it is proved with the certainty of twice 
two equalling four in the Ninth Truth of the Tenth Word, we cut short the 
discussion here.

Fifth Point

F i f t h   P o i n t :   Those  who  have  looked  closely  into  the  realities  of  crea-
tion consider that the unlimited potentialities included in the essence of the 
human  spirit,  and  the  unlimited  abilities  contained  in  those  potentialities, 
and the endless desires arising from those abilities, and the inﬁnite hopes  
resulting  from  those  endless  desires,  and  the  limitless  thoughts  and  ideas 
born of those inﬁnite hopes to be hands stretched out towards eternal happi-
ness, which is beyond this Manifest World, and eyes gazing at it; that they 
are turned towards it. Thus, human nature, which cannot lie, and the deﬁnite, 
intense, unwavering desire for eternal happiness in human nature inspire the 
conscience  with  certainty  concerning  the  realization  of  eternal  happiness. 
This fact is demonstrated as clearly as daylight in the Eleventh Truth of the 
Tenth Word, and so we cut this short here.

Sixth Point

S i x t h   P o i n t :  The mercy of these beings’ All-Beauteous Maker, the All-
Merciful, All-Compassionate, points to eternal happiness. Yes, since such 
mercy makes bounty bounty and saves it from causing distress, it is in its 
nature  not  to  withhold  eternal  happiness  from  man,  for  it  delivers  beings 
from the anguish of eternal separation. For if eternal happiness, the head, 
chief, aim, and result of all bounties, is not given, and if after dying the world 
is not resurrected in the form of the hereafter, all bounties would be trans-
formed  into  torment.  And  such  a  transformation  would  necessitate  deny-
ing the existence of divine mercy, which is self-evident and necessary and 
according to the testimony of the whole universe, unquestionable and mani-
fest. It is an established truth more brilliant than the sun. Look and take note 
of the bounties of love, compassion, and reason, some of the manifestations 
and  subtle  traces  of  mercy.  Suppose  that  eternal  separation  and  unending 
parting are the outcome of human life; you will see that tender love becomes 
a great calamity; sweet compassion, a great misfortune; luminous reason, a 
great tribulation. That is to say, mercy ( because it is mercy ) cannot confront 
true love with eternal separation. Since the Second Truth of the Tenth Word 
has demonstrated this fact quite beautifully, we cut this short here.

Seventh Point

S e v e n t h   P o i n t :  All the exquisiteness, all the virtues, all the perfections, 
all the attraction, all the yearning, all the compassion known and seen in the 
universe are meanings, signiﬁcations, immaterial words. They necessarily 
and self-evidently show to the heart and thrust in the mind’s eye the mani-
festations  of  the  All-Glorious  Maker’s  favour  and  kindness,  benevolence 

TWENTY-NINTH WORD – SECOND AIM

587

and muniﬁcence. Since there is a truth, a reality, in this world, most certainly 
there is true mercy. And since there is true mercy, there will be eternal hap-
piness.  The  Fourth  Truth  of  the  Tenth  Word,  and  also  the  Second  Truth, 
have illuminated this fact as clearly as daylight.

Eighth Point

Ninth Point

E i g h t h   P o i n t :  Man’s conscience, which is his conscious nature, looks to 
and points to eternal happiness. Yes, if anyone listens to his own awakened 
conscience, he will hear a voice crying: “ Eternity! Eternity! ” Even if the 
whole universe were to be given to such a conscience, it could not  satisfy its 
need for eternity. That is to say, the conscience is created for eternity. That 
is to say, the fact that the conscience is attracted and drawn in this way is 
possible only because it is attracted by a true aim and captivating truth. The 
conclusion of the Eleventh Truth of the Tenth Word demonstrates this fact.
N i n t h   P o i n t :   This  is  the  message  of  Muhammad  the  Arabian  ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ), who was truthful, veracious, and trustwor-
thy. Indeed, his words opened the doors of eternal happiness; all that he said 
are windows opening onto everlasting bliss. In fact, he held in his hand the 
consensus of all the prophets ( Upon whom be peace ) and the unanimous 
agreement of all the saints, for after divine unity, all their calls and efforts 
were concentrated on the resurrection of the dead and eternal happiness. Is 
there anything that could shake such a strength? The Twelfth Truth of the 
Tenth Word demonstrates this truth self-evidently.

Tenth Point

T e n t h   P o i n t :  This is the certain news of the Qur’an of Miraculous Expo-
sition, which has preserved its miraculousness in seven respects for thirteen 
centuries and as is proved in the Twenty-Fifth Word, is a miracle through its 
forty sorts of miraculousness. Yes, this news of the Qur’an is the revealer of 
bodily resurrection, and the discloser of the enigmatic talisman of the world, 
and the key to the wisdom in the universe. Also, the certain rational proofs 
contained in the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, which it lays before the 
eyes commanding that they be pondered over are thousands in number. In 
short, the Qur’an presents for human beings to study a great many verses and 
great many telescopes revealing eternal bliss, such as the following.

 ( 71:14 ) 9 8 7

588

and,

  ( 36:79 ) v u t s r q 

which the Qur’an makes clear through other verses. It was as follows:

On  passing  from  stage  to  stage,  the  human  body  undergoes  wondrous 
and orderly transformations. From sperm to a blood-clot; from a blood-clot 
to ﬂesh and bone; from ﬂesh and bone to a new creation, that is, the trans-
formation into human form; it follows extremely precise rules. Each of these 
stages has such particular laws, such determined order, such regular devel-
opment  that  it  displays  the  manifestations  of  a  purpose,  will,  choice,  and 
wisdom as though through glass.

Thus, the All-Wise Maker, Who creates the body in this way, changes it 
every year as if it were clothes. For the body to be changed and for its contin-
uance, a compound is necessary so that new particles appear that will work 
and ﬁll the place of the parts that are dissolved. Since the body’s cells are 
destroyed through an orderly divine law, it requires a subtle matter, known 
as sustenance, to repair it, again through an orderly dominical law. The True 
Provider  allots  and  distributes  the  sustenance  through  a  particular  law  in 
relation to the different needs of the body’s members.

Now,  consider  the  behaviour  of  the  subtle  matter  which  the  All-Wise 
Provider sends: you will see that while the matter’s particles are dispersed 
through the air, soil, and water like a caravan, they suddenly gather together 
in  a  way  that  suggests  a  deliberate  action,  as  though  they  had  suddenly 
received  the  order  to  move.  They  collect  together  in  orderly  fashion  as  if 
each particle of them were entrusted with a duty and ordered to proceed to 
a speciﬁed place. Also, it is apparent from their conduct that they are being 
propelled through a particular law of a being who acts and has choice, and 
from the realm of the inanimate are entering the animal kingdom. Then they 
enter a body as sustenance through a particular rule and with a determined 
order and in a regular process, and after being cooked in the four kitchens 
of the body, undergoing four amazing transformations, and being strained 
through four ﬁlters, they are apportioned through regular laws and the benef-
icence of the True Provider according to the all-different needs of the mem-
bers and are circulated to every part of the body.

TWENTY-NINTH WORD – SECOND AIM

589

Thus,  whichever  of  these  particles  you  consider  with  the  eye  of  wis-
dom, you will see that blind chance, lawless coincidence, deaf nature, and 
unconscious causes can in no way interfere with it; it is impelled in a dis-
cerning, orderly, hearing, and knowing fashion. For whichever stage each 
of them enters from the surrounding element to the body’s cell, it acts as 
though voluntarily through the speciﬁed laws of that stage. It enters it in an 
orderly fashion. To whichever level it journeys, it steps with such order that 
it appears self-evidently to be proceeding at the command of an All-Wise 
Mover. In this way, it gradually advances from stage to stage, and level to 
level until, at the command of its Sustainer, without deviating from  its aim 
and object, it reaches its appropriate position, for example the pupil of Tev-
ﬁk’s eye, where at the divine command it establishes itself and works.

This  situation,  that  is,  the  manifestation  of  dominicality  in  sustenance, 
demonstrates that ﬁrst the particles were determined; they were appointed to 
the task, they were designated to those positions. It is as if the existence of 
an arrangement and order, like “ This will be the sustenance of so-and-so’s 
cells ” being written on the forehead of each of them, points to each person’s 
sustenance being written on his forehead by the pen of divine determining, 
and his name being written on his sustenance. Is it at all possible that the 
All-Glorious Maker, Who nurtures and sustains with boundless power and 
all-encompassing wisdom, Who has absolute disposal over all beings from 
minute particles to the planets and spins them with order and balance, should 
not bring about the last creation, or that he should be unable to do so?

Thus,  many  verses  of  the  Qur’an  present  to  mankind’s  view  this  wise 
ﬁrst creation; comparing the last creation at the resurrection of the dead and 
Great Gathering to the ﬁrst, it removes doubt and uncertainty. It says: 

( 36:79 )   v u t s r q 
That is, the One Who created you from nothing in so wise a form is He Who 
will bring you to life again in the hereafter. And it says:

( 30:27 ) E D C B A @ ? > =  
That is, “ Your return and being raised to life at the resurrection is easier and 
more trouble-free than your creation in this world. ”

It  is  easier  and  more  trouble-free  than  forming  a  new  regiment  from 
scratch for the soldiers of a regiment who have dispersed to rest to regather 
under the regimental ﬂag at the sound of a bugle. Similarly, according to rea-
son, it is easier and more possible than the ﬁrst creation for the fundamental 

590

THE WORDS

particles of a body, which are intermingled and familiar and connected with 
one another, to regather at the trumpet-blast of the angel Israﬁl ( Upon whom 
be peace ) replying to the All-Glorious Creator’s command with, “ Here we 
are, O Lord! ” Anyway, it may not necessary for all the particles to regather. 
It may be that sufﬁcient as a basis of the second creation will be the funda-
mental parts and essential particles, which resemble nuclei and seeds and in 
a Hadith are called  ِبَ(cid:178)َ
ّذ(cid:170)ا  ُبْ(cid:107)َ(cid:150) ( the coccyx ). 1 The All-Wise Creator may 
construct the human body on them.

The  following  is  a  summary  of  the  judicial  comparison  indicated  by 

verses like this third one:

( 41:46 ) ì ë ê é
We often see in this world that tyrannical, sinful and cruel men pass their 
lives  in  ease  and  comfort,  while  the  oppressed,  upright  and  religious  live 
under great difﬁculties and in degradation. Then death comes and makes the 
two equal. If this equality was endless and not ﬁnite, an injustice would be 
apparent. However, since divine wisdom and justice are free of all injustice 
as is established by the testimony of the universe and could in no way accept 
such tyranny, they self-evidently require a ﬁnal assembly where the former 
will be punished and the latter will receive their reward. Then disorderly, 
wretched men may receive punishment and reward in conformity with their 
potentialities, be the means of absolute justice, manifest dominical wisdom, 
and be the elder brother of all the beings in the world.

For sure, the realm of this world does not allow for the blossoming of 
man’s limitless potentialities contained within his spirit. This means he will 
be sent to another world. Man’s essence is indeed mighty, so he is desig-
nated for eternity. His nature is exalted, so his crimes are great. He does not 
resemble other beings. His order is important, too. He cannot live without 
order. He cannot live aimlessly. He cannot be made in vain. He cannot be 
condemned to absolute extinction. He cannot escape to pure non-existence. 
Hell  has  opened  its  mouth,  and  awaits  him.  And  Paradise  has  opened  its 
graceful  embrace,  and  watches  him.  Since  the  Third  Truth  of  the  Tenth 
Word has demonstrated these two examples most beautifully, we shall here 
cut the discussion short.

By way of example, you may make analogies and study other verses from 
the Qur’an similar to the two above, which contain many subtle and rational 
proofs.

Thus, these Ten Sources and Central Points result in a certain intuition 
and a decisive proof, and just as this sound intuition and powerful proof are 
decisive evidence for the cause and necessity of the resurrection and Day 
of Judgement, so do most of the Glorious Maker’s most beautiful names, 
such as All-Wise, All-Compassionate, Preserver, and All-Just, require the 
coming of the Last Day and resurrection, and the existence of everlasting 
bliss; they point clearly to the realization of eternal happiness – as is clearly 
proved in the Tenth Word. That is to say, the matters necessitating the res-
urrection of the dead and Day of Judgement are so powerful as to leave no 
room at all for any doubt or uncertainty.

Third Fundamental Point

THIRD FUNDAMENTAL POINT

The Agent possesses the power. Without doubt, the matters necessitating 
the resurrection of the dead exist. Also, the One Who will bring it about is 
powerful to the utmost degree; there is no deﬁciency in His power; the great-
est things and the smallest are the same in relation to His power; it is as easy 
for Him to create the spring as to create a ﬂower. Yes, One so powerful that 
this world together with all its suns, stars, worlds, particles, and substance 
bear  witness  to  His  sublimity  and  power  with  endless  tongues.  Does  any 
doubt  or  misgiving  have  the  right  to  consider  bodily  resurrection  remote 
from such a power?

It  is  plain  to  see  that  every  century  within  this  world  an  All-Powerful 
One of Glory creates a new and orderly world. Every year even He creates 
a new, travelling, orderly universe. Indeed, He makes a new, well-ordered 
world every day. He perpetually creates and changes with perfect wisdom 
transient worlds and universes one after the other on the face of the heavens 
and the earth. He hangs on the string of time regular worlds to the number 
of  the  centuries,  years,  indeed,  days,  and  through  them  demonstrates  the 
tremendousness of His power. He attaches to the head of the globe the huge 
ﬂower of spring which he adorns with a hundred thousand embroideries of 
resurrection as though it were a single ﬂower, and through it displays the 
perfection of His wisdom and the beauty of His art. Can it be said of such a 
One, “ How can He bring about the resurrection of the dead, and how can He 
transform this world into the hereafter? ” The verse,

( 31:28 ) â á à ß Þ Ý Ü
proclaims  the  All-Powerful  One’s  perfect  power,  that  nothing  at  all  is 
difﬁcult  for  Him,  that  like  the  smallest  thing,  the  greatest  presents  no 
difﬁculties for His power, and that it is as easy for His power to create 

592

THE WORDS

innumerable individuals as to create as a single one. We have explained 
the verse’s essential meaning brieﬂy in the conclusion to the Tenth Word, 
and in detail in the treatise entitled Nokta ( The Point ), and in the Twen-
tieth Letter. In connection with the discussion here, we shall elucidate a 
part of it in the form of three matters, as follows:

Divine power is essential, in which case, impotence cannot intervene in 
it. Also, it is connected to the inner dimensions of things, so obstacles cannot 
become interpenetrated with it. Also, its relation is according to laws, due 
to which particulars are equal to universals and minor things become like 
comprehensive ones. We shall prove these three matters.

First Matter

FIRST MATTER: Pre-Eternal power is the necessary inherent quality 
of the Most Pure and Holy Divine Essence. That is to say, it is of necessity 
intrinsic to the Essence, it can in no way be separated from It. Since this is 
so,  the  Essence  which  necessitates  that  power  clearly  cannot  be  affected 
by  impotence,  the  opposite  to  power.  For  if  that  were  the  case,  it  would 
entail the combining of opposites. Since impotence cannot intervene in the 
Essence, self-evidently it cannot intervene in the power which is the inherent 
quality of that Essence. And since impotence cannot intervene in that essen-
tial power, clearly there can be no degrees in it. For the degrees of existence 
of a thing occur though the intervention of its opposites.

For  example,  the  degrees  of  heat  come  about  through  the  intervention 
of cold, and the degrees of beauty through the intervention of ugliness; fur-
ther  examples  can  be  made  in  the  same  way.  Since  in  contingent  beings 
such qualities are not true, natural, inherent and necessary, their opposites  
may enter into them. Then with the existence of degrees, diversity, variance, 
and change arose in the world. Since there can be no degrees in pre-eternal 
power, those things decreed by it will necessarily be the same in relation to 
it. The greatest will be equal to the smallest, and particles the same as the 
stars. The resurrection of all humankind will be as easy for that power as the 
raising to life of a single person; the creation of spring as easy as the giving 
of form to a single ﬂower. Whereas if attrib-uted to causes, the creation of a 
single ﬂower is as difﬁcult as the spring.

It has been proved in the footnote to the last section of the Fourth Degree 
of Allah is Most Great in the Second Station of this Word, and in the Twenty-
Second Word, and in the Twentieth Letter and in its Addendum, that when 
the  creation  of  beings  is  attributed  to  the  Single  One  of  Unity,  all  things 
become as easy as one thing. Whereas if they are attributed to causes, the 
creation of a single thing becomes as difﬁcult and problemat-ical as the crea-
tion of all things.

TWENTY-NINTH WORD – SECOND AIM

593

Second Matter

SECOND  MATTER:  Divine  power  is  related  to  the  inner  face  of 
things. Yes, the universe has two faces like a mirror. One is its external 
face, which resembles the coloured face of the mirror, the other is its inner 
face.  This  latter  resembles  the  mirror’s  shining  face.  Its  external  face  is 
the  arena  of  opposites;  it  is  where  such  matters  appear  as  beautiful  and 
ugly, good and evil, big and small, and difﬁcult and easy. It is because of 
this  that  the  All-Glorious  Maker  has  made  apparent  causes  a  veil  to  the 
disposal of His power, so that the hand of power should not appear to the 
mind to be in direct contact with matters that on the face of it are insigniﬁ-
cant or unworthy. For majesty and dignity require it to be thus. Neverthe-
less, He did not give true effects to causes and intermediaries, for the unity 
of oneness requires that they have none. 

As for the face of beings which looks to its Creator, in everything it is 
shining, it is clean. The colours and distortions of individuality do not inter-
vene in it. This aspect faces its Creator without intermediary. There are no 
chains or dispositions of causes in it. Cause and effect cannot intrude on it. 
It contains nothing contorted or askew. Obstacles cannot interfere in it. A 
particle becomes brother to the sun.

In Short: Divine power is both simple, and inﬁnite, and essential. The 
locus of divine power’s connection is without intermediary, stain, or rebel-
lion. Within the sphere of divine power, therefore, great has no superiority 
over small. The community has no primacy over the individual. Universals 
cannot expect more from divine power than particulars.

Third Matter

THIRD MATTER: Divine power’s relation is according to laws. That is 
to say, it regards many and few, great and small as the same. We shall make 
this abstruse matter easier to understand with a number of comparisons.

In the universe, Tr a n s p a r e n c y , R e c i p r o c i t y , B a l a n c e , O r d e r , D i s e n g a g e d -
n e s s , and  O b e d i e n c e  are all matters which render many equal to few, and 
great equal to small.

First Comparison

First Comparison: This explains the M y s t e r y   o f   Tr a n s p a r e n c y .
For  example,  the  sun’s  image  and  reﬂection,  which  are  the  effulgence 
of  its  manifestation,  display  the  same  identity  on  the  sea’s  surface  as  in 
every drop of the sea. If the globe of the earth were composed of varying 
fragments of glass and exposed to the sun without veil, the sun’s reﬂection 
would be the same in every fragment and on the whole face of the earth, 
without  obstruction  or  being  divided  into  pieces  or  being  diminished.  If, 
let  us  suppose,  the  sun  acted  with  will  and  through  its  will  conferred  the 

594

THE WORDS

radiance of its light and image of its reﬂection, it would be no more difﬁcult 
for it to confer its radiance on the whole surface of the earth than to confer 
it on a single particle.

Second Comparison

Second Comparison: This concerns the M y s t e r y   o f   R e c i p r o c i t y .
For  example,  let  us  suppose  there  is  a  vast  circle  composed  of  living 
beings, that is, of human beings, each holding a mirror. At its centre is one 
person holding a candle. The radiance and manifestation reﬂected in all the 
mirrors surrounding the central point will be the same, and its relation will 
be without obstacle, fragmentation or being diminished.

Third Comparison

Third Comparison: This concerns the M y s t e r y   o f   B a l a n c e .
For example, there are an enormous set of scales which are extremely 
accurate and sensitive. Whichever of two suns or two stars or two moun-
tains or two eggs or two particles are placed in its two pans, it will require  
the same force to raise one pan of those huge sensitive scales to the sky and 
lower the other to the ground.

Fourth Comparison

Fifth Comparison

Fourth Comparison: This concerns the M y s t e r y   o f   O r d e r .
For example, a huge ship can be turned as easily as a tiny toy boat.
Fifth Comparison: This concerns the M y s t e r y   o f   D i s e n g a g e d n e s s .
For example, a nature disengaged from individuality regards all particu-
lars from the smallest to the greatest as the same and enters them without 
being diminished or fragmented. The qualities present in the aspect of exter-
nal individuality do not interfere and cause confusion; they do not alter the 
view  of  a  disengaged  nature  such  as  that.  For  example,  a  needle-like  ﬁsh 
possesses a disengaged nature the same as a whale. Or a microbe bears an 
animal nature the same as a rhinoceros.

Sixth Comparison

Sixth Comparison: This demonstrates the M y s t e r y   o f   O b e d i e n c e .
For example, a commander causes a single private to advance with the 
command “ Forward march! ” the same as he causes an army to advance. The 
truth of the mystery of this comparison about obedience is as follows:

As  is  proved  by  experience,  everything  in  the  universe  has  a  point  of 
perfection, and everything has an inclination towards that point. Increased 
inclination becomes need. Increased need becomes desire. Increased desire 
becomes  attraction,  and  attraction,  desire,  need,  and  inclination  are  each 
seeds and kernels which, proceeding from the essences of things, conform 
to the creative commands of Almighty Allah. The absolute perfection of the 
true nature of contingent beings is absolute existence. Their particular per-
fections are an existence peculiar to each which makes its abilities emerge 

TWENTY-NINTH WORD – SECOND AIM

595

from the potential to the actual. Thus, the obedience of the whole universe 
to the divine command “ Be! ” is the same as that of a particle, which is like 
a single soldier. Present within the obedience and conformity of contingent 
beings to the pre-eternal command of “ Be! ” proceeding from the pre-eternal 
will are inclination, need, desire, and attraction, which are also manifesta-
tions of divine will. The fact that when subtle water receives the command 
to freeze, with a reﬁned inclination it may split a piece of iron demonstrates 
the strength of the mystery of obedience.

If these six comparisons are observed in the potentialities and actions of 
contingent beings, which are both defective, and ﬁnite, and weak, and have 
no actual effect, it will doubtless be seen that everything is equal in relation 
to pre-eternal power. For it is both inﬁnite, and pre-eternal, and post-eternal, 
and creates the whole universe out of pure non-existence, and being mani-
fested through the works of its tremendousness leaves all minds in wonder-
ment. Nothing at all can be difﬁcult for it. Such a power cannot be weighed 
on the small scales of these mysteries, neither are they proportionate. They  
have been mentioned to bring the subject closer to the understanding and to 
dispel any doubts.

Result and Summary

The Result and Summary of the
Third Fundamental Point

Since pre-eternal power is inﬁnite, and is the inherent, necessary qual-
ity  of  the  Most  Pure  and  Holy  Essence;  and  since  the  stainless,  veilless 
inner aspect of everything is turned to it and faces it, and is in balance with 
respect to contingency, which consists of the equal possibility of being and 
non-being; and since this inner face is obedient to the order of creation and 
the divine laws of the universe which form the Greater Shari‘a, the Shari‘a 
of Creation, and it is disengaged from and free of obstacles and different 
characteristics; certainly, like the smallest thing, the greatest cannot resist 
that power, nor expect more from it than the smallest. In which case, the 
raising to life of all beings with spirits at the resurrection will be no more 
difﬁcult for divine power than raising a ﬂy to life in the spring. Thus, the 
decree of:

( 31:28 ) â á à ß Þ Ý Ü
is no exaggeration; it is true and correct. And our claim that “ the Agent pos-
sesses the power ” has been proved true in decisive fashion; there is nothing 
to prevent it in this respect.

Fourth Fundamental Point

THE WORDS

FOURTH FUNDAMENTAL POINT

Just  as  there  are  things  necessitating  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  and 
Great Gathering, and the One Who will bring it about possesses the power 
to do so, so the world possesses the potential for the resurrection of the dead 
and Great Gathering. There are four matters in this assertion of mine that 
“ this place is possible. ”

T h e   F i r s t  is the possibility of this worldly realm’s death.
T h e   S e c o n d  is its actual death.
T h e   T h i r d   is  the  possibility  of  the  destroyed,  dead  world  being  recon-

structed and resurrected in the form of the hereafter.

T h e   F o u r t h  is its actual reconstruction and resurrection, which are pos-

sible.

First Matter

FIRST MATTER: The universe’s death is possible. For if something 
is included in the law of evolution and being perfected, there is bound to be 
growth and development in it. And if there is growth and development, that 
thing is bound to have a natural lifespan. And if it has a natural lifespan, 
there has to be a time for its natural death; it is established by inductive rea-
soning and extensive investigation that it cannot save itself from the  claws 
of death. Indeed, just as man is the microcosm and he cannot be saved from 
destruction, the world too is the macroanthropos; it cannot be saved from 
the clutches of death either. It too will die and will then be resurrected, or it 
will lie in repose and then open its eyes in the morning of the resurrection.
Also, just as a living tree, which is a miniature copy of the universe, can-
not save its life from destruction and dissolution, so the chain-like universe, 
which has branched out from the tree of creation, cannot save itself from 
destruction and dispersal in order to be repaired and renewed. If, with the

A Subtle, Allusive Matter

A Subtle, Allusive Matter

Just as water freezes to its own detriment, and ice melts to its own detri-
ment, and a kernel gains strength to the detriment of the shell, and a word 
becomes coarse to the detriment of the meaning, and the spirit weakens on 
account of the body, and the body becomes ﬁner on account of the spirit; so 
too this world, the dense world, becomes transparent and reﬁned with the 
functioning of the machine of life on account of the hereafter, which is the 
subtle world. The fact that creative power sprinkles the light of life on dense, 
lifeless, extinguished, dead objects with an astonishing activity is a sign of 
power that it dissolves, burns, and illuminates this dense world with the light 
of life on account of the subtle world, and strengthens its reality.

No matter how weak reality is, it does not die; it is not annihilated like a 
form. Rather, it travels in particular objects and forms. Reality grows, devel-
ops, and gradually expands, while the shell and the form wear out, become 
ﬁner, and break up. They are renewed in a better form so as to become suit-
able to the stature of the stable and expanded reality. In regard to increase 
and decrease, reality and form are in inverse proportion. That is to say, the  
more substantial form grows, the weaker reality becomes. The less substan-
tial form becomes, to that degree the reality grows stronger.

This  law  encompasses  all  things  included  in  the  law  of  evolution  or 
being perfected. It means that a time is certain to come when the Manifest 
World, which is the shell and form of the mighty reality of the universe, 
will break up with the permission of the All-Glorious Creator. Then it will 
be renewed in a better form. The meaning of the verse:

will be realized.

( 14:48 ) ...u t s r q

I n   S h o r t :  The death of the world is possible. Moreover, there can be no 

doubt that it is possible.

Second Matter

SECOND MATTER: This is the actual death of the world. The proof of 
this matter is the consensus of all the revealed religions; the testimony of all 
sound natures; the indication of all the changes, transformations, and altera-
tions  in  the  universe;  the  testimony  to  the  number  of  centuries  and  years 
through their deaths in this guesthouse of the world, of all living worlds and 
mobile worlds to the death of the world itself.

598

THE WORDS

If you want to imagine the death agonies of the world as the Qur’an’s 
verses show them to be, see how the parts of the universe are bound to one 
another with an exact, exalted order. They are held with such a hidden, deli-
cate, subtle bond and are so bound within an order that on a single one of the 
lofty heavenly bodies receiving the command: “ Be! ” or, “ Quit your orbit! ”, 
the world will go into its death agonies. The stars will collide, the heavenly 
bodies reel, a great din will strike up in inﬁnite space like the devastating 
sound of millions of cannonballs and great guns the size of globes. Clashing 
and colliding with one another, sending out showers of sparks, the moun-
tains taking ﬂight, the seas burning, the face of the earth will be ﬂattened.

With  this  death  and  those  agonies  the  Pre-Eternal  One  of  Power  will 
shake up the universe. He will purify the universe, and Hell and the mat-
ters of Hell will draw to one side, and Paradise and the matters appropriate 
for Paradise draw to the other, and the world of the hereafter will become 
manifest.

Third Matter

THIRD MATTER: The return to life of the world, which will die, is 
possible. For, as is proved in the Second Fundamental Point, there is no deﬁ-
ciency in divine power, and the things necessitating it are extremely power-
ful. The matter is within the realm of the possible. And if a possible matter 
has something extremely powerful to necessitate it and there is no deﬁciency 
in the power of the agent, it may be regarded not as possible, but as actual.

An Allusive Point

An Allusive Point
If the universe is studied carefully, it will be seen that within it are two 
elements that have spread everywhere and become rooted; with their traces 
and fruits like good and evil, beauty and ugliness, beneﬁt and harm, perfec-
tion and defect, light and darkness, guidance and misguidance, light and ﬁre, 
belief and unbelief, obedience and rebellion, and fear and love, opposites 
clash with one another in the universe, they constantly manifest change and 
transformation. Their wheels turn as though they were a workshop produc-
ing the crops of some other world.

Of  a  certainty,  the  branches  and  results,  which  are  opposites,  of  those 
two elements will continue into eternity; they will become concentrated and 
separate out from one another. Then they will be manifested in the form of 
Paradise and Hell. Since it is out of this transient world that the permanent 
world will be made, this world’s fundamental elements will certainly go to 
eternity and permanence.

Indeed,  Paradise  and  Hell  are  the  two  fruits  of  the  branch  of  the  tree 
of creation that stretches, inclines, and goes towards eternity; they are the 

TWENTY-NINTH WORD – SECOND AIM

599

two results of the chain of the universe; the two storehouses of this ﬂood of 
divine activity; the two pools of beings, which ﬂow in waves towards eter-
nity; and the place of manifestation, the one of divine favour, the other of 
divine wrath. When the hand of power shakes up the universe with a violent 
motion, those two pools will ﬁll up with the appropriate matters.

The essential meaning of this Allusive Point is as follows

As  eternal  benevolence  and  pre-eternal  wisdom  necessitated,  the  Pre-
Eternally All-Wise One created this world to be a place of trial, an arena of 
examination, a mirror to His most beautiful names, and a page for the pen 
of divine determining and power. Now, trial and examination are the cause 
of growth and development. And growth causes dispositions to unfold. And 
this unfolding causes the abilities to become apparent. And this emergence 
of  abilities  causes  the  relative  truths  to  become  evident.  And  the  relative 
truths’ becoming evident causes the embroideries of the manifestations of 
the All-Glorious Maker’s most beautiful names to be displayed and the uni-
verse to be transformed into a missive of the Eternally Besought One. It is 
by virtue of this mystery of examination and the mystery of human account-
ability that the diamond-like essences of elevated spirits are puriﬁed of the 
coal-like matter of base spirits, and the two separated out from one another.
Thus, since it was for mysteries such as these, and for other subtle and 
elevated  instances  of  wisdom  which  we  do  not  yet  know  of  that  the  Pre-
Eternally  All-Wise  One  willed  the  world  in  this  form,  He  also  willed  the 
change and transformation in this world for those instances of wisdom. With 
wisdom He mixed together opposites for its change and transformation, and 
brought them face to face. Combining harm with beneﬁt, including evil with 
good,  and  mingling  ugliness  with  beauty,  He  kneaded  them  together  like 
dough, and made the universe subject to the law of change and mutation and 
the principle of transformation and perfection.

A day will come when this assembly of examination is closed and the 
period of trial is ﬁnished, and the divine names have carried out their decree, 
and the pen of divine determining has completed writing its missives, and 
divine power completed the embroideries of its art, and beings have fulﬁlled 
their duties, and creatures accomplished their acts of service, and everything 
has stated its meaning, and this world produced the seedlings of the hereaf-
ter, and the earth has displayed and exhibited all the miracles of power of 
the  All-Powerful  Maker  and  all  the  wonders  of  His  art,  and  this  transient 
world has attached to the string of time the tableaux forming the panoramas 
of eternity.

600

THE WORDS

For the eternal wisdom and pre-eternal providence of the All-Glorious 
Maker necessitate such truths as the results of the examination and trial, the 
truths of those divine names’ manifestations, the truths of the missives of 
the  pen  of  divine  determining,  the  originals  of  those  sample-like  embroi-
deries of art, the aims and beneﬁts of the duties of beings, the wages of the 
acts of service of creatures, the truths of the meanings that the book of the 
universe’s words stated, the sprouting of the seeds of innate disposition, the 
opening of a supreme court of judgement, the displaying of the sample-like 
panoramas taken from this world, the rending of the veil of apparent causes, 
and  the  surrendering  of  everything  directly  to  the  All-Glorious  Creator. 
Since the All-Glorious Maker’s pre-eternal wisdom and providence neces-
sitate these truths, they require the puriﬁcation of those opposites in order to 
deliver the world from the turmoil of change and transience, transformation 
and extinction, and to separate out the causes of change and the matters of 
conﬂict.  Most  certainly  they  will  bring  about  the  resurrection  and  purify 
those opposites in order to obtain these results.

Thus, as a result of this puriﬁcation Hell will take on its eternal and dread-

ful form and its inmates will manifest the threat:

( 36:59 ) A @ ? >
While Paradise will assume its everlasting and majestic form, and its people 
and companions will manifest the address of:

( 39:73 ) º ¹ ¸ ¶ μ
As is proved in the Second Question of the First Station of the Twenty-
Eighth Word, through His perfect power, the Pre-Eternally All-Wise One 
will give the inhabitants of these two houses eternal and permanent bodies 
which  will  not  be  subject  to  dissolution,  change,  old  age,  or  decline.  For 
there will be no causes of change, which are the cause of decline.

Fourth Matter

FOURTH MATTER: This is possible, it will occur. Indeed, after dying, 
the world will be resurrected as the hereafter. After being destroyed, the One 
Who made the world will repair and reconstruct it in an even better form, 
and will convert it into one of the mansions of the hereafter. The proof of 
this is foremost the agreement of the Holy Qur’an together with all its verses 
comprising  thousands  of  rational  proofs  and  all  the  revealed  scriptures; 
while  the  attributes  of  the  All-Glorious  One  pertaining  to  His  might  and 
those pertaining to His beauty, and all His beautiful names, clearly indicate 
its occurrence. So too did He promise in all His heavenly decrees which He 

TWENTY-NINTH WORD – SECOND AIM

601

sent to His prophets that He would create the resurrection and Great Gather-
ing. And since He has promised, He will most certainly bring it about. You 
may refer to the Eighth Truth of the Tenth Word for this matter.

Also, just as foremost Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom be bless-
ings  and  peace ),  with  the  strength  of  his  thousand  miracles,  and  all  the 
prophets and messengers, and the saints and the righteous have agreed on 
its occurrence and given news of it, so does the universe together with all its 
creational signs tell of its occurrence.

In  Short:  The  Tenth  Word  with  all  its  truths,  and  the  Twenty-Eighth 
Word  with  all  its  proofs  in  the  ‘Especially’s’  in  its  Second  Station,  have 
demonstrated with the certainty of the sun’s rising in the morning after set-
ting the previous evening that after the setting of the life of this world, the 
sun of truth will appear once more in the form of the life of the hereafter.

Thus, seeking assistance from the divine name of All-Wise and beneﬁt-
ing from the effulgence of the Qur’an, from the beginning up to here our 
explanations  have  taken  the  form  of  four  Fundamental  Points  in  order  to 
prepare  the  heart  for  acceptance,  the  soul  for  surrender,  and  to  convince 
the reason. But who are we that we should speak of this matter? What does 
this world’s true Owner, the universe’s Creator, these beings’ Master, say? 
We should listen to Him. Can others dare to interfere ofﬁciously while the 
Owner of this domain speaks?

We must listen to the All-Wise Maker’s pre-eternal discourse which He 
delivers addressing all the ranks of people in each successive century in the 
mosque of the world and place of instruction which is the earth, with  thou-
sands of decrees like,

We shall indicate a single jewel from the great treasure of this verse, as 

follows.

The  ‘I’  is  one  component,  one  aspect,  of  the  numerous  aspects  of  the 
Trust, from the bearing of which the sky, earth, and mountains shrank, and 
of which they were frightened. Indeed, from the time of Adam until now, the 
‘I’ has been the seed of a terrible tree of Zaqqum and at the same time, of a 
luminous tree of Tuba, which shoot out branches around the world of man-
kind. Before attempting to elucidate this vast truth, we shall give an explana-
tion by way of an introduction which will facilitate the understanding of it.

Just as the ‘I’ is the key to the divine names, which are hidden treasures,  
so is it the key to the locked talisman of creation; it is a problem-solving rid-
dle, a wondrous talisman. When its nature is known, both the ‘I’ itself, that

THE WORDS

strange riddle, that amazing talisman, is disclosed, and it discloses the talis-
man of the universe and the treasures of the Necessary World. We have dis-
cussed this problem as follows in my Arabic treatise, Ş e m m e  ( Intimations ).
The  key  to  the  world  is  in  man’s  hand  and  is  attached  to  his  self.  For 
while being apparently open, the doors of the universe are in fact closed. 
Allah Almighty has given to man by way of a Trust such a key, called the 
‘I’, that it opens all the doors of the world; He has given him an enigmatic 
‘I’ with which he may discover the hidden treasures of the universe’s Crea-
tor. But the ‘I’ is also an extremely complicated riddle and a talisman that 
is difﬁcult to solve. When its true nature and the purpose of its creation are 
known, as it is itself solved, so will be the universe.

The  All-Wise  Maker  gave  to  man  as  a  Trust  an  ‘I’  which  comprises 
indications and samples that show and cause to recognize the truths of the 
attributes and functions of His dominicality, so that the ‘I’ might be a unit 
of measurement and the attributes of dominicality and functions of Divinity 
might be known. However, it is not necessary for a unit of measurement to 
have actual existence; like hypothetical lines in geometry, a unit of measure-
ment may be formed by hypothesis and supposition. It is not necessary for 
its actual existence to be established by formal knowledge and proofs.

Q u e s t i o n :  Why is knowledge of Allah Almighty’s attributes and names 

connected with the ‘I’?

T h e   A n s w e r :  Since an absolute and all-encompassing thing has no limits 
or end, neither may a shape be given to it, nor may a form be conferred on it, 
nor may it be determined; what its quiddity consists in may not be compre-
hended. For example, an endless light without darkness may not be known 
or perceived. But if a line of real or imaginary darkness is drawn, then it 
becomes known. Thus, since Allah Almighty’s attributes such as knowledge 
and  power,  and  names  such  as  All-Wise  and  All-Compassion-ate  are  all-
encompassing, limitless, and without like, they may not be determined, and 
what they are may not be known or perceived. Therefore, since they have 
no limits or actual end, it is necessary to draw a hypothetical and imaginary 
limit. The ‘I’ does this. It imagines in itself a ﬁctitious dominicality, owner-
ship, power, and knowledge: it draws a line. By doing this it places an imagi-
nary  limit  on  the  all-encompassing  attributes,  saying,  “ Up  to  here,  mine, 
after that, His; ” it makes a division. With the tiny units of measurement in 
itself, it slowly understands the true nature of the attributes.

For example, with its imagined dominicality over what it owns, the ‘I’ 
may  understand  the  dominicality  of  its  Creator  over  contingent  creation. 

THIRTIETH WORD – FIRST AIM

605

And with its apparent ownership, it may understand the true ownership of 
its Creator, saying: “ Like I am the owner of this house, so is the Creator the 
owner of the universe. ” And with its partial knowledge, it may understand 
His knowledge, and with its small amount of acquired art, it may understand 
the originative art of the Glorious Maker. For example, the ‘I’ says: “ As I 
made this house and arranged it, so someone must have made the universe 
and arranged it, ” and so on. Thousands of mysterious states, attributes, and 
perceptions which make known and show to a degree all the divine attributes 
and functions are contained within the ‘I’. That is to say, the ‘I’ is mirror-
like, and, like a unit of measurement and tool for discovery, it has an indica-
tive  meaning;  having  no  meaning  in  itself,  it  shows  the  meaning  of  that 
other. It is a conscious strand from the thick rope of the human being, a ﬁne 
thread from the raiment of the essence of humanity, it is an  A l i f  from the 
book of the character of mankind, and it has two faces.

The ﬁrst of these faces looks towards good and existence. With this face 
it is only capable of receiving favour; it accepts what is given, itself it cannot 
create. This face is not active, it does not have the ability to create. Its other 
face looks towards evil and goes to non-existence. That face is active, it has 
the power to act. Furthermore, the real nature of the ‘I’ is indicative; it shows 
the  meaning  of  things  other  than  itself.  Its  dominicality  is  imaginary.  Its 
existence is so weak and insubstantial that in itself it cannot bear or support 
anything at all. Rather, it is a sort of scale or measure, like a thermometer or 
barometer, that indicates the degrees and amounts of things; it is a measure 
that makes known the absolute, all-encompassing and limitless attributes of 
the Necessary Being.

Thus, the person who knows his own self in this way, and realizes and 

acts according to it, is included in the good news of,

( 91:9 ) C B A @ 
He truly carries out the Trust, and through the telescope of his ‘I’, he sees 
what the universe is and what duties it is performing. When he obtains infor-
mation about the universe, he sees that his ‘I’ conﬁrms it. This knowledge 
will remain as light and wisdom for him, and will not be transformed into 
darkness and futility. When the ‘I’ fulﬁls its duty in this way, it abandons 
its imaginary dominicality and supposed ownership, which are the units of 
measurement,  and  it  says:  َنوُ(cid:151)َ(cid:106)ْرُ(cid:98) ِهْ(cid:193)َ(cid:170)ِاَو ُمﯰﯧُ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)ا ُهَ(cid:170)َو ُد ْ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)ا ُهَ(cid:170)َو  ُكْ(cid:171)ُ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)ا ُهَ(cid:170)  It 
achieves true worship. It attains the rank of ( 95:4 ) 0 /

606

THE WORDS

But if, forgetting the wisdom of its creation and abandoning the duty of 
its nature, the ‘I’ views itself solely in the light of its nominal and apparent 
meaning,  if  it  believes  that  it  owns  itself,  then  it  betrays  the  Trust  and  it 
comes under the category of,

( 91:10 ) H G F E
It  was  of  this  aspect  of  ‘I-ness’,  therefore,  which  gives  rise  to  all  ascrib-
ing of partners to Allah, evil, and misguidance, that the heavens, earth, and 
mountains were terriﬁed; they were frightened of associating hypothetical 
partners with Allah.

Indeed, if the ‘I’ is not known for what it is, an insubstantial Alif, a thread, 
a hypothetical line, it may burgeon in concealment under the ground, gradu-
ally swelling. It will permeate all parts of a human being. Like a gigantic 
dragon it will swallow up the human being; that entire person with all his 
faculties will, quite simply, become pure ‘I’. Then too, the ‘I-ness’ of the 
human  race  gives  strength  to  the  individual  ‘I-ness’  by  means  of  human 
racialism  and  national  racialism,  and  the  ‘I’,  gaining  support  from  the 
‘I-ness’ of the human race, contests the commands of the Glorious Maker, 
like Satan. Then, using itself as a yardstick, it compares everyone, every-
thing  even,  with  itself;  it  divides  Allah  Almighty’s  sovereignty  between 
them and other causes. It falls into ascribing partners to Allah on a vast scale, 
indicating the meaning of:

( 31:13 ) D C B A
It is just like a man who steals a brass coin from the public treasury; he can 
only justify his action by agreeing to take a silver coin for each of his friends 
who is present. So the man who says: “ I own myself ” must believe and say: 
“ Everything owns itself. ”

Thus, while in this treacherous position, the ‘I’ is in absolute ignorance. 
Even if it knows thousands of branches of science, with compounded igno-
rance it is most ignorant. For when its senses and thoughts yield the lights 
of knowledge of the universe, those lights are extinguished because such an 
‘I’ does not ﬁnd any material within itself with which to conﬁrm, illuminate, 
and perpetuate them. Whatever it encounters is dyed with the colours that 
are within it. Even if it encounters pure wisdom, the wisdom takes the form, 
within that ‘I’ , of absolute futility. For the colour of an ‘I’ that is in this 
condition  is  atheism  and  ascribing  partners  to  Allah,  it  is  denial  of  Allah 
Almighty. If the whole universe is full of shining signs, a dark point in the 
‘I’ hides them from view, as though extinguished.

THIRTIETH WORD – FIRST AIM

The  nature  of  man  and  the  ‘I’  within  his  nature  have  been  explained 
clearly  and  in  detail  in  the  Eleventh  Word,  as  indicating  something  other  
than themselves. They are shown to be a most sensitive scale and accurate 
measure,  an  encompassing  index  and  perfect  map,  a  comprehensive  mir-
ror, and a ﬁtting calendar and diary for the universe. Since we consider the 
explanation in that Word to be sufﬁcient and it may be referred to, we curtail 
and conclude the introduction here. If you have understood the introduction, 
come, let us enter upon the truth.

C o n s i d e r   t h i s :  In the world of humanity, from the time of Adam up to 
now,  two  great  currents,  two  lines  of  thought,  have  always  been  and  will 
so continue. Like two mighty trees, they have spread out their branches in 
all  directions  and  in  every  class  of  humanity.  One  of  them  is  the  line  of 
prophethood  and  religion,  the  other  the  line  of  philosophy  in  its  various 
forms. Whenever those two lines have been in agreement and united, that is 
to say, if the line of philosophy, having joined the line of religion, has been 
obedient and of service to it, the world of humanity has experienced a bril-
liant happiness and social life. Whereas, when they have become separated, 
goodness and light have been drawn to the side of the line of prophethood 
and religion, and evil and misguidance to the side of the line of philosophy. 
Now let us ﬁnd the origin and foundations of those two lines. 

The line of philosophy that does not obey the line of religion, taking the 
form of a tree of Zaqqum, scatters the darkness of ascribing partners to Allah 
and misguidance on all sides. In the branch of the power of intellect, even, it 
produces the fruit of atheism, materialism, and naturalism for the consump-
tion of the human intellect. And in the branch of the power of anger, it pours 
the tyrannies of Nimrod, Pharaoh, and Shaddad on humankind. 1 And in the 
branch of the power of animal appetites, it nurtures and bears the fruit of 
goddesses, idols, and those who claim divinity.

The origin of the tree of Zaqqum together with that of the line of prophet-
hood,  which  is  like  the  Tuba  tree  of  worship,  are  in  the  two  faces  of  the 
‘I’.  The  blessed  branches  of  the  line  of  prophethood  in  the  garden  of  the 
globe of the earth are the following: in the branch of the power of intellect, 

1.    It  was  the  swamp  of  natural  philosophy  that  gave  birth  to  idols  and  established 
goddesses in the heads of the ancient Greeks, that nourished and nurtured Nimrods and 
Pharaohs. It was again that natural philosophy that produced the philosophies of ancient 
Egypt and Babylon, which either reached the degree of magic or, since they were repre-
sented by the elite, were considered to be magic generally. Most certainly, if man does not 
perceive the light of Allah Almighty because of the veil of nature, he will attribute divinity 
to everything and will thus cause himself nothing but trouble.

THE WORDS

it has nurtured the fruits of the prophets, the messengers, and the veracious. 
In the branch of the power of repulsion, it has resulted in angelic kings and 
just rulers. And in the branch of the power of attraction, it has  resulted in 
people of good character and modest and beautiful manner, both generous 
and gracious. So the line of prophethood has shown how humankind is the 
most perfect fruit of the universe. We shall explain the two faces of the ‘I’ as 
the root and pivot and as a principal seed of those two trees. That is to say, 
prophethood takes hold of one face of the ‘I’ and philosophy takes hold of 
the other, causing them to diverge.

The First Face, which is the face of prophethood: It is the origin of 
sheer worship. That is to say, the ‘I’ knows itself to be a bondsman. It real-
izes  that  it  serves  one  other  than  itself.  Its  essence  has  only  an  indicative 
meaning. That is, it understands that it carries another’s meaning. Its exist-
ence is dependent; that is, it believes that its existence is due only to anoth-
er’s existence, and that the continuance of its existence is due solely to the 
creativity of that other. Its ownership is illusory; that is, it knows that with 
the permission of its owner it has an apparent and temporary ownership. Its 
reality  is  shadow-like;  that  is,  a  contingent  and  insigniﬁcant  shadow  that 
displays the manifestation of a true and necessary reality. As to its function, 
being a measure and balance for the attributes and functions of its Creator, 
it is conscious service.

It is in this way that the prophets, and the pure ones and saints who were 
from the line of the prophets, regarded the ‘I’, they saw it in this regard 
and understood the truth. They handed over the sovereignty to the Lord of 
All Sovereignty and concluded that that Lord of All Glory has no partner 
or  like,  neither  in  His  sovereignty,  nor  in  His  dominicality,  nor  in  His 
divinity. He has no need of assistant or deputy. The key to all things is in 
His hand. He has absolute power over all things. They also concluded that 
causes are but an apparent veil; nature is the set of rules of His creation, a 
collection of His laws, and the way in which He demonstrates His power.
Thus,  this  shining,  luminous,  beautiful  face  is  like  a  living  and  mean-
ingful  seed  out  of  which  the  Glorious  Creator  has  created  a  Tuba  tree  of 
worship, the blessed branches of which have adorned with luminous fruits 
all parts of the world of humanity. By scattering the darkness of the past, 
it shows that that long past time is not a place of non-existence and a vast 
graveyard as philosophy would have it, but is a radiant garden and a place of 
light for the luminous spirits who have departed this world, who have cast 
off their heavy loads and remain free. It is a luminous, many-runged ascent

and an orbit of lights for passing spirits in order that they may jump to the 
future and eternal felicity.

As  for  the  second  face,  it  is  represented  by  philosophy.  And  as  for 
philosophy,  it  regards  the  ‘I’  as  carrying  no  meaning  other  than  its  own.  
That is to say, it declares that the ‘I’ points only to itself, that its meaning is 
in itself. It considers that the ‘I’ works purely on its own account. It regards 
its existence as necessary and essential, that is, it says that it exists in itself 
and of itself. It falsely assumes that the ‘I’ owns its own life and is the real 
master in its sphere of disposal. It supposes it to be a constant reality. And it 
considers the ‘I’s’ duty to be perfection of self, which originates from love 
of self, and likewise, philosophies have constructed their modes of thought 
on many such corrupt foundations. We have given deﬁnite proof in our other 
treatises, especially in the Words and more particularly in the Twelfth and 
Twenty-Fifth Words, of how baseless and rotten these foundations are.

Even men like Plato and Aristotle, and Ibn Sina and Farabi, who were 
the most illustrious representatives and authorities of the line of philosophy, 
said that the ultimate aim of humanity is to liken themselves to the Necessary 
Being, that is to say, to actually resemble Him. They thus delivered judge-
ment in the manner of Pharaoh, and, by whipping up ‘I-ness’ and allowing 
polytheism to run free in the valleys, opened the way to numerous different 
ways of associating partners with Allah, such as worship of causes, idols, 
nature,  and  the  stars.  They  closed  the  doors  of  impotence  and  weakness, 
poverty and need, deﬁciency and imperfection, which are intrinsic to human 
beings, thus obstructing the road to worship. Being immersed in naturalist 
philosophy  and  being  completely  incapable  of  emerging  from  associating 
partners with Allah, they were unable to ﬁnd the broad gate of thanks.

On the other hand, the line of prophethood considered in the manner of 
a worshipper that the aim of humanity and duty of human beings is to be 
moulded by Allah-given ethics and good character, and, by knowing their 
impotence  to  seek  refuge  with  divine  power,  by  seeing  their  weakness  to 
rely on divine strength, by realizing their poverty to trust in divine mercy, 
by  perceiving  their  need  to  seek  help  from  divine  riches,  by  seeing  their 
faults to ask for pardon through divine forgiveness, and by realizing their 
deﬁciency to be gloriﬁers of divine perfection.

So, it is because the philosophy which does not obey the line of religion 
thus lost its way, that the ‘I’ took the reins into its own hands and ran into 
all sorts of misguidance. And out of the ‘I’ that was in this position, a tree of 
Zaqqum sprang forth and engulfed more than half of mankind.

610

THE WORDS

Thus, in the branch of power of animal appetites of that tree, the fruits 
it has presented to mankind are idols and goddesses. For according to the 
principles of philosophy, power is approved. “ Might is right ” is the norm, 
even. It says, “ All power to the strongest. ” “ The winner takes all, ” and, “ In  
power there is right. ”  1 It has given moral support to tyranny, encouraged 
despots, and urged oppressors to claim divinity.

Also, by appropriating the beauty in works of art and the ﬁneness in the 
decoration and attributing them to the works of art themselves and their dec-
oration, and by not relating them to the manifestation of the sacred and sheer 
beauty of the Maker and Fashioner, it says: “ How beautiful it is, ” instead 
of “ How beautifully made it is, ” thus regarding each as an idol worthy of 
worship. Moreover, because it admires a fraudulent, boasting, ostentatious, 
hypocritical beauty that may be sold to anyone, it has acclaimed the hypo-
crites, and has made idol-like people monuments for its own worshippers. 
2 In the branch of power of anger of that tree, it has nurtured the fruits of 
greater and lesser Nimrods, Pharaohs, and Shaddads ruling over unfortunate 
mankind.  In  the  branch  of  power  of  intellect,  it  has  produced  such  fruits 
as atheism, materialism, and naturalism in the mind of humanity, and has 
thrown it into confusion.

Now, in order to illuminate this truth, we shall compare the results which 
are  born  of  the  sound  foundations  of  the  line  of  prophethood  with  those 
originating from the rotten foundations of the way of philosophy, and shall 
mention three or four examples.

First Example

ّ(cid:195)ا  ِق َ(cid:203)ْ(cid:114)َاِ(cid:92) اوُ(cid:163)َ

F i r s t   E x a m p l e :   According  to  the  rule  of:  ِ

ّ(cid:171)َ(cid:115)َ(cid:98)  3  which  is 
one of the principles of the line of prophethood concerning individual life, 
there is the instruction: “ Be distinguished by Allah-given morals and turn 
towards  Allah  Almighty  with  humility  recognizing  your  impotence,  pov-
erty, and defectiveness, and so be a slave in His presence. ” Whereas, the 
self-seeking  rule  of  philosophy,  “ Try  to  imitate  the  Necessarily  Existent 
One ” is mankind’s aim for perfection. No, indeed, the essence of human-
ity has been kneaded with inﬁnite impotence, weakness, poverty, and need, 

1.  The principle of prophethood says: “ Power is in right; right is not in power. ” It thus 

halts tyranny and ensures justice.

2.  That is to say, in order to appear desirable to their worshippers and to gain their 
attention, those idol-like people display, through hypocritical ostentation, a sort of wor-
shipful attitude.

while the essence of the Necessarily Existent One is inﬁnitely omnipotent, 
powerful, self-sufﬁcient, and without need.

Second Example

S e c o n d   E x a m p l e :  Among the principles of the line of prophethood con-
cerning social life are those of mutual assistance, magnanimity, and gener-
osity. These have been harnessed for the help and assistance of all things  
from the sun and moon down to even plants, for the assistance of animals, 
for  example,  and  the  help  of  animals  for  human  beings,  and  even  that  of 
particles of food for the cells of the body. Whereas, among the principles 
of  the  line  of  philosophy  concerning  social  life  is  that  of  conﬂict,  which 
springs from the misuse of their inborn dispositions by a number of tyrants, 
brutish men, and savage beasts. Indeed, they have accepted this principle at 
so fundamental a level and at such a general one that they have idiotically 
declared: “ Life is a conﬂict. ”

Third Example

line of prophethood concerning divine unity is:  ِد ِ(cid:110)اَوْ(cid:170)ا  ِنَ(cid:150)  َ

T h i r d   E x a m p l e :  One of the valuable results and exalted principles of the 
ّ(cid:202)ِا ُرُد ْ(cid:135)َ(cid:192)  َ(cid:202) ُد ِ(cid:110)اَوْ(cid:170)َا 
“ If  a  thing  has  unity,  it  must  proceed  from  one  alone. ”  1  That  is,  “ Since 
each thing in itself and all things collectively have unity, they therefore must 
be the creation of one single being. ” Whereas, one of the beliefs of ancient 
philosophy is: ُد ِ(cid:110)اَوْ(cid:170)ا  َ
ّ(cid:202)ِا ُهْ(cid:179)َ(cid:150) ُرُد ْ(cid:135)َ(cid:192)  َ(cid:202) ُد ِ(cid:110)اَوْ(cid:170)َا “ From one, one proceeds. ” 2 That 
is, “ From one person, only one single thing can proceed. Everything else 
proceeds from him by means of intermediaries. ”

This misleading principle of philosophy is stained by associating partners 
with Allah, and presents the Absolutely Self-Sufﬁcient and Omnipotent One 
as needing impotent intermediaries, and it accords causes and intermediaries 
a sort of partnership in His dominicality. It attributes to the Glorious Creator 
the title of the First Intellect, 3 which in fact indicates the status of creature. 
Moreover, it allots the rest of His sovereignty to causes and intermediaries, 
thus opening the way to associating partners with Him on a vast scale. If pre-
eminent  philosophers  like  the  Illuminists  ( I s h r a q i y y u n  )  uttered  nonsense 
like this, you can imagine how much more absurd will be what inferior phi-
losophers like the materialists and naturalists say.

THE WORDS

which is one of the wise principles of prophethood, “If the result and wis-
dom of everything, in particular living beings, has one aspect which looks to 
the being itself, then the results which concern its Maker and the instances 
of  wisdom  which  look  to  its  Creator  must  be  myriad.  Each  thing,  even  a 
single fruit, has as much wisdom and as many results as all the fruits of a 
tree.” This principle, which is pure truth, results from the joining of one of 
the forms of philosophy with the line of prophethood.

Whereas, the nonsensical principles of a deceiving philosophy that has 
not joined this line says: “ The result of every living being looks to the being 
itself or is connected with beneﬁts for mankind, ” thus deeming it extremely 
senseless and futile and attaching a result, a tiny fruit, to a tree as huge as a 
mountain. This truth has been explained to an extent in the Tenth Truth of 
the Tenth Word and some parts have been mentioned in the treatise called 
L e m e â t  ( Gleams ), so here we have cut it short. However, you may extend 
these four examples to thousands.

It is because of these rotten foundations and disastrous results of philoso-
phy that geniuses from among the Muslim philosophers such as Ibn Sina and 
Farabi were charmed by its apparent glitter and were deceived into taking 
this way, and thus attained only the rank of an ordinary believer. Hujjat al-
Islam al-Ghazali did not accord them that rank, even. 1

Moreover,  being  fascinated  by  the  apparent  glamour  of  the  way  of 
philosophy and being closely involved with it, some of the most learned 
scholars of Islamic theology, the foremost of the Mu‘tazilites, assumed 
reason to be dominant, due to which they could attain only the rank of 
deviating,  novice  believers.  Furthermore,  because  those  famous  liter-
ary  ﬁgures  of  Islam,  like  Abu  al-‘Ala  al-Ma‘arri,  who  was  renowned 
for his pessimism, and ‘Umar Khayyam, who was characterized by his 
pitiful weeping, took pleasure at the line of philosophy’s caressing their 
evil-commanding souls, they received contemptuous and condemnatory 
rebuffs and restraining and chastening slaps from the people of truth and 
perfection, who said: “ You are being insolent, you are approaching her-
esy, and you are disseminating heresy. ” 2

A further result of the rotten foundations of the line of philosophy is that 
although the ‘I’ has, in itself, an essence as insubstantial as air, because the 
inauspicious attitude of philosophy regards it as relating only to itself, that 
vapour-like ‘I’ becomes as though liquid; and then, because of its familiarity

and preoccupation with materialism, it hardens. Next, through neglect and 
denial, the ‘I-ness’ freezes. Then, through rebelliousness it becomes opaque, 
losing its transparency. Then, it gradually becomes denser and envelops its 
owner. It becomes distended with the thoughts of mankind. Next, supposing 
the rest of humanity, and even causes, to be like itself, although they do not 
accept this and disclaim it, it accords to each of them the status of a Pharaoh. 
Then at this point it takes up its position contesting the commands of the 
Glorious Creator, it says:

( 36:78 ) o n m l k 
and, as a challenge, accuses the Absolutely Omnipotent One of impotence. It 
even debases the attributes of the Glorious Creator. It either rejects or denies 
or distorts what does not suit its interests and does not please its Pharaoh-
like evil-commanding soul.

One  group  of  philosophers,  by  calling  Almighty  Allah  self-necessitat-
ing, denied Him choice. They rejected the endless testimony of all creation, 
which proves that He has choice. Glory be to Allah! Although all the beings 
in the universe from the smallest particles to the sun show that the Creator 
has choice, each with its own appointed individuality, order, wisdom, and 
measure, this blind philosophy refused to see it. Moreover, another group of 
philosophers said: “ Divine knowledge is not concerned with insigniﬁcant 
matters, ” 1  and  denied  its  awesome  comprehensiveness,  thus  rejecting  the 
veracious witnessing of all beings.

Furthermore,  by  attributing  effects  to  causes,  philosophy  has  granted 
nature  the  power  to  create.  As  has  been  deﬁnitely  proved  in  the  Twenty-
Second Word, since philosophy does not see the evident stamp on every-
thing  signifying  the  Creator  of  All  Things  and  assumes  nature  to  be  the 
originator, despite its being impotent, inanimate, unconscious, and blind and 
its apparent power being in the hands of chance and force which are also 
blind, it attributes to nature certain beings, each of which expresses thou-
sands of instances of exalted wisdom and is like a missive from the Eternally 
Besought One.

In addition, the philosophers did not ﬁnd the door to resurrection and the 
hereafter, which, as is proved in the Tenth Word, Allah Almighty with all 
of His names, and the universe with all of its truths, and the line of prophet-
hood  with  all  of  its  veriﬁcations,  and  the  revealed  books  with  all  of  their 
verses  demonstrate.  They  therefore  denied  the  resurrection  and  ascribed

pre-eternity to spirits. You can deduce from these superstitions what their 
views on other matters would be. Indeed, the powers of evil have raised up 
the minds of atheistic philosophers as though with the beaks and talons of 
their ‘I’s and have dropped them in the valleys of misguidance. Thus, in the 
microcosm the ‘I’ is the idol, like those in the macrocosm such as nature.

It is appropriate to mention here the gist of a ﬁctitious event I described 
in semi-verse in L e m e â t  in the form of an imaginary journey, to illuminate 
the aforementioned truth.

Eight years before writing this treatise, in Istanbul during the month of 
Ramadan, when the Old Said, who was concerned with the study of philoso-
phy, was about to be transformed into the New Said, I experienced some-
thing  resembling  a  dream  or  vision,  an  imaginary  event,  while  pondering 
over the three ways that are alluded to at the end of Sura al-Fatiha,
( 1:7 ) C B A @ ? > = < ;

It was as follows.

I saw myself in a vast desert. A layer of murky, dispiriting, and suffocat-
ing cloud had covered the whole face of the earth. There was neither breeze, 
nor light, nor water, none of these was to be found. I imagined that every-
where was full of monsters, dangerous and dreadful creatures. It occurred to 
me that through on the other side of this land there should be light, breeze, 
and water. I had to get there. I realized that I was being driven on involuntar-
ily. Under the earth I wormed my way into a tunnel-like cave and gradually 
travelled through the earth. I saw that many people had passed along this 
subterranean way before me, on all sides they were submerged. I saw their 
footprints and once I heard some of their voices, then later they ceased.

O my friend who is accompanying me on my imaginary journey! That 
land is nature and the philosophy of naturalism. The tunnel is the way that 
the  philosophers  have  opened  up  with  their  thought  in  order  to  reach  the 
truth.  The  footprints  I  saw  were  those  of  famous  philosophers  like  Plato 
and Aristotle,  1 and the voices I heard those of geniuses like Ibn Sina and 

1.  If you say: “ Who do think you are to challenge these famous philosophers? You are 
a mere ﬂy, yet you meddle in the ﬂight of eagles, ” I would reply: “ While having a pre-
eternal teacher like the Qur’an, in matters concerning truth and the knowledge of Allah, 
I do not have to attach as much value as that of a ﬂy’s wing to those eagles, who are ==

Farabi. Indeed, I saw in various books some of the things Ibn Sina had said 
and some of his principles, but he had become stuck, he could go no further, 
he was submerged before reaching the truth. Anyhow, I showed you a small 
part of truth to save you from anxiety. Now I return to my journey.

Gradually I realized that I had been given two things to use. One was a 
torch; it would scatter the darkness of that subterranean nature. The other 
was a device which, by smashing mighty boulders and huge rocks, would 
open up a way for me. I was told: “ This torch and device have been given to 
you from the treasury of the Qur’an. ” I carried on for a long time in this way. 
Then suddenly I realized that I had come out on the other side. I saw a world 
where everywhere were rejoicing, bright sunshine in a beautiful springtime 
and  an  invigorating  breeze,  and  delicious  life-giving  water.  I  exclaimed: 
“ All praise be to Allah! ”

Then I realized that I did not own myself, someone was testing me. As 
in the ﬁrst part of the journey, I found myself in that vast desert under the 
suffocating cloud. And, though now on another way, someone was still driv-
ing  me  on.  This  time  it  was  not  under  the  earth;  I  was  making  this  long 
journey on the face of the earth in order to reach the other side. I saw things 
in this part of my journey that were so strange and curious they cannot be 
described: the sea was raging, storms threatened me, everything caused dif-
ﬁculties for me. But once again, with the means of travel that had been given 
to me from the Qur’an, I overcame them and passed on. On the way I saw 
that  there  were  corpses  of  travellers  everywhere.  Only  one  in  a  thousand 
had completed the journey. At any rate, having been saved from the cloud I 
had reached the other side of the earth and had come out in full view of the 
dazzling sun. Breathing in the invigorating breeze, I declared: “ All praise 
be to Allah! ”

I  started  looking  round  that  heaven-like  world.  Then  I  saw  there  was 
someone who was not going to let me stay there. In an instant he took me 
to that vast desert as though to show me another way. There I saw different 
sorts of things, some like aircraft, some like cars, some like hoists which had 
descended exactly like lifts. Whoever, according to his power and capacity, 
jumped onto them, was taken up. I, too, jumped onto one of them and in a 
trice it took me up above the cloud. I came out among truly beautiful green

teacher, whatever caused them to become submerged did not so much as dampen my toes.

and spectacular mountain-tops. The layer of cloud came no more than half-
way up the mountains. Everywhere were the gentlest of breezes, the most 
delicious water, and the softest of lights. I saw that the lift-like allegorical 
vehicles were found on all sides. Even though I had seen them in the ﬁrst 
two parts of my journey and on the other face of the earth, I had not under-
stood what they were. Now I realized that they were manifestations of the 
All-Wise Qur’an’s verses.

Thus, the ﬁrst way is indicated by, C B and is the way of those 
who  are  submerged  in  nature  and  are  followers  of  the  philosophy  of  nat-
uralism.  You  have  seen  how  many  difﬁculties  there  are  in  this    ﬁrst  way 
in  passing  to  the  truth  and  the  light.  The  second  way  is  indicated  by, 
@ ? and is the way of those who worship causes and who give 
the power to create and the effect to intermediaries, like the Peripatetic phi-
losophers. They tried to open up the way to the ultimate truth and knowledge 
of the Necessarily Existent One by means of the intellect and reason alone. 
As for the third way, which is indicated by, > = < it is the lumi-
nous highway of the people of the Qur’an, who are the people of the straight 
path. This luminous highway is a brilliant way revealed and bestowed by 
the Most Merciful One. It is the shortest, the easiest, the safest way, and it 
is open to everyone.

ure of this verse; that is, some jewels from the caskets that are particles, 
and it discusses to some small degree their motion and duty. It consists 
of an introduction and three points. ]

Introduction

INTRODUCTION

The  transformation  of  particles  are  the  vibrations  and  wanderings  that 
occur while the signs of creation are being written in the book of the uni-
verse by the pen of power of the Pre-Eternal Inscriber. They are not games 
of chance and jumbled meaningless motion like the materialists and natural-
ists fancy. For similarly to all beings, every particle says “ In the Name of 
Allah ” at the start of its motion, and it raises loads inﬁnitely exceeding its 
strength. For example, a seed the size of a wheat grain shoulders a load the 
size of a huge pine tree. And on completion of its duty, it says “ All praise 
be to Allah. ” For by exhibiting an art that is beautiful and full of purpose 
and a decoration that is ﬁne and full of beneﬁts which astound all minds, 
it displays a work of art like an ode in praise of the Glorious Maker. Look 
carefully at pomegranates and ears of corn, for example.

Indeed,  the  transformations  of  particles  are  the  motion  and  meaning-
ful vibrations that proceed according to the dictation and principles of the 
Clear Record, which is a title of divine knowledge and command and is the 
arrangement of the past origin and future progeny of everything in the World 
of the Unseen. They proceed by means of transcription from the  Clear Book, 

617

618

THE WORDS

which is a title for divine power and will and is formed of present time and 
the Manifest World and consists of the free disposal of that power and will 
in the creation of things. Thus, this motion and meaningful vibration pro-
ceed from the writing and drawing of the words of power in the Tablet of 
Effacement and Reafﬁrmation, which is a metaphorical page and the reality 
of the stream of time. 1

1.  This footnote is an explanation of the long sentence [ here, a paragraph ] deﬁning 

the transformations of minute particles, which is the subject of the Second Aim. 

The Clear Record and the Clear Book are repeated in several places in the All-Wise 
Qur’an. One group of commentators maintained that they are the same, while others stated 
that they are different from one another. Their explanations as to their true meanings were 
diverse, but in short they agreed that they are both titles to describe divine knowledge. 
However, through the effulgence of the Qur’an, I came to the conclusion that the Clear 
Record, which looks more to the World of the Unseen than to the Manifest World, was a 
title for one aspect of Allah’s knowledge and His command. That is to say, it looks more to 
the past and future than to present time. It looks more to the origin and progeny and to the 
roots and seeds of everything, rather than to them in their visible existence. It is a notebook 
of divine determining. The existence of this notebook has been proved in the Twenty-Sixth 
Word and also in the footnote of the Tenth Word.

Yes, the Clear Record is a sort of title of the knowledge and commands of Allah. That 
is to say, the origins, sources, and roots from which things are brought into existence with 
perfect order and art show that they must be arranged in accordance with a notebook of the 
principles of divine knowledge. And because the results, progeny, and seeds of things con-
tain the indexes and programmes of beings which will come into existence subsequently, 
they indicate that they must be a small register of divine commands.

For example, a seed may be seen as the programme and index that will give form to 
the structure of the tree, and may also be seen as the tiny embodiment of the commands 
that cause the tree to come into existence and determine its programmes and indexes. In 
short, the Clear 

Record  is  like  an  index  and  programme  of  the  tree  of  creation,  which  spreads  its 
branches through every part of the past and the future and of the World of the Unseen. In 
this sense, the Clear Record is a notebook and register of the principles of divine determin-
ing. Through the dictation and requirement of those principles, particles are employed in 
their duties and motion in things, as those things come into existence.

As for the Clear Book, it looks more to the Manifest World than to the World of the 
Unseen. That is to say, it looks more to present time than to the past and the future. It is a 
title, a notebook, a book of the will and power of Allah, rather than of His knowledge and 
commands. If the Clear Record is the notebook of divine determining, the Clear Book is 
the notebook of divine power. That is to say, the fact that everything in its existence, es-
sence, attributes and functions displays perfect art and order proves that it has been given 
existence  through  the  laws  of  an  effective  will  and  the  principles  of  a  ﬂawless  power. 
And, in addition to its speciﬁed and individual form, everything has been given an ap-
pointed measure and particular shape. Therefore, the power and will have a universal and 
comprehensive register of laws, a great ledger, according to which the particular form and 
substance of everything is cut out, sewn and clothed. The existence of this ledger, like the 
Clear Record, has been proved among the questions of divine determining and man’s will

FIRST POINT

First Matter

The First Point discusses two matters.
FIRST MATTER: In both the motion of particles and in their rest two 
lights of divine unity shine like the sun. For as is proved brieﬂy in the First 
Indication  of  the  Tenth  Word  and  in  detail  in  the  Twenty-Second  Word, 
if every particle is not an ofﬁcial of Allah acting with His permission and 
under His authority, and if it is not undergoing change within His knowledge 
and  power,  then  each  must  have  inﬁnite  knowledge  and  limitless  power; 
it  must  have  eyes  that  see  everything,  a  face  that  looks  to  all  things,  and 
authority over all things. For every particle of the elements acts, or can act, 
in an orderly fashion in all animate beings. But the order within things and 
the laws according to which they are formed differ from one thing to the 
next. If their order was not known to the particles, the particles could not 
act,  or  even  if  they  could  act,  they  could  not  act  without  error;  whereas 
they do act without error. In which case, the particles which are perform-
ing  their  duties  in  beings  are  either  acting  with  the  permission  and  at  the 
command, and within the knowledge and at the will, of the possessor of an 
all-encompassing knowledge, or they themselves must possess such an all-
encompassing knowledge and power.

Yes,  all  particles  of  air  can  enter  the  bodies  of  all  animate  beings,  the 
fruits  of  all  ﬂowers,  and  the  structures  of  all  leaves.  They  can  act  within 
them, although the way the beings are formed is all different and their order 

== Just look at the stupidity of the people of neglect, misguidance and philosophy, 
they have perceived that Preserved Tablet of creative power, and the manifestation, re-
ﬂection, and demonstration in things of that perspicaciously written book of dominical 
wisdom  and  will,  and  yet, Allah  forbid,  by  naming  it  nature,  they  have  made  it  com-
pletely  meaningless. Whereas,  by  means  of  the  dictation  of  the  Clear  Record,  that  is, 
through the decree and instruction of divine determining, divine power is creating the 
chain of beings, each link of which is a sign in the creation of things. It is causing the 
motion of particles, it is writing on the metaphorical page of time, which is called the 
Tablet of Effacement and Reafﬁrmation.

Thus, the motion of particles is the vibration and motion from that writing and tran-
scription which occurs while beings pass from the World of the Unseen to the Manifest 
World,  as  they  pass  from  knowledge  to  power. And  as  for  the Tablet  of  Effacement  of 
Reafﬁrmation, it is a slate for writing and erasing, an ever-changing notebook of the Su-
preme Preserved Tablet, which is ﬁxed and constant. It is its notebook in the sphere of 
contingency, where all things are unceasing manifestations of life and death, existence and 
ephemerality. And this is the reality of time. Indeed, what we call time, which is a mighty 
river ﬂowing in creation, has a reality like everything else. Its reality is like the ink and the 
page of the writing of power in the Tablet of Effacement and Reafﬁrmation.

and systems quite distinct. As though the factory of a ﬁg were a loom for 
weaving cloth and the factory of a pomegranate, a machine for  producing 
sugar, and so on; the programmes of their structures and bodies all differ 
from each other. A particle of air, then, enters or can enter all of them. It 
takes up its position and acts in a wise and masterly fashion without error. 
And on completion of its duty it departs. A mobile particle of mobile air, 
therefore,  either  must  know  the  forms,  shapes,  measures,  and  formations 
with which plants and animals, and even fruits and ﬂowers, are clothed, or 
else it must be an ofﬁcial acting under the command and will of one who 
does know.

Similarly  with  a  stationary  particle  of  stationary  earth:  since  it  has  the 
ability to be the means and place of cultivation for the seeds of ﬂowering 
plants and fruit-bearing trees, either there must be in the particle itself or in 
the handful of soil that is its little house immaterial machinery and factories 
in good working order to the number of the varieties of the trees and plants, 
and ﬂowers and fruits – in fact, it is in every single particle that there must 
be a factory peculiar to it and all the equipment and machinery necessary for 
the running of the factory – or else it must have a miraculous knowledge that 
knows all things about all things and a miracle-working power that creates 
everything from nothing; or, those duties are performed at the command and 
with the permission of One Knowing of All Things, and through the power 
and might of One Absolutely Powerful over All Things.

If  an  untrained  and  inexperienced,  common,  ordinary,  and  blind  man 
were to go to Europe and in all the factories there to work at all the trades 
and crafts in perfect and masterly fashion, and if he were to display a wise, 
artistic skill to such a degree that it left everyone speechless with amaze-
ment, anyone with a grain of consciousness would know that the man was 
not acting on his own initiative, but that a master of all trades was teaching 
him and causing him to work.

And if there was a blind and impotent man who lived in a simple little 
house and was unable even to rise from his place, and if small fragments of 
stone, and bits and pieces of material like bone and cotton were to enter his 
little house and then sacks of sugar, bales of cloth, crates of jewelry, ﬁnely-
made  clothes  encrusted  with  jewels,  and  delicious  foods  were  to  emerge, 
would anyone with a grain of intelligence not say: “ That man is a wretched 
doorkeeper or merely a latch on the door of the factory of a wondrous mira-
cle-working being, which is the source of his miracles ”?

THIRTIETH WORD – SECOND AIM

621

In exactly the same way, the motion and duties of particles of air in plants 
and trees, and blossom and fruit, all of which are missives of the Eternally 
Besought One, and antique dominical works of art, miracles of power, and 
wonders of wisdom, indicate that the particles are acting under  the com-
mand and at the will of an All-Wise and Glorious Maker, an All-Generous 
and Beauteous Creator.

Particles of earth, also, since they are the source and means for the shoots 
and plants produced by seeds, each of which is a different factory and work-
bench, a different printing-press, treasury, and antique, a different manifesto 
proclaiming the Glorious Maker’s names and ode hymning His perfections, 
it is as deﬁnite as two plus two equalling four that the particles of earth are 
acting at the command, with the permission, and through the will and power 
of an All-Glorious Maker Who is Lord of the command of ( 36:82 ) ² ± 
and to Whose command everything is subjugated. In this we believe.

Second Matter

SECOND  MATTER:  The  Second  Matter  indicates  brieﬂy  the  duties 

and instances of wisdom in the motion of particles.

The materialists, whose use of their reasons is limited to what is imme-
diately apparent to them, have, in their nonsensical philosophies which are 
based on foundations of futility, taken the transformations of particles, which 
they regard as the results of coincidence, as the fundamental basis of all their 
principles  and  shown  the  divine  works  and  creatures  to  result  from  those 
transformations. Anyone with a grain of intelligence would know how con-
trary to reason is their attributing creatures adorned with inﬁnite instances 
of  wisdom  to  something  based  on  purposeless,  meaningless  coincidence, 
which is quite without order.

Whereas, from the point of view of the wisdom of the All-Wise Qur’an, 
the  transformations  of  particles  have  numerous  purposes  and  duties,  and 
demonstrate  numerous  instances  of  wisdom.  The  Qur’an  points  to  these 
duties and instances of wisdom with many of its verses, such as:

( 17:44 )  o n m l k j 
We shall mention several of these by way of examples.

The First

The First: Renewing and refreshing the manifestations of His act of cre-
ation, the Necessarily Existent One takes all spirits as models and in order 
to  every  year  clothe  them  in  fresh  bodies  through  miracles  of  His  power, 
and  through  His  wisdom  to  transcribe  thousands  and  thousands  of  differ-
ent books from every book, and to demonstrate single truths in constantly 

622

THE WORDS

differing forms, and also to prepare the ground and make way for the beings, 
worlds and universes, which follow on one after the other, group by group, 
the  Glorious  Creator  causes  particles  to  move  and  employs  them  through 
His power.

The Second

The Second: The Glorious Lord of All Dominion created this world, 
and especially the ﬁeld of the face of the earth, in the form of a cultivated  
property. That is to say, He prepared it in such a way that it would ﬂourish 
and produce ever-fresh crops and He might sow and reap the numberless 
miracles of His power. Thus, by causing the motion of particles with wis-
dom and employing them in an orderly fashion in His ﬁeld of the earth, 
He displays every age, every season, every month, indeed every day, and 
every hour, endless beings through miracles of His power, each of which 
is a cosmos, and causes His ﬁeld to produce constantly differing crops. He 
demonstrates through the motion of particles, gifts from the inﬁnite treas-
ury of His mercy and samples of His endless power.

The Third

The Third: The Pre-Eternal Inscriber caused the motion of particles with 
perfect wisdom and employed them with perfect order so that, through dis-
playing the embroideries of the endless manifestations of the divine names, 
He might exhibit the endless embroideries in a limited ﬁeld, and set forth the 
manifestations of the names, and write the inﬁnite signs which will point to 
inﬁnite meanings on a small page.

Yes,  in  essence  this  year’s  crops  are  the  same  as  last  year’s,  but  their 
meanings are different. Since the relative determinations are changed, their 
meanings  change  and  increase.  And  although  the  relative  determinations 
and transient embodiments are replaced and are apparently ephemeral, their 
beautiful meanings are preserved and are constant and permanent.

Since  the  leaves,  ﬂowers,  and  fruits  of  last  spring’s  tree  do  not  have 
spirits, in reality they are the same as those of this spring, but the relative 
embodiments differ. And, the relative embodiments of this spring replace 
those  of  last  spring  with  different  embodiments  in  order  to  set  forth  the 
meanings  of  the  functions  of  the  divine  names,  whose  manifestations  are 
being constantly renewed.

The Fourth

The Fourth: The All-Wise and Glorious One causes the motion of par-
ticles in the narrow tillage of this world, in the workshop and ﬁeld of the 
face of the earth, thus making the cosmos as ﬂowing and beings as travel-
ling, in order to grow things like crops or items for decoration or provision 
suitable for the broad World of the Inner Dimensions of Things and end-
less other worlds of the hereafter, such as the inﬁnite World of Similitudes. 

THIRTIETH WORD – SECOND AIM

623

He thus grows in this small world vast quantities of crops appropriate for 
those vast worlds. He causes an endless ﬂood to ﬂow through the world from 
the inﬁnite treasury of His power and to pour into the World of the Unseen, 
and some of it into the worlds of the hereafter.

The Fifth

The  Fifth:  By  causing  the  motion  of  particles  with  perfect  wisdom 
through His power and employing them with perfect order in order to dis-
play inﬁnite divine perfections, endless manifestations of beauty and glory, 
and countless dominical gloriﬁcations in this narrow and limited ﬁeld and  
ﬁnite and short time, He causes endless gloriﬁcation in ﬁnite time and in a 
limited  ﬁeld.  He  displays  inﬁnite  manifestations  of  His  beauty  and  glory 
and perfection. He creates many truths related to the Unseen, many fruits 
for the hereafter, and a great many embroideries and meaningful weavings 
from the enduring selfhood and forms of ephemeral creatures appropriate 
for the World of Similitudes and the Tablet. Therefore, the One Who causes 
the motion of particles is the One Who displays these grand purposes and 
mighty instances of wisdom. If it were otherwise, there would have to be a 
brain as huge as the sun in every particle.

Those brainless philosophers suppose to be purposeless the transforma-
tions  of  particles,  which  occur  with  wisdom  not  limited  to  the ﬁve  above 
examples, but with inﬁnite wisdom. They fancy the particles, which revolve 
like  Mevlevi  dervishes  glorifying  Allah  and  reciting  His  names  in  two 
ecstatic movements, one turning on their own axes, the other describing cir-
cles, to be reeling around as though stunned and aimless. It may be under-
stood from this, then, that their knowledge is not knowledge, it is ignorance, 
and their philosophy, futility.

( A sixth and lengthy example will be discussed in the Third Point. )

Second Point

SECOND POINT

In  every  particle  there  are  two  truthful  evidences  to  the  existence  and 
unity of the Necessarily Existent One. Indeed, a particle bears decisive wit-
ness  to  the  existence  of  the  Necessarily  Existent  One  by  carrying  out  its 
important duties consciously and by raising mighty loads despite being pow-
erless and lifeless. And by conforming to the general order peculiar to each 
place it enters and by settling anywhere as though it were its homeland, it 
testiﬁes to the unity of the Necessarily Existent One and to the oneness of 
that Being Who is the Owner of all things, with their apparent faces and their 
inner aspects which look to Him. That is to say, whoever owns the particles 
must also own all the places it enters.

624

THE WORDS

Thus, since the particle is impotent and its loads are extremely heavy and 
its duties endless, it demonstrates that it is mobile and acting at the com-
mand of a Possessor of Absolute Power and in His name. And the fact that it 
conforms as though knowingly to the universal cosmic order and enters each 
place without obstacle shows that it acts through the power and wisdom of a 
single Possessor of Absolute Knowledge.

A private soldier has relations with his squad, his company, his battalion, 
his regiment, and his division, and so on, and has duties in connection with 
each. Since he knows all those relations and duties, he will act in conform-
ity with them. For having received training and instruction under  military 
discipline, he complies with the rules and regulations of a single supreme 
commander who commands all those sections.

In the same way, all particles are suitably placed within compounds, and 
with  every  facet  of  the  compounds  have  different  beneﬁcial  relations  and 
different well-regulated duties that yield wise results that are all different. 
It  is  therefore  surely  only  One  in  the  grasp  of  whose  power  is  the  whole 
universe who can place the particles in such a way as to preserve all their 
relations with all the facets of the compounds and duties in them, and not 
spoil the wise results.

For example, a particle located in Tevﬁk’s 1 eye is suitably placed with 
regard  to  the  blood-vessels  like  the  arteries  and  veins,  and  the  motor  and 
sensory nerves, and has a wise and purposeful relationship with the face, and 
then with the head, the trunk, and with the entire human body, and has ben-
eﬁcial duties in relation to each. This demonstrates that only one who creates 
all the members of the body will be able to place the particle in that position.
Particles entering the body as sustenance in the caravan of food in par-
ticular make their journey with astonishing order and wisdom. On their way, 
they pass through modes and stages in an orderly manner, and progressing 
consciously  without  confusion  carry  on  till  they  are  strained  through  the 
four ﬁlters in the bodies of animate beings. They are then loaded onto the 
red blood corpuscles in order to come to the assistance of the members and 
cells which are in need of sustenance, rendering this assistance according to 
a law of generosity. It may be clearly understood from this that the One Who 
drives these particles and causes them to pass through thousands of different 
states must of necessity be a Generous Sustainer, a Compassionate Creator, 
in relation to Whose power particles and stars are equal.

Moreover,  all  particles  act  within  embroideries  of  the  greatest  art  and 
have relations with all the other particles therein. Since each is in a position 
of  both  dominance  and  subjection  to  all  the  rest,  both  to  each  individually 
and to all of them generally, it either knows and creates that wonderfully skil-
ful embroidery and wisdom-displaying ornamented art, which is a thousand 
times impossible, or each of them is a point assigned to that motion, which 
proceeds from the All-Wise Maker’s law of determining and pen of power.
For example, if the stones of the dome of Aya Sophia are not dependent 
on the command and skill of its architect, all the stones must have skill in  
the art of building like that of the architect Sinan, and must be both subject 
to,  and  dominant  over,  the  rest  of  the  stones.  That  is,  they  must  have  the 
power to say: “ Come, we shall stand shoulder to shoulder in order not to fall 
and collapse. ”

In the same way, if the particles in creatures, which are thousands of times 
more skilfully fashioned, wonderful, and full of wisdom than the dome of 
Aya Sophia, are not dependent on the command of the master builder of the 
universe, to each of them must the ascribed as many attributes of perfection 
as those of the universe’s Maker.

Glory  be  to  Allah!  Since  the  unbelievers  do  not  accept  a  Necessarily 
Existent  One,  they  are  compelled  according  to  their  beliefs  to  accept  as 
many  false  gods  as  there  are  particles.  Thus,  no  matter  how  illustrious  a 
philosopher or scholar an unbeliever may be, he is in profound ignorance to 
the utmost degree.

Third Point

THIRD POINT

This Point indicates the sixth example of the mighty instances of wisdom 
in the motion of particles, which was promised at the end of the First Point.
As was stated in the footnote to the answer to the Second Question in 
the Twenty-Eighth Word, a further instance of wisdom of the thousands 
found  in  the  transformations  of  particles  and  their  motion  in  the  bodies 
of  animate  beings,  is  to  illuminate  the  particles  and  to  make  them  alive 
and meaningful so as to be ﬁtting for the construction of the world of the 
hereafter.  It  is  as  if  the  bodies  of  animals  and  humans,  and  even  plants, 
are like guesthouses, barracks, and schools for those who enter in order to 
take lessons and be trained; inanimate particles enter them and are illumi-
nated. Simply, the particles receive training and instruction and acquire a 
ﬁneness. By fulﬁlling different duties, they become worthy to be particles 
in the world of permanence and the realm of the hereafter, which is alive 
with all of its elements.

THE WORDS

of particles?

QUESTION: How is it known that there is this wisdom in the motion 

ANSWER: Firstly: It is known through the wisdom of the Maker, which 
is proved by all the wise beneﬁts and purposes and the order in creatures. 
For  a  wisdom  that  attaches  universal  wisdom  to  the  most  particular  thing 
would not leave the motion of particles without wisdom and purpose, for 
they demonstrate the greatest activity in the ﬂood of the universe and are 
the means for embroideries full of wisdom. Also, a wisdom and sovereignty 
which  does  not  leave  the  smallest  creature  without  a  wage,  recompense, 
and perfection in its duties, would not leave its most numerous ofﬁcials and 
principal servants without light, without a wage.

Secondly: By causing the motion of the elements and employing them, 
the All-Wise Maker raises them to the degree of minerals as though it were a 
wage of perfection, and instructs them in the gloriﬁcation peculiar to miner-
als. And by causing the motion of minerals and employing them, He confers 
on them the rank and degree of vegetable life. And by presenting vegetable 
life in the form of sustenance, He grants it, through its motion and employ-
ment, the degree and ﬁneness of animal life. And by employing the particles 
in  animals,  He  raises  them  by  way  of  being  sustenance  to  the  degree  of 
human life. And by purifying the particles in a human body through repeated 
ﬁltering,  and  by  favouring  them,  He  promotes  them  to  the  most  delicate 
and subtle places, which are the brain and the heart. From all this it may be 
understood that the motion of particles is not without wisdom, but that the 
particles are made to hasten to a sort of perfection worthy of them. 

Thirdly: Among the particles in animate beings, some, like those in pips 
and seeds, receive such a light, ﬁneness, and quality that they are like a spirit 
or a king to the rest of the particles, to a huge tree, for example. Thus, since 
among all the particles of a huge tree some rise to this rank by fulﬁlling their 
delicate duties and passing through the many stages in the life of the tree, 
it demonstrates that at the command of the All-Wise Maker these particles 
receive a ﬁneness, light, rank, and instruction on account of and in honour of 
the divine names manifested on them in accordance with the sorts of motion 
that are the functions of their natures, and in honour of them.

TO CONCLUDE: Since 1 the All-Wise Maker has speciﬁed for every-
thing a suitable point of perfection and an appropriate level of the effulgence 
of existence, He drives them towards it by giving everything a disposition 

1.  The sentence answering this ‘since’ and that at the beginning of the following six 

paragraphs is on page 596.

THIRTIETH WORD – SECOND AIM

627

that will strive to reach that point of perfection. This law of dominicality is 
in force in all plants and animals, as it is in inanimate beings, in which it 
promotes plain earth to the rank of diamonds and to the level of priceless 
jewels. Within this truth, the tip of a mighty law of dominicality is apparent.
And since the All-Generous Creator bestows as payment to the animals 
He employs in the mighty law of generation a particular pleasure as a sort of 
wage. And He gives a wage of perfection to the animals employed in  other 
dominical functions, like bees and nightingales, for example. He confers on 
them a level whereat they feel eagerness and receive pleasure. And within 
this the tip of a mighty law of generosity is apparent.

And since the reality of everything looks to the manifestation of one of 
Allah Almighty’s names, and is bound to it, and is a mirror to it; whatever 
beauty is apparent in each, it is due to the name; the name requires it to be 
thus. Whether or not the thing is aware of it, in the view of reality the beauty 
is demanded. And from this truth, the tip of a most mighty law of beauty and 
making beautiful is apparent.

And since, as is necessitated by His law of generosity, when the life of 
a thing ends, the Generous Creator does not take back the rank and perfec-
tion He has bestowed on it, but makes permanent the fruits, results, and real 
meaning and identity of that bearer of perfection, and, if it has a spirit, its 
spirit. For example, He makes permanent the meanings and fruits of the per-
fections He has made manifest on man in this world. He will even return to 
a thankful believer in the form of a fruit of Paradise the embodiment of the 
thanks and praise for the transient fruits that he has eaten. And in this truth, 
the tip of a mighty law of mercy is apparent.

And since the Peerless Creator wastes nothing, He does nothing in vain. 
He even utilizes in the creatures of springtime the material débris of those 
of the previous autumn, who, having accomplished their duties, have died, 
including them in their construction. For sure, according to an inner mean-
ing of,

and the indication of,

( 14:48 ) u t s r q

( 29:64 ) - , + * )
it is indeed a requirement of wisdom that the particles of the earth, which 
are inanimate and unconscious yet perform important duties in this world, 
should be utilized and included in some of the constructions of the hereafter, 
the stones, the trees, and all things of which will most certainly be animate 

628

THE WORDS

and conscious. For to leave in the world the particles of the world when it 
has been destroyed or to cast them into non-existence would be wasteful. 
And from this truth, the tip of truly mighty law of wisdom is apparent.

And since the many results, meanings, and fruits of this world, and the 
woven pages of the acts and deeds, and the spirits and bodies, of those like 
jinn and human beings who are charged with the Trust are sent to the market 
of  the  hereafter.  Certainly,  it  is  a  requirement  of  justice  and  wisdom  that 
after receiving their particular perfection in accordance with the perform-
ance of their duties, the particles of the earth, which accompany and serve 
those fruits and meanings, will be included in the construction of the hereaf-
ter. That is, they will be included in it together with the débris of this world, 
which will be destroyed, after many times serving and receiving the light 
of life, and after being the means for the gloriﬁcations of animate creatures. 
And from this truth, the tip of a truly mighty law of justice is apparent.

And since, just as the spirit is dominant over the body, so the commands 
that bring things into existence, which are written by divine determining, are 
dominant over inanimate matter. Inanimate matter is able to assume a posi-
tion and an order due to the immaterial writing of divine determining. For 
example, in all kinds of eggs and sperm and varieties of seeds and grains, 
matter acquires different ranks and lights according to the commands that 
bring things into existence, which are all written differently by divine deter-
mining. The matter, which is similar in regard to its substance, 1 becomes the 
source of innumerable different beings. It obtains ranks and lights which are 
all different. Most certainly, then, it is the requirement of an all-encompass-
ing knowledge that if a particle has been repeatedly employed in the service 
of life and of the dominical gloriﬁcations that are in life, the wisdom of those 
meanings will be recorded on the immaterial forehead of the particle by the 
pen of divine determining, which neglects nothing at all. And in this, the tip 
of a truly mighty law of all-encompassing knowledge is apparent.

In Short

Since this is the case, particles are not without purpose. 2
I n   S h o r t :  A greatest name and the greatest manifestation of that great-
est name is pointed to beyond the visible tips of each of the seven above-
mentioned  laws,  that  is,  the  law  of  dominicality,  the  law  of  generosity, 

1.  Indeed, all those sorts of seeds are compounds of the four elements; they are formed 
of matter like hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. Materially they may be considered 
to be the same; the difference between them lies only in the immaterial writing of divine 
determining.

the law of beauty, the law of mercy, the law of wisdom, the law of justice, 
and  the  law  of  all-encompassing  knowledge,  and  of  a  great  many  other 
vast laws. It may be understood from that manifestation that, like the rest 
of the creatures, the transformations of particles in this world are occur-
ring  within  a  sensitive  balance  measured  with  knowledge,  according  to 
the commands given by divine power that bring things into existence, on 
the limits drawn by divine determining, for most exalted instances of wis-
dom.  Simply, they are being prepared to go to another higher world. 1 In 
which case, the bodies of animate beings are each like schools, barracks, 
and guesthouses for the instruction of those travelling particles. It may be 
stated with certainty that it is so.

Conclusion

CONCLUSION

assemblages  of  particles  say:  ِ
they are in motion.

As is stated and proved in the First Word, all things say: “ In the Name 
of Allah. ” Thus, like all beings, all particles and all groups and particular 
ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92)  with  the  tongue  of  disposition,  and 
According to what is inferred by the previous three Points, at the begin-
ning of their motion all particles recite through the tongue of disposition: 
ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) That is, “ I am moving in the name of Allah, for His 
ِم(cid:193) ِ(cid:110)َ
sake, with His permission, and through His power. ” Then, like all creatures, 
at the end of their motion, all particles and all groups of particles declare 
through the tongue of disposition: ﮱﮑ(cid:193) ۪(cid:175)ـَ(cid:170)اَ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)ا  ّ
ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا Each particle thus 
shows itself to be like the tip of a tiny pen of power tracing the embroider-
ies of the skilfully-worked creatures, which are like odes of praise. Indeed, 
each of them is like the point of a needle turning on creatures, which in turn

1.  For, as may be observed, the light of life is kindled and scattered most freely in 
this turbid and lowly world with an activity that is extremely extensive, and a fresh light 
of life is illuminated widely, even in insigniﬁcant material and rotten substances, and that 
dense and insigniﬁcant matter is reﬁned and polished with the light of life. This indicates 
clearly that this turbid and lifeless world is being dissolved, polished and made beautiful 
through the motion of particles and the light of life for the sake of another subtle, exalted, 
pure and living world. It is as if it is being adorned in order to go to some subtle world. If 
those people, therefore, whose minds are so straitened that they cannot squeeze into them 
the idea of bodily resurrection look with the light of the Qur’an, they will see a law of the 
Self-Subsistent One through which the universe subsists that is so comprehensive as to 
resurrect all particles as though they were an army. It may be clearly seen to be in force 
and prevailing over creation.

The Thirty-First Word 

On the Ascension of the Prophet Muhammad

( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 

[ NOTE: The Ascension is a question that results from the fundamentals 
and pillars of belief and follows on after them; it is a light that draws 
strength from the lights of the pillars of belief. For which reason the 
Ascension cannot be proved independently to irreligious atheists who 
do not accept the pillars of belief, because it cannot be discussed with 
people who neither know Allah, nor recognize the Prophet ( UWBP ), 
nor accept the angels, and who deny the existence of the heavens. Those 
pillars must ﬁrst be proved. This being the case, we shall address the 
discussion to a believer who, since he considers it unlikely, has misgiv-
ings about the Ascension; we shall explain it to him. However, from 
time to time we shall take into account the atheist who is the position 
of listener and address the matter to him. Some ﬂashes of the truth of 
the Ascension have been mentioned in others of the Words. Here, at the 
insistence of my brothers, we seek grace from Almighty Allah that we 
may unite all those different ﬂashes with the essence of the truth, and 
with them form a mirror to the beauty of Muhammad’s ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ) perfections and attainments. ]

( 53:4-18 ) { z y x w v
Since it is related to our question here, I shall expound two allusions – 
based on principles of the science of rhetoric – contained in the pronominal 
phrase “ f o r   i n d e e d   H e  ” 3 which is part of the vast treasury of the ﬁrst sub-
lime verse mentioned above. It was also explained in the discussion about 
the Qur’an’s miraculous inimitability.

After  mentioning  the  journey  of  Allah’s  Most  Noble  Beloved  ( Upon 
whom be the best of blessings and most perfect peace ) from the mosque at 
Mecca to the mosque in Jerusalem, which was the beginning of his Ascen-
sion, the All-Wise Qur’an says: 6 5 4 3 Together with the pro-
noun in the phrase, 3 which alludes to the furthest point of the Ascension 
indicated to by the verses from Sura an-Najm, this phrase refers either to 
Almighty Allah or to the Prophet ( UWBP ).

If it refers to the Prophet ( UWBP ), the rule of rhetoric and the contextual 
relationship states the following: within this particular journey was a general 
one  and  a  universal  ascent  during  which  the  Prophet  ( UWBP )  heard  and 
beheld  the  dominical  signs  and  wonders  of  divine  art  which  his  eyes  and 
ears happened upon within the universal degrees of the divine names as far 
as “ t h e   L o t e - t r e e   o f   t h e   f a r t h e s t   l i m i t   a n d   t h e   d i s t a n c e   o f   t w o   b o w - l e n g t h s . ” 
It indicates that his insigniﬁcant and particular journey was like the key to a 
journey that was both universal and an exhibition of marvels.

If the pronoun refers to Almighty Allah, it is thus: Almighty Allah invited 
one of His servants on a journey to His presence in order to entrust him with 
a duty. After sending him from the Mosque in Mecca to that in Jerusalem, 
which  is  where  the  prophets  gather,  and  causing  him  to  meet  with  them 
and demonstrating that he was the absolute heir of the principles of all the 
prophets’ religions, He took him on a journey through both the outer and the 
inner dimensions of things, as far as “ t h e   L o t e - t r e e   o f   t h e   f a r t h e s t   l i m i t   a n d  
t h e   d i s t a n c e   o f   t w o   b o w - l e n g t h s . ”

Certainly, the Prophet ( UWBP ) was a servant and the journey was a 
particular Ascension, but he had been accorded a Trust that was connected 

THIRTY-FIRST WORD – FIRST PRINCIPLE

633

to  the whole universe and had been given a light that would change the 
universe’s colour. Moreover, since he had with him the key to open the 
door  leading  to  eternal  happiness,  Allah  Almighty  bestowed  on  him  the 
attribute of “ seeing and hearing all things ” so that he might demonstrate 
the  world-embracing  comprehensive  wisdom  of  the  Trust,  light,  and 
key – wisdom and purposes which encompassed the whole universe and 
embraced all creatures.

This profound truth contains four principles.
T h e   F i r s t :  Why was the Ascension necessary?
T h e   S e c o n d :  What was the reality of the Ascension?
T h e   T h i r d :  What was the wisdom and purpose of the Ascension?
T h e   F o u r t h :  What were the fruits and beneﬁts of the Ascension?

First Principle 

The reason for the Ascension’s necessity

I t   i s   s a i d ,  for example, that Almighty Allah is 

( 50:16 ) / . - , + *   He is closer to everything than anything 
else. He is free of and beyond corporeality and space. However, the saints 
are able to converse with Him in their hearts, so why was the saint, Muham-
mad ( UWBP ), successful in holding an inward conversation with Allah that 
any saint may do in his heart, only after and as a result of a long journey like 
the Ascension?

T h e   A n s w e r :  We shall make this profound mystery easier to understand 
by  means  of  two  comparisons.  Consider  these  two  comparisons  from  the 
Twelfth Word, which are about the mystery of the Qur’an’s miraculousness 
and the mystery of the Ascension.

First Comparison

First Comparison: A king has at his disposal two sorts of interviewing, 
conversation, and discussion, and two modes of address and favour. The ﬁrst 
is to converse with a common subject about a particular matter and special 
need by means of a private telephone. The second, under the title of august 
sovereignty, in the name of supreme kingship, with the dignity of universal 
rule, and with the aim of publishing and promulgating his commands, is to 
converse and speak with an envoy connected to those matters or with a high 
ofﬁcial related to those commands. It is also to speak through an illustrious 
edict that proclaims his majesty.

634

THE WORDS

Thus,  ( 16:60 )  j  i  h  like  this  comparison,  the  Creator  of  the 
universe,  the  Lord  of  all  things  with  their  apparent  and    inner  faces,  the 
Sovereign of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, has two modes of conversing, 
speaking, and favouring. The ﬁrst is particular and private, the other univer-
sal and general. The Ascension, therefore, was a manifestation of the saint-
hood of Muhammad ( UWBP ) in the form of a universality and exaltedness 
that were superior to all other sainthoods. It was being honoured by Allah 
Almighty’s conversation and address through His name of Sustainer of All 
the Universe and title of Creator of All Beings.

Second Comparison

Second Comparison: A man holds up the mirror he is holding to the sun. 
According to its capacity, the mirror receives the seven-coloured light of the 
sun,  and  a  reﬂection.  The  man  becomes  connected  with  the  sun  and  con-
verses with it in relation to these. If he directs the luminous mirror towards 
his dark house or his tiny, private garden, which is covered by a roof, he can-
not beneﬁt proportionately to the sun’s value, but only in accordance with 
the mirror’s capacity.

A second man, however, puts down the mirror, faces the sun directly, and 
sees its majesty and understands its grandeur. Then he climbs a high moun-
tain, sees the brilliance of the sun’s broad dominion, and converses with it 
in person and without veil. Then he returns and makes large windows in his 
house and in the roof over his garden, and opens up ways to the sun in the 
sky, and speaks and converses with the constant light of the actual sun. He 
is able to speak to it gratefully as follows:

“ O amiable sun who is the beauty of the world and pet of the skies, and 
gilds the face of the earth with its light, and makes it and the faces of all the 
ﬂowers smile! You have heated and illuminated my little house and garden 
in the same way that you have illuminated the whole world and warmed the 
face of the earth. ” The ﬁrst man with the mirror, however, cannot say that, 
for the sun’s reﬂection and traces are limited and restricted by the mirror, 
and are in accordance with the restriction.

Thus, the manifestation of the Single and Eternally Besought One, the 
Pre-Eternal Sun and Post-Eternal Sovereign, appears in the human essence 
in two forms, which comprise innumerable degrees.

T h e   F i r s t  is a manifestation through a dominical relationship which is 
extended to the mirror of the heart. Through it, everyone may receive the 
particular  and  universal  manifestation  of  the  Pre-Eternal  Sun’s  light,  dis-
course, and conversation in relation to his capacity, and in the relation to the 

THIRTY-FIRST WORD – FIRST PRINCIPLE

635

manifestation of the divine names and attributes in his traversing the degrees 
in his spiritual journeying. The degrees of sainthood, which proceed under 
the shadow of certain predominant names and attributes, arise from this sort.
T h e   S e c o n d :   Since  man  possesses  comprehensiveness  and  is  the  most  
enlightened fruit of the tree of the universe, and since he is able to display 
at  once  in  the  mirror  of  his  spirit  all  the  divine  names  manifested  in  the 
universe, Almighty Allah, through the manifestation of His essence and at 
the greatest level of the most beautiful names, displayed the greatest mani-
festation  of  those  names  in  the  member  of  the  human  race  who  reﬂected 
them most comprehensively. That display and manifestation was the inner 
meaning of the Ascension of Muhammad ( UWBP ), by which his sainthood 
became the source of his messengership.

Sainthood proceeds through shadow and resembles the ﬁrst man in the 
second  comparison.  While  in  messengership  there  is  no  shadow,  it  looks 
directly to the All-Glorious One’s oneness and resembles the second man in 
the second comparison. As for the Ascension, since it was the greatest won-
der of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) sainthood and also its highest degree, it was 
transformed into the degree of messengership. The inner face of the Ascen-
sion was sainthood, it went from creation to Creator. While its apparent face 
was messengership, it came from Creator to creation. Sainthood is spiritual 
journeying  in  the  levels  close  to  Allah;  it  needs  a  certain  amount  of  time 
and many degrees must be traversed. While messengership, with its greatest 
light looks to the mystery of uncovering divine immediacy, for which the 
passing instant is sufﬁcient. For this reason it is said in the Hadith: “ He went 
and returned in an instant. ” 1

Now we say to the atheist who is in the position of listener: “ Since the 
universe resembles an orderly country, magniﬁcent city, and adorned pal-
ace, it surely must have a ruler, owner, and builder. And since there is such 
a  magniﬁcent,  All-Glorious  Owner,  All-Perfect  Ruler,  and  All-Beauteous 
Maker; and since there was a human being whose view was universal and 
who  demonstrated  a  relationship  with  the  entire  world,  country,  city,  and 
palace  and  was  connected  to  all  of  them  through  his  senses  and  faculties 
of  perception;  certainly,  the  Magniﬁcent  Maker  would  have  an  elevated 
relationship to the fullest degree with that human being, whose view was 
universal and consciousness comprehensive, and would favour him with an 
exalted and sacred address.

THE WORDS

Among those who manifested this relationship from the time of Adam 
( Upon whom be peace ) up to now, Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ) demonstrated it at the very fullest degree according 
to the testimony of his achievements, that is, his having taken half the globe 
and a ﬁfth of humankind under this direction and control and having  trans-
formed and illuminated the spiritual shape of the universe. This being so, 
comprising the very fullest degree of that relationship, the Ascension was 
indeed worthy of him and suitable for him.

Second Principle 

What was the reality of the Ascension?

T h e   A n s w e r :  It consisted of the journeying of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) 
person through the degrees of perfection; that is, through the various names 
and titles Almighty Allah makes manifest in the disposition of creatures. By 
showing one by one that special servant of His all the works of His domini-
cality which He displays in the spheres, creation, and regulation within the 
sovereignty of His dominicality, and in the levels of the heavens within those 
spheres – each of which is the pivot of a seat of dominicality and centre for 
the  disposal  of  power  –  Allah  Almighty  made  that  servant  both  embrace 
all human perfections, and display all the divine manifestations, and view 
all the levels of the universe. He made him the herald of the sovereignty of 
dominicality and the proclaimer of those things pleasing to Allah, and the 
solver of the talisman of the universe. And to do this, He mounted him on 
Buraq, caused him to ﬂash through the heavens like lightning traversing all 
its  levels,  observe  divine  dominicality  from  mansion  to  mansion  like  the 
moon, and from sphere to sphere, and showing him each of the prophets, his 
brothers, whose abodes are in the heavens of those spheres, He raised him 
to the station of “ a   d i s t a n c e   o f   t w o   b o w - l e n g t h s  ”( 53:9 ) and displayed to him 
His oneness and His Word and the vision of Himself. 1

This exalted truth may be examined through the telescope of two com-

parisons.

First Comparison

First Comparison: As is explained in the Twenty-Fourth Word, a king 
has different titles in the different spheres and ofﬁces of his government, 
different  qualities  and  attributes  in  the  classes  of  his  subjects,  and  dif-
ferent  names  and  marks  in  the  degrees  of  his  sovereignty.  For  example, 

1.    See,  al-Ṭabarī,  J ā m i ‘   a l - B a y ā n ,  xv,  6;  a l - A ḥ ā d ī t h   a l - M u k h t ā r a ,  vi,  258-9;  Ibn 

Kathīr, a l - B i d ā y a , iii, 109-18.

THIRTY-FIRST WORD – SECOND PRINCIPLE

637

he is wise judge in the judiciary, sovereign in the civil service, commander-
in-chief in the army, caliph in the learned establishment, and so on; it is 
the same with the rest of his names and titles. In each sphere he has a seat 
or chair which represents a throne. The single king may be able to have a 
thousand names  and titles in those spheres of sovereignty and levels of 
government; he may have a thousand thrones of sovereignty one within the 
other. It is as if the ruler is present and knowing in every sphere through 
his collective personality and through his telephone; and sees and is seen 
in every class through his law, regulation, and representatives; and admin-
isters and observes from behind the veil in every level through his com-
mand, knowledge, and power; and has a different centre and headquarters 
in every sphere; their decrees  are all different from one another, and their 
levels are all different from one another.

Thus, a king such as this may allow a person of his choosing to visit all 
his different spheres and ofﬁces and may show him the imperial dominion 
and sovereign commands special to each. He may cause him to travel from 
sphere to sphere and from level to level until he brings him to his presence. 
There he will entrust him with certain universal and general commands con-
cerning all those spheres and will send him back.

Similarly to this comparison, the Sustainer of All the Worlds, Who is the 
Sovereign of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, has functions and attributes in 
the levels of His dominicality which are all different but which look to one 
another; and names and signatures in the spheres of His divinity which are 
all different but which appear one within the other; and manifestations and 
revelations in the performance of His splendid deeds which are all different 
but which resemble each other; and titles in the disposal of His power which 
are all different, but which hint of one another; and sacred appearances in the 
manifestation of His attributes which are all different but which all point to 
each other; and acts of disposal in the manifestation of His actions which are 
all different but complete one another; and He has a majestic dominicality in 
His multicoloured art and creatures whose aspects are all different but which 
gaze on one another.

As  a  consequence  of  this  vast  mystery,  He  ordered  the  universe  and 
arranged it in an amazing and wonderful fashion with different formations 
one over the other from particles, which are the tiniest level of creatures, to 
the heavens, and from the ﬁrst level of the heavens to the Sublime Throne. 
Each heaven is like the roof of a different world, a throne for dominicality, 
a centre for divine disposal.

638

THE WORDS

For  sure,  with  regard  to  divine  oneness,  all  the  divine  names  may  be 
found  in  those  spheres  and  levels;  they  are  manifested  together  with  the 
titles. But just as in the ministry of justice the title of wise judge was fun-
damental and dominant and there the rest of the king’s titles looked to its 
command and were dependent on it, so in each level of creatures, in each 
heaven, one name, one divine title, is dominant, and the other titles look to it.
For example, in whichever sphere of the heavens the Prophet Muham-
mad (Upon whom be blessings and peace) met with Jesus (Upon whom be 
peace), who was distinguished by the name of All-Powerful, in that sphere 
Allah  Almighty  Himself  was  manifested  with  title  of  All-Powerful.  And, 
for example, the most predominant in that sphere of the heavens which is 
Moses’ (Upon whom be peace) seat is the title of Speaker, by which he was 
distinguished. And so on.

Thus,  since  the  person  of  Muhammad  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace ) manifested the greatest name,1 and all the divine names,2 and since 
his prophethood was universal, he was surely connected with all the spheres 
of  dominicality.  His  meeting  with  the  prophets  whose  seats  are  in  those 
spheres and passing through all those levels surely necessitates the fact of 
the Ascension.

Second Comparison

Second Comparison: The title of commander-in-chief, which is one of 
the  king’s  titles,  is  manifested  and  makes  an  appearance  in  every  rank  of 
the army from the broad and universal rank of the commander-in-chief to 
the special and particular rank of a corporal. For example, a private sees in 
the person of his corporal a sample of the imposing title of commander-in-
chief, he looks to it and takes his orders from it. On becoming a corporal, the 
manifestation of the title of the sergeant’s rank will command his attention 
and it will be to that that he will look. Then, if he is promoted to the rank 
of  sergeant,  he  will  see  a  sample  of  the  commander-in-chief’s  title  and  a 
manifestation of it in the lieutenant’s rank. It will be present together with a 
seat peculiar to it at that rank. And so on. He will see the title in relation to 
its smallness or largeness in each of its ranks of captain, major, general, and 
ﬁeld marshal.

Now,  if  the  commander-in-chief  wishes  to  entrust  the  private  with  a 
duty related to all the ranks of the army, if he wishes to promote him to a 
rank where he can observe each sphere like an inspector and himself be

observed; he will cause him to make a tour of inspection of the ranks, from 
that of the corporal to the highest, and will also allow him to be seen. Then 
he will receive him into his presence and honouring him with conversa-
tion and conferring on him a decoration and a decree, will send him back 
whence he came in an instant.

The following point must be noted in this comparison: if the king is in 
no way powerless and if he has spiritual power in the same way that he has  
material power, he will not appoint persons like the general, ﬁeld marshal 
and lieutenant as his representatives but will himself be present everywhere 
in person. He will give his orders directly, merely from behind certain veils 
and individuals, themselves of rank. In fact, there are narrations relating that 
certain kings who were saints of the highest level executed their affairs in 
many spheres in the form of different individuals.

Concerning  the  truth  we  looked  at  in  this  comparison,  since  the  com-
mander-in-chief  was  in  no  way  impotent,  the  order  and  command  came 
directly from him in every sphere. Affairs were executed through his com-
mand, will, and power.

As in this comparison, the commands and authoritative functions of the 
Sovereign of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, Who is the Ruler of the heav-
ens and the earth, Owner of the command of of  ( 36:82 ) ² ± and and 
the Absolute Commander, are in force in all the levels of creatures and are 
conformed to with perfect obedience and order. Each of the commands and 
functions  appears  as  a  sphere  of  dominicality,  a  level  of  rulership  in  the 
levels of creatures and classes of beings, which stretch from particles to the 
planets and from ﬂies to the heavens, and which, great and small, particular 
and universal, are all different but are such that they look one to the other.

Now, the way to understand the exalted aims and mighty results of the 
entire universe and to see all the different duties of worship of all its levels; 
and, through observing the sovereignty of the Supreme Being’s dominicality 
and the splendour of His rule, to understand what is pleasing to Him; and 
to be the herald of His sovereignty, one should make a journey through all 
those levels and spheres as far as the sublime throne, which is the title of the 
greatest sphere; as far as “ T h e   d i s t a n c e   o f   t w o   b o w - l e n g t h s , ”( 53:9 ) that is, 
the station between the spheres of contingency and necessity indicated by 
“ T h e   d i s t a n c e   o f   t w o   b o w - l e n g t h s , ”  to meet there with the All-Glorious and 
Beauteous One. This journey is the reality of the Ascension.

THE WORDS

Just  as  ordinary  human  beings  travel  in  the  mind  with  the  speed  of 
imagination, and saints journey in the heart with the speed of lightning, and 
angels, which are luminous bodies, circulate with the speed of spirit from 
the throne to the earth and from the earth to the throne; and the people of 
Paradise will rise to Paradise from the resurrection with the speed of Buraq 
across  a  distance  greater  than  ﬁve  hundred  years;  1  so,  of  a  certainty,  the 
body of Muhammad ( UWBP ) went together with his elevated spirit as far as 
the divine throne. For Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) body was the treasury of the 
faculties of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) spirit, and the means by which its duties  
were performed. For his spirit was light and had the characteristics of light, 
was subtler than the hearts of the saints, more insubstantial than the spirits 
of the dead and angelic bodies, and more ethereal than the astral bodies and 
subtle bodies.

Now we consider the atheist who is listening. It comes to mind that he 
would  think  of  saying:  “ I  do  not  recognize  Allah  and  I  do  not  know  the 
Prophet ( UWBP ), how should I believe in the Ascension? ” To which we 
would reply as follows.

Since the universe and beings exist, and within them are acts and crea-
tion; and since an orderly act cannot occur without an author, a meaningful 
book  cannot  be  without  a  scribe,  and  a  skilful  embroidery  be  without  an 
embroiderer; the purposeful acts which ﬁll the universe must surely have an 
author, and the meaningful letters and amazing embroideries which cover 
the  face  of  the  earth  and  are  renewed  from  season  to  season  must  have  a 
scribe and an embroiderer.

Also, since two governors directing the same matter spoils the matter’s 
order, and since from a ﬂy’s wing to the lamps in the heavens there is perfect 
order, there must be only one governor, one ruler. For the art and wisdom in 
everything are so wonderful that it necessitates that the Maker of one thing 
is powerful over all things, to the extent that He is capable of everything and 
He knows every matter. Since this is so, if He were not One, there would 
have to be gods to the number of beings. These would be both opposed to 
and similar to one another, and it would then be totally impossible for this 
wonderful order not to be broken.

Furthermore,  since  as  is  self-evidently  apparent,  at  a  command  the 
classes  of  beings  are  in  motion  in  a  thousand  times  more  orderly  fashion 
than an army – each group, from the stars, sun and moon and their motions

to the ﬂowers of the almond, displaying the decorations and uniforms the 
Pre-Eternal All-Powerful One has conferred on it, and the motion He has 
determined, a thousand times more regularly and perfectly than an army – 
since this is so, the universe has an Absolute Ruler behind the veil of the 
Unseen to Whose command its beings look and conform.

And since according to the testimony of all the wise matters He carries 
out and splendid works He displays, the Ruler is an All-Glorious Sovereign; 
and since according to the bounties He demonstrates He is a most Compas-
sionate Sustainer, and according to the beautiful examples of His art which 
He exhibits, He is a Maker Who loves His art; and since He is an All-Wise 
Creator Who wishes to attract to His works of art the admiring gazes of con-
scious beings through the adornments and skills He demonstrates; and since 
it may be understood that He wishes to make known to  conscious beings 
the meaning of the adornments, which astound the mind, that He displays 
in the creation of the world and to inform them through the wisdom of His 
dominicality about where creatures come from and where they are going; 
most certainly, this All-Wise Ruler and All-Knowing Maker wishes to dem-
onstrate His dominicality.

And since he wishes to make Himself known and loved by conscious 
creatures  through  the  great  many  works  of  benevolence  and  mercy  and 
wonders of art He displays, He will surely make known to them by means 
of a herald what He desires of them and the things that please Him, and 
concern them. 

Since this is so, He will appoint one of the conscious beings and will pro-
claim His dominicality through him. He will honour a herald with the prox-
imity of His presence and make him the means of exhibiting the art which 
He loves. He will appoint one of them as a teacher to inform other conscious 
beings of those exalted aims and to display His perfections. He will certainly 
appoint a guide so that the talisman contained in the universe and the riddle 
of dominicality He has concealed within beings will not remain meaning-
less. And He will appoint a guide who will teach the purposes contained in 
the beauties of art He displays and publishes as a spectacle for all to gaze on 
so that they do not remain useless and vain. Moreover, in order to announce 
to conscious beings the things that please Him, He will raise one of them to 
a rank above the others, and will inform him of those things and send him 
to them.

Since reality and wisdom require it to be thus and the one most worthy 
to perform this duty was the Prophet Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings 

642

THE WORDS

and peace ), for he actually performed those duties most perfectly, to which 
fact the world of Islam which he founded and the light of Islam which he 
showed are truthful and just witnesses; this necessitates that he should have 
risen above all the rest of the universe, surpassed all beings, and attained to a 
rank at which he held a universal, elevated, and all-embracing conversation 
with the Creator of all beings. The Ascension expresses this truth as well.

I n   S h o r t :  Since He has formed, arranged, and adorned the vast universe 
in this way for mighty purposes and sublime aims such as those mentioned 
above;  and  since  among  beings  humankind  exists  to  see  this  universal 
dominicality together with all its subtleties and this supreme divine sover-
eignty  together  with  all  its  truths;  most  certainly  that  Absolute  Ruler  will 
speak with human beings, He will inform them of His purposes.

Since everyone cannot free themselves from particular, insigniﬁcant, and 
lowly matters and rise to the highest and universal position, and therefore 
cannot themselves receive the Ruler’s universal address, certain special per-
sons from among human beings will be appointed to that duty so that it may 
be related to in two respects. First, in order to teach human beings, they must 
be human beings themselves. And in order to be able to receive the address 
directly, they must be extremely exalted spiritually.

Thus, since among those human beings the one who made known the pur-
poses of the universe’s Maker most perfectly, disclosed the talisman of the 
universe and solved the riddle of creation, and who heralded the sublimity 
of the sovereignty of dominicality in the best way was Muhammad ( Upon 
whom  be  blessings  and  peace ),  certainly,  of  all  human  beings  he  would 
make a spiritual journey in the form of an Ascension touring the corporeal 
world; he would traverse all the levels to beyond the intermediate world of 
the divine names, the manifestation of the divine attributes and acts, and the 
levels of beings, all of which are known as the seventy thousand veils. 1 The 
Ascension was this.

A g a i n   t h e   f o l l o w i n g   c o m e s   t o   m i n d :  O listener! You are thinking of ask-
ing: “ How should I believe it? What does it mean to traverse a distance of 
thousands of years to a Sustainer Who is closer than anything else and to 
meet with Him after passing through seventy thousand veils? ” To which we 
reply as follows:

Allah  Almighty  is  closer  to  everything  than  anything  else,  but  eve-
rything  is  inﬁnitely  distant  from  Him.  For  example,  if  the  sun  possessed

consciousness and the power of speech, it would be able to converse with 
you by means of a mirror held in your hand. It would have power of dis-
posal over you as it wished. Indeed, although it would be closer to you than 
the pupil of your eye, which is like a mirror, you would be approximately 
four thousand years’ distance from it and could in no way draw nearer to 
it. If you progressed and rose to the position of the moon and came to the 
point of being face to face with it, you would still only be able to be a sort 
of mirror to it.

Similarly, although the All-Glorious One, Who is the Sun of Pre-Eternity 
and Post-Eternity, is closer to everything than anything else, everything is 
inﬁnitely distant from Him. Only one who traverses all beings, rises above 
particularity  and  gradually  passes  through  the  thousands  of  veils  in  the 
degrees of universality till he approaches a divine name which encompasses 
all beings, and then traverses the many degrees beyond it, may be honoured 
by a sort of divine proximity.

For example, a private is far inferior in rank to the commander-in-chief’s 
collective personality. He looks to his commander through the small sam-
ple of the commander’s rank he sees in his corporal, at a great distance and 
beyond many veils, as it were. To gain true proximity to his rank through 
his  collective  personality,  the  private  has  to  pass  through  many  universal 
degrees or ranks, such as that of lieutenant, captain, and major. Whereas the 
commander-in-chief can be present with the private and seeing, in person as 
well as in meaning, through his commands, regulations, view, decree, and 
knowledge. This truth has been proved decisively in the Sixteenth Word, so 
deeming that sufﬁcient, we cut short the discussion here.

A g a i n  i t  c o m e s  t o  m i n d  that you are thinking of asking: “ I deny the exist-
ence of the heavens and I do not believe in the angels, so how can I believe 
in someone travelling in the heavens and meeting with them? ”

Yes,  of  course,  it  is  difﬁcult  to  demonstrate  something  and  convince 
someone like you whose eyes are veiled and who sees only what is imme-
diately apparent to them. But the truth is so brilliant that even the blind can 
see it, so we say what is unanimously agreed, that the depths of space are 
full of matter called ether. Subtle energies like light, electricity, and heat 
point to the existence of some matter which ﬁlls space. For just as fruits 
clearly demonstrate the existence of the tree that bore them, ﬂowers their 
ﬂower bed, shoots their seedbed, and ﬁshes the sea, the stars also thrust 
before the mind’s eye the necessary existence of their source, seedbed, sea, 
and ﬂower bed.

644

THE WORDS

Since there are different formations in the world above us and different 
precepts are seen to govern under different conditions, the heavens, which 
are the source of those precepts, also differ. And since just as within man 
are immaterial faculties apart from his body, such as the mind, heart, spirit, 
imagination, and memory, certainly in the world, which is the macroanthro-
pos, and in the universe, which is the tree of which man is the fruit, there 
are other worlds besides the corporeal world. Moreover, each world has a 
heaven, from the world of the earth to the world of Paradise.

As far as the angels are concerned, we say this: on the globe of the earth, 
which is medium-sized among the planets and insigniﬁcant and dense among 
the stars, the most valuable and luminous among beings, that is, animate and 
conscious beings, are found in countless numbers. So surely the stars, which 
are like embellished castles and ﬁne palaces compared to the earth, which 
is like a dark house, and the skies, which are like the seas of the stars, will 
be the dwelling-places of angels and spirit beings, which are conscious, ani-
mate, extremely numerous, and of various sorts.

In my Qur’anic commentary called  I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z  ( Signs of  Miracu-
lousness ), both the existence and plurality of the heavens have been proved 
conclusively in the section on the verse,

( 2:29 ) Ì Ë Ê É È Ç Æ  
And in the Twenty-Ninth Word we have proved the existence of angels with 
the ﬁnality of two plus two equals four. So considering those to be sufﬁcient 
we cut short the discussion here.

In  Short:  It  is  required  by  wisdom  and  by  reason  that  the  heavens 
are  formed  of  ether,  that  they  are  the  source  of  subtle  energies  like  elec-
tricity,  light,  heat,  and  gravity,  and  that,  in  accordance  with  the  Hadith,

ّرَ(cid:107)َ(cid:174)  ( the  Milky  Way )  to  the 
closest planet they should consist of seven levels in different states and for-
mations, and that each level, from the world of the earth to the Intermediate 
Realm and World of Similitudes, to the World of the Hereafter, should have 
a heaven, like the roof of a world.

by means of the aeroplane.1 How then could someone come and go bodily 
within  a  few  minutes  covering  a  distance  that  would  normally  take  thou-
sands of years? ”

T o   w h i c h   w e   r e p l y :   According  to  your  science,  in  its  annual  rotation 
a heavy body like the earth cuts a distance of approximately one hundred 
and  eighty-eight  hours  in  one  minute.  In  one  year  it  covers  a  distance  of 
approximately  twenty-ﬁve  thousand  years.  Should  One  All-Powerful  and 
Glorious, then, Who causes its regular motion and revolves it like a stone in 
a sling be unable to convey a human being to His throne? Should a wisdom 
that causes the body of the earth, which is extremely heavy, to travel around 
the sun through a dominical law known as the sun’s gravity like a Mevlevi 
dervish be unable to raise a human body to the throne of the All-Merciful 
like lightning through the gravity of that All-Merciful One’s mercy and the 
attraction of the Pre-Eternal Sun’s love?

A g a i n  

i t   c o m e s  

t h a t   y o u   w o u l d   s a y :   “ All  right,  so  he  could 
ascend  there,  but  why  did  he  and  why  should  he?  Wouldn’t  it  have  been 
enough if he had gone just in heart and spirit like the saints? ”

t o   m i n d  

T o   w h i c h   w e   w o u l d   r e p l y :   Since  the  All-Glorious  Maker  wished  to 
display His wondrous signs which lie in both the outer aspects of things 
and in their aspects that look directly to Himself, and to make the work-
shops  and  sources  of  the  universe  spectacles  to  be  gazed  upon,  and  to 
point out the results of man’s actions in the hereafter, it was necessary to 
take together with his heart and spirit as far as His throne Muhammad’s 
( UWBP ) eyes, which were the key to the world of visible objects, and his 
ears, which perceived the signs in the world of sound. Furthermore, it is 
required by wisdom and reason that the All-Glorious Maker should have 
taken as far as His throne his blessed body, which was like the machine of 
his spirit and comprised different members and components, by means of 
which he performed his duties.

Just as in Paradise divine wisdom makes the body accompany the spirit, 
because  it  is  the  body  that  is  the  means  by  which  the  duties  of  worship 
are  performed  and  the  means  of  innumerable  pleasures  and  pains,  so  did 
Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) blessed body accompany his spirit. Since the body 
goes to Paradise together with the spirit, it is pure wisdom that He should 
have made Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) blessed body accompany his self, for it 
ascended to “ t h e   L o t e - t r e e   o f   t h e   f a r t h e s t   l i m i t , ”( 53:14 ) which is the trunk of 
the home of Paradise.

THE WORDS

A g a i n  i t  c o m e s  t o  m i n d  t h a t  y o u  w o u l d  s a y :  “ According to rational crite-
ria is it not impossible to traverse a distance of thousands of years in several 
minutes? ”

T o   w h i c h   w e   w o u l d   r e p l y :  The motion in the different works of the All-
Glorious Maker’s art varies to the utmost degree. For example, it is well-
known how the speeds of light, electricity, spirit, and imagination all differ, 
as well as that of sound. And as has been established by science, the speeds 
at which different planets travel differ so greatly it astounds the mind. How 
then could the speed his subtle body travelled as it followed his exalted spirit 
during the Ascension at the speed of spirit, seem contrary to reason?

Furthermore, it sometimes happens that on sleeping for ten minutes you 
are subject to the different states of a year. Even, if the words spoken and 
heard  during  a  minute-long  dream  were  collected  together,  a  day  or  even 
longer  would  be  needed  for  them  to  be  spoken  and  heard  in  the  waking 
world. This means that a single period of time is relative; it may seem like 
one day to one person and like a year to another.

Consider what this means with the aid of a comparison. Let us imagine 
a clock which measures the speeds at which human beings, cannonballs, 
sound, light, electricity, spirit, and imagination travel. The clock has ten 
hands. One shows the hours while another counts the minutes in a sphere 
sixty    times  greater.  Another  hand  counts  the  seconds  in  a  sphere  sixty 
times greater than the previous one, and yet others each count regularly 
decreasing fractions to a tenth of a second in vast spheres that regularly 
increase sixty times.

Let  us  suppose  that  if  the  circle  described  by  the  hour  hand  was  the 
size of our clock, that of the hand counting tenths of a second would have 
to be the size of the annual orbit of the earth, or even larger. Now, let us 
suppose there are two people. One of them is mounted on the hour hand 
and  observes  according  to  its  motion  while  the  other  is  mounted  on  the 
hand counting tenths of a second. There will be an enormous difference, 
relatively as great as the difference between our clock and the annual orbit 
of the earth, between the things observed by the two people in the same 
period of time.

Thus, since time is like a hue, shade, or ribbon of motion, a rule that is 
in force in motion is also in force in time. Therefore, although the things 
we observe in the period of one hour would be equalled in amount by the 
conscious  individual  mounted  on  the  hour  hand  of  the  clock,  similarly  to 

THIRTY-FIRST WORD – SECOND PRINCIPLE

647

the  one  mounted  on  the  hand  counting  tenths  of  a  second,  Allah’s  Noble 
Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) mounted Buraq of Divine 
Assistance and in the same space of time, in that speciﬁed hour, like light-
ning traversed the entire sphere of contingency, saw the wonders of the outer 
aspects of things and the aspects which look to their Creator, ascended to the 
point of the sphere of necessity, was honoured with divine conversation and 
favoured with the vision of divine beauty, received his decree, and returned 
to his duty. It was possible for this to happen, and it did happen.

A n d   a g a i n   i t   c o m e s   t o   m i n d   t h a t   y o u   w o u l d   s a y :  “ Yes, so it could hap-
pen, it is possible. But everything possible does not occur, does it? Is there 
anything else similar to this so that it may be accepted? How can the occur-
rence of something unparalleled be posited through probability alone? ”

T o   w h i c h   w e   w o u l d   r e p l y :  There are so many similar cases they are innu-
merable. For example, anyone with sight can ascend with his eyes from the 
ground to the planet Neptune in a second. Anyone who has knowledge can 
mount the laws of astronomy with his intellect and travel beyond the stars 
in  a  minute.  Anyone  who  has  belief  can,  by  mounting  his  thought  on  the 
actions and pillars of the obligatory prayers, through a sort of Ascension, 
leave the universe behind and go as far as the divine presence. Anyone any 
saint of perfection and seer with the heart can, through his spiritual journey-
ing,  traverse  in  forty  days  the  divine  throne  and  the  sphere  of  the  divine 
names and attributes. And certain persons,  even, like Shaykh Geylani and 
Imam-i Rabbani, truthfully recorded their spiritual ascensions as far as the 
throne, which lasted a minute.

Furthermore,  there  is  the  coming  and  going  of  the  luminous-bodied 
angels from the divine throne to the earth and from the earth to the throne in 
a brief period of time. 1 And the people of Paradise ascend to the gardens of 
Paradise from the plain of resurrection in a short space of time. Of course, so 
many examples demonstrate that it is pure wisdom, completely rational, and 
an occurrence about which there can be no doubt that the person of Muham-
mad ( UWBP ), who is the lord of all the saints, the leader of all the believers, 
the head of the people of Paradise, and is accepted by all the angels, should 
have had an ascension which was also spiritual journeying, and that it should 
have been in a manner appropriate to his rank.

THE WORDS

Third Principle 

What was the wisdom and purpose of the Ascension?

T h e   A n s w e r :   The  wisdom  of  the  Ascension  is  so  exalted  that  human 
thought cannot comprehend it. It is so profound that human thought cannot 
reach it, and so subtle and ﬁne that the intellect cannot see it by itself. But 
even if the reality of the instances of wisdom in the Ascension cannot be 
comprehended, their existence may be made known by means of a number 
of indications, as follows.

In order to demonstrate the light of His unity and the manifestation of His 
oneness in the levels of multiplicity, the universe’s Creator chose an eminent 
individual to represent all creatures, and took him by means of an Ascension 
that was like a link between the furthest levels of multiplicity and the source 
of unity. There, addressing him as the representative of all conscious beings, 
He  explained  to  him  the  divine  purposes  and  made  them  known  through 
him,  and  He  observed  through  his  gaze  the  beauty  of  His  art  and  perfec-
tion of His dominicality in the mirrors of His creatures, and caused him to 
observe them. 

Moreover, according to the testimony of His works, the world’s Maker 
possesses inﬁnite beauty and perfection. The two of them, both beauty and 
perfection, are loved for themselves. Since this is so, the One possessing that 
beauty and perfection has an inﬁnite love for them, and His inﬁnite  love is 
manifested in many different ways in His works of art. He loves His works 
of art because within them He sees His own beauty and perfection.

The  most  lovable  and  elevated  among  the  works  of  art  are  animate 
beings. The most lovable and elevated among animate beings are conscious 
beings. And by reason of their comprehensiveness, the most lovable among 
conscious beings are to be found among human beings. The most lovable 
individual among human beings is the one who has most fully developed his 
potentiality and displayed the samples of the perfections manifested in all 
creatures and spread among them.

Thus, in order to see at one point and in one mirror all the varieties of 
His love spread through creatures and to display, through the mystery of His 
oneness, all the varieties of His beauty, the Maker of beings will take a per-
son so high he is a luminous fruit of the tree of creation and whose heart is as 
though a seed containing the essential truths of the tree, and will demonstrate 
how beloved is that representative of the universe through an Ascension that 

THIRTY-FIRST WORD – THIRD PRINCIPLE

649

is like a thread linking the seed, which is the origin, with the fruit, which is 
the end. He will draw him to His presence and honour him with the vision of 
His beauty. And, in order to cause him to spread that sacred state to others, 
He will favour him with His Word and entrust him with His Decree.

In order to consider this exalted wisdom, we shall observe it through the 

telescope of two comparisons.

First Comparison

First Comparison: As is explained in detail in the story-comparison in 
the Eleventh Word, there was an illustrious king who had vast treasuries in 
which were contained many varieties of jewels. He had much skill in strange 
crafts, comprehensive knowledge of innumerable curious arts, and erudition 
and learning in numberless wondrous sciences. In accordance with the mys-
tery that everyone who possesses beauty and perfection wants both to see 
and to display his beauty and perfection, of course that skilful king wished 
to open an exhibition and to set up displays within it in order to reveal to the 
people the splendour of his sovereignty so they might gaze upon it, and to 
manifest both the glitter of his wealth and the wonders of his art and the mar-
vels of his knowledge. In this way he might observe his own transcendent 
beauty and perfection in two respects. The ﬁrst was so that he himself might 
see with his own eyes, which were cognizant of reality, while the other was 
so that he might look through the gaze of others.

As a consequence of this wisdom, he began to build a huge and splen-
did palace. It was magniﬁcently divided into apartments and mansions. He 
adorned it with every sort of bejewelled treasure from his coffers, and deco-
rated  it  with  the  ﬁnest  and  most  gorgeous  arts  of  his  own  handiwork.  He  
ordered it with the greatest reﬁnements of his knowledge and science, and 
decked it out and completed it with the miraculous works of his learning. 
Next, he spread tables with varieties of bounties and the most delicious of 
foods worthy for each group and prepared a general banquet. Then, in order 
to display his perfections to his subjects, he invited them to the banquet and 
to behold the perfections.

Then he appointed one of them as the highest ranking general, invited 
him up from the lower levels and mansions to tour sphere after sphere in the 
levels rising one after the other. Showing him the successive machinery and 
workshops of his wonderful art and the storehouses for the produce coming 
from below, he brought him to his own particular sphere and private apart-
ment. There, he honoured him by showing him the blessed person who was 
the source of all those perfections and by taking him into his presence. He 
informed him of the true nature of the palace and of his own perfections. 

650

THE WORDS

He appointed him as guide to the other spectators and sent him back. He was 
to describe to the people the palace’s maker by means of its contents, inscrip-
tions, and wonders, and inform those who entered the palace of the allusive 
meanings of the inscriptions within it, what the works of art signiﬁed, and 
what the harmonious and well-proportioned inscriptions and artefacts in its 
interior were, and how they pointed to the perfections and skills of the pal-
ace’s owner. He was also to teach them the correct behaviour and formalities 
in viewing the exhibition and to describe the protocol and ceremonies which 
were in accordance with the pleasure and desires of the learned and skilful 
king, who did not appear.

In exactly the same way, ( 16:60 )  j  i  h  the All-Glorious Maker, 
Who is the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, desired to behold and 
display His inﬁnite perfections and boundless beauty. So He made this pal-
ace of the world in such a fashion that every being utters His perfections 
with numerous tongues and points to His beauty with many signs. The uni-
verse shows through all its beings the many hidden immaterial treasures in 
all of His most beautiful names and the many veiled subtleties in all of His 
sacred titles. And it shows this in such a way that, although since the time 
of Adam, all sciences together with all of their laws have studied this book 
of the universe, they have not yet been able to read even a hundredth of 
the book’s meanings and signs, which state and point to the divine names 
and perfections.

Thus, the wisdom of the All-Glorious One of Beauty, the All-Beauteous 
One of Glory, the Maker possessing Perfection, Who opens the palace of the 
world as though it were an exhibition in order to see and display His own 
transcendent beauty and perfections, requires that He should inform  some-
one of the meaning of the palace’s signs so that they do not remain vain and 
without beneﬁt for conscious beings on the earth. His wisdom requires that 
He should cause one of them to travel in the higher worlds, which are the 
sources of the wonders in the palace and are the treasuries of their results; 
that He should elevate him above all others, honour him with His close pres-
ence and cause him to tour the worlds of the hereafter, and entrust him with 
numerous  duties,  such  as  teacher  to  all  His  servants,  herald  of  the  sover-
eignty of His dominicality, announcer of those things pleasing to Himself, 
and expounder of the signs of creation in the palace of the world; that He 
should mark out his pre-eminence by conferring on him the decorations of 
miracles, and should make known through a decree like the Qur’an that that 
person is the truthful private interpreter of the All-Glorious One.

Thus, by way of example, we have demonstrated through the telescope of 
this comparison one or two of the many instances of wisdom in the Ascen-
sion. Others may be thought of in the same way.

Second Comparison

Second  Comparison:  If  a  knowledgeable  and  skilful  person  were  to 
compose and write a miraculous book, and on all the book’s pages were as 
many truths as would ﬁll a hundred books, and in all its lines as many subtle 
meanings as would ﬁll a hundred pages, and in all its words as many truths 
as would ﬁll a hundred lines, and in all its letters as many meanings as would 
ﬁll a hundred words, and if all the meanings and truths of the book were to 
look to and point to the transcendent perfections of its miracle-displaying 
writer,  he  most  certainly  would  not  leave  such  an  inexhaustible  treasury 
closed and thus worthless. He would surely teach it to others so that such a 
valuable book would not remain meaningless and vain, and his own hidden 
perfections would become apparent and ﬁnd their perfection, and his tran-
scendent beauty be seen; and so that he too should be pleased, and should 
make himself loved. Moreover, he would cause someone to go through that 
wonderful book from the ﬁrst page to the last to teach him all its meanings 
and truths so that the person would then teach them to others.

In exactly the same way, in order to display His perfections, His beauty, 
and the truths of His names, the Pre-Eternal Inscriber has written the uni-
verse in such a way that all beings set forth and state His inﬁnite perfections, 
names,  and  attributes  together  with  their  innumerable  facets  and  aspects. 
Of  course,  if  a  book’s  meaning  remains  unknown,  its  value  is  reduced  to 
nothing. However, a book like the universe, every word of which contains 
thousands of meanings, cannot lose its value or be made to do so.

Since  this  is  so,  the  book’s  Writer  will  certainly  make  it  known  and 
explain a part of it to each group according to its capacity. He will instruct 
in the contents of the book the person who has the most extensive and com-
prehensive view, the most universal consciousness, and the greatest ability. 
Wisdom requires that He should take the person on a lofty journey in order 
to teach him the contents of such a book and its universal truths. That is, He 
should cause him to travel from the furthest extreme of the levels of multi-
plicity, which is the ﬁrst page, to the sphere of divine oneness, which is the 
ﬁnal page. Thus, by means of this comparison, you may behold to an extent 
the exalted instances of wisdom in the Ascension.

Now we shall consider the atheist who is listening and shall listen to his 
heart to learn what state it is in. It comes to mind that his heart would say:

THE WORDS

“ I have begun to believe in it now, but I still do not have a clear understand-
ing. I have three more important difﬁculties.

“ T h e   F i r s t :  Why was this mighty Ascension special to Muhammad the 

Arabian ( Upon whom be blessings and peace )?

“ T h e   S e c o n d :  How was He the seed of the universe? And you say that 
the universe was created from His light, and also that he was its farthest and 
most illumined fruit. 1 What does this mean?

“ T h e   T h i r d :  In your explanations above you say that he made his Ascen-
sion in order to rise to the celestial realm and to see the machinery and work-
shops of the works of art found in the realm of the earth, and the treasuries 
of their results. What does this mean? ”
The Answer

Your First Difﬁculty

Y o u r   F i r s t   D i f ﬁ c u l t y :  This has been discussed in detail in the ﬁrst thirty 
Words, so here we shall set out a concise list that indicates brieﬂy Muham-
mad’s ( UWBP ) perfections and attainments, the signs of his prophethood, 
and the fact that he was the person who most merited making that supreme 
Ascension. It is as follows.

F i r s t l y :  Despite numerous corruptions in the texts of such Holy Scrip-
tures  as  the  Torah,  Gospels,  and  Psalms,  in  recent  times  even,  the  exact-
ing scholar Husayn Jisri extracted one hundred and fourteen allusive good  
tidings  of  Muhammad’s  prophethood  ( UWBP ),  which  he  set  forth  in  his 
Risale-i Hamidiye. 2

S e c o n d l y :   It  has  been  proved  historically  that  there  were  many  pre-
dictions accurately forecasting the prophethood of Muhammad ( UWBP ), 
like  those of the two soothsayers Shiqq and Satih, which, a while previ-
ously to his prophethood, gave news of it and the fact that he was to be the 
ﬁnal prophet. 3

T h i r d l y :   There  were  hundreds  of  extraordinary  happenings  famous  in 
history, called i r h a s a t , that is, signs forewarning men of a coming prophet, 
like, for example, on the night of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) birth, 4 the idols 
in the Ka‘ba fell from their places and the vaulted portal of Khosroes the 
Persian’s famous palace was rent asunder. 5

F o u r t h l y :   History  and  the  Prophet’s  (Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace) biographies show that he satisﬁed the thirst of an army with water 
ﬂowing from his ﬁngers, 1 that in the presence of a large congregation in the 
mosque, the dry wooden support against which Muhammad ( UWBP ) was 
leaning moaned like a camel and wept on being separated from him when he 
ascended the pulpit, 2 and that he was distinguished by close on a thousand 
miracles attested to by those who investigated them, and by verses of the 
Qur’an such as,

( 54:1 ) ﮯ ~ 

referring to the splitting of the moon,3 and thus verifying it.

F i f t h l y :  Anyone who considers the facts and is fair and scrupulous can-
not hesitate to agree that, as is unanimously agreed by friend and foe alike, 
he possessed good moral qualities at the highest degree, and that, in accord-
ance with the testimony of all his dealings and actions, attributes and char-
acter of the greatest excellence were apparent in the way he performed his 
duties and proclaimed Islam, and, in accordance with the ﬁne qualities and 
conduct  enjoined  by  the  religion  of  Islam,  laudable  virtues  of  the  highest 
order were found in the law he brought.

S i x t h l y :   As  is  alluded  to  in  the  Second  Indication  of  the  Tenth  Word, 
it is a requirement of wisdom that Divinity be manifested. And this desire 
of  Divinity  to  be  manifested  was  met  at  the  highest  level  and  most  bril-
liantly  by the comprehensive worship performed by Muhammad ( UWBP ) 
and  is  met  in  the  practice  of  his  religion.  Also,  wisdom  and  truth  require 
that the world’s Creator displays His beauty in its utter perfection through 
some means. And the being who met that wish, and displayed and described 
His  beauty  most  perfectly  was  self-evidently  the  person  of  Muhammad 
( UWBP ).

It was also clearly Muhammad ( UWBP ) who, in response to the desire 
of the world’s Maker to exhibit and attract attentive gazes towards His per-
fect art within inﬁnite beauty, heralded that art with the loudest voice.

Again it was necessarily Muhammad ( UWBP ) who, in response to the 
desire of the Sustainer of All the Worlds to proclaim His unity in the levels

THE WORDS

of multiplicity, announced all the degrees of unity, each at the greatest level 
of unity.

And, as is indicated by the utter beauty in beings and as is required by 
truth and wisdom, the world’s Owner desires to see and display in mirrors 
His inﬁnite essential beauty and the subtleties and qualities of His exquisite-
ness. And again it was self-evidently Muhammad ( UWBP ) who, in response 
to that desire, acted as a mirror and displayed His beauty in the most radiant 
fashion, and loved it and made others love it.

Also, in response to the desire of the Maker of the palace of this world to 
exhibit His hidden treasuries, which are ﬁlled with the wondrous miracles 
and priceless jewels, and through them to describe and make known His per-
fections, it was again self-evidently Muhammad ( UWBP ) who exhibited, 
described, and displayed them in the most comprehensive fashion.

Also, since the universe’s Maker has made it in such a way that He adorns 
it with diverse varieties of wonders and embellishments and has placed in it 
conscious creatures so that they might make tours and excursions and pon-
der over it and take lessons, wisdom requires that He should desire to make 
known the meanings and value of the works of art to those who observe and 
ponder  over  them.  And  it  was  again  self-evidently  Muhammad  ( UWBP ) 
who, in response to this desire of the universe’s Maker, by means of the All-
Wise Qur’an, acted as guide in the most comprehensive fashion to jinn and 
man, indeed, to the spirit beings and angels.

Also,  the  universe’s  All-Wise  Ruler  wishes,  by  means  of  an  envoy, 
to  cause  conscious  beings  to  unravel  the  obscure  talisman  containing  the 
aims and purposes of the change and transformations in the universe and to 
solve the riddle of the three perplexing questions: “ Where do beings come 
form? ”, “ What is their destination? ”, and, “ What are they? ” And again it 
was self-evidently Muhammad ( UWBP ) who, in response to this wish of 
the All-Wise Ruler, unravelled the talisman by means of the Qur’an’s truths, 
and solved the riddle in the clearest and most comprehensive fashion.

Also, the universe’s All-Glorious Maker desires to make Himself known 
to conscious beings by means of all His ﬁne artefacts and to make them love 
Him through all His precious bounties, and, most certainly, to make known 
His wishes to them by means of an envoy and what will please Him in return 
for  those  bounties.  And  again  it  was  self-evidently  Muhammad  ( UWBP ) 
who, in response to this desire of the All-Glorious Maker, by means of the 
Qur’an, brought and expounded those wishes and things that please Him in 
the most exalted and perfect fashion.

THIRTY-FIRST WORD – THIRD PRINCIPLE

Also,  since  the  Sustainer  of  All  the  Worlds  has  given  a  world-encom-
passing comprehensive disposition to man, who is the fruit of the universe, 
and  has  prepared  him  for  universal  worship,  and  since,  by  reason  of  his 
faculties and senses he is addicted to multiplicity and the world, the Sus-
tainer desires to turn his face from multiplicity to unity, from transience to 
permanence. And again it was self-evidently Muhammad ( UWBP ) who, in 
response to this desire, by means of the Qur’an, acted as guide in the most 
comprehensive and eloquent fashion, and in the best way, and carried out the 
duty of prophethood in the most perfect manner.

Among beings the most superior are animate beings, and among animate 
beings the most superior are conscious beings, and among conscious beings 
the  most  superior  are  true  human  beings.  So  the  one  among  true  human 
beings who carried out the above-mentioned duties on the most comprehen-
sive level and in the most perfect manner would rise through an all-embrac-
ing Ascension to “ t h e   d i s t a n c e   o f   t w o   b o w - l e n g t h s  ”( 53:9 ), knock at the door 
of eternal happiness, open the treasury of mercy, and see the hidden truths 
of belief. Again it would be him.

S e v e n t h l y :  As is plain to see, beings are made beautiful with the utmost 
degree  of  ﬁne  embellishment  and  adornment.  Such  embellishment  and 
adornment clearly demonstrate that their Maker possesses an extremely 
strong will to make beautiful and intention to adorn. The will to make 
beautiful and adorn demonstrates that the Maker necessarily possesses a 
strong desire for His art and a holy love towards it. And among beings it 
would most certainly be the one who displayed all together in himself the 
most comprehensive and subtle wonders of art, and knew them and made 
them known and himself loved, and who appreciated the beauties to be 
found in other beings, declaring: “ What wonders Allah has willed! ”, and 
was most beloved in the sight of his Maker, for He nurtures and loves 
His art.

Thus,  again  it  is  is  again  self-evidently  Muhammad  ( UWBP )  who 
declares: “ Glory be to Allah! What wonders Allah has willed! Allah is most 
Great! ” in the face of the exquisiteness that gilds beings and the subtle per-
fections that illuminate them, thus causing the heavens to ring out, and who, 
through  the  strains  of  the  Qur’an,  causes  the  universe  to  reverberate,  and 
through his admiration and appreciation, his contemplation and display, and 
his mentioning of the divine names and afﬁrmation of divine unity, brings 
land and sea to ecstasy.

THE WORDS

Thus, according to the meaning of   ِلِ(cid:150)اَ(cid:159)ْ(cid:170)اﯬﯦ  ُبَ(cid:93) َ

ّ(cid:127)(cid:170)َا 1 it is pure truth and 
sheer wisdom that the being in whose scales shall be found the equivalent of 
all the good deeds performed by his community, and whose spiritual perfec-
tions draw strength from the benedictions of all his community, and who, as 
a result of the duties he discharged in his messengership, received immate-
rial recompense and boundless emanations of divine mercy and love, should 
advance by the stairway of the Ascension as far as Paradise, “ t h e   L o t e - t r e e  
o f   t h e   f a r t h e s t   l i m i t  ”( 53:14 ), the divine throne, and “ t h e   d i s t a n c e   o f   t w o   b o w -
l e n g t h s  ”( 53:9 ).

Your Second Difﬁculty

Y o u r  S e c o n d  D i f ﬁ c u l t y :  O you who is listening! This second truth, which 
you consider difﬁcult, is so profound and exalted that the mind can neither 
rise to it nor draw close to it. It may be seen only with the light of belief. 
However, the fact that this truth exists may be brought close to the under-
standing by means of some comparisons. In which case, we shall attempt to 
do that to some small degree.

Thus, when the universe is considered from the point of view of wisdom, 
it is seen to bear the meaning of a mighty tree. For just as a tree has branches, 
leaves, blossom and fruit, so in this lower world, which is one part of the 
tree of creation, there are elements, which are like its branches; plants and 
trees, which are like its leaves; animals, which are like its ﬂowers; and man, 
which is like the fruit.

Furthermore, the divine name of All-Wise requires that a law of that All-
Glorious Maker which is in force in trees generally will also be in force in 
the mighty tree of creation. Since this is so, wisdom requires that the tree 
of creation also be formed from a seed, and such a seed that contains the 
essentials and principles of other worlds besides the corporeal world. For the 
fundamental and original seed of the universe, which comprises thousands 
of different worlds, cannot be a scrap of desiccated matter.

Since before the tree of the universe there was no tree of the same kind, 
it  is  also  a  requirement  of  the  name  of  All-Wise  that  meaning  and  light, 
which are a sort of source and seed of it, should be clothed with the garment 
of a fruit on the tree of the universe. For a seed cannot remain permanently 
unclothed. And since at the beginning of creation it was not clothed  in the 
garment of a fruit, it would surely be clothed in it at the end. And since the 
fruit is humankind; and since, as was proved above, the most famous fruit

and sublime result from among humankind, who attracted the attention of 
all and conﬁned to himself the gaze of half the earth and a ﬁfth of human-
kind, and with his moral and spiritual qualities caused the world to look on 
him  with  feelings  of  either  love  or  wonder,  is  the  Person  of  Muhammad 
(UWBP), most  certainly, light, which was the seed from which the universe 
was formed, would become clothed in corporeality in his person and would 
appear in the form of an ultimate fruit.

O  listener!  Do  not  consider  it  improbable  that  this  strange  and  mighty 
universe  is  created  from  the  particular  essence  of  a  human  being!  Why 
should  the  All-Powerful  One  of  Glory,  Who  creates  a  huge  pine  tree  –  a 
sort of world – from a seed the size of a wheat grain, not create the universe 
from the Light of Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace )? Why 
should He not be able to do so?

Since, like the tree of tuba, the tree of the universe has its roots and trunk 
above  and  branches  below,  there  is  a  luminous  connecting  line  from  the 
level of the fruit below to that of the original seed. Thus, the Ascension is 
the sheath and form of that connecting line, the way of which Muhammad 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) opened up. He went through his saint-
hood, returned through his messengership, and left the door open. The saints 
of his community following after him, travel that luminous highway with 
the heart and spirit in the shadow of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) Ascension, and 
according to their abilities, rise to elevated ranks.

Also, as was proved above, the universe’s Maker made it and decked 
it  out  in  the  form  of  a  palace  for  the  aims  demonstrated  in  the  answer 
to  the  ﬁrst  difﬁculty.  Since  Muhammad  ( UWBP )  was  the  means  of  all 
those aims being realized, he must have been regarded with favour by the 
universe’s Maker before the universe was created, he must have been the 
ﬁrst  recipient  of  His  manifestation.  For  the  result  and  fruit  of  a  thing  is 
considered ﬁrst. That is to say, material existence comes last and meaning 
comes ﬁrst. However, since Muhammad ( UWBP ) was both the most per-
fect fruit, and the means of all other fruits acquiring value, and the means 
of all the aims becoming manifest, His light must have received the ﬁrst 
manifestation of creativity. 1

Your Third Difﬁculty

Y o u r   T h i r d   D i f ﬁ c u l t y :  This is so extensive that people like us with strait-
ened minds cannot encompass or comprehend it. We can, however, look at 
it from afar.

658

THE WORDS

Yes, the immaterial workshops and universal laws of the lower world 
are in the higher worlds. And the fruits of the actions of jinn and men and 
the  results  of  the  actions  of  all  the  innumerable  creatures  on  the  earth, 
which is an exhibition of works of art, are also represented in the higher 
worlds. Moreover, a great many signs and the testimony of many narra-
tions show that good deeds will take on the form of the fruits of Paradise 
and bad deeds the form of the bitter food of Hell. The wisdom in creation 
and the divine name of All-Wise necessitate this and the All-Wise Qur’an 
indicates it.

For sure, the multiplicity on the face of the earth is so widespread and the 
creation so ramiﬁed that its species of creatures and classes of beings are far 
more numerous than all the beings dispersed throughout the universe. For 
they are in a state of constant change and ever ﬁll the earth and are emptied 
from it. Thus, the sources and mines of this multiplicity and these particulars 
are universal laws and universal manifestations of the divine names.

Those universal laws and universal, all-encompassing manifestations of 
the names are to some extent sheer and undifferentiated and each forms a 
heaven resembling the throne and ceiling of a world and its centre of direc-
tion.  One  of  those  worlds  is  Paradise,  “ t h e   G a r d e n   o f  
t h e   A b o d e  ”( 53:15 ) 
at “ t h e   L o t e - t r e e   o f   t h e   f a r t h e s t   l i m i t  ”( 53:14 ). It is established by accounts 
given by the Bringer of Sure News ( UWBP ) that the praise and gloriﬁcation 
on the earth takes on the form of the fruits of Paradise.1 Thus, these three 
points demonstrate that the treasuries of the results and fruits produced on 
the earth are there, in the heavens, and that the crops and produce of those 
results and fruits also return there.

Do not say: “ How could my words ‘All praise be to Allah!’, which are 
formed only of air, become a corporeal fruit of Paradise? ”, because, some-
times while dreaming you eat in the form of a delicious apple a good word 
you uttered during the day while awake. And sometimes you eat at night in 
the form of something bitter, an ugly word you uttered during the day. If 
you slander and backbite, you are made to eat it in the form of putrid ﬂesh. 
In which case, the good words and ugly words you say in the sleep of this 
world, you will eat in the form of fruits in the world of the hereafter, which 
is the world of consciousness. You should not consider it unlikely that you 
will eat them.

THIRTY-FIRST WORD – FOURTH PRINCIPLE

659

Fourth Principle 
What are the fruits and benefits of the Ascension?

T h e   A n s w e r :  By way of example, we shall mention only ﬁve of the more 

than ﬁve hundred fruits of the Ascension, for it signiﬁes the tree of tuba.

First Fruit

FIRST FRUIT

The Ascension brought to the universe and humankind a treasury, a pre-
eternal light and post-eternal gift, which is to see with one’s very eyes the 
truths of the pillars of belief and to behold the angels, Paradise, the hereafter, 
and  even  the  All-Glorious  One.  It  raised  the  universe  from  an  imaginary 
state  of  wretchedness,  transitoriness,  and  disorder,  and,  through  this  fruit 
and  light  showed  the  universe’s  reality,  which  is  its  consisting  of  sacred 
missives of the Eternally Besought One and being a beautiful mirror to the 
beauty of the Single and Unique One. It made happy and pleased the uni-
verse and all conscious beings.

Furthermore, through this light and sacred fruit, the Ascension showed 
that man is not merely bewildered, wretched, impotent, impoverished, with 
endless needs and innumerable enemies, ephemeral and impermanent, for 
that is the state of misguidance; it showed man in his true form: his being 
a miracle of the Eternally Besought One’s power on ‘the most excellent 
of patterns,’ a comprehensive copy of the Eternally Besought One’s mis-
sives, an addressee of the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, His 
special  bondsman,  the  admirer  and  friend  of  His  perfections,  the  lover 
bewildered at His beauty, and a beloved guest appointed to eternal Para-
dise. It ﬁlled all human beings who are true human beings with inﬁnite joy 
and inﬁnite longing.

Second Fruit

SECOND FRUIT

The Ascension brought to jinn and humankind as a gift the fundamen-
tals of Islam, and ﬁrst and foremost the prescribed prayers, which consti-
tute those things pleasing to the Sustainer, the Ruler of Pre-Eternity and 
Post-Eternity, the Maker of beings, Owner of the universe, and Sustainer 
of all the worlds. To discover the things that please Him brings such happi-
ness it cannot be described. For how eager is everyone to discover, from a 
distance, the desires of a powerful benefactor or generous king, and if they 
ﬁnd out, how delighted they are. They say longingly: “ If only there were 
some means by which I could communicate with that personage directly. 

660

THE WORDS

If    only  I  could  learn  what  he  wants  of  me.  If  only  I  knew  what  would 
please him that I could do. ”

You should understand then just how necessary it is to be desirous and 
eager to discover the Ruler of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity’s wishes and 
pleasure. For all beings are in the grasp of His power, and the beauty and 
perfections found in beings are but pale shadows in relation to His beauty 
and perfection, while man, being needy for Him every instant in innumer-
able ways, constantly receives countless numbers of His bounties.

Thus, as a direct fruit of the Ascension, Muhammad ( UWBP ) heard with 
absolute certainty from behind seventy thousand veils what it is that pleases 
the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, and returning, brought it as 
a gift to humankind. 1

Indeed,  how  curious  are  human  beings  to  learn  the  conditions  on  the 
moon.  If  someone  were  to  go  there  and  return  bringing  news  of  it,  what 
self-sacriﬁce he would display, and, if he were to understand the conditions 
there, how he would be overcome by wonder and curiosity. But the moon 
is merely touring in the domain of a Lord of such dominion that it encircles 
the globe of the earth like a ﬂy, and the globe ﬂies round the sun like a moth, 
while the sun is one lamp among thousands and is just a candle in a guest-
house of that Glorious Lord of All Dominion.

Thus, Muhammad ( UWBP ) saw the works and wonders of art and treas-
uries  of  mercy  in  the  everlasting  realm  of  the  All-Glorious  One,  and  he 
returned  and  informed  humankind.  And  so,  if  humankind  does  not  listen 
to him with complete wonder, curiosity, and love, you can understand how 
contrary to reason and wisdom is their attitude.

Muhammad ( UWBP ) saw the treasury of eternal happiness, obtained the 
key, and brought it as a gift to jinn and men. Yes, through the Ascension, 
he saw Paradise with his own eyes and witnessed the eternal manifestations 
of the All-Glorious and Merciful One’s mercy; he understood eternal happi-
ness with absolute and utter certainty and brought as a gift to jinn and men 
the good news of its existence.

If wretched jinn and men imagine themselves and all beings to be in a 
soul-searing situation in an unstable world amid the upheavals of decease 
and separation being poured with the ﬂood of time and motion of particles 

1.  See, B u k h ā r ī , Manāqib al-Anṣār, 42; M u s l i m , Imān, 279; Musāﬁrīn, 253; Ti r m i d h ī ,

into the oceans of non-existence and eternal separation, just how precious  
and enheartening is such good news in the ears of ephemeral jinn and men, 
who thus supposed themselves to be condemned to eternal annihilation. If, 
at the moment he is to be executed and sent to non-existence, a man is par-
doned and given a palace in proximity to the king, what great joy this would 
cause him. So, gather up all such joy and happiness to the number of jinn and 
men and then evaluate this good news.

Fourth Fruit

FOURTH FRUIT

Just as Muhammad ( UWBP ) himself sampled the fruit of the vision of 
divine beauty, so did he bring to jinn and men the gift of this fruit’s being 
attainable  by  all  believers.  You  may  understand  from  the  following  how 
delightful, pleasing, and exquisite a fruit this is.

Everyone  of  ﬁne  perception  loves  a  person  who  possesses  beauty  and 
perfection  and  is  benevolent,  and  their  love  increases  proportionately  to 
their  degrees;  it  reaches  the  degree  of  worship  and  a  pitch  whereat  they 
would sacriﬁce their very lives. On seeing such a person only once, their 
love becomes such they would sacriﬁce his own world. However, in relation 
to the beauty, perfection, and benevolence of Allah Almighty, the beauty, 
perfection  and  benevolence  of  all  beings  are  not  the  equivalent  of  even  a 
few tiny sparks in relation to the sun. That is to say, if you are a true human 
being,  you  may  understand  how  delightful  and  ﬁne  a  fruit  it  is  and  what 
happiness and joy it brings to receive in eternal happiness the vision of the 
All-Glorious One of Perfection, Who is worthy of boundless love, inﬁnite 
longing, and being gazed upon eternally.

Fifth Fruit

FIFTH FRUIT

The  fact  that  man  is  the  precious  fruit  of  the  universe  and  the  petted 
beloved of the universe’s Maker was understood through the Ascension, and 
Muhammad ( UWBP ) brought this fruit to jinn and men. This fruit raises 
man, an insigniﬁcant creature, a weak animal, an impotent conscious being, 
to  an  elevated  rank  of  pride  above  all  the  beings  in  the  universe.  It  gives 
man indescribable pleasure and joyful happiness. For if it is said to an ordi-
nary private: “ You have been promoted to the rank of ﬁeld marshal, ” how 
delighted he will be. But wretched man is an ephemeral, impotent rational 
animal who constantly suffers the blows of decease and separation. If then 
he is told that he will make excursions and tours with the speed of imagina-
tion and breadth of the spirit in an eternal never-ending Paradise within the 
mercy of One Compassionate, Generous, and Merciful, and journey in the

mind in accordance with all the desires of his heart in both the outer dimen-
sions  of  things  and  those  dimensions  that  look  directly    to  their  Creator, 
and moreover that he will behold the vision of divine beauty in eternal hap-
piness, you can imagine what a profound joy and true happiness a human 
being who has not fallen from the level of humanity will feel in his heart.

The First Comparison

N o w   w e   s a y   t o   o u r   l i s t e n e r :  Tear off the shirt of atheism and throw it 
away! Listen with believing ears! Look with Muslim eyes! We shall show 
you through two short comparisons the great value of one or two more fruits.
For example, you and I are together in a country. We see that everything 
is hostile to us and to each other, and is strange to us. Everywhere is full of 
ghastly corpses. The sounds that are heard are the weeping of orphans and 
the  lamentations  of  the  oppressed.  So  if,  when  in  that  situation  someone 
were to go and then reappear bringing good news from the country’s king 
due to which those strange subjects of his assume the form of friends and the 
enemies turn into brothers, and the ghastly corpses are seen to be worship-
ping, praising, and glorifying in deep humility and submission; and if the 
piteous weeping becomes praise and exaltation and cries of “ Long live the 
king! ”, and the deaths, plunder and pillage are transformed into demobiliza-
tions and a release from duty; and if we join the general joy to our own joy, 
you will certainly understand how joyful and happy that news is.

Thus,  when  the  beings  in  the  universe  are  considered  with  the  eye  of 
misguidance, as they were before the light of belief, which is one fruit of 
Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) Ascension, they are seen to be strange, menacing, 
troublesome,  dreadful,  terrifying  corpses  the  size  of  mountains,  while  the 
appointed hour is severing heads and casting people into the pit of eternal, 
never-ending  nothingness.  Where  misguidance  portrays  all  the  voices  as 
lamentations occasioned by separation and decease, the truths of the pillars 
of belief, which are fruits of the Ascension, show you that just as beings are 
brothers and friends to you and praisers and gloriﬁers of the All-Glorious 
Maker, so are death and decease a demobilization and discharge from duties; 
in reality the voices are all gloriﬁcations of Allah. If you wish to study this 
truth in its entirety, you may refer to the Second and Eighth Words.

The Second Comparison

T h e   S e c o n d   C o m p a r i s o n :   You  and  I  are  in  a  place  resembling  a  vast 
desert. A sandstorm rages in the sea of sand and the night is so black we 
cannot see even our hands. If suddenly, when we are without friend or pro-
tector, are hungry and thirsty, despairing and giving up hope, a person were 
to pass through the curtain of blackness and approach us bringing a car as 
a gift; and if he were to seat us in it, and then instantly instal us in a place 
like Paradise where our future was secure, food and drink ready  prepared, 

THIRTY-FIRST WORD – FOURTH PRINCIPLE

663

and where we had a most kindly and sympathetic protector, you can under-
stand how pleased we would be.

Thus, the great desert is the face of this world. The sea of sand consists 
of beings and wretched man, who are tossed around within events by the 
force of the ﬂood of time and the motion of particles. All human beings look 
to the future with the eye of misguidance, enveloped in terrifying darkness, 
and their hearts are harrowed with anxiety. They know no one they can make 
hear their cries for help. They are inﬁnitely hungry, inﬁnitely thirsty.

However, when this world is seen in terms of things pleasing to Allah, 
which is a fruit of the Ascension; that is, it is seen to be the guesthouse of 
an exceedingly generous Being, and human beings are seen to be His guests 
and ofﬁcials, and the future to be as delightful as Paradise, as sweet as mercy 
and as shining as eternal happiness – when it is seen thus, you will under-
stand what a delightful, exquisitely sweet fruit this is.

At this point, the one who is listening says: “ Never-ending praise and 
thanks be to Almighty Allah, for I have been saved from atheism and now 
afﬁrm divine unity. I have attained a complete belief, I have gained perfect 
belief. ”

And we say: “ Brother! We congratulate you. May Almighty Allah allow 
us the intercession of His Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ). AMEN. ”

Addendum to the Nineteenth Letter 
and Thirty-First Word

About the Miracle of
the Splitting of the Moon 

(cid:2)(cid:3)

( 54:1-2 ) ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ £ ¢ *  ﮯ ~ } |
Philosophers and their unreasoning imitators who want to eclipse with 
their  vicious  delusions  the  Splitting  of  the  Moon,  which  is  a  miracle  of 
Muhammad  ( UWBP )  that  shines  like  the  moon,  say:  “ If  the  Splitting  of 
the Moon had occurred, it would have been known to the whole world and 
would have been related throughout the subsequent history of man. ”

T h e  A n s w e r :  Since the Splitting of the Moon was demonstrated as an evi-
dence of his (UWBP) claim to prophethood, and happened in-stantaneously, 
at  night  when  people  were  asleep,  and  before  a  gathering  who,  although 
they heard that claim, denied it; and since there were obstacles hindering the 
sighting of it such as mist, clouds, and time-differences between different 
parts of the world; and since at that time science and civilization were not 
widespread, and observation of the skies was very limited, and the event was 
particular to them, there was, therefore, nothing to necessitate that it should 
have been seen all over the world and passed into the general histories. 1 For 
now, listen to ﬁve points out of many that will scatter those clouds of delu-
sion concerning the Splitting of the Moon. 

First Point

FIRST POINT

The extreme stubbornness of the unbelievers there at that time is well-
known  and  is  recorded  in  history.  And  yet,  when  the  All-Wise  Qur’an 
announced this event to the whole world by saying:

1.    See,  al-Nawawī,  S h a r ḥ   Ṣ a ḥ ī ḥ   M u s l i m ,  xvii,  143;  Ibn  Qutayba,  Ta ’ w ī l   M u k h t a l i f  

 ﮯ ~ 

a l - Ḥ a d ī t h , i, 21-5.

664

THIRTY-FIRST WORD – ADDENDUM

665

not one of those unbelievers related to the event, who denied the Qur’an, 
spoke  up  to  give  the  lie  to  this  verse;  that  is,  not  one  of  them  denied  the 
event it was announcing. If the event had not been considered as a deﬁnite 
fact by the unbelievers at that time, they would have made the verse a pre-
text, denied it in a most fearsome manner, and tried to attack and overthrow 
Muhammad’s  ( UWBP )  claim  to  prophethood.  However,  the  biographies 
of the Prophet and histories mentioning the event relate nothing to suggest 
that the unbelievers concerned with it denied it. The only thing that history 
relates is, as the verse:

¨ § ¦
points out, the unbelievers who saw the event declared it to be magic, and 
said that if the caravans in other places had seen it, it was true, otherwise he 
had bewitched them. The caravans arriving the following morning from the 
Yemen and other places announced that they had seen such a happening. So 
the unbelievers then said of the Pride of All the Worlds ( UWBP ) that, Allah 
forbid, the magic of Abu Talib’s orphan had affected the heavens. 1

Second Point

SECOND POINT

The majority of such illustrious scholars as Sa‘d al-Din Taftazani declared 
that similarly to the Prophet ( UWBP ) satisfying the thirst of an army with 
water ﬂowing from his ﬁngers, and the whole congregation hearing a dry 
wooden post against which Muhammad ( UWBP ) had leant while deliver-
ing the sermon weep on being separated from him, the Splitting of the Moon 
was m u t a w a t i r , 2 that is, had been transmitted by numerous authorities. That 
is to say, these events had been passed down from group to group forming 
such a vast congregation that a conspiracy to lie would have been impossi-
ble. Just like the appearance of the famous Haley’s Comet a thousand years 
ago had been unanimously reported, and the existence of the island of Cey-
lon was certain due to unanimous reports, although we have not seen it.

It is, therefore, unreasonable to foster baseless doubts concerning such 
certain, witnessed matters. It is enough that they are not impossible. And as 
for the Splitting of the Moon, it is quite as possible as a mountain’s splitting 
with a volcanic eruption.

666

THIRD POINT

THE WORDS

Miracles are for proving claims to prophethood and for convincing those 
who deny those claims, they are not for compelling people to believe. There-
fore, miracles have to be manifested to those who hear claims to prophet-
hood to the extent that they will persuade them. Just as it would be contrary 
to  the  All-Wise  and  Glorious  One’s  wisdom  to  display  them  all  over  the 
world or in so self-evident a manner that all would be compelled to believe, 
so  would  it  also  be  contrary  to  the  mystery  of  human  accountability.  For 
accountability requires “ opening the door to the reason and not removing 
the power of choice. ” If the All-Wise Creator had left the moon split for 
one or two hours in order to show it to the whole world as the philosophers 
wished, and it had been recorded in all the general histories, then it would 
have been like all other occurrences in the heavens and would not have been 
an evidence of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) claim to prophethood nor been spe-
cial  to  his  messengership.  Or  else  it  would  have  been  such  a  self-evident 
miracle  that  it  would  have  negated  the  power  of  choice,  a  part  of  human 
reason, compelling it to accept it; willy-nilly, it would have had to assent to 
his prophethood. Someone with the coal-like spirit of Abu Jahl would have 
remained at the same level as someone with the diamond-like spirit of Abu 
Bakr the Veracious; the mystery of human accountability would have been 
lost. It was due to this mystery that, being both instantaneous, and at night-
time, and at a time of rest, and its being concealed by time-differences, mist, 
and cloud and other obstacles, it was not shown to the whole world and did 
not pass into the histories.

Fourth Point

FOURTH POINT

Since  this  event  occurred  instantaneously  at  night  while  everyone  was 
sleeping, of course it was not seen all over the world. Even if some people 
had seen it, they would not have believed their eyes. And even if it had made 
them believe, because there were only single reports such a signiﬁcant event 
would not have become a permanent source for future histories.

In some books it is written that after the moon split into two halves, it 
fell to earth, but veracious scholars have rejected such additions, saying that 
they were perhaps added by dissemblers with the intention of discrediting 
this evident miracle. 1

And, for example, just as that time in England and Spain, which were 
then enveloped in mists of ignorance, would have been just after sunset, in  
America daytime, and in China and Japan morning, so too in other places 

1.  See, ‘Ali al-Qārī, a l - A s r ā r   a l - M a r f ū ’ a , 398; al-Madanī, Ta ḥ z ī r   a l - M u s l i m ī n , i, 163.

THIRTY-FIRST WORD – ADDENDUM

667

there would have been other obstacles preventing its visibility. Look at these 
unreasoning  objectors  who  say  that  the  histories  of  the  English,  Chinese, 
Japanese, Americans and so on do not mention it, and that therefore it did 
not occur! A thousand curses be on the heads of those like them who toady 
to Europe and repeat such things!

Fifth Point

FIFTH POINT

The Splitting of the Moon happened neither of its own accord due to 
certain  causes,  nor  as  a  result  of  chance,  nor  was  it  a  natural  event  that 
occurred through the ordinary laws of nature. Rather, the All-Wise Crea-
tor of the sun and the moon caused it to happen as something out of the 
ordinary in order to conﬁrm His Messenger’s ( UWBP ) messengership and 
to illuminate his claim.

As required by the mystery of guidance, the mystery of human account-
ability,  and  the  wisdom  of  messengership,  it  was  demonstrated  as  a  con-
vincing proof to a number of people who had been speciﬁed by dominical 
wisdom. The mystery of wisdom required that it was not shown to people 
in  every  region  of  the  world,  for  they  had  not  yet  heard  of  Muhammad’s 
( UWBP ) claim to prophethood. Numerous obstacles prevented them, there-
fore,  such  as  mist,  cloud,  and  time-differences,  and  the  fact  that  in  some 
countries the moon had not risen, and in others the sun had risen, while in 
others it was morning, and in yet others the sun had just set.

If  it  had  been  shown  to  all  and  sundry,  it  would  have  been  shown  at 
Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) sign and as a miracle of prophethood, in which case 
his messengership would have been so manifest that everyone would have 
been  compelled  to  afﬁrm  it.  No  choice  would  have  remained  for  the  rea-
son. And belief is attained through man’s power of choice and his reason. 
The mystery of human accountability would have gone for nothing. And if 
it had been shown merely as an occurrence in the heavens, its connection 
with Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) messengership would have been severed, and 
it would no longer have been particular to him.

To Conclude: No doubt remains concerning the possibility that the Split-
ting of the Moon occurred; it has been proved decisively. And now we shall 
mention six 1 of the many evidences pointing to its occurrence.

The  concurrence  on  its  occurrence  of  the  Companions  of  the  Prophet 

( UWBP ), who were all men of justice.

1.  That is to say, there are six proofs concerning the event in the form of a sixfold 

consensus. Unfortunately, the explanation of them is brief, although they deserve more.

668

THE WORDS

The agreement of all exacting Qur’anic commentators in expounding the 

verse, ﮯ ~ 1
The  fact  that,  relying  on  numerous  different  chains  of  authorities  and 
lines of transmission, all the scholars of the Prophetic Hadiths and transmit-
ters of the sound narrations narrated the event. 2

The testimony of all the saints and the veracious, and those who receive 

inspiration and uncover the mysteries of the creation.

The conﬁrmation of learned scholars and theologians, whose ways differ 

greatly from one another.

The fact that the community of Muhammad ( UWBP ) accepted its occur-

rence, which, on an established principle, never agrees upon error. 3

These six evidences prove the Splitting of the Moon as clearly as the sun.

Conclusion

CONCLUSION

Up to here the purpose of this Addendum has been to establish the truth, 
and to silence those enemies who deny it. Its concluding sentences will now 
be in the name of the truth and for the sake of belief. Indeed, establishing the 
truth spoke as above, now the truth speaks.

The Seal of the Ofﬁce of Prophethood ( UWBP ), who was the luminous 
moon of its heaven, proved his sainthood through his Ascension. This was 
the greatest wonder and supreme miracle of sainthood, achieved through his 
worship, which was so elevated as to make him Allah’s beloved. That is to 
say, by travelling with his earthly body through the heavens, his superior-
ity and his being Allah’s beloved were demonstrated to the dwellers of the 
heavens  and  inhabitants  of  the  lofty  worlds.  So  too,  by  the  moon,  which 
is  bound  to  the  earth  and  suspended  in  the  heavens,  being  split  into  two 
halves  at  the  sign  of  an  inhabitant  of  the  earth,  a  miracle  was  displayed 
to the other inhabitants of the earth that demonstrated that earth-dweller’s

to “ t h e   d i s t a n c e   o f   t w o   b o w - l e n g t h s ;  ”( 53:9 ) he became the cause of pride of

an allegorical conversation and imaginary debate and the unspoken word in 
the form of the spoken word, that would be accessible to ordinary people. 
I am now writing down that conversation at the request and desire of my 
much-valued brothers who assist me and my friends from the mosque. It is 
as follows.

Let us suppose one person represents all those things set up as partners 
to  Allah  that  all  the  different  varieties  of  idolators  imagine  to  exist.  The 
idolators are the people of unbelief and misguidance, who worship nature 
and causes, for example, and assign partners to Allah. The ﬁctitious person 
wants to have mastery over one of the beings in the universe and so claims 
to be its true owner.

Firstly,  that  maker  of  false  claims  encountered  a  particle,  which  is  the 
smallest of those beings, and he spoke to it in the language of naturalism and 
philosophy saying that he was to be its master and true owner. But the par-
ticle replied to him with the tongue of truth and dominical wisdom, saying:
“ I  perform  innumerable  duties.  Entering  many  creatures  which  are  all 
different I do my work in them. And there are, from among countless par-
ticles like me, those that move from place to place 1 and work with me. If 
you have the knowledge and power to employ me in all those duties, and the 
authority and ability to employ and have at your command all those others as 
well, and if you are able to be the true owner of and to have total control over 
the beings of which I become a part in complete order, for example, over 
red blood-corpuscles, then you can claim to be master over me and ascribe 
me to something other than Allah Almighty. But if you cannot do all these 
things, be silent!

“ And in the same way that you cannot have mastery over me, you can-
not interfere in any way. For there is such complete orderliness in our duties 
and motion that anyone who does not have inﬁnite wisdom and all-encom-
passing knowledge cannot meddle with us. If he did, it would cause  chaos. 
However,  a  person  like  you  who  is  insentient,  impotent,  and  unseeing, 

1.  Indeed, every object which is in motion, from minute particles to the planets, dis-
plays on itself the stamp of eternal besoughtedness and unity. Also, by reason of its move-
ment, each of them takes possession of all the places in which it travels in the name of 
unity, thus including them in the property of its owner. As for those creatures that are not 
in motion, they are each of them, from plants to the ﬁxed stars, like a seal of unity showing 
the place in which it is situated to be the missive of its Maker. That is to say, all ﬂowers 
and fruits are stamps and seals of unity which demonstrate, in the name of unity, that their 
habitats and native places are the missives of their Maker. In short, through their motion 
all things take possession of all things in the name of unity. That is, one who does not have 
all the stars within his grasp cannot have mastery over a single particle.

and is in the clutches of blind chance and nature, could not even begin to 
stretch out a ﬁnger to interfere. ”

So, just like the materialists, the one making these claims said: “ In that 
case,  own  yourself.  Why  do  you  say  you  are  working  on  someone  else’s 
account? ” To which the particle replied: 

“ If I had a brain like the sun, and all-embracing knowledge like its light, 
and  all-encompassing  power  like  its  heat,  and  comprehensive  senses  like 
the seven colours in its light, and if I had a face that looked to all the places 
in which I travel and all the beings in which I work, and an eye that looked 
to them and words that carried authority with them, then perhaps I would 
indulge in foolishness like you and claim to own myself. Get out! Go away! 
You won’t get anything out of me! ”

So, when the representative of those things held to be Allah’s partners 
despaired  of  the  particle,  he  hoped  to  pursue  the  matter  with  a  red  blood 
corpuscle. And coming across one he said to it on behalf of causes and in 
the language of nature and philosophy: “ I am your master and owner. ” The 
red corpuscle replied to him through the tongue of truth and divine wisdom:
“ I am not alone. If you are able to own all my fellows in the army of 
blood  whose  stamp,  nature  as  ofﬁcials,  and  order  is  the  same,  and  if  you 
have subtle wisdom and mighty power enough to own all the cells of the 
body in which we travel and are employed with perfect wisdom, and if you 
can demonstrate this to be the case, then perhaps some meaning might be 
found in your claim.

“ But  someone  stupiﬁed  like  yourself  cannot  be  owner  with  your  only 
support being deaf nature and blind force; indeed, you are unable to inter-
fere  in  so  much  as  an  atom.  For  the  order  with  which  we  function  is  so 
perfect that only one who sees, hears, knows, and does everything can have 
authority over us. ” And saying: “ So, be silent! My duty is so important and 
the order so perfect that I have no time to answer garbled rubbish such as 
yours, ” it repelled him. 

Then, since he was unable to mislead it, the representative left and next 
came across the little house known as a cell of the body. He said to it in the 
language of philosophy and nature: “ I could not persuade the particle and 
red corpuscle but perhaps you will be reasonable. Since you have been made 
of several substances just like a minute house, I am able to make you. You 
will be my artefact and true property. ” The cell responded to him through 
the tongue of wisdom and truth, saying:

THIRTY-SECOND WORD – FIRST STOPPING-PLACE

673

“ I am only a minute little thing but I have very important duties and  very 
sensitive relations; I am connected to the body as a whole as well as to all its 
cells. For example, I perform complex and faultless duties in the veins, and 
in regard to the arteries, the sensory and motor nerves, the powers of attrac-
tion and repulsion and procreation, and the imaginative faculty. If you have 
the knowledge and power to form, arrange, and employ the whole body and 
all its blood vessels, nerves and faculties, and if you have comprehensive 
wisdom and penetrating power with which to control all the body’s cells, 
which are like me, as regards qualities and artistry we are brothers, demon-
strate it. Only then can you claim to be able to make me. If you cannot, then 
off with you!

“ The  red  corpuscles  bring  my  food,  while  the  white  ones  combat  any 
illnesses which attack me. I have work to do, do not distract me! Anyway, 
an impotent, lifeless, deaf and blind thing like you cannot in any way inter-
fere with us. For we have such an exact, subtle and faultless order 1 that if 

1.  The All-Wise Maker has created the human body as though it were a well-arranged 
city. A number of the blood vessels perform the duties of telephones and telegraphs, while 
others of them are like pipes from a fountain through which blood, which is the water of 
life, ﬂows. As for blood, created within it are two sorts of corpuscles. One of them, known 
as red corpuscles, distributes nutrients to the cells of the body; it conveys sustenance to 
the cells according to a divine law. ( Like merchants and food ofﬁcials. ) The other sort are 
white corpuscles, which are fewer in number than the former. Their duty, like soldiers, is 
defence against enemies, such as illness. Whenever they undertake that defence, with their 
two revolutions like Mevlevi dervishes, they take on a swift and wonderful state. As for 
blood as a whole, it has two general duties; the ﬁrst is to repair damage done to the body’s 
cells and the second is to collect any waste matter from the cells and to clean the body. 
There are two sorts of blood vessels, veins and arteries. One of these carry puriﬁed blood, 
they are the channels through which clean blood is conveyed. The others are the channels 
for  the  turbid  blood  which  collects  the  waste  matter;  these  convey  the  blood  to  where 
breathing occurs; that is, the lungs. 

The All-Wise Maker created in the air two elements, nitrogen and oxygen. As for oxy-
gen, when it comes into contact with the blood in breathing, it draws to itself, like amber, 
the impure element, carbon, which is polluting the blood. The two combine and are trans-
formed into matter called carbonic acid gas. Oxygen also maintains the body temperature, 
and puriﬁes the blood. This is because, in the science of chemistry, the All-Wise Maker 
bestowed  on  oxygen  and  carbon  an  intense  relationship,  which  might  be  described  as 
chemical passion, whereby, according to this divine law, when those two elements come 
close to each other, they combine. It has been established by science that heat is produced 
by combining, because it is a sort of combustion.

The wisdom in this is as follows: the motion of the particles of those two elements is 
different. On combining, the particles of one element unite with those of the other, each 
two  particles  thereafter  moving  with  a  single  motion.  One  motion  remains  suspended, 
because before combining there were two motions; now two particles have become one. 
Each pair of particles has acquired a motion like a single particle. The other motion ==

the  one  who  has  authority  over  us  was  not  Absolutely  Wise,  Absolutely 
Powerful and Absolutely Knowing, our order would be broken and our regu-
larity spoilt. ”

Then the one making the claims despaired of it, too. He encountered the 
body of a human being and said to it, once again as the naturalists say, in the 
language of blind nature and aimless philosophy: “ You are mine, it is I who 
made you; or anyway I have a share in you. ” The human body answered 
with the tongue of reality and wisdom and through the eloquence of its order:
“ If you possess the power and knowledge to have actual control over the 
bodies of all human beings, who are the same as me and on whose faces are 
the stamp of power and seal of creation which are the same, and if you have 
the wealth and jurisdiction to own, from water and air to plants and animals, 
the treasuries of my sustenance, and if you have inﬁnite power and bound-
less wisdom with which to employ me with perfect wisdom and cause me 
to perform my worship, and the power and wisdom to lodge in a narrow, 
lowly vessel like me immaterial and subtle faculties like the spirit, heart, and 
intellect, which are extremely vast and exalted and for which I am merely 
the sheath, then demonstrate all these and afterwards say that you made me. 
Otherwise, be silent!

“ Moreover, according to the testimony of the perfect order in my body 
and the indication of the stamp of unity on my face, my Maker is One Who 
is powerful over all things, knows all things, and sees and hears all things. 
Someone aimless and impotent like you cannot meddle in His art. You can-
not interfere in so much as an atom. ”

The representative of the things imagined to be Allah’s partners could 
ﬁnd  no  way  in  which  to  interfere  in  the  body  so  he  went  off.  Next,  he 
encountered the human race and said to himself “ This is a disorganized and 
unruly  group.  Perhaps,  like  Satan  interferes  in  their  individual  and  social 
actions which they perform through the exercise of their wills, I’ll be able 
to ﬁnd some way to interfere in the functioning of their bodies and natures. 

==  is transformed into heat according to a law of the All-Wise Maker. As a matter of a 
fact, motion produces heat is an established principle.

Thus,  as  a  consequence  of  this  fact,  by  this  chemical  combination,  as  carbon  is  re-
moved  from  the  blood  the  body  temperature  of  human  beings  is  maintained  and  at  the 
same time the blood is puriﬁed. On inhaling, oxygen both cleanses the body’s water of life 
and kindles the ﬁre of life. On exhaling, it yields, in the mouth, the fruit of words, which 
are miracles of divine power.

And then, ﬁnding some way, I’ll be able to exercise control over the body 
and the body’s cell which sent me packing. ”

So, he said to the human race, once again in the language of deaf nature  
and aimless philosophy: “ You seem to be to be in great confusion. I am your 
master and owner, or at least I partly own you. ” To which the human race 
answered through the tongue of truth and reality, wisdom and order: 

“ If  you  possess  the  power  and  wisdom  to  make  the  shirt  that  clothes 
the whole globe of the earth and is woven and sewn with perfect wisdom 
from the multicoloured threads of all the hundreds of thousands of animal 
and  plant  species,  of  which  we  are  one,  and  to  make  the  carpet  which  is 
spread over the face of the earth and is woven from the hundreds of thou-
sands of species of animate beings and is created in an extremely ﬁne and 
ornamented fashion, and to continuously renew and refurbish it with perfect 
wisdom, and if you possess comprehensive power and all-embracing wis-
dom with which to have free disposal over the globe of the earth of which 
we are the fruit, and over the universe of which we are the seed, and to send 
us our vital necessities from all the regions of the cosmos with the balance 
of wisdom, and if you have the ability to create all those like us who have 
gone before us and those who will come after us, on whose faces the stamp 
of power is the same, then, perhaps, you can claim to have mastery over me.
“ But if you cannot, be silent! Do not say that, seeing confusion in my 
species,  you  will  be  able  to  interfere  in  some  way,  because  the  order  is 
faultless.  The  conditions  you  imagine  to  be  confused  and  disorderly  are 
transcribed with perfect order according to the book of power and divine 
determining.  For  the  perfect  order  in  animals  and  plants,  which  are  far 
inferior to us and are under our supervision, demonstrates that this seem-
ing disorder in us is but a sort of writing.

“ Is it at all possible that the one who artistically positions one thread run-
ning through a carpet in its entirety should be other than the master designer 
of the carpet; or that the one who creates a fruit should be other than the 
creator of the tree that bore it; or that the one who creates the seed should be 
other than the fashioner of the being that produced the seed?

“ Also your eyes are blind: you do not see the miracles of power on my 
face, the wonders of creation in my being. If you did see them, you would 
understand that my Maker is such that nothing at all can withstand Him or 
be difﬁcult for Him. The stars are as easy for Him as particles. He creates the 
spring with as much ease as a ﬂower. He is One Who includes the index of 
the vast universe in my being with perfect order. Could a lifeless, impotent,

THE WORDS

blind and deaf thing like you interfere in any way in the art of such a Being? 
So, be silent! ” And saying: “ Off with you! Go away! ”, he drove him away.
Next the one making these claims went and addressed the broad carpet 
covering the face of the earth and the lavishly decorated and embroidered  
shirt clothing it, on behalf of causes and in the language of nature and phi-
losophy, claiming: “ I can have control over you and be your owner, or at 
least have a share in you. ” So the shirt, the carpet, 1 said to him on behalf of 
truth and reality and through the tongue of wisdom:

“ If you have the power and art to weave and create all the well-ordered 
and  purposeful  shirts  and  carpets,  whose  embroideries  are  all  different, 
which  have  clothed  the  earth  to  the  number  of  years  and  centuries,  then 
have been removed in an orderly fashion and strung on the line of past time, 
and will clothe the earth again, carpets and shirts whose programmes and 
forms have been drawn and speciﬁed in the sphere of divine determining, 
and which will be attached to the ribbon of future time, and if you have two 
wise and powerful hands with which to reach from the creation of the world 
to its destruction, indeed, from pre-eternity to post-eternity, and if you have 
the wisdom and ability to create every one of all my threads and to repair 
and renew them with perfect order and wisdom, and if you are able to hold 
in your hand and create the globe, which is our model and is wearing us, 
making us its veil and outer garment, then you can claim to have mastery 
over me. If you cannot, then away with you! There is no place for you here!
“ Moreover,  there  is  on  us  such  a  stamp  of  unity  and  seal  of  oneness 
that someone who does not have the whole universe within the grasp of his 
power, and who cannot see at one time all things with all their functions, 
and cannot do innumerable things at the same time, is not all-present and 
all-seeing everywhere, nor unconﬁned by space, and who does not possess 
inﬁnite wisdom, knowledge, and power, such a one cannot own us, neither 
could he interfere. ”

So the representative went off, saying: “ Perhaps I will be able to per-
suade the globe of the earth and ﬁnd something going for me there. ” He 
went  and  said  to  the  globe,  2  once  again  on  behalf  of  causes  and  in  the

are being continuously replaced with perfect wisdom and order so as to display the ever-
differing manifestations of the Weaver’s names.

2.  In short, the particle referred the claimer to the red corpuscle. The red corpuscle 
referred him to the cell and the cell referred him to the human body; the human body to the 
human race and the human race to the earth’s shirt, which is woven from all the species 
of animate creatures. The earth’s shirt referred him to the globe of the earth, which in ==

language  of  nature:  “ Since  you  travel  in  such  an  aimless  manner,  you 
demonstrate that you have no owner. In which case, you can be mine. ” To 
which the earth replied in a thunderous voice, in the name of truth and with 
the tongue of reality: 

“ Don’t talk such utter nonsense! How could I be aimless and without an 
owner? Have you found my garments or even the tiniest point or thread in 
them to be in disarray, without order, and have you seen them to be without 
wisdom, purpose and art that you tell me I am ownerless and aimless?

“ If you can really own the vast orbit round which I travel in one year, 
a  distance  that  should  take  approximately  twenty-ﬁve  thousand  years,  1 
where I perform my duty of service with perfect balance and wisdom, and 
own  the  ten  planets,  which  are  my  brothers  and  are  charged  with  duties 
like myself, together with the space through which they travel, and if you 
have inﬁnite wisdom and power with which to create and position the sun, 
which is our leader and to which we are bound and attached by a compas-
sionate attraction, and to fasten me and the other planets to it like stones 
in a sling, and to employ us and cause us to revolve with perfect order and 
wisdom, then you can claim to have mastery over me. But if you cannot, 
get out! Go to Hell! I’ve got work to do, my duty to perform.

“ Moreover, our magniﬁcent order, awesome movement, and purposeful 
subjugation demonstrate that our Master is such that all beings from minute 
particles to the stars and galaxies are obedient and subjugated to him like 
soldiers under orders. He is an All-Wise Possessor of Glory, a Possessor of 
Absolute Sovereignty Who arrays the sun with planets as easily as He arrays 
and ornaments a tree with its fruit. ”

Since the claimer could ﬁnd nothing for himself on the earth, he went off 
and said to himself about the sun: “ This a huge great thing. Perhaps I’ll be 
able to ﬁnd a hole in it and open up a way in; then maybe I’ll be able to sub-
jugate it as well as the earth. ” So he said to the sun, as the ﬁre-worshippers 
speak, in the name of idolatry and in the language of the philosophy that is 
the mouthpiece of the Devil: “ You are a ruler, you own yourself; you dis-
pose of matters freely, as you wish. ” But the sun replied to him in the name 
of truth and through the tongue of reality and divine wisdom, saying: 

== turn referred him to the sun. And the sun referred him to all the stars. Each one of 
them said; “ Go away! If you are able to take possession of the next one up from me, do 
so, then come and try to be my master. If you are unable to defeat it, then you are unable to 
get possession of me. ” That is to say, one whose authority does not extend to all the stars 
cannot make a single particle heed his claim to mastery.

kilometres, the circle covers approximately a twenty-ﬁve thousand-year distance.

“ Allah forbid! A hundred thousand times, Allah forbid! I am a subservi-
ent ofﬁcial. I am a candelabrum in my Lord’s guesthouse. I do not truly own 
a ﬂy, or even a ﬂy’s wing. For in the ﬂy’s being there are immaterial jewels  
and antique works of art, like eyes and ears, such as are not in my shop. They 
are outside the sphere of my power, ” thus reprimanding him.

So  the  one  making  the  claims  changed  his  approach  and  said  with  the 
tongue of devilish philosophy: “ Since you do not own yourself, you are a 
servant; I claim you on behalf of causes. ” To which the sun replied, speak-
ing for truth and reality and with the tongue of worship: 

“ I can only belong to one who can create all the lofty stars, which are my 
fellows, and place them in the heavens with faultless wisdom, make them 
revolve with utter magniﬁcence and adorn them with exquisite ﬁnery. ”

Next  the  claimer  said  to  himself:  “ The  stars  are  a  great  multitude, 
and they seem to be all scattered and in disorder. Perhaps I will be able 
to  gain  something  out  of  them  on  behalf  of  my  clients. ”  So  he  went 
in  among  them  and  said  to  them  on  behalf  of  causes  and  those  things 
ascribed  to  Allah  as  partners,  in  the  language  of  rebellious  philosophy 
and  as  the  Sabean  star-worshippers  said:  “ You  are  so  scattered,  you 
must all be under the jurisdiction of different rulers. ” To which one star 
replied, speaking for all the others:

“ Just  how  stunned,  brainless,  stupid  and  blind  you  are  not  to  see  and 
understand the stamp of unity and seal of oneness on us, and not to recognize 
our lofty order and regularity and the laws of our worship. You imagine us 
to be without order. But we are the works of art and servants of a Single and 
Unique One Who holds in the grasp of His power the heavens, which are 
our seas, the cosmos, which is our tree, and inﬁnite space, which is where 
we make our excursions.

“ We are electric illuminations and resplendent witnesses displaying the 
perfection of His dominicality. We are radiant proofs proclaiming the sov-
ereignty of His dominicality. With all our different sorts, we are luminous 
servants in the domain of His sovereignty which give light and display the 
majesty of that sovereignty in the lofty dwellings and in the lowly ones, in 
the dwellings of this world, the Intermediate World and the hereafter.

“ Indeed, each of us is a miracle of the Single and Unique One’s power, a 
well-ordered fruit of the tree of creation, an illuminated proof of unity; each 
of us is a dwelling place, aeroplane and mosque for the angels; a lamp and 
sun for the lofty worlds, and a witness to the sovereignty of dominicality;

each of us is an ornament, palace, and ﬂower of space, and a shining ﬁsh in 
the heavenly seas, and a beautiful eye in the face of the sky. 1

“ Furthermore, throughout us as a whole there is a silence within tran-
quillity, a motion within wisdom, an adornment within majesty, a beauty of 
creation within order, and a perfection of art within symmetry.

“ And  although  we  are  thus  and  proclaim  our  Glorious  Maker  and  His 
unity, oneness, eternal besoughtedness, and His attributes of beauty, glory 
and  perfection  to  the  whole  universe  with  innumerable  tongues,  you  still 
accuse  us  utterly  pure,  clean,  obedient  and  subservient  servants  of  being 
confused,  disorderly,  and  without  duties,  and  even  of  being  without  an 
owner. You therefore deserve a truly punishing slap. ”

And one star, like the stone hurled at Satan, delivered such a mighty slap 
at the claimer’s face that it ﬂung him from the stars to the very pit of Hell. 
And it cast nature, 2 which was together with him, into the valleys of delu-
sion, and chance into the chasm of non-existence, and those things ascribed 
to Allah as partners into the darkness of impossibility, and the philosophy 
that is hostile to religion down to the lowest of the low. All the stars recited 
this sacred decree together with that star:

( 21:22 ) ¶ μ ´ ³ ² ± ° 
And they proclaimed: “ There is nothing, from a ﬂy’s wing to the lamps in 
the heavens, nothing, even the size of a ﬂy’s wing, in which those things 
ascribed to Allah as partners could interfere. ”

1.  This means, we are indications observing and contemplating the wonders of Allah 
Almighty’s creation and causing others to contemplate them. That is, just as the heavens 
are seen to be observing the wonders of divine art on the earth with countless eyes, so like 
the angels in the skies, the stars watch the earth, which is an exhibition of wonders and 
marvels, and they cause conscious creatures to observe it with attention.

2.    But  after  its  fall,  nature  repented.  It  understood  that  its  true  duty  was  not  to  act 
and to have an effect, but to accept and be passive. And it recognized that it was a sort of 
notebook  of  divine  determining,  but  a  notebook  capable  of  change  and  transformation; 
that it was a sort of programme of dominical power, was similar to the body of the rules of 
creation laid down by the All-Powerful One of Glory, and was a collection of His laws. It 
assumed its duty of worship with perfect submission acknowledging its utter impotence, 
and thus acquired the title of divine creation and dominical art.

of art which are being broadcast and exhibited, and so that attentive people 
will gaze on them, too.

Or, it is as if all the blossoming trees have beautiﬁed their verdant limbs 
with the ﬁnest adornment for the moment of their parade and for their own 
particular  festivals  in  the  general  festival  of  spring,  so  that  their  Glorious 
Monarch will contemplate the gifts, subtle wonders, and resplendent works 
of art He has bestowed upon them; and so that He will present to creation’s 
gaze the bejewelled instances of His mercy, in springtime, and on the face of 
the earth, which is the exhibition of divine art; and so that He will proclaim 
to humankind the wisdom in the creation of the tree.

He demonstrates the perfection of divine power through showing what 
important  treasure  hangs  on  their  delicate  branches  and  what  signiﬁcant 
wealth there is in the fruits of His merciful bounties.

The following explains the above passage, 
ٍةَ(cid:178)وﯭﯧ ُ(cid:126)  يِ(cid:158) اً(cid:98)وﯭﯧ ُ(cid:126) ىٰرَ(cid:98)  َفْ(cid:193)ﯬﯦ  ِءا َ(cid:175)ـ َ

ّمــُ(cid:102)

which in turn is an explanation of the verse quoted.

Firstly, the phrase: ٍةَ(cid:178)وﯭﯧ ُ(cid:126)  يِ(cid:158) اً(cid:98)وﯭﯧ ُ(cid:126) ىٰرَ(cid:98)  َفْ(cid:193)ﯬﯦ

The  verse  directs  an  attentive  gaze  to  the  beautifully  adorned  face  of 
the heavens so that the one beholding it may become aware of the silence 
there which is within a vast tranquillity, and so that he may understand that 
it is thus through the command and subjugation of a Possessor of Absolute 
Power.

For if they had been independent and unrestrained, those huge globes, all 
in close proximity to each other, those inﬁnite, awesome heavenly bodies, 
would have caused such an uproar with their enormously swift revolutions 
that they would have deafened the cosmos. And there would have been such 
confusion  in  that  tumultuous  commotion  that  it  would  have  scattered  the 
universe. It is well-known what an uproar is caused if twenty water buffalo 
work on top of each other. Whereas, astronomy says that there are among 
the stars some which are thousands of times larger than the earth and which 
revolve at a speed seventy times faster than a cannonball. So the degree of 
power and subjugation of the Glorious Maker and All-Powerful One of Per-
fection may be understood from this, together with the degree of the stars’ 
obedience and submission to Him.

Secondly, the phrase: ٍة َ(cid:175)ﯰﯧ ِ(cid:110) يِ(cid:158) ًةﯬﯦَرَ(cid:110)

The verse commands us to look at the motion on the face of the heav-
ens, which occurs with wisdom and purpose. Indeed, that mighty, wondrous 
motion occurs within a precise and comprehensive wisdom.

For example, a craftsman who operates a factory’s machinery with wis-
dom  and  purpose  demonstrates  the  degree  of  his  skill  and  craftsmanship 
proportionately to the order and grandeur of the factory. Similarly, when we 
look at it in this way, the degree of the All-Powerful One of Glory’s power 
and wisdom becomes apparent to us by His making the mighty sun a factory, 
and its planets, those awesome, immense globes, like the factory’s machin-
ery, and His spinning and revolving them like stones in a sling.

Thirdly, ٍةَ(cid:179)(cid:192)ِز يِ(cid:158) اً(cid:175)ـ ُ

ّ(cid:127)َ(cid:93)َ(cid:98) ٍة َ(cid:175)ـ ْ(cid:131)َ(cid:110) يِ(cid:158) اً(cid:87)ُ(cid:171)ْ(cid:87)َ(cid:171)َ(cid:98)

It has this meaning: the radiant majesty and smiling adornment on the 
face of the heavens are such that they demonstrate the sublimity of the Glo-
rious Maker’s sovereignty and exquisiteness of His artistry. As the myriad 
electric  lamps  hung  about  on  festival  days  demonstrate  the  degree  of  the 
king’s majesty and achievement in material progress, the vast heavens, too, 
with their majestic and adorned stars demonstrate to attentive gazes the sub-
lime sovereignty and exquisite artistry of the Glorious Maker.

Fourthly,  ِةَ(cid:151)ْ(cid:179) َ

ّ(cid:135)(cid:170)ا  ِناَزّ

This phrase says the following: look at the order of the creatures on the 
face of the heavens and see their symmetry and precise balance, then under-
stand just how powerful and wise is their Maker.

Indeed, the vast heavens demonstrate the degree of power and wisdom 
of the Being Who transforms various tiny creatures or animals, thus prepar-
ing  them  for  their  duties,  and  Who  impels  each  of  them  on  a  determined 
way with its particular balance, and the degree of moving bodies’ obedience 
and subjugation to Him. Similarly, the vast heavens demonstrate to attentive 
gazes  through  their  awesome  vastness  and  innumerable  stars,  the  exceed-
ingly ﬁne and particular balance with which the Glorious Maker carries out 
His dominicality. For despite their imposing hugeness and speedy revolu-
tions, the stars do not exceed their bounds by an iota, even for a second, or 
neglect their duties for a tenth of a second.

This  phrase  states  clearly  what  is  alluded  to  in  the  above  verse  and  in 
many similar to it and in Sura ‘Amma, which mention the subjugation of the 
sun, moon, and  stars. That is to say, to attach the heat and light-giving lamp 
of the sun to the embellished ceiling of the skies, and to make it the ink-pot 
for writing the Eternally Besought One’s missives in lines of day and night 
on the pages of summer and winter; and to make the moon, like the hour 
hands which shine on the large clocks on minarets and towers, an hour hand 
of time’s mighty clock on the dome of the heavens, and to make it move 
through its mansions with precise balance and perfect measure in the form 
of many varying crescents so that it leaves one crescent one night and then 
later returns to collect it; and to adorn the beautiful face of the sky with stars 
that twinkle and smile in the dome of the heavens, all these are signs of the 
unlimited sovereignty of a sustaining dominicality. They are indications of 
a majestic Divinity which makes Itself known to conscious creatures. They 
invite those who think to believe and to afﬁrm divine unity.

Second Stopping-Place 

(cid:2)(cid:3)

( 112:1-2 ) ' & * $ # " ! 

This Stopping-Place consists of three aims.

The First Aim

THE FIRST AIM

The representative of the people of misguidance and those who assign 
partners  to  Allah  fell  to  earth  at  the  slap  he  received  from  a  star,  as  was 
described at the end of the First Stopping-Place. So, because he could ﬁnd 
nothing going for him anywhere from the particles to the stars, he gave up 
laying claim to them in that way and instead, like Satan, tried by means of 
three  important  questions  to  induce  doubts  in  the  believers’  minds  about 
divine unity and oneness.

The First Question

T h e   F i r s t   Q u e s t i o n :  He said in the manner of the atheists: “ O you who 
believe in One Allah! Looking on behalf of my clients, I could ﬁnd nothing, 
nor get anything at all out of the beings in the universe; I could not substan-
tiate my claims. But then, how do you prove the existence of One Who is 
Single and Unique and possesses inﬁnite power? Why do you not think it 
possible for others to interfere and to share in His power? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :   It  is  decisively  proved  in  the  Twenty-Second  Word  that 
every  creature,  every  particle,  every  star,  is  an  illuminating  argument  for 
the  Necessarily  Existent  and  Absolutely  Powerful  One.  Every  link  in  the 
chains of beings in the universe is a clear evidence for His unity. The All-
Wise  Qur’an  proves  this  with  its  innumerable  proofs,  and  mentions  most 
frequently those proofs that are clearest in the view of people generally. For 
example:

( 31:25 ) ¬ « ª © ¨ § ¦ ¥
( 30:22 ) v u t s r q p o
With  these  and  many  verses  like  them,  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  presents 
the creation of the heavens and earth as self-evident proofs of divine unity. 

686

THIRTY-SECOND WORD – SECOND STOPPING-PLACE

687

So whether they like it or not, because of the way the heavens and earth have  
been created, anyone who is conscious and intelligent will be compelled to 
afﬁrm the Glorious Creator. As the Qur’an says: ¬ «

In the First Stopping-Place we started with a particle and demonstrated 
the stamp of unity on beings as far as the stars and the heavens. With verses 
like these the Qur’an repels the ascribing of partners to Allah from the stars 
and heavens down to particles. It indicates this in the following way.

The  Possessor  of  Absolute  Power  Who  creates  the  heavens  and  earth 
with such order and balance, of course creates the solar system, which is a 
region of it. The solar system is self-evidently within His controlling and 
directing grasp.

Since the Absolutely Powerful One holds the sun and its planets within 
His  grasp,  and  orders,  subjugates,  and  directs  them,  certainly  the  earth, 
which is a member of the solar system and is tied to the sun, is also within 
His regulating and controlling grasp. Since this is so, the beings which are 
created and inscribed on the face of the earth and are like its aims and fruits 
are also within His sustaining and perfecting grasp.

And  since  all  the  creatures  spread  and  scattered  over  the  earth,  which 
gild and adorn its face, are continuously renewed, coming and going, ﬁlling 
the earth and being emptied from it, they are all of them within the grasp of 
His knowledge and power; and since they are measured and ordered on the 
scales of justice and wisdom; and since all the species of beings are within 
the grasp of His power; certainly, all the well-ordered and faultless members 
of those species, which are like miniature specimens of the cosmos, balance-
sheets of its species, and tiny indexes of the book of the universe, must also 
be within His creating, sustaining, directing, and perfecting grasp.

And since this is so, the cells, blood corpuscles, limbs and muscles which 
comprise those animate creatures’ bodies are also self-evidently within the 
grasp of His knowledge and power.

And  since  every  cell  and  corpuscle  is  under  His  command  and  within 
His grasp, and since they are in motion according to His laws, surely the 
particles out of which they are formed and which are like shuttles weaving 
the embroideries of art which clothe them, are also necessarily within the 
grasp of His power and the sphere of His knowledge. For they are in motion 
in orderly fashion faultlessly performing duties at His command, with His 
permission, and through His power.

688

THE WORDS

And since this is so, the identifying features and distinguishing marks to 
be found on everyone, all the differences in faces, voices, and languages, of 
necessity also occur through His knowledge and wisdom.

So now look again at the verse which mentions and points out the begin-

ning and end of this chain:

 w v u t s r q p o
( 30:22 ) | { z y x
We therefore now say: O representative of the unbelievers! You can see, 
these  arguments  as  strong  as  the  chains  of  the  universe  prove  the  path  of 
afﬁrming divine unity, and they demonstrate a Possessor of Absolute Power. 
The  creation  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth  demonstrates  an  All-Powerful 
Maker, and the inﬁnite power of that All-Powerful Maker, and that His inﬁ-
nite power is at the point of inﬁnite perfection; since this is so, there is an 
absolute lack of need for any partners. That is to say, He in no way needs 
any associates.

Since He has no need, why do you take that dark path? Why do you 
feel  constrained  to  take  it?  Moreover,  since  both  He,  and  beings,  are  in 
absolutely no need of partners, just as it is impossible for there to be any 
partners in His Divinity, so it is impossible for there to be any in His crea-
tion and sustaining of beings. Their existence is impossible. The reason for 
this is as follows:

We proved that the power of the Maker of the heavens and the earth is 
both inﬁnite and at the point of inﬁnite perfection. If there were any partner, it 
would mean that, although His power is inﬁnite, another ﬁnite power would 
limit and overcome His inﬁnite and perfect power and would take posses-
sion of certain areas of it and in effect negate it. It would then be necessary, 
without there being any compulsion, for something ﬁnite to make something 
inﬁnite when it is inﬁnite ﬁnite and limited, and for itself to become inﬁnite 
for a time. This is a manifold and totally irrational impossibility.

Also,  since  there  is  no  need  for  partners,  and,  since  their  existence  is 
impossible, to claim otherwise is purely arbitrary. That is, since there is no 
cause  that  could  induce  such  a  claim,  rationally  or  logically,  it  would  be 
meaningless. According to the science of jurisprudence, such a claim is des-
ignated arbitrary. That is, it is a meaningless abstract claim.

A principle of the sciences of theology and jurisprudence is this,

that a probability not originating from any indication or sign has no impor-
tance; it cannot induce doubt in a matter that is deﬁnite. It cannot shake the 
certainty that is based on sound judgement.

For example, it is possible that Barla Lake or Eğridir Lake consists of 
grape-molasses or that it has been transformed into oil. But since that pos-
sibility does not originate from any indication, it does not affect our certain 
knowledge, or induce doubt in the fact, that it exists and consists of water.

Therefore, we questioned every sort of creature from every corner of the 
cosmos and whatever was questioned from the particles to the stars in the 
First Stopping-Place, and from the creation of the heavens and the earth to 
the  individual  features  in  faces  in  the  Second  Stopping-Place,  everything 
demonstrated through the tongue of its being the seal of unity; everything 
testiﬁed that Allah is One.

You saw this for yourself. There is, then, nothing in any of the creatures 
in the universe on which the possibility of Allah having any partners could 
be constructed. That is to say, since to claim that Allah does have partners 
is purely arbitrary and meaningless and is an abstract claim, it is pure igno-
rance and unqualiﬁed stupidity.

Thus, nothing remained for the representative of the people of misguid-
ance to say in the face of this. The only thing he could say was: “ What indi-
cates that Allah has partners is the conﬁguration of causes in the cosmos. It 
is that everything is tied to a cause. So that means that causes have an actual 
effect, and if they have an effect, are not they able to be Allah’s partners? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  Effects have been tied to causes because divine will and 
wisdom  require  them  to  be  so,  and  so  that  great  numbers  of  the  divine 
names may be manifested. Everything has been tied to a cause, but we have 
decisively proved in numerous places, including many of the Words, that 
“ causes have no actual power with which to create their effects. ” So, for 
now we shall just say this:

Among  causes  human  beings  are  self-evidently  the  most  superior,  and 
have the greatest power of choice and the most extensive ability to control 
and direct other causes. And among the most obvious of man’s actions over 
which he exercises choice are eating and the powers of speech and thought. 

َ
690

THE WORDS

Furthermore, all these faculties are extremely well-ordered, wonderful, and 
purposeful chains. But of the hundred links in these chains only one is sub-
ject to man’s power of choice.

For  example,  in  the  chain  of  actions  concerning  food,  which  stretches 
from the nourishment of the body’s cells to the forming of fruit, only moving 
the jaw and chewing the food is subject to man’s choice. And in the chain of 
speech, only exhaling air and blowing it into the mould of articulated letters. 
And while a word in the mouth is a seed, it becomes like a tree; in the air it 
yields the fruits of millions of the same word and enters the ears of listeners 
along with millions of others. Man’s imagination can barely reach this meta-
phorical shoot, so how should the short arm of choice reach it?

Since among causes man is the most superior and has the greatest  power 
of choice and yet his hands are thus tied from real creation, how should other 
causes, such as inanimate creatures, animals, the elements, and nature have 
any real power of disposal over other causes? Each of those causes is only a 
container; a cover for the dominical works; a tray-bearer for the gifts of the 
Compassionate One. 

Of course, the receptable for a king’s gift, or the handkerchief in which 
it is wrapped, or the person who brings the gift, which is placed in his hand, 
can in no way be partners in the king’s sovereignty. Anyone who supposes 
that they are partners is imagining nonsensical absurdities. In the same way, 
apparent causes and intermediaries can have absolutely no share in Allah’s 
sustaining of His creatures. Their lot is only to perform a service of worship.

The Second Aim

THE SECOND AIM

The representative of the ascribers of partners to Allah could in no respect 
prove that way, and so, although despairing, since he wanted to destroy the 
way of those who afﬁrm divine unity, he tried to sow doubts in their minds 
by asking the following question:

The Second Question

T h e   S e c o n d   Q u e s t i o n :  “ O you who afﬁrm divine unity! You say  , 
( 112:1-2 ) ' & * $ # " !  that the Creator of the universe 
is one, He is Single, He is Eternally Besought by all creatures; and that the 
Creator of everything is He; that He is one in essence and at the same time 
the reins of all things are directly in His hand, the key to everything is in 
His grasp, everything is under his control, one thing cannot be an obstacle 
to another. And you say that at the same instant He has total disposal over 
all things and all their states. How can such a far-fetched fact be believed? 

THIRTY-SECOND WORD – SECOND STOPPING-PLACE

691

How can a single individual be in innumerable places and do innumerable 
things at the same time with no difﬁculty? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  This question may be answered by explaining an extremely 
profound, subtle, elevated, and comprehensive mystery concerning divine 
oneness and eternal besoughtedness. The human mind can look at this mys-
tery only through the telescope of a comparison and observatory of a para-
ble. While there is nothing similar or analogous to Allah Almighty’s essence 
and attributes, the functions of His attributes may be considered to an extent 
by means of comparisons and parables. So we shall point to that mystery 
through comparisons of a material nature.

First Comparison

F i r s t   C o m p a r i s o n :   As  is  proved  in  the  Sixteenth  Word,  a  single  indi-
vidual may attain universality or comprehensiveness by means of different 
mirrors. While actually being a true particular, it as though becomes a uni-
versal with numerous qualities and functions.

Indeed, matter like glass and water may act as mirrors to physical objects, 
and one such object may attain universality in such a mirror. In the same 
way, air, ether, and some creatures from the World of Similitudes are like 
mirrors to lucent objects and spirit beings. With the speed of lightning or 
imagination those mirror-like creatures become means of travel and spectat-
ing, so that the lucent and spirit beings travel with the speed of imagination 
in  those  spotless  mirrors,  those  subtle  dwellings.  In  the  space  of  a  single 
instant the spirit beings can enter thousands of places. And because they are 
lucent and because their reﬂections are the same as them and possess their 
qualities, they are as though present in person in every mirror, everywhere, 
as is contrary to the case with physical beings.

The reﬂections and likenesses of dense corporeal beings are not identical 
to the corporeality of those beings; they do not possess their qualities and 
may be thought of as dead. For example, although the sun is a particular and 
a single individual, it becomes like a universal by means of shining objects. 
It reﬂects its image, a sun like itself, in all shining objects, drops of water, 
and fragments of glass on the face of the earth, according to their capacity. 
The sun’s heat, light, and the seven colours in its light, a sort of likeness of 
the essential sun, is found in all shining physical objects.

Let  us  suppose  the  sun  had  knowledge  and  consciousness,  then  every 
mirror would be a sort of dwelling-place or seat or chair for it, it would be 
in contact with everything in person. It would be able to communicate with 
all  conscious  creatures  by  means  of  mirrors,  with  the  pupil  of  every  eye, 
even, each of which would be like a telephone. One thing would not be an 

692

THE WORDS

obstacle to another. Communicating with one thing would not be a barrier 
to communicating with another. While being present everywhere, it would 
be present nowhere.

If the sun, which is a material, partial, and inanimate mirror to only the 
divine name of Light out of innumerable names, can therefore display uni-
versal activity in an unlimited number of places while being a single indi-
vidual,  should  the  All-Glorious  One,  with  the  oneness  of  His  essence,  be 
unable to perform innumerable actions at the same time?

Second Comparison

S e c o n d   C o m p a r i s o n :   Since  the  cosmos  is  like  a  tree,  all  trees  may  be 
likened to the truths of the universe. So we shall take the mighty and majes-
tic plane tree facing this room as a miniature example of the universe and 
demonstrate with it the manifestation of divine oneness in the universe.

This tree has at least ten thousand fruits and each fruit has at least a hun-
dred winged seeds. At one instant of time the ten thousand fruits and million 
seeds display all together one art and creativity. While the centre of the laws 
of the tree’s formation is present in its original seed, roots and trunk, through 
a  manifestation of divine will and a condensing of the dominical command, 
which may be described as particular, individuated, and a knot of life, it is 
also present at the ends of all its branches, within every fruit and every seed. 
No part of any member of the tree is lacking the laws, they are not obstacles 
to one another; the tree is formed through them.

And that single manifestation of will and law issuing from a command 
are not transmitted and radiated like light, heat, and air. For they leave no 
trace nor may any hint of them be perceived in the long distances and vari-
ous beings between the places they go. If their being present in all the fruits 
and seeds had occurred through being transmitted and radiated, some trace 
or hint of them would have been perceived. Rather, they are present in all 
those places without being fragmented or radiated.

The universal and general actions are not incompatible with His oneness 
and individuality. It may even be said that while the manifestation of will, 
and the law and life-source are present in all the places, they are present in 
none of them.

It is as if the law has as many eyes and ears as there are fruits and seeds 
of the majestic tree. Yes, each part of the tree is like a centre of the senses of 
the law, so that their long intermediaries are not a veil and do not form a bar-
rier, but like telephone wires are a means of facilitating and bringing things 
closer. The farthest is like the nearest.

THIRTY-SECOND WORD – SECOND STOPPING-PLACE

693

Since, as is clear from observation, through a single partial manifestation 
of an attribute of the Single and Eternally Besought One like will, millions 
of  events  occur  in  millions  of  places  without  intermediary,  one  has  to  be 
certain, completely certain, that the All-Glorious One can have total disposal 
over the tree of the universe, together with all its parts and particles, through 
the manifestation of His power and will. 

As is proved and explained in the Sixteenth Word, while being in one 
place  and  being  particulars  identiﬁable  as  single,  through  the  mystery  of 
luminosity, impotent and subjugated creatures like the sun, and semi-lumi-
nous creatures like spirit beings, which are restricted by matter, and the laws 
issuing from a command and the manifestations of will which are the life-
source and centre of direction of this plane tree, which in turn are like its light 
and spirit, are clearly present in numerous places and in numerous events. 
While being particulars restricted by matter, it is as though they acquire an 
absolute universality, and through the exercise of will, in the space of one 
second  may  demonstrably  perform  a  great  number  of  works.  You  see  for 
yourself and you will not be able to deny it. 

The Single and Most Pure and Holy Essence, Whose attributes are all-
comprehending  and  functions,  universal,  is  far  beyond  and  exalted  above  
matter, and is utterly remote and free from any restriction and the darkness 
of density. All these lights and luminous beings are but obscure shadows of 
His sacred names; and all existence and life and the World of Spirits, the 
Intermediate Realm, and the World of Similitudes, semi-transparent mirrors 
reﬂecting His beauty.

What  being  can  be  hidden  in  the  face  of  His  oneness,  which  is  within 
the  manifestation  of  His  attributes  and  actions,  which  in  turn  are  evident 
through His universal will, absolute power, and all-embracing knowledge? 
What matter can be difﬁcult for Him? What place can be concealed from 
Him? What object can remain distant from Him? What individual can draw 
close to Him without acquiring universality? Can anything at all be hidden 
from Him? Can any matter at all be an obstacle to another? Can any place at 
all be empty of His presence?

Ibn al-‘Abbas ( May Allah be pleased with him ) said: “He has an imma-
terial  eye  that  sees  and  ear  that  hears  all  beings.”  Is  this  not  so?  Are  the 
chains of beings not each like a wire or vein for the swift conveyance of His 
commands and laws? Are obstacles and difﬁculties not means and interme-
diaries in His disposal of beings? Are causes and intermediaries not merely 
an apparent veil?

THE WORDS

While He is present nowhere, is He not present everywhere? Does He 
have any need to be located in a place or situation? Can the veils of distance, 
smallness, and the degrees of existence be obstacles to His proximity, power 
of disposal, and witnessing?

Moreover, could the qualities pertaining to material, contingent, dense, 
numerous, restricted, and limited beings, and the states of change, transfor-
mation, division, and occupying space, which are their particular and con-
ﬁned  necessary  consequences,  in  any  way  touch  the  Most  Pure  and  Holy 
Essence,  Who  is  far  beyond  matter,  is  Necessarily  Existent,  the  Light  of 
Lights, and is Single, One, and free from any restriction or limitation and 
exalted above and pure of any fault or deﬁciency? Could impotence in any 
way be ﬁtting for Him? Could any defect approach the skirt of His splendour 
and glory?
Conclusion of the Second Aim

Conclusion of the Second Aim

Once, when I was reﬂecting on divine oneness, I looked at the fruits on 
the plane tree outside my room. A chain of thought came to me as inspira-
tion, and I write it here in Arabic exactly as it came to me. 1

All these fruits and the seeds within them are miracles of dominical wis-
dom, wonders of divine art, gifts of divine mercy, material proofs of divine 
unity, bearers of the good news that divine favours will be granted in the 
hereafter. Just as they are all truthful witnesses to His all-embracing power 
and knowledge, so each of them is a mirror conﬁrming His unity in all the 
corners of the world of multiplicity and in all the parts of a sort of world that 
has become multiple, like this tree.

They turn the gaze from multiplicity to unity. Each of them says through 
the tongue of its being: “ Don’t let your gaze wander over all this mighty 
spreading tree lest you become distracted, for the whole tree is within us. Its 
multiplicity is contained within our unity. ”

Even, as the heart of the fruit, every seed is a physical mirror conﬁrm-
ing divine unity. So too it recites in the silent prayer of its heart, the divine 
names the mighty tree recites in its audible prayer.

Furthermore,  just  as  the  fruits  and  seeds  are  mirrors  professing  divine 
unity,  so  they  are  the  visible  signs  of  divine  determining  and  embodied 
tokens  of  divine  power.  With  these  words,  divine  determining  and  power 
intimate the following: 

“ The many branches and twigs of this tree appeared from a single seed 
and  demonstrate  the  unity  of  the  tree’s  Artist  in  creating  it  and  giving  it 
form. Then, after growing and spreading its branches, it gathered together 
all its truths in a single fruit; it encapsulated its entire meaning in a single 
seed, thereby demonstrating the wisdom in the Glorious Creator’s creation 
and planning. ”

ّ
696

THE WORDS

Similarly,  the  tree  of  the  universe  takes  its  existence  from  a  source  of 
unity and is sustained by it. And man, the fruit of the universe, demonstrates 
unity within this multiplicity of beings, while with the eye of belief his heart 
sees the mystery of unity within multiplicity.

Moreover, the fruits and seeds are allusions of dominical wisdom. Wis-
dom says the following with them to those who are aware: “ The compre-
hensive regard towards this tree and its planning look with their compre-
hensiveness and universality to a single fruit. For the fruit is a miniature 
specimen of the tree. It is what is aimed at by the tree. Also, the compre-
hensive regard and planning look to all the seeds within the fruit, for each 
seed bears the meaning or index of the whole tree. That is to say, since the 
fruit is the aim the tree’s existence and the purpose of its creation, the One 
Who plans the tree regards each fruit with all His names connected to the 
planning. Moreover, the mighty tree is sometimes pruned and trimmed for 
the sake of the tiny fruit; some parts of it are destroyed so that it may make 
new growth. It is grafted in order to produce even better, permanent fruit. ”
In the same way, man, who is the fruit of the tree of the universe, is the 
purpose of its creation and existence and the aim of the creation of beings. 
While his heart, which is the seed of the fruit, is a most brilliant and com-
prehensive mirror to the universe’s Maker. It follows on from this wisdom, 
therefore, that tiny man will be the cause of the destruction and transforma-
tion of the universe. He will be the point of momentous revolutions like the 
Day of Resurrection. It will be for his judgement that the door of this world 
will be closed and that of the hereafter opened.

Since we have arrived at a discussion of resurrection, it is appropriate to 
explain one point concerning its reality which demonstrates the clarity and 
strength with which the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition illuminates and 
proves resurrection.

The result yielded by this sequence of thought shows that if it is necessary 
for man’s judgement and his gaining eternal happiness, the whole universe 
will be destroyed and that a power capable of destroying and transforming 
the universe shows itself and exists. But resurrection has many degrees. It is 
obligatory to believe in some of them; they must be acknowledged. Whereas 
others  become  apparent  according  to  levels  in  spiritual  and  intellectual 
development, and for these knowledge pertaining to both are necessary.

In order to present cogent and strong proofs for the simplest and easiest 
level, the All-Wise Qur’an points out a power capable of opening up a truly 
vast realm of resurrection. The degree of resurrection in which it is neces-
sary for all to believe is this: 

THIRTY-SECOND WORD – SECOND STOPPING-PLACE

697

After human beings die, their spirits depart for another realm. And their 
bodies rot except for a minute cell from the base of the spine which will act 
as a seed. It remains intact, and on the Day of Resurrection Allah Almighty 
will create the human body out of it and return its spirit to it. 1 This degree is 
so simple, then, it may be seen every spring through millions of examples.

Sometimes in order to prove this degree, the verses of the Qur’an point 
out the unlimited activity of a power capable of raising to life all particles, 
and  sometimes  the  traces  of  a  power  and  wisdom  capable  of  sending  all 
creatures to extinction and then recalling them. Then they point to the activ-
ity and traces of a power and wisdom able to scatter the stars and shatter the 
heavens, and sometimes to the activity and manifestations of a power and 
wisdom capable of causing all animate creatures to die and then raising them 
to life again all at once at a single trumpet-blast.

Sometimes  the  verses  demonstrate  the  manifestations  of  a  power  and  
wisdom  that  will  raise  to  life  all  the  animate  creatures  on  the  face  of  the 
earth separately and gather them together. And sometimes they demonstrate 
the traces of a power and wisdom that, lopping off its mountains, will cause 
the globe of the earth to disintegrate completely, and then restoring it will 
transform it into an even more excellent form.

That is to say, apart from the Day of Resurrection, in which it is obliga-
tory for everyone to believe and to acknowledge, with that power and wis-
dom, Allah Almighty can create numerous other degrees of resurrections. 
And what is more, dominical wisdom requires that besides certainly bring-
ing  about  humankind’s  resurrection,  He  shall  bring  about  all  those  other 
degrees or create certain other important matters.

A   Q u e s t i o n :  You say: “ You make much use of analogies in the form of 
comparisons  or  parables  in  the  Words.  Whereas  according  to  the  science 
of  logic,  this  form  of  analogy  does  not  afford  certainty.  2  A  logical  proof 
is required for matters of certain knowledge. Analogy in the form of com-
parison  and  parable  is  utilized  by  scholars  of  jurisprudence  in  matters  in 
which the prevailing opinion is sufﬁcient. Also, you present comparisons in 
the form of stories; the stories are imaginary and cannot be true. Is this not 
contrary to reality? ” 

T h e   A n s w e r :  It has been stated in the science of logic that analogies in 
the  form  of  comparisons  and  parables  do  not  afford  certain  knowledge.  3

THE WORDS

However, there is a certain type of this form of analogy that forms a proof 
more  powerful  than  those  proofs  of  logic  yielding  certainty.  This  type  of 
analogy is as follows.

It demonstrates the tip of a universal truth by means of a partial compari-
son and constructs its conclusion on that truth. It demonstrates the truth’s 
law in a particular matter, so that the vast truth may be known and particular 
matters may be ascribed to it.

For example, although the sun is a single being, by means of luminosity 
it is present in every shining object. The law of a truth is demonstrated by 
means of this comparison which states that light and luminosity cannot be 
restricted: for them, distance and proximity are the same, many and few are 
equal, and space cannot conquer them.

This  is  another  example:  a  tree’s  fruits  and  leaves  are  all  shaped  and 
formed at the same time, in the same fashion, easily and perfectly, in a single 
centre and through a law issuing from a command. This is a comparison or 
parable demonstrating the tip of a mighty truth and universal law. It  proves 
the truth and the truth’s law in a truly decisive form, so that, like the tree, the 
mighty universe displays and is the ﬁeld of operation of that law of truth and 
mystery of divine oneness.

Thus, the analogies, comparisons, and parables employed in all the Words 
are in this form and are more powerful and afford more certainty than the 
categorical proofs of logic.

A n s w e r   t o   t h e   s e c o n d   p a r t   o f   t h e   q u e s t i o n :  It is a well-known fact that in 
the science of rhetoric, when the true or literal meaning of a word or phrase 
is used solely as a means of conveying another meaning, it is called an allu-
sive expression. The literal meaning of a word or phrase deﬁned as allusive 
is not either true or false; it is the allusive meaning that is such. If the allusive 
meaning is correct then the phrase is true. Even if its literal meaning is not 
true, it does not damage the statement’s veracity. If the allusive meaning is 
not correct while its literal meaning is, then the phrase is false. For example, 
“ So-and-so’s sword-belt is very long. ” This phrase alludes to the man’s tall 
stature. If he was tall but did not have a sword and belt, the phrase would 
still be correct and true. If he was not tall but had a long sword and belt, then 
the phrase would be false, since it is not its literal meaning that is intended. 1
The  stories  or  parables  in  the  Words,  for  example,  those  in  the  Tenth 
and Twenty-Second Words, are sorts of allusions. The truths at the end of

the stories are extremely correct, extremely true, and conformable to real-
ity; they are the allusive meanings of the stories. Their literal meanings are 
comparisons that bring distant objects close like a telescope and however 
they may be it does not damage their veracity and truthfulness. Moreover, 
all those stories are comparisons or parables. Purely to enable people in gen-
eral to understand, what is properly communicated without words is put into 
words, and immaterial and abstract matters are represented in material form.

The Third Aim

THIRD AIM

After receiving this decisive and convincing answer to his second ques-
tion,  1  the  representative  of  all  the  people  of  misguidance  was  reduced  to 
silence, but then asked the following third question.

“ Phrases  in  the  Qur’an  like  ( 23:14 ) ª  ©  and W V 
( 7:151 ) suggest that there  are other creators and compassionate ones. And 
you also say, ‘the Creator of all the worlds possesses endless perfections. 
United in Him are the utmost levels of every kind of perfection.’ Whereas, 
the perfections of beings are known through their opposites: if there were no 
pain, pleasure would not be a sort of perfection; if there were no darkness, 
light could not be proved to exist; if there were no separation, there would 
be no pleasure in union, and so on, would there? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :   We  shall  answer  the  ﬁrst  part  of  the  question  with  ﬁve 

indications.

First Indication

FIRST  INDICATION:  From  beginning  to  end,  the  Qur’an  demon-
strates  divine  unity;  this  is  a  clear  indication  that  those  sort  of  phrases  in 
the Qur’an are not as you understand them. Rather, ª  © is to say, 
“ He is at the highest and best rank of creativity, ” which in no way indicates 
that there is another creator. Like the other attributes, creativity has many 
degrees or ranks. “ T h e   B e s t   o f   C r e a t o r s  ” means, “ He is a Glorious Creator 
at the furthest and most excellent degree of creativity. ”

Second Indication

SECOND INDICATION: Terms like, ª  © do not look to a 
plurality  of  creators,  but  to  the  varieties  of  the  state  of  being  creature. 
That is, “ He is a Creator Who creates everything in an appropriate form, 
at a faultless degree. ” Verses like,  ( 32:7 ) x w v u  express this 
meaning.

1.  That is, the question at the beginning of the Second Aim, not the small questions at 

the end of the Conclusion.

THIRD INDICATION: The comparison suggested by terms like, 
ّ(cid:195)َا  »  

 ª © and «  َن(cid:193)ِ(cid:179) ِ(cid:127)ْ(cid:111)ُ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)ا ُرْ(cid:193)َ(cid:114) »

are not comparative and superlative adjectives comparing Allah Almighty’s 
actual  attributes  and  actions  with  others  who  possess  samples  of  those 
attributes  and  actions.  For  all  the  perfections  in  the  universe,  and  in  jinn, 
men, and angels, are but pale shadows in relation to His perfection. How 
could any comparison be possible? It is rather human beings, and particu-
larly the people of neglect, who see perfection in terms of comparison.

For example, a private shows complete obedience and respect to his cor-
poral. It seems to him that all beneﬁts come from him and he thinks little of 
the king. Even if he does think of him, it is still to the corporal that he shows 
his gratitude. So it is said to the private: “ See here! The king is much greater 
than your corporal, it is only him that you should thank. ” Now this sentence 
does not compare the king’s imperial commandership,  which is actual, with 
the corporal’s command, which is partial and only apparent; because to do 
so  would  be  meaningless.  The  private  prefers  the  corporal  and  loves  and 
thanks only him as a result of what he considers important and how he sees 
his relations with the corporal.

Similarly,  when  apparent  causes  are  imagined  to  be  the  creator  and 
bestower of bounties in the view of the people of neglect, they become a 
veil to the True Bestower of Bounties. Such neglectful people cling onto 
causes and suppose that bounties and favours are from them; they praise 
and acclaim them. The Qur’an says: “ Allah Almighty is a greater, more 
excellent Creator, a far better Bestower of Bounties. So look to Him, and 
thank Him. ”

Fourth Indication

FOURTH  INDICATION:  Just  as  there  may  be  comparison  between 
actual beings and preference for some over others, so there may be compari-
sons between possible or even hypothetical things and preference. Numerous 
degrees or levels are present in the true natures of most things. So too, in the 
view of the intellect, innumerable degrees may be present in the true natures 
of the divine names and sacred attributes. Whereas Allah Almighty is at the 
most perfect and excellent of all the possible and imagined degrees of those 
attributes  and  names.  The  whole  universe  witnesses  to  this  truth  through 
all its perfections. ( 59:24 ) ½ ¼ »  “ describing all His names as the 
most excellent, ” expresses this meaning.

Fifth Indication

THIRTY-SECOND WORD – SECOND STOPPING-PLACE

FIFTH INDICATION: This use of the comparative and superlative is 
not to be understood in terms of creatures, but in terms of the fact that Allah 
Almighty has two sorts of manifestations and attributes.

T h e   F i r s t   S o r t :  In accordance with the mystery of His unity, this consists 
of His disposal over creatures under the veil of causes and intermediaries 
and in the form of universal laws.

T h e   S e c o n d   S o r t :  In accordance with the mystery of His oneness, it is 
His disposal over creatures directly, without veil, regarding each in a par-
ticular way. This means that through the mystery of oneness, His bestowal, 
creation, and grandeur which are direct, are greater and more elevated and 
excellent than the works of His bestowal, creation, and grandeur which are 
apparent through the manifestations of causes and intermediaries.

For example, let us suppose there is a king, but he is a saint-king. He has 
great numbers of ofﬁcials and commanders but they are only veils, for the 
authority and execution of all matters are directly in his hand. The king’s 
power of disposal and execution of affairs are of two kinds:

T h e   F i r s t   K i n d :  The execution of affairs he demonstrates and the com-
mands he gives through a universal law in the form of visible ofﬁcials and 
commanders in accordance with their abilities and ranks.

T h e   S e c o n d   K i n d :  This is not through universal laws. He does not make 
visible ofﬁcials a veil; his execution of affairs and royal favours are direct 
and may be described as more elevated and excellent.

In the same way, the Creator of the universe, the Monarch of Pre-Eter-
nity  and  Post-Eternity,  has  made  causes  and  intermediaries  veils  to  His 
execution of affairs and has demonstrated the majesty of His dominicality. 
But He left private telephones in His servants’ hearts so that, charged with 
a particular worship, they might leave causes behind and turn directly to 
Him, and might declare: ( 1:5 ) 5 4 3 2

28.

ٰ
702

THE WORDS

T h e  A n s w e r :  The questioner does not know what true perfection is. What 
he has in mind is only relative perfection. For merits, virtues, and qualities 
that look to something and are acquired relatively to something else are not 
real, they are relative and weak. If what they look to disappears, then they 
too will disappear.

For example, the relative pleasure and merits of heat occur through the 
effect of cold, and the relative pleasure of food, through the effect of the pain 
of hunger. If the cold and hunger disappear, then the pleasure diminishes. 
Whereas true pleasure, love, perfection, and virtue are such that they are not 
constructed on imagining something else. They are present of themselves. 
They are essential, inherent truths.

Qualities such as the following are like this: the pleasures of existence, 
life, love, knowledge, belief, permanence, mercy, and compassion; and the 
beauty of light, sight, speech, noble-heartedness, ﬁne character, and form; 
the perfection of essence and of attribute and perfection in actions. Whether 
or not there is something else, these qualities will not change. Thus, all the 
perfections  of  the  Glorious  Fashioner,  the  Beauteous  Maker,  the  Perfect 
Creator are true perfections; they are essential and what is other than Him 
cannot affect Him. They can only be recipients.

The Second Sign

The Second Sign: Sayyid Sharif al-Jurjani wrote in S h a r h   a l - M a w a q i f : 
“ The cause of love is either pleasure, beneﬁt, resemblance ( that is, inclina-
tion towards creatures of same kind ), or perfection. For perfection is loved 
for itself. ” 1 That is to say, if you love something, you love it either because 
of the pleasure it affords, or the beneﬁts it brings, or because it is similar 
in kind like the inclination towards children, or because it possesses some 
perfection. If it is for perfection, no other cause or purpose is necessary; it is 
loved purely for itself. For example, everybody loves people of former times 
who possessed perfection; even if they have no connection with them they 
still love them admiringly.

Thus,  since  all  Allah  Almighty’s  perfections  and  qualities  and  all  the 
degrees in His beautiful names are true perfections, they are loved for them-
selves. The Glorious One, Who is the true beloved, loves His perfections, 
which are true perfections, and the beauties of His attributes and names in a 
manner appropriate to Himself. And He loves the good qualities of His art 
and creatures, which are mirrors reﬂecting those perfections.

He  loves  His  prophets  and  saints,  especially  the  Most  Noble  Beloved 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), who is the Lord of the Prophets and

Prince of the Saints. That is, with His love for His own beauty, He loves 
His Beloved One ( UWBP ), who is the mirror to that beauty. With His love 
for His own names, He loves His Beloved ( UWBP ) and his brothers who 
are  comprehensive  and  aware  loci  of  those  names’  manifestations.  With 
His  love  for  His  art,  He  loves  His  Beloved  ( UWBP )  and  those  like  him 
who are heralds and exhibitors of that art. With His love for His artefacts, 
He  loves  His  Beloved  ( UWBP )  and  those  who  follow  him  who  appreci-
ate and admire those artefacts and respond to them saying: “ What wonders 
Allah has willed! How beautifully they have been made. ” And with His love 
for the good qualities of His creatures, He loves His Most Noble Beloved 
( UWBP ) and his followers and brothers in whom are united the ﬁnest of 
moral qualities.

The Third Sign

The Third Sign: All the perfections in all the universe are signs and indi-
cations of a Glorious Being’s perfection and beauty. Indeed, all the good-
ness, perfection, and beauty in the universe is but a pale shadow in relation 
to His true perfection. We shall mention brieﬂy ﬁve proofs of this truth.

First Proof

F i r s t   P r o o f :  A perfect, splendidly adorned and decorated palace plainly 
points  to  perfect  skill  and  craftsmanship.  And  the  craftsmanship  and  art, 
which is a perfect act, plainly points to a perfect author, master, and crafts-
man together with his titles and names like fashioner and adorner. And those 
perfect names doubtlessly point to the master’s perfect and skilful attributes. 
And that perfect skill and those attributes self-evidently point to his perfect 
ability and faculty. And that perfect ability and faculty necessarily point to 
the perfection of his essence and the exaltedness of his nature.

In  exactly  the  same  way,  this  palace  of  the  universe,  this  perfect  and 
adorned work of art, self-evidently points to actions of the utmost perfec-
tion. For perfections in works of art result from perfection of action; they 
demonstrate it. And perfection of actions point to a Perfect Author and the 
perfect names of that Author. That is, in relation to the works of art, they 
point to the perfection of such names as Planner, Fashioner, All-Wise, All-
Compassionate, and Adorner.

Moreover,  the  perfection  of  the  names  and  titles,  without  any  doubt, 
point to the Author’s perfect attributes. For if the attributes were not per-
fect,  the  names  and  titles  which  originate  from  the  attributes  would  not 
be perfect. And the perfection of the attributes self-evidently points to the 
perfection of His functioning essence, because it is from the functioning 
essence that the attributes proceed. And the perfection of essential func-
tions  points  at  the  degree  of  knowledge  of  certainty  to  the  perfection  of 

704

THE WORDS

the functioning essence. It points to a perfection so worthy that although 
the light of the perfection passes through the veils of functions, attributes, 
names, actions, and works of art, it still demonstrates the goodness, beauty, 
and perfection to be seen to this great extent in the universe,

Thus, after the existence of this degree of true, essential perfection has 
been established with cogent proofs what importance remains for relative 
perfections, which look to other things and which exist only in so far as they 
gain superiority over their likes and opposites? You may understand, then, 
just how paltry they become.

Second Proof

S e c o n d   P r o o f :  When the universe is studied as something from which 
lessons are to be taken, the conscience and heart may conjecture and per-
ceive the following: the one who has so beautiﬁed and adorned the universe 
with  all  manner  of ﬁne  things,  must  himself  possess  an  inﬁnite  degree  of 
beauty and perfection so that he might make it thus.

Third Proof

T h i r d   P r o o f :  It is a well-known fact that works of art which are well-
proportioned, symmetrical, perfect, and beautiful are based on an exceed-
ingly well-drawn-up plan. And a perfectly drawn plan points to a perfectly 
sound knowledge, ﬁne intellect, and reﬁned faculty of spirit. That is to say, 
it is the spirit’s immaterial beauty which is manifested in art by means of 
knowledge. Thus, the universe, with its innumerable material ﬁne quali-
ties, is formed of the distillations of immaterial ﬁne qualities pertaining to  
knowledge. And those immaterial qualities pertaining to knowledge and 
those  perfections  are  certainly  the  manifestations  of  an  inﬁnite,  eternal 
loveliness, beauty, and perfection.

Fourth Proof

F o u r t h   P r o o f :   It  is  obvious  that  that  which  gives  light  must  possess 
light, and that which illuminates must be luminous, that bounty comes from 
riches, and kindness proceeds from one who is kind. Since this so, since all 
this loveliness and beauty is given to the universe and perfection is bestowed 
on beings, they point to an eternal beauty as light points to the sun.

Beings  pass  over  the  face  of  the  earth  like  a  vast  river  sparkling  with 
ﬂashes of perfection. In the same way that a river sparkles with manifesta-
tions of the sun, the ﬂood of beings momentarily sparkles with ﬂashes of 
loveliness, beauty, and perfection, and then is gone. And the beings follow-
ing after them display the same ﬂashes and sparkling. It may be understood 
from this that just as the manifestations and instances of beauty on the ﬂow-
ing  bubbles  of  water  are  not  from  themselves,  but  are  manifestations  and 
instances of beauty from the light of a sun, so the qualities and perfections 

THIRTY-SECOND WORD – SECOND STOPPING-PLACE

705

which glisten brieﬂy on the ﬂood of the universe are the ﬂashes of the beauty 
of an Eternal Sun’s names.

Fifth Proof

F i f t h   P r o o f :   If  four  people  who  have  arrived  via  four  different  routes 
all speak of the same event, it suggests with a certainty born of unanimity 
that the event deﬁnitely occurred. Thus, although their ways, dispositions, 
abilities, and times were all different, all the scholars of religion with their 
different  ranks,  the  saints  and  puriﬁed  ones  with  their  different  paths  and 
ways, and the true philosophers with their different creeds are in agreement. 
They are the people of illumination and experiential knowledge, who have 
unveiled  the  secrets  of  the  cosmos  and  have  observed  and  borne  witness 
to the truth – through their unveilings, illuminations, and witnessings, they 
have unanimously agreed that the qualities and perfections to be seen in the 
mirrors and displays of the universe and its beings, are the manifestations of 
a Single Necessarily Existent One’s perfection and the manifestations of the 
beauty of His names.

Their consensus and accord, then, constitutes an unshakeable proof.
Let us suppose that in order not to hear this Sign, the representative of the 
people of misguidance was compelled to stop up his ears and ﬂee. For  cer-
tainly, like bats, heads so plunged into darkness cannot endure these lights. 
In which case, from here on we shall consider them little, if at all.

The Fourth Sign

The  Fourth  Sign:  Rather  than  looking  to  its  likes  and  opposites,  the 
pleasure, loveliness, and beauty of a thing look to where those qualities are 
manifested.  For  example,  generosity  is  a  ﬁne  and  pleasing  attribute.  The 
pleasure a generous person obtains from the joy and pleasure of those he 
has favoured is thousands of times more gratifying than the relative pleasure 
obtained from feeling superior to other generous people.

Also, a kind and compassionate person receives true pleasure proportion-
ately to those towards whom he has been compassionate ﬁnd ease and com-
fort.  For  example,  the  pleasure  a  mother  receives  from  the  happiness  and 
comfort of her children, because of her compassion, is so strong she would 
sacriﬁce her very soul for their comfort. The pleasure of such compassion 
will even make a hen attack a lion in order to protect her chicks.

706

THE WORDS

Thus, the true pleasure, goodness, happiness and perfection in elevated 
attributes do not look to peers and opposites, but to their dependants and 
the places they are manifested. The beauty, therefore, of the Beauteous and 
Perfect  One’s  mercy,  Who  is  Ever-Living  and  Self-Subsistent,  Clement 
and Benevolent, Compassionate and Merciful, looks to those who receive 
His mercy.

There are endless degrees in the happiness, enjoyment and joy of those 
who  receive  the  manifestation  of  His  mercy  and  compassion,  and  espe-
cially  those  who  receive  its  endless  varieties  in  everlasting  Paradise.  We 
may understand that, according to the degrees of their happiness and joy, 
the Merciful and Compassionate One experiences exalted, pure, holy, and 
beautiful meanings, like fondness and love, in a manner appropriate to Him, 
that may be described through qualities which are proper to Him. He pos-
sesses utterly pure and holy qualities which we may not mention because the 
Shari‘a does not permit it, but which may be described as sacred pleasure, 
holy love, pure joy and sacred happiness. We have proved in many places 
that they are inﬁnitely more exalted, elevated, holy, and pure than the love, 
joy,  and  happiness  that  we  see  in  the  universe  and  may  perceive  among 
creatures. If you wish to take a look at a ﬂash of those meanings, then look 
through the telescope of the following comparisons.

For  example,  a  noble-hearted,  magnanimous  personage  laid  out  a  ﬁne 
banquet  on  his  magniﬁcent  voyaging  ship  in  order  to  feed  the  poor,  the 
needy, and hungry. Then he himself watched from on deck. You can under-
stand how pleased and happy the thankful pleasure and appreciative grati-
tude  of  the  poor,  hungry  and  needy  made  that  generous  personage;  how 
much it gratiﬁed him.

Man is not the true owner of even the humblest repast and is merely like 
a distributor. Therefore, if his joy is thus, you can draw an analogy with the 
sacred meanings of love and results of mercy that pertain to the Merciful and 
Compassionate One, which we are powerless to express. For He causes men, 
jinn, and animals to journey in the seas of space, and to board the mighty 
earth, which is a dominical ship. Then, loading the table of the face of the 
earth with innumerable varieties of foods, He invites all living creatures to 
the feast, which is a sort of light snack or appetizer. For besides this, He will 
make each of every sort of perfect delight a table laden with bounties in a 
permanent and everlasting realm. He will inaugurate an unending and com-
prehensive  banquet  of  innumerable  pleasures  and  subtle  wonders,  which 
will be true food for His countless and endlessly needy and yearning slaves.

THIRTY-SECOND WORD – SECOND STOPPING-PLACE

707

And, for example, a skilful and practised craftsman who likes to display 
his ingenuity, after inventing an object like a gramophone which plays with-
out records, will set it up, try it out and then show it off. If it gives the desired 
and expected results perfectly, how proud will its inventor feel, how pleased 
and gratiﬁed will he be. He will say to himself: “ May Allah bless this! ”

And so, if an insigniﬁcant man is so pleased with the smooth working of 
a gramophone and with his craftsmanship which is only superﬁcial, for in 
reality he creates nothing, then how should the All-Glorious Maker be? For 
He  created  the  mighty  universe  as  an  orchestra  and  gramophone,  and  He 
made the earth, and all the animate creatures on it, and among animate crea-
tures especially man. And man’s head He created in such a fashion that it is a 
dominical gramophone and divine orchestra so that science and philosophy 
are struck with wonderment at the art and craftsmanship displayed in it.

Thus, all these beings show all the results desired of them to the utmost 
degree and in the best possible way. They are completely obedient to the 
commands that give them existence, which are described by the creatures’ 
particular worship and gloriﬁcation and their appointed salutations to Allah. 
The pride, pleasure and joy together with the sacred meanings and pure qual-
ities, which we are unable to describe, that are obtained from these and from 
the attainment of the dominical aims sought from the beings, are so exalted 
and holy that if all the minds of humankind were to unite and become one 
mind, it would still be unable to reach or comprehend their substance.

And  another  example.  What  pleasure  and  enjoyment  a  just  ruler  who 
loves to enforce justice and right receives from granting the oppressed their  
rights  and  receiving  their  thanks  and  from  punishing  the  wrongdoers  and 
taking revenge for the oppressed. You can draw an analogy with the sacred 
meanings  pertaining  to  the  Absolutely  Wise  One,  the  Truly  Just  One,  the 
All-Compelling  and  Glorious  One,  which  arise  from  establishing  justice, 
and not only for men and jinn, but for all creatures.

That is to say, the sacred meanings arising from bestowing the right of 
existence and the right of life on everything, from protecting existence and 
life from aggressors, and from arresting and restraining those ghastly crea-
tures  from  their  aggression;  and  that  arise  especially  from  the  judgement 
of men and jinn at the Great Gathering in the realm of the hereafter. And 
besides this, the sacred meanings arising from the greatest manifestation of 
justice and wisdom that is apparent in animate creatures.

Thus, as may be seen from these three examples, a great many degrees 
of loveliness, beauty, grace, and perfection are present in all the thousand

and one divine names, just as there are a great many degrees of love, pride, 
glory, and grandeur. 

It is because of this that the elevated and authoritative saints who mani-
fested the name of Loving One said: “ Love is the very leaven of the uni-
verse. It is through love that all beings are in motion. It is from love that the 
laws of attraction, afﬁnity, and ecstasy present in all beings spring. ” One of 
them wrote the following:

That is to say, everyone receives the manifestation of divine love and is 
intoxicated in accordance with his capacity. It is well-known that every heart 
has affection for someone who bestows kindnesses on it, and that it loves 
true perfection and is enamoured of noble beauty. And the heart loves even 
more one who bestows kindnesses, not only on itself, but also on those it 
loves and feels compassion for.

(cid:215)َ(cid:300)

And so, as we explained before, may it not be understood from the fol-
lowing  just  how  deserving  of  love  and  passion  is  the  All-Beauteous  and 
Glorious One, the All-Perfect Beloved One, and how intoxicated and giddy 
is the whole universe with love of Him? For He is named with a thousand 
names  each  of  which  is  the  source  of  thousands  of  perfections  and  the  
means for thousands of degrees of beauty. And through His bounties, in all 
the names are thousands of treasuries containing bounties, and He makes all 
those beings we love happy.

It is because of this mystery that the saints who manifested the name of 
Loving One declared: “ We do not want Paradise. One ﬂash of the divine 
love will sufﬁce us for ever. ”

It is also because of this that as is recorded in the Hadith: “ A minute’s 
vision of the divine beauteousness in Paradise will far surpass all its other 
delights. ” 1

Thus, these endless perfections of love occur only through the All-Glo-
rious  One’s  names  and  His  creatures  within  the  sphere  of  His  unity  and

oneness. That is to say, those perfections that are imagined to exist outside 
that sphere are not perfections at all.

The Fifth Sign

The Fifth Sign: The Fifth Sign consists of ﬁve points.
F i r s t   P o i n t :  The representative of the people of misguidance said next: 
“ The world is execrated in your Hadiths  1 and called ‘carrion.’  2 Also, all 
the saints and people of truth have contempt for the world, they say that it is 
pernicious and unclean. Whereas, you show it to be the means and proof of 
all divine perfections and speak of it rapturously. ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  The world has three faces.
I t s   F i r s t   F a c e  looks to Allah Almighty’s names; it displays their impress. 
It is a mirror to them, reﬂecting their meanings. This face of the world con-
sists of innumerable letters or missives describing the Eternally Besought 
One. This face is utterly beautiful and is worthy of love, not loathing.

I t s   S e c o n d   F a c e  looks to the hereafter. It is the seedbed of the hereafter 
and arable ﬁeld for Paradise. It is the ﬂower bed of mercy. 3 This face is also 
beautiful like the ﬁrst one and is deserving of love not contempt.

I t s   T h i r d   F a c e  looks to man’s base appetites. It is a veil of neglect and a 
plaything for satisfying the desires of the worldly. This face is ugly because 
it  is  transient  and  mortal;  it  is  full  of  pain  and  it  deceives.  The  contempt 
described in the Hadith and the loathing of the people of truth, then, is for 
this face.

The  importance  and  approbation  which  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  demon-
strates towards the universe and all beings is towards the ﬁrst two faces. It  
is the ﬁrst two faces of the world that the Companions of the Prophet ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) and other people of Allah seek.

There are four classes of people who have contempt for the world.
T h e   F i r s t :  Those who seek knowledge of Allah. They have contempt for 

it because it is a barrier to knowledge, love, and worship of Allah.

T h e   S e c o n d :  Those who look to the hereafter. They see the world as ugly 
either because unavoidable worldly matters prevent them from doing works 
pertaining to the hereafter. Or, due to their elevated degree of belief, they see 
it as ugly in relation to the perfections and beauties of Paradise.

THE WORDS

Indeed,  in  the  same  way  that  a  handsome  man  will  appear  ugly  when 
compared to the Prophet Joseph ( Upon whom be peace ), however valuable 
the qualities of this world, they become as nothing when compared to those 
of Paradise. 

T h e   T h i r d :  These people have contempt for this world because they can-

not obtain it. This contempt arises not from loathing but from love.

T h e   F o u r t h :  These people have contempt for the world because although 
they obtain it, it does not stay, it leaves them. And this vexes them. They 
insult it in order to console themselves and say it is foul. But this arises from 
love of the world, whereas acceptable contempt arises from love of the here-
after and the love that springs from knowledge of Allah.

That is to say, acceptable contempt is of the ﬁrst two kinds. May Allah 

Almighty make us like those people. Amen.

Third Stopping-Place 

(cid:2)(cid:3)

( 17:44 ) o n m l k j

The Third Stopping-Place is the Second Point; it consists of two topics.

First Topic

FIRST TOPIC

According  to  the  meaning  of o n m l k j  everything  has 

numerous aspects that give onto Allah Almighty like windows.

The  realities  of  all  beings  and  of  the  universe  are  based  on  the  divine 
names. Each being’s reality is based on one name or on many. The attributes 
of things and the arts they display are also based on and rely upon a name. 
True natural science is based on the name of All-Wise, true medicine on the 
name of Healer, and geometry on the name of Determiner, and so on. In the 
same way that all the sciences are based on and come to an end in a name, 
the realities of all arts and sciences, and of all the levels of perfected men, 
are based on the divine names. Indeed, one group of the most learned of the 
saints stated that the divine names constitute the true reality of things, while 
the essences of things are only shadows of that reality. They said too that 
even only apparently as many as twenty manifestations and impresses of the 
divine names may be seen on a single living creature. We shall try to make 
this subtle yet vast truth easier to understand by means of a comparison, and 
shall analyze it by passing it through a sieve two or three times as it were. 
However  long  our  discussion,  it  would  still  be  short,  but  one  should  not 
become bored.

When a skilful portraitist or sculptor wishes to paint a picture of a beau-
tiful ﬂower or to sculpt a great beauty belonging to humankind’s fair sex, 
ﬁrstly  he  determines  the  general  shapes  of  those  two  objects  with  a  few 
lines.  He  determines  these  by  ordering  and  adjusting  them,  by  estimating 
and measuring them. And this he does according to rules and limits deﬁned 
by geometry.

711

712

THE WORDS

It is clear that this ordering and measuring is carried out with knowledge 
and wisdom or purpose. That is to say, the acts of ordering and limiting turn 
on the compasses of knowledge and wisdom. In which case, the meanings 
of  knowledge  and  wisdom  govern  behind  the  ordering  and  limiting.  The 
compasses of knowledge and wisdom, then, point to themselves and they 
demonstrate that, within those limits, they have begun the portrayal of small 
particulars like the eyes, ears, nose, leaves, and stamens.

Now we see that the members determined by the motion of those inner 
compasses are taking shape artistically and carefully. Since this is so, the 
one who turns these knowledge - and wisdom - compasses possesses mean-
ings of craftsmanship and care; it is these latter that command and then dis-
play themselves.

It is understood from this that they point to inherent qualities of beauty 
and  adornment.  Since  this  is  so,  what  makes  the  craftsmanship  and  care 
function is the will to beautify and the intention to decorate. In which case, 
it is at their command that the artist begins to adorn and illuminate. He gives 
a  smiling  and  living  form  to  the  statue  and  ﬂower.  And  what  makes  this 
meaning of beautifying and illuminating function is surely the meaning of 
favouring and muniﬁcence.

Yes, these two meanings govern him to such a degree that, quite simply, 
the ﬂower is an embodied favour, and the statue, embodied muniﬁcence. So 
now it is the meanings of making loved and known that impel the meanings 
of favouring and muniﬁcence and make them work. That is, behind the latter 
two meanings, the meanings of making himself known through his art and 
making people love him govern.

This making loved and known, without a doubt arise from an inclination 
towards being merciful and the will to bestow bounties. So, since mercy and 
the  will  to  bestow  bounties  are  governing  behind  them,  he  will  adorn  the 
statue with all sorts of bounties and also bestow the form of the ﬂower as a 
present. Thus, he ﬁlls the statue’s hands and pockets with precious bounties 
and bestows the form of the ﬂower as jewels. That is to say, what makes his 
mercy and will to bestow function is a feeling of gentleness and pity. That is, 
the meaning of pity and gentleness impels the mercy and bounty.

Furthermore, what impels and makes manifest the meaning of pity and 
gentleness within that person, who is self-sufﬁcient and needs no one, are 
the meanings of beauty and perfection. These desire to be manifested. And 
as for love and mercy, which are the sweetest and most delightful parts of 

THIRTY-SECOND WORD – THIRD STOPPING-PLACE

713

that beauty, they desire to be seen in the mirror of art and to see themselves 
through the eyes of yearning admirers.

That is to say, since beauty and perfection are loved for themselves, they 
love themselves above everything. They are also both loveliness and love. 
The  union  of  beauty  and  love  stems  from  this  point.  Since  beauty  loves 
itself, it desires to see itself in mirrors. Thus all the lovable bounties  and 
beautiful  fruits  which  were  set  on  the  statue  and  on  the  picture  bear  the 
ﬂashes, each according to its capacity, of that meaning of beauty. They dis-
play those ﬂashes both to the owner of the beauty and to others.

In exactly the same way, the All-Wise Maker delimits, orders and gives 
determined  proportions  and  shapes  to  all  things,  particular  and  universal, 
through  the  manifestation  of  His  names;  to  Paradise  and  this  world,  the 
heavens and the earth, plants and animals, men and jinn, angels and spirit 
beings. By doing this, He causes them to recite His names of Determiner, 
Orderer, and Giver of Form.

He determines the limits of their general shapes in such a manner that He 
displays His names of All-Knowing and All-Wise. Then, through the deﬁni-
tion of knowledge and wisdom, He begins to form them within those limits. 
He does this in such a way that He displays the meanings of craftsmanship 
and care and His names of Maker and Muniﬁcent.

Next, with the miraculous hand of art and the brush of muniﬁcence He 
gives  the  colours  of  beauty  and  adornment  to  the  members  of  that  form, 
whether a single human being or a single ﬂower, like the eyes, ears, leaves, 
and stamens. If it is the earth, He gives the colours of beauty and adornment 
to its minerals, plants and animals. If it is Paradise, He gives the colours of 
beauty and adornment to its gardens, palaces, and houris. And so on. You 
can make analogies for the rest, too.

Furthermore, He adorns and illuminates in such a fashion that the mean-
ings of favouring and muniﬁcence are predominant in those objects. They 
govern to a degree where those adorned beings, those illuminated artefacts, 
become like embodied favours and incarnate muniﬁcence. They mention the 
names of Gracious and Muniﬁcent.

Next, what impels the favouring and muniﬁcence to manifest are clearly 
the actions of making loved and known. That is, the qualities of making Him-
self loved by animate creatures and known by conscious ones. They cause 
animate and conscious beings to recite the names of Loving and Known One 
behind the names of Gracious and Muniﬁcent, and for this recitation, which 
is performed by the very mode of their beings, to be heard.

714

THE WORDS

Then, embellishing those adorned and beautiful creatures with delicious 
fruits  and  lovable  results,  He  turns  from  adorning  to  bestowing  bounties, 
from graciousness to compassionateness. He causes them to recite the names 
of Bestower and Compassionate and displays the manifestation of those two 
names behind the outer veils.

Next, what impels that One, Who is absolutely without need, to manifest 
these names of Compassionate and Muniﬁcent are the qualities of  mercy 
and gentleness, which display the names of Gentle and Merciful and cause 
them to be recited.

And what impels the meanings of mercifulness and gentleness to mani-
fest are doubtless, an essential beauty and perfection which desire to become 
evident;  they  cause  the  name  of  Beautiful,  and  the  names  of  Loving  and 
Compassionate, which are within the name of Beautiful, to be recited. For 
beauty is loved for itself. Beauty and one possessing beauty love themselves. 
Moreover, it is both loveliness and love.

Perfection, also, is loved for itself; no other cause is necessary. It is both 
lover and beloved. Since a beauty that is at the utmost degree of perfection 
and a perfection that is at the utmost degree of beauty are loved and are wor-
thy of love to the utmost degree, most certainly will they desire to see and 
to exhibit themselves through displaying their ﬂashes and manifestations in 
mirrors, in accordance with the capacity of the mirrors.

That  is  to  say,  the  beauty  and  perfection  essential  to  the  All-Glorious 
Maker,  the  All-Wise  One  of  Beauty,  the  All-Powerful  One  of  Perfection, 
require the qualities of mercy and gentleness, and impel the names of Merci-
ful and Gentle to be manifested.

As for mercy and gentleness, through displaying compassion and bounty, 
they impel the manifestation of the names of Compassionate and Bestower.
And  compassionateness  and  bestowal  require  the  qualities  of  making 
known  and  loved  and  impel  the  names  of  Loving  and  Known  One  to  be 
manifested.

Making known and loved impel the meanings of favouring and muniﬁ-
cence and display them on some of the facets of those artefacts; they cause 
the names of Gracious and Muniﬁcent to be recited amongst them.

As for the qualities of graciousness and muniﬁcence, they impel the acts 
of adorning and illuminating. They cause the names of Adorner and Illumi-
ner to be recited by the tongues of the artefacts’ beauty and luminosity.

THIRTY-SECOND WORD – THIRD STOPPING-PLACE

715

And  the  qualities  of  adorning  and  beautifying  require  the  meanings  of 
craftsmanship and care. They cause the names of Maker and Bountiful to be 
recited by the beautiful features of the artefacts.

As for craftsmanship and care, they require knowledge and wisdom, and 
they cause the names of All-Wise and All-Knowing to be recited by their 
well-ordered, wise, and purposeful members.

And knowledge and wisdom require the acts of ordering, forming, and 
shaping. They display the names of Determiner and Giver of Form, causing 
them to be recited by the artefact in its entirety, through its form.

Thus, the All-Glorious Maker has made all His creatures or artefacts in 
such a way that He causes most of them, and especially animate beings, to 
recite  numerous  divine  names.  It  is  as  if  He  has  dressed  each  creature  in 
twenty different shirts, one on top of another or has enfolded them in twenty 
veils, and on each shirt or veil He has inscribed different names.

For  example,  as  was  demonstrated  in  the  comparison,  there  are  many 
pages  in  what  is  only  apparent  in  the  creation  of  a  beautiful  member  of 
humankind’s  fair  sex  or  of  a  beautiful  ﬂower.  From  these  two  small  and 
particular examples you can draw analogies with other large and universal 
creatures.

T h e   F i r s t   P a g e :  It is the state which demonstrates the general shape and 
proportion.  It  mentions  the  names  of  O  Giver  of  Form!  O  Determiner!  O 
Orderer!

T h e   S e c o n d   P a g e :   This  is  the  plain  and  unadorned  state  of  the  human 
being and ﬂower in the comparison, which occurs with the disclosure of the 
forms of all the different members of those two creatures. Many names, like 
All-Knowing and All-Wise, for example, are written on this page.

T h e   T h i r d   P a g e :  Through bestowing a different beauty and adornment 
on all the different members of those two creatures, many names like Maker 
and Designer, for example, are written on this page.

T h e   F o u r t h   P a g e :   Such  beauty  and  adornment  are  given  to  those  two 
artefacts  it  is  as  though  they  have  become  embodied  favours  and  muniﬁ-
cence. This page mentions and recites numerous names, like for example, O 
Gracious One! O Muniﬁcent One!

T h e   F i f t h   P a g e :   Through  attaching  delicious  fruits  to  the  ﬂower  and 
lovable  children  and  a  ﬁne  character  to  the  beautiful  woman,  this  page 
recites names like O Loving One! O Compassionate One! O Bestower of 
Bounties!

716

THE WORDS

T h e   S i x t h   P a g e :   On  this  page  of  bestowal  and  bounties,  names  like  O 

Merciful One! O Gentle One! are recited. 

T h e   S e v e n t h   P a g e :  Flashes of such beauty are apparent in these bounties 
and results that they are worthy of a sincere gratitude and pure love which 
have been kneaded with true desire and compassion. On this page, the names 
of O Beauteous One of Perfection! O Perfect One of Beauty! are inscribed 
and recited.

Thus,  if  the  beautiful  ﬂower  and  human  being  display  this  number  of 
names, and that only in material and apparent form, you can conclude what 
exalted  and  universal  names  all  ﬂowers  and  animate  creatures,  as  well  as 
vast, universal beings, cause to be recited.

You  can  also  conclude  how  many  luminous,  sacred  names,  like  Ever- 
Living and Self-Subsistent One, and Giver of Life, man recites and causes 
to be recited by reason of his spirit, heart, mind, and through the pages of life 
and other subtle qualities.

Thus, Paradise is a ﬂower. The company of houris is also a ﬂower. The 
face of the earth is a ﬂower. The spring is a ﬂower. The heavens are a ﬂower, 
while the stars are their gilded embroideries. And the sun is a ﬂower, while 
the seven colours in its light are the ﬂower’s embroidered colours.

The universe is a beautiful, huge human being, in the same way that each 
human being is a miniature universe. The company of houris, the assembly 
of spirit beings, the realm of angels, the congregation of jinn, and human-
kind, have all been formed, ordered, and created as if they were beautiful 
individuals. Just as they all display the Beauteous Maker’s names through 
their  universality,  as  does  each  individual  singly,  so  are  they  all  different 
mirrors to His beauty and perfection, mercy and love. All are truthful wit-
nesses to His inﬁnite beauty and perfection, mercy and love. All are signs 
and tokens of that beauty and perfection, mercy and love.

Thus, this inﬁnite number of different sorts of perfections occurs within 
the sphere of divine unity and oneness. That is to say, what are imagined to 
be perfections outside that sphere are not perfections at all. 

Understand  therefore  that  the  reality  of  beings  is  based  on  and  relies 
on the divine names; rather, that their true realities are the manifestations 
of those names; and that everything mentions and gloriﬁes its Maker with 
numerous tongues in numerous ways.

And understand one meaning of the verse:

The Second Point
of the Second Topic 

When  the  representative  of  the  people  of  misguidance  could  ﬁnd  no 
support or basis on which to build his misguidance and was thus defeated 
in argument, he said the following:

“ I consider happiness in this world and life’s pleasures, and the progress 
of civilization and perfection of arts as all lying in refusal to think of the 
hereafter and to know Allah, in love of this world, in absolute freedom and 
licence and in relying exclusively on myself. And in so doing I have drawn 
most men onto this path, through the assistance of Satan, and continue to 
do so. ”

The Answer: We say, in the name of the Qur’an: O wretched man! Come 
to your senses! Do not listen to the representative of the people of misguid-
ance. If you do listen to him, your loss will be so great that your intelligence, 
spirit, and heart will shudder even to imagine it. There are two paths in front 
of you.

T h e   F i r s t :  The path of wretchedness laid out in front of you by the rep-

resentative of the people of misguidance.

T h e   S e c o n d :   The  path  of  happiness  deﬁned  for  you  by  the  All-Wise 

Qur’an.

You  will  have  noted  and  understood  numerous  comparisons  between 
these  two  paths  in  the  Words,  particularly  the  Short  Words.  So,  note  and 
understand now one of those thousands of comparisons which is suitable to 
this discussion.

The  path  of  assigning  partners  to  Allah,  misguidance,  dissipation  and 
vice causes man to fall to the lowest degree. Afﬂicted with inﬁnite pains, 
he  is  forced  to  bear  an  inﬁnitely  heavy  load  on  his  weak  and  powerless 
shoulders. For if man does not recognize Allah and place his trust in Him, 
he becomes extremely weak and impotent, needy and impoverished, a suf-
fering, grieving and ephemeral animal, exposed to endless misfortunes. Suf-
fering continuously the pain of separation from all the objects of love and 
attachment, he will ultimately abandon all of his loved ones and go alone to 
the darkness of the grave.

Throughout his life, he struggles vainly, with an extremely limited will, 
slight power, a short lifespan and dull mind, against inﬁnite pains and hopes. 
To no avail, he strives to attain innumerable desires and goals.

Even though he is unable to bear the burden of his own being, he takes 
the load of the vast world onto his wretched shoulders and mind. He suffers 
the torment of Hell before even arriving there.

Indeed, in order to avoid feeling this grievous pain, this awesome spir-
itual  torment,  the  people  of  misguidance  have  recourse  to  a  drunkenness 
that is like a form of stupor and thus are temporarily able to avoid feeling 
their pain. But they do feel it suddenly when they feel close to the grave. 
For whoever is not a true bondsman of Allah Almighty will imagine that he 
owns himself. But with his partial and limited will and his petty power and 
strength, he is unable to administer and control his being in this tempestuous 
world. He sees thousands of different sorts of enemy attacking his life, from 
harmful  microbes  to  earthquakes.  In  an  awesome  state  of  painful  fear  he 
looks towards the door of the grave, that at all times appears dreadful to him.
While in this state, man will also be troubled by the state of the world 
and of mankind, for as a human being he is attached to both. But, he does 
not imagine them to be in the control of One All-Wise, All-Knowing, All-
Powerful, Merciful and Generous, and has attributed them instead to chance 
and to nature. And so, together with his own pains, he suffers also the pains 
of the world and of mankind. Earthquakes, plagues, storms, famine and scar-
city, separation and decease; all of this torments him in the most painful and 
sombre fashion.

But  such  a  man  is  not  worthy  of  pity  and  sympathy,  for  he  himself  is 

responsible for it.

In the Eighth Word is a comparison between two brothers who entered a 
well. One was not content with a refreshing, sweet, reputable, pleasant and 
licit enjoyment and merriment at a splendid feast with pleasant friends in a 
beautiful garden and so drank some ugly, unclean wine in order to obtain 
illicit, impure pleasure. He became drunk and then imagined himself to be 
in some foul place in the middle of winter surrounded by wild beasts, and 
trembling cried out.

But such a man is not worthy of pity, for he imagined his honourable and 
blessed companions to be monsters, and thus insulted them. He also imag-
ined the delicious foods and clean dishes at the feast to be impure and ﬁlthy 
stones  and  began  smashing  them;  and  the  respected  books  and  profound 

720

THE WORDS

writings there to be meaningless and banal designs, and so ripped them up 
and trod on them.

Such a person is not merely unworthy of sympathy, indeed, he deserves 

a good beating.

In exactly the same way, a person who, through incorrect choice and 
the    lunacy  of  misguidance,  is  intoxicated  with  unbelief,  imagines  this 
hospice of the world, which belongs to the All-Wise Maker, to be the play-
thing of chance and natural forces. He fancies the passage of creatures into 
the World of the Unseen, that is in fact renewing the manifestation of the 
divine names, to be execution and annihilation. He supposes the echoes of 
those creatures’ gloriﬁcation of Allah, who are accomplishing their duties 
with the passing of time, to be the lamentations of death and eternal sepa-
ration. He deems the pages of created beings, which are inscriptions of the 
Eternally Besought One, to be meaningless and confused. He imagines the 
door of the grave, which opens onto the world of mercy, to be the entrance 
to the darkness of non-existence. And he deems the appointed hour, which 
is in reality an invitation to join his true friends, to be the onset of separa-
tion from all of them.

Such a person both brings upon himself grievous, ghastly torments, and 
denies, denigrates and insults all beings and Allah’s names and His inscrip-
tions. He is, therefore, not only unworthy of compassion and sympathy but 
also deserving of severe punishment. He is not in any way worthy of pity.

O  wretched  people  of  misguidance  and  dissipation!  What  accomplish-
ment of yours, what art, what perfection, what civilization, what progress, 
can confront this awesome decline, this crushing despair? Where can you 
ﬁnd the true consolation that is the most urgent need of the human spirit?

What nature, what causality, what partner ascribed by you to Allah, what 
discovery, what nationality, what false object of worship, in each of which 
you place so much trust and to which you attribute Allah’s works and His 
sustaining  bounties,  which  of  them  can  deliver  you  from  the  darkness  of 
death that you imagine to be eternal annihilation? Which of them can enable 
you to cross the frontiers of the grave, the boundaries of the Intermediate 
Realm, the marches of the plain of resurrection, the Bridge of Sirat? Or can 
bring about your eternal happiness?

But know that most deﬁnitely you will travel on this path for you cannot 
close the door of the grave. And the traveller on such a path ought to rely 
on one whose control and command embraces all this vast sphere and its 
extensive boundaries.

THIRTY-SECOND WORD – THIRD STOPPING-PLACE

721

O wretched people of misguidance and neglect! In accordance with the 
principle,  the  consequence  of  an  illicit  love  is  suffering  a  merciless  tor-
ment, you are suffering a fully justiﬁed punishment, for you are unlawfully 
employing  your  innate  capacity  for  love,  knowledge,  thanks  and  worship 
that relate properly to Allah Almighty’s essence, attributes and names, on 
your own soul and the life of this world.

You have lavished the love that belongs to Allah Almighty on yourself. 
Your own soul has become your beloved and will cause you endless suffer-
ing: you are not giving true peace to that beloved. You are suffering con-
stantly because you do not hand it over to the Possessor of Absolute Power 
Who is the only true beloved and you do not trust wholly in Him.

You suffer further misfortunes because you give to the world the love 
that  belongs  to  Allah  Almighty’s  names  and  attributes  and  divide  up  the 
works of His art among causes in the world. One group of those innumerable 
beloveds of yours will turn their backs on you and leave you without even 
saying good-bye. Another group will not even recognize you, or if they do, 
they will not love you. Or if they love you, their love will be of no use. You 
will constantly suffer from innumerable separations and farewells without 
hope of return.

This, then, is the essence and true nature of what the people of misguid-
ance call life’s happiness, human perfection, the advantages of civilization, 
and the pleasure of freedom. Dissipation and intoxication are but a veil; they 
temporarily  block  all  feeling.  So,  say,  “ I  spit  on  the  intelligence  of  those 
who follow such a path. ”

But as for the luminous highway of the Qur’an, it cures with the truths 
of belief all the wounds of the people of misguidance. It disperses all the 
gloom and darkness of that ﬁrst path. It closes the door on all misguidance 
and perdition.

It cures man’s weakness, powerlessness, poverty and need with trust in 
One All-Powerful and Compassionate. For, handing over the burden of his 
life and being to His power and mercy instead of loading it on himself, man 
ﬁnds ease and comfort as if he were riding on his own life and soul. The 
Qur’an  states  that  he  is  not  a  rational  animal,  but  a  true  man  and  a  well-
accepted guest of the All-Merciful.

It gently cures man of the wounds inﬂicted on him by the transience of the 
world, the ephemeral nature of things and the love of them, and delivers him 
from the darkness of delusion and fancy. It does this by showing the world 

722

THE WORDS

to be a guesthouse of the All-Merciful, and the beings in it to be mirrors to 
the divine names and ever-fresh inscriptions of the Eternally Besought One.
It shows death and the appointed hour to be the bridge to the Intermediate 
Realm and the prelude to joining and meeting beloved ones already in the 
world of eternity. It thus cures the wounds inﬂicted by the notion of death 
as eternal separation, as held by the people of misguidance. It demonstrates 
that separation is in fact the truest form of meeting.

Further, by establishing that the grave is a door opening onto the world  
of mercy, an abode of happiness, a garden of Paradise, the luminous realm 
of the All-Merciful One, it dispels man’s terror and fear and shows that the 
apparently painful, troublesome and unpleasant journey to the Intermediate 
Realm  is  in  fact  the  most  pleasurable,  enjoyable  and  joyous  of  journeys. 
With the grave, it shuts the dragon’s mouth and opens the door onto a beau-
tiful garden; that is, it shows that the grave is not a dragon’s mouth but is, 
rather, a door opening onto the garden of mercy.

The Qur’an also says to the believer, “ Since you have only partial and 
restricted  choice,  hand  over  your  affairs  to  your  Owner’s  universal  will. 
Since your power is slight, rely on that of the Possessor of Absolute Power. 
Since your life is brief, think of eternal life. Do not fret! There is an unend-
ing life. If your mind is dull, let the sun of the Qur’an shine on you. Look 
with the light of belief, and instead of the ﬁreﬂy of your own mind, all the 
Qur’an’s verses will illumine you like stars.

“ You have innumerable hopes and pains; know, then, that inﬁnite reward 
and limitless mercy await you. You have innumerable desires and aims, so 
do not think of them and become disturbed. This world cannot contain them; 
the proper place for them is another realm, and the one who will grant them 
is one other than yourself. ”

The Qur’an also says, “ O man! You do not own yourself. Indeed, you 
are totally owned by One Whose power is inﬁnite, an All-Compassionate 
One of Glory Whose mercy is inﬁnite. Therefore, do not trouble yourself 
by shouldering the burden of your life, for it is He Who grants you life and 
administers it.

“ Also, the world is not without an owner. So do not be anxious thinking 
of the state of it and load that burden onto your mind, for the world’s Owner 
is All-Wise and All-Knowing. You are a guest so do not be ofﬁcious and 
meddlesome.

“ Furthermore, creatures such as men and animals have not been left to 
their own devices, rather, they are all ofﬁcials with speciﬁc duties. They are 

THIRTY-SECOND WORD – THIRD STOPPING-PLACE

723

watched  over  by  One  All-Wise  and  Compassionate.  Do  not  distress  your 
spirit thinking of their pains and afﬂictions. Do not try to be more sympa-
thetic and kind-hearted than their All-Compassionate Creator.

“ Also, the reins of all those things that are hostile to you, from microbes 
to  plagues,  storms,  famine  and  earthquakes,  are  in  the  hands  of  that  All-
Compassionate All-Wise Being. He is All-Wise and so does nothing in vain. 
He is All-Compassionate, His mercy is superabundant. There is a form of 
grace and favour contained in everything He does. ”

The Qur’an also says, “ This world is indeed ephemeral, nevertheless, it 
produces the necessities for an everlasting world. It is transient and ﬂeet-
ing, but it yields eternal fruits, and displays the manifestations of an Eternal 
Being’s eternal names. Its pleasures are indeed few and its pains many, but 
the favours of the All-Merciful and Compassionate One are everlasting, true 
pleasures. As for the pains of this world, they too yield a sort of pleasure by 
reason of the reward to be had for enduring them.

“ Since the sphere of the licit is sufﬁcient for all the pleasures, delights 
and joys of the spirit, heart and soul, do not approach the sphere of the illicit. 
For one pleasure within that sphere sometimes leads to a thousand pains. It 
will also cause the loss of the All-Merciful One’s favours, which are true and 
lasting pleasures.

“ Furthermore, as described above, illicit pleasure on the path of misguid-
ance causes man to fall to the lowest of the low. Then no civilization, no phi-
losophy can provide a remedy for him, and no human progress or scientiﬁc 
advances can deliver him from that deep, dark pit. Whereas, the All-Wise 
Qur’an elevates man, through belief and good deeds, from the lowest of the 
low to the highest of the high, and demonstrates that it does this with clear 
proofs.  And  it  ﬁlls  in  that  deep  pit  with  rungs  of  inner  development  and 
spiritual progress.

“ Moreover,  it  greatly  facilitates  man’s  long,  stormy  and  troublesome 
journey towards eternity. It shows him the means for traversing a distance of 
a thousand years, or rather of ﬁfty thousand years, in a single day.

“ Also,  by  making  known  the  All-Glorious  One,  the  Monarch  of  Pre-
Eternity and Post-Eternity, it confers on man the position of bondsman, guest 
and ofﬁcial entrusted with speciﬁc duties. And it ensures that he travels with 
the greatest ease both in the guesthouse of this world and in the stages and 
stopping-places of the Intermediate Realm and the hereafter.

“ A loyal ofﬁcial will travel in his monarch’s kingdom and pass through 
the frontiers of each province with ease, journeying by the fastest means, 

724

THE WORDS

such as by aeroplane, ship or train. Similarly, the person who forms a rela-
tion with the Pre-Eternal Monarch through belief and obeys Him through 
good works will pass with the speed of lightning or of Buraq through the 
stages of this guesthouse of the world, the spheres of the Intermediate Realm 
and the world of resurrection and the extensive frontiers of all the realms 
that are beyond the grave, until he attains eternal happiness. ” The Qur’an 
proves this truth decisively and points it out to the puriﬁed and to the saints.
The truth of the Qur’an also says, “ O believer! Do not give your inﬁnite 
capacity for love to your ugly, defective, evil, and for you, harmful instinc-
tual soul. Do not take it as your object of love and its whims as your object of 
worship. Take rather the One Who has bestowed on you that inﬁnite  capac-
ity for love and is Himself worthy of inﬁnite love, and can bestow on you 
inﬁnite bounties. He will also make you inﬁnitely happy in the future, and, 
through His bounties, all those to whom you are attached and whose happi-
ness makes you happy.

“ Take for your object of love and worship One Who possesses inﬁnite 
perfection and a beauty that is inﬁnitely sacred, exalted, transcendent, fault-
less, ﬂawless and unfading. The beauty of His mercy and the mercy of His 
beauty are demonstrated by all the beauties and bounties of Paradise. All of 
His names are inﬁnitely beautiful and in each of them are abundant lights 
of fairness and beauty. His beauty and perfection are indicated and pointed 
to by all the fairness, beauty, virtue and perfection of all lovable and loved 
objects in the cosmos. ”

The Qur’an also says, “ O man! Do not squander your inﬁnite capacity 
to love, which properly belongs to His names and attributes, on other tran-
sient creatures. For the works and creatures of Allah are ephemeral, but the 
beautiful names, whose impress and manifestation may be seen on them, are 
eternal and permanent. And in each of His names and attributes there are 
thousands of degrees of bounty and beauty, perfection and love. Consider 
only the name of All-Merciful: Paradise is a manifestation of it, eternal hap-
piness, a ﬂash of it, and all the sustenance and bounty in the world, a mere 
drop of it. ”

Consider carefully, then, this verse which indicates the true nature of the 
people of misguidance and that of the people of belief, with regard to their 
lives and duties:

 : 9 8 7 * 5 4 3 2 * 0 / . - , + 
(   95:4-6 ) ? > = < ;

THIRTY-SECOND WORD – THIRD STOPPING-PLACE

725

And this verse that indicates their ﬁnal result and outcome:

( 44:29 ) g f e d c 
How  sublimely  and  miraculously  they  express  the  comparison  we  have 
made. Since the truth expressed miraculously and concisely in the ﬁrst verse 
is explained in detail in the Eleventh Word, we refer our readers to that part 
of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  for a discussion of it.

As for the second verse, we shall show, through a brief indication, the 

sublimity of the truth it expresses. It is as follows.

The explicit meaning of the verse is that the heavens and the earth do 
not  weep  when  the  people  of  misguidance  die.  The  implied  meaning  is 
that the heavens and the earth do weep when the people of belief depart 
this world. For the people of misguidance, due to their denial of the duties 
and functions of the heavens and earth, their ignorance of their meaning, 
their  rejection of their value, and their refusal to recognize their Maker, 
are in fact acting insultingly and with hostility toward them. So, of course, 
the heavens and earth will not weep over them, but in fact curse them and 
rejoice at their death.

As for the implied meaning, that the heavens and earth weep at the death 
of the people of belief, this is because the latter know the duties and func-
tions of the heavens and earth, assent to their true realities, and understand, 
through belief, the meanings they express. They say, “ How beautifully they 
have been made, how ﬁnely they are carrying out their duties. ” They respect 
them and assign them their true worth. They love them and the names they 
mirror for the sake of Allah Almighty. It is for this reason that the heavens 
and earth grieve over the death of the people of belief as if weeping.

An Important Question

An Important Question

You say, “ Love is not voluntary. And, as a consequence of innate need, 
I love delicious foods and fruits. I love my father, mother, and children, my 
wife,  and  my  friends  and  companions.  I  love  the  prophets  and  the  saints. 
And I love my life and my youth, the spring, beautiful things and the world. 
How may I not love these things? So how should I rather give all this love 
to Allah Almighty’s essence, attributes and names? What does this mean?

T h e   A n s w e r :  Listen to four points.

First Point

FIRST POINT

For sure, love is not voluntary, but, exercising choice, love’s face may turn 
from one object of love to another. For example, when a beloved displays 

726

THE WORDS

some ugliness or shows that he is a veil or mirror to another beloved who is 
truly worthy of love, then love’s face may be turned from the metaphorical 
to the true beloved.

Second Point

SECOND POINT

We do not tell you not to love the things you enumerated, but rather to 
love them for Allah Almighty’s sake and in the name of His love. For exam-
ple, to love delicious foods and luscious fruits as being the bounty of Allah 
Almighty, the All-Merciful and Compassionate, is to love His names of All-
Merciful and Bestower of Bounties, and, moreover, takes on the meaning of 
thanks. Such love is to seek gain contentedly within the sphere of the licit 
and to eat thoughtfully and with gratitude, which shows that it is not only for 
the sake of the instinctual soul but is in the name of the All-Merciful One.

Furthermore, love and respect for parents, when for the sake of the wis-
dom and mercy that compassionately ﬁtted you out and caused them to bring 
you up with tender care, pertain to Allah Almighty’s love. The sign that this 
love, respect and compassion are for Allah’s sake is that when they grow 
old and are of no more use to you and bring you only trouble and difﬁculty, 
you are even more loving, kind and compassionate towards them. The verse,

( 17:23 ) z y x w v u t s r q p 
summons  children  to  respect  and  be  kind  to  their  parents  in  ﬁve  degrees, 
and demonstrates how important are the rights of parents in the eyes of the 
Qur’an, and how ugly ingratitude towards them.

A  father  desires  only  his  son,  and  no  one  else,  to  be  much  better  than 
himself, however, the son cannot claim any rights over his father in return 
for this. That is to say, there is no inherent cause for dispute between parents 
and child. This is because dispute arises from envy and jealousy and there 
is nothing of this in the father towards his son. Or it arises from the abuse 
of rights and the son has no rights that he can claim against his father. If he 
considers his father to be unjust, he may not rebel against him. That is to say, 
a son who does rebel against his father and cause him pain is a monster, a 
corrupted human being.

And, to love and protect children with perfect compassion and tenderness 
because  they  are  gifts  of  the  All-Compassionate  and  Generous  One  once 
again pertains to Allah. The sign indicating that such love is for Almighty 
Allah’s sake is patience and thankfulness should they die, rather than crying 
out in despair. It is to say, “ He was a lovable little being created and owned 
by my Creator, Who entrusted him to my supervision. Now that His wisdom 

THIRTY-SECOND WORD – THIRD STOPPING-PLACE

727

requires it to be thus, He has taken him from me, taken him to a better place. 
If  I  had  one  apparent  share  in  that  little  creature,  a  thousand  true  shares 

belonged to his Creator. ” It is to submit saying, ِ

ِ(cid:195) ُمﯰﯧُ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا

As for friends and acquaintances, if they are friends of Allah Almighty 
by  reason  of  their  belief  and  good  works,  according  to  the  meaning  of, 
ّ(cid:195)ا يِ(cid:158)  ُ

ّبُ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا 1 that love, too, pertains to Allah.

Furthermore,  love  and  cherish  your  wife  as  a  companionable  and  gra-
cious  gift  of  divine  mercy.  But  do  not  fasten  your  love  to  her  physical 
beauty, which swiftly fades. Rather, woman’s most attractive and agreeable 
beauty is the ﬁneness of character that accompanies the delicacy and reﬁne-
ment peculiar to her. As for her most precious and sweet beauty, it is her 
earnest, sincere, sublime and luminous compassion. This beautiful tender-
ness and ﬁneness of character continues and increases until the end of her 
days. Moreover, that weak and delicate creature’s rights of respect will be 
protected by that love. Otherwise, when her superﬁcial beauty fades the poor 
woman will lose her rights, even when she most needs them.

And to love the prophets and saints as Allah Almighty’s highly esteemed 
bondsmen is to do so for the sake and in the name of Allah Almighty, and 
from that point of view it pertains to Him.

And to love and preserve life as most precious wealth and capital that 
will gain eternal life, and a comprehensive treasury yielding eternal perfec-
tions which Almighty Allah has given to you and to all humanity, and to 
employ it in His service, is, once again, in one respect, love that pertains to 
the True Object of Worship.

Also, to admire, love, and put to proper use the grace and beauty of youth 
as being a ﬁne, sweet and beautiful bounty of Almighty Allah is a sort of 
licit and thankful love.

And to love the spring thoughtfully as being the page of the subtlest and 
most  beautiful  inscriptions  of  Almighty  Allah’s  luminous  names  and  the 
ﬁnely adorned and glittering exhibition of the All-Wise Maker’s antique art 
is to love His names.

And to love this world as being the tillage for the hereafter, 2 as a mirror 
of the divine names and a missive of Allah Almighty, and as a temporary

guesthouse, on condition that the evil-commanding soul does not interfere, 
is to do so for Allah Almighty’s sake.

In Short: Love this world and the creatures in it as pointing to a meaning 
beyond themselves, like a word. Do not love them just for themselves. Say, 
“ How beautifully they are made. ” Do not say, “ How beautiful they are. ” 
Allow no opportunity to other loves to enter into your inner heart, for the 
inner heart is the mirror of the Eternally Besought One and pertains only to 
Him. Say,  َكْ(cid:193)َ(cid:170)ِا اَ(cid:179)ُ(cid:92)ّ
ّ(cid:93)ُ(cid:110) اَ(cid:179)ْ(cid:162)ُزْرا َ

ِرَ(cid:163)ُ(cid:192) اَ(cid:174)  َ

Thus, if in this form, all the loves you have enumerated will give a pain-
free pleasure, and, in one respect, an unending union. Moreover, they will 
increase love of Allah. They are licit loves, and are, furthermore, a sort of 
gratitude which is pure pleasure, and thought, which is pure love.

For example, if a mighty king  1 were to bestow an apple on you, there 
would be two loves for that apple and two pleasures in it. The ﬁrst of these 
is that the apple would be loved because it is an apple, and there would be 
a pleasure peculiar to and to the extent of the apple. This love does not con-
cern the king. On the contrary, the man who puts the apple to his mouth and 
eats it in the king’s presence loves the apple itself and his own soul rather 
than the king. It sometimes happens that the king is not pleased with that 
love which nourishes the instinctual soul; in fact, he detests it. Moreover, 
the pleasure that the apple gives is very limited and passes quickly. After the 
apple is eaten it is gone, only regret remains.

As for the second love, it is for the royal favour that is demonstrated by 
means of the apple. One who holds the apple precious as if it were the sam-
ple and embodiment of a royal favour shows that he loves his king. Moreo-
ver, the pleasure of the fruit, which is a sort of container for the favour, is 
such that it is far greater than the pleasure obtained from a thousand apples. 
This pleasure, then, is the essence of thankfulness. This love is respectful 
love for the king.

In  exactly  the  same  way,  if  all  bounties  and  fruits  are  loved  for  them-
selves, if they are thoughtlessly delighted in only for the physical pleasures 
they yield, that love is merely love of self. Also, those pleasures are transient 
and bring pain. But, if they are loved as favours proceeding from Almighty 
Allah’s mercy and as fruits of His muniﬁcence, and if pleasure is obtained 
from them with good appetite by appreciating the degree of kindness in that 

1.  Once two tribal chiefs entered the presence of a king. They were in exactly the same 

situation as is described here.

muniﬁcence and favour, then it has both the meaning of gratitude and is a 
pain-free pleasure.

Third Point

THIRD POINT

There are levels in the love for Allah Almighty’s names. As we explained 
above, sometimes the names are loved with a love for ﬁnely made objects. 
Sometimes they are loved as being titles of the divine perfections. Some-
times, man is needy and desirous of the names by reason of the comprehen-
siveness of his true nature together with his having endless needs. It is due 
to those needs that he loves.

For example, if someone were to come forward and do a kindness to all 
your relations, and the poor, the weak, and the needy, for all of whom you 
feel sympathy although you are powerless to meet their need for help, how 
that  person’s  favour-granting  title  and  generous  name  would  please  you, 
how you would love that person through that title.

So too, think only of Allah Almighty’s names of All-Merciful and Com-
passionate. They make happy all the believing fathers and forefathers, rela-
tions and friends whom you love and feel sympathy for, in this world by 
means  of  all  kinds  of  bounties,  and  in  Paradise  by  means  of  all  kinds  of 
delights. They cause happiness by showing you in eternal bliss to them, and 
them in eternal bliss to you. So how deserving of being loved is the name of 
All-Merciful and the title of All-Compassionate. You can see for yourself 
just how needy for those two names is the human spirit. And you can under-
stand just how appropriate is the phrase,

You are connected to the world and as a result are afﬂicted by its wretch-
edness, so if you consider carefully, you may understand just how needy and 
desirous is your spirit for the name of All-Wise and for the title of Nurturer. 
For  the  Owner  of  those  names  orders,  regulates  and  sustains  with  perfect 
wisdom the world, which is like a sort of house for you, and the creatures 
within it, which are its familiar furniture and lovable decorations.

And you are altogether connected to other human beings and grieve when 
they die. So, if you consider carefully, you may understand just how needy is 
your spirit for the names of Inheritor and Resurrector, and for the titles Eter-
nal, All-Generous, Giver of Life, and Muniﬁcent. For the Owner of these 
names saves human beings at the time of their death from the darkness of 
non-existence and establishes them in a place far ﬁner than this world.

THE WORDS

Thus, since man’s nature is exalted and his disposition comprehensive, 
he is, by his very nature, needy with thousands of different sorts of needs 
for the innumerable divine names, each of which has many degrees. Inten-
siﬁed need is longing. Intensiﬁed longing is love. And intensiﬁed love is 
passion. As the spirit is perfected, the degrees of love unfold according to 
the degrees of the names. Furthermore, since the names are the titles and 
manifestations of the One of Glory, love of them will be transformed into 
love of the divine essence.

Now, just as an example, we shall explain one of the innumerable degrees 
of the names of All-Just, All-Wise, Truth, and All-Merciful. If you wish to 
see the names of All-Merciful and Compassionate, and Truth within wisdom 
and justice to the utmost extent, consider the following comparison.

Let us suppose there is an army in which there are four hundred different 
sections. The uniforms that each section prefers are different, the provisions 
that please them, the weapons they will carry with ease and the medicines 
to cure their particular ills are all different. Furthermore, rather than being 
separated into squads and companies, they are all intermingled.

If  the  peerless  and  single  king,  then,  out  of  perfect  compassion  and 
solicitude, and wonderful power, miraculous all-embracing knowledge, and 
extraordinary  justice  and  wisdom,  without  confusing  or  forgetting  any  of 
them were himself, in person, without helper, to give all of them their com-
pletely  different  though  appropriate  uniforms,  provisions,  medicines,  and 
weapons, would you not see what a powerful, solicitous, just and generous 
personage that king was. For if there were soldiers from ten nations in one 
battalion, it would be extremely difﬁcult to clothe and equip them all dif-
ferently. They would have to be ﬁtted out in the same way whatever people 
they were from.

Similarly, if you wish to see the manifestation of the names of Truth and 
All-Merciful  and  Compassionate  within  the  justice  and  wisdom  of  Allah 
Almighty,  look  at  the  plant  and  animal  armies  comprising  four  hundred 
thousand magniﬁcent nations with their tents pitched on the face of the earth 
in springtime. For those groups and sections are all one within the other, and 
the uniform of each one is different, and the provisions, weapons, way of 
life, drill and demobilization are all different. Furthermore, they do not have 
the power to provide for those needs or the tongues to ask for those wishes. 
So watch and see the titles of Truth, All-Merciful, Provider, Compassionate, 
and Generous, together with order and equilibrium within the sphere of wis-
dom and justice. See how, without confusing, obscuring or forgetting any of 
them, He sustains, regulates and administers them all.

Could another hand, therefore, interfere in a matter performed with such 
amazing and all-encompassing order and balance? What, apart from the One 
Who is Single and Unique, Absolutely Wise, and Powerful over all things, 
could even stretch out its hand towards this art, this organizing, this sustain-
ing, this administering? What cause could interfere?

Y o u   a s k :  “ So long as they are in the form that the Qur’an commands, 
what are the results and beneﬁts of all my different and various loves? That 
is, my love for food, myself, my wife, parents and children, my friends, the 
saints, the prophets, beautiful things, the spring and this world? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  One would have to write a thick book in order to explain all 
the results. For now only one or two results will be alluded to brieﬂy. Firstly, 
the immediate results in this world will be explained, then those that will 
become apparent in the hereafter will be mentioned.

As was explained above, loves such as those of the people of neglect and 
those attached to this world, that are for the sake of the evil-commanding 
soul,  bring  many  tribulations  and  much  pain  and  suffering  in  this  world. 
While the ease, pleasures and enjoyment they bring are little and few.

For  example,  compassion  becomes  a  painful  calamity  on  account  of 
impotence. Love becomes a calamitous misfortune on account of separation. 
Pleasure becomes a poisoned cup due to its transience. And in the hereafter, 
because they were not for Allah Almighty’s sake, they will either be without 
beneﬁt or will be torment. ( If they were illicit. )

Q u e s t i o n :  How might love for the prophets and saints be without beneﬁt?
T h e   A n s w e r :  In the same way that the love of the Christians for Jesus 
( Upon whom be peace ), and the heretics for ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased 
with him ) remain without beneﬁt. 1 If such love is in the form that the Qur’an 
directs, for Allah Almighty’s sake and in the name of the All-Merciful One’s 
love, then it has favourable results both in this world and in the hereafter.

Now, to return to our subject, the results in this world of your love for 
delicious foods and luscious fruits will be that they are a pain-free bounty 
and a pleasure that is the essence of gratitude.

Your love of your instinctual soul. The result will be pity it, to train it, 
and to prevent harmful desires. Then the soul will not ride you, it will not

THE WORDS

make you a prisoner of its desires, rather, you will ride it. You will drive 
your soul, not to whims and fancies, but to right-guidance.

Your love for your wife. Since it will be built on her being a mine of 
tenderness,  a  gift  of  compassion,  and  on  her  ﬁneness  of  character,  if  you 
have sincere love and affection for her, she too will have earnest love and 
respect for you. As the two of you approach old age these sentiments will 
increase and you will pass your life happily. But if it is otherwise, if it is love 
of a pretty face and for the sake of the instinctual soul, then it will be quickly 
destroyed and so too will good relations.

Your  love  for  your  father  and  mother.  Since  it  will  be  for  Allah 
Almighty’s sake, it will be both worship and the older they grow the more 
your  love  and  respect  for  them  will  increase.  If  you  earnestly  desire  and 
pray, with the noblest of sentiments and manly zeal, that they will live far 
into old age, and even kiss their hands with sincere respect and say, “ Let  me 
gain even more reward on their account ”, it will obtain for you an elevated 
pleasure of the spirit. But if it is otherwise and for the sake of the soul and 
this world, when they grow old and approach the time of becoming a burden 
for you, if you show them, with the most base and despicable sentiment, that 
they are a nuisance and then wish for the deaths of those respected people, 
who were the cause of your life, it will be savage, grievous pain for the spirit.
Your  love  for  your  children.  As  for  love  for  those  lovable,  friendly 
creatures whom Allah Almighty entrusts to your supervision and upbring-
ing, it will be a most happy love, a most happy bounty. Neither shall you 
suffer too much pain at their misfortunes, nor shall you cry out with despair 
at  their  deaths.  As  was  stated  above  you  will  say,  “ Since  their  Creator  is 
both  All-Wise  and  Compassionate,  as  far  as  they  are  concerned,  death  is 
happiness. ” Moreover, concerning yourself, you will think of the merciful-
ness of the One Who gave them to you and you will be saved from the pain 
of separation.

Your love for your friends. Since it is for Allah’s sake, because separa-
tion from those friends, and even their deaths, will not be an obstacle to your 
conversing and your brotherhood, you will beneﬁt from that immaterial love 
and relation of the spirit. And the pleasure of meeting will be permanent. If 
it is not for the sake of Allah, the pleasure of one day’s meeting will result in 
the pain of a hundred days’ separation. 1

1.  One second’s meeting for Allah’s sake is a year. Whereas, if it is for the sake of this 

world, a year is a second.

Your love for the prophets and saints. Since the Intermediate Realm, 
which seems to the people of neglect to be a dark, lonely and desolate place, 
appears  to  you  as  a  stopping-place  illuminated  by  the  presence  of  those 
luminous beings, the fact that you will go there will not induce terror and 
fright, but, on the contrary, an inclination towards it and a feeling of longing; 
it will not drive away the pleasure of worldly life.

But if it is otherwise, if love for the prophets and saints is of the same sort 
as the love of the subscribers to modern culture for their idols and heroes, 
on thinking of the death and disappearance of those perfect human beings 
and of their rotting in the mighty grave known as the past, it will add one 
more sorrow to lives that are already painful. That is to say, each will say to 
himself, “ I too will end up in the grave, which rots even such perfect men. ”
Whereas, when they are seen from the ﬁrst point of view, they are thought 
of with complete ease of mind, for they have discarded the clothes  of their 
bodies in the past and now their dwelling-place is the Intermediate Realm, 
which is the waiting-room for the future. And the graveyard will be seen as 
having a familiarity and friendliness.

Your love for beautiful things. Since it is for the sake of the One Who 
fashioned them, it will take the form of, “ How beautifully they are made. ” 
This love is pleasurable thought and it causes the gaze of beauty-worship-
ping delight to see the more elevated and holy and a thousand times more 
beautiful  treasures  of  the  degrees  of  Allah’s  beauty.  This  love  opens  up 
a  way  to  these  treasures  because  it  transfers  the  eye  from  those  beautiful 
works to the beauty of the divine actions. And it opens a way from them to 
the beauty of the names, and from them to the beauty of the attributes, and 
from them to the One of Glory’s peerless beauty; it opens a way to the heart. 
Thus, if this love is in this form, it is both pleasurable, and it is worship, and 
it is reﬂective thought.

Your love of youth. Since you have loved it as a beautiful bounty of 
Allah  Almighty,  you  have,  of  course,  done  so  in  worship,  you  have  not 
drowned it in dissipation and destroyed it. Since this is the case, the wor-
ship you have gained during your youth is the undying fruit of that tran-
sient state. As you grow older, because you will have obtained the endur-
ing fruits that are the positive aspect of youth, you will have been saved 
from its harm and excesses.

Also, in old age you will see that you have achieved success in perform-
ing more worship, so will be more worthy to receive divine mercy. Unlike 
the people of neglect, you will not feel sadness for the pleasures of youth

that lasted ﬁve or ten years, then wail for ﬁfty years, “ Alas, my youth has

Your love for ﬁnely adorned exhibitions like the spring. Since it is in 
the form of contemplating divine artistry, when the spring ends the pleasure 
of the spectacle does not fade. For the meanings that the spring delivers, like 
a gilded missive, may be contemplated all the time. Both your imagination 
and time are like ﬁlms in the cinema, they both cause the pleasure of that 
contemplation to continue for you, and they renew the spring’s meanings 
and beauties. Your love, therefore, cannot be temporary and full of regret 
and pain. Rather, it will be full of pleasure and enjoyment.

Your love of this world. Since it is in Allah Almighty’s name, the formi-
dable creatures of this world will be like familiar friends for you. Since you 
love it as the tillage for the hereafter, you will be able to ﬁnd in everything 
capital or a fruit that will produce beneﬁts in the hereafter. Neither  will its 
disasters frighten you, nor will its transience and ephemerality trouble you. 
You will pass your sojourn in this guesthouse with the greatest of ease. But 
should you love it as the people of neglect do, then as we have told you a 
hundred times, you will drown and perish in a fruitless love, condemned to 
a depressing, crushing, and suffocating transitoriness.

Thus we have shown only one subtle point out of hundreds from each of 
the loves you enumerated, when they are in the form that the Qur’an directs. 
We indicated too one hundredth of the harm they cause if they are not in 
this way. Now, if you want to hear and understand the results of these loves 
in the eternal realm, in the world of the hereafter, the results to which the 
All-Wise Qur’an points with its clear and distinct verses, then we shall show 
brieﬂy by means of an introduction and nine indications the results and one 
hundredth of the beneﬁts in the hereafter of those various licit loves.

An Introduction

AN  INTRODUCTION:  Allah  Almighty,  with  His  glorious  divinity, 
His beautiful mercy, His mighty dominicality, His generous benevolence, 
His immense power, and His subtle wisdom, has equipped and adorned tiny 
man with many senses and feelings, limbs and systems, members and fac-
ulties,  and  subtle  and  immaterial  aspects  so  that  through  them  He  might 
cause man to perceive, know, taste and recognize the limitless varieties and 
levels  of  His  bounty,  muniﬁcence,  and  mercy;  and  so  that,  through  these 
tools, He might cause man to ponder over, know and love the endless kinds 

THIRTY-SECOND WORD – THIRD STOPPING-PLACE

735

of  manifestations  of  His  thousand  and  one  names.  Just  as  each  of  man’s 
great many members and faculties performs a completely different service 
and worship, so too does each of them have completely different pleasures, 
pains, duties and rewards.

For example, the eye beholds the beauty of forms and the varieties of the 
beautiful miracles of power in the world of things seen. Its duty, taking its 
lesson from these, is gratitude to its Maker. The pleasures and pains peculiar 
to sight are known, there is no need to enlarge upon them.

And, for example, the ear perceives the various sorts of sounds and their 
melodious songs, and the subtle instances of Allah Almighty’s mercy in the 
world of things heard. Its worship, pleasures and rewards are all different.

And,  for  example,  the  sense  of  smell  perceives  the  subtle  instances  of 
mercy  within  the  realm  of  scents.  It  has  a  duty  of  gratitude  and  pleasure 
peculiar to itself. And, of course, it has a reward, too.

And, for example, the sense of taste in the tongue; appreciating all the 
tastes of foods, it performs its duty with a truly diverse thankfulness; and so 
on. All man’s faculties, including his important subtle aspects such as the 
heart, intellect and spirit, have quite distinct duties, pleasures and pains.

Thus,  Allah  Almighty,  Who  possesses  absolute  wisdom,  will  certainly 
give suitable recompense to each one of those faculties, which He employs 
in human beings. Everyone may perceive with his conscience the immediate 
results in this world of those numerous varieties of love, as was explained 
above, and they may be conﬁrmed through experience.

As for the results in the hereafter, their existence and reality have been 
conclusively, through brieﬂy, proved by the decisively clear Twelve Truths 
of the Tenth Word, and by the six self-evident Fundamental Points of the 
Twenty-Ninth  Word.  They  are  also  clearly  demonstrated  in  detail  by  the 
distinct verses and the explanations, allusions, symbols and indications of 
the All-Wise Qur’an, which is, 

 ِم َ

There  is  no  need  to  present  more  extensive  proofs.  In  any  case,  there  are 
further proofs in other Words: in the Second Station of the Twenty-Eighth 
Word, which is about Paradise and is in Arabic, and in the Twenty-Ninth 
Word.

after of licit and thankful love for delicious foods and fruits is again delicious 
food and fruit, but in a form appropriate for Paradise. This licit love desires

those foods and fruits of the hereafter. So much so that when you utter the 
ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا over the fruit you eat in this world, it will be embodied as a 
phrase ِ
fruit of Paradise and presented to you there. Here you eat fruit, while there 

you will eat ِ

ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا

Since you see divine muniﬁcence and the All-Merciful One’s favours in 
bounty and food, as is established by Hadith, the indications of the Qur’an, 
and the requirements of wisdom and mercy, that pleasurable gratitude will 
be given to you in Paradise in the form of a truly delicious food. 1

Second Indication

SECOND  INDICATION:  Licit  love  for  your  instinctual  soul  in  this 
world is not a love built on its good qualities, but one that sees its shortcom-
ings and trains it with a compassion that seeks to perfect it, and that impels it 
towards good. This love results in giving to the soul objects of love worthy 
of it in Paradise.

As is explicitly stated and proved by a great number of verses in the 
Qur’an, when the soul utilises its desires and wishes correctly and employs 
its faculties and senses in the best way in this world, that is, in the way of 
Allah Almighty, as a result of this licit and worshipful love the Absolutely  
Generous One will bestow on it houris in Paradise, the everlasting realm. 
He will clothe these houris in seventy varieties of the ﬁnery of Paradise. 
He will adorn their beings with seventy kinds of beauty that will carress 
and gratify all the senses of the soul. Each houri will be like a miniature 
animated Paradise.

Furthermore, your love of youth in this world, that is, the result of expend-
ing the power of youth in worship, will be eternal youth in the realm of bliss.

Third Indication

THIRD INDICATION: Licit love for your wife in this world is sincere 
love in consequence of her delicate tenderness, ﬁne virtues and good char-
acter, together with your protecting her from being recalcitrant and sinning. 
The Absolutely Merciful One has promised that as a result of this licit love, 
your wife shall be given to you as an eternal wife in the hereafter, the realm 
of bliss. She will be in a form more beautifully adorned and attractive than 
the houris. You will relate to one another in delight your former adventures 
in the world, bringing to mind old memories. She will be an intimate, gra-
cious  and  eternal  friend,  who  loves  and  is  beloved.  And,  most  certainly, 
whatever He promises shall deﬁnitely be given.

FOURTH INDICATION: The result of licit love for parents and chil-
dren is this. According to the Qur’an, the Most Merciful of the Merciful will 
bestow on that happy family, even though their stations may be quite dif-
ferent, the pure pleasure of each other’s company in the everlasting realm.

He will return children who die before reaching the age of ﬁfteen years, 
that  is,  the  age  of  puberty,  once  more  to  the  embrace  of  their  fathers  and 
mothers,  in  a  manner  appropriate  to  Paradise.  They  will  be  beautifully 
adorned and lovable, in the form of the children of Paradise, who are known 
as ( 76:19 ) $ # He will gratify their child-cherishing sentiments and 
will give them that pleasure and delight eternally. Since those children had 
not reached the age of responsibility, they will remain eternally as lovable, 
sweet children.

Every pleasurable thing in this world will be found in its highest form 
in Paradise. Some people surmise that since Paradise is not appropriate for 
reproduction, there will be none of this cherishing of children, which is so 
sweet, that is, the pleasure of loving and carressing them. But it will be there 
too and in the most delightful and sweet form. 1 This then is good news for 
those whose children die before puberty.

Fifth Indication

FIFTH INDICATION: The result of love for righteous friends in this 
world, according to the decree of, “ Love for Allah’s sake ” 2 is, as the Qur’an 
states, ( 15:47 ) º ¹ ¸ Allah Almighty will seat them on the chairs 
of Heaven facing one another. He will cause them to meet with their friends, 
pleasantly, agreeably and sweetly. They will enjoy themselves recounting 
their old memories and adventures in this world, with a pure love and com-
panionship that will not be subject to separation.

Sixth Indication

SIXTH  INDICATION:  The  result  of  love  for  the  prophets  and  saints  is 
as the Qur’an explains. That is, it will be both to benefit in the Intermediate 
World and at the resurrection from the intercession of the prophets and saints, 
and also to proﬁt abundantly, through that love, from the station and blessings 
ّبَ(cid:110)َا  ْنَ(cid:174) َعَ(cid:174) ُءْر َ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)َا  4 
that  beﬁt  them.  3  Indeed,  according  to  the  meaning  of  َ
an ordinary man may approach the highest station by following an exalted 
person whom he loves.

Seventh Indication

THE WORDS

SEVENTH INDICATION: The result of licit love for beautiful things 
and the spring. That is, to see with the eye of, “ how beautifully they have 
been made, ” and to love the beauty and order of the acts, which lie behind 
those works of art. To love the manifestations of the beautiful names, which 
lie behind the order and harmony of the actions, and to love the manifesta-
tions of the attributes behind those beautiful names. And so on.

The  result  will  be  to  see  in  Paradise,  the  everlasting  realm,  the  mani-
festation of the names, and the beauty and attributes within the names, in a 
form a thousand times more beautiful than the beautiful creatures to be seen 
here.  More  than  this  even,  Imam-i  Rabbani  ( May  Allah  be  pleased  with 
him ) said, “ The subtle exquisiteness of Paradise will be the similitude of the 
manifestation of Allah’s names. ” Just think of it!

Eighth Indication

EIGHTH INDICATION: The result in the hereafter of thoughtful love 
in this world for the two beautiful faces of the world, which are the tillage 
for the hereafter 1 and the mirror of the divine names. An everlasting Para-
dise will be given  2 that is as large as the world but is not ephemeral and 
transient like this world. And the names, only pale shadows of which are  
shown in this world, will be displayed in the mirror of Paradise in a most 
brilliant form.

Moreover, the result of loving the world as being the tillage of the here-
after is as follows. When the world is seen thus, that is, as a seedbed or small 
place of cultivation that produces only shoots, it results in a Paradise where 
those shoots burgeon and blossom. For in this world man’s senses and facul-
ties are tiny shoots and in Paradise they will unfold in the most perfect form. 
And his abilities, which are here like tiny seeds, will be given to him there 
in a form that will blossom with all sorts of delights and perfections. This is 
proved by the indications of the Qur’an and by Hadith, 3 and is necessitated 
by mercy and wisdom.

For it is not blameworthy love of the world, which is the source of every 
fault, 4 but love of its two faces that look to Allah’s names and to the hereaf-
ter, and is for the sake of the names and the hereafter. It is to cultivate those 
faces  with  thoughtful  worship,  as  if  taking  the  whole  world  as  the  means

for worship. It is, therefore, most deﬁnitely necessitated by mercy and wis-
dom that a reward should be given that is as large as the world. And, one 
who through love of the hereafter, has loved its seedbed, 1 and through love 
of Almighty Allah, has loved the mirror of His names, will most certainly 
desire a beloved like the world, and that too will be a Paradise as great as 
the world.

Q u e s t i o n :  What is the use of such a vast and empty Paradise?
A n s w e r :  If it were possible for you to travel with speed of imagination 
round all the regions of the earth and most of the stars, you would be able 
to say, “ The whole universe is mine. ” The fact that the angels, other human 
beings and the animals share the world with you would not quash your claim. 
In the same way, if Paradise is thus full, you would be able to say, “ Paradise 
is mine. ” The meaning of the Hadith, “ A ﬁve hundred year Paradise will 
be given to some of those in Paradise, ” 2 has been explained in the Twenty-
Eighth Word and the Twentieth Flash, the Treatise on Sincerity.

Ninth Indication

NINTH  INDICATION:  The  result  of  belief  and  love  of  Allah.  It  is 
proved  by  the  consensus  of  the  people  of  unveiling  and  veriﬁcation,  by  
Hadiths,  3  and  by  the  Qur’an  that  a  thousand  years  of  happy  life  in  this 
world is not worth one hour of life in Paradise, and that a thousand years of 
heavenly life is not worth one hour’s vision and contemplation of the All-
Glorious One, 4 Who possesses incomparable beauty and perfection.

Everyone may perceive in his conscience a great longing for the vision 
of a personage famous for his magniﬁcence and perfection, like the Prophet 
Solomon ( Upon whom be peace ), and a great yearning to behold a person-
age distinguished by his beauty, like the Prophet Joseph ( Upon whom be 
peace ).  So  if  you  can,  compare  how  longed-for,  sought  after,  and  desire-
arousing is the vision of the Being one manifestation of Whose beauty and

4.  Included in the Hadith is the following: “ That vision far surpasses all the other 
delights of Paradise, so much so that it causes them to be forgotten. And after the vision, 
the loveliness and beauty of those who experience it will have increased to such a degree 
that when they return, it will be only with difﬁculty and scrutiny that their families in their 
mansions will recognize them. ” *

It is not I who speaks in any of the Words; it is reality in the name of

Q u e s t i o n :   We  would  like  a  concise  explanation  of  the  ways  man  and 
the universe, that is, the microcosm and the macrocosm, point to the nec-
essary  existence  and  unity  of  Allah  and  His  dominical  attributes  and 
functions,  which  the  two  parts  of  the  above  verse  denote.  For  the  unbe-
lievers  have  gone  too  far,  they  are  saying:  “ For  how  long  shall  we  say: 
ٌر(cid:192) ۪دَ(cid:162)  ٍء ْىَ(cid:130)  ّ

ِلﯭﯦ ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) َوُ(cid:182)َو  and have to raise our hands? ”

A n s w e r :  The thirty-three Words that have been written form thirty-three 
drops  from  the  ocean  of  this  verse  and  from  the  seas  of  truth  which ﬂow 
from it. If you look at them, you will ﬁnd your answer. What we say now is 
only a sort of hint to the sprinkling of a single drop from the ocean.

For example, if a wonder-worker wants to build a splendid palace, he ﬁrst 
of all sets the foundations in a wise and regular fashion, and plans them in 
a way suitable to their future purpose and results. Then he skilfully divides 

742

THIRTY-THIRD WORD

743

them into sections and apartments. Next, he orders and arranges the apart-
ments, and decorates them with tapestries, then illuminates them with elec-
tric lights. Then, in order to renew his ingenious works and favours in that 
magniﬁcent and adorned palace, he makes fresh creations and new changes 
and transformations in every level of it. And then he instals a telephone in 
every apartment connected to his own abode, and opens up a window from 
each, so that his may be seen.

In just the same way, ( 16:60 )  j  i  h the Peerless Creator, Who 
is named with a thousand and one sacred names such as All-Glorious Maker, 
All-Wise  Sovereign,  All-Just  Arbiter,  willed  the  creation  of  the  palace  of 
the universe and tree of the cosmos, which forms the macrocosm. He set the 
foundations of the palace, the tree, in six days in accordance with the prin-
ciples of wisdom and laws of His pre-eternal knowledge. Then He divided 
and formed it into the higher and lower levels and branches through the prin-
ciples of divine determining and decree. Then He set in order every group 
and level of creature in accordance with the principles of art and providence. 
Next,  He  adorned  everything,  each  world,  in  an  appropriate  manner,  like 
the heavens with the stars and the earth with ﬂowers. Then He manifested 
and made luminous His names within the arena of those universal laws and 
general principles, and then in a special way sent to the assistance of indi-
viduals  crying  out  at  the  constraint  of  those  universal  laws  His  names  of 
Most Merciful and All-Compassionate. That is to say, within those univer-
sal and general principles He has special favours, special succour, special 
manifestations, so that everything may seek help from Him and look to Him 
at all times for every need. Then from every apartment, every level, every 
world, every realm of being, every individual, from everything, He opened 
up windows which would show Himself, that is, make known His existence 
and unity. He left a telephone in every heart.

For now we shall not attempt to discuss those innumerable windows, 
which is anyway beyond our power. Referring them to the all-encompass-
ing  knowledge  of  Allah,  we  shall  only  point  out  in  a  concise  and  brief 
manner thirty-three Windows – since it corresponds to the blessed number 
of the  t e s b i h a t  following the prescribed prayers, and for a more detailed 
explanation of this, which forms the Thirty-Third Letter and Thirty-Third 
Word and consists of gleams from verses of the Qur’an, we refer readers 
to the rest of the Words.

744

THE WORDS

First Window 
If  we  look,  we  see  that  all  things  and  especially  living  creatures  have 
numerous different needs and numerous different wants. And those wants 
and needs are provided for them at the appropriate time, in unexpected ways, 
from places they do not know and their hands cannot reach; succour comes 
to  them.  But  the  power  of  these  needy  beings  is  insufﬁcient  for  even  the 
smallest of those endless things they wish for; they cannot meet their  needs. 
Consider yourself: how many things are you in need of that your hands can-
not reach, such as your external and inner senses and their needs? Compare 
all other living creatures with yourself. See, just as singly they testify to the 
Necessary Existence and point to His unity, so in their totality – as sunlight 
shows the sun – they show to the reason a Necessarily Existent One behind 
the veil of the Unseen, a Single One of Unity, among such titles as Most 
Generous, All-Compassionate, Nurturer, and Disposer.

O  ignorant  unbeliever  and  dissolute  heedless  one!  With  what  can  you 
explain  this  wise,  percipient,  compassionate  activity?  Deaf  nature?  Blind 
force?  Senseless  chance?  Can  you  explain  it  through  impotent,  lifeless 
causes?

Second Window 
While in their existence and individuality, things are in a hesitant, bewil-
dered, and shapeless form among innumerable possible ways, they are sud-
denly given a most well-ordered and wise aspect of individuality. For exam-
ple, every human being has on his face characteristics which differentiate 
him from all his fellow humans, and it is equipped with utter wisdom with 
external and inner senses. This proves that the face is a brilliant stamp of 
divine oneness. And just as each face testiﬁes in a hundred ways to the exist-
ence of an All-Wise Maker and points to His unity, so too the stamp which 
all faces display in their totality shows to the mind’s eye a seal peculiar to 
the Creator of all things.

O denier! To what workshop can you refer these stamps which can in no 
way be imitated, and the stamp of Eternal Besoughtedness which is on the 
totality?

THIRTY-THIRD WORD

745

Third Window 
The army of all the various species of animals and plants on the face of 
the earth consists of four hundred thousand different groups. 1 Observedly, 
their being managed and raised with perfect balance and order together with 
their  all-different  sustenance,  forms,  weapons,  uniforms,  instructions,  and 
demobilizations with nothing being forgotten and none of them being  con-
fused, is a stamp of the Single One of Unity as brilliant as the sun which 
can in no way be doubted. Who other than one possessing boundless power, 
all-encompassing  knowledge,  and  inﬁnite  wisdom  could  have  any  part  in 
this administration, which is wondrous to the utmost degree. For if a person 
incapable of administering and raising all together these species and nations, 
which are one within the other, interferes with any of them, he will throw the 
lot into disorder. Whereas according to the meaning of,

( 67:3 ) K J I H G F
there is no sign of confusion. That means not even a ﬁnger can interfere.

Fourth Window 
This is the acceptability of the supplications offered through the tongue 
of latent ability by all seeds, and through the tongue of innate need by all 
animals, and through the tongue of exigency by the desperate.

Yes, just as all these innumerable supplications are observedly accepted 
and responded to, so both do they singly testify to and point to the neces-
sary existence and unity, and in large measure do they in their entirety self-
evidently indicate and point to an All-Compassionate and Generous Creator, 
an Answerer of Prayer.

Fifth Window 
We see that things and particularly living beings come into existence of a 
sudden, instantaneously. But, while things that appear suddenly out of a sim-
ple substance should be simple, formless, and without art, they are created 
with  an  art  and  beauty  requiring  much  skill  and  many  materials,  they  are 
decorated with painstaking embroideries requiring much time, and adorned 
with wonderful arts requiring many tools. Thus, just as each of these instan-
taneous, wondrous arts and beautiful combinations indicates the necessary

the members of the human race from the time of Adam up to the Last Day.

THE WORDS

existence of an All-Wise Creator and the unity of His dominicality, so in 
their totality do they show brilliantly an inﬁnitely Powerful, inﬁnitely Wise 
Necessarily Existent One.

So  now,  O  stupeﬁed  denier!  How  can  you  explain  this?  With  nature, 
which is unconscious, impotent, and ignorant like you? Or do you want to 
make an inﬁnite mistake and call that All-Holy Maker “ nature, ” and on the 
pretext  of  naming  Him  that,  attribute  the  miracles  of  His  power  to  it  and 
perpetrate an impossibility compounded a thousand times over?

  ( 2:164 ) K J I 
This verse both points to the divine existence and unity, and forms a truly 

large window displaying a greatest name.

The gist of the verse is this: all the worlds in the higher and lower lev-
els of the universe show with different tongues a single result, that is, the 
dominicality of a single All-Wise Maker. It is as follows: just as in the heav-
ens – and astronomy even admits to it – extremely regular movements for 
extremely extensive results show the existence, unity, and perfect domini-
cality of an All-Powerful One of Glory, so too on the earth – and geography 
even testiﬁes to it and acknowledges it – orderly changes, like in the seasons, 
for most extensive beneﬁts show the existence and unity and perfect domini-
cality of the same All-Powerful One of Glory.

Also, just as, being given their sustenance with perfect mercy, and being 
clothed in different forms with perfect wisdom, and being decked out with 
all sorts of senses by a perfect dominicality, each of all the animals on the 
land and in the sea again testiﬁes to the existence of the All-Powerful One 
of Glory and indicates His unity, so in their totality do they show on a vast 
scale the tremendousness of His Godhead and the perfection of His domini-
cality. So too, just as each of the systematically structured plants in gardens, 
and the ﬁnely adorned ﬂowers which the plants display, and the well-pro-
portioned fruits which the ﬂowers display, and the embellished embroideries 

THIRTY-THIRD WORD

747

which the fruits display, testiﬁes to the existence of the All-Wise Maker and 
points  to  His  unity,  so  too  in  their  totality  they  show  most  brilliantly  the 
beauty of His mercy and the perfection of His dominicality.

Also, just as the drops of rain sent from the clouds in the sky charged with 
duties for important instances of wisdom and aims and necessary beneﬁts 
and results, again demonstrate to the number of their drops the necessary 
existence and unity and perfect dominicality of the All-Wise Maker; so too 
do  all  the  mountains  on  the  earth  and  the  storing-up  in  them  of  minerals 
with all their different properties for numerous different uses show  with the 
strength and ﬁrmness of a mountain the existence and unity of the All-Wise 
Maker and the perfection of His dominicality.

Also,  just  as,  being  adorned  with  numerous  varieties  of  harmoniously 
formed ﬂowers, the small hills in the plains and among the mountains each 
testiﬁes to the necessary existence of an All-Wise Maker and points to His 
unity, and all together show the majesty of His sovereignty and the perfec-
tion of His dominicality; so the great variety of the orderly shapes of all the 
leaves of the grasses and trees, and all their different stages and states and 
balanced and ecstatic movements again show the necessary existence and 
unity and perfect dominicality of the All-Wise Maker.

Also, just as the regular development at the time of their growth of all 
living  bodies,  and  each  being  equipped  with  all  sorts  of  organs  and  their 
being directed consciously towards numerous different fruits again testify 
to  the  necessary  existence  of  the  All-Wise  Maker  and  indicate  His  unity, 
and in their totality show on a truly vast scale His all-encompassing power, 
and all-embracing wisdom, and the beauty of His art, and the perfection of 
His dominicality; so too souls and spirits being situated in all animal bodies, 
and their being armed in most orderly fashion with numerous sorts of sys-
tems and faculties, and their being sent on numerous different errands with 
perfect wisdom testify to the number of animals, indeed to the number of 
their faculties, to the necessary existence of the All-Wise Maker and point to 
His unity. And in their totality they show most brilliantly the beauty of His 
mercy and the perfection of His dominicality.

Also, just as the inspirations from the Unseen imparted to men’s hearts, 
which make known to them all the sciences and ﬁelds of knowledge and 
truth and teach the animals how to procure their needs, make known the 
existence of an All-Compassionate Sustainer and point to His dominical-
ity; so too, like the eye beams which like rays gather immaterial ﬂowers 
from the garden of the universe, their external and inner senses are keys

to different worlds, and show to the eyes as clearly as the sun the neces-
sary  existence,  unity,  oneness,  and  perfect  dominicality  of  the  All-Wise 
Maker,  the  All-Knowing  Creator,  the  Most  Compassionate  Creator,  the 
All-Generous Provider.

Thus,  from  the  twelve  windows,  the  twelve  aspects,  mentioned  here  a 
vast window opens up that displays with a twelve-coloured light of truth the 
oneness, unity, and perfect dominicality of Allah Almighty .

O unhappy denier! With what can you block up this window which is as 
broad as the globe of the earth, indeed, as its yearly orbit? And with what can 
you extinguish this source of light which shines like the sun? Behind which 
veil of heedlessness can you hide it?

Seventh Window 
The perfect order of the works of art scattered over the face of the uni-
verse, and their perfect proportion and balance, and the perfection of their 
adornment, and the ease in their creation, and their mutual resemblance, and 
their  exhibiting  a  single  nature  demonstrate  on  a  vast  scale  the  necessary 
existence and perfect power and unity of an All-Wise Maker. 

Moreover, just as the creation of innumerable, different, orderly complex 
beings from inanimate and simple elements again testiﬁes, to the number of 
those composite beings, to the All-Wise Maker’s necessary existence and 
points to His unity, so in their totality do those beings demonstrate in truly 
brilliant fashion His unity and the perfection of His power. 

Then the utmost distinguishing and differentiating of beings as they are 
renewed while being assembled and dissolved – that is, during what is called 
the composition of beings – amid the utmost degree of intermingling and 
confusion, for example the distinguishing of the shoots and growth of seeds 
and roots without their being confused in any way despite being all mixed 
up,  and  the  mingled  substances  absorbed  by  trees  being  divided  between 
the leaves, ﬂowers, and fruits, and the nutrients which enter the body as a 
mixture being differentiated and separated out with perfect wisdom and per-
fect balance for the cells of the body, – these again demonstrate the neces-
sary existence and perfect power and unity of the Absolutely Wise One, the 
Absolutely Knowing One, the Absolutely Powerful One. 

Then too the making of the world of minute particles into a boundless 
arable  ﬁeld  and  every  instant  sowing  and  harvesting  it  and  obtaining  the 
fresh  crops  of  different  universes  from  it,  and  those  inanimate,  impotent, 
ignorant particles being made to perform innumerable orderly duties most

consciously, wisely, and capably – this also shows the necessary existence 
of the All-Powerful One of Glory and Maker of Perfection, and His perfect 
power and the grandeur of His sovereignty and His unity and the perfection 
of His dominicality.

Thus  with  these  four  ways  a  large  window  is  opened  onto  knowledge 
of Allah; addressing the reason, it displays the All-Wise Maker on a large 
scale.

Now, you unhappy heedless one! If you do not want to see Him and learn 
of Him in this way, divest yourself of your reason; become an animal, and 
thus be saved!

Eighth Window 
The testimony of all the prophets ( Upon whom be peace ), who among 
humankind possessed luminous spirits, relying on their manifest and evident 
miracles; and the testimony of all the saints, who with their luminous hearts 
are the spiritual poles of mankind, relying on their illuminations and won-
der-working; and testimony of all the puriﬁed scholars, who possess lumi-
nous minds, relying on their researches and veriﬁcations; – the testimony 
of  all  these  to  the  necessary  existence,  unity,  and  perfect  dominicality  of 
the Single One of Unity, the Necessary Existent, the Creator of All Things, 
forms a truly vast and light-ﬁlled window.

O you unfortunate denier! In whom do you place your trust so that you do 
not heed these? Or by closing your eyes in the daytime do you imagine the 
world to be plunged into night?

Ninth Window 
The  universal  worship  in  the  cosmos  self-evidently  demonstrates  an 
Absolute Object of Worship. Yes, the perfect obedience and worship of all 
angels  and  spirit  beings  –  which  is  established  by  the  testimony  of  those 
who have penetrated to the spirit world and the inner dimension of things 
and have met with the angels and spirit beings – and of all living beings self-
evidently performing their duties in perfect order and in worshipful manner, 
and of all inanimate things, such as the elements, self-evidently carrying out 
their duties in perfect submission and veneration, all demonstrate the neces-
sary existence and unity of a True Object of Worship. 

So too the true knowledge of those who know, with the strength of con-
sensus,  and  the  fruitful  thanks  of  those  who  offer  thanks,  and  the  radiant 
gloriﬁcation of those who recite Allah’s names, and the bounty-increasing

exaltations of those who hymn Allah’s praises, and the demonstrative proofs 
and descriptions of divine unity of those who acknowledge it, and the true 
love and passion of the lovers of Allah, and the true will and desire of those 
who seek Him, and the earnest searching and penitence of those who turn 
to Him – all these show the necessary existence, perfect dominicality, and 
unity of the Pre-Eternal All-Worshipped One, the One Who is Known, Men-
tioned, Thanked, Praised, One, Beloved, Desired, and Sought. 

Furthermore, all the acceptable worship of perfected human beings and  
the spiritual radiance and supplications, visions and illuminations resulting 
from their acceptable worship again demonstrate the necessary existence and 
unity and perfect dominicality of that Eternal Being, the Enduring Object of 
Worship. Thus, these three aspects throw open a broad, light-giving window 
onto divine unity.

The  mutual  assistance  and  co-operation  of  beings  in  the  universe  and 
their responding to one another show that all creatures are raised by a single 
Nurturer, are organized by a single Director, are under the jurisdiction of a 
single Disposer, are the servants of a single Lord. For in accordance with 
an  all-embracing  law  of  mutual  assistance,  the  sun  cooks  the  necessities 
for the lives of living beings on the earth at a dominical command, and the 
moon acts as a calendar, and light, air, water, and sustenance hasten to the

and animals hasten to the assistance of human beings, and the members of

By knowing a single Creator, spirits and hearts are delivered from the 
distress  and  confusion  arising  from  misguidance,  and  from  the  spiritual 
pains arising from distress. They are saved by attributing all beings to a sin-
gle Maker. They ﬁnd assurance through the remembrance of a single Allah. 
For, as is proved decisively in the Twenty-Second Word, if all beings are not 
attributed to a single being, it becomes necessary to ascribe a single thing 
to  innumerable  causes,  and  then  the  existence  of  a  single  thing  becomes 
as difﬁcult as all beings. For if attributed to Allah, innumerable things are 
ascribed to a single being, and if they are not attributed to Him, it becomes 
necessary to attribute everything to innumerable causes. Then a single fruit 
becomes as difﬁcult as the universe, indeed, more difﬁcult. For just as if the 
management of one soldier is given to a hundred different people, a hundred 
difﬁculties arise, and if a hundred soldiers are given to the direction of one 
ofﬁcer, they are as easy to manage as a single soldier, so too the coinciding 
of numerous different causes in the creation of a single thing is difﬁcult to 
the hundredth degree. And if the creation of numerous things is given to a 
single being, it becomes easy to the hundredth degree.

Thus, it is only by recognizing the Creator’s unity and through knowl-
edge of Allah that man may be delivered from the boundless distress arising 
from the anxious desire to search for the truth inherent in his nature. Since 
there are endless difﬁculties and pains in unbelief and associating partners 
with Allah, such a way is certainly impossible and devoid of truth. While 
since suitably to the ease, abundance, and ﬁne art in the creation of beings, 
there is a boundless ease in afﬁrming divine unity, that way is surely neces-
sary and the truth.

O you miserable people of misguidance! See how dark and full of pain 
is the way of misguidance! What is it that makes you take it? And see how 
easy and pleasant is the way of belief and afﬁrming divine unity! Take that 
way and be saved!

According to the meaning of this verse, all things, and especially living 
creatures,  have  been  given  a  form  and  regular  proportions  in  accordance 
with wisdom as though they have emerged from a purposeful mould. Con-
tained in those measured proportions are intricate extremities yielding vari-
ous beneﬁts and uses. And the form of their clothes and their proportions, 
which they change throughout the periods of their lives, are each immaterial 
and well-ordered and measured, and are composed of the appointed events 
of  their  lives  again  in  conformity  with  wisdom  and  beneﬁts.  This  shows 
clearly that those innumerable creatures, whose forms and proportions have 
been planned in the sphere of determining of an All-Powerful One of Glory, 
an All-Wise One of Perfection, and who have been given forms fashioned 
in the workshop of divine power, point to that Being’s necessary existence 
and testify to His unity and perfect power with endless tongues. Look at your 
own body and its members and the fruits of its intricate and complex places! 
See the perfect power within the perfect wisdom!

everything  recalls  its  Creator  with  its  own  particular  tongue  and  declares 
His holiness. Yes, the gloriﬁcations all beings utter audibly and through the 
tongues  of  their  beings  demonstrate  the  existence  of  a  single  Most  Holy 
Being. The testimony of innate disposition may not be rejected. It cannot be 
doubted, especially if the evidence comes from all sides. Look! The regu-
lar  structures  of  beings,  which  through  the  manner  they  are  created  com-
prise endless testimony and offer evidence in innumerable ways through the 
tongue of disposition and look to a single centre like concentric circles – all 
these  are  tongues.  Similarly,  their  well-proportioned  and  balanced  assem-
blages  are  all  testifying  tongues.  And  their  perfect  lives  are  all  glorifying 
tongues.  Thus,  as  is  proved  in  the  Twenty-Fourth  Word,  their  glorifying, 
extolling, and testifying with all these tongues to a single Most Holy Being 
demonstrate a Necessarily Existent One as light shows the sun, and point to

According  to  the  meaning  of  these  verses,  all  things  are  in  need  of  a 
single All-Glorious Creator in everything, in all matters and circumstances. 
Indeed, we look at the beings in the universe and see that there is the mani-
festation of an absolute force within an absolute weakness, and the traces 
of an absolute power are apparent within an absolute impotence; like, for 
example, the wonderful states and stages plants display when the life force 
awakens in their seeds and roots. There is the manifestation too of an abso-
lute wealth within an absolute poverty and dryness; like the poverty of trees 
and the soil in winter and their glittering wealth and riches in the spring. The 
sprinklings of an absolute life are also apparent within an absolute lifeless-
ness;  like  the  transformation  of  the  elements  into  living  matter.  There  is, 
moreover,  the  manifestation  of  an  all-encompassing  consciousness  within 
an  absolute  ignorance;  like  everything,  from  minute  particles  to  the  stars, 
acting consciously and conforming to the order of the universe and to the 
demands of wisdom and requirements of life. 

Thus, this power within impotence, and strength within weakness, and 
wealth  and  riches  within  poverty,  and  life  and  consciousness  within  life-
lessness and ignorance necessarily and self-evidently open up windows on 
every side onto the necessary existence and unity of a Possessor of Absolute 
Power  and  Absolute  Strength,  a  Possessor  of  Absolute  Riches,  an  Abso-
lutely  Knowing,  All-Living  and  Self-Sufﬁcient  One.  In  their  totality  they 
point to a luminous highway on a vast scale.

O you heedless one who has fallen into the swamp of nature! If you do 
not quit nature and recognize divine power, you have to accept that in eve-
rything, in every minute particle even, reside an inﬁnite force and power, 
a boundless wisdom and skill, and the ability to see, know, and administer 
most other beings.

everything is cut out according to its innate abilities with perfect measuring 
and ordering, and put together with the ﬁnest art, in the shortest way, the best 
form, the lightest manner, and most practicable shape. Look at the clothes 
of birds, for example, and the easy way they rufﬂe up their feathers and con-
tinuously use them. Also, things are given bodies and dressed in forms in a 
wise manner with no waste and nothing in vain; they testify to their number 
to the necessary existence of an All-Wise Maker and point to that Possessor 
of Absolute Power and Knowledge.

Sixteenth Window 
The order and ordering in the creation and disposal of creatures, which 
are renewed season by season on the earth, show clearly a universal wisdom. 
Since an attribute cannot be without the one it qualiﬁes, this universal wis-
dom necessarily shows an All-Wise One. The wonderful adornment within 
the veil of wisdom, self-evidently shows a perfect beneﬁcence, and that per-
fect beneﬁcence necessarily points to a gracious, All-Generous Creator. The 
all-encompassing benevolence and bestowal within the veil of beneﬁcence 
show self-evidently an all-embracing mercy, and that all-embracing mercy 
shows necessarily an All-Merciful and All-Compassion-ate One. The sus-
tenance and foods of living creatures above the veil of mercy, all perfectly 
appropriate for their needs, show clearly a sustaining providence and a com-
passionate dominicality, and that sustaining and administering necessarily 
point to an All-Generous Provider. 

Yes, all the creatures on the face of the earth, thus raised with perfect 
wisdom,  adorned  with  perfect  beneﬁcence,  bestowed  upon  with  perfect 
mercy,  and  nurtured  with  perfect  compassion,  testify  to  the  necessary 
existence of an All-Wise, Muniﬁcent, Compassionate, Providing Maker, 
and point to His unity.

Look at and consider also the universal wisdom which is apparent on the 
face of the earth as a whole and is to be seen in its totality and shows clearly 
purpose and will; and the perfect beneﬁcence embracing all creatures, which 
also comprises the wisdom; and the all-encompassing mercy,  which com-
prises the beneﬁcence and wisdom and includes all the beings of the earth;

and the generous sustaining and nurturing, which also comprises the mercy 
and wisdom and beneﬁcence and embraces all living creatures. Just as the 
seven  colours  form  light,  and  the  light,  which  illuminates  the  face  of  the 
earth, undoubtedly shows the sun, so too that beneﬁcence within wisdom, 
and mercy within beneﬁcence, and sustaining and nurturing within mercy 
show brilliantly on a large scale and at a high degree the unity and perfect 
dominicality of an utterly Wise, Generous, Compassionate, Providing Nec-
essarily Existent One.

O  you  stupeﬁed  and  heedless  denier!  With  what  can  you  explain  this 
wise, generous, compassionate, providential sustaining, this strange, won-
derful, miraculous state of affairs which is before your eyes? With chance

your heart? With nature, which is deaf like your head? With causes which

impotent,  ignorant,  deaf,  blind,  contingent,  and  wretched,  do  you  want  to 
give the name “ nature ” to the All-Glorious One, Who is utterly holy, pure, 
exalted, and free of all defect and absolutely Powerful, Knowing, Hearing,

If we observe the face of the earth in the summer, we see that an absolute

And the utter speed in the creation of things, which necessitates imbal-

And an absolute multiplicity, which necessitates unimportance, indeed, 
ugliness, is apparent within a perfect beauty of art. Look at all the ﬂowers

And the absolute ease in the creation of things, which necessitates lack

is on the contrary to be seen within a perfect differentiation and separation. 
Consider  the  perfect  differentiation  of  seeds  when  they  sprout,  despite 
being  cast  into  the  earth  all  mixed-up  together  and  all  resembling  one 
another with regard to their substance, and the various substances which 
enter trees being separated out perfectly for the leaves, ﬂowers, and fruits, 
and  the  foods  which  enter  the  stomach  all  intermingled  being  separated 
out perfectly according to the various members and cells. See the perfect

And the great abundance and inﬁnite profusion, which necessitate unim-
portance and worthlessness, are seen to be highly valuable and expensive in 
regard to the creatures and art on the face of the earth. Within these innu-
merable wonders of art, consider only the varieties of mulberry, those con-
fections of divine power, on the table of the All-Merciful on the face of the 
earth! See the perfect mercy within the perfect art!

Thus, just as the day shows the light, and the light the sun, the great value

mixing  together  with  the  utmost  differentiation  and  separation  within  the 
utter profusion; and the great distance together with the utmost conformity

Consider  this  comparison  which  is  explained  in  the  Twenty-Second 
Word: a ﬁnely crafted, well planned work like a palace self-evidently points 
to a well planned act. That is to say, a building indicates the act of building. 
And a ﬁne, well planned act necessarily points to a proﬁcient agent, a skil-
ful master, a builder. And the titles of proﬁcient master and builder point 
self-evidently to a perfect attribute, that is, to a faculty for the craft. And that 
perfect attribute and that perfect faculty for the craft self-evidently indicate 
the existence of a perfect innate ability. And a perfect innate ability indicate 
the existence of an exalted spirit and elevated essence.

In just the same way, the constantly renewed works ﬁlling the face of the 
earth, indeed the universe, show clearly acts of the utmost perfection. And 
those acts, which are encompassed by total order and wisdom, point clearly 
to an agent whose titles and names are perfect. For it is obvious that well-
planned, wise acts cannot be without the one who performs them. And titles 
of the utmost perfection point to the utterly perfect attributes of that agent. 
For according to the rules of grammar, the active particle is formed from 
the inﬁnitive [ that is, what is called the root in Arabic grammar ]; so too the 
source and roots of nouns, names and titles are attributes. And attributes at 
the utmost degree of perfection point indubitably to utterly perfect essen-
tial qualities. And those perfect essential qualities, which we are unable to 
describe – the essential capability – point most certainly to an essence which 
is at the utmost peak of perfection. 

Thus, since in every part of the world all the works of art and creatures 
are perfect works, each of them testiﬁes to an act, and the act testiﬁes to a 
name, and the name to an attribute, and the attribute to a quality, and the 

758

quality to the essence. Thus, just as singly they testify to the necessary exist-
ence of the All-Glorious Maker to the number of creatures and indicate His 
oneness, so altogether they form an ascension in divine knowledge as strong 
as the chains of beings. They form a proof of reality in continuous sequence 
which no doubt can pierce or penetrate.

So  now,  O  wretched,  heedless  denier!  With  what  can  you  smash  this 
proof which is as powerful as the chain of the universe? With what can you 
close this latticed window with its innumerable spaces through which shine 
rays of truth to the number of these creatures? Which veil of heedlessness 
can you draw over it?

Nineteenth Window 

According to the meaning of the verse:

( 17:44 ) o n m l k j i h g f e d c b 
the All-Glorious Maker has attached innumerable meanings and instances 
of wisdom to the heavenly bodies so that it is as if, in order to express His 
glory and beauty, He has caused the heavens to speak with the words  of the 
suns, moons and stars. To the beings in the atmosphere also He has attached 
instances of wisdom and meanings and aims, as if to make it speak through 
the words of the thunder, lightning, and drops of rain, and give instruction in 
the perfection of His wisdom and beauty of His mercy.

He causes the head of the earth to speak too with its meaningful words 
known as animals and plants and displays the perfections of His art to the 
universe. Then He makes the plants and trees speak, all words of that head, 
through the words of their leaves, ﬂowers, and fruits and again proclaims the 
perfection of His art and beauty of His mercy. Their ﬂowers and fruits, too, 
He makes speak, through the words of their seeds, and gives instruction to 
the aware and conscious in the subtleties of His art and the perfection of His 
dominicality. Now, out of these innumerable words of gloriﬁcation, we shall 
lend our ears and listen to a single shoot and a single ﬂower and their mode 
of expression, and learn the way in which they testify.

Yes, all plants and all trees describe their Maker with numerous tongues  
in such a way that they leave those who study them in amazement, causing 
them to exclaim: “ Glory be to Allah! How wonderfully they bear witness 
to Him! ”

Yes,  the  gloriﬁcation  of  plants  at  the  time  their  ﬂowers  open,  and  the 
moment they produce new shoots, and when they offer their smiling words 

THIRTY-THIRD WORD

759

is as beautiful and clear as themselves. For through the beautiful mouth of 
each ﬂower and the tongues of its orderly shoots and the words of its pre-
cisely  measured  seeds,  the  order  demonstrates  wisdom  and  is  observedly 
within a balance which demonstrates knowledge. And the balance is within 
an embroidery of art which demonstrates skill and craft. And the embroidery 
of art is within an adornment which demonstrates favour and muniﬁcence. 
And  the  adornment  is  within  subtle  scents  which  demonstrate  mercy  and 
bestowal. And these meaningful qualities one within the other form such a 
tongue of testimony that it both describes the All-Beauteous Maker through 
His names, and portrays Him through His attributes, and expounds the mani-
festation of His names, and expresses His making Himself loved and known.
If  you  hear  such  testimony  from  a  single  ﬂower,  will  your  doubts  and 
suspicions and heedlessness persist when you listen to all the ﬂowers in the 
dominical  gardens  on  the  face  of  the  earth  and  hear  the  elevated  strength 
with which they proclaim the necessary existence and unity of the All-Glo-
rious Maker? If they do persist, can it be said of you that you are a conscious 
human being?

Come, now look carefully at a tree! See its delicate mouth apparent in 
the orderly emergence of the leaves in spring, and the blossoms opening in a 
measured manner, and the fruits swelling with wisdom and mercy and danc-
ing at the blowing of the breeze in the hands of the branches like innocent 
children. See the just balance within the wise order expressed by the tongue 
of the leaves becoming green at a generous hand, by that of the ﬂowers smil-
ing with the joy of a favour received, and by the words of the fruits laugh-
ing through a manifestation of mercy. See the careful arts and embroideries 
within the balance demonstrating justice; and the mercy within the skilful 
embroideries  and  adornment;  and  the  various  sweet  tastes  and  delightful 
scents, which indicate mercy and bestowal; and the seeds, each of which is 
a miracle of power within the agreeable tastes: all these point in the clear-
est fashion to the necessary existence and unity of an All-Wise, Generous, 
Compassionate,  Beneﬁcent,  Bountiful  Maker,  a  Bestower  of  Beauty  and 
Favours,  to  the  beauty  of  His  mercy  and  perfection  of  His  dominicality. 
Thus, if you can listen at the same time to the tongues of  disposition of all 
the trees on the earth, you will see and understand the exquisite jewels to be 
found in the treasury of the verse:

Just as perfect wisdom and beauty of art are apparent in particulars and 
results and in details, so do the universal elements and large creatures take 
up their positions in accordance with wisdom and art, despite their appar-
ently being mixed up together by chance without order. Thus, as its other 
wise  duties  show,  light  shines  in  order  to  proclaim  and  make  known  the 
divine  creatures  on  the  face  of  the  earth,  with  the  permission  of  its  Sus-
tainer. This means that light is employed by a Wise Maker; by means of it,

He makes manifest His antique works of art in the exhibitions of the market 
of this world.

Now consider the winds! According to the testimony of their other wise, 
generous beneﬁts and duties, they are hastening to extremely numerous and 
important tasks. It means that their movement in waves is a being employed, 
a being despatched, a being utilized by an All-Wise Maker; it is a working 
expeditiously to speedily carry out their Sustainer’s commands.

Now consider the springs, the streams, and the rivers! Their welling-up 
out  of  the  ground  and  out  of  mountains  is  not  by  chance.  For  it  is  dem-
onstrated by the testimony of their beneﬁts and fruits, the works of divine 
mercy, and by the statement of their being stored up in mountains and being 
sent with the balance of wisdom in proportion to need, that they are subju-
gated and collected by an All-Wise Sustainer, and that their ﬂowing forth is 
their conforming exuberantly to His command.

Now consider all the varieties of stones and jewels and minerals in the 
earth!  Their  decorations  and  beneﬁcial  properties,  the  wise  beneﬁts  con-
nected to them, and their being prepared appropriately to human and animal 
needs and vital necessities all show that they are made in that way through 
the decoration, arrangement, planning, and forming of an All-Wise Maker.

Now  consider  the  ﬂowers  and  fruits!  Their  smiles,  tastes,  beauties, 
embroideries, and scents are all like invitations to and menus for the table 
of a Most Muniﬁcent Maker, an All-Compassionate Bestower of Bounties; 
they are given as various menus and invitations to each species of beings 
through their different colours, scents, and tastes.

Now  consider  the  birds!  A  certain  indication  that  their  twittering  and 
chirruping is an All-Wise Maker’s causing them to speak is the astonishing 
way in which they express their feelings to one another with those sounds 
and state their intentions.

Now  consider  the  clouds!  A  deﬁnite  indication  that  the  pattering  of 
the rain is not a meaningless sound and that the crashing of thunder and 
lightning is not a futile din is that those strange beings are created in empty 
space.  Also  raindrops  like  the  water  of  life  are  milked  from  the  clouds, 
suckling the living creatures on the earth so needy and longing for them.  
These facts show that the pattering and crashing are most meaningful and 
full  of  wisdom.  For  at  the  command  of  a  Most  Generous  Sustainer,  the 
rain calls out to those longing for it: “ Good news! We are coming! ” They 
express this meaning.

The  universe’s  lamp,  the  sun,  forms  a  window  onto  the  existence  and 
unity  of  the  universe’s  Maker  that  is  as  brilliant  and  luminous  as  the  sun 
itself.  Indeed,  despite  their  great  differences  with  regard  to  size,  position, 
and speed, the twelve planets including our globe known as the solar system 
are in motion and revolve with perfect order and wisdom and perfect bal-
ance without a second’s confusion, and are bound to the sun through a divine 
law known as gravity, that is, they follow their leader as though in prayer. 
This demonstrates on a vast scale the tremendousness of divine power and 
the  unity  of  their  Sustainer.  Those  lifeless  bodies,  those  vast  unconscious 
masses, are rotated and employed within the utmost order and wise balance, 
in various forms and over varying distances and in varying motions, prov-
ing the degree of the power and the wisdom; you compare for yourself. If 
chance were to interfere the tiniest amount in this vast and complex matter, 
it would cause an explosion so great it would scatter the universe. If it were 
to arrest the motion of one of them for a minute, it  would cause it to leave its 
orbit and would open the possibility of its colliding with another planet. You 
can understand how awesome would be the collision of bodies thousands of 
times larger than the earth.

Now  we  shall  refer  to  the  all-encompassing  knowledge  of  Allah  the 
wonders of the solar system, that is, the twelve planets which are the sun’s 
followers and fruits, and consider only our own planet, the earth, which 
is here before our eyes. We see that our planet is made to travel on a long 
journey  around  the  sun  by  a  dominical  command  as  its  most  important 
duty – as is described in the First Letter – in a way that demonstrates the 
grandeur of dominical majesty and the loftiness of the sovereignty of the 
Godhead and the perfection of His mercy and wisdom. It has been made a 
dominical ship ﬁlled with the wonders of divine art, and a travelling dwell-
ing like an exhibition for Allah’s conscious servants to gaze on. And the 
moon has been attached to it with precise reckoning for mighty instances 
of  wisdom,  like  being  an  hour  hand  for  telling  the  time.  The  moon  too 
has  been  given  various  mansions  through  which  to  journey.  Thus,  these 
aspects  of  this  blessed  planet  of  ours  prove  the  necessary  existence  and 
unity of a Possessor of Absolute Power with a testimony as powerful as 
the globe of the earth itself. You can make an analogy with the rest of the 
solar system from this.

Furthermore,  the  sun  is  made  to  turn  on  its  own  axis  like  a  spinning-
wheel, in order to wind into a ball the immaterial threads called gravity and 
tie the planets with them and set them in order. So too it is impelled together 
with its planets at a speed that cuts ﬁve hours’ distance a second towards, 
according to one estimate, the Constellation of Hercules, or towards the Sun 
of Suns. This most certainly occurs through the power and at the command 
of the All-Glorious One, the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity. It 
is  as  though  He  makes  the  solar  system  perform  these  manoeuvres  like  a 
platoon  of  soldiers  under  orders,  and  so  demonstrates  the  majesty  of  His 
dominicality.

O  you  astronomers!  What  chance  can  interfere  in  these  matters?  The 
hands of what causes can reach them? What force can draw close to this? 
Come on, you say! Would such a Glorious Monarch display impotence and 
permit others to have a role in his sovereignty? Would He give to other hands 
living  creatures  in  particular,  which  are  the  fruit,  result,  aim,  and  essence 
of the universe? Would He permit any other to interfere? Especially man, 
would He leave him to his own devices, the most comprehensive of those 
fruits, the most perfect of the results, vicegerent of the earth, and His mirror-
like guest? Would He refer him to nature and chance and reduce the majesty 
of His sovereignty to nothing; reduce to nothing His perfect wisdom?

The  globe  of  the  earth  is  a  head  with  a  hundred  thousand  mouths.  In 
each mouth are a hundred thousand tongues. On each tongue are a hundred 
thousand proofs, each one of which testiﬁes in numerous ways to the neces-
sary existence, unity, sacred attributes, and most beautiful names of an All-
Glorious One Who is the Necessary Existent, Single and Unique, Powerful 
over all things, and Knowing of all things. 

Yes, we consider the ﬁrst creation of the earth and we see that rock was 
created from matter in a ﬂuid state, and that soil was created from rock. If 
that substance had remained ﬂuid, it would have been uninhabitable, and if 
after becoming rock, the ﬂuid had become hard as iron, it would have unsuit-
able for use. So what gave it its state was surely the wisdom of an All-Wise 
Maker Who saw the needs of the earth’s inhabitants. Then the layer of soil 
was thrown over the pegs of mountains so that the earthquakes arising from 
internal upheavals could breathe through the mountains and they would not 
cause  the  earth  to  be  shaken  out  of  its  motion  and  duties,  and  so  that  the 
mountains would preserve the earth from the encroachment of the sea, and 
be storehouses for the vital necessities of living beings, and purify the air 
from noxious gases so allowing living beings to breathe, and so that they 
would accumulate and hold water reserves, and be a source and mine for the 
minerals necessary for living creatures.

Thus, this situation testiﬁes clearly and powerfully to the necessary exist-
ence and unity of a Possessor of Absolute Power, One All-Wise and Com-
passionate.

O geographers! With what can you explain this? What chance could make 
this dominical ship laden with these wonderful creatures into an exhibition 
of marvels, and spin it at a speed whereby it covers a distance of twenty-four 
thousand years a year while not allowing a single of the objects arranged on 
its face to fall off?

Also look at these embroidered lines displaying remarkable, wondrous 
arts on the face of the earth, multicoloured and full of strange wisdom! See  
how the brooks and streams, seas and rivers, mountains and hills have all 
been made dwellings and means of transport suitable for His various crea-
tures and servants. See how with perfect wisdom and order He has then ﬁlled 
them with innumerable varieties of plants and animals, and given them life 
and made them rejoice, and how regularly minute by minute He discharges 
the  creatures  and  empties  those  dwellings  with  death,  and  once  again  in 
orderly fashion reﬁlls them in the form of resurrection after death. This testi-
ﬁes with hundreds of thousands of tongues to the necessary existence and 
unity of an All-Powerful One of Glory, an All-Wise One of Perfection.

I n   S h o r t :  The earth, the face of which is an exhibition of marvels of art, 
an assembly of the wonders of creation, a place of passage for the caravans

the same degree as the universe.

Life is the most luminous, the most beautiful of the miracles of domini-

ing the manifestations of the Eternally Besought One. Yes, on its own, life 
makes known a Living and Self-Subsistent One together with all his names 
and acts. For life is a light, a medicament, like a potion blended from numer-
ous attributes. Just as the seven colours are combined in light, and various 
drugs  are  blended  together  in  a  medicament,  so  life  is  a  reality  made  of 
numerous attributes. Some of the attributes in its reality expand by means

of the senses; they unfold and are differentiated. The greater part, however, 
make themselves perceived in the form of the emotions; they make them-
selves known by welling up out of life.

Furthermore, life comprises provision, mercy, grace, and wisdom, which 
are dominant in the regulation and administration of the universe. It is as if 
life fastens them on behind it and draws them into the place it enters. For 
example, when life enters a body, the name of All-Wise is also manifested; 
it  makes  its  home  well  and  orders  it  with  wisdom.  In  the  same  way,  the 
name of All-Generous is manifested; it organizes and decorates its dwell-
ing according to its needs. At the same time, the manifestation of the name 
of  All-Compassionate  is  apparent;  it  bestows  all  sorts  of  bounties  for  the 
continuance and perfection of life. Simultaneously, the manifestation of the 
name of Provider appears; it produces the sustenance, material and imma-
terial, necessary for the perpetuation and unfolding of the life, and in part 
stores them up within its body. That is to say, life is like a point of focus; var-
ious attributes enter into one another, indeed, they become one and the same. 
It is as if in its entirety life is both knowledge, and at the same time power, 
and at the same time wisdom and mercy, and so on. Thus, with regard to 
this comprehensive essence, life is a mirror of the Eternally Besought One 
reﬂecting the essential dominical attributes. It is due to this mystery that the 
Necessarily Existent One, Who is Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent, creates 
life in great abundance and plenitude, and scatters it far and wide and broad-
casts it, and gathers everything around life and makes it serve it. For life’s 
duty is great. Yes, it is not easy to be the mirror of the Eternally Besought 
One, it is not some petty duty.

Thus, the instantaneous and continuous coming into existence from noth-
ing  of  these  countless,  numberless  lives  which  we  all  the  time  see  before 
our eyes, – and of spirits, which are the origins and essences of lives – their 
being sent, demonstrate the necessary existence, sacred attributes, and most 
beautiful names of One Necessarily Existent and Ever-Living and Self-Sub-
sistent as clearly as sunbeams show the existence of the sun. Just as someone 
who does not recognize and accept the existence of the sun is compelled to 
deny the light which ﬁlls the day, so the person who does not recognize the 
Sun  of  Divine  Oneness,  Who  is  Ever-Living  and  Self-Subsistent  and  the 
Giver of Life and Death, has to deny the existence of the living creatures 
which ﬁll the earth and even the past and the future; he has to fall a hundred 
times lower than an animal, to fall from the level of life to become some-
thing utterly ignorant and lifeless.

Death is a proof of dominicality as much as life is a proof of it; it is a tuly 

powerful proof of divine unity. As indicated by the verse,

( 67:2 ) . - , + 
death is not non-existence, annihilation, non-being, an authorless extinc-
tion; rather, as is shown in the First Letter, it is a being discharged from 
service  by  an  All-Wise  Author,  a  change  of  residence,  an  exchange  of 
bodies, a rest from duty, a being freed from the prison of the body; it is a 
purposeful, orderly work of wisdom. Indeed, just as the living face of the 
earth and the well fashioned, living creatures upon it testify to the neces-
sary existence and unity of an All-Wise Maker, so too with their deaths do 
those living beings bear witness to the eternity and unity of an Ever-Living 
and Self-Subsistent One. It is proved and elucidated in the Twenty-Second 
Word that death is an extremely powerful proof of divine unity and eter-
nity,  so  we  refer  the  discussion  to  that  Word  and  here  only  explain  one 
important point. It is as follows:

Both with their existences living beings point to the existence of a Nec-
essarily  Existent  One,  and  with  their  deaths  they  testify  to  the  eternity 
and unity of an Ever-Living Eternal One. For example, as a single living 
creature, the face of the earth points to its Maker with its order and circum-
stances; so too it points to Him when it dies. That is, when winter conceals 
the earth’s face with its white shroud, it turns men’s gazes away from itself 
– their gaze moves to the past behind the corpse of that departing spring 
– and it shows them a far wider scene. That is to say, the past springs of 
the earth, which were all miracles of power, inform them that new living 
springtime creatures of the earth will appear, and since they all testify to 
the existence of those future wonders of divine power, each a living earth, 
they testify brilliantly and powerfully and on a vast scale to the necessary 
existence, unity, everlastingness, and eternity of an All-Glorious Maker, 
an All-Powerful One of Perfection, a Self-Subsistent Enduring One, and 
Eternal Sun; they demonstrate such brilliant proofs that whether one wants 
to or not they make one declare:

THE WORDS

I n   S h o r t :  According to the meaning of the verse,

( 30:19 )   H G F E 
just  as  this  living  earth  testiﬁes  to  the  Maker  with  the  spring,  so  with  its 
death it turns man’s gaze to the miracles of divine power lined up on the 
two wings of time, the past and the future; it points to thousands of springs 
in place of one spring; it alludes to thousands of miracles of power in place 
of one miracle. And each of those springs testiﬁes more certainly than this 
present  spring,  for  the  springs  that  have  departed  for  the  past  have  gone 
together  with  their  apparent  causes,  and  after  them  others  like  them  have 
come in their places. This means that apparent causes are nothing: only that 
an All-Powerful One of Glory creates the springs, and tying them to causes 
with His wisdom shows that He has sent them. As for the living faces of the 
earth lined up in future time, they testify still more brilliantly. For they will 
be made anew from nothing, from non-being, and sent; they will be put on 
the earth, made to do their duty, then be sent away.

O heedless one deviated into nature and drowning in its swamp! How can 
something which does not possess hands wise and powerful enough to reach 
all the past and all the future interfere in the life of the earth? Can your total 
nonentities of chance and nature interfere in it? If you want to be saved, say: 
“ At the very most, nature is a notebook of divine power, and as for chance, 
it is a veil to hidden divine wisdom that conceals our ignorance. ” Approach 
the truth!

Like one struck points to the striker, and a ﬁnely fashioned work of art 
necessitates the artist, and an offspring requires a parent, and an under sur-
face demands a top surface, and so on – like all these qualities known as 
relative matters which are not absolute and cannot exist without each other, 
contingency, which is apparent in particulars in the universe as well as in 
it as a whole, points to necessity. And the state of being acted upon which 
is to be seen in all of them points to an act, and the createdness apparent 
in all of them points to creativity, and the multiplicity and composition to 
be  seen  in  all  demand  unity.  And  necessity,  an  act,  creativity,  and  unity 
clearly and necessarily require a being who is not contingent, acted upon, 
numerous, compounded, and created, but bears the attributes of being neces-
sary, an agent, one, and a creator. In which case, all contingency, states of 
being  acted  upon,  createdness,  multiplicity  and  composition  testify  to  the 

THIRTY-THIRD WORD

Necessarily Existent One, the One Who acts as He wills, the Creator of All 
Things, the Single One of Unity.

I n   S h o r t :  Just as necessity is apparent from contingency, the act from the 
state of being acted upon, and unity from multiplicity, and the existence of 
the former indicate the latter with certainty, in the same way, such qualities 
as createdness and having all their needs provided for, which are to be seen 
in beings, clearly point to the existence of such attributes as Making and Pro-
viding. In turn the existence of these attributes points necessarily and self-
evidently to the existence of an All-Compassionate Maker Who is a Creator 
and a Provider. That is to say, with the tongues of the hundreds of attributes 
of this sort which they bear, every being testiﬁes to hundreds of the Neces-
sarily Existent One’s most beautiful names. If this testimony is not admitted, 
it becomes necessary to deny all the attributes of this sort borne by beings.
Twenty-Sixth Window 1
The ever-renewed instances of beauty and fairness passing over the faces 
of the beings in the universe show that they are shadows of the manifesta-
tions of an Eternal Beauteous One. Yes, bubbles sparkling on the surface of 
a river and then disappearing, and other bubbles coming after them and spar-
kling like those that preceded them shows that they are mirrors reﬂecting the 
rays of a perpetual sun. In the same way, the ﬂashes of beauty that sparkle on 
the travelling beings in the river of ﬂowing time point to an Eternal Beaute-
ous One and are signs of Him.

Also, the ardent love in the heart of the universe points to an Undying 
Beloved. As is indicated by the fact that something not found in the tree 
will not be present in authentic form in its fruit, the ardent love of Allah 
present  in  humankind,  the  responsive  fruit  of  the  tree  of  the  universe, 
shows that a true love and passion is to be found in all the universe, but in 
other forms. In which case, this true love and passion in the heart of the 
universe points to a Pre-Eternal Beloved. Moreover, all the attractions and 
magnetic forces which appear in numerous different forms in the heart of 
the universe, show to aware hearts that they are thus through the attraction 
of a drawing truth.

Also,  according  to  the  consensus  of  the  saints  and  those  who  uncover 
the mysteries of creation, who are the most sensitive and luminous of crea-
tures, relying on their illuminations and witnessing, they have received the

with certainty to a Necessarily Existent One, to the existence of a Beauteous 
One of Glory, and to His making Himself known to man.

Also, the pen of beautifying and adorning which works on beings and on 
the face of the universe points clearly to the beauty of the names of the pen’s 
Owner. Thus, the beauty on the face of the universe, and the love in its heart, 
and the attraction in its breast, and the uncovering and witnessing in its eye, 
and the beauty and adornment on it as a whole, open up a truly subtle and 
luminous window. It displays to aware minds and hearts a Beauteous One 
of Glory, an Undying Beloved, an Eternal Worshipped One all of Whose 
names are beautiful.

O heedless one who ﬂounders amid suffocating doubts in the darkness of

( 39:62 ) h g f e d c b a ` _ 
We look at things which appear to be causes and effects in the universe 
and we see that the most elevated cause possesses insufﬁcient power for the 
most ordinary effect. This means that causes are a veil and something else 
makes the effects. To take only a small example out of innumerable crea-
tures let us consider the faculty of memory, which is situated in the human 
head in a space as tiny as a mustard seed: we see that it is like a book so 
comprehensive  –  indeed,  like  a  library  –  that  within  it  is  written  without 
confusion the entire story of a person’s life.

What cause can be shown for this miracle of power? The grey matter 
of the brain? The simple unconscious particles of its cells? The winds of 
chance and coincidence? But such a miracle of art can only be the work 
of  an  All-Wise  Maker  Who,  in  order  to  inform  man  that  all  the  actions 
he has performed have been recorded and will be recalled at the time of 
accounting, writes out a small ledger from the great book of man’s deeds 
to be published at the resurrection, and gives it to the hand of his mind. 
Thus,  since  they  are  comparable  to  man’s  faculty  of  memory,  make  an 
analogy  with eggs, seeds, and grains, and then compare other effects to 

THIRTY-THIRD WORD

771

these  small  and  comprehensive  miracles.  Because  whichever  effect  and 
work  of  art  you  look  at,  it  contains  such  wonderful  art  that  not  only  its 
common, simple cause, but if all causes were to gather, they would declare 
their impotence before it.

For example, suppose the sun, which is imagined to be a large cause, pos-
sessed will and consciousness; if it is asked: “ Are you able to make a ﬂy? ”, 
of course it would reply: “ Thanks to my Creator’s bounty, there is plenty of 
light, heat, and colours in my shop, but such things in the ﬂy’s being as eyes, 
ears, and life are neither in my shop, nor are they within my power. ”

Furthermore, the wonderful art and adornment in effects dismiss causes, 
and indicating the Necessarily Existent One, the Causer of Causes, in accord-
ance with the verse,

( 11:123 ) g f e d 
hand over matters to Him. In the same way, the results, purposes, and ben-
eﬁts attached to effects demonstrate self-evidently that they are the works of 
an All-Generous Sustainer, One All-Wise and Compassionate, beyond the 
veil of causes. For unconscious causes certainly cannot think of some aim 
and work for it. And yet we see that every creature that comes into existence 
does so following not one, but many aims, beneﬁts, and instances of wis-
dom. That means an All-Wise and Generous Sustainer makes those things 
and sends them. He makes those beneﬁts the aim of their existence.

For example, it is going to rain. It is obvious how distant the causes that 
apparently result in rain are from thinking of animals and feeling pity and 
compassion for them. That means it is sent to their assistance through the 
wisdom of a Compassionate Creator Who creates the animals and guaran-
tees their sustenance. Rain is even called mercy. Because, since it comprises 
numerous works of mercy and beneﬁts, it is as if mercy has become embod-
ied as rain, has been formed into drops, and arrives in that way.

Furthermore, all the ﬁnely adorned plants which smile at creatures and 
the embellishments and displays in animals self-evidently point to the nec-
essary  existence  and  unity  of  an  All-Glorious  One  behind  the  veil  of  the 
Unseen; One Who wants to make Himself known and loved through these 
beautifully  adorned  ﬁne  arts.  That  is  to  say,  this  adornment  in  things  and 
these  displays  and  embellishment  indicate  of  a  certainty  the  attributes  of 
making known and making loved. While the attributes of making known and 
making loved self-evidently testify to the necessary existence and unity of 
an All-Powerful Maker Who is Loving and Known.

THE WORDS

I n   S h o r t :   Since  causes  are  extremely  commonplace  and  impotent  and 
the effects attributed to them are most valuable and full of art, this dismisses 
causes. The aims and beneﬁts of effects also discharge ignorant and lifeless 
causes, and hand them over to an All-Wise Maker. Also, the adornment and 
skill on the face of effects indicates a Wise Maker Who wants to make His 
power known to conscious beings and desires to make Himself loved.

We look at the universe, and we see that a wisdom and ordering embrace 

everything from the cells of the body to the totality of the world. 

We look at the cells of the body, and we see that at the command and 
according to the law of one who considers what is beneﬁcial for the body 
and  administers  it,  there  is  a  signiﬁcant  management  in  those  miniscule 
cells. On the one hand a sort of sustenance is stored up in the stomach in the 
form of fat and expended when needed, and on the other in those tiny cells 
there is a regulation and depositing.

We look at plants, and a wise planning and nurturing are apparent.
We look at animals, and we see a rearing and nurturing that are generous 

to the utmost degree.

We look at the mighty elements of the universe, and we see a majestic 

government and illumination following momentous aims.

We look at the universe as a whole, and we see a perfect ordering for 
exalted instances of wisdom and elevated aims, as though it were a well-
ordered country, city, or palace.

As  is  described  and  proved  in  the  First  Stopping-Place  of  the  Thirty-
Second Word, from minute particles to the stars, not the tiniest place is left 
for associating partners with Allah. All beings are in effect so interrelated 
that one who cannot subjugate all the stars and hold them in his hand, cannot 
make a particle heed his claims to be its lord and sustainer. It is necessary to 
own all the stars in order to be the true sustainer of a single particle.

Furthermore, as is described and proved in the Second Stopping-Place 
of the Thirty-Second Word, one not capable of creating and arranging the 
heavens cannot make the individual features on the human face. That is to 
say, one who is not Sustainer of all the heavens cannot make the distinguish-
ing features on a single human face.

Thus, this is a window as large as the universe, which, if looked through, 
the following verses will also appear to the mind’s eye, written on the pages 
of the universe in large letters:

One spring I was setting out on a journey, a stranger, and deep in contem-
plation. While skirting a hill, a brilliant yellow buttercup struck my eye. It 
immediately brought to mind the same species I had seen long before in my 
native land and in other countries. This meaning was imparted to my heart: 
whoever this ﬂower is the seal of, the stamp of, the signature of, the impress 
of, all the ﬂowers of that species throughout the earth are surely His seals, 
His stamps. After this notion of the seal, the following thought occurred to 
me: just as a seal stamped on a letter denotes the letter’s author, in the same 
way,  this  ﬂower  is  a  seal  signifying  the  Most  Merciful.  And  this  hillock 
which is inscribed with the impresses of these species and written with the 
lines of these plants so full of meaning, is the missive of the ﬂower’s Maker. 
This hill too is a seal. This plateau and plain have taken on the form of a 
missive of the Most Merciful.

After this thought, the following fact came to mind: like a seal, every-
thing ascribes all things to its own Creator; it proves each is the letter of its 
own Scribe. Thus, all things are windows onto divine unity in such a way 
that each ascribes all things to a Single One of Unity. That is to say, there is 
an impress so wonderful, an art so miraculous in each thing, and especially 
in each living being, that the one who makes it and inscribes it so meaning-
fully can make all things, and the one who makes all things is  certainly Him. 
That is to say, one who cannot make all things cannot create a single thing.

This is the Window of the scholars of theology ( k a l ā m  ), based on contin-
gency and createdness, and their highway for proving the Necessarily Exist-
ent One. For all the details, we refer you to the scholars’ great books like 
S h a r ḥ   a l - M a w ā q i f  and S h a r ḥ   a l - M a q ā ṣ i d , and here only demonstrate one or 
two rays which spill on the spirit from the effulgence of the Qur’an and this 
Window. It is as follows: 

It is the requirement of dominion and rulership not to accept rivals; they 
reject  partnership;  they  repudiate  interference.  It  is  because  of  this  that  if 
there  are  two  headmen  in  a  village,  they  will  destroy  its  tranquillity  and 
order. Or if there are two chief ofﬁcials in a district, or two governors in a 
province, they will cause chaos. Or if there are two kings in a country, they 
will cause complete and stormy confusion. Since a pale shadow and petty 
example  of  dominion  and  rulership  in  impotent  human  beings  needy  for 
assistance  does  not  accept  the  interference  of  rivals,  opponents,  or  peers, 
then you may compare how fully a rulership which is in the form of absolute 
sovereignty and a dominion at the degree of dominicality will enforce that 
law of the rejection of interference in a Possessor of Absolute Power. That is 
to say, the most deﬁnite and constant necessity of Godhead and dominicality 
are unity and singleness. The clear proof of this and certain testimony are the 
perfect order and beautiful harmony in the universe. There is such an order 
from the wing of a ﬂy to the lamps in the heavens that the intellect prostrates 
before it in wonder and appreciation, declaring: “ Glory be to Allah! What 
wonders  Allah  has  willed!  How  great  are  Allah’s    blessings! ”  Had  there 
been an iota of space for partners to Allah, and had there been interference, 
as the verse,

THIRTY-THIRD WORD

  ( 21:22 ) ¶ μ ´ ³ ² ± °
indicates, the order would have been destroyed, the form changed, and signs

( 67:3-4 ) V U T
state and point out, however much the human gaze tries to ﬁnd faults, it can 
ﬁnd none anywhere, and returns worn out to its dwelling, the eye, and says 
to the fault-ﬁnding mind who sent it: “ I am worn out for nothing; there are 
no faults. ” This shows that the order and regularity are perfect. That is to 
say, the order in the universe is a deﬁnitive witness to divine unity.

Come now, let us consider createdness. The scholars of theology stated: 
“ The world is subject to change. And everything which is subject to change 
is  created.  Every  created  thing  has  a  creator,  a  maker.  In  which  case,  the 
universe has a pre-eternal creator. ”

And we say, yes, the universe is created. For we see that every century, 
indeed,  every  year  and  every  season  one  universe,  one  world,  goes  and 
another comes. This means that there is an All-Powerful One of Glory Who, 
creating the universe anew, creates a universe every year, indeed, every sea-
son, and every day, and shows it to the aware and conscious. Then He takes 
it back and puts another in its place. He attaches one universe after the other 
like the links of a chain, and hangs them on the string of time. For sure, the 
universes which appear from nothing and disappear before our eyes every 
spring, each a new universe the same as this world, are miracles of the power 
of the Omnipotent One Who creates them. The One Who continuously cre-
ates  and  changes  the  worlds  within  the  world  most  deﬁnitely  created  the 
world too. And He made the world and the face of the earth a guesthouse for 
those great visitors.

Now let us come to the discussion of contingency. The scholars of theol-

ogy said:

“ Contingency means equality in regard to existence and non-existence. ” 
That is, if existence and non-existence are both equally possible, one who 
will specify, prefer, and create is necessary. For contingent beings cannot 
create one another in uninterrupted and never-ending chains of cause and 
effect. Neither can one create another, and that the next, in the form of  cau-
sation. In which case there is a Necessarily Existent One Who creates them. 

776

THE WORDS

They  rendered  null  and  void  the  never-ending  causal  sequences  with  the 
famous twelve categorical proofs called the heaven and ladder arguments, 
and demonstrated causality to be impossible. They cut the chains of causes 
and proved the existence of the Necessarily Existent One.

And  we  say  this:  it  is  more  certain  and  easier  to  demonstrate  a  stamp 
peculiar  to  the  Creator  of  All  Things  on  everything  than  to  cut  causes  at 
the extremities of the world with the proofs refuting causality. Through the 
effulgence of the Qur’an, all the Windows and all the Words are based on 
this principle. Nevertheless, the point of contingency possesses an inﬁnite 
breadth.  It  demonstrates  the  existence  of  the  Necessarily  Existent  One  in 
innumerable respects. It is not restricted to the way of the scholars of the-
ology – cutting the chains of causes, which in truth is a mighty and broad 
highway; it opens a path to knowledge of the Necessarily Existent One by 
ways beyond count. It is as follows:

We see that in its existence, its attributes, and its lifetime, while hesitant 
among innumerable possibilities, that is, among truly numerous ways and 
aspects,  each  thing  follows  a  orderly  way  in  regard  to  its  being  in  innu-
merable respects. Its attributes also are given it in a particular way. All the 
attributes and states which it changes throughout its life are speciﬁed in the 
same fashion. This means it is impelled on a wise way amid innumerable 
ways through the will of one who speciﬁes, the choice of one who chooses, 
and the creation of a wise creator. He clothes it with well-planned attributes 
and states. Then it is taken out of isolation and made part of a compound 
body, and the possibilities increase, for they may be found in that body in 
thousands of ways. Whereas among those fruitless possibilities, it is given a 
particular, fruitful state whereby important results and beneﬁts are obtained 
from that body, and it is made to carry out important functions. Then the 
body is made a component of another body. Again the possibilities increase, 
for it could exist in thousands of ways. Thus, it is given one state among 
those thousands of ways. And through that state it is made to perform impor-
tant functions; and so on. It progressively demonstrates more certainly the 
necessary existence of an All-Wise Planner. It makes known that it is being 
impelled  by  the  command  of  an  All-Knowing  Commander.  Body  within 
body, each has a function, an orderly duty, in all the compounds that one 
within the other themselves become components of larger compounds, and 
has  relationships  particular  to  each,  in  the  same  way  that  a  soldier  has  a 
function and well-regulated duty in his squad, his company, his battalion, 
his regiment, his division, and his army, and a relationship particular to each 
of  these  sections,  one  within  the  other.  A  cell  from  the  pupil  of  your  eye 

THIRTY-THIRD WORD

has a duty in your eye and a relationship with it, and has wise functions and 
duties in your head as a whole and a relationship with it. If it confuses these 
the tiniest jot, the health and organization of the body will be spoilt. It has 
particular functions with regard to each of the veins, the sensory and motor 
nerves, and even the body as a whole, and wise relations with them. That 
speciﬁed state has been given it within thousands of possibilities through the 
wisdom of an All-Wise Maker.

In  just  the  same  way,  each  of  the  creatures  in  the  universe  testiﬁes  to 
the  Necessarily  Existent  One  through  the  particular  being,  the  wise  form, 
the beneﬁcial attributes given it among numerous possibilities. So too when 
they enter compounds, those creatures proclaim their Maker with a different 
tongue in each compound. Step by step till the greatest compound, through 
their relations, functions, and duties, they testify to the necessary existence, 
choice, and will of their All-Wise Maker. For the one who situates a thing in 
all the compounds while preserving its wise relations, must be the Creator 
of all the compounds. That is to say, it is as though one single thing testiﬁes 
to Him with thousands of tongues. Thus, from the point of view of contin-
gency, the testimony to the existence of the Necessarily Existent One is as 
numerous, not as the number of beings in the universe, but as the attributes 
of beings and the compounds they form.

O heedless one! Anyone who does not hear this testimony, these voices 
which ﬁll the universe, must be dead and unreasoning, is that not so? Come 
on, you say.

This Window is the Window of man and is concerned with man’s self. 
For more elaborate discussions in this respect, we refer you to the detailed 
books of the thousands of learned and scholarly saints, and here only point 
out a few principles we have received from the effulgence of the Qur’an. It 
is like this:

As  is  explained  in  the  Eleventh  Word,  “ Man  is  a  missive  so  compre-
hensive  that  through  his  self,  Almighty  Allah  makes  perceived  to  him  all 
His names. ” For the details we refer you to the other Words and here only 
explain three points. 

778

FIRST POINT

THE WORDS

Man is a mirror to the divine names with three aspects.
T h e   F i r s t   A s p e c t :  As the darkness of the night shows up light, so through 
his weakness and impotence, his poverty and need, his defects and faults, 
man makes known the power, strength, riches, and mercy of an All-Power-
ful One of Glory, and so on; he acts as a mirror to numerous divine attributes 
in this way. Even, since he searches for a source of support in his inﬁnite 
impotence and boundless weakness in the face of his innumerable enemies, 
his conscience perpetually looks to the Necessarily Existent One. And since 
he is compelled in his utter poverty and endless need to seek for a source of 
assistance in the face of his innumerable aims, his conscience in that respect 
all the time leans on the court of an All-Compassionate One of Riches and 
opens its hands in supplication to Him. That is to say, in regard to this source 
of support and source of assistance in the conscience, two small windows 
are opened onto the court of mercy of One All-Powerful and All-Compas-
sionate which may all the time be looked through.

T h e   S e c o n d   A s p e c t  of being mirror-like is this: by virtue of such par-
ticulars  as  his  partial  knowledge,  power,  senses  of  sight  and  hearing, 
ownership and sovereignty, which are sorts of samples given to him, man 
acts as a mirror to the knowledge, power, sight, hearing, and sovereignty 
of dominicality of the Master of the Universe; he understands them and 
makes  them  known.  For  example,  he  says:  “ Just  as  I  make  this  house 
and know how to make it, and I see it and own it and administer it, so the 
mighty  palace  of  the  universe  has  a  Maker.  Its  Maker  knows  it,  sees  it, 
makes it, and administers it. ” And so on.

T h e   T h i r d   A s p e c t  of being mirror-like: man acts as a mirror to the divine 
names,  the  imprint  of  which  are  upon  him.  There  are  more  than  seventy 
names the impresses of which are apparent in man’s comprehensive nature. 
These have been described to a degree at the start of the Third Stopping- 
Place of the Thirty-Second Word. For example, through his creation, man 
shows  the  names  of  Maker  and  Creator;  through  his  being  on  the  “ Most 
Excellent of Patterns, ” the names of Most Merciful and All-Compas-sionate, 
and through the ﬁne way he is nurtured and raised, the names of All-Gen-
erous and Granter of Favours, and so on; he shows the differing impresses 
of different names through all his members and faculties, all his organs and 
limbs, all his subtle senses and faculties, all his feelings and emotions. That 
is to say, just as among the names there is a greatest name, so among the 
impresses of those names there is a greatest impress, and that is man.

THIRTY-THIRD WORD

779

O you who considers himself to be a true man! Read yourself! You may 

otherwise become animal-like or be inanimate!

SECOND POINT

This points to an important mystery of divine oneness. It is like this: 
The relationship between man’s spirit and his body is such that it causes 
all  his  members  and  parts  to  assist  one  another.  That  is,  man’s  spirit  is  a 
commanding law from among the laws pertaining to creation – the mani-
festation of divine will – which has been clothed in external existence, and 
is a subtle dominical faculty. Thus, in administering the parts of the body 
and hearing their immaterial voices, and seeing their needs, the parts do not 
form obstacles to one another, nor do they confuse the spirit. Near and far 
are the same in relation to the spirit. They do not veil one another. If the 
spirit wishes, it can bring the majority to the assistance of one. If it wishes, it 
can know, perceive, and administer through each part of the body. Even, if it 
acquires great luminosity, it may see and hear through all the parts.

In the same way,  ( 16:60 )  j  i  h since the spirit, a command-
ing law of Almighty Allah, displays this ability in the body and members 
of man, who is the microcosm, surely, the boundless acts, the innumerable 
voices, the endless supplications, the uncountable matters in the universe, 
which is the macrocosm, will present no difﬁculty to the all-embracing will 
and  absolute  power  of  the  Necessarily  Existent  One.  They  will  not  form 
obstacles to one another. They will not occupy that All-Glorious Creator, 
nor confuse Him. He sees them all simultaneously, and hears all the voices 
simultaneously.  Near  and  distant  are  the  same  for  Him.  If  He  wishes,  He 
sends all to the assistance of one. He can see everything and hear their voices 
through everything. He knows everything through everything, and so on.

THIRD POINT

Life has a most important nature and signiﬁcant function, but since it has 
been discussed in detail in the Window on Life [ the Twenty-Third Window ] 
and in the Eighth Phrase of the Twentieth Letter, we refer you to them and 
here only make the following reminder.

The impresses in life, which, intermingled, boil up in the form of emo-
tions, point to numerous names and essential divine qualities. They act as 
mirrors  reﬂecting  the  essential  qualities  of  the  Ever-Living  and  Self-Sub-
sistent One in most brilliant fashion. But this is not the time to explain this 
mystery to those who do not recognize Allah or do not yet fully afﬁrm Him, 
and so we here close this door.

This is the Window of the Prophet Muhammad ( Upon whom be bless-

of Suns. How luminous and evident is this truly brilliant, wide, light-giv-
ing window has been proved in the Thirty-First Word, the Treatise on the 
Ascension, in the Nineteenth Word, the Treatise on Muhammad’s ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) prophethood, and in the Nineteen Signs of 
the  Nineteenth  Letter.  We  shall  therefore  think  of  those  two  Words  and 
that Letter and its Nineteenth Sign, and refer the word to them. For now 
we just say this:

Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), the living, articulate 
proof of divine unity, with all his strength demonstrated and proclaimed 
divine unity throughout his life with the two wings of messengership and 
sainthood, that is, with a strength that comprised the consensus of all the 
prophets who had preceded him and the unanimity of the saints and puri-
ﬁed scholars who came after him. He opened up a window onto knowl-
edge of Allah as broad and brilliant and luminous as the World of Islam. 
Millions of puriﬁed and veracious scholars such Imam al-Ghazali, Imam-i 
Rabbani,  Muhyiddin  al-‘Arabi,  and  ‘Abd  al-Qadir  Geylani  look  through 
that Window, and show it also to others. Is there any veil that can obscure 
such a Window? Can the person who accusingly does not look through this 
Window be said to possess reason? Come on, you say!

Think of all the Windows we have mentioned as being a few drops from 
the ocean of the Qur’an, then you may compare how many lights of divine 
unity  like  the  water  of  life  the  Qur’an  contains.  Even  if  the  Qur’an,  the 
source, origin and fountain of all those Windows, is considered extremely 
brieﬂy and simply, it still forms a brilliant, luminous, comprehensive Win-

you to the Treatise on the Miraculousness of the Qur’an, the Twenty-Fifth

Allah  willing,  this  Thirty-Third  Letter  of  Thirty-Three  Windows  will 
bring  to  belief  those  without  belief,  strengthen  the  belief  of  those  whose 
belief is weak, make certain the belief of those whose belief is strong but 
imitative, give greater breadth to the belief of those whose belief is certain, 
lead  to  progress  in  knowledge  of  Allah  –  the  basis  and  means  of  all  true 
perfection – for those whose belief has breadth, and open up more brilliant 
vistas for them. You cannot say, therefore, that “ One window is enough for 
me, ” because if your reason is satisﬁed, your heart wants its share as well, 
and so will your spirit want its share. Your imagination will also want its 
share of the light. The other Windows are also necessary, therefore, for each 
contains different beneﬁts.

In the treatise on the Prophet Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) Ascension, it was 
primarily the believer who was addressed, while the atheist was in the posi-
tion of listener. But in this treatise, it is the denier who is addressed, while 
it is the believer who is in the position of listener. This should be taken into 
consideration when looking at it.

Unfortunately,  due  to  an  important  reason,  this  letter  was  written  with 
extreme speed. It has also remained in the state of the ﬁrst draft. There will 
certainly  therefore  be  some  irregularities  and  defects  in  the  way  it  is 
expressed,  which  are  due  to  me.  I  request  of  my  brothers  then  that  they 
look at it with tolerance, and correct it if they are able, and pray for my 
forgiveness.

THE WORDS

Note

The reason this work entitled L e m e â t  ( Gleams ) is not about only one or 
two subjects like other collections ( d i w a n  ), is that it was written in order 
to expound to a degree Bediuzzaman Said Nursi’s previous work, H a k i k a t  
Ç e k i r d e k l e r i  ( Seeds of Reality ), and in prose form; and it does not indulge 
in fancies and imaginings like other collections of poetry or in unbalanced 
emotion.  It  was  written  as  scholarly  instruction  for  some  of  his  students, 
including his nephew who was assisting him, about the truths of the Qur’an 
and belief entirely in accordance with logic; it was a lesson about the Qur’an 
and belief. As Ustad himself said, and we understood the same thing, he had 
no propensity for verse and poetry and did not occupy himself with them, 
portraying the meaning of ( 36:69 ) ¿ ¾ ½ 

Working every day for two or two and a half hours, this work was written 
in versiﬁed form in twenty days during Ramadan while Bediuzzaman was a 
member of the Darü’l-Hikmet and had numerous preoccupations. Although 
to write one page of verse is as difﬁcult as writing ten of prose, and it was 
written in such a short period of time, it was dictated extempore, without 
study, and was published without being changed or corrected. In our opinion 
it is a marvel on account of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . No other versiﬁed collection 
of poetry has been written that can be read as effortlessly as prose. Allah 
willing, this work will at some time be a sort of M a t h n a w i  for the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  students. It is also a sort of index of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which appeared 
ten years subsequently and was completed in twenty-three years; a sort of 
forerunner of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , giving the good tidings of its major parts.

NOTE  ON  THE  TRANSLATION:  While  attempting  to  convey  the 
meaning  as  faithfully  as  possible,  the  present  translation  has  not 
attempted to reﬂect the versiﬁed aspects of the original. It is hoped that 
since, as was stated above, the work was written primarily to convey the 
author’s ideas, the readers will beneﬁt, despite the loss of many of the 
subtleties. ( Tr. )

In accordance with the rule,  َلِ(cid:183)َ(cid:106) ا َ(cid:175)ـِ(cid:170) ٌ

ّوُدَ(cid:150) ُءْر َ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)َا I have attached no impor-
tance to the rules of versiﬁcation and rhyme, since I do not know them. I at 
no time wanted to transform reality to comply with the demands of versiﬁca-
tion, as though sacriﬁcing lucidity to rhyme. I have clothed exalted truths in 
a rumpled dress in this unversiﬁed, unrhymed piece. Firstly, I did not know 
any  better  and  was  only  thinking  of  the  meaning.  Secondly,  I  wanted  to 
demonstrate my criticism of those poets who chip away and ﬁle the body to 
suit the clothes. Thirdly, a childish style such as this was preferred in order 
to  busy  the  instinctual  soul  as  well  as  the  heart  with  truths  during  Ram-
adan. But, my reader, I confess I made a mistake. Beware, do not do like-
wise! Don’t be distracted by the torn style and so be disrespectful towards 
its exalted truths!

Statement of Intention

O Reader! I confess in advance that I have many complaints about my 
abilities in the art of writing and versiﬁcation. Even now I cannot write my 
name properly. Nor have I made versiﬁcation and metre a chapter of my life. 
But suddenly my mind was beset by a persistent desire for verse. There is 
an epic about the expeditions of the Companions called   ْناَ(cid:93)َ(cid:127)(cid:193) ِ(cid:126) َ(cid:202)اَوَ(cid:178)  ِلْوَ(cid:162) . 
Its natural verse, like a hymn, was pleasing to my spirit. So I chose its form 
of  verse,  but  in  a  way  particular  to  myself.  I  wrote  some  poetry  which 
resembled  verse,  but  I  took  absolutely  no  pains  with  the  metre.  Anyone 
who wishes may read it easily as prose without thinking of the versiﬁca-
tion.  Also  it  should  be  thought  of  as  prose  so  that  the  meaning  may  be 
understood. In every section there is a pointer to the meaning. It should not 
depend on rhyme. A hat may be without a tassel, and metre may be without 
rhyme, and verse without rules. I think that if the words and versiﬁcation 
attract attention to themselves through their art, they busy the mind with 
themselves. It is better to be at odds and ends so as not to distract attention 
from the meaning.

My master in this work was the Qur’an; my book was life; the one I 
addressed was myself. And you, my reader, are my listener. The listener 
has no right to criticize; he takes what pleases him and ignores what he  
does not like. This work of mine proceeded from the effulgence of blessed

Two Sublime Proofs of the Afﬁrmation of Divine Unity
In its entirety the universe is a supreme proof; it declares Allah’s glory and 
unity  with  both  its  manifest  and  its  unseen  tongues. Yes,  it  recites  the 
unity  of  the  Most  Merciful  in  resounding  voice,  saying:  “ There  is  no 
Allah but He! ”

All its particles and cells, all its parts and members, are tongues mentioning 
Allah. Together they declare in that resounding voice: “ There is no Allah 
but He! ”

The tongues are various, the voices of differing pitch, but they are united on 
one point: the mentioning of Him, saying: “ There is no Allah but He! ”
It is the macroanthropos; it mentions Allah in high-sounding voice, while all 
its parts and particles join their tiny voices to its mighty voice. In unison 
they declare: “ There is no Allah but He! ”

The  world  recites  the  Qur’an’s  verses  within  its  circle  for  Allah’s 
remembrance,  the  Qur’anic  dawn  spills  forth  its  light. All  beings  with 
spirits express this idea: “ There is no Allah but He! ”

The  Glorious  Criterion  of Truth  and  Falsehood,  articulate  proof  of  divine 
unity, all of whose verses are truthful tongues, all its rays are ﬂashes of 
belief. All together they declare: “ There is no Allah but He! ”

If you lay your ear on the breast of that Criterion, in its profoundest depths 
you will hear clearly a heavenly voice which recites: “ There is no Allah 
but He! ”

Its  voice  is  utterly  exalted,  utterly  serious,  truly  sincere,  most  familiar;  it 
is  utterly  convincing,  decked  out  with  proofs.  Repeatedly  it  declares: 
“ There is no Allah but He! ”

All six aspects are transparent in this enlightened proof: upon it is the shining 
stamp of miraculousness; in this shines the light of guidance, which says: 
“ There is no Allah but He! ”

Yes,  beneath  it  is  interwoven  logic  and  elegant  proof;  on  its  right  is  its 
questioning the intelligence; the mind afﬁrms it on its every side, saying: 
“ There is no Allah but He! ”

six aspects are luminous, manifested in its constellations, “ There is no

Can any thieving suspicion, any stealthy doubt, any renegade delusion steal 
in on that resplendent castle with its walls of lofty suras, every word of 
which is an angel uttering: “ There is no Allah but He! ”

The Qur’an of Mighty Stature is an ocean afﬁrming divine unity. To take a 
single drop as an example, a single sura: Sura al-Ikhlas. Only a single, 
slight  allusion  out  of  innumerable  allusions:  its  six  phrases,  three 
negative, three positive, refute all kinds of ascription of partners to Allah, 
and prove seven aspects of the afﬁrmation of divine unity:

T h e   F i r s t   P h r a s e :   " !  ( 112:1 )  is  unassociated.  That  is,  it  is  deﬁned  as 
absolute. But within that deﬁnition is a speciﬁcation: “ There is no ‘He’ 
but He! ”

This is an allusion to the experiential ( s h u h ū d  ) afﬁrmation of divine unity. 
If  the  reality-perceiving  gaze  becomes  immersed  in  the  afﬁrmation  of 
divine unity, it says: “ There is nothing observed save He! ”

T h e   S e c o n d   P h r a s e :  $ # is an explicit afﬁrmation of the unity of the 
Godhead. Reality declares in the tongue of truth: “ There is nothing ﬁt to 
be worshipped save He! ”

T h e   T h i r d   P h r a s e :  ' &  This  is  the  shell  of  two  pearls  of  the 
afﬁrmation  of  divine  unity.  The  ﬁrst  is  the  afﬁrmation  of  the  unity  of 
divine dominicality. Yes, it declares with the tongue of the order of the 
universe: “ There is no creator save He! ”

The second pearl is the afﬁrmation of the unity of divine self-subsistence. 
Yes, the universe in its entirety declares through the tongue of need for 
an  effectual  power,  both  for  its  coming  into  being  and  its  continued 
existence: “ There is no self-subsistent save He! ”

T h e   F o u r t h   P h r a s e :  * )  This  conceals  the  afﬁrmation  of  the  unity 
of  divine  glory,  rejecting  every  sort  of  ascription  of  partners  to Allah. 
It decisively refutes disbelief. That is, one who is subject to change or 
division, or who reproduces, can be neither Allah, nor Creator, nor Self-
Subsistent.

The negation, ) refutes the idea of offspring, or the blasphemy of paternity, 

and rejects them.

The greater part of man’s misguidance has arisen from this association of 
partners with Allah at various times, in the form of the ten intellects, or 
the angels, or Jesus ( UWP ) or Uzayr being divine offspring.

The  Fifth  Phrase: , +    indicates  the  affirmation  of  divine  pre-
eternity  and  unity. Thus:  one  whose  existence  is  not  necessary  or  pre-
eternal cannot be Allah. That is, one created in time, or born of physical 
matter, or descended from a progenitor, cannot be the universe’s protector.
Causality, the worship of stars, idolatry, and naturalism: these are all varieties 

of the association of partners with Allah, all stages of misguidance.

In meaning, each of these six phrases is the result of the others, and the proof 
of the others; proofs in sequence, set in order in the fortress of this sura.
That is to say, included in Sura al-Ikhlas appropriately to its stature are thirty 

suras in sequence and order, a source of their effulgent dawn.

The Qur’an Requires Mirrors, 
Not Someone to Act on Its Behalf
Rather than proofs it is the sacredness of the source that drives the mass of

Only  ten  per  cent  are  matters  open  to  interpretation,  controversial,  and 
secondary. Ninety diamond pillars may not be put in the purse of someone

The source of the diamond pillars is the Qur’an and Hadith. They are their

THE WORDS

For wondrously this calamity has made unfold compassion, Islamic solidarity 
and brotherhood, the leaven of our lives, and has expedited the shaking, 
the destruction, of civilization.

Present-day low civilization will change form, its system will fall apart, then 

Islamic civilization will emerge.

Muslims  will  certainly  be  the  ﬁrst  to  enter  it  voluntarily.  If  you  want  a 
comparison, look closely at the principles of the civilization of the Shari‘a 
and those of present-day civilization, and consider their results:

The principles of present-day civilization are negative. Its foundations and 
values are ﬁve negative principles. Its machinery is based on these. 
Its  point  of  support  is  force  instead  of  right,  and  the  mark  of  force  is 

aggression and hostility, and their result is treachery.

Its goal is mean self-interest instead of virtue, and the mark of self-interest 

is rivalry and dispute, and their result, crime.

Its law of life is conﬂict instead of co-operation, and the mark of conﬂict is 

this: contention and mutual repulsion, and their result, poverty.

Its  principle  for  relations  between  peoples  is  racialism,  which  ﬂourishes 

through harming others and is nourished through devouring others.

The mark of negative nationalism and racialism is ghastly clashes, disastrous 

collisions, and their result, annihilation.

The ﬁfth is this: its alluring service is to excite lust and the appetites of the 
soul and facilitate the gratiﬁcation of whims, and their result is vice.
The mark of lust and passion is always this: they transform man into a beast, 

changing his character; they deform him, perverting his humanity.

If most of these civilized people were turned inside out, you would see their 

characters in the form of apes and foxes, snakes, bears, and swine.

They  appear  to  the  imagination  in  their  pelts  and  skins!  Examples  of  its 
products are these. The Shari‘a, however, is the balance and equilibrium 
of the earth.

The mercy in the Shari‘a comes from the skies of the Qur’an. The principles 
of Qur’anic civilization are positive. Its wheel of happiness turns on ﬁve 
positive principles:

Its point of support is truth instead of force, and the constant mark of truth 
is  justice  and  balance.  Security  and  well-being  result  from  these,  and 
villainy disappears.

Its aim is virtue instead of self-interest, and the mark of virtue is love and 
mutual attraction. Happiness results from these, and enmity disappears.
Its  principle  in  life  is  co-operation  instead  of  conﬂict  and  killing,  and  its 

mark is unity and solidarity, and the community is strengthened.

Its  service  takes  the  form  of  guidance  and  direction  instead  of  lust  and 
passion. And the mark of guidance is progress and prosperity in a way 
beﬁtting humanity;

The spirit is illumined and perfected in the way it requires. The way it uniﬁes 

the masses repulses racialism and negative nationalism;

It establishes in place of them the bonds of religion, patriotic relations, ties 

of class, and the brotherhood of belief. 

The  mark  of  these  bonds  are  sincere  brotherhood,  general  well-being; 
defence  in  case  of  external  aggression.  You  have  understood  now  the 
reason Islam was affronted, and did not embrace civilization.

Up  to  the  present,  Muslims  have  not  entered  this  present  civilization 
voluntarily,  it  has  not  suited  them,  moreover  it  has  clamped  on  them 
fetters of bondage.

While it should be the cure for mankind, it has become poison. It has cast 
eighty per cent into penury and misery, and produced a false happiness

The remaining ten per cent it has left uneasily between the two. Commercial 
proﬁts  have  been  the  tyrannical  minority’s.  But  true  happiness  is 
happiness for all;

Or at least salvation for the majority. The Qur’an, revealed as a mercy for 

mankind, only accepts civilization of this kind,

Happiness for all, or at least for the majority. In its present form the passions 

are unrestricted, caprice too is free; it is an animal freedom.

The passions dominate, caprice too is despotic; they have made inessential 

needs essential, and banished comfort and ease.

In primitive life, a man was in need of four things, civilization has put him 

in need of a hundred and has impoverished him. 

Lawful labours are insufﬁcient to meet the cost. This has driven mankind 
to trickery and the unlawful. It is on this point that it corrupted morality. 
It  bestowed  wealth  and  glitter  on  society  and  mankind,  but  made  the 
individual immoral and indigent. There are numerous witnesses to this. 
This malignant civilization vomited all at once the combined savagery and 
crimes, all the cruelty and treachery, of former centuries, and its stomach 
is still queasy. 1

The Islamic world’s holding back from it is both meaningful and noteworthy. 

It has been loath to accept it, and has acted coldly. 

1.  This means it will vomit in even more violent fashion. Yes, it vomited so terribly 
in the two World Wars that it ﬁlthied the faces of the land, sea, and air, staining them with 
its blood.

THE WORDS

Yes, the distinguishing quality of the divine light of the Illustrious Shari‘a is 

independence and self-sufﬁciency.

It will not give up that quality, that light of guidance, so that the genius of 

Rome, the spirit of civilization, should dominate it. 

The guidance of the former cannot combine with the philosophy of the latter, 

nor be grafted onto it, nor follow it. 

The Shari‘a has nourished the compassion and dignity of belief in the spirit 
of Islam. The Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition has taken the truths of the 
Shari‘a in its shining hand; 

Each  is  a  Staff  of  Moses  in  that  shining  hand.  In  the  future  that  sorcerer 

civilization will prostrate in wonderment before it.

Now, note this: Ancient Rome and Greece were two geniuses; twins from a 

single stock. One fanciful, the other materialist.

Like oil and water, they never combined. It needed time, civilization worked 
at it too, and so did Christianity, but none was successful at combining 
them.

Both  preserved  their  independence.  Now  it  is  as  though  those  two  spirits 
have changed their bodies; one has become German, the other, French.
They experienced a sort of metempsychosis. O my dream-brother! This is 
what  time  has  shown.  Like  two  genius  oxen  those  twins  rejected  any 
moves to combine them;

They  still  are  not  reconciled.  Since  they  are  twins,  they  are  brothers  and 
friends, companions in progress; but they fought and never made peace.
How could it be that with its different source, origin, and place of appearance, 
the light of the Qur’an and guidance of the Shari‘a should be reconciled 
with  the  genius  of  Rome,  the  spirit  of  modern  civilization,  and  should 
join and combine with it?

Their  origins  are  different:  guidance  descended  from  the  heavens,  genius 
emerged from the earth. Guidance works in the heart, and works the mind.
Genius works in the mind and confuses the heart. Guidance illumines the 
spirit, making it seeds sprout and ﬂourish; dark nature is illumined by it.
Its potentiality for perfection suddenly advances; it makes the carnal soul a 

docile servant; it gives aspiring man an angelic countenance.

As for genius, it looks primarily to the soul and physical being, it plunges 
into  nature,  making  the  soul  an  arable  ﬁeld;  the  animal  potentialities 
develop and ﬂourish;

It subjugates the spirit, dessicating its seeds; it shows up satanic features in 
mankind. But guidance gives happiness to life, it spreads light in this life 
and the next; it exalts mankind.

Antichrist-like 1 genius, blind in one eye, sees only the domain of this life; it 

is materialist and worships this world. It turns men into beasts.

Yes,  deaf  genius  worships  nature,  it  empowers  blind  force.  But  guidance 
recognizes conscious art and looks to purposeful power. Genius draws a 
curtain of ingratitude over the earth; guidance scatters the light of thanks.
It is because of this that genius is deaf and blind, while guidance is hearing 
and seeing. In the view of genius, the bounties of the earth are ownerless 
booty;

It provokes the desire to seize and steal them thanklessly, to savagely snap 

them off from nature.

In the view of guidance, the bounties scattered over the breast of the earth 
and face of the universe are the fruits of mercy; it sees a gracious hand 
beneath every bounty, and has it kissed in gratitude.

I cannot deny that there are numerous virtues in civilization, but they are 

neither the property of Christianity, nor the invention of Europe.

Nor are they the product of this century; they are common property, produced 
by  the  conjunction  of  minds  and  ideas,  from  the  laws  of  the  revealed 
religions, out of innate need, 

And particularly from the Islamic revolution brought about by the Shari‘a of 

Muhammad. No one can claim ownership of them. 
The leader of the Dream Assembly asked another question:
“ Man of the present century! Calamities are always the result of treachery 
and the cause of reward. Divine determining dealt a blow and issued its 
decree.

“ With which of your actions did you issue the f a t w a  to both divine decree and 
determining so that they decreed this calamity and gave you a beating? ”
I replied: The error of the majority is always the cause of general disasters. 
Mankind’s misguided ideas, Nimrod-like obduracy, Pharaoh-like pride, 
Swelled and swelled on the earth till it reached the skies. It upset too the 

sensitive mystery of creation. 

It caused to descend from the heavens the plague and storm of the last war’s 
quakes; it caused a heavenly blow to be visited on the inﬁdel. That is, the 
calamity was the calamity of all mankind.

The joint cause, inclusive of all mankind, were the misguided ideas arising 

from materialism. Bestial freedom, the despotism of the appetites.

The  reason  for  our  share  was  our  neglect  and  giving  up  of  the  pillars  of 
Islam. For the Exalted Creator wanted one hour out of the twenty-four.

THE WORDS

He demanded of us, and for us, only one hour for the ﬁve daily prayers, and 
commanded this. But out of laziness we gave them up, neglected them 
due to heedlessness.

So we received the following punishment: He made us perform prayers of a 
sort these last ﬁve years by constant twenty-four hour drill and hardship, 
being driven on and made to strive.

He also wanted of us one month’s fasting a year, but we pitied ourselves, so 

in atonement He compelled us to fast for ﬁve years.

As z a k a t , He wanted either a fortieth or a tenth of the property He had given 
us,  but  out  of  stinginess  we  did  wrong:  we  mixed  the  illicit  with  our 
property, and did not give it voluntarily.

So He had our accumulated  z a k a t  taken from us, and saved us from what 
was unlawful. The deed ﬁtted the punishment. The punishment ﬁtted the 
deed.

Righteous acts are of two sorts: one positive and voluntary, the other negative 
and enforced. All pains and calamities are good works; but negative and 
enforced. The Hadith offered consolation.

This sinful nation took its ablutions with its blood; it repented actively. As an 
immediate reward, four million, a ﬁfth of this nation, were raised to the 
degree of sainthood. It gave them the ranks of martyrdom and veterans; 
it obliterated the sin. 

The lofty dream assembly appreciated these words.

literally. At  a  divine  command,  on  the  earth  interposing  between  “ the

Qur’anic justice would not take the life of a single innocent, spill their blood, 

or sacriﬁce him even for all mankind, let alone the majority.

The verse,

One is pure justice. This sublime principle deems equal the individual and 
the community, the person and mankind; divine justice sees no difference 
between them; this is a constant Sunna.

An individual may sacrifice his rights himself, but they cannot be sacrificed 

otherwise, even for all mankind. 

The cancelling of his rights, or the spilling of his blood, or the smearing of 
his name is equal to the cancelling of the rights of all humanity, or the 
besmirching of it, and is its equivalent. 

The second mystery is this: if a selﬁsh man murders an innocent out of greed 
or passion, he will lay waste the whole world if he can, should it be an 
obstacle to his desires, and wipe out all humanity.

Islam Is Peace and Reconciliation,
It Wants No Dispute or Hostility Within

O World of Islam! Your life lies in unity, and if you want unity, your guiding 

principle should be this:

It should be “ This is true, ” rather than “ This alone is true. ” And “ This is 

the best, ” rather than “ This is the only good way. ”

All Muslims should say about his own school and way: “ This is true, I don’t 

interfere with others. If others are good, mine is the best. ”

They should not say: “ This is the only true way, the others are all false. Only 

mine is good, the others are all wrong and unpleasant. ”

The exclusivist mentality arises from love of self. It later becomes a sickness 

and leads to dispute.

The  multiplication  of  ills  and  cures  is  right,  and  right  too  multiplies. The 
increase in the varieties of needs and foods is right, and right becomes 
various.

The increase in capacities and education is right, and right too multiplies. A 

single substance is both poison and the antidote.

The truth is not ﬁxed in secondary matters; it is relative and compound in 

accordance with different temperaments.

The temperaments of the authoritative scholars imparted a share to it, and it 
was realized and compounded accordingly; the founders of the schools 
made judgements in absolute, unspeciﬁc terms.

They  left  it  to  the  various  temperaments  and  their  leanings  to  specify  the 
limits of their schools; but bigoted attachment to them was the cause of 
generalization.

The partisanship arising from this led to dispute. The profound rifts between 

the social classes before Islam,

And their extraordinary distance from each other, demanded a great many 
prophets  at  any  one  time,  and  a  variety  of  sacred  laws,  and  numerous 
schools.

Islam  caused  a  revolution  among  mankind,  and  men  drew  closer  to  each 

other. It reduced to one the sacred law, and there was one Prophet.

But the levels of men were not the same, so the schools of law multiplied. 
When a single training and instruction is sufﬁcient, the schools will unite.

There is Great Wisdom in the Creation and 
Combining of Opposites:
The Sun and a Minute Particle Are Equal in the 
Hand of Power
O  Brother  with  an  alert  heart!  Power  is  manifested  in  the  combining  of 
opposites. Do you know why there is pain in pleasure, evil within good, 
ugliness within beauty, harm within beneﬁt, revenge within beneﬁcence, 
ﬁre within light?

It is so that the relative truths may be established; that there may be many 
things  within  one  thing,  and  that  they  may  ﬁnd  existence  and  become 
apparent. 

Swift motion makes a point into a line. Its being spun at speed makes a ﬂash 

of light, a luminous circle. 

The  function  of  relative  truths  is  that  seeds  should  sprout  in  this  world. 
They form the mud of the universe, the links in its order, the connections 
betweens its inscriptions. 

In the hereafter these relative matters will be truths. The degrees of heat are 

caused by the intervention of cold.

The degrees of beauty come about through the intervention of ugliness. The 

Light is indebted to darkness, pleasure is indebted to pain; there is no health 

cause becomes the reason.

If there were no Paradise, perhaps Hell would not be torment. It cannot be

The Undying Creator demonstrated His wisdom in the creation of opposites. 

His majesty became apparent.

That  Eternal All-Powerful  One  displayed  His  power  in  the  combining  of 

opposites. His tremendousness was manifested.

Since divine power is a necessary inherent quality, and necessarily essential 
to that Pre-Eternal One, it can comprise no opposites, impotence cannot 
intervene in it, there can be no degrees in it, nothing can be difﬁcult for it.
The sun became a niche for the light of His power. The surface of the sea 
became a mirror to the light of the niche, the dewdrops’ eyes all became 
mirrors.

If You Have Any Qualities, They Should Remain in the
Dust of Concealment, So They May Flourish
O man of famous quality! Don’t be oppressive by displaying your qualities; 
if they remain in concealment, you’ll be a source of bounty and blessing

If you appear beneath all your brothers, with the possibility of its being you, 

it will attract respect to each of them.

But if you emerge from concealment and display yourself, although when 
beneath them you were revered, above, you become a tyrant. There you 
were a sun, here you cast shadows.

You belittle your brothers and lose them their respect. That means, to display 
one’s qualities and one’s individuality is doubly tyrannical. If it is thus, 
that is how you will appear.

So what place remains for lying artiﬁciality and hypocrisy, the personality,

perfect order.

An exceptional person draws the veil of concealment over himself within his 
species or group, thus affording it value in the view of others, and making

The Sense of Taste Is a Telegraphist;

Divine dominicality, wisdom, and grace, made two centres with the mouth

That  True  Provider  made  the  sense  of  smell  a  telephone,  and  posted  the 
sense of taste to the telegraph. Out of His mercy, he put an instruction 
sheet on the food: ﬂavour, and colour, and smell.

Thus,  these  three  attributes  are  proclamations,  invitations,  permits,  and 
heralds  on  the  part  of  the  food;  with  them  it  invites  the  needy  and  its 
customers.

He gave taste, sight, and smell to the feeding animals as tools. He adorned 
the foods with various decorations, then soothed their ﬂighty breasts, and 
attracted the indifferent by exciting them. 

When  the  food  enters  the  mouth,  the  sense  of  taste  immediately  sends 
telegraphs  to  every  part  of  the  body.  The  sense  of  smell  telephones, 
giving information about the types of foods.

These senses act according to all the different needs of the different animals 
receiving  food;  the  necessary  preparations  are  made,  or  it  receives  a 
refusal.

Then they throw it out and spit it in your face! Since they have been charged 
with  this  by  wisdom,  don’t  seduce  them  with  pleasure.  Don’t  deceive 
them by gratifying them. 

For then they will forget what true appetite is; false appetite will be born; it 

will strike your head, bringing illness and disease as penalties. 

True pleasure springs from true appetite, true appetite from true need; this 

pleasure is ample for king and beggar alike. 

Moreover,  a  d i n a r   and  a  d i r h e m   are  equal;  the  pleasure  jumbles  them 

together, soothing the pain.

An attribute which for the strong before the weak is considered to be humility, 

if found in the weak, is abasement and hypocrisy.

In  his  ofﬁce,  a  person  of  authority’s  gravity  is  dignity,  and  his  humility 
abasement.  But  in  his  house,  his  humility  is  modesty,  and  his  gravity, 
arrogance.

Tolerance in someone speaking on his own account is patriotism, and self-

sacriﬁce, a quality, a good deed.

But if the person is speaking on account of others, his tolerance is treachery, 

and self-sacriﬁce, an attribute, a wicked act.

In  setting  up  the  preliminaries  reliance  on Allah  is  laziness.  But  handing 
over to Him when reaping the consequences is the reliance taught by the 
Shari‘a.

Contentment  with  one’s  lot  in  respect  of  the  fruits  of  one’s  labour  is 

praiseworthy contentment, and strengthens the desire to work.

But sufﬁcing with existent goods is not desirable contentment, but lack of 

aspiration. There are numerous other examples.

The Qur’an mentions absolute good works and t a q w a . By its indeﬁniteness, it 
hints at the existence of degrees; its conciseness is a detailed explanation; 
its silence, an expansive word.

Both ‘Truth Will Prevail,’ and Its Consequences, 
Are Intended
Friend! One time, a questioner asked: “ Since ‘truth will prevail’ is the truth, 
why have the inﬁdel prevailed over the Muslim, and force over right? ”
I replied: Consider these four points and your difﬁculty will be resolved. The 

ﬁrst point is this. Not every means of every truth has to be true.

Similarly, not every means of every falsehood has to be false. This result 
emerges: a means which is false prevails over a true means. In which case, 
a truth is overcome by a falsehood. It occurs temporarily and indirectly; 
not essentially or permanently.

However, ﬁnally, it is always still the truth’s. Force possesses a truth, there is 

an underlying meaning in its creation. The second point is this:

While it is obligatory that all attributes of all Muslims are Muslim, outwardly 

it is not always thus.

from their unbelief.

Similarly, not all the attributes of all inﬁdels have to be inﬁdel and to arise 

So too, all the attributes of all sinners do not always have to be sinful and to 

have arisen from their sinfulness.

This means an inﬁdel’s Muslim attribute prevails over a Muslim’s unlawful 

attribute. Indirectly, the inﬁdel prevails over him.

Furthermore, in this world the right of life is general and all-embracing. It 
is a universal mercy that has a meaningful manifestation, a wise inner 
purpose, which unbelief does not impede.

The third point is this: two of the All-Glorious One’s attributes of perfection, 
two legislative manifestations: the determining through His choice, which 
proceeds from the attribute of will, and that is the Shari‘a of Creation;

And the well-known Shari‘a, which proceeds from the attribute of speech. 
Just  as  there  is  compliance  and  rebellion  in  the  face  of  the  commands  of 
the  latter,  so  there  is  compliance  and  rebellion  before  the  creational 
commands. 

The reward and punishment for the former is received mostly in the hereafter, 
while the penalties and rewards of the latter are suffered mostly in the 
realm of this world. 

For example, the reward of patience is victory. The penalty for laziness is 

poverty; and the reward of toil is wealth.

The  reward  of  constancy  is  victory.  The  penalty  of  poison  is  illness,  the

has faces looking to both. 

That  means  obedience  to  the  creational  command  is  a  truth.  Obedience 

prevails; rebellion in the face of the injunction is a false stand. 

If a truth has been the means to a falsehood, when it prevails, it will have been 
the means to a falsehood. Indirectly, a truth is defeated by a falsehood, 
but not essentially.

This means that “ the truth prevails ” means “ essentially. ” Also, the end is 

intended, and the restriction of viewpoint is meant. 

The  fourth  point  is  this:  a  truth  remained  unexpressed,  or  powerless,  or 
adulterated, or convoluted. It needed to be expressed and opened up, or 
given fresh strength.

In order to improve and gild it, falsehood had to be temporarily imposed on 

it, in order to to assay that ingot of truth.

Then  it  could  emerge  pure  and  unadulterated  from  its  origins.  Even  if 

falsehood prevails in this world, it cannot win the war. 

( 11:49 ) z y  will strike them a blow! 
So falsehood is defeated. The mystery of “ truth prevails ” inﬂicts punishment 

on it; see, truth prevails!

Low civilization took womankind out of their homes, and turning them into 

common goods, destroyed the respect in which they were held. 

The Shari‘a of Islam mercifully invites them back to their homes. It is there 
they are respected, in their homes they are comfortable, in family life. 
Cleanliness is their adornment; their good character is their splendour; their 
gracious beauty is their chastity; their compassion, their perfection; their 
children, their relaxation. 

With so many tools of corruption, one has to be as strong and unyielding as 

steel to withstand them.

A  beautiful  woman  entering  a  gathering  of  brothers,  arouses  veins  of 
hypocrisy,  rivalry,  envy,  and  selﬁshness.  Slumbering  desires  suddenly 
awaken. 

Increased freedom for women led to a sudden unfolding of bad morality in 
mankind. The represented forms of little smiling corpses have played a

The Scope of Divine Power Rejects 
Intermediaries and Helpers
From the point of view of the comprehensive effectiveness of the disposals 
of the All-Glorious and Powerful One’s power, our sun is like a particle.
There  are  vast  disposals  of  power  in  a  single  realm  of  beings.  Take  the 

gravity between two particles,

Then go and put it beside the gravity between the Sun of Suns and the Milky 

Way.

Bring an angel whose load is a snowﬂake to the radiant angel who holds the 

sun; put a needle-ﬁsh beside a whale; 

Conceive at once of the vast manifestation of the Pre-Eternal All-Powerful 
One of Glory, His perfect art in things from the smallest to the greatest; 
Customary matters like gravity and laws, ﬂuid intermediaries, are only names 

for the manifestation of His power and the disposal of His wisdom;

They  signify  Him  alone;  they  can  have  no  other  meaning;  think  of  them 

together, you will necessarily understand the true cause. 

In the view of that power, apparent intermediaries, helpers, and partners are 

all false, all imaginary and impossible. 

Life  is  the  perfection  of  existence,  its  rank  is  high  and  important. 
Consequently, I say: why should the globe, our world, not be obedient 
and subjugated to it, like an animal?

Living birds of the Pre-Eternal Sovereign of this sort are numerous, spread 

through the arena of space, majestic, beautiful.

Dispersed  through  the  garden  of  creation,  they  spin;  their  refrains,  their 
motion, are words of gloriﬁcation, modes of worship, of the Pre-Eternal 
Undying One, the Eternal All-Wise One. 

The globe resembles a living being, it displays signs of life. If to suppose the 

impossible it was reduced to the size of an egg,

There  is  a  strong  possibility  it  would  become  a  tiny  animal.  If  a  micro-
organism was expanded to the size of the earth, most probably it would 
be just like it.

If the world was reduced to the size of a man, and the stars transformed into 
particles, it is possible it would become a conscious animal, as well as 
intelligent.

This means the world with all its parts is a glorifying servant of the Undying 

Creator, the Eternal All-Powerful One, obedient, subjugated.

To be large quantitatively does not always infer being great qualitatively, for

Shari‘a of Creation
There  are  two  divine  Shari‘as:  proceeding  from  two  attributes,  man  is 

addressed by both and bound to comply with both. 

The Shari‘a of Creation proceeds from the attribute of will, and orders the 
circumstances and motions of the world, the macrocosm, which are not 
voluntary. It is dominical will, and is also wrongly termed nature. 

The  Shari‘a  proceeding  from  the  attribute  of  speech  is  the  code  of  laws 
which orders the actions of man, the microcosm, which are voluntary. 
The two Shari‘as sometimes come together in the same place. The divine 

angels are a vast community, a divine army.

They are obedient bearers of the ﬁrst Shari‘a, workers and representatives. 
Some of them are worshipping slaves of Allah, others throng the divine 
throne in ecstasy.

As Matter Is Reﬁned, Life Is Intensiﬁed
Life is fundamental, basic; matter is dependent on it and subsists through it. 
If you compare a microscopic organism with its ﬁve senses, and man’s 
senses, you will see that however much larger man is than the organism, 
his senses are inferior to the same degree. 

The organism hears its brother’s voice. It sees its food. If it were enlarged to 
the size of a man, its senses would be wondrous, its life dazzling, and the 
sight of it like a lightning ﬂash lighting up the skies.

Man is not a living being composed of dead beings, but a living human cell 

composed of thousands of millions of living cells.

The Qur’an Will Defend Itself and 
Perpetuate Its Sovereignty 1
I saw someone who was stricken by despair, he was sick with pessimism. 
He said: “ The ‘ulama have decreased in number, quantity has replaced 
quality. 

“ I’m frightened our religion will die out one day. ” I replied: So long as the 

universe is not extinguished, Islamic belief will not die. 

Also, so long as the marks of Islam, the minarets of religion, the places of 
divine worship, the works of the Shari‘a, all like nails struck in the face 
of the earth – so long as they are not extinguished, Islam will ever shine.
All  the  mosques  are  instructors,  teaching  their  frequenters;  and  all  the 
instructors  have  become  masters;  through  the  tongue  of  disposition, 
without error or forgetfulness, they instil in them the religion.

All the marks are learned teachers, constantly teaching the spirit of Islam to 
those who look on them. With the centuries, they have become the cause 
of continuity.

The lights of Islam are as though embodied in its marks; and the pure water 
of Islam has solidiﬁed in its places of worship, embodying them – each 
a pillar of belief.

The injunctions of Islam are as though embodied within its works; the pillars 
of  Islam  have  become  petriﬁed  in  its  worlds  –  each  a  diamond  pillar; 
through them the earth and sky are bound together.

Especially the orator of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, a constantly 
repeated pre-eternal discourse; no village, no place at all has remained 
within the Islamic lands

That does not listen to its address, does not hear its teaching. According to 
the  inner  meaning  of  ( 15:9 ) m l k  ,  to  be  a  h a ﬁ z   is  a  very  high 
station. To recite it is worship for men and jinn.

It is for this reason it should be taught, and its incontestable matters mentioned. 
With constant repetition, theoretical matters become incontestable, and 
turn into self-evident facts, not requiring further expounding.

The  essentials  of  religion  ceased  being  theoretical  matters  and  became 
essentials.  To  mention  them  is  sufﬁcient.  To  remind  is  enough.  The 
Qur’an is always a healer.

THE WORDS

The  Islamic  revival  and  social  awakening  provide  evidence  for  everyone 

and a balance, for reminders and mentioning.

Since social life began in Islam, the belief of an individual is not restricted 
to proofs particular to himself; it is based on the conscience. Indeed, it is 
based on innumerable matters in the common heart. 

It is worthy of note, it is difﬁcult to abolish even a weak school of thought 
as  time  passes.  So  what  about  Islam,  which  is  based  on  the  two  ﬁrm 
foundations  of  revelation  and  innate  disposition,  and  has  ruled  so 
effectively for so many centuries!

With  its  ﬁrmly  rooted  principles,  its  profound  works,  it  has  cohered  to 
half  the  globe,  becoming  a  natural  spirit.  If  it  is  now  eclipsed,  it  will 
immediately emerge!

But  regretably  certain  giddy  inﬁdels  with  their  false  arguments  attack  the 
ﬁrm foundations of this lofty palace whenever they ﬁnd the chance.
They try to shake them. But those principles cannot be interfered with, or 
tampered  with;  fall  silent  now,  irreligion!  That  scoundrel  is  bankrupt. 
Enough now, the experiment of disbelief and lies!

The  Islamic  world’s  advance-post  against  the  world  of  unbelief  was  the 
Darülfunun. But due to indifference and heedlessness, the reptilian foe 
of nature

Opened  up  a  breach  behind  the  front;  irreligion  assaulted,  the  nation  was 
well shaken. The advance-post should be a paradise illuminated with the 
spirit of Islam.

It  should  be  the  ﬁrmest,  and  truly  awakened,  or  it  should  not  be  that 
institution. It must not deceive Islam. The heart is the seat of belief; the 
mind is where the light of belief is reﬂected.

Sometimes it is a m u j a h i d , sometimes it is a sweep; if the doubts of the mind 
do not enter the heart, the likelihood is belief and the conscience will not 
be shaken.

For if as some people suppose belief is in the mind, numerous possibilities, 
all pitiless enemies, oppose absolute certainty, which is the spirit of belief.
The heart and conscience are the seat of belief. Intuition and inspiration are 
the  evidence  for  belief. A  sixth  sense,  the  way  of  belief.  Thought  and 
intellect, the watchmen of belief.

Reminding About Incontestable Matters Is Needed,
Rather Than Instruction in Theoretical Ones
The essentials of religion, the incontestable matters of the Shari‘a, are present

The desired result is obtained. Arabic 1 performs this reminder in more lofty 

fashion.

essentials and incontestable matters.

There,  instruction  in  theoretical  matters  is  not  required.  Moreover,  those

principles of cosmic events, the obscure mysteries of the divine truths, 
the unseen matters of revelation, events concealed in the past, and matters 
hidden in the future.

The tongue of the worlds of the Unseen speaks with the Manifest World; it 
discloses its matters symbolically; its aim is mankind, a luminous ﬂash 
of miraculousness.

T h i r d   S o u r c e :  It has a wondrous comprehensiveness in ﬁve aspects. In its 
words, meanings, injunctions, its knowledge, and the balance of its aims.
I t s   w o r d s  contain truly vast possibilities and numerous aspects, yet each is

comprises the ways of all the saints, the illuminations of those versed in 
knowledge of Allah, the schools of those on the Suﬁ way, the ways of the

Its door is open to every era and every class within each. It is as though this 
speech of the Most Merciful is freshly revealed every instant, everywhere.
The Qur’an grows younger as it grows older; its signs become apparent; it 

rends the veil of nature and causes, that divine address.

It sheds the light of divine unity continuously from every verse. It raises the 

veil of the Manifest World, cast over the Unseen. 

The loftiness of its address invites man’s attentive gaze, for it is the tongue

proceeds from this element, an all-encompassing ocean!

Divine condescension to the mind’s of men, to make it familiar. The variety 

of the styles of its revelation makes it familiar to men and jinn.

F i f t h   S o u r c e :  It relates in an original style laden with meaning, as though 
itself had witnessed them, its stories and narrations and truthful accounts, 
making their essential points; 

With them it warns mankind. What it relates is these: it tells of former events, 

and future events, the secrets of Hell and of Heaven;

Truths of the Unseen, and mysteries of the Manifest World, divine mysteries, 

stories about cosmic relations;

Clear stories that neither fact has refuted, nor logic. Even if logic does not 
accept them, it cannot refute them – the revealed books, which are revered 
by all the world.

It relates faithfully the points on which they agree, and mentions in correct 
form  the  subjects  on  which  they  differ. These  matters  issuing  from  an 
unlettered person was a wonder of the time!

S i x t h   E l e m e n t :  It was the founder of the religion of Islam, and comprises 
it.  If  you  investigate  time  and  place,  neither  the  past  was  capable  of 
producing the like of Islam, nor is the future.

This heavenly thread holds the globe in its annual and daily rotations, and 
spins it. It weighed down heavily on the earth and mounted it, but the 
earth still does not give up its rebellion.

S e v e n t h   S o u r c e :  The six lights pouring forth from these six sources blend 
together; from this a beauty becomes apparent, and from this an intuition, 
a luminous means of understanding.

This produces a pleasure: the pleasure of miraculousness may be known, but 
our language is inadequate to describe it. The mind too is defective; that 
celestial star may be seen, but not held.

THE WORDS

For  thirteen  centuries  the  Qur’an’s  enemies  have  desired  to  challenge  it, 
while it has aroused in its friends a desire to imitate it. This too is a proof 
of its miraculousness.

Millions  of Arabic  books  have  been  written  in  consequence  of  these  two 

intense desires, coming into the library of existence.

If they are compared with revelation, if they are weighed up, relying on the 
evidence  of  their  eyes  and  ears  not  only  the  learned  scholar,  even  the 
common man, will declare: “ This is heavenly, those are human! ”

They will also say: “ It doesn’t resemble them, it is not of the same class. 
It is therefore lower than all of them, and this is self-evidently not true.
“ In which case, it is superior to all of them. ” Its meanings in all that time. 
The door is open, dedicated to mankind; it has summoned to itself spirits 
and minds!

Man had power over it, and laid claim to it, but his meanings still could not 
oppose the Qur’an; he never could; now the time of testing has passed.
It  does  not  resemble  other  books,  it  cannot  be  compared  to  them.  For  it 
was dominical wisdom its being revealed bit by bit over twenty years in 
relation to need, in miscellaneous parts.

The immediate causes of revelation were various and distinct. The questions 
about any one matter were repeated and various. The events related to 
injunctions were numerous and changed. The times of revelation were 
distinct and different.

The conditions it was considering were various and different; the groups of 
those it was addressing were numerous and remote from each other; the 
aims of its guidance were graded and various. 

Its structure, and expositions, and replies, and addresses were based on these 
foundations. Yet despite this, its smoothness of style and lack of defect, 
its mutual proportion and harmony, demonstrated its perfection. 

Witness to this is that according to the science of rhetoric, the Qur’an has a 
characteristic not present in other speech: if you listen to other speech, 
you will see the speaker ( or writer ) behind it, or you will ﬁnd him within 
it. Style is the mirror of man.

O dream-questioner! You asked for conciseness, so I have made an indication. 
If you want a detailed exposition, that is beyond my capabilities! A ﬂy 
cannot behold the sky. For of the forty sorts of miraculousness, only one 
is the eloquence of the composition and ordering; and an exposition of it 
did not ﬁt in I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z . 

My  hundred-page  commentary  was  insufﬁcient  for  it.  Rather,  I  want  a 

detailed exposition from spirit-inspirations like yourself!

of meaning, does not gratify the childish, whimsical, and dissolute,

It does not entertain them. In consequence, those raised amid base, dissolute, 

carnal and lusty pleasures will not experience spiritual pleasure.

Looking with the novel-based view of modern literature, which issued from 
Europe, they will neither see nor experience the elevated subtleties, the 
majestic virtues, of the Qur’an.

Their touchstone cannot assay those virtues. There are three areas in which 

literature promenades; it roams within their bounds:

Either  love  and  sorrow,  or  heroism  and  valour,  or  depiction  of  reality.  In 
foreign literature, it does not seek the truth in heroism; it rather instils a 
desire for power by applauding mankind’s cruelties. 

As regards sorrow and love, it does not know true love; it injects into the 

soul a lust-exciting thrill. 

In the question of depicting reality, it does not look on the universe as divine 

art; it does not see it with its hue of the Most Merciful. 

It rather approaches it from the point of view of nature, and depicts it thus; 

and it cannot be freed from this.

For this reason, what it inculcates is love of nature. It instils in the heart a 

feeling of materialism, from which it cannot easily be saved.

Again, that unmannerly literature, both sedative and narcotic, can provide 
no  beneﬁcial  salve  for  the  distress  of  the  spirit  which  arises  from  the 
misguidance resulting from the above.

It has found a single remedy, and that is its novels and ﬁction. Books with 
their dead living, the cinema with its animated corpses. The dead cannot 
bestow life!

And the theatre with its reincarnations and ghosts from the vast grave known 

as the past. It is quite unashamed at these three sorts of its ﬁction.

It has put a mendacious tongue in mankind’s mouth, attached a lustful eye to 
its face, dressed the world in a scarlet petticoat, and does not recognize 
sheer beauty.

If it points to the sun, it puts in the reader’s mind a beautiful blonde actress. 

It apparently says: “ Vice is bad, it is not ﬁtting for man. ”

THE WORDS

It points out its harmful consequences. But its depictions so incite vice that 
they make the mouth water and the reason cannot remain in control.
They  whet  the  appetite,  excite  desire,  so  the  emotions  no  longer  heed 
anything. The literature of the Qur’an, however, does not stir up desire;
It  imparts  a  sense  of  love  of  the  truth,  a  passion  for  sheer  loveliness,  an 
appreciation  and  taste  for  beauty,  a  desire  for  reality. And  it  does  not 
deceive.

It does not look at the universe from the point of view of nature; it speaks 
of it from the point of view of divine art, with the colouring of the Most 
Merciful. It does not confuse the mind.

It instils the light of knowledge of the Maker. It points out His signs in all 
things. Both produce a touching sorrow, but they do not resemble each 
other.

The literature born of Europe excites a pathetic sorrow arising from the lack 

of friends, from being ownerless; not an elevated sorrow.

For  it  is  a  woebegone  sadness  inspired  by  deaf  nature  and  blind  force.  It 

shows the world as desolate, not in any other way.

It depicts it in this way, holds the sorrowing man there, places him ownerless 

among strangers, leaving him without hope.

Due to this feeling of consternation it has given him, he gradually sinks into 
misguidance; it opens up the way to atheism, from whence it is difﬁcult 
to return. Perhaps he never will return.

Qur’anic  literature  produces  a  sorrow,  but  it  is  the  sorrow  of  love,  not  of 
orphans. It arises from separation from friends, not from the lack of them.
Its view of the universe, in place of blind nature, is as conscious, merciful 

divine art; it does not speak of nature.

Instead of blind force, it describes wise and purposeful divine power. The 
universe, therefore, does not take on the form of a desolate wasteland.
Indeed, in the view of the grieving one it addresses, it becomes a gathering of 
friends. On every side mutual love and response, which cause no distress.
The friendliness at every corner draws the melancholy person into society, 
giving  him  a  yearning  sorrow,  an  elevated  feeling;  not  a  dejected 
mournfulness.

Both  give  rise  to  eagerness.  But  through  the  eagerness  provoked  by  the 
foreign literature, the soul becomes excited, the desires are stimulated; 
its gives no joy to the spirit.

The  Qur’an’s  eagerness,  however,  ﬁres  the  spirit,  gives  rise  to  a  lofty 
eagerness. It is for this reason that the Shari‘a of Muhammad ( UWBP ) 
wants no amusements or diversion.

GLEAMS

It has forbidden some musical instruments, for amusement, and permitted 
others. That is to say, instruments producing Qur’anic sorrow or revelational 

eagerness are not harmful.

But if it produces the woebegone grief of the orphan or carnal thrills, the 
instrument is prohibited. It changes from person to person, not everyone 
is the same.

Branches Offer Fruits in the Name of Mercy
On  every  side  the  branches  of  the  tree  of  creation  apparently  extend  the 

fruits of bounties to the hands of beings with spirits.

But in reality it is a hand of mercy, a hand of power, which holds out to us 

those branches and fruits.

You should kiss that hand of mercy in gratitude; you should proclaim the 

holiness of that hand of power thankfully.

An Explanation of the Three Ways
Indicated at the End of Sura al-Fatiha
O brother full of hope! Take your imagination and come with me. See, we 

are in a land, we look around. There is no one to see us.

A layer of black cloud has settled on the high mountains, like tent posts. The 

cloud has covered too the whole face of the earth.

It forms a solid ceiling, but its six sides are open, so the sun is visible. We are 

under the cloud, the darkness oppresses us.

The distress is suffocating, the airlessness is killing us. Now three ways are 
open to us. One is a luminous world, I beheld it once, that metaphorical 
land.

Yes, I came here once before, I have passed down these three ways. The ﬁrst 
way is this: most people take it; it is the way of the world, it invites us to 
travel it.

See, we are on our way, we are going on foot. See how the sea-sands of the 

desert scorch us with their anger, threatening us!

See the mountainous waves; they are threatening us too. Now thanks be to 
Allah we have emerged on the other side, we can see the face of the sun.
But only we know the difﬁculties we have suffered. Oh! we have returned to 
the wasteland, the ceiling of cloud with its lowering darkness. What we 
need is the eye of the heart to illumine things.

834

THE WORDS

A  wondrous  light-ﬁlled  world;  if  you  have  the  courage,  we  shall  enter  it 

together, this way so fraught with dangers. Our second way:

We shall plunge through nature-earth, and pass to the other side. Or trembling, 

we shall pass through a natural tunnel. 

I  travelled  this  way  one  time,  fearlessly  and  full  of  prayer.  But  on  that 
occasion I had with me a substance to smelt and rend the nature-earth. 
The third way: The Qur’an had given me that miraculous evidence. Brother, 

stick close behind me, and have no fear! 

See, here await us tunnel-like caves and underground torrents. They will let 
us pass. Don’t let these awesome lifeless beings of nature scare you in 
the slightest! 

For  behind  its  sour  face  is  the  smiling  countenance  of  its  compassionate 
Owner. I perceived that radium-like substance of the Qur’an through its 
light. 

There, you see! We have come out in the light-ﬁlled world, see this delicate 
earth,  this  soft  and  gentle  air.  Raise  your  head!  See,  it  has  drawn  its 
head to the skies, rent the clouds, leaving them far below. This Tuba tree 
invites us – 

It is the Qur’an. It has spread its branches everywhere. We must hang onto 

this branch which is trailing down, so that it can raise us up.

That heavenly tree – on earth, one of its personiﬁcations is the Illustrious 
Shari‘a. That  is  to  say,  we  ascended  to  this  world  of  light  in  that  way 
without difﬁculty; we were shaken by no distress.

Since  we  went  wrong,  we’ll  return  to  our  former  place  and  ﬁnd  the  right 
way. See, our third way! Over the mountains hovers a royal falcon; 
He  is  reciting  the  ezan  to  the  whole  world.  See,  the  supreme  muezzin, 
Muhammad al-Hashimi ( UWBP ), is summoning mankind to the lumi-
nous world of light. He enjoins supplication and obligatory prayers.
Look at the mountains! See, the guidance has rent the clouds! The mountains 
of the Shari‘a have raised their heads to the skies. How they have adorned 
the face and eye of the earth!

Now we must depart from here in the aircraft of endeavour. The light and 
breeze are there; the light of beauty is there. Ah, now here is the Uhud of 
divine unity, that mighty mountain.

Here is the Judi of Islam, that wholesome mountain. Here is the Mountain of 
the Moon, the Qur’an of al-Azhar, the pure water of the Nile ﬂows from 
that sublime source. Take a drink of its sweet water!

Friend! Now cast away your imagination and don your reason! The ﬁrst 
two ways are those of A @ and ( 1:7 )C
Their perils are numerous. On them is perpetual winter, their autumn and 
summer. Only one out of a hundred is saved, like Plato and Socrates. 
The third way is easy, and direct and straight. Weak and strong are equal. 
Everyone may take it. The most comfortable is this: to be either martyr 
or veteran.

Now we come to the conclusion: Yes, the ﬁrst two ways are the path and 
school of the genius of science. As for the guidance of the Qur’an, the 
third way is its straight path; it will take us there.

All True Pain Lies in Misguidance, 
and All True Pleasure in Belief;
A Mighty Truth Robed in Imagination

Prudent fellow-traveller! My friend! If you want to see clearly the differences 
beween the luminous way of the “ s t r a i g h t   p a t h  ” and the gloomy path of 
A @ and C
Come, take your fancy and mount your imagination, together we shall go to 
the darkness of non-existence. We shall visit that vast grave, that city of 
the dead.

A Pre-Eternal All-Powerful One took us out of that place of darkness with 
His hand of power, mounted us on existence, and sent us to this world, 
this city without pleasures.

Now we have come to the world of existence, this fearful desert. Our eyes 

have opened, we’ve looked in the six directions.

Firstly we look before us seeking favours, but tribulations and pains assault 

us like enemies. We take fright at that and draw back.

We look to left and right to the natural elements, seeking assistance. But we 
see their hearts are hard and merciless. They grind their teeth, glowering 
at us angrily. They heed neither plea nor plaint.

Like creatures beleaguered, we despairingly lift our gazes upwards. Seeking 
help, we look to the heavenly bodies, but they threaten us awesomely.

836

THE WORDS

As though each were a bomb; having shot out of their cases they are speed-
ing through space. But somehow or other they do not obstruct each other.
If by chance one confused its way, this Manifest World would be blown to 
pieces, Allah forbid! It is tied to coincidence; no good can come of that.
In despair we turn back our gaze from that direction, overcome by grievous 
bewilderment. We bow our heads and look to ourselves; we consider and 
study ourselves. 

Now we hear the shouts of myriad needs coming from our wretched selves. 
The cries of thousands of wants issue forth. While expecting solace, we 
take fright.

No good comes from that either. Seeking refuge, we consult our consciences, 
we look within seeking a solution. Alas, again we can ﬁnd none; we have 
to help the conscience.

For  in  it  are  thousands  of  hopes,  turbulent  emotions,  wild  desires,  spread 
throughout the universe. We tremble with all of them, and can offer no 
help.

Compressed in the world of existence, those hopes stretch out to pre-eternity 
on one side and post-eternity on the other. They have such breadth, if they 
swallowed the world, the conscience still would not be satisﬁed.

Wherever we have recourse on this grievous road, we encounter misfortune. 
For the ways of “ t h o s e   w h o   h a v e   r e c e i v e d   Yo u r   a n g e r  ” and “ t h o s e   w h o  
h a v e   g o n e   a s t r a y  ” are thus. Chance and misguidance beset that road.
We follow it and fall into our present state. Even now we temporarily forget 

its beginning and end, the Maker and resurrection of the dead.

It is worse than Hell, it scorches more terribly, it crushes our spirits. For we 

had recourse to those six directions, but this state resulted.

It ﬁlls us with awesome terror, making us shudder with impotence, disquiet 
and apprehension, orphanhood and despair, so that it racks our conscience.
Now we shall form a front opposite each of the directions and try to repulse 
them.  Firstly  we  have  recourse  to  our  own  strength,  but  alas!  we  are 
powerless, weak. 

Secondly, we address ourselves to silencing the needs of the soul. But alas! 

we see that they cry out unceasingly.

Thirdly, we cry out for help seeking a saviour, but no one hears or responds. 
We  suppose  everything  to  be  hostile,  everything  strange.  Nothing 
consoles our hearts, nothing gives a sense of security, or true pleasure.
Fourthly, the more we looked at the celestial bodies, the more they ﬁlled us 
with fright and awe. Vexing the conscience, alienating it; tormenting the 
mind, ﬁlling it with delusions.

Brother!  That  is  the  way  of  misguidance!  On  it  we  experienced  all  the 
darkness  of  unbelief.  Come,  now,  my  brother,  we’ll  turn  again  to  that 
non-being.

Again we shall come. This time our way is the Straight Path, and the way of 
belief. Our guide and leader are wisdom and the Qur’an, the falcon that 
overﬂies the centuries.

At  one  time,  the  Pre-Eternal  Sovereign’s  mercy  and  grace  willed  our 
existence, His power brought us forth, graciously mounting us on the law 
of His will, completing us stage after stage.

Then it compassionately clothed us in the garment of existence, bestowed 
on  us  the  Trust  and  its  rank;  the  mark  of  this  is  supplication  and  the 
obligatory prayers.

All the stages are stopping-places on our long road. To make our road easy, 
divine  determining  issued  a  decree  and  pasted  it  on  the  page  of  our 
foreheads;

Wherever we go, with whichever group we are guests, we are welcomed in 
truly brotherly fashion. We give of our belongings and we receive from 
theirs.

Love born of commerce, they nourish us, adorn us with gifts, then they see 
us on our way. Now at last we have come to the door of the world. We 
hear a noise.

See,  we  have  arrived  at  the  earth.  We  have  stepped  foot  in  the  Manifest 
World.  The  festival  of  the  Most  Merciful,  the  clamorous  habitation  of 
man.

We know nothing at all, our guide and leader is the will of the Merciful One. 
Our guide’s deputy, our delicate eyes. We open our eyes and look around. 
Do we recall the ﬁrst time we came?

We were strangers, orphans. Our enemies were many. We did not know our 
protector. Now, with the light of belief, we have a strong pillar, a point of 
support, a protector, who repulses those enemies.

And that is belief in Allah, which is the light of our spirits, and light of our 
lives, and spirit of our spirits. Now our hearts are easy, we disregard the 
enemies, not even recognizing them. 

When  on  our  ﬁrst  journey  we  consulted  our  consciences,  we  heard 

innumerable cries and laments, and complaints.

It was due to them that we were overcome by misfortune. For our hopes and 
desires, capacity, and senses always desire eternity. But we did not know 
how to obtain it, hence their lamentations and cries.

However, all praise be to Allah, this time we have found a source of succour 

838

THE WORDS

which  always  gives  life  to  our  innate  disposition  and  hopes;  it  makes 
them take ﬂight for eternity.

Our innate disposition shows them the way from that source, and seeks help; 
drinks  down  the  water  of  life,  and  races  to  its  perfection  through  that 
source of succour, that encouraging, elusive symbol.

The  second  pole  of  belief  is  afﬁrmation  of  the  resurrection  of  the  dead. 
Everlasting happiness is that shell’s pearl. The proof of belief, the Qur’an; 
the conscience, a human mystery.

Now raise your head, and take a look at the universe. Speak a word with it. 
It appeared formidable on our former way. Now it is smiling, laughing on 
every side, coyly winking and blinking.

Do  you  not  see,  our  eyes  have  become  bees? They  ﬂy  everywhere  in  the 
garden  of  the  universe,  around  the  profusion  of  ﬂowers;  each  ﬂower 
profers them a delectable draft.

Each also offers solace, love, and a feeling of familiarity. They too give and 
take, and offer testimony, they make honey ﬂow forth from honey, that 
mysterious falcon.

As  our  gaze  alights  on  the  motions  of  the  heavenly  bodies,  or  the  stars, 
or  suns,  they  show  up  the  Creator’s  wisdom,  and  the  manner  of  His 
instruction, and the manifestation of His mercy, making them take ﬂight.
It is as though the sun is speaking with us, saying: “ My brothers! Don’t feel 
frightened  or  dismayed. You  are  welcome,  how  good  you  have  come! 
This dwelling-place is yours, I am but a candle-holder.

“ I am like you, but a pure, obedient, unrebellious servant. Out of His utter 
mercy,  the  Single  and  Eternally  Besought  One  subjected  me  so  that  I 
would serve you with my light. Light and heat are from me, supplication 
and prayer from you! ”

Now  look  at  the  moon! And  the  stars  and  the  seas;  each  says  in  its  own 
tongue: “ Welcome! It’s good you’ve come! Don’t you recognize us? ”
Look through the mystery of co-operation, through the signs of the order. 
Each says: “ We are all servants, mirrors of the All-Glorious One’s mercy; 
don’t worry, don’t be dismayed!

“ Don’t feel frightened or sceptical at the crashing of the thunder and cries 
of events, for within them are the rolling of recitations, the clamour of 
gloriﬁcations, the tumult of supplication and entreaty.

“ The All-Glorious One Who sent us to you holds their reins in His hands. 
The eye of faith reads on their faces the signs of mercy; each proclaims 
them. ”

O believer with a wakeful heart! Let our eyes rest a little; we shall hand over 
our sensitive ears to the blessed hand of belief in their place. We shall 
send them to the world to listen to its delightful refrains.

The universal mourning and lamentations of death imagined on our ﬁrst way 

are now all supplications and orisons, cries of gloriﬁcation.

Listen to the murmuring of the air, the twittering of chicks, the pattering of 
the rain, the plashing of the seas, the crashing of thunder, the crackling of 
stones; all are meaningful refrains.

The humming of the air, the intoning of the thunder, the strains of the waves 
are all recitations of Grandeur. The chanting of the rains, the warbling of 
birds are all gloriﬁcations of Mercy, allusions to reality.

The sounds of things are all sounds of existence: “ I too exist, ” they say. The 
silent universe suddenly ﬁnds voice: “ Don’t suppose us to be lifeless, O 
chattering man! ”

A tasty morsel or droplet of rain; the birds break into song.
With their different voices, their tiny songs, they applaud mercy, alight on 

bounties, proclaiming their thanks.

Implicitly they say: “ Beings of the universe, my brothers! How ﬁne are our 

circumstances;

We are tenderly nourished, we are happy at our lot. ” With beaks upstretched 

they scatter their songs on the air.

In its entirety the universe is a lofty orchestra; through the light of belief its 

recitations, its gloriﬁcations, are heard.

For its wisdom rejects the existence of chance, its order repulses it; in unison 

they banish doubt.

Fellow-traveller!  We  are  leaving  now  this  world  of  similitudes,  stepping 
down from imagination and fancy. We shall alight in the arena of reason, 
take stock, and close down those ways.

Our  ﬁrst  way,  full  of  pain,  that  of A @  and C  inﬂicts 
suffering on the innermost conscience, and severe pain. Consciousness 
showed this; we became the reverse of conscious.

We have to be saved from it, we need to be, so the pain can be paciﬁed, or 
numbed, we can’t endure it otherwise; no one heeds the cries for help.
Guidance is healing, but fancies block out the feelings. This requires solace, 
it  requires  feigned  unmindfulness,  it  requires  occupation,  it  requires 
entertainment. Enchanting desires.

Then it can deceive the conscience and put the spirit to sleep so they feel no 
pain. Otherwise that grievous suffering scorches the conscience; the pain 
is unendurable, the despair cannot be borne.

840

THE WORDS

This means, however far one deviates from the Straight Path, to that extent 
one  is  affected  in  that  way,  causing  the  conscience  to  cry  out.  Within 
every pleasure is a pain, a taint.

That  means  glittering  civilization,  which  is  a  mixture  of  fancy,  lust, 
amusement,  and  licentiousness,  is  a  deceptive  panacea  for  the  ghastly 
distress arising from misguidance, a poisonous narcotic.

My dear friend! On our second way, that light-ﬁlled road, we perceived a 
state of mind in which life became a source of pleasure, pains became 
joys.

We understood that it imparts a state to the spirit varying in degree according 
the strength of belief. The body receives pleasure through the spirit, the 
spirit receives pleasure through the conscience.

An immediate pleasure is felt in the conscience; a spiritual paradise is present 
in the heart. To think of it is to open it up; while consciousness is marked 
by its secrets.

Now,  however  much  the  heart  is  aroused,  the  conscience  stimulated,  the 
spirit  stirred,  it  increases  the  pleasure,  transforming ﬁre  into  light,  and 
winter into spring.

The  doors  of  paradises  open  up  in  the  conscience,  the  world  becomes  a 
paradise. Within it our spirits take ﬂight, soaring like kites, entreating, 
praying.

Worthy  fellow-traveller!  Farewell  for  now.  Let  us  offer  a  prayer  together, 

then we shall part, to meet again!

Reply to the Anglican Church 
One time, as a artiﬁce, a pitiless enemy of Islam, a cunning politician, 
a suspicious parson who wanted to swagger and show off, asked us four 
things:  in  the  form  of  denial,  at  a  terrible  time  he  had  his  claws  at  our 
throat, in his glee at our misfortune; he wanted six hundred words. A reply 
was needed like a slap in the face of his glee, and his wiles, and his denial, 
like spitting in his face, to silence him. I won’t address him. I have the fol-
lowing answer for a lover of truth. 

He asked ﬁrst: “ What is the religion of Muhammad ( UWBP )? ” 
I replied: It is the Qur’an. The basic aims of the Qur’an are the six pillars 

of belief and the ﬁve pillars of Islam. 

In the second he asked: “ What has it given to life and thought? ” 
I replied: To thought, the afﬁrmation of divine unity; to life, moderation 

and the middle way. My witnesses for this are 

( 112 :11 )   [ Z Y     ( 112:1 ) $ # " ! 
In the third, he said: “ What remedies has it for the present atrocities? ” 
I replied: The prohibition of usury and interest and the payment of z a k a t . 

My witnesses for this are these: 

     ( 2:275 ) ; : 9 8 7   ( 2:276 ) V U T 
( 2:43 ) n m l k
In the fourth, he asked: “ How does it look on man’s revolutions? ” 
I replied: Labour, striving, are fundamental. Wealth should not be accu-

mulated in the hands of tyrants, and held on to. My witnesses for this:
