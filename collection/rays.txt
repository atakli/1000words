The Second Ray

The Final Fruit of Eskişehir Prison
The Second Ray of the Thirty-First Flash 

This Ray was written sixteen years ago at a time I remained 
alone  in  Eskişehir  Prison  after  my  friends  had  been  released. 
It was written at great speed with my own very deﬁcient pen 
at a distressing, disagreeable time, and is therefore somewhat 
lacking  in  order.  Still,  I  saw  when  correcting  it  recently  that 
in  respect  of  belief  and  the  afﬁrmation  of  divine  unity  it  is 
extremely valuable, powerful, and important.

S a î d   N u r s î  

[ The  seventh  paramount  point  about  the  greatest  name  of 
Allah, The One, and the seventh of the six points elucidating 
the six greatest names.1 ] 

NOTE

In my view, this treatise holds great importance, for the signiﬁcant and 
subtle mysteries of belief that it contains unfold and develop. The person 
who reads and understands it will save his belief, Allah willing. Unfortu-
nately I have been unable to meet with anyone here so have been unable to 
write out a fair copy myself. If you want to understand the treatise’s value, 
ﬁrst of all read the Second and Third Fruits of the First Station carefully and 
the Conclusion at the end and the matter in the two pages preceding that, 
then study the whole of it slowly!

THE SEVENTH OF THE SIX POINTS ABOUT THE SIX
GREATEST NAMES, ABOUT “ ALLAH, THE ONE ”

(cid:2)(cid:3)

 ﯖﮑ(cid:193) ِ(cid:151)َ(cid:99) ْ(cid:127)َ(cid:178) ِهِ(cid:92) َو

Inspired by one splendid meaning of the verse,

( 47:19 )  á à ß Þ Ý Ü
and  by  a  famous  oath  of  the  Prophet  ( UWBP ),  this  treatise  consists  of  a 
subtle  point  I  perceived  about  three  beautifully  sweet  and  subtle  fruits  of 
the afﬁrmation of divine unity, and three matters necessitating it, and three 
proofs of it.

ّ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:111)ُ(cid:174) 

ُسْ(cid:159)َ(cid:178) ى ِذَ

The oath Allah’s Most Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) most  frequently used 
ّ(cid:170)اَو 1 which shows that even the furthermost tips of 
was: ِه ِدَ(cid:193)ِ(cid:92)  ٍد َ
the tree of the universe, and its broadest extent, and its minor particulars, 
exist through the power and will of the Single One of Unity. For if the most 
choice and exceptional of creatures, Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ), does not own himself, and if he is not free to act as he wishes 
and is tied in his actions to another’s will, certainly, nothing, no function, 
state  or  circumstance,  whether  particular  or  universal,  can  be  outside  the 
power of that all-encompassing will.

Yes, what this meaningful oath of Muhammad  ( UWBP ) indicates is the 
mighty,  all-encompassing  unity  of  dominicality.  We  refer  the  details  and 
proofs of this elevated truth to the Risale-i Nur, which is The Illuminating 
Lamp (S i r a c ü ’ n - N u r ), 2 since in it are set forth and explained a hundred, per-
haps a thousand, clear proofs of divine unity. In this Second Ray, in the ﬁrst 
of the three brief stations contained in this most important truth of belief,

three subtle, sweet, precious, and luminous universal fruits out of innumer-
able  fruits  will  be  explained  in  summary  fashion,  thereby  alluding  to  the 
insights and experiences which impelled my heart to those fruits.

In the Second Station, three universal matters and motives necessitating 
this sacred truth are explained, which have the power of three thousand such 
matters.

In the Third Station, three signs pointing to this truth of divine unity are 
mentioned, which have the power of three hundred signs, indications, and 
proofs.

First Fruit

The First Fruit of the First Station

It is in divine unity (v a h d e t ) and its afﬁrmation (t e v h i d ) that divine beauty 
and dominical perfection become apparent. If there were no unity that pre-
eternal treasury would remain hidden. Yes, it is only in the mirror of unity 
and in the manifestation of the divine names concentrated by means of unity 
in the faces of particulars at the extremities of the tree of creation that inﬁnite 
divine beauty and perfection, unending dominical excellence and loveliness, 
the incalculable bounties and gifts of the Merciful One, and the utterly per-
fect beauty of that Eternally Besought One, are all to be seen.

For example, when the particular act of sending to the assistance of a 
powerless infant lacking will, pure white milk from an unexpected place, 
that is, from between blood and excrement, is considered from the point of 
view of the afﬁrmation of divine unity, suddenly, through the wondrous, 
tender sustaining of all infants and young and their subjugating their moth-
ers to themselves, the undying beauty of the Most Merciful’s mercy is seen 
in  all  its  splendour.  If  not  beheld  through  the  eyes  of  divine  unity,  that 
beauty is hidden and that particular providing of sustenance is ascribed to 
causes, chance, and nature, thus losing all its value and even transforming 
its very nature.

Also, for example; if the healing of one dreadful disease is considered 
from  the  point  of  view  of  the  afﬁrmation  of  divine  unity,  on  the  face  of 
the bestowal of healing on all the sick in the huge hospital called the earth 
through  the  remedies  and  medicines  from  the  vast  pharmacy  called  the 
world, the beautiful compassion of the Absolutely Compassionate One and 
the acts of His mercy become apparent in universal and splendid fashion. 
If not considered in respect of the afﬁrmation of divine unity, that particu-
lar but knowledgeable, perceptive, and conscious bestowal of healing will 
be attributed to the properties of lifeless medicines and to blind force and 

16

THE RAYS

unconscious nature; its character will be completely changed and it will lose 
its wisdom and value.

I am explaining here because of its relevance a point which occurs to me 
about a benediction for the Prophet ( UWBP ). It concerns the well-known 
prayer that is recited regularly by the Shaﬁ‘i’s at the end of the tesbihat fol-
lowing the ﬁve daily prayers: 

  ٍءاَوَدَو  ٍءاَد  ّ

ِلﯭﯦ ِدَدَ(cid:151)ِ(cid:92)  ٍد َ

ّ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:111)ُ(cid:174) اَ(cid:178) ِدّ

ِ(cid:193)َ(cid:126)  ِلٰا ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150)َو  ٍد َ
 اًر(cid:193)ِ(cid:103)ﯬﯦ اًر(cid:193)ِ(cid:103)ﯬﯦ ْمـِ(cid:183)ْ(cid:193)َ(cid:171)َ(cid:150)َو ِهْ(cid:193)َ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) ْمـّ

ّ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:111)ُ(cid:174) اَ(cid:178) ِدّ
ِ(cid:171)َ(cid:126)َو  ْكِراَ(cid:92)َو

ِ(cid:193)َ(cid:126) ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150)  ّ

ِلَ(cid:134) َ

ّمـُ(cid:183)ٰ
ّ(cid:171)(cid:170)َا

It is important because due to the wisdom in the creation of human beings 
and the mystery of their comprehensiveness, every moment they entreat their 
Creator and seek refuge with Him, and offer Him thanks and praise. Just as 
illnesses are the most effective whip driving them to the divine court, so the 
chief of the sweet bounties prompting him to give thanks earnestly and to 
truly offer praise gratefully are remedies, healing, and good health. For this 
reason the benediction is most meaningful and widely accepted. Sometimes 
when reciting   ٍءاَوَدَو  ٍءاَد  ّ
ِلﯭﯦ ِدَدَ(cid:151)ِ(cid:92) I see the earth in the form of a hospital 
and sense the clearly obvious existence of the True Healer Who supplies the 
remedies for all ills, physical and spiritual, and answers all needs, and His 
universal clemency and sacred all-embracing compassion.

Also  for  example;  if  the  bestowal  of  guidance  and  belief  on  someone 
who  experiences  the  ghastly  pains  of  misguidance  is  considered  from  the 
point of view of divine unity, the pre-eternal beauty of One Muniﬁcent and 
Generous becomes apparent on the face of that supreme gift. For that beauty 
transforms the insigniﬁcant, transitory, and impotent person into the slave-
addressee of the One True Object of Worship, Who is the Creator and Sov-
ereign of all the universe, and through his belief bestows on him – and on 
all believers according to their degree – eternal happiness and a broad and 
splendid everlasting world and property. One ﬂash of that unfading beauty 
is such that it makes all believers love it and the elite enamoured of it and 
captivated by it. If such an event is not considered from the point of view of 
divine unity, the person’s particular belief will be attributed either to him-
self, as with the self-centred and self-opinionated Mu‘tazilites, or to causes. 
Then that sparkling gem of the Most Merciful, the true price and value of 
which is Paradise, will be devalued to the worthlessness of a piece of glass 
and will no longer reﬂect the ﬂashes of that sacred beauty.

Thus,  it  may  be  seen  from  these  three  examples  that  the  innumerable 
sorts and varieties of divine beauty and dominical perfection are apparent in 
the particular beings at the extremities of the sphere of multiplicity, and in 
all their states and conditions, and by reason of divine beauty and perfection 
being concentrated in them through divine unity their certain existence are 
understood and established.

It is because divine beauty and perfection are to be seen with the heart 
in  the  afﬁrmation  of  divine  unity  and  perceived  by  the  spirit  that  all  the 
saints and puriﬁed ones have found their sweetest illuminations and most 
َ(cid:202) the profes-
delectable spiritual sustenance in repeated recitation of  ُ
sion of divine unity. And it is because divine grandeur and magniﬁcence, 
divine glory, and the absolute sovereignty of the dominicality of the Eter-
nally  Besoughted  One  are  realized  in  the  profession  of  divine  unity  that 
Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) declared: 

ّ(cid:202)ِا َهٰ(cid:170)ِا  ٓ

ّ(cid:195)ا  َ

ّ(cid:195)ا  َ

ّ(cid:193)ِ(cid:93)َ
Yes, although a small bounty, gift and sustenance like a ﬂower, a fruit, 
or a light is a tiny mirror, through the mystery of divine unity each suddenly 
stands shoulder to shoulder with all its fellows and joins with them. Being 
transformed into a large mirror, its species displays the sort of divine beauty 
which is manifested on it. With transient, ﬂeeting beauty it points to an ever-
lasting, undying beauty. As Mawlana Jalal al-Din 2 said:

ْ(cid:219) ْ(cid:248)َا ا َ(cid:239)ـ ُ(cid:236)  ِنאَ(cid:221) ْ(cid:248)(cid:307)ُ(cid:214)  ِنאَ(cid:314)و

(cid:315) َ(cid:236)  ْنٓ ا

it becomes a mirror to divine beauty. If not for the mystery of the afﬁrmation 
of divine unity, each particular fruit would remain on its own, and would 
show neither that sacred beauty nor its elevated perfection. Even the par-
ticular ﬂash of beauty within it would be extinguished and would vanish. 
It would quite simply become its opposite; from being a diamond, it would 
turn into glass.

Also,  through  the  mystery  of  the  afﬁrmation  of  divine  unity,  in  living 
beings, which are the fruits of the tree of creation, is a divine personality, a 
dominical oneness, an immaterial face of the Most Merciful deﬁned by the 
seven attributes, a concentration of the names, and the manifestation of the 
determination and personiﬁcation of the One Who is addressed by the words

( 1:5 )  5 4 3 2  Otherwise that personality, that oneness, 
that  face,  the  manifestation  of  that  determination  would  expand  to  the 
extent of the universe, disperse and be hidden. It would be seen only with 
eyes of the heart that were truly vast and comprehensive. For the magniﬁ-
cence of divine grandeur would veil it; not everyone could see it with the 
eye of the heart.

Also, it is clearly understood from those particular living beings that their 
Maker sees them, knows them, hears them, and does as He wishes. Quite 
simply, behind the createdness of each living being, the immaterial personi-
ﬁcation and determination of one who has power and will, hears, sees and 
knows, is apparent to one who believes.

Especially behind the createdness of human beings from among living 
creatures, through belief and through the mystery of divine unity, that imma-
terial personiﬁcation and determination are to be observed in extremely clear 
fashion. For samples of meanings such as knowledge, power, life, hearing, 
and sight, which are the bases of that personiﬁcation of oneness, are present 
in human beings, and they indicate them through those samples. For exam-
ple, the being who bestows the eyes, both sees the eye, and, a subtle mean-
ing, sees what the eye sees, then he bestows them. For sure, the oculist who 
makes  some  spectacles  for  your  eyes,  sees  that  they  are  suitable,  then  he 
makes  them.  And  the  being  who  bestows  the  ears,  surely  hears  what  the 
ears hear, then he makes them and bestows them. Examples for the other 
attributes may be made in the same way.

Also, human beings bear the impresses and manifestations of the names; 

through them, they testify to those sacred meanings.

Also, through their weakness, impotence, poverty, and ignorance, human 
beings act as mirrors in another way; they testify to the power, knowledge, 
will, and other attributes of the one who has pity on their weakness and pov-
erty, and comes to their aid.

Thus,  since  through  the  mystery  of  divine  unity,  a  thousand  and  one 
divine names are concentrated in the furthest points and most scattered par-
ticulars of the sphere of multiplicity, in the tiny missives known as living 
beings, and are to be read most clearly, the All-Wise Maker multiplies the 
copies  of  them  extensively.  He  makes  exceedingly  numerous  and  various 
the copies of the species of small living beings in particular, and publishes 
them everywhere.

a n d   e x p e r i e n c e .  It was like this:

At one time, due to my excessive feelings of pity, sympathy and kind-
ness, I was exceedingly touched and sorry for living beings, and of them, 
intelligent  beings  and  human  beings,  and  particularly  the  oppressed  and 
disaster-stricken. I exclaimed from my very heart: “ Neither these monoto-
nous  laws  which  prevail  over  the  world  hear  the  woes  of  these  power-
less and weak unfortunates, nor do the overwhelming, deaf elements and 
events hear them. Is there no one to take pity on their wretched state and 
intervene  in  their  particular  plights? ”  My  spirit  was  crying  out  from  its 
very depths. My heart called out with all its strength: “ Do these ﬁne crea-
tures, these valuable goods, these yearning and grateful friends, have no 
owner, no master, no true friend who will look to their business, accom-
pany them and protect them? ”

The satisfying, soothing, and sufﬁcient answer to the cries of my spirit 
and tumult of my heart was this: through the mystery of the Qur’an and light 
of belief and the mystery of divine unity, I perceived the particular favours 
and special assistance of the All-Glorious One, Who is All- Merciful and 
Compassionate,  above  the  law,  to  those  lovable  creatures  who  weep  and 
lament under the pressure of universal laws and the assaults of events; and 
His particular dominicality towards everything directly; and the facts that 
He  Himself  directs  everything  personally  and  listens  to  the  plaints  of  all 
things; and that He is the true owner, protector, and master of everything. I 
felt an inﬁnite joy in place of endless despair. In my view all living beings 
gained in importance and value augmented a thousand times by being totally 
owned by such a Glorious Owner and connected to Him.

For  since  everyone  takes  pride  in  their  master’s  honour  and  fame  and 
in the rank of the person to whom they are attached and acquire a dignity, 
through the unfolding of this relation through the light of belief and the state 
of being owned, and due to its strength, an ant vanquished the Pharaoh and 
could feel the pride of a thousand Pharaohs, who were heedless, imagined 
themselves to be independent and to own themselves, and had overweening 
pride – which was extinguished at the door of the grave –  at their forefathers 
and the land of Egypt. And in the face of Nimrod’s pride, which changed 
into torment and shame when he tasted the pangs of death, the ﬂy pointed to 
the pride of its own relationship, reducing Nimrod’s to nothing.

The  verse,  ( 31:13 )   D C B A    states  that  it  is  an  inﬁnite 
wrong to associate partners with Allah. Assigning partners to Allah is a vast 

20

crime because it transgresses the rights, honour, and dignity of all creatures. 
Only Hell can cleanse it.

Second Fruit

The Second Fruit of the Afﬁrmation of Divine Unity
The First Fruit considered the Most Pure and Holy One, the Creator of 
the Universe, now this Second Fruit considers the universe and its essen-
tial nature. Yes, through the mystery of divine unity the perfections of the 
universe are realized; and the elevated duties of beings are understood; the 
results of the creation of beings are established; the value of creatures are 
known; the divine purposes in the world ﬁnd existence; the instances of wis-
dom in the creation of living beings and conscious beings become apparent; 
behind the stern, angry faces of the violent storms of upheaval and change 
the smiling, beautiful faces of mercy and wisdom are seen; and such numer-
ous existences of transitory beings as their results, identities, true natures, 
spirits, and gloriﬁcations, which they leave in their places in the Manifest 
World before they depart, are known.

Furthermore, only through the mystery of divine unity is the universe as 
a whole known to be a meaningful book of the Eternally Besought One; and 
all beings from the ground to the divine throne to be a miraculous collection 
of divine missives; and all the realms of creatures to be a magniﬁcent regular 
dominical army, and all sorts of beings from microbes and ants to rhinocer-
oses, eagles, and planets to be diligent ofﬁcials of the Pre-Eternal Sovereign, 
and since they act as mirrors to and have a relation with that Sovereign, the 
value of all things are understood to inﬁnitely surpass their individual value; 
and  the  answers  are  revealed  of  the  unsolved,  abstruse  questions  “ Where 
do this ﬂood of beings and these caravans of creatures come from? Where 
are they going? Why did they come? And what are they doing? ” Otherwise, 
these  elevated  perfections  of  the  universe  would  vanish  and  those  lofty, 
sacred truths be transformed into their opposites.

It is because the crimes of ascribing partners to Allah and disbelief con-
stitute aggression against all the universe’s perfections and its sacred truths 
and  the  elevated  rights  of  beings  that  the  universe  becomes  angry  at  the 
disbelievers and idolators. The heavens and earth become wrathful, and the 
elements unite to destroy them, overwhelming and submerging those who 
ascribe partners to Allah, such as Noah’s people and the ‘Ad and Thamud 
peoples, and the Pharaoh. In accordance with the verse,

( 67:8 ) { z y x

THE SECOND RAY – FIRST STATION

21

Hell so rages and fumes at the disbelievers and ascribers of partners to Allah 
that it almost bursts apart. Yes, to associate partners with Allah is a terrible 
insult to the universe and a great transgression against it. It insults their hon-
our by denying the sacred duties of beings and the purposes of their creation. 
To illustrate this, we shall allude to one example out of thousands.

For example, through the mystery of divine unity the universe resembles 
a huge, corporeal angel; glorifying and sanctifying its Maker with hundreds 
of  thousands  of  heads  to  the  number  of  species  of  beings,  and  with  hun-
dreds of thousands of mouths to the number of members of those species, 
and with hundreds of thousands of tongues in every mouth to the number 
of  organs,  parts,  and  cells  of  those  members  –  a  wondrous  collection  of 
elevated  creatures  engaged  in  worship  like  the  Angel  Israﬁl.  Through  the 
mystery of divine unity, the universe is also an arable ﬁeld yielding copious 
crops for the worlds and dwelling places of the hereafter; a factory produc-
ing  numerous  goods,  such  as  human  actions,  for  the  levels  of  the  Abode 
of Bliss; and a movie-camera with a hundred thousand lenses continuously 
taking pictures of this world to show to the spectators in the eternal realm 
and especially in Paradise. To ascribe partners to Allah is to transform this 
truly wondrous, absolutely obedient, living, corporeal angel into a lifeless, 
soulless, unemployed, perishing, meaningless, wretched, futile collectivity, 
revolving in the tumult of events and storms of change and darkness of non-
existence; and to convert this strange, utterly orderly, beneﬁcial factory into 
an idle, confused, unconscious plaything of chance lacking product or result 
or function; to make it into the playground of deaf nature and blind force, 
a place of mourning for all intelligent beings, and the slaughterhouse of all 
living creatures, and a vale of tears.

In accordance with the verse, ( 31:13 ) D C B A    to associ-
ate partners with Allah, although a single evil, leads to such vast and numer-
ous crimes that those who perpetrate it deserve inﬁnite torment in Hell. Any-
way... since this Second Fruit has been explained and proved repeatedly in 
The Illuminating Lamp, we have cut short the long story here.

A  s t r a n g e  f e e l i n g  a n d  p e r c e p t i o n  w h i c h  d r o v e  m e  t o  t h i s  S e c o n d  F r u i t .  It 

was like this:

One  time  when  observing  the  season  of  spring,  I  saw  that  the  succes-
sive caravans of beings, and especially living creatures and the small young 
ones at that, followed on one after the other in a ﬂowing torrent, display-
ing hundreds of thousands of samples of the resurrection of the dead and 

22

THE RAYS

Great  Gathering  on  the  face  of  the  earth.  But  they  appeared  only  brieﬂy 
then disappeared. The tableaux of death and transience amid that constant, 
awesome activity seemed to me excessively sad; I felt such pity it made me 
weep. The more I observed the deaths of those lovely small creatures, the 
more my heart ached. I cried at the pity of it and within me felt a deep spir-
itual turmoil. Life which met with such an end seemed to me to be torment 
worse than death.

The  living  beings  of  the  plant  and  animal  kingdoms,  too,  which  were 
most  beautiful  and  lovable  and  full  of  valuable  art,  opened  their  eyes  for 
a  moment  onto  the  exhibition  of  the  universe,  then  disappeared  and  were 
gone. I felt grievous pain the more I watched this. My heart wanted to weep 
and complain and cry out at fate. It asked the awesome questions: “ Why do 
they  come  and  then  depart  without  stopping? ”  These  apparently  useless, 
purposeless little creatures were being despatched to non-existence before 
my very eyes, despite having been created, nurtured and raised with so much 
attention and art, in such valuable forms. They were merely torn up like rags 
and thrown away into the obscurity of nothingness. The more I saw this the 
more  my  inner  senses  and  faculties,  which  are  captivated  by  beauty  and 
perfection and enamoured of precious things, cried out: “ Why does no one 
take pity on them? Isn’t it a shame? Where did they come from, the death 
and ephemerality in these bewildering upheavals and transformations which 
persistently attack these wretched beings? ”

As I started to utter fearful objections about divine determining and the 
grievous circumstances of the outer face of life and its events, the light of 
the Qur’an, the mystery of belief, the favour of the Most Merciful, and the 
afﬁrmation of divine unity all came to my assistance. They lit up those dark-
nesses and transformed my laments into joy and my weeping into happiness 
and my pity into exclamations of “ Blessed be Allah! What wonders Allah 
has willed! ” They caused me to declare: “ All praise be to Allah for the light 
of belief! ” For through an inner meaning of divine unity I saw that all crea-
tures, and particularly living creatures, produce truly signiﬁcant results and 
have general beneﬁts.

I n   S h o r t : All living beings, for instance this adorned ﬂower or that sweet-
producing  bee,  are  divine  odes  full  of  meaning  which  innumerable  con-
scious  beings  study  in  delight.  They  are  precious  miracles  of  power  and 
proclamations of wisdom exhibiting their Maker’s art in captivating fashion 
to innumerable appreciative observers. While to appear before the gaze of 
the Glorious Creator, Who wishes to observe His art Himself, and look on 

THE SECOND RAY – FIRST STATION

23

the beauties of His creation and the loveliness of the manifestations of His 
names, is another exceedingly elevated result of their creation.

A further elevated function of their creation is described in the Twenty-
Fourth Letter, and is their serving in ﬁve ways the manifestations of  domini-
cality  and  divine  perfections  which  necessitate  the  inﬁnite  activity  in  the 
universe.

I saw that if the being is endowed with spirit, since its apparent death has 
the meaning of a joyful release from duties, besides the above beneﬁts and 
results, it leaves behind in its place in this Manifest World its spirit, and in 
innumerable memories and other preserved tablets its form and identity, and 
in its seeds the laws of its being and a sort of future life, and in the World 
of the Unseen and Realm of the divine names the perfections and beauties it 
has mirrored; it merely passes behind the curtain of death and is hidden from 
worldly eyes. I exclaimed: “ All praise and thanks be to Allah! ”

These genuine, powerful, faultless, utterly brilliant instances of beauty 
and loveliness which are visible in all the levels of the universe and all its 
realms of beings and have spread everywhere, demonstrate with complete 
certainty that the ugly, harsh, abhorrent, wretched former situation, which 
the association of partners with Allah necessitates, is impossible and illu-
sory. For such ghastly ugliness could not exist hidden under the veil of such 
genuine  beauty.  If  it  were  found  there,  that  true  beauty  would  be  untrue, 
baseless, futile, and illusory. This means that the association of partners with 
Allah has no reality, its way is closed, it has become stuck in a bog; what it 
posits is impossible and precluded. Since this truth of belief, which pertains 
to the emotions, is explained in detail with numerous proofs in many parts 
of T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p , we shall sufﬁce here with this brief indication.

Third Fruit

Third Fruit

This  fruit  looks  to  conscious  beings  and  particularly  to  human  beings. 
Through the mystery of divine unity, among all creatures the human being 
may attain to the highest perfections, and become the most valuable fruit of 
the universe, the most perfect and reﬁned of creatures, the most fortunate 
and happy of animate beings, and the addressee and friend of the world’s 
Creator. Indeed, all human perfections and lofty aims are tied to the afﬁr-
mation of divine unity and ﬁnd existence through its meaning. For if there 
were no unity, human beings would be the most unhappy of creatures, the 
lowest of beings, the most wretched of the animals, the most suffering and 
sorrowful of intelligent beings. For together with their inﬁnite impotence, 

24

THE RAYS

their  innumerable  enemies,  their  boundless  want,  and  endless  needs,  they 
have been decked out with a great many faculties and senses so that they 
feel innumerable sorts of pains and experiences countless sorts of pleasures. 
They have such aims and desires that one who does not govern the whole 
universe at once cannot bring about those desires.

For example, human beings have an intense desire for immortality. Only 
one who has disposal over the whole universe as though it were a palace 
can answer this wish; who can close the door of this world and open that of 
the hereafter, like closing the door of one room and opening that of another. 
They also have thousands of desires, both negative and positive, which like 
the desire for immortality spread throughout the world and stretch to eter-
nity. It is only the Single One, Who through the mystery of unity holds the 
whole universe in His grasp, that by answering these desires of humanity 
can cure the two awesome wounds of his impotence and want.

Moreover, they have wishes for tranquillity and ease of heart so insub-
stantial, secret, and particular, and aims connected with the immortality and 
happiness  of  their  spirits  so  vast,  comprehensive,  and  universal,  that  they 
can  be  answered  only  by  one  who  sees  the  subtlest  and  most  impercepti-
ble veils of the heart, and is not unconcerned, and hears its most inaudible, 
secret voices, and does not leave them unanswered. That one must also have 
sufﬁcient power to subjugate the heavens and earth as though they were two 
obedient soldiers, and make them perform universal works.

Also, through the mystery of unity all the human members and senses 
gain a high value, while by ascribing partners to Allah and disbelief they fall 
to an inﬁnitely low degree. For example, the most valuable human faculty is 
intelligence. Through the mystery of divine unity, it becomes a brilliant key 
to the sacred divine treasuries and to the thousands of coffers of the universe. 
Whereas if it descends to associating partners with Allah and to unbelief, it 
becomes an inauspicious instrument of torture which heaps up in the head all 
the grievous pains of the past and awesome fears of the future.

Also,  for  example,  compassion,  the  most  gentle  and  agreeable  human 
characteristic:  if  the  mystery  of  divine  unity  does  not  come  to  its  assist-
ance, it becomes a calamitous torment which reduces people to the depths of 
misery. A heedless mother who imagines she has lost her only child for all 
eternity feels this searing pain to the full.

Also, for example, love, the sweetest, most pleasurable, and most pre-
cious  human  emotion:  if  the  mystery  of  divine  unity  assists  it,  it  gives 
miniscule humans the expanse and breadth of the universe, and makes them 

THE SECOND RAY – FIRST STATION

25

petted  monarchs  of  the  animals.  Whereas  if  –  I  seek  refuge  with  Allah  – 
they descend to associating partners with Allah and unbelief, because they 
will be separated for all eternity from all their innumerable beloveds as they 
continuously disappear in death, love becomes a terrible calamity constantly 
lacerating their wretched hearts. But vain amusements causing heedlessness 
temporarily numb their senses, apparently not allowing them to feel it.

If  you  make  analogies  with  these  three  examples  for  the  hundreds  of 
human faculties and senses, you will understand the degree to which divine 
unity and the afﬁrmation of it are the means by which people may be ful-
ﬁlled and perfected. This Third Fruit too has been very well explained in 
detailed manner with proofs in perhaps twenty of the treatises of T h e   I l l u m i -
n a t i n g   L a m p , so I am sufﬁcing with this brief indication here.
W h a t   i m p e l l e d   m e   t o   t h i s   F r u i t   w a s   t h e   f o l l o w i n g   f e e l i n g :
At one time I was on the top of a high mountain. A spiritual awakening 
powerful enough to dispel my heedlessness showed me death and the grave 
in  all  their  stark  reality,  and  transience  and  ephemerality  with  all  their 
painful representations. Like everyone’s, my innate desire for immortality 
surged up and rebelled against death. The fellow feeling and compassion 
in my nature, too, revolted against the annihilation of the people of perfec-
tion, the famous prophets, the saints, and the puriﬁed ones, for whom I feel 
great love and attachment; it boiled up angrily against the grave. I looked 
in the six directions seeking help, but found no solace, no assistance. For 
looking to the past, I saw a vast graveyard; and to the future, darkness; and 
above I saw horror; and to the right and left, grievous situations and the 
assaults  of  numberless  harmful  things.  Suddenly,  the  mystery  of  divine 
unity came to my assistance and drew back the veil, revealing the face of 
reality. “ Look! ”, it said.

First of all I looked at the face of death, which I feared greatly. I saw 
that for the people of belief it was a discharge from duties. The appointed 
hour was the discharge papers. It was a change of abode, the introduction to 
an everlasting life, and the door leading to it. It was to be released from the 
prison of this world and to ﬂy to the gardens of Paradise. It was the occasion 
one enters the presence of the Most Merciful in order to receive the wages 
for one’s service. It was a call to go to the realm of bliss. Understanding this 
with complete certainty, I began to love death.

I  looked  then  at  transience  and  ephemerality,  and  I  saw  them  to  be  a 
pleasurable renewal, like pictures on the cinema screen and bubbles on ﬂow-
ing water under the sun. Coming from the World of the Unseen in order to 

26

THE RAYS

refresh the exquisite manifestations of the most beautiful names, they were 
an excursion, a trip, in the Manifest World, with certain duties to perform; 
they  were  a  wise  and  purposeful  manifestation  of  dominical  beauty;  they 
performed  the  function  of  mirrors  to  the  eternal  beauty  of  beings.  This  I 
knew with certainty.

I  then  looked  at  the  six  directions  and  I  saw  that  through  the  mystery 
of divine unity they were so luminous they dazzled the eyes. I saw that the 
past was not a vast grave, but having been transformed into the future, had 
become  thousands  of  enlightened  gatherings  of  friends  and  thousands  of 
light-ﬁlled vistas. I looked at the true faces of thousands of matters like these 
two, and I saw that they afforded nothing but joy and thanks.

I have described my feelings about this Third Fruit with proofs, particu-
lar and universal, in perhaps forty treatises of T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p . They 
have been explained so clearly and decisively in the thirteen H o p e s  of the 
Twenty-Sixth Flash in particular,  T h e   Tr e a t i s e   F o r   T h e   E l d e r l y , that there 
could be no clearer elucidation. Here, therefore, I have cut this very long 
story very short.

Second Station

[ There are incalculable proofs necessitating, demanding, and requiring 
incontestably divine oneness and divine unity and its afﬁrmation which 
neither accept nor permit the association of partners with Allah. Since 
hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of them are demonstrated in detail in 
the Risale-i Nur, here only three which necessitate divine unity will be 
set out brieﬂy. ]

The First Matter

The First

According to the testimony of the wise and discerning acts which are to 
be observed clearly in the universe, creatures are made through the limitless 
attributes  and  names  of  an  All-Wise  Sovereign,  One  Perfect  and  Mighty 
Whose knowledge and power are absolute.

Yes, it may be surmised certainly from the works in the universe that their 
Maker possesses sovereignty and rulership at the degree of absolute domini-
cality, and grandeur and magniﬁcence at the degree of absolute might, and 
perfection and self-sufﬁciency at the degree of absolute godhead; and that 
His  activity  and  rule  are  absolutely  without  restriction  or  limit;  these  are 
understood clearly and are visible. As for sovereignty, grandeur, perfection, 
self-sufﬁciency,  absoluteness,  comprehensiveness,  unrestrictedness,  and 
unlimitedness, they necessitate unity and are opposed to partnership.

The  testimony  to  unity  of  sovereignty  and  rulership: This  has  been 
proved with complete certainty in numerous places in the  R i s a l e - i   N u r . A 
brief summary is as follows:

The mark of rulership is independence, solitariness, and the rejection of 
interference; rulership necessitates these. Due to only a shadow of rulership, 
impotent men even, who by their natures are in need of assistance, reject the 
interference of others and preserve their independence. It is for this reason 
that there cannot be two kings in a country, or two governors of a province, 
two mayors of a town, or even two headmen of a village. If there are two 
of  any  of  these,  it  leads  to  chaos;  rebellions  break  out  and  law  and  order 
are  overturned.  Since  a  mere  shadow  of  rulership  in  impotent  men  needy 
of assistance repels the partnership and interference of others to this extent, 
surely the rulership, which is in the form of dominicality, of an Absolutely 
Powerful One free of all impotence will in no way accept any partners or 
interference. He will reject it vehemently and angrily repulse from His court

THE RAYS

those who ascribe imaginary partners to Him. The All-Wise Qur’an’s severe 
threats against those who ascribe partners to Allah arise from this truth.

The  testimony  to  unity  of  grandeur,  magniﬁcence,  and  glory: This 
too has been explained with brilliant proofs in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and here a 
very brief meaning of it is alluded to.

For example, the magniﬁcence and grandeur of the sun’s light leave no 
need for any weak lights near to it; its light dims the power of other lights. 
Similarly, the magniﬁcence and immensity of divine power leave no need 
for any other force or power, and afford no other power a true effect or abil-
ity to create. Especially living and conscious beings, which are the points 
on  which  all  the  dominical  aims  in  the  universe  turn  and  where  they  are 
concentrated; it is impossible that they should be referred to others. It is also 
in no way possible that the fruits, results, and circumstances of the creation 
of human beings and of the particular characteristics of living beings should 
be  referred  to  other  hands,  for  these  results  are  the  origin  of  innumerable 
sorts of bounties and where the aims of their creation are manifested. For 
example, it would be an affront to the magniﬁcence of dominicality for an 
animate being to be truly grateful to anyone other than Almighty Allah for 
being healed from some minor ailment, or for some sustenance, or for guid-
ance, and to praise and applaud the person extravagantly; the grandeur of the 
Godhead would be offended; the dignity of the Absolute Object of Worship 
affronted, and His glory, vexed.

How perfection points to the mystery of unity: Again this has been 
explained with brilliant proofs in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and an extremely brief 
meaning of it is this: self-evidently, the creation of the heavens and earth 
necessitate  an  absolute  power  of  utter  perfection.  The  wondrous  bodily 
systems of animate beings also necessitate a power of absolute perfection. 
And the perfection of an absolute power which is exempt from impotence 
and free of restriction necessitates unity. For to apply defect to perfection 
and  restrict  the  unrestricted,  and  to  make  inﬁnity  ﬁnite,  and  reduce  the 
strongest power to the weakest impotence means making an inﬁnite power 
ﬁnite with something ﬁnite at a time it is inﬁnite, and this is utterly impos-
sible in ﬁve ways.

The testimonies to unity of unrestrictedness, comprehensiveness, and 
inﬁnity: This too has been mentioned in detail in the treatises of T h e   I l l u m i -
n a t i n g   L a m p  (t h e   R i s a l e - i   N u r ). A summary of what it means is as follows: 
since by spreading pervasively around their own works, the acts in the uni-
verse all show that they are comprehensive and unrestricted, unlimited and 

THE SECOND RAY – SECOND STATION

29

absolute; and since partners and participation place a restriction on the com-
prehensiveness and unrestrictedness, and limit the unlimitedness, destroy-
ing their nature and reality; most certainly partnership in those acts which 
are absolute and comprehensive is impossible and precluded. Yes, the very 
nature of unrestrictedness is opposed to partnership, for even in ﬁnite, mate-
rial, and limited things, by deﬁnition it pervades and permeates everywhere.
For example, if air, light, and heat, and even water, were to display unre-
strictedness, they would spread everywhere. Since, even if particular, this 
aspect of unrestrictedness makes physical and limited things invasive, surely 
true, universal unrestrictedness would afford such encompassment and per-
vasiveness to attributes that were both inﬁnite, and free of matter, and unlim-
ited, and free of defect, that there could be no possibility whatsoever of their 
accepting any partners or partnership.

I n   S h o r t :  Both  the  sovereignty,  and  the  grandeur,  and  the  perfection, 
and the comprehensiveness, and the unrestrictedness, and the inﬁnity of the 
thousands of general acts and the hundreds of divine names whose manifes-
tations are to be seen in the universe are extremely powerful proofs of divine 
unity and the afﬁrmation of it.

Also,  a  superior  force  wants  to  overrun  its  surroundings  in  order  to 
become activated, scattering other forces. Similarly, it is apparent from all 
the works of dominicality and manifestations of the names of the Godhead 
that their forces are so extraordinarily overwhelming that if it were not for 
general sovereignty and absolute justice, which prevent them, they would 
have overrun all beings. For example, is it at all possible that the universal 
power which creates all the poplar trees on the earth and administers them, 
should not take under its control single specimens of the walnut, apple, and 
apricot, which have become interspersed among the poplars, and not reg-
ulate  them  and  dominate  them,  or  that  it  should  hand  them  over  to  other 
forces? Yes, in all species of creatures, and even in each of their members, a 
governing force and power are felt which clearly have the capacity to over-
run  the  whole  universe  and  subjugate  all  beings.  Certainly,  such  a  power 
would not accept partners of any sort, nor permit partnership.

Also, for the owner of a fruit-bearing tree, the matters of greatest impor-
tance are the fruit at the tips of the tree’s branches, and for future planting, 
the seeds in the hearts of its fruits, rather, that are the hearts of its fruits. If the 
tree’s owner has any sense, he will not make his ownership go for nothing by 
handing over possession of the fruits to someone else. In exactly the same 
way; the elements, which are the branches of the tree called the universe, 

30

THE RAYS

and the plants and animals, which are at the tips of the elements and are like 
the tree’s ﬂowers and leaves, and human beings, which are the topmost of 
the leaves and ﬂowers, – the owner of the tree would in no way hand over 
to other forces the worship and thanks of those fruits, which are their most 
important fruits and the result of their creation, and especially their hearts, 
the quintessential seeds of the fruits, and their faculties of memory, which 
are known as the outer heart, so negating the sovereignty of His dominical-
ity, and cancelling also his ﬁtness to be worshipped.

Also, since the aims of dominicality are centred in the particulars at the 
extremities of the sphere of contingency and multiplicity, and even in the 
states and circumstances of those particulars; and since they are the source 
of the thanks, gratitude, and worship, which are extended and look to the 
One True Object of Worship; for sure He would not hand them over to oth-
ers  and  so  nullify  His  wisdom,  and  by  nullifying  His  wisdom,  annul  His 
Godhead. For the most important dominical aims in the creation of beings 
are to make Himself known to conscious beings, and loved, and praised and 
extolled, and to attract their gratitude to Himself.

It is because of this subtle mystery that, in order to demonstrate that the 
bounties and acts, universal and particular, at the extremities of the sphere 
of multiplicity, such as sustenance, healing, and particularly guidance and 
belief, which result in thanks, worship, gratitude, love, praise, and worship, 
are  directly  the  works,  bounties,  gifts,  and  acts  of  the  universe’s  Creator, 
the Monarch of all beings, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition repeatedly 
ascribes sustenance, guidance, and healing to the Necessarily Existent One, 
stating  that  the  bestowal  of  them  is  His  alone  and  restricted  to  Him,  and 
strongly rejecting the interference of others. 1 Yes, the One Who bestows the 
bounty of belief, which wins for a person an abode of bliss, can surely only 
be the One Who creates the abode of bliss and makes belief the key to it. It 
could only be His bounty. Nobody could shut up this largest window open-
ing onto the True Object of Worship by bestowing an equally great bounty; 
no one could block up this most important way to Him, or steal it.

I n   S h o r t :  The most particular events and fruits at the tips of the tree of 

creation testify to divine unity and the afﬁrmation of it in two ways:

F i r s t l y :  The aims of dominicality in the universe are gathered together 
in those fruits and events and their aims are centred on them, and most of 
the  manifestations  of  the  divine  names  and  their  determinations,  and  the 
results of and beneﬁts in the creation of beings are gathered together in them. 

1.  For example, ( 51:58 ) Z Y X W V U T.

THE SECOND RAY – SECOND STATION

31

In this respect, each of them therefore declares: “ I am the property, act, and 
work of the One who created the whole universe. ”

T h e   S e c o n d   Wa y :  Since the hearts of those particular fruits, as well as the 
human memory, which in a Hadith is called “ the outer heart, ” 1 are concise 
indexes of most species of beings, and small maps of them, and in meaning 
are seeds of the tree of the universe, and are subtle mirrors of most of the 
divine names; and since hearts and memories, which are all similar and bear 
the same stamp, spread pervasively throughout the universe; they look to the 
One who holds the whole universe in the grasp of His power, and they each 
declare: “ I am the work and art of Him alone. ”

T o   C o n c l u d e :  With regard to its beneﬁts, a fruit looks to its tree’s owner. 
With regard to its seed, it looks to all the parts, members, and nature of the 
tree. And with regard to the stamp on its face, it gazes on all the fruits of the 
tree, whose stamp is the same. Together they declare: “ We are all the same 
and we have one maker. We are the property of a single person. Whoever 
made one of us, made all of us. ” In exactly the same way, in regard to the 
stamps on the faces of the living creatures at the extremities of the sphere 
of multiplicity, and especially the stamps on man’s face, and his index-like 
heart, and the results of his nature and his being a fruit, they look directly to 
the One who holds the whole universe in the grasp of His power and testify 
to His unity.

The Second Matter

The Second Matter Necessitating Divine Unity

This is the fact that in unity are an ease and facility which render it nec-
essary, while in associating partners with Allah are difﬁculties to the point 
of  preclusion.  This  truth  has  been  explained  and  demonstrated  with  bril-
liant and decisive proofs in many of the treatises of what Imam ‘Ali ( May 
Allah be pleased with him ) called T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p , especially in the 
Twentieth Letter, in detail, and in the Fourth Point of the Thirtieth Flash, 
brieﬂy. It has been demonstrated with powerful proofs that if all things are 
attributed to one single Being, the creation and regulation of the universe are 
as easy as the creation and regulation of a tree; and the creation and making 
of a tree are as easy as the creation and making of a fruit; and the origination 
and management of the spring are as easy as the origination and manage-
ment of a ﬂower; and the admininstration and raising of a species containing 
numerous members are as free of trouble as the administration and raising 
of a single individual.

1.  al-Bukhārī, a l - N i k ā ḥ , 14,25; F a ḍ ā ’ i l   a l - Q u r ’ ā n , 22; al-Nasā’ī, a l - N i k ā ḥ , 62

THE RAYS

But  in  constrast,  if,  on  the  way  of  associating  partners  with  Allah,  all 
things are ascribed to causes and nature, the creation of a single being is as 
difﬁcult as that of a species, indeed, of many species; and the creation and 
decking out of a single living ﬂower as difﬁcult as the creation and decking 
out of the spring, or many springs; and the creation, making, raising to life, 
administering, nurturing, directing, and regulation of a tree as difﬁcult as the 
creation and so on of the universe, or even more difﬁcult.

Since the reality of the matter has been thus proved in T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g  
L a m p , and since as we see plainly before us, together with the very highest 
degree of art and the greatest value there is a superabundance of beings; 
and  together  with  being  wondrous  machines  with  numerous  miraculous 
components and members, all living creatures come into existence in abso-
lute profusion inﬁnitely easily with extraordinary speed just like striking 
a match; it demonstrates necessarily and self-evidently that the profusion 
and ease arise from unity and from their being the works of a single Being. 
Otherwise, let alone cheapness, abundance, speed, ease, and value; a fruit 
now obtained for ﬁve  p a r a  would not have been obtainable for ﬁve hun-
dred l i r a , 1 or would have been so rare as to have been unobtainable. And 
the creation of living beings, which resemble regular machines that work 
like setting a clock or turning on an electric switch, would have been so 
difﬁcult  as  to  have  been  impossible,  and  some  animals  who  come  into 
existence together with all their bodily systems and vital conditions in a 
day, or an hour, or a minute, would not have come into existence in a year, 
or a century, or perhaps ever at all.

It is proved in a hundred places in T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p  so decisively 
as to silence the most obdurate denier, that if all things are ascribed to the 
Single One of Unity, they are as easy, swift, and cheap as a single thing. 
Whereas if causes and nature are given a share, the creation of a single thing 
becomes as difﬁcult, slow, unimportant, and expensive as all things. For the 
proofs of this truth, you may refer to the Twentieth and Thirty-Third Let-
ters, the Twenty-Second and Thirty-Second Words, the Twenty-Third Flash, 
which is about nature, and the Thirtieth Flash, which is about the greatest 
name, particularly its Fourth and Sixth Points which are about the names of 
Single and Self-Subsistent respectively. There you will see that it has been 
proved with the certainty of two plus two equalling four. Here, only one of 
those hundreds of proofs will be alluded to, as follows:

1.  4 p a r a  = 1 k u r u s h , 100 k u r u s h  = 1 l i r a . [ Tr. ]

THE SECOND RAY – SECOND STATION

33

The creation of things is either from non-existence or from the elements 
and other beings in the form of composition. If attributed to a single Being, 
that Being is bound to have all- encompassing knowledge and such power as 
prevails over all things. In this way, the giving of external existence to things 
whose forms are present in His knowledge or who exist as knowledge, and 
bringing them out of apparent non-existence, is as easy and simple as strik-
ing a match or spreading a special liquid over invisible writing in order to 
reveal it, or transposing an image from photographic ﬁlm to paper. Through 
the command of 
 ( 36:82 ) ² ± the Maker brings into external existence 
from apparent non-existence things whose plans, programmes, and shapes 
and proportions are present in His knowledge.

If creation is in the form of composition and art and not creating from 
non-existence and nothing, and in the form of gathering together from the 
elements and surroundings, it resembles the members of a regiment mus-
tering at the call of a bugle after having dispersed to rest, and the soldiers 
collecting together in regular and orderly fashion, and in order to facilitate 
this  exercise  and  preserve  their  positions,  the  whole  army  being  like  the 
power, law, and eye of its commander. In exactly the same way, as though 
they  were  the  power,  law,  and  ofﬁcials  of  the  Monarch  of  the  Universe, 
the minute particles under the Monarch’s command of – together with the 
beings with which they have contact – are mobilized according to the princi-
ples of His knowledge and determining and the laws of His pervasive power. 
In order to form a living being, they assume a speciﬁed measure and propor-
tion, which resembles an immaterial mould speciﬁed by divine knowledge 
and determining, and there they stop.

If things are referred to different things like hands and causes and nature, 
then as all the reasonable agree, no cause can in any way create from noth-
ing and non-existence. For causes do not possess comprehensive knowledge 
and all-pervading power, and non-existence would not be only apparent and 
external, it would be absolute, and absolute non-existence can in no way be 
the source of existence. In which case, creation would be in the form of com-
position. But if it were in the form of composition, the particles of a ﬂy or a 
ﬂower could come together only with innumerable difﬁculties after collect-
ing the ﬂy’s body and ﬂower’s parts from all over the earth and passing them 
through a ﬁne sieve. Even having come together, since there would be no 
immaterial moulds existing as knowledge to preserve them in orderly form 
without dispersing, physical, natural moulds, in fact moulds to the number 

34

THE RAYS

of  their  members,  would  be  necessary  so  that  the  particles  that  had  come 
together could form the bodies of those living creatures.

Thus, to ascribe all things to a single being is so easy as to be necessary 
and to attribute them to numerous causes so difﬁcult as to be impossible and 
precluded. Similarly, if all things are ascribed to the Single One of Unity, 
they become valuable, full of art, meaningful, and powerful to the utmost 
degree at the same time as being inﬁnitely cheap. While if, on the way of 
associating partners with Allah, they are ascribed to numerous causes and 
nature, they become valueless and completely lacking in art, meaning, and 
power, as well as being inﬁnitely expensive.

Since a man who joins the army becomes connected with its commander-
in-chief  and  he  relies  on  him,  he  gains  the  potential  moral  support  of  the 
army, when necessary. And since the power of the army is his reserve force, 
he acquires a physical strength far exceeding his individual strength. And 
since because the army carries the sources of that signiﬁcant strength of his 
and his ammunition, he is not compelled to carry them and will therefore be 
able to carry out superhuman works. Despite being a single private soldier, 
he may capture an enemy ﬁeld marshal, or compel all the inhabitants of a 
town to migrate, or capture a citadel. His works will be extraordinary and of 
great worth.

If, however, he leaves the army and remains on his own, he will lose that 
miraculous moral strength, power, and force, and be able to perform only 
insigniﬁcant, valueless works in accordance with his personal strength like a 
common irregular soldier. His achievements will diminish proportionately.

In  exactly  the  same  way,  since  on  the  way  of  divine  unity  everything 
becomes connected with the All-Powerful One of Glory and relies on Him, 
an ant may defeat the Pharaoh, a ﬂy vanquish Nimrod, and a microbe subdue 
a tyrant. So too a seed the size of a ﬁngernail may bear on its shoulders a tree 
the size of a mountain and be the source of all the tree’s parts and members 
and be their workbench. All particles, too, through that connection and reli-
ance, may perform innumerable duties in the formation of bodies, which are 
of innumerable sorts and kinds. The works in which those miniscule ofﬁcials 
and tiny soldiers are employed are inﬁnitely perfect and of the highest art 
and value. For the one who makes them is the All-Powerful One of Glory; 
it is He who puts the works in their hands, making them a veil. Whereas if 
attributed to causes on the way of associating partners with Allah, the ant’s 
achievements would be as insigniﬁcant as the ant, not an atom’s worth of 
value would remain in the particle’s art, and everything would lose all value 

THE SECOND RAY – SECOND STATION

35

both in meaning and physically so that no one would give a farthing for the 
vast world.

Since the reality is this; and since as we see with our own eyes everything 
is inﬁnitely valuable, and full of art, and meaningful, and powerful; most 
deﬁnitely there can be no way other than the way of divine unity. If there 
were, it would be necessary to change all beings, empty the world into non-
existence, and then reﬁll it with meaningless junk, so that a way could be 
opened up to associating partners with Allah.

So  now  you  have  heard  a  brief  summary  of  only  one  of  the  hundreds 
of proofs that elucidate divine unity and its afﬁrmation in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
which in the words of Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) is T h e  
I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p   (   S i r ā j   a l - N ū r   )   and  S i r ā j   a l - S u r u j   (   L a m p   o f   L a m p s   or 
L i g h t   o f   L i g h t s  ). You may make analogies with this for the others.

The Third Matter

The Third Matter Necessitating Divine Unity

Since, together with the extraordinary art in the creation of things, espe-
cially in living beings, a seed is a small sample of the fruit, a fruit is a mini-
ature  specimen  of  the  tree,  a  tree  is  a  summary  index  of  the  species,  and 
the species is a concise map of the universe and in meaning is its seed, and 
each of these is a comprehensive point and a droplet gathered together and 
distilled from the universe according to the principles of knowledge and bal-
ances of wisdom; since this is so, the one who created any one of them must 
be the one who created the whole universe. Yes, the one who creates the 
seed of a melon is self-evidently the one who created the melon; it is impos-
sible and precluded that it should be anyone other than him.

Yes, we look and see that all the atoms in blood are so orderly and per-
form so many duties that they are not inferior to the stars. All the red and 
white corpuscles in blood work with such a degree of consciousness in pro-
tecting and feeding the body that they are more efﬁcient than the best com-
missaries  or  bodyguards.  All  the  cells  of  the  body  manifest  such  orderly 
processes  and  incomings  and  outgoings  that  their  administration  is  more 
perfect than the best-run body or palace. All plants and animals bear such a 
seal on their faces and such machines in their chests that only one who cre-
ated all of them could situate those seals and machines in their places. And 
all the species of living beings have spread over the face of the earth in such 
orderly fashion and have intermingled with the other species having mutual 
relations with them, that one who could not simultaneously create, admin-
ister, regulate, and raise all those species, and not place that veil on the face 

36

THE RAYS

of the earth, and not weave that most ornate, artistic, living tapestry with its 
warp and weft of the four hundred thousand plant and animal species –  one 
that could not do all these could not create and administer a single species. If 
analogies are made with these for other things, it will be understood that in 
respect of creation and bringing into existence, the universe is a whole that 
may not be split up into parts, and in respect of dominicality and manage-
ment is a universal whose division is impossible.

This third necessitating factor has been explained and proved decisively 
and brilliantly in many of the treatises of T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p , and espe-
cially in the First Stopping Place of the Thirty- Second Word, demonstrating 
that like reﬂections of the sun, a proof of unity and its afﬁrmation is reﬂected 
and represented in everything’s mirror. Making do with those explanations, 
we are here cutting a long story short.

Third Station

[ In this station three universal signs of the afﬁrmation of divine unity 
will be explained. ]

The signs, proofs, and evidences of divine unity are incalculable. Since 
thousands of them have been explained in detail in T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p , 
in this Third Station three universal proofs are set forth brieﬂy.

The First Sign and Proof

The First Sign and Proof

The  phrase  “ He  is  One ”  is  the  conclusion  of  this.  There  is  a  unity  in 
everything, and unity points to one. Yes, a work that has unity self-evidently 
proceeded from one maker. One proceeds from one. The fact that there is a 
unity in everything demonstrates that they are the works and artefacts of a 
single being. The universe is like a rosebud swathed in a thousand veils of 
unity. Or it is a single macroanthropos dressed in unities to the number of 
divine names and universal divine works. Or it is a Tuba tree of creation on 
the branches of which are hung unities to the number of realms of creatures.
Yes, the administration of the universe is one and the same; and its regu-
lation is one and the same; its sovereignty is one and the same; its stamp is 
one and the same; a thousand and one things are all one and the same. Also, 
although the names and acts which make the universe turn are one and the 
same, they each encompass the universe, or most of it. That is to say, the 
wisdom that works in it is one and the same; the bestowal in it is one and the 
same; its regulation is one and the same; the providing of sustenance in it 
is one and the same; the mercy which hastens to assist the needy is one and 
the same; the rain, which is that mercy’s dispenser of soft drinks, is one and 
the same, and so on; thousands of things are all one and the same. The sun, 
the universe’s stove, is one and the same; the moon, its lamp, is one and the 
same; ﬁre, its cook, is one and the same; its mountains, which are its stores, 
treasuries, and masts, are one and same; its water dispensers are one and the 
same; its sponges which water the gardens are one and the same; a thousand 
and one things are all one and the same.

All these instances of unity in the world are proofs indicating the Single 
One of Unity, as clear and brilliant as the sun. Moreover, the elements and 
realms of beings of the universe each encompassing the face of the earth as 
well as being one and the same, and their interpenetration and their uniting 
through their mutual relations and even mutual assistance, are clear signs 
that their Owner, Maker, and Master is one and the same.

The Second Sign and Proof

37

38

THE RAYS

The Second Sign and Proof

The conclusion of this is the phrase “ He has no partners. ” It is the fact 
that  there  is  a  faultless,  perfect  order  in  everything  in  the  universe,  from 
minute particles to the stars, and an utterly beautiful harmony that is free 
of defect, and a just balance that wrongs nothing. As for perfect order and 
balanced harmony, they can occur only through unity. For numerous hands 
interfering in a single work cause only confusion.

Come  now  and  behold  the  magniﬁcence  of  this  order:  it  has  made  the 
universe into a splendid mansion every stone of which is as full of art as a 
palace; and into a magniﬁcent city whose endless incomings and outgoings, 
and boundless valuable goods and foods, arrive perfectly regularly at exactly 
the right time from unexpected places, from behind the veil of the Unseen. 
The order has also transformed the universe into a miraculous book so full 
of meaning that each of its letters expresses the meanings of a hundred lines, 
and each of its lines the meanings of a hundred pages, and each of its pages 
the meanings of a hundred chapters, and each of its chapters the meanings of 
a hundred books. Moreover, all its chapters, pages, lines, words, and letters 
look to each other and allude to each other.

Now come and look at the perfect ordering within this wondrous order: it 
has made the vast universe as clean as a modern city; or made it into a ﬁne 
palace which is constantly swept and polished; or a houri of Paradise wear-
ing seventy ornamented garments one on top of the other; or an immaculate 
rosebud enwrapped in seventy delicate, ornamented petals.

Now come and consider the perfect justice of the balance within the order 
and cleanliness; microscopic organisms that are visible only on a thousand-
fold  magniﬁcation  are  weighed  up  on  those  scales  and  balances  together 
with suns and stars a thousand times larger than the earth, and all are given 
their necessities without deﬁciency. Those minute creatures and those vast 
beings stand shoulder to shoulder before the scales of justice, despite there 
being among the large ones some that if they were to lose their balance even 
for a split second, it would destroy the equilibrium of the world and dooms-
day would occur.

Now come and behold the wondrously attractive beauty within the order, 
cleanliness, and balance; it has made the vast universe into a splendid festi-
val, an exhibition of highly decorated works, and a springtime with freshly 
opened ﬂowers. The vast spring too it has made into a beautiful ﬂower-pot 
and gorgeous bunch of blooms, and to each spring it has given the form of a 
magniﬁcent ﬂower with hundreds of thousands of adornments which opens

every  season  on  the  face  of  the  earth.  All  the ﬂowers  of  the  spring  it  has 
beautiﬁed with every sort of decoration. Yes, through the beautiful mani-
festations  of  the  most  beautiful  names,  which  possess  the  utmost  beauty 
and  loveliness,  all  the  realms  of  beings  in  the  universe,  and  all  the  mem-
bers of each, manifest such beauty according to their capacities that H u j j a t

all-encompassing,  captivating  beauty,  and  general,  wondrous  cleanliness, 
and  all-pervasive,  exceedingly  sensitive  balance,  and  comprehensive  and 
in every way miraculous order and harmony, are such proofs and signs of 
divine unity that they are clearer and more brilliant than the light that beto-
kens the sun at noon.

[ There follows a very concise yet powerful reply to a two-part question 
related to this Station. ]

The First Part of the Question

T h e   F i r s t   P a r t   o f  

t h e   Q u e s t i o n :  You  are  saying  in  this  Station  that 
beauty,  good,  and  justice  encompass  the  universe,  so  what  do  you  say  to 
all the ugliness, disasters, illness, tribulations, and death we see around us?

T h e   A n s w e r :  A single instance of ugliness which results in or shows up 
numerous instances of beauty is indirectly an instance of beauty. While the 
non-existence  of  an  ugliness,  or  its  being  invisible,  so  concealing  numer-
ous  instances  of  beauty  and  not  permitting  them  to  be  seen,  is  not  a  sin-
gle, but a manifold, ugliness. For example, if an ugliness which is a unit of 
measurement is non-existent, the beauty would be of only one sort and its 
numerous degrees would remain concealed. For it is through the interven-
tion  of  ugliness  that  the  degrees  of  beauty  unfold.  Just  as  the  degrees  of 
heat become apparent through the existence of cold, and the degrees of light 
are known through darkness, so universal instances of good, universal ben-
eﬁts, universal bounties, and universal instances of beauty become apparent 
through there being minor instances of evil, harm, calamities and ugliness. 
This means that the creation of ugliness is not ugly, it is beautiful, because 
the majority of its results are beautiful. Yes, a lazy man who suffers loss due 
to the rain, cannot deny the good results it produces in the name of mercy; 
he cannot transform the mercy into harm.

As for transience and death, it is demonstrated with extremely pow-
erful and decisive proofs in the Twenty-Fourth Letter that they are not 

1. See, al-Ghazālī, Iḥyā’ ‘Ulūm al-Dīn (Cairo: 1356/1937), iv, 2509.

40

THE RAYS

contrary  to  general  mercy,  all-embracing  beauty,  and  comprehensive 
good; in fact, they are necessitated by them. The creation of Satan, even, 
since  he  is  the  cause  of  striving  and  competition,  the  springs  of  man’s 
spiritual progress, is also good, as is the creation of his species; their cre-
ation is beautiful in that respect. Also, for unbelievers to suffer torments 
in Hell even is good, since through their unbelief they have transgressed 
the rights of all beings and insulted their honour. These two points have 
been explained in detail in other treatises, so here we are curtailing the 
discussion with this brief indication.

The Second Part of the Question

T h e   S e c o n d   P a r t   o f   t h e   Q u e s t i o n : 1 Alright, so we can accept the answer 
about Satan and the unbelievers from a general point of view, but how is it 
that the Absolutely Beautiful One, the Absolutely Compassionate One, the 
Absolutely Self-Sufﬁcient One, Who is absolute good, inﬂicts evil, calami-
ties, and ugliness on particular wretched individuals?

T h e   A n s w e r :  Whatever good, beauty, and bounty there are, they come 
directly from the treasury of mercy of the Absolutely Beautiful and Compas-
sionate One, and from His particular bestowal. Evils and calamities on the 
other hand are occasional results out of the many results of the general, uni-
versal laws which are called ‘ā d ā t   A l l ā h    and represent His universal will. 
Since they are minor and required by those laws, He creates them in order to 
preserve and maintain the laws, which are the means to universal beneﬁts. 
But in the face of those minor, grievous results, He responds with special, 
merciful assistance and particular dominical favours to the cries for help of 
individuals afﬂicted by misfortune and tribulations. And by showing that He 
acts as He wishes, and that all aspects of all things are tied to His will, and 
that universal laws too are always subject to His will and choice, and that a 
Compassionate Sustainer heeds the individuals who cry out at the constraint 
of the laws and responds to their cries for help with His favours, He opens 
up  an  unrestricted  inﬁnite  ﬁeld  for  the  unrestricted  inﬁnite  manifestations 
of His names, and opens too the doors of particular manifestations through 
exceptions to those universal divine principles and general laws and their 
minor evil results, and His particular favours and making Himself loved in 
special ways.

This second sign of the afﬁrmation of divine unity has been elucidated 
in perhaps a hundred places in T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p , and here we sufﬁce 
with a brief hint to it.

1.  The answer to the second part of the question has great importance; it dispels nu-

merous doubts.

THE SECOND RAY – THIRD STATION

The Third Sign and Proof

The Third Sign and Proof

This consists of the innumerable stamps of divine unity alluded to by the 
phrases “ His is the dominion and His is the praise. ” Just as the manifestation 
of the sun in a mirror shows the sun, so on the faces of all things, whether 
particular or universal from minute particles to the planets, is a mirror-like 
stamp which, pointing to the Sun of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, testiﬁes 
to His unity. Since a great number of those stamps have been described in 
detail in T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p , here with a brief indication, we shall take a 
look at only three of them. As follows:

Just as on the face of the universe as a whole a large stamp of unity has 
been  placed  consisting  of  mutual  assistance,  co-operation,  mutual  resem-
blance, and interpenetration among the species of beings, so on the face of 
the earth is a stamp afﬁrming divine unity placed through the army of the 
Glorious One, composed of the four hundred thousand animal and plant spe-
cies, all being given their different provisions, weapons, uniforms, instruc-
tions, and discharges with complete regularity and no confusion at exactly 
the right time. So too on the human face a stamp of unity is placed through 
each having features distinguishing it from all other faces, as there is on the 
faces of all beings, whether particular or universal. Also, to be observed on 
the heads of all creatures, whether large or small, numerous or few, is a seal 
of divine oneness. The stamps on living creatures are particularly brilliant; 
indeed, all living creatures are themselves each a stamp of unity, and seal of 
oneness, and a signature of Eternal Besoughtedness.

Yes, all ﬂowers, all fruits, all leaves, all plants, all animals are such seals 
of divine oneness and stamps of Eternal Besoughtedness that they transform 
trees into dominical missives, all species of creatures into books of the Most 
Merciful, and all gardens into divine decrees, placing stamps on the letters 
of the tree to the number of its blossoms, and signatures to the number of 
its fruits, and seals to the number of its leaves. In order to show their scribe, 
stamps have been put on the species and groups of creatures to the number 
of their individual members. And in order to announce and describe its ruler, 
stamps have been set on the decree of the garden to the number of the plants, 
trees, and animals it contains. In fact there are four stamps of divine unity on 
trees; on their origins, ends, outsides and insides, alluded to by the names of 

( 57:3 ) Ê  É  È  Ç    Æ 

42

THE RAYS

As the name of F i r s t  suggests, the original seeds 1 of fruit-bearing trees 
are coffers containing the programmes, indexes, and plans of the trees. They 
are workbenches for the production of their formation, systems, and neces-
sities; and machines regulating the tiny amounts they take in and expend.

As the name of L a s t  suggests, the results and fruits of trees are instruc-
tion  sheets  setting  forth  through  the  seeds  in  the  fruits’  hearts,  the  trees’ 
shapes, attributes, and stages; they are proclamations stating their functions, 
beneﬁts, and characteristics; and summaries announcing the trees’ peers and 
progeny.

As the name of O u t w a r d  suggests, the forms and shapes in which trees 
are  clothed  are skilfully  fashioned  and  embroidered  garments  which  have 
been  cut  out,  trimmed,  and  decorated  exactly  according  to  the  branches, 
members and parts of the trees. They are so ﬁne, well- proportioned and full 
of meaning that they transform the trees into odes, missives, and books.

As the name of I n w a r d  suggests, the workbenches within trees are fac-
tories  which  produce  all  the  parts  and  members  of  the  trees,  and  manage 
and run them with the very ﬁnest balance. They despatch too with perfect 
regularity and order, the food and substances necessary for all the separate 
members.  Those  wondrous  factories  function  with  the  speed  of  lightning, 
the ease of setting a clock, and the uniformity of commanding an army.

I n   S h o r t :  The origins of trees are coffers and programmes, their ends are 
instruction sheets and samples, their outer faces are artistically fashioned and 
embroidered garments, and their inner faces are factories and workbenches. 
These four aspects look to each other and as a whole form a supreme stamp. 
Indeed, a greatest name becomes apparent through them, for self-evidently 
none other than the Single Maker of Unity Who administers the whole uni-
verse could perform these works. Like trees, the origins, ends, and outer and 
inner faces of all animate creatures bear seals of divine oneness and stamps 
of unity.

Making an analogy with the trees in these three examples, the spring is 
a tree laden with blossoms. The seeds and roots entrusted to the hand of the 
autumn bear the stamp of the name of First. The fruits, grains, and vegetables 

1.  Since olden times, a common expression in the popular language was “ to raise from 
seed, ” which may be seen as a sort of allusion to the author of this treatise. For through 
the effulgence of the Qur’an, the servant of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  [ its author ] discovered two 
ascents in knowledge of Allah and the afﬁrmation of divine unity in seeds and ﬂowers. He 
discovered the water of life in the very places the naturalists drowned. He reached reality 
and the light of knowledge of Allah from seeds. It is for this reason that these two things 
are repeated frequently in the R i s a l e - i   N u r .

poured into the lap of summer, ﬁlling its skirts, bear the seal of the name of 
Last. The brocades and natural garments decorated with a hundred thousand 
designs which the spring wears one on top of the other like a houri bear the 
seal of the name of Outward. While the factories of the Eternally Besought 
One working away in the springtime inside the earth, and the bubbling caul-
drons of the Most Merciful and dominical kitchens cooking foods, each bear 
the signet of the name of Inward.

All  species,  for  instance  the  human  species,  are  trees:  just  as,  with  its 
roots and seeds in the past and fruits and results in the future, the orderly 
laws regulating sexual life and the perpetuation of the species bears a stamp 
of unity; so its present circumstances bear a stamp of unity governed by the 
principles of individual and social life; humankind bears a hidden, orderly 
seal  of  unity  under  the  apparent  disorder;  and  under  its  confused  circum-
stances, it bears a stamp of unity governed by the principles of divine deter-
mining and decree, known as the appointed course of life.

Conclusion

[ A brief allusion to the other pillars of belief, within the mystery of the 
afﬁrmation of divine unity. ]

Heedless  man!  Come  now  and  consider  if  only  once  the  three  Fruits, 
Necessitating Causes, and Proofs in the three Stations of this treatise: is it 
at all possible, since the All-Powerful, Wise, Compassionate, and Knowing 
Maker Who has disposal over the universe takes into account the smallest 
cure and least thanks; does not refer to others nor is indifferent towards the 
tiniest art, such as that of a ﬂy’s wing; attaches to the lowliest common seed 
duties and instances of wisdom as great as a tree; and makes perceived His 
mercifulness, compassionateness, and wisdom through all His arts, and Him-
self known through every means and loved through every bounty – is it at 
all possible that He should be indifferent towards the virtues of the Muham-
madan ( UWBP ) reality and his gloriﬁcations, and the lights of Islam?

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  the  Messengership  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP ), 
which  gilds  all  creatures  and  ﬁlls  them  with  joy,  illuminates  the  universe 
and brings the heavens and earth to tumult, and has for fourteen centuries 
taken under its rule, both physical and spiritual, half the globe and a ﬁfth of 
humankind, and has perpetuated that glorious rule on account of the Creator 
of the universe and in His name – is it at all possible that his Messengership 
is not one of the Maker’s most important aims, lights, and mirrors; and that 
the  other  prophets,  who  served  the  same  truths  as  Muhammad  ( UWBP ), 
should not also have been the Maker’s envoys, friends, and ofﬁcials? Allah 
forbid, to the number of the prophets’ miracles!

And is it at all possible that the Wise and Compassionate Creator Who 
attaches a hundred purposes and fruits to the least signiﬁcant thing like a 
branch or twig, and through His wisdom and general mercifulness makes 
known His dominicality, should deny all His wisdom and mercy, and even 
His  dominicality  and  perfection,  by  not  bringing  about  the  resurrection, 
which is as easy for His power as the spring? Is it at all possible that He 
should not open up an abode of happiness and everlasting realm, and make 
His wisdom and mercy, dominicality and perfection denied, and condemn to 
eternal annihilation all His beloved creatures whom He loves? Allah forbid, 
a  hundred  thousand  times!  That  Absolutely  Beauteous  One  is  utterly  hal-
lowed and exempt from such an absolute abomination.

A Lengthy Note

A question related to the resurrection of the dead:
The frequently repeated verse,

and the verse,

( 36:29 )  4 3 2 1 0 

( 16:77 )  ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ £ 
show that the resurrection of the dead and Great Gathering will occur instan-
taneously, in a ﬂash, but the narrow human reason requires some tangible 
example so that it can conceive of this wondrous, extraordinary, and unpar-
alleled event, and accept it?

T h e   A n s w e r :  At the resurrection there will be the return of spirits to their 
bodies, the reviviﬁcation of the bodies, and the remaking of the bodies. It 
consists of three matters.

First Matter

THE  FIRST  MATTER:  An  example  for  the  return  of  spirits  to  their 
bodies is the mustering, at a loud bugle call, of the members of a disciplined 
army after they have dispersed to rest. Yes, the Sur of the Angel Israﬁl is 
no less powerful than an army bugle. The spirits, too, who while in post-
eternity, reply with F E  to the question ( 16:77 )  C B which comes 
from pre-eternity, are inﬁnitely more subjugated, disciplined, and obedient 
than the soldiers of an army. The Thirtieth Word has demonstated with deci-
sive proofs that not only spirits, but all particles, form a divine army and are 
its soldiers under command.

Second Matter

SECOND MATTER: An example for the reviviﬁcation of bodies is the 
springing to life in an instant of the hundred thousand electric lights of a large 
city on a festival night, switched on from one centre. It would be possible 
to light up in the same way a hundred million lamps scattered over the face 
of the earth from one centre. Since through the training and instruction in 
regularity and order it has received from its Creator, a creature of Almighty 
Allah like electricity – a servant and candleholder in His guesthouse – pos-
sesses  this  quality,  surely  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  could  occur  in  the 
twinkling of an eye within the bounds of the regular laws of divine wisdom 
which thousands of luminous servants represent, like electricity.

Third Matter

THIRD  MATTER:  An  example  for  the  remaking  of  bodies  instanta-
neously  is  the  perfect  remaking  within  a  few  days  of  all  the  trees  in  the 
spring,  which  are  far  more  numerous  than  all  humanity,  together  with  all 
their leaves, in exactly the same way as those of the previous spring; and the 

46

THE RAYS

bringing into being, again like those of previous springs, all the blossoms, 
fruits  and  leaves  of  the  trees  with  the  speed  of  lightning;  and  the  sudden 
awakening of the uncountable numbers of seeds, grains, and roots, which 
are the source of the spring, and their unfolding and being raised to life; and 
reﬂecting the meaning of “ resurrection after death, ” the sudden raising to 
life at a command of the upright skeleton-like corpses of the trees; and the 
reanimation of the innumerable members of all the species of small animals; 
and  the  reviviﬁcation  of  all  the  sorts  of  ﬂying  insects,  particularly  those 
which continually cleaning their faces, eyes, and wings, remind us of our 
ablutions and cleanliness, and caress our faces – the resurrection and remak-
ing of all the members of this tribe within a few days every spring before our 
very eyes together with all the other species, despite being greater in number 
than all humankind since the time of Adam, provides not one example of the 
remaking of all human bodies at the resurrection, but thousands.

Yes, since this world is the realm of wisdom and the hereafter the realm 
of power, numerous divine names like All-Wise, Arranger, Disposer, and 
Nurturer, as well as dominical wisdom, require that the creation of things 
in this world is gradual and in the course of time. In the hereafter, however, 
power  and  mercy  will  be  manifested  more  than  wisdom,  and  there  being 
no need for matter, time, and waiting, things will be made instantaneously. 
Alluding to the fact that things which are made here in a day or in a year will 
be made in the hereafter in an instant or a ﬂash, the Qur’an of Miraculous 
Exposition states:

( 16:77 ) « ª © ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ £ 
If you want to be as certain about the occurrence of the resurrection of the 
dead as you are about the arrival of next spring, study the Tenth and Twenty-
Ninth Words carefully, which are about this, and you will see! If you do not 
then believe that it will occur as you believe the coming of spring, come and 
stick your ﬁnger in my eye!

Fourth Matter

A  FOURTH  MATTER:  The  death  of  the  world  and  Doomsday.  The 
sudden collision with this globe, our guesthouse, at a dominical command, 
of a planet or comet, could wipe out this dwelling place of ours. Like the 
destruction in a minute of a palace the building of which had taken ten years.
The above summaries of the four matters of the resurrection are sufﬁcient 

for now, and we return to our main subject.

Also, is it at all possible that the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, which 
is the eloquent interpreter of all the universe’s elevated truths, the miraculous 

THE SECOND RAY – CONCLUSION

47

tongue of all the perfections of the universe’s Creator and the wondrous col-
lection of all His aims, should not be that Creator’s word? Allah forbid, to 
the number of the mysteries of its verses.

Also, is it at all possible that the All-Wise Maker should cause his liv-
ing  and  conscious  creatures  to  speak  with  one  another  in  all  their  myriad 
tongues, and that He should know their voices and what they say, and listen 
to  them  and  clearly  reply  through  His  acts  and  bounties,  but  Himself  not 
speak or not be able to speak? Is there any possibility or probability of this? 
Since self-evidently He speaks and those primarily addressed by His speech, 
who comprehend it perfectly, are human beings; even more certainly fore-
most the Qur’an and all well-known holy scriptures are His speech.

Also, is it at all possible that the All-Wise Maker, Who made the uni-
verse a means of making Himself known, loved, and praised; and through 
His multifarious bounties makes living creatures happy and contented, and 
their thanks and gratitude a signiﬁcant pivot of His dominicality; and made 
the vast universe together with all its elements and realms, a docile servant, 
a dwelling- place, an exhibition, and banquet; and so wanted to multiply the 
thousands  of  all  the  different  sorts  of  animate  beings  that  He  made  some 
of the leaves of trees that do not bear fruit like the poplar and elm both the 
cradle, and the womb, and the foodstore for the living creatures that perform 
their gloriﬁcations in the air, that is, for a regiment of ﬂies; – is it at all possi-
ble that having done all this he should leave empty, purposeless, and without 
owner,  life,  spirit,  or  inhabitants  the  adorned  heavens  and  light-scattering 
stars; that is, that He should leave them without angels and spirit beings? 
Allah forbid, to the number of angels and spirit beings!

Also, is it at all possible that the All-Wise Maker, the Disposer, should 
write with the pen of His determining in the seeds and fruits of the com-
monest plant and smallest tree their origins and ends and the courses of their 
lives within a perfect order, and that He should write with perfect order and 
differentiation the origins and results of the vast spring as though it were a 
tree and not remain indifferent to the least signﬁcant things, then not record 
the actions and deeds of man, which have great importance, since he is the 
result of the universe, the vicegerent of the earth, the supervisor of all the 
realms of beings and their ofﬁcer; that He should not include them within 
His determining or be unconcerned with them? Allah forbid, to the number 
of the deeds of man, all of which will be weighed up on the scales!

A Supplication 

[ This treatise proves with extraordinary decisiveness, authenticity, and 
certainty together with wondrous conciseness, the most important of the 
fundamentals of belief such as the necessary existence, unity, and one-
ness of Allah, the splendour of His dominicality, the immensity of His 
power, the breadth of His mercy, the universality of His sovereignty, 
the comprehensiveness of His knowledge, and the all-inclusiveness of 
His wisdom. The indications of the resurrection of the dead, and espe-
cially those emphasized at the end, are extremely powerful. ]
Introduction 
This Eighth Proof of the Fundamentals of Belief 1 offers evidence for the 
necessary existence and unity of Allah, and certain proofs of the comprehen-
siveness of dominicality and the immensity of divine power. It proves too 
both the comprehensiveness of divine sovereignty, and the extensiveness of 
divine mercy, and the encompassment of divine knowledge, and the fact that 
divine wisdom embraces all the beings of the universe.

I n   S h o r t :  In each of the introductory passages of this Eighth Proof are 
eight conclusions. 2 Proving these eight conclusions through their evidences, 
this Eighth Proof has high value.

1.   The  Eighth  Proof  of  the  Fundamentals  of  Belief  refers  to  this  treatise’s  position 
among the parts of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  included in the collection called A s â - y ı   M u s a  ( The 
Staff of Moses ). [ Tr. ]

2.  All the Proofs of the Fundamentals of Belief demonstrate the necessary existence 
and unity of Allah explicitly, and their other conclusions indirectly. In addition to proving 
explicitly Allah’s  necessary  existence  and  unity,  this  Eighth  Proof, A  Supplication,  has 
nine conclusions. It proves: 

i. The majesty of dominicality;
ii. The tremendousness of divine power;
iii. The comprehensiveness of divine sovereignty;
iv. The unbounded extensiveness of divine mercy;
v. The fact that divine knowledge embraces all things;
vi. The encompassment of divine wisdom;
vii. The glittering magniﬁcence of divine rule.

[ This treatise, A Supplication, which forms the Third Ray, is a sort of 
commentary on the above verse. ]

Allah’s Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), 
the  supreme  Qur’anic  commentator  and  interpreter,  expounded  one  level 
– about divine unity–  of the numerous luminous levels of this sublime verse 
in one of the ninety-nine sections of his peerless supplication, J a u s h a n   a l -
K a b i r . Alluding in the supplication through a thousand and one divine names 
to a thousand and one proofs of divine unity, he described his Sustainer. One 
of those sections is this:

This sample shows that the Noble Messenger’s ( UWBP ) knowledge of  
Allah and his proofs of divine unity were at such a level that he is unequalled 
and that in this ﬁeld he is the supreme leader. By following him, everyone 
may enter that treasury. It is clear that knowledge, sciences, and arts are per-
fected through the conjunction of ideas and blending of minds; through ideas 
being combined and different works complementing each other, the works 
are perfected. This is why the craftsman who invented the repeater riﬂe was 

َكَ(cid:178)اَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126)

more skilful than the one who invented the machine gun now. Whereas the 
person who listens attentively with the ear of the heart to the supplication 
of J a u s h a n   a l - K a b i r , imagining himself to be in the presence of the Unlet-
tered  Prophet  ( UWBP )  and  hearing  it  from  him,  will  understand  and  see 
that those thousand and one sacred truths, which comprise a thousand and 
one proofs and descriptions and each of which is the conclusion of a chain 
of thought and a window opening onto divine unity, were composed by one 
unlettered ( UWBP ) among an illiterate people in an illiterate environment, 
and a nation lacking a holy scripture in totally original, inventive fashion 
imitating no one, solving on his own through illumination the riddle of cre-
ation  and  talisman  of  the  universe.  This  was  not  in  imitative fashion  like 
today with the help and supplications of thousands of other luminaries, but 
out  of  his  boundless  compassion  and  inﬁnite  clemency  – due  to  which  he 
invites to listen both the inhabitants of the heavens under the celestial dome 
and  the  vast  congregation  in  the  huge  mosque  of  the  universe –   he  seeks 
help, succour, mercy, and salvation for men, and he says:

Here, the Supreme Qur’anic Commentator is expounding one aspect of 

َكَ(cid:178)اَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126)

the above verse. A short translation and meaning of it is this. He says:

“ O  One  of  Glory  Whose  magniﬁcence  is  to  be  seen  in  the  skies  and 
heavenly bodies! O One of Perfection, the signs and evidences of Whose 
unity are to be observed in the earth and in all its beings! O Necessary Exist-
ent,  proofs  to  Whose  necessary  existence  are  present  in  all  things  and  all 
creatures!  O  All-Glorious  One  of  Perfection,  Who  creates  all  the  strange 
beings in the vast oceans! O Muniﬁcent Creator, Who creates the treasures 
stored up in the mountains to meet the needs of living beings! O Beaute-
ous Bestower of Bounties, Who creates everything in the best way, admin-
isters  them  in  the  best  way,  and  provides  all  the  necessaries  for  each  in 

THE THIRD RAY

53

the  best  way!  O  Omnipotent  One,  Sustainer  of  All  Things,  to  Whom  all 
things have recourse in all matters, for all needs, and on Whom all beings 
rely in all circumstances, and to Whom pertain all rights and dues, judge-
ments and rule! O Gracious and Knowing One, the clear traces of Whose 
favours, and the manifestations of Whose grace, and the subtle inscriptions 
of Whose arts, and the ﬁne gifts of Whose mercy, are observed in all things! 
O  All-Powerful  and  Wise  One,  Who  made  the  universe  an  exhibition  of 
marvels in order to display His power to His conscious creatures, and made 
all  His  artefacts  heralds  and  proclamations  announcing  His  perfections, 
such as His power, wisdom, and mercy! You are free of all impotence and 
fault; Other than You there is no god who might succour our plight! Mercy! 
Mercy! Save us from Hell-ﬁre! ”

Allah’s Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), 
the Supreme Qur’anic commentator, expounded the verse with this suppli-
cation.  Then  the  Messenger’s  important,  precise,  intelligent,  and  exacting 
student, Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ), composed a suppli-
cation-like commentary on his Master’s supplicatory commentary, and dis-
covering another aspect of the supplication, uncovered a further face of the 
verse. Keeping in mind his Noble Master’s supplication, he described that 
aspect of the verse as follows. We gave a short explanatory translation of the 
supplication above, and so we are doing for this one:

“ O Allah! In the heavens are no rotations or motions but through their 
order and wisdom they testify to your existence, making You known. On the 
earth are no changes and transformations, and no states or circumstances, 
but through their order and regularity they make You known together with 
Your unity and dominicality. In the seas is no creature, nor even a drop of 
water,  but  through  its  wisdom  it  points  to  Your  existence  and  testiﬁes  to 
Your dominicality. In the mountains are no minerals, chemicals, or rocks, 
stored up for living beings, but through their uses and beneﬁts they testify 
to Your dominicality and existence. In the heart is no thought inspired from 
the Unseen but it points to Your existence and testiﬁes to Your unity. On the 
trees are no leaves but through their order and wisdom they recognize You, 
that is, they proclaim that they are the works of Your art. In bodies there are 
no movements but they testify to Your dominicality. O my Creator! For the 
sake of Your power, which subjugates the heavens and the earth, subjugate 
to me those things that I wish! ”

Now, an impotent student of Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) 
and wretched servant of the Qur’an, expounding this supplication of his also 

54

THE RAYS

with  a  supplication,  wanted  to  disclose  in  the  light  of  the  greatest  divine 
name one aspect of the above sublime verse by expounding that aspect of the 
supplication, which is only one of the hundred sections of the supplication of 
the Supreme Interpreter, that is, J a u s h a n  a l - K a b i r . The student of Imam ‘Ali 
( May Allah be pleased with him ) says:

O   M y   A l l a h   a n d   S u s t a i n e r !
I see through the eyes of belief, the instruction and light of the Qur’an, 
the teachings of Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ),  and  the  indications  of  the  name  of  All-  Wise,  that  in the  heav-
ens there are no rotations and motions but through their order and regular-
ity they point to Your existence. There is no heavenly body but through its 
silently performing its duty and remaining in place without prop it testiﬁes to 
Your dominicality and unity. There is no star but through its balanced crea-
tion, regular position, luminous smile, and the stamp of its similarity to the 
other stars, it indicates the majesty of Your Godhead and Your unity. There 
is not one of the twelve planets but through its wise motion, docile subjec-
tion, orderly duties, and signiﬁcant satellites, it testiﬁes to Your necessary 
existence and indicates the sovereignty of Your Godhead.

Yes,  – O Creator of the Heavens and Earth, Who directs and administers 
all  particles  together  with  all  the  orderly  components  they  make  up,  and 
spins the planets and their regular satellites, subjugating them to His com-
mand! –  just as each of the inhabitants of the heavens testiﬁes on its own, so 
in their totality they testify to Your necessary existence and unity in a way so 
clear and powerful that shining proofs to the number of stars in the heavens 
afﬁrm that testimony.

Also, appearing as a regular army or imperial ﬂeet decked out with elec-
tric lights, the limpid, beautiful, spotless heavens with their extraordinarily 
huge and speedy bodies, point clearly to the splendour of your dominical-
ity and tremendousness of Your power, which creates all things; and to the 
boundless extent of Your sovereignty, which overspreads the heavens, and 
to Your mercy, which embraces all living things; and testiﬁes indubitably to 
the comprehensiveness of Your knowledge, which is concerned with all the 
states and circumstances of all the creatures of the heavens, and embraces 
them and orders them, and to Your wisdom, which encompasses all things. 
This testimony is so evident it is as though the stars are the words and lumi-
nous embodiments of the skies’ testimony.

Also,  like  disciplined  soldiers,  orderly  ships,  wondrous  aeroplanes,  or 
marvellous  lamps,  the  stars  in  the  arena  of  the  heavens,  and  in  their  seas 

THE THIRD RAY

55

and vast spaces, show the glittering splendour of the sovereignty of Your 
Godhead. As is suggested by the duties of the sun  – one star among the mem-
bers of that army –  which are related to its planets and our earth, some of its 
companions, the other stars, look to the worlds of the hereafter and are not 
without duties; they are the suns of eternal worlds.

O   N e c e s s a r i l y   E x i s t e n t !   O   S i n g l e   O n e   o f   U n i t y !
These wondrous stars, these strange suns and moons, are subjugated, set 
in order, and employed in Your dominions, in Your heavens, through Your 
command, power, and strength, and Your administration and direction. All 
those heavenly bodies glorify and exalt their single Creator, Who creates, 
spins, and administers them; through the tongue of disposition, they declare: 
“ Glory be to Allah! Allah is Most Great! ” Through all their gloriﬁcations, I

I  have  understood  through  the  teaching  of  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  and 
instruction of Your Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ) that just as the heavens and stars testify to Your existence and unity, 
so  with  its  clouds,  lightning,  thunder,  winds,  and  rain,  does the  atmos-
phere testify to Your necessary existence and unity.

Yes, the lifeless, unconscious clouds sending the water of life, rain, to the 
assistance of needy living beings is only through Your mercy and wisdom; 
confused chance could in no way interfere. The most powerful of electricity, 
lightning, which alluding to its potentiality for lighting, encourages man to 
beneﬁt from it and spectacularly lights up Your power in space. The thunder 
announces the coming of rain, causing boundless space to speak, and makes 
the heavens ring out with the reverberations of its glorifying; it hallows You 
verbally, testifying to Your dominicality. The winds, which are charged with 
numerous  duties  such  as  providing  the  sustenance  most  vital  for  animate 
creatures, and the easiest to beneﬁt from, and ensuring and facilitating res-
piration, for some purpose turn the atmosphere into a tablet for writing and 
erasing, thus pointing to the activity of Your power and testifying to Your 
existence. Similarly, the mercy milked through Your compassion from the 
clouds and sent to living beings, testiﬁes through the words of its balanced, 
orderly droplets, to the breadth of Your mercy and compassion.

The clouds, lightning, thunder, wind, and rain each testify on their own to 
Your necessary existence, so too as a whole, being one within the other and 
assisting each other in their duties, although they are by nature dissimilar 
and opposed to each other, they indicate most powerfully Your unity. They 
point too to the magniﬁcence of Your dominicality, which makes the vast 
atmosphere into an exhibition of wonders, on some days ﬁlling and empty-
ing  it  several  times;  and  to  the  immensity  and  all-pervasiveness  of  Your 
power,  which  makes  it  resemble  a  slate  which  is  written  on  then  rubbed 
clean, and wrings it out like a sponge and waters the garden of the earth; 
and  to  your  unbounded  mercy  and  limitless  rule,  which  under  the  veil  of 
the atmosphere administer all the earth and all creatures. Moreover, the air 
is employed in duties so wise and the clouds and rain utilized in beneﬁts so 
percipient that if it were not for a knowledge and wisdom that encompass all 
things, they could not be thus employed.
O   D o e r   W h o   a c t s   a s   H e   w i s h e s !
Through Your activity in the atmosphere, Your power, which continu-
ously displays examples of the resurrection of the dead and Great Gathering 
and transforms the summer into winter and winter into summer and similar 
acts, gives the sign that it will transform this world into the hereafter and 
there display its everlasting acts.

O   A l l - P o w e r f u l   O n e   o f   G l o r y !
The  air,  clouds,  rain,  and  thunder  and  lightning  in  the  atmosphere  are 
subjugated and employed in Your dominions, through Your command and 
power  and  strength.  These  creatures,  which  by  nature  are  so  different  to 
each other, sanctify their Ruler and Commander Who makes them submit 
instanteously to his swift commands; they praise and extol His mercy.

O   G l o r i o u s   C r e a t o r   o f   t h e   H e a v e n s   a n d   E a r t h !
Through the instruction of the All-Wise Qur’an and teaching of Allah’s 
Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), I believe and know 
that just as the heavens testify to Your necessary existence and unity through 
its stars and the atmosphere testiﬁes through all it contains, so the earth tes-
tiﬁes to Your existence and unity through all its creatures and states.

Indeed,  there  is  no  change  on  the  earth,  such  as  that  of  the  trees  and 
animals changing their garb every year, but through its orderliness it indi-
cates  Your  existence  and  unity.  There  is  no  animal  but  through  its  suste-
nance being compassionately provided in relation to its need and weakness, 

THE THIRD RAY

and its being given all the members and faculties necessary to pursue its life, 
it  testiﬁes to Your existence and unity. There is not a plant or animal created 
before our eyes in the spring that through its wondrous art, its subtle adorn-
ment, its being distinguished from all other creatures, and through its order 
and balance, it makes You known. The marvels of Your power which ﬁll 
the earth and are known as plants and animals, and their creation from seeds 
and grains and droplets of ﬂuid, perfectly, without error, in adorned fashion, 
each  with  its  distinguishing  features,  form  a  testimony  more  brilliant  and 
powerful than the sun to the existence, unity, wisdom, and endless power of 
their All-Wise Maker.

Also,  there  is  no  element,  such  as  air,  water,  light,  ﬁre,  and  earth,  but 
through its performing functions consciously and perfectly despite its lack 
of  consciousness,  and  being  the  means  for  the  regular  arrival  of  various 
orderly fruits from the treasury of the Unseen despite being simple, without 
order, and overrunning and spreading everywhere, it testiﬁes to Your exist-
ence and unity.

O   O m n i p o t e n t   C r e a t o r !   O   O m n i s c i e n t   O p e n e r   U p   o f   F o r m s !   O   A c t i v e

Just  as  together  with  all  its  inhabitants  the  earth  testiﬁes  to  the  neces-
sary existence of its Creator, so too, O Single One of Unity! O Clement and 
Kind One! O Most Bounteous Provider!, through the stamp on its face and 
the stamps on the faces of all its inhabitants and their unity and being one 
within the other and assisting each other, and through all the names and acts 
of dominicality that look to them being the same, it testiﬁes with the utmost 
clarity to Your unity and oneness; indeed it offers testimony to the number 
of its creatures.

Similarly, through its being an army encampment, an exhibition, a place 
of instruction, and through all the four hundred thousand different nations 
present in the divisions of its plants and animals regularly being given all 
their  necessary  equipment,  the  earth  points  to  the  magniﬁcence  of  Your 
dominicality and to the fact that Your power penetrates all things.

Also, all the different sustenance of innumerable living beings, and its 
being given to them compassionately, generously, at exactly the right time 
from simple, dry earth, and the complete subjugation and obedience to the 
dominical  commands  of  those  innumerable  individuals,  demonstrates  that 
Your  mercy  embraces  all  things  and  that  your  sovereignty  encompasses 
them.

Also, the despatch of the caravans of creatures, which are in a state of 
constant change on the earth, and the alternations of life and death, and the 
administration  and  management  of  the  plants  and  animals,  and  this  being 
possible  only  through  a  knowledge  that  is  concerned  with  all  things  and 
an inﬁnite wisdom governing in all things, points to Your comprehensive 
knowledge and wisdom.

Also, the supreme importance given to man, who in a brief span performs 
inﬁnite duties, has been equiped with abilities and faculties which suggest he 
is to live for all eternity, and has disposal over all the beings of the earth; and 
the inﬁnite outlay made for him in this training- ground of the world, this 
temporary military encampment of the earth, this transient exhibition; and 
the boundless manifestations of dominicality, innumerable divine addresses, 
and incalculable divine gifts, which look to him, surely cannot be contained 
in this ﬂeeting, sorry, confused life, this transitory world so full of tribula-
tion. Since they could be only for another, eternal, life and an everlasting 
abode of bliss, they point to, even testify to, the bestowals of the hereafter in 
the everlasting realm.

O   C r e a t o r   o f   A l l   T h i n g s !
All the creatures of the earth are administered and subjugated in Your 
dominions, in Your earth, through Your strength and power and will, and 
Your knowledge and wisdom. The dominicality whose activity is observed 
on  the  face  of  the  earth  is  so  comprehensive  and  all-  embracing,  and  its 
administration and management are so perfect and precise, and it is carried 
out with such sameness that it shows it is a dominicality, a disposal, which 
is a whole that cannot be broken into parts and a universal that cannot be 
divided up. Together with all its inhabitants, the earth sanctiﬁes and gloriﬁes 
its Maker with innumerable tongues far clearer than the spoken word; they 
praise  and  extol  their  Glorious  Provider  for  His  inﬁnite  bounties  with  the 
tongues of their beings.

as the skies, the atmosphere and the earth testify to Your unity and necessary 
existence, so do the seas, rivers, streams, and springs testify to them most 
clearly. Yes, there is no being in the seas, which are like the strange boilers 
of our world producing steam  – there is not a drop of them even –  but through 
its  well-ordered  being,  its  beneﬁts  and  state,  it  makes  known  its  Creator. 
And of the strange creatures whose splendid sustenance is given them out of 
simple sand and water, and the living creatures of the seas with their regular 
and orderly beings, especially of the ﬁshes who populate the seas with one 
ﬁsh producing a million eggs, there is not one but through its creation and its 
duties, its being sustained and administered, nurtured and superintended, it 
indicates its Creator and testiﬁes to its Provider.

Also, of the precious, decorated jewels in the seas, there is not one but 
through its attractive creation and beneﬁcial qualities it recognizes You and 
makes You known. Yes, just as they testify to You singly, so too in so far as 
they are all mixed up together, bear the same stamp in their natures, are cre-
ated with great ease, and are found in great numbers, they altogether testify 
to Your unity.

Also, through the seas, which surround the globe with its land masses, 
being held suspended without spilling over or dispersing or overrunning 
the land as the earth voyages around the sun; and creating the multifarious 
ornamented living creatures and jewels out of simple sand and water, and 
all  their  sustenance  and  other  needs  being  supplied  in  general  and  com-
plete fashion; and through their administration, and through none of the 
inevitable innumerable corpses of their dead fellows being found on the 
surface of the seas; they testify indirectly to their number to Your exist-
ence and its necessity.

Also,  just  as  they  point  clearly  to  the  splendid  sovereignty  of  Your 
dominicality and to the magniﬁcence of Your power, which encompasses 
all things; so do they indicate the limitless breadth of Your mercy and rule, 
which govern all things from the huge yet orderly stars beyond the skies 
to the tiny ﬁshes at the bottom of the sea, which are nurtured in regular 
fashion. They point too to Your knowledge and wisdom, which as dem-
onstrated by the order, beneﬁts, instances of wisdom, and the balance and 
equilibrium of all things, encompass and comprehend them. There being 
such reservoirs of mercy for the travellers in this guesthouse of the world 
and  their  being  utilized  for  man’s  journeying,  and  for  his  ship,  and  his 
beneﬁt shows that the One who bestows such a profusion of gifts out of the 
seas on His guests of one night in a wayside inn, must surely have eternal 

60

seas of mercy at the seat of His everlasting rule, and those here are merely 
their small and transitory samples.

Thus, the truly wondrous situation of the seas around the earth and the 
exceedingly orderly administration and nurturing of their creatures demon-
strate self-evidently that it is only through Your power, will, and adminis-
tration that they are subjugated to Your command in Your dominions; and 
through  the  tongues  of  their  beings  they  sanctify  their  Creator,  declaring: 
“ Allah is Most Great! ”

Through the instruction of Your Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ) and the teaching of the Wise Qur’an, I have understood that 
just as the seas with their strange creatures recognize You and make You 
known, so do the mountains through the wise services they perform. For 
they  ensure  that  the  earth  is  released  from  the  effects  of  earthquakes  and 
internal upheavals; save it from being overrun by the seas; purify the air of 
poisonous gases; are tanks for the saving and storage of water; and treasuries 
for the minerals and metals necessary for living beings.

Yes, there is not one of the stones to be found in mountains, or the various 
substances used as remedies for illness, or the varieties of metals and miner-
als, which are essential for living beings and especially human beings, or the 
species of plants that adorn the mountains and plains with their ﬂowers and 
fruits, but through the wisdom, order, and ﬁne creation it displays, which 
is impossible to ascribe to chance, it testiﬁes to the necessary existence of 
an inﬁnitely Powerful, Wise, Compassionate, and Muniﬁcent Maker. This 
is especially true of substances found in the mountains like salt, potassium 
oxalate, quinine sulphate, and alum, which superﬁcially resemble each other, 
but whose tastes are totally dissimilar; and particularly of all the varieties of 
plants, and the great diversity of their ﬂowers and fruits. Moreover, through 
their being administered and managed as a totality, and their origins, situa-
tions, creation, and art all being similar, and the ease, speed, and cheapness 
in their making, they testify to the unity and oneness of their Maker.

Also, the creatures on the surface of the mountains and inside them being 
made  everywhere  on  the  earth  at  the  same  time  in  the  same  fashion,  per-
fectly and without error, with none impeding others, and their being created 
without confusion despite being intermingled with all the other sorts of other 
creatures, all point to the splendour of Your dominicality and the immensity 
of Your power, for which nothing is difﬁcult.

THE THIRD RAY

Also, the mountains  – both their surfaces and their interiors –  being ﬁlled 
in orderly fashion with trees, plants, and minerals to meet the innumerable 
needs of all the living creatures on the earth, and even to supply the rem-
edies for their many different illnesses, and gratify their various appetites 
and  tastes,  and  these  being  displayed  for  those  who  need  them,  indicates 
the inﬁnite breadth of Your mercy and inﬁnite extent of Your sovereignty. 
While their being prepared percipiently, knowingly, without confusion, in 
orderly fashion according to need, despite being all mixed up and concealed 
in the darkness of the soil layer, indicates Your all-embracing knowledge, 
which encompasses all things, and the comprehensiveness of Your wisdom, 
which sets all things in order. Then the storing up of medicinal substances, 
minerals, and metals points clearly to the compassionate, generous, planned 
processes of Your dominicality and the subtle precautions of Your grace.

Also, the lofty mountains holding stored up in orderly fashion the reserves 
to meet the future needs of the travellers in the guesthouse of this world, and 
their being stores stocked up with all the treasures necessary for life, indi-
cates, indeed, testiﬁes, that the Maker who is thus Muniﬁcent and hospita-
ble, All-Wise and Compassionate, Powerful and nurturing, surely possesses 
eternal treasuries for His never-ending bestowal in an everlasting realm, for 
His guests whom He clearly loves. There the stars will perform the function 
the mountains perform here.

O   O n e   P o w e r f u l   O v e r   A l l   T h i n g s !
The mountains and the creatures within them are subjugated and stored 
up in Your dominions through Your power and strength, Your knowledge 
and wisdom! They sanctify and glorify their Creator, Who subjugates and 
employs them in this way.

O   M e r c i f u l   C r e a t o r ,   C o m p a s s i o n a t e   S u s t a i n e r !
Through the instruction of Your Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ) and the teaching of the Wise Qur’an I have understood that 
just as the heavens, atmosphere, earth, seas, and mountains, together with 
their creatures and all they contain, recognize You and make You known; 
so too do all the trees and plants, together with all their leaves and ﬂow-
ers  and  fruits.  All  their  leaves,  with  their  ecstatic  movements  and  recita-
tions; all their ﬂowers, which describe through their decoration the names 
of  their  Maker;  and  all  their  fruits,  which  smile  with  their  agreeableness 
and the manifestation of Your compassion, testify  – through the order within 
their  wondrous  art,  which  is  utterly  impossible  to  ascribe  to  chance,  and 
the balance within the order, and the adornment within the balance, and the 

62

THE RAYS

embroideries within the adornment, and the ﬁne and various scents within 
the  embroideries,  and  the  varying  tastes  of  the  fruits  within  the  scents –  
so  clearly  as  to  be  self-evident  to  the  necessary  existence  of  an  inﬁnitely 
Compassionate  and  Muniﬁcent  Maker.  At  the  same  time,  their  similarity 
and  mutual  resemblance  throughout  the  earth,  and  their  bearing  the  same 
stamps on their creation, and their being related in their administration and 
organization, and the coincidence of the creative acts and dominical names 
connected with them, and the innumerable members of their one hundred 
thousand species being raised one within the other without confusion, forms 
a testimony through them as a whole to the unity and oneness of their Neces-
sarily Existent Maker.

Also, just as they testify to Your necessary existence and unity, so too 
the  nurturing  and  administration  in  hundreds  of  ways  of  the  innumerable 
members of the army of living creatures on the face of the earth, which is 
formed of four hundred thousand different nations, perfectly, with no con-
fusion or difﬁculty, point to the majesty of Your dominicality within Your 
unity and to the immensity of Your power, which creates a ﬂower as eas-
ily as the spring, and its comprehending all things. They point also to the 
unlimited breadth of Your mercy, which prepares innumerable varieties of 
foods for animals and human beings all over the earth; and through all those 
works  and  bestowals,  administering  and  nurturing,  being  carried  out  with 
perfect regularity, and everything, even minute particles, being obedient and 
subjugated to those commands, they indicate certainly the inﬁnite extent of 
Your rule; and through every part of those trees and plants, like their leaves, 
blossoms, fruits, roots, branches, and twigs, being made with every aspect of 
them being known and seen, in accordance with useful purposes, instances 
of wisdom, and beneﬁts, they point clearly with innumerable ﬁngers to Your 
knowledge,  which  embraces  all  things,  and  to  the  comprehensiveness  of 
Your wisdom. With innumerable tongues, they praise and extol the utterly 
perfect beauty of Your art and the sheer beauty of Your perfect bestowal.

Also, these precious gifts and bounties and this extraordinary outlay and 
bestowal, in this temporary hostel and transitory guesthouse, for this brief 
time  and  ﬂeeting  life,  indicate  through  the  hands  of  the  trees  and  plants, 
indeed, testify, that in order not to make all creatures say, contrary to the 
necessary result of all His expense and bestowal which is to make Himself 
loved and known: “ You gave us a taste, but then executed us without per-
mitting us to eat; ” and not to nullify the sovereignty of His Godhead, and 
not deny His inﬁnite mercy and make it denied, and in order not to turn all

his yearning friends into enemies through depriving them thus, the muniﬁ-
cent  All-Compassionate  One  has  of  a  certainty  prepared  for  His  servants 
whom He will send to an everlasting realm, an eternal world, fruit-bearing 
trees, and ﬂowering plants appropriate to Paradise out of the treasuries of 
His mercy, in His eternal Paradises. Those here are merely samples to show 
the customers.

Also, just as through the words of their leaves, ﬂowers and fruits, the trees 
and plants praise, sanctify, and glorify You, so each one of those words sin-
gly declare You to be holy. The gloriﬁcations of fruits in particular through 
the tongue of disposition  – with the great variety of their original ﬂesh, their 
wondrous art, and extraordinary seeds, and those trays of food being given 
to hands of the trees and placed on them, and sent to Your living guests –  
their gloriﬁcations are so evident they are almost verbal. All are subjugated 
and submissive to Your command in Your dominions through Your power 
and strength, and Your wisdom and bestowal!

Through the instruction of Your Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ) and the teaching of the Wise Qur’an, I have under-
stood  and  believed  that  just  as  plants  and  trees  recognize  You  and  make 
known  Your  sacred  attributes  and  beautiful  names;  so  too  among human 
beings and the animals, which are those living creatures which have spir-
its, there is not one that through its internal and external members, which 
work as regularly as clockwork, and the extremely ﬁne order and balance 
of their bodies, and the signiﬁcant beneﬁts and purposes of their senses and 
faculties, and the great art in their making, and their being decked out with 
much  wisdom,  and  the  precise  equilibrium  of  their  physical  systems,  but 
it  testiﬁes  to  Your  necessary  existence  and  the  reality  of  Your  attributes. 
For  blind  force,  unconscious  nature,  and  aimless  chance  could  in  no  way 
interfere in such percipient, delicate art, and conscious subtle wisdom, and 
perfect providential balance; they could not be their work; it is impossible. 
It is also utterly impossible that living creatures made themselves, for then 
each of their particles would have to possess comprehensive knowledge and 

64

THE RAYS

wisdom like a god, to be able to know, see, and make all the parts of their 
bodies and form it, indeed, it would have to be able to know, see, and make 
everything in the world connected with it, then the body’s formation could 
be referred to it, and it could be said that “ it makes itself. ”

Also, their being subject to the same administration, and the same plan-
ning, and their all being the same kind, and their bearing the same stamp, 
such as the resemblance in features like the eye, ear, and mouth, and the 
unity  in  the  stamp  of  wisdom  observed  on  the  faces  of  members  of  the 
same species, and the resemblance in livelihood and creation, and their all 
being one within the other; there is not one of these circumstances but it 
testiﬁes categorically to Your unity, and, by the manifestations of all Your 
names which look to the universe being on each individual, to Your one-
ness within unity.

Also, through being equipped, trained, and subservient like a regular army 
and from the smallest to the largest, their conforming in orderly fashion to 
the commands of dominicality, human beings and the hundred thousand ani-
mal species on the face of the earth point to the degree of splendour of that 
dominicality; and through their great value despite their great multitude, and 
their perfection despite the speed of their making, and their great art despite 
the ease of their making, to the degree of grandeur of Your power. Also, they 
point decisively to the boundless expanse of Your mercy, which sends their 
sustenance to all of them, from the microbe to the rhinoceros, and the tiniest 
ﬂy to the largest bird, dispersed from east to west and north to south; and 
through  all  of  them  performing  their  natural  functions  like  soldiers  under 
command, and every spring the face of the earth being the encampment of 
an army newly taken under arms in place of those discharged the previous 
autumn, to the inﬁnite extent of Your sovereignty.

Also,  through  a  profound  knowledge  and  precise  wisdom  all  living 
creatures  being  miniature  copies  of  the  universe,  and  their  being  made 
faultlessly, with none of their parts being confused or any of their differ-
ent forms mixed up, they point to their number to Your knowledge, which 
embraces  all  things,  and  Your  wisdom,  which  comprehends  all  things; 
while  by  their  all  being  made  so  beautiful  and  ﬁne  as  to  be  miracles  of 
art and wonders of wisdom, they indicate in innumerable ways the utterly 
perfect beauty of Your dominical art, which You greatly love and want to 
exhibit; and through all of them, and particularly their young, being nour-
ished in the ﬁnest way, with their wishes and desires being satisﬁed, to the 
sweet beauty of Your grace.

loved, by causing them to die then not raising them again to life, and while 
He created them for an eternal love, to make them feel eternal hostility; to do 
that would not be possible. Men were sent to work in this world in order to 
live happily in another, eternal world, and to win that life. The names mani-
fested on man in this brief and ﬂeeting life indicate that men, who will be 
their mirrors in the eternal realm, will receive their eternal manifestations.

Yes, the true friend of the Eternal One should be eternal, and the con-

scious mirror of the Enduring One should be enduring.

It is understood from sound narrations that the spirits of animals will live 
eternally, and that certain individual animals, like the Hudhud of Solomon 
( UWP ) and his ants, Salih’s ( UWP ) she- camel, and the dog of the Com-
panions of the Cave, will go to the eternal realm with both their spirits and 
their bodies, 1 and that each species will have a single body that may be uti-
lized from time to time. This is also demanded by wisdom and reality, and 
mercy and dominicality.

O   A l l - P o w e r f u l   S e l f - S u b s i s t e n t   O n e !
All living creatures, beings with spirits, and conscious beings are subju-
gated to the commands of Your dominicality and employed in their innate 
duties only through Your power and strength, Your will and planning, and 
Your mercy and wisdom. Some have been subjugated to man, not because of

Through  the  instruction  of  Your  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be

stood and believe that just as the heavens, atmosphere, earth, land and sea, 
trees, plants, and animals, together with all their members, parts, and par-

and unity; so too living beings, the essence of the universe, and man, the 
essence  of  living  creatures,  and the  prophets, saints,  and puriﬁed  schol-
ars, the essence of men, and, through their visions, unfoldings, inspirations, 
and the discoveries of their hearts and intellects, which form the essence 
of the prophets, saints, and puriﬁed scholars, testify with the certainty of a 
hundredfold consensus to Your necessary existence, unity and oneness, and 
give news of them; and through their miracles, wonder-working, and certain 
proofs, prove what they tell of.

Yes, there is nothing that occurs to the heart, which looks to one who 
inspires  it  from  behind  the  veil  of  the  Unseen;  and  there  is  no  inspira-
tion, which makes one look to the giver of inspiration; and there is no cer-
tain  belief,  which  discloses  in  the  form  of  absolute  certainty  Your  sacred 
attributes and most beautiful names; and there is no luminous heart of the 
prophets and saints, which observes with the vision of certainty the lights of 
the Necessary Existent; and there is no enlightened intellect of the puriﬁed 
scholars and veracious ones, which conﬁrms and proves with the knowledge 
of certainty the signs of the existence of the Creator of All Things and the 
proofs of His unity;  – there is not one of these that does not testify to Your 
necessary  existence,  and  sacred  attributes,  and  Your  unity,  oneness,  and 
most beautiful names, and point to them and indicate them.

Also, just as relying on their miracles, wonder-working and proofs, all 
those  hundreds  of  thousands  of  truthful  bringers  of  good  news  testify  to 
Your  existence  and  unity;  so  they  unanimously  give  news  of,  proclaim, 
and prove the degree of majesty of Your dominicality, which governs from 
the administration of the totality of matters of the Sublime Throne, which 
encompasses all things, to knowing and hearing and administering the secret, 
private thoughts of the heart, and its desires and supplications. They tell of 
and prove too the immensity of Your power, which creates innumerable dif-
ferent things at once, and makes the greatest thing as easily as the smallest 
with no act impeding another and no matter obstructing another.

Also, they give news of and prove through their miracles and proofs the 
immense breadth of Your mercy, which makes the universe a magniﬁcent 
palace for beings with spirits, and especially man; has prepared Paradise and 
everlasting happiness for jinn and man; does not forget even the tiniest liv-
ing being; and tries to satisfy and please the most impotent heart.

They  give  news  too  of  the  inﬁnite  extent  of  Your  sovereignty,  which 
makes comply with Your commands all the realms of creatures from parti-
cles to the planets, and subjugates and employs them.

So  also  they  unanimously  testify  to  Your  comprehensive  knowledge, 
which  makes  the  universe  into  a  vast  book  containing  treatises  to  the 
numbers of its parts, and records the life stories of all beings in the Clear 
Record and Clear Book, which are the notebooks of the Preserved Tablet, 
and inscribes completely and without error in their seeds the indexes and 
programmes  of  all  trees  and  the  biographies  of  conscious  beings  in  the 
memories in their heads.

They testify too to the comprehensiveness of Your sacred wisdom, which 
attaches  numerous  purposes  to  all  beings,  causing  even  trees  to  produce 
results to the number of their fruits, and follows beneﬁts in all living beings 
to the number of their members, and even their parts and cells, and employ-
ing man’s tongue in numerous duties, equips it with the ability to weigh up 
tastes to the number of foods.

They  also  unanimously  testify  that  the  manifestations  of  the  names 
related to Your beauty and glory, samples of which are to be seen in this 
world, will continue in more brilliant fashion for all eternity, and that your 
bounties, samples of which are to be observed in this transitory world, will

of Your bounties in the everlasting realm, and to the wondrously beautiful 
manifestations  of  Your  beautiful  names,  which  will  be  manifested  totally 
in the abode of bliss, and they give good news of these. Believing that the

[ While being the Fifth Flash in meaning and degree, in form and sta-

Thirty-First Flash and is an important and subtle point concerning the 
verse, Ø × Ö Õ  ]
NOTE: Unlike  other  works,  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   starts  off  in 
veiled manner and gradually unfolds. The First Degree of this 
treatise is extremely subtle and profound in addition to being 
a most valuable truth. It took the form of a signiﬁcant discus-
sion governed by the feelings, an animated conversation about 
belief, a secret discourse of the heart peculiar to myself; it was 
healing for my various deep ills. Those completely in harmony 
and agreement with me may understand it. Otherwise it will not 
be entirely appreciated.

( 3:173 ) Ø × Ö Õ
One  time  when  I  had  been  isolated  from  everything  by  the  worldly,  I 
was afﬂicted with ﬁve kinds of exile. I suffered too at that time of old age 
from ﬁve illnesses arising in part from my sorrows. Due to the heedlessness 
resulting  from  the  distress,  I  looked  not  to  the  lights  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
which would have consoled and assisted me, but straight to my heart, and I 
sought my spirit. I saw that dominant in me were an overpowering desire for 
immortality, an intense love of existence, a great yearning for life, together 
with an inﬁnite impotence and endless want. But an awesome transience was 
extinguishing the immortality. Suffering that state of mind, I exclaimed like 
the sorrowing poet: 1

1.  This refers to Niyāzī al-Miṣrī ( 1218-1294 AD ), a Suﬁ poet who was born in the 
province of Malatya in Turkey. He studied in al-Azhar, hence the name al-Misri, wrote 
a d ī w ā n  of poetry and other works, and taught in the religious schools of Istanbul for many 
years. [ Tr. ]

I bowed my head in despair. Suddenly the verse, Ø × Ö Õ 
came to my assistance, summoning me to read it with attention. So I recited 
it ﬁve hundred times every day. Writing brieﬂy a part of the valuable lights 
which were unfolded to me in the form of the vision of certainty, and only 
nine lights and degrees, I refer readers to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  for the details, 
known  with  the  knowledge  of  certainty  rather  than  the  former  vision  of 
certainty.
The First Degree of the Luminous Verse “ F o r   u s   A l l a h   s u f ﬁ c e s  ” 

By virtue of a shadow in my essential being of a manifestation of one 
of the names of the One of Glory and Perfection, Who, possessing absolute 
perfection, is of Himself and for no other reason worthy of love, I had an 
innate  desire  for  immortality,  directed  not  to  my  own  immortality,  but  to 
the existence, perfection, and immortality of that Absolutely Perfect One. 
However,  due  to  heedlessness,  that  innate  love  had  lost  its  way,  become 
attached to the shadow and enamoured of the mirror of immortality. Then 
the verse, Ø × Ö Õ raised the veil. I saw and felt and expe-
rienced at the degree of absolute certainty that the pleasure and happiness 
of my immortality lay exactly and in more perfect form in the immortality 
of the Enduring One of Perfection, in afﬁrming my Sustainer and Allah, in 
believing in Him and submitting to Him. For an undying truth was realized 
through His immortality. The insight of belief established that “ my essential 
being is the shadow of a divine name which is both enduring and eternal; so 
will not die. ”

Also, through the insight of belief, one knows the existence of the Abso-
lutely  Perfect  One,  the  One  Who  is  absolutely  beloved,  and  the  innate, 
intense  love  for  His  Essence  is  satisﬁed.  And  by  perceiving  through  the 
insight  of  belief  the  Eternally  Enduring  One’s  eternal  existence,  the  per-
fections of the universe and of humankind are known and exist, and one’s 
natural infatuation with perfection is saved from endless pains and becomes 
the means to pleasure and enjoyment.

Also,  through  the  insight  of  belief  a  connection  is  formed  with  the 
Eternally  Enduring  One,  and  through  belief  in  that  connection  a  relation 
comes into being with all His dominions. And due to that connection and 

72

THE RAYS

relation  – with the eye of belief –  one looks on inﬁnite dominions as though 
they were in a way one’s own possessions, and beneﬁts from them.

Also,  through  the  insight  of  belief  and  that  connection  and  relation,  a 
bond  is  formed  with  all  beings,  a  sort  of  union  is  attained  with  them.  In 
this way, apart from one’s personal existence in second place, through the 
insight of belief and that connection, relation, bond and union, a boundless 
existence comes into being which is as though one’s own; and one’s innate 
passionate love of existence is quietened.

Also,  through  that  insight  of  belief,  and  the  connection,  relation,  and 
bond, a brotherhood is formed with all the people of perfection. Thus, by 
knowing  that  due  to  the  eternal  existence  of  the  Eternally  Enduring  One 
those innumerable people of perfection have not gone to nothingness and 
are not lost, the immortality and continued existence of those innumerable 
friends’ perfections, whom such a person with the insight of belief loves, 
admires,  and  appreciates  and  to  whom  he  is  attached,  yields  an  elevated 
pleasure for him.

Also, through that insight of belief, connection, relation, bond, and broth-
erhood, I felt and experienced in myself an inﬁnite happiness at the happi-
ness of all my friends  – for whose happiness I would willingly sacriﬁce my 
life and immortality. For one kind friend is happy and pleased at the happi-
ness of his sincere friend. I therefore felt and perceived through the insight 
of  belief  that  due  to  the  eternal  existence  of  the  Enduring  One  of  Perfec-
tion, foremost the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 
and his Family and Companions, and all my masters and those I love, the 
prophets, saints, and puriﬁed scholars, and all my other innumerable friends, 
had been saved from eternal extinction and would experience eternal hap-
piness. I understood through the mystery of relations, bonds, brotherhood, 
and friendship that their happiness was reﬂected in me and made me happy.
Also, through the insight of belief, I was saved from endless sorrows 
arising from love of my fellow men and love for relatives, and felt a bound-
less spiritual pleasure. For I felt and perceived through the insight of belief 
that foremost my parents and all my blood relatives and relatives of the 
spirit, for whom by nature I desired to sacriﬁce my life and immortality, 
and would proudly do so, were saved through the eternal existence of the 
Truly  Enduring  One  from  annihilation,  non-existence,  eternal  annihila-
tion, and endless pains, and would receive His inﬁnite mercy. I felt and 
perceived  that  an  inﬁnite  mercy  was  protecting  and  supervising  them  in 
place of my insigniﬁcant, ineffective compassion, which produces sorrow 

THE FOURTH RAY

and pain. Like a mother takes pleasure at the ease, comfort, and enjoyment 
of her child, I felt pleasure and joy at the salvation and ease of all those 
persons for whom I had compassion under the protection of that mercy, 
and I offered profound thanks.

Also, through the insight of belief, and through its connection, I knew 
and  felt  that  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  which  was  the  result  of  my  life,  means  of 
my happiness, and my natural duty, was saved from being lost and without 
beneﬁt and from annihilation and losing its meaning, and that it was fruit-
ful  and  enduring;  I  had  the  conviction  that  this  was  so  and  I  experienced 
a pleasure of the spirit far exceeding the pleasure at my own immortality. 
For I believed that through the Enduring One of Perfection’s eternal exist-
ence, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  was not only inscribed in the hearts and memories of 
people, but was studied by innumerable sentient creatures and spirit beings, 
and in addition, receiving Allah’s pleasure, was inscribed on the Preserved 
Tablet, and guarded records, and adorned with fruits of reward. I knew that 
in particular its being connected with the Qur’an, and its acceptance by the 
Prophet ( UWBP ), and  – Allah willing –  being the object of divine pleasure, 
one  moment  of  its  existence  and  being  under  the  dominical  view  was  far 
more valuable than the appreciation of all the people of this world.

Thus, I realized that I am ever-ready to sacriﬁce my life and immortal-
ity for the immortality, continuance, statement, and acceptance of each of 
those treatises, which prove the truths of belief, and that my happiness lies 
in their serving the Qur’an. In this way I understood through the connection 
of belief that through divine immortality, they are the object of appreciation 
a hundred times greater than the appreciation of others. I exclaimed with all 
my strength: Ø × Ö Õ

Also, through the insight of belief I knew that belief in the eternal exist-
ence of the Enduring One of Glory, Who bestows everlasting immortality 
and perpetual life, and such results of belief as good works, are the everlast-
ing fruits of this ﬂeeting life and the means to unending immortality. I per-
suaded my soul to leave aside the shell of this worldly immortality in order 
to yield those enduring fruits, like a seed leaves aside its casing in order to 
be transformed into a fruit-bearing tree. Together with my soul I declared: 
Ø × Ö Õ For us His eternal existence is sufﬁcient! 

Also, through the insight of belief and relation of worship I knew with 
‘the knowledge of certainty’ that what lies beyond the screen of the earth 
was lit up and that the heavy layer of earth was lifted from the dead, and 

74

THE RAYS

that  under  the  ground,  which  was  entered  by  the  door  of  the  grave,  was 
not dark and stained with non-existence. With all my strength I exclaimed: 

Ø × Ö Õ

I perceived incontestably and with the insight of belief knew with  abso-
lute  certainty  that  while  the  intense  desire  for  immortality  in  my  natural 
disposition  looked  in  two  respects  to  the  eternal  existence  of  the  Endur-
ing  One  of  Perfection,  I  saw  due  to  the  unveiling  of  egotism  that  I  had 
become stunned and bewildered as one who has lost his beloved and had 
begun  to  worship  the  mirror  itself.  That  very  deep,  powerful  desire  for 
immortality governed in my essential being through the shadow of one of 
the  names  of  the  Absolute  Perfection,  Who  is  loved  and  worshipped  for 
Himself and for no other reason, and Whom it is in human nature to love. 
He  had  given  the  desire  for  immortality,  and  while  the  perfection  of  His 
Essence,  which  apart  from  Himself  requires  no  other  reason  or  motive 
for  love,  was  sufﬁcient  as  the  cause  of  worship,  as  we  explained  above, 
by bestowing the above-mentioned enduring fruits – each one of which is 
worthy of having sacriﬁced for it not one life and immortality, but if pos-
sible  thousands  of  worldly  lives  and  immortalities  –  He  had  made  that 
innate  desire  even  more  intense;  this  I  perceived  and  felt.  If  it  had  been 
within my power I would have declared with all the particles of my being: 
Ø × Ö Õ, and I did declare it with that intention.

Also,  the  insight  of  belief,  which  seeks  its  immortality  and  the  eternal 
existence of Allah  –  some of the fruits of which I have indicated above in the 
paragraphs starting “ Also... Also... Also...  ”  –  afforded me such pleasure 
and joy that I exclaimed with all my spirit, all my strength, from the depths 
of my heart, together with my soul: Ø × Ö Õ

One time when afﬂicted with old age, exile, loneliness, and isolation in 
addition  to  my  innate  and  inﬁnite  impotence,  the  worldly  were  attacking 
me with their spies and stratagems, and I declared: “ Armies are attacking 
a single sick, weak man whose hands are tied. Is there nothing that unfor-
tunate ( that is, me ) can ﬁnd to support him? ” I had recourse to the verse 
Ø × Ö Õ It told me: through the relation resulting from belief 
you may rely on a monarch so absolutely powerful that together with every 
spring equipping in perfect order all the armies of the plants and animals

on  the  face  of  the  earth,  which  comprise  four  hundred  thousand  nations, 
he  renews  the  uniforms  of  the  two  regular  armies  of  the  trees  and  ﬂying 
creatures, clothing them in fresh apparel and changing the skirts and top gar-
ments of the hens and birds. He changes too the dress of the mountains and 
the veil of the plains.

Furthermore, this Monarch places all the rations of the vast army of fore-
most human beings and all the animals in the merciful extracts known as 
seeds and grains, which are far more wondrous than the food extracts like 
the  meat,  sugar  and  other  extracts  the  civilized  have  discovered  in  recent 
times. He rolls up inside these the instructions for their cooking and growth 
in accordance with divine determining, depositing them in minute casings 
for their protection. The creation of these containers is with such speed, ease 
and abundance from the factory of 
 ( 36:82 ) ² ±  that the Qur’an says it 
is carried out at a mere command. Although all those extracts resemble each 
other and are of the same matter and would not ﬁll a town, the Muniﬁcent 
Provider could ﬁll all the towns on the earth with the exceedingly various 
and delicious foods He cooks from them in the summer.

Thus, you may ﬁnd a point of support such as this through the relation of 

belief, and rely on an inﬁnite power and strength.

On receiving this lesson from the verse, I acquired such moral strength 
and ﬁrmness of belief that I could have challenged not only my present ene-
mies, but the whole world. I declared: Ø × Ö Õ

Seeking  a  source  of  help  for  my  inﬁnite  poverty  and  need,  I  again 
had  recourse  to  the  verse.  It  said  to  me:  through  the  relation  of  worship 
and servanthood you become connected to and are recorded in the wages 
book  of  a  Muniﬁcent  Master  Who  every  spring  and  summer  sets  out  and 
removes a hundred times over tables bearing a multiplicity of foods, pro-
ducing them out of nothing from unexpected places and the dry earth. It is 
as though the years and the days are all receptacles for the fruits of bounty 
and foods of mercy that appear in unending succession. They are exhibitions 
for  the  degrees  of  bestowal,  universal  and  particular,  of  a  Compassionate 
Provider.  You  are  the  servant  of  a  Possessor  of  Absolute  Riches  Who  is 
thus. If you are aware of your servanthood, your grievous poverty will be 
transformed into pleasurable appetite. This lesson I absorbed, and placing 
my trust in Allah declared together with my soul: “ Yes, yes! That is right!

The Third Degree of the Luminous Verse “ F o r   u s   A l l a h   s u f ﬁ c e s   ” 

At a time I found my attachment to the world broken due to the pres-
sures of my exile and sickness, and the wrongs I suffered, and belief was 
informing me that I was destined for an eternal world, an everlasting land, 
and perpetual happiness, I gave up sighing “ ah! ah! ” and said “ oh! oh! ” 
But this goal of the imagination, aim of the spirit, and result of creation 
could  only  be  achieved  through  the  inﬁnite  power  of  One  Absolutely 
Omnipotent Who knows the motion, rest, acts and states of all creatures, 
and records them, and takes insigniﬁcant and absolutely impotent human 
beings  as  His  friends  and  addressees,  giving  them  a  rank  over  all  crea-
tures. Thinking of this and His attaching inﬁnite importance to them and 
bestowing  inﬁnite  grace  on  them,  that  is,  pondering  over  the  activity  of 
such a power and the importance of human beings despite their apparent 
insigniﬁcance, I wanted an explanation that would increase my belief and 
satisfy  my  mind.  I  again  had  recourse  to  the  verse.  It  commanded  me: 
“ Note carefully the ‘us’ of Õ and see who is saying this together with 
you verbally and through the tongue of disposition. ”

So I looked and I at once saw that innumerable birds and miniature birds 
and ﬂying creatures, and countless animals and small living creatures, and 
uncountable  plants  and  growing  things,  and  inﬁnite  numbers  of  trees  and 
bushes, like me, were reciting through the tongue of disposition the meaning 
of Ø × Ö Õ and were calling it to mind. For the One Who 
has  disposal  over  them  and  guarantees  all  the  necessities  of  their  lives  is 
such that He creates before our eyes and particularly in the spring in great 
abundance and with great ease and speed and extensiveness, without error, 
defect,  or  confusion,  from  eggs,  droplets  of ﬂuid,  seeds  and  grains  which 
resemble each other and whose matter is the same, the adorned, balanced, 
and regular hundred thousand species of birds, the hundred thousand sorts 
of animals, the hundred thousand varieties of plants, and the hundred thou-
sand kinds of trees, which, all with their distinguishing characteristics, are 
different to each other. With all this intermingling, resemblance, and close-
ness, He demonstrates to us His unity and oneness within the immensity and 
majesty of His power. I understood then that it was impossible for there to 
be any interference or partnership in that act of dominicality and disposal of 
creative power, which displayed such innumerable miracles.

I noted next the ‘I’ in the Õ that is, I considered myself, and I saw 
that among the animals, He had created me miraculously from my origin,

a drop of ﬂuid, had opened my ear, attached my eye, and had placed in my 
head a brain, and in my breast a heart, and in my mouth a tongue containing 
hundreds of scales and measures with which I might weigh up and know all 
the gifts of that Most Merciful One stored up in the treasuries of mercy. He 
had inscribed on these, thousands of instruments for unlocking and under-
standing  the  treasures  of  the  inﬁnite  manifestations  of  His  most  beautiful 
names, and given instructions to the number of smells, tastes, and colours 
for the assistance of those instruments.

He had moreover included with perfect order in this body the numerous 
sensitive  feelings  and  senses,  and  subtle,  non-physical  faculties  and  inner 
senses.  He  had  created  with  perfect  art  all  the  systems  and  members  and 
faculties necessary for human life so that He might allow me to experience 
and  understand  all  the  varieties  of  His  bounties,  and  make  known  to  me 
the countless different manifestations of His names. Like the bodies of all 
believers,  He  had  made  this  poor  body  of  mine,  which  appears  so  insig-
niﬁcant, a ﬁne calendar and diary of the universe; an illuminated summary 
of the macrocosm; a miniature sample of the world; a clear miracle of His 
handicraft; a desirous seeker after every sort of His bounty, and the means 
of enjoying them; and a list and index, like a model garden, of the gifts and 
ﬂowers of mercy; and the understanding recipient of His divine pronounce-
ments. He also had given me life, to expand and increase in my existence, 
which is the greatest bounty. For through life, the bounty of my existence 
may expand to the extent of the Manifest World.

He  had  also  bestowed  humanity  on  me,  through  which  the  bounty  of 
existence may unfold in the physical and spiritual realms, opening up the 
way  to  beneﬁting   – through  the  senses  particular  to  human  beings –   from 
those broad spreads of bounties.

He had also bestowed Islam on me, through which the bounty of exist-
ence  may  expand  to  the  extent  of  the  Manifest  World  and  World  of  the 
Unseen.

He  had  also  given  me  certain,  realized  belief,  by  virtue  of  which  the 

bounty of existence may encompass this world and the hereafter.

He  had  also  given  me  the  knowledge  and  love  of  Allah  within  belief. 
Through this He bestowed a rank through the bounty of existence at which 
one may stretch out the hands to reap beneﬁts, through praise and laudation, 
at all the levels from the sphere of contingency to the Necessary World and 
realm of the divine names.

78

THE RAYS

He had also given me in particular knowledge of the Qur’an and the wis-
dom of belief, through which bounty He had bestowed on me a superiority 
over many creatures.

He  had  also  given  me  comprehensive  abilities  like  the  above-men-
tioned  whereby  I  might  be  a  complete  mirror  to  His  oneness  and  Eter-
nal Besoughtedness, and respond with universal worship to His universal, 
sacred dominicality.

And  as  unanimously  conﬁrmed  by  all  the  holy  scriptures  and  books 
He had revealed to human beings by means of the prophets, and attested 
by all the prophets, saints, and puriﬁed ones, He buys from me my exist-
ence,  life,  and  self   – as  stated  by  verses  of  the  Qur’an –   which  are  gifts 
and in trust to me, so that they will not be lost and go for nothing. He has 
repeatedly and categorically promised that He will preserve them in order 
to  return  them,  and  that  as  the  price  He  will  give  eternal  happiness  and 
Paradise. This I understood with the knowledge of certainty and believed 
with utter conviction.

Thus,  I  was  taught  by  the  verse Ø × Ö Õ that  my  Sus-
tainer,  the  Glorious  and  Muniﬁcent  One,  opens  up  through  His  name  of 
Opener the forms of the hundreds of thousands of varieties of animals and 
plants  from  limited,  similar  droplets  and  seeds,  with  the  uttermost  ease, 
speed, and perfection, and as we mentioned before, gives human beings this 
astonishing  importance,  making  them  the  chief  pivot  of  the  works  of  His 
dominicality; so too He will create the resurrection of the dead and Paradise 
and will bestow eternal happiness as easily and deﬁnitely as He will create 
next  spring.  Had  it  had  been  possible,  I  would  have  declared  through  the 
tongues of all creatures, but since it was not possible, I declared by inten-
tion and through thought and imagination: Ø × Ö Õ And so 
I want to repeat it through all eternity.

The Fourth Degree of the Luminous Verse “ F o r   u s   A l l a h   s u f ﬁ c e s   ”

One time, when a period of heedlessness coincided with my being shaken 
by various indispositions like old age, exile, illness, and defeat, I was over-
come by a grievous anxiety that my very existence, to which I was intensely 
attached  and  by  which  I  was  captivated,  would  cease  to  be,  as  would  the 
existences of all creatures. Again I had recourse to the verse Õ  . It told 
me: “ Study my meaning and look through the telescope of belief! ”

THE FOURTH RAY

79

I looked and I saw through the eyes of belief that my miniscule being was 
the mirror to an inﬁnite existence, and through an inﬁnite expansion was the 
means of gaining innumerable existences; it was a word of wisdom yielding 
the fruits of numerous everlasting existences far surpassing itself in value. I 
understood with the knowledge of certainty that due to its relation with that 
inﬁnite existence, to live for an instant was as valuable as existing eternally. 
For by understanding through the insight of belief that my being is the work, 
artefact and manifestation of the Necessarily Existent, I was saved from the 
endless darkness of desolate fears and the pains of innumerable separations. 
I knew that within a temporary separation was a permanent union with the 
beings I loved, with which, through bonds of brotherhood to the number of 
divine names manifested in the acts related to living creatures in particular, 
I had gained a relation.

It  is  clear  that  those  who  share  the  same  village,  town  or  country,  or 
the same regiment, commander, or master will feel a close brotherhood and 
warm friendship, while those deprived of such bonds feel a constant pain-
ful  torment  surrounded  by  darkness.  The  fruits  of  a  tree,  too,  if  they  had 
intelligence, would feel that they were brothers, companions, and observers 
of each other. If the tree ceased to exist or they were plucked from it, they 
would experience separations to the number of fruits.

Thus,  through  belief  and  the  relation  that  results  from  it,  my  exist-
ence   – like  that  of  all  believers –   gains  the  lights  of  myriad  existences 
untouched  by  separation.  Even  if  it  departs  itself,  it  is  content,  for  they 
remain behind as though it had itself remained. Moreover, as is demon-
strated in detail in the Twenty-Fourth Letter, the existences of all living 
creatures and particularly those with spirits, are like words. They are spo-
ken and written down, then disappear. But in place of their own existences, 
they leave behind numerous existences which may be counted as second 
degree existences, such as their meanings, their similitudes and forms, and 
their results, and if they are blessed, their rewards and their realities. Only 
then do they pass beneath the veil.

In just the same way, when they depart from external existence, my exist-
ence and the existences of all living creatures, leave behind them their spirits, 
if they possess them, and their meanings, and realities, and similitudes, and 
the worldly results and fruits of the hereafter produced by them individually; 
they leave their forms and their identities behind in memories and on the 
Preserved Tablet, and in the ﬁlms displaying eternal vistas, and in the exhi-
bitions of pre- eternal knowledge; and they leave the divine gloriﬁcations 

80

THE RAYS

offered by their essential beings, which represent them and give them per-
manence, in the notebooks of their deeds; and their innate responses to the 
manifestations of the divine names and what the names necessitate, and their 
being existent mirrors to them, they leave in the sphere of the names. They 
leave  behind  in  their  places  numerous  non-physical  existences  like  these, 
more valuable than their external existences, then they depart. This I knew 
with the knowledge of certainty.

Thus,  through  belief  and  the  insight  and  relationship  resulting  from 
belief,  one  may  lay  claim  to  the  above-mentioned  everlasting,  immaterial 
existences. In the absence of belief, besides being deprived of all those other 
existences, even one’s own existence goes for nothing, for oneself, and is 
lost in non-existence.

At one time, I felt great sorrow at the speedy destruction of the spring 
ﬂowers;  I  even  pitied  those  delicate  creatures.  But  the  above-mentioned 
truth arising from belief shows that such ﬂowers are seeds in the world of 
meaning. Each like a fruit-producing tree or a shoot,  – in respect of the lights 
of existence –  all those existences apart from spirit, as explained above, pro-
duce  a hundredfold proﬁt. Their external existences do not go to non- exist-
ence, they are hidden. They are also the new forms of the permanent reality 
of a species. For the beings of last spring such as the leaves, ﬂowers, and 
fruits are the same as those of this spring; the difference is only apparent. 
I realized that the apparent difference, even, was to allow those words of 
wisdom, phrases of mercy, and letters of power to acquire numerous differ-
ent meanings. Instead of lamenting, I exclaimed: “ What wonders Allah has 
willed! How great are His blessings! ”

Thus, through the insight of belief and by being connected through belief 
to the Maker of the heavens and earth, I perceived from afar what a source 
of pride and honour it is to be the work of art of a craftsman who adorns the 
skies with stars and the earth with ﬂowers and exquisite creatures, and dem-
onstrates a hundred miracles in every one of his artefacts – how precious and 
unique it was to have been made by such a wondrous artist. The verse taught 
me in particular that since that wonder-working Artist had inscribed in the 
tiny copy of man the mighty book of the vast heavens and earth, even mak-
ing him a choice and perfect summary of the book, what a great honour and 
achievement and way of acquiring value it was for man, and that through the 
relation and insight of belief, he could receive and lay claim to that honour. 
Conceiving of all beings in my mind, I formed the intention and declared 
through the tongues of all of them: Ø × Ö Õ

The Fifth Degree of the Luminous Verse “ F o r   u s   A l l a h   s u f ﬁ c e s   ” 

Another  time  when  my  life  was  being  shaken  by  severe  conditions,  it 
turned my attention towards life and I saw that mine was swiftly passing. 
I was approaching the end of my life; it had begun to be dimmed with the 
oppression  I  suffered.  But  I  thought  sorrowfully  of  how,  because  of  its 
important  duties  and  virtues  and  valuable  beneﬁts,  which  are  explained 
in the treatise on the divine name of Ever-Living, life deserved to be very 
lengthy, not to be swiftly extinguished in that way. I once again had recourse 
to my master, the verse Ø × Ö Õ and it told me: “ Consider 
life from the point of view of the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One, Who 
gives you life! ” So I considered it and I understood that if one aspect of life 
looks to me, one hundred aspects look to the Ever-Living Granter of Life. If 
one of its results concern me, a thousand of its results pertain to my Creator. 
In that respect it did not require great length, in fact it needed no time at all; 
to live for an instant was sufﬁcient. This truth is elucidated together with 
proofs in various parts of the R i s a l e - i  N u r , so here it will be explained in four 
matters, in brief and summary form.

First Matter

F i r s t   M a t t e r :  I looked in the manner the essence and reality of life look 
to the Ever- Living and Self-Subsistent One, and I saw that in reality my 
life was a collection of keys with which to open the treasuries of the divine 
names, and a small map of their inscriptions, an index of their manifesta-
tions, a sensitive balance and measure of the vast truths of the universe, and 
a word of wisdom written to know and make known, and to understand and 
make understood, the meaningful names of the Ever-Living and Self-Sub-
sistent One. When life’s reality is this, its value increases a thousandfold and 
one hour of life gains the signiﬁcance of a lifetime. In respect of its relation 
to the Pre-Eternal One, Who has no time, life may not be considered with 
regard to its length or brevity.

Second Matter

S e c o n d   M a t t e r :  I considered the true rights of life, and I understood that 
my life is a dominical missive; it invites my brothers, other intelligent crea-
tures,  to  read  itself;  it  is  a  place  of  study  making  known  its  Creator.  It  is 
also a manifesto proclaiming my Creator’s perfections. Knowingly adorning 
itself  in  the  priceless  gifts  and  decorations  bestowed  on  it  by  life’s  Crea-
tor, it displays them consciously, gratefully, and believingly to the Peerless 
Monarch in the daily parade. It comprehends, observes, and proclaims the 
thankful benedictions and gloriﬁcations of the Creator of innumerable living 
beings. And it makes known verbally and through the tongues of disposi-
tion and worship, the beauties of the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One’s 

82

THE RAYS

dominicality. I understood with the knowledge of certainty that the elevated 
rights of life like these did not require lengthy time, and that they elevate 
life a thousandfold and are a hundred times more valuable than the worldly 
rights of life. I exclaimed: “ Glory be to Allah! Belief is so valuable and liv-
ing, it infuses with life everything it enters! It transforms the ﬂeeting glim-
mer of transitory life into eternal life, dispelling the transience in it.”

Third Matter

T h i r d   M a t t e r :  I considered the innate duties of my life and its non-mate-
rial beneﬁts which look to my Creator, and I saw that it acts as a mirror to 
the Creator of life in three ways:

The First Way

T h e   F i r s t   W a y :  Through its impotence, weakness, poverty, and need, my 
life acts as a mirror to the power, strength, wealth, and mercy of the Creator 
of life. Yes, just as the pleasure of food is known in proportion to the degree 
of hunger, and the degrees of light through the degrees of darkness, and the 
degrees of heat through the degrees of cold; in the same way, through the 
boundless impotence and poverty in my life, I understood the inﬁnite power 
and mercy of my Creator, Who answers my needs and wards off my innu-
merable enemies. I understood my duties of entreaty, supplication, worship, 
abasement, and seeking refuge with Allah, and I undertook these duties.

The Second Way

The Second Way is acting as a mirror to the universal and comprehen-
sive attributes and acts of my Creator through such meanings in my own life 
as partial knowledge, will, hearing and sight. Yes, I understood through the 
many meanings in my own life and my conscious acts like knowing, hear-
ing,  seeing,  speaking,  and  wanting  – like  my  size  relative  to  the  universe 
but in far greater degree –  my Creator’s all-encompassing attributes such as 
knowledge, will, hearing, sight, power, and life, and His qualities such as 
love, anger and compassion. Believing, I assented to them, and admitting 
this, I found another way leading to knowledge of Allah.

The Third Way

The Third Way is acting as a mirror to the divine names, inscriptions 
and manifestations of which are present in my life. Yes, as I beheld my own 
life and body, I saw hundreds of sorts of miraculous works, inscriptions, and 
arts,  and  observed  moreover  that  I  was  being  most  compassionately  nur-
tured. I understood therefore through the light of belief, how extraordinarily 
generous, merciful, skilful and gracious was the One Who created me and 
gave me life; how wondrously powerful and, if one may say so, ingenious, 
provident, and efﬁcient. I understood too what the innate duties and aims of 
creation and results of life consisted of, such as gloriﬁcation, sanctiﬁcation, 
praise, thanks, exaltation, afﬁrming Allah’s unity, and declaring His great-
ness and His praises. And I understood with the knowledge of certainty the 

THE FOURTH RAY

83

reason life is the most valuable creature in the universe and why everything 
is subjugated to it, and the wisdom in everyone having an innate passion for 
life; I understood that belief is the very life of life.

Fourth Matter

F o u r t h   M a t t e r   :  In order to learn what the true pleasure and happiness of 

life consist of in this world, I again pondered over the verse 
Ø × Ö Õ I saw that the purest pleasure and most untarnished 
happiness in this life of mine lay in belief. That is to say, my certain belief 
that I was the creature, artefact, and totally owned slave of a Compassionate 
Sustainer Who created me and gave me life, and was in His view and was 
being nurtured by him, that I was all the time in need of Him, and that He 
was both my Sustainer and my Allah and was most kind and compassionate 
to me, was such a perfect, permanent, painfree pleasure and happiness that 
it is indescribable. I understood from the verse just how appropriate is the 
saying: “ All praise be to Allah for the bounty of belief! ”

Thus, these four matters, that is, the reality, rights, duties, and pleasure 
of life, show that the more life looks to the Eternally Ever-Living and Self-
Subsistent One and the more belief becomes the life and spirit of life, the 
more enduring it becomes and the more enduring fruits it produces. Moreo-
ver, it becomes so elevated, it receives the manifestation of eternity; it no 
longer looks to the length and brevity of life. This I learnt from the verse. 
And in the name of all lives and living beings, and with that intention and 
idea, I declared: Ø × Ö Õ
The Sixth Degree of the Luminous Verse “ F o r   u s   A l l a h   s u f ﬁ c e s   ” 

At  a  time  my  old  age  was  warning  me  of  my  own  departure  amid  the 
events of the end of time, which in turn give warning of the end of the world 
and departure of all beings, my innate passionate love of beauty and fasci-
nation by perfection developed to an extraordinary degree, and I observed 
with  extreme  clarity  and  sorrow  that  death,  transience,  and  non-existence 
were  continuously  causing  the  destruction  of  beings  and  their  separation, 
and were pounding this beautiful world and its creatures, breaking them up 
and spoiling their beauty. Seeking consolation as that metaphorical love in 
my nature rebelled violently against this situation, I again had recourse to 
the verse. It told me: “ Recite me, and study my meaning carefully! ”

So I entered the observatory of the Light Verse in Sura al-Nur and trained 
the  telescope  of  belief  on  the  farthermost  levels  of  the  verse Õ  and 
turned the microscope of the insight of belief at its most obscure mysteries. 

84

THE RAYS

I saw that just as mirrors, shining objects, fragments of glass, and even bub-
bles, reveal the various sorts of concealed beauty in the sunlight; and with 
their different capacities and their change and renewal, renew its beauties; 
and by reﬂecting and refracting the light, make known the hidden beauties 
of the sun and the seven colours in its light; so, without cease, in order to act 
as mirrors to the sacred beauty of the All- Beauteous One of Glory, the Sun 
of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, and to the everlasting beauties of His inﬁ-
nitely lovely most beautiful names, and to renew their manifestation, these 
ﬁne  creatures,  these  lovely  beings,  these  exquisite  artefacts,  come,  then 
depart. As is explained in detail in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  supported by powerful 
proofs, all the shades of beauty that are to be observed on them are not theirs, 
but are the hints, signs, ﬂashes, and manifestations of an eternal, sacred and 
transcendent beauty which desires to be perpetually manifested and visible. 
Here, three of those proofs shall be alluded to brieﬂy.

The First Proof

First Proof: The beauty of a ﬁnely worked object points to the beauty 
of the craftsmanship. The beauty of the craftsmanship points to the beauty 
of  the  name  that  was  the  source  of  the  craftsmanship.  The  beauty  of  the 
name of the craftsman’s art points to the beauty of the craftsman’s attributes 
manifested in that art. The beauty of his attributes points to the beauty of his 
talent and abilities. And the beauty of his abilities points self-evidently to the 
beauty of his essential self and his reality.

In exactly the same way, the beauty in all the ﬁne creatures which ﬁll the 
universe, all exquisitely made, testiﬁes decisively to the beauty of the acts 
of the All-Glorious Craftsman. And the beauty of the acts points indubitably 
to the beauty of the titles, that is, names, that look to those acts. And the 
beauty of the names testiﬁes certainly to the beauty of the sacred attributes 
that are the source of the names. And the beauty of the attributes testiﬁes 
to  the  beauty  of  the essential  qualities  and  abilities  that  are  the  source  of 
the attributes. And the beauty of the essential qualities and abilities testiﬁes 
self-evidently to the beauty and sacred perfection of the Essence which is 
the source of the acts and is qualiﬁed by the names and attributes, and to the 
holy beauty of His reality.

That is to say, the All-Beauteous Maker possesses an inﬁnite beauty and 
loveliness that are ﬁtting for His Most Sacred Essence, one shadow of which 
has beautiﬁed all beings from top to bottom; He possesses a transcendent, 
sacred beauty a single manifestation of which has endowed with beauty the 
whole universe and has adorned and illuminated with its ﬂashes the entire 
sphere of contingency.

Yes, just as a crafted work cannot have come into existence without an 
act, so an act cannot occur without the performer of the act. And just as it is 
impossible for there to be names without the one they signify, so attributes 
cannot be without the one they qualify. Since the existence of a work of art 
self-evidently points to the act which crafted it, and the existence of the act 
points to the existence of the worker of the act and his title, and to the exist-
ence of the attribute and name which gave rise to the work; the perfection 
and beauty of the work of art point also to the beauty and perfection par-
ticular to the act which crafted it, and they point to the beauty particular to 
and ﬁtting for the name of the performer of the act, and, with knowledge of 
certainty, to the beauty and perfection of his essence and reality, which are 
ﬁtting for and appropriate to them.

In just the same way, since it is impossible for the constant activity under 
the veil of the works of art in the universe to occur without the causer of the 
activity, and the names whose manifestations and inscriptions are visible on 
creatures to exist without the one they signify, and such attributes as power 
and will which are almost visible to exist without the one they qualify; with 
their limitless existences, all the works of art, creatures and artefacts in the 
universe point decisively to the existence of their Creator, Maker, and Doer, 
and to the existence of His names, and to the existence of His attributes, and 
to the existence of His essential qualities, and to the necessary existence of 
His Most Pure and Holy Essence.

The Second Proof

Similarly, all the different varieties of beauty, perfection, and loveliness 
to be seen in creatures testify with complete clarity  – but in a way particular 
to and ﬁtting for their sacredness and necessity –  to the inﬁnite, unlimited, 
multifarious beauties and perfections of the acts, names, attributes, qualities, 
and Essence of the All-Glorious Maker; they point most decisively to their 
beauties, which far surpass those of all beings.
The Second Proof contains ﬁve points:
F i r s t   P o i n t :  Relying on their illuminations and unveilings, the chiefs of 
the  people  of  reality  have  believed  and  stated  unanimously  – despite  their 
paths  and  methods  differing  greatly  from  one  another –  that  the  instances 
of beauty in all beings are the shadows, ﬂashes and manifestations of the 
sacred, hidden beauty of the Necessarily Existent One.

Second Point:

First Point:

S e c o n d   P o i n t :  All beautiful creatures appear caravan after caravan, and 
not stopping, disappear; they come one after the other in succession, then 
depart.  Yet  an  elevated  and unchanging  beauty  displays  itself  in  the  mir-
rors of those creatures, demonstrating certainly through the continuity of its 

86

THE RAYS

manifestation that the beauty does not belong to the beautiful creatures, to 
those mirrors. Rather, like the beauty of the sun’s rays is to be seen on the 
bubbles ﬂoating on the surface of running water, they are the lights of an 
eternal beauty.

Third Point:

T h i r d   P o i n t :  It  is  clear  that  just  as  light  comes  from  something  lumi-
nous, the giving of existence from something existent, bounty from riches, 
muniﬁcence  from  wealth,  and  instruction  from  knowledge,  so  the  giving 
of excellence is from the excellent and the bestowal of beauty is from the 
beautiful; it could not be in any other way. It is in consequence of this truth 
that we believe that all the beauty in the universe comes from the beauty of 
the  Beauteous  One  Whom  the  constantly  changing  and  renewed  universe 
describes and deﬁnes through all its creatures and the tongues of their mir-
ror-like beings.

Fourth Point:

F o u r t h   P o i n t :  Just as the body relies on the spirit and subsists through 
it and is animated by it, and a word looks to the meaning and is illuminated 
by it, and form rests on reality and acquires value through it; so this corpo-
real and material manifest world is a body, a word, a form which relies on 
the divine names behind the veil of the Unseen, receiving life and vitality 
from them; it looks to them, and is beautiﬁed. All the instances of physical 
beauty proceed from the non-physical beauties of their own realities and 
meanings; and as for their realities, they receive effulgence from the divine 
names and are shadows of them of a sort. This truth is proved decisively 
in the R i s a l e - i   N u r .

This means that all the varieties and sorts of beauty in the universe are the 
signs, marks, and manifestations  – by means of names –  of a faultless, tran-
scendent Beauty which is manifested from beyond the veil of the Unseen. 
However,  since  the  Necessary  Existent’s  Most  Pure  and  Holy  Essence 
resembles absolutely nothing at all and His attributes are inﬁnitely superior 
to the attributes of contingent beings, His sacred beauty also does not resem-
ble the beauties of creatures and contingent beings, and is inﬁnitely more 
exalted. Certainly, an everlasting beauty one manifestation of which is vast 
Paradise together with all its exquisiteness and beauty, and one hour’s vision 
of which makes the inhabitants of Paradise oblivious to it cannot be ﬁnite, 
nor have any like, equal or peer.

It is clear that the beauties of a thing are in accordance with the thing 
itself; and there are thousands of sorts of beauties which all differ according 
to the different sorts of beings. For example, beauty perceived by the eye 
is not the same as something beautiful heard with the ears, and an abstract 

THE FOURTH RAY

87

beauty  comprehended  by  the  mind  is  not  the  same  as  the  beauty  of  food 
relished  by  the  tongue;  so  too,  the  beauties  appreciated  and  perceived  as 
beautiful by the external and inner senses and the spirit are all different. For 
example, the beauty of belief, the beauty of reality, the beauty of light, the 
beauty of a ﬂower, the beauty of spirit, and the beauties of form, compas-
sion, justice, kindness, and wisdom. Similarly, since the utter and inﬁnite 
beauties of the most beautiful names of the All-Beauteous One of Glory are 
all different, the beauties in beings also differ.

If you want to observe one manifestation of the beauties of the All-Beau-
teous One’s names in the mirrors of beings, take a sweeping look with the 
eye of the imagination at the face of the earth supposing it to be a small gar-
den; you will see that terms like mercifulness, compassionateness, wisdom, 
and justice allude to both the names, and acts, and attributes, and qualities 
of Almighty Allah.

Observe the sustenance of foremost human beings and of all living crea-
tures, which arrives regularly from behind the veil of the Unseen, and see the 
beauty of divine mercifulness.

Then consider the miraculous sustenance of all young, and the two pumps 
of milk hanging over their heads on the breasts of their mothers, as sweet 
and pure as the water of Kawthar, and see the captivating beauty of divine 
compassion.

Then  observe  the  peerless  beauty  of  divine  wisdom,  which  makes  the 
whole  universe  into  a  mighty  book  of  wisdom  every  letter  of  which  con-
tains a hundred words, and every word of which contains a hundred lines, 
and every line of which contains a thousand chapters, and every chapter of 
which contains hundreds of small books.

Then see the imperious beauty of a justice which holds the whole uni-
verse and all its beings in equilibrium; and maintains the balance of all the 
heavenly  bodies,  lofty  and  lowly;  and  supplies  symmetry  and  proportion, 
the most important elements of beauty; and causes everything to acquire the 
optimum state; and gives the right to life to living beings, and ensures that 
their rights are preserved; and halts and punishes aggressors.

Then consider the inscription of man’s life story in his memory, as tiny 
as a grain of wheat, and the programmes of the second lives of all plants and 
trees in their seeds; and the members and faculties necessary for the defence 
of living beings, for instance bees’ wings and their poisonous stings, and the 
small bayonets of thorned plants, and the hard shells of seeds; and see the 
subtle beauty of dominical preservation and protection.

88

THE RAYS

Then consider the guests at the table of the earth of the Most Merciful and 
Compassionate One, Who is absolutely Muniﬁcent, and the pleasant smells 
of the numberless different foods prepared by mercy, and their beautiful and 
various colours, and their delicious and differing tastes, and the organs and 
members of all living creatures which assist their pleasure and enjoyment; 
and see the exceedingly pleasant, sweet beauty of dominical bestowal and 
muniﬁcence.

Then consider the meaningful forms of foremost human beings and of 
all living creatures, which are opened up from droplets of ﬂuid through the 
manifestation of the names of Opener and Giver of Form, and the attractive 
faces of the ﬂowers of spring opened up from seeds and tiny nuclei; and see 
the miraculous beauty of divine opening and giving of form.

Thus, by analogy with these examples, each of the divine names has a 
sacred beauty particular to it a single manifestation of which makes beauti-
ful the vast world and innumerable species of beings. You may see the mani-
festation of a name’s beauty in a single ﬂower; the spring is also a ﬂower; 
Paradise is a ﬂower yet unseen. If you can visualize the whole of spring and 
see Paradise with the eye of belief, you may understand the utter majesty of 
everlasting Beauty. If you respond to that Beauty with the beauty of belief 
and worship, you will be a most beautiful creature. While if you meet it with 
the boundless ugliness of misguidance and loathsomeness of rebellion, you 
will be both a most ugly creature and will in effect be loathed by all beauti-
ful creatures.

Fifth Point:

F i f t h   P o i n t :  In accordance with the law that all ﬁne arts and crafts and 
accomplishments want to display themselves and have themselves appreci-
ated, a master of hundreds of arts and crafts who possessed endless perfec-
tions and beauties made a wondrous palace in order to describe and reveal all 
his arts, crafts and accomplishments, and his hidden beauties. Anyone see-
ing the miraculous palace would immediately think of the virtues, arts and 
perfections of its master and maker. Believing in them and afﬁrming them 
as though seeing them, he would declare: “ A person who was not beautiful 
and skilled in every way could not be the source, creator and originator of a 
work so beautiful. It is as though his immaterial beauties and perfections are 
embodied in this palace. ”

In  exactly  the  same  way,  so  long  as  his  mind  and  heart  are  not  cor-
rupted,  anyone  who  sees  the  exhibition  of  wonders  and  beauties  of  the 
magniﬁcent palace of this world, that is, the universe, will realize that the 
palace is a mirror, decorated the way it is in order to show the beauties and 

THE FOURTH RAY

89

perfections of another. Yes, since there is nothing similar to the palace of 
the  world  from  which  its  beauties  could  have  been  imitated  and  copied, 
certainly, its Maker possesses the necessary beauties in Himself and in His 
names. It is from these that the universe is derived and according to them 
that it was made. It was written like a book in order to express His beauties 
and names.

The Third Proof

First Point:

The Third Proof consists of three points.
F i r s t   P o i n t :  This is a truth explained in detail with powerful proofs in the 
Third Stopping- Place of the Thirty-Second Word. Referring detailed dis-
cussion of it to that Word, here we shall consider it only with a brief allusion.
We look at creatures, and especially animals and plants, and we see that 
governing them are a constant adorning, which points to intention and will 
and makes known knowledge and wisdom, and an ordering and beautifying 
it is impossible to attribute to chance. There is in everthing an art so delicate, 
a wisdom so ﬁne, an adornment so elevated, an organization so compassion-
ate, and situation so sweet that it is clearly understood that behind the veil of 
the Unseen is a craftsman who wants to make his art appreciated, attract the 
gazes of the attentive, and please his artefacts and observers; who wants to 
make himself known and acquainted and loved through displaying numerous 
skills and perfections in each work of his art, and to make himself praised 
and applauded. He bestows on conscious creatures in order to please them 
and make them happy and friends of himself, every sort of delicious bounty 
from unexpected places in a way it is impossible to attribute to chance.

Also  to  be  observed  are  a  generous  treatment,  a  mutual  acquaintance 
and friendly dialogue with the tongue of disposition, and a compassionate 
response to supplication which make perceived a profound compassion and 
elevated mercy. That is to say, the bestowal of bounty and giving of pleas-
ure which are observed behind the making known and loved, which are as 
clear as the sun, arise from a genuine wish to be compassionate and power-
ful desire to be merciful. And this powerful desire in One Absolutely Self-
Sufﬁcient  Who  has  no  need  of  anything  demonstrates  certainly  an  utterly 
perfect  pre-eternal,  everlasting,  peerless  Beauty  the  nature  and  reality  of 
which necessitate its wanting to be manifested and to see itself in mirrors. 
In order to display and see itself in various mirrors, this Beauty has taken on 
the form of compassion and mercy; then in the mirrors of conscious beings 
has assumed the state of bestowal and muniﬁcence; then has taken the form 
of making itself known and loved; and then bestowed the light of adorning 
creatures and making them beautiful.

Second Point:

90

THE RAYS

S e c o n d   P o i n t :  Humankind’s  genuine,  intense,  and  powerful  love  of 
Allah,  and  especially  that  of  its  elevated  classes  and  of  innumerable  per-
sons whose paths are all different, points self-evidently to a peerless beauty; 
indeed  it  testiﬁes  to  it.  Yes,  such  a  love  looks  only  to  such  a  beauty  and 
necessitates it; such passion demands such loveliness. Indeed, all the praise 
offered by beings verbally and through the tongue of disposition looks to 
that  pre-eternal  Beauty  and  goes  to  it.  In  the  view  of  lovers  like  Shams-
i Tabrizi, all the attraction, captivation, ecstasy, and drawing truths in the 
universe are signs of a pre-eternal and post-eternal truth of attraction. While 
the ecstatic motion and rotations which cause the heavenly bodies and all 
beings to dance and spin like moths and Mevlevi dervishes are the passion-
ate and dutiful responses to the imperious displays of the sacred beauty of 
that captivating truth.

Third Point:

T h i r d   P o i n t :  All  the  scholars  who  have  researched  into  reality  have 
agreed that existence is pure good and light, while non-existence is pure evil 
and darkness. The chiefs of the people of reason and the people of the heart 
have agreed that in the ﬁnal analysis all instances of good, beauty, and pleas-
ure arise from existence, and that all evils and bad, calamities, suffering, and 
even sins are attributable to non-existence.

I f   y o u   s a y :  The source of all beauties is existence, yet also in existence 

are disbelief and the egotism of the soul?

T h e   A n s w e r :  Disbelief is non-existence because it is denial of the truths 
of  belief.  The  existence  of  egotism,  however,  is  a  form  of  non-existence 
which has acquired the colour and form of existence due to a wrongful claim 
to ownership, not knowing the nature of man’s mirror-like being and assum-
ing the imaginary to be actual. Since the source of all beauties is existence 
and the source of all evils is non-existence, a Necessary Existence and Pre- 
Eternal, Everlasting Being, which is the ﬁrmest and most elevated and shin-
ing existence and the one most distant from non-existence, will demand the 
beauty which is the most powerful, and the most elevated and shining and 
free of any blemish; it will rather express such a beauty; indeed, it will be 
such a beauty. Like all-encompassing light is necessitated by the sun, so the 
Necessary Existent necessitates an eternal beauty; he gives light through it.

NOTE:  Nine  degrees  of  the  luminous  verse  “ For  us  Allah  sufﬁces ”

have been postponed.

REMINDER:  Since  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   belongs  to  the  Qur’an  and  is  a 
commentary based on proofs proceeding from it, it contains necessary, 
purposeful, indeed, essential and beneﬁcial repetitions, the same as the 
Qur’an contains subtle, wise, and necessary repetitions which cause no 
boredom. Also, since the R i s a l e - i   N u r  consists of proofs of the profes-
sion of divine unity, which does not cause tedium but is repeated with 
pleasure and zeal, its essential repetitions are not a fault, and do not and 
should not cause boredom.

First Point

On the degrees of Ø × Ö Õ It consists of ﬁve points.

FIRST POINT

This phrase is a well-tried remedy for the sickness of human impotence 

and poverty: Ø × Ö Õ

The Giver of Existence is Eternally Existent, there is no harm therefore in 
the passing of beings, for things that are loved continue to exist through the 
continuance of the One Who gave them existence, the Necessary Existent.

He is the Enduring Maker and Creator; the passing of creatures causes 

no sorrow, then, for the means of love for them, their Maker, is Enduring.

He is the Eternal King and Lord, so there are no regrets on the passing of 

His dominions, on their departing and being renewed.

He is the Eternal All-Knowing Witness; no grief is felt therefore at the 
disappearance from this world of things that are loved, for they have perpet-
ual existence in the knowledge of that Pre- Eternal Witness and in His view.
He is the Enduring Owner and Creator; there is no pain therefore at the 
passing  of  beautiful  things,  for  the  source  of  their  beauty,  their  Creator’s 
names, are enduring.

He  is  the  Enduring  Inheritor  and  Raiser  to  Life;  there  should  be  no 
lamenting on being parted from beloveds, for the One Who will resurrect 
them and return them to Himself is Enduring.

He is Eternally All-Beauteous and Glorious; there should be no distress 
therefore at the disappearance of beautiful things, for those beautiful things 
are  the  mirrors  of  the  beautiful  names,  which  endure  together  with  their 
beauties after the disappearance of the mirrors.

He is the Eternal True Object of Love and Worship; so no sorrow should 
be  felt  on  the  passing  of  metaphorical  beloveds,  for  the  True  Beloved  is 
Eternal.

He  is  Eternally  Merciful,  Compassionate,  Loving,  and  Clement;  so 
the passing of the apparent bestowers of bounties and compassion has no

93

importance, it should cause no sorrow or despair, for the One Whose mercy 
and compassion encompass all things is Enduring.

He  is  Eternally  Beauteous,  Gracious,  and  Kind;  the  disappearance  of 
gracious and sympathetic beings, therefore, should neither cause pain, nor 
should  importance  be  given  it,  for  the  One  Who  takes  the  place  of  all  of 
them and a single of Whose manifestations they cannot all together replace, 
is Enduring.

Since He is Enduring and possesses these attributes, He takes the place of 

every sort of transient, ephemeral beloved in this world. 

Ø × Ö Õ

Yes, sufﬁcient for the immortality of this world and all it contains is the 

enduring existence of its Owner, Maker, and Creator.

Second Point

SECOND POINT

Sufﬁcient for my immortality is Allah, for He is my Eternal Allah and my 
Eternal Creator, the Eternal Giver of my existence, my Eternal Maker, my 
Eternal Owner, my Eternal Witness, the Eternal True Object of my Worship, 
my Eternal Resurrector. There is therefore no harm in the disappearance of 
my being; there should be no sorrow, regret, or grief. For the Giver of my 
existence is Enduring, and His creation through His names is also Enduring. 
The attributes of my person are nothing but the rays of one of His names. 
They exist permanently in their Creator’s knowledge and within His view, 
and do not therefore cease to exist on their passing and disappearance.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me in respect of immortality and the pleasure of 
it, are my knowledge, understanding, consciousness, and belief that the rays 
in my being of an Enduring name of my Allah are Enduring, and that the 
reality of my being is nothing other than a shadow of that name, and that 
through the mystery of its reﬂection or image in the mirror of my being, my 
reality is not itself lovable but is lovable on account of the immortality of the 
various enduring things reﬂected in it.

Third Point

THIRD POINT

Ø × Ö Õ  For  He  is  the  Necessary  Existent,  and  these 
transitory beings are nothing other than places reﬂecting the renewal of the 
manifestations of His existence and giving of existence. Through Him and 
through being connected to Him and through knowledge of Him, are end-
less lights of existence; while without Him, there are the endless darkness of 
non-existence and the limitless pains of separation.

THE RAYS

These transitory beings are mere mirrors, and with the changing of their 
relative determinations, they are renewed in six aspects in their transience, 
disappearance, and permanence:

T h e   F i r s t :  The permanent existence of their beautiful meanings and iden-

tities in the World of Similitudes.

T h e   S e c o n d :  The permanent existence of their forms in the tablets of the 

World of Similitudes.

to the hereafter.

T h e   T h i r d :  The permanent existence of their results and fruits which look 

T h e   F o u r t h :  The permanent existence of their dominical gloriﬁcations, 

represented [ in the Preserved Tablet ], which is a sort of existence.

T h e   F i f t h :  The permanent existence in the exhibitions of knowledge and 

eternal vistas.

T h e   S i x t h :  The  permanent  existence  of  their  spirits,  if  they  have  them. 
For their various functions and states in their death, transience, disappear-
ance,  annihilation,  and  their  appearance  and  extinction,  is  nothing  other 
than what is demanded by the divine names. It is due to the mystery of this 
that beings ﬂow like a rushing torrent on the waves of life and death, exist-
ence and non-existence. And from this function arises perpetual activity and 
continuous  creation.  I,  and  everyone,  therefore,  all  are  compelled  to  say: 
Ø × Ö Õ That is, as regards existence, it is sufﬁcient for me 
that I am the work of the Necessary Existent; to receive this illumined exist-
ence for a passing instant is preferable to millions of years of apparent, fruit-
less existence.

Yes,  through  the  mystery  of  being  related  to  Allah  through  belief,  a 
minute of this existence is the equivalent of thousands of years without the 
relation of belief; the degrees of existence of that minute, even, are more 
complete and extensive than those thousands of years.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me for existence and the value of existence is my 
being the art of the One Whose grandeur is in the heavens and signs are on 
the earth, and Who created the heavens and earth in six days.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me for existence and its perfection is my being 
the artefact of the One Who adorned and lit up the heavens with lamps, and 
made dazzling the earth with ﬂowers.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me for pride and honour is my being the crea-
ture and totally owned slave and servant of the One in relation to whose

perfection and beauty all the beauties and perfections of the universe are 
merely dim shadows, and signs of His perfection and indications of His 
beauty.

Likewise,  sufﬁcient  for  me  for  everything  is  He  who  stores  up  in  tiny 
containers between the k ā f  and the n ū n  1 incalculable numbers of bounties, 
and preserves through His power tons in a single handful of the subtle con-
tainers called seeds and grains.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me in place of all possessors of beauty and benef-
icence is the All- Beauteous and Compassionate One. For all these beautiful 
creatures are merely ephemeral mirrors for the renewal of the lights of His 
beauty in the course of the seasons, the centuries, and the ages. And all these 
recurring bounties and successive fruits of the spring and summer are places 
of manifestation for the renewal of His continuous bestowal in the passage 
of creatures, days, and years.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me for life and its true nature is my being a map, 
index, summary, balance, and measure of the manifestations of the names of 
the Creator of life and death.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me for life and its functions is my being a word 
inscribed  with  the  pen  of  power,  pointing  to  and  making  understood  the 
names of the Absolutely Powerful One, the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent; 
by my life receiving the manifestations of my Creator’s essential attributes, 
and His are the most beautiful names.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me for life and its rights is my displaying it among 
my brother creatures and proclaiming it to them, and exhibiting in the view 
of the Creator of the universe my being decked out in the manifestations of 
My Creator’s names, Who has adorned me with the bejewelled dress of my 
being, the gown of my inborn nature, and the necklace of my well- ordered 
life, which is ornamented with the gifts of His mercy.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me for the rights of my life are my understanding 
the salutations of living creatures to the Granter of Life and my observation 
of them, and my testifying to them.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me for the rights of my life is my being adorned 
and  made  beautiful  with  the  embossed  jewels  of  His  bounties,  to  present 
them  consciously,  by  virtue  of  my  belief,  to  the  view  of  the  Pre-Eternal 
Monarch.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me for life and its pleasures is my knowledge, 
realization, awareness, and belief that I am His slave, artefact, and creature, 
needy and wanting for Him; and He is my Creator, Compassionate to me, 
who nurtures and raises me muniﬁcently, graciously, through His bestowal, 
as beﬁts His wisdom and mercy.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me for life and its value is my being a measure  
through my absolute impotence, poverty, and weakness to the degrees of the 
power of the Absolutely Powerful One, the degrees of mercy of the Abso-
lutely  Compassionate  One,  and  the  levels  of  strength  of  the  Possessor  of 
Absolute Strength.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me for perfection is my knowledge that my Allah 
is Absolutely Perfect, and whatever things there are in the universe which 
are perfect, they are signs of His perfection and indications of it.

Likewise,  sufﬁcient  for  me  for  perfection  in  myself  is  belief  in  Allah, 

because for human beings, belief is the source of all perfections.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me for all my needs sought through the tongues 
of my various faculties, is my Allah, Sustainer, and Creator, the Giver of my 
form; His are the most beautiful names; He feeds me and gives me to drink; 
He nurtures, raises, administers, and perfects me; He is limitless in glory, 
and His favours are comprehensive.

heart, and nature, countless sensitive instruments to gauge the varieties of 
the treasures of His names.

Fifth Point

FIFTH POINT

I and all men should declare thankfully and proudly:
Sufﬁcient for me is the One Who created me and took me out of the dark-

ness of non-existence, bestowing on me light of being.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me is the One Who bestowed on me the bounty 
of life, which gives all things to those who possess it and stretches out its 
hands to all things.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me is the One Who made me a human being and 
bestowed on me the bounty of humanity, which makes man the microcosm, 
greater in meaning than the macrocosm.

Likewise,  sufﬁcient  for  me  is  the  One  Who  made  me  a  believer  and 
bestowed on me the bounty of belief, which makes this world and the here-
after two tables laden with bounties, and offers them to the believer with the 
hand of belief.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me is the One Who made me a member of the 
community  of  His  Beloved,  Muhammad  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace ), and bestowed on me love of Allah and being loved by Him, which 
are found in belief and are the highest degrees of human perfection; and 
through  this  love  springing  from  belief,  expanded  the  extent  to  which 
believers  could  beneﬁt,  to  the  inﬁnite  contents  of  the  spheres  of  contin-
gency and necessity.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me is the One Who, not making me inanimate 
or an animal or leaving me in misguidance, gave me preference with regard 
to nature, species, religion, and belief, over the majority of creatures; praise 
and thanks are therefore due to Him alone.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me is the One Who made me a comprehensive 
place of the manifestations of His names, and in accordance with the mean-
ing of the Hadith: “ The heavens and the earth contain me not; I am con-
tained  in  the  heart  of  my  believing  servant, ”  1  bestowed  on  me  a  bounty 
which  the  universe  could  not  contain;  that  is,  man’s  essential  nature  is  a 
comprehensive place of manifestation of all the divine names manifested in 
the universe.

Likewise, sufﬁcient for me is He Who bought from me the property of 
His I had in order to preserve it and later return it to me, and give me Para-
dise as the price. Praise and thanks be to Him to the number of particles of 
my being multiplied by the number of atoms in existence.

The Fifth Ray 

[ Thirteen years ago, 1 as an addendum to the discussion in M u h â k e m a t - ı  
B e d i ‘ i y e , which was published thirty years ago, the draft of twenty mat-
ters was written about the Barrier of Dhu’l-Qarnayn, Gog and Magog, 
and the signs of the end of time. This has now been corrected for the 
sake of a dear friend and been made the Fifth Ray. ]

The Fifth Ray of The Thirty-First Flash of 
The Thirty-First Letter

NOTE: So that the purpose of the introduction may be understood, the 
matters following the introduction should be read ﬁrst.

(cid:2)(cid:3)

A point about the verse,  ( 47:18 ) Ô Ó Ò was written in order to 
protect the belief of the mass of believers and preserve it from doubt. Like 
allegorical verses of the Qur’an, some Hadiths about the events of the end of 
time have profound meanings. They cannot be expounded in the same way 
as incontestable verses, and not everyone can understand them. Rather than 
being expounded, they are interpreted. According to the verse,

( 3:7 ) ¬ « ª © ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ 
their  meaning,  interpretation  and  what  is  intended  by  them  is  understood 
only after the event, so that those ﬁrmly grounded in knowledge say:

and they disclose those hidden truths.

( 3:7 ) ´ ³ ² ± ° ¯

designated The Fifth Ray, was compiled in Kastamonu, most probably in 1938. M u h â k e -

THE RAYS

This  Fifth  Ray  contains  an  introduction  and  twenty-three  matters.  The 

introduction consists of ﬁve points.

First Point

F i r s t   P o i n t :  Since belief and accountability are a test, a trial, a competi-
tion within the bounds of human will, matters that are obscure, profound, 
and in need of careful study and experiment cannot be obvious. They should 
not be so compelling that everyone has to afﬁrm them willy-nilly. For in this 
way the Abu Bakrs may rise to the highest of the high and the Abu Jahls 
descend to the lowest of the low. If there were no will, there would be no 
accountability. It is because of this mystery and wisdom that miracles are 
displayed  only  rarely,  and  in  this  realm  of  accountability,  like  some  alle-
gorical verses of the Qur’an, the signs of the end of the world, which in the 
future will be visible and observed, are obscure and open to interpretation. 
Since  when  the  sun  rises  in  the  west  it  will  be  so  clear  everyone  will  be 
compelled to afﬁrm it, the door of repentance will be closed and repentance 
and belief will no longer be accepted. For the Abu Bakrs and the Abu Jahls 
will be equal in their afﬁrmation of it. In fact, although when Jesus (Upon 
whom be peace) comes he himself will know that he is Jesus, not everyone 
will know. Moreover, such fearsome ﬁgures as the Dajjal and Sufyan ( Anti-
christ ) 1 will not know themselves to be such.

Second Point

S e c o n d   P o i n t :  Some of the matters of the Unseen, outside the realm of 
human  perception,  that  were  made  known  to  the  Prophet  (UWBP)  were 
made  known  in  detail.  These  he  could  in  no  way  alter  or  interfere  with, 
like the incontestable verses of the Qur’an and Sacred Hadiths. 2 Others, he 
would illustrate employing his eloquence and explain in detail or allegori-
cally suitably to the wisdom of human accountability. For example, one time 
when conversing with some people, a deep rumbling was heard. He said: “It 
is the sound of a rock which has been rolling down hill for seventy years and 
has at this moment come to rest in the very pit of Hell. ” 3 Five minutes after 
he made this strange announcement, someone came and said: “ Such-and-
such a dissembler has died. He was seventy years old, and has gone to Hell, ” 
revealing the meaning of the Prophet’s eloquent words.

Note

NOTE: Minor future events not included among the truths of belief were 

considered unimportant by the Prophet ( UWBP ).

Third Point

1.  There are numerous Hadiths about the Muslim Antichrist, known as the Sufyan ( a l -

S u f y ā n ī  ). See, for example, al-Ḥākim, a l - M u s t a d r a k , iv, 520. [ Tr. ]

2.  Ḥ a d ī t h   Q u d s ī : A saying of the Prophet ( UWBP ) imparted to him by revelation or 

inspiration, the wording of which was his own. [ Tr. ]

3.  M u s l i m , Janna, 31, No: 2844; M u s n a d , iii, 341,346.

THE FIFTH RAY

101

The First

T h e   T h i r d   P o i n t  consists of two points:
The First: Because in the course of time ordinary people attached literal 
meanings  to  some  Hadiths  which  had  been  narrated  in  the  form  of  com-
parisons and allegories, such Hadiths are apparently not conformable with 
reality. Although they are pure truth, they appear not to be so. For example, 
two angels called Thawr and Hut, who are among the bearers of the earth 
and as though the bearers of the Throne, were conceived of as a huge ox and 
a gigantic ﬁsh.

The Second

The Second: Some Hadiths refer to the majority of Muslims, or to the 
Islamic state, or to the centre of the caliphate, but they were understood to 
refer to all the people in the world. Although particular  in some respect, they 
were supposed to be universal and general. For instance, it says in a narra-
tion: “ A time will come when no one remains who says: Allah! Allah! ”  1 
That is, “ The places where Allah’s name is mentioned will be closed, and 
the call to prayer and k â m e t   will be recited in Turkish. ”

Fourth Point

F o u r t h   P o i n t :  Just as for numerous reasons and instances of wisdom 
hidden  matters  of  the  Unseen  like  death  and  the  appointed  hour  remain 
secret, so the end of the world, which is its death and the appointed hour of 
humankind and that of the animal kingdom, has been left secret for many 
good reasons.

Yes, if the appointed hour of death were speciﬁed, the ﬁrst half of life 
would be passed in absolute heedlessness and the second half in absolute 
terror,  as  every  day  a  further  step  was  taken  towards  the  gallows.  This 
would destroy the wise and beneﬁcial balance of hope and fear. Similarly, 
if the end of the world, its death and appointed hour, had been speciﬁed, 
the Early and Middle Ages would have been virtually unaffected by the 
idea of the hereafter, and the later ages would have been passed in terror. 
No pleasure or value would have remained in worldly life, nor, as an act 
of will, would the worship of Allah, between hope and fear, have held any 
importance or purpose. Also, if the death of the world had been speciﬁed, 
some of the truths of belief would have been clearly obvious and everyone 
would have afﬁrmed them willy-nilly. The mystery of human accountabil-
ity and the wisdom and purpose of belief, which are tied to man’s choice 
and will, would have been negated.

1.    Ti r m i d h ī ,  Fitan,  35;  al-Ḥākim, a l - M u s t a d r a k ,  iv,  494;  Ibn  Ḥibbān, a l - Ṣ a ḥ ī ḥ ,  viii, 

299.

102

THE RAYS

It  is  for  numerous  beneﬁts  such  as  these  that  matters  related  to  the 
Unseen remain secret. Everyone therefore continually bears in mind both 
his death and his continued life, and he works both for this world and the 
hereafter. He is also aware that the end of the world may occur in any age, 
or that it may continue, and so works for eternal life within the transitori-
ness of this world, and strives to build the world as though he were never 
going to die. 1

Also, if the occurrence of calamities had been speciﬁed, the person who 
expected  one  would  suffer  a  calamity  perhaps  ten  times  greater  than  the 
actual calamity. Divine wisdom and mercy have therefore veiled the time 
of their occurrence and left it secret, so that he does not suffer that misfor-
tune. It is because most hidden cosmic events are tied to such instances of 
wisdom that it is prohibited to give news of the Unseen or to foretell events. 
So  as  not  to  be  disrespectful  and  disobedient  in  the  face  of  the  principle 
ّ(cid:195)ا  َ
ّ(cid:202)ِا  َبْ(cid:193)َ(cid:155)ْ(cid:170)ا ُمـَ(cid:171)ْ(cid:151)َ(cid:192)  َ(cid:202) those people who with dominical leave give news of the 
Unseen other than questions concerning human accountability and the truths 
of belief have done so only allusively and indirectly. In fact, the good tidings 
about the Prophet Muhammad (UWBP) in the Torah, Gospels, and Psalms, 
are veiled and obscure, in consequence of which some of the adherents of 
those scriptures put different meanings on those passages and did not believe 
them. However, since the wisdom in human accountability necessitates that 
the questions included among the tenets of belief are communicated explic-
itly and repeatedly, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition and its Glorious 
Interpreter (Upon whom be blessings and peace) recount the matters of the 
hereafter in detail, and future worldly events only in summary fashion.

Fifth Point

F i f t h   P o i n t :   Also,  the  wondrous  acts  of  both  the  Antichrists  ( D a j j a l  ), 
looked to their centuries and were narrated in connection with them; in con-
sequence, the wonders have been imagined to proceed from their persons 
and this has led to the narrations being understood metaphorically and their 
true meanings being concealed. Like, for example, one of them travelling by 
aeroplane and railway train.

And, for example, it is well-known that when the Islamic Antichrist dies, 
the satan who serves him will shout out the news to the whole world 2 from 
Dikili Taş, the obelisk in Istanbul, and everyone will hear its voice saying 

1.  See, al-Suyūṭī, a l - F a t ḥ  a l - K a b ī r , i, 190, 202; al-Munāwī, F a y ḍ  a l - Q a d ī r , i, 532, No: 

1068; ii, 12, No: 1201.

2.  M u s l i m , Fitan, 34.

that he is dead. That is to say, the news will be broadcast by radio, which is 
wonderful and leaves even satans in amazement.

Also,  since  the  strange  circumstances  and  fearsome  activities  of  the 
Antichrist’s  regime  and  the  covert  organization  and  government  that  he 
founds, have been narrated as referring to his person, their true meaning 
has remained obscure. For example, “ He will be so powerful and persist-
ent that only Jesus ( UWP ) will be able to kill him; no other solution will 
be found. ” 1 That is, it will only be a revealed, elevated, pure religion that 
will be able to overturn his way and rapacious regime, and eliminate them. 
Such  a  religion  will  emerge  among  the  true  followers  of  Jesus  ( UWP ), 
and it will follow the Qur’an and become united with it. On the coming 
of Jesus ( UWP ), and emergence of the true Christian religion, the Anti-
christ’s irreligious way will be wiped out and will cease. The Antichrist’s 
person could otherwise be killed by a mere germ or by inﬂuenza.

Also, the explanations and statements of some narrators, made through 
their own exertions and interpretations, which are open to error, have been 
mixed up with the words of the Hadith. Their words have been supposed to 
be part of the Hadith and the Hadith’s meaning has been obscured. It then 
appears to be unconformable with reality and as though metaphorical.

Also, in early times the social collectivity and its collective personality 
had not developed as it has at the present and the idea of the single individual 
[or leader] was predominant. The extensive attributes and widescale actions 
of the community, therefore, were ascribed to the persons who led them. In 
order  to  be  worthy  and  ﬁtting  for  superhuman,  universal  attributes,  those 
persons had to have gigantic bodies and be of vast stature and have colos-
sal power and strength a hundred times surpassing their own, so that is how 
they were depicted. This was not conformable with reality and the narration 
became metaphorical.

Also,  although  the  circumstances  and  attributes  of  the  two  Antichrists 
differ from each other, they have been confused in narrations that have come 
down to us in absolute form; one has been supposed to be the other. Also, 
the circumstances of the Great Mahdi do not ﬁt the narrations alluding to 
the  earlier  Mahdis,  and  these  have  become  metaphorical  Hadiths.  Imam 
‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) mentions only the Islamic Antichrist 
( D a j j a l  ).

Ḥākim, a l - M u s t a d r a k , iv, 529-30.

THE RAYS

This marks the end of the Introduction. Now we embark on the matters.

[ Now, with divine assistance, out of hundreds of examples of those 
hidden events of the Unseen, twenty-three matters will be explained 
extremely  concisely,  since  they  have  been  spread  by  atheists  with 
the  idea  of  corrupting  the  beliefs  of  the  ordinary  people.  I  beseech 
dominical mercy that these matters will cause no harm, as the atheists 
surmised, but that when it is seen that each is a miraculous prophetic 
utterance and their true interpretations are proved and made clear, they 
will be an effective means of strengthening the belief of people gener-
ally. And I entreat my Compassionate Sustainer to forgive my faults 
and errors. ]

of the Fifth Ray

(cid:2)(cid:3)

First Matter

FIRST MATTER

There  is  a  narration  which  says:  “ The  hand  of  the  Sufyan,  one  of  the 

prominent ﬁgures of the end of time, will be pierced. ”

ُمـَ(cid:171)ْ(cid:150)َا ُ

ّ(cid:195)َا an interpretation of this is as follows: if a person is very extrava-
gant, and indulges in dissipated amusements, he cannot hold onto his pos-
sessions; they are poured away with his wastefulness. It is said in the prov-
erb: “ So-and-so has a hole in his hand. ” That is, he is very extravagant and 
wasteful.

Thus, this Hadith infers that the Sufyan will bind people to himself by 
encouraging them to be wasteful. By arousing in them an intense greed and 
ambition, he will hold them in subjection through that weak vein of charac-
ter. It predicts that the extravagant will become captive to him and fall into 
his trap.

Second Matter

SECOND MATTER

It says in a narration: “ A fearsome person at the end of time will rise in 

the morning and on his forehead will be written ٌرِ(cid:158)اــﯬﯦ اَذٰ(cid:182) 1

ّ(cid:135)(cid:170)اِ(cid:92) ُمـَ(cid:171)ْ(cid:150)َا ُ

ّ(cid:195)َا this may be interpreted as follows: the Sufyan will wear 
the headgear of non-believers, and make everyone else wear it. However, 
since it will be generally adopted under compulsion and the force of the law, 
when  that  headgear  is  taken  into  prostration  [ in  worship ],  it  will  become 
rightly-guided, Allah willing, so that those who wear it  –unwillingly –  will 
not become unbelievers.

Third Matter

THIRD MATTER

There is a narration: “ The despotic rulers of the end of time, especially 

the Antichrist ( Dajjal ), will have false paradises and hells. ” 2

ّ(cid:195)ا َدْ(cid:179)ِ(cid:150) ُمـْ(cid:171) ِ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)َا an interpretation is this: it is an indication concerning the 
prison and high school which are situated opposite the government ofﬁces 
and are facing each other: one will become an ugly imitation of a huri and 
youth of Paradise, and the other will become a dungeon and torture-chamber.

Fourth Matter

FOURTH MATTER

There is a narration which says: “ At the end of time no one will remain

meeting-places, the places where Allah’s name is recited, and the religious 
schools ( m e d r e s e  ) will be closed, and a name other than Allah will used in 
such marks of Islam, as the call to prayer and k â m e t . It does not mean that 
all humankind is going to fall into absolute disbelief, for denial of Allah is 
as irrational as denying the universe. It is unreasonable to suppose that the 
majority of people should do so, let alone all of them. The unbelievers do not 
deny Allah, they are in error concerning His attributes.

Another interpretation is this: the spirits of the believers will be seized 
a little previously to the end of the world so that they do not experience its 
terror. Doomsday will erupt over the heads of the unbelievers.

Fifth Matter

FIFTH MATTER

There  is  a  narration:  “ At  the  end  of  time,  certain  persons  such  as  the 
Antichrist ( Dajjal ) will claim godhead and force others to prostrate before 
themselves. ” 2
ُمـَ(cid:171)ْ(cid:150)َا ُ

ّ(cid:195)َا an interpretation is this: just as a nomad chieftain who denies the 
king imagines in himself and in other chieftains a small rulership propor-
tionate to their power; so those who come to lead the school of naturalists 
and  naterialists,  imagine  in  themselves  a  sort  of  lordship  proportionate  to 
their power, and to demonstrate their power, make their subjects bow down 
worshipfully before themselves and their statues, and incline their heads.

Sixth Matter

SIXTH MATTER

There is a narration: “ The dissension of the end of time will be so ter-
rible that no one will be able to restrain themselves. ” 3 It is because of this

that for one thousand three hundred years, on the command of the Prophet 
( UWBP ) all the Umma has sought refuge with Allah from that dissension

ّ(cid:195)َا  it  may  be  interpreted  like  this:  the  dissension  of  the 
end  of  time  will  draw  souls  to  itself,  captivating  them.  People  will  join 
it  voluntarily,  indeed,  eagerly.  For  example,  in  Russia,  men  and  women 
bathe naked together in the public baths. And because by nature women 
have  a  strong  propensity  to  show  off  their  beauty,  they  willingly  throw 
themselves  into  that  dissension  and  are  led  astray.  The  men  too,  being 
naturally enamoured of beauty, are defeated by their instinctual souls, and 
with drunken joy, fall into the ﬁre and are burnt. Holding a fascination, the 
amusements, grievous sins, and innovations of the times such as dancing 
and the theatre, draw the pleasure-seekers around them like moths, intoxi-
cating  them.  But  if  this  occurs  through  absolute  compulsion,  the  will  is 
negated and it is not even a sin.

Seventh Matter

SEVENTH MATTER

There is a narration: “ The Sufyan will be an eminent scholar; he will fall 
into misguidance through his learning. Numerous other scholars will follow 
him. ”

ّ(cid:195)ا َدْ(cid:179)ِ(cid:150) ُمـْ(cid:171) ِ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)اَو  an interpretation is this: although he possesses no means 
of sovereignty such as strength and power, tribes and peoples, or the cour-
age and riches of a king, he will win that position through his cleverness, art, 
and political acumen, and using his intelligence he will bewitch the minds of 
many other scholars, making them dictate his wishes. He will attract numer-
ous teachers to support him, and pointing out to them the way to an educa-
tion  system  stripped  of  religious  instruction,  will  work  for  its  widespread 
enforcement.

Eighth Matter

EIGHTH MATTER

Narrations state that the terrible dissension of the Antichrist ( Dajjal ) will 
occur among Muslims,2 so that the Umma has always sought refuge with  
Allah from it.

different. In fact, like Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ), some 
investigative scholars said that the Muslims’ Antichrist ( Dajjal ) is the Suf-
yan. He will appear from among the Muslims and will carry out his work 
through  deception.  The  Great  Dajjal  of  the  unbelievers  is  different.  1  For 
those  who  do  not  bow  to  the  absolute  force  and  compulsion  of  the  Great 
Dajjal are martyrs, and those who submit unwillingly are not unbelievers, 
and not sinners even.

Ninth Matter

NINTH MATTER

In  narrations,  the  events  associated  with  the  Sufyan  and  those  of  the

Caliphate were in Iraq, Damascus, and Medina, in their own interpretations, 
the narrators showed these events as occurring close to the centre of Islamic 
government, as though it were always going to remain thus, and said Aleppo 
and Damascus. They added their own details to the succinct predictions of

lective personality those ﬁgures represent. At one time, the commander-in-
chief  of  the  Japanese  Army,  which  had  defeated  Russia,  was  shown  in  a 
picture with one foot in the Paciﬁc Ocean and the other foot in the fort of 
Port Arthur. The vastness of its collective personality was depicted in the 
representation of his person and in the gigantic form of the representation. 
As for their extraordinarily vast power, since most of the affairs they carry 
out are destructive and related to the appetites, they appear to have extraor-
dinary power, for destruction is easy; one match can burn down a village. 
As for the satisfying the animal appetites, since it is what the instinctual soul 
wants, it is much sought after.

There is a narration which says: “ At the end of time, one man will look 

ّ(cid:195)َا this may be interpreted in two ways:

ِباَو َ
F i r s t l y :  Lawful  marriage  will  decrease  at  that  time,  or  like  in  Russia, 
it will disappear. Someone who ﬂees from being tied to one woman, will 
remain at a loose end and act as a shepherd to forty unfortunate women.

T h e   S e c o n d :  It is an allusion that at that time of dissension, most of the 
men  will  perish  in  wars,  and  for  some  reason  most  of  the  children  born 
will be girls. Perhaps as well, the total freedom of women will so inﬂame 
their lust that they will acquire innate superiority over their menfolk. This 
will result in their causing their children to take after them, and through the 
divine command, girl children will be more numerous.

Twelfth Matter

TWELFTH MATTER

It says in narrations : “ The Dajjal’s ﬁrst day will be a year, his second 

day a month, his third day a week, and his fourth day a day. ” 2

ّ(cid:195)ا  َ
T h e   F i r s t :  It  is  an  allusion  and  sign  that  the  Great  Dajjal  will  appear 
near the North Pole or towards the north. For close to the North Pole the 
whole year is one day and one night. If he comes a day’s journey in this 
direction  by  train  in  the  summer,  for  a  month  the  sun  never  sets.  If  he 
comes a day further in this direction, the sun is visible for a whole week. 
When I was a prisoner-of-war in Russia I was close to this region. That 
means it foretells miraculously that the Great Dajjal will attack from the 
North in this direction.

T h e   S e c o n d   I n t e r p r e t a t i o n :  The three days refer to both the Great Daj-
jal and the Islamic Dajjal having three periods of despotism. With elevated 
eloquence it informs the Umma that “ in his ﬁrst day; in his ﬁrst period of 
government, he will perform works so great they could not be performed in 
three hundred years. On his second day, that is, in his second period, he will 
carry out such works as could not be carried out in thirty years. In his third

THIRTEENTH MATTER

There is a deﬁnite, sound narration which says: “ Jesus (Upon whom be 

peace) will kill the Great Dajjal. ” 1

ّ(cid:195)ا َدْ(cid:179)ِ(cid:150) ُمـْ(cid:171) ِ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)اَو there are two aspects to this:
T h e   F i r s t   A s p e c t : It could only be a wondrous person with the power 
of miracles who could kill and change the way of the awesome Dajjal, for 
he will preserve himself through such wonders as magic, hypnotic powers, 
and spiritualism bestowed on him by Allah in order to lead him astray, and 
he  will  spellbind  everyone.  And  that  person  will  be  Jesus  (Upon  whom 
be peace), who is the prophet of the majority of mankind and whom most 
people follow.

T h e   S e c o n d   A s p e c t   i s   t h i s : It will be the truly pious followers of Jesus 
who will kill the gigantic collective personality of materialism and irreligion 
which the Dajjal will form – for the Dajjal will be killed by Jesus’ ( UWP ) 
sword – and destroy his ideas and disbelief, which are atheistic. Those truly 
pious Christians will blend the essence of true Christianity with the essence 
of Islam and rout the Dajjal with their combined strength, in effect killing 
him. The narration: “ Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ) will come and will per-
form the obligatory prayers behind the Mahdi and follow him, ” 2 alludes to 
this union, and to the sovereignty of the Qur’an and its being followed.

Fifteenth Matter

FIFTEENTH MATTER

The  events  involving  Gog  and  Magog  are  mentioned  concisely  in  the 
Qur’an, but some details concerning them appear in narrations. Such details 
are not ﬁrmly established like the Qur’an’s concise but incontrovertible mat-
ters, and may be considered allegorical. They require interpretation. Indeed, 
they  need  to  be  interpreted,  for  the  narrators’  interpretations  have  been 
mixed in with them.

indication that just as the Manchurian and Mongol tribes, called “ Gog and 
Magog ” in the heavenly tongue of the Qur’an,  1 together with some other 
tribes, several times overturned Asia and Europe; so will they again cause 
chaos in the world in the future. In fact even now some of them are famous 
anarchists, and anarchy is born of communism.

Yes, ُ

Yes, socialism sprang up in the French Revolution from the seed of liber-
tarianism. Then since socialism destroyed certain sacred matters, the ideas it 
inculcated turned into bolshevism. And because bolshevism corrupted sacred 
moral and human values to an even greater extent, and those of the human 
heart, of course the seeds it sowed will produce anarchy, which recognizes 
no  restrictions  whatsoever  and  has  respect  for  nothing.  For  if  respect  and 
compassion quit the human heart, people with such hearts become exceed-
ingly cruel beasts and can no longer be governed through politics. As for 
the  place  for  anarchy,  it  will  be  those  oppressed,  numerous  raiding  tribes 
which  are  backward  in  respect  of  both  civilization  and  government.  The 
Manchurian, Mongol, and some of the Kirghiz tribes ﬁt those conditions, 
for they caused the building of the Great Wall of China, which is forty-days’ 
distance in length and is one of the seven wonders of the world. Expounding 
the Qur’an’s concise statements about them, Muhammad (Upon whom be 
blessings and peace) predicted their appearance miraculously and precisely.

and sign that quantitively the spiritual community of m u j a h i d i n  that will rec-
ognize Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ) and follow him, will be very few and 
small comparatively to the ‘scientiﬁc’, physical armies of the Dajjal.

He will travel the world in forty days and have a wondrous ass. ” 2

ُمـَ(cid:171)ْ(cid:150)َا ُ

ّ(cid:195)َا on condition such narrations are completely sound, they miracu-
lously predict that in the time of the Dajjal, the means of communication 
and travel will have so advanced that an event will be heard by all the world 
in a day. It will be shouted out by the radio and will be heard in east and 
west, and will be read about in all the newspapers. One man will travel the 
whole world in forty days and see the seven continents and seventy coun-
tries. These narrations thus miraculously foretold the telegraph, telephone, 
radio, railway, and aeroplane ten centuries before they appeared.

Moreover, the Dajjal will be heard not in his capacity as the Dajjal, but as 
a despotic king. And his travelling everywhere will not be to occupy those 
places, but to create dissension and to seduce people away from the right 
path. His mount or ass is either a railway train, one ear and head of which is 
an infernal ﬁrebox, and the other ear of which is a false paradise gorgeously 
adorned and furnished. He sends his enemies to its ﬁery head, and his friends 
to its feasting head. Or else his mount is an awesome motor car, or a plane, 
or... ( silence! )

nant and victorious for only ﬁve hundred years.

ُمـَ(cid:171)ْ(cid:150)َا ُ

ّ(cid:195)َا  this  narration  is  not  giving  news  of  the  end  of  the  world,  but 
of Islam’s victorious rule and the sovereignty of the caliphate, for miracu-
lously, that is exactly how it turned out. For because towards the end of the 
‘Abbasid  caliphate  its  politicians  lost  their  sense  of  direction,  it  survived 
only ﬁve hundred years. But because the Umma in general did not deviate 
from the straight path, the Ottoman caliphate came to its assistance and it 
took over the rule of the Umma, which has continued in existence for one 
thousand three hundred years. Then because the Ottoman politicians were 
unable to maintain their direction, its caliphate survived only ﬁve hundred 
years ( as the caliphate ), and with its demise it conﬁrmed the Hadith’s mirac-
ulous prediction. This Hadith has been discussed in other treatises, so we 
curtail the discussion here.

Ninteenth Matter

NINTEENTH MATTER

In the narrations are various prophecies about the Mahdi ( May Allah be 
pleased with him ), who is one of the signs of the end of time and will be 
from the Family of the Prophet (UWBP). In fact, some scholars and saints 
stated long ago that he had appeared.

ِباَو َ

ّ(cid:135)(cid:170)اِ(cid:92) ُمـَ(cid:171)ْ(cid:150)َا ُ

ّ(cid:195)َا  one  interpretation  of  these  various  narrations  is  this: 
the Great Mahdi will have numerous functions. He will carry out duties in 
the world of politics, the world of religion, the world of government, and 
in the many spheres of the world of j i h a d . Similarly, since every century at 
a time of despair people are in need of a sort of Mahdi to strengthen their 
morale or of the possibility of a Mahdi appearing at that time to assist them, 
through divine mercy, every age or perhaps every century a sort of Mahdi 
has  appeared  from  among  the Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  descendants,  and  pre-
served his forefather’s Shari‘a and revived his Sunna. The narrations about 
the Mahdi are various because Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ) saw persons who would perform some of the Great Mahdi’s works; 
for  example,  the  ‘Abbasid  Mahdi  in  the  world  of  politics,  and  Gawth  al-

the world of religion. For this reason some of the people of reality said that 
he had already appeared. Anyway, since this matter has been explained in 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r , we refer discussion of it to that and here only say this:

There is no family in the world so mutually supportive, nor a tribe in such 
agreement, nor so enlightened a community or society as the family, tribe, 
community and society of the Prophet’s (UWBP) Family.

Yes, the Prophet’s (UWBP) Family has raised hundreds of sacred heroes, 
and produced thousands of spiritual leaders of the Umma, and has been nur-
tured with the leaven of the reality of the Qur’an and the light of belief and 
honour of Islam, and has thus been perfected. It is therefore totally reason-
able that by reviving the Shari‘a of Muhammad ( UWBP ) and his Sunna and 
the truth of the Qur’an at the end of time, and proclaiming them and putting 
them into practice, they should display to the world the perfect justice and 
veracity  of  the  Great  Mahdi,  their  commander-in-chief.  This  is  also  both 
necessary and essential and demanded by the principles of human society.

The  sun  rising  in  the  west  1  and  the  emergence  of  the  Beast  (d ā b b a t  

The sun rising in the west will be a self-evident sign of the end of the 
world, and because it is self-evident it will be a heavenly event that closes 
the door of repentance, which is tied to the will and reason. Its meaning is 
therefore clear, so is in no need of interpretation. One may just say the fol-
lowing:

go  mad.  With  divine  permission,  its  rotation  will  be  reversed  on  another 
planet  colliding  with  it.  Through  divine  will,  its  journeying  from  west  to 
east will be reversed to from east to west and the sun will start to rise in the 
west. Yes, the Qur’an is “ t h e   ﬁ r m   c o r d   o f   A l l a h ,  ” 3 which binds the earth to

with its reversed uncontrolled motion, the sun will rise in the west. There 
is another interpretation, which is that due to a collision, Doomsday would 
break forth at the divine command.

As  for  the  Beast,  in  the  Qur’an  is  an  extremely  concise  indication, 
a  brief  expression  made  by  its  tongue  of  disposition.  As  for  its  details, 
like  with  some  other  matters,  I  do  not  know  with  any  certainty  for  the

people who knowingly and willingly rebel due to the dissension of the Suf-
yan and Dajjals, and due to the anarchy of Gog and Magog embark on cor-
ruption and savagery, and fall into irreligion, disbelief, and denial, a beast 
will emerge from the earth and beset and rout them. A l l a h   k n o w s   b e s t , that 
beast is a species. For even if huge, a single creature could not be every-
where. That means there will be a truly terrible species of animal. Perhaps, 
as indicated by the verse,

( 34:14 ) Ö Õ Ô Ó Ò 
the  creature  will  be  a  sort  of  termite,  called  “ d ā b b a t   a l - a r ḍ , ”  which  will 
gnaw away at the bones of men as though they were wooden, establishing 
themselves in every part of their bodies, from their teeth to their ﬁnger-nails. 
By making the creature speak on the question of belief, the verse 1 indicates 
that through the blessing of belief and their avoiding vice and abuses, the 
believers will be saved from it.

wisdom and meaning of this?

T h e   A n s w e r : ُمـَ(cid:171)ْ(cid:150)َا ُ

ّ(cid:195)َا the wisdom in it is this: just as at the divine com-
mand,  Jesus  ( Upon  whom  be  peace )  abrogated  some  of  the  burdensome 
ordinances of the Mosaic Law, making lawful some things agreeable to the 
appetites like wine, so too at the command of Satan and due to his tempta-
tions, the Great Dajjal will abrogate the injunctions of the Christian Law, and 
destroying the bonds in accordance with which the life of Christian society 
is administered, he will prepare the ground for anarchy and Gog and Magog. 
Similarly, the Sufyan, the Islamic Dajjal, due to the devices of Satan and the 
evil-commanding soul, will try to abrogate some of the eternal injunctions 
of the Shari‘a of Muhammad ( UWBP ), and destroying the material, moral 
and spiritual bonds of human life, and leaving headstrong, drunken, giddy 
souls without restriction, he will unfasten the luminous chains of respect and 
compassion. By giving people a freedom which is pure despotism so they 
fall on one another in a swamp of putrid lust, he will open up the way to a 
terrible anarchy. There will then be no way those people can be kept under 
control other than by the most repressive despotism.

Mentioned in the narrations are the wondrous achievements of the two 
Dajjals,  and  their  superhuman  power  and  majesty.  It  is  foretold  even  that 
some unfortunates will ascribe a sort of godhead to them. What is the reason 
for this?

appetites, they carry out those works easily, so that it says in one narration: 
“ A single of their days is a year. ” That is, the works they carry out in one 
year  would  not  normally  be  carried  out  in  three  hundred.  There  are  four 
aspects of and reasons for their power appearing to be superhuman:

•  T h e   F i r s t :  As the result of a divine scheme permitting them to do so, 
the  good  things  and  advances  which  are  achieved  through  the  strength  of 
brave armies and active nations in their despotic, huge states, are unjustly 
attributed to them. As a result, their persons are imagined to have the power 
of a thousand men. But rightfully and according to the rules, the positive 
good, honour, and booty won through the actions of a community should 
be divided among the community and given to its members. And any evils, 
destruction, and losses should be ascribed to its leader’s lack of precautions 
and faults. For example, if a batallion conquers a citadel, the booty and hon-
our is due to their bayonets. While if there are any losses due to faulty plan-
ning, they are the commander’s.

Thus, entirely contrarily to this fundamental principle of truth and reality, 
since positive progress and all things good are ascribed to those fearsome 
leaders, and negative developments and evils are attributed to their unfortu-
nate peoples, as the result of a divine scheme, those persons, who deserve 
to be abominated by everyone, are loved by all the heedless and neglectful.
• T h e  S e c o n d  A s p e c t  a n d  R e a s o n :  Because both Dajjals employ the sever-
est despotism, the greatest tyranny, and the maximum violence and terror, 
they appear to have vast power. Yes, a despotism so extraordinary that under 
the  cloak  of  laws,  they  intervene  in  everyone’s  consciences  and  religious 
beliefs, and even their clothes. It is my guess that with a premonition of the 
future the lovers of freedom at the end of the last century perceived this awe-
some despotism and letting ﬂy their arrows at it, attacked it. But they were 
sorely misled and attacked on the wrong front. It is tyranny and coercion 
so great that it wipes out a hundred villages because of one man, punishing 
hundreds of innocent people and ruining them by forced migrations.

• T h e   T h i r d   A s p e c t   a n d   R e a s o n :  Because both Dajjals will win the assist-
ance of a secret Jewish society which nurtures a terrible desire for revenge 
on  Islam  and  Christianity,  and  that  of  another  secret  society  which  uses 
women’s liberation as a screen, and because the Islamic Dajjal will deceive 
even the Masonic lodges and win their support, they will be supposed to pos-
sess tremendous power. Also, it is understood from the divinations of some 
of the saints that the Dajjal called Sufyan who will come to lead the Islamic 

118

THE RAYS

world  will  be  a  leading  politician  who  is  extremely  capable,  intelligent, 
and  active,  does  not  like  ostentation  and  gives  no  importance  to  personal 
rank and glory; he will be a military leader who is extremely bold, forceful, 
energetic, and resolute, and does not condescend to fame-seeking, and he 
will captivate the Muslims. Taking advantage of their lack of hypocrisy, he 
will have their extraordinarily brilliant works ascribed to himself, as well as 
the progress they have achieved driven by the severe need arising from the 
transformation and renewal of the large army and state and the upheavals of 
the First World War, and he will have it bruited everywhere by eulogists that 
he possesses a wondrous and extraordinary power.

• T h e   F o u r t h   A s p e c t   a n d   R e a s o n :  The Great Dajjal will have spellbind-
ing,  charismatic  qualities,  while  the  Islamic  Dajjal  will  have  fascinating, 
hypnotic powers in one eye. It even says in narrations: “ The Dajjal will be 
blind in one eye. ” 1 By drawing attention to this and pointing out that one 
of the Great Dajjal’s eyes will be blind, and one eye of the other Dajjal will 
be blind in comparison with his other eye, the Hadith is indicating that since 
they will be absolute unbelievers, they will have only one eye and their sight 
will be restricted to this world, and they will have no eyes that see the here-
after and consequences of actions.

I too saw the Islamic Dajjal in a spirit world. I observed with my own 
eyes that he possessed a spellbinding hypnotic power in one of his eyes, and 
I understood him to be a total denier of Allah. He will attack religion and 
the sacred with a boldness and insolence arising from his absolute denial. 
But since the ordinary people will not know the truth of the matter, they will 
suppose it to be an extraordinary power and courage.

Also, because such a magniﬁcent, lucky, successful, and cunning com-
mander, who is merely being led on by Allah, appears at the time of a heroic 
and  glorious  nation’s  defeat,  with  their  love  of  heroism  the  people  will 
applaud  and  fete  him  without  considering  his  hidden,  terrible  true  nature, 
and will want to cover up his iniquities. However, it is understood from nar-
rations that through the light of belief and light of the Qur’an in their spirits, 
the heroic, m u j a h i d  army and religious nation will see the truth and will try 
to repair that commander’s terrible destruction.

THE THIRD BRIEF MATTER

This consists of three instructive incidents.
F i r s t   I n c i d e n t :  One  time,  Allah’s  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be 
blessings and peace ) pointed out to ‘Umar ( May Allah be pleased with him ) 
one of a group of Jewish children, and said: “ He is his very image! ” ‘Umar 
said: “ Then I shall kill him! ” But Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) replied: “ If 
it is the Sufyan, the Islamic Dajjal, you cannot kill him. And if it is not, he 
cannot be killed through his image. ” 1

This narration indicates that at the time of his rule, the Sufyan’s image 
will appear on numerous things and that he will be born a Jew. It is strange 
that  although  ‘Umar  ( May  Allah  be  pleased  with  him )  was  sufﬁciently 
angry  and  hostile  towards  him  to  be  able  to  kill  a  child  resembling  him, 
someone the Sufyan most admired and liked and spoke off with praise and 
appreciation turned out to be ‘Umar.

S e c o n d   I n c i d e n t :  Many  people  narrated  that  the  Islamic  Dajjal  will 
be curious about the meaning of the sura, ( 95:1 ) " ! and will ask 
about it.

It is strange but the verse  ( 96:6 )  g f e d in the following sura,  
( 96:1 )  O N M L K according to j a f r  reckoning and its meaning, also 
indicates  his  time  and  person,  pointing  out  that  he  will  overweeningly 
aggress against the mosques and the people who perform the prayers. That 
is to say, that man, who is being led on by Allah, perceives that a short sura 
is concerned with him, but makes a mistake and knocks on its neighbour’s 
door.

T h i r d   I n c i d e n t :  It says in a narration: “ T h e   I s l a m i c   D a j j a l   w i l l   a p p e a r  

i n   K h o r a s a n . ” 2

َ(cid:202) an interpretation of it is this: the Turks, the bravest 
and most numerous and powerful people of the east and the heroic army of 
Islam, were at the time of the narration, around the region of Khorasan and 
had not yet made their homeland in Anatolia. By mentioning the region 
they inhabited, it is indicating that the Sufyan Dajjal would appear from 
among them.

FIRST   QUESTION:  The blessed phrases of the t a s h a h h u d  were spo-
ken by Almighty Allah and His Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ) on the night of his Ascension, so what is the reason for their being 
recited in the prescribed prayers?

T h e      A n s w e r :  For all believers, the ﬁve daily prayers are a sort of Ascen-
sion. The words of the t a s h a h h u d , being spoken during the Supreme Ascen-
sion of Muhammad (Upon whom be blessings and peace), were ﬁtting for 
the divine presence. By reciting them, believers recall that sacred conver-
sation, and through the recollection, the meanings of those blessed words 
cease  being  particular  and  become  universal;  their  sacred,  comprehensive 
meanings  are,  or  may  be,  conceived  of.  Through  such  a  conception,  their 
value and light are enhanced and expanded.

For  example,  instead  of  giving  the  greeting  of  “ peace ”  that  night  to 
Almighty Allah, the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace )

Yes,  with  the  word  ُتاَ

ّ(cid:99)(cid:170)َا  Allah’s  Most  Noble  Messenger  ( UWBP ) 
intentionally  offered  to  Allah  all  the  worship  living  creatures  perform

ُتاﯬﯦَراَ(cid:93)ُ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)َا which is the summary of “ salutations, ” he was representing 
the natural blessedness, plenty, and worship of creatures, especially seeds, 
grains, and eggs, which are the means of blessings and abundance, and cause 
one to exclaim: “ How great are Allah’s blessings! ” For they are the essence 
of life and living beings. He uttered it with this broad meaning.

With the word “ benedictions ”  ُتاَوَ(cid:171) َ

ّ(cid:135)(cid:170)َا which is a summary of “ bless-

Almighty Allah saying that night:  ُ

tion and indirect command that in the future, hundreds of millions of people 
would say at least ten times daily:  ُ

that in the future his vast community and the righteous members of it would 
reﬂect  Islam,  which  represents  the  divine  greeting,  and  that  all  his  com-

A strange state of mind that assisted in the unfolding of the above truth

One time while in a dark exile, on a dark night, and in a dark state of 
heedlessness, the mighty universe of the present appeared to my imagination 
as a lifeless, spiritless, dead, empty, desolate, ghastly corpse. The past, too, 
appeared to be dead, empty, deceased, and dreadful; that boundless space 
and limitless time took on the form of a dark wilderness. I had recourse to 
the prayers in order to be saved from my state of mind. When I said:  ُتاَ
ّ(cid:99)(cid:170)َا 
in  the t a s h a h h u d ,  the  universe  suddenly  sprang  to  life.  It  was  resurrected 
taking on a living, luminous form, becoming a shining mirror of the Ever-
Living and Self-Subsistent One. I saw that with all its living parts, it was 
continuously offering the salutations of their lives and their vital gifts to the 
Ever- Living and Self-Subsistent One; I understood this with the knowledge 
of certainty, even with absolute certainty.

ّ(cid:193) ِ(cid:111)َ

Then, when I declared:  ُ

was transformed under the leadership of Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon

question.

First Aspect

T h e   A n s w e r :  There  are  three  aspects  and  three  questions  within  this 

F i r s t   A s p e c t :  For sure Abraham ( Upon whom be peace ) was not equal 
to  Muhammad  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace ),  but  his  family  or 
descendants  were  prophets.  Muhammad’s  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace ) family were saints, and saints cannot reach the level of the prophets. 
Evidence that this prayer for his family has been accepted in shining fashion 
is this:

It was because they received the effulgence of the Hadith: 

ّ(cid:174)ُا ُءا َ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:171)ُ(cid:150)  1  that  the  saints  who,  among  three  hun-
َل(cid:193)ِ(cid:86)اَر ْ(cid:126)ِا يِ(cid:179)َ(cid:92)  ِءاَ(cid:193)ِ(cid:93)ْ(cid:178)َاﯬﯦ يِ(cid:99)َ
dred and ﬁfty million, emerged from the progeny of only two of Muham-
mad’s (UWBP) Family, that is, Hasan (May Allah be pleased with him) and 
Husayn (May Allah be pleased with him), were in the great majority of cases 
the spiritual guides and leaders of the Suﬁ paths of reality. The guides of the 
greater part of the Umma to the way of truth and reality of Islam – foremost 
Ja‘far  al-Sadiq  (May  Allah  be  pleased  with  him),  Gawth  al-A‘zam  (May 
Allah  be  pleased  with  him),  and  Shah  Naqshband  (May  Allah  be  pleased 
with him) – were the fruits of the acceptance of this prayer for Muhammad’s 
(Upon whom be blessings and peace) Family.

Second Aspect

S e c o n d   A s p e c t :  The reason for benedictions of this sort being restricted 
to the prescribed prayers is that they recall to a person that he is on the way 
opened up and taken by the great caravan of the prophets and saints, who 
are  the  most  luminous,  perfect,  and  righteous  of  humankind  and  its  emi-
nent members. The person has joined that vast congregation, which acquires 
strength through its hundredfold consensus and agreement and cannot con-
fuse its way, and is accompanying it on the straight path. By recalling this, 
he is saved from satanic doubts and delusions. Evidence that the members of 
the caravan are the friends and acceptable creatures of the universe’s Owner, 
and its opponents and enemies are rejected, is that from the time of Adam, 
succour has always arrived from the Unseen for the caravan, while its oppo-
nents have been visited by heavenly calamities.

Yes, just as such opponents as the people of Noah, the Thamud and the 
‘Ad,  Pharaoh  and  Nimrod  have  all  received  blows  from  the  Unseen  that 
tell  of  divine  wrath  and  chastisement;  so  the  sacred  heroes  of  the  mighty

be  blessings  and  peace ),  have  wondrously  and  extraordinarily  manifested 
miracles and received dominical bounties from the Unseen. A single blow 
demonstrates  anger,  and  a  single  bestowal,  love,  so  thousands  of  blows 
being visited on opponents and thousands of favours and instances of assist-
ance arriving for the caravan testify and prove self-evidently, as clearly as 
daylight, the rightfulness of the caravan and that it is on the straight path. 
The  verse: > = < ; in  Sura  al-Fatiha  looks  to  the  caravan, 
while  the  verses:  ( 1:7 ) C B A @ ?  looks  to  their 
opponents.  The  point  we  have  explained  here  is  clearer  in  the  discussion 
about the end of Sura al-Fatiha.

Third Aspect

T h i r d  A s p e c t :  The reason for repeatedly asking for something which shall 
certainly be given is this: the thing sought, for instance the Station of Praise 
and Glory is the tip of something. It is a branch of a vast truth that comprises 
lofty and signiﬁcant truths like thousands of Stations of Praise and Glory. 
It is a fruit of the most important result of the universe’s creation. To seek 
through prayer the tip, branch, and fruit is to seek indirectly the realization 
of that vast and general truth, and its ﬁnding existence, and the coming and 
realization of the eternal realm, the largest branch of the tree of creation, and 
the resurrection of the dead and Last Judgement and the opening up of the 
Abode of Bliss, which are the supreme results of the universe. By asking for 
these, one participates in the worship and prayers of all humanity, the most 
important causes of the existence of Paradise and the Abode of Bliss. These 
innumerable prayers are indeed few for an aim so unutterably vast. Moreo-
ver, Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) being awarded the 
Station  of  Praise  and  Glory  points  to  his  supreme  intercession  for  all  his 
community. He is concerned also with the happiness of all his community. It 
is therefore pure wisdom to seek endless benedictions and prayers for mercy 
for him from all his community.

The Supreme Sign 1

An Important Warning
and Statement of Purpose

Not everyone will be able to understand all the matters discussed in this 
most  signiﬁcant  treatise,  but  equally  nobody  will  remain  portionless.  If 
somebody enters a garden, he will ﬁnd that his hands cannot reach all the 
fruit it contains, but the amount that falls within his grasp will be enough for 
him. The garden does not exist for him alone; it exists also for those whose 
arms are longer than his.

There are ﬁve causes making difﬁcult the understanding of this book.
T h e   F i r s t :  I have written down my own observations, according to my 
own  understanding,  and  for  myself.  I  have  not  written  according  to  the 
understanding and conceptions of others, as is the case with other books.

T h e   S e c o n d :  Since the true afﬁrmation of divine unity is set forth in this 
book, in the most comprehensive form, by virtue of a manifestation of the 
supreme name, the subjects discussed are extremely broad, extremely pro-
found and sometimes extremely long. Not everyone can comprehend these 
matters all at once.

T h e   T h i r d :  Since each matter constitutes a great and extensive truth, a 
single sentence will sometimes stretch out over a whole page or more, in 
order not to fracture the truth in question. A single proof requires copious 
preliminaries.

T h e  F o u r t h :  Since most of the matters contained in the book have numer-
ous proofs and evidences, the discussion sometimes becomes prolix through 

1.   This  translation  of  the  Seventh  Ray  was  originally  carried  out  by  Hamid Algar, 
Emeritus Prof. of Middle Eastern Studies in the University of California, Berkeley, USA, 
and was ﬁrst published in 1979. It has been been slightly amended to ﬁt the present work. 

126

the inclusion of ten or twenty proofs by way of demonstration. Limited intel-
ligences cannot understand this.

T h e   F i f t h :  It  is  true  that  the  lights  of  this  treatise  came  to  me  from 
the effulgence of Ramadan. Nonetheless, I was distraught in a number of 
respects, and I wrote the book hastily at a time my body was wracked by 
several illnesses, without revising the ﬁrst draft. I felt, moreover, that I was 
not writing with my own will and volition, and it seemed inappropriate to 
rearrange or correct what I had written, according to my own thoughts. This, 
too, resulted in rendering the book difﬁcult of comprehension. In addition, a 
number of sections in Arabic crept in, and the First Station, written entirely 
in Arabic, was removed and made into a separate work.

Despite  the  defects  and  difﬁculties  arising  from  these  ﬁve  causes,  this 
treatise has such an importance that Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with 
him ) miraculously foresaw its composition and gave it the names “ Supreme 
Sign ” and “ Staff of Moses. ” He looked upon this part of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
with special favour, and directed men’s gaze toward it. 1 The Supreme Sign 
is a true exposition of the Supreme Verse,  2 and it constitutes at the same 
time the Seventh Ray, designated by the Imam as the Staff of Moses.

This treatise consists of an introduction and two stations. The introduc-
tion sets forth four important matters; the First Station contains the Arabic 
portion of the exposition of the Supreme Verse; and the Second Station con-
sists  of  the  translation  of  that  exposition  together  with  the  accompanying 
proofs.

Too much has been explained in the following introduction, but it was 
not my intention to lengthen it thus. The fact that it was written at this length 
indicates the existence of a need. Indeed, some people may regard it as too 
short, despite its length.

S a i d   N u r s i

1.  The events that took place in Denizli fully conﬁrmed the prediction of Imam ‘Ali 
concerning The Supreme Sign. For the secret printing of this book was the cause of our 
imprisonment, and the triumph of its sacred and most powerful truth was the main cause 
of our acquittal and deliverance. Thus did Imam ‘Ali make manifest his miraculous predic-
tion, and prove the acceptance of the prayer he had uttered on our behalf: “ By means of 
the Supreme Sign, secure me against sudden death! ”

THE RAYS

Introduction 

(cid:2)(cid:3)

( 51:56 ) H G F E D C
According to the meaning of this mighty verse, the purpose for the send-
ing of man to this world and the wisdom implicit in it, consists of recogniz-
ing the Creator of all beings and believing in Him and worshipping Him. 
The primordial duty of man and the obligation incumbent upon him are to 
know Allah and believe in Him, to assent to His Being and unity in submis-
sion and perfect certainty.

For man, who by nature desires permanent life and immortal existence, 
whose  unlimited  hopes  are  matched  by  boundless  afﬂictions,  any  object 
or accomplishment other than belief in Allah, knowledge of Allah and the 
means for attaining these, which are the fundament and key of eternal life  –  
any such object or accomplishment must be regarded as lowly for man, or 
even worthless in many cases.

Since this truth has been proven with ﬁrm evidence in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
we refer exposition of it to that, setting forth here, within the framework of 
four questions, only two abysses that shake certainty of faith in this age and 
induce hesitation.

The First Abyss
The First Matter

The means for salvation from the ﬁrst abyss are these two matters:
THE FIRST MATTER: As proven in detail in the Thirteenth Flash of 
the Thirty-First Letter, in general questions denial has no value in the face of 
proof and is extremely weak. For example, with respect to the sighting of the 
crescent moon at the beginning of Ramadan the Noble, if two common men 
prove the crescent to have emerged by their witnessing it, and thousands of 
nobles and scholars deny it, saying: “ We have not seen it, ” their negation is 
valueless and without power to convince. When it is a question of proof each 
person strengthens and supports the other, and consensus results. But when 
it is a question of negation, there is no difference between one man and a 
thousand. Each person remains alone and isolated. For the one who afﬁrms 
looks beyond himself and judges the matter as it is. Thus in the example we 
have given, if one says “ The moon is in the sky, ” and his friend then points 
his ﬁnger at the moon, the two of them unite and are strengthened.

THE SUPREME SIGN – INTRODUCTION

129

The one who engages in negation and denial, however, does not regard 
the matter as it is, and is even unable to do so. For it is a well-known prin-
ciple  that  “ a  non-particularized  denial,  not  directed  to  a  particular  locus, 
cannot be proven. ”

For example, if I afﬁrm the existence of a thing in the world, and you 
deny it, I can easily establish its existence with a single indication. But for 
you  to  justify  your  negation,  that  is  to  establish  the  non-existence  of  the 
thing  –  it is necessary to hunt exhaustively through the whole world, and 
even to examine every aspect of past ages. Only then can you say, “ It does 
not exist, and never has existed. ”

Since  those  who  negate  and  deny  do  not  regard  the  matter  as  it  is  but 
judge rather in the light of their own souls, and their own intelligence and 
vision, they can in no way strengthen and support each other. For the veils 
and causes that prevent them from seeing and knowing are various. Anyone 
can  say,  “ I  do  not  see  it;  therefore,  in  my  opinion  and  belief,  it  does  not 
exist. ” But none can say, “ It does not exist in actuality. ” If someone says 
this  – particularly in questions of belief, which look to all the universe –  it is 
a lie as vast as the world itself, and he who utters it will be incapable both of 
speaking the truth and of being corrected.

I n   S h o r t :  The result is one and single in the case of afﬁrmation, and every 

instance of afﬁrmation supports all other instances.

Negation by contrast is not one, but multiple. Multiplicity arises through 
each person’s saying concerning himself, “ In my opinion and view, ” or “ In 
my belief, ” and leads to multiplicity of result. Hence each separate instance 
cannot support all other instances.

Therefore, with respect to the truth with which we began, there is no sig-
niﬁcance in the multiplicity and apparent predominance of the unbelievers 
and deniers who oppose belief. Now it is necessary to refrain from introduc-
ing any hesitation into the certainty and faith of a believer, but in this age the 
negations and denials of the philosophers of Europe have induced doubt in 
a number of unfortunate dupes and thus destroyed their certainty and oblit-
erated their eternal felicity. Death and the coming of one’s appointed hour, 
which afﬂict thirty thousand men each day, are deprived of their meaning of 
dismissal from this world and presented as eternal annihilation. The grave 
with  its  ever-open  door,  constantly  threatens  the  denier  with  annihilation 
and poisons his life with the bitterest of sorrows. Appreciate then how great 
a blessing is faith, and the very essence of life.

The Second Matter

130

THE RAYS

THE SECOND MATTER: With respect to a problem subject to discus-
sion in a science or art, those who stand outside that science or art cannot 
speak  authoritatively,  however  great,  learned  and  accomplished  they  may 
be, nor can their judgements be accepted as decisive. They cannot form part 
of the learned consensus of the science.

For example, the judgement of a great engineer on the diagnosis and 
cure of a disease does not have the same value as that of the lowliest phy-
sician. In particular, the words of denial of a philosopher who is absorbed 
in  the  material  sphere,  who  becomes  continually  more  remote  from  the 
non-material or spiritual and cruder and more insensitive to light, whose 
intelligence is restricted to what his eye beholds  –  the words of such a one 
are unworthy of consideration and valueless with respect to non-material 
and spiritual matters.

On matters sacred and spiritual and concerning the divine unity, there is 
total accord among the hundreds of thousands of the people of truth, such as 
Shaykh Gilani ( May his mystery be sanctiﬁed ), who beheld Allah’s sublime 
throne while still on the earth, who spent ninety years advancing in spiritual 
work, and who had unveiled to him the truths of belief in all three stations 
of certainty. This being the case what value have the words of philosophers, 
who through their absorption in the most diffuse details of the material realm 
and the most minute aspects of multiplicity are choking and dazed? Are not 
their denials and objections drowned out like the buzzing of a mosquito by 
the roaring of thunder?

The essence of the unbelief that opposes the truths of Islam and strug-
gles against them is denial, ignorance, and negation. Even though in outer 
form it may appear to be an afﬁrmation of some kind and a manifestation of 
being, it is in reality negation and non-being. Whereas belief is knowledge 
and a manifestation of being; it is afﬁrmation and judgement. Even a negat-
ing aspect of belief is the gate to a positive truth or the veil covering it. If the 
unbelievers who struggle against faith attempt, with the utmost difﬁculty, 
to  afﬁrm  and  accept  their  negative  beliefs  in  the  form  of  acceptance  and 
admission of non-being, then their unbelief may be regarded as a form of 
mistaken knowledge or erroneous judgement in one respect. But as for non-
acceptance, denial, and non-admission – something more easily done – it is 
absolute ignorance and total absence of judgement.

I n   S h o r t :  The convictions underlying unbelief are then of two kinds:
The First pays no regard to the truths of Islam. It is an erroneous admis-
sion, a baseless belief and a mistaken acceptance peculiar to itself; it is an 

THE SUPREME SIGN – INTRODUCTION

131

unjust judgement. This kind of unbelief is beyond the scope of our discus-
sion. It has no concern with us, nor do we have any concern with it.

The  Second  Kind opposes  the  truths  of  belief  and  struggles  against 

them. It consists in turn of two varieties.

T h e   F i r s t  is non-acceptance. It consists simply of not consenting to afﬁr-
mation. This is a species of ignorance; there is no judgement involved and it 
occurs easily. It too is beyond the scope of our discussion.

T h e   S e c o n d  variety is acceptance of non-being. It is to consent to non-
being with one’s heart, and a judgement is involved. It is a conviction and 
a  taking  the  part  of  something.  It  is  on  account  of  this  partiality  that  it  is 
obliged to afﬁrm its negation.

The negation comprises two types:
The First Type says: “ A certain thing does not exist at a certain place 
or in a particular direction. ” This kind of denial can be proved, and it lies 
outside of our discussion.

The Second Type consists of negating and denying those doctrinal and 
sacred  matters,  general  and  comprehensive,  that  concern  this  world,  all 
beings, the hereafter, and the succession of different ages. This kind of nega-
tion cannot in any fashion be substantiated, as we have shown in the First 
Matter,  for  what  is  needed  to  substantiate  such  negations  is  a  vision  that 
shall encompass the whole universe, behold the hereafter, and observe every 
aspect of time without limit.

The Second Abyss

The Second Abyss and the means for escaping from it: This too con-

sists of two matters.

The First

T h e   F i r s t :  Intelligences that become narrowed by absorption in neglect 
of Allah and in sin, or the material realm, are unable to comprehend vast 
matters in respect of sublimity, grandeur, and inﬁnity; hence taking pride in 
such knowledge as they have, they hasten to denial and negation. Since they 
cannot encompass the extremely vast, profound and comprehensive ques-
tions of faith within their straitened and dessicated intellects, their corrupt 
and spiritually moribund hearts, they cast themselves into unbelief and mis-
guidance, and choke.

If they were able to look at the true nature of their unbelief and the essence 
of their misguidance they would see that, compared to the reasonable, suit-
able and indeed necessary sublimity and grandeur that is present in belief, 
their unbelief conceals and contains manifold absurdity and impossibility. 
The R i s a l e - i   N u r  has proven this truth by hundreds of comparisons with the 
same ﬁnality that two plus two equals four. For example, one who does not 

132

THE RAYS

accept the Necessary Being, the pre-eternity, and the comprehensiveness of 
attribute of Allah Almighty, on account of their grandeur and sublimity, may 
form a creed of unbelief by assigning that necessary being, pre-eternity, and 
the attributes of Godhead to an unlimited number of beings, an inﬁnity of 
atoms. Or like the foolish Sophists, he can abdicate his intelligence by deny-
ing and negating both his own existence and that of the universe.

Thus, all the truths of belief and Islam, basing their matters on the gran-
deur and sublimity which are their requirement, deliver themselves from the 
awesome  absurdities,  the  fearsome  superstitions,  and  the  tenebrous  igno-
rance of unbelief that confront them, and take up their place in sound hearts 
and straight intellects, through utmost submission and assent.

The constant proclamation of this grandeur and sublimity in the call to

[ This  Second  Station,  in  addition  to  explaining  the  above  sublime 
verse, sets out the proofs, arguments, and meaning of the First Station, 
which has been skipped. ]

1. Degree: Heavens and all They Contain {1}

Since this sublime verse, like many other Qur’anic verses, mentions ﬁrst 
the heavens  – that brilliant page proclaiming Allah’s unity, gazed on at all 
times  and  by  all  men  with  wonder  and  joy –   in  its  pronouncement  of  the 
Creator of this cosmos, let us too begin with a mention of the heavens.

Indeed, every voyager who comes to the hospice and the realm of this 
world, opens his eyes and wonders who is the master of this ﬁne hospice, 
which resembles a most generous banquet, a most ingenious exhibition, a 
most impressive camp and training ground, a most amazing and wondrous 
place of recreation, a most profound and wise place of instruction. He asks 
himself too who is the author of this great book, and who is the monarch of 
this lofty realm. There ﬁrst presents itself to him the beautiful face of the 
heavens, inscribed with the gilt lettering of the stars. That face calls him say-
ing, “ Look at me, and I shall guide you to what you seek. ”

He looks then and sees a manifestation of dominicality performing vari-
ous tasks in the heavens: it holds aloft in the heavens, without any support-
ing pillar, hundreds of thousands of heavenly bodies, some of which are 
a thousand times heavier than the earth and revolve seventy times faster 

133

134

THE RAYS

than a cannon-ball; it causes them to move in harmony and swiftly without 
colliding with each other; it causes innumerable lamps to burn constantly, 
without the use of any oil; it disposes of these great masses without any 
disturbance or disorder; it sets sun and moon to work at their respective 
tasks, without those great bodies ever rebelling; it administers within inﬁ-
nite space  – the magnitude of which cannot be measured in ﬁgures should 
they stretch from pole to pole –  all that exists, at the same time, with the 
same strength, in the same fashion, manner and mould, without the least 
deﬁciency; it reduces to submissive obedience to its law all the aggressive 
powers inherent in those bodies; it cleanses and lustrates the face of the 
heavens, removing all the sweepings and refuse of that vast assembly; it 
causes those bodies to manoeuvre like a disciplined army; and then, mak-
ing the earth revolve, it shows the heavens each night and each year in a 
different form, like a cinema screen displaying true and imaginative scenes 
to the audience of creation.

There is within this dominical activity a truth consisting of subjugation, 
administration, revolution, ordering, cleansing, and employment. This truth, 
with  its  grandeur  and  comprehensiveness,  bears  witness  to  the  necessary 
existence and unity of the Creator of the Heavens and testiﬁes to that Exist-
ence being more manifest than that of the heavens. Hence it was said in the 
First Degree of the First Station:

Then  that  wondrous  place  of  gathering  known  as  space  or  the  atmos-
phere begins thunderously to proclaim to that traveller come as a guest to 
the world, “ Look at me! You can discover and ﬁnd through me the object 
of your search, the one who sent you here! ” The traveller looks at the sour 
but kind face of the atmosphere, and listening to the awesome but joyous 
thunderclaps perceives the following.

The clouds, suspended between the sky and the earth, water the garden 
of the world in the most wise and merciful fashion, furnish the inhabitants 
of the earth with the water of life, modify the natural heat of life, and hasten 
to bestow aid wherever it is needed. In addition to fulﬁlling these and other 
duties, the vast clouds, capable of ﬁlling the heavens sometimes hide them-
selves, with their parts retiring to rest so that not a trace can be seen, just 

ٰ
THE SUPREME SIGN – FIRST CHAPTER

like a well-disciplined army showing and hiding itself in accordance with 
sudden orders.

Then,  the  very  instant  the  command  is  given  to  pour  down  rain,  the 
clouds gather in one hour, or rather in a few minutes; they ﬁll the sky and 
await further orders from their commander.

Next the traveller looks at the wind in the atmosphere and sees that the 
air is employed wisely and generously in such numerous tasks that it is as if 
each of the inanimate atoms of that unconscious air were hearing and noting 
the  orders  coming  from  that  monarch  of  the  universe;  without  neglecting 
a single one of them, it performs them in ordered fashion and through the 
power of the monarch. Thereby it gives breath to all beings and conveys to 
all living things the heat, light, and electricty they need, and transmits sound, 
as well as aiding in the pollination of plants.

The traveller then looks at the rain and sees that within those delicate, 
glistening sweet drops, sent from a hidden treasury of mercy, there are so 
many compassionate gifts and functions contained that it is as if mercy itself 
were assuming shape and ﬂowing forth from the dominical treasury in the 
form of drops. It is for this reason that rain has been called “ mercy. ”

Next the traveller looks at the lightning and listens to the thunder and ses 

that both of these, too, are employed in wondrous tasks.

Then  taking  his  eyes  off  these,  he  looks  to  his  own  intellect  and  says: 
“ The inanimate, lifeless cloud that resembles carded cotton has of course no 
knowledge of us; when it comes to our aid, it is not because it takes pity on 
us. It cannot appear and disappear without receiving orders. Rather it acts 
in accordance with the orders of a most powerful and compassionate com-
mander. First it diasppears without leaving a trace, then suddenly reappears 
in order to begin its work. By the command and power of a most active and 
exalted, a most magniﬁcent and splendid, monarch, it ﬁlls and then empties 
the atmosphere. Inscribing the sky with wisdom and erasing the pattern, it 
makes of the sky a tablet of effacement and afﬁrmation, a depiction of the 
gathering  and  the  resurrection.  By  the  contriving  of  a  most  generous  and 
bountiful, a most muniﬁcent and solicitous sustainer, a ruler who regulates 
and disposes, it mounts the wind and taking with it treasuries of rain each as 
heavy as a mountain, hastens to the aid of the needy. It is as if it were weep-
ing over them in pity, with its tears causing the ﬂowers to smile, tempering 
the heat of the sun, spraying gardens with water, and washing and cleansing 
the face of the earth. ”

136

THE RAYS

That wondering traveller then tells his own intellect: “ These hundreds 
of thousands of wise, merciful and ingenious tasks and acts of generosity 
and mercy that arise from the veil and outer form of this inanimate, life-
less, unconscious, volatile, unstable, stormy, unsettled, and inconstant air, 
clearly  establish  that  this  diligent  wind,  this  tireless  servant,  never  acts 
of itself, but rather in accordance with the orders of a most powerful and 
knowing, a most wise and generous commander. It is as if each particle 
were aware of every single task, like a soldier understanding and hearken-
ing to every order of its commander, for it hears and obeys every domini-
cal  command  that  courses  through  the  air.  It  aids  all  animals  to  breathe 
and to live, all plants to pollinate and grow, and cultivates all the matter 
necessary for their survival. It directs and administers the clouds, makes 
possible the voyaging of sailing ships, and enables sounds to be conveyed, 
particularly by means of wireless, telephone, telegraph and radio, as well 
as numerous other universal functions.

“ Now  these  atoms,  each  composed  of  two  such  simple  materials  as 
hydrogen and oxygen and each resembling the other, exist in hundreds of 
thousands of different fashions all over the globe; I conclude therefore that 
they are being employed and set to work in the utmost orderliness by a hand 
of wisdom.

“ As the verse makes clear,

H G F E D C B
( 2:164 ) K J I 
the one who through the disposition of the winds employs them in countless 
dominical functions, who through the ordering of the clouds uses them in 
inﬁnite tasks of mercy, and who creates the air in this fashion - such a one 
can only be the Possessor of Necessary Existence, the One Empowered over 
All Things and Knowledgeable of All Things, the Sustainer endowed with 
Glory and Generosity. ” This is the conclusion our traveller now draws.

Then he looks at the rain and sees that within it are contained beneﬁts as 
numerous as the raindrops, and dominical manifestations as multiple as the 
particles of rain, and instances of wisdom as plentiful as its atoms. Those 
sweet, delicate and blessed drops are moreover created in so beautiful and 
ordered a fashion, that particularly the rain sent in the summertime, is des-
patched and caused to fall with such balance and regularity that not even 
stormy winds that cause large objects to collide can destroy its equilibrium 

THE SUPREME SIGN – FIRST CHAPTER

137

and order; the drops do not collide with each other or merge in such fash-
ion as to become harmful masses of water. Water, composed of two simple 
elements like hydrogen and oxygen, is employed in hundreds of thousands 
of  other  wise,  purposeful  tasks  and  arts,  particularly  in  animate  beings; 
although it is itself inanimate and unconscious. Rain which is then the very 
embodiment of divine mercy can only be manufactured in the unseen treas-
ury of mercy of One Most Compassionate and Merciful, and on its descent 
expounds in physical form the verse:

( 42:28 )   ﴾ ¶ μ ´ ³ ² ± ° ¯ ® ¬
The traveller next listens to the thunder and watches the lightning. He 
understands  that  these  two  wondrous  events  in  the  atmosphere  are  like  a 
material demonstration of the verse,

( 24:43 )  ì ë ê é è  ( 13:13 )  Æ Å Ä
They  also  announce  the  coming  of  rain,  and  thus  give  glad  tidings  to  the 
needy.

Yes, this sudden utterance of a miraculous sound by the atmosphere; the 
ﬁlling of the dark sky with the ﬂash and ﬁre of lightning; the setting alight 
of the clouds that resemble mountains of cotton or pipes bursting with water 
and snow  –  these and similar phenomena are like a blow struck on the head 
of the negligent man whose gaze is directed down at the earth. They tell him:
“ Lift up your head, look at the miraculous deeds of the most active and 
powerful being who wishes to make himself known. In the same way that 
you are not left to your own devices, so too, these phenomena and events 
have a master and a purpose. Each of them is caused to fulﬁl a particular 
task, and each is employed by a Most Wise Disposer. ”

The  wondering  traveller  hears  then  the  lofty  and  manifest  testimony 
to the truth that is composed of the disposition of the winds, the descent 
of  the  rains  and  the  administration  of  the  events  of  the  atmosphere,  and 
says: “ I believe in Allah. ” That which was stated in the Second Degree of 
the First Station expresses the observations of the traveller concerning the 
atmosphere:

Next the globe addresses that thoughtful traveller, now growing accus-

tomed to his reﬂective journey:

“ Why  are  you  wandering  through  the  heavens,  through  space  and  the 
sky? Come, I will make known to you what you are seeking. Look at the 
functions  that  I  perform  and  read  my  pages! ”  He  looks  and  sees  that  the 
globe, like an ecstatic Mevlevi dervish with its twofold motion, is tracing out 
around the ﬁeld of the Supreme Gathering a circle that determines the suc-
cession of days, years, and seasons. It is a most magniﬁcent dominical ship, 
loaded with the hundreds of thousands of different forms of food and equip-
ment needed for all animate beings, ﬂoating with the utmost equilibrium in 
the ocean of space and circling the sun.

He then looks at the pages of the earth and sees that each page of each 
of its chapters proclaims the Sustainer of the Earth in thousands of verses. 
Being unable to read the whole of it, he looks at the page dealing with the 
creation and deployment of animate beings in the spring, and observes the 
following:

The forms of the countless members of hundreds of thousands of spe-
cies emerge, in the utmost precision, from a simple material and are then 
nurtured in most merciful fashion. Then, in miraculous manner, wings are 
given to some of the seeds; they take to ﬂight and are thus dispersed. They 
are most effectively distributed, most carefully fed and nurtured. Countless 
tasty and delicious forms of food, in the most merciful and tender fashion, 
are brought forth from dry clay, and from roots, seeds and drops of liquid 
that differ little among each other. Every spring, a hundred thousand kinds 
of food and equipment are loaded on it from an unseen treasury, as if onto a 
railway waggon, and are despatched in utmost orderliness to animate beings. 
The sending to infants of canned milk in those food packages, and pumps of 
sugared milk in the form of their mothers’ affectionate breasts, is in particu-
lar such an instance of solicitousness, mercy and wisdom that it immediately 
establishes itself as a most tender manifestation of the mercy and generosity 
of the Merciful and Compassionate One.

I n  S h o r t :  this living page of spring displays a hundred thousand examples 
and samples of the Supreme Gathering, and is a tangible demonstration of 
this verse,

Moreover, this verse may be said to express in miraculous fashion the 
meanings of the page that is spring. The traveller thus understood that the 
earth proclaims through all its pages, in fashion proportionate to their size:

4. Degree: The Seas and Rivers {4}

Then that reﬂective traveller read each page of the cosmos, and as he did 
so his faith, that key to felicity, strengthened; his gnosis, that key to spiritual 
progress, increased; his belief in Allah, the source and foundation of all per-
fection,  developed  one  degree  more;  his  joy  and  pleasure  augmented  and 
aroused his eagerness; and while listening to the perfect and convincing les-
sons given by the sky, by space and the earth, he cried out for more. Then he 
heard the rapturous invocation of Allah made by the tumult of the seas and 
the great rivers, and listened to their sad yet pleasant sounds. In numerous 
ways they were saying to him: “ Look at us, read also our signs! ” Looking, 
our traveller saw the following:

The seas, constantly and vitally surging, merging and pouring forth with 
an  inclination  to  conquest  inherent  in  their  very  nature,  surrounded  the 
earth, and together with the earth, revolved, extremely swiftly, in a circle of 
twenty-ﬁve thousand years in a single year. Yet the seas did not disperse, did 
not overﬂow or encroach on the land contiguous to them. They moved and 
stood still, and were protected by the command and power of a most power-
ful and magniﬁcent being.

Then looking to the depths of the sea, the traveller saw that apart from 
the most beautiful, well- adorned and symmetrical jewels, there were thou-
sands of different kinds of animal, sustained and ordered, brought to life and 
caused to die, in so disciplined a fashion, their provision coming from mere 

1.  A phrase repeated many times in the Qur’an.

ٰ
140

THE RAYS

sand and salt water, that it established irresistibly the existence of a Power-
ful and Glorious, a Merciful and Beauteous Being administering and giving 
life to them.

The traveller then looks at the rivers and sees that the beneﬁts inherent 
in them, the functions they perform, and their continual replenishment, are 
inspired  by  such  wisdom  and  mercy  as  indisputably  to  prove  that  all  riv-
ers,  springs,  streams  and  great  waterways  ﬂow  forth  from  the  treasury  of 
mercy of the Compassionate One, the Lord of Glory and Generosity. They 
are preserved and dispensed, indeed, in so extraordinary a fashion that it is 
said “   F o u r   r i v e r s   ﬂ o w   f o r t h   f r o m   P a r a d i s e .   ”  1 That is, they transcend by far 
apparent causes, and ﬂow forth instead from the treasury of a non-material 
Paradise, from the superabundance of an unseen and inexhaustible source.

For example, the blessed Nile, that turns the sandy land of Egypt into a 
paradise, ﬂows from the Mountains of the Moon in the south without ever 
being  exhausted,  as  if  it  were  a  small  sea.  If  the  water  that  ﬂowed  down 
the  river  in  six  months  were  gathered  together  in  the  form  of  a  mountain 
and then frozen, it would be larger than those mountains. But the place in 
the mountains where the water is lodged and stored is less than a sixth of 
their mass. As for the water that replenishes the river, the rain that enters 
the reservoir of the river is very sparse in that torrid region and is quickly 
swallowed  up  by  the  thirsty  soil;  hence  it  is  incapable  of  maintaining  the 
equilibrium of the river. A tradition has thus grown up that the blessed Nile 
springs, in miraculous fashion, from an unseen Paradise. This tradition has 
profound meaning and expresses a beautiful truth.

The traveller saw, then, a thousandth part of the truths and afﬁrmations 
contained in the oceans and rivers. The seas proclaim unanimously with a 
power proportionate to their extent, َوُ(cid:182)  َ
َ(cid:202) and produce as witnesses to 
their testimony all the creatures that inhabit them. This, our traveller pre-
ceived.

Then the traveller is summoned, on his meditative journey, by the moun-
tains and the plains. “ Read too our pages, ” they say. Looking he sees that 
the universal function and duty of mountains is of such grandeur and wis-
dom  as  to  stupefy  the  intelligence.  The  mountains  emerge  from  the  earth 
by  the  command  of  their  Sustainer,  thereby  palliating  the  turmoil,  anger, 
and rancour that arise from disturbances within the earth. As the mountains 
surge upward, the earth begins to breathe; it is delivered from harmful trem-
ors and upheavals, and its tranquillity as it pursues its duty of rotation is no 
longer disturbed. In the same way that masts are planted in ships to protect 
them from turbulence and preserve their balance, so too mountains are set up 
on the deck of the ship that is the earth, as masts and stores, as is indicated 
by verses of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition such as these:

( 79:32 ) v u  ( 15:19 )  ; : 9   ( 78:7 ) : 9 
Then, too, there are stored up and preserved in the mountains all kinds of 
springs, waters, minerals and other materials needed by animate beings, in 
so wise, skilful, generous and foreseeing a fashion that they prove that they 
are the storehouses and warehouses and servants of One possessing inﬁnite 
power, One possessing inﬁnite wisdom. Deducing from these two examples 
the  other  duties  and  instances  of  wisdom   – as  great  as  mountains –   of  the 
mountains and plains, the traveller sees through the general instances of wis-
dom in them and particularly in regard to the fashion in which all manner of 
things are stored up in them providentially, the testimony they give and the 
divine unity they proclaim declaring َوُ(cid:182)  َ
َ(cid:202)  – a declaration as powerful 
and ﬁrm as the mountains and vast and expansive as the plains –  and he too 
says, “ I believe in Allah. ”

6. Degree: Trees and Plants {6}

Then, while that traveller was travelling in his mind through the moun-
tains and plains, the gate to the arboreal and vegetable realm was opened 
before  him.  He  was  summoned  inside:  “ Come, ”  they  said,  “ Inspect  our

realm and read our incriptions. ” Entering, he saw that a splendid and well- 
adorned assembly for the proclamation of Allah’s unity and a circle for the 
mentioning of His names and the offering of thanks to Him, had been drawn 
up. He understood for the very appearance of all trees and plants that their 
different species were proclaiming unanimously, َوُ(cid:182)  َ
َ(cid:202) For he perceived 
three  great  and  general  truths  indicating  and  proving  that  all  fruit-giving 
trees and plants with the tongue of their symmetrical and eloquent leaves, 
the  phrases  of  their  charming  and  loquacious  ﬂowers,  the  words  of  their 
well-ordered and well- spoken fruits, were testifying to Allah’s glory and 
bearing witness that َوُ(cid:182)  َ

ّ(cid:202)ِإ َهٰ(cid:170)ِإ  ٓ

T h e   F i r s t :  In the same way that in each of the plants and trees a deliber-
ate bounty and generosity is to be seen in most obvious fashion, and a pur-
posive liberality and muniﬁcence, so too it is to be seen in the totality of the 
trees and plants, with the brilliance of sunlight.

ّ(cid:202)ِإ َهٰ(cid:170)ِإ  ٓ
َ(cid:202)

T h e   S e c o n d :  The wise and purposive distinction and differentiation, one 
that cannot in any way be attributed to chance, the deliberate and merciful 
adornment and giving of form  –  all this is to be seen as clearly as daylight in 
the inﬁnite varieties and species; they show themselves to be the works and 
embroideries of an All-Wise Maker.

T h e   T h i r d :  The  opening  and  unfolding  of  all  the  separate  members  of 
the hundred thousand species of that inﬁnite realm, each in its own distinct 
fashion and shape, in the utmost order, equilibrium and beauty, from well-
deﬁned, limited, simple and solid seeds and grains, identical to each other 
or nearly so  –  their emerging from those seeds in distinct and separate form, 
with utter equilibrium, vitality and wise purpose without the least error or 
mistake, is a truth more brilliant than the sun. The witnesses proving this 
truth  are  as  numerous  as  the  ﬂowers,  fruits  and  leaves  that  emerge  in  the 
ْ(cid:202)ا ِةـ َ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:151)ِ(cid:178) ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) ِ

7. Degree: The Animal ans Bird Realms {7}

As this traveller through the cosmos proceeded on his meditative jour-
ney, with increased eagerness and a bouquet of gnosis and faith, itself like a 
spring, gathered from the garden of the spring, there opened before his truth-
perceiving  intellect,  his  cognitive  reason,  the  gate  to  the  animal  and  bird 
realm. With hundreds of thousands of different voices and various tongues, 
he was invited to enter. Entering, he saw that all the animals and birds, in 
their different species, groups and nations, were proclaiming, silently and 
aloud, َوُ(cid:182)  َ
َ(cid:202) and had thus turned the face of the earth into a vast place 
of invocation, an expansive assembly for the proclamation of Allah’s glory. 
He saw each of them to be like an ode dedicated to Allah, a word proclaim-
ing  His  glory,  a  letter  indicating  His  mercy,  each  of  them  describing  the 
Maker and offering Him thanks and encomium. It was as if the senses, pow-
ers, members and instruments of those animals and birds were orderly and 
balanced words, or perfect and disciplined expressions. He observed three 
great and comprehensive truths indicating, in decisive form, their offering of 
thanks to the Creator and Provider and their testimony to His unity.

ّ(cid:202)ِإ َهٰ(cid:170)ِإ  ٓ

T h e   F i r s t :  Their being brought into existence with wisdom and purpose 
and their creation full of art in a fashion that in no way can be attributed to 
chance, to blind force or inanimate nature; their being created and composed 
in purposive and knowledgeable manner; their animation and being given 
life in a way that displays in twenty aspects the manifestation of knowledge, 
wisdom, and will  –  all of this is a truth that bears witness to the Necessary 
Existence of the Eternally Living and Self-Subsistent, His seven attributes 
and unity, a witness repeated to the number of all animate beings.

T h e   S e c o n d :  There appears from the distinction made among those inﬁ-
nite beings and from their adornment and decoration in a fashion by which 
their features are different, their shapes adorned, their proportions measured 
and symmetrical, and their forms well-ordered  –  there appears from this a 
truth so vast and powerful that none other than the One Powerful over all 
things, the One Knowledgeable of all things, could lay claim to it, this com-
prehensive  act  which  displays  in  every  respect  thousands  of  wonders  and 

144

THE RAYS

instances of wisdom; it is impossible and precluded that anything other than 
such a one could lay claim to it.

T h e   T h i r d :  The emergence and unfolding of those countless creatures, in 
their hundreds of thousands of different shapes and forms, each of which is 
a miracle of wisdom, their emergence from eggs and drops of water called 
sperm that are identical with each other or closely resemble each other, and 
are limited and ﬁnite in number, all this in the most orderly, symmetrical and 
unfailing fashion, is so brilliant a truth as to be illumined with proofs and 
evidences as numerous as the animals themselves.

ّ(cid:202)ِإ َهٰ(cid:170)ِإ  ٓ

By  the  consensus  of  these  three  truths,  all  the  species  of  animals  are 
engaged together in testifying that َوُ(cid:182)  َ
ّ(cid:202)ِإ َهٰ(cid:170)ِإ  ٓ
َ(cid:202) It is as if the whole earth, like 
a great man, were saying َوُ(cid:182)  َ
َ(cid:202) in a manner beﬁtting its vastness, and 
conveying  its  testimony  to  the  dwellers  of  the  heaven.  The  traveller  saw 
this and understood it perfectly. In expression of these truths, we said in the

That meditative voyager, in order to advance farther in the inﬁnite degrees 
and countless luminous stages of knowledge of Allah, then wished to enter 
the world of men, the realm of humanity. Humanity, headed by the prophets, 
invited him, and he accepted the invitation. Looking ﬁrst at the stopping-
place of the past, he saw that all of the prophets ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ), the most luminous and perfect of human kind, were reciting in 
chorus,  َوُ(cid:182)  َ
َ(cid:202) and making remembrance of Allah. With the power of 
their brilliant, well- attested and innumerable miracles, they were proclaim-
ing  Allah’s  unity,  and  in  order  to  advance  man  from  the  animal  state  to 

ّ(cid:202)ِإ َهٰ(cid:170)ِإ  ٓ

ٰ
THE SUPREME SIGN – FIRST CHAPTER

145

angelic degree, they were instructing men and summoning them to belief in 
Allah. Kneeling down in that school of light, he too paid heed to the lesson.
He saw that in the hand of each of those teachers, the most exalted and 
renowned  of  all  celebrated  human  beings,  there  were  numerous  miracles, 
bestowed  on  them  by  the  Creator  of  All  Being  as  a  sign  conﬁrming  their 
mission. Further, a large group of men, a whole community, had conﬁrmed 
their claims and come to belief at their hands; a truth assented to and con-
ﬁrmed by these hundreds of thousands of serious and veracious individu-
als, unanimously and in full agreement, was bound to be ﬁrm and deﬁni-
tive. He understood, too, that the people of misguidance, in denying a truth 
attested and afﬁrmed by so many veracious witnesses, were committing a 
most grievous error, indeed crime, and were therefore deserving of a most 
grievous punishment. He recognized, by contrast, those who assented to the 
truth and believed in it, as being the most true and righteous, and a further 
degree of the sanctity of belief became apparent to him.

Yes,  the  inﬁnite  miracles  bestowed  by  Allah  on  the  prophets  ( Upon 
whom  be  peace )  each  one  being  like  a  conﬁrmation  of  their  mission;  the 
heavenly  blows  dealt  to  their  opponents,  each  being  like  a  proof  of  their 
truthfulness; their individual perfections, each one being like an indication 
of their righteousness; their veracious teachings; the strength of their faith, 
a witness to their honesty; their supreme seriousness and readiness to self-
sacriﬁce;  the  sacred  books  and  pages  held  by  their  hands;  their  countless 
pupils who through following their paths attain truth, perfection and light, 
thus proving again the truthfulness of the teachings; the unanimous agree-
ment of the prophets  – those most earnest warners –  and their followers in 
all positive matters; their concord, mutual support and afﬁnity  –  all of this 
constitutes so powerful a proof that no power on earth can confront it, and 
no doubt or hesitation can survive it.

Our traveller understood further that inclusion of belief in all the prophets 
( Upon whom be peace ) among the pillars of belief, represents another great 
source of strength. Thus he derived great beneﬁt of faith from their lessons, 
in expression of which we said in the Eighth Degree of the First Station:

the prophets ( Upon whom be peace ) to the classroom of those profound, 
original,  exacting  scholars  who  afﬁrm  the  claims  of  the  prophets  ( Upon 
whom be peace ) with the most decisive and powerful proofs and who are 
known as the puriﬁed and most veracious ones.

Entering  their  classroom,  he  saw  thousands  of  geniuses  and  hundreds 
of thousands of exact and exalted scholars proving all the realized matters 
connected with faith, headed by the necessity of Allah’s existence and His 
unity, with such profound demonstrations as to leave not the least room for 
doubt. Indeed, the fact that they are agreed in the principles and pillars of 
belief,  despite  their  differences  in  capacity  and  outlook,  and  that  each  of 
them relies on a ﬁrm and certitudinous proof, is in itself such evidence that 
it can be doubted only if it is possible for a similar number of intelligent and 
perspicuous men to arrive at a single result. Otherwise the only way for the 
denier to oppose them is to display his ignorance  – his utter ignorance –  and 
his obstinacy with respect to negative matters that admit neither of denial 
nor afﬁrmation. He will in effect be closing his eyes but the one who closes 
his eyes is able to turn day into night only for himself.

The traveller learned that the lights emitted in this vast and magniﬁcent 
classroom  by  these  respected  and  profound  scholars  had  been  illumining 
half of the globe for more than a thousand years. He found in it moral and 
spiritual force that the combined strength of all the people of denial would 
be unable to shake or destroy. In brief allusion to the lesson learned by the 
traveller in this classroom we said in the Ninth Degree of the First Station:

10. Degree: Spiritual Guides and Their Agreement {10}

Our  contemplative  traveller  came  forth  from  the  classroom,  ardently 
desiring to see the lights that are to be observed in the continuous strength-
ening  and  development  of  faith,  and  in  advancing  from  the  degree  of  the 
knowledge  of  certainty  to  that  of  the  vision  of  certainty.  He  then  found 
himself summoned by thousands or millions of spiritual guides who were 
striving toward the truth and attaining the vision of certainty in the shade 
of the highway of Muhammad ( UWBP ) and the ascension of Muhammad 
( UWBP ). This they were doing in a meeting-place, a hospice, a place of 
remembrance and preceptorship, that was abundantly luminous and vast as 
a  plain,  being  formed  from  the  merging  of  countless  small  hospices  and 
convents.  Upon  entering,  he  found  that  those  spiritual  guides   – people  of

unveiling and wondrous deeds –  were unanimously proclaiming, َوُ(cid:182)  َ
ّ(cid:202)ِإ َهٰ(cid:170)ِإ  ٓ
َ(cid:202) 
on the basis of their witnessing and unveiling of the Unseen and the won-
drous deeds they had been enabled to perform; they were proclaiming the 
necessary existence and unity of Allah. The traveller observed how manifest 
and clear must be a truth to which unanimously subscribe these sacred gen-
iuses and luminous gnostics. For, like the sun is known through the seven 
colours in its light, the saints’ luminous colours, their light-ﬁlled hues, their 
true  paths  and  right  ways  and  veracious  courses  are  manifested  from  the 
light of the Pre-Eternal Sun through seventy colours, indeed, through col-
ours to the number of the divine names, and are all different. He saw that 
the  unanimity  of  the  prophets  and  the  agreement  of  the  puriﬁed  scholars 
and accord of the saints forms a supreme consensus, more brilliant than the 
daylight that demonstrates the existence of the sun.

In brief allusion to the beneﬁt derived by our traveller from the Suﬁ hos-

Now our traveller through the world, aware that the most important and 
greatest of all human perfections, indeed the very source and origin of all 
such  perfections,  is  the  love  of  Allah  that  arises  from  belief  in  Allah  and 
the knowledge of Allah, wished with all of his powers, outer and inner, to 
advance still farther in the strengthening of his faith and the development of 
his knowledge. He therefore raised his head and gazing at the heavens said 
to himself:

“ The most precious thing in the universe is life; all things are made sub-
ordinate to life. The most precious of all living beings is the animate, and 
the most precious of the animate is the conscious. Each century and each 
year, the globe is engaged in emptying and reﬁlling itself, in order to aug-
ment this most precious substance. It follows, then, without doubt, that the 
magniﬁcent and ornate heavens must have appropriate people and inhabit-
ants, possessing life, spirit and consciousness, for events relating to seeing 
and  speaking  with  the  angels   – such  as  the  appearance  of  Gabriel  ( Upon 
whom be peace ) in the presence of Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ) and in the view of the Companions –  have been transmitted and 
related from the most ancient times. Would, then, that I could converse with 

ٰ

the inhabitants of the heavens, and learn their thoughts on this matter. For 
their words concerning the Creator of the cosmos are the most important. ”

As he was thus thinking to himself, he suddenly heard a heavenly voice: 
“ If you wish to meet us and hearken to our lesson, then know that before all 
others we have believed in the articles of faith brought by means of us to the 
prophets, headed by the Prophet Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ), who brought the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition.

“ Then too all of the pure spirits from among us that have appeared before 
men have, unanimously and without exception, born witness to the neces-
sary existence, the unity, and the sacred attributes of the Creator of this cos-
mos, and proclaimed this with one accord. The afﬁnity and mutual corre-
spondence of these countless proclamations is a guide for you as bright as 
the sun. ” Thus the traveller’s light of faith shone, and rose from the earth to 
the heavens.

12-13. Degrees: Upright Intellects and Sound Hearts {12}

Then,  that  ardent  and  inquisitive  traveller,  having  learned  from  the 
tongues of various realms of creation in the Manifest Realm in their mate-
rial and corporeal aspects, and from the utterance of their modes of being, 
desired to study and journey through the World of the Unseen and the Inter-
mediate Realm, and thus to investigate reality. There opened to him the gate 
of upright and luminous intellects, of sound and illumined hearts, that are 
like the seed of man, who is the fruit of the universe, and despite their slight 
girth can expand virtually to embrace the whole of the cosmos.

He looked and saw a series of human isthmuses linking the realm of the 
Unseen with that of the Manifest, and the contacts between those two realms 
and the interchanges between them insofar as they affect man, taking place 
at those points. Addressing his intellect and his heart he said:

“ Come,  the  path  leading  to  truth  from  these  counterparts  of  yours  is 
shorter. We should beneﬁt by studying their qualities, natures and colours 
concerning faith that we ﬁnd here, not by listening to the lessons given by 
the tongues of disposition as was previously the case. ”

ٰ
THE SUPREME SIGN – FIRST CHAPTER

149

Beginning his study, he saw that the belief and ﬁrm conviction concern-
ing the divine unity that all luminous intellects possessed, despite their vary-
ing capacities and differing, even opposing, methods and outlooks, was the 
same, and that their steadfast and conﬁdent certainty and assurance was one. 
They had, therefore, to be relying on a single, unchanging truth; their roots 
were  sunk  in  a  profound  truth  and  could  not  be  plucked  out.  Their  una-
nimity  concerning  faith,  the  necessary  existence  and  unity  of  Allah,  was 
an unbreakable and luminous chain, a brightly lit window opening onto the 
world of the truth.

He  saw  also  that  the  unanimous,  assured  and  sublime  unveilings  and 
witnessings of the pillars of belief enjoyed by all those sound and lumi-
nous intellects, whose methods were various and outlooks divergent, cor-
responded to and agreed with each other on the matter of the divine unity. 
All those luminous hearts, turned and joined to the truth and manifesting 
it, each a small throne of dominical knowledge, a comprehensive mirror of 
Allah’s Eternal Besoughtedness, were like so many windows opened onto 
the Sun of the Truth. Taken together, they were like a supreme mirror, like 
an  ocean  reﬂecting  the  sun.  Their  agreement  and  unanimity  concerning 
the necessary existence and unity of Allah was an unfailing and reliable 
most perfect guide, most elevated preceptor. For it is in no way possible 
or conceivable that a supposition other than the truth, an untrue thought, 
a false attribute, should so consistently and decisively be able to deceive 
simultaneously so many sharp eyes, or to induce illusion in them. Not even 
the foolish Sophists, who deny the cosmos, would agree with the corrupt 
and dissipated intellect that held such a thing possible. All of this our trav-
eller understood, and he said, together with his own intellect and heart, “ I 
have believed in Allah. ”

In brief allusion to the beneﬁt derived from upright intellects and lumi-
nous hearts by our traveller, for knowledge of belief, we said in the Twelfth 
and Thirteenth Degrees of the First Station:

THE RAYS

Then that traveller looking closely at the World of the Unseen, and voy-
aging in it with his intellect and his heart, knocked inquisitively on the door 
of  that  world,  thinking  to  himself,  “ What  does  this  world  have  to  say? ” 
The  following  occurred  to  him:  it  is  to  be  clearly  understood  that  behind 
the veil of the Unseen is one who wants to make himself known through all 
these numerous ﬁnely adorned artefacts full of art in this corporeal Manifest 
World, and to make himself loved through these inﬁnite sweet and decorated 
bounties, and to make known his hidden perfections through these innumer-
able  miraculous  and  skilful  works  of  art,  and  who  does  this  by  act  rather 
than  speech  and  by  making  himself  known  by  the  tongue  of  disposition. 
Since this is so, of a certainty he will speak and make himself known and 
loved through speech and utterance just as he does through deed and state. 
In which case, from his manifestations we must know him in respect to the 
World of the Unseen. Whereupon he entered that world with his heart and 
saw the following with the eye of his intellect:

The truth of revelations prevails at all instants over all parts of the World 
of the Unseen, with a most powerful manifestation. There comes with the 
truths of revelation and inspiration proceeding from the One All-Knowing 
of  the  Unseen,  a  testimony  to  His  existence  and  unity  far  stronger  than 
testimony of the universe and created beings. He does not leave Himself, 
His existence and His unity, only to the testimony of His creatures. Rather, 
He speaks with a pre- eternal Speech consonant with His own being. The 
Speech of the One Who is all-present and all- seeing everywhere with His 
Knowledge and Power is also endless, and just as the meaning of His Speech 
makes  Him  known,  so  does  His  discourse  make  Himself  known  together 
with His attributes.

The traveller recognized that the truth, reality, and existence of revelation 
has been made plain to the point of being self-evident by the consensus of 
one hundred thousand prophets ( Upon whom be peace ), by the agreement 
among their proclamations concerning the manifestion of divine revelation; 
by the evidences and miracles contained in the sacred books and heavenly 
pages, which are the guides and exemplars of the overwhelming majority of 
humanity, conﬁrmed and assented to by them, and are the visible fruits of 
revelation. He understood further that the truth of revelation proclaims ﬁve 
sacred truths.

T h e   F i r s t :  To speak in accordance with men’s intellects and understand-

ّ(cid:193)ِ(cid:183)ٰ(cid:170)ِ

THE SUPREME SIGN – FIRST CHAPTER

151

It is a requirement of Allah’s dominicality that He endows all of his con-
scious creatures with speech, understands their speech, and then participates 
in it with His own speech.

T h e   S e c o n d :  The One who, in order to make Himself known, ﬁlls the 
cosmos with His miraculous creations and endows them with tongues speak-
ing of His perfections, will necessarily make Himself known with His own 
words also.

T h e   T h i r d :  It is a function of His being Creator to respond in words to 
the supplications and offerings of thanks that are made by the most select, 
the most needy, the most delicate and the most ardent among His beings  –  
true men.

T h e   F o u r t h :  The attribute of Speech, an essential concomitant and lumi-
nous manifestation of both Knowledge and Life, will necessarily be found 
in a comprehensive and eternal form in the being whose Knowledge is com-
prehensive and whose Life is eternal.

T h e   F i f t h :  It is a consequence of Divinity that the Being who endows 
men  with  impotence  and  desire,  poverty  and  need,  anxiety  for  the  future, 
love and worship, should communicate His own existence, by way of His 
speech, to His most loved and lovable, His most anxious and needy crea-
tures, who are most desirous of ﬁnding their Lord and Master.

The evidences for the existence in unity of the Necessary Existent offered 
in unanimity by universal and heavenly revelations, which contain the truths 
of  divine  descent,  dominical  self-  proclamation,  compassionate  response, 
divine  conversation,  and  eternal  self-communication,  constitute  a  proof 
more powerful than the testimony for the existence of the sun brought by 
the rays of sunlight.

Our traveller understood this then looked in the direction of inspiration 
and  saw  that  veracious  inspiration  indeed  resembles  revelation  in  some 
respects and is a mode of dominical speech. There are, however, two dif-
ferences.

THE  FIRST:  Revelation,  which  is  much  higher  than  inspiration,  gen-
erally  comes  by  the  medium  of  the  angels,  whereas  inspiration  generally 
comes directly.

So too a king has two modes of speech and command. The ﬁrst consists 
of his sending to a governor a lieutenant equipped with all the pomp of mon-
archy and the splendour of sovereignty. Sometimes, in order to demonstrate 
the  splendour  of  his  sovereignty  and  the  importance  of  his  command,  he 
may meet with the intermediary, and then the decree will be issued.

152

THE RAYS

The second consists of his speaking privately in his own person, not with 
the  title  of  monarch  or  in  the  name  of  kingship,  concerning  some  private 
matter, some petty affair, using for this purpose a trusted servant, some ordi-
nary subject, or his private telephone.

In the same way the Pre-Eternal Monarch may either, in the name of the 
Sustainer of All the Worlds, and with the title of Creator of the Universe, 
speak  with  revelation  or  the  comprehensive  inspiration  that  performs  the 
function of revelation, or He may speak in a different and private fashion, 
as the Sustainer and Creator of all animate beings, from behind the veil, in a 
way suited to the recipient.

THE  SECOND  DIFFERENCE:  Revelation  is  without  shadow,  pure, 
and  reserved  for  the  elect.  Inspiration,  by  contrast,  has  shadow,  colours 
intermingle with it, and it is general. There are numerous different kinds of 
inspiration, such as the inspiration of angels, the inspiration of men, and the 
inspiration of animals; inspiration thus forms a ﬁeld for the multiplication of 
Allah’s words, that are as numeous as the drops in the ocean. Our traveller 
understood that this matter is, indeed, a kind of commentary on the verse,

Inspiration {14}

( 18:109 ) Ð Ï Î Í Ì Ë Ê É È Ç Æ Å Ä 
Then he looked at the nature, the wisdom, and the testimony of inspira-
tion and saw that its nature, wisdom and result were composed of four lights.
T h e   ﬁ r s t :  it is the result of Allah’s Lovingness and Mercifulness that He 
makes himself loved through word, presence and discourse, in the same way 
that He makes Himself loved to His creatures through His deeds.

T h e   s e c o n d :  it is a requirement of His Compassionateness that just as He 
answers His servants’ prayers in deed, He should also answer them in word, 
from behind veils.

T h e   t h i r d :  it is a concomitant of dominicality that just as He responds in 
deed to the cries for help, supplications, and pleadings of those of His crea-
tures who are afﬂicted with grievous misfortunes and hardships, so too He 
should hasten to their help with words of inspiration, which are like a form 
of speech.

T h e   f o u r t h :  Allah  makes  His  existence,  presence  and  protection  per-
ceptible in deed to His most weak and indigent, His most poor and needy, 
conscious creatures, that stand in great need of ﬁnding their Master, Pro-
tector, Guardian, and Disposer. It is a necessary and essential consequence 
of His divine solicitousness and His dominical compassion that He should 
also communicate His presence and existence by speech, from behind the 

THE SUPREME SIGN – FIRST CHAPTER

153

veil of veracious inspiration  – a mode of dominical discourse –  to individu-
als,  in  a  manner  peculiar  to  them  and  their  capacities,  through  the  tel-
ephone of their hearts.

He then looked to the testimony of inspiration and saw that if the sun, 
for example, had consciousness and life, and if the seven colours of sunlight 
were  the  seven  attributes,  in  that  respect  it  would  have  a  form  of  speech 
through  the  rays  and  manifestations  found  in  its  light.  And  in  this  situa-
tion both its similitudes and reﬂections would be present in all transparent 
objects, and it would speak with all mirrors and shining objects and frag-
ments of glass and bubbles and droplets of water, indeed with all transparent 
particles, in accordance with the capacity of each; it would respond to the 
needs of each, and all these would testify to the sun’s existence; and no task 
would form an obstacle to any other task, and no speaking obstruct any other 
speaking. This is self-evident.

In the same way, the Speech of the Glorious Monarch of Pre-Eternity and 
Post-Eternity, the Beauteous and Exalted Creator of All Beings, Who may 
be described as the Pre-Eternal Sun, manifests itself to all things, in general 
and comprehensive fashion, in a manner appropriate to their capacity, as do 
also His Knowledge and Power. No request interferes with another, no task 
prevents the fulﬁlment of another, and no address becomes confused with 
another. All of this our traveller understood as self-evident. He knew that 
all of those manifestations, those discourses, those inspirations, separately 
and together, evidenced and bore witness unanimously to the presence, the 
necessary existence, the unity and the oneness of that Pre-Eternal Sun with a 
knowlege of certainty that approached a vision of certainty.

In brief allusion to the lesson in knowledge of Allah from the World of 
the Unseen gained by our inquisitive traveller, we said in the Fourteenth and 
Fifteenth Degrees of the First Station:

Then that traveller through the world addressed his own intellect saying: 
“ Since I am seeking my Master and Creator by means of the creatures of the 
cosmos, I ought before all else to visit the most celebrated of all these crea-
tures, the greatest and most accomplished commander among them, accord-
ing to the testimony even of his enemies, the most renowned ruler, the most 
exalted  in  speech  and  the  most  brilliant  an  intellect,  who  has  illuminated 
fourteen centuries with his excellence and with his Qur’an, Muhammad the 
Arabian Prophet ( May Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him ). ” In order 
thus to visit him and seek from him the answer to his quest, he entered the 
blessed age of the Prophet in his mind, and saw that age to be one of true 
felicity, thanks to that being. For through the light he had brought, he had 
turned the most primitive and illiterate of peoples into the masters and teach-
ers of the world.

He said too to his own intellect, “ Before asking him concerning our Cre-
ator, we should ﬁrst learn that value of this extraordinary being, the veracity 
of his words and the truthfulness of his warnings. ” Thus he began investi-
gating, and of the numerous conclusive proofs that he found we will brieﬂy 
indicate here only nine of the most general ones.

THE FIRST: All excellent qualities and characteristics were to be found 
in that extraordinary being, according to the testimony even of his enemies. 
Hundreds of miracles were made manifest at his hands, according to explicit 
Qur’anic verses or traditions enjoying the status of t a w ā t u r . 1 Examples of 
these miracles are his splitting of the moon, ( 54:1 ) ﮯ ~  with a sin-
gle indication of his ﬁnger; his casting of a handful of dust into the eyes of 
his enemies, causing them to ﬂee, ( 8:17 ) - , + * ) ( '  
and his giving his thirsting army to drink from the water that ﬂowed forth 
from his ﬁve ﬁngers like the Spring of Kawthar. Since some of those mira-
cles, numbering more than three hundred, have been set forth with decisive 
proofs  in  the  remarkable  and  wondrous  work  known  as  T h e   M i r a c l e s   o f  
M u h a m m a d  ( The Nineteenth Letter ), we leave discussion of the miracles to 
that work, and permit the traveller to continue speaking:

1.    Ta w ā t u r  is  the  kind  of  report  transmitted  by  numerous  authorities,  about  which 

there is no room for doubt. [ Tr. ]

THE SUPREME SIGN – FIRST CHAPTER

155

“ A being who in addition to noble characteristics and perfections has all 
these luminous miracles to demonstrate, must certainly be the most truthful 
in speech of all men. It is inconceivable that he would stoop to trickery, lies 
and error, the deeds of the vile. ”

THE SECOND: He holds in his hand a decree from the lord of the uni-
verse, a decree accepted and afﬁrmed in each century by more than three 
hundred million people. This decree, the Qur’an of Mighty Stature, is won-
drous in seven different ways. The fact that the Qur’an has forty different 
aspects of miraculousness and that it is the word of the Creator of all beings 
has  been  set  forth  in  detail  with  strong  proofs  in  the  Twenty-Fifth  Word, 
T h e   M i r a c u l o u s n e s s   o f   t h e   Q u r ’ a n , a celebrated treatise that is like the sun 
of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . We therefore leave such matters to that work and listen 
to the traveller as he says,“ There can never be any possibility of lying on 
the part of the being who is the conveyor and proclaimer of this decree, for 
that would be a violation of the decree and treachery toward the One who 
issued it. ”

THE THIRD: Such a Sacred Law, an Islam, a code of worship, a cause, 
a summons, and a faith did that being bring forth that the like of them does 
not  exist,  nor  could  it  exist.  Nor  does  a  more  perfect  form  of  them  exist, 
nor could it exist. For the law appearing with that unlettered being has no 
rival in its administration of one ﬁfth of humanity for fourteen centuries, in 
a  just  and  precise  manner  through  its  numerous  injuctions.  Moreover  the 
Islam that emerged from the deeds, sayings, and inward states of that unlet-
tered being has no peer, nor can it have, for in each century it has been for 
three hundred million men a guide and a refuge, the teacher and educator 
of their intellects and the illuminator and puriﬁer of their hearts, the cause 
for the reﬁnement and training of their souls, and the source of progress and 
advancement of their spirits.

The Prophet ( UWBP ) is similarly unparalleled in the way in which he 
was the foremost in practising all the forms of worship found in his religion, 
and the ﬁrst in piety and the fear of Allah; in his observing the duties of wor-
ship  fully  and  with  attention  to  their  profoundest  dimensions,  even  while 
engaged in constant struggle and activity; in his practice of worship com-
bining in perfect fashion the beginning and end of worship and servitude to 
Allah without imitation of anyone.

With  the J a u s h a n   a l - K a b i r ,  from  among  his  thousands  of  supplicatory 
prayers  and  invocations,  he  describes  his  Sustainer  with  such  a  degree  of 
gnosis that all the gnostics and saints who have come after him have been 

156

THE RAYS

unable, with their joint efforts, to attain a similar degree of gnosis and accu-
rate description. This shows that in prayer too he is without peer. Whoever 
looks at the section at the beginning of the Tr e a t i s e   o n   S u p p l i c a t o r y   P r a y e r  
which sets forth some part of the meaning of one of the ninety-nine sections 
of the J a u s h a n   a l - K a b i r  will say that the J a u s h a n  too has no peer.

In his conveying of the message and his summoning men to the truth, he 
displayed such steadfastness, ﬁrmness and courage that although great states 
and religions, and even his own people, tribe and uncle opposed him in the 
most hostile fashion, he exhibited not the slightest trace of hesitation anxiety 
or fear. The fact that he successfully challenged the whole world and made 
Islam the master of the world likewise proves that there is not and cannot be 
anyone like him in his conveying of the message and summons.

In his faith, he had so extraordinary a strength, so marvellous a certainty, 
so miraculous a breadth, and so exalted a conviction, illumining the whole 
world,  that  none  of  the  ideas  and  beliefs  then  dominating  the  world,  and 
none of the philosophies of the sages and teachings of the religious leaders, 
was  able,  despite  extreme  hostility  and  denial,  to  induce  in  his  certainty, 
conviction, trust and assurance, the slightest doubt, hesitation, weakness or 
anxiety. Moreover, the saintly of all ages, headed by the Companions, the 
foremost in the degrees of belief, have all drawn on his fountain of belief and 
regarded him as representing the highest degree of faith. This proves that 
his faith too is matchless. Our traveller therefore concluded, and afﬁrmed 
with his intellect, that lying and duplicity have no place in the one who has 
brought such a unique sacred law, such an unparalleled Islam, such a won-
drous devotion to worship, such an extra-ordinary excellence in supplica-
tory prayer, such a universally acclaimed summons to the truth and such a 
miraculous faith. 

THE FOURTH: In the same way that the consensus of the prophets is 
a strong proof for the existence and unity of Allah, so too it is a ﬁrm testi-
mony to the truthfulness and messengerhood of this being. For all the sacred 
attributes, miracles and functions that indicate the truthfulness and messen-
gerhood of the prophets ( Upon whom be peace ) existed in full measure in 
that being according to the testimony of history. The prophets have verbally 
predicted  the  coming  of  that  being  and  given  good  tidings  thereof  in  the 
Torah, the Gospels, the Psalms, and the pages; more than twenty of the most 
conclusive examples of these glad tidings, drawn from the scriptures, have 
been set forth and proven in the Nineteenth Letter. Similarly, through all the 
deeds  and  miracles  associated  with  their  prophethood  they  have  afﬁrmed 

THE SUPREME SIGN – FIRST CHAPTER

157

and, as it were, put their signature to the mission of that being which is the 
foremost and most perfect in the tasks and functions of prophethood. Just 
as through verbal consensus they indicate the divine unity, through the una-
nimity of their deeds they bear witness to the truthfulness of that being. This 
too was understood by our traveller.

THE FIFTH: Similarly, the thousands of saints who have attained truth, 
reality,  perfection,  wondrous  deeds,  unveiling  and  witnessing  through  the 
instruction  of  this  being  and  following  him,  bear  unanimous  witness  not 
only to the divine unity but also to the truthfulness and messengerhood of 
this being. Again, the fact that they witness, through the light of sainthood, 
some of the truths he proclaimed concerning the World of the Unseen, and 
that they believe in and afﬁrm all of those truths through the light of belief, 
either with knowledge of certainty, or with the vision of certainty, or with 
absolute certainty. He saw that this too demonstates like the sun the degree 
of truthfulness and rectitude of that great being, their master.

THE SIXTH: The millions of puriﬁed, sincere, and punctilious scholars 
and faithful sages, who have reached the highest station of learning through 
the teaching and instruction contained in the sacred truths brought by that 
being,  despite  his  unlettered  nature,  the  exalted  sciences  he invented  and 
divine knowledge he discovered  –  they not only prove and afﬁrm, unani-
mously and with the strongest proofs, the divine unity which is the founda-
tion of his mission, but also bear unanimous witness to the truthfulness of 
this supreme teacher and great master, and to the veracity of his words. This 
is a proof as clear as daylight. The  R i s a l e - i   N u r  too with its one hundred 
parts is but a single proof of his truthfulness.

THE  SEVENTH:  The  Family  and  Companions  of  the  Prophet   – who 
with  their  insight,  knowledge,  and  spiritual  accomplishment  are  the  most 
renowned, the most respected, the most celebrated, the most pious and the 
most keensighted of men after the prophets –  examined and scrutinized, with 
the utmost attention, seriousness and exactitude, all the states, thoughts and 
conditions of this being, whether hidden or open. They came to the unani-
mous conclusion that he was the most truthful, exalted, and honest being in 
the world, and this, their unshakeable afﬁrmation and ﬁrm belief, is a proof 
like the daylight attesting to the reality of the sun.

THE EIGHTH: The cosmos indicates its Maker, Inscriber, and Designer, 
Who creates, administers, and arranges it, and through determining its meas-
ure and form and regulating it, has disposal over it as though it was a palace, 
a  book,  an  exhibition,  a  spectacle.  And  so  too  it  indicates  that  it  requires 

158

THE RAYS

and necessitates an elevated herald, a truthful unveiler, a learned master, and 
a truthful teacher who will know and make known the divine purposes in the 
universe’s creation, teach the dominical instances of wisdom in its changes 
and  transformations,  give  instruction  in  the  results  of  its  dutiful  motions, 
proclaim its essential value and the perfections of the beings within it, and 
express  the  meanings  of  that  mighty  book;  it  indicates  that  he  is  certain 
to exist. Thus, the traveller knew that it testiﬁed to the truthfulness of this 
being, who performed these functions better than anyone, and to his being a 
most elevated and loyal ofﬁcial of the universe’s Creator.

THE NINTH: There is behind the veil One Who wishes to demonstrate 
with these ingenious and wise artefacts the perfection of His talent and art; 
to make Himself known and loved by means of these countless adorned and 
decorated  creations;  to  evoke  praise  and  thanks  through  the  unnumbered 
pleasurable and valuable bounties that He bestows; to cause men to worship 
Him with gratitude and appreciation in the face of His dominicality, through 
His solicitous and protective sustenance of life, and His provision of nurture 
and bounty in such manner as to satisfy the most delicate of tastes and appe-
tites; to manifest His divinity through the change of seasons, the alternation 
of  night  and  day,  and  through  all  His  magniﬁcent  and  majestic  deeds,  all 
His awe- inspiring and wise acts and creativity, and thereby to cause men to 
believe in his divinity, in submission, humility and obedience; and to dem-
onstrate His justice and truthfulness by at all times protecting virtue and the 
virtuous and destroying evil and the evil, by annihilating with blows from 
heaven the oppressor and the liar. There will of a certainty be at the side 
of this Unseen Being His most beloved creature and most devoted bonds-
man,  who,  serving  the  purposes  that  have  just  been  mentioned,  discovers 
and unravels the talisman and riddle of the creation of the universe, who acts 
always in the name of that Creator, who seeks aid and success from Him, 
and who receives them from Him  –  Muhammad of Quraysh ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace )

The traveller further said, addressing his own intellect: “ Since these nine 
truths bear witness to the truthfulness of this being, he must be the source 
of glory of mankind and the source of honour for the world. If we therefore 
call him the Pride of the World and Glory of the Sons of Adam, it will be 
ﬁtting. The fact that the awesome sovereignty of that decree of the Compas-
sionate One, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition that he holds in his hand, 
has conquered half the world, together with his individual perfections and 

THE SUPREME SIGN – FIRST CHAPTER

159

exalted virtues, shows that he is the most important personage in the world. 
The most important word concerning our Creator is that which he utters. ”

Now see: the foundation of the summons of this extraordinary being and 
the aim of all his life, based on the strength furnished by his hundreds of 
decisive and evident and manifest miracles, and the thousands of exalted, 
fundamental truths contained in his religion, was to prove and bear witness 
to the existence of the Necessary Existent, His unity, attributes and names, to 
afﬁrm, proclaim and announce Him. He is therefore like a sun in the cosmos, 
the most brilliant proof of our Creator, this being whom we call the Beloved 
of  Allah.  There  are  three  forms  of  great  and  infallible  consensus  each  of 
which afﬁrms, conﬁrms, and puts its signature to the witness he bears.

The  First: the  unanimous  afﬁrmation  made  by  that  luminous  assem-
bly known and celebrated throughout the world as the Family of Muham-
mad  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  including  thousands  of  poles 
and supreme saints of penetrating gaze and ability to perceive the Unseen, 
such as Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ), who said, “ Were the 
veil to be lifted, my certainty would not increase, ”1 and ‘Abd al-Qadir al-
Gilani, the Ghawth al-A‘zam ( May his mystery be sanctiﬁed ), who saw the 
Supreme Throne and the awesome form of Israﬁl while yet on the earth.2

The  Second: the  conﬁrmation  made  with  a  strong  faith  that  permitted 
men  to  sacriﬁce  their  lives  and  their  property,  their  fathers  and  tribes,  by 
the renowned assembly known as the Companions, who found themselves 
among a primitive people and in an unlettered environment, devoid of all 
social life and political thought, without any scripture and lost in the dark-
ness of a period between prophets; and who in a very brief time came to be 
the masters, guides, and just rulers of the most civilized and politically and 
socially advanced peoples and states, and to rule the world from east to west 
in universally approved fashion.

The  Third: the  conﬁrmation  provided  with  unanimous  and  certain 
knowledge  by  that  lofty  group  of  punctilious  and  profound  scholars  of 
whom in each age thousands spring forth, who advance in wondrous fashion 
in every science and work in different ﬁelds.

Thus, the testimony brought by this being to the divine unity is not par-
ticular and individual, but general and universal and unshakeable. If all the 
demons that exist were to unite, they could not challenge it. Such was the 
conclusion reached by the traveller.

The  tireless  and  insatiable  traveller,  who  knew  the  aim  of  life  in  this 
world and the essence of life to be faith, addressed his own heart and said: 
“ Let us examine the book known as the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, 
which is said to be the word and utterance of the Being whom we are seek-

issues a challenge in every age to whoever refuses to submit to it. Let us see

Since the traveller lived in the present age, he looked ﬁrst at the R i s a l e - i  
N u r ,  ﬂashes  from  the  miraculousness  of  the  Qur’an;  he  saw  its  one  hun-
dred  and  thirty  parts  to  consist  of  luminous  points  drawn  from  that  Book 
of Discernment, or well-founded explanations of its contents. Even though 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is valiantly struggling to diffuse the truths of the Qur’an in 
all directions, in this obstinate and atheistic age, no one can defeat it, which 
proves  that  its  master,  its  source,  its  authority  and  its  sun,  is  the  Qur’an, 
heavenly not human speech. Among the hundreds of proofs in the differ-
ent parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , the single proof contained in the Twenty-Fifth 
Word and the end of the Nineteenth Letter, establishes forty aspects of the 
Qur’an’s miraculousness in such a way that whoever sees it, far from utter-
ing any criticism or objection, admires its arguments, and utters appreciative 
praise. The traveller left it to the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  to prove that the Qur’an is 
miraculous and the true Word of Allah, turning only to a brief indication of 
a few points showing its greatness.

ٰ
THE SUPREME SIGN – FIRST CHAPTER

161

F i r s t   P o i n t :  Just as the Qur’an, with all its miracles and truths indicat-
ing its veracity is a miracle of Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ) so too, Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) with all his 
miracles, proofs of prophethood and perfections of knowledge, is a miracle 
of the Qur’an and a decisive proof of the Qur’an’s being the Word of Allah.
S e c o n d   P o i n t :  The Qur’an, in this world, brought about in so luminous, 
felicitous and truthful a fashion, a revolution in the social life of man, as 
well as in the souls, hearts, spirits, and intellects of men, in their individ-
ual, social, and political lives, and having caused this revolution perpetu-
ated it in such a fashion, that for fourteen centuries at every moment its six 
thousand, six hundred and sixty-six verses have been read by the tongues 
of more than a hundred million men, training them, reﬁning their souls and 
purifying their hearts. To spirits, it has been a means of development and 
advancement; to intellects, an orientation and light; to life, it has been life 
itself and felicity. Such a book is of a certainty unparalleled; it is a wonder, 
a marvel, and a miracle.

T h i r d   P o i n t :  The Qur’an, from that age down to the present, has demon-
strated such eloquence that it caused the value attached to the odes known as 
“ Seven Hanging Poems ” that were written in gold on the walls of the Ka‘ba 
to  descend  to  such  a  point  that  the  daughter  of  Labīd,  when  taking  down 
her father’s poem from the Ka‘ba, said, “ Compared with the verses of the 
Qur’an, this no longer has any value. ”

A bedouin poet heard this verse being recited,

( 15:94 )  0 / .
and  immediately  prostrated.  They  asked  him:  “ Have  you  become  a  Mus-
lim? ”  “ No, ”  he  replied,  “ I  was  prostrating  before  the  eloquence  of  this 
verse. ”

Thousands  of  scholars  and  litterateurs,  like  geniuses  of  the  science  of 
rhetoric such as ‘Abd al-Qahir al-Jurjani, al-Sakkaki, and al-Zamakhshari, 
have unanimously decided that the eloquence of the Qur’an is beyond human 
capacity and is unattainable.

The Qur’an has also from that time forward invited to the ﬁeld of combat 
all arrogant and egoistic litterateurs and rhetoricians, and said to them in a 
manner calculated to break their arrogance: “ Come, produce a single sura 
like it, or else accept perdition and humiliation in this world and the hereaf-
ter. ” Despite this challenge, the obstinate rhetoricians of that age abandoned 
the short path of producing a single sura like the Qur’an, and instead chose 

162

THE RAYS

the long path of casting their persons and property into danger. This proves 
that the short path cannot be taken.

Millions of Arabic books are in circulation, some written by friends of the 
Qur’an in order to resemble and imitate it, others written by its enemies in 
order to confront and criticize it. Not one of them has been able to attain the 
level of the Qur’an. Should a common man even listen to them, he is sure to 
say: “ The Qur’an does not resemble these other books, nor is it in the same 
class  as  they.  It  must  be  either  below  them  or  above  them. ”  No  one   – no 
unbeliever  or  fool –   in  the  world  can  say  that  it  is  below  them.  Hence  its 
degree of eloquence is above all of them. Once a man read the verse,

( 57:1 )  ± ° ¯ ® ¬ « 
He  said:  “ I  cannot  see  any  miraculous  eloquence  in  this  verse. ”  He  was 
told: “ Go back to that age like the traveller, and listen to the verse as recited 
there. ” Imagining himself to be there before the revelation of the Qur’an, 
he saw that all the beings in the world were living in an unstable, transient 
world in empty, inﬁnite and unbounded space, in confusion and darkness, 
lifeless  and  without  consciousness  and  purpose.  Suddenly  he  heard  this 
verse proclaimed by the tongue of the Qur’an and the verse removed a veil 
from in front of the universe and illumined the face of the globe; this pre-
eternal speech, this eternal decree, gave instruction to all conscious beings, 
drawn up in the ranks of succeeding centuries, in such fashion that the cos-
mos became like a vast mosque. All of creation headed by the heavens and 
the earth, was engaged in vital remembrance of Allah and proclamation of 
His glory, was joyously and contentedly fulﬁlling its function.

All  of  this  our  traveller  observed.  Thus  tasting  the  degree  of  the  elo-
quence of the Qur’an, and comparing the other verses to it by analogy, he 
understood one of the many thousands of wise reasons for the conquest of 
half  the  globe  and  a  ﬁfth  of  humanity  by  the  eloquent  murmuring  of  the 
Qur’an, for the uninterrupted continuance of its respected and magniﬁcent 
monarchy for fourteen centuries.

F o u r t h   P o i n t :  The Qur’an has demonstrated such a veracious sweetness 
that whereas the repetition of even the sweetest thing induces disgust, it has 
from earliest times been accepted by everyone and even become proverbial 
that repeated recitation of the Qur’an, far from inducing disgust and wea-
riness  in  men  of  sound  heart  and  pure  taste,  on  the  contrary  increases  its 
sweetness.

The Qur’an demonstrates, moreover, such a freshness, youth and orig-
inality,  that  even  though  it  has  lived  for  fourteen  centuries  and  passed 

THE SUPREME SIGN – FIRST CHAPTER

163

through  many  hands,  it  retains  its  freshness  as  if  it  had  only  just  been 
revealed. Every century sees the Qur’an enjoying a new youth, as if it were 
addressing that century in particular. Similarly, scholars of every branch of 
learning, even though they keep the Qur’an constantly at their side in order 
to beneﬁt from it, and perpetually follow its method of exposition, see that 
the Qur’an maintains the originality of its style and manner of explanation.

F i f t h   P o i n t :  One  wing  of  the  Qur’an  is  in  the  past,  and  one  is  in  the 
future,  and  like  its  root  and  one  wing  are  the  agreed  truths  of  the  former 
prophets, and it conﬁrms and corroborates them, and they too conﬁrm it with 
the tongue of unanimity, so too all the true Suﬁ paths and ways of sainthood 
whose fruits like the saints and puriﬁed scholars, who receive life from the 
Qur’an, show through their vital spiritual progress that their blessed tree is 
living, effulgent, and the means to truth, and who grow and live under the 
protection of its second wing, testify that the Qur’an is pure truth and the 
assembly of truths and in its comprehensiveness, a matchless wonder.

S i x t h   P o i n t :  The  Qur’an’s  truthfulness  and  veracity  show  that  its  six 
aspects are luminous. Indeed, the pillars of argument and proof beneath it; 
the ﬂashes of the stamp of miraculousness above it; the gifts of happiness 
in this world and the next before it, its goal; the truths of heavenly revela-
tion, the point of support behind it; the assent and evidence of innumerable 
upright minds to its right; and the true tranquillity, sincere attraction, and 
submission of sound hearts and clean consciences on its left all prove that 
the Qur’an is a wondrous, ﬁrm, unassailable citadel of both the heavens and 
the earth.

So too from these six levels, the Disposer of the universe has set His seal 
on its being sheer truth and right, and not being man’s word, and its contain-
ing no error  –  the Disposer, Who has made it His practice to always exhibit 
beauty in the universe, protect good and right, and eliminate imposters and 
liars,  has  conﬁrmed  and  set  His  seal  on  the  Qur’an  by  giving  it  the  most 
acceptable, highest, and most dominant place of respect and degree of suc-
cess in the world.

And  so  too  the  one  who  is  the  source  of  Islam  and  interpreter  of  the 
Qur’an   –   his  believing  in  it  and  holding  it  in  greater  respect  than  every-
one else, and being in a sleep-like state when it was revealed,  1 and other 
words and speeches not resembling or coming near it, and that Interpreter’s 
describing  without  hesistation  and  with  complete  conﬁdence  through  the

Qur’an true cosmic events of generally the past and the future from behind 
the veil of the Unseen, and no trickery or fault being observed in him while 
being under the gazes of the sharpest eyes, and his believing and afﬁrming 
every pronouncement of the Qur’an with all his strength and nothing shak-
ing him, is a stamp conﬁrming that the Qur’an is revealed and true and the 
blessed Word of his own Compassionate Creator.

Also a ﬁfth of mankind, indeed the greater part of it, being drawn to the 
Qur’an and bound to it in religion and giving ear to it eagerly desirous of 
the  truth,  and  according  to  the  testimony  of  many  indications  and  events 
and illuminations, the jinn, angels, and spirit beings also gathering around 
it in truth-worshipping fashion like moths whenever it is recited 1 is a stamp 
conﬁrming the Qur’an’s acceptance by all beings and that it occupies a most 
high position.

Also, all the classes of mankind from the most stupid and lowly to the 
cleverest  and  most  learned  taking  their  full  share  of  the  Qur’an’s  instruc-
tion and their understanding its most profound truths, and all branches of 
scholars like the great interpreters of the Greater Shari‘a in particular, and 
hundreds of Islamic sciences and branches of knowledge, and the brilliant 
and exacting scholars of theology and the principles of religion extracting 
from the Qur’an all the needs and answers for their own sciences is a stamp 
conﬁrming that the Qur’an is a source of truth and mine of reality.

Also, although the Arab literary ﬁgures, who were the most advanced in 
regard to literature,  –  those of them who were not Muslims –  had the greatest 
need to dispute the Qur’an, their avoiding producing the like of only a single 
sura and its eloquence, eloquence being only one aspect of the seven major 
aspects of the Qur’an’s miraculousness, as well as the famous orators and 
brilliant scholars up to the present who have wanted to gain fame through 
disputing it being unable to oppose a single aspect of its miraculousness and 
their remaining silent in impotence, is a stamp conﬁrming that the Qur’an is 
a miracle and beyond the powers of man.

Yes, the value, superiority, and eloquence of a speech or word is appar-
ent through knowing, “ from whom it has come and to whom, and for what 
purpose; ” the Qur’an then can have no like, and none can reach it. For the 
Qur’an is a speech and address of the Sustainer of all the worlds and Crea-
tor of the whole universe and a dialogue in no way hinting of imitation and 
artiﬁciality. It is addressed to the one sent in the name of all men, indeed 
of all beings, the most famous and renowned of mankind, the strength and

breadth of whose belief gave rise to mighty Islam and raised its owner to 
the level of the “ distance of two bow-strings ” (53:9) and returned him as the 
addressee of the Eternally Besought One. It describes and explains the mat-
ters concerning happiness in this world and the next, the results of the crea-
tion of the universe, and the dominical purposes within it. It expounds also 
the belief of the one it addresses, which was the highest and most extensive 
of belief and bore all the truths of Islam. It turns and shows every side of the 
huge universe like a map, a clock, or a house, and teaches and describes it in 
the manner of the Craftsman Who made them  –  to produce the like of this 
Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition is not possible; the degree of its miracu-
lousness cannot be attained to.

Also, thousands of precise and learned scholars of high intelligence have 
each written commentaries expounding the Qur’an, some of which are of 
thirty,  forty,  or  even  seventy  volumes,  showing  and  proving  through  evi-
dence and argument the innumerable qualities, ﬁne points, characteristics, 
mysteries, elevated meanings, and numerous indications concerning every 
sort of hidden and unseen matter in the Qur’an. And the one hundred and 
thirty parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  in particular, each of which proves with deci-
sive arguments one quality, one ﬁne point of the Qur’an. Each part of it  –  like 
T h e   M i r a c u l o u s n e s s   o f   t h e   Q u r ’ a n , and the Second Station of the Twentieth 
Word, which deduces many things from the Qur’an concerning the wonders 
of civilization like the railway and the aeroplane, and the First Ray, called 
S i g n s   o f   t h e   Q u r ’ a n , which makes known the indications of verses alluding 
to the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  and electricity, and the eight short treatises called  T h e  
E i g h t   S y m b o l s , which show how well-ordered, full of meaning, and mysteri-
ous are the words of the Qur’an, and the small treatise proving in ﬁve aspects 
the miraculousness of the verses at the end of Sura al-Fath in regard to their 
giving news of the Unseen - each part of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  shows one truth, 
one light of the Qur’an. All this forms a stamp conﬁrming that the Qur’an 
has no like, is a miracle and a marvel, and that it is the tongue of the World 
of the Unseen in the Manifest World and the Word of One All-Knowing of 
the Unseen.

Thus, due to these qualities and characteristics of the Qur’an indicated 
above in six points, six aspects, and six levels, its sublime, luminous sover-
eignty and sacred, mighty rule has continued with perfect splendour illumi-
nating the faces of the centuries and the face of the earth for one thousand 
three hundred years. And also on account of these qualities of the Qur’an, 
each of its letters has gained the sacred distinction of yielding at least ten 
rewards, ten merits, and ten eternal fruits, and the letters of certain verses and 

166

THE RAYS

suras yielding a hundred or a thousand fruits, or even more, and at blessed 
times the light, reward, and value of each letter rising from ten to hundreds. 
The traveller through the world understood this and said to his heart:

“ The Qur’an, which is thus miraculous in every respect, through the con-
sensus of its suras, the agreement of its verses, the accord of its lights and 
mysteries, and the concurrence of its fruits and works, so testiﬁes with its 
evidences in the form of proofs to the existence, unity, attributes, and names 
of a Single Necessarily Existent One that it is from its testimony that the 
endless testimony of all the believers has issued forth. ”

Our traveller, our voyager through life, knew now that faith is the most 
precious  capital  man  can  have,  for  it  bestows  on  indigent  man  not  some 
transient  and  ephemeral  ﬁeld  or  dwelling,  but  a  palace,  indeed  an  eternal 
kingdom as vast as the whole cosmos or the world itself. Faith also bestows 
on  ephemeral  man  all  he  will  need  for  life  eternal;  delivers  from  eternal 
annihilation wretched man who waits on the gallows for the arrival of fate; 
and  opens  to  man  an  eternal  treasury  of  everlasting  felicity.  The  traveller 
then said to himself:

Looking  through  the  broad  and  comprehensive  telescope  he  had  taken 
from the Qur’an, he saw the cosmos to be so meaningful and well-ordered 
that it took on the shape of an embodied book of the Glorious One, an incar-
nate dominical Qur’an, a ﬁnely adorned palace of the Eternally Besought 
One, an orderly city of the Most Merciful. All the suras, verses, and words 
of that book of the universe, even its very letters, chapters, divisions, pages, 
and lines, through their constant meaningful effacement and reafﬁrmation, 
their wise changes and alternations, gave unanimous expression to the exist-
ence and presence of One Who has knowledge of all things and power over 
all things as the author of the book, of a Glorious Inscriber and a Perfect 
Scribe  seeing  all  things  in  all  things  and  knowing  the  relationship  of  all 
things with all things.

So too all the species and particles of the cosmos, all its inhabitants and 
contents, all that enters it and leaves it, all the providential changes and the 
wise processses of rejuvenation that occur in it  –  these proclaim in unison 
the existence and unity of an exalted craftsman, a peerless Maker Who sets 
to  work  with  limitless  power  and  inﬁnite  wisdom.  The  testimony  of  two 
great and vast truths, of a piece with the immensity of the cosmos, afﬁrms 
this supreme witness of the cosmos.

First Truth {17}

FIRST  TRUTH: These  are  the  truths  of  createdness  and  contingency 
established  with  countless  proofs  by  the  gifted  scholars  of  the  principles 
of religion and the science of theology, as well as the sages of Islam. They 
said that since change and mutation are to be observed in the world and all 
things, the world must be ephemeral and created; it cannot be uncreated. If 
it is created, then there must be a Maker Who created it. And if there is no 
cause to be found in the essence of a thing either for its being or for its non-
being, so that these two are equally possible, that thing cannot be necessary 
and eternal.

It  has  further  been  proven  with  decisive  arguments  that  it  is  not  pos-
sible  for  things  to  create  each  other,  since  that  would  involve  the  absurd 
and false notion of causality and never-ending causal sequences. Hence the 
existence of a Necessary Existence becomes necessary, Whose like cannot 
exist, Whose similitude is impossible, all other than Whom is contingent and 
created by him.

Yes,  the  truth  of  createdness  has  permeated  the  whole  of  the  cosmos, 
and many instances of it are visible to the eye; the rest can be seen only by 
the intellect. For in front of our eyes a whole world dies every autumn, and 
together with it die hundreds of thousands of different kinds of plants and 

168

THE RAYS

small animals, each member of each species being like a small cosmos unto 
himself.  It  is,  however,  so  orderly  and  disciplined  a  death  that  all  things 
leave behind in their places seeds and eggs that in the spring shall be the 
means of resurrection and rebirth, miracles of mercy and wisdom, miracles 
of  power  and  knowledge.  They  hand  to  the  seeds  and  eggs  their  book  of 
deeds  and  plan  of  action,  entrusting  them  to  the  wisdom  of  the  Glorious 
Preserver and under His protection, and only then do they die.

In spring, the dead trees, roots and animals come to life again exactly as 
they  were,  thus  providing  hundreds  of  thousands  of  examples,  specimens 
and  proofs  of  the  supreme  resurrection.  In  the  place  of  others,  plants  and 
animals resembling them exactly are brought into being and life, thus pub-
lishing the pages of the beings of the preceding spring, together with their 
deeds and functions, just like an advertisement. Thus they demonstrate one 
meaning of the verse,  ( 81:10 )  G F E

Then  also,  with  respect  to  the  whole,  each  autumn  a  great  world  dies, 
and  each  spring  a  fresh  world  comes  into  being.  That  death  and  creation 
proceed in so orderly a manner, and so many separate deaths and creations 
occur within them, in such orderly and regular fashion, that it is as if the 
world were a traveller’s lodge where animate beings reside for a time, where 
travelling worlds and migrant realms come, fulﬁl their duties, and then go 
on their way. So there is apparent to all intellects, with the clarity of the sun, 
the necessary existence, inﬁnite power and unending wisdom of a Glorious 
Being Who creates and brings into being in this world vital realms and pur-
posive  universes,  with  perfect  wisdom,  knowledge,  and  equilibrium,  with 
balance,  order  and  regularity,  and  who  then  employs  them  for  dominical 
purposes, divine aims and merciful goals, with full power and compassion. 
We leave to the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  and the books of the theologians the further 
discussion of matters related to createdness.

As for contingence, it prevails over and surrounds all of the cosmos. For 
we  see  that  all  things,  universal  or  particular,  big  or  small,  from  Allah’s 
throne down to the ground, from the atom to the planet, all are sent to the 
world with a particular essence, a speciﬁc form, a distinct identity, particu-
lar attributes, wise qualities, and beneﬁcial organs. Now to bestow on that 
particular essence and quiddity its peculiarities, from amongst the inﬁnite 
possibilities available; to clothe it in its speciﬁc, distinctive and appropriate 
form, from among the possibilities and probabilities that are as numerous as 
the forms that may be conceived; to distinguish that being with the identity 
suited to it, from among the possibilities as numerous as the other members 

THE SUPREME SIGN – FIRST CHAPTER

169

of its species; to endow with special, suitable and beneﬁcial attributes the 
created object that is formless and hesitant midst the possibilities and prob-
abilities that are as numerous as the varieties of attribute and degree; to afﬁx 
to  that  aimless  creature,  perplexed  and  distraught  amidst  the  innumerable 
possibilities and probabilities that result from the inﬁnitude of conceivable 
paths and modalities  – to afﬁx to it wise qualities and beneﬁcial organs and 
equip it with them –  all of these are indications, proofs, and afﬁrmations to 
the number of the innumerable possibilities of the necessary existence, inﬁ-
nite power and unlimited wisdom of the Necessary Existent Who creates, 
chooses, speciﬁes, and distinguishes the quiddity and identity, the form and 
shape, the attribute and situation of all contingent beings, whether they be 
universals or particulars.

They indicate, too, that no object and no matter is hidden from Him, that 
nothing is difﬁcult for Him, that the greatest task is as easy for Him as the 
smallest, that He can create a spring as easily as a tree, and a tree as easily 
as a seed. All this, then, pertains to the truth of contingence, and forms one 
wing of the great testimony borne by the cosmos.

Since the testimony of the cosmos, with  its  two wings  and two truths, 
is fully established and explained in various parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and 
particularly the Twenty-Second and Thirty- Second Words, as well as the 
Twentieth and Thirty-Third Letters, we refer our readers to those writings, 
and cut short an extremely long story.

Second Truth {18}

SECOND TRUTH: As for the Second Truth that proceeds from the total 
scheme of the cosmos, which is also the second wing of its great and univer-
sal testimony, it is as follows:

There is to be seen a truth of co-operation among these beings that are 
attempting to maintain their existence, and if they are animate, their life, and 
fulﬁl their functions in the midst of constantly stirring changes and revolu-
tions, a truth that lies far beyond their capacities.

For  example,  the  elements  hasten  to  aid  animate  beings;  the  clouds  to 
help the vegetable kingdom; the vegetable kingdom, to help the animal king-
dom; the animal kingdom, to help the human kingdom. Milk gushes forth 
from the breast, like the spring of Paradise, to succour the infant; the fact 
that animate beings are given their needs and sustenance in a manner that 
transcends their capacity, from unexpected places; the replenishing of the 
cells of the body with particles of food, through their being subjugated by 
their  Sustainer  and  their  employment  at  His  merciful  hands  -  all  of  these 
and numerous other examples of the truth of co-operation demonstrate the 

170

THE RAYS

universal and compassionate dominicality of the Sustainer of All the Worlds, 
Who administers the cosmos like a palace.

Solid, inanimate and unfeeling objects, that nonetheless co-operate with 
each other in a sensitive and conscious fashion, must of necessity be caused 
to rush to each other’s aid by the power, mercy, and command of a Compas-
sionate, Wise, and Glorious Sustainer.

The universal co-operation visible throughout the cosmos; the compre-
hensive  equilibrium  and all-embracing  preservation  prevailing  with  the 
utmost regularity in all things, from the planets to the members, limbs and 
bodily particles of animate beings; the adorning whose pen ranges over the 
gilded face of the heavens, the decorated face of the earth, and the delicate 
faces of ﬂowers; the ordering that prevails over all things, from the Milky 
Way and solar system down to fruits such as corn and pomegranates; the 
assigning of duties to all things, from the sun and the moon, the elements 
and the clouds, down to honey-bees  –  all of these great truths offer a testi-
mony of proportionate greatness, and their testimony forms the second wing 
of the testimony offered by the cosmos.

Since the R i s a l e - i   N u r  has established and clariﬁed this great testimony, 

we will content ourselves here with this brief indication.

In brief allusion to the lesson of faith learned by our traveller from the

19 Degree: The Station of Direct Address to Allah in His Presence

ٰ
THE SUPREME SIGN – FIRST CHAPTER

171

Then the ardent and inquisitive traveller, who was seeking the Creator of 
the world, had advanced by gaining knowledge of Allah indirectly through 
eighteen degrees and approached, at the end of an ascension in belief to the 
throne of truth, a station where in the presence of Allah, he addressed Him 
directly. He said to his own spirit:

“ In  the  noble  opening  sura  of  the  Qur’an,  the  verses  that  extend  from 
the  beginning  to  the  word  َكاَ
ّ(cid:192)ِا ( You  alone )  are  like  a  form  of  praise  and 
encomium uttered indirectly; but the word  َكاَ
ّ(cid:192)ِا signiﬁes a coming into His 
presence and addresssing Him directly. So too we should abandon this indi-
rect seeking and ask for the object of search from the object of our search. 
For one must ask the sun, that shows all things, concerning the sun, since 
that which shows all things will show itself even more clearly. Just as we 
perceive and know the sun by its rays, so too we can strive to know our Crea-
tor, in accordance with our capacities, through His most beautiful names and 
sacred attributes. ”

We will set forth here, with the utmost brevity and concision, two of the 
countless paths that lead to this goal; two of the inﬁnite degrees of those two 
paths; and two of the abundant truths and details of those two degrees.

The First Truth {19}

THE  FIRST  TRUTH: There appears visible to our eye a comprehen-
sive, permanent, orderly and awesome truth, one that changes, transforms, 
and renews all beings in heaven and on earth, with imperious and incessant 
activity. Within the truth of that in every way wise activity, there is imme-
diately perceived the truth of the manifestation of dominicality, and in turn, 
within the truth of that in every way merciful manifestation of dominicality, 
is recognizable the truth of the epiphany of divinity.

From this continuous, wise and imperious activity, the deeds of an All-
Powerful  and  All-  Knowing  Doer  can  be  discerned,  as  if  from  behind  a 
veil. And from behind the veil of these nurturing and administering deeds 
of  dominicality,  the  divine  names,  manifest  in  all  things,  can  be  imme-
diately perceived. Then behind the veil of the beautiful names, manifest 
with  glory  and  beauty,  can  be  deduced  the  existence  and  reality  of  the 
seven sacred attributes, according to the testimony of all creation, in a life-
giving,  powerful,  knowledgeable,  all-hearing,  all-seeing,  volitional  and 
speech-endowed form, there appears to the eye of faith in the heart, self-
evidently, necessarily, and with full certainty, the existence of a Necessary 
Existent that is described by these attributes, a Single One of Unity known 
by these names, a Peerless and Eternal Doer, in a form more evidential and 
brilliant than the sun.

172

THE RAYS

For  a  beautiful  and  profound  book  necessarily  presupposes  the  act  of 
writing and a well-built house presupposes the act of building; and the acts 
of writing beautifully and building well presuppose the names of writer and 
builder;  and  the  titles  of  writer  and  builder  obviously  imply  the  arts  and 
attributes of writing and building; and these arts and attributes self-evidently 
necessitate one who will be qualiﬁed by the names and attributes, and be the 
artist and craftsman. For just as it is impossible for there to be a deed without 
a doer, or a name without one designated by the name, so too it is not pos-
sible for there to be an attribute without one qualiﬁed by the attribute, and 
for there to be a craft without a craftsman.

On the basis, then, of this truth and principle, the universe with all the 
beings  it  contains  resembles  a  collection  of  profound  books  and  letters 
written by the pen of divine determining, and countless buildings and pal-
aces constructed with the hammer of divine power. Each of these singly in 
thousands of ways and together in uncountable ways utters the following 
testimony:

These innumerable dominical and merciful deeds, and the endless mani-
festations of the thousand and one divine names which are the source of the 
deeds,  and  the  inﬁnite  manifestations  of  the  seven  transcendent  attributes 
which  are  the  source  of  the  beautiful  names,  in  endless  and  inﬁnite  ways 
point to and testify to the necessary existence and unity of an All- Glorious 
Essence Which is the source of those all-embracing, sacred seven attributes 
and is qualiﬁed by them. And so too all the instances of beauty, loveliness, 
perfection, and exquisiteness found in those beings self-evidently testify all 
together to the sacred beauties and perfections of the dominical deeds, and 
the divine names, and attributes, and qualities, which are ﬁtting and worthy 
of them, and to the sacred beauty of the Most Pure and Holy Essence.

So the truth of dominicality that manifests itself within the truth of activ-
ity  reveals  and  makes  itself  known  in  qualities  and  acts  such  as  creating, 
originating,  fashioning  and  bringing  into being,  with  knowledge  and  wis-
dom; determining, forming, administering and changing with regularity and 
balance; transforming, causing to descend and perfecting, with purpose and 
will; and feeding, nurturing, and bestowing generosity and bounty, with ten-
derness and mercy. And within the truth of the manifestation of dominical-
ity, the truth of the immediately perceived revelation of divinity makes itself 
known  and  recognized  through  the  compassionate  and  muniﬁcent  mani-
festations  of  the  beautiful  names  and  through  the  glorious  and  beauteous 
manifestations of the seven realized attributes: life, knowledge, power, will, 
hearing, sight, and speech.

THE SUPREME SIGN – FIRST CHAPTER

173

Just  as  the  attribute  of  speech  makes  the  Most  Sacred  Essence  known 
through revelation and inspiration, so too the attribute of power makes the 
Essence known through its skilled works and effects, each of which is like 
a  word  assuming  external  shape.  Presenting  the  cosmos  from  end  to  end 
under the aspect of an incarnate book of discernment, it describes and makes 
known a Powerful Possessor of Glory.

As for the attribute of knowledge, it makes known a single Most Sacred 
Essence,  through  each  of  the  wise,  well-ordered  and  balanced  objects  of 
creation, through each creature administered, directed, adorned, and made 
distinct by Allah’s knowledge.

As for the attribute of life, it is proven not only by its own evidences, but 
also by all the works that proclaim Allah’s power, by all the well-ordered, 
wise, balanced and adorned forms and states that indicate Allah’s knowl-
edge, as well as by all proofs of all other attributes. Thus life, showing as 
witnesses all animate beings, which act as mirrors reﬂecting those abundant 
proofs, makes known an Eternally Living and Self-Subsistent Essence.

It  is  also  this  attribute  that  constantly  changes  the  cosmos,  in  order  to 
produce in it ever-fresh and various manifestations and designs, and turns it 
into a supreme mirror composed of countless smaller mirrors. Similarly, the 
attributes of seeing and hearing, willing and speaking, each reveal and make 
known the Most Sacred Essence, just as the cosmos does.

Then, too, just as the attributes point to the existence of the Possessor of 
Glory, they also indicate in most manifest fashion the existence and reality 
of life, and the livingness and permanence of that Essence. For knowing is 
a sign of life; hearing is an indication of life; seeing belongs only to the liv-
ing; will takes place only with life. Purposive power is found only in living 
beings, and speech is a task for those endowed with knowledge and life.

It follows from the foregoing that the attribute of life has proofs seven 
times  as  numerous  as  the  cosmos,  and  evidences  that  proclaim  its  exist-
ence and the existence of the One Whom it qualiﬁes. Thus it comes to be 
the  foundation  and  source  of  the  attributes,  the  origin  and  support  of  the 
supreme name. Since the R i s a l e - i   N u r  establishes this ﬁrst truth with power-
ful proofs and clariﬁes it, we will content ourselves now with a drop from 
this ocean.

The Second Truth {20}

THE  SECOND  TRUTH:  divine  discourse,  which  proceeds  from  the 
attribute  of  Speech.  ( 18:109 )   É È Ç Æ Å Ä  According  to  the 
inner  sense  of  this  verse,  divine  discourse  is  inﬁnite.  The  clearest  sign 

174

THE RAYS

demonstrating the existence of a being is his speech. This truth, therefore, 
constitutes an inﬁnite testimony to the existence and unity of the Pre-Eter-
nal Speaker. Since two powerful evidences of this truth are revelation and 
inspiration, set forth in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Degrees of this treatise; 
another broad proof is provided by sacred and heavenly Books, as indicated 
in the Tenth Degree; and a further most brilliant and comprehensive proof is 
furnished by the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, as discussed in the Sev-
enteenth Degree - for all these reasons we refer our readers to those Degrees 
for the exposition and afﬁrmation of this truth. Enough for us and for our 
traveller, who was unable to proceed beyond this point, are the lights and 
mysteries contained in the sublime verse that proclaims this truth in miracu-
lous fashion and adds it own testimony to all of the preceding ones:

Note

NOTE

Each of the truths that offer their testimony in the Nineteen 
Degrees of the First Chapter of the Second Station above not 
only indicate Necessary Existence through existence and pres-
ence, but also through their comprehensiveness, attest Allah’s 
unity and oneness. But since they prove existence most clearly 
and  explicitly,  we  regarded  them  ﬁrst  as  proofs  of  Necessary 
Existence.

As for the Second Chapter of the Second Station, the truths 
in question will be designated instead as proofs of divine unity, 
insofar as they explicitly prove unity, and implicitly necessity. 
In  reality,  each  proves  the  other;  unity  proves  necessity,  and 
necessity proves unity. In order to indicate the difference, we 
said repeatedly in the First Chapter, ِةَ(cid:163)(cid:193)ِ(cid:163)َ(cid:110) ِةَ(cid:142)اَ(cid:110)ِا ِة َ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:147)َ(cid:150) ِةَداَ(cid:183)َ(cid:131)ِ(cid:92) 
while in the Second Chapter we shall recurrently say, 
ِةَ(cid:163)(cid:193)ِ(cid:163)َ(cid:110) ِةَ(cid:142)اَ(cid:110)ِا ِة َ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:147)َ(cid:150) ِةَدَ(cid:182)اَ(cid:131)ُ(cid:175)ـِ(cid:92) thus indicating the evident visibil-
ity of divine unity. I had the intention of explaining the degrees 
of the Second Chapter, just as I did in the First Chapter, but on 
account of various obstacles I am compelled to be summary and 
concise. I leave it to other parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  to expound 
these matters as they deserve to be expounded.

Second Chapter
Concerning Proofs of the Divine Unity 

[ The traveller who had been sent to the world in order to attain faith, 
who journeyed through the whole cosmos in his mind in order to ask 
all things concerning his Creator, to seek his Sustainer in every place 
and ﬁnd his Allah, with the utmost certainty, at the point of Necessary 
Existence  –  this traveller said to his intellect: “ Come, let us depart on a 
new journey in order to behold the proofs of the unity of our Necessar-
ily Existent Creator. ”
They set out together. At the First Stopping-Place, they saw four sacred 
truths  prevailing  over  the  whole  cosmos,  truths  that  self-evidently 
necessitated the unity of Allah. ]

The First Truth: Absolute Divinity {21}

THE FIRST TRUTH: Absolute Divinity

The absorption of each class of men in a mode of worship dictated by 
their  innate  dispositions;  the  species  of  worship  engaged  in  by  other  ani-
mate beings, as well as inanimate beings, through the performance of their 
essential functions; the way in which all material and immaterial bounties 
and gifts in the cosmos become means inciting men to worship and thanks, 
to  praise  and  gratitude;  the  fashion  in  which  all  the  manifestations  of  the 
Unseen and epiphanies of the spirit, revelation and inspiration, unanimously 
proclaim the exclusive ﬁtness of one Allah to receive worship  –  all of this, 
in most evidential fashion, proves the reality and dominance of a single and 
absolute divinity. If the truth of such a divinity exists, it can in no way accept 
partnership. For those who respond to divinity  – that is, the ﬁtness to be wor-
shipped –  with thanks and worship, are the conscious and animate fruits on 
the highest branches of the tree of the cosmos. If others were able to gratify 
and place under their obligation those conscious beings in such fashion as 
to make them turn away from and forget their true object of worship  – who 
may, indeed, be swiftly forgotten, because of his invisibility –  this would be 
in such utter contradiction to the essence of divinity and its sacred purposes 
that it could in no way be allowed. It is for this reason that the Qur’an so 
repeatedly and with such vehemence refutes polytheism and threatens the 
polytheists with Hell-ﬁre.

The Second Truth: Absolute Dominicality {22}

176

THE SUPREME SIGN – SECOND CHAPTER

177

THE SECOND TRUTH: Absolute Dominicality

The  ubiquitous  workings  of  a  wise  and  compassionate  hidden  hand 
throughout  the  cosmos,  especially  in  animate  beings  and  their  nurturing 
and development, everywhere in the same fashion and yet in a totally unex-
pected form, must be, without doubt, the emanation and light of an absolute 
dominicality and a decisive proof of its reality.

An  absolute  dominicality  cannot  accept  any  partnership  for  since  the 
important aims and purposes of dominicality, such as the manifestation of its 
beauty, the proclamation of its perfection, the revelation of its precious arts 
and the display of its hidden accomplishments, are combined and concen-
trated in particulars and animate beings, the slightest attribution to Allah of a 
partner, when entering even the most particular of things and the smallest of 
animate beings, will frustrate the attainment of those purposes and destroy 
those aims. Averting the faces of conscious beings from those purposes and 
the  One  Who  conceived  them  toward  causes  will  be  totally  opposed  and 
hostile to the essence of dominicality, and absolute dominicality cannot in 
any way countenance it.

The abundant proclamations in the Qur’an of Allah’s sanctity and tran-
scendence, its verses and words, even its letters and their shapes, are con-
stant guides to Allah’s unity, made necessary by the mystery we have just 
expounded.

The Third Truth: Perfections {23}

THE THIRD TRUTH: Perfections

The  self-evident  testimony  to  the  existence  of  the  truth  of  perfections 
given by all the exalted instances of wisdom in the universe, all its wondrous 
beauties, its just laws, its wise purposes, and in particular its testimony to 
the perfections of the Creator, Who brought forth the cosmos out of the void 
and then administered it in every way miraculously and beauteously, as well 
as the perfections of man, who is the conscious mirror of the Creator  –  such 
testimony is extremely clear.

There exists then the truth of perfections, and the certainty that the Crea-
tor Who fashioned the cosmos in perfection must Himself possess perfec-
tion.  Further,  the  perfections  of  man,  the  most  important  fruit  of  the  uni-
verse,  vicegerent  of  the  earth,  the  beloved  and  most  valued  object  of  His 
creation  –  these are also established as true. Therefore, to assign partners 
to Allah would be unacceptable and false, for it would condemn to destruc-
tion  and  perdition  all  of  the  perfect  and  wise  beings  we  behold  with  our 
eyes; it would turn the cosmos into a vain plaything of accident, a place of 

178

THE RAYS

amusement for nature, a cruel slaughterhouse for the animate, an awesome 
house of sorrows for the conscious; it would reduce man, whose perfections 
are visible in his works, to the level of the most wretched, distraught and vile 
animal; and it would draw a veil across the inﬁnite perfections of the Creator 
that are reﬂected in the mirror of all beings, thus nullifying the result of His 
activity and denying His creativity.

Since assigning partners to Allah contradicts divine, human and cosmic 
perfections and its denial of them has been established and explained in the 
First Station of the Second Ray ( devoted to three fruits of divine unity ) with 
strong and decisive proofs, we refer our readers that work and cut short the 
discussion here.

The Fourth Truth: Sovereignty {24}

THE FOURTH TRUTH: Sovereignty

Whoever looks at the cosmos with comprehensive attention, will see it to 
resemble a most prosperous and active kingdom, a city administered most 
wisely and ruled most ﬁrmly; he sees all things and all species obediently 
engaged in a particular function.

According to the military metaphor contained in the verse,

( 48:7 )  K J I H
the prevailing creative commands, imperious orders, and kingly laws enun-
ciated in those numerous armies, that extend from the hosts of the atom, the 
battalions of the vegetable kingdom, the brigades of the animal kingdom, to 
the armies of the stars, and embrace both the lowliest soldier and the loftiest 
commander  –  they all indicate self-evidently the existence of an absolute 
sovereignty and a universal authority.

There is then a truth of absolute sovereignty, and there can be no truth of 
assigning partners to Allah. For according to the decisive truth of the verse,

( 21:22 )  ¶ μ ´ ³ ² ± ° 
if numerous hands all engage assertively in the same task, the result will be 
confusion. If there are two kings in one country, or even two headmen in 
one district, order will disappear, and administration be replaced by anar-
chy. But on the contrary we see everywhere such order, from the wing of 
the ﬂy to the lamps of the heavens, from the cells of the body to the signs of 
the planets, that there is no possibility for the intervention of any partner in 
Allah’s affairs.

THE SUPREME SIGN – SECOND CHAPTER

179

Sovereignty  is,  moreover,  a  station  of  dignity;  to  accept  a  rival  would 
ﬂout the dignity of sovereignty. The fact that man, who needs the assistance 
of many people on account of his impotence, will kill his brothers and off-
spring in the cruellest fashion for the sake of some petty, apparent and tem-
porary sovereignty, shows that sovereignty rejects all notion of partnership. 
If so feeble a one acts thus for the sake of so petty a sovereignty, it follows 
that the Possessor of Absolute Power, the Master of All Creation, will never 
permit one other than Himself to participate in His sacred sovereignty, the 
means to His real and universal dominicality and divinity.

Since this truth has been established with ﬁrm proofs in numerous places 
throughout the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and especially the Second Station of the Second 
Ray, we refer the reader to those pages for further discussion of it.

Then that restless traveller addressed his heart and said: “ The fact that the 
people of faith, and particularly those afﬁliated with a Suﬁ order, are con-
stantly repeating the words, َوُ(cid:182)  َ
َ(cid:202) and recalling and proclaiming Allah’s 
unity, is an indication that the afﬁrmation of Allah’s unity comprises many 
degrees. Such afﬁrmation is moreover a most enjoyable, most valuable, and 
most  exalted  sacred  duty,  instinctive  function,  and  act  of  worship.  Let  us 
then in order to attain a further degree, open the door of another stopping-
place in this abode of instruction. For the true afﬁrmation of Allah’s unity 
we seek is not some imaginary species of knowledge. It is rather an afﬁr-
mation that in terms of logic is deemed the opposite of imagination, that is 
far more valuable than cognition based on imagination, that is the result of 
proof, that is designated a knowledge. ”

THE RAYS

The true afﬁrmation of Allah’s unity is a judgement, a conﬁrmation, an 
assent and acceptance that can ﬁnd its Sustainer present with all things, that 
sees in all things a path leading to its Creator, and does not regard anything 
as an obstacle to His presence. For otherwise it would always be necessary 
to tear and cast aside the veil of the cosmos in order to ﬁnd its Sustainer. 
“ Onward, then, ” said the traveller to himself, as he knocked at the door of 
Allah’s Sublimity and Grandeur. He entered the Stopping-Place of Allah’s 
deeds and workings, the world of creation and origination, and there he saw 
that ﬁve comprehensive truths were prevailing over the entire cosmos, and 
offering self-evident proof of the divine unity.

The First Truth: That of Grandeur and Sublimity {25}

THE FIRST TRUTH: that of Grandeur and Sublimity.

Since this truth is explained with different proofs in the Second Station 
of the Second Ray and various other places in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , we restrict 
ourselves here to the following:

The  Being  that  creates  and  then  administers  at  a  single  time  and  in  a 
single fashion the stars that are thousands of years distant from each other; 
that creates at a single time and in a single form the countless members of 
the same species of ﬂower, distributed over the east and the west, the north 
and  south  of  the  globe;  that  administers,  nurtures,  quickens,  distinguishes 
and  adorns  more  than  two  hundred  thousand  different  types  of  plant  and 
species of animal in ﬁve or six weeks, with the utmost regularity and equi-
librium,  without  any  confusion,  defect  or  error,  in  order  to  provide  every 
spring on the face of the earth more than a hundred thousand specimens of 
the supreme resurrection, and thus prove before man’s eyes a remarkable 
event, now belonging to the past and the realm of the Unseen, namely the 
creation of the heavens and the earth in six days, as indicated in the verse,

( 57:4 )  ( ' & % $ # " !

the Being that causes the earth to revolve, as evidenced in the verse,

( 31:29 ) Z Y X W V U T S
and turns the night into the page on which the events of the day are written  –  
this same Being knows and administers according to His own will, all at the 
same time, the most secret and obscure thoughts that occur to men’s hearts. 
Since each of the aforementioned acts is in reality one act, it follows that 
their Glorious Doer is a Unique and Powerful Being, enjoying such grandeur 
and sublimity that nowhere, in nothing, in no way, does it leave the slightest 

THE SUPREME SIGN – SECOND CHAPTER

181

possibility for the acceptance of partnership; on the contrary, it uproots all 
such possibility.

Since such sublime power and grandeur exist and since that grandeur is 
at the very apex of perfection and comprehends everything, it is certainly in 
no way possible to permit or allow any attribution of partners to that Unique 
and Powerful Being, for so doing would ascribe impotence or need to that 
power, fault to that grandeur, defect to that perfection, and impose restric-
tion on that comprehensiveness. No sound intellect could deem this possible.
The assignment of partners to Allah, is then by virtue of the offence it 
causes to Allah’s grandeur, the dignity of his glory and His sublimity, so 
grave a crime that the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition decrees with an ear-
nest threat,  4:48 ) ~ } | { z y x w v u t s r )

The Second Truth: The absoluteness of the dominical deeds {26}

THE  SECOND  TRUTH:  The  absoluteness,  the  comprehensiveness, 
and appearance in inﬁnite form of the dominical deeds seen at work in the 
cosmos.

It is only Allah’s wisdom and will that limits and restricts those deeds, as 
well as the inherent capacities of the objects and places in which they mani-
fest themselves. Stray chance, dumb nature, blind force, unconscious causal-
ity and the elements that without restriction are scattered in every direction  –  
none of these can have any part in the most balanced, wise perspicacious, 
life- giving, orderly and ﬁrm deeds of the Creator. They are used, rather, by 
the command, will, and power of the Glorious Doer as an apparent veil to 
conceal His power.

Three out of innumerable examples:
We will set forth three from among the numerous subtle points that relate 

to the three deeds indicated in three continuous verses in Sura al-Nahl.

The First Verse

T h e   F i r s t :

( 16:68 )  _ ^ ] \ [ Z Y X W
The bee is, with respect to its disposition and function, such a miracle of 
Allah’s power that a whole sura, Sura al-Nahl, has been named after it. For 
to inscribe in the minute head of that little honey- machine a complete pro-
gramme for the fulﬁlment of its important task; to place in its diminutive 
stomach the most delicious of foods and to ripen it there; to place in its sting 
poison  capable  of  destroying  and  killing  animate  beings,  without  causing 
any harm to its own body or the member in question  –  to do all this without 
the utmost care and knowledge, with exceeding wisdom and purposiveness, 

182

THE RAYS

partakes of a perfect orderliness and equilibrium, and hence unconscious, 
disorderly, disequilibriated nature and accident could never interfere or par-
ticipate in any of this.

The appearance and comprehensiveness of this divine craft, this domini-
cal  deed,  which  is  miraculous  in  three  separate  respects,  in  the  countless 
bees that are found scattered over the earth, with the same wisdom, the same 
care, the same symmetry, at the same time and in the same fashion  –  this is 
a self-evident proof of Allah’s unity.

This verse is a decree overﬂowing with useful instruction. To place in the 
nipples of cows, camels, goats and sheep, as well as human mothers, in the 
midst of blood and excrement but without being polluted by them, a sub-
stance the exact opposite, pure, clean, pleasant, nutritive and white milk, 
and  to  inspire  in  their  hearts  tenderness  toward  their  young  that  is  still 
more pleasant, sweeter and more valuable than milk  –  this requires such a 
degree of mercy, wisdom, knowledge, power, will and care that it cannot 
in any way be the work of turbulent chance, of the tangled elements, or of 
blind forces.

The manifestation, workings and comprehensiveness of so miraculous a 
dominical art and so wise a divine deed, all over the face of the globe and 
in the countless hearts and breasts of innumerable mothers of hundreds of 
thousands of species, in the same instant, the same fashion, with the same 
wisdom  and  the  same  care   –   this  too  constitutes  a  self-evident  proof  of 
Allah’s unity.

This verse invites our attention to the date and to grapes, saying, “ For 
those  of  intelligence,  there  is  great  proof,  argument  and  evidence  of  the 
divine  unity  in  these  two  fruits.  These  two  fruits  yield  nurture  and  suste-
nance, fresh and dry fruit, and give rise to most delicious forms of food; yet 
the trees that bear them stand in waterless sand and dry soil, and are thus

miracles  of  power  and  wonders  of  wisdom.  They  are  each  of  them  like  a 
factory producing sweet sugar, a machine manufacturing honeylike syrup, 
a work of art created with perfect order and sensitive balance, wisdom and 
care; hence anyone with a grain of intelligence will say on contemplating 
them, ‘The one who made them in this fashion may very well be the Creator 
of the whole cosmos.’ ”

For in front of our eyes each vine branch the thickness of a ﬁnger will 
hold twenty bunches of grapes, and each bunch will in turn contain hundreds 
of sugary grapes, each like a litle pump emitting syrup. To clothe the surface 
of each grape with a ﬁne, delicate, thin, and colourful protection; to place 
in its delicate and soft heart seeds with their hard shells, which are like its 
retentive faculty, programme, and the story of its life; to manufacture in its 
stomach a sweetmeat like the helva of Paradise, a honey like the water of 
Kawthar; to create an inﬁnite number of such grapes over the face of the 
entire earth, with the same care and wisdom and wonderful art, and at the 
same time and in the same fashion  –  this proves in self-evident fashion that 
the one who fulﬁls these tasks is the Creator of the whole cosmos, and this 
deed, requiring as it does inﬁnite power and limitless wisdom, can be only 
His deed.

Yes,  blind  and  stray,  disorderly  and  unconscious,  aimless,  aggressive, 
and anarchic forces, nature and causality, cannot have anything to do with 
this  most  sensitive  balance,  this  most  skilful  art,  this  most  wise  scheme. 
They cannot even stretch out their hands toward it. It falls to them only to 
be employed through the dominical command as passive objects, as curtain-
holders.

Just like the three points proving divine unity contained in the three truths 
indicated in the three verses, the countless manifestations and workings of 
inﬁnite  dominical  deeds  attest  unanimously  the  unity  of  a  Single  One  of 
Unity, the All-Glorious One.

The Third Truth: The Ease, Speed, and Order of Creation {27}

THE THIRD TRUTH: The creation of beings, particularly plants and 
animals,  with  absolute  speed  and  absolute  orderliness;  with  absolute  ease 
and extreme skill, talent, ability, and order; with great value and distinction, 
despite extreme abundance and intermingling.

Yes, to produce with extreme swiftness and in extreme abundance, most 
skilfully  and  artistically,  with  great  ease  and  facility  combined  with  the 
utmost care and orderliness, with great value and distinction despite abun-
dance and intermingling, without any form of confusion or deﬁciency  –  this 
can be achieved only by a Unique Being Whose power is such that nothing 
appears difﬁcult to it.

184

THE RAYS

For that power it is as easy to create stars as atoms, the greatest as the 
smallest, a whole species as a single member of a species, a sublime and 
comprehensive universal as a restricted and petty particular; it is as easy for 
Him to revivify and quicken the whole earth as to do the same with a tree or 
to erect a tree as tall as a mountain as it is to produce a seed no bigger than a 
ﬁngernail. All of these deeds He performs in front of our eyes.

So  the  exposition,  the  solution,  the  uncovering  and  proof  of  the  mys-
tery of this degree of the assertion of the divine unity, this Third Truth, this 
word  of  unity   –   the  mystery  that  the  greatest  universal  is  like  the  small-
est particular without the slightest difference between them  – this beneﬁcial 
wisdom, this supreme talisman, this riddle beyond the reach of the intellect, 
this most signiﬁcant foundation of Islam, this most profound source of faith, 
this greatest basis of the divine unity –  the setting forth of all this opens the 
talisman of the Qur’an, and makes it possible to know the most secret and 
unknowable riddle of the creation of all beings, a riddle that reduces philoso-
phy to impotence.

Thanks and praise be one hundred thousand times to the Compassion-
ate Creator to the number of the letters of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , that the R i s a l e -
i   N u r   has  solved,  uncovered  and  established  this  wondrous  talisman,  this 
wondrous riddle. It has been proven with decisive arguments, to the same 
degree of certainty that twice two is four, particularly in the discussion of 
ِلـُ(cid:166) ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) َوُ(cid:182)َو toward the end of the Twentieth Letter; in the section 
ٌر(cid:192) ِدَ(cid:162)  ٍء ْىَ(cid:130)  ّ
concerning Allah’s being an all-powerful agent in the Twenty-Ninth Word, 
one devoted to the resurrection; and in the section proving the divine power 
ّ(cid:195)َا in the Twenty-Ninth Flash, written in Arabic. 
in the degrees of ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ
For that reason we assign to those parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  the exposition of 
this matter, wishing, however, to set out brieﬂy the foundations and proofs 
that solve this mystery and to allude to thirteen mysteries that resemble thir-
teen steps, or a list of contents. I have indeed written the ﬁrst and second 
mysteries, but unfortunately two powerful obstacles, material and immate-
rial, have caused me to abandon the remainder.

First Mystery

T h e   F i r s t   M y s t e r y :  If something be essential, its opposite cannot have 
access to the essence deﬁned by that thing. For that would be equivalent to 
the union of opposites, which is an absurdity. Now with regard to this prin-
ciple, since Allah’s power is related to His Essence and is an essential con-
comitant of His Most Sacred Essence, impotence  – the opposite of power –  
cannot in any way gain access to that All-Powerful Essence.

ٰ
THE SUPREME SIGN – SECOND CHAPTER

185

Moreover, the existence of degrees within a thing comes about through 
the intervention in it of its opposite. For example, strong and weak degrees 
of light result from the intervention of darkness; high and low degrees of heat 
proceed from the admixture of coldness; and greater and lesser amounts of 
strength are determined by the intervention and opposition of resistance. It 
is therefore impossible that degrees should exist in that power of the Divine 
Essence. He creates all things as if they were but a single thing. And since 
degrees do not exist in the power of the Divine Essence and it does not admit 
of weakness or deﬁciency, no obstacle can in any way obstruct it nor can the 
creation of anything cause it difﬁculty.

Since, then, nothing is difﬁcult for Allah’s power, He creates the supreme 
resurrection with the same ease as spring; spring with the same facility as a 
tree; and a tree with as little trouble as a ﬂower. Further, He creates a ﬂower 
as artistically as a tree; a tree as miraculously as a spring; and a spring as 
comprehensively and wondrously as a resurrection. All of this He accom-
plishes in front of our eyes.

It has been proved in the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  with decisive and strong proofs 
that if there were no divine unity, the making of a ﬂower would be as dif-
ﬁcult as a tree or even more difﬁcult; the making of a tree would be as hard 
a spring or even more difﬁcult; and creation would even lose its value and 
artistic quality. An animate being that now takes a minute to produce would 
be produced with difﬁculty in one year, or maybe never at all.

It is then on account of this mystery that these fruits, ﬂowers, trees and 
animals, that are extremely valuable despite their ubiquitousness and abun-
dance, and extremely artistic despite the swiftness and ease of their fashion-
ing, emerge in regular fashion onto the plain of being and assume their func-
tions.  Proclaiming  Allah’s  glory,  they  accomplish  their  duties  and  depart, 
leaving behind their seed in their stead.

Second Mystery

S e c o n d    M y s t e r y :  Through the mystery of luminosity, transparency, and 
obedience, just as through the manifestation of its essential power, a single 
sun reﬂects its light in a single mirror, so too, through the divine command 
and  due  to  the  extensive  activity  of  that  unrestricted  power,  it  can  easily 
bestow the same reﬂection  – together with its light and heat –  on innumer-
able  mirrors,  shining  objects,  and  droplets.  Great  and  small  are  the  same, 
there is no difference between them.

Similarly, like a single word can enter the ear of one man without trou-
ble, so too due to the inﬁnite breadth of boundless creativity, it may enter 
a million ears, with dominical permission. And a single light like an eye, 

186

THE RAYS

or a single luminous spirit being like Gabriel, through the inﬁnite breadth of 
dominical activity within the manifestation of mercy, may be present in, or 
look at, or enter thousands of places through divine power, as easily as they 
look at or enter a single place. There is no difference between many and few.
The pre-eternal power of Allah’s essence is the most subtle and choicest 
of lights, the light of all lights; the quiddities, essences and inner dimensions 
of all things are luminous and lustrous as mirrors; all things, from the atom, 
the plant, and the animate creature to the stars, the suns and the moons, are 
extremely  obedient  and  submissive  to  the  command  of  that  power  of  the 
Divine Essence and subordinate to the orders of that pre-eternal power. It 
is  for  all  of  these  reasons  entirely  natural  that  innumerable  things  should 
be created with the same ease as a single thing and placed side by side with 
each  other.  No  concern  or  task  interferes  with  another.  Great  and  small, 
many and few, particular and universal  –  all are the same for that power, for 
which nothing is difﬁcult.

As was said in the Tenth and Twenty-Ninth Words, through the myster-
ies of order, equilibrium, obedience to command and submission to order, 
that  power  causes  a  great  ship  as  big  as  a  hundred  houses,  to  move  and 
advance as a child’s ﬁnger pushes his toy.

As a commander will send a single infantryman into battle with an order 
from his throne, so too he may throw a whole obedient army into the fray 
with the same single order.

Let us suppose that two mountains are in a state of equilibrium in a large 
and sensitive balance. In the same way that a single walnut would cause one 
pan to rise and the other to fall if placed on one side of a balance contain-
ing two eggs, it would produce the same result with the scale containing the 
mountains; through a wise law it would cause one pan with its mountain to 
rise to the mountain-top, and the other to descend with its mountain to the 
bottom of the valley.

Since there is to be found in Allah’s absolute, inﬁnite, luminous, essential 
and eternal power a divine justice and unending wisdom that is the origin, 
source, fundament and beginning of all order, regularity and equilibrium in 
creation; and since all things, particular and universal, small and great, are 
obedient to the command of that power and submissive to its workings  –  it 
follows that Allah causes the stars to revolve and to move, through the wis-
dom of His order, as easily as He rotates and moves the atoms.

In spring, just as He brings to life a single ﬂy with a single order, so too 
He bestows life with the same ease and the same command on the whole 

THE SUPREME SIGN – SECOND CHAPTER

187

species of ﬂy, as well as all the hosts of plants and animals, through the mys-
tery of the wisdom and equilibrium inherent in His power, and then sends 
them forth onto the plain of life.

In the same way that he swiftly gives life to a tree in spring and infuses 
vitality in its bones, with His wise and just absolute power, He also resur-
rects in the spring the corpse of the vast earth and brings into being hundreds 
of thousands of different specimens of resurrection similar to the tree, all 
this with the greatest of ease.

With  His  creative  command,  He  brings  the  earth  back  to  life.  By  the 
decree of, Ò Ñ Ð Ï Î Í Ì Ë Ê É  ( 36:53 ) that 
is, “ all men and jinn, with a single cry and command shall be brought to Us 
and made present at the plain of resurrection. ” Again, by His command,

( 16:77 )  « ª © ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ £ 
that  is,  the  bringing  about  of  resurrection  and  the  gathering  that  follows 
upon it shall take no longer than the opening and closing of an eye, or even 

less. Then there is the verse,   â á à ß Þ Ý Ü( 31:28 )  
meaning the following: “ O men! To create you and to bring you to life, to 
resurrect and gather you, is as easy for me as bringing one soul to life; it 
presents no problem to My power. ” According to the inner sense of these 
three verses, Allah will bring all men and jinn, all animals, spirit beings 
and  angels  to  the  ﬁeld  of  the  Supreme  Gathering  and  the  great  balance 
with a single command and with great ease. One concern does not interfere 
with another.

The Fourth Truth: The Perfect Order and Regularity of The Cosmos {28}

The  remaining  Mysteries,  from  the  third  and  fourth  as  far  as  the  thir-
teenth, have been postponed to another time in a fashion disagreeable to me.
THE FOURTH TRUTH: The existence and appearance of all beings 
proclaim the divine unity in a self-evident fashion through their numerous 
points  of  unity  and  convergence,  such  as  being  simultaneously  together 
and yet separate and unique; resembling one another; being the miniature 
or magniﬁed versions of each other; being some, universals and species, 
and some, particulars and individuals; resembling each other in the stamp 
of  innate  disposition;  having  afﬁnity  in  the  impress  of  artistry;  and  aid-
ing and complementing each other with respect to their innate functions. 
They establish the unity of their Maker. And with respect to dominicality, 
make it clear that the cosmos is a universal and a whole that may not be 
divided or fragmented.

THE RAYS

For example, in each spring, to create, order and sustain the innumerable 
members of the four hundred thousand different species of plants and ani-
mals, together and intermingled, in a single moment and in the same fashion, 
without  any  error  or  mistake,  with  the  utmost  wisdom  and  perfection  of 
artistry; to create all the different species of bird, from ﬂies, which are like 
birds in miniature, to eagles which are the supreme specimens of the species, 
then  to  equip  them  with  the  means  of  ﬂight  and  subsistence  and  to  cause 
them to journey through the realm of the air; to imprint on the countenances 
of each of the birds in miraculous fashion a stamp of artistry, on the body 
of each of them a seal of wisdom, and in the quiddity of each of them, in 
sustaining fashion, a sign of Allah’s unity; to cause wisely and mercifully 
particles of food to hasten to the aid of the cells of the body, plants to rush 
to the assistance of animals, and all mothers to go swiftly to the help of their 
powerless infants; to work on all things, particular and universal, from the 
Milky Way, the solar system and the elements of the earth, down to the veils 
of the pupil of the eye, the petals of the rose, the husk of the corn, the seeds 
of the melon, like a series of intersecting circles, with the same regularity, 
perfection of artistry, the same deed, and plenitude of wisdom  –  to do all this 
establishes the following with self-evident certainty:

He who performs these deeds is One and unique; His imprint is on all 
things. In the same way that He is not in any place, He is present in every 
place. Like the sun, all things are distant from Him, but He is close to all 
things.  Just  as  the  greatest  objects,  such  as  the  Milky  Way  and  the  solar 
system,  are  not  difﬁcult  for  Him,  so  too  the  cells  in  man’s  blood  and  the 
thoughts that pass across his heart are not secret from Him nor beyond the 
reach of His power.

However great and multitudinous a thing may be, it is as easy for Him 
as  the  smallest  and  scarcest  thing,  for  He  creates  with  ease  a  ﬂy  on  the 
model  of  an  eagle,  a  seed  in  the  form  of  a  tree,  a  tree  in  the  shape  of  a 
garden, a garden with the artistry of a spring, and a spring on the scale of 
a  resurrection.  Things  most  valuable  in  their  artistry  He  gives  to  us  and 
bestows  upon  us  most  cheaply.  The  price  that  He  asks  of  us  is  merely  to 
ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا  In  other  words,  the  accepted  price  for  all  those

numerous  precious  bounties  is  to  say  at  the  beginning  of  all  things,

The Fifth Truth: The Perfect Order and Regularity of The Cosmos {29}

ٰ

ّ

THE SUPREME SIGN – SECOND CHAPTER

189

THE FIFTH TRUTH: perceived by our traveller at the second stage: 
the existence in the entirety of the cosmos, its pillars and parts and all the 
beings contained in it, of the most perfect order and regularity; the sameness 
of the substances and purposive beings that are the means of the rotation and 
administration of that vast kingdom and are connected to its general scheme; 
the  fact  that  the  divine  names  and  deeds  that  are  at  work  in  that  magnif-
icent  city,  that  vast  exhibition,  encompass  and  comprehend  all  things  or 
most things, despite their being one within the other, and of the same nature, 
and the same, and their being the same name and deed in every place; the 
fact that the elements and species that are the means for the administration, 
inhabiting,  and  construction  of  that  well-adorned  palace,  cover  the  whole 
face of the earth in their diffusion, despite their being one within the other, 
of the same nature, and the same element and the same species being found 
everywhere  –  all of this demands, proves, and afﬁrms, necessarily and self- 
evidently, the following:

The Maker and Disposer of this cosmos, the Monarch and Nurturer of 
this realm, the Master and Builder of this palace, is one, unique, sole. He 
has neither like nor peer, neither minister nor aide. He has neither partner 
nor opposite, he has neither inability nor deﬁciency. Yes, order is in itself a 
perfect expression of unity; it demands a single orderer. It leaves no place 
for the assignment of partners to Allah, the source of dispute and dissension.
There  is  a  wise  and  precise  order  inherent  in  all  things,  whether  uni-
versal or particular, from the total scheme of the cosmos and the daily and 
annual rotation of the earth down to the physiognomy of man, the complex 
of senses in man’s head and the circulation of white and red cells in man’s 
blood. Nothing other than One Absolutely Powerful and Absolutely Wise 
can stretch out its hand intentionally and creatively toward any thing, nor 
interfere with it. On the contrary, all things are recipients, means of mani-
festation, and passive.

Now, ordering, the pursuit of certain purposes and the bestowal of regu-
larity with a view to certain beneﬁts, can be done only by means of knowl-
edge and wisdom and performed only with will and choice.

Certainly  and  in  all  events,  this  wisdom-nurturing  regularity,  this  inﬁ-
nitely varied ordering of the cosmos that before our very eyes assures vari-
ous beneﬁts, proves and afﬁrms to a self-evident degree that the Creator and 
Disposer of all beings is one, an agent possessing will and choice. Everything 
comes into being through His power, assumes a particular state through His 
will, and takes on a particular form through His choice.

THE RAYS

The heat-giving lamp of this hospice that is the world is one; its candle 
that is the basis for the reckoning of time is one; its merciful sponge is one; 
its ﬁery cook is one; its life-giving beverage is one; its well-guarded ﬁeld 
is  one,  as  well  as  a  thousand  and  one  other  instances  of  oneness.  It  fol-
lows from all of these instances of oneness that the Maker and Master of 
this hospice is also one, that He is extremely generous and hospitable, for 
He employs numerous high-ranking and great ofﬁcials to serve the animate 
guests of His hospice.

Names  such  as  All-Wise,  Compassionate,  Giver  of  Forms,  Disposer, 
Quickener, and Nurturer, the impresses and manifestations of which are to 
be  seen  at  work  in  every  corner  of  the  world,  attributes  such  as  wisdom, 
mercy, and grace, and acts such as formation, disposition and nurturing, are 
all one. They embrace every place in the utmost degree, each name and act 
being present there.

They also complement the imprint of each other in such a way that it is as 
if those names and deeds were uniting in such fashion that power becomes 
identical with wisdom and mercy, and wisdom becomes identical with grace 
and  life.  For  example,  as  soon  as  the  activity  of  the  name  of  Quickener 
appears in a thing, the activity of numerous other names such as Creator, 
Giver of Form, and Provider, also appears at the same instant, everywhere, 
and  in  the  same  system.  This  of  a  certainty  and  self-evidently  establishes 
and proves that that which is designated by the names and the Doer of the 
comprehensive deeds that appear everywhere in the same fashion must also 
be one, single and unique. In this we believe and to this we give our assent!
The elements that are the substance and material of creation encompass 
the whole earth. Each of the species of creation that bears an imprint attest-
ing unity is diffused throughout the earth in unity and, so to speak, conquers 
it. This also proves to the degree of being self-evident that those elements 
together with what they embrace, and those species, together with their sep-
arate members, are the product and property of a single being. They are the 
products and servants of so Unique and Powerful a One that He employs 
those vast and and imperious elements as obedient servants and those spe-
cies  diffused  throughout  the  earth  as  well-disciplined  soldiers.  Since  this 
truth also has been established and explained in other places in the R i s a l e - i  
N u r , we content ourselves here with this brief indication.

In  summary  of  the  witnessings  that  he  derived  from  these  ﬁve  truths, 
through  the  superabundance  of  faith  and  the  joy  of  divine  unity,  and  in 
expression of his feelings, our traveller said to his heart:

That world traveller voyaging through different ages chanced upon the 
school of the Renewer of the Second Millennium, Imam-i Rabbani, Ahmad 
Faruqi. He entered and listened to the lesson being taught by the Imam:

“ The most important result yielded by all the Suﬁ paths is the unfolding 
of the truths of belief. The unfolding in clarity of a single truth of belief is 
preferable to a thousand miraculous deeds and mystical visions. ”

The Imam said too:
“ In former times, great persons said that someone will arise from among 
the theologians and the scholars of the science of theology. He will prove all 
the truths of belief and Islam with rational proofs and the utmost clarity. I 
wish to be that man and maybe I am. ” 1

He  continued  his  instruction  by  saying  that  belief  and  the  assertion  of 
divine unity were the foundation, substance, light and life of all human per-
fection; that the Hadith ٍةَ(cid:179)َ(cid:126) ِةَداَ(cid:93)ِ(cid:150)  ْنِ(cid:174) ٌرْ(cid:193)َ(cid:114) ٍةَ(cid:150)اَ(cid:126) ُرُ
ّ(cid:167)َ(cid:159)َ(cid:98) 2 refers to reﬂection on 
belief; and that the silent mode of invocation practised in the Naqshbandi 
Order is a form of this most excellent reﬂection.

The traveller listened with utmost care. He turned and addressed himself 
as follows: “ It is thus that this heroic Imam speaks. To increase the strength 
of one’s belief by as much as an atom is worth more than a ton of gnosis or 
other form of perfection and sweeter than the honey of a hundred visionary 
experiences.

“ On the other hand, the philosophers of Europe have leagued together 
for a thousand years to invent objections and doubts in their hostility to faith 
and the Qur’an, and to attack the believers. They wish to shake the pillars 
of belief that are the key, the source, the foundation of everlasting felicity, 

1.  Time has proven that the man referred to here is not in fact an individual, but the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  itself. It maybe that the people of unveiling happened to notice the insigniﬁ-
cant interpreter and proclaimer of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and hence came to speak of “ a man. ”

of life immortal, of eternal Paradise. We ought therefore to strengthen our 
belief by making it one of realization instead of one of imitation. So come, 
let us advance! In order to bring the twenty-nine degrees of faith that we 
have found, each as powerful as a mountain, to the blessed number of thirty-
three, the number of litanies that follow upon prayer, and in order to see a 
third stopping-place in this realm of instruction, let us knock at the door of 
the dominical sustenance of the animate world and open it with the key of 
ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92)  ” Speaking thus he beseechingly knocked at the gate 
ِم(cid:193) ِ(cid:110)َ
of this Third Stopping-Place, a compendium of wonders, and a spectacle of 
marvels.

Saying,

became  visible  to  him.  He  entered  and  saw  that  it  was  illumined  by  four 
great and encompassing truths that demonstrated the divine unity as brightly 
as the sun.

The First Truth: The Truth of Opening {30}

THE FIRST TRUTH: the Truth of Opening

That is, the opening up from a single simple substance of innumerable 
varied and separate forms, together, everywhere, in a single instant and by a 
single deed, through the manifestation of the name of Opener.

Yes, in the same way that Allah’s creative power has opened up innumer-
able beings like ﬂowers in the garden of the cosmos, and endowed each with 
an orderly form and distinct identity, through the manifestation of the name 
of Opener, so too, although in more miraculous fashion, He has given to the 
four hundred thousand species of animate beings in the garden of the earth 
each its symmetrical, adorned and distinct form.

As these two verses indicate, the strongest proof of divine unity and the most 
remarkable miracle of divine power is Allah’s opening up of forms. Because 
the opening of forms is repeatedly established and expounded in different 
ways elsewhere in the R i s a l e - i  N u r , and particularly in the Sixth and Seventh

THE RAYS

Degrees of the First Chapter of the Second Station of this treatise, we refer 
the discussion of this matter to those places and restrict ourselves here to the 
following:

According  to  the  testimony  of  botany  and  biology,  based  on  profound 
research, there is in the opening and unfolding of forms, such comprehen-
siveness and artistry that other than a Single and Unique One, One Abso-
lutely  Powerful,  able  to  see  and  do  all  things  in  all  things,  no  one  could 
undertake this comprehensive and all-embracing deed. For this deed of the 
unfolding of forms demands a wisdom, an attention and a comprehensive-
ness that are present at all times and are contained within an inﬁnite power. 
This power, in turn, can be found only in that Unique Being Who adminis-
ters the whole cosmos.

As  is  decreed  in  the  above-quoted  verses,  Allah’s  attribute  of  opening 
expressed in the opening and creation of the forms of men from their moth-
er’s wombs, within three darknesses, separately, with equilibrium, distinct-
ness, and order, without any error, confusion, or mistake; this truth of the 
unfolding of the forms of all men and animals, all over the earth, with the 
same  power,  the  same  wisdom  and  the  same  artistry,  is  a  most  powerful 
proof of Allah’s unity. For to comprehend and embrace all things is itself a 
form of unity that leaves no room for the assignation of partners to Allah. 
Just as the nineteen Truths of the First Chapter bearing witness to the neces-
sary existence of Allah also attest the existence of the Creator through their 
own existence, so too they bear witness to His unity through their compre-
hensiveness. Our traveller then saw the following Second Truth in the Third 
Stopping-Place:

The Second Truth: The Truth of Mercifulness {31}

THE SECOND TRUTH: the Truth of Mercifulness

We see with our own eyes that there is one who has covered the face of 
the earth with thousands of gifts of mercy, and made it into a feasting-place. 
He has laid out a spread of hundreds of thousands of the different delicious 
foods of mercifulness, and made the inside of the earth a storehouse contain-
ing thousands of precious bounties of compassionateness and wisdom. That 
Being sends to us also the earth, in its yearly rotation, like a ship or a train, 
laden with the ﬁnest of the hundreds of thousands of vital human necessities, 
proceeding from the World of the Unseen; and He sends to us too the spring, 
like a waggon carrying food and clothing for us. Thus does He nurture us, 
with utmost compassion. In order for us to proﬁt from those gifts and boun-
ties, He has moreover given us hundreds and thousands of appetities, needs, 
feelings, sensations and senses.

THE SUPREME SIGN – SECOND CHAPTER

195

As  was  set  forth  in  the  Fourth  Ray  concerning  the  verse  on  the  sufﬁ-
ciency of Allah, He has given us a stomach that can take pleasure in inﬁnite 
varieties of food.

He  has  given  us  such  a  life  that  through  the  senses  associated  with  it 
we can derive beneﬁt from the innumerable bounties of the vast corporeal 
world, just as if it were some bounteous spread.

He has favoured us with the human state so that we delight in the bound-
less gifts of both the spiritual and material worlds, through instruments such 
as the intellect and the heart.

He has conveyed Islam to us so that we derive light from the boundless 

treasuries of the Unseen and Manifest Realms.

He has guided us to faith so that we are illumined by the innumerable 
lights  and  gifts  of  this  world  and  the  hereafter.  This  cosmos  is  like  a 
palace ﬁtted out and adorned by the divine quality of mercy with innu-
merable antiques and valuable items, which then gives to man’s hands 
the  keys  to  open  all  the  chests  and  chambers  in  that  palace,  as  well  as 
bestowing on man’s nature all the needs and senses that will enable him 
to make use of them.

This  mercy  that  embraces  this  world  and  the  hereafter,  and  indeed  all 

things, is without doubt a manifestation of oneness within unity.

Just as the light of the sun is a parable of unity, through its comprehend-
ing all things that face it, every bright and transparent object that receives 
the reﬂection of the light, heat, and seven colours of the sun, is also a parable 
and a symbol of oneness. Hence, whoever sees its all- embracing light will 
conclude that the sun of this earth is one and unique. Witnessing the warm 
and luminous reﬂection of the sun in all bright objects, and even in drops 
of water, he will say that the oneness of the sun, or the sun itself, is present 
with its attributes close to all things; it is at the mirrorlike heart of all things.
So too the encompassing of all things by the extensive mercy of the Mer-
ciful  One  of  Beauty,  like  a  light,  demonstrates  the  unity  of  that  Merciful 
One and that He in no way has any partner. Similarly, the fact that under 
the veil of that all-embracing mercy the lights of most of the Merciful One’s 
names and a sort of manifestation of His essence are found in everything, 
and  especially  in  all  living  beings,  and  in  man  in  particular,  and  the  fact 
that this gives each individual a comprehensiveness arising from life which 
causes him to look to and be related to the whole universe, proves the one-
ness of the Merciful One and that He is present with all things and does all 
things in all things.

196

THE RAYS

Yes, the Merciful One shows the splendour of His glory in the whole of 
the cosmos and all over the earth through the unity and comprehensiveness 
of His mercy. With the manifestation of His oneness, He gathers together in 
every member of all animate species, and particularly man, specimens of all 
His bounties, orders the tools and instruments of animate beings, and pro-
claims the special solicitude of His beauty to each individual, this without 
shattering the wholeness of the universe. As for man, it is in him that Allah 
makes known in concentrated form the various forms of His bounty.

Similarly, a melon can be said to be concentrated in its seed; the being 
that  makes  the  seed  must  necessarily  be  he  who  makes  the  melon.  Then, 
with the special balance of his knowledge and the particular law of his wis-
dom, he draws the seed out from it, gathers it together and clothes it in a 
body. Nothing other than the one and unique master craftsman who makes 
the melon is able to make its seed. That would be impossible.

Since  through  the  manifestation  of  mercifulness  the  cosmos  becomes 
like a tree or a garden, the earth becomes like a fruit or a melon, and man 
becomes like a seed, of a certainty the Creator and Sustainer of the smallest 
animate being must be the Creator of all the earth and all the cosmos.

I n   S h o r t :  just  as  the  making  and  unfolding  of  the  regular  and  orderly 
forms of all beings through the truth of Opening, which is comprehensive, 
proves unity to the point of being self- evident, so too the truth of Merci-
fulness, which encompasses all things, through its nurturing of all animate 
beings that come into existence and enter the life of this world, particularly 
the newly arrived, with the utmost order and regularity, causing all neces-
sities to reach them, forgetting none of them, this same mercy reaching all 
individuals  everywhere  at  the  same  instant  demonstrates  both  unity,  and 
oneness  within  unity.  Since  the  Risale-i  Nur  is  the  manifestation  of  the 
names of All-Wise and All-Compassionate and in many places ﬁne points 
and ﬂashes of the reality of divine mercy are elucidated and proved, here 
we make allusion to that ocean with a single droplet and cut that long story 
short. Our traveller then witnessed the following Third Truth in the Third 
Stopping-Place

The Third Truth: The Truth of Disposing and Administering {32}

THE THIRD TRUTH: the Truth of Disposing and Administering

That is, to administer with complete order and equilibrium both the awe-
some  and  swift-  moving  heavenly  bodies  and  imperious,  interfering  ele-
ments,  and  the  needy,  weak  denizens  of  earth;  to  cause  them  to  aid  each 
other;  to  administer  them  jointly  with  each  other;  to  take  all  necessary 

THE SUPREME SIGN – SECOND CHAPTER

197

measures concerning them; and to make this vast world like a perfect king-
dom, a magniﬁcent city, a well-adorned palace.

Leaving side the vast spheres of this imperious and merciful administra-
tion, since it is explained and proved in important sections of the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r  such as the Tenth Word, we will show, by means of a comparison, a 
single page and stage of that administration as it manifests itself in the spring 
on the face of the earth.

Let  us  suppose,  for  example,  that  some  wondrous  world  conqueror 
assembled an army from four hundred thousand different groups and nation-
alities, and supplied the clothes and weapons, the instructions and dismiss-
als  and  salaries  of  every  group  and  nationality,  separately  and  variously, 
without any defect or shortcoming, without error or mistake, at the proper 
time, without any delay or confusion, with the utmost regularity and in most 
perfect form, no cause other than the extraordinary power of that wondrous 
commander could stretch out is hand to attempt that vast, complex, subtle, 
balanced,  multitudinous  and  just  administration.  Were  it  to  stretch  out  its 
hand, it would destroy the equilibrium and cause confusion.

So too we see with our own eyes that an unseen hand creates and admin-
isters every spring a magniﬁcent army composed of four hundred thousand 
different species. In the autumn  – an example of the day of resurrection –  it 
dismisses three hundred thousand out of those four hundred thousand spe-
cies of plants and animals from their duties, and they go on leave through the 
activity of death and in the name of decease.

In spring  – a sample of the gathering that follows resurrection –  it con-
structs  three  hundred  thousand  examples  of  raising  from  the  dead  in  the 
space of a few weeks, with the utmost order and discipline. In the case of 
the tree, four such resurrections take place with respect to the tree itself, its 
leaves, its ﬂowers, and its fruits. After showing spring to our eyes exactly 
like the preceding one, it gives each species and group in that army of glory 
that  contains  four  hundred  thousand  different  species  its  appropriate  sus-
tenance  and  provision,  its  defensive  weapons  and  distinctive  garments, 
its  orders  and  dismissals,  and  all  the  tools  and  instruments  it  needs,  with 
the utmost order and regularity, without error or slip, without confusion or 
omission, in unexpected fashion and at the proper time. It thus proves its 
unity, oneness, uniqueness, and inﬁnite power and boundless mercy within 
perfection of dominicality, sovereignty and wisdom, and writes with the pen 
of divine determining this proclamation of divine unity on the face of the 
earth, on the page of every spring.

198

THE RAYS

After reading only a single page of this proclamation of one spring, our 

traveller said to himself:

“ The torment of Hell-ﬁre is pure justice for those who commit the error 
of denying resurrection. For such denial would be to refute the numerous 
promises and to deny the power of One Powerful and Compelling, a Wrath-
ful One of Glory, Who has promised and assured all of His prophets thou-
sands of times and set forth in thousands of verses of the Qur’an, explicity 
and by way of allusion, that He will bring about a resurrection and gathering 
far easier for Him than the thousands of miraculous gatherings that occur 
every spring, each more wondrous than the Supreme Gathering. ” His soul 
responded: “ We believe in what you say. ”

The Fourth Truth: The Truth of Compassionateness and Bestowal of Provision {33}

THE FOURTH TRUTH, which forms the Thirty-Third Degree: the Truth 
of Compassionateness and Bestowal of Provision

That is, the giving, over the whole face of the globe, within the earth, 
in the air above it and the ocean around it, to all animate beings, especially 
those  endowed  with  spirit,  and  among  them  especially  the  impotent,  the 
weak and the young, all of their necessary sustenance, material and immate-
rial, in the most solicitous manner, deriving it from dry and rude soil, from 
solid, bonelike dry pieces of wood, and in the case of the most delicate of 
all forms of sustenance, from between blood and urine, at the proper time, 
in orderly fashion, without any omission or confusion, in front of our eyes, 
by an unseen hand.
Yes, the verse,

restricts to Allah the task of sustaining and providing, and the verse,

( 51:58 )  Z Y X W V U T

 .- , + * ) ( ' & % $ # " 
( 11:6 )  2 1 0 /
provides a dominical guarantee and pledge to furnish provision for all men 
and animals. Similarly, the verse,

( 29:60 ) { z y x w v u t s r q p o
establishes  and  proclaims  that  it  is  Allah  Who  guarantees  and  provides 
for  all  impotent,  powerless,  weak  and  wretched  creatures  that  are  unable 
to secure their own sustenance, in an unexpected fashion, indeed from the

on the ocean bed and their young. This proclamation is directed in particular 
to those men who worship causes and are unaware that it is He who bestows 
provision from behind the veil of causality. Numerous other verses of the 
Qur’an  and  innumerable  pieces  of  cosmic  evidence  unanimously  demon-
strate that it is the compassionateness of a single Glorious Provider that nur-
tures all animate beings.

Now the trees require a certain form of sustenance but have neither power 
nor will. They remain therefore in their places, trusting in Allah, and their 
provision comes hastening to them. So too the sustenance of infants ﬂows 
to  their  mouths  from  wondrous  small  pumps,  aided  by  the  solicitude  and 
tenderness  of  their  mothers.  Then  when  the  infants  acquire  a  little  power 
and  will,  the  milk  ceases.  These  various  instances  clearly  prove  that  licit 
sustenance is not proportionate to will and power, but comes in relation to 
weakness and impotence, which induce trust in Allah.

Will, power and cleverness frequently incite greed, which is a source of 
loss, and often push certain learned men toward a form of beggary, whereas 
by contrast the trusting weakness of the boorish, crude and common man 
may cause him to attain riches.

The proverb, 

 اً(cid:162)وُزْرَ(cid:174) ُهاَ(cid:163)ْ(cid:171)َ(cid:98)  ٍلِ(cid:182)اَ(cid:106)  ٍلِ(cid:182)اَ(cid:106)َو     ُهُ(cid:93)ِ(cid:182)اَذَ(cid:174)  ْتَ(cid:193)ْ(cid:150)َا ٍمـِ(cid:170)اَ(cid:150) ٍمـِ(cid:170)اَ(cid:150) ْمﯬﯦ
establishes that licit provision is not won by power and will, but by a mercy 
that ﬁnds working and striving acceptable; it is bestowed by a tenderness 
that takes pity on need.

Now provision and sustenance is of two kinds:
The First is true and natural provision, that required for life; this is guar-
anteed  by  the  Sustainer.  It  is  indeed  so  regular  and  well-ordered  that  this 
natural provision, stored in the body in the form of fat and other things, is 
enough to ensure survival for at least twenty days, even if nothing is eaten. 
Those who apparently die of hunger before the twenty or thirty days are up 
and before the provision stored up in their body is exhausted, die in reality 
not from a lack of provision, but from a disease arising from lack of caution 
and the disturbance of ﬁxed habit.

The  Second  Form  of  Provision: metaphorical  and  artiﬁcal  provision, 
arising due to addiction from habit, wastefulness and misuse, but acquiring 
the appearance of necessity. This form is not guaranteed by the Sustainer, 
but depends on His generosity: sometimes He may give it, sometimes He 
may not give it.

200

THE RAYS

With respect to this second form of provision and sustenance, happy is he 
who regards his frugality  – a source of happiness and pleasure –  contentment 
and licit striving, as a form of worship and active prayer for sustenance. He 
accepts Allah’s bounty gratefully and appreciatively, and passes his life in 
happpy fashion.

Wretched  is  he  who  on  account  of  prodigality   – the  source  of  wretch-
edness and loss –  and greed, abandons licit striving, knocks at every door, 
passes  his  life  in  sloth,  oppression  and  wretchedness,  and  indeed  puts  his 
own life to death.

In  the  same  way  that  a  stomach  requires  sustenance,  so  too  the  subtle 
capacities  and  senses  of  man,  his  heart,  spirit,  intelligence,  eye,  ear  and 
mouth, also request their sustenance from the Compassionate Provider and 
gratefully receive it. To each of them separately and in appropriate form is 
presented such provision from the treasury of mercy as will rejoice them and 
give them pleasure. Indeed, the Compassionate Provider, in order to give to 
them provision in more generous measure has created each of man’s subtle 
capacities  – eye and ear, heart, imagination, and intellect –  in the form of a 
key to His treasury of mercy. For example, the eye is a key to the treasury 
containing such precious jewels as the fairness and beauty to be seen on the 
face of the universe, and the same holds true of all the others mentioned; 
they all beneﬁt through faith. To resume after our digression:

The All-Powerful and Wise One Who created this cosmos created also 
life  as  a  comprehensive  summary  of  the  cosmos,  and  concentrated  all  of 
His  purposes  and  the  manifestations  of  His  names  therein.  So  too,  within 
the realm of life, He made of provision a comprehensive centre of activity 
and created within animate beings the taste for provision, thus causing ani-
mate beings to respond to His dominicality and love with a permanent and 
universal gratitude, thankfulness, and worship that is one of the signiﬁcant 
purposes and instances of wisdom inherent in the creation of the universe.

For  example,  it  is  one  of  the  activities  of  dominicality  to  cause  every 
area of the broad realm of dominicality to rejoice  –  the heavens are caused 
to rejoice with the angels and spirit beings, the World of the Unseen with 
spirits,  and  the  material  world,  particularly  the  air  and  the  earth,  with  the 
existence  of  all  animate  beings,  particularly  birds,  great  and  small,  at  all 
times  and  places.  Through  the  wisdom  of  this  causing  to  rejoice  and  the 
infusion of life and spirit, animals and men are, as it were, whipped by the 
need for provision and the pleasure they take therein to pursue their provi-
sion and sustenance, thus being delivered from sloth. This too is one of the 

THE SUPREME SIGN – SECOND CHAPTER

201

wise activities of dominicality. Were it not for such signiﬁcant instances of 
wisdom, the provision destined for animals would be caused instinctively to 
hasten toward them to satisfy their needs, without any effort on their part, 
just as provision and sustenance is caused to hasten toward the tree.

Were there to be an eye capable of witnessing and comprehending the 
whole  surface  of  the  earth  at  one  time,  in  order  to  perceive  the  beauties 
of the names of Compassionate and Provider and the witness they bear to 
divine unity, it would see what sweet beauty is contained in the tender and 
solicitous  manifestation  of  the  Compassionate  Provider  Who  sends  to  the 
caravans of animals at the end of winter, when their provision is about to 
be exhausted, extremely delicious, abundant and varied foods and bounties, 
drawn exclusively from His unseen treasury of mercy, as succour from the 
unseen and divine generosity, placed in the hands of plants, the crowns of 
trees, and the breasts of mothers. The possessor of that all-seeing eye would 
realize the following:

The making of a single apple, and the generous giving of it to a man as 
true  sustenance  and  provision,  can  be  accomplished  only  by  a  being  who 
causes the seasons, the nights and the days to rotate, who causes the globe 
to revolve like a cargo ship, and thus brings the fruits of the seasons within 
reach of those needy guests of the earth who stand waiting for them. For the 
stamp of its nature, the seal of wisdom, the imprint of eternal besoughted-
ness, the signet of mercy that is to be found on the surface of the apple, is to 
be found also on all apples and other fruits, plants and animals. Hence the 
true Master and Maker of the apple is bound to be the Glorious Sovereign, 
the Beauteous Creator of all the inhabitants of the world, who are the peers, 
the congeners and the brothers of the apple; of the vast earth that is the gar-
den of the apple; of the tree of the cosmos that is its factory; of the seasons 
that  are  its  workshop;  and  of  the  spring  and  summer  that  are  its  place  of 
maturing.

In other words, every fruit is a seal of unity that makes known the Writer 
and Maker of the earth, its tree, and of the book of the universe, its garden; 
it demonstrates His unity, and shows to the number of fruits, the seal afﬁxed 
to the decree of unity.

Since the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  is a manifestation of the names of All-Compas-
sionate  and  All-Wise,  and  numerous  ﬂashes  and  mysteries  of  the  truth  of 
Compassionateness have been expounded and proved in many parts of the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  we  leave  further  discussion  of  the  matter  to  those  parts  and 
content ourselves with this brief indication, out of a vast treasury, on account 
of the unfavourable circumstances from which we are now suffering.

THE RAYS

Our traveller now says: “ Praise be to Allah! I have seen and heard Thirty-
Three  Truths  bearing  witness  to  the  necessary  existence  and  unity  of  the 
Creator and Sovereign I was everywhere seeking and enquiring after. Each 
of the truths is bright as the sun and leaves no darkness behind. It is as strong 
and unshakeable as a mountain. Each of them, with its veriﬁcations, bears 
decisive  witness  to  His  existence,  and  with  its  comprehensiveness  proves 
His  unity  in  manifest  fashion.  While  proving  implicitly  all  the  pillars  of 
faith, the totality and consensus of these truths causes our belief to advance 
from  imitation  to  realization,  from  realization  to  knowledge  of  certainty, 
from knowledge of certainty to vision of certainty, and from vision of cer-
tainty to absolute certainty. Praise be to Allah; this is from the bounty of my 
Sustainer. ”

NOTE

Since the other parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  were not available 
in the place that saw the composition of the foregoing treatise, 
which  was  of  necessity  written  down  here,  certain  important 
matters  of  T h e   Wo r d s   and  T h e   F l a s h e s   have  been  mentioned 
also in T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n , in what is an apparent repetition. In 
order to have the students of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  in this area write 
a complete R i s a l e - i   N u r  in miniature, we nonetheless had them 
write down all the present treatise.

The revised copy of this rough draft was written by a certain 
blessed person. Even though he was ignorant of such matters, 
we saw in the copy prepared by him a subtle and profound cor-
respondence of the letters: there were six hundred and sixty-six 
a l i f s   1  written  at  the  beginning  of  the  lines  in  his  copy.  This 
number corresponds fully with the value according to the a b j a d  
of the title given to this treatise by Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be 
pleased  with  him ),  Ay a t   a l - K u b r a   (   T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n   ) ,  and 
thus demonstrates the suitability of this title for the treatise. We 
also  understood  this  numerical  correspondence  to  be  an  indi-
cation that this treatise is a ﬂash derived from the light of the 
verses of the Qur’an for they are six thousand six hundred and 
sixty-six in number.

ON THE PURPOSE OF
THE RISALE-I NUR 

Today, I listened to an imaginary exchange of question and answer. Let 

me set forth for you a summary of it.

Someone  said:  “ The  great  mobilization  and  complete  preparedness  of 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  for the sake of belief and the proving of the divine unity is 
constantly increasing. One hundredth part of its contents is enough to silence 
the most obstinate atheist; why then this further feverish mobilization and 
preparation? ”

They answered him: “ The R i s a l e - i   N u r  is not only repairing some minor 
damage or some small house; it is repairing vast damage and the all-embrac-
ing citadel which contains Islam, the stones of which are the size of moun-
tains. And it is not striving to reform only a private heart and an individual 
conscience; it is striving to cure with the medicines of the Qur’an and belief 
and  the  Qur’an’s  miraculousness  the  collective  heart  and  generally-held 
ideas, which have been breached in awesome fashion by the tools of cor-
ruption prepared and stored up over a thousand years, and the general con-
science, which is facing corruption through the destruction of the founda-
tions, currents, and marks of Islam which are the refuge of all and particu-
larly the mass of believers.

“ Certainly, for such universal breaches and awesome wounds, proofs and 
equipment of the utmost certitude and the strength of mountains, and well-
proven medicines and numberless drugs of the effectiveness of a thousand 
remedies are necessary. Emerging at this time from the inimitable meanings 
of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  performs this func-
tion, and is also the means of advancing and progressing through the inﬁnite

A long discussion ensued to which I listened, offering inﬁnite thanks. I

In  this  Ninth  Ray  will  be  expounded  a  supreme  point  of  these  sub-
lime heavenly verses, which demonstrate one of the poles of belief; these 
mighty sacred proofs of the resurrection of the dead will be explained. It is 
a subtle instance of dominical grace that thirty years ago at the end of his 

206

THE NINTH RAY

207

work  entitled  Muhâkemat,  which  was  written  to  set  out  the  principles  of 
Qur’anic exegesis, the Old Said wrote: “ Second Aim: Two Qur’anic verses 
alluding to the resurrection of the dead will be expounded and explained. 
ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92)  ” 1 There he stopped and could write no further. Now, 
ِم(cid:193) ِ(cid:110)َ
praise and thanks be to my Compassionate Creator to the number of signs 
and indications of the resurrection, that thirty years later He gave me suc-
cess. Yes, nine or ten years ago, He bestowed the Tenth and Twenty- Ninth 
Words, two brilliant and powerful proofs expounding the divine decree of:

which was the ﬁrst of the two verses. They silenced the deniers of resurrec-
tion. Now, nine or ten years after those two impregnable bastions of belief 
in the resurrection of the dead, He bestowed with the present treatise a com-
mentary on the second of the above two sublime verses. This Ninth Ray, 
then, consists of nine elevated stations, indicated by the above-mentioned 
verses, and an important introduction.

Introduction 

[ Two points comprising a concise explanation of one comprehensive 
result of the numerous spiritual beneﬁts of belief in resurrection and of 
its vital consequences; a demonstration of how essential it is for human 
life and especially for the life of society; a summary of one universal 
proof out of numerous proofs of the tenet of belief in the resurrection 
of the dead; and a statement of how indubitable and self-evident is that 
tenet of belief. ]

First Point

FIRST POINT

The First

We shall indicate, as a measure, only four out of hundreds of proofs that 
belief  in  the  hereafter  is  fundamental  to  the  life  of  society  and  to  man’s 
personal life, and is the basis of his happiness, prosperity, and achievement.
T h e   F i r s t :  It is only with the thought of Paradise that children, who form 
almost a half of humankind, can endure all the deaths around them, which 
appear  to  them  to  be  grievous  and  frightening,  and  strengthen  the  morale 
of  their  weak  and  delicate  beings.  With  the  thought  of  Paradise  they  ﬁnd 
hope in their vulnerable spirits, prone to weeping, and may live happily. For 
example, thinking of Paradise, a child may say: “ My little brother or friend 
has died and become a bird in Paradise. He is ﬂying around Paradise and 
living more happily than us. ” The frequent deaths before their unhappy eyes 
of other children like themselves or of grown-ups will otherwise destroy all 
their resistance and morale, making their subtle faculties, such as their spir-
its, hearts, and minds, weep together with their eyes; they will either decline 
utterly or become crazy, wretched animals.

The Second Proof

S e c o n d   P r o o f :  It is only through the life of the hereafter that the elderly, 
who form half of mankind, can endure the proximity of the grave, and be 
consoled at the thought that their lives, to which they are ﬁrmly attached, 
will soon be extinguished and their ﬁne worlds come to an end. It is only 
with the hope of eternal life that they can respond to the grievous despair 
they feel in their emotional child-like spirits at the thought of death. Those 
worthy,  anxious  fathers  and  mothers,  so  deserving  of  compassion  and  in 
need of tranquillity and peace of mind, will otherwise feel a terrible spiritual 
turmoil and distress in their hearts, and this world will become a dark prison 
for them, and life even, grievous torment.

The Third Proof

T h i r d   P r o o f :  It is only the thought of Hell-ﬁre that checks the turbulent 
emotions  of  youths,  the  most  vigorous  element  in  the  life  of  society,  and 

208

THE NINTH RAY

209

their  violent  excesses,  restraining  them  from  aggression,  oppression,  and 
destruction, and ensuring that the life of society continues tranquilly. If not 
for fear of Hell, in accordance with the rule “ Might is right,” in pursuing 
their desires, those drunken youths would turn the worlds of the wretched 
weak and powerless into Hell, and elevated humanity into base animality.

The Fourth Proof

F o u r t h   P r o o f :  The most comprehensive centre of worldly life, and its 
mainspring,  and  a  paradise,  refuge,  and  fortress  of  worldly  happiness,  is 
the life of the family. Everyone’s home is a small world for him. And the 
life  and  happiness  of  his  home  and  family  are  possible  through  genuine, 
earnest, and loyal respect and true, tender, and self-sacriﬁcing compassion. 
This true respect and genuine kindness may be felt due to the idea of the 
members of the family having an everlasting companionship and friendship 
and togetherness, and their parental, ﬁlial, brotherly, and friendly relations 
continuing for all eternity in a limitless life, and their believing this. One 
says, for example: “ My wife will be my constant companion in an everlast-
ing world and eternal life. It does not matter if now she is old and ugly, for 
she will have an immortal beauty. ” He will tell himself that he will be as 
kind and devoted as he can for the sake of that permanent companionship, 
and treat his elderly wife lovingly and kindly as though she were a beautiful 
houri. A companionship that was to end in eternal separation after an hour 
or two of brief, apparent friendship would otherwise afford only superﬁcial, 
temporary,  feigned,  animal-like  feelings,  and  false  compassion  and  artiﬁ-
cial respect. As with animals, self-interest and other overpowering emotions 
would prevail over the respect and compassion, transforming that worldly 
paradise into Hell.

Thus, one of the hundreds of results of belief in resurrection is connected 
with  the  life  of  society.  If  a  comparison  is  made  between  the  above  four 
proofs out of the hundreds of aspects and beneﬁts of this single consequence 
and the rest, it will be understood that the realization of the truth of resurrec-
tion and its occurrence, are as certain as the elevated reality of humanity and 
its universal need. It is clearer even than the evidence for the existence of 
food offered by the existence of need in man’s stomach and tells of its exist-
ence more clearly. It proves too that if the consequences of the truth of resur-
rection were to quit humanity, whose nature is extremely signiﬁcant, lofty, 
and living, it would descend to being a corrupt corpse fed on by microbes.

The sociologists, politicians, and moralists who govern humankind and 
are concerned with its social and moral questions should be aware of this! 
How  do  they  propose  to  ﬁll  this  vacuum?  With  what  can  they  cure  these 
deep wounds?

Second Point

210

SECOND POINT

THE RAYS

This explains in summary form a proof – one of many – proceeding from 
the testimony to the truth of resurrection of the other pillars of belief. It is 
as follows:

All  the  miracles  indicating  the  messengership  of  Muhammad  ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) and the evidences for his prophethood, and 
all the proofs of his veracity, together testify to the occurrence of the resur-
rection and prove it. For after divine unity, everything he claimed through-
out his life was centred on the resurrection of the dead. Also, all his miracles 
and proofs afﬁrming, and making afﬁrmed, all the previous prophets attest 
to the same truth. Also, the testimony of the phrase ِهِ(cid:93)ُ(cid:99)ﯭﯦَو which makes 
completely  clear  the  testimony  of  the  phrase ِهِ(cid:171) ُ(cid:126)ُرِ(cid:92) َو  testiﬁes  to  the  same 
truth. Like this:

All the miracles, truths, and proofs proving foremost the veracity of the 
Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition,  testify  to  and  prove  the  realization  and 
occurrence of resurrection. For almost a third of the Qur’an is about resur-
rection, and at the beginning of most of its short suras are powerful verses 
about it. It expresses the same truth explicitly and implicitly with thousands 
of its verses, and proves and demonstrates it. For example:

 ) ( ' & % $ # " !     ( 81:1 )  # " ! 
   ( 82:1 ) # " !      ( 99:1 ) < ; : 9    ( 22:1 )  *
( 88:1 ) 7 6 5 4    ( 78:1 ) " !    ( 84:1 ) . - ,
Besides demonstrating with complete certainty at the beginning of thirty 
or forty suras that resurrection is the most important and necessary truth in 
the universe, it sets forth various persuasive evidences for that truth in others 
of its verses.

Is there any possibility that belief in the hereafter should be false, which 
emerges like the sun from the thousands of declarations and statements of 
a Book a single indication of one of the verses of which has yielded before 
our  eyes  the  fruits  of  numerous  learned  and  cosmic  truths  in  the  Islamic 
sciences? Is there any possibility of denying the sun, or the existence of the 
universe? Would it not be impossible and absurd? Is it at all possible that 
although an army may sometimes be plunged into battle so that a mere sign 
of the king should not be given the lie, to show as false the thousands of 

THE NINTH RAY

211

words, promises, and threats of that most serious, proud monarch? Is it pos-
sible that they should be false?

Although a single sign of that glorious spiritual monarch who for thirteen 
centuries  without  break  has  ruled  over  innumerable  spirits,  minds,  hearts, 
and souls within the bounds of truth and reality, and trained and educated 
them, would be sufﬁcient to prove the truth of resurrection, it has demon-
strated it with thousands of explicit statements. Is the torment of Hell-ﬁre 
not necessary then for the compounded idiot who does not recognize this 
fact? Is it not pure justice?

Moreover, by their deﬁnite acceptance of the truth of resurrection, which 
the Qur’an - prevailing over the future and all times- repeatedly proves in 
detail and elucidates, all the revealed scriptures and sacred books, each of 
which dominated a particular period, proved it according to their own times 
and centuries, but in undetailed, veiled, and summary manner, conﬁrming 
with a thousand signatures what the Qur’an teaches.

Included here since it is related to this discussion is the testimony at the 

end of the Third Ray of the other pillars of faith to  ِر ِ(cid:114)ٰ
larly “ the Prophets ” and “ Holy Scriptures.”  It offers convincing proof of 
resurrection, and is in the form of a powerful yet succinct supplication which 
dispels all doubts. It says in the supplication:

ْ(cid:202)ا ِمْوَ(cid:193)ْ(cid:170)اِ(cid:92) ٌنا َ(cid:175)ـ(cid:192)ِا particu-

“ O   M y   C o m p a s s i o n a t e   S u s t a i n e r !
“ I  have  understood  from  the  instruction  of  Your  Noble  Messenger 
( UWBP ) and the teaching of the Qur’an, that foremost the Qur’an and the 
Messenger,  and  all  the  sacred  scriptures  and  prophets,  have  unanimously 
testiﬁed and pointed out that the manifestations of the names related to Your 
beauty and glory, examples of which are to be seen in this world, will con-
tinue even more radiantly for all eternity, and that Your bounties, samples of 
which are to be observed in this transitory world, will persist in the abode of 
bliss in still more glittering fashion, and that those who long for them in this 
world will accompany them for all eternity.

“ Also, relying on hundreds of evident miracles and decisive signs, fore-
most Your Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 
and  the  All-Wise  Qur’an,  and  the  prophets  with  their  luminous  spirits, 
and the saints, who are spiritual poles with their light-ﬁlled hearts, and the 
puriﬁed scholars with their enlightened intellects, relying on Your repeated 
threats and promises in all the sacred scriptures, and trusting in Your sacred 
attributes such as power, mercy, favour, wisdom, glory, and beauty, and on 

212

THE RAYS

Your qualities, and the dignity of Your glory, and the sovereignty of Your 
dominicality,  and  in  consequence  of  their  illuminations  and  visions  and 
beliefs at the degree of ‘the knowledge of certainty,’ give the glad tidings to 
men and jinn of eternal happiness and inform them of Hell for the people of 
misguidance; they ﬁrmly believe this and testify to it.

“ O   A l l - P o w e r f u l   a n d   W i s e   O n e !   O   M o s t   M e r c i f u l   a n d   C o m p a s s i o n -

“ You  are  utterly  exempt  from  and  exalted  above  giving  the  lie  to  so 
many loyal friends, and so many promises, and attributes and qualities, and 
denying the certain demands of the sovereignty of Your dominicality and 
the endless prayers and supplications of Your innumerable acceptable serv-
ants, whom You love and who attract Your love by assenting to You and 
obeying You; and You are exempt from conﬁrming the denial of resurrec-
tion by the people of misguidance and unbelief, who through their disbelief 
and rebellion and denial of Your promises, offend the magniﬁcence of Your 
grandeur and affront Your dignity and glory and the honour of Your God-
head, and sadden the compassion of Your dominicality. We declare Your 
justice,  beauty,  and  mercy  to  be  exempt  from  such  inﬁnite  tyranny,  such 
ugliness. We believe with all our strength that the testimony of the prophets, 
puriﬁed scholars, and saints, who are those truthful envoys of Yours, those 
heralds of Your sovereignty, at the degrees of absolute certainty, knowledge 
of certainty, and the vision of certainty, to the treasuries of Your mercy in 
the hereafter and the stores of Your bounties in the everlasting realm, and 
to the wondrously beautiful manifestations of Your beautiful names, which 
will be manifested totally in the abode of bliss, are absolutely true and vera-
cious, and what they have indicated conforms absolutely with reality, and 
that what they have given glad tidings of is true and will occur. Believing 
that the supreme ray of Your name of Truth, which is the source, sun, and 
protector of all realities, is this truth of the resurrection and Great Gathering, 
they teach it to Your servants. ”

O  A l l a h !   F o r   t h e   s a k e   o f   w h a t   t h e y   t e a c h   a n d   i n   v e n e r a t i o n   o f   i t ,   g r a n t

Moreover, just as all the proofs demonstrating the veracity of the revealed 
scriptures, and all the miracles and evidences proving the prophethood of 
Allah’s Beloved ( UWBP ) and of all the prophets, indirectly prove the real-
ity of the hereafter, which is what they teach above all else; so most of the 

THE NINTH RAY

213

evidences for the existence and unity of the Necessary Existent testify indi-
rectly to the existence and opening up of an eternal realm of bliss, which 
will  be  the  supreme  manifestation  of  dominicality  and  divinity.  For  as  is 
explained and proved in the following paragraphs, both the existence of the 
Necessarily Existent One, and most of His attributes, qualities and names, 
such as dominicality, Godhead, mercy, grace, wisdom, and justice, necessi-
tate the hereafter with the utmost certainty, and demand an eternal realm and 
the resurrection of the dead and Last Judgement for the granting of reward 
and punishment.

Since there is a pre-eternal and post-eternal Allah, most certainly there 

is the hereafter, the everlasting sphere of the sovereignty of His Godhead.

And since there is in the universe and in living beings a most majestic and 
wise, a most compassionate and absolute dominicality, and it is apparent; 
there is certain to be an eternal realm of happiness which will save the maj-
esty of that dominicality from abasement, its wisdom from purposelessness, 
and its compassion from cruelty; and that realm shall be entered.

And since the unlimited bestowals, bounties, favours, gifts, and instances 
of grace and mercy which are to be seen, show to minds that are not extin-
guished and hearts that are not dead that behind the veil of the Unseen is 
One All-Merciful and Compassionate; surely there is an immortal life in an 
eternal realm which will save the bestowal from mockery, the bounties from 
deception, the favours from enmity, the mercy from torment, the grace and 
gifts from treachery, and will make the bounties bounty and the bestowal 
bestowal.

And  since  in  the  springtime  on  the  narrow  page  of  the  earth,  a  pen  of 
power writes a hundred thousand books without error tirelessly before our 
eyes;  and  since  the  Holder  of  the  pen  has  promised  a  hundred  thousand 
times: “ I am going to write a ﬁne, immortal book in a broad realm, easier 
than this book of the spring written in this narrow realm, confused and inter-
mingled, and I shall allow you to read it; ” - since He mentions the book in all 
his decrees; certainly, the main part of the book has been written, and with 
the resurrection and Last Judgement its footnotes shall be added, and all the 
notebooks of people’s actions shall be recorded in it.

And  since,  with  its  multiplicity  of  creatures,  the  earth  is  the  dwelling, 
source,  factory,  exhibition,  and  gathering  place  of  hundreds  of  thousands 
of constantly changing species of living beings and beings with spirits, and 
is  the  heart,  centre,  summary,  and  result  of  the  universe,  and  the  reason 
for its creation; it has supreme importance, and is held equal to the mighty 

214

THE RAYS

heavens  despite  its  smallness;  in  the  heavenly  decrees,  it  is  always  said: 

P O N

And  since  there  is  man,  who  rules  over  the  earth,  which  is  thus,  has 
disposal  over  most  creatures,  and  subjects  most  living  beings  gathering 
them around himself; and since he so orders, displays, and gathers each 
remarkable  species  together  in  one  place  like  a  list,  adorning  them,  that 
he attracts not only the attention and admiration of men and jinn, but of 
the  dwellers  of  the  heavens  and  the  universe,  and  the  appreciative  gaze 
of  the  universe’s  Owner,  thus  gaining  great  importance  and  high  worth; 
and since he shows through his sciences and arts that he is the purpose of 
the universe’s creation, and its most important result, and most precious 
fruit, and the vicegerent of the earth; and since because with respect to this 
world, he has ordered and displayed excellently the miraculous arts of the 
world’s Maker, he is left in this world despite his rebellion and disbelief, 
and his punishment is postponed, and because of this work of his, his term 
is prolonged and is allowed success...

And since there is an extremely powerful, wise, and compassionate Dis-
poser  who  makes  the  mighty  globe  into  a  treasury  of  every  sort  of  metal 
and mineral that man needs in a way entirely beyond his strength and will 
-who despite being weak, impotent, and wanting by nature and creation, has 
innumerable needs and is subject to innumerable pains- and since He makes 
it into a store of every sort of food, and a shop stocking goods of every kind 
that pleases man, and looks to man in this way, and nurtures him, and gives 
him what he wants...

And  since  there  is  a  Sustainer  who  is  thus,  who  both  loves  man  and 
causes man to love Him, and who is enduring and has eternal worlds, and 
who performs every work with justice and carries out everything with wis-
dom; and since the splendour of that Pre-Eternal Sovereign’s rule and His 
eternal dominion cannot be contained in this brief worldly life, and in man’s 
ﬂeeting span, and in the temporary and transient earth; and since the exces-
sive wrongdoing and rebellion that occur among men, which are contrary to 
and opposed to the universe’s order, justice, balance, and beauty, and their 
denial, treachery, and disbelief towards their Benefactor, who nurtures them 
tenderly, - since they are not punished in this world, and the cruel oppres-
sor passes his life in ease while the unhappy oppressed live in hardship; and 
since the absolute justice whose traces are to be seen throughout the universe 
is entirely opposed to the cruel tyrant and despairing oppressed being equal 
in death, and would in no way permit it...

THE NINTH RAY

215

And  since  just  as  the  universe’s  Owner  has  chosen  the  earth  from  the 
universe,  and  man  from  the  earth  and  bestowed  on  him  a  high  rank  and 
importance; so out of mankind He has chosen the prophets, saints, and puri-
ﬁed ones, true human beings who conform to the aims of His dominicality 
and through their belief and submission make Him love them; He has taken 
them as friends and addressees, and bestowed miracles and success on them 
and punished their enemies with heavenly blows. And out of these worthy 
and lovable friends He has chosen their leader and source of pride, Muham-
mad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), and for long centuries has illu-
minated with his light half the globe and a ﬁfth of humanity; as though the 
universe  were  created  for  him,  all  its  purposes  become  apparent  through 
him and his religion and the Qur’an. And although he deserved to live for an 
inﬁnite time in recompense for his inﬁnitely valuable service, for millions of 
years, he only lived a brief sixty-three years of great hardship and striving. 
Is there any possibility then that he should not be resurrected together with 
all his peers and friends? That they should not now be living in the spirit? 
That they should have been annihilated eternally? Allah forbid, a hundred 
thousand times! Yes, all the universe and the reality of the world demand 
that he should be resurrected and they beseech the universe’s Owner that he 
should be living...

And since in the Seventh Ray, T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n , each with the strength 
of a mountain, the thirty-three powerful consensuses have proved that the 
universe emerged from a single hand and is the property of a single being; 
and have demonstrated self-evidently His unity and oneness, the means of 
the divine perfections; and through unity and oneness all beings become like 
soldiers under orders and subservient ofﬁcials; and with the coming of the 
hereafter, perfections are saved from decline, absolute justice from mocking 
cruelty, universal wisdom from foolish absurdity, all-embracing mercy from 
jeering torment, and the dignity of power from abased impotence, and they 
are exonerated from this...

Certainly and without any doubt, as necessitated by the truths in these six 
‘sinces’ -six out of hundreds of points of belief in Allah- the end of the world 
shall  come  and  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  occur.  Abodes  of  reward  and 
punishment shall be thrown open so that the above-mentioned importance 
of  the  earth,  and  its  centrality,  and  man’s  importance  and  value  shall  be 
realized, and the above-mentioned justice, wisdom, mercy, and sovereignty 
of the All-Wise Disposer, who is the Creator of the earth and of man, and 
their  Sustainer,  shall  be  established;  and  the  true  and  yearning  friends  of 

216

THE RAYS

that eternal Sustainer shall be saved from eternal annihilation; and the most 
eminent and worthy of those friends receive the recompense for his sacred 
services, which have made all beings pleased and indebted; and the perfec-
tions of the Eternal Sovereign should be exempted and exonerated from all 
fault and deﬁciency, and His power from impotence, and His wisdom from 
foolishness, and His justice from tyranny.

I n   S h o r t :  Since Allah exists, so does the hereafter certainly exist.
Moreover, just as with all the evidences that prove them, the above three 
pillars  of  belief  testify  to  and  indicate  resurrection;  so  do  the  two  pillars 
ِرَ(cid:130)َو ِهِرْ(cid:193)َ(cid:114) ِرَدَ(cid:163)ْ(cid:170)اِ(cid:92) َو ِهِ(cid:99)ﯬﯧِ(cid:87)ٰ(cid:171) َ(cid:175)ـِ(cid:92) َو also necessitate resurrection and 
ىٰ(cid:170)اَ(cid:151)َ(cid:98) ِ
testify in powerful fashion to the eternal realm. It is like this:

ّ(cid:195)ا  َنِ(cid:174) ِهّ

All  the  evidences  proving  the  existence  of  the  angels  and  their  duties 
of worship, and innumerable observations of them and conversations with 
them, prove indirectly the existence of the Spirit World, and the World of 
the Unseen, and the eternal realm and world of the hereafter, and the exist-
ence of an abode of happiness and Paradise and Hell, which in the future 
shall be populated with men and jinn. For with divine permission, the angels 
can see these worlds and enter them. And all the high-ranking angels who 
meet with humans, like Gabriel, tell unanimously of the existence of these 
worlds  and  of  their  travelling  round  them.  Just  as  we  are  certain,  due  to 
the information of those coming from there, that the continent of America 
exists, although we have not seen it, so due to information about the angels, 
which has the strength of a hundredfold consensus, we should believe with 
the same certainty in the existence of the world of eternity, the realm of the 
hereafter, and Paradise and Hell. And so we do believe in it.

Furthermore,  all  the  evidences  proving  the  pillar  of  “ belief  in  divine 
determining, ” included in the Tr e a t i s e   o n   D i v i n e   D e t e r m i n i n g , the Twenty-
Sixth Word, prove indirectly the resurrection of the dead, the balancing of 
deeds on the supreme scales, and the publishing of the pages of deeds. For 
the recording before our eyes of the appointed courses of all things on the 
tablets of order and balance, and the inscribing of the life-stories of all living 
beings in their faculties of memory, and the transcribing of the notebooks of 
deeds of all beings with spirits, and especially men, on the Preserved Tab-

and punishment. That comprehensive and precise recording and preservation

would otherwise be completely meaningless and purposeless, and contrary 
to wisdom and reality.

Also, if there were no resurrection, all the certain meanings of the book 
of the universe, written with the pen of divine determining, would be nul-
liﬁed,  which  is  completely  impossible.  It  is  as  impossible  as  denying  the 
universe’s existence, indeed, is a delirium.

I n   S h o r t :  With all their evidences the ﬁve pillars of belief demand the 
occurrence of the resurrection and Last Judgement, and their existence, and 
the existence and opening up of the realm of the hereafter, and they testify 
to these and necessitate them.

Thus,  it  is  because  there  are  such  vast  and  unshakeable  supports  and 
proofs of the resurrection, completely in conformity with its vastness, that 
almost one third of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition consists in by res-
urrection and the hereafter, and it makes it the basis and foundation stone of 
all its truths, and constructs everything on it.

According  to  an  inner  meaning  of  this  verse,  Joseph  ( Upon  whom 
be peace ) is the patron of prisoners and prison is a sort of School of 
Joseph. This being the second time the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students have been 
sent  to  prison  in  large  numbers,  they  should  study  and  teach  in  this 
school which has been opened to give such training, the brief summa-
ries of a number of matters connected with prison that the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
proves, and beneﬁt from them thoroughly. We shall explain ﬁve or six 
of those summaries.

The First Topic

The First Topic

As is explained in the Fourth Word, everyday our Creator bestows on us 
the capital of twenty- four hours of life so that with it we may obtain all the 
things necessary for our two lives. If we spend twenty-three hours on this 
ﬂeeting worldly life and neglect to spend the remaining one hour, which is 
sufﬁcient for the ﬁve obligatory prayers, on the very lengthy life of the here-
after, it may be understood what an unreasonable error it is, and what a great 
loss to suffer distress of the mind and spirit as the penalty for the error, and 
to behave badly because of the distress, and to fail to rectify one’s conduct 
due to living in a state of despair, indeed, to do the opposite. We may make 
the comparison.

We should think of what a proﬁtable ordeal it is – if we spend the one 
hour on the ﬁve obligatory prayers, for each hour of this calamitous term of 
imprisonment sometimes becomes a day’s worship and one of its transient 
hours becomes many permanent hours, and our despair and distress of the 
spirit and heart in part disappears and is atonement for the mistakes that led 
to the imprisonment and is the cause of their being forgiven.

219

220

THE RAYS

We are trained and improved, which is the purpose of imprisonment, so 
we should think of that and its being instruction and a pleasant and consoling 
meeting with our companions in disaster.

As is explained in the Fourth Word, it may be understood how contrary 
it is to a person’s interests to give ﬁve or ten liras out of his twenty-four 
to a lottery in which a thousand people are taking part in order to win the 
thousand-lira prize, and not give a single lira out of the twenty-four for a 
ticket for an everlasting treasury of jewels, and to rush to the former and 
ﬂee from the latter, although the chance of winning the thousand liras in 
the worldly lottery is one in a thousand because there are a thousand peo-
ple taking part. However, in the lottery of human destiny which looks to 
the hereafter the chance of winning for the people of belief, who experi-
ence  happy  deaths,  is  nine  hundred  and  ninety-nine  out  of  a  thousand. 
This has been told by one hundred and twenty-four thousand prophets and 
conﬁrmed by incalculable numbers of truthful saints and puriﬁed scholars 
as a result of their illuminations.

Prison governors and chief warders, and indeed the country’s administra-
tors and the guardians of public order, should be grateful at this lesson of 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r , for the government and disciplining of a thousand believ-
ers who constantly have in mind the prison of Hell is far easier than that of 
ten  unbelievers  who  do  not  perform  the  obligatory  prayers,  only  think  of 
worldly prisons, do not know what is licit and what is illicit, and are in part 
accustomed to living undisciplined lives.

The Second Topic

A Summary of the Second Topic 

As is well explained in A   G u i d e   F o r   Yo u t h  from the R i s a l e - i   N u r , it is as 
deﬁnite and obvious that death will befall us as the night will follow today 
and winter, this autumn. Just as this prison is a temporary guesthouse for 
those  who  continuously  enter  it  and  leave  it;  so  the  face  of  the  earth  is  a 
hostel  on  the  road  of  the  swiftly  travelling  caravans  which  alight  for  one 
night then pass on. Surely death, which has emptied all the cities into the 
graveyard a hundred times over, has demands greater than life. The R i s a l e - i  
N u r  has solved the riddle of this awesome truth and discovered its answer. 
A short summary of it is this:

Since death cannot be killed nor the door of the grave be closed, if there 
is a way of being saved from the executioner of the appointed hour and the 
solitary conﬁnement of the grave, it is a question, an anxiety, for man hold-
ing greater importance than anything. Yes, there is a solution, and through 
the mystery of the Qur’an, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  has proved it as certainly as two 
plus two equals four. A brief summary of it is as follows:

Death is either eternal annihilation, a gallows on which will be hanged 
both man and all his friends and relations; or it comprises the release papers 
to  depart  for  another,  eternal,  realm,  and  to  enter,  with  the  document  of 
belief, the palace of bliss. The grave is either a bottomless pit and dark place 
of solitary conﬁnement, or it is a door opening from the prison of this world 
onto an eternal, light-ﬁlled garden and place of feasting. A   G u i d e   F o r   Yo u t h  
has proved this truth with a comparison.

For example; gallows have been set up in this prison yard, and behind 
the wall immediately beyond them a huge lottery ofﬁce has been opened. 
The whole world is taking part in the lottery it is holding. We ﬁve hundred 
people in this prison are certain to be summoned one by one without excep-
tion  to  that  arena;  to  avoid  it  is  not  possible.  Everywhere  announcements 
are  being  made:  “ Come  and  receive  your  decree  of  execution  and  mount 
the gallows! ”, or: “ Take the note for everlasting solitary conﬁnement, and 
take that door! ”, or: “ Good news for you! The winning ticket worth millions 
has come up for you. Come and receive it! ” We see with our own eyes that 
one after the other they are mounting the gallows. We observe that some are 
being hanged, while others are making the gallows a step and are moving 
onto the lottery ofﬁce beyond the wall. Just at that point, which we know 

221

222

THE RAYS

as though we have seen it from the certain information given by the high-
ranking ofﬁcials there, two groups have entered our prison.

One group are holding musical instruments, wine, and apparently sweet 
confections and pastries which they are trying to make us eat. But the sweets 
are in fact lethal, for satans in human form have laced them with poison.

The  second  group  are  carrying  instructive  writings,  licit  foods,  and 
blessed drinks. They present them to us and all together say to us with great 
earnestness: “ If you take and eat the gifts the ﬁrst group gave you by way of 
testing you, you shall be hanged on these gallows before us like the others 
you have seen. Whereas if you accept the gifts we have brought you on the 
command of this country’s Ruler in place of them, and recite the supplica-
tions and prayers in the instructive writings, you shall be saved from execu-
tion. Believe as though you were seeing it that each of you shall receive the 
winning ticket worth millions in the lottery ofﬁce as a royal favour. These 
decrees say, and we ourselves say the same thing, that if you eat those illicit, 
dubious, and poisonous sweets, you shall suffer terrible pains from the poi-
son until you go to be hanged. ”

Like  this  comparison,  for  the  people  of  belief  and  worship  -on  condi-
tion they have happy deaths- the ticket for an everlasting and inexhaustible 
treasury will come up from the lottery of human destiny beyond the gallows 
of the appointed hour, which we always see. For those who persist in vice, 
unlawful  actions,  unbelief,  and  sin,  however,  there  is  a  hundred  per  cent 
probability that on condition they do not repent, they will receive the sum-
mons to either eternal annihilation ( for those who do not believe in the here-
after ), or to permanent, dark solitary conﬁnement ( for those who believe in 
the immortality of man’s spirit, but take the way of vice ) and eternal perdi-
tion. Certain news of this has been given by the hundred and twenty-four 
thousand prophets  1 with their innumerable conﬁrmatory miracles; and by 
the more than one hundred and twenty-four million saints, who see in their 
illuminations the traces and shadows -as though on a cinema screen- of what 
the prophets have told, and put their signatures to it, afﬁrming it; and by the 
more than thousands of millions of investigative scholars,  2 interpreters of 
the law, and veracious ones who, with decisive proofs and powerful argu-
ments,  prove  according  to  reason  and  absolutely  certainly  the  things  told 
by those two eminent groups of humankind, and have set their signatures

been silencing the most obstinate philosophers and obdurate atheists. Its various parts are 
available; everyone may read them, and no one can object to them.

to them. The situation then of someone who does not heed the news given 
unanimously by the decrees of these three vast and elevated communities 
and groups of the people of reality, who are the suns, moons, and stars of 
mankind and the sacred leaders of humanity, and does not take the straight 
path which they have pointed out, and disregards the awesome ninety-nine 
per cent danger, and abandons that way due to one person saying there is 
danger on it and takes another, lengthy, way - his situation is as follows:

The wretch who since he has abandoned, according to the certain news 
of innumerable well- informed observers, the shortest and easiest of the two 
ways,  which  with  a  hundred  per  cent  certainty  will  lead  to  Paradise  and 
eternal happiness, and has chosen the roughest, longest way, which is most 
fraught with difﬁculties and is ninety-nine per cent certain will lead to incar-
ceration in Hell and everlasting misery; who leaves the short way because, 
according to the false information of a single informer, there is a one per 
cent chance of danger and the possibility of a month’s imprisonment, and 
chooses the long way, which is without beneﬁt, just because it holds no dan-
ger, like drunken lunatics; such a wretch has lost his humanity, mind, heart, 
and spirit to the extent that he ignores the terrible dragons which are seen 
from afar and are pestering him, and struggles against mosquitoes, attaching 
importance to them alone.

Since this is the reality of the situation, we prisoners should accept the 
gifts of the second, blessed, group so that we avenge ourselves totally for 
this  calamity  of  prison.  That  is  to  say,  just  as  the  pleasure  of  a  minute’s 
revenge or a minute or two or an hour or two of vice or this calamity has 
put us in this prison for ﬁfteen, ﬁve, ten, or two or three years, and made 
our worlds into a prison; so to spite it, we should avenge ourselves on this 
calamity by transforming an hour or two of our prison lives into a day or 
two of worship, and our two or three-year-sentences – through the gifts of 
the blessed group – into twenty or thirty years of permanent life, and our 
prison sentences of twenty or thirty years into a means of forgiveness from 
millions of years of incarceration in the dungeons of Hell. In the face of our 
transitory worlds’ weeping, we should make our everlasting lives smile. We 
should show that prison is a place of training and education, and each of us 
try to be well-behaved, reliable, useful members of our nation and country. 
The prison ofﬁcers, administrators, and governors should see that the men 
they supposed to be criminals, bandits, layabouts, murderers, depraved, and 
harmful to the country are students studying in this blessed place of instruc-
tion, and should proudly offer thanks to Allah.

The Third Topic

The Third Topic

This is the summary of an instructive incident which is described in  A  

G u i d e   F o r   Yo u t h .

One  time,  I  was  sitting  by  my  window  in  Eskişehir  Prison  during  the 
Republic  Festival.  Opposite  me,  the  older  girls  of  the  High  School  were 
laughing and dancing in the schoolyard. Suddenly their condition ﬁfty years 
hence  appeared  to  me,  as  though  on  a  cinema  screen.  I  saw  that  of  those 
ﬁfty to sixty girl students, forty to ﬁfty had become earth in their graves, 
and were suffering torments. While ten were ugly seventy to eighty-year-
olds who were despised where they might have expected love because they 
did not preserve their chastity when young. This I observed with complete 
certainty and I wept at their piteable states. Some of my friends in the prison 
heard my weeping, and came and asked me about it. I told them: “ Leave me 
alone for now, I want to be alone. ”

Yes,  what  I  saw  was  reality,  not  imagination.  Just  as  the  summer  and 
autumn are followed by winter, so the summer of youth and autumn of old 
age are followed by the winter of the grave and Intermediate Realm. If there 
were a cinema which showed the events of ﬁfty years in the future, the same 
as those of ﬁfty years ago are shown in the present, and the people of mis-
guidance  and  vice  were  to  be  shown  their  circumstances  of  ﬁfty  or  sixty 
years hence, they would weep in horror and disgust at their unlawful pleas-
ures and those things at which they now laugh.

When preoccupied with these observations in Eskişehir Prison, a collec-
tive personality which spreads vice and misguidance was embodied before 
me like a human satan. It said:

“ We want to experience all the pleasures and joys of life, and to make 

others experience them; don’t interfere with us! ”

I replied: Since you do not recall death and plunge yourself into vice and 
misguidance  for  pleasure  and  enjoyment,  you  should  certainly  know  that 
due to your misguidance, all the past is dead and non-existent; it is a desolate 
graveyard full of rotted bodies. The suffering arising from those innumer-
able separations and the eternal deaths of those numberless friends inﬂicted 
on your head through the concern of your humanity and your misguidance, 

224

THE FRUITS OF BELIEF – THIRD TOPIC

225

and on your heart if you have one and it is not dead, will soon destroy your 
insigniﬁcant  drunken  pleasure  of  the  present.  The  future  too,  due  to  your 
unbelief, is a non-existent, black, dead, and desolate wasteland. And since 
the heads of the unfortunates who appear from there, sticking them out into 
existence while stopping by in the present, are struck off by the executioner’s 
sword of the appointed hour and thrown into non- existence, it continuously 
rains down grievous worries on your unbelieving head due to the concern of 
your intellect, completely overturning your petty, dissolute pleasure.

If  you  give  up  vice  and  misguidance  and  enter  the  sphere  of  certain, 
realized belief  1 and righteousness, you will see through the light of belief 
that the past is not non-existent and a graveyard that rots everything, but an 
existent, light-ﬁlled world which is transformed into the future and into a 
waiting-room for the immortal spirits who will enter palaces of bliss in the 
future. Since it appears thus, it affords not pain, but according to the strength 
of belief, a sort of paradaisical pleasure. The future, too, appears to the eye 
of belief not as a dark wasteland, but where banquets and exhibitions of gifts 
have been set up in palaces of everlasting bliss by the Most Merciful and 
Compassionate One of Glory and Bestowal, Whose mercy and muniﬁcence 
are inﬁnite and Who makes the spring and summer into tables laden with 
bounties. Since, knowing he will be despatched there, a person observes this 
on the cinema screen of belief, he may experience in a way the pleasures of 
the eternal realm. Everyone may do this according to their degree. T h a t   i s   t o  
s a y,   t r u e ,   p a i n f r e e   p l e a s u r e   i s   f o u n d   o n l y   i n   b e l i e f   i n   A l l a h ,   a n d   i s   p o s s i b l e  
o n l y   t h r o u g h   b e l i e f .

Since it is related to our discussion, we shall explain here by means of 
a comparison, which is included in  A   G u i d e   F o r   Yo u t h  as a footnote, one 
single beneﬁt and pleasure out of the thousands that belief produces in this 
world too. It is as follows:

For  example,  your  beloved  only  child  is  suffering  the  pangs  of  death 
and you are thinking despairingly of being eternally parted from him. Then 
suddenly a doctor like Khidr or Luqman the Wise arrives with a wondrous 
medicine. Your lovely, lovable child opens his eyes, delivered from death. 
You can understand what joy and happiness it would give you.

Now, like the child, millions of people whom you earnestly love and are 
concerned for are – in your view – rotting in the graveyard of the past and are 

1.    Certain,  realized  belief:  an  approximate  translation  of  tahkikî    (Arabic:  t a ḥ q ī q ī ) 
iman. It also has the meaning of realized, ascertained through enquiry, resulting from in-
vestigation, and conﬁrmatory. [ Tr. ]

226

THE RAYS

about to be annihilated when suddenly the reality of belief, like Luqman the 
Wise, shines a light from the window of heart onto the graveyard, which is 
imagined to be a vast place of execution. Through it, all the dead spring to 
life. On their declaring through the tongue of disposition: “ We have not died 
and shall not die; we shall meet with you again, ” you feel an endless joy, 
which belief gives in this world too, proving that belief in Allah is a seed that 
if embodied, would produce a private paradise, becoming the Tuba tree of 
that seed. I told the collective personality this, but in its stubbornness, it said:
“ At  least  we  can  live  like  animals,  passing  our  lives  in  pleasure  and 
enjoyment,  and  by  indulging  in  amusement  and  dissipation,  not  thinking 
about these difﬁcult matters. ”

I told it by way of an answer:
“ You cannot be like an animal, for animals have no past and future. They 
feel neither sorrows or regrets at the past, nor anxiety and fear at the future. 
An  animal  experiences  perfect  pleasure;  it  sleeps  and  rises  and  thanks  its 
Creator. One held down to be slaughtered, even, feels nothing. It wants to 
feel it as the knife cuts, but that disappears as well, and it is saved from the 
pain. This means that the Unseen not being made known, and the things that 
will befall us being veiled are a great instance of divine mercy and compas-
sion. This is more complete for innocent animals. But, O man,  your past 
and future emerge from the Unseen to an extent because of your reason, so 
you are entirely deprived of the unconcern of the animals due to the Unseen 
being  concealed  from  them.  The  regrets  and  painful  separations  coming 
from the past, and the anxieties coming from the future reduce to nothing 
your insigniﬁcant pleasure; they make it a hundred times less than that which 
the animals receive. Since the reality is this, either throw away your intellect 
and become an animal and be saved, or come to your senses through belief; 
listen to the Qur’an and receive pure pleasure a hundred times greater than 
that of the animals in this transitory world too. ” Saying this, I silenced it.

Yet, that obdurate collective personality still turned to me and said: “ At 

least we can live like those Westerners who are without religion. ”

I replied: “ You cannot be like the irreligious people of Europe, either. 
For even if they deny one prophet, they can believe in the others. If they do 
not know the prophets, they may believe in Allah. And even if they do not 
know Allah, they may possess certain personal qualities by virtue of which 
they ﬁnd fulﬁlment. But if a Muslim denies the Prophet of the End of Time 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), who was the ﬁnal and greatest of the 
prophets and whose religion and cause are universal, and if he abandons his 

THE FRUITS OF BELIEF – THIRD TOPIC

227

religion, he will accept no other prophet and perhaps not even Allah. For 
he knows all the prophets and Allah and all perfections through the Prophet 
of the End of Time ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ); the others can 
have no place in his heart without him. It is for this reason that since early 
times  people  have  entered  Islam  from  all  other  religions,  but  no  Muslim 
has become a true Jew, Magian, or Christian. Muslims who abandon their 
religion become irreligious, their characters are corrupted, and they become 
harmful for the country and nation. ” I proved this, and the obstinate collec-
tive personality could ﬁnd no further straw to clutch at, so it vanished and 
went to Hell.

My friends who are studying together with me in this School of Joseph! 
Since the reality is this and the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  proves it as clearly and deci-
sively as sunlight, for twenty years it has broken the obstinacy of the obdu-
rate  and  induced  them  to  believe;  we  should  therefore  follow  the  way  of 
belief and right conduct, which is easy and safe and beneﬁcial for both our 
own worlds, and our futures, and our lives in the hereafter, and our country 
and  nation;  and  spend  our  free  time  reciting  the  suras  of  the  Qur’an  that 
we know instead of indulging in distressing fancies, and learn the meaning 
from friends who teach them; and make up for the prayers we have failed to 
perform in the past, when we should have done; and taking advantage of one 
another’s good qualities, transform this prison into a blessed garden raising 
the seedlings of good character. With good deeds like these, we should do 
our best to make the prison governor and those concerned not torturers like 
the  Angels  of  Hell  standing  over  criminals  and  murderers,  but  righteous 
masters and kindly guards charged with the duties of raising people for Para-
dise in the School of Joseph and supervising their training and education.

The Fourth Topic

The Fourth Topic

Again, there is an explanation of this in A   G u i d e   F o r   Yo u t h . One time, I 

was asked the following question by the brothers who assist me:

“ For ﬁfty days now -and now seven years have passed 1 - you have asked 
nothing at all about this ghastly World War, which has plunged the whole 
world into chaos and is closely connected with the fate of the Islamic world, 
nor have you been curious about it. Whereas some religious and learned per-
sons are leaving the congregation in the mosques and racing to listen to the 
radio. Is there some event more momentous than the war? Or is it harmful in 
some way to be preoccupied with it? ”

I replied to them: Life’s capital is very little and the work to be done is 
much. There are spheres one within the other like concentric circles, from the 
sphere of man’s heart and stomach, and that of his home and body, and that 
of the quarter in which he lives and his town, and his country and land, and 
the globe and humankind, to the spheres of animate beings and the world. 
Each person may have duties in each of those spheres, but the most impor-
tant and permanent of these are those in the smallest sphere, while his least 
important and temporary duties may be in the largest sphere. According to 
this analogy, the largest and smallest are in inverse proportion, but because 
of the attractiveness of the largest sphere, it causes the person to neglect his 
important, necessary duties in the small sphere, busying him with unneces-
sary, trivial, peripheral matters. It destroys the capital of his life for nothing. 
It wastes his precious life on worthless things. Sometimes, the person who 
follows curiously the struggles of the war comes to earnestly support one 
side. He looks favourably on their tyranny and becomes a partner in it.

T h e   A n s w e r   t o   t h e   ﬁ r s t   p o i n t :  Yes, an event more momentous than this 
World  War  and  a  case  more  important  than  that  of  world  supremacy  has 
been opened over the heads of everyone and especially Muslims, so that if 
everyone had the wealth and power of the Germans and English and sense 
as  well,  they  would  unhesitatingly  spend  all  of  it  to  win  that  single  case. 
The case is this: relying on the thousands of promises and pledges of the 
universe’s Owner, Who has disposal over it, hundreds of thousands of the 
most eminent of humankind, and uncounted numbers of its stars and guides, 

1.  This refers to 1946.

228

THE FRUITS OF BELIEF – FOURTH TOPIC

229

have unanimously given news – and some of them have actually seen – that 
for everyone the case has opened by which they may either win, in return for 
belief, or lose, eternal properties as broad as the earth set with palaces and 
gardens. If they do not secure the document of belief, they will lose. And 
this age, many are losing the case because of the plague of materialism. One 
of the diviners of reality and investigators of truth observed that in one place 
out of forty people who died, only a few won; the others lost. Can anything 
take the place of that lost suit, even rule over the whole world?

We  R i s a l e - i   N u r  students know it would be pure lunacy to give up the 
duties which will win the case and abandon the wondrous lawyer who saves 
ninety  per  cent  from  losing  it  and  the  task  which  the  lawyer  employs  us 
in,  and  become  involved  with  peripheral  trivia  as  though  we  were  going 
to remain in the world for ever. We are certain that if each of us had intel-
ligence a hundred times greater than we have, we still would use it only on 
this task.

My  new  brothers  here  in  this  calamity  of  prison!  You  have  seen  the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  the same as my old brothers, who entered here together with 
me. Citing them and thousands of students like them as witnesses, I say, I 
prove, and have proved, that it is the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  that wins that supreme 
case for ninety people out of a hundred, obtains for them certain, realized 
belief, which is the document and warrant that has won the case for twenty 
thousand people in twenty years. It has proceeded from the miraculousness 
of the All-Wise Qur’an and is the leading lawyer at this time. Although these 
eighteen  years  my  enemies  and  the  atheists  and  materialists  have  duped 
some members of the government with their exceedingly cruel plots against 
me, and have had us sent to prison to have us done away with - in the past 
as now, they have been able to cause harm to only two or three of the one 
hundred and thirty pieces of equipment in the steel fortress of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r . This means that for those who want to engage a lawyer it is enough 
merely to obtain it. Also, fear not, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  cannot be banned! With 
the exception of two or three, its treatises are circulating freely among the 
deputies serving the government of the republic, and its leaders. Allah will-
ing, at some time happy governors and guards will distribute those lights to 
the prisoners, like bread and medicine, and so make the prisons into truly 
effective places of reform.

The Fifth Topic

As is described in A   G u i d e   F o r   Yo u t h , there is no doubt that youth will 
depart; it will change into old age and death as certainly as the summer gives 
its place to autumn and winter, and the day changes into evening and night. 
All the revealed scriptures give the good news that if ﬂeeting, transient youth 
is spent on good works, in chastity and within the bounds of good conduct, it 
will gain for the person immortal youth.

If,  on  the  other  hand,  youth  is  spent  on  vice,  just  as  murder  resulting 
from a minute’s anger leads to millions of minutes of imprisonment, so the 
unlawful  pleasures  of  youth  contain  more  pain  than  pleasure  quite  apart 
from being called to account in the hereafter, and the torments of the grave, 
and the regrets arising from their passing, and sins, and the penalties suf-
fered in this world; every youth with sense will corroborate this from his 
own experience.

For example, the pains of jealousy, separation, and unreciprocated love 
transform the partial pleasure found in illicit love into poisonous honey. If 
you want to know how they end up in hospitals due to illnesses resulting 
from their misspent youth, and in prison due to their excesses, and in bars 
and dens of vice and the graveyard due to the distress arising from their 
unnourished hearts and spirits not performing their right functions, go and 
ask  at  the  hospitals,  prisons,  bars,  and  graveyards.  More  than  anything, 
you  will  hear  the  weeping  and  sighs  of  regret  at  the  blows  youths  have 
received  as  the  penalty  for  abusing  their  youth,  and  their  excesses,  and 
illicit pleasures.

Foremost the Qur’an, with numerous of its verses, and all the revealed 
scriptures and books, give the glad tidings that if spent within the bounds of 
moderation, youth is an agreeable divine bounty and sweet, powerful means 
to  good  works  which  yields  the  result  of  shining,  immortal  youth  in  the 
hereafter.

Since the reality is this, and since the bounds of the licit are sufﬁcient 
for enjoyment, and since an hour of unlawful pleasure leads sometimes to a 
punishment of one, or ten, years’ imprisonment; surely it is absolutely nec-
essary to spend the sweet bounty of youth chastely, on the straight path, as 
thanks for the bounty.

[ This consists of a single, brief proof of the pillar of belief, Belief in 
Allah, for which there are numerous decisive proofs and explanations 
in many places in the R i s a l e - i   N u r . ]

In Kastamonu a group of high school students came to me, saying: “ Tell 
us about our Creator, our teachers do not speak of Allah. ” I said to them: 
All the sciences you study continuously speak of Allah and make known the 
Creator, each with its own particular tongue. Do not listen to your teachers; 
listen to them.

For  example,  a  well-equipped  pharmacy  with  life-giving  potions  and 
cures  in  every  jar  weighed  out  in  precise  and  wondrous  measures  doubt-
less shows an extremely skilful, practised, and wise pharmacist. In the same 
way, to the extent that it is bigger and more perfect and better stocked than 
the pharmacy in the marketplace, the pharmacy of the globe of the earth with 
its living potions and medicaments in the jars which are the four hundred 
thousand species of plants and animals shows and makes known to eyes that 
are blind even – by means of the measure or scale of the science of medicine 
that you study – the All-Wise One of Glory, Who is the Pharmacist of the 
mighty pharmacy of the earth.

To take another example: a wondrous factory which weaves thousands 
of sorts of cloth from a simple material doubtless makes known a manufac-
turer and skilful mechanic. In the same way, to whatever extent it is larger 
and more perfect than the human factory, this travelling dominical machine 
known  as  the  globe  of  the  earth  with  its  hundreds  of  thousands  of  heads, 
in each of which are hundreds of thousands of factories, shows and makes 
known  – by  means  of  the  measure  or  scale  of  the  science  of  engineering 
which you study – its Manufacturer and Owner.

And,  for  example,  a  depot,  store,  or  shop  in  which  has  been  brought 
together  and  stored  up  in  regular  and  orderly  fashion  a  thousand  and  one 
varieties of provisions undoubtedly makes known a wondrous owner, pro-
prietor, and overseer of provisions and foodstuffs. In just the same way, to 
whatever degree it is vaster and more perfect than such a store or factory, 
this foodstore of the Most Merciful One known as the globe of the earth, this 
divine ship, this dominical depot and shop holding goods, equipment, and 
conserved food, which in one year travels regularly an orbit of twenty-four

thousand  years,  and  carrying  groups  of  beings  requiring  different  foods 
and passing through the seasons on its journey and ﬁlling the spring with 
thousands  of  different  provisions  like  a  huge  waggon,  brings  them  to  the 
wretched animate creatures whose sustenance has been exhausted in winter, 
– by means of the measure or scale of the science of economics which you 
study – this depot of the earth makes known and makes loved its Manager, 
Organizer, and Owner.

And, for example, let us imagine an army which consists of four hun-
dred thousand nations, and each nation requires different provisions, uses 
different  weapons,  wears  different  uniforms,  undergoes  different  drill, 
and is discharged from its duties differently. If this army and camp has a 
miracle-working  commander  who  on  his  own  provides  all  those  different 
nations  with  all  their  different  provisions,  weapons,  uniforms,  and  equip-
ment without forgetting or confusing any of them, then surely the army and 
camp show the commander and make him loved appreciatively. In just the 
same way, the spring camp of the face of the earth in which every spring a 
newly recruited divine army of the four hundred thousand species of plants 
and  animals  are  given  their  varying  uniforms,  rations,  weapons,  training, 
and demobilizations in utterly perfect and regular fashion by a single Com-
mander-in-Chief  Who  forgets  or  confuses  not  one  of  them  – to  whatever 
extent the spring camp of the face of the earth is vaster and more perfect than 
that human army, – by means of the measure or scale of the military science 
that you study – it makes known to the attentive and sensible, its Ruler, Sus-
tainer, Administrator, and Most Holy Commander, causing wonderment and 
acclaim, and makes Him loved and praised and gloriﬁed.

“ Another  example:  millions  of  electric  lights  that  move  and  travel 
through a wondrous city, their fuel and power source never being exhausted, 
self-evidently make known a wonder-working craftsman and extraordinarily 
talented electrician who manages the electricity, makes the moving lamps, 
sets up the power source, and brings the fuel; they cause others to congratu-
late and applaud him, and to love him. In just the same way, although some 
of the lamps of the stars in the roof of the palace of the world in the city of 
the universe -if they are considered in the way that astronomy says- are a 
thousand times larger than the earth and move seventy times faster than a 
cannonball, they do not spoil their order, nor collide with one another, nor 
become extinguished, nor is their fuel exhausted. According to astronomy, 
which you study, for our sun to continue burning, which is a million times 
larger than the earth and a million times older and is a lamp and stove in one

guesthouse of the Most Merciful One, as much oil as the seas of the earth 
and as much coal as its mountains or as many logs and much wood as a thou-
sand earths are necessary for it not to be extinguished. And however much 
greater and more perfect than this example are the electric lamps of the pal-
ace of the world in the majestic city of the universe, which point with their 
ﬁngers of light to an inﬁnite power and sovereignty which illuminates the 
sun and other lofty stars like it without oil, wood, or coal, not allowing them 
to be extinguished or to collide with one another, though travelling together 
at speed, to that degree – by means of the measure of the science of electric-
ity which you either study or will study – they testify to and make known the 
Monarch, Illuminator, Director, and Maker of the mighty exhibition of the 
universe; they make Him loved, gloriﬁed, and worshipped.

And, for example, take a book in every line of which a whole book is 
ﬁnely written, and in every word of which a sura of the Qur’an is inscribed 
with a ﬁne pen. Being most meaningful with all of its matters corroborat-
ing one another and a wondrous collection showing its writer and author to 
be extraordinarily skilful and capable, it undoubtedly shows its writer and 
author together with all his perfections and arts as clearly as daylight, and 
makes him known. It makes him appreciated with phrases like, “ What won-
ders Allah has willed! ” and “ Blessed be Allah! ” Just the same is the mighty 
book of the universe; we see with our eyes a pen at work which writes on 
the face of the earth, which is a single of its pages, and on the spring, which 
is a single folio, the three hundred thousand plant and animal species, which 
are like three hundred thousand different books, all together, one within the 
other,  without  fault  or  error,  without  mixing  them  up  or  confusing  them, 
perfectly and with complete order, and sometimes writes an ode in a word 
like a tree, and the complete index of a book in a point-like seed. However 
much vaster and more perfect and meaningful than the book in the example 
mentioned above is this compendium of the universe and mighty embodied 
Qur’an of the world, which is inﬁnitely full of meaning and in every word 
of which are numerous instances of wisdom, to that degree – in accordance 
with the extensive measure and far-seeing vision of the natural science that 
you study and the sciences of reading and writing that you have practised 
at school – it makes known the Inscriber and Author of the book of the uni-
verse  together  with  His  inﬁnite  perfections.  Proclaiming  “ Allah  is  Most 
Great! ”, it makes Him known. Uttering phrases like “ Glory be to Allah! ”, it 
describes Him. Acclaiming Him with words like “ All praise be to Allah! ”, 
it makes Him loved.

234

Thus,  hundreds  of  other  sciences  like  these  make  known  the  Glorious 
Creator  of  the  universe  together  with  His  names,  each  through  its  broad 
measure  or  scale,  its  particular  mirror,  its  far-seeing  eyes  and  searching 
gaze; they make known His attributes and perfections.

It is in order to give instruction in this matter, which is a brilliant and 
magniﬁcent proof of divine unity, that the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition 
teaches us about our Creator most often with the verses, 
 
 & % $ I said this to the 
( 13:16 ) P O N  and, ( 6:1 ) 
schoolboys, and they accepted it completely, afﬁrming it by saying: “ End-
less thanks be to Allah, for we have received an absolutely true and sacred 
lesson. May Allah be pleased with you! ” So I said:

Human  beings  are  living  machines  who  are  grieved  with  thousands  of 
different sorrows and receives pleasure in thousands of different ways, and 
despite their utter impotence have innumerable enemies, physical and spir-
itual, and despite their inﬁnite poverty, have countless needs, external and 
inner, and are wretched creatures continuously suffering the blows of death 
and separation. Yet, through belief and worship, they at once become con-
nected  to  a  Monarch  so  Glorious  they  ﬁnd  a  point  of  support  against  all 
their  enemies  and  a  source  of  help  for  all  their  needs,  and  like  everyone 
takes pride at the honour and rank of the lord to whom they are attached, 
you can compare for yourselves how pleased and grateful and thankful and 
full  of  pride  human  beings  become  at  being  connected  through  belief  to 
an inﬁnitely Powerful and Compassionate Monarch, at entering His service 
through worship, and transforming for themselves the announcement of the 
execution of the appointed hour into the papers releasing them from duty.

I repeat to the calamity-stricken prisoners what I said to the schoolboys: 
“The  person  who  recognizes  Him  and  obeys  Him  is  fortunate  even  if  in 
prison, while the person who forgets Him is wretched and a prisoner even 
if he resides in a palace. ” Even, one wronged but fortunate man said to the 
wretched  tyrants  who  were  executing  him:  “ I  am  not  being  executed  but 
being demobilized and departing for where I shall ﬁnd happiness. But I see 
that you are being condemned to eternal execution and am therefore taking 
perfect revenge on you. ” And declaring: “ There is no god but Allah! ”, he 
happily gave up his spirit.

The prisoners in Denizli Prison who were able to have contact with me, 
read the lesson in the Sixth Topic I had at one time given in the tongues of 
the  sciences  to  the  high  school  pupils  in  Kastamonu,  who  had  asked  me: 
“ Tell us about our Creator, ” and having acquired a ﬁrm belief, they felt a 
longing for the hereafter. They requested of me: “ Teach us also about the 
hereafter so that we won’t be led astray by our souls and the satans of these 
times, and they will not again be the cause of our being sent to prison. ” So 
in the face of this request of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students in Denizli Prison and 
the readers of the Sixth Topic, need arose for an explanatory summary of the 
pillar of belief in the hereafter, as well, and I offered them a brief summary 
of various passages from the R i s a l e - i   N u r .

In the Sixth Topic we asked the heavens and the earth about our Crea-
tor, and they described Him to us as clearly as the sun in the tongues of the 
sciences. Now, in the same way, we shall ask ﬁrstly our Sustainer, Whom 
we have learnt about, about the hereafter, then our Prophet, then the Qur’an, 
then  the  other  prophets  and  holy  scriptures,  then  the  angels,  and  then  the 
universe.

In the ﬁrst stage, we ask Allah about the hereafter. He replies through all 
the envoys He has sent, and His decrees, and all His names and attributes: 
“ Yes,  the  hereafter  exists,  and  I  shall  send  you  there. ”  The  Tenth  Word 
has proved and elucidated with twelve brilliant, decisive truths the answers 

235

236

THE RAYS

about the hereafter of a number of names. Deeming those explanations to be 
sufﬁcient, here we shall point them out brieﬂy.

Yes, there is no sovereignty that does not reward those who obey it and 
punish the rebellious. So when the holder of an eternal sovereignty which 
is at the degree of absolute dominicality rewards those who form a relation 
with him through belief and submit to its decrees, and punishes rebellious 
disbelievers who deny his proud sovereignty, it will be in a manner ﬁtting 
for his mercy and beauty, his dignity and glory. Thus, the names Sustainer 
of All the Worlds and Just Monarch reply to our question.

Also, we see as clearly as the sun, as daylight, a general mercy and all-
embracing compassion and muniﬁcence on the face of the earth. For exam-
ple, every spring that mercy adorns all the fruit-bearing trees and plants like 
houris; it ﬁlls their hands with every sort of fruit and they hold them out to 
us, saying: “ Help yourselves and eat! ” It also gives us sweet, healing honey 
to eat from the poisonous bee, and dresses us in the softest silk by means of 
a handless insect. It deposits for us in a handful of tiny seeds pounds of food, 
making those tiny stores into reserve supplies. Such a mercy and compas-
sion surely would not execute these lovable, grateful, worshipping believers 
which they nurture so kindly. They rather dismiss them from their duties in 
this worldly life to bestow on them still more brilliant instances of mercy, 
and in so doing the names of All-Compassionate and Muniﬁcent answer 
our question.

Also, we see before our eyes that a hand of wisdom works in all creatures 
on the face of the earth and a justice is in force with its measures, nothing 
superior to which the human mind can conceive of. For example, a pre-eter-
nal wisdom inscribes in man’s faculty of memory, which is one instance of 
wisdom in his thousands of faculties and physical systems and is as tiny as 
a miniscule seed, his entire life story and the numerous events which touch 
on him, making it into a small library. He then places it in the pocket of his 
mind as a note from the register of his actions which will be published for 
his judgement at the Great Gathering, in order to continuously remind him 
of this. And an eternal justice places on all creatures their members with the 
ﬁnest balance, and makes all of them – from the microbe to the rhinoceros, 
and  the  ﬂy  to  the  s i m u r g h   bird,  and  from  a  ﬂowering  plant  to  the  ﬂower 
of the spring, which opens thousands of millions of ﬂowers in the spring – 
with a beauty of art and balance with no waste within a mutual proportion, 
equilibrium, order and beauty; it gives all living creatures their rights of life 
with perfect balance, and makes good things produce good results and bad 

THE FRUITS OF BELIEF – SEVENTH TOPIC

237

things, bad results; and since the time of Adam it has made itself felt force-
fully through the blows it has dealt to rebellious and tyrannous peoples. Cer-
tainly and without doubt, just as the sun cannot be without the day, so that 
pre-eternal wisdom and eternal justice cannot be without the hereafter. The 
names of All-Wise and Sapient, Just and Equitable would never permit 
the awesome injustice, inequity, and unwisdom of oppressed and oppressor 
being equal in death, and thus they decisively answer our question.

Also,  since  whenever  living  creatures  seek  their  natural  wishes,  which 
are  beyond  their  power,  through  the  tongues  of  their  innate  abilities  and 
essential needs, which is supplication of a sort, all their needs are given to 
them by a most compassionate, hearing, kind unseen hand; and since six or 
seven  out  of  ten  of  human  supplications,  which  are  voluntary,  especially 
those of the prophets and the elect, are accepted in a way contrary to the 
normal course of things; it is understood certainly that behind the veil of the 
Unseen is one who listens and hears the sighs of the suffering and prayers of 
the needy, and replies to them; he sees the least need of the smallest living 
being and compassionately replying by action, gratiﬁes it. There is no pos-
sibility of doubting therefore that the one who includes in his supplication 
all the most important, general supplications of man, the most important of 
creatures, which are connected with all the divine names and attributes and 
are for immortality; and takes behind him all the other prophets, who are 
the suns, stars, and leaders of humankind, making them exclaim: “ Amen! 
Amen! ”;  and  for  whom  benedictions  are  recited  several  times  every  day; 
and to whose supplication all the members of his community rejoin: “ Amen! 
Amen! ”, indeed, in whose supplication all creatures take part, saying: “ Yes, 
O Lord! Do give what he asks! We too want what he seeks! ” – of all the 
causes necessitating resurrection under these irresistible conditions, only a 
single  supplication  of  Muhammad  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace ) 
for immortality in the hereafter and eternal happiness would have been suf-
ﬁcient  reason  for  the  existence  of  Paradise  and  creation  of  the  hereafter, 
which are as easy for divine power as the creation of the spring – stating this, 
the names of Answerer of Prayer, All-Hearing, and All-Compassionate 
answer our question.

Also, since as clearly as the sun is shown by daylight, behind the veil 
is One Who has disposal over the universal death and reviviﬁcation in the 
alternation  of  the  seasons  on  the  earth;  and  a  pen  of  power  inscribes  the 
mighty globe with the ease and orderliness of a garden or even a tree, and 
the splendid spring with the facility and symmetrical adornment of a ﬂower, 
and  the  species  of  plants  and  animals  as  though  they  were  three  hundred

thousand books displaying three hundred thousand samples of resurrection, 
all one within the other and intermingled and mixed up together yet without 
disarrangement or disorder, all resembling each other yet without confusion, 
error, or fault; perfectly, regularly, and meaningfully; and since despite this 
vast profusion that One works with boundless mercy and inﬁnite wisdom; 
and since He has subjugated, decorated, and furnished the vast universe for 
man like a house, and appointing him vicegerent of the earth, committing to 
him the supreme trust, from the bearing of which the mountains, sky, and 
earth  shrank,  and  has  raised  him  to  the  rank  of  commanding  ofﬁcer  over 
other living beings, honoured him with the divine address and conversation, 
and since He has thus bestowed on man this supreme station and in all the 
revealed decrees promised him eternal happiness and immortal life in the 
hereafter; certainly and without doubt He will open up that realm of bliss for 
ennobled and honoured man, which is as easy for His power as the spring, 
and  bring  about  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  and  Last  Judgement  -stating 
this, the names of Granter of Life and Dealer of Death, Ever-Living and 
Self-Subsistent, and All-Powerful and Knowing reply to the question we 
asked of our Creator.

Yes, if one considers the power which every spring raises to life identi-
cally the roots of all the trees and plants and creates the three hundred thou-
sand plant and animal samples of the resurrection of the dead, and if one 
visualizes the thousand year period of each of the communities of Moses and 
Muhammad  ( Upon  whom  be  peace  and  blessings ),  and  they  are  pictured 
in the imagination, it will be seen that the two thousand springs 1 display a 
thousand samples of resurrection and a thousand evidences. One would have  
to be blind and unreasonable a thousand times over to consider bodily resur-
rection difﬁcult for such a power.

Also,  just  as  relying  on  Almighty  Allah’s  thousands  of  promises,  the 
twenty-four thousand prophets, who are the most renowned of humankind, 
have unanimously proclaimed and proved through their miracles that eternal 
happiness and immortality in the hereafter are true; so innumerable people 
of sainthood have put their signature to the same truth through their illumi-
nations and unfoldings. Since this is so, surely this truth is as clear as the 
sun, and those who doubt it are crazy.

Yes, the ideas and judgements of one or two experts in a science or art 
concerning their science refute the opposing ideas of ten men who are not 

1.  It is as though Doomsday has occurred in all past springs and they have died, while 

the following springs have been their resurrections.

THE FRUITS OF BELIEF – SEVENTH TOPIC

239

experts in it, even if they are experts in their own ﬁelds. Similarly, two peo-
ple making a positive statement about a subject, for example, proving the 
crescent moon of Ramadan on the day it is uncertain, or claiming: “ there is 
a garden on the earth where coconuts resembling cans of milk are grown ” 
defeat a thousand deniers, and win the case. For the one making the positive 
statement has only to point out the place where the coconuts are found to 
easily win, whereas the one who denies it can prove his case only by search-
ing the whole face of the earth and demonstrating that the coconuts are not to 
be found anywhere. So one who makes a report of Paradise and the realm of 
bliss and asserts that they exist wins his case by only demonstrating through 
illumination a shadow or distillation of it, like in the cinema, while those 
who deny it can only win by proving their denial by seeing the whole uni-
verse and all time from pre-eternity to post-eternity, and demonstrating it. It 
is because of this that the investigative scholars have agreed on the rule “ on 
condition they are not inherently impossible, denials which are not speciﬁc 
but look to the whole universe like the truths of belief, cannot be proved, ” 
and  have accepted it as a fundamental principle.

In consequence of this deﬁnite truth, while the opposing ideas of thou-
sands of philosophers should not cast the slightest doubt, or even suspicion, 
on even a single truthful report concerning the questions of belief, you may 
understand what a lunacy it is to fall into doubt at the denials of a handful of 
philosophers who concerning the pillars of belief understand no further than 
their eyes see, have no heart, are blind, and have grown distant from spiritual 
matters. For the pillars of faith have been agreed upon by one hundred and 
twenty  thousand  expert  scholars  and  truthful  reporters  with  their  positive 
assertions, and innumerable specialists in the ﬁeld of reality and investiga-
tive scholars.

Also, we see with our own eyes as clearly as daylight both in ourselves 
and  all  around  us  a  comprehensive  mercy  and  all-embracing  wisdom  and 
constant bestowal of grace. We observe too the traces and manifestations 
of  an  awesome  sovereignty  of  dominicality,  a  precise  and  lofty  justice, 
and a proud and glorious government. Indeed, the wisdom which attaches 
instances of wisdom to a tree to the number of its fruits and ﬂowers; and the 
mercy  which  bestows  bounties  and  favours  on  every  human  being  to  the 
number of his faculties, members, and feelings; and the proud, yet gracious 
justice which deals blows at rebellious peoples like those of Noah, Hud, and 
Salih ( Peace be upon them ) and the ‘Ad, Thamud, and people of Pharoah, 
and protects the rights of the least living being; and the verse:

240

THE RAYS

 , + * ) ( ' & % $ # " ! 
( 30:25 ) 1 0 / . -

all state the following with a majestic conciseness:

Just as at the summons of their commander and the sound of the bugle,  
the disciplined soldiers stationed in two barracks spring to arms and their 
duties; so whenever the bugle-call of Israﬁl ( Upon whom be peace ) sum-
mons those lying in death in the vast heavens and in the earth, which are like 
two orderly barracks for the soldiers of the Pre-Eternal Monarch, obedient 
to His command, they will immediately don the uniforms of their bodies and 
rise up. Proving and demonstrating this is the same situation displayed by 
the beings in the barracks of the earth in the spring at the trumpet-blast of 
the Angel of Thunder, and from it is understood the inﬁnite grandeur of the 
sovereignty of dominicality. As is proved in the Tenth Word, it is certainly 
therefore utterly impossible that the realm of the hereafter and arena of the 
resurrection and Great Gathering, which are most deﬁnitely demanded by 
that mercy, wisdom, grace, and justice, should not be inaugurated, and for 
that inﬁnitely beautiful mercy to be transformed into ugly cruelty, and for 
that boundless perfection of wisdom to be turned into inﬁnitely faulty futil-
ity and purposeless wastefulness, and that sweet grace to be transformed into 
bitter treachery, and that ﬁnely balanced and equitable justice to be turned 
into  severe  tyranny,  and  that  utterly  powerful  and  majestic  eternal  sover-
eignty to decline, and with the resurrection not occuring for it to lose all its 
splendour, and for the perfections of its dominicality to be marred by impo-
tence and defect. This would be completely unreasonable and a compounded 
impossibility, outside the bounds of possibility and false and precluded.

For  all  those  with  intelligence  would  surely  understand  what  a  cruel 
unkindness it would be, having nurtured human beings so solicitously and 
given  them  through  faculties  like  the  heart  and  intellect  a  sense  of  long-
ing  for  eternal  happiness  and  everlasting  life  in  the  hereafter,  to  despatch 
them to eternal non-being; and how contrary to wisdom it would be, having 
attached hundreds of purposes and instances of wisdom to only the brain, 
to  waste  through  endless  death  all  the  human  faculties  and  abilities  with 
their  thousands  of  purposes  thus  making  them  devoid  of  all  use,  purpose 
and  result;  and  how  utterly  opposed  to  the  splendour  of  that  sovereignty 
and perfect dominicality it would be, by not carrying out His thousands of 
promises,  to  demonstrate  –  Allah  forbid!  –  His  impotence  and  ignorance.

You may make an analogy with these for grace and justice. Thus, the names 
of  Most Merciful, All-Just, All-Wise, Muniﬁcent, and Ruler answer with 
the above truths the question we asked our Creator about the hereafter, and 
prove it as indubitably and clearly as the sun.

Moreover, we observe that prevailing over everything is a vast and com-
prehensive preservation which records in their seeds, on the tablets of the 
World of Similitudes, in their memories, which are tiny samples of the Pre-
served  Tablet,  and  particularly  in  the  faculty  of  memory,  which  is  a  tiny 
library  in  the  human  brain  which  is  at  the  same  time  very  large,  and  in 
other  mirrors,  physical  and  non-physical,  in  which  they  are  reﬂected,  the 
numerous forms of all living creatures and all things, and the notebooks of 
the duties they perform in accordance with their essential natures, and the 
pages  of  their  deeds  pertaining  to  the  gloriﬁcations  they  perform  towards 
the divine names through the tongues of their beings; it inscribes them in 
these, and records and preserves them. Then, when the time comes -every 
spring, which is a ﬂower of divine power- they display to us all those imma-
terial inscriptions in physical form, proclaim to the universe with millions 
of  tongues  within  that  supreme  ﬂower,  and  with  the  strength  of  millions 
of  examples,  evidences,  and  samples,  the  wondrous  truth  of  resurrection 
expressed in the verse:

( 81:10 ) G F E
It  proves  most  cogently  that  foremost  man,  and  all  living  beings  and  all 
things,  were  created  not  to  topple  over  into  nothingness,  to  fall  into  non-
existence,  to  be  annihilated,  but  to  win  immortality  through  progressing, 
and  permanence  through  being  puriﬁed,  and  to  take  up  the  eternal  duties 
required by their innate capacities.

Yes, we observe every spring that the innumerable plants which die in the 
doomsday of the autumn, and all the trees, roots, seeds, and grains in the res-
urrection of the spring recite the verse ( 81:10 ) G F E Expounding 
each in its own tongue one meaning of the verse, one facet of it, with exam-
ples of the duties it performed in previous years, they all testify to that vast 
preservation. They display in everything the four vast truths of the verse,

( 57:3 ) Ê É È Ç Æ 
and instruct us with the ease and certainty of the spring.

The manifestations of these four names occur in all things from the most 
particular to the most universal. For example, through manifesting the name

receptacle containing the faultless systems of the tree’s creation and all the 
conditions of its formation, thus proving the vastness of divine preservation.
Then, together with the tree’s seeds, its fruit manifests the name of  ُر ِ(cid:114)ٰ
ْ(cid:202)اَو 
they  are  coffers  containing  the  indexes  of  all  the  duties  the  tree  has  per-
formed in accordance with its nature and the principles of its second life, 
thus testifying at a maximum level to divine preservation.

The tree’s physical form, which manifests the name of ُرِ(cid:182)اَ

ّ(cid:147)(cid:170)اَو is a ﬁnely 
proportioned, skilfully decorated garment. Like a seventy-hued robe of the 
houris which has been embroidered with gilded motifs, it demonstrates vis-
ibly the vast power, perfect wisdom, and beautiful mercy within divine pres-
ervation.

As for the machinery within the tree, which manifests the name of ُن ِ(cid:142)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)اَو 
it is a regular, miraculous, faultless factory and workbench, a balanced caul-
dron of food which leaves unnourished none of its branches, fruits, or leaves, 
thus proving as brilliantly as the sun the perfect power, justice, and beautiful 
mercy and wisdom within divine preservation.

Similarly, in respect of the annual seasons the globe is a tree. Through

the  manifestation  of  the  name  of  ُلَ

to divine preservation in the season of autumn are small collections of the 
divine  commands  concerning  the  formation  of  the  tree  of  the  face  of  the 
earth, which when it is enrobed in the garment of spring, puts forth millions 
of branches and twigs, and fruits and ﬂowers. So too those seeds are lists of 
the principles proceeding from divine determining, and the tiny pages of the 
tree’s deeds of the previous summer, and the notebooks of its tasks, which 
demonstrate self-evidently that they function through the inﬁnite power, jus-
tice, wisdom, and mercy of a Glorious and Muniﬁcent Preserver.

Then  the  end  of  the  annual  tree  of  the  earth  is  -in  the  second  autumn, 
its  depositing  in  those  tiny  containers  all  the  duties  it  has  performed,  all 
the gloriﬁcations it has recited before the divine names in accordance with 
its creation, and all the pages of its deeds that it will publish the following 
resurrection of spring,- its handing them over to the hand of wisdom of the 
Glorious Preserver and reciting the name of ُر ِ(cid:114)ٰ
verse in innumerable tongues.

The evident face of the tree is, -by its opening three hundred thousand 
universal  sorts  of  blossoms,  which  demonstrate  three  hundred  thousand 
examples  and  signs  of  the  resurrection  of  the  dead;  and  its  spreading  out 
innumerable  tables  of  mercifulness,  providence,  compassionateness,  and 
muniﬁcence; and its offering banquets to living beings,- its reciting the name 
of  ُرِ(cid:182)اَ

The inner face of this majestic tree is a cauldron and workbench running 
precisely and in orderly fashion incalculable numbers of regular machines 
and ﬁnely balanced factories, which cook thousands of pounds of food out 
of one ounce and offer it to the hungry. It works with such precision and 
balance that it leaves no room for chance to interfere. Like some angels who 
glorify  Allah  with  a  thousand  tongues,  with  the  inner  face  of  the  earth  it 
proclaims the name of ُن ِ(cid:142)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا َوُ(cid:182) in a hundred thousand ways, and proves it.
Just as in respect of its annual life, the earth is a tree and makes the divine 
preservation within those four names a key to the door of resurrection, so 
in respect of its worldly life, it is again a well-ordered tree, whose fruits are 
sent  to  the  market  of  the  hereafter.  It  is  a  place  of  manifestation  of  those 
four names and mirror to them so broad, and road leading to the hereafter 
so lengthy, our minds are incapable of comprehending and describing it; we 
can only say this much:

As  the  hands  of  a  weekly  clock  which  count  the  seconds,  minutes, 
hours, and days resemble each other and prove each other, and one who 
sees the movement of the second hand is bound to assent to the movement 
of the others; so the days, which count the seconds of this world, which is a 
vast clock of the Glorious Creator of the Heavens and Earth, and the years, 
which count its minutes, and the centuries, which show its hours, and the 
ages, which make known its days, all resemble and prove each other. So 
too  the  name  of  Preserver  and  those  of  ُن ِ(cid:142)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)اَو ُرِ(cid:182)اَ
ْ(cid:202)ا َوُ(cid:182) 
inform us through innumerable signs that as certainly as the morning of 
this night will come, and this winter’s spring, so will the everlasting spring 
and eternal morning come of the dark winter of this transitory world, thus 
answering  with  the  above  truths  the  question  of  resurrection  concerning 
which we asked our Creator.

desire for immortality would not be satisﬁed, and who love to the degree of

loved and is loved.. and all of whose faculties, which encompass the uni-

whole universe whose deeds are written down by the “noble scribes” of that 
name and who more than anything else receive its attention..

As required by the above twenty truths, most certainly and without any 
doubt there will be a resurrection and judgement for human beings, and in 
accordance with the name of Truth, they will receive reward for their above 
duties and punishment for their faults, and in accordance with the name of 
Preserver, they will be questioned and called to account for their actions, 
all of which have been recorded, and the doors will be opened of the feast-
ing halls of everlasting bliss in the eternal realm, and of the prison of eter-
nal misery; humans, who have been ofﬁcers with command over numerous 
species of beings in this world, and has intervened in them and sometimes 
thrown them into confusion, will not enter the soil never to be questioned 
concerning their actions, nor lay down in concealment not to be roused. For 
to hear the buzz of the ﬂy and to answer it actively by giving it its rights of 
life, and not to hear the prayers for eternity made through the tongues of the 
above twenty truths of innumerable human rights which reverberate through 
the heavens and earth like thunder, and to transgress all those rights, and for 
a wisdom which as is testiﬁed to by the order of the ﬂy’s wing wastes not 
even such a wing, to waste utterly the human abilities, which are bound by 
those truths, and their hopes and desires, which reach out to eternity, and 
the many bonds and truths of the universe which nourish those abilities and 
desires, would be such an injustice and so impossible and such a tyrannical 
ugliness  that  all  beings  which  testify  to  the  names  of  Truth,  Preserver, 
All-Wise, All-Beauteous, and All-Compassionate reject it, declaring it to 
be utterly impossible and precluded. Thus, in reply to our question to our 
Creator about resurrection, the names of Truth, Preserver, All-Wise, All-
Beauteous, and All-Compassionate, say: “ Just as we are truth and reality, 
and the beings that testify to us are true, so the resurrection of the dead is 
true and certain. ”

And since... I was going to write more, but since the above is as clear as 

the sun, I have curtailed the discussion.

Thus,  making  an  analogy  with  the  matters  in  the  above  examples  and 
“ sinces, ” through their manifestations and reﬂections in beings, all Almighty 
Allah’s hundred, indeed a thousand, names which look to the universe prove 
self-evidently the One they signify; so too do they demonstrate the resurrec-
tion of the dead and hereafter, and prove them deﬁnitively.

Also, just as through all His decrees and the scriptures He has revealed 
and most of His names, by which He is described, our Sustainer gives us 

246

THE RAYS

sacred and decisive answers to the question we asked of Him, our Creator; 
so He causes it to be answered through His angels, and in another fashion 
through their tongue:

“ There have been hundreds of incidents unanimously attested to since 
the time of Adam of your meeting both with spirit beings and with us, and 
there are innumerable signs and evidences of our existence and worship and 
that of the spirit beings. In agreement with each other, we have told your 
leaders when we have met with them that we travel through the halls of the 
hereafter and in some of its apartments, and we always say this. We have 
no doubt that the ﬁne, eternal halls that we have wandered through, and the 
well-appointed decorated palaces and dwellings beyond them await impor-
tant  guests,  in  order  to  accommodate  them.  We  give  you  certain  news  of 
this. ” They reply to our question thus.

Also, since our Creator appointed Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ) as the greatest teacher, best master, and truest guide, 
who is neither confused nor confuses, and sent him as His last envoy, before 
anything, in order to progress and advance from the degree of knowledge 
of certainty to those of vision of certainty and absolute certainty, we should 
ask this master the question we asked of our Creator. For just as that Being, 
through his thousand miracles, which were a mark of our Creator’s conﬁr-
mation, and as a miracle of the Qur’an, proved that the Qur’an is true and 
Allah’s Word; so, through its forty aspects of miraculousness, as a miracle 
of his, the Qur’an proves that he was true and Allah’s Messenger. The real-
ity of resurrection which they prove -one, the tongue of the Manifest World, 
claimed it throughout his life, conﬁrmed by all the prophets and saints, and 
the other, the tongue of the World of the Unseen, claims it with thousands 
of its verses, conﬁrmed by all the revealed scriptures and truths of the uni-
verse,- is as certain as the sun and daylight.

Yes, a question like resurrection, which is a most strange and awesome 
matter and beyond the reason, could only be solved through the instruction 
of two such wondrous masters, and understood.

The reason the early prophets did not explain resurrection in detail like 
the Qur’an was that at that time mankind was still at a primitive stage of 
nomadism. There is little detailed explanation in preliminary instruction.

And since the angels inform us that they have seen the hereafter and the 
dwellings of the eternal realm, evidences testifying to the existence and wor-
ship of the angels, spirits, and spirit beings, are also indirect evidence for the 
existence of the hereafter.

THE FRUITS OF BELIEF – SEVENTH TOPIC

247

And since after divine unity the thing Muhammad ( Upon whom be bless-
ings  and  peace )  most  constantly  claimed  and  asserted  throughout  his  life 
was the hereafter, certainly all his miracles and proofs which point to his 
messengership and veracity in one way testify indirectly to the existence of 
the hereafter and that it will come.

And since one quarter of the Qur’an is about resurrection and the here-
after and it aims to prove it with thousands of its verses, and gives news of 
it, all the proofs and evidences of the Qur’an’s veracity prove indirectly the 
existence of the hereafter, and its being thrown open.

Now see how ﬁrm and certain is this pillar of belief!

A Summary of the Eighth Topic

A Summary of the Eighth Topic

[ In the Seventh Topic, we questioned numerous levels of beings about 
the  resurrection  of  the  dead,  but  curtailed  the  discussion  because  the 
replies given by the Creator’s names afforded such powerful certainty, 
they left no need for further questions. Now in this Topic are summa-
rized  a  hundredth  of  the  beneﬁts  of  belief  in  the  hereafter,  including 
those which result in happiness both in this world and in the next. The 
Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition leaves no need for further explana-
tion concerning the happiness of the hereafter, so we refer the subject 
to the Qur’an. And leaving the explanations of worldly happiness to the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , here we shall describe in summary form three or four out 
of hundreds of results of belief in the hereafter which look to personal 
life and social life. ]

The First

The First

Just as, contrary to other living beings, human beings have relations with 
their  homes,  so  they  have  relations  with  the  world,  and  just  as  they  have 
relations with their relatives, so by nature they have earnest relations with 
humankind.  And  just  as  they  desire  temporary  permanence  in  this  world, 
so  they  passionately  desire  immortality  in  the  realm  of  eternity.  And  just 
as they strive to meet the need of their stomachs for food, so they are  by 
nature compelled to strive to provide for the stomachs of their minds, hearts, 
spirits, and humanity. They have such hopes and desires that nothing apart 
from eternal happiness can satisfy them. As is mentioned in the Tenth Word, 
even, when small, I asked my imagination: “Do you want to live for a mil-
lion years and rule the world but then cease to exist, or to live for ever but 
have an ordinary and difﬁcult existence?” I saw that my imagination wanted 
the latter, feeling pain at the ﬁrst, and said: “I want to live for ever, even if 
in Hell! ”

Thus,  since  the  pleasures  of  this  world  do  not  satisfy  the  imaginative 
faculty, which is a servant of human nature, that comprehensive nature is 
certainly attached to eternity. For we humans, therefore, who despite being 
afﬂicted  with  these  boundless  hopes  and  desires  as  capital  have  only  an 
insigniﬁcant faculty of will and absolute poverty, belief in the hereafter is 
a treasury of such strength and sufﬁciency; is such a means of pleasure and 
happiness, source of help, refuge, and means of consolation in the face of 

248

THE FRUITS OF BELIEF – EIGHTH TOPIC

249

the endless sorrows of this world, and is such a fruit and beneﬁt that if the 
life of this world were to be sacriﬁced on the way of gaining it, it would still 
be cheap.

Second Fruit and Beneﬁt

Its second fruit and beneﬁt, which looks to personal life

This is a consequence of great importance which is explained in the Third 

Topic and about which is a footnote in A   G u i d e   F o r   Yo u t h .

The  greatest  and  most  constant  anxiety  of  people  is  their  entering  the 
place of execution that is the graveyard, the same as their friends and rela-
tions have entered it. Wretched people, who are ready to sacriﬁce their very 
souls for a single friend, think of the thousands, millions, or thousands of 
millions of friends who have been eliminated and have parted for all eter-
nity,  and  suffer  torments  worse  than  Hell.  Just  at  that  point  belief  in  the 
hereafter comes, opens their eyes, and raises the veil. It tells them: “Look!” 
they look with belief, and seeing that those friends have been saved from 
eternal death and decay and are awaiting them happily in a luminous world, 
they receive a pleasure of the spirit that intimates the pleasures of Paradise. 
Sufﬁcing with the explanations and proofs of this consequence in the R i s a l e -
i   N u r , we cut this short here.

A Third Beneﬁt

A third beneﬁt pertaining to personal life

The superiority of human beings over other living beings and their high 
rank are in respect of their elevated qualities, comprehensive abilities, uni-
versal worship, and their extensive spheres of existence. However, the vir-
tues they acquire like zeal, love, brotherhood, and humanity are to the extent 
of the ﬂeeting present, but the present is squeezed between the past and the 
future, which are both non-existent, and dead, and black.

For example, a person loves and serves his father, brother, wife, nation, 
and country, whom he formerly did not know and after parting from them, 
will never see again. He would very rarely be able to achieve complete loy-
alty and sincerity, and his virtues and perfections would diminish proportion-
ately. Then, just as because of his intelligence, he is about to fall headlong 
from being the highest of the animals to being the lowest and most wretched, 
belief  in  the  hereafter  comes  to  his  assistance.  It  expands  the  present,  as 
constricting as the grave, so that it encompasses the past and future and is as 
broad as the world, and shows the bounds of existence to stretch from pre-
eternity to post-eternity. Thinking of his father being in the realm of bliss 
and world of spirits and the fraternity of his brothers continuing to eternity, 
and knowing that his wife will be a beautiful companion in Paradise also, 

250

THE RAYS

he will love and respect them, be kindly and assist them. He will not exploit 
the important duties which are for relationships in that broad sphere of life 
and existence for the worthless matters of this world, with its petty hatreds 
and interests. His good qualities and attainments will advance to the degree 
he is successful in being earnestly loyal and truly sincere, and his humanity 
will increase. Although he does not receive the pleasure from life that a spar-
row receives, he becomes the most eminent and happy guest in the universe, 
superior to all the animals, and the best loved and most acceptable servant 
of the universe’s Owner. This consequence has also been elucidated with 
proofs in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , so here we sufﬁce with this.

A Fourth Beneﬁt

A fourth beneﬁt of belief in the hereafter, which looks to social life

A summary of this result is set forth in the Ninth Ray of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , 

it is as follows:

Children, which form a quarter of humankind, can live a human existence 
only through belief in the hereafter, and sustain their human capacity. They 
otherwise live only childish, empty existences, blunting their grievous pains 
with triﬂing playthings. For the effect of the constant deaths around them 
of children like themselves on their sensitive minds, and weak hearts which 
in the future will nurture far-reaching desires, and their vulnerable spirits, 
makes their minds and lives into instruments of torture. But then, through 
instruction in belief in the hereafter, in place of their anxieties and the play-
things behind which they hid so as not to see those deaths, they feel a joy and 
expansion, and say: “ My brother or my friend has died and become a bird in 
Paradise. He is ﬂying around and enjoying himself better than we are. And 
my mother has died, but she has gone to divine mercy. She will again take 
me into her embrace in Paradise and I shall see her again. ” They may live in 
a state beﬁtting humanity.

It is only in belief in the hereafter that the elderly, who form another quar-
ter of humankind, can ﬁnd consolation, in the face of the close extinction of 
their lives and their entering the soil, and their ﬁne and lovable worlds com-
ing to an end. Those kindly, venerable fathers and devoted, tender mothers 
would otherwise feel such a disturbance of the spirit and tumult of the heart 
that the world would become a despairing prison for them and life, a ghastly 
torture.  But  belief  in  the  hereafter  says  to  them:  “ Don’t  worry!  You  will 
have an immortal youth; a shining, endless life awaits you. You will be joy-
fully reunited with the children and relatives you have lost. All your good 
deeds  have  been  preserved  and  you  will  receive  your  reward. ”  It  affords 

THE FRUITS OF BELIEF – EIGHTH TOPIC

251

them such solace and joy that were they to experience old age a hundred 
times over all at the same time, it would not cause them despair.

One  third  of  humankind  is  formed  by  the  youth.  With  their  turbulent 
emotions, the youths are not always able to control their bold intelligences 
and are overcome by their passions. If then they lose their faith in the here-
after and do not recall the torments of Hell, it puts in danger the property 
and honour of the upright people in society and the peace and self-respect of 
the weak and elderly. One youth may destroy the happiness of a contented 
home for one minute’s pleasure, then pay the penalty in prison for four or 
ﬁve years, degenerating into a wild animal. If belief in the hereafter comes 
to his assistance and he swiftly comes to his senses, saying: “ It’s true the 
government informers can’t see me and I can hide from them, but the angels 
of a Glorious Monarch Who has a prison like Hell see me and are recording 
all my evil deeds. I am not free and independent; I am a traveller charged 
with duties. One day I too will be old and weak. ” He suddenly starts to feel 
a sympathy and respect for those he wanted to cruelly assault. This too is 
explained with proofs in the R i s a l e - i  N u r , so deeming that sufﬁcient, we here 
cut it short.

Another  important  section  of  humankind  are  the  sick,  the  oppressed, 
the  disaster-stricken  like  us,  the  poor  and  the  life  prisoners;  if  belief  in 
the hereafter does not come to their aid, death, of which they are continu-
ously reminded by illness, unavenged wrongs, the arrogant treachery of the 
oppressor, from whom they cannot save their honour, the terrible despair of 
having lost their property or children in serious disasters, the distress at hav-
ing to suffer the torments of prison for ﬁve or ten years because of a minute 
or two, or an hour or two, of pleasure – these surely make the world into a 
prison for such unfortunates, and life into agonizing torment. But if belief 
in the hereafter comes to their assistance, they suddenly breathe freely, and 
according to the degree of their belief, their distress, despair, anxiety, anger, 
and desire for vengeance abate, sometimes partially, sometimes entirely.

I can even say that if belief in the hereafter had not helped me and some 
of  my  brothers  in  this  fearsome  calamity  of  our  being  imprisoned  for  no 
reason, to stand it for one day would have been as grievous as death and 
driven us to resign from life. But endless thanks be to Allah, despite suffer-
ing the distress of my brothers, whom I love as much as my life, as well as 
my own, in addition to the weeping and sorrow of thousands of copies of 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and my gilded, decorated, valuable books, which I love as 
much as my eyes, and although I could never stand the slightest insult or to 

252

THE RAYS

be dominated, I swear that the light and strength of belief in the hereafter 
afforded  me  the  patience,  endurance,  solace,  and  steadfastness;  indeed,  it 
ﬁlled me with enthusiasm to gain greater reward in the proﬁtable, instructive 
exertions of this ordeal, for as I said at the beginning of this treatise, I knew 
myself to be in a good  m e d r e s e  or school worthy of the title of Medrese-i 
Yusuﬁye ( School of Joseph ). If it were not for the occasional sickness and 
irritability arising from old age, I would have worked at my lessons even 
better and with greater ease of mind. However, we have strayed from the 
subject; I hope it will be forgiven.

Also, everyone’s home is a small world for him, and even a small Para-
dise. If belief in the hereafter does not underlie the home’s happiness, the 
members of the family will suffer anguish and anxiety to the extent of their 
compassion, love, and attachment. Their paradise will either turn into Hell, 
or it will numb their minds with amusements and dissipation. Like the ostrich 
which sees the hunter but can neither ﬂy nor escape and sticks its head in the 
sand so as not to be seen, they plunge their heads into heedlessness so that 
death, decline, and separation do not spot them. They ﬁnd a way out by tem-
porarily blocking out their feelings in lunatic fashion. Because, for example, 
the mother trembles constantly at seeing her children, for whom she would 
sacriﬁce her soul, exposed to dangers. While the children all the time feel 
sorrow and fear at being unable to save their father and brother from unceas-
ing calamities. Thus, in the upheavals of this worldly life, the supposedly 
happy life of the family loses its happiness in many respects, and the rela-
tions and closeness in this brief life do not result in true loyalty, heartfelt 
sincerity,  disinterested  service  and  love.  Good  character  declines  propor-
tionately, and is even lost. Whereas if belief in the hereafter enters the home, 
it illuminates it completely, and its members have sincere respect, love, and 
compassion for each other, are loyal and disregard each other’s faults, to the 
degree not of their relations, closeness, kindness, and love in this brief life, 
but of their continuation in the realm of the hereafter, in everlasting happi-
ness, and their good character increases accordingly. The happiness of true 
humanity starts to unfold in such a home. This too is elucidated with proofs 
in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , so we cut this short here.

Towns  are  also  households  for  their  inhabitants.  If  belief  in  the  here-
after does not govern among the members of that large family such vices 
as malice, self-interest, false pretences, selﬁshness, artiﬁciality, hypocrisy, 
bribery, and deception will dominate, displacing sincerity, cordiality, virtue, 
zeal, self-sacriﬁce, seeking Allah’s pleasure and the reward of the hereafter,

which are the bases of good conduct and morality. Anarchy and savagery 
will govern under the superﬁcial order and humanity, poisoning the life of 
the town. The children will become troublemakers, the youth will take to 
drink, the strong will embark on oppression, and the elderly start to weep.

By analogy, the country is also a household, and the fatherland, the home 
of the national family. If belief in the hereafter rules in these broad homes, 
true respect, earnest compassion, disinterested love, mutual assistance, hon-
est service and social relations, unhypocritical charity, virtue, modest great-
ness, and excellence will all start to develop.

It says to the children: “ Give up messing around; there is Paradise to be 

won! ”, and teaches them self-control through instruction in the Qur’an.

It says to the youth: “ Hell-ﬁre exists; give up your drunkenness! ”, and 

brings them to their senses.

It  says  to  the  oppressor:  “ There  is  severe  torment;  you  will  receive  a 

blow! ”, and makes them bow to justice.

It says to the elderly: “ Awaiting you is everlasting happiness in the here-
after  far  greater  than  all  the  happiness  you  have  lost  here,  and  immortal 
youth; try to win them! ” It turns their tears into laughter.

It shows its favourable effects in every group, particular and universal, 
and  illuminates  them.  The  sociologists  and  moralists,  who  are  concerned 
with the social life of mankind, should take special note. If the rest of the 
thousands of beneﬁts and advantages of belief in the hereafter are compared 
with the ﬁve or six we have alluded to, it will be understood that it is only 
belief that is the means of happiness in this world and the next, and in the 
lives of both.

Deeming  sufﬁcient  the  powerful  replies  to  the  frail  doubts  concerning 
bodily resurrection described in the Twenty-Eighth Word of the R i s a l e - i  N u r  
and in others of its treatises, we merely make the following brief indication:
The most comprehensive mirror of the divine names lies in corporeality. 
The richest and most active centre of the divine aims in the creation of the 
universe lies in corporeality. The greatest variety of the multifarious domini-
cal bounties lies in corporeality. The greatest multiplicity of the seeds of the 
supplications  and  thanks  human  beings  offer  to  their  Creator  through  the 
tongues of their needs again lies in corporeality. And the greatest diversity 
of the seeds of the non-physical and spirit worlds also lies in corporeality.

By analogy with this, since hundreds of universal truths are centred in 
corporeality,  in  order  to  multiply  corporeality  and  make  it  manifest  the 

254

THE RAYS

above truths on the face of the earth, with awesome activity and speed, the 
All-Wise Creator clothes the successive caravans of beings in existence and 
sends  them  to  that  exhibition.  Then  He  discharges  them  and  sends  others 
in  their  place,  constantly  making  the  factory  of  the  universe  run.  Weav-
ing corporeal products, He makes the earth into a seedbed of the hereafter 
and  Paradise.  In  fact,  in  order  to  gratify  man’s  physical  stomach,  He  lis-
tens to and accepts the prayer for immortality his stomach makes through 
the tongue of disposition, affording it the greatest importance, and in order 
to answer it, prepares in corporeality incalculable numbers of innumerable 
sorts and kinds of artistic foods and precious bounties, all affording differ-
ent pleasures. This demonstrates self-evidently and without doubt that in the 
hereafter, the most numerous and various of the pleasures of Paradise will be 
corporeal, and that the bounties of the eternal abode of bliss, which everyone 
wants and is familiar with, will be corporeal.

Is it at all possible that the Most Compassionate All-Powerful One, the 
All-Knowing and Muniﬁcent One, Who accepts the prayer offered through 
the  tongue  of  disposition  by  the  common  stomach,  and  gratifying  it  with 
inﬁnitely miraculous physical foods, always replies in fact, intentionally and 
without chance, would not accept the numerous, general prayers of human 
beings – who are the most important result of the universe, vicegerents of the 
earth, and the Creator’s choice beings and worshippers – which they offer 
through the supreme stomach of humanity for universal, elevated corporeal 
pleasures in the eternal realm, which they always desire and with which they 
are familiar and which by nature they want; that He should not respond in 
fact with bodily resurrection, and not gratify them eternally? Should He hear 
the buzz of the ﬂy, and not hear the crashing thunder? Should He equip a 
common soldier to perfection, and ignore the army, giving it no importance? 
To do so would be impossible and absurd.

Yes, in accordance with the explicit statement of the verse:

( 43:71 )  ¸ ¶ μ ´ ³ ² 
human beings will experience in Paradise in ﬁtting form the physical pleas-
ures  with  which  they  are  most  familiar  and  samples  of  which  they  have 
tasted in this world. The rewards for the sincere thanks and particular wor-
ship offered by each of their members, like the tongue, eye, and ear, will be 
given through physical pleasures particular to those members. The Qur’an 
of Miraculous Exposition describes the physical pleasures so explicitly, it is 
impossible not to accept the apparent meaning and to make forced interpre-
tations of them.

THE FRUITS OF BELIEF – EIGHTH TOPIC

255

The fruits and results of belief in the hereafter, then, show that just as 
the reality and needs of the stomach, one of the human members, are deci-
sive  evidence  for  the  existence  of  food;  so  the  reality  and  perfections  of 
human beings, and their innate needs and desire for eternity, and their abili-
ties and potentialities, which demand the above- mentioned consequences 
and beneﬁts of belief in the hereafter, are certain evidence for the hereafter 
and Paradise and eternal physical pleasures, and they testify to their certain 
existence. Similarly, the reality of the universe’s perfections and its mean-
ingful creational signs, and all its truths connected with the above human 
truths are evidence for the certain existence of the realm of the hereafter, the 
resurrection of the dead, and the opening up of Heaven and Hell. This has 
been proved so brilliantly in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and particularly in the Tenth, 
Twenty-Eighth  ( both  Stations ),  and  Twenty-Ninth  Words,  and  the  Ninth 
Ray,  and  the  Supplication  of  the  Third  Ray,  that  they  leave  no  room  for 
doubt. Referring readers to them, we cut short this long story here.

The Qur’anic descriptions of Hell are also so clear and explicit they leave 
no need for further description. Only, referring to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  detailed 
explanation of one or two points which dispel one or two ﬂimsy doubts, we 
shall set forth a very brief summary.

First Point

F i r s t   P o i n t :  The thought of Hell and the fear it induces does not dispel 
the pleasures of the above fruits of belief. For boundless divine mercy says 
to the fearful man: Come to me! Enter the door of repentance, then the exist-
ence of Hell will not frighten you, but make known completely the pleasures 
of Paradise, and avenge you and all creatures whose rights have been trans-
gressed, and give you enjoyment. If you are so submerged in misguidance 
you  cannot  extricate  yourself,  the  existence  of  Hell  is  still  immeasurably 
better than eternal annihilation, and is also a sort of kindness for the disbe-
lievers. For human beings, and even animals with young, receive pleasure at 
the pleasure and happiness of their relatives, offspring, and friends, and in 
one respect are happy.

Therefore, O atheist! Because of your misguidance, you will either tum-
ble into non-being at your eternal execution, or you will enter Hell! As for 
non-existence,  which  is  absolute  evil,  since  it  consists  of  the  annihilation 
together with yourself of all your relatives, forbears and descendants, whom 
you love and at whose happiness you are to an extent happy, it causes pain to 
your spirit, heart, and inner nature severer than a thousand Hells. For if there 
were no Hell, there would be no Paradise. Owing to your disbelief, every-
thing falls into non-existence. If you go to Hell and remain within the sphere 
of existence, those you love and your relatives will be happy in Paradise, 

256

THE RAYS

or will be the recipients of compassion in some respects within the spheres 
of existence. This means you should support the idea of Hell existing. To 
oppose it is to support non-existence, which is to support the elimination of 
innumerable friends’ happiness.

Yes, Hell is an awesome, majestic, existent land which performs the wise 
and just function of being the place of incarceration of the Glorious Sover-
eign of the sphere of existence, which is pure good. It performs numerous 
other functions, besides that of prison, and fulﬁls many purposes and carries 
out many duties connected with the eternal realm. It is also the awe- inspir-
ing habitation of many living creatures like the Angels of Hell.

Second Point

S e c o n d   P o i n t :   There  is  no  contradiction  between  the  existence  and 
ghastly torments of Hell, and inﬁnite mercy, true justice, and wisdom with 
its balance and absence of waste. Indeed, mercy, justice, and wisdom require 
its existence. For to punish a tyrant who tramples the rights of a thousand 
innocents and to kill a savage animal who tears to pieces a hundred cowed 
animals, is for the oppressed a thousandfold mercy within justice. While to 
pardon the tyrant and leave the savage beast free, is for hundreds of wretches 
a hundredfold pitilessness in place of that single act of misplaced mercy.

Similarly, among those who will enter Hell is the absolute disbeliever. 
For through his disbelief and denial he both transgresses the rights of the 
divine names, and through denying the testimony of beings to those names, 
he transgresses their rights, and by denying the elevated duties of gloriﬁca-
tion of creatures before the divine names he violates their rights, and through 
denying their being mirrors to and responding with worship to the manifes-
tation of divine dominicality, which is the purpose of the universe’s creation 
and a reason for its existence and continuance, he transgresses their rights in 
a way. His disbelief is therefore a crime and wrong of such vast proportions 
it may not be forgiven, and deserves the threat of the verse,

( 4:48 )  x w v u t s r 
Not to cast him into Hell would comprise innumerable instances of merci-
lessness  to  innumerable  claimants  whose  rights  had  been  transgressed,  in 
place of a single misplaced act of mercy. Just as those claimants demand the 
existence of Hell, so do divine dignity and majesty, and tremendousness and 
perfection most certainly demand it.

Yes, if a worthless rebel who assaults the people says to the proud ruler 
of the place: “ You can’t put me in prison! ”, affronting his dignity, if there 
is no prison in the town, the ruler will have one made just to throw the ill-
mannered wretch into it. In just the same way, with his disbelief the absolute 

THE FRUITS OF BELIEF – EIGHTH TOPIC

257

disbeliever  seriously  affronts  the  dignity  of  divine  glory,  and  through  his 
denial offends the splendour of His power, and through his aggression dis-
turbs the perfection of His dominicality. Even if there were not many things 
necessitating the functions of Hell and many reasons for and instances of 
wisdom in its existence, it is the mark of that dignity and glory to create a 
Hell for disbelievers such as that, and to cast them into it.

Moreover, the very nature of disbelief makes known Hell. Yes, just as 
if the true nature of belief were to be embodied, it could with its pleasures 
take on the form of a private paradise, and in this respect gives secret news 
of Paradise; so, as is proved with evidences in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and is also 
alluded to in the previous Topics, disbelief, and especially absolute disbe-
lief, and dissembling, and apostasy, are the cause of such dark and awful 
pains  and  spiritual  torment  that  if  they  were  to  be  embodied,  they  would 
become a private Hell for the apostate, and in this way tell of the greater Hell 
in concealed manner. The tiny truths in the seedbed of this world produce 
shoots in the hereafter. Thus, this poisonous seed indicates that particular 
tree of Zaqqum, saying: “ I am its origin. For the unfortunate who bears me 
in his heart, my fruit is a private sample of that Zaqqum tree. ”

Disbelief  is  aggression  against  innumerable  rights,  and  is  certainly  an 
inﬁnite  crime  and  deserves  inﬁnite  punishment.  Human  justice  considers 
a sentence of ﬁfteen years imprisonment ( nearly eight million minutes ) to 
be justice for a one minute’s murder, and conformable with general rights 
and interests. Therefore, since one instance of disbelief is the equivalent of 
a  thousand  murders,  to  suffer  torments  for  nearly  eight  thousand  million 
minutes for one minute’s absolute disbelief is in conformity with that law of 
justice. A person who passes a year of his life in disbelief deserves punish-
ment for close on two million million eight hundred eighty thousand mil-
lion minutes, and manifests the meaning of the verse,  ( 4:169 ) | { z  
However...

The All-Wise Qur’an’s miraculous descriptions of Heaven and Hell, and 
the  proofs  of  their  existence  in  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  a  Qur’anic  commentary 
which proceeds from the Qur’an, leave no need for others.

As is shown by numerous verses like,

were certain due to their revelations and illuminations, the most momentous 
question  facing  humankind  is  to  be  saved  from  Hell.  Hell  is  also  a  vast, 
awesome, and supremely important truth of the universe which some of the 
people of illumination and witnessing and those who investigate the realities 
have observed, and seeing some of its distillations and shadows, have cried 
out in terror: “ Preserve us from the Fire! ”

Yes, the confrontation and interpenetration of good and evil in the uni-
verse, and pain and pleasure, light and darkness, heat and cold, beauty and 
ugliness,  and  guidance  and  misguidance  occur  for  a  vast  instance  of  wis-
dom.  For  if  there  were  no  evil,  good  would  not  be  known.  If  there  were 
no pain, pleasure would not be understood. Light without darkness would 
lack all importance. The degrees of heat are realized through cold. Through 
ugliness,  a  single  instance  of  beauty  becomes  a  thousand  instances,  and 
thousands of varying degrees of beauty come into existence. If there were 
no Hell, many of the pleasures of Paradise would remain concealed. Like 
these, everything may be known through its opposite in one respect and a 
single truth produce numerous shoots and become numerous truths. Since 
these  intermingled  beings  pour  from  this  transitory  realm  into  the  eternal 
realm, surely just as such things as good, pleasure, light, beauty, and belief 
are  poured  into  Paradise;  so  such  harmful  matters  as  evil,  pain,  darkness, 
ugliness,  and  disbelief  ﬂow  into  Hell,  and  the  ﬂoods  of  this  continuously 
agitated  universe  are  emptied  into  those  two  pools.  Referring  you  to  the 
Allusive Points at the end of the wondrous Twenty-Ninth Word, we curtail 
this discussion here.

My fellow students here in this School of Joseph! The easiest way to be 
saved  from  that  dreadful,  everlasting  prison  is  to  proﬁt  from  our  worldly 
prison, and besides being saved from the many sins we are bound to refrain 
from, by repenting for our former sins and performing the obligatory wor-
ship, to make every hour of our prison life here the equivalent of a day’s 
worship.  This  is  the  best  opportunity  we  may  have  to  be  saved  from  that 
eternal prison and to win luminous Paradise. If we miss this opportunity, our 
lives in the hereafter will weep the same as our lives here are weeping, and 
we shall receive the slap of the verse,  ( 22:11 )  | { z

It was the Feast of Sacriﬁces while this station was being written

ّ(cid:195)َا  *  ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ

ّ(cid:195)َا  *  ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ

One ﬁfth of mankind, three hundred million people, together declaring:

and are a sort of echo of the ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ

felt and was certain about.

Then I wondered if the sacred phrase has any connection with our mat-
ter. It suddenly occurred to me that foremost this phrase and many others of 
ّ(cid:195)َا َناَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126) which bear the 
these marks of Islam like ُ
title of “ enduring good works, ” recall particular and universal points about 
the matter we are discussing, and infer its realization.

ّ(cid:195)َا  َ

For  example,  one  aspect  of  the  meaning  of  ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا  ُ

ّ(cid:195)َا  is  that  divine 
power  and  knowledge  are  greater  than  everything;  nothing  at  all  can  quit 
the bounds of Allah’s knowledge, nor escape or be saved from the disposals 
of His power. He is greater than the things we fear most. This means He is 
greater than bringing about the resurrection of the dead, saving us from non-
existence, and bestowing eternal happiness. He is greater than any strange or 
unimaginable thing, so that, as explicitly stated by the verse,

( 31:28 ) â á à ß Þ Ý Ü
the resurrection of humankind is as easy for His power as the creation of a 
single soul. It is in connection with this meaning that when faced by serious 
ّ(cid:195)َا 
ّ(cid:195)َا  *  ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ
disasters or important undertakings, everyone says: ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ
making it a source of consolation, strength, and support for themselves.

As is shown in the Ninth Word, the above phrase and its two fellows, 
ّ(cid:195)ا َناَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126) form the seeds and summaries of

rate the meaning of the prayers, are repeated in the tesbihat following them.

They provide the powerful answers to the questions arising from the won-
derment, pleasure, and awe a person feels at the strange, beautiful, extraor-
dinary things he sees in the universe, which cause him to offer thanks and 
to feel awe at their grandeur. Moreover, at the end of the Sixteenth Word, it 
is described how at the festival a private soldier and a ﬁeld marshal together 
enter the king’s presence, whereas at other times the soldier has contact with 
the  ﬁeld  marshal  only  through  his  commanding  ofﬁcer.  Similarly,  some-
what resembling the saints, a person making the Hajj begins to know Allah 
through His titles of  ِضْرَ
ّبَر . With its repetition, it is again 
ّ(cid:195)َا  that  answers  all  the  feverish  bewildered  questions  that  over-
ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا  ُ
whelm his spirit as the levels of grandeur unfold in his heart. Furthermore, 
ّ(cid:195)َا 
at the end of the Thirteenth Flash, it is described how it is again ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا  ُ
that replies most effectively to Satan’s cunning wiles, cutting them at the 
root, as well as answering succinctly but powerfully our question about the 
hereafter.

The  phrase  ِ

ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا  also  reminds  us  of  resurrection.  It  says  to  us:  “ I 
would have no meaning if there was no hereafter. For I say: to Allah is due 
all the praise and thanks that have been offered from pre-eternity to post-
eternity, whoever they have been offered by and to whom, for the chief of 
all bounties and the only thing that makes bounty true bounty and saves all 
conscious creatures from the endless calamities of non-existence, is eternal 
happiness;  it  is  only  eternal  happiness  that  can  be  equal  to  that  universal 
meaning of mine. ”

Yes, every day all believers declaring at least one hundred and ﬁfty times 
ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا as enjoined by the Shari‘a, 
after the obligatory prayers: ِ
and its being the expression of praise and thanks which extend from pre-
eternity to post-eternity, can only be the advance price and immediate fee 
for Paradise and eternal happiness. They offer thanks since bounties are not 
restricted  to  the  ﬂeeting  bounties  of  this  world,  which  are  tainted  by  the 
pains of transience, and see them as the means to eternal bounties.

and deception, and all faults opposed to His perfection, beauty, and glory, 
it  recalls  eternal  happiness  and  the  realm  of  the  hereafter  and  Paradise 
within it, which are the means to His glory and beauty and the majesty and

perfection of His sovereignty; the phrase alludes to them and indicates them. 
For, as has been proved previously, if there were no eternal happiness, both 
His  sovereignty,  and  His  perfection,  glory,  beauty,  and  mercy  would  be 
stained by fault and defect.

Like these three sacred phrases, ِ

َ(cid:202) and other blessed 
phrases are all seeds of the pillars of faith. Like the meat essences and sugar 
concentrates that have been discovered recently, they are summaries of both 
the pillars of belief and the truths of the Qur’an. The three mentioned above 
are  both  the  seeds  of  the  ﬁve  daily  prayers,  and  they  are  the  seeds  of  the 
Qur’an,  sparkling  like  brilliants  at  the  beginning  of  a  number  of  shining 
suras. So too are they the true sources and bases of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , many 
of whose inspirations ﬁrst came while I was reciting the t e s b i h a t  following 
the prayers; they are the seeds of its truths. In respect of the sainthood and 
worship of Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), these phrases 
are  the  invocations  of  the  Muhammadan  ( UWBP )  way  which,  following 
each  of  the  ﬁve  daily  prayers,  more  than  one  hundred  million  believers 
repeat together in a vast circle of remembrance. Their beads in their hands, 
ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا  thirty-three  times,  and

they  declare  ِ
ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا  ُ

ّ(cid:195)َا thirty-three times.

You have surely understood now the great value of reciting thirty-three 
times after the ﬁve daily prayers, in such a splendid circle for the remem-
brance  of  Allah,  each  of  those  three  blessed  phrases,  which  as  explained 
above, are the summaries and seeds of both the Qur’an, and belief, and the 
prayers. You have understood too the great reward they yield.

[ The  First  Topic  at  the  beginning  of  this  treatise  forms  an  excellent 
lesson about the obligatory ﬁve daily prayers. Then, although I did not 
think of it, involuntarily the end here became an important lesson about 
the t e s b i h a t  following the prayers. ]

point about this comprehensive, elevated and sublime verse. It was like this: 
it occurred to my spirit: why does someone who denies a part of the truths of 
belief become a disbeliever? And why cannot a person who does not accept 
a part of them be a Muslim? Surely belief in Allah and the hereafter dispels 
the darkness like the sun. Also, why does a person who denies one of the pil-
lars and truths of belief become an apostate, falling into disbelief, and by not 
accepting it, quit Islam? Whereas if he believes in the other pillars of belief, 
it should save him from absolute disbelief?

T h e   A n s w e r :  Belief is a single truth, which, composed of its six pillars, 
cannot be divided up. It is a universal that cannot be separated into parts. It is 
a whole that cannot be broken up. For each of the pillars of belief proves the 
other pillars with the proofs that prove itself. They are all extremely power-
ful proofs of each other. In which case, an invalid idea that cannot shake all 
the pillars together with all their proofs, cannot in reality negate any one of 
the pillars, or even a single of their truths, and cannot deny them. Under the 
veil of non-acceptance a person might only, by shutting his eyes, commit 
obstinate unbelief; he would by degrees fall into absolute disbelief and lose 
his humanity, and go to Hell, both physically and mentally. In this station 
then, with Allah’s grace, we shall explain this supreme matter in six points 
in the form of brief summaries, just as in T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f  when proving 
the resurrection of the dead, the other pillars of belief’s proofs of resurrec-
tion were propounded in the form of brief summaries.

FIRST POINT

Belief in Allah proves with its own proofs both the other pillars and belief 
in the hereafter, as is shown clearly in the Seventh Topic of T h e   F r u i t s   o f  
B e l i e f . Yes, is it at all possible and can reason accept that a pre-eternal ever-
lasting sovereignty of dominicality, a post-eternal divine rule, which admin-
isters the boundless universe as though it were a palace, a city, or a country; 
and makes it revolve in balanced and ordered fashion; and changes it with 
wisdom; and equips and directs all together particles, planets, ﬂies, and stars 
as though each were a regular army, and continuously drills them within the 
spheres of command and will in a lofty manoeuvre; and employing them in 
duties makes them act, and causes them to roam and travel, and to parade 
worshipfully; – is it at all possible that such an eternal, everlasting, endur-
ing rule would not have an eternal seat, a permanent and everlasting place 
of manifestation; that is, the hereafter? Allah forbid! That means the sover-
eignty of Almighty Allah’s dominicality and – as is described in the Seventh 
Topic – most of His names and the proofs of His necessary existence, require 
the hereafter and testify to it. So see and understand what powerful support 
this pole of belief has, and believe in it as though seeing it!

Also,  just  as  there  could  be  no  belief  in  Allah  without  the  hereafter; 
so  – as  is  explained  with  brief  indications  in  the  Tenth  Word –  is  it  at  all 
possible  and  could  reason  accept  that  Allah,  the  True  Object  of  Worship, 
should create the universe, in order to manifest His Godhead and ﬁtness to 
be worshipped, as an embodied book every page of which expresses a book 
of meanings and every line of which states a page of meanings, and as an 
embodied Qur’an all the creational signs and words and even points and let-
ters of which are miracles, and as a magniﬁcent mosque of His mercy the 
inside of which is decorated with numberless inscriptions and adornments, 
and in every corner of which are species of beings each preoccupied with 
the worship dictated by its nature -is it at all possible He should create it in 
this way and not send masters to teach the meanings of that vast book, and 
commentators to expound the verses of that Qur’an, and not appoint prayer-
leaders to that huge mosque to lead all those worshipping in their myriad 
ways, and that He should not give decrees to those masters, commentators, 
and leaders of worship? Allah forbid, a hundred thousand times!

Also, is it at all possible and could reason accept that the Most Compas-
sionate and Muniﬁcent Maker, Who in order to display to conscious beings 
the beauty of His mercy and the goodness of His compassion and the per-
fection of His dominicality, and in order to encourage them to praise and 

264

THE RAYS

thank Him, creates the universe as a banqueting hall, exhibition, and place 
of excursion in which are displayed inﬁnite varieties of delicious bounties 
and priceless, wondrous arts, is it at all possible that He should not speak 
with those conscious beings at the banquet and not inform them by means 
of envoys of their duties of thanks for the bounties, and their duties of wor-
ship in the face of the manifestations of His mercy and His making Himself 
loved? Allah forbid, a hundred thousand times!

Also, is it at all possible that although the Maker loves His art and wants 
others  to  love  it,  and  as  is  shown  by  His  having  taken  into  account  the 
thousand pleasures of the mouth, wants it to be met with appreciation and 
approval,  and  has  adorned  the  universe  with  priceless  arts  in  a  way  that 
shows  He  wants  through  all  His  arts  both  to  make  Himself  known,  and 
loved, and to display a sort of His transcendent beauty, is it at all possible 
that He should not speak to human beings, the commanders of living beings 
in the universe, through some of the most eminent of them, and send them 
as envoys, and that His ﬁne arts should not be appreciated and the exquisite 
beauty  of  His  names  not  be  valued,  and  His  making  Himself  known  and 
loved be unreciprocated? Allah forbid, a hundred thousand times!

Also,  is  it  at  all  possible  or  reasonable  that  the  All-Knowing  Speaker 
Who answers clearly by act and deed through His inﬁnite bounties and gifts, 
which indicate intention, choice, and will, at exactly the right time, all the 
supplications of living beings for their natural needs, and their desires and 
recourse through the tongue of disposition, that He should speak by deed 
and by state with the most insigniﬁcant living creature and remedy its woes 
and heed its troubles with His bounties, and know its needs and meet them, 
then not meet with the spiritual leaders of men, who are the choicest result 
of  the  universe,  vicegerents  of  the  earth,  and  the  commanders  of  most  of 
the creatures on the earth? Although He speaks with them and with all liv-
ing beings, should He not speak with human beings verbally and send them 
scriptures, books, and decrees? Allah forbid, innumerable times!

That is to say, with its certainty and innumerable proofs, belief in Allah 

proves ِهِ(cid:171) ُ(cid:126)ُرَو ِهِ(cid:93)ُ(cid:99)ﯭﯧِ(cid:92) َو  belief in the prophets and sacred scriptures.

Also, is it at all possible or reasonable that in response to the One Who 
makes Himself known and loved through all His creatures and seeks thanks 
by deed and state, Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) should 
have  known  and  made  known,  loved  and  made  loved  that  Glorious  Art-
ist  through  the  Qur’anic  reality,  which  brings  the  the  universe  to  tumult,

Also, is it at all possible that the universe’s Maker should cause creatures 
to speak with one another in myriad tongues, and that He should listen to 
their speech, and know it, and Himself not speak? Allah forbid!

Also, is it at all reasonable that He should not proclaim through a decree 
the divine purposes in the universe? That He should not send a book like 
the Qur’an which will solve its riddles and provide the true answers to the 
three awesome universally-asked questions: “ Where do they come from? ”, 
“ Where are they going? ”, and “ Why do they follow on caravan after cara-
van, stop by for a while, then pass on? ” Allah forbid!

Also, is it at all possible that the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, which 
has illuminated thirteen centuries; every hour is uttered with complete ven-
eration  by  a  hundred  million  tongues;  is  inscribed  through  its  sacredness 
in the hearts of millions of haﬁzes; in effect governs through its laws the 
majority of the members of humanity and trains, puriﬁes, and instructs their 
souls, spirits, hearts, and minds; and forty aspects of whose miraculousness 
is proved in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and explained in the wondrous Nineteenth Let-
ter,  which  demonstrates  an  aspect  of  its  miraculousness  towards  each  of 
forty classes of humankind, and as one of the thousand miracles of Muham-
mad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) is proved decisively to be the 
true Word of Allah; – is it at all possible that it should not be the word and

That is to say, with all its proofs, belief in Allah proves that the Qur’an 

is the Word of Allah.

Also, is it all possible that the Glorious Monarch Who continuously ﬁlls 
and empties the earth with living beings and inhabits this world of ours with 
conscious creatures in order to make Himself known and worshipped and 
gloriﬁed, should leave the heavens and earth empty and vacant, and not cre-
ate inhabitants suitable to them and settle them in those lofty palaces, that in 
His most extensive lands He should leave the sovereignty of His dominical-
ity  without  servants,  functionaries,  envoys,  and  majesty;  without  lieuten-
ants,  supervisors,  spectators,  worshippers,  and  subjects?  Allah  forbid!  To 
the numbers of the angels, Allah forbid!

Also,  is  it  at  all  possible  that  the  All-Wise  Ruler,  the  All-Knowing 
and Compassionate One, should write the universe in the form of a book; 
inscribe the entire life stories of trees in all their seeds, and write in the seeds 
of grasses and plants all their vital duties, and record precisely the lives of 
conscious beings in their memories, as tiny as mustard seeds, and preserve 
with innumerable photographs all the actions and events in all His domin-
ions and all the eras of His sovereignty, and create mighty Heaven and Hell 
and  the  supreme  scales  of  justice  for  the  manifestation  and  realization  of 
justice, wisdom and mercy, the basis of His dominicality, then not have writ-
ten down the acts of men connected with the universe, nor have their deeds 
recorded so they may meet with reward or punishment, nor write their good 
and  bad  deeds  on  the  tablets  of  divine  determining?  Allah  forbid!  To  the 
number of letters inscribed on them.

That is to say, with its proofs, the truth of belief in Allah proves the truth 
of both belief in the angels, and belief in divine determining. The pillars of 
belief prove each other as clearly as the sun shows the daylight, and daylight 
shows the sun.

Second Point

SECOND POINT

All the teachings and claims of foremost the Qur’an, and all the revealed 
books and scriptures, and foremost Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ), and all the prophets, are based on ﬁve or six points. They have 
continually striven to teach and prove those basic teachings. All the proofs 
and evidences which testify to their messengership and truthfulness look to 
those bases, corroborating their veracity. And those fundamentals are belief 
in Allah and belief in the hereafter and in the other pillars of belief. That is 
to say, it is not possible to separate the six pillars of belief. Each proves all 

THE FRUITS OF BELIEF – NINTH TOPIC

267

of them, and requires them, and necessitates them. The six are a whole, a 
universal, which cannot be broken into parts and whose division is outside 
the bounds of possibility. Like the Tuba tree whose roots are in the heavens, 
each branch, fruit and leaf of that mighty tree relies on its universal, inex-
haustible life. A person unable to deny that powerful life which is as clear 
as the sun, cannot deny the life of a single of its leaves, attached to it. If he 
does deny it, the tree will refute him to the number of its branches, fruits, and 
leaves, and silence him. Belief, with its six pillars, is similar to this.

At  the  beginning  of  this  Station,  I  intended  to  expound  the  six  pillars 
of  belief  in  thirty-six  points,  as  six  Points,  each  with  ﬁve  sub-sections.  I 
also  intended  to  reply  to  and  explain  the  awesome  question  at  the  begin-
ning. But certain unforeseen circumstances did not permit this. I reckoned 
that, the First Point was sufﬁcient, so for the intelligent no need remained 
for further explanation. It was understood perfectly that if a Muslim denies 
one of the pillars of belief, he falls into absolute disbelief. For in the face of 
the summary explanations of other religions, Islam expounds and elucidates 
them completely, and the pillars of belief are bound together. A Muslim who 
does not recognize Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) and 
does not assent to him, will also not recognize Allah, or His attributes, and 
will not know the hereafter. A Muslim’s belief is based on such powerful, 
unshakeable and innumerable proofs that there is no excuse for denial; they 
quite simply compel the reason to accept them.

A Flower of Emirdağ

[ An extremely powerful reply to objections raised against repeti-
tion in the Qur’an. ]

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
Due  to  my  wretched  situation,  this  Topic  is  confused  and  grace-
less. But I knew deﬁnitely that beneath the confused wording was 
a most valuable sort of miraculousness, though unfortunately I was 
incapable of expressing it. But however dull the wording, since it 
concerns the Qur’an, it is both worship in the form of reﬂection, 
and the shell of a sacred, elevated, shining jewel. The diamond in 
the hand should be looked at, not its torn clothes. Also, I wrote it in 
one or two days during Ramadan while extremely ill, wretched, and 
without food, of necessity very concisely and brieﬂy, and including 
many truths and numerous proofs in a single sentence. Its deﬁcien-
cies, then, should be overlooked! 1 

My True and Loyal Brothers! While reading the Qur’an of Miraculous 
Exposition in Ramadan, whichever of the thirty-three verses I came to that 
in  the  First  Ray  describe  the  allusions  to  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  I  saw  that  the 
page and story of the verse also look to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its students to 
a degree – in so far as they have a share of the story. Particularly the Light 
Verse in Sura al-Nur, just as it points to the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  with ten ﬁngers, 
so  the  Darknesses  Verse  following  it  points  directly  at  those  opposing  it; 
these afford a further share. Quite simply, I understood that this station rises 
from particularity to universality and that one part of that universality is the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its students.

Indeed, in regard to the breadth, exaltedness, and comprehensiveness that 
the Qur’an’s address receives from ﬁrstly the extensive station of the univer-
sal dominicality of the Pre-Eternal Speaker, and from the extensive station 

1.  As the Tenth Topic of the Fruits of Denizli Prison, it is a small, shining ﬂower of 
Emirdağ  and  of  this  month  of  Ramadan.  By  explaining  one  instance  of  wisdom  in  the 
repetitions in the Qur’an, it dispels the poisonous, putrid illusions of the people of mis-
guidance.

268

THE FRUITS OF BELIEF – A FLOWER OF EMIRDAG

269

of the one addressed in the name of humankind, indeed of all beings, and 
the most extensive station of all humankind’s guidance in all the centuries, 
and from the station of the elevated comprehensive expositions of the divine 
laws concerning the regulation of this world and the hereafter, the heavens 
and the earth, pre-eternity and post-eternity, and the dominicality of the Cre-
ator of the universe, and of all beings, this Address displays such an elevated 
miraculousness  and  comprehensiveness  that  both  its  apparent  and  simple 
level, which ﬂatters the simple minds of ordinary people, the most numer-
ous group the Qur’an addresses, and its highest level, grants a full share to 
all. But it is as though, in addressing every age and every class of people, 
not with only one share of a story or one moral of a historical tale, but with 
the elements of a universal principle, it is newly revealed. Particularly its 
often repeated threats of  ¸ ... ¸ and its severe expositions of the 
calamities coming from the heavens and the earth, – visited as retribution 
on  the  ‘Ad  and  Thamud  peoples  and  on  Pharaoh  in  punishment  for  their 
wrongdoing – with these it draws attention to the unequalled wrongs of this 
century, and through the salvation of such prophets as Abraham (UWP) and 
Moses (UWP) gives consolation to the oppressed believers.

Indeed, all past time and the departed ages and centuries, which in the 
view of heedlessness and misguidance appear to be a fearsome place of 
non-existence and a grievous, ruined graveyard, the Qur’an of Miraculous 
Exposition presents to every century and class of people as living instruc-
tive pages, strange worlds, living and endowed with spirits, and existent 
realms  of  the  Sustainer  which  are  connected  with  us;  with  an  elevated 
miraculousness,  it  sometimes  conveys  us  to  those  times,  and  sometimes 
brings  those  times  to  us.  Infusing  with  life  the  universe,  which  in  the 
view of misguidance is lifeless, wretched, dead, and a limitless wasteland 
revolving amid separation and decline, with the same miraculousness this 
same  Qur’an  of  Mighty  Stature  raises  to  life  those  dead  beings,  makes 
them converse with one another as ofﬁcials charged with duties and has-
ten to the assistance of one another. Thus showing the universe to a book 
of  the  Eternally  Besought,  a  city  of  the  Most  Merciful,  an  exhibition  of 
dominical workmanship, it instructs mankind, the jinn, and the angels in 
true, luminous, and pleasurable wisdom.

For sure, then, it gains sacred distinctions, such as each of its letters yield-
ing ten merits, and sometimes a hundred, a thousand, or thousands of merits; 
and if all men and jinn were to gather together, their being unable to produce 

270

THE RAYS

the  like  of  it;  and  its  speaking  completely  appropriately  with  all  mankind 
and all beings; and its always being inscribed with eagerness in the hearts 
of millions of h a ﬁ z e s ; and its not causing weariness through its frequent and 
numerous repetitions; and despite its many obscure passages and sentences, 
its being settled perfectly in the delicate, simple heads of children; and its 
being as agreeable as Zamzam water in the ears of the sick, the dying, and 
those distressed by a few words; and its gaining for its students happiness in 
this world and the next.

Its smoothness of style, which, observing exactly its interpreter’s being 
unlettered,  allows  for  no  bombast,  artiﬁciality,  or  affectedness,  and  its 
descending directly from the heavens, demonstrate a ﬁne  miraculousness. 
So too it shows a ﬁne miraculousness in the grace and guidance of ﬂatter-
ing the simple minds of ordinary people, the most numerous of the classes 
of  men,  through  the  condescension  in  its  expression  and  mostly  opening 
the clearest and most evident pages such as the heavens and the earth, and 
teaching the wondrous miracles of power and meaningful lines of wisdom 
beneath those commonplace things.

It  makes  known  too  that  it  is  also  a  book  of  prayer  and  summons,  of 
invocation  and  divine  unity,  which  require  repetition.  For  it  demonstrates 
a sort of miraculousness by making understood in a single sentence and a 
single story through its agreeable repetitions, numerous different meanings 
to numerous different classes of people. Similarly, it demonstrates a sort of 
miraculousness  by  making  known  that  minor,  unimportant  things  in  ordi-
nary, commonplace events are within its compassionate view and the sphere 
of its will and regulation. For it attaches importance to even minor events 
involving the Companions of the Prophet (UWBP) when Islam was being 
established and the Shari‘a was being codiﬁed, showing those minor events 
to be general and universal principles which would produce most important 
fruits, as though they were seeds.

With regard to repetition being necessary due to the repetition of need, 
the repetition of certain verses is not a fault, for as the answers to numerous 
repeated questions over a period of twenty years, they instruct numerous dif-
ferent levels of people. Indeed, it is most powerful miraculousness and most 
elevated eloquence to repeat sentences so powerful they produce thousands 
of results and verses resulting from countless evidences. For they describe 
an inﬁnite, awesome, all-embracing revolution that by destroying utterly the 
vast universe and transforming it at Doomsday, will remove this world and 
found  the  mighty  hereafter  in  its  place,  and  will  prove  that  all  particulars 

THE FRUITS OF BELIEF – A FLOWER OF EMIRDAG

271

and universals from atoms to the stars are in the hand and under the disposal 
of a single Being, and will show the divine wrath and dominical anger – on 
account of the result of the universe’s creation – at mankind’s wrongdoing, 
which brings to anger the earth and the heavens and the elements. Such rep-
etition demonstrates an eloquence and lucid style corresponding exactly to 
the requirements of the subject.

For example, as is explained in the Fourteenth Flash of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , 

the sentence,

(cid:2)(cid:3)
which forms a single verse and is repeated one hundred and fourteen times 
in the Qur’an, is a truth that binds the divine throne and the earth, and illu-
minates the cosmos, and of which everyone is in need all the time; if it is 
repeated millions of times, there is still need for it. One needs and longs for 
it not only every day like bread, but every moment like air and light.

And, for example, the verse,

j i h g f
This verse, which recounts the salvation stories of the prophets and the pun-
ishments of their peoples, is repeated eight times in Sura   ٓمٓ(cid:127)ٰ(cid:142) To repeat 
them on account of the result of the universe’s creation and in the name of 
universal dominicality, in order to teach that dominical dignity requires the 
torments of those wrongdoing peoples while divine compassion requires the 
prophets’  salvation,  is  a  concise,  miraculous,  and  elevated  eloquence,  for 
which, if repeated thousands of times, there would still be need and longing.

And, for example, the verse,

which is repeated in Sura al-Rahman, and the verse,

} | { z

º ¹ ¸
in Sura al-Mursalat shout out threateningly to mankind and the jinn across 
the centuries and the heavens and the earth, the unbelief, ingratitude, and 
wrongdoing of those who bring the universe and the heavens and earth to 
anger, spoil the results of the world’s creation, and deny and respond slight-
ingly to the majesty of divine rule, and aggress against the rights of all crea-
tures. If a general lesson thus concerned with thousands of truths and of the 

272

THE RAYS

strength of thousands of matters is repeated thousands of times, there would 
still be need for it and its awe-inspiring conciseness and beautiful, miracu-
lous eloquence.

And, for example, the repetition a hundred times of the phrases,
َكَ(cid:178)اَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126)
ِ(cid:171)َ(cid:114) ُناَ(cid:174)َ

َ(cid:202) اَ(cid:192) 

 ِراـَ

in the supplication of the Prophet ( UWBP ) called J a u s h a n   a l - K a b i r , which 
is  a  true  and  authentic  supplication  of  the  Qur’an  and  a  sort  of  summary 
proceeding  from  it.  These  phrases  contain  the  greatest  truth  and  the  most 
important of the three supreme duties of creatures in the face of divine unity: 
the gloriﬁcation and praise of Allah and the declaration of His all-holiness, 
and the most awesome question facing humankind, to be saved from eternal 
misery, and worship, the most necessary result of human impotence. It is 
still few, therefore, if they are repeated thousands of times.

Repetition in the Qur’an looks to principles like these. Sometimes on one 
page, even, with regard to the requirements of the position and the need for 
explanation and the demands of eloquence, it expresses the truth of divine 
unity  perhaps  twenty  times  explicitly  and  by  implication.  This  does  not 
cause  boredom,  but  imparts  a  power  and  agreeableness  to  it  and  inspires 
eagerness. In the R i s a l e - i   N u r  it is explained with proofs how appropriate, 
ﬁtting, and acceptable from the point of view of rhetoric the repetitions are 
in the Qur’an. 

The reason for the Meccan and Medinan suras in the Qur’an of Miracu-
lous Exposition being different in regard to eloquence, miraculousness, and 
detail and brevity, and its wisdom and purport, is as follows:

In Mecca, the ﬁrst line of those it was addressing, who were also opposed 
to  it,  were  the  Qurayshi  idolators  and  untaught  tribesmen,  so  a  powerful 
and  elevated  rhetorical  style  was  necessary,  and  a  succinct,  convincing, 
persuasive conciseness, and repetition, were required in order to establish 
it. Therefore, in most of the Meccan suras, it repeated and propounded the 
pillars of belief and degrees in the afﬁrmation of divine unity with power-
ful, elevated, and miraculous conciseness. It proved so powerfully the ﬁrst 
creation and the resurrection, and Allah and the hereafter, not only in a sin-
gle page, verse, sentence or word, but sometimes in a letter, through such 
devices as inverting the words or sentences, making a word indeﬁnite, and 
omissions  and  inclusions,  that  the  geniuses  and  leaders  of  the  science  of 
rhetoric met it with wonder. The R i s a l e - i   N u r , and the Twenty-Fifth Word 
and its Addenda in particular, which prove in summary forty aspects of the

273

Qur’an’s  miraculousness,  and  the  Qur’anic  commentary,  I s h ā r ā t   a l - I ‘ j ā z  
from the Arabic R i s a l e - i   N u r , which in wondrous fashion proves the aspect 
of  the  Qur’an’s  miraculous  inimitability  in  its  ordering  and  composition, 
have  demonstrated  in  fact  that  the  Meccan  suras  and  verses  comprise  the 
highest styles of eloquence and the most elevated, concise miraculousness.

As  for  the  Medinan  suras  and  verses,  since  the  ﬁrst  line  of  those  they 
were addressing, who opposed them were the People of the Book, such as 
the  Jews and Christians who afﬁrmed Allah’s existence, what was required 
by eloquence and guidance and for the discussion to correspond to the situ-
ation, was not explanation of the high principles of religion and pillars of 
belief in a simple, clear, and detailed style, but the explanation of particular 
matters of the Shari‘a and its injunctions which were the cause of dispute, 
and  the  origins  and  causes  of  secondary  matters  and  general  laws.  Thus, 
in the Medinan suras and verses, through explanations in a detailed, clear, 
simple style, in the matchless manner of exposition peculiar to the Qur’an, 
it  mostly  mentions  within  those  particular  secondary  matters,  a  powerful 
and elevated summary; a conclusion and proof, a sentence relating to divine 
unity or the divine names, belief, or the hereafter which makes the particu-
lar  matter  of  the  Shari‘a  universal  and  ensures  that  it  conforms  to  belief 
in  Allah.  It  illuminates  the  passage  and  elevates  and  universalizes  it.  The 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  has proved the qualities and ﬁne points and elevated eloquence 
in the summaries and conclusions, which express divine unity and the here-
after, and come mostly at the end of such verses as:

  ( 29:62 )   R Q P O N    ( 2:20 )   j i h g f e
( 30:5 )  Ä Ã Â   ( 30:27 )  z y x
When elucidating in the Second Beam of the Second Light of the Twenty-
Fifth Word, ten out of the many ﬁne points of those summaries and conclu-
sions, it has proved to the obstinate that they contain a supreme miracle.

Yes,  in  expounding  those  secondary  matters  of  the  Shari‘a  and  laws 
of  social  life,  the  Qur’an  at  once  raises  the  views  of  those  it  addresses 
to elevated and universal points, and transforming a simple style into an 
elevated one and instruction in the Shari‘a to instruction in divine unity, 
it shows it is both a book of law and commands and wisdom, and a book of 
the tenets of faith and belief, and of invocation and reﬂection, supplication 
and summons. And by teaching many of the aims of Qur’anic guidance in 
every passage, it displays a brilliant and miraculous eloquence different to 
that of the Meccan suras.

of this sort, transforms that simple and unlettered level and particular discus-
sion which takes into account the minds of ordinary people, into an elevated, 
attractive, and general conversation for the purpose of guidance.

A Question

A   Q u e s t i o n :  “ Sometimes an important truth is not apparent to a super-
ﬁcial  view,  and  in  some  positions  the  connection  is  not  known  when  an 
elevated summary concerning divine unity or a universal principle is drawn 
from a minor and ordinary matter, and it is imagined to be a fault. For exam-
ple, to mention the extremely elevated principle:

( 12:76 ) ª © ¨ § ¦
when Joseph ( Upon whom be peace ) seized his brother through subterfuge, 
does not appear to be in keeping with eloquence. What is its meaning and 
purpose? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :   In  most  of  the  long  and  middle-length  suras,  which  are 
each small Qur’ans, and in many pages and passages, not only two or three 
aims are followed, for by its nature the Qur’an comprises many books and 
teachings, such as being a book of invocation, belief, and reﬂection, and a 
book  of  law,  wisdom,  and  guidance.  Thus,  since  it  describes  the  majestic 
manifestations of divine dominicality and its encompassing all things, as a 
sort of recitation of the mighty book of the universe, it follows many aims 
in  every  discussion  and  sometimes  on  a  single  page;  while  instructing  in 
knowledge  of  Allah,  the  degrees  in  divine  unity,  and  the  truths  of  belief, 
with an apparently weak connection it opens another subject of instruction 

THE FRUITS OF BELIEF – A FLOWER OF EMIRDAG

275

in the following passage, joining powerful connections to the weak one. It 
corresponds perfectly to the discussion and raises the level of eloquence.

A Second Question

A   S e c o n d   Q u e s t i o n :   “ What  is  the  purpose  of  the  Qur’an  proving  and 
drawing attention to the hereafter, divine unity, and man’s reward and pun-
ishment thousands of times, explicitly, implicitly, and allusively, and teach-
ing them in every sura, on every page, and in every discussion? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  To instruct in the most important, most signiﬁcant, and 
most  awesome  matters  in  the  sphere  of  contingency  and  in  the  revolu-
tions in the universe’s history concerning man’s duty and the means to his 
eternal misery or happiness – man who undertook the divine vicegerency 
of the earth – and to remove his countless doubts and to smash his violent 
denials and obduracy, indeed, to make man conﬁrm those awesome revo-
lutions and submit to those most necessary essential matters which are as 
great  as  the  revolutions,  if  the  Qur’an  draws  his  attention  to  them  thou-
sands, or even millions of times, it is not excessive, for those discussions 
in the Qur’an are read millions of times, and they do not cause boredom, 
nor does the need cease.

For example, the verses,

( 85:11 )  ...    n m l k j i h g f e d

( 5:119 ) اًدـَ(cid:92)َا آ

َ(cid:183)ـ(cid:193)ِ(cid:158)  َن(cid:192) ِدِ(cid:170)اَ(cid:114)

These verses show the truth of the good news of eternal happiness, which 
“saves  from  the  eternal  execution  of  the  reality  of  death,  which  every 
moment shows itself to wretched man, both himself, and his world, and all 
those he loves, and gains for them an everlasting sovereignty,” so if they 
were to be repeated thousands of millions of times and given the importance 
of the universe, it still would not be excessive and would not diminish their 
value.  Thus,  in  teaching  the  innumerable,  invaluable  matters  of  this  sort, 
and  endeavouring  to  persuade,  convince,  and  prove  the  occurrence  of  the 
awesome  revolutions  which  will  destroy  the  universe’s  present  form  and 
transform it as though it were a house, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposi-
tion certainly draws attention to these matters thousands of times explicitly, 
implicitly,  and  allusively,  and  this  is  not  excessive.  Indeed,  it  renews  the 
bounty which is an essential need, just as the essential needs of bread, medi-
cine, air, and light are renewed.

And, for example, as is proved decisively in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , the Qur’an 

repeats severely, angrily, and forcefully, such threatening verses as,

The wisdom in this is that man’s unbelief is such a transgression against the 
rights of the universe and most creatures that it angers the heavens and earth 
and brings the elements to anger so that they deal blows on those wrongdo-
ers with tempest and storm. According to the clear statement of the verses,

Hell  so  rages  at  those  iniquitous  deniers  that  it  almost  disintegrates  with 
fury. Thus, in accordance with the wisdom of showing, not from the point 
of view of man’s smallness and insigniﬁcance before such a general crime 
and boundless aggression, but the importance of the rights of the Monarch 
of  Universe’s  subjects  before  the  gravity  of  the  wrongful  crime  and  the 
awesomeness of the unjust aggression, and the boundless ugliness of those 
deniers’ unbelief and iniquity – in accordance with the wisdom of showing 
this,  if  repeating  in  His  decree  wrathfully  and  severely,  the  crime  and  its 
punishment,  thousands,  millions,  or  even  thousands  of  millions  of  times, 
it  still  would  not  be  excessive  and  a  fault,  because  for  a  thousand  years 
thousands of millions of people have read these verses every day, not with 
boredom, but with complete eagerness and need.

Indeed, every day, all the time, for everyone one world disappears and

sitory worlds, the Qur’an makes ُ
veils. In the same way, for the purpose of reading the Qur’an and recalling 
the penalties of those crimes and the Pre-Eternal Monarch’s severe threats 
to smash their obduracy, and of working to be saved from the rebellion of 
the soul so as not to obscure in darkness those multiple, ﬂeeting veils and 
renewed  travelling  universes,  nor  uglify  their  images  which  are  reﬂected 
in the mirrors of their lives, and not to turn against them those guest views 
which may testify in favour of them, the Qur’an repeats them in most mean-
ingful fashion. Even Satan would shudder at imagining to be out of place 
these powerful, severe, and repeated threats of the Qur’an. They show the 
torments of Hell to be pure justice for those deniers who do not heed them.

And, for example, in repeating many times the stories of Moses ( Upon 
whom  be  peace ),  which  contain  many  instances  of  wisdom  and  beneﬁts, 
such  as  those  of  the  staff  of  Moses,  and  the  stories  of  the  other  prophets 
( Upon whom be peace ), the Qur’an demonstrates that the prophethoods of 
all the other prophets are a proof of the veracity of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) 
prophethood and that anyone who does not deny all of them cannot in truth 
deny  his  messengership.  For  this  purpose,  and  since  everyone  does  not 
always have the time or capability to read the whole Qur’an, it repeats those 
stories similarly to the main pillars of belief, in this way making each of the 
long and middle-length suras like a small Qur’an. To repeat them, then, is 
not excessive; it is required by eloquence, and teaches that the question of 
Muhammad  (UWBP)  is  the  greatest  question  of  humankind  and  the  most 
important matter of the universe.

It has been demonstrated decisively in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  with many proofs 
and indications that by affording the highest position to the person of Muham-
mad (UWBP) in the Qur’an and including him in four pillars of belief and

ّ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:111)َ(cid:174) equal to the pillar of ُ

َ(cid:202) that Muhammad’s 
holding  ِ
(UWBP) messengership is the foremost truth in the universe, and that the 
Person of Muhammad (UWBP) is the most noble of creatures, and his uni-
versal collective personality and sacred rank, known as the Muhammadan 
Truth,  is  the  most  radiant  Sun  of  the  two  worlds.  His  worthiness  for  this 
extraordinary  position  has  also  been  proved.  One  of  these  thousands  of 
proofs is this:

According to the principle of  ِلِ(cid:150)اَ(cid:159)ْ(cid:170)اﯬﯦ  ُبَ(cid:93) َ

ّ(cid:127)(cid:170)َا with the equivalent of all 
the good works performed by all his (UWBP) community at all times enter-
ing his book of good works; and the light which he brought illuminating all 
the truths of the cosmos; and his gratifying not only the jinn, humankind, the 
angels, and animate beings, but also the universe and the heavens and earth; 
and the supplications of plants, offered through the tongue of disposition, 
and the supplications of animals offered through the tongue of their innate 
need,  and  the  righteous  of  his  (UWBP)  community  every  day  bequeating 
to  him  their  benedictions  and  supplications  for  mercy  and  spiritual  gains, 
whose millions – and together with spirit beings, even, millions of millions 
–  of  unrejectable  supplications  are  accepted,  as  we  actually  witness  with 
our eyes; and since each of the three hundred thousand letters of the Qur’an 
yield  from  ten  to  a  hundred  or  a  thousand  merits  and  fruits,  with  inﬁnite 
numbers  of  lights  entering  the  book  of  his  deeds,  only  with  regard  to  the

recitation of the Qur’an by all his community, the One All-Knowing of the 
Unseen saw and knew that the Muhammadan (UWBP) Reality, which is his 
collective personality, would in the future be a Tuba tree of Paradise. It was 
in accordance with that position that He gave him such supreme importance 
in the Qur’an, and in His Decree showed the following of him and receiv-
ing of his intercession through adhering to his Illustrious Sunna to be one of 
the most important matters concerning man. And from time to time the One 
All-Knowing of the Unseen took into consideration his human personality 
and human state in his early life, which was a seed of the majestic  Tuba tree.
Thus, since the truths repeated in the Qur’an are thus valuable, all sound 
natures  will  testify  that  its  repetitions  comprise  a  powerful  and  extensive 
miracle. Unless, that is to say, a person is afﬂicted with some sickness of the 
heart and malady of the conscience due to the plague of materialism, and is

Two Additions, which form a Conclusion
to the Tenth Topic

Two Additions, Which Form a Conclusion To The Tenth Topic

THE FIRST: Twelve years ago I heard that a fearsome, obdurate atheist 
had instigated a conspiracy against the Qur’an, which was to have it trans-
lated. He said: “The Qur’an should be translated so that everyone can know 
just what it is.” That is, he hatched a dire plan with the idea that everyone 
would  see  its  unnecessary  repetitions  and  its  translation  would  be  read  in 
its place. However, the irrefutable proofs of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  proved deci-
sively that “A true translation of the Qur’an is not possible, and other lan-
guages cannot preserve the Qur’an’s qualities and ﬁne points in place of the 
grammatical language of Arabic. Man’s trite and partial translations cannot 
be substituted for the miraculous and comprehensive words of the Qur’an, 
every  letter  of  which  yields  from  ten  to  a  thousand  merits;  they  may  not 
be read in its place in mosques.” Then the R i s a l e - i   N u r  spread everywhere 
and confounded that fearsome plan. I surmise that it was due to the idiotic 
and lunatic attempts of dissemblers to extinguish the sun of the Qur’an on 
account of Satan by pufﬁng at it like silly children having taken lessons from 
that atheist, that I was inspired to write this Tenth Matter while under great

constraint and in a most distressing situation. But I do not know the reality 
of the situation since I have been unable to meet with anyone.

SECOND ADDITION: After our release from Denizli Prison, I was stay-
ing on the top ﬂoor of the famous Şehir Hotel. The subtle, graceful dancing 
of the leaves, branches, and trunks of the many poplar trees in the ﬁne gar-
dens opposite me at the touching of the breeze, each with a rapturous and 
ecstatic  motion  like  a  circle  of  dervishes,  pained  my  heart,  sorrowful  and 
melancholy  at  being  parted  from  my  brothers  and  remaining  alone.  Sud-
denly the seasons of autumn and winter came to mind and a heedlessness 
overcame me. I so pitied those graceful poplars and living creatures swaying 
with perfect joyousness that my eyes ﬁlled with tears. With this reminder of 
the separations and non-being beneath the ornamented veil of the universe, 
the grief at a world-full of deaths and separations pressed down on me. Then 
suddenly, the Light the Muhammadan ( UWBP ) Truth brought came to my 
assistance and transformed that endless grief and sorrow into joy. Indeed, 
I am eternally grateful to the Muhammadan Being ( UWBP ) for the assist-
ance and consolation which alleviated my situation at that time, only a single 
instance of the boundless effulgence of that Light for me, like for all believ-
ers and everyone. It was like this:

By showing those blessed and delicate creatures to be without function 
or purpose, and their motion to be not out of joy, but as though trembling 
on the brink of non-existence and separation and tumbling into nothingness, 
that heedless view so touched the feelings in me of desire for permanence, 
love  of  good  things,  and  compassion  for  fellow-creatures  and  life  that  it 
transformed the world into a sort of hell and my mind into an instrument 
of torture. Then, just at that point, the Light Muhammad ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ) had brought as a gift for humankind  raised the veil; 
it showed in place of extinction, non-being, nothingness, purposeless, futil-
ity,  transience  and  separations,  meanings  and  instances  of  wisdom  to  the 
number of the leaves of the poplars, and as is proved in the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
results and duties which may be divided into three sorts:

The First Sort

The First Sort looks to the All-Glorious Maker’s names. For example, 
if a master craftsman makes a wondrous machine, everyone applauds him, 
saying: “ What wonders Allah has willed! Blessed be Allah! ” Similarly, the 
machine congratulates the craftsman through the tongue of its disposition, 
through displaying perfectly the results intended from it. All living beings 
and all things are such machines; they applaud their Craftsman through their 
gloriﬁcations.

The Second Sort

280

THE RAYS

The Second Sort of the Instances of Wisdom looks to the views of liv-
ing creatures and conscious beings. Beings each become an agreeable object 
of study, a book of knowledge. They leave their meanings in the sphere of 
existence in the minds of conscious beings and their forms in their memo-
ries, and on the tablets in the World of Similitudes, and in the notebooks 
of the World of the Unseen, then they depart from the Manifest World and 
withdraw to the World of the Unseen. That is, they leave behind an appar-
ent existence, but gain many existences pertaining to meaning, the Unseen, 
and  knowledge.  Yes,  since  Allah  exists  and  His  knowledge  encompasses 
everything, in the view of reality, in the world of believers there is surely no 
non-being,  extinction,  nothingness,  annihilation,  and  transitoriness,  while 
the  world  of  unbelievers  is  full  of  non-existence,  separation,  nothingness, 
and  transience.  This  is  taught  by  the  saying,  which  is  on  everyone’s  lips, 
“ For those for whom Allah exists, everything exists; and for those for whom 
He does not exist, nothing exists; for them there is nothing. ”

I n   S h o r t :  Just as belief saves man from eternal annihilation at the time 
of death, so it saves everyone’s private world from the darknesses of anni-
hilation and nothingness. Whereas unbelief, and especially if it is absolute 
unbelief, both sends man and his private world to non-existence with death, 
and casts him into infernal darknesses. It transforms the pleasures of life into 
bitter poisons. Let the ears ring of those who prefer the life of this world to 
that of the hereafter! Let them come and ﬁnd a solution for this, or else let 
them embrace belief and be saved from these dreadful losses!

A Letter From Husrev

A Letter From Husrev1 to Üstad Bediuzzaman Said Nursi
Concerning the Tenth Topic

My Dear and Esteemed Master,
Endless thanks be to Almighty Allah that we have received A Flower of 
Emirdağ, the Tenth Topic of the Fruits of Denizli, which has ameliorated our 
grief at our two months’ separation and our distress at having been unable 
to communicate, and enumerates the virtues of the repetition of the Qur’an’s 
glorious, august, merciful and compassionate verses, which infuse our hearts 
with fresh life and breathe into our spirits a fresh breeze, and explains the 
necessity, signiﬁcance, and reason for the repetitions, and is too a brilliant 
defence of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . In truth, the more we receive the scent of this 
ﬂower, so deserving of praise and appreciation, the yearning of our spirits 
for it increased. Just as how in the face of the difﬁculties of our nine months’ 
imprisonment, the nine Topics of T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f  showed their beauty 
by contributing to our being released, so through pointing out the wonders 
of the concise miraculousness of the Qur’an, the Tenth Topic, their Flower, 
again exhibited their beauty.

Yes,  my  beloved  Master,  like  the  superb,  delicate  beauty  of  the  rose 
makes the beholder forget the thorns on its stem, so this luminous Flower 
has made us forget the distress of those nine months; it has made it as noth-
ing. The manner of its writing does not cloy those studying it; it astounds 
the mind. Of the many beauties it contains, by showing fully the value of the 
repetitions in the face of the treachery of simplifying the Qur’an in people’s 
eyes by translating it, it has set forth its universal loftiness. The Qur’an of 
Miraculous Exposition being proved to be as fresh as though it was newly 
revealed, its followers adhering strongly to it every century and their perfect 
obedience to its commands and prohibitions; and its severe, awesome, and 
repeated  threats  to  the  oppressor  in  every  century,  and  its  compassionate 
and merciful regard for the oppressed; and among its threats which look to 
this century, the tyrants being made to cry out continuously for the last six 
or seven years at the heavenly hell which recalls a sample of deepest space;

also wrote copies of the Qur’an showing the coincidences (t e v â f u k â t ) of the word Allāh, 
an  aspect  of  its  miraculousness  which  Bediuzzaman  discovered.  He  was  together  with

and the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students being at the head of the oppressed this century; 
and their being delivered from their plights, personal and general, truly like 
the prophets of old found deliverance; and its pointing out the blows dealt 
to the irreligious, its opponents, and Hellish torments; and the Flower being 
concluded with two ﬁne and subtle addenda; all these prompted this want-
ing  student  of  yours,  Husrev,  to  joyfully  offer  endless  thanks.  As  I  have 
mentioned to my dear Master, I have never experienced in my life the joy 
and  happiness  this  beautiful  Flower  gives  me,  as  I  have  told  my  brothers 
on numerous occasions. Almighty Allah placed on their feeble shoulders a 
great and heavy load. May Allah be pleased with our beloved Master, and 
may He make them smile eternally by lightening their load. Amen!

Yes, my dear Master! We are forever pleased at Allah, the Qur’an, His 
Beloved, the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and at you, our beloved Master, who is herald of 
the Qur’an. We in no way regret our following you. We harbour absolutely 
no intention in our hearts to do harm; we seek only Allah and His pleasure. 
As time passes, we increase our longing to meet Allah within the bounds 
of His pleasure. To refer to Almighty Allah without exception those who 
have done us evil and to forgive them, and to do good to everyone includ-
ing those tyrants is a mark of Islam established in the hearts of the R i s a l e - i

[ Hundreds  of  the  innumerable  fruits,  particular  and  universal,  of  the 
sacred tree of belief, one of which is Paradise, another, eternal happi-
ness, and another, the vision of Allah, have been set forth with proofs 
and explanations in the R i s a l e - i   N u r . Referring further explanation of 
them to  S i r a c ü ’ n - N u r   (   T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p   ) , therefore, here shall 
be set out a few examples of its particular and special fruits, rather than 
its universal pillars. ]

One  of  these:  One  day  while  reciting  in  a  supplication:  “ O  My  Sus-
tainer! In veneration of Gabriel, Michael, Israﬁl, and Azra’il, and through 
their intercession, preserve me from the evil of men and jinn, ” I experienced 
an  exceedingly  pleasant  and  consoling  state  of  mind  on  mentioning  the 
name of Azra’il, which generally makes people tremble in fear. “ All praise 
be to Allah! ” I exlaimed and began to feel earnest love for him. I shall point 
out extremely brieﬂy only one particular fruit of the many of this particular 
aspect of the pillar of belief in the angels.

Another: Everyone’s most precious possession and the one over which 
they most tremble, is their spirit. I felt sure that to surrender it to a strong 
and trustworthy hand thereby preserving it from being lost and annihilated 
and from aimlessness, afforded a profound joy. Then the angels who record 
human actions came to mind; I saw that they yielded numerous sweet fruits 
like the previous one.

Another: Everyone tries earnestly to preserve through writing, poetry, 
or even the cinema, a worthwhile saying or deed, in order to immortalize 
it. Particularly if the deeds produce everlasting fruits in Paradise, they are 
even more anxious to preserve them. The recording angels hovering over 
people’s shoulders so that they may show their deeds in eternal vistas and 
continually gain their performers reward, seemed so agreeable to me, I can-
not describe it.

Then, when the worldly had isolated me from all aspects of social life 
and kept me from all my books, friends, assistants, and the things that con-
sole me, and I was being crushed by the desolation of exile and my empty 
world was tumbling down all around me, one of the many fruits of belief in

the angels came to my assistance. It cheered up the universe and my world, 
ﬁlling it with angels and spirit beings, and making my world laugh for joy. 1 
It showed too that the worlds of the people of misguidance weep in desola-
tion, emptiness, and darkness. While enjoying the pleasures of this fruit, my 
imagination  plucked  one  of  the  numerous  fruits  of  belief  in  the  prophets, 
which resembles it, and tasted it. Then suddenly my belief that all the proph-
ets of the past were as though living, and my assent to them, lit up those 
times and made my belief universal and expanded it, and set thousands of 
signatures to their teachings concerning belief in the Prophet of the End of 
Time ( UWBP ), silencing the Satans.

Then, a question occurred to me the decisive answer to which is included 
in the Thirteenth Flash, about the wisdom in seeking refuge with Allah from 
Satan. In meaning it asked me: “ The people of guidance are assisted and 
strengthened  by  innumerable  sweet  fruits  and  beneﬁts  like  these,  the  ﬁne 
results  of  good  deeds,  and  the  Most  Merciful  of  the  Merciful’s  compas-
sionate succour and assistance, so why are they frequently defeated by the 
people  of  misguidance,  and  sometimes  twenty  or  a  hundred  of  them  are 
routed? ” While pondering over this, I recalled the mobilizations and angels 
in  the  Qur’an  in  the  face  of  Satan’s  feeble  machinations,  and  Almighty 
Allah’s sending assistance to the people of belief. Since the R i s a l e - i   N u r  has 
explained the purpose and wisdom of this with decisive proofs, we shall here 
allude to it only brieﬂy.

Yes, sometimes in the face of a single vandal trying to set ﬁre to a pal-
ace which a hundred men have made, the palace can remain standing only 
through a hundred men protecting it and by having recourse to the govern-
ment and the king. For its existence is possible only through the existence 
of all its conditions and causes, but its non-existence and destruction may 
occur through the non-existence of a single condition. Just as the palace may 
be burnt to the ground by a layabout with a single match, so with some small 
actions, satans from among jinn and men cause vast destruction and terrible 
non-physical conﬂagrations. Yes, the basis and origin of all bad, evils and 
sins  is  non-existence,  it  is  destruction.  The  non-existence  and  destruction 
are concealed beneath apparent existence. Thus, relying on this point, satans 
from among jinn and men and evil beings withstand an inﬁnite force with 
an extremely weak force, driving the people of truth and reality to continu-
ally seek refuge at the divine court, and to ﬂee to it. The Qur’an therefore

mobilizes great forces for their protection. It gives for their use ninety-nine 
divine names, and commands them sternly to withstand those enemies.

From this answer became apparent the tip of a vast truth and basis of an 
awesome matter. It was like this: just as Paradise bears the crops of all the 
worlds of existence and produces the eternal shoots of the seeds grown in 
this world; so in order to display the grievous consequences of the innumer-
able terrible worlds of non-existence and nothingness, Hell scorches up the 
products of that non-existence, and among its other functions, that terrible 
factory cleanses the universe of existence of the ﬁlth of the world of non-
existence. For now we shall not open the door of this awesome matter; Allah 
willing, it will be elucidated later.

Another particular and example of the fruit of belief in the angels con-
cerns the questioning angels, Munkar and Nakir; 1 it is this: in my imagina-
tion I entered my grave, telling myself: “ I am bound to enter here, the same 
as everyone else. ” While taking fright at the bleakness and despair of the 
lonely,  dark,  cold,  narrow  solitary  conﬁnement  of  the  grave,  two  blessed 
friends resembling Munkar and Nakir appeared. They began to debate with 
me. My heart and grave were broadened, illumined, and warmed; windows 
were opened up onto the world of spirits. I felt truly happy at that situation 
which I saw in the imagination then, and will see in reality in the future, and 
I offered thanks.

A m e d r e s e  student who was studying Arabic grammar died and in reply-
ing to Munkar and Nakir’s question of “ Who is your Sustainer? ”, thought 
he was in his own m e d r e s e  and said: “ ‘Who’ is the subject, ‘your Sustainer’ 
is its predicate; ask me something difﬁcult; that’s easy. ” It made both the 
angels, and the spirits who were present, and a diviner of graves who wit-
nessed the incident, laugh, and brought a smile to divine mercy. Being deliv-
ered from torment, the late Hafız Ali, a martyr hero of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , died 
in prison while writing out and enthusiastically studying the treatise of The 
Fruits of Belief. Just as he replied in the grave to the questioning angels with 
the truths of T h e  F r u i t s  o f  B e l i e f  – as he had in court here, so I and the R i s a l e -
i   N u r  students shall reply to those questions with the brilliant and powerful 
proofs  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  in  the  future  in  fact  and  now  in  meaning,  and 
will cause the angels to conﬁrm them and appreciate them and congratulate 
them; Allah willing.

THE RAYS

Another  small  example  of  belief  in  the  angels  leading  to  worldly  hap-
piness  is  this:  an  innocent  child  who  had  learnt  his  lesson  from  the  I l m - i  
H a l , said to another child who was wailing at the death of his little brother: 
“ Don’t cry, be thankful, because your brother has gone to heaven and is with 
the angels. He is enjoying himself there and having a better time than us. He 
is ﬂying around like the angels, and taking a look at everything. ” He turned 
his friend’s woeful tears into happy smiles.

Exactly like that weeping child, in the grim situation of this sorrowful 
winter I received news of two deaths. One was my nephew, the late Fuad, 
who had both come ﬁrst in advanced schools, and had published the truths 
of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . The second was my late sister, called Hanım, a scholar 
who went on the Hajj and died while circumambulating the Ka‘ba. These 
deaths of two relatives made me weep, like that of the late Abdurrahman, 
which is described in the Tr e a t i s e   f o r   t h e   E l d e r l y . Then, through the light of 
belief I saw in my heart that the innocent Fuad and righteous Hanım had as 
companions angels and houris in place of humans and had been saved from 
the perils and sins of this world. Feeling overwhelming joy instead of that 
searing sorrow, I congratulated both them, and Fuad’s father, Abdülmecid, 
and myself, and I offered thanks to the Most Merciful of the Merciful. This 
has been included here as a prayer for mercy for the two departed.

All  the  comparisons  and  allegories  in  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   describe  T h e  
F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f  that have as their consequences happiness in this world and 
the next. In respect of the happiness and pleasures of life they display in this 
world, those universal and extensive fruits give news that they will gain for 
human beings everlasting happiness, indeed, that they will produce shoots 
and develop in that way. Five of those numerous universal fruits have been 
written at the end of the Thirty-First Word as fruits of the Ascension, and ﬁve 
are included as examples in the Fifth Branch of the Twenty-Fourth Word.

We said at the beginning that each of the pillars of faith have numerous 
different fruits, even innumerable fruits, and that similarly, a single fruit of 
the totality of the fruits is vast Paradise, and another is eternal happiness, 
while  another  and  perhaps  the  sweetest  is  the  vision  of  Allah.  Also  some 
of  T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f   yielding  happiness  in  both  worlds,  this  world  and 
the hereafter, have been well described in the comparison at the end of the 
Thirty-Second Word.

Evidence that belief in divine determining yields precious fruits in this 
world  is  the  fact  that  the  saying  ِرَدﯬﯧْ(cid:170)ا   َنِ(cid:174)   َنِ(cid:174)َا  ِرَدَ(cid:163)ْ(cid:170)اِ(cid:92)   َنَ(cid:174)ٰا   ْنَ(cid:174)  is  widely

known  as  a  proverb.  Two  universal  fruits  of  belief  in  divine  determining 
are  explained  in  the  ﬁne  comparison  at  the  end  of  the  Tr e a t i s e   o n   D i v i n e  
D e t e r m i n i n g , which is about two men who enter the lovely garden of a pal-
ace, and I myself in my own life have experienced thousands of times and 
understood  that  if  one  does  not  believe  in  divine  determining,  it  destroys 
the happiness of this worldly life. But whenever, in grievous misfortunes, I 
looked from the point of view of divine determining, I saw that they were 
greatly lightened, and I would be astonished at how those who do not believe 
it can continue to live.

One of the universal fruits of the pillar of belief in the angels is alluded 
to in the Second Station of the Twenty-Second Word like this: supplicating 
Almighty Allah, Azra’il ( Upon whom be peace ) said:

“ Your servants will be vexed at me and complain about me when I carry 

out my duty of seizing the spirits of the dying. ”

He was told in reply: “ I shall make illnesses and calamities a veil to your 
duties, so my servants’ complaints will be directed at them and not at you. ”
Azra’il’s duty is a veil in exactly the same way that the above are veils, so 
that unjustiﬁed complaints are not directed at Almighty Allah. For not eve-
ryone can see the aspects of wisdom, mercy, beauty, and advantage in death; 
they see its apparent face and start to object and complain. Azra’il was made 
a veil so that these unjustiﬁed complaints are not directed at the Absolutely 
Compassionate One. In exactly the same way, the function of all the angels, 
indeed of all apparent causes, is to be veils to the dignity of dominicality, 
so that the dignity and holiness of divine power and comprehensiveness of 
divine mercy are preserved in things the beauty of which is not apparent and 
the wisdom of which is not understood; and they are not the target of objec-
tions, and so that in the superﬁcial view divine power does not appear to be 
in contact with base, trivial, or cruel things. For the R i s a l e - i   N u r  has proved 
deﬁnitively with innumerable evidences that the stamps of divine unity on 
all things show clearly that no cause has an actual effect or the ability to cre-
ate. Creation and the giving of existence are particular to Him. Causes are 
merely a veil. Conscious beings like angels can do nothing other than a sort 
of voluntary duty in accordance with their natures and active worship which 
is called acquisition, and is insigniﬁcant and not creative.

Yes, dignity and grandeur demand that in the view of the mind causes 
are veils to the hand of power. While unity and oneness demand that causes 
abstain from having any real effect.

288

THE RAYS

Just as angels and the apparent causes employed in good works pertaining 
to existence are all means of exonerating dominical power of fault and tyr-
anny in things the beauties of which are not known or seen, and of hallowing 
it and preserving it from the ascription of fault; so too, satans from among 
jinn and men and harmful matters being employed in evil matters pertain-
ing to non-existence is to hallow and glorify Allah by saving divine power 
from being the target of complaint and wrongful accusations of cruelty. It is 
to exonerate Him and declare Him free of all the faults in the universe. For 
all faults arise from non-existence, or lack of ability, or destruction, or the 
failure to perform duties, which are all non-existence and acts which are not 
existent and pertain to non-existence. The faults are ascribed to these satanic 
and evil veils, the objections and complaints are deservedly directed at them, 
and they are means of Almighty Allah being pronounced free of all defect.

In  any  event,  strength  or  power  are  not  necessary  for  evil  destructive 
works pertaining to non- existence; sometimes extensive non-existence or 
destruction  may  occur  through  some  petty  act  or  insigniﬁcant  power,  or 
even the failure to perform a duty. It is supposed those doers of evil possess 
power, but they have no effect other than non-existence and no power other 
minor acquisition. But since the evils arise from non-existence, the doers of 
evil are the true agents. If they are intelligent beings, they deservedly pay the 
penalty. That is to say, in evils the perpetrators are the true doers, but since 
good deeds and acts are existent, those who do them are not the true doers 
and do not have an actual effect. They are recipients rather, receiving the 
divine effulgence; the All-Wise Qur’an states that their reward too is purely 
a divine favour, and says:

( 4:79 )   ã â á à ß Þ Ý Ü Û Ú Ù Ø ×
I n    S h o r t :  While the universes of existence and the innumerable worlds 
of non-existence clash, producing fruits like Paradise and Hell; and all the 
worlds of existence declare: “ All praise be to Allah! All praise be to Allah! ” 
and all the worlds of non-existence declare: “ Glory be to Allah! Glory be to 
Allah! ”; and while through an all-encompassing law of contest angels and 
satans, and instances of good and instances of evil, as far as the inspirations 
and satanic whisperings of the heart, all struggle against each other; a fruit of 
belief in the angels is suddenly manifested, solving the matter and illuminat-
ing the universe. Showing us one of the lights of the verse,

it shows us just how sweet is this fruit.

The Twenty-Fourth and Twenty-Ninth Word -the latter of which dem-
onstrates the marvels of the a l i f s  1 - point out a second universal fruit, and 
prove  in  brilliant  fashion  the  existence  and  functions  of  the  angels.  Yes, 
in  everything  in  the  universe,  particular  and  universal,  in  every  realm  of 
being, is a compassionate, splendid dominicality which makes itself known 
and loved. Most certainly it is necessary to respond to that splendour, that 
compassion, that making known and loved, with thanks and comprehensive, 
conscious  worship,  declaring  them  to  be  free  of  all  fault.  And  it  is  only 
countless angels that can perform the duty on behalf of unconscious inani-
mate creatures and the great elements, and can represent the wise, majestic 
activity of the sovereignty of that dominicality everywhere on the earth, on 
the Pleiades, in the foundations of the earth, and outside it.

Through this fruit, for example, the creation of the earth and its natural 
duties, which the soulless laws of philosophy show to be dark and desolate, 
are placed in luminous familiar fashion on the shoulders of, that is, under the 
supervision of, two angels called Thawr ( the Bull ) and Hut ( the Fish ). And 
a truth, a substance of the hereafter called s a k h r a , is sent as an everlasting 
foundation stone of the transitory earth, that is, as a sign that in the future 
part of it will be transformed into eternal Paradise, and is made a point of 
support for the angels Thawr and Hut. This was narrated by the old proph-
ets of the Children of Israel, and also by Ibn ‘Abbas. Unfortunately, in the 
course of time, this sacred meaning and allegory was taken literally by the 
ordinary people and acquired a form outside the bounds of reason. Since the 
angels travel through earth and rock and the centre of the earth the same as 
they do through the air, they, and the earth, surely have no need of physical 
rocks and a ﬁsh and ox to support them.

Also  for  example,  since  the  globe  utters  divine  gloriﬁcations  to  the 
number of its realms of beings, with tongues to the number of the members 
of those species, and to the parts, leaves, and fruits of those members, surely 
there will be an appointed angel with forty thousand heads and forty thou-
sand tongues in each head, each of which will utter forty thousand divine 
gloriﬁcations, which will know that splendid, unconscious, innate worship, 
represent it consciously, and offer it to the divine court, as the Bringer of 
Sure News (UWBP) informed us absolutely correctly.

Also, the existence and extraordinary nature of angels like Gabriel ( Upon 
whom be peace ), who conveys and announces the dominical relations with 
man, the most important result of the universe’s creation; and Israﬁl ( Upon 
whom be peace ) and Azra’il ( Upon whom be peace ), who merely represent 
the Creator’s most awesome actions in the world of animate beings, which 
are  the  raising  to  life  and  giving  of  life,  and  the  release  from  duties  with 
death, and they supervise them in worshipful manner; and Michael ( Upon 
whom be peace ) who besides supervising the bounties of the Most Merci-
ful in food, which is the most extensive and most pleasurable mercy in the 
sphere of life, consciously represents unconscious thanks - the existence and 
extraordinary nature of angels like these, and the immortality of their spir-
its, are necessitated by the sovereignty and splendour of dominicality. Their 
existence and that of their own species is as certain and free of doubt as the 
existence of the sovereignty and splendour that are to be seen in the universe 
as clearly as the sun. Comparisons may be made with this for other matters 
concerning the angels.

Yes,  the  All-Powerful  One  of  Glory  and  Beauty  created  four  hundred 
thousand species of living beings on the earth, and created beings with spir-
its in great abundance, even out of common and rotting substances, ﬁlling 
everywhere with them. In the face of the miracles of His art He causes them 
to declare: “ What wonders Allah has willed! How great are Allah’s bless-
ings! Glory be to Allah! ”, and before the gifts of His mercy: “ All praise be 
to Allah! All thanks be to Allah! Allah is Most Great! ” Most certainly and 
without doubt therefore He created inhabitants and spirit beings suitable for 
the vast heavens, who never rebel and perform constant worship. Not leav-
ing  the  heavens  empty,  He  populated  them  with  these  beings.  He  created 
too countless different sorts of angels, far greater in number than the animal 
species. Some in tiny form, mount raindrops and snowﬂakes and applaud the 
divine art and mercy in their own tongues. Others mount the travelling stars 
and  on  their  journeys  through  space,  through  their  divine  exaltations  and 
pronouncements of divine unity, proclaim to the world their worship before 
the grandeur, splendour and dignity of dominicality.

The agreement of all the revealed scriptures and religions since the time 
of Adam concerning the existence and worship of the angels, and the numer-
ous unanimous reports in all ages of conversations and meetings of humans 
with the angels, proves that their existence is as certain as the existence of 
the people of America, whom we have never seen, and that they are con-
cerned with us.

Now come and taste through the light of belief this second universal fruit; 
see how it ﬁlls the universe from end to end, making it beautiful and trans-
forming it into a vast mosque and place of worship. In the face of science 
and philosophy showing it to be cold, lifeless, dark, and desolate, it shows 
it to be full of life and light, conscious, familiar, and agreeable, allowing the 
people of belief to experience a manifestation of the pleasures of immortal 
life according to their degree, while still in this world.

Conclusion:  Since  through  the  mysteries  of  divine  unity  and  oneness, 
the same power, the same names, the same wisdom, and the same art are 
found in every part of the universe, the Creator’s unity, disposal, giving of 
existence, dominicality, creativity, and sacredness are proclaimed through 
the tongues of disposition of all creatures, particular and universal. So too 
He created the angels, and caused the gloriﬁcations which all creatures offer 
unconsciously through the tongues of their beings to be offered consciously 
through the worshipful tongues of the angels. None of the angels’ actions 
are in any respect contrary to the divine command. Apart from pure wor-
ship, they do nothing; they bring nothing into being, can intervene in nothing 
unless  commanded,  and  cannot  intercede  even,  without  permission.  They 
manifest to the utmost the meaning of:

Commanding Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) and his community to ‘’Pro-
tect yourselves from the evil beings and satans among jinn and men who 
strive in the universe on account of the worlds of non-being,’’ this mighty, 
wondrous sura looks to all ages, and through its allusive meaning looks to a 
greater degree to our strange age, even explicitly, and calls on the Qur’an’s 
servants  to  seek  refuge  with  Allah.  This  miraculous  prediction  about  the 
Unseen will be explained brieﬂy in ﬁve signs, as follows:

All the verses of this sura have numerous meanings.Only in respect of 
its allusive meaning,its repeating the word  : four times in ﬁve sentences; 
and with a powerful relation and in four ways its pointing the ﬁnger with 
the  same  date  to  the  four  unparalleled,  ghastly,  stormyevils,  material  and 
immaterial, of this age, with its revolutions and clashes, and its implicitly 
giving the command: “ withdraw from these; ” is certainly guidance from the 
Unseen in a way beﬁtting the Qur’an’s miraculousness.

For example, the sentence 7  6  5  4 coincides with the date 
1352  or  1354  according  to  a b j a d   and  j a f r   reckoning,  alluding  to  the  Sec-
ond World War, which was brewing up then erupted due to the prevalent 
ambition and greed of humankind and the First War, and in effect saying to 
the community of Muhammad ( UWBP ): “ Do not enter this war, but seek 

292

THE FRUITS OF BELIEF – ELEVENTH TOPIC

293

refuge with your Sustainer. ” With another of its allusive meanings, as a spe-
cial favour to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students, who are servants of the Qur’an, it 
hints to them that they were to be saved around the same date from Eskişehir 
Prison  and  an  awesome  evil,  and  that  the  plans  to  eliminate  them  would 
come to nothing. It was as though commanding them symbolically to seek 
refuge with Allah.

And for example, the sentence <  ;   :  9 makes 1361 – the doubled 
rā  is  not  counted –  and  points  the  ﬁnger  through  both  the  Rumi  and  Hijri 
dates at the cruel, tyrannical destruction of this unmatched war. Coinciding 
too with the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students, who work with all their strength to serve 
the Qur’an, begin delivered from an extensive plan to eliminate them and 
from a grievous calamity and Denizli Prison, it looks with an allusive mean-
ing to them too. With a concealed sign it says: “ Protect yourselves from the 
evil of creatures. ”

And  for  example,  making  1328  if  the  doubled  letters  are  not  counted 
and 1358 if the doubled l ā m  is counted, the sentence H   G  F 
coincides with the dates when due to their ambition and greed the Europe-
ans tyrants who caused the two World Wars, instigated a change of sultan 
and the Balkan and Italian Wars with the idea of spoiling the consequences 
of the Constitutional Revolution, which favoured the Qur’an; then with the 
outbreak of the First World War, through the political diplomats blowing 
their evils, material and immaterial and their sorcery and poison into every-
one’s heads through the tongue of the radio and their inculcating their covert 
plans  into  the  heart  of  human  destiny,  they  prepared  the  evils  that  would 
savagely destroy a thousand years of the progress of civilization; this cor-
responds exactly to the meaning of H   G  F 

And  for  example,  the  sentence  N  M  L     K  J  makes  1347 
– the  doubled  r ā   and  t a n w ī n   are  not  counted –  and  coincides  exactly,  and 
is consonant in meaning, with the signiﬁcant upheavals which occurred in 
this country due to the enforced European treaties, and the changes that took 
place in this religious nation due to the oppression of philosophy, and the 
awesome  envy,  rivalry  and  clashes  in  various  countries  which  paved  the 
way for the Second World War. These are surely ﬂashes of this sacred sura’s 
miraculous predictions concerning the Unseen.

THE RAYS

A Reminder
All  Qur’anic  verses  have  numerous  meanings.  And  all  the  meanings  are 
universal; they have signiﬁcations in every century. Those discussed here 
are only its level of allusive meaning which looks to our century. Within that 
universal meaning our age is one signiﬁcation, but it has gained particularity 
and looks to it and its date. Since these last four years I have known neither 
the  stages  of  the  war,  nor  its  results,  nor  whether  or  not  peace  has  been 
declared, and I have not asked, I have not knocked on the door of this sacred 
sura  to  learn  how  many  allusions  it  contains  to  this  century  and  its  wars. 
It has however been proved and explained in various parts of the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r , and especially in R u m û z â t - ı   S e m a n i y e  ( The Eight Symbols ), that this 
treasury contains many more mysteries, so referring readers to those, I am 
cutting this short.

The answer to a question that might occur to one

In  this  ﬂash  of  miraculousness,  in  the  <  ;   :  9  at  the  beginning, 

both the “   f r o m   9  ”  and “   t h e   e v i l   :   ”  being counted, and in 
N  M  L     K  J at the end, only the word “   e v i l   :  ”  being counted, 
and “   a n d   f r o m   J  ”  not being counted, and in neither of these words being 
counted in H   G  F  E  D    is a sign indicating an extremely 
subtle relationship. For there is good as well as evil in people (   k h a l q   ) , and 
not all evil is visited on everyone. Alluding to this, “   f r o m   9  ”  and “   e v i l  
:  ”  which are partitive, are counted. But the envier is altogether evil when 
he envies, so there is no need for the partitive. And according to the allusion 
of H   G  F there is no need for the word : to be counted here, 
for all the works of those casters of spells and sorcerer diplomats who have 
set the globe ablaze for their own beneﬁts are pure evil.

An addendum to a point about the miraculousness of this sura

An addendum to a point about the miraculousness of this sura

Just  as  with  four  of  its  ﬁve  sentences,  this  sura  looks  with  its  allusive 
meaning to the four largest evil revolutions and storms this century; so, with 
its allusive meaning and according to jafr reckoning, by its repeating four 
times the phrase  :  9 the doubling is not counted, it looks to and points 
the ﬁnger at the century of the dissension of Jenghiz Khan and Hulagu and

the time of the fall of the ‘Abbasid dynasty, which was the most fearsome 
calamity experienced by the Islamic world. 

Yes,  without  doubling,  “   t h e   e v i l   :  ”   makes  500,  and  “   f r o m   9  ”  
is  90.  Numerous  verses  which  look  to  the  future,  as  well  as  Imam  ‘Ali 
( May Allah be pleased with him ) and Ghawth al-A‘zam ( May his mys-
tery  be  sanctiﬁed ),  who  alluded  to  both  our  century  and  those  times  in 
their predictions of the future, saw both our century and that century and 
made predictions in exactly the same way. With @ making 1161 and 
B  A making 810, these words B  A  @ look not to these times 
but to the signiﬁcant material and immaterial evils of those times. If they 
are counted together, they make 1971 and give news of some ghastly evil 
at that date. If the crops of the seeds of the present are not rectiﬁed, the 
blows will certainly be terrible.

to the Addendum of the Eleventh Topic 

(cid:2)(cid:3)
The verse, ( 2.256 )  Ú  Ù (  Ø  ×  Ö ÕÔ  )   Ó    Ò  Ñ which is the 
complement of the Throne Verse, makes 1350; Þ  Ý  Ü makes 
1929  or  1928; â   á  à  ß  makes  946,  corresponding  to 
the name Risaletü’n-Nur; ä  ã makes 1347; 

(  $   #  "  )  !  *  ë  ê  é  èç  æ  å  if  counted  together 
makes 1012, and if not counted together 945, with one doubling not being 
counted; )  ( (  '  ) &  % makes 1372, without doubling; 

(  .  ) -         ,  + makes 1417; 
3  (  2  1   0  /  )  makes  1338,  the  doubling  is  not 
counted; ;   :  9  87  6  5  makes  1295,  the  dou-
bling is counted.

It  was  imparted  to  me  that  with  their  allusive  meanings,  these  verses 
coincide exactly and twice with both the name of the Risaletü’n-Nur and the 
form of its striving; and with the date the people of unbelief were attempting 
to extinguish the light of the World of Islam with the war of 1293 ( 1877-
78 ); and with the date the terrible treaties were signed in 1338 taking advan-
tage of the First World War and in order to cast it into darkness in fact. It 
was  imparted  to  me  too  that  light  and  darkness  are  repeatedly  contrasted 
in these verses, and in this immaterial struggle a light proceeding from the 
Qur’an’s light would become a point of support for the people of belief. I 
was compelled to set this down in writing. Then I saw that the relationship 
of its meaning with this century was so powerful that even had there been 
no sign through the coincidences, I would still have been certain that these 
verses were speaking with us through their allusive meanings, just as they 
look to all centuries.

Yes, ﬁrstly, the sentence at the beginning, 

(  Ø  ×  Ö ÕÔ  )   Ó    Ò  Ñ points through a b j a d  and j a f r  reckoning 
to the date 1350 [ if Rumi, 1934, or if Hijri, 1931-2 ], and through its allusive 
meaning, says: By the matters of religion being separated from those of 
this world on that date, freedom of conscience, which is opposed to force 
and compulsion in religion, and to religious struggle and armed j i h a d  for 
religion,  was  accepted  as  a  fundamental  rule  and  political  principle  by 
governments,  and  this  state  became  a  secular  republic.  In  view  of  this, 
j i h a d  will be a non-physical religious j i h a d  with the sword of certain, real-
ized belief. Because it shows a ﬂash of miraculousness indicating that a 
light will emerge from the Qur’an which will make known and set forth 
clearly proofs so powerful they will demonstrate almost visibly the guid-
ance and truths of religion.

Furthermore, as far as the word “  ;  - t o   d w e l l   t h e r e i n   f o r   e v e r,   ”  
by repeating the contrast between light and darkness, and belief and dark-
ness – the source and origin of all the comparisons in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and 
just  like  them –  is  a  concealed  sign  that  a  great  hero  in  the  contest  of  the 
moral j i h a d   ( m â n e v î   j i h a d )  at that date is the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which bears the 
name of light. For its immaterial sword has solved hundreds of the mysteries 
of religion, leaving no need for physical swords.

Yes, countless thanks be to Allah, for twenty years the R i s a l e - i   N u r  has 
demonstrated this prediction and ﬂash of miraculousness in fact. It is due to 
this mighty mystery that R i s a l e - i   N u r  students do not interfere in the politics 
and political currents of the world and their material struggles, nor attach 
importance to them, nor condescend to any involvement with them. Its true 
students say to their most fearsome enemies in the face of their insults and 
aggression:

“ You wretch! I am trying to save you from eternal annihilation and to 
raise you from the basest and most grievous level of ephemeral animality to 
the happiness of immortal humanity, although you are working for my death 
and execution. Your pleasures in this world are very few and ﬂeeting and the 
penalties and torments you will suffer in the hereafter will be very great and 
very longlasting. For me, death will be a discharge from duties. Go away! I 
am not going to bother with you, do whatever you like! ” They feel not anger 
at their enemies, but pity and compassion. They try to reform them, in the 
hope they shall be saved.

Secondly:  (   ä  ã  )  (  â   á  à  ß   )  These  two 
sacred sentences have a powerful relationship, and according to a b j a d  and 
j a f r  reckoning the ﬁrst corresponds exactly with the name Risaletü’n-Nur, 
and  the  second  corresponds  in  meaning,  and  according  to  j a f r   reckoning 
with its being realized and perfected and its brilliant conquests. These cor-
respondences are an indication that this century at this date, the Risaletü’n-
Nur is “   a  m o s t  t r u s t w o r t h y   h a n d h o l d .   ”  That is, it is an unbreakable chain of 
great strength and a “ rope of Allah (   ḥ a b l u l l ā h   )  ”(3:103) They inform through 
their allusive meanings that those who lay hold of it and cling onto it will 
be saved.

Thirdly: Both in meaning and according to j a f r  reckoning, the sentence 

$   #  "  ! makes an allusion to the Risaletü’n-Nur, as follows...

( The curtain descended here and permission was not given to write it. It 

has been postponed to another time. )

( 2:32 ) \ [ Z Y X W V U T S R Q

NOTE

The reason permission was not given to write the remainder of this point 
for now is that it touches to an extent on politics and this world, and we are 
prohibited from considering these. Yes, the verse, ( 96.6 ) g  f    e  looks 
to this “   ṭ ā g h ū t   ”  and draws attention to it...

My Beloved and Esteemed Master!
With the great good it contains for this nation and country, with its Ninth 
Topic T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f  was not only the means of salvation of its students 
while in the midst of their greatest enemies and the awesomely rebellious, 
but also with its Tenth and Eleventh Topics, it applauded the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
students in particular on the ways of reality. Moreover, concerning the cir-
cumstances of the grave, which we are certain to enter, by making familiar 
that place under the earth, which makes everyone tremble and is a source 
of terror especially for the heedless, where we will meet and speak with the 
angels; it made us happy at their companionship and dispelled our terrible 
fears about that ﬁrst stopping-place, letting us breathe freely. In the hands of 
those like me who have not seen that luminous life, it resembles an electric 
lamp whose rays penetrate hundreds of thousands of years. It also resembles 
a model ﬂower garden, the scents of which are ever a source of delight.

Yes,  I  suggest  to  our  beloved  Master  that  like  students  who  everyday 
recite their lessons to their teacher, we should always describe to our beloved 
Master  the  effulgence  we  receive  from  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r .  But  for  now  our 
beloved Master is refraining from speaking.

My Dear Master! The reality of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , the beauty of the Fruits, 
and effulgence of its ﬂowers have driven me to utter a few words, gratefully, 
and  in  the  name  of  my  country,  and  have  breathed  life  into  many  hearts 
which speak like mine. But now, due to the “ ﬂower ” of the Eleventh Fruit 
of Belief, the steps taken against the R i s a l e - i   N u r  in our area and the hands 
raised against it, have become harsher and stronger, and have been stirred 
into action.

Your humble student,

the proofs of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and efforts of his students works to cure the 
ills of the Islamic world like Luqman the Wise, and has proved with thirty-
three verses of the Qur’an and the wondrous predictions of Imam ‘Ali and 
the Ghawth al- A‘zam that the R i s a l e - i   N u r  with its different parts is truth 
and reality...

Who  although  he  is  himself  ill  and  elderly  and  weak  and  in  a  piteous

responds  to  those  wrong  him  with  the  truths  of  the  Qur’an  and  proofs  of

Who  together  with  his  students  was  sent  to  prison  because  one  of  his

was the cause of all the ignorant among us there learning to read the whole

of  the  Qur’an  and  solace  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   and  endurance  of  his  broth-

Miraculous Exposition, and the powerful proofs of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and sin-

dents, that the World of Islam has need for the R i s a l e - i   N u r  as it does for

and written them out have entered the grave in a state of belief, and has 
never defeated or embarrassed the students who follow him, and through

feared  by  all  the  world –  from  being  eternal  annihilation  and  transformed 
it into a discharge from duties and shown that for the unbelievers and dis-
semblers it is eternal annihilation; has proved in accordance with the certain 
news of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, conﬁrmed both by the thou-
sand miracles of Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) and its 
forty aspects of miraculousness, and endorsed by the proofs of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  –which proceeds from the Qur’an– which have defeated even its most 
obdurate  enemies  and  are  submitted  to  by  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students,  and 
are corroborated too by many signs, experiences, and convictions, that the 
terrifying, cold, dark and narrow grave is for the believers a pit of Paradise 
and a door onto the gardens of Paradise, while for the disbelievers and dis-
sembling atheists is a pit of Hell full of snakes and scorpions; and has made 
the angels called Munkar and Nakir, who will enter there, familiar compan-
ions for the people of truth and those who have taken the way of reality; and 
included the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students among students of the religious sciences,

and  the  extraordinary  efforts  of  the  heroic  brothers  and  students  of  the

“ write! ”, although no one since the time of the Prophet ( UWBP ) had been 
able to write it in such miraculous fashion, its being written like the Qur’an 
inscribed  on  the  Preserved  Tablet,  –  has  proved  in  beautiful  and  brilliant 
fashion, never before seen or heard, that the Qur’an of Mighty Stature is the 
true Word of Allah, and the greatest of all the revealed books, and that there 
are thousands of Sura al-Fatiha’s within one Sura al-Fatiha, and thousands 
of Sura al-Ikhlas’s within one Sura al-Ikhlas, and that its letters yield ten, a 
hundred, a thousand, and thousands of merits and good deeds...

Who has proved, through the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition demon-
strating its miraculousness for one thousand three hundred years and halting 
those who oppose it, and through the proofs of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  that are so 
clear as to be almost visible, and through the diamond pens of the R i s a l e - i

mad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) was a true Messenger, the lord 
of  all  the  twenty-four  thousand  prophets,  and  the  most  virtuous  of  them, 
and through the Qur’an of Mighty Stature proclaiming to the universe that 
Allah’s Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) was sent as a Mercy to All the Worlds, 
and  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   demonstrating  from  beginning  to  end  that  he  was  a 
Mercy to All the Worlds, and showing even to the blind that the Messen-

the  world,  and  through  the  testimony  of  calamities  being  lifted  when  the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  is disseminated in Anatolia and other countries, and disasters 
occurring when it is silenced, and through the ﬁrm and steadfast attachment 
to  their  work  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students  despite  the  extremely  difﬁcult 
circumstances, has shown how proﬁtable it is to follow the practices of that 
Being ( UWBP ) and that to follow a single of his practices at this time gains 
the reward of a hundred martyrs, and has proved absolutely certainly that 
for twenty years the R i s a l e - i   N u r  has repulsed the calamities and disasters 
that would otherwise have been visited on Anatolia, the same as almsgiving

To modestly reject this letter, which far exceeds my due, would be ingrat-
itude and an insult to the favourable opinions of all the students, while to 
accept it exactly as it is would tell of pride, egotism, and conceit. Therefore, 
adding thirteen sections, I am sending you a copy of this long letter writ-
ten by the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s scribe in everyone’s name, both by way of thanks 
and to be saved from pride and ingratitude. It may be added at the end of 
the Eleventh Topic with the title: A letter from the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students of

twice a pigeon alighted at my window. It was going to enter, but saw Cey-

the same way. It too saw the scribe’s head and did not come inside. I said: 
“ Most probably they are bearers of good news like the sparrow and  k u d -

secret letters, they came to congratulate us on amending the auspicious letter 
in this way. ”

[ Part of the Defence Speeches Given in Denizli Court ] 1

... ... ...
Yes,  we  are  a  society  and  we  are  a  society  that  every  century  has  had 
three hundred and ﬁfty million [ now one and a half thousand million ] mem-
bers. Every day by through the ﬁve obligatory prayers, its members dem-
onstrate with complete veneration their attachment to the principles of that 
sacred society. Through the sacred programme of 
 ( 49:10 )  ¯ ® ¬ 
they hasten to assist one another with their prayers and spiritual gains. We 
are members of that sacred, vast society, and our particular duty is to teach 
the believers in certain, realized fashion the Qur’anic truths of belief, and 
save  them  and  ourselves  from  eternal  extinction  and  everlasting  solitary 
conﬁnement in the Intermediate Realm. We have absolutely no connection 
with any worldly, political, scheming society or clandestine group, or the 
covert organizations concerning which on no grounds whatsover we have 
been charged; we do not condescend to such things.

If we had had any desire to interfere in worldly affairs, it would not have 
been with the buzzing of a ﬂy, it would have exploded like the ﬁring of a 
cannon. To accuse someone who defended himself vehemently in the Mili-
tary Court and in the ofﬁce of the Speaker of the National Assembly in the 
presence of an angry Mustafa Kemal, of hatching plots for eighteen years 
without allowing anyone to be aware of it, is certainly due to some grudge 
or hatred.

1.  Since the matters were the same, our Master, Üstad Bediuzzaman Said Nursi, pre-
sented the same defence - skipping where necessary and adding where necessary- to Afyon 
Court as he had at Denizli. He therefore put the greater part of the Denizli defence speech-
es together with those of Afyon, and gave them the name of the Fourteenth Ray.

The R i s a l e - i   N u r  should not be attacked in this question because of my 
personal faults or those of some of my brothers. It is bound directly to the 
Qur’an, and the Qur’an is bound to the Sublime Throne, so who could dare 
to stretch out his hand there and unfasten those strong ropes?

Moreover, the R i s a l e - i   N u r , whose blessings –material and spiritual– for 
this country, and its exceptional service, are alluded to by thirty-three of the 
Qur’an’s verses, by three predictions of Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased 
with him ), and the certain news of Gawth al-A‘zam ( May his mystery be 
sanctiﬁed ),  may  not  be  held  responsible  for  our  petty,  personal  faults;  it 
cannot be and should not be. Irreparable harm will otherwise come to this 
country, both material and spiritual. 1

Allah willing, the aggression and plots against the R i s a l e - i   N u r  of some 
evil-minded  atheists  will  be  foiled,  for  its  students  cannot  be  compared 
with other people; they cannot be scattered or made to give it up; through 
Allah’s grace, they will not be defeated. They have won the regard of this 
nation, as though they were vital for it, and are found everywhere; even if 
the Qur’an had not prevented them from physical defence, they still would 
not get involved in minor, fruitless incidents like those of Shaykh Said and 
Menemen. 2 If, Allah forbid, they were persecuted and the R i s a l e - i   N u r  was 
attacked  to  the  extext  they  felt  compelled,  those  atheists  and  dissemblers 
who hoodwink the government would certainly come to regret it a thousand 
times over.

I n   S h o r t :  We do not interfere in the world of the worldly, so they should 

not interfere in our service of belief and in our lives of the hereafter.

certainty of twice two equalling four that through the mystery of the Qur’an 
for us death has been transformed from eternal extinction into a discharge 
from duties, and that for those who oppose us and follow misguidance cer-
tain death is either eternal annihilation ( if they do not have certain belief in 
the hereafter ), or everlasting, dark solitary conﬁnement ( if they believe in 
the hereafter and take the way of vice and misguidance ). Is there a greater 
or more important question for humanity in this world than this that it can be 
a tool for it? I ask you! Since there is not and cannot be, why do you strive 
against us? In the face of your greatest penalty, we receive our discharge 
papers to go to the world of light, so we await it with complete fortitude. 
But we know as clearly as seeing it, like we see you in this court, that those 
who reject us and condemn us on behalf of misguidance will in a very short 
time be condemned to eternal annihilation and solitary conﬁnement and will 
suffer that awesome punishment, and with our feelings of humanity we ear-
nestly pity them. I am ready to prove this certain and important fact and also 
to silence the most stubborn of them. If I was unable to prove it as clearly 
as  daylight,  not  to  that  unscholarly,  prejuiced  committee  of  scholars  who 
knew nothing of spiritual and moral matters, but to the greatest scholars and 
philosophers, I would be content with any punishment!

Just as an example, I offer the treatise  T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f ,  which was 
written for the prisoners on two Fridays and since it explains the principles 
and bases of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , is like a defence of it. We are working secretly 
under great difﬁculties to have this written out in the new letters 1 so as to 
give  it  to  the  departments  of  government  in  Ankara.  Read  it  and  study  it 
carefully; if your heart ( I cannot speak for your soul ) does not afﬁrm me, I 
shall remain silent in the face of whatever insults and torment you inﬂict on 
me in the solitary conﬁnement in which I am now held!

I n   S h o r t :   Either  leave  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   completely  free,  or  smash  this 
powerful and irrefutable truth if you can! Up to now, I have not thought of 
you and your world. And I was not going to think of it, but you forced me, 
and perhaps even divine determining sent us on this way in order to warn 
you. As for us, we resolved to take as our guide the sacred rule,

Saying that we are “ corrupting religion, ” they have censured us for com-
piling  a  H i z b   a l - Q u r ’ a n i ,   like  a  large  A n ‘ a m ,   1  out  of  hundreds  of  well-
known verses which are the particular sources of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , although 
this is an Islamic custom that has been practised since the time of the Prophet 
( UWBP ).

They also want to convict us in connection with the Tr e a t i s e   o n   I s l a m i c  
D r e s s ,   for  which  I  have  already  served  a  year’s  sentence,  and  which  was 
being treated as conﬁdential, and as recorded in the police report, was pulled 
out from under the ﬁrewood – they want to show that it was written and pub-
lished this year. Also, I said strong words to the person ( Mustafa Kemal ) 
who was leader of the government in Ankara; I criticized him to his face 
and he did not respond but remained silent; yet the natural, necessary, and 
conﬁdential  criticisms  I  made  of  him  after  his  death  while  explaining  the 
meaning of a Hadith that indicated his error, were held to be a crime. But 
compared with the sake of the nation and government and the laws of jus-
tice, which are a manifestation of divine sovereignty, what importance has 
the sake of someone who is dead and no longer has any connection with the 
government?

Moreover, freedom of conscience, which is one of the principles of the 
government of the republic that we have most relied on and defended our-
selves with, has been made the basis of charges against us; as though we 
oppose the principle of freedom of conscience.

Another  thing  is  attributed  to  me  in  the  police  report  which  has  never 
ever occurred to me, that since I criticize the evils and faults of modern civi-
lization, I do not accept the use of the radio, 2 aeroplanes, and the railway; I 
am accused of opposing modern progress.

Allah willing, the fair-minded, just Denizli public prosecutor and court 
will make analogies with the above examples and show how unjust are these 
proceedings, and attach no importance to the unfounded suspicions in those 
reports.

The  most  extraordinary  of  them  is  this,  that  the  public  prosecutor  in 
another trial asked me: “ You said in the conﬁdential Fifth Ray that the army 

1.  A common former practice was to gather together in a single volume for constant 

reading Sūra al-An‘ām and other meritorious suras and verses from the Qur’an. [Tr.]

2.  I said, to encourage the offering of endless thanks for a supreme divine bounty like 
the radio, that the Qur’an should be recited on the radio so that people could hear it all over 
the world, and the globe’s atmosphere would become a reciter of the Qur’an.

308

would save itself from the leadership of that fearsome person. Your intention 
was to incite the army to rebel against the government. ” I replied: “ What I 
meant was that the commander would either die or would be transferred, and 
the army would be saved from his domination. ” How can a treatise that is 
both extremely conﬁdential, and copies of which have come into my posses-
sion only twice in eight years and then been lost, and expounds a universal 
meaning of a Hadith about the end of time, and was originally written long 
ago, and moreover one single soldier has not seen – how can such a treatise 
be the reason for such charges?

The  strangest  of  all  was  this,  that  I  said  in  one  place  that  Almighty 
Allah’s  great  bounties  of  the  aeroplane,  railway,  and  radio  should  be 
responded  to  with  great  thanks,  yet  mankind  had  not  done  this  and  had 
rained down bombs on men’s heads with the planes. While thanks for the 
vast bounty of the radio would be shown by making it a universal million-
tongued reciter of the Qur’an which would allow people all over the earth 
to listen to the Qur’an. And in the explanations in the Twentieth Word of 
Qur’anic predictions about the wonders of civilization, I said concerning 
the  allusions  of  one  verse  that  the  unbelievers  would  defeat  the  Islamic 
world by means of the railway. Although I urged Muslims to work towards 
these wonders, I am accused at the end of the indictment because of the 
previous public prosecutor’s malice, of “ opposing modern advances like 
the railway, aeroplane, and radio. ”

Also, although it has absolutely no connection, someone had said about 
the name R i s a l e t ü ’ n - N u r,  which is another name for the R i s a l e - i   N u r , that 
“ it  is  ‘a  message’  (   r i s a l e t   )   inspired  from  the  light  of  the  Qur’an; ”  and 
attaching  a  wrong  meaning  from  another  place  in  the  indictment,  they 
made it into another charge, as though  I  had said “ the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  is a 
divine messenger. ”

Also, I have proved decisively in twenty places in my defence that we 
would not make religion, the Qur’an, and the R i s a l e - i   N u r  tools of anything, 
even in the face of the whole world, and we could not, and that we would 
not change a single of their truths for all the world, and that is how we are 
in fact. Over these last twenty years there are thousands of evidences of this. 
Since it is thus, we declare with all our strength:

A Supplement to My Objections to the Indictment

[ Those addressed by these objections are not Denizli Court and the pub-
lic prosecutor, but the malicious, suspicious ofﬁcials, chieﬂy the Isparta 
and İnebolu prosecutors, who with their false and inaccurate records, 
were the cause of the extraordinary indictment against us here. ]
F i r s t l y : The R i s a l e - i   N u r  students, who are innocent and not in any way 
involved in politics, have unimaginably and on no grounds whatsoever been 
called a political society, and the unfortunates who have joined that circle 
and have no aim other than belief and the hereafter, have been considered 
guilty of being disseminators of that society, or active ofﬁcers or members 
of it, or of reading the R i s a l e - i   N u r  or teaching it or writing it out, and have 
been sent to trial. A certain proof of how far this is from the essence of jus-
tice is that although according to the principles of freedom of thought and 
freedom of study it is not considered a crime to read the harmful works of 
Doctor Dozy 1 and other atheists hostile to Islam, it is counted a crime for 
those people needy for the truths of the Qur’an and belief to read and write 
out the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which teaches those truths as brilliantly as the sun. In 
addition, only a few sentences from two or three treatises out of hundreds, 
which we had held to be conﬁdential so that no wrong meaning should be 
ascribed to them and had not permitted to be published, were made the pre-
text for our indictment. Whereas with one exception, Eskişehir Court had 
scrutinized those treatises and seen what they necessitated. As for the excep-
tion, I gave an extremely decisive answer to it in both my petition, and my 
objections to Eskişehir Court, and it was proved in twenty respects that “ we 
hold light, not the club of politics. ” Nevertheless, those unfair prosecutors 
inferred that the three or four sentences in three conﬁdential and unpublished 
treatises could be extended to the whole R i s a l e - i   N u r , and accused myself 
and those who read and write the R i s a l e - i  N u r  of contesting the government.
I  call  to  witness  my  close  friends  and  those  who  meet  with  me,  and  I 
swear that apart from two Presidents, one deputy, and the governor of Kas-
tamonu, for more than ten years, I have not known who the members and

ministers of the government are, or its leaders, ofﬁcials and deputies, and I 
have not felt the slightest curiosity to ﬁnd out. Is it at all possible for a person 
not to know the people he is contesting and not to be curious about them, 
for him not to know if they are friend or foe, and to attach no importance to 
ﬁnding out? It is clearly understood from this that they are concocting com-
pletely baseless pretexts to convict me whatever happens.

Since that is how it is, I say not to the court here, but to those unjust peo-
ple: I don’t give tuppence for the severest penalty you can inﬂict on me; it 
has no importance. For I am seventy years old and at the door of the grave. 
It is great good fortune for me to exchange one or two years of persecuted, 
innocent life for the rank of martyrdom. Thanks to the thousands of proofs 
of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , I believe absolutely certainly that for us death consists 
of discharge papers. If we are to be executed, one hour’s distress will be the 
key to eternal happiness and mercy. But you unjust people who confuse the 
judiciary on account of atheism and preoccupy the government with us for 
no reason! Know certainly that you will be condemned to eternal annihila-
tion  and  everlasting  solitary  conﬁnement,  and  tremble!  I  see  you  will  be 
made to pay for it many times over. I pity you even. Yes, death, which has 
emptied this city a hundred times into the graveyard, certainly has greater 
demands than life. And people being saved from being executed by it is the 
most pressing and most important question they face and their most essential 
and certain need. Even lunatics, therefore, would understand that in the eyes 
of reality and justice those who accuse on petty pretexts the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  
students, who have found this solution for themselves, and the R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
which provides it supported by thousands of proofs, themselves become the 
target of accusation.

There are three matters which deceive these unjust people, leading them 
to suspect the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students are a political society, with which they 
have absolutely no connection:

T h e   F i r s t :   Ever  since  early  days,  my  students  have  been  passionately 
attached to me, like brothers, and this has given rise to suspicions of a politi-
cal society.

T h e   S e c o n d :   Some  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students  have  acted  like  the 
groups  within  the  Islamic  community,  the  same  as  everywhere  and  as  is 
permitted by the laws of the republic, and this has been supposed to be a 
society. But the intention of those three or four students was not some sort 
of political society, it was purely sincere brotherhood in the service of belief 
and a solidarity which looks to the hereafter.

THE TWELFTH RAY

311

T h e   T h i r d :  Since those unjust people know themselves to be misguided 
and  lovers  of  the  life  of  this  world,  and  since  they  ﬁnd  some  of  the  laws 
of the land convenient for themselves, they say to themselves: “ Doubtless, 
Said and his friends are opposed to us and to the laws of the government 
which are favourable to our civilized illicit passions. They must therefore 
have a political society which is antagonistic to us. ” So I say to them:

You unfortunates! If the world had been eternal and human beings were 
going to remain in it for ever, and if their duties had consisted only of pol-
itics,  there  might  possibly  have  been  some  meaning  in  these  slanders  of 
yours. And if I had embarked on this matter for political ends, you would 
have found not ten sentences in a hundred treatises, but a thousand, to be 
combative and connected with politics. And if to suppose the impossible, 
like you we were working with all our strength for worldly aims, pleasures, 
and politics –which even Satan could not make anyone believe and accept– 
even if it was thus, since there is nothing these twenty years to suggest this, 
and  the  government  looks  to  the  hand  and  not  the  heart,  and  all  govern-
ments have ﬁerce opponents; then still there is nothing with which we can 
be charged according the laws of justice. My ﬁnal word is:

[ I quote exactly an old memory and subtle matter of defence which was 
not disclosed in Eskişehir Court, and not ofﬁcially recorded, and was 
not even written in my defence. ]

They asked me there: “ What do you think about the republic? ” I replied: 
“ My  biography,  which  you  have  in  your  possession,  proves  that  I  was  a 
religious  republican  before  any  of  you,  with  the  exception  perhaps  of  the 
chairman of Eskişehir Court, was born. A summary of it is this: like now, at 
that time I was living in seclusion in an uninhabited tomb. Someone would 
bring me soup and I used to give breadcrumbs to the ants. I used to eat my 
bread with the soup. Some people heard of this and asked me about it, and 
I told them: “ The ant and bee nations are republicans; I give the ants the 
breadcrumbs out of respect for their republicanism. ”

So they said: “ You are opposing the early leaders of Islam. ” I replied: 
“ The  Rightly-Guided  Caliphs  were  both  caliph  and  presidents  of  the

republic. Surely Abu Bakr the Veracious ( May Allah be pleased with him ), 
the Ten Promised Paradise, and the Companions of the Prophet ( UWBP ) 
were like presidents of the republic. But it was not some meaningless title; 
they were leaders of a religious republic the meaning of which was true jus-
tice and the freedom of the Shari‘a. ”

Mr. Prosecutor and Members of the Court! You are accusing me of hold-
ing an idea the opposite of which I have held for ﬁfty years. If you are ask-
ing  about  the  secular  republic,  what  I  understand  by  it  is  that  secularism 
means being unbiased; that is, in accordance with the principle of freedom 
of  conscience,  it  refers  to  a  government  that  does  not  interfere  with  reli-
giously-  minded  and  pious  people  the  same  as  it  does  not  interfere  with 
the  irreligious  and  dissolute.  I  have  withdrawn  from  political  and  social 
life for ten, and now its twenty, years. I do not know the state of the gov-
ernment of the republic. If, Allah forbid, it has taken on a fearsome form 
whereby, on account of irreligion, it promulgates laws indicting those who 
work for their belief and lives in the hereafter, I proclaim to you fearlessly 
and warn you: if I had a thousand lives, I would be ready to sacriﬁce all of 
them  for  belief  and  the  hereafter.  Do  whatever  you  like,  my  last  word  is

Sirs!
I have formed the certain opinion as a result of numerous indications that 
we have been attacked not for “ breaching public security by exploiting reli-
gious feelings ” on behalf of the government, but behind a tissue of lies, on 
behalf of atheism, because of our belief and our service to belief and public 
order. One proof of this out of many is that despite twenty thousand people 

THE TWELFTH RAY

313

reading and accepting the twenty thousand copies of the parts of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  over twenty years, public security has not been breached by students of 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  on any occasion whatsover, and no such incident has been 
recorded by the government, and neither the former nor the present courts 
have found such a incident. Whereas, had there been any such widespread, 
powerful propaganda, it would have become apparent within twenty days. 
That is to say, contrary to the principle of freedom of conscience, Article 
163 of this ambiguous law, 1 which embraces all who give religious counsel, 
is a bogus mask. Atheists deceive certain members of the government, con-
fuse the legal establishment, and want to crush us whatever happens.

Since  the  reality  of  the  matter  is  this,  we  say  with  all  our  strength:  O 
wretches who sell religion for the world and have fallen into absolute unbe-
lief!  Do  whatever  you  can!  Your  world  will  be  the  end  of  you!  Let  our 
heads be sacriﬁced for a truth that hundreds of millions of heads have been 
sacriﬁced for! We are ready for any penalty and for our execution! In this 
situation, being outside prison is a hundred times worse than being inside it. 
Since there is no freedom at all -neither religious freedom, nor freedom of 
conscience, nor scholarly freedom- under the absolute despotism that con-
fronts  us,  for  those  with  honour,  the  people  of  religion  and  supporters  of 
freedom, there is no solution apart from death or entering prison. We say,

Chairman of the Court, Ali Rıza Bey!
I have an important request in order to defend my rights: I do not know 
the new letters, and my handwriting in the old is very inadequate. Also, they 
do not allow me to meet with anyone; I am kept in what is quite simply soli-
tary conﬁnement. The indictment was even taken off me after ﬁfteen min-
utes. I also do not have the means to employ a lawyer. I was able to obtain 
only one copy of part of the defence I have presented to you, in the new let-
ters, secretly. I also had written out one or two copies of The Fruits of Belief, 
which is a sort of defence of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and a summary of its way, to 
give to the public prosecutor and to send to the departments of government 
in  Ankara.  They  suddenly  took  them  off  me  and  have  not  returned  them.

Whereas the judicial authorities in Eskişehir sent a typewriter to the prison 
for us. We wrote out one or two copies of our defences on it in the new let-
ters, and the court wrote them out as well. My urgent request, therefore, is 
either you supply us with a typewriter, or allow us to procure one outside 
so that we can type out in the new letters two or three copies of both our 
defences, and the treatise which is a sort of defence of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . We 
shall then send them to both the Ministry of Justice, and the Cabinet, and the 
National Assembly, and the Council of State. For it is the R i s a l e - i   N u r  that 
is the basis of the indictment, and the charges against the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and 
the objections to it are not some petty, personal matter so that no importance 
should be attached to them. On the contrary, it is a general matter of serious 
concern to the nation, country, and government, and will therefore arouse 
signiﬁcant attention in the Islamic world.

Yes, those who covertly attack the R i s a l e - i   N u r  are those who in order to 
destroy the regard, love, and brotherhood of the Islamic world, which is the 
greatest strength of this country’s people, and arouse loathing, are covertly 
establishing absolute disbelief by making politics the tool of irreligion. They 
have deceived the government and twice confused the legal establishment, 
saying: “ The R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its students exploit religion for politics and 
there is the possibility of their disturbing public order and security.

You  unfortunates!  The  R i s a l e - i   N u r   deﬁnitely  has  no  connection  with 
politics, but since it has smashed absolute disbelief, it destroys and repulses 
anarchy, which underlies absolute disbelief, and absolute despotism, which 
overlies it. One of the hundreds of proofs that it ensures public order, secu-
rity, freedom, and justice is T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f   (   M e y v e   R i s a l e s i   ) , which 
is  like  its  defence.  It  should  be  scrutinized  by  a  committee  of  prominent 
scholars and sociologists; if they do not conﬁrm what I say, I consent to any 
punishment or tortuous execution!

Three matters have been made the basis of the indictment:
T h e  F i r s t  is a political society. I cite as witnesses all the R i s a l e - i  N u r  stu-
dents here and those who have met with me, and those who read or write out 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r ; you may ask them. I have not said to anyone that we were 
going to set up a political society or a Naqshbandi association. I always told 

THE TWELFTH RAY

them that we were going to work to save belief. No society has been men-
tioned among us apart from the sacred community of Islam, which includes 
all  believers  and  has  more  than  three  hundred  million  members.  Through 
the brotherhood of all believers and because of our service of the Qur’an, we 
found ourselves in the Party of the Qur’an (   H i z b   a l - Q u r ’ a n   ) , which in the 
Qur’an is called the H i z b   A l l a h . If this is what is meant in the indictment, 
we admit to it wholeheartedly and with pride. But if something else is meant, 
we know nothing of it!

T h e   S e c o n d   M a t t e r :  As is stated in the indictment and conﬁrmed by the 
report  of  the  Kastamonu  police,  some  books  like  the  T r e a t i s e   o n   I s l a m i c  
D r e s s   (   Te s e t t ü r   R i s a l e s i   )  and T h e   S i x   A t t a c k s   (   H ü c u m a t - ı   S i t t e   )  and its 
addendum,  were  found  in  nailed  boxes  under  piles  of  ﬁrewood  and  coal 
in a condition that would in no way allow them to be published. They had 
been scrutinized and criticized by Eskişehir Court, a light sentence had been 
served for them, and they had most certainly been treated as private. Now, 
reading false meanings into some of their sentences, it wants to take us back 
nine years and charge us again with a crime the penalty of which we have 
already served.

T h e   T h i r d   M a t t e r :  In several places in the indictment, phrases have been 
used which express possibility rather than actual occurrences, like “ he may 
breach state security or he may harm it. ” It is possible for everyone to com-
mit murder, but are they to be charged with it due to the possibility?

Chairman of the Court!
I  present  my  defence,  which  is  in  the  form  of  a  petition  I  sent  to  the 
departments  of  government  in  Ankara  and  to  the  President,  and  the  reply 
from  the  Prime  Minister’s  Ofﬁce,  which  shows  that  they  recognized  its 
importance. Contained in this defence are decisive answers to the unfounded 
and offensive suspicions that the prosecution have levelled against us. There 
are numerous untrue and illogical things in the report of the committee of 
experts from here, which was based on the superﬁcial and malicious reports 
of other places; my objections to these too have been presented.

THE RAYS

I n   S h o r t :  As I stated before, I told Eskişehir Court when they wanted to 
convict me under Article 163: out of two hundred deputies of the republican 
government, the same number, 163, agreed to assign one hundred and ﬁfty 
thousand  liras  to  my  m e d r e s e   1  in  Van.  In  which  case,  the  government’s 
regard for me invalidates Article 163 as far as I am concerned. Although I 
told the court this, the committee of experts falsiﬁed what I said and wrote: 
“ 163 deputies opened proceedings against Said. ” It is because of this totally 
baseless  accusation  of  the  ﬁrst  experts’  committee  that  the  prosecution  is 
making charges against us. This is in spite of the fact that the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
had  been  referred,  on  your  decision,  to  the  highest  learned  and  scientiﬁc 
committee, and having studied and scrutinized all its parts, the committee 
unanimously  made  this  statement  about  us:  “ There  is  nothing  explicit  or 
inferred  in  the  writings  of  Said  and  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students  which  sug-
gests that they harbour any intentions to exploit religion or sacred matters, 
encourage  the  breaching  of  state  security,  or  to  found  a  political  society, 
or to conspire in any way against the government. It is understood that in 
their  correspondences,  Said’s  students  did  not  nurture  any  evil  intentions 
against the government, or have the idea of founding a political association, 
or establishing a Suﬁ order. ”

The second committee of experts also stated unanimously that “ ninety-
nine  per  cent  of  Said  Nursi’s  treatises  are  both  sincere,  and  disinterested, 
and have in no way departed from the principles of scholarship, reality, and 
religion. There is clearly nothing in them exploiting religion, or concerning 
the formation of a political society, or breaching security. The letters and 
correspondence between the students and between them and Said Nursi are 
of this sort. Apart from ﬁve or ten conﬁdential, complaining, and unschol-
arly pieces, all the treatises expound Qur’anic verses or the true meanings 
of Hadiths. Ninety per cent of the available treatises contain comparisons 
illustrating clearly the tenets of belief in Allah, the Prophet, and the hereaf-
ter and their terminology, scholarly views, moral admonitions to the elderly 
and to youths, and instructive incidents selected from his experiences in life. 
They contain nothing which could damage the government, administration, 
or public security.

Thus, the prosecution ignored the report of this eminent committee and 
made extraordinary charges against us based on the confused, deﬁcient ﬁrst 
report, so we are truly extremely upset. We in no way deem it ﬁtting for this 
just court with its proven fairness. If there be no mistake in the comparison, 

1.  See, page 483, footnote 69.

it  resembles  this  story:  they  asked  a  Bektaşi  why  he  did  not  perform  the 
obligatory prayers. He told them: “  It says in the Qur’an 
 x w v 
( 4:43 )   ” When they reminded him that the verse continued z y   
he told them: “ I have not memorized the whole Qur’an. ” They take a single 
sentence from the R i s a l e - i  N u r , and disregarding what follows it, which puts 
it in context and explains it, use it against us. Thirty to forty examples of 
this are to be seen in the defence I shall present, when comparing it with the 
indictment. I shall recount a subtle incident which is one of those examples:
The prosecution in Eskişehir Court used a phrase about the R i s a l e - i  N u r ’s 
instruction in belief that was anyway the result of an error, like “ it corrupts 
the people. ” Although it later did not use it, one of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students 
called Abdürrezzaq, said a year after the trial:

“ You unfortunate! The R i s a l e - i   N u r  has received the indirect praise of 
thirty-three Qur’anic verses, its value for religion has been established by 
three miraculous predictions of Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) 
and the powerful allusions of Gawth al-A‘zam ( May his mystery be sanc-
tiﬁed ); these twenty years it has caused the government no trouble what-
soever,  and  besides  not  harming  anyone  at  all,  has  illumined  and  guided 
thousands of the sons of this land, and strengthened their belief and rectiﬁed 
their conduct, and yet you call that guidance ‘corruption.’ You have no fear 
of Allah! May your tongue be cursed! ”

Now, the prosecution has seen these words of that student, so I refer to 
your fairness and conscience the expression: “ Said has spread corruption. ”
With the idea of interfering in the social teachings of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
the prosecution said: “ The place of religion is the conscience; it cannot be 
tied to laws and regulations. Formerly there was social unrest because it was 
tied to laws. ” So I say: “ Religion does not consist only of belief; its second 
half is righteous action. Is fear of imprisonment or being seen by a govern-
ment detective sufﬁcient to deter the perpetrators of numerous grievous sins 
which poison society, like murder, adultery, theft, gambling, and drinking? 
If that were so, there would have to be a policeman or detective stationed 
permanently  in  every  house,  or  at  everyone’s  side  even,  so  that  obdurate 
souls would restrain themselves from those ﬁlthy acts. Whereas, in respect 
of good deeds and belief, the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  places a permanent immaterial 
prohibitor next to everyone. It easily saves them from bad deeds by recalling 
the prison of Hell and divine wrath.

318

THE RAYS

Also, due to the signature in one treatise of a wonderful and extra-ordi-
nary coincidence, the prosecution made a meaningless inference, saying “ the 
members of a political society. ” Are the holders of signatures of this sort in 
the account books of tradesmen and innkeepers called a society. There was a 
similar baseless accusation in Eskişehir Court. When I replied and told them 
about the treatise called T h e   M i r a c l e s   o f   M u h a m m a d   (   U W B P   ) , they were 
astonished. If we had formed a worldly society, the people who had suffered 
so much harm on my account would certainly have ﬂed in total abhorrence. 
This means that just as I and we have a relationship with Imam al-Ghazali 
which is not broken off because it pertains to the hereafter not to this world; 
so these innocent, sincere, pure religious people have displayed a powerful 
attachment to an unfortunate like myself for the sake of his teachings about 
belief. This has given rise to unfounded suspicions of an imaginary political 
society. My last word is:

An Important Part of My Final Word

Sirs! Chairman of the Court! Take note!
Since to convict the R i s a l e - i  N u r  and its students is the equivalent of con-
victing the truths of the Qur’an and belief, it is to try to close up  – directly 
on  account  of  absolute  disbelief –  the  highway  taken  every  year  for  one 
thousand  three  hundred  years  by  three  hundred  million  Muslims,  leading 
to reality and the happiness of both worlds, and it will attract towards your-
self  their  revulsion  and  objections.  For  those  on  the  highway  assist  with 
their prayers and good works those who have already passed down it. To 
convict  them  will  also  contribute  to  a  doomsday  breaking  forth  over  this 
blessed  country.  What  answer  will  you  give  at  the  Last  Judgement  when 
you  are  asked  in  the  face  of  those  three  hundred  thousand  million  claim-
ants: “ You did not interfere with the French work by Doctor Dozy called 
Ta r i h - i   I s l a m ,  which from beginning to end attacks Islam, your country and 
your religion, nor with the works of atheists in your libraries and their free

availability, nor with the students of those books who formed themselves 
into illegal societies, nor with the societies who opposed your politics like 
the communists, anarchists, the old revolutionary societies, or the negative 
Turkists;  so  why  have  you  interfered  with  the  readers  of  a  work  of  truth 
and reality like the R i s a l e - i   N u r , a true commentary on the Qur’an, and its 
students, who have no connection with politics whatsoever and have taken 
the  highway  of  the  Qur’an  and  belief  solely  to  save  themselves  and  their 
fellow-countrymen from eternal annihilation and solitary conﬁnement? And 
why have you called the friendship and brotherhood of those sincerely reli-
gious people which looks only to the hereafter, a political society? You have 
convicted them under a bizarre law, and that is what you wanted. ” We ask 
you the same thing. Our enemies, the atheists and dissemblers, deceive you, 
confuse the judiciary, and busy the government with us in a way detrimental 
to  the  country  and  people;  by  calling  absolute  despotism  “ the  republic, ” 
and making absolute apostasy part of the regime, and calling absolute vice 
“ civilization, ” and attaching the name of “ the law ” to arbitrary force and 
compulsion on account of disbelief, they both preoccupy the government, 
and have scattered us, thus dealing blows on account of the Europeans at the 
supremacy of Islam and the country and people.

Sirs! As is indicated by the four severe earthquakes in four years coincid-
ing exactly with the severe aggression against the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students and 
their being persecuted, and on each occasion their occurring exactly at the 
time the students were attacked and their stopping when the attacks ceased, 
you are responsible for the heavenly and earthly disasters that have occurred 
on our being convicted!

and astonished at your insisting on this point to this degree, this meaning 
occurred to me: since friendship, fraternal communities and assemblies, and 
sincere  associations  pertaining  to  the  hereafter  and  brotherhood  are  each 
both foundation stones of social life, and an essential need of human nature, 
and a most necessary bond of great strength between people, from the life 
of  the  family  to  that  of  tribe,  nation,  Islam,  and  humanity,  and  a  point  of 
support and means of consolation in the face of the assaults of the material 
and  immaterial  things  which  cause  harm  and  alarm  and  which  each  per-
son encounters in the universe and cannot combat on his own, and which 
prevent him carrying out his human and Islamic duties; and since there are 
some  who  give  the  name  of  political  society,  although  it  has  no  political 
front, to the gathering together of the students of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  around 
the teachings of belief, which is most praiseworthy and is sincere friendship 
centred on the teachings of belief and the Qur’an and certainly leads to hap-
piness in this world and in religion and in the hereafter, and is a companion-
ship on the way of truth, and co-operation; most certainly and without any 
doubt, they have either been deceived in some appalling manner, or they are 
extremely vicious anarchists who are both barbarously inimical to humanity, 
and tyrannically hostile to Islam, and harbour enmity towards society in the 
utterly corrupt and depraved manner of anarchy, and strive obdurately and 
intractably as apostates against this country and nation, the sovereignty of 
Islam and sacred things of religion, or they are satanic atheists who, work-
ing on behalf of foreigners to cut and destroy the life-giving arteries of this 
nation, are deceiving the government and confusing the legal establishment 
in order to destroy or turn against our brothers and our country the immate-
rial weapons which up to now we have used against them – those satans, 
pharaohs, and anarchists.

The Correct Answer to an Important Question

Several high-ranking ofﬁcials asked me: “ Why did you not accept Mus-
tafa  Kemal’s  offer  of  a  three-hundred-lira  salary  and  the  post  of  general 
preacher in Kurdistan and the Eastern Provinces in place of Shaykh Sanusi? 
1  If  you  had  accepted  it,  you  would  have  been  instrumental  in  saving  the 
lives of the hundred thousand people who were slaughtered because of the 
revolution. ”

I told them in reply: the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which has been the means of gain-
ing for hundreds of thousands of our fellow-countrymen millions of years 
of  life  in  the  hereafter,  has  performed  that  task  a  thousand  times  over,  in 
place of twenty or thirty years of worldly life I was unable to save for those 
people. If I had accepted the offer, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  would not have come 
into being, which can be the tool of nothing nor follow anything and holds 
the mystery of sincerity. I even told my respected brothers in prison: if those 
who have sought my execution because of the heavy blows of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r , which was sent to Ankara, save their belief through the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
and are delivered from eternal annihilation, you bear witness that I forgive 
them with all my life and soul!

I told those who were pestering me with their surveillance in Denizli after 
our acquittal, and the high-ranking ofﬁcials and police chief and inspectors: 
It is an undeniable wonder of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  that in nine months of close 
investigations no document has been found or connection of any kind with 
any movement, association, or society here or abroad, in the twenty years 
of my life of oppression, or in the hundreds of my treatises and letters, or 
among  my  thousands  of  students.  Could  this  extraordinary  situation  have 
been  achieved  by  the  power  of  thought  or  through  some  arrangement?  If 
the private concerns of one person over a number of years are brought to 
light, certainly there would be twenty matters to embarass or convict him.

Since  the  fact  is  this,  you  will  say  either  that  some  brilliant  undefeatable 
genius is organizing the matter, or that it is a truly muniﬁcent divine preser-
vation. It would surely be an error to contest such a genius. It would cause 
great harm to the country and people. While to oppose such divine preserva-
tion and dominical grace would be pharaoh-like obduracy.

I f   y o u   s a y :  “ If we release you and do not keep you under surveillance, 
you may contaminate the life of our society with your teachings and obstruse 
mysteries. ”

I   r e p l y :  All my teachings without exception have been seen by the gov-
ernment  and  judicial  authorities,  and  no  matter  has  been  found  requiring 
even  one  day’s  penalty.  Forty  to  ﬁfty  thousand  copies  of  those  teachings 
have  been  passed  from  hand  to  hand,  being  studied  attentively  and  with 
curiosity, yet the readers have only beneﬁted, no one has suffered any harm. 
Also, since both the former court and the present court could ﬁnd no indict-
able offences, it is an ugly and meaningless injustice for you to interfere with 
our acquittal granted unanimously by the new court, and with me and the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , as is proved decisively by the former court only being able to 
give sentences of six months each to ﬁfteen out of one hundred and twenty 
of my brothers who were being held in prison, only arbitrarily and on the 
pretext of ﬁve or ten words out of one hundred and thirty treatises, for the 
sake of an important personage in the eyes of the world. Moreover, I have 
no new teachings and none of my secrets have remained hidden so that you 
should try to modify them through supervision.

I am now very much in need of my freedom. Enough now of the unnec-
essary, unjust, and meaningless surveillance to which I have been subjected 
these twenty years. My patience is exhausted. There is the possibility that 
due to old age I shall utter the curses that up to now I have refrained from 
uttering. “ The sighs of the oppressed rise to the divine throne ”1 is a power-
ful truth.

Then those tyrannical wretches who occupy high places in the eyes of 
the world said: “ Not once in twenty years have you worn our headgear; you 
have not uncovered your head in the presence of either the former court or 
the present courts; you have presented yourself in the former attire. Whereas 
seventeen  million  have  taken  to  modern  dress. ”  So  I  replied:  rather  than 
wearing through a dispensation of the Shari‘a and under the constraint of the 
law, the dress, not of seventeen million or even seven million, but with their

own  consent  and  sincere  acceptance  of  seven  thousand  European-smitten 
drunkards, I prefer to wear, in conformity with the Shari‘a and fear of Allah, 
the dress of seven thousand million. It may not be said of someone like me 
who  for  twenty-ﬁve  years  has  withdrawn  from  social  life  “ he  obstinately 
opposes us. ” Even if it was obstinacy, since Mustafa Kemal could not break 
it, and two courts could not break it, and the authorities of three provinces 
could not smash it, who are you to struggle pointlessly to break that obsti-
nacy  to  the  harm  of  both  the  nation  and  the  government!  Even  if  he  was 
a  political  opponent,  since  as  you  have  conﬁrmed,  he  has  severed  all  his 
connections with the world these last twenty years and has in effect been 
dead, he would not be again raised to life, meaninglessly become involved 
in political life causing himself considerable harm, and struggle against you; 
it is therefore lunacy to have groundless fears about his opposing you. Since 
it is a lunacy to even speak seriously with lunatics, I am giving up speak-
ing with people like you. I said: “ Whatever you do, I won’t feel obliged to 
you! ”, which both angered them, and silenced them. My ﬁnal word is:

What I Said This Time in My Short Defence

The compasssion, reality, and truth of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  prevents us from 
involvement in politics. For innocents are afﬂicted with calamities and we 
would have been unjust towards to them. Some people wanted an explana-
tion of this, and I told them:

In  the  present  stormy  century,  the  egotism  and  racialism  proceeding 
from  cruel  civilization,  and  the  military  dictatorships  resulting  from  the 
Great War, and the pitilessness arising from misguidance have led to such 
extreme tyranny and excessive despotisms that if the people of truth defend 
their rights through physical force, or through severe tyranny, numerous 
unfortunates  will  be  scorched  on  the  pretext  of  partisanship,  and  in  that 
situation, they too will be excessively tyrannical and will be defeated. For 
those who act and attack out of the above feelings, on some petty pretext, 
strike at twenty to thirty people because of the mistakes of one or two, and 
destroy them. If on the way of truth and justice, the people of truth strike 
only at the one who struck, they win only one in the face of thirty losses, 

324

THE RAYS

and are then in a position of defeat. If, in accordance with the unjust rule 
of responding in kind, the people of truth also crush twenty to thirty people 
due to the errors of one or two, they will then perpetrate a ghastly injustice 
in the name of right.

This  then  is  the  true  reason  for  our  having  strenuously  avoided  poli-
tics and interfering in government, and for our aversion towards it. For the 
power of truth we have at our disposal is such that we could have defended 
our  rights  completely.  But  since  everything  is  transitory  and  passing,  and 
death does not die, and the door of the grave does not close, and if one suf-
fers hardship, it is transformed into mercy; we shall surely place our trust 
in Allah in patience and gratitude, and be silent. To forcibly and harmfully 
break  our  silence  is  totally  opposed  and  contrary  to  justice,  fairness,  and 
patriotic zeal and endeavour.

T o   C o n c l u d e :   The  members  of  the  government,  the  politicians,  the 
administrators, the police, and the judiciary have nothing at all over which 
to struggle with us. At the most, through the bigotry of absolute unbelief, 
which no government in the world can defend and no one in their senses 
likes,  and  the  bigotry  of  atheism,  which  arises  from  materialism  and  is  a 
fearsome plague afﬂicting humanity, and through their evil, certain covert 
atheists deceive a number of government ofﬁcials, excite their suspicions, 
and incite them against us. And we say: if they incited not a few suspicious 
people like that but the whole world against us, through the strength of the 
Qur’an  and  divine  grace,  we  would  not  ﬂee;  we  would  not  lay  down  our 
arms before that apostasizing absolute disbelief and that atheism!

you, I love Isparta and its environs down to its very stones and soil. I declare 
even, and I shall say so ofﬁcially, if the Isparta authorities were to inﬂict 
some penalty on me and another province was to acquit me, I would still 
choose here.

Yes,  I  am  from  Isparta  in  three  respects.  I  cannot  prove  it  genealogi-
cally, but I have the conviction that the forebears of Said, who came into the 
world in the sub-district of İsparit, went there from here. And the province of 
Isparta has given me such true brothers that I would be happy to sacriﬁce not 
Abdülmecid 1 and Abdurrahman, 2 but Said [ myself ] for each one of them.
It is my guess that there is no one on earth at this time who suffers less 
-in their hearts, spirits, and minds- than the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students. For due 
to the lights of certain, realized belief, their hearts, spirits, and minds suffer 
no distress. As for physical hardships, they know from the teachings of the 
R i s a l e - i  N u r  that they are both transitory, and unimportant, and yield reward, 
and are a means by which the service of belief unfolds in other channels, 
and so meet them with thanks and patience. They prove through their states 
of  mind  that  certain,  realized  belief  leads  to  happiness  in  this  world  too. 
Yes, they say “ Let’s see what Allah does, whatever He does, it is good, ” 
and steadfastly work to transform these transient difﬁculties into permanent 
instances of mercy.

May the Most Merciful of the Merciful increase the numbers of those like 
them, make them the cause of pride and happiness for this country, and grant 
them eternal happiness in Paradise. Amen!

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
In regard to this divinely ordained event from the point of view of the jus-
tice of divine determining: because some of the new students sought worldly 
things  by  means  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  which  were  not  in  keeping  with  the 
true meaning of sincerity, they found themselves confronted by self-seeking 
rivals, and obtaining from somewhere a long way off from me the Fifth Ray, 

1.  Abdülmecid ( d.1967 ) was Bediuzzaman’s younger brother. He was a teacher of 
the religious sciences, then a mufti. He translated parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  into Arabic, and 
others from Arabic into Turkish. [ Tr. ]

2.  Abdurrahman ( 1903-1928 ) was the son of Bediuzzaman’s elder brother, Abdul-
lah. He was Bediuzzaman’s “ spiritual son, student, and assistant, ” and joined his uncle 
in Istanbul after the First World War. He published a short biography of Bediuzzaman at 
that time. [ Tr. ]

years copies of which have only twice come into my possession and were

the arrival of copies of it, it was reported to the government, and the two 
matters were confused. Suggesting the Fifth Ray had been printed in oppo-
sition to the Civil Code, some malicious people made a mountain out of a 
molehill and had us put away in this place of penitence. Nevertheless, divine 
determining drove us here for our own good; it called us again to the School 
of Joseph, where, being far more meritorious than the places of ordeal of 
former times, we could receive a thorough lesson in sincerity and rectify our 
attachment to the affairs of this world, which in truth are valueless.

We  say  in  the  face  of  the  unfounded  suspicions  of  the  worldly:  from 
beginning to end the Seventh Ray (   T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n   )  is about belief; you 
have been deceived; it is completely different to the Fifth Ray, which has 
been held strictly private and was not found in my possession in any of the 
scrupulous searches, and was originally written twenty years ago. We did 
not agree to show it to anyone at the present time, let alone have it printed; it 
nevertheless is a veriﬁed prediction, and does not contest anything.

I again congratulate you on the festival; do not be sorry that we could 
not meet in person. In truth we are always together, and Allah willing this 
togetherness will continue on the road to eternity. It is my opinion that the 
eternal merits, and the virtues and joys of the spirit and heart that you obtain 
in serving belief reduce to nothing the present temporary, passing sorrows 
and hardships. Up to now, there has been no one who has suffered as few 
difﬁculties as the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students in such sacred service. Yes, Paradise 
is not cheap. To save others from absolute disbelief, which destroys the life 
of both this world and the hereafter, is of the very greatest importance at this 
time. If there is a little hardship, it should be met with enthusiasm, thanks, 
and patience. Since our Creator, Who employs us, is All-Compassionate and 
Wise, we should rely on His mercy and wisdom and meet everything with 
resignation and joy.

An heroic brother of ours has assumed all responsibility for T h e   S u p r e m e  
S i g n  affair. He has shown how much he deserves the extraordinary honour 
and merit pertaining to the hereafter he has gained through his pen and the 
H i z b   a l - Q u r ’ a n   1 and H i z b   a l - N u r i ,   2 and made me weep at the deep joy I

more. This we await from divine mercy.

steadfastness, and intercession.

At  a  time  when,  under  the  effects  of  this  event,  I  determined  to  com-
pletely resign myself to sacriﬁcing myself for my innocent brothers and was 
seeking for a solution, I read J a l j a l u t i y y a .  3 It suddenly occurred to me that 
Imam  ‘Ali  ( May  Allah  be  pleased  with  him )  prayed:  “ O  Allah!  Deliver

plication.

Yes,  in  his  Q a ṣ ī d a   a l - J a l j a l ū t i y y a ,  Imam  ‘Ali  ( May  Allah  be  pleased

Allah to deliver the students from the calamity for the sake of T h e   S u p r e m e

of  T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n  was made the pretext for the calamity that occurred,

Also, on the opposite page in the qasida, it says at the end of the allusions 
to the important parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and their arrangement, in meaning:

My Dear, Loyal Brother, Re’fet Bey!
I  cannot  meet  with  indifference  your  learned  questions  since  they  are 
the keys to important truths contained in the part of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  called 
M e k t û b a t  ( Letters ). A short answer is as follows:

Since the Qur’an is a pre-eternal address and speaks with all the classes 
of  humanity  and  all  the  groups  of  worshippers,  it  has  to  possess  numer-
ous  meanings  conformable  with  them,  and  numerous  levels  of  the  uni-
versal  meanings.  Some  commentators  choose  only  the  most  general  or 
the  most  explicit  meaning,  or  one  which  expresses  an  obligatory  act  or  a 
conﬁrmed  practice  of  the  Prophet  ( UWBP ).  For  example,  for  the  verse, 
( 52:49 )   \ [ Z they  mention  an  important  Sunna,  the  two  rak‘as 
of the tahajjud prayer, and for the verse á à  the early morning F a j r  
S u n n a , which is a conﬁrmed Practice of the Prophet ( UWBP ). And there are 
numerous other constituents of the former meaning. My brother! Speaking 
with you does not cease.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
I have just performed the noon prayer and it occurred to me when I was

and your relations at home. It suddenly came to mind that if the people of 
former times who chose the hereafter over this world and passed their lives

mortifying the ﬂesh in caves and other places of ordeal with the intention of 
being saved from the sins of society and of working sincerely for the here-
after, had lived now, they would have been R i s a l e - i   N u r  students. Certainly, 
those  living  under  present  conditions  are  ten  times  more  needy  than  they 
were and gain ten times more merit, and are ten times more comfortable.

My Dear, Blessed Brothers!
Very many greetings... In former times in my native region, we used to 
recite Sura al-Ikhlas a thousand times on the Day of ‘Arafa.  1 Now, I am 
able to recite ﬁve hundred on the day before, and ﬁve hundred on the Day 
of ‘Arafa. Those who are conﬁdent may recite them all at once. I cannot see 
you and cannot speak with you all personally, but most of the time I can 
converse with you all while praying, sometimes by name.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
I reckon that up to now two leaders of the main group of the Light (   N u r   )  
Factory  circle  have  been  saved.  That  circle,  that  group,  has  truly  accom-
plished the triumphs of twenty to thirty years in six or seven; as though it 
was a souvenir of their shining pens, their service does not cease; it causes 
merits to be recorded in the books of their deeds in their places. In fact, the 
H i z b - i   N u r i   has  achieved  such  overwhelming  conquests  and  entered  such 
important places that it is as if those who published it are continuously work-
ing. I supposed that like the ﬁrst person, Hafız Mustafa, who has worked so 
hard and is so hardworking, was outside, then I heard that he is here too. 
Thinking it was perhaps another Mustafa, I found consolation.

This  morning  while  reciting  the  t e s b i h a t ,  I  pitied  Hafız  Tevﬁk.  2  I

denly occurred to me: Congratulate him! With needless caution, he wanted 
to withdraw himself a little from his important position and his large share

in  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r .  But  the  vastness  and  sacredness  of  his  service  again 
awarded him a large share and vast merit. One should not ﬂee from spiritual 
honour such as that due to a little distress and ﬂeeting hardship.

Yes,  my  brothers!  Everything  departs,  and  after  it  has  gone,  if  it  was 
pleasure and enjoyment, it goes for nothing, while if it was distress and hard-
ship, it yields such pleasurable beneﬁts, both in this world and in the here-
after, and from the point of view of being sacred service, that it reduces the 
trouble to nothing. With the exception of one of you, I am the most elderly 
and it is I who suffers the most troubles, yet I assure you that by practising 
total patience, offering thanks, and endurance, I am happy at my situation. 
Thanks in the face of disaster is for the reward to be had from disaster, and 
for the beneﬁts in this world and the next.

My Dear Brothers!
With  the  disappearance  of  the  things  preventing  the  completion  of  the 
Topics of T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f , writing will recommence, Allah willing. One 
of these was the cold, the other was the fright the Masons took at its power. 
I think of this calamity from the angle of divine determining, and my dif-
ﬁculties are transformed into mercy. Yes, as is explained in the Tr e a t i s e   o n  
D i v i n e   D e t e r m i n i n g , there are two causes for every event: one is apparent; 
people base their judgements on this and frequently act unjustly. The other 
is reality, according to which divine determining judges; it acts with justice 
in the events in which a person acted unjustly.

For example, a man is sent to prison for a theft he did not commit. divine 
determining also sentences him to imprisonment, but for a secret crime, and 
acts  justly  within  the  human  injustice.  Thus,  there  are  two  causes  for  our 
having been set this severe trial, the purpose of which is to separate out the 
diamonds from the pieces of glass, the veracious devotees from the incon-
stant  waverers,  and  the  purely  sincere  from  those  unable  to  give  up  their 
egotism and self-interest:

T h e   F i r s t  is a powerful solidarity and a sincere and remarkable service 
of religion which aroused the suspicions of the worldly and the politicians; 
human injustice looks to this.

T h e   S e c o n d :   Since  not  everyone  on  their  own  could  demonstrate  their 
worthiness of this sacred service through complete sincerity and total soli-
darity, divine determining looked to this too. But that Determining is now 
pure mercy for us within the pure justice, for it brought together brothers 

THE THIRTEENTH RAY

333

who greatly missed each other, and transformed their hardships into worship 
and their losses into almsgiving. It is also pure mercy in many other respects, 
like attracting attention from all quarters to the treatises the brothers have 
written out; and not allowing worldly possessions and children and comfort, 
which are temporary, ﬂeeting and which one day they will be bound to leave 
behind when they enter the grave, to damage their lives in the hereafter; and 
accustoming them to patient endurance; and their being heroic models for 
the believers of the future, and even their leaders. But there is one aspect 
that caused me some thought, which is that if a ﬁnger is wounded, the eye, 
mind, and heart neglect their important duties and become preoccupied with 
it. Similarly, our lives, which reach this pitch of distress, busy our hearts and 
spirits with their wounds. Then just when I should be forgetting the world, 
the situation took me to the Masons’ council, and busied me with dealing 
them  blows.  I  was  consoled  by  the  possibility  that  Almighty  Allah  might 
accept this state of heedlessness as a sort of intellectual striving.

I  received  the  greetings  of  Ali  Gül,  the  brother  of  Hafız  Mehmed,  the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s esteemed teacher. I send greetings and prayers both to him, 
and to all his fellow villagers, and to all the people of Sava, 1 both living and

Your constancy and steadfastness foil all the plans of the Masons and dis-

comparisons between the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its students and the Suﬁ orders

They attacked us with the same weapons they used against the Naqshbandis 
and  Suﬁs,  but  they  were  deceived.  For  since  the  essence  of  the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r ’s way is complete sincerity, and the giving up of egotism, and to search 
out and perceive the mercy within difﬁculties and the permanent pleasures 
within  pains,  and  to  point  out  the  grievous  pains  within  ﬂeeting  dissolute 
pleasures, and that belief is the means to innumerable pleasures in this world 
too, and to teach the points and truths that the hand of no philosophy can 
reach, Allah willing it will make all their plans come to nothing, and show-
ing that no comparison can be made between the way of the R i s a l e - i  N u r  and 
the Suﬁ orders, it will silence them utterly.

A Subtle Point

This morning someone called me from the gendarmes’ ward next to me 
and I went to the window. He said: “ Our door has closed by itself and what-
ever we do we can’t open it. ” So I told him: “ It is a sign for you that among 
the people you guard and keep behind bars, are those who are innocent like 
yourselves. They even insulted me on the pretext of my seeing one of my 
brothers I had not seen for ten years, and on another pretext, closed the sec-
ond of our outer doors. As a punishment, your door closed too. ”

* * *

S a i d   N u r s i

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
There are three further points concerning the subtle point I wrote to you 

yesterday:

The First: As a representative of the collective personality of a blessed 
group that will be formed in the future, through the blessings of that collec-
tive personality, the bolted door opened of its own accord; again, they were 
angry  with  a  representative  of  a  blessed  group  which  is  now  in  existence 
meeting with me for half a minute, after ten years. I too was angered, and 
again said: “ Let the doors close! ” The following morning -it had never hap-
pened before- the guards’ doors closed, and did not open for two hours.

Second Elegant Point: I sent a note to the public prosecutor by means 
of the prison governor. I said in it: “ I am being kept in isolation and I can’t 
meet with anyone. Even if I was to, I do not know anyone in this town. ... 
with someone from the town council here... and so on. ” Later the prosecu-
tor asked if I was in solitary conﬁnement. The prison governor said: “ No. ” 
Both of them objected to my note. The same day, a distant and half crazy 
relation came and visited me for half a minute, and it was portrayed in such 

THE THIRTEENTH RAY

335

a way as to show that I had never been in solitary conﬁnement. Their objec-
tions rebounded on themselves.

The Third: The noise of the troublesome youths next door to me between 
the evening and night prayers disturbed me, but not too much. It was that 
day that they found an excuse and shut the door. The foul stench also grew 
worse  in  my  cell,  and  the  din  the  youths  made  by  my  door  disturbed  me 
excessively. I again said: “ Let the doors close! Why are they doing this? ” 
That morning, the incident occurred.

* * *

My Brothers!
The two Topics you have written in the new letters have had a tremen-
dous effect. It will be excellent if the First, Second, and Third Topics are 
written out as well. But I ﬁnd it worrying if it is Husrev and Tahiri who are 
writing them out since their pens are particularly suited to the Qur’an and the 
Qur’anic script, and are charged with it. It will be better if others write them.

My Dear Brothers!
For the past year I have been using an amount, that is, around a kilo, of 
vermicelli and rice. I have no doubt that they are a means of plenty. But now 
you do not allow me to cook them, so I give them to you as a gift, as a means 
to blessings and plenty. On one occasion, I saw a wondrous increase in the 
star-shaped vermicelli. I used to dry the pieces after cooking them. I myself 
and others saw that one single piece was ten times larger than normal.

My Dear Brothers!
Last  night  while  I  was  reciting  my  invocations,  the  guards  and  others 
could  hear  me.  I  wondered  anxiously  to  myself  if  such  a  display  did  not 
decrease the merit. Then I remembered a famous saying of H u j j a t   a l - I s l a m   
Imam al-Ghazali: “ Sometimes doing something openly is better than con-
cealing  it. ”  That  is,  in  many  ways  it  may  be  far  more  meritorious  to  do 
something openly, for others may beneﬁt from it, or copy it, or be aroused 
from heedlessness; or it may display the marks of Islam in the face of those

Especially at this time and if done by those who have learnt thoroughly the 
lessons of sincerity, and no hidden artiﬁciality intervenes. I thought of this 
and was consoled.

THE RAYS

Two days ago, the examining magistrate summoned me, and when won-
dering how I could defend my brothers, I opened the H i z b  a l - M a ṣ ū n  of Imam 
al-Ghazali. These verses struck my eye:

    ( 66:8 ) ...B A @ ? >    ( 22:38 ) ...Ô Ó Ò Ñ Ð Ï 
   ( 13:29 ) ...& %    ( 42:6 ) ...Y X W 
( 66:8 ) ...I H G F E D  
I saw that if the doubling and m a d d a  ( long ā ) are not counted -the w a w  
is also a m a d d a - according to a b j a d  and j a f r  reckoning, it makes one thou-
sand  three  hundred  and  sixty-two,  which  is  exactly  this  year’s  date;  both 
its meaning and number coincide with the time we resolved to defend our 
believing brothers. All praise be to Allah, I said, this leaves no need for my 
defence. Then the thought “ I wonder how it will turn out ” occurred to me. I 
was curious. I saw that according to j a f r  reckoning, on condition the t a n w i n  
is  counted,  the  two  phrases Y X W  and & %  make  exactly 
one thousand three hundred and sixty-two. If one m a d d a  is not counted, it 
makes two, and if it is counted, three. Coinciding exactly -at this time we are 
so needy for divine preservation- with this year’s date, and with next year’s 
date, it consoles us with the assurance that we shall be preserved, despite an 
awesome assault against us which has been prepared over the last year on a 
grand scale and over a wide ﬁeld. The R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s making more brilliant 
conquests in ruling circles due to this episode means that its temporary arrest 
does not and should not cause us to despair. Also I consider T h e   S u p r e m e  
S i g n ’s being conﬁscated due to its printing to be a proclamation, attracting 
attention from all quarters to its shining station. I have just read the verse,

( 66:8 ) ... I H G F E D
The phrase I H makes exactly one thousand three hundred and sixty-
two. It coincides exactly with this year’s date, and summons us and orders 
us to constantly seek forgiveness so that our light may be completed and the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  too not remain deﬁcient.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
It  is  my  opinion  that  those  who  are  not  shaken  by  the  severe  ordeal 
of these two Schools of Joseph,  1 the former and the present, and do not 
abandon its lessons, and do not give up being its students although their 
mouths  have  been  burnt  by  the  scalding  soup,  and  whose  morale  is  not 
broken despite all this aggression, will be applauded by the people of real-
ity  and  coming  generations;  just  as  the  angels  and  spirit  beings  applaud 
them. However, the physical distress is excessive since some of you are 
ill, delicate, or poor. But thinking of the others of you consoling them and 
being  perfect  examples  in  patience  and  good  conduct,  and  compassion-
ate brothers offering solidarity and kind attention, and intelligent compan-
ions in discussing lessons, and mirrors reﬂecting ﬁne moral qualities, thus 
reducing the physical hardships to nothing, I felt consoled concerning you, 
whom I love more than my own spirit.

One day, I shall send you Mawlana Khalid’s j u b b a , 2 which is one hun-
dred and twenty years old. I invest each of you with it in his name, in the 
same way that he invested me with it. I shall send it whenever you want it.

When we ﬁrst arrived, the doctor gave me a chickenpox vaccination. It 
formed a boil and my arm swelled up. The swelling has moved down my 
arm; it prevents me sleeping and makes it difﬁcult to take ablutions. Perhaps 
vaccinations  don’t  agree  with  me,  or  it  has  some  other  meaning!  Twenty 
years ago they vaccinated me in Ankara and it still suppurates from time to 
time and causes me pain. I thought of this and hoped the new one would not 
be the same; how are yours?

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
One reason for the justice of divine determining driving us to the Deni-
zli School of Joseph is both its prisoners, and its people, and perhaps also 
its ofﬁcials and judiciary being in greater need of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its 
students than people anywhere else. It is because of this that we have been 
put to this arduous test, with a task pertaining to belief and the hereafter.

Only one or two prisoners out of twenty to thirty performed the obligatory 
prayers  as  they  should  be  performed;  but  following  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   stu-
dents, forty to ﬁfty without exception have begun to perform them perfectly; 
this is such instruction and guidance through the tongue of disposition and 
action that it reduces to nothing the distress and hardship; indeed, it makes 
one love it. We hope from divine mercy and grace that just as the students 
have taught this through their actions, so through the powerful true belief in 
their hearts, they will become like a fortress of steel, delivering the believers 
from the doubts and suspicions of the people of misguidance.

The worldly here preventing us from speaking and having contact causes 
no harm. The tongue of disposition is more powerful and effective than ver-
bal speech. Since imprisonment is for training and education, if they love 
the nation, they should allow the prisoners to meet with the R i s a l e - i   N u r  stu-
dents so that in one month or even a day, they may receive more training and 
education than they would otherwise receive in a year, and may all become 
persons beneﬁcial both to the nation and country, and useful for their own 
futures and their lives in the hereafter. It would have been very useful if we 
had had A   G u i d e   F o r   Yo u t h  here. Allah willing, it will be brought in.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
Today  I  recalled  the  conversation  between  my  elder  brother,  Molla 
Abdullah, and Hazret Ziyaeddin, which you know about. Then I thought of 
you and said to myself: if the Unseen were to be revealed, if each of these 
sincerely religious and earnest Muslims who display such constancy in these 
inconstant times, not being shaken by these torturous, testing circumstances, 
were to appear to be saints or even spiritual poles, the importance they have 
in my view and my concern for them would increase very little; or if they 
were to appear to be commonplace and ordinary, the value I attach to them 
would in no way diminish. For the task of saving belief under such extremely 
severe conditions is of greater worth than everything. In such stormy, unsta-
ble conditions, the virtues afforded by personal ranks and the good opinions 
of others dissolve when those good opinions are destroyed, and their love 
lessens. The one possessing the virtues then feels himself obliged to adopt 
artiﬁcial manners, empty formalities, and a burdensome dignity in order to 
preserve his position in their eyes. Endless thanks be to Allah, we have no 
need for cold artiﬁciality such as that.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
I congratulate you with all my spirit, heart, and mind on your Ten Nights, 
and  beseech  divine  mercy  that  they  will  bring  great  gains  to  our  spiritual 
partnership. Last night I dreamt that I had come to you and awoke when I 
was about to lead the prayers as i m a m . When, according to my experience, 
the dream was going to be interpreted, two of our brothers from among the 
heroes of Sava and Homa arrived in the name of all you to interpret it. I was 
overjoyed, as though I had seen all of you.

My Brothers! Certainly, the situation has caused some ofﬁcials and others 
to withdraw from the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and has scared them, but it has aroused 
the attention of, and a longing in, all opponents and religiously minded peo-
ple  and  ofﬁcials  connected  with  the  business.  Do  not  worry,  these  lights 
shall shine out! 1

* * *

According  to  Sabri’s  interpretation,  in  conformity  with  the  allusion  of 
Sura  Wa’l-‘Asr,  the  Risale-i  Nur  is  a  means  of  preserving  Anatolia,  and 
Isparta and Kastamonu, from heavenly and earthly calamities, like the ark 
on Mount Judi; they should not therefore interfere with it, or the expected 
disasters will shortly be visited on them. They should come to their senses. I 
say again what I said shortly before the disaster, and before those letters had 
been sent to you. According to news I have now received, Kastamonu and 
its  surroundings  and  citadel  are  weeping  as  though  mourning  the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r ; it has caught a fever and is shaking with earthquakes; Allah willing, it 
will be reunited with the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and will laugh again and offer thanks.
I wrote to you the other day about my two important gains. In the second 
I said, offering supplications and gloriﬁcations with hundreds of tongues... 
till the end. Some is missing here, it should be: Each one of us, according to 
his degree, offers... with hundreds of tongues... and so on.

Also, a venerable elderly man from the village of Sava, to which I am 
very attached, was handcuffed to me and we came together; it pleased me 
greatly and I understood from it the village’s strong attachment to me. I send 
special greetings to that brother.

1.  Brother, please note! In Denizli Prison, when everything was apparently against

that all the wars and destruction of the inﬁdels have caused untold damage

disbelievers would attack the R i s a l e - i   N u r , but they would be the losers. For

My Dear Brothers!
It is my guess that our ﬁnal and true defence will be the short treatise that 
is the fruit of Denizli Prison. For the extensive plots hatched against us over 
the past year, originally due to unfounded suspicions, are the following: they 
attacked us on baseless pretexts such as founding a Suﬁ order, establishing 
a secret society, being a tool of external forces, exploiting religious feelings 
for political ends, working against the republic, meddling in government and 
breaching public security. Thanks be to Almighty Allah, their plans failed. 
Other than the truths of belief and the Qur’an, study of the hereafter, and 
working for everlasting bliss, they found nothing, even over such an exten-
sive area, among hundreds of students, in hundreds of treatises, in the letters 
and books written over a period of eighteen years. They began to seek out 
anything at all to make a pretext of, in order to conceal their plots. But I 
think that in the face of a fearsome, covert atheistic organization which has 
deceived some leaders of the government, turning them against us, possibly 
attacking us directly on behalf of absolute disbelief, we were made to write 
the treatise of T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f , which is as clear as the sun and dispels all 
doubts and is as ﬁrm and unshakeable as a mountain, as the most powerful 
defence against them and to silence them.

My Brothers!
Your place is very constricted, but the expansiveness of your hearts does 
not  allow  this  to  distress  you;  it  is  also  relatively  freer  than  where  I  am. 
Know  that  solidarity  is  our  ﬁrmest  strength  and  support.  Beware!  Do  not 
let the irritability caused by these tribulations make you ﬁnd fault with one 
another. Complaining and blaming each other and saying “ If such-and-such 
had not happened it would not have been like this ” is the equivalent of com-
plaining about fate and divine determining; do not do this. I have realized 
that there was no way we could have been saved from their assaults, what-
ever we did they would have attacked us. For the short time till divine grace 
comes  to  our  assistance,  we  must  respond  with  patience  and  thanks,  and 
resignation towards the divine decree and submission to divine determining, 
and try to gain plentiful reward and merit with few acts.

I pray for the well-being of our brothers there.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
A signiﬁcant solace in the face of the swift changes of this worldly life 
and its decline, and its ﬂeeting, fruitless pleasures, and its blows of separa-
tion,  is  meeting  with  true  friends.  Yes,  sometimes  one  travels  for  twenty 
days and spends a hundred liras to see a single friend for an hour or two. So 
now in these strange, friendless times, our seeing forty to ﬁfty friends all 
together for one or two months and our speaking together for Allah’s sake 
and receiving and giving true consolation, make these difﬁculties and ﬁnan-
cial losses that have befallen us extremely cheap and unimportant. I  myself 
would have accepted this hardship to see only one of my brothers here after 
having been parted from them for ten years. Complaint is criticism of divine 
determining, while thanks is submission to it.

I assure you that if the appointed hour were to come now and I were to 
die, I would meet it with perfect ease of heart. For I know that among you are 
many strong, steadfast young Saids who will own, inherit, and protect the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  far more effectively than this wretched, elderly, ill and debili-
tated Said. I felt very grateful and happy at those whose names are written in 
Nazif’s note, who effectively strengthen morale. I had anyway guessed that 
they would be thus. May Almighty Allah give them success and make them 
good examples to others. Amen.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
Since  you  have  attached  yourselves  to  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   for  the  hereaf-
ter, and for good works, and worship and reward, and for belief and your 
lives in the hereafter, it is surely necessary to offer thanks for your being 
here  to  meet  your  fate  and  eat  the  sustenance  appointed  to  you  and  earn 
reward  for  it.  These  have  been  determined  by  divine  determining  in  this 
School of Joseph, an arena of trial in which each hour in its severe condi-
tions is the equivalent of twenty hours’ worship. Since those twenty hours 
are a striving in the service of the Qur’an and belief they have the value of a 
hundred hours. And those hundred hours consist of meeting with true broth-
ers,  who  are  striving  on  Allah’s  way  each  of  whom  have  the  importance 
of a hundred people, and to pledging your brotherhood, and strengthening 
them and receiving strength, and consoling them and receiving consolation, 
and steadfastly persisting in this sacred service in true solidarity, and proﬁt-
ing from their ﬁne qualities, and acquiring worthiness to be students of the 
Medresetü’z- Zehra. It is necessary to think of all these beneﬁts in the face 
of all the hardships, and to respond to them with patient endurance.

My Dear, Loyal, Constant, and Faithful Brothers!
I am describing some of my circumstances here, not to sadden you or to 
take any physical measures, but so that I might proﬁt more from your shared 
prayers, and you might practise greater self-restraint, caution, patience, and 
forbearance,  and  earnestly  perserve  your  solidarity.  The  torment  and  dis-
tress I suffer here in one day is more than I suffered in a month in Eskişehir 
Prison. The ghastly Masons have inﬂicted one of their unfeeling fellows on 
me so that out of anger I might lose patience in the face of their torments, 
and they could then use it as a pretext and make it the reason for their cruel

aggression, and so conceal their lies. As a wondrous mark of divine grace, I 
merely offer thanks in patience and I am resolved to continue to do so.

Since we have submitted to divine determining and in accordance with 
the meaning of اَ(cid:182)ُز َ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:110)َا ِروُ(cid:174)ُ

divine bounty through which we may gain greater merit; and since we have 
the absolutely certain conviction, at the degree of absolute certainty, that we 
have dedicated our lives to a truth more brilliant than the sun, as beautiful 
as Paradise and sweet as eternal happiness; certainly, knowing that we are 
carrying out this non-material struggle in Allah’s way, proudly and offering 
thanks, despite the distressing conditions, we should not complain.

My ﬁrst and last advice to you is to preserve your solidarity; avoid ego-
tism, selﬁshness, and rivalry, to preserve your composure, and be cautious.
S a i d   N u r s i

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
It  is  understood  from  the  public  prosecutor’s  indictment  that  the  plans 
of the covert atheists who deceived some of the leaders of the government, 
prompting them to move against us, have come to nothing and turned out to 
be false. They are now trying to conceal their lies by accusing us of forming 
a political society and a secret revolutionary committee, and as a result, they 
do not allow me to have contact with anyone. As though all those who have 
contact with us join us. High ofﬁcials too are careful to avoid us, and they 
try to curry favour with their superiors by harassing us. I was going to add 
the below passage to the end of my objections, but I had an idea that did not 
allow me to. The passage was this:

Yes, we are a society and we are a society that every century has three 
hundred and ﬁfty million 2 members. Every day through the ﬁve obligatory 
prayers,  its  members  demonstrate  with  complete  veneration  their  attach-
ment to the principles of that sacred society. In accordance with the sacred

society, and our particular duty is to teach the believers in certain, realized 
fashion the Qur’anic truths of belief, and save them and ourselves from eter-
nal  annihilation  and  everlasting  solitary  conﬁnement  in  the  Intermediate 
Realm.  We  have  absolutely  no  connection  with  any  worldly,  political,  or 
intriguing society or clandestine group, or the baseless, meaningless secret 
societies concerning which we have been charged; we do not condescend to 
such things.

My Dear and Loyal Brothers!
Before dawn today I felt real pity for all of you. Then I remembered the 

Tr e a t i s e   f o r   t h e   S i c k   (   H a s t a l a r   R i s a l e s i   ) , and it consoled me.

Yes, this calamity is a sort of social sickness. Most of the remedies con-
nected with belief in that treatise are in this too. As I told that blessed sick 
person in Erzurum, the pain of all past tribulations has passed; what remains 
of it is its good, and its beneﬁts that look to this world, the hereafter, belief, 
and the Qur’an. That means the single transitory tribulation has been trans-
formed into numerous permanent bounties. As for the future, since it is non-
existent at the present, the tribulations that will continue in it give no pain 
now. To suffer pain due to delusions is to lack conﬁdence in divine mercy 
and Determining.

S e c o n d l y :  Most of humankind on the earth now are afﬂicted with calami-
ties, physical and non-physical, and in their hearts, spirits, and minds. Com-
pared with theirs, our calamity is both extremely light, and proﬁtable. There 
are pleasures for the heart and spirit, springing from belief, good health, and 
well-being.

T h i r d l y :  If we had not entered here amid these storms, due to our contact 
with suspicious ofﬁcials, this slight calamity would have been even severer, 
and there would have been the calamity of having to toady to them and ﬂat-
ter them.

F o u r t h l y :  Seeing with very little expense true friends more compassion-
ate  than  brothers,  and  brothers  of  the  hereafter  like  spiritual  guides,  here 
in  the  workless,  compounded  physical  and  spiritual  winter  of  this  School 
of  Joseph,  which  is  a  department  of  the  Medresetü’-Zehra;  and  visiting 
them,  proﬁting  from  their  personal  qualities,  and  receiving  strength  from 
their  ﬁne  characteristics,  which  like  light  are  diffused  through  transpar-
ent  objects,  and  from  their  spiritual  assistance,  joy,  and  consolation;  all 
changes the form of this calamity, making it a sort of veil to divine grace.

Yes, a subtle facet of this hidden grace is that all the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students 
here are called “   H o d j a ;   ”  they are spoken of respectfully as “ the h o d j a s ... 
the h o d j a s . ” There is a further subtle allusion in this, that just as this prison 
has turned into a  m e d r e s e  ( religious school ), so the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  students 
have all become teachers, and thanks to these h o d j a s  the other prisons will

for you the honour of being students of the religious sciences. Pre-eminent 
ﬁgures like Imam Shaﬁ‘i ( May his mystery be sanctiﬁed ) attached the great-
est importance to this, saying “ the sleep even of students of the religious 
sciences  is  counted  as  worship. ”  If  at  this  time  of  no  religious  schools,  a 
hundred difﬁculties are suffered in these places of torment due to being such 
elevated students, no importance should be given to them, or else, saying 
اَ(cid:182)ُز َ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:110)َا ِروُ(cid:174)ُ

families  of  our  needy  friends  and  their  having  enough  to  live  on,  in  con-
sequence  of  the  rule  of  the  Qur’an,  belief,  and  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  which  is 
to  look  at  those  worse  hit  by  disaster  than  oneself  and  at  those  in  greater 
deprivation, they are better off than eighty per cent of people. They have no 
right to complain; their right, their obligation, is to offer eighty degrees of 
thanks. divine determining ordained that we meet our fate here and eat the 
food appointed for us. The justice of divine mercy gathered us together here; 
the families have been entrusted to their true Provider, relieving those broth-
ers temporarily of their duties of supervision. Just as one day they will be 
relieved of them entirely and dismissed... Since the reality is this, we should 
say ( 3:173 ) Ø × Ö Õ  and offer thanks.

For sure I can’t meet with you in person, but I am happy and thankful 
that I am close to you in the same building. It came to me involuntarily that

Since destruction is easy, especially among idle youths such as those, I knew 
from  the  scoundrel’s  excessive  harassment  of  me  and  his  corrupting  the 
youths, that atheism is attempting to corrupt their morals in the face of our 
guiding and reforming them. Extreme caution is necessary in this situation, 
and it is absolutely essential as far as is possible not to be offended by the 
old prisoners nor to offend them and not to allow any disagreements, and to 
keep cool and put up with things, and as far as is possible, for our brothers 
to strengthen their brotherhood and solidarity through humility and modesty 
and giving up egotism. It pains me to concern myself with worldly matters, 
so having conﬁdence in your perceptiveness, I do not consider them so long 
as it is not essential.

S a i d   N u r s i

My Brothers!
Against all eventualities, I have to explain a matter that was imparted to 

me this morning.

Asking:  “ I  wonder  what  atheist  philosophers  can  say  to  this  and  what 
they will support themselves with? ”, for twenty years my soul and my satan 
have investigated whether or not the truths we have taken from the Qur’an 
leave any room for doubt or hesitation, and if they are as clear as daylight. 
They could ﬁnd no fault in any nook or cranny, and fell silent. I reckon that 
a truth which silences my soul and devil, which are extremely sensitive and 
involved  in  the  matter,  will  silence  also  even  the  most  obdurate  of  them. 
Since we are working for the sake of and on the way of a truth which is thus 
unshakeable, elevated, vast, and important, and is of inestimable value, and 
if the whole world and a person’s life were given as its price, it would still 
be  cheap;  we  should  certainly  respond  with  complete  steadfastness  to  all 
the tribulations, distress, and enemies. They have also confronted us with a 
number of deceived or hoodwinked h o d j a s , shaykhs, and apparently pious 
people. We must preserve our unity and solidarity in the face of them, and 
not bother with them or argue with them.

of T h e   K e y   t o   B e l i e f ,  and I understood that the atheists had put forward the 
Fifth Ray, which has a slight connection with politics, as the apparent rea-
son, because they could not defend their way of absolute disbelief against 
the blows of these two keen swords. So they deceived the government, mak-
ing it move against us. It occurred to me at the same time that if some of our 
weak brothers temporarily give up, they might be able to save themselves 
from this calamity, and I wanted to give them permission. Suddenly it was 
imparted to me that those brothers who are closely concerned and have twice 
been put to this test and in return have suffered so much hardship, would not 
then give it up in a heartfelt way that was both harmful and without beneﬁt, 
but might possibly apparently hold back just to deceive them. It would oth-
erwise cause harm both to himself, and to us, and to our sacred way, and as 
a penalty, the person would receive a blow contrary to his intentions.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
Certainly according to the degree of their being the cause of this impris-
onment, which is more distressing and colder than other places, those who 
are  suffering  its  hardships  will  feel  inclined  to  escape  them.  But  the  cer-
tain, realized belief that the R i s a l e - i   N u r  -its apparent cause- gains for those 
who suffer these hardships, and the happy death its gains through the cer-
tain, realized belief, and the good works of a hundred men it gains through 
the spiritual partnership, all transform the bitter hardship into sweet mercy. 
Since  this  is  so,  the  price  of  these  two  results  is  unshakeable  ﬁdelity  and 
steadfastness. To be regretful and give it up would therefore be a great loss. 
For those of the students who have no connection with the world, or very 
little,  this  imprisonment  is  preferable  to  freedom,  and  in  one  respect  is  a 
place  of  freedom.  While  since  for  those  who  are  connected  and  who  are 
well-off, the money spent becomes multiple almsgiving, and the hours spent 
are transformed into multiple worship, they should offer thanks rather than 
complaining. As for people who are impecunious and needy, their lives out-
side afford them merits that are without beneﬁt and hardships for which they 
are  responsible,  while  the  hardships  here  produce  many  merits  and  much 
reward and entail no responsibility, and are alleviated by the solace of their 
companions; this demands that they offer thanks.

THE RAYS

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
A pious person in Kastamonu said by way of complaint: “ I have declined; 

I have lost my former spiritual state, lights, and illuminations. ” I told him:
“ Perhaps you have progressed so that you have left behind your illumi-
nations  and  revelations,  which  ﬂatter  the  ego,  give  a  taste  of  the  fruits  of 
the  hereafter  while  still  in  this  world  and  encourage  self-centredness.  By 
giving up egotism and not seeking ﬂeeting pleasures and through self-abase-
ment, you have perhaps ﬂown to a higher station. ” Yes, an important divine 
bounty is not making the person who has given up his egotism perceive the 
bounty so that he does not become proud and conceited.

My brothers! In consequence of this truth, those who think similarly to 
that person or who take into account the brilliant stations that the good opin-
ions of others give, look at you and among you, see the students who appear 
in the garment of humility and self-abasement and service to be common, 
ordinary people, and they say: “ Are these the heroes of reality who chal-
lenge the whole world? Alas! Who are they? Where are the people who are 
striving to perform this sacred service, before which even the saints remain 
impotent at this time? ” If they are friends, they experience disappointment, 
and if opponents, ﬁnd their opposition justiﬁed.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
In my view your prison fruits 1 are as agreeable and valuable as fruits of 
Paradise. They conﬁrm the great hopes I had for you and what I had claimed, 
as  well  as  demonstrating  beautifully  the  power  of  solidarity.  Similarly  to 
three or four a l i f s  2 put side by side, those blessed pens uniting while suffer-
ing severe oppression showed a value of three or four hundred. The state of 
mind which preserves your unity in these confused conditions proves what 
I said yesterday. Yes -there is no error in the comparison- just as according 
to the Sunnis the position of a great saint regarding service of Islam is lower 
than that of a Companion of the Prophet ( UWBP ), so a sincere brother who 
forgoes the pleasures of the soul in serving belief at this time and practising 
humility preserves solidarity and unity, is given a position higher than that 
of a saint. This was the conclusion I came to and you conﬁrm it constantly. 
May Allah be eternally pleased with you. Amen!

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f  is most important and very valuable. It is my hope 
that  in  time  it  will  achieve  great  triumphs.  It  seems  you  have  thoroughly 
understood its value, for you have not left this place of study without les-
sons. On my own account I say that if the fruit of all this trouble and expense 
is  only  this  treatise  and  T h e   D e f e n c e   S p e e c h e s   (   M ü d â f a a t   R i s a l e s i   ) ,  and 
being together with you in the same place, it reduces to nothing the expense 
and the trouble, and if I were to suffer this calamity ten times over, it would 
still be cheap.

Due  to  many  experiences  and  especially  in  this  distressing,  restricted 
prison,  I  have  formed  the  ﬁrm  conviction  that  being  occupied  with  the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , both reading it and writing it out, greatly lessens the distress 
and gives one a feeling of expansiveness. When I am not busy with it, the 
calamity doubles and I am upset by triﬂing things. Although I reckoned that 
for various reasons Husrev, Hafız Ali and Tahiri would be suffering most, 
I saw that it was they and those who were with them who had the greatest 
composure and submission and ease of heart. I asked myself why. Now I 
have understood that they are carrying out their true duties; since they are 
not occupied with anything frivolous, and do not interfere in the functions 
of divine decree and determining, and are not boastful, critical, or panicky, 
all of which spring from egotism, with their self-possession and their stead-
fastness and peace of mind, they have exonerated the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students 
and demonstrated their moral strength in the face of atheism. May Almighty 
Allah make the true dignity and heroism within their utter humility and self-
abasement spread to all our brothers. Amen!

* * *

My Brothers!
A fearful egotism arising from heedlessness and love of this world rules 
at this time. The people of reality, therefore, have to give up egotism and 
selﬁshness, even if it is in a licit form. Since the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students dis-
solve their egotism, which is an ice-block, in the joint pool of their collective 
personality, they will not be shaken by this storm, Allah willing. Yes, a well-
tried  method  of  the  dissemblers  is  to  collect  together  people  like  ofﬁcers 
and judges, concerning some common question in constraining places which 
make them stand-ofﬁsh and irritable and critical of each other; then they stir 
them up so they ﬁght among themselves and they destroy their morale. The 
dissemblers then easily deal blows at those who lose their strength, and kill 

350

them. Since the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students have taken the way of love and broth-
erhood and ‘annihilation in the brothers,’ Allah willing, they will foil this 
well-tried, divisive stratagem.

* * *

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
One time, a shaykh had so many followers the government became anx-
ious regarding its political implications and wanted to scatter his commu-
nity. The shaykh told the government: “ I only have one and a half followers. 
No others. If you like we can put it to the test. ” So he had a tent pitched 
somewhere and gathered together all his thousands of followers there. He 
told them: “ I am going to put you to the test. Whoever is my disciple and 
complies with my command will go to heaven. ” He summoned them into 
the tent one by one. He had a sheep slaughtered secretly, as though he had 
killed his favourite disciple and sent him to Paradise. When the thousands 
of followers saw the blood, they no longer obeyed the shaykh and started to 
denounce him. Only one man said “ May I be sacriﬁced for you, ” and went 
to him. Then a woman went to him too, and the rest dispersed. The shaykh 
told the government men: “ Now you have seen for yourselves that I only 
have one and a half followers. ”

Endless thanks be to Almighty Allah that in the test and trial of Eskişehir, 
the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  lost only one and a half of its students. But ten thousand 
were added in their place thanks to the efforts of the heroes of Isparta and its 
surroundings, just the opposite of the shaykh. Allah willing, in this ordeal 
too, through the efforts of the heroes of both the east and the west, few will 
be lost, and ten will replace of any one that goes.

* * *

One time, someone who was not a Muslim found a way of succeeding 
to the leadership of a Suﬁ order and began to give guidance. The disciples 
under his training began to advance, then one of them saw through a rev-
elation that their guide had suffered a serious decline. With his insight, the 
guide  told  his  disciple:  “ So  you  have  understood. ”  But  the  disciple  said: 
“ Since it was with your guidance that I rose to this station, I shall follow 
you  even  closer  from  now  on. ”  He  beseeched  Almighty  Allah  and  saved 
his unhappy shaykh, who all of a sudden advanced, and outﬂanking all his 
disciples, again became their true guide. This means that sometimes a dis-
ciple may become the shaykh’s shaykh. But the true skill is that when one 
sees his brother in a bad situation, he does not abandon him, but strengthens 
their brotherhood and tries to reform him. This is the mark of the loyal and 

THE THIRTEENTH RAY

351

faithful.  Because  the  dissemblers  want  to  destroy  the  solidarity  of  broth-
ers in such situations and spoil their good opinions of each other, they say: 
“ See, the persons you think so highly of are just common, ordinary people. ” 
Anyway,  we  have  suffered  much  in  this  calamity,  but  since  it  is  a  matter 
that concerns the whole world of Islam, it is very cheap and of high value. 
Similar events have not been of concern for the whole Islamic world due to 
their being politics of religion or for other reasons.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
The reason I give supreme importance to your solidarity is because of 
its advantages not only for us and the R i s a l e - i   N u r , but also for the mass of 
believers who are not within the sphere of certain, realized belief, and are 
much need of a point of support and a truth which a community unshaken by 
events ﬁnds certain. Being an authority, a guide, and a proof which is unfear-
ing, unﬂinching, incorruptible, and undeceiving in the face of the currents of 
misguidance, the person who sees your powerful solidarity feels certain that 
there is a truth that may be sacriﬁced for nothing, that does not bow before 
the  people  of  misguidance,  and  is  not  defeated;  his  morale  and  belief  are 
strengthened and he is saved from joining the worldly and their vice.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
Beware! Do not argue among yourselves; spying ears will take advantage 
of it. Right or wrong, those who argue in our situation are wrong. Even if 
they are right to one degree, by disputing they may cause us untold harm.

I shall repeat a story I once told my irritable brothers in Eskişehir Prison. 
During the Great War, I was being held prisoner together with ninety ofﬁc-
ers  in  a  long  dormitory  in  northern  Russia.  They  held  me  in  high  regard 
although I did not deserve it, so my admonishments to them disallowed any 
noise or trouble. But then, due to the constraints and irritations, they became 
irascible, which gave rise to violent rows. So I told three or four of them 
that whenever they heard a noisy dispute, to go and help those in the wrong. 
They  did  this,  and  the  damaging  rows  ceased.  They  asked  me  why  I  had 
taken such unjust precautions, and I told them:

“ A person who is in the right, is fair; he will sacriﬁce his insigniﬁcant right 
for the general peace, which is of much higher worth. People in the wrong 
are mostly egotistical; they will sacriﬁce nothing, so the din increases.”

My Brothers!
You should repeatedly and carefully read the pieces in the treatise con-
taining the short letters, which are a means of consolation and enjoin for-
bearance and patient endurance. I am the weakest of you and I have the 
greatest share of this distressing calamity. Thanks be to Allah, I am endur-
ing it and I have not been vexed by those who have piled all the blame on 
me, nor annoyed at those who because it is the same matter have defended 
themselves  alone,  and  implying  we  have  formed  a  political  association, 
put the blame on me. I request that since we are brothers, you imitate me 
in this patience.

soldiers  with  bayonets  ﬁxed.  The  Old  Said’s  proud  vein  of  temperament 
made me feel exceedingly angry. But it was suddenly imparted to me that

we should respond to this situation not with anger, but with pride, thanks, 
and  joy,  for  in  the  eyes  of  the  intelligent,  and  of  incalculable  numbers  of 
angels and spirit beings and the people of reality and those among men with 
consciences and certain, realized belief, we appear as a caravan of heroes on 
the way of truth, reality, the Qur’an, and belief, challenging this century. In 
the face of their elevated regard, applause, and appreciation, which is indica-
tive of dominical acceptance and divine mercy, the insulting looks of a lim-
ited number of dissolute layabouts can be of no importance. One day, even, 
when I went by car because of illness, I felt a constrictedness, but then when 
I went together with you with my hands bound, I felt an expansiveness and 
joy of the spirit. That is to say, my state of mind arose from this meaning.

I have said it many times and I shall repeat it: there is no one in history 
who has performed as a great service on the way of truth as the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
students and have earned so much reward while suffering so little difﬁculty. 
However much hardship we suffer, it is still not costly.

Our escaping from this calamity and being saved from it is impossible in 

two respects:

T h e   F i r s t :  Divine determining appointed that we should meet part of our 
fate here, so we would have come here anyway. This way is therefore the 
best.

T h e   S e c o n d :  We discovered no way of being saved from the plots that 
were being hatched against us. I perceived them, but there was no way out. 
The unfortunate late Shaykh Abdülhakim and Shaykh Abdülbaki could ﬁnd 
no way to save themselves. This means that to complain about one another 
in this calamity is both unjust, and meaningless, and harmful, and is to feel a 
sort of offence at the R i s a l e - i   N u r . Beware! To consider some of the activi-
ties of the leading students to be the cause of this calamity and to feel indig-
nant at them, is to retreat from the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and regret having learnt the 
truths of belief. This is a far greater calamity than the material calamity. I 
swear that although my share of this calamity is twenty or thirty times greater 
than each of yours, I would not be annoyed at them even if the calamity, 

354

THE RAYS

which occurred due to lack of caution, was ten times greater, because they 
have acted with a pure intention. It is also meaningless to object to things 
that are past, because they cannot be repaired.

My  Brothers!  Anxiety  doubles  the  calamity;  it  also  roots  the  physical 
calamity  in  the  heart;  and  it  implies  objection  to  and  criticism  of  divine 
determining  and  accusation  against  divine  mercy.  Since  everything  has  a 
good side and in everything is a manifestation of divine mercy, and divine 
determining works with justice and wisdom; we are surely bound not to give 
importance to any slight trouble we may suffer as a result of the sacred task 
we are performing, which concerns the whole Islamic world at this time.

the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   has  spread  certain,  realized  belief  all  over  Anatolia,  and 
Anatolia was saved from the great losses of war in extraordinary fashion.

[ Included here is the continuation of the earthquake incident from Hus-
rev’s letter; the beginning is not included. ]

I later saw in another newspaper, the following amazing, complementary 
facts: before the earthquake, the cats and dogs gathered together in groups of 
four or ﬁve. They silently sat down together looking at each other pensively 
and  blankly,  then  dispersed.  None  of  these  animals  was  to  be  seen  either 
during the earthquake, or immediately before it, or after it; they disappeared 
into the countryside away from the towns. Another strange thing they write 
is  that  these  animals  gave  news  through  the  tongue  of  disposition  of  the 
coming disaster, which resulted from our sins, and they did not understand 
it and are amazed.

Among the hundreds of things that for years Bediuzzaman has predicted 
in  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  is  that  the  atheists  should  avoid  interfering  with  the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its students, for if harm comes to the latter, the disasters 
waiting in the ofﬁng will make them regret it a hundred time over. The earth-
quake  veriﬁed  this  with  its  signature,  then  four  more  disasters  occurred... 
May Almighty Allah bestow belief on our hearts and on the hearts of those 
who  attack  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  and  give  them  minds  that  will  recognize  the 
truth, and save us from these dungeons and them from disasters. Amen.

357

conﬁdential treatises, especially the Sufyan and Islamic Dajjal ( Antichrist ) 
in the Fifth Ray, and T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f , which smashes the arrogant disbe-
lief arising from naturalist philosophy and its insolent attacks on belief, so 
that the committee of experts there would not base their judgements on those 
conﬁdential treatises and rule against us like the ﬁrst committee.

T h e   S e c o n d   P o i n t :  My Dear Brothers! While writing the reply to your 
important letter, they gave me the same letter. I had begun the Second Point 
and it remained unﬁnished. Now I am completing it, so take note of it. If 
this idea is given currency by your useless lawyer, it is doubtless a plan of 
those who are seeking our conviction, so that like the committee of experts 
here, the committe in Ankara will take as basic the unpublished conﬁdential 
treatises,  and  especially  the  Fifth  Ray,  extend  them  to  the  whole  R i s a l e - i  
N u r  then conﬁscate it, and inferring that the matters discussed in the Fifth 
Ray  are  what  all  the  wretched  students  study  who  read  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
have them all convicted due to my crime. The prison governor and assist-
ant prosecutor’s making difﬁculties for me by preventing me from speaking 
and conﬁscating what I have written is a powerful sign that the intention is 
for Ankara to make the ruling against us before the irrefutable replies of the 
defences reach there.

T h e   T h i r d   P o i n t :  In fact, the Chairman of the Court said that day that he 
was going to send the books, documents, and defences of importance, which 
would prolong the case, to Ankara. These have certainly arrived by now. If 
my  two  well-set-out  and  explicatory  defence  speeches  are  sent,  they  may 
solve the case quickly; it would not be prolonged but expedited, and those 
with families released. But myself and those like me who have no one, we 
should not be released but remain in prison, for it is the best place to defend 
the truths of belief against the atheists and apostates.

F o u r t h   P o i n t :   If  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   is  not  acquitted  and  my  defence  is 
not  taken  into  consideration,  your  apparent  denial  will  not  save  you;  we 
are all bound together because it is all the same question. Only a very few 
of  our  friends  with  a  slight  connection  with  us  might  be  saved.  Eskişehir 
Court demonstrated this in fact. For the past year they have planted spies 
among us who carefully record the disclosures of simple-minded and rash 
students, and have employed every means to wreck us and make us regret 
our way, and have even mobilized Shaykh Abdülhakim against us. But they 
have  ruined  him  the  same  as  they  have  ruined  us  and  Shaykh  Abdülbaki 
and Shaykh Süleyman, who has objected to me from time to time, so your 
denials to them and your running away will make absolutely no difference 

358

THE RAYS

to what they think and what they call “discretionary conviction,” just as it 
made no difference in Eskişehir.

F i f t h   P o i n t :  We have understood certainly through our experiences of 
both here and Eskişehir that due to it all being the same case, our greatest 
need is for complete solidarity. Taking offence and being irritable and criti-
cal due to the hardships doubles the wretchedness of our plight. Regretably, 
it was you that I had the most conﬁdence in and trusted most. Sometimes 
when I feel a twinge of anxiety, I think of Kamil Hodja and Sıddık Hodja 
from Istanbul and the people in the province of Kastamonu who have dis-
played an extraordinary loyalty, and my anxiety evaporates. Be careful that 
the  secret  organization  that  promotes  absolute  disbelief  does  not  inﬁltrate 
you. It inﬁltrated the ward next to me and caused me indescribable torment. 
Discuss this among yourselves now without argument; I shall accept your 
decision. But if in your discussions you take into consideration the possibil-
ity that if my defence goes to Ankara and is studied there, the court here may 
come to a decision about those whose release is possible. Consider too the 
possibility that those who struggle against us, and who exiled Abdülbaki, 
Abdülhakim, and Haji Süleyman and made Yeşil Şemsi remain here after 
he had been ofﬁcially released, will not release people like Hafız Mehmed 
and Seyyid Şeﬁk, with their ﬁrm adherence to religion and refusal to bow 
before the dead leader and his picture, and their demonstrating their lack of 
support for atheism and innovations. You should also take into considera-
tion that it is of the greatest importance that the R i s a l e - i   N u r  should emerge 
from obscurity and in a momentous general question at a time they are con-
testing  themselves  in  their  centres,  the  hesitant  and  bewildered  people  of 
belief should ﬁnd the students behind them and should be shown that by not 
running away the students are bound to an unshakeable and invincible truth. 
Beware! Take no notice of each other’s faults; have respect instead of feel-
ing angry, and help each other rather than being critical.

of spirits like the angels. He carried out his duty to the letter and he has been 
discharged to take his rest. May the Most Merciful of the Merciful write mer-
its in the book of his good deeds to the number of the letters of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r , both written and read. Amen! And may He pour down blessings onto 
his  spirit  to  their  number.  Amen!  And  may  He  make  the  Qur’an  and  the

may He bestow ten heroes to take his place in the Light Factory, 2 and put 
them to work. Amen. Amen. Amen.

Remember him in your prayers like me. I beseech divine mercy that a 
thousand tongues will be employed in place of his single tongue and he will 
gain a thousand lives in place of the single life and tongue he lost.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
Endless  thanks  be  to  the  Most  Merciful  of  the  Merciful  that  in  these 
extraordinary times and strange place He permitted us by means of you to 
win the honour of being students of the religious sciences and to perform 
important services. It has been seen on numerous occasions by those who 
divine the state of people in their graves that like martyrs, some enthusias-
tic and serious students of the religious sciences who die when busy with 
their studies suppose themselves to be alive in their graves and still study-
ing.  Indeed,  while  observing  a  student  who  died  when  studying  grammar 
and syntax, one such diviner of graves was curious what answer the student 
would give to Munkar and Nakir in his grave, and he heard that when the 
questioning angel asked him:  َكُ
ّ(cid:92)َر  ْنَ(cid:174) “ Who is your Sustainer? ”, the student 
replied: “   ْنَ(cid:174) is the subject, and  َكُ
ّ(cid:92)َر is its predicate. ” He gave a grammati-
cal answer, supposing himself to be in his m e d r e s e . Thus, like that incident, 
I know the late Hafız Ali to be a student of the religious sciences working at 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r , the highest of the sciences, at the degree of martyrs and at 
their level of life. With that conviction, in some of my supplications I pray 
for him, and like him for Mehmed Zühdü and Hafız Mehmed, saying: “ O 
Allah! Allow them to be busy till the resurrection of the dead with the truths 
of belief and mysteries of the Qur’an in the guise of the R i s a l e - i   N u r   in per-
fect happiness and contentment. Amen!

My Dear and Loyal Brothers!
I  cannot  forget  the  late  Hafız  Ali;  his  suffering  upsets  me  terribly.  In 
earlier times, self-sacriﬁcing persons would sometimes die in place of their 
friends;  I  reckon  he  departed  in  my  place.  If  people  like  you  who  follow 
his system were not performing his supreme service, it would be a terrible 
loss for Islam. My pain subsides when I think of you, his heirs, and I feel 
reassured. It is astonishing but his departing together with his spiritual life, 
indeed, with his physical life, to the Intermediate Realm, has aroused in me 
a longing to go to that world, and one veil more has been folded back in 
my spirit. Just as we send greetings to our brothers in Isparta from here and 
converse with them and exchange news, so the Intermediate Realm where 
Hafız Ali now dwells, seems to me like Isparta or Kastamonu. I heard, even, 

THE THIRTEENTH RAY

361

that someone from here was sent there last night. I felt even sorrier; why 
had  I  not  sent  Hafız  Ali  greetings  with  him?  Then  it  occurred  to  me  that 
no  means  are  needed  to  send  greetings;  his  powerful  connection  is  like  a 
telephone.  Also,  he  would  come  and  receive  them.  That  great  martyr  has 
caused me to love Denizli; I do not want to leave here now. He and Mehmed 
Zühdü and Hafız Mehmed are continuing their tasks serving belief and the 
Risale-i Nur that they carried out in their lives. They watch from very close 
by, and even help. Now that they have taken their places in the sphere of the 
great saints due to their valuable service, I mention their names and that of 
Hafız Mehmed, together with those of the spiritual poles in my chain, and 
bequeath my gifts.

My Dear and Loyal Brothers!
Your  sincerity,  loyalty,  and  steadfastness  are  sufﬁcient  reason  for  you 
to disregard one another’s faults in the present trying circumstances, and to 
hide them. For the powerful brotherhood within the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  is an act 
so  good  it  causes  one  to  forgive  a  thousand  evils.  At  the  Last  Judgement 
when good deeds will preponderate over evils, divine justice will forgive, 
so you too, seeing that good deeds preponderate, should act with love and 
forgiveness. For to become angry due to a single bad deed, and exasperated 
in harmful manner out of irritability, and upset because of the difﬁculties, is 
to be wrong in two respects. Allah willing, you will assist one another and 
console each other happily, which will reduce the hardship to nothing.

My Loyal, Blessed Brothers!
The reason I have not spoken with you for a few days is my suffering a 
severe illness due to being poisoned, the like of which I have never experi-
enced. I shall be proud till the end of my days on account of the Risale-i Nur 
of my steadfast, staunch, unshakeable brothers in the Light and Rose areas, 1 
and the devoted brothers of Kastamonu. I ﬁnd them a powerful support and 
effective solace in the face of the afﬂictions of all these tyrants. If I die now, 
I will meet my death happily thanks to them.

The worldly cast me into prison due to their groundless suspicions that I 
was opposing them, but divine determining imprisoned me because I did not 
speak with them and did not try to reform them. If I remain in prison with

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
Hadiths  of  this  sort  are  allegorical.  They  are  not  particular  and  do  not 
look to general places. Others refer to the religious differences that would 
afﬂict  the  Umma  and  indicate  a  single  time,  citing  the  Hijaz  and  Iraq  as 
examples.  In  the  ‘Abbasid  period,  numerous  misguided  sects  came  into 
being which harmed Islam, like the Mu‘tazila, the Rawāﬁd, Jabriyya, and 
atheists  and  heretics  under  various  guises.  During  periods  of  serious  tur-
moil regarding the Shari‘a and tenets of belief, numerous leading ﬁgures of 
Islam emerged like al-Bukhari, Muslim, Imam al-A‘zam, Imam al-Shaﬁ‘i, 
Imam Malik, Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Imam al-Ghazali, Gawth al-A‘zam, 
and Junayd al-Baghdadi, and quelled the religious dissension. The victory 
continued for around three hundred years, but by way of politics, the sects 
of the people of misguidance covertly brought down on the Muslims the dis-
sension of Hulagu and Jenghiz. Both Hadiths, and Imam ‘Ali (May Allah be 
pleased with him) explicitly indicate this dissension together with its date. 
Then  since  the  dissension  of  the  present  time  is  one  of  the  most  serious, 
both numerous Hadiths and numerous Qur’anic allusions give news of it, 
together with the date. Making an analogy with this, when a Hadith men-
tions in general fashion the stages the Umma will pass through, it sometimes 
points out the date of a particular event within the generality, by way of an 
example. Various parts of the Risale-i Nur have made certain interpretations 
of  allegorical  Hadiths  such  as  these,  the  meanings  of  which  are  not  com-
pletely understood. The Twenty-Fourth Word and Fifth Ray elucidate this 
truth by means of principles.

* * *

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
It  was  imparted  to  me  that  I  should  explain  a  truth  so  that  you  do  not 

accuse one another of egotism or disloyalty.

At one time I observed that some of the great saints who had renounced 
egotism and none of whose evil-commanding souls remained, complained 

THE THIRTEENTH RAY

363

bitterly about them and I was astonished. I later understood perfectly that 
on the death of the evil-commanding soul, its implements are handed over 
to veins of temperament and emotions, so that the striving of the soul can 
continue  to  the  end  of  the  person’s  life;  and  the  exertion  does  continue. 
Those great saints, then, complain of this second enemy and heir of the soul. 
Moreover, spiritual worth, station, and virtue do not look to this world so 
that they should make themselves felt. In fact, since some of those at the 
highest station do not perceive the great divine favours bestowed on them, 
they  consider  themselves  to  be  more  wretched  and  bankrupt  than  every-
one, which shows that the wonder-workings, unfoldings, illuminations, and 
lights which the mass of people consider to be spiritual perfection, cannot 
be the means to and touchstone for that spiritual worth and those stations. 
This is proved by the fact that although one hour of the Companions of the 
Prophet ( UWBP ) had the worth of a day of other saints, or perhaps forty 
days’ ordeal, all the Companions experienced the same wondrous illumina-
tions and states as the saints.

My brothers, be careful! Do not let your evil-commanding souls deceive 
you by comparing others to yourselves and thinking ill of them; do not allow 
them to make you doubt the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s ability to train.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
An education minister raised the veil from his face and revealed absolute 
disbelief  in  another  guise.  He  must  have  written  that  manifesto  on  some 
other prompting, before receiving the defences we last sent. I was not think-
ing of sending them to that department, but this has shown that it is both 
appropriate and necessary to do so, with my brothers’ approval. For most 
likely, a deputy so bigoted in atheism would not be indifferent towards the 
documents and conﬁdential treatises sent to Ankara. He was suddenly hit 
on the head by the irrefutable defences; it was excellent. Allah willing, it 
will give rise to a powerful movement in favour of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  in that 
department too.

My Brothers! Since some people are like that, it is a sort of suicide to 
submit to them; it is to regret Islam, or even to shake off religion. For they 
are so bigoted in atheism that they are not content with people like us only  
submitting or pretending to submit; they tell us: “Abdicate your hearts and 
consciences  and  work  for  this  world  alone!”  In  such  a  situation,  the  sole 
solution is to rely on dominical grace, trust in Allah in patience and forti-
tude, send four crates of copies of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  to that centre, and pray 
that with their powerful truths they will be victorious. Our experience up to 
now has shown that it is of no beneﬁt to avoid one another and be upset, and 
to dissociate oneself from the R i s a l e - i  N u r , and submit to them and even join 
them. Don’t feel anxious in any way! That deputy’s blustering alarm shows 
his weakness and fear; he is compelled not to attack, but to defend himself.

Sami Bey told me that one of our brothers from Homa, a student called 
Ali, died around the same time as Hafız Ali. Mehmed Ali, one of heroes of

Ali a companion to the great martyr Ali.

Recently, a lady who is connected with us dreamt that three of our broth-
ers had died. It may be interpreted like this: two Ali’s and Mustafa, who in 
prison  wanted  to  become  a  follower  of  the  Risale-i  Nur  and  was  hanged, 
went to the hereafter in place of all of us and were sacriﬁced for our well-

My Dear, Loyal, Unshakeable Brothers, who know the true nature and 

meaning of reliance on Allah!

Although for twenty years I have felt no curiosity to either read or ask 
about  any  newspaper,  with  much  regret  I  today  saw,  only  for  the  sake  of 
some of our weak brothers, a newspaper article. I understood from it that 
covertly  and  openly  a  number  of  important  movements  are  playing  false 
parts. Since we appear in the public eye, it is supposed we are connected 
with those movements. Allah willing, the four boxes of powerful, irrefuta-
ble treatises and notebooks of decisive defences will produce good results 
for both us, and belief and the Qur’an, and Islam. We have not meddled in 
their worlds and they have in no way established that we are going to med-
dle.  Ankara  was  compelled  to  request  the  whole  R i s a l e - i   N u r   in  order  to 
scrutinize it.

Since this is the fact and since up to now in the service of the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r  we have witnessed the manifestation of dominical grace to an undeni-
able  degree  –  we  have  all  experienced  this,  particular  and  universal;  and 
since many of the movements of politics and the world are mustering forces 
against each other; and since we can do nothing except be content with the 
divine  decree  and  submit  to  divine  determining,  and  receive  the  vast  and 
sacred  consolation  arising  from  the  service  of  belief  and  the  Qur’an  and 
the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ; certainly, what falls to us before anything else is not be 
alarmed and not to despair and to strengthen one another’s morale and not to 
be frightened and to meet this calamity trusting in Allah, and recognize to be 
molehills the mountains which the inane, clamorous journalists who make 
mountains out of molehills, and to give them no importance. The life of this 
world is without value, especially at this time and under these conditions. 
Whatever happens to one, one should meet it contentedly.

illicit activity. Some of them even offer thanks, saying that they have been 
saved  from  other  sins.  They  say:  Why  should  we  complain  about  six  or 
seven  months  of  beneﬁcial  hardship,  seeing  that  we  are  employed  in  the 
most licit activity and are serving belief through the R i s a l e - i   N u r ? I congrat-
ulate them. Yes, it is a cause of pride and thanks to suffer difﬁculties for ﬁve 
or ten months due to having performed for ﬁve or ten years an enjoyable, 
pleasant, beneﬁcial, sacred service and elevated worship and reﬂection with 
the intention of saving both one’s own belief and that of others. In a Hadith 
it says: “For one person to come to believe through you is better for you than 
a plainful of red sheep and goats.”  1 You should think therefore of all the 
people here, in the court, and in Ankara, whose belief has been saved, and 
will be saved, from ghastly doubts through your writings and your service, 
and offer thanks in patience and with resignation.

If the Republican People’s Party, which governs in Ankara, obstinately 
opposes the powerful parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  which go there, and does not 
attempt to protect it with the intention of being conciliatory, the most com-
fortable place for us will be prison. It would indicate that the atheists have 
combined communism and atheism and that the government is obliged to 
heed them. If that were the case, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  would draw back and halt, 
and calamities, material and immaterial, would begin their onslaught.

them. The leading ﬁgures of the ﬁrst generations of Islam did not discuss 
them  much.  For  such  unseen,  invisible  matters  are  open  to  exploitation. 
Fraudulent persons may exploit them for their own ends, just as spiritualists 
nowadays perform their charlatanry calling it “calling up spirits [ jinns ].” It 
should not be much discussed therefore since such people exploit it to harm 
religion. Also, no prophets have been sent from the jinns after the Seal of 
the Prophets ( UWBP ). Also, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  has tried to prove the exist-
ence of jinns and spirit beings with incontrovertible proofs in order to refute 
the ideas of materialism, which plagues humanity at this time. It has put the 
matter in third place and has left detailed discussion of it to others. Allah 
willing, a student of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  may expound Sura al- Rahman in the

The deaths of Hafız Ali, Hafız Mehmed, and Mehmed Zühdü were truly 
a great loss not only for us, but for Isparta and even for this country and the 
Islamic world. But up to now, as a manifestation of divine grace, whenever 
a R i s a l e - i  N u r  student has been lost, two or three have immediately appeared 
who follow the same system. I have powerful hopes therefore that serious 
students  will  emerge  who  will  carry  out  those  students’  duties  in  another 
form. Anyway, those three blessed people performed a hundred years’ worth 
of duties serving the cause of belief in a short period. May the Most Merciful 
of the Merciful grant them mercy to the number of the letters of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  that they wrote, published, and read. Amen!

Offer my condolences to Hafız Mehmed’s relations and his blessed vil-
lage for me. I have made him a companion to Hafız Ali and Mehmed Zühdü, 
and have included the names of the three of them among the names of those 
of my masters who were spiritual poles. And I have made Hafız Akif the 
companion of Asım and Lütﬁ.

this  matter  of  ours  has  been  delayed.  For  love  of  that  dreadful  dead  man 
was being inculcated in all the schools, government departments, and in the 
people. This situation would have had a grievous and painful effect on the 
Islamic  world  and  the  future.  The  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  which  demonstrates  with 
decisive  proofs  his  true  nature,  now  passing  – outside  our  wills –  into  the 
hands  of  those  at  the  top  and  those  most  closely  connected  with  him  and 
those  who  would  be  the  last  to  give  him  up,  and  its  being  carefully  and 
curiously studied, is such an event that if thousands of people like us were 
to be sent to prison and even to be executed, it would still be cheap with 
regard to the religion of Islam. At the very least, it will to a degree save the 
most obdurate of them from absolute disbelief and apostasy, lead them into 
doubting disbelief, and moderate their arrogant and insolent aggression. We 
said to their faces as our ﬁnal words in court: “ Let our heads be sacriﬁced 
for a sacred truth which millions of heroic heads have been sacriﬁced for!”, 
and claimed that we shall hold out to the very end. This cause may not be 
renounced.  I  hope  that  there  is  no  one  among  you  who  would  give  it  up. 
Since you have patiently endured it up to now, say: “ Our fates and duties 
are yet to be fulﬁlled, ” and continue to endure it. Certainly, they can not 
obstinately oppose the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  in order to defend their way, which is 
undeniably proved in T h e   F r u i t s  to consist of eternal annihilation and ever-
lasting solitary conﬁnement; they will rather seek ways of coming to terms

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
In the First Ray, the allusions the verse,

( 6:122 )  q p o n m l k j i h g 
makes to both the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and with the word i with three powerful 
signs  and  connections,  to  these  unhappy  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students  have  been 
elucidated. Now, in the present events, one of those signs is being realized. 
For, holding up life, civilization, and pleasure, those who oppress us accuse 
us of giving no importance to that style of life; they make charges against us, 
and even want to have us imprisoned with hard labour, or executed. But they 
can ﬁnd no legal sanction for this. As for us, we hold up death, the introduc-
tion to eternal life and its veil, and hit them over the heads with it to bring 
them to their senses, and work with all our strength to save them from true 
conviction, eternal execution, and everlasting solitary conﬁnement. If I am 
given the severest penalties even because of the vehement treatises that were 
sent to Ankara but the people who mete out the penalties are saved by the 
treatises from the execution of death, both my heart and my soul will consent 
to it. That is to say, we want life for them in both worlds and this is what we 
are seeking, but they want us to die and they are seeking pretexts for this. 
But we are not defeated before them, because the reality of death and thirty 
thousand human corpses daily display as clearly and visibly as the sun the 
proclamations and decrees for thirty thousand eternal executions and thirty 
thousand solitary conﬁnements for the people of misguidance. Let them do 
what they want.

According to j a f r  and a b j a d  reckoning, the verse,

( 5:56 )  Ï Î Í Ì Ë 
has  given  us  the  good  news,  even  in  the  twelve  years  of  our  most  bitter 
defeat, of our victory together with its date. Since the reality is this, we shall 
from now on say the following, both to the court and to the people:

We are trying to be saved from death’s eternal execution, which awaits 
us ever before our eyes, and from the everlasting darkness of the solitary 
conﬁnement of the grave, which opens its door to us and summons us ine-
luctably.  We  are  helping  you  to  be  saved  from  that  awesome,  inevitable 
calamity. The questions of politics and this world, which in your view are 

THE THIRTEENTH RAY

371

the  most  momentous,  have  little  value  in  our  view  and  in  that  of  reality, 
and are meaningless, unimportant, and worthless for those not directly con-
cerned.  Whereas  the  essential  human  duties  with  which  we  are  occupied 
have a genuine connection with everyone at all times. Anyone who does not 
like this task of ours and wants to put a stop to it, should put a stop to death 
and shut up the grave!

The third and fourth points have not been written for now.

It is one of the wonders of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  that for ten years Üstad Bedi-
uzzaman has repeatedly said: “ Atheists and apostates! Don’t interfere with 
the  R i s a l e - i   N u r !  It  is  a  means  of  repulsing  disasters,  like  almsgiving,  so 
attacks on it, or its ceasing from activity, weakens its defence against disas-
ter. If you molest it, the calamities now waiting in the ofﬁng will rain down 
on you in ﬂoods. ” There are numerous disasters we have witnessed in this 
connection.  Whenever  in  the  past  four  years  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   and  its  stu-
dents have been attacked, a disaster or calamity has followed, demonstrating 
the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s importance and that it is a means of repulsing disaster. 
Among the hundreds of events Bediuzzaman predicted through the R i s a l e - i  
N u r , disasters have put their signatures to their correctness with the hand of 
earthquakes; the four disasters which followed them showed that the R i s a l e -
i   N u r  is a means of repulsing calamities. May Almighty Allah bestow belief 
on  the  hearts  of  those  who  attack  us  and  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  and  give  them 
minds and eyes in their heads that will see the truth; and may He save us 
from these dungeons and them from those disasters. Amen!

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
It is a manifestation of dominical grace that while expecting the Educa-
tion Minister to erupt and attack us, although he had not seen our defences, 
documents, and books, and had only sensed them; and although the highest 
government departments had studied our most vehement conﬁdential trea-
tises like the Fifth Ray and  t h e   A d d e n d u m   t o   T h e   S i x   A t t a c k s   (   H ü c u m a t - ı  
S i t t e ’ n i n   Z e y l i   )  in order to criticize them; and our defences’ bold, harsh and 
serious blows at absolute disbelief should have led Ankara to act severely 

372

THE RAYS

against us; they adopted a very lenient, and even conciliatory, position rela-
tive to the importance of the question. One reason for this manifestation of 
divine grace is this: the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   is being read with care and attention 
all over the country, which as a result has become a large d e r s h a n e  or place 
of  study,  and  by  all  the  important  departments  of  government.  Yes,  such 
elevated teachings being studied at this time on such a comprehensive and 
universal scale is certainly a signiﬁcant instance of divine favour and is a 
powerful sign that it has smashed absolute disbelief.

My  Brothers!  There  may  be  an  excuse  if  some  weak  family  men  who 
have suffered much hardship and loss withdraw a little from the Risale-i Nur 
and from us, or even give us up, but I say in consequence of the possibility 
that they may change after having been released: it would be a serious loss 
for those who have paid this price, material and non-material, for goods of 
such value, and have suffered much torment, to forgo those goods. And if 
they suddenly give up the Risale-i Nur and its parts, and their attachment to 
it, and stop protecting us and helping and serving us, it would be an unneces-
sary loss both for them and for us. For this reason, in addition to being cau-
tious, it is necessary not to switch their loyalty, ties, and service.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
It  is  a  manifestation  of  dominical  favour  and  instance  of  divine  pres-
ervation  that  as  I  have  heard,  the  experts’  committee  in  Ankara  has  been 
defeated in the face of the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s truths, and while there are numer-
ous reasons for its criticizing it and objecting to it strongly, it has quite sim-
ply supplied the decision for its acquittal. However, the harsh expressions 
in the conﬁdential treatises and the challenging words in the defences, and 
the ﬁery attacks of the Education Minister, and there being two materialist 
philosophers attached to the Ministry of Education on the experts’ commit-
tee  and  a  prominent  scholar  who  supports  the  new  measures,  and  for  the 
past year a covert atheistic organization has been inciting the People’s Party 
and Ministry of Education against us, all led us to expect violent objections 
and  crushing  penalties  from  the  experts’  committee.  But  then  the  preser-
vation  and  grace  of  the  Most  Merciful  came  to  our  assistance,  and  point-
ing out to them the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s high station, induced them to forgo their 
violent criticisms. Even, with the idea of saving us from being convicted, 

THE THIRTEENTH RAY

373

and so that, because of the Eskişehir affair and famous Thirty-First of March 
Incident  I  should  not  be  regarded  as  having  been  previously  convicted  of 
political crimes, and show that we act solely for religion and belief and have 
no political aims, they said: “ Said Nursi has long claimed to be an heir of 
the Prophet. He adopts the position of a regenerator in serving the Qur’an 
and belief; that is, he is sometimes overcome by a sort of ecstasy, and gets 
carried away. ” With this passage and the irreligious expressions of the phi-
losophers, they are saying to those who support religion, whoever they are: 
he is carrying out this duty, having inherited it from the regenerators of reli-
gion. They have used those irreligious philosophical terms in order to both 
criticize the excessively good opinions of me of some of our brothers, which 
are  higher  than  my  due;  and  by  calling  me  an  ecstatic,  together  with  my 
vehemence, to exonerate me from political involvement and being convicted 
of it; and to ﬂatter to an extent those who object to us and are hostile; and to 
show that the Qur’anic allusions, and wondrous indications of Imam ‘Ali, 
and the truths of Gawth al-A‘zam, are all powerful; and to smash the ambi-
tion, egotism, and conceit which by comparison with others they reckon is 
certainly present in me. From beginning to end, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  furnishes 
a reply to those words as brilliant as the sun. And since our way is brother-
hood and the giving up of egotism, and since we have not made any self-
advertising ecstatic utterances, the New Said’s humble life in the time of the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  and his disregarding the excessively good opinions of him of 
his blessed brothers and moderating them with his instruction, completely 
refute the implications of those expressions, and dismiss them.

* * *

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
I  am  not  sending  you  the  committee  of  experts’  unanimous  decisions 
for the moment so that no harm comes to those who informed on us. This 
last  experts’  committee  has  evidently  done  all  it  can  to  save  us  and  pre-
serve us from the evil of the people of misguidance and innovation, and has 
exonerated us from all the charges made against us. They give the feeling 
that they have grasped thoroughly what the R i s a l e - i   N u r  teaches, and have 
unanimously decided that the greater part of its scholarly parts about belief 
are written knowledgeably, that Said explains his views both sincerely and 
seriously, and that the power and strength in it are not to contest the govern-
ment, but only to teach the needy the truths of the Qur’an. And they inferred 
about the conﬁdential treatises, which they call “ unscholarly: ” “ He some-
times goes into ecstasy and suffers emotional disturbance and mental storms, 

374

THE RAYS

and  should  not  therefore  be  held  responsible. ”  And  concerning  the  terms 
“ the Old Said ” and “ the New Said, ” they said there are two personalities, 
and inferred that in the second are an extraordinary strength of belief and 
knowledge  of  the  Qur’anic  truths,  and  for  the  sake  of  the  philosophers 
said  that  “ there  is  the  possibility  of  a  sort  of  ecstasy  and  mental  distur-
bance, ” while to save us from being charged concerning a certain violence 
of expression and to ﬂatter our opponents, they said: “ the possibility may 
be noted of an illness affecting hearing and sight which results in hallu-
cinations. ” The treatises of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , which are superior to other 
products of the mind, form sufﬁcient answer to the suggestion of this pos-
sibility,  refuting  it  totally.  They  have  these  in  their  possession,  and  the 
treatises containing the defence speeches and T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f , which 
have left all the lawyers in amazement. I offer many thanks that due to this 
possibility the allusion of a Hadith was imparted to me. Also, the experts’ 
committee has completely acquitted all my brothers and myself. Its mem-
bers said, “ They adhere to Said’s scholarly and knowledgeable works for 
their belief and their lives in the hereafter; we found nothing explicit or 
implicit in either their correspondence, or their books or treatises, suggest-
ing any sort of conspiracy against the government. ” They gave their deci-
sion unanimously, and put their signatures, philosopher Necati, ( scholar ) 
Yusuf Ziya, and philosopher Yusuf.

It is a subtle coincidence that while for ourselves, we call this prison a 
School  of  Joseph  (   M e d r e s e - i   Yu s u ﬁ y e   )   and  T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f ,  its  fruit, 
these two other Yusuf’s have said secretly through their tongues of disposi-
tion “ we also have shared in the lessons of that School of Joseph. ” Moreo-
ver,  their  subtle  evidence  for  the  possibility  of  ecstasy  and  hallucinations 
are  phrases  like  “ The  Thirty-Third  Word ”  and  “ The  Thirty-Third  Letter 
Containing  Thirty-Three  Windows, ”  and  “ his  hearing  his  cat  reciting  the 
divine names ‘ Ya   R a h i m !   Ya   R a h i m !  ( O Most Compassionate One! )’, ” and 
“ his seeing himself as a gravestone. ”

Since according to numerous signs, we are under divine protection, and 
since  in  the  face  of  numerous  inequitable  enemies,  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   has 
not been defeated, and has silenced to a degree the Education Minister and

People’s  Party,  and  since  those  who,  greatly  exaggerating  the  extent  and 
breadth of our question, have caused alarm to the government are sure to try 
to conceal their slander and lies with various trumped up excuses; what we 
must do is to retain our patience and composure in perfect submission, and 
particularly not to feel disillusioned, and not to despair when sometimes the 
opposite of what we hoped occurs, and not to be shaken by passing storms! 
Yes, disillusionment may destroy the morale and enthusiasm of the worldly, 
but  for  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students,  who  see  beneath  the  hardship,  striving 
and  distress,  the  favours  of  divine  mercy,  disillusionment  is  necessary  to 
strengthen  their  efforts,  their  progress,  and  their  seriousness.  Forty  years 
ago the politicians sent me to a lunatic asylum saying I was suffering from 
a temporary madness. I told them: I consider most of what you call sanity to 
be insanity; I resign from that sort of sanity. I observe in you the rule,

Now with the idea of saving myself and my brothers from serious charges, 
I repeat the same words to those who ascribe occasional ecstasy or a tempo-
rary insanity to me because of the conﬁdential treatise, and I am grateful in 
two respects:

T h e   F i r s t :  In  a  sound  Hadith,  it  says:  “ The  ordinary  people  deeming, 
because  they  are  beyond  their  understanding,  the  elevated  states  of  one 
who has attained perfect belief to be madness, point to the perfection of his 
belief. ” 1

T h e   S e c o n d   R e s p e c t :  I  would  agree  with  complete  pride  and  joy,  not 
only to be called mad, but to sacriﬁce my mind completely, and my life, for 
the well-being and salvation of my brothers in this prison and for them to 
be delivered from darkness. If you think it suitable, even, let someone write 
a letter of thanks to those three persons, and tell them that we are allowing 
them to share in our spiritual gains.

that you wholely forgive each other. You are brothers closer to each other 
than the most devoted blood brother, and a brother conceals his brother’s 
faults, and forgives and forgets. I do not attribute your uncustomary differ-
ences and egotism here to your evil-commanding souls, and I cannot rec-

My Brothers!
It is understood from the report of the experts’ committee that the R i s a l e -
i   N u r  defeats all the groups opposing us, for by repeating T h e   D e c i s i v e   P r o o f

Sincerity,  they  are  attracting  attention  to  them.  Moreover,  the  purpose  of 
their  extremely  superﬁcial  and  pseudo-bigoted  h o d j a -like  criticisms,  the 
answers to which are quite plain; and their saying, without grasping which 
matters are completely unrelated and which are in truth conformable, that 
“ there is a contradiction between them; ” and their unhesitatingly afﬁrming 
and appreciating ninety per cent of the treatises despite the vehement refuta-
tions in the addendum to  T h e   S i x   A t t a c k s   (   H ü c u m a t - ı   S i t t e   )  of those who 
have issued the f a t w a s  for the innovations, and the attacks on them, is only 
to  justify  themselves.  Moreover,  their  sufﬁcing  with  pointing  out  that  my 
saying that persecuted, religious Christians who are killed by the enemies 
of religion may at the end of time be sorts of martyrs is contradictory to the 
Addendum’s severe attacks on performing the prayers with uncovered head

A Short Addendum to My Statement 

I say this to Afyon Court:
As is said in my statement, which has been presented to you and been put 
before the law and its justice: to raid my house three times illegally, sum-
mon me for questioning and arrest me has violated the dignity of three high 
courts and cast aspersions on their justice, indeed insulted it. For three courts 
and three committees of experts have scrutinized closely over two years my 
books and letters of twenty years, and both we have been acquitted, and our 
books and letters returned. Moreover, living in complete seclusion under the 
most rigorous surveillance for three years after having been acquitted, I was 
able to write only one harmless letter a week to some of my friends. It was 
as though all my relations with the world had been cut, for although I had 
been given my freedom, I could not return to my native region. It tramples 
the honour of those three courts to bring up the same question again now, as 
though completely disregarding their just decisions. I make a plea to your 
court  to  preserve  the  honour  of  those  courts,  which  acted  justly  towards 
me. You should ﬁnd some matter with which to blame me other than “ the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , ”  “ organizing  a  political  society, ”  “ founding  a  Suﬁ  order, ” 
and “ the possibility of breaching security and disturbing public order, ” for 
they  constitute  the  same  case!  I  have  many  faults.  I  have  decided  to  help 
you concerning my blameworthiness, for I have suffered far more outside 
prison than inside it. I would ﬁnd more comfort now in either the grave or 
prison. Truly I am fed up with life. Enough now of these twenty years of 
torment in solitary conﬁnement, intolerable surveillance and humiliation. It 
will provoke divine wrath. It will put this country to shame. I am reminding 
you. Our ﬁrmest refuge and shield is:

[ This petition, which after eighteen years’ silence I am compelled to 
present to the court and a copy of which I am sending to Ankara, com-
prises  my  written  objections  concerning  the  indictment,  which  I  am 
obliged to put forward. ]

This is a summary of a short defence speech: it should be known that it 
is exactly what I twice told the public prosecutor and police inspector, and 
on the third occasion the police chief and six or seven inspectors and police, 
who three times came to search my house in Kastamonu; and what I said in 
reply to the questions of the public prosecutor in Isparta, and the courts of 
Denizli and Afyon. It is like this:

I told them: I have been living alone for eighteen to twenty years. I lived 
for eight years in Kastamonu opposite the police station, and in other places 
for twenty years, under constant surveillance and supervision, and the place 
where I was staying was searched on several occasions but not the slightest 
hint or sign of anything related to this world or politics was found. If there 
had been anything irregular on my part and the police and judiciary did not 
know, or they did know but ignored it, then surely they are answerable to 
a greater extent than me. And if not, why, although nowhere in the world 
recluses are bothered who are preoccupied with their lives of the hereafter, 
do you bother me unnecessarily to this extent, to the detriment of the country 
and nation?

We students of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  do not make the R i s a l e - i   N u r  a tool of 
worldly currents, nor even of the whole universe. Furthermore, the Qur’an 
severely prohibits us from politics. For the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s duty is to serve 
the Qur’an through the truths of belief and through extremely powerful and 
decisive proofs, which in the face of absolute unbelief – which destroys eter-
nal  life  and  also  transforms  the  life  of  this  world  into  a  ghastly  poison– 
induce even the most obdurate atheist philosophers to believe. Therefore we 
may not exploit the R i s a l e - i   N u r  for anything.

Firstly: In order not to reduce to the value of fragments of glass in the 
view of the heedless, the diamond-like truths of the Qur’an by giving the 
false idea of political propaganda, and not to betray those precious truths.

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

379

Secondly: Compassion, truth and right, and conscience, the fundamen-
tal  way  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  severely  prohibit  us  from  politics  and  from 
interfering in government. For dependent on one or two irreligious peo-
ple fallen into absolute unbelief and deserving of slaps and calamities are 
seven or eight innocents - children, the sick and the elderly. If slaps and 
calamities  are  visited  on  the  one  or  two,  those  unfortunates  suffer  also. 
Therefore, since the result is doubtful, we have been severely prohibited 
from  interfering  in  the  life  of  society  by  way  of  politics,  to  the  harm  of 
government and public order.

Thirdly: Five principles are necessary, essential, at this strange time in 
order  to  save  the  social  life  of  this  country  and  the  nation  from  anarchy: 
r e s p e c t ,   c o m p a s s i o n ,   r e f r a i n i n g   f r o m   w h a t   i s   p r o h i b i t e d   (   h a r a m   ) ,   s e c u r i t y,  
t h e   g i v i n g   u p   o f   l a w l e s s n e s s   a n d   b e i n g   o b e d i e n t   t o   a u t h o r i t y.  The evidence 
that  when  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   looks  to  the  life  of  society  it  establishes  and 
strengthens these ﬁve principles in a powerful and sacred fashion and pre-
serves the foundation-stone of public order, is that over the last twenty years 
it has made one hundred thousand people into harmless, beneﬁcial members 
of this nation and country. The provinces of Isparta and Kastamonu testify to 
this. This means that knowingly or unknowingly the great majority of those 
who try to hamper the R i s a l e - i   N u r  are betraying the country and nation and 
dominance of Islam on account of anarchy. The great good and beneﬁt for 
this country of the one hundred and thirty treatises of the R i s a l e - i  N u r  cannot 
be refuted by the imaginary harms of two or three of its parts, which are fan-
cied to be harmful in the superﬁcial view of the deluded heedless. Anyone 
who refutes the former with the latter is an exceedingly unfair tyrant.

As  for  my  own  unimportant  personal  faults,  I  am  unwillingly  obliged 
to say this: I am someone who has lived alone and in solitude in an exile 
resembling solitary conﬁnement. During this time I have not gone once of 
my  own  will  to  the  market  and  well-attended  mosques.  Despite  suffering 
much persecution and distress, I have not once applied to the government 
for my own comfort, unlike all my fellow exiles. In twenty years I have not 
read a single newspaper, nor listened to one, nor been curious about one. As 
is testiﬁed to by all my close friends and those I met with, for a full two years 
in Kastamonu and seven years in other places I knew nothing of the conﬂicts 
and wars in the world, and whether or not peace had been declared, or who 
else was involved in the ﬁghting, and was not curious about it and did not 
ask, and for nearly three years did not listen to the radio that was playing 
close by to me. But I triumphantly confronted with the R i s a l e - i   N u r  absolute 

380

THE RAYS

unbelief,  which  destroys  eternal  life  and  transforms  the  life  of  this  world 
even into compounded pain and suffering; and with the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which 
issued from the Qur’an, I have saved the belief of a hundred thousand such 
people,  as  has  been  attested  by  them,  and  for  a  hundred  thousand  people 
have transformed death into discharge papers. Is there any law demanding 
that such a person is harassed to this degree and made to despair, and by 
making him weep to make hundreds of thousands of those innocent brothers 
of his weep too? What advantage does it offer? Is it not unprecedented tyr-
anny in the name of justice? Is it not an unprecedented miscarriage of justice 
on account of the law?

If you accuse me like some of the ofﬁcials who searched my house, say-
ing: “ You and one or two of your treatises oppose the regime and our prin-
ciples... ”

The Answer,  F i r s t l y :  These new principles of yours have absolutely no 

right to enter the retreats of recluses.

S e c o n d l y :  To reject something is one thing, not to accept it wholeheart-
edly  is  something  else,  and  not  to  act  in  accordance  with  it  is  something 
quite else. Those in authority look to the hand, not to the heart. All govern-
ments  have  vehement  opponents  who  do  not  interfere  in  government  and 
public  order.  In  fact,  the  Christians  who  were  under  the  Caliph  ‘Umar’s 
( May  Allah  be  pleased  with  him )  rule  were  not  interfered  with  although 
they rejected the law of the Shari‘a and the Qur’an. According to the princi-
ples of freedom of thought and conscience, so long as they do not upset the 
government, if some of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students do not accept the regime 
and your principles on scholarly grounds and act in opposition to them, and 
even  if  they  are  inimical  to  the  regime’s  chief,  they  may  not  be  touched 
legally. As for the treatises, I said they were conﬁdential and prevented their 
publication. In fact, in regard to the treatise that was the cause of this affair, 
only  once  or  twice  in  eight  years  in  Kastamonu  did  someone  bring  me  a 
copy. The same day I put it away somewhere. Now you are forcibly publi-
cizing it and it has become famous.

It  is  well-known  that  if  there  is  some  fault  in  a  letter,  only  the  faulty 
words are censored, and the rest are permitted. As a result of the four months 
of  close  investigation  in  Eskişehir  Court,  only  ﬁfteen  words  were  found 
in a hundred treatises of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  that were the cause of criticism, 
and now on only two pages of the four-hundred-page Z ü l ﬁ k â r  are explana-
tions of Qur’anic verses about inheritance and the veiling of women, which 
were written thirty years ago and do not now conform to the Civil Code. 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

381

This  proves  decisively  that  they  have  no  worldly  aim,  and  everyone  is  in 
need of them. The four-hundred-page Z ü l ﬁ k â r , which everyone has need of, 
may not be conﬁscated because of two pages. Those two pages should be 
excised and the collection returned to us; it is our right that it is returned.

If you say like those who suppose irreligion to be politics of a sort and in 
this episode have said: “ You are spoiling our civilization and our pleasure 
with these treatises of yours... ”

I   r e p l y :  It is a universal principle accepted worldwide that no nation can 
continue  in  existence  without  religion.  Particularly  if  absolute  unbelief,  it 
gives  rise  to  torments  more  grievous  in  this  world  than  Hell,  as  has  been 
proved with complete certainty in A   G u i d e   F o r   Yo u t h . That treatise has now 
been printed ofﬁcially. If, Allah forbid, a Muslim apostasizes, he falls into 
absolute disbelief; he cannot remain in a state of doubting unbelief, which 
keeps him alive to an extent. He also cannot be like irreligious Europeans. 
And in respect of the pleasure of life, he falls inﬁnitely lower than the ani-
mals, for they have no sense of the past and future. Because of his misguid-
ance, the deaths of all past and future beings and his being eternally sepa-
rated from them, overwhelm his heart with continuous pain. If belief enters 
his heart and he comes to believe, those innumerable friends are suddenly 
raised to life. They say through the tongue of disposition: “ We did not die 
and we were not annihilated, ” transforming his hellish state into Paradise-
like pleasure. Since the reality is this, I warn you: do not contest the R i s a l e - i  
N u r ,  for  it  relies  on  the  Qur’an.  It  cannot  be  defeated.  It  would  be  most 
regretable  for  this  country.  1  It  would  go  somewhere  else  and  illuminate 
there. Also, if I had heads to the number of the hairs on it and every day one 
was cut off, I would not bow this head, which is devoted to the Qur’an, to 
atheism and absolute disbelief, I would not and could not give up this service 
of belief and the R i s a l e - i   N u r .

Certainly, any faults in the statement of someone who has been a recluse 
for twenty years will be disregarded. He is defending the R i s a l e - i   N u r , so it 
cannot be said he deviated from the subject. Eskişehir Court found nothing 
after studying its hundred treatises, both conﬁdential and otherwise, for four 
months, apart from one or two points touching on a subject necessitating a 
light penalty, and it gave six-month sentences to ﬁfteen people out of one 
hundred and twenty. I served the sentence as well. And since a few years ago 
all the parts of the R i s a l e - i  N u r  came into the hands of the Isparta authorities, 

1.  The severe earthquakes which occurred the four times the R i s a l e - i   N u r  was con-

tested proved that it would be “ most regretable for this country. ”

382

THE RAYS

who  after  studying  them  for  several  months,  returned  them  to  their  own-
ers; and since after serving that sentence, nothing was found to concern the 
police and judiciary during my eight years in Kastamonu despite the minute 
searches; and since during the last search in Kastamonu some of my treatises 
came to light, in a condition they could never have been published, having 
been hidden under piles of ﬁrewood several years previously, as was veriﬁed 
by the group of police; and since although the Kastamonu police chief and 
judiciary gave their certain word to return those harmless books of mine that 
had been hidden, I was moved on without receiving those trusts, since on the 
second day the order suddenly came from Isparta for my arrest; and since 
the courts of Denizli and Ankara acquitted us and returned all my treatises; 
certainly and without doubt, as a consequence of the above six facts, it is 
demanded by their positions that Afyon Court and its public prosecutor take 
into consideration this very important right of mine, as did Denizli Court and 
public prosecutor. I am hopeful that the public prosecutor, who defends the 
rights of the people, will also defend my personal rights, which due to my 
relation with the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  are like important public rights; and I await 
this from him.

The New Said has for twenty-two years withdrawn from social life, and 
does  not  know  the  present  laws  and  how  defences  should  be  carried  out, 
and is presenting to this new court the irrefutable hundred-page defence he 
presented to Eskişehir and Denizli Courts; he paid the penalty for his errors 
up to that time, and after that in Kastamonu and Emirdağ lived in a sort of 
solitary conﬁnement under constant surveillance; he is therefore now falling 
silent and leaving it to the Old Said to speak. And the Old Said says this:

Since the New Said has turned away from the world, he does not speak 
with the worldly unless absolutely compelled to defend himself, and con-
siders it unnecessary. But numerous innocent artisans and tradesmen being 
arrested  in  this  affair  due  to  some  slight  connection  with  me  aroused  my 
extreme  sympathy,  since  at  this  busy  time  they  have  been  unable  to  earn 
livelihoods for their families. It upset me deeply. I swear that if it had been 
possible, I would have taken all their difﬁculties upon myself. Anyway, if 
there is any fault, it is mine. They are innocent. Because  of this grievous 
situation, I say, despite the New Said’s silence: since the wretched New Said 
answered the hundreds of unnecessary questions of the public prosecutors of 
Isparta, Denizli, and Afyon, it is my right to ask of the present Ministry of 
Justice, with the intention of defending my rights, the three questions I asked 
the Ministry of Home Affairs, and chieﬂy Kaya Şükrü, thirteen years ago.

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

383

The First: Which law states that one hundred and twenty people includ-
ing myself should be arrested because of the merely verbal argument with 
a gendarme sergeant of a man from Eğirdir, who though not a R i s a l e - i   N u r  
student was carrying an unimportant letter of mine? Then with the excep-
tion of ﬁfteen, the innocence of all of them was established by their being 
acquitted after four months of investigation by the court. According to what 
principles are possibilities cited instead of occurrences? According to what 
rule of justice are seventy unfortunates caused the loss of thousands of liras 
although  they  had  previously  been  acquitted  by  Denizli  Court  after  nine 
months of investigations?

Second  Question:  ( 6:164 )   _ ^ ] \ [   even  a  blood-brother 
cannot be held responsible for his brother’s faults, so under which law of 
justice  was  it  to  arrest  me  in  Ramadan  because  of  a  short  treatise  whose 
publication I had prevented, which had passed into my hands once or twice 
in eight years, was originally written more than twenty-ﬁve years ago, saves 
believers  from  doubting  a  number  of  important  points  and  prevents  them 
denying some misunderstood allegorical Hadiths, –because this treatise was 
found on someone I did not know a long way away from me, and the wrong 
meaning  was  given  to  this,  and  an  offensive  letter  was  found  in  Kütahya 
and Balıkesir; and to arrest now in this freezing cold numerous artisans and 
tradesmen for having in their possession some old, commonplace letter writ-
ten by me, or for having driven me around in their carriage, or because of 
their friendship towards me, or for having read one of my books, and to ruin 
them, and cause them, and the country and nation, material loss and imma-
terial loss of thousands of liras,– what law demands this? Which article of 
which law necessitates it? I request to learn of these laws so I do not take 
any false step.

Yes, one reason for our arrests at both Denizli and Afyon was this: even 
if to suppose the impossible the Fifth Ray did look to this world and poli-
tics, -although it was written long ago while I was in the Darü’l-Hikmeti’l-
İslâmiye,  1 and the original was written even before that, with the idea of 
saving the belief of the ordinary people in the face of those who denied some 
Hadiths because they thought they were irrational, since they did not known 
how they should be interpreted- and even if it had been written at this time, 

1.  The Darü’l-Hikmeti’l-İslâmiye was a learned body set up in 1918 to ﬁnd solutions 
for the problems confronting the Islamic world, and to provide scholarly answers for at-
tacks made on Islam. It was attached to the Şeyhülıslam’s Ofﬁce and was composed of 
nine permanent members and various ofﬁcers. Bediuzzaman’s appointment was ratiﬁed by 
the Caliph in August 1918. [ Tr. ]

THE RAYS

since it was private, and was not found with me in the searches, and its pre-
dictions about the future turned out to be true, and it dispels doubts on ques-
tions of belief, and does not disturb public order, and is not confrontational, 
and  only  gives  news  of  things,  and  does  not  specify  any  individuals,  and 
sets out a scholarly truth in general form, - since this is the case, surely even 
if the Hadith’s meaning is seen to conform to certain persons at this time, 
and before it was exhibited and made public in the courts it had been held 
to be conﬁdential in order not to give rise to dispute, it cannot in any way 
constitute a crime. I also do not consider it possible that in any court of law 
in the world it is considered a crime to say “ to reject something is one thing, 
and not to accept it on scholarly grounds or not to act in accordance with it 
is something completely different. That treatise does not accept on scholarly 
grounds a regime that was going to emerge in the near future. ”

I n   S h o r t :   The  R i s a l e - i   N u r   has  for  thirty  years  killed  at  the  root  abso-
lute disbelief, which destroys eternal life, turns the life of this world into a 
ghastly poison, spoiling all its pleasures; it has successfully killed the atheis-
tic ideas of the naturalists; has proved brilliantly with wonderful arguments 
the principles that will bring happiness to this nation in both this life and the 
next; and is based on the Qur’an’s reality, from the divine throne. I claim, 
and am ready to prove it, that not one or two points of a short treatise such 
as that, but if it contained a thousand errors, its thousand signiﬁcant good 
aspects would cause them to be forgiven.

Third  Question:  It  is  the  rule  that  if  in  a  letter  of  twenty  words  ﬁve 
are considered reprehensible, the ﬁve are censored and the rest are permit-
ted. So since after scrutinizing it for four months Eskişehir Court could ﬁnd 
only  ﬁfteen  words  out  of  a  hundred  thousand  that  to  the  superﬁcial  view 
were  imagined  to  be  harmful;  and  since  the  Cabinet  questioned  only  the 
explanations of two Qur’anic verses, because they contravened the present 
law although they had been written thirty years previously, on two of the 
four hundred pages of Z ü l ﬁ k â r ; and the Denizli and Ankara committees of 
experts questioned only ﬁfteen errors; and since up to the present it has been 
the means of reforming the characters of hundreds of thousands of people, 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  has brought to pass a thousand things widely beneﬁcial for 
this country and nation; -since this is so, which principle of the government 
of the republic does it conform to, to arrest in this work- season and bitter 
winter unfortunates like the Çalışkans who serve me seeking Allah’s pleas-
ure, because they have performed some small service for the R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
or written out one of its treatises because it had saved their belief, and were 
brotherly towards me out of kindness because I was elderly and a stranger in 
Emirdağ? Which of its laws would permit such a thing?

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

385

Since in accordance with the law of freedom of conscience the principles 
of the republic do not interfere with those without religion, surely it neces-
sitates  that  they  do  not  interfere  with  religiously-minded  people  who  are 
not involved in the world as far as it is possible, and do not dispute with the 
worldly, and strive usefully for their lives in the hereafter, their belief, and 
their country too. I know that the politicians who govern in Asia, where the 
prophets appeared, will not, and cannot, ban t a q w a  and good works, which 
for a thousand years have been as essential for this nation as food and medi-
cine. Humanity demands that anything not conforming to the current view in 
the above questions is overlooked, since, having lived in solitude for twenty 
years, they were asked with the head of the Said of twenty years ago.

I  consider  it  my  patriotic  duty  to  recall  the  following,  for  the  beneﬁt 
of  the  country,  nation,  and  public  security:  to  arrest  and  make  resentful 
in  this  way  because  of  some  slight  connection  with  me  and  the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r , numerous people who are religiously beneﬁcial for the country and 
its security, and may turn them against the government thus opening up 
the way to anarchy. Yes, far in excess of a hundred thousand people have 
saved their belief through the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and have become harmless and 
highly  beneﬁcial  for  the  nation.  With  their  moderation  and  usefulness, 
they are perhaps to be found in every large department of the government 
of the republic and in every level of society. It is essential that these people 
are not offended but protected.

I feel a strong anxiety that certain ofﬁcial persons who do not heed our 
complaints or allow us to speak out, and repress us on various pretexts are 
opening up the way to anarchy to the harm of this country.

Also, for the good of the government I say this: since the courts of both 
Denizli and Ankara scrutinized the Fifth Ray, and did not object to it but 
returned it to us, it is essential for the government that proceedings are not 
reopened ofﬁcially, giving rise to rumours and gossip. Just as I concealed 
the treatise before it passed into the hands of the courts and they publicized 
it, so the Afyon authorities and court should not make it the object of ques-
tion and answer. For it is powerful and irrefutable. It made predictions, and 
they turned out right. Moreover, its aim is not this world, at the most one of 
its many meanings ﬁts a person who is dead and gone. For the sake of the 
country, nation, public order, and government, I am bound by conscience to 
warn against making those predictions and meanings ofﬁcial due to bigoted 
friendship for him, and further publicizing it by reprimanding us.

THE RAYS

To the Afyon Public Prosecutor and the Chairman
and Members of the Court

[ I am presenting to you in order to protect my rights, exactly the same 
nine principles which I presented to the Denizli judicial authorities. ]

Twenty  years  ago  I  abandoned  social  life,  and  especially  ofﬁcial, 
reﬁned, political life such as this. I do not know what position should 
be taken in such situations, and I do not think of it, and to think of it 
causes me acute distress. But I am compelled to present this disorgan-
ized defence and petition, which is the conclusion and summary of the 
answers I gave to the numerous, repetitious, and haphazard questions 
of an unfair member of another court of law. Perhaps it lacks order and 
contains irrelevant and unnecessary repetitions, vehement expressions 
which  may  act  against  me,  and  sentences  opposed  to  the  new  laws, 
which I do not know. But since it proceeds on the truth, for the sake 
of the truth the faults should be disregarded. This petition and defence 
speech is based on nine principles.

The First: Since in accordance with the republic’s principle of freedom 
of  conscience,  the  government  of  the  republic  does  not  interfere  with  the 
irreligious and dissipated, it certainly should not interfere with the religious 
and righteous; and since no irreligious nation can continue in existence, and 
with regard to religion Asia does not conform to Europe, and an irreligious 
Muslim does not resemble any other person without religion; and since no 
sort of progress or civilization can take the place of religion, or righteous-
ness, or the learning of the truths of belief in particular, which are the innate 
need of the people of this country, who for a thousand years have illumined 
the world with their religion and heroically preserved their ﬁrmness of faith 
in the face of the assaults of the whole world, and cannot be made to forget 
that need; surely no government of this nation in this country can intervene 
in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  in respect of justice and the law and public order.

Second Principle: Since it is one thing to reject something and some-
thing quite different not to act in accordance with it; and all governments 
have ﬁerce opponents; and there were Muslims under Zoroastrian rule and 
Jews  and  Christians  under  the  Islamic  government  of  the  Caliph  ‘Umar; 
and all those who do not cause trouble to the government or disturb public 
order have personal freedom, and this may not be curtailed, and governments 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

387

look  to  the  hand  and  not  to  the  heart;  and  since  those  who  want  to  upset 
public order and the administration and interfere in politics will doubtless 
concern themselves with the newspapers and current affairs in order to learn 
about  the  movements,  situations,  and  events  that  will  assist  them  so  they 
make  no  false  moves;  and  since  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   so  restrains  its  students 
that as my close friends know, for twenty-ﬁve years it has made me give up 
reading the newspapers and even asking about them or being curious and 
thinking  about  them;  and  since  for  ten  years  now  I  have  withdrawn  from 
social life to such an extent that apart from the German defeat and the spread 
of communism I have heard no news about what is happening in the world 
and the current situation; certainly and without doubt no one can attack me 
and my brothers like me on grounds of governmental wisdom, the laws of 
politics, and principles of justice; and if they do, it is bound to be due to 
delusions, or out of hatred or obduracy.

Third  Principle:  I  am  obliged  to  give  the  following  lengthy  details 
because of the meaningless and unnecessary objections of the public pros-
ecutor of the former court, which he made due to a misunderstanding con-
cerning not the law, but his bigoted love of a certain dead person.

F i r s t l y :  Before it fell into the hands of the government, I treated the Fifth 
Ray as conﬁdential. Moreover, it was not found in any of the searches. Also, 
its purpose was only to save the ordinary people from doubts concerning their 
beliefs and from denying allegorical Hadiths. It looks to worldly aspects of 
the Hadiths only indirectly, in third or fourth place. The predictions it makes 
are true. Moreover, it does not contest the politicians and worldly; it only 
makes predictions. Also, it does not specify anyone. It explains in general 
fashion a true meaning of a Hadith. But they applied that general truth to a 
fearsome person living in this century. They therefore objected to it, suppos-
ing it had been written in recent years. In fact, the original of the treatise was 
previous to the Darü’l-Hikmet. But it was set in order some time later, and 
included in the Risale-i Nur. It was like this:

Forty years ago, the year before the Proclamation of the Constitution, 1 I 
came to Istanbul. The Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese army had asked 
some questions of the Istanbul u l e m a  at that time. The Istanbul h o d j a s  asked 
me about them. They asked me many things in that connection.

For instance, they asked me about a Hadith which says: “ At the end of 
time, a fearsome person will rise in the morning and on his forehead will be 

1.  The Proclamation of the ( Second ) Constitution in July, 1908. [ Tr. ]

written: ‘This is an inﬁdel.’ ” 1 I told them: “ This extraordinary person will 
come to lead this nation; he will rise in the morning, put a [ brimmed ] hat on 
his head, and make others wear it. ”

After receiving this answer, they asked me: “ Won’t those who wear it 
be inﬁdels? ” I said: “ They will be made to wear the brimmed hat and be 
forbidden to prostrate in prayer. But the belief in the heads of those wearing 
the brimmed hat will make the hat prostrate, and Allah willing, will make it 
Muslim. ”

They  then  said:  “ This  person  will  drink  water  and  his  hand  will  be 
pierced, and it will be known through this that he is the Sufyan. ” I said to 
them in reply: “ It is commonly said about someone who is very extravagant 
that he has a hole in his hand. That is, he cannot hold onto anything; it ﬂows 
from him and is lost. Thus, this fearsome man will be addicted to r a k ı , it will 
make him ill, he will become excessively extravagant and accustom others 
to being the same. ”

Then someone asked: “ When he dies, Satan will proclaim loudly to the 
world from Dikilitaş in Istanbul that so-and-so has died. ” So I said: “ The 
news will be broadcast by telegraph. ” However, I heard shortly afterwards 
that the radio had been invented, and I realized that my answer had not been 
completely  accurate.  Eight  years  later  while  in  the  Darü’l-Hikmet,  I  said: 
“ Satan will broadcast it to the world by radio. ”

They then asked me questions about the Barrier of Dhu’l-Qarnayn, Gog 
and Magog, the Beast (   d ā b b a t  a l - a r ḍ   ) , the Antichrist (   D a j j a l   ) , and the sec-
ond coming of Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ), and I replied to them. In fact 
the answers are written in part in my old treatises. Some time later, Mustafa 
Kemal  twice  summoned  me  to  Ankara  2  by  code  by  means  of  the  former 
governor of the province of Van, my old friend, Tahsin Bey, in recognition 
of my published work T h e   S i x   S t e p s   (   H u t u v â t - ı   S i t t e   ) . I went. Since Shaykh 
Sanusi  3 did not know Kurdish, it was proposed I should take his place as 
general preacher of the Eastern Provinces on a salary of three hundred liras. 
I was also offered a position as a deputy, and my former post together with 

1.  B u k h ā r ī ,  Fitan, 26; Muslim, Fitan, 101, 102; Ti r m i d h ī ,  Fitan, 62; M u s n a d , iii, 115; 
211, 228, 249, 250; v, 38, 404- 5; vi, 139-40. For this and the other Hadiths about the signs 
of the end of time, see, The Fifth Ray in the present work.

sion in 1911. As a staunch supporter of the caliphate, he was invited to Istanbul in 1918, 
and was subsequently appointed general preacher in eastern Turkey and greatly assisted 
the Turks in the War of Independence. [ Tr. ]

the other members of the Darü’l-Hikmet within the Directorate of Religious 
Affairs.  Moreover,  being  endorsed  by  one  hundred  and  sixty-three  out  of 
two hundred deputies, one hundred and ﬁfty thousand liras were allotted for 
the Medresetü’z-Zehra, my university in the East, the foundations of which I 
had laid in Van, and this was accepted. However, since I saw that the predic-
tions of the original of the Fifth Ray were in part realized in a person there, I 
was compelled to forgo those most important duties. Telling myself that the 
person could not be opposed or confronted, I gave up the world and politics 
and the life of society, and dedicated all my time to saving religious belief. 
However, a number of tyrannical and unjust ofﬁcials forced me to write two 
or three treatises which looked to the world.

Later, in connection with some questions asked by some persons about 
allegorical Hadiths which give news of the events at the end of time, I rear-
ranged that old treatise. It received the name of the Fifth Ray. The R i s a l e - i  
N u r  is not numbered chronologically. For example, the Thirty-Third Letter 
was  written  before  the  First  Letter,  and  the  original  of  the  Fifth  Ray  and 
some other parts were written previously to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  itself. Anyway, 
the illegal, unnecessary, and inaccurate objections and questions of a public 
prosecutor, asked out of bigoted love of Mustafa Kemal, forced me to pro-
vide these explanations outside the subject. I am giving here as an example 
some of the entirely personal and unlawful things he said in the name of the 
law. He said:

“ Aren’t you sincerely sorry that you insulted him in the Fifth Ray with 
expressions like ‘swilling down r a k ı  and wine like a water pump’? ” I say 
in reply to the completely meaningless and mistaken bigotry arising from 
his love: “ The victory and honour of the heroic army cannot be ascribed to 
him; he can have only a share of it; like it would be tyrannical and an awe-
some  injustice  if  the  booty,  possessions,  and  rations  of  an  army  were  all 
given to its commander. Yes, just as he accused me of not loving that unjust 
and extremely faulty man, quite simply accusing me of being a traitor, so I 
accuse him of not loving the army, for he ascribes all its honour and moral 
booty to the man he loves, depriving the army of all glory. The reality is 
that positive things, and instances of good and virtue, should be distributed 
among the community and army, and the negative things, destruction, and 
faults ascribed to the chief. For the existence of something is dependent on 
the existence of all its conditions and elements, and the commander is only 
one of the conditions. While the non-existence of the thing and its falling 
apart, occurs through the non-existence of one of its conditions and one of 

390

THE RAYS

its elements being spoilt and destroyed. Instances of good and virtues for 
the most part are positive and pertain to existence. The leaders cannot lay 
claim to them. Instances of bad and faults are destructive and pertain to non-
existence, and the leaders are answerable for them. While the reality is thus, 
just as if a tribe is mocked if, when it wins victories Hasan Ağa is applauded, 
and when it is defeated it is blamed, and this is judged to be the reverse of 
the truth; in just the same way, in the name of the court the public prosecutor 
imputed a fault to me that was completely the reverse of the truth and reality.
Similarly to his mistake, a little previously to the Great War while I was 
in Van, a number of religious, Allah-fearing persons came to me. They told 
me: “ Some of the military commanders act contrarily to religion. Come and 
join us, we are going to rebel against them. ”

I told them: “ Bad conduct and irreligion like that is particular to com-
manders  like  them;  the  army  cannot  be  held  responsible  for  it.  There  are 
perhaps a hundred thousand saints in the Ottoman Army; I shall not draw 
my sword against it. I will not join you. ” They left me, drew their swords, 
and the fruitless Bitlis Incident occurred. A short time later war broke out. 
The army took part in it in the name of religion; it entered the  j i h a d , and 
a hundred thousand martyrs from it rose to the degree of sainthood. They 
conﬁrmed what I had said, signing the decrees for their sainthood with their 
blood. Anyway, I was compelled to relate this at some length. The extraor-
dinary attitude of a public prosecutor who acted derisively towards myself 
and the R i s a l e - i   N u r  due to unimportant, mistaken feelings and partiality, in 
the name of justice, one incontrovertible mark of which is imperviousness 
to all feelings and outside inﬂuences, drove me to make this long statement.
Fourth Principle: After scrutinizing for four months hundreds of cop-
ies of treatises and letters, Eskişehir Court could only give sentences of six 
months to ﬁfteen men out of one hundred and twenty, and one year to myself 
for ﬁfteen words in one or two treatises out of a hundred. They acquitted 
us  of  founding  a  Suﬁ  order  and  organizing  a  political  society  and  in  the 
hat question. We anyway had served the sentence. Then in Kastamonu they 
found nothing in numerous searches. And a number of years ago in Isparta 
all the parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  without exception, both conﬁdential and oth-
erwise, fell into the hands of the authorities. They were all returned to their 
owners after three months of scrutiny. A few years later, all the parts of the 
R i s a l e - i  N u r  remained for two years in the courts of Denizli and Ankara, then 
they were all returned to us. Since that is the fact, those who accuse myself 
and the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  students emotionally, maliciously, and unlawfully in 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

391

the name of the law like him, are accusing before us both Eskişehir Court, 
and Denizli Court, and Ankara Criminal Court, making them partners in our 
crime, if there is one. For if we had been guilty, those three or four authori-
ties did not see it despite their close scrutiny or they disregarded it, and two 
courts did not see it having studied it minutely for two years, or they disre-
garded it, which makes them more guilty than us. However, if we had had 
any desire to interfere in the world, it would not have been with the buzzing 
of a ﬂy, it would have exploded and boomed like a cannon.

Yes,  anyone  who  accuses  of  political  intrigue  a  person  who  defended 
himself  vehemently  and  without  restraint  in  the  military  court  after  the 
Thirty-First of March Incident  1 and in the Speaker’s ofﬁce in the face of 
Mustafa Kemal’s anger, saying he was hatching his schemes for eighteen 
years without allowing anyone to detect it, surely does so for some mali-
cious purpose. We are hopeful that like the Denizli public prosecutor, the 
Afyon  public  prosecutor  will  save  us  from  the  malice  and  accusations  of 
such people and demonstrate true justice.

Fifth Principle: A fundamental principle of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students is 
that as far as is possible they do not interfere in politics, or matters of admin-
istration, or government activities, because for them, working seriously for 
the Qur’an is worth everything, and is sufﬁcient.

Also, no one who enters politics, among the overwhelming currents that 
now prevail, can preserve his independence and sincerity. He is bound to 
become subject to one of the currents, and it will exploit him for worldly 
ends. It will corrupt the sacredness of his duty. Also, in the material struggle, 
due to the utter tyranny and despotism that is the rule this century, he would 
have to crush numerous innocent supporters of a person because of the error 
that person had made. He would otherwise be defeated. It would also seem 
in the view of those who had given up their religion for the world, or who 
exploited it, that the Qur’an’s sacred truths, which can be the tool of nothing, 
were being exploited for political propaganda. Also, every class of people, 
supporters and opposers, ofﬁcials and common people, should have a share 
of those truths and all are in need of them. The R i s a l e - i   N u r  students have 
therefore to avoid politics and the material struggle completely, and not be 
in any way involved in them, so that they may remain completely impartial.

diuzzaman was arrested following the revolt along with many others and tried, but was 
acquitted. [ Tr. ]

392

THE RAYS

Sixth Principle: The R i s a l e - i   N u r  should not be attacked in this matter 
because of my personal faults or those of some of my brothers. It is bound 
directly to the Qur’an, and the Qur’an is bound to the supreme throne. Who 
has the ability to stretch out his hand and unfasten it? Also, as is indicated 
by  thirty-three  Qur’anic  verses,  Imam  ‘Ali’s  ( May  Allah  be  pleased  with 
him ) three miraculous prophecies and the certain pronouncements of Gawth 
al-A‘zam ( May his mystery be sanctiﬁed ), the R i s a l e - i   N u r  has performed 
an extraordinary service for this country and is a source of material plenty 
and spiritual effulgence for it, and cannot therefore be held responsible for 
our petty, personal faults, and it should not be held responsible. Otherwise 
both material and spiritual loss will be caused to this country which it will 
impossible to repair.

Allah willing, the assaults and diabolical machinations against the R i s a l e -
i   N u r  of the atheists hostile to us will be foiled, for its students cannot be 
compared with others, they cannot be scattered nor be made to give it up; 
through Allah’s grace, they will not be defeated. If the Qur’an had not pro-
hibited them from physical defence... those students, who are everywhere 
and  have  won  public  favour,  which  is  like  the  life-blood  of  this  nation, 
would never get involved in petty, fruitless incidents like the Shaykh Said 1 
and Menemen incidents. 2 If, Allah forbid, they were persecuted to the point 
they were compelled and the R i s a l e - i   N u r  attacked, the atheists and dissem-
blers who deceive the government would regret it a thousand times over.

I n   S h o r t :   Since  we  do  not  interfere  in  the  worlds  of  the  worldly,  they 
should not interfere in our work for the hereafter and our service of religious 
belief.

[ I  am  relating  here  by  way  of  defence  an  old  memory  and  pleasant 
anecdote that was neither divulged in Eskişehir Court, nor written in the 
ofﬁcial records, nor included in my defence speeches. ]

They  asked  me  there:  “ What  do  you  think  about  the  republic? ”  I 
replied: “ As my biography which you have in your hands proves, I was 
a religious republican before any of you, with the exception of the chair-
man of the court, was born. A summary is this: like now, I was living at 

1.  The famous Shaykh Said Revolt which broke out in February, 1925 in eastern Tur-
key. Bediuzzaman strongly advised its leaders against undertaking any such action against 
the  government,  as  it  would  “ ...  make Ahmed  kill  Mehmed,  and  Hasan  kill  Husayn. ” 
[ Tr. ]

2.  A minor incident which occurred in the town of Menemen in western Turkey 1930, 
but was blown up out of all proportion and brutally suppressed. Bediuzzaman was in no 
way involved in it. [ Tr. ]

that time in seclusion in a remote tomb. They used to bring me soup, and I 
would give breadcrumbs to the ants. I used to eat my bread having dipped 
it  in  the  soup.  They  asked  me  about  it  and  I  told  them:  the  ant  and  bee 
nations are republicans. I give the breadcrumbs to the ants out of respect 
for their republicanism. ”

Then they said to me: “ You are opposing the righteous early generations 
of Islam.” I told them in reply: “The four Rightly-Guided Caliphs were both 
caliphs and presidents of the republic. For sure, Abu Bakr the Veracious 
(May Allah be pleased with him) was like a president of the republic for 
the Ten Promised Paradise, and the Companions of the Prophet (UWBP). 
But it was not just an empty name and title, they were heads of a religious 
republic which bore the meaning of true justice and freedom in accordance  
with the Shari‘a. ”

I told them: Mr. Prosecutor and Members of the Court! You are accus-
ing me of holding an idea opposite to that which I have held for ﬁfty years. 
If  you  ask  me  about  the  secular  republic,  what  I  understand  by  it  is  that 
secular ( laic ) means to be impartial; that is, a government which, in accord-
ance  with  the  principle  of  freedom  of  conscience,  does  not  interfere  with 
the religiously- minded and pious, the same as it does not interfere with the 
irreligious and dissipated. I withdrew from political and social life twenty-
ﬁve years ago, and what form the government of the republic has taken, I 
do not know. If, I seek refuge with Allah, it has assumed a fearsome form 
whereby, on account of irreligion, it passes and accepts laws to incriminate 
those who work for their belief and lives in the hereafter, then I announce to 
you fearlessly and warn you that if I had a thousand lives, I would be ready 
to sacriﬁce all of them for belief and life in the hereafter. Do whatever you 
will!  My  last  word  is  ( 3:173 ) Ø × Ö Õ  In  response  to  your 
wrongfully condemning me to capital punishment or hard labour, I say: as 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  has discovered and shown with absolute certainty, I am not 
being executed; I am being discharged and departing for the world of light 
and happiness. As for you, our covert enemies, wretches who oppress us on 
account of misguidance! Since I know you are condemned to eternal extinc-
tion and everlasting solitary conﬁnement, and I have seen this, I have taken 
my revenge on you totally, and am ready to surrender up my spirit with a 
perfectly easy mind!

Seventh Principle: In consequence of superﬁcial investigations held in 
other places, Afyon Court looked on us as a political society. My reply is 
this:

394

THE RAYS

F i r s t l y :   As  is  testiﬁed  to  by  all  those  who  have  befriended  me,  I  have 
read no newspaper for nineteen years, nor listened to one, nor asked about 
one, and for the past ten years ﬁve months have received no news except 
about the German defeat and the terror of communism, and I have not been 
curious, and have not known. Such a person surely has no connection what-
soever with politics, and no relations with any political society.

S e c o n d l y :  The one hundred and thirty parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  are there 
for  all  to  see.  Understanding  that  they  contained  no  worldly  goal  and  no 
aim other than the truths of belief, Eskişehir Court did not object to them 
with the exception of one or two of the parts, and Denizli Court objected to 
none at all, and despite being under constant surveillance for eight years the 
large Kastamonu police force could ﬁnd no one to charge apart from my two 
assistants and three others, and those charges were merely pretexts. This is a 
decisive proof that the students of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  are in no way a political 
society. If what is intended by “ society ” in the indictment is a community 
concerned with religious belief and the hereafter, in reply we say this:

If the name community is given to university students and tradesmen, it 
may also be applied to us. But if you call us a community that is going to 
breach internal security by exploiting religious feelings, in response we say:
In no place over a period of twenty years in these stormy times R i s a l e - i  
N u r  students have breached internal security or disturbed public order, and 
no such incident has been recorded by either the government or any court; 
this fact refutes this accusation. If the name community is given meaning it 
might breach internal security in the future through strengthening religious 
feelings, we say this:

Firstly, foremost the Directorate of Religious Affairs, and all preachers, 

perform the same service.

Secondly, it is not disturbing the peace and breaching security, the stu-
dents  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   protect  the  nation  from  anarchy  with  all  their 
strength and conviction, and maintain public order and guard security. The 
evidence for this has been cited in the First Principle.

Yes, we are a community, and our aim and programme is to save ﬁrstly 
ourselves and then our nation from eternal annihilation and everlasting soli-
tary conﬁnement in the Intermediate Realm, and to protect our compatriots 
from anarchy and lawlessness, and to protect ourselves with the ﬁrm truths 
of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  against atheism, which is the means to destroying our 
lives in this world and in the next.

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

395

Eighth Principle: Saying its treatises contain some sharp expressions, 
they accuse us as a result of deﬁcient and superﬁcial study of the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r  carried out in other places. In reply I say this: since our aim is belief 
and  the  hereafter,  it  is  not  confrontation  with  the  worldly.  And  since  the 
sharpness particular to these very insigniﬁcant one or two treatises was not 
intentional  -we  bumped  against  the  worldly  while  advancing  towards  our 
goal- it certainly does not infer political prejudice. And since possibilities 
are one thing and occurrences are something else, and what we have been 
accused of is “ possibly ” disturbing public order, not having disturbed it, it is 
meaningless, for anyone may kill someone else. And since over a period of 
twenty years in their scrupulous investigations into twenty thousand people 
and thousands of copies and letters, and in their searches, neither Eskişehir, 
nor Kastamonu, nor Isparta, nor Denizli could ﬁnd anything constituting a 
real crime, Eskişehir Court was compelled to ﬁnd us guilty because of one 
short treatise under one article of an elastic law, and could only give six-
month sentences to ﬁfteen people out of a hundred in such a way that they 
should have sentenced all who teach religion. I wonder if the twenty conﬁ-
dential letters one of your people had written over a year were scrutinized, 
wouldn’t they contain twenty incriminating sentences which would shame 
him? But the fact that in twenty thousand copies of the treatises and letters 
from twenty thousand people they could not ﬁnd twenty truly incriminating 
sentences shows that the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s aim is solely the hereafter. It has no 
business with this world.

Ninth Principle: As with the matters which Denizli Court’s just prose-
cutor included in the indictment because of the unfair and superﬁcial records 
of other places, so with Afyon Court -as indicated by what we experienced 
while  being  questioned-  pretexts  have  been  made  so  that  we  have  been 
charged concerning the same matters, and undated letters, and correspond-
ence over twenty, ﬁfteen, and ten years, and the Fifth Ray -decisive answers 
about which are found in the Third Principle above and in the Second Ques-
tion of my petition above- and four or ﬁve treatises out of the hundred and 
thirty of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and a number of letters and treatises which were 
scrutinized  by  Eskişehir  Court  and  for  which  the  sentences  were  served, 
were later covered by the pardon and were acquitted by Denizli Court. Can 
it be said about someone who with a speech outside the War Ministry during 
the Thirty-First of March Incident brought to order eight battalions which 
had  not  heeded  the  Şeyhülislam  and  ulema,  that  he  strove  for  eight  years 
– as stated by the police report- and only succeeded in deceiving twenty or 

396

THE RAYS

thirty people? For instance, in the large town of Kastamonu he was able to 
hoodwink only ﬁve people? For during the Denizli affair, in Kastamonu they 
pulled out all my papers and books, both conﬁdential and otherwise, from 
under the ﬁrewood, and after studying them for three months could ﬁnd no 
one  in  that  large  town  other  than  Feyzi,  Emin,  Hilmi,  Tevﬁk,  and  Sâdık. 
Because Feyzi and the others had performed some personal services for me 
for Allah’s sake, they sent them to prison, together with the three brothers 
and  three  or  four  others  they  found  in  Emirdağ,  who  had  assisted  me  for 
three  and  a  half  years.  If  I  had  done  what  that  superﬁcial  report  stated,  I 
would have deceived not ﬁve or ten people but ﬁve hundred or perhaps ﬁve 
thousand, or even ﬁve hundred thousand. As in Denizli Court I pointed out 
the many errors in the police reports, so too here I am pointing out one or 
two examples:

They accused us of “ corrupting religion ” because, following an Islamic 
custom  practised  since  the  age  of  the  Prophet,  I  had  compiled  a  H i z b   a l -
Q u r ’ a n i   like  a  large  A n ‘ a m   1  out  of  the  hundreds  of  well-known  verses 
which form the sources of the R i s a l e - i   N u r .

Also, they want to incriminate us by showing that the Tr e a t i s e   o n   I s l a m i c  
D r e s s  (   Te s e t t ü r  R i s a l e s i   )  was written and published this year, whereas I have 
already served a year’s sentence for it, and I treated it as conﬁdential, and 
as noted in the police report, it was pulled out from under piles of ﬁrewood. 
Also, although the well-known person did not respond and was silent in the 
face of the objections and harsh words I said to him in the Speaker’s ofﬁce 
in the Assembly in Ankara, with gross exaggeration the prosecution applied 
to  him  literally  the  natural,  necessary,  general,  and  conﬁdential  criticisms 
in  my  explanations  of  forty  years  previously  concerning  a  Hadith  which 
describes his errors, after his death, making it into an indictable offence for 
us. Can there be any comparison between the sake or memory of someone 
who is dead and gone and who no longer has any connection with the gov-
ernment, and Almighty Allah’s laws of justice, which are a manifestation of 
His sovereignty?

Also, freedom of conscience which, of the principles adopted by the gov-
ernment  of  the  republic,  is  the  one  we  have  most  relied  on  and  defended 
ourselves with, has been made something we have transgressed against, as 
though we are opposed to it.

1.  It had formerly been a common practice to gather together in a single volume for 
constant reading Sura al-An‘ām and other meritorious suras and verses from the Qur’an. 
[ Tr. ]

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

397

Also,  because  I  criticised  the  evils  and  faults  of  civilization,  unimagi-
nable  things  are  ascribed  to  me  in  the  police  reports:  as  though  I  do  not 
accept the use of the radio, 1 aeroplane and railway, they accuse me of being 
opposed to modern progress.

Making a comparison with these examples, Allah willing, like the just 
and fair Denizli public prosecutor, Afyon Court will show how contrary to 
justice this treatment is, and will attach no importance to the delusions in 
those police reports.

The strangest error is this: in one place I said: although humankind should 
have responded with endless thanks to Almighty Allah’s supreme bounties 
of the aeroplane, railway, and radio, they did not, so He rained down bombs 
on  their  heads  from  the  planes.  The  radio  is  also  a  supreme  bounty,  and 
thanks for it may be shown by making it a universal reciter of the Qur’an 
with  millions  of  tongues,  allowing  all  the  people  on  the  face  of  the  earth 
to listen to it. Also, I said when explaining in the Twentieth Word that the 
Qur’an makes predictions about the future wonders of civilization, that one 
of  its  verses  indicates  that  the  inﬁdels  will  defeat  the  Islamic  world  with 
the railway. Although I had urged Islam to lay hold of these wonders, some 
of the prosecutors in previous courts, accused us of being against modern 
progress, and made the aeroplane, railway, and radio the basis of charges 
against us.

Also, although it is completely unrelated, someone said about the name 
Risaletü’n-Nur, which is a second name of the R i s a l e - i  N u r , that “ it is a mes-
sage (   r i s a l e t   )  from the light of the Qur’an, that is, it is inspired by it, and is 
an heir performing the function of divine messengership, of the Shari‘a. ” In 
another place in the indictment, it was given the wrong meaning and made 
the basis of other charges, as though I had said: “ the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is a divine 
messenger (   r e s û l   ) . ”

I  have  also  proved  with  decisive  arguments  in  twenty  places  in  my 
defence  speeches  that  even  if  it  were  for  the  whole  world,  we  would  not 
exploit either religion, or the Qur’an, or the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and they may not 
be exploited, and that we would not change one of their truths for rule over 
the whole world, and that is how we are in fact. There have been thousands of 
indications of what I claim over the last twenty years. But from the way the 
interrogations at Afyon are going, and its indictment, we are being accused

radio, it should “ recite the Qur’an so that all the people on the face of the earth could listen

due to other police reports of expending all our efforts on worldly intrigues, 
and hastening to the hateful games of this world, and making religion the 
tool of lowly things and degrading its sacredness, and making these our aim. 
Since it is thus, with all my strength I say: ( 3:173 ) Ø × Ö Õ

ُهَ(cid:178)اَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126) ِه ِ(cid:175)ـ ْ(cid:126)اِ(cid:92)
An Addendum to My Written Objections to the Charges
Made Against Us by Afyon Court

[ Those  I  address  in  this  objection  are  not  the  Afyon  prosecutor  and 
Court, but the spiteful and suspicious ofﬁcials who due to the false and 
defective  reports  of  public  prosecutors  in  other  places  and  informers 
and detectives, have turned against us the extraordinary situation here 
and in the ofﬁce of the examining magistrate. ]

Firstly: Just how far from justice it is to call the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students, 
who are innocent and have no connection with politics, a political society, 
which is completely baseless and never even occurred to us, and to accuse 
the unfortunates who embraced the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and have no aim other than 
belief and the hereafter, of publishing works for that society, or being active 
ofﬁcers or members of it, or of reading the R i s a l e - i   N u r  or teaching it to oth-
ers, or of writing it out, thus deeming them guilty of some crime, and to send 
them to court - a proof of how far this is from justice is as follows:

In accordance with the principles of freedom of thought and freedom of 
scholarship, those who read the harmful works written to oppose the Qur’an 
by  Doctor  Dozy  and  other  atheists  are  not  considered  to  have  committed 
crimes, yet those who have great need to learn the truths of the Qur’an and 
belief  and  long  to  do  so,  and  read  and  write  out  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  which 
teaches those truths as clearly as daylight, are considered guilty of crimes. 
Also, they based their allegations on a few sentences in one or two treatises 
which  we  had  treated  as  conﬁdential  before  they  were  exhibited  in  court 
so  that  among  a  hundred  other  treatises  a  wrong  meaning  should  not  be 
given  them,  and  accusations  were  made  concerning  them.  However,  with 
the  exception  of  one  of  those  treatises,  Eskişehir  Court  scrutinized  them 
and objected to only one or two matters in the  Tr e a t i s e   o n   I s l a m i c   D r e s s , 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

399

and  the  exception  is  replied  to  extremely  decisively  in  both  my  petition 
and  my  objections  to  the  indictment;  and  the  fact  that  “ we  have  light  in 
our hands, not the club of politics ” was proved conclusively from twenty 
angles in Eskişehir Court; and Denizli Court scrutinized all the treatises of 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  without exception and did not object to any of them. Nev-
ertheless, those unfair prosecutors extended those three or four sentences to 
the whole R i s a l e - i   N u r , and just as they conﬁscated the four-hundred-page 
Z ü l ﬁ k â r  because of two pages, so they stated those who read and write out 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  were guilty of a crime and accused myself of contesting the 
government. I call on those close to me and the friends who meet with me to 
testify that for more than ten years, apart from two leaders, one deputy, and 
the governor of Kastamonu, I have have not known who the leaders of the 
government were, or who its ministers, commanders, ofﬁcials, and deputies 
were, and I have shown no curiosity to ﬁnd out. However, one or two years 
ago, one or two persons displayed an interest in me and I learnt of ﬁve or 
six of the leading members of the government. Is it in any way possible for 
someone not to know the people he is contesting, and to have no wish to 
know them, to attach no importance to learning whether they are friend or 
foe? It is understood from this that they dream up totally baseless pretexts to 
ruin me whatever happens.

Since that is the case, I say not to the court here but to those unjust peo-
ple: I don’t give tuppence for your severest penalty; it has no importance 
whatsoever. For I am seventy-ﬁve years old and have one foot in the grave. 
To exchange one or two years of innocent life of persecution for the rank 
of martyrdom would be the greatest happiness for me. Thanks to the thou-
sands of proofs of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , I believe with the utmost certainty that 
for us death is our discharge papers. Even if outwardly it is execution, for 
us one hour’s distress would be the key to eternal happiness and mercy. But 
as for you, covert, cruel enemies who confuse the judiciary on account of 
atheism and preoccupy the government with us for no reason! Be certain of 
this and tremble! For you are being condemned to eternal annihilation and 
everlasting solitary conﬁnement. We see that our revenge is being taken on 
you in compounded fashion. We pity you even. Yes, surely the reality of 
death, which has emptied this town a hundred times into the graveyard has 
demands greater than life. To ﬁnd a way of being delivered from its certain 
execution is the greatest human need, more important than anything. Those 
who  on  trite  pretexts  impute  guilt  to  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students,  who  have 
found this way for themselves, and to the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which provides that 

400

THE RAYS

way with thousands of proofs, -how guilty they are themselves in the eyes of 
truth and justice even lunatics would understand.

There are three matters which deceive these unjust people and give rise to 

the delusion of a political society, which is completely irrelevant:

T h e   F i r s t :  The fact that since early days my students have been fervently 
attached to me like brothers, has given rise to the erroneous impression of 
a society.

T h e   S e c o n d :  Some of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students have acted as though they 
were an Islamic group, such as is found everywhere and is permitted by the 
laws of the republic and is not harassed by it, and this has been imagined to 
be a society. But those limited three or four students have not intended any 
sort of political society, only to serve belief together sincerely as brothers 
and to support each other in working for the hereafter.

T h e   T h i r d :   Because  those  unfair  people  know  themselves  to  be  mis-
guided and overcome by love of this world, and because they ﬁnd some of 
the government’s laws convenient for themselves, they say to themselves: 
“ Most probably Said and his friends oppose the government’s laws, which 
suit our caprices, although such caprices are illicit, as they are in the eyes 
of civilization. In which case, they are a political society which opposes the 
government. ”

So I say: You wretches! If the world was eternal, and human beings were 
going to remain in it permanently, and their only duty was politics, perhaps 
there would be some meaning in your slander. But if I had undertaken this 
work with a view to politics, you would have found not ten sentences in a 
hundred treatises, but a thousand, to be political and combative. If to sup-
pose the impossible, like you we had been working with all our strength for 
worldly aims and pleasures and politics, which not even Satan could make 
anyone accept, even if it had been thus, since these twenty years there has 
been no incident in which we were involved, and the government looks not 
to the heart but to the hand, and all governments have ﬁerce opponents, you 
cannot deem us guilty in the name of the law. My last word is

[ After our acquittal in Denizli Court I lived alone and did not con-
cern myself with politics. This new affair, which has resulted in our 
being sent to Afyon Prison, is therefore unlawful in ten ways, as I 
shall explain. ]

The First: Although the R i s a l e - i  N u r  has been scrutinized by three courts 
and three committees of experts, and seven departments of government in 
Ankara  and  their  legal  bodies,  and  although  all  the  treatises  were  unani-
mously acquitted without opposition, and Said and his seventy-ﬁve compan-
ions were all acquitted without being sentenced to a single day’s imprison-
ment, to again seize those treatises as though they were pernicious writings 
is totally contrary to the law, as anyone the slightest bit reasonable would 
understand.

The Second: A man who lived for three and a half years all alone and a 
stranger in Emirdağ after having been acquitted, with his door locked from 
the outside and bolted on the inside, who accepted only one out of a hundred 
people on essential business, and even gave up the work of writing he had 
pursued for twenty years and wrote no more -he had the lock on his door 
smashed by detectives for political purposes and they broke in on him, but 
they could ﬁnd nothing other than an Arabic prayerbook and a wall-hanging. 
Anyone with even a grain of fairness would understand how illegal it was to 
harass him in this way.

ِ(cid:127)(cid:170)اَو  ِناَ(cid:143)ْ(cid:193) َ

The  Third:  As  he  said  in  court:  if  there  is  someone  who,  as  is  con-
ﬁrmed by seventy witnesses, for seven years knew nothing of the Second 
World  War  and  was  not  curious  about  it  nor  asked  about  it,  and  now  for 
ten  years  has  been  in  the  same  state  of  mind,  and  for  twenty-ﬁve  years 
has  read  no  newspaper  nor  listened  to  one,  and  for  thirty  years  has  said: 
ّ(cid:195)اِ(cid:92) ُذوُ(cid:150)َا and has avoided politics with all his strength, 
ِةَ(cid:126)اَ(cid:193) ّ
and  if  in  twenty-two  years  of  the  most  torturous  distress,  in  order  not  to 
attract  the  attention  of  politicians  or  become  involved  in  politics,  has  not 
once applied to the government to alleviate his conditions – if there is such 
a person, is it in conformity with any law to raid his place of seclusion as 
though he were plotting political intrigues, and cause him unheard of suf-
fering while he was ill? Anyone with an iota of conscience would pity him 
in that state!

The  Fourth:  Eskişehir  Court  studied  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   for  six  months 
because  we  had  been  charged  with  organizing  a  political  society  and 

ٰ
402

THE RAYS

founding a Suﬁ order, and due to that suspicion and because of the personal 
hatred towards us of the great leader it urged certain members of the judici-
ary to act against us, yet that court acquitted us of founding a political society 
and Suﬁ order and the R i s a l e - i   N u r  charges, and only making a pretext of a 
short piece called Tr e a t i s e   o n   I s l a m i c   D r e s s , gave sentences of six months to 
ﬁfteen out of a hundred students, not in accordance with the law but arbitrar-
ily. And although until the investigations had been completed they remained 
in prison for four and a half months, that is, they served prison sentences of 
one and a half months, and ten years later Denizli Court again on a number 
of pretexts like organizing a political society and founding a Suﬁ order, and 
after scrutinizing closely twenty years’ worth of letters and writings, sent 
ﬁve boxes of books to Ankara Criminal Court, and although those books and 
letters were the subject of two years’ close scrutiny by Ankara and Denizli 
Courts, they passed a unanimous decision for their acquittal concerning the 
political  society  and  Suﬁ  order  1  and  other  pretexts,  and  returned  all  the 
books  to  their  owners.  They  also  acquitted  Said  and  his  companions.  So 
anyone who has not lost his humanity will understand just how illegal it is to 
look on him as a political activist and accuse him of being a plotter, and to 
provoke the ofﬁcers of the court against him.

The Fifth: Because of the compassion which is the basis of my way and 
that of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and for thirty years has been a principle by which I 
have lived, I do not censure the tyrants who persecute me so that no harm 
comes  to  the  innocent,  let  alone  cursing  them.  Even  when  angry  at  some 
of those depraved wretches who oppress me out of vicious hatred, or even 
the irreligious tyrants, my compassion prevents me from responding with a 
curse, let alone physically. For those cruel tyrants have parents and children; 
I do nothing to them so that no material harm comes to those four or ﬁve 
elderly  unfortunates  and  innocents.  Sometimes  I  even  forgive  them.  It  is 
because of this compassion that I absolutely never interfere in government 
or disturb public order. Moreover, I have recommended this so strongly to 

1.  The basis and aim of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is certain realized belief and the essential real-
ity of the Qur’an. For this reason, three courts of law have acquitted it in regard to being a 
t a r i k a t  ( Suﬁ order ). Furthermore, no person has said during these twenty years: “ Said has 
given me t a r i k a t  [ instruction ]. ” Also, a way to which for a thousand years most of this 
nation’s forefathers have been bound may not made something for which [ the members of 
the nation ] are answerable. Also, those who combat successfully those covert dissemblers 
who attach the name of t a r i k a t  to the reality of Islam and attack this nation’s religion, may 
not themselves be accused of being a t a r i k a t . As for a society or community, it is a frater-
nity which looks to the hereafter within Islamic brotherhood. It is not a political society, as 
three courts have ruled. They have acquitted it in that respect.

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

403

all my friends that some of the fair-minded police of three provinces have 
admitted that “the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students are police of a sort; they preserve 
order and maintain public security. ” There are thousands of witnesses to this 
fact, and they have conﬁrmed it through twenty years’ experience and thou-
sands of students have corroborated it by never having been involved in any 
incident recorded by the police, so which law permits that unhappy man’s 
house to be raided as though he were a revolutionary and k o m i t a d j i , and for 
pitiless men to insult him, and despite not ﬁnding anything in his house, as 
though he were a multiple criminal gather up his most precious, miraculous 
Qur’an and the inscriptions hanging on his wall as though they were perni-
cious writings? What beneﬁt demands turning thousands of religious people 
who thus serve public order with their good morals against government and 
public order because of some baseless suspicion?

The Sixth: Endless thanks be to Allah that thirty years ago, through His 
grace and the effulgence of the Qur’an, a person realized just how valueless 
and meaningless are the ﬂeeting fame and glory of this world, and its egotis-
tical self-admiration and celebrity, and since that time has struggled with all 
his strength against his evil-commanding soul, and to be self-effacing and 
give up egotism, and not to be artiﬁcial and hypocritical. Those who have 
served him or befriended him are perfectly certain of this and testify to it. 
For twenty years he has ﬂed with all his might from people’s good opinions 
and their attention, which everyone takes too much pleasure in, and contrary 
to everyone else has rejected praise and acclaim and being accorded a spir-
itual rank. He has also rejected the excessively good opinions of him of his 
closest brothers, and has wounded their feelings by not accepting the praise 
and commendation expressed in their letters. He has shown himself to be 
devoid of virtue, and has ascribed all virtue to the R i s a l e - i   N u r , a Qur’anic 
commentary, and hence to the collective personality of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  stu-
dents, thinking of himself as only a lowly servant. This proves that he has 
not tried to make himself liked, and he has not wanted to and has rejected it. 
So under what law has he been deemed guilty because without his consent 
some of his friends in a distant place had an excessively good opinion of him 
and eulogized him and awarded him a high spiritual rank; and because of 
what a preacher said in the region of Kütahya whom he does not know; and 
because of a letter with a forged signature which had been sent to Kütahya, 
where  I  have  never  sent  any  letter;  and  because  of  an  offensive  book  in 
Balıkesir,  the  author  of  which  is  unknown?  Would  any  law  in  the  world 
permit sending ofﬁcials to break the lock of a wretched, aged, ill stranger’s 

404

THE RAYS

room as though he had committed a serious crime, and allow them to justify 
this by ﬁnding only a book of supplications and a wall- hanging? Would any 
politics allow such aggression?

The Seventh: Would any law permit for an unfortunate who, although at 
this time inside the country when there are so many lively political parties 
and currents, internal and external, and the ground is ready to take advantage 
of this, that is, to win numerous diplomats and politicians as supporters in 
place of his handful of friends, told all his friends, solely in order not to get 
involved in politics, nor damage his sincerity, nor attract the government’s 
attention to himself, nor to become preoccupied with the world: “ Beware! 
Don’t  get  carried  away  by  those  political  currents!  Don’t  get  involved  in 
politics! Don’t disturb public order! ”; and although two currents caused him 
harm and distress because he withdrew in this way, the old one because of its 
groundless fears, and the new, because it says he does not help it – despite all 
this he never interfered in the worldly’s world and was busy with his life of 
the hereafter, and wrote not even one letter in twenty-two years to his own 
brother in the village of Nurs in his native region, nor ten letters in twenty 
years to his friends in those provinces – so which law permits that anyone 
intervenes to this extent with his preoccupation with the hereafter?

Would any law permit collecting up copies of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , in which 
three courts of law have found nothing indictable, although under the liberty 
laws the publications of those without religion and the communists are not 
interfered with despite being extremely harmful for the country and nation 
and  morality.  For  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   has  been  striving  for  twenty  years  to 
maintain the country and nation’s social life and morality and security; and 
has been effectively struggling to regain for this nation its true support, the 
Islamic world’s brotherhood and its friendship, and to strengthen these; and 
such parts of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  as  Z ü l ﬁ k â r  and  T h e   S t a f f   o f   M o s e s   (   Â s â - y ı  
M û s a   ) , which having been studied for three months by the Directorate of 
Religious Affairs on the orders of the Minister for Internal Affairs for the 
purpose of having it criticized, fully appreciated its value and had it put in 
the  department  library  as  “ an  important  work; ”  and  T h e   S t a f f   o f   M o s e s ,  
which  was  placed  on  the  tomb  of  the  Prophet  Muhammad  ( Upon  whom 
be blessings and peace ), as a sign of its acceptance was seen there by the 
Hajjis. Would any law, conscience, or justice permit these to be collected up 
as though they were injurious papers and sent to court?

The Eighth: Then a person who although he was given complete free-
dom  after  twenty-two  years  of  distressing  and  unjustiﬁed  exile,  did  not 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

405

return to his native region where he had thousands of friends and relations, 
but preferred solitude and exile so that he should have no contact with social 
life and politics; and who gave up the very meritorious congregation of the 
mosque in preferance to performing the prayers on his own and remaining 
in his room; that is, his state of mind made him avoid the people’s adulation; 
and as is testiﬁed to by twenty years of his life and conﬁrmed by thousands 
of valuable Turks, preferred one pious Turk to numerous negligent Kurds, 
and who even proved in court that he would not exchange a hundred negli-
gent Kurds for one Turkish brother with powerful belief like Hafız Ali; and 
who in order not to be the object of their respect and veneration, never met 
with people so long as it was not essential and did not go to the mosque; 
and for forty years has worked with all his strength and all his works for 
Islamic brotherhood and so that Muslims would love one another; and who, 
since the Turkish nation is the Qur’an’s standard-bearer and is praised by 
the Qur’an, has great love for that nation and has passed his life among its 
people  -in  order  to  insult  this  person  with  the  tongue  of  ofﬁcialdom  and 
make propaganda and scare away his friends, the former governor said: “ He 
is a Kurd and you are Turks. He is a Shaﬁ‘i and you are Hanaﬁ’s, ” trying to 
frighten everyone into abandoning him. And although over twenty years and 
in two courts he was not forced to change his manner of dress, and the army 
peaked cap was modiﬁed, a brimmed hat was forcibly placed on the head of 
that recluse – what beneﬁt is there is all this? What law permits it?

The Ninth: is very important, 1 and very powerful, but it touches on poli-

tics so I am remaining silent.

The  Tenth:  This  is  an  attack,  which  no  law  permits,  and  is  without 
advantage,  and  is  only  making  mountains  out  of  molehills  due  to  some 
meaningless delusion, and is no part of any law. Concerning this too I am 
remaining silent so as not to touch on politics, which according to our way 
we are unconcerned with.

In the face of treatment which is thus illegal in ten ways, all we say is 
( 3:173 ) Ø × Ö Õ

S a i d   N u r s i

1.  The fact that there were Christians and Jews in Islamic governments, and Muslims 
in  Christian  and  Zoroastrian  governments  shows  that  opponents  who  do  disturb  public 
order or interfere in government cannot be legally interfered with. Moreover, one is not 
answerable for possibilities. Otherwise everyone would have to be sent to court and tried 
because of possibility, for everyone might kill other people.

406

THE RAYS

I have a few more points I want to submit to
the authorities of Afyon, and to its Court and Police

The First: Most of the prophets appearing in the East and in Africa, and 
most of the philosophers emerging in the West and in Europe is a sign of 
pre-eternal divine determining that in Asia religion is dominant and philoso-
phy is in second place. In consequence, even if those ruling in Asia are not 
religious, they should not interfere with those who work for religion; they 
should encourage them.

The Second: The All-Wise Qur’an is the intellect and power of thought 
of  the  head  of  the  earth.  If,  I  seek  refuge  with  Allah,  the  Qur’an  were  to 
depart from the globe, the globe would go mad. It is not far from reason to 
suppose that another planet colliding with its head emptied of reason, would 
cause  doomsday  to  erupt.  Yes,  the  Qur’an  is  a  chain,  a  “ rope  of  Allah, ” 
binding the earth to the divine throne. It preserves the earth more than grav-
ity.  Thus,  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  which  is  a  true  and  powerful  commentary  on 
the Qur’an of Mighty Stature, is a supreme divine bounty which has been 
demonstrating its effectiveness for twenty years in this century, an insup-
pressible  miracle  of  the  Qur’an.  The  government  therefore  should  not  be 
interfering in it and trying to scare its students away from it, but protecting 
it and encouraging people to read it.

The Third: In Denizli Court I said the following in connection with all 
the believers assisting with prayers for forgiveness those who have departed 
for the past, and their bequeathing good works on their spirits:

When you are asked by millions of believing plaintiffs at the Supreme 
Tribunal: “ Why did you want to ruin with imprisonment and persecution the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  students, who were striving to save the country and nation from 
anarchy  and  irreligion  and  immorality  and  their  compatriots  from  eternal 
annihilation, although because of the liberty laws you looked tolerantly on 
the publications of atheists and communists and political societies that pro-
duce anarchists, and did not bother them? ” What answer will you and those 
who want to convict and ruin the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students, who serve the truths 
of the Qur’an, give? I am asking you the same thing! I said that to them and 
those just and fair-minded people acquitted us, demonstrating the fairness of 
the judicial system.

The Fourth: I was expecting to be taken for interrogation to a place of 
consultation, in either Ankara or Afyon, where questions would be asked 
and  answered  about  matters  of  overriding  importance  and  the  R i s a l e -
i   N u r ’s  relation  to  them.  Yes,  matters  connected  with  ﬁnding  ways  of 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

407

restoring the brotherhood, love, and good will of three hundred and ﬁfty 
million  Muslims  for  this  nation  and  country,  and  their  moral  assistance 
for it. An indication that the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  is the most effective means of 
achieving this is the following:

In Mecca this year, a scholar of great eminence translated the main col-
lections of the R i s a l e - i  N u r  into both one of the Indian languages and Arabic, 
and sending them to India and Arabia, said: “ Just as he strives through the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r   to  secure  unity  and  Islamic  brotherhood,  our  most  powerful 
support, so he demonstrates that the Turkish nation is always progressive in 
religion and belief. ”

I  was  also  expecting  that  momentous  questions  would  be  asked  like 
“ What is the extent of the service the R i s a l e - i   N u r  can provide in the face of 
the danger communism poses to this country, because it turns into anarchy? 
How can this blessed country be defended against this terrible torrent? ” It 
should have been thus, but having been blown up out of all proportion due 
to  the  petty  and  personal  slander  of  the  spiteful,  matters  holding  not  the 
slightest importance and which are in no way crimes, were discussed, which 
caused me distress in these serious conditions, the like of which I have never 
before  suffered  in  my  life.  Meaningless  questions  were  asked  about  one 
or two minor personal matters which three previous courts had previously 
examined then acquitted.

The Fifth: The R i s a l e - i   N u r  cannot be contested or defeated. It has been 
silencing the most obdurate philosophers for twenty years. It demonstrates 
the truths of belief as clearly as the sun. The rulers of this country should 
proﬁt from its strength.

The Sixth: Destroying my unimportant character because of my personal 
faults, and through contemptuous treatment poisoning public opinion about 
me does not harm the R i s a l e - i   N u r , in fact it strengthens it in some ways. For 
in place of my mortal tongue are the undying tongues of a hundred thousand 
copies of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and they cannot be silenced; they will speak out. 
And as they have up to now, the thousands of powerful tongues of its sincere 
students will continue that sacred, universal service till the end of the world, 
Allah willing.

The  Seventh:  As  I  stated  in  the  previous  trials  putting  forward  the 
proofs, our enemies and those who oppose us both ofﬁcially and unofﬁcially, 
deceiving the government, making some of its leading members suspicious 
about us and causing the judiciary to move against us, are either seriously 
deceived or have been deceived by others, or are exceedingly treacherous

THE RAYS

revolutionaries  working  on  account  of  anarchy,  or  cunning  atheists  strug-
gling  against  Islam  and  the  truths  of  the  Qur’an  on  account  of  apostasy. 
Calling absolute despotism “ the republic ” in order to attack us, and mak-
ing the regime a screen to absolute apostasy, and calling absolute dissipa-
tion “ civilization, ” and calling arbitrary compulsion on account of disbelief 
“ the law, ” they have both ruined us, and deceived the government, and pre-
occupied the judiciary with us for no reason. Referring them to the wrath 
of the All-Compelling and Glorious One, we take refuge in the citadel of 
Ø × Ö Õ so as to defend ourselves against their evil.

The Eighth: Last year the Russians sent numerous people to make the 
Hajj as propaganda in order to show that they are more respectful towards 
the  Qur’an  than  other  nations  and,  because  of  religion,  to  try  to  turn  the 
Islamic world against the religious people of this country. But the main col-
lections of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  were being spread at that time in both Mecca, 
and Medina, and Damascus, and Egypt, and Aleppo, attracting the appre-
ciation of the religious scholars, which both negated the communist propa-
ganda, and showed to the Islamic world that like formerly the Turkish nation 
and  its  brothers  are  supporting  religion  and  the  Qur’an  and  are  the  elder 
brothers  of  the  other  peoples  of  Islam  and  their  heroic  commander  in  the 
service of the Qur’an. Those collections from the R i s a l e - i   N u r  demonstrated 
this in those sacred centres. Will it not the bring the earth to anger if this 
valuable national service of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is responded to with torments 
in this way?

The Ninth is a brief summary of a matter that was proved and elucidated 

in my defence in Denizli.

If through his genius and intelligence a great military commander arro-
gates to himself all the positive virtues of the army and ascribes to the army 
his own negative evils, the courageous actions and virtues of the soldiers, 
which equal them in number, will be reduced to one, while the commander’s 
evils will be equal in number to the soldiers, which is an awesome wrong 
and contrary to the truth. This being so, I said to the public prosecutor in 
our  previous  trials,  who  was  attacking  me  because  of  the  slap  a  Hadith  I 
expounded forty years earlier dealt that person: “ It’s true I’m offending him 
due to predictions made by Hadiths, but I’m also defending the army’s hon-
our and preserving him from serious error. As for you, for the sake of one 
single  friend  of  yours,  you  are  affronting  the  honour  of  the  army,  which 
is  the  Qur’an’s  standard-bearer  and  an  heroic  commander  of  the  Islamic 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

409

world. ” Allah willing, the prosecutor saw the matter more fairly and was 
saved from his error.

The Tenth: It is because in the administration of justice the essence of 
justice and the rights of everyone who applies have to preserved without dis-
crimination and the duty of those involved is to work solely for the sake of 
right, that during his caliphate, Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) 
sat  together  with  a  Jew  in  court  and  they  were  tried  together.  On  another 
occasion, a just judge saw that an ofﬁcial was angry with a delinquent thief 
when he was cutting off his hand as demanded by the law. He immediately 
sacked the ofﬁcial, and full of regret said: “ Ofﬁcials who up to now have 
been inﬂuenced by their feelings in this way while executing the law have 
perpetrated  great  wrongs. ”  Yes,  even  if  in  executing  the  law  he  does  not 
pity the convicted man, he should not be angry; if he is, he is acting tyranni-
cally. If he carries out capital punishment angrily, even if it is in retaliation 
(   k ı s a s   ) , he becomes a sort of murderer. ”

Thus,  in  courts  of  law  it  is  this  pure,  unbiased  truth  which  rules.  But 
although three courts have acquitted us, and perhaps if they knew, ninety 
per cent of this nation would testify that the Risale-i Nur students are harm-
less  and  beneﬁcial  for  nation  and  country,  the  students  are  being  angrily 
and  contemptuously  mistreated,  despite  being  innocent  and  much  in  need 
of consolation and the indulgence of the law. But since we have decided to 
meet every calamity and insult with patience and forbearance, we are silent, 
referring it to Allah and saying: “ Perhaps there is some good in this. ” How-
ever, I was afraid that these innocent unfortunates being treated in this way 
due to unfounded suspicions and the malicious reports of informers would 
lead to the visitation of disaster, and I was therefore obliged to write this. 
Anyway, if there is any fault in this matter, it is mine. These unfortunates 
assisted me solely seeking Allah’s pleasure and to save their religious belief 
and lives in the hereafter. For them to receive such treatment when they were 
deserving of praise and appreciation, is enough to make anyone angry.

Moreover, it is amazing, but again they are making unsupported asser-
tions about a political society. However, both three courts have scrutinized 
this aspect of the case and acquitted us, and neither the courts, nor the police, 
nor  the  experts’  committees  have  discovered  any  sign  of  any  society  that 
could justify such an accusation: the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students are a brotherhood 
which  looks  to  the  hereafter,  like  the  students  of  a  teacher,  or  university 
students, or the students of a Qur’an teacher who is teaching them to memo-
rize the Qur’an. Those who have made charges against them calling them 

410

THE RAYS

a  political  society,  have  to  look  on  all  tradesmen,  preachers,  and  school-
children as belonging to such societies. I therefore see no necessity to defend 
those imprisoned here as a result of such meaningless and baseless charges.
However, there is nothing at all to prevent me defending the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
with the same facts that I have defended it with three times previously, for it 
closely concerns both this country and the Islamic world, and it is the beneﬁ-
cial cause of plenty and blessings, material and spiritual, for this nation and 
country. No law or politics prohibits this or could prohibit it.

Yes, we are a society, but we a society which every century has three 
hundred and ﬁfty million members. Every day with the obligatory prayers, 
its members demonstrate ﬁve times with perfect veneration their attachment 
to the principles of that sacred society, and their wish to serve it. In accord-
ance  with  the  sacred  programme  of  ( 49:10 ) ¯ ® ¬  they  hasten 
with their supplications and spiritual gains to assist one another. Yes, we are 
members of that holy and vast society. And our particular duty is to convey 
in  conﬁrmatory  form  to  the  people  of  belief  the  Qur’anic  truths  of  faith, 
and save them and ourselves from eternal annihilation and perpetual solitary 
conﬁnement in the Intermediate Realm. We have absolutely no connection 
with  any  worldly,  political,  plotting  society,  political  or  revolutionary,  as 
has  been  imputed  to  us;  we  do  not  condescend  to  any  such  meaningless, 
purposeless secret society. In any event, four courts of law have investigated 
this down to the ﬁnest details, and then acquitted us concerning it.

My written objections, which form a supplement and addition 
to my defence, and were sent to six departments of govern-
ment in Ankara, and presented to Afyon Criminal Court

I  say  this  to  Afyon  Court:  Enough  now!  My  patience  is  exhausted!  It 
is a cruel and unprecedented wrong that in addition to having harassed me 
for twenty-two years without reason by holding me under constant surveil-
lance in exile in total isolation and solitary conﬁnement, to have illegally 
imprisoned the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students three times and caused us the loss of 
hundreds of thousands of liras because of unfounded suspicions and utiliz-
ing possibilities instead of facts. And this, in spite of the fact that other than 
two or three matters six courts have been unable to ﬁnd anything contrary 
to the law in the hundred parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . The future and its gen-
erations will curse the tyrants who have been responsible for it. Up to now 
I have found consolation since it is my conviction that they will condemn 
them and cast them down to the depths of Hell at the Last Judgement, and 
holding my silence I have endured it. Otherwise, we could have defended 
our rights to the full.

Six courts over ﬁfteen years have scrutinized the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  and our 
correspondence, and ﬁve of them in effect acquitted us on all points. Only 
Eskişehir  Court  made  a  pretext  of  ﬁve  or  ten  words  in  the  short  treatise 
about the veiling of women, a single matter, and gave a light sentence under 
a ﬂexible law. When they did this, I wrote the following in the correction 
which after the Appeal Court I sent ofﬁcially to Ankara as the sole example 
of illegality:

A long time ago, following the consensus and rulings of three hundred 
and ﬁfty thousand Qur’anic commentaries, I expounded the Qur’anic verses 
about the veiling of women, which for one thousand three hundred and ﬁfty 
years have taught and enjoined a powerful, perpetual Islamic practice and 
sacred principle of three hundred and ﬁfty million people, in order to defend 
them  against  an  atheist’s  objections  and  his  criticisms  of  Qur’anic  civili-
zation. If there is any justice in the world, the court will surely quash the 
conviction of someone and the sentence passed on him for expounding the 
verses, since he was following the way taken by our forefathers for one thou-
sand three hundred and ﬁfty years; it will surely remove this extraordinary 
stain from the legal establishment of this Islamic state.

412

THE RAYS

I wrote this in the addendum containing my corrections and showed it to 
the public prosecutor. He was horriﬁed and said: “ There is no need for this. 
Your sentence was short and only a small part of it remains. There is no need 
to send this. ”

Thus, you have understood the truly strange examples like this one in my 
defence and objection, which has been presented to you and the departments 
of government in Ankara. What I seek and hope from Afyon Court is this: 
I await from you in the name of true justice that you decide on the com-
plete freedom of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , whose service and effulgence proﬁts the 
nation and country as much as an army. Otherwise, I have to inform you that 
when the ﬁve or ten of my friends who were sent to prison because of their 
relations with me are released, I have the idea of committing some offence 
which will necessitate the heaviest penalty, compelling me to bid farewell to 
this life. It is like this:

Although for the good of the country and nation, the government should 
give me full protection and assist me, the fact that it is pressurizing me sug-
gests that part of the communist organization and the secret atheistic society 
that have been working against me these last forty years, with which it has 
now  combined,  have  both  gained  control  of  important  positions,  and  are 
opposing me. It worries me, for there are numerous signs that the govern-
ment either does not know of this, or it is permitting it.

Chairman of the Court! With your permission, I shall ask you a question 
about which I am extremely curious: why, although I have in no way been 
involved in politics, have the politicians deprived me of all civil rights, all 
liberties, and even all the rights of life? And why have they forbidden my 
very careful brothers and loyal assistants to have any contact with me, who 
tried to protect me against those plans to assassinate me while I was being 
held for three and a half months in total isolation, and to defend me against 
my covert enemies who have poisoned me eleven times, and have even pre-
vented me, although I am elderly, alone, in exile, and ill, from studying my 
blessed, harmless books, which I always had with me?

I  pleaded  with  the  public  prosecutor  to  give  me  my  books,  but  he  did 
not give them although he promised. They compelled me to remain alone 
in  a  huge,  locked,  and  freezing  ward  with  nothing  to  occupy  myself,  and 
instead of the ofﬁcials and menials concerned being friendly and comfort-
ing,  they  quite  simply  encouraged  them  to  look  on  me  hostilely.  A  small 
example is this: I wrote a petition to the prison governor, public prosecutor, 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

413

and chairman of the court, and sent it to one of my brothers to write out since 
I do not know the new letters. It was written and was given to them. Then, 
as though I had committed some heinous crime, they nailed up my windows. 
The smoke from the stove was a great discomfort to me, and I insisted that 
they left one window open. Now they have nailed that up too. Also, although 
according  to  prison  practice,  solitary  conﬁnement  usually  lasts  around  a 
fortnight, I was in total isolation for three and a half months and they did 
not allow any of my friends to have any contact with me. Also, three months 
ago a forty-page indictment was written against me, and they showed it to 
me. But I do not know the new letters, and I was ill, and my own writing is 
very poor, so I pleaded with them to let two of my students come, who know 
my language, and could read the indictment and write out my objections to 
it. But they did not permit it. They said: “ The defence lawyer should come 
and read it. ” Then they did not permit him either. Only, they told one of my 
brothers to write it out in the old letters and give it to me. But it would take 
six or seven days to write out those forty pages. To make the hour’s work of 
reading me the indictment stretch over six or seven days, just so that no one 
should have contact with me, is appalling repression and deprives me of my 
right of defence entirely. A multiple murderer condemned to be hanged does 
not receive such treatment. I truly suffer extreme distress since I know of no 
reason for this unprecedented torment. I heard that the chairman of the court 
is fair-minded and kind. I have therefore for the ﬁrst and last time written 
this petition and complaint.

S a i d   N u r s i
who is ill, wretched, and 
in total isolation.

* * *

The Indictment contains four basic points concerning me

First Point: I consider myself to be a regenerator of religion, as though I 

were proud and self- seeking.

I reject this with all my strength. Moreover, all my brothers will testify 
that I have never accepted anyone’s suggestion that I was the Mahdi. In fact, 
when the experts’ committee of Denizli Court said “ If Said was to declare 
himself Mahdi, all his students would accept it, ” Said stated in his objec-
tions, saying: “ I am not a Sayyid, and the Mahdi will be a Sayyid, ” thus 
refuting them.

414

THE RAYS

Second Point: Publishing things secretly.
Our covert enemies should not misconstrue things, for there is nothing 
that  touches  on  politics  and  public  order.  Also,  they  should  not  make  the 
duplicating machine and the old letters a pretext. Six courts of law and vari-
ous departments of government in Ankara understood the blow dealt by the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  1 at Mustafa Kemal, and they did not bother about it and acquit-
ted us, returning all our books to us including the Fifth Ray. Moreover, his 
bad deeds were pointed out in order to preserve the army’s worth. One per-
son was disliked in order to affectionately praise the army.

The Third: “ He encourages the breaching of public security. ”
This extraordinary accusation is refuted by the facts that over a period 
of twenty years six courts and the police of ten provinces have not recorded 
a single instance when any of the hundred thousand Nurju’s and hundred 
thousand copies of parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  breached public security or dis-
turbed public order, and they have not found any such thing. It is meaning-
less to reply to a few unimportant matters in this new indictment, for three 
courts  of  law  have  acquitted  us  on  these  very  points  and  they  have  been 
replied to repeatedly. Since charging us with these matters is the equivalent 
of charging Ankara Criminal Court and the courts of Denizli and Eskişehir, 
which acquitted us concerning them, I leave it to them to reply. But there are 
two or three further matters.

T h e   F i r s t :  Although it was studied for two years in the closest detail by 
Denizli and Ankara Criminal Courts and they acquitted us and returned the 
book, this Indictment applies one or two matters in the Fifth Ray to a com-
mander  who  is  dead  and  gone  and  shows  them  to  be  indictable  offences. 

1.  The wrong meaning has been given in the indictment, for it has deemed an offence 
some instances of the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s wonderworking (   k e r â m e t   )  which took the form of 
slaps. As though disasters like the earthquakes that occur when the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is attacked 
are blows dealt by the R i s a l e - i   N u r . Allah forbid! We never said such a thing, nor wrote it. 
What we said in many places supported by proof was that like acceptable almsgiving, the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  is a means of repulsing disasters. Whenever it is attacked, it hides itself; then 
calamities seize the opportunity and assault us. Yes, conﬁrmed by thousands of  R i s a l e - i  
N u r  students and what they have observed, supported by hundreds of incidents and events 
and their coincidences,* which in no way could have been attributed to chance, as well as 
numerous indications and coincidences of the Qur’an, some of which were even pointed 
out in court, I have formed the certain conviction that those coincidences are a divine be-
stowal indicating the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s acceptability and are a sort of wonder of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  on account of the Qur’an. 

* Coincidences  (   t e v â f u k a t   ) : the unintentional correspondence of words or letters in 
lines or patterns on one or several pages, or the coinciding of apparently unrelated events. 
[ Tr. ]

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

415

So we say: absolutely no law can deem it an offence to make a fair, general 
criticism which might be made applicable to a person who dead and gone 
and has no connection with the government.

Manipulating the facts, the prosecution has taken one aspect of that gen-
eral interpretation and applied it to that commander. No law can consider it 
a crime if one hundredth of a meaning which may be understood as refer-
ring to someone is found in a conﬁdential and private treatise. Moreover, 
the treatise expounds allegorical Hadiths in wondrous fashion. Since those 
explanations  were  written  thirty  or  forty  years  ago,  and  decisive  answers 
have been given in my defence and objections, which have been presented 
to three other courts besides yours and to six departments of government in 
Ankara, and have received no criticism, surely it cannot be considered to be 
at variance with any law if explanations of the Hadith’s true meaning turn 
out to ﬁt a faulty individual.

Also, the merits of the reforms in which that person had a part, the faults 
of which he was the cause, are not only his, they are also the army’s and the 
government’s. He only had a share of them. Just as it is surely not a crime to 
criticize him for his faults, so it cannot be said that it is attacking the reforms. 
Also could it possibly be a crime not to like someone who turned the Aya 
Sophia Mosque into a house of idols -despite its being an eternal source of 
this heroic nation’s honour, and shining like a jewel in its j i h a d  and service 
of the Qur’an, and being a vast and precious souvenir of the nation’s swords- 
and who also transformed the Şeyhülislam’s Ofﬁce into a girls’ high school?

The Second Matter with which I am charged in the indictment

Three courts of law have acquitted me on this matter; and as I pointed out 
forty years ago when elucidating the wondrous interpretation of a Hadith, 
the  Şeyhülislam  of  men  and  jinn,  Zembilli  ‘Ali  Efendi,  stated:  “ It  is  not 
permissible to put a brimmed hat on one’s head, even as a joke, ” and all the 
Şeyhülislams  and  all  the  Islamic  ulema  considered  it  impermissible.  The 
mass of Muslims were therefore in danger when they were forced to wear 
such hats ( that is, they either had to renounce their religion or rebel ); but 
since in one section of the Fifth Ray, which was written forty years ago, it 
says “ The wearing of the brimmed hat will be enforced, and prostration in 
prayer will be forbidden. But the faith in the heads of those wearing it will 
make the hat prostrate, Allah willing, making it Muslim, ” it saved the mass 
of Muslims both from rebellion and revolt, and from voluntarily renounc-
ing their religion and belief; and although no law at all can propose such a 
thing to those living in seclusion; and in twenty years none of six provin-
cial authorities have forced me to wear it; and ofﬁcials in their ofﬁces and 

416

THE RAYS

women and children and people in the mosques and the majority of villagers 
are  not  compelled  to  wear  it;  and  it  has  now  been  ofﬁcially  taken  off  the 
soldiers’ heads; and in many provinces now berets and knitted hats are not 
prohibited; nevertheless, it has been put forward as a reason for the convic-
tion of myself and my brothers. Could any law in the world, any principle, 
any good, consider this completely meaningless charge to be a crime?

The Third Matter with which I am charged

Incitement to breach public security in Emirdağ. My objection to this is 

as follows:

F i r s t l y  is my irrefutable list of objections, which has been presented to 
the  court  here  and  to  six  departments  of  government  in  Ankara  with  this 
court’s knowledge and permission. I am now stating it exactly in answer to 
the indictment.

S e c o n d l y :  As is testiﬁed to by all those who met with me in Emirdağ and 
is conﬁrmed by its people and police, in my solitude I avoided involvement 
in  politics  with  all  my  power.  I  even  gave  up  writing  and  corresponding 
with others. I wrote nothing apart from two pieces, one on repetition in the 
Qur’an, the other about the angels. And I used to write one letter a week to 
one place to encourage people in the R i s a l e - i   N u r . In fact, in three years I 
wrote only three or four letters to my own brother, who is a mufti and for 
twenty years was with me as my student, and was very anxious about me, 
and  sent  me  congratulations  for  the  religious  festivals.  And  although  for 
twenty  years  I  have  not  written  once  to  my  brother  who  is  in  my  native 
region, I am accused in the indictment of breaching security, and once again, 
of “ opposing the reforms. ” In reply I say this:

The fact that in twenty years six courts of law and the police of ten prov-
inces connected with the matter have not recorded any incident involving 
the disturbance of public order and breaching of security in connection with 
the twenty thousand or perhaps a hundred thousand people who enthusiasti-
cally read the twenty thousand copies of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , shows that it looks 
on a single possibility out of thousands as being established fact. But if there 
is no sign of anything concerning one possibility out of two or three, there 
can be no crime. And it is not one possibility out of thousands, but everyone 
including the prosecutor who attacks me, could kill numerous people; they 
could disturb public peace and order on account of communism, and breach 
security. That is to say, it is contempt of court and the law to put forward 
extraordinary and exaggerated possibilities in place of actualities.

Furthermore, every government has opponents. It is no crime to oppose 
a  government  purely  intellectually.  The  government  looks  to  the  hand, 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

417

not to the heart. Especially someone who has performed great services for 
this country and nation and caused no harm, and latterly played no part in 
the life of society, but has been made to live in absolute isolation, and whose 
works have been appreciated and applauded in the most important centres 
of the Islamic world. 1 I fear that those who level these quite extraordinary, 
groundless accusations at such persons are unknowingly being exploited on 
account of anarchy, indeed, communism.

I have understood from certain signs that with the idea of belittling the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r   and  due  to  groundless  suspicions  about  the  Mahdi  question, 
which has political associations, our covert enemies are investigating com-
pletely baseless suggestions that the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is being exploited for this. 
Perhaps it is because of these suspicions that I am made to suffer such tor-
ments. I say to those tyrannical secret enemies and to those who listen to 
them out of hostility to us: Allah forbid! Again, Allah forbid! Both my sev-
enty-ﬁve-year life, and especially these last thirty years, and the one hundred 
and thirty parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and the thousands of people who have 
offered me their sincere friendship testify that at no time have I overstepped 
my mark in such a way and made the truths of belief a means of winning 
rank, fame, and renown for myself.

Yes, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students know and I have pointed out proofs of it in 
the courts that, not to gain for myself any position or fame, and win spiritual 
rank and a high rank in the hereafter, but in order to serve the believers with 
all my conviction and strength in the question of belief, I am ready to sacri-
ﬁce not only my life in this world and its transient ranks, but -if necessary- 
my  life  in  the  hereafter  and  its  everlasting  ranks,  which  everyone  seeks; 
and even, in order to be a means of saving certain unfortunates from Hell, -if 
necessary- to forgo Paradise and myself go to Hell. Just as my true brothers 

1.  In the eightieth of the hundred errors about these works in the indictment, the pros-

ecution says: “ The interpretations in the Fifth Ray are incorrect.” 

T h e   A n s w e r :  In the Fifth Ray, it is said: “ Allah knows best, one interpretation is this. ” 
What this means is: “ It is possible that one meaning of the Hadith is this. ” Logically, this 
cannot be proved wrong. It can be proved wrong only by proving its impossibility.

S e c o n d l y :  Although for the past twenty years, indeed forty years, those who opposed 
me, and then those who tried to oppose the R i s a l e - i   N u r , have not refuted my interpreta-
tions on grounds of either logic or scholarship, and thousands of learned people -the re-
ligious scholars who oppose me together with the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students- have conﬁrmed 
them, and have not said “ he’s been smitten by the evil-eye, ” I refer it to your fair-mind-
edness to judge just how unjust it is for those who do not know how may suras there are in 
the Qur’an to meet them incredulously.

I n   S h o r t :  The meaning of interpretation is one probable or possible meaning of a Ha-

dith or Qur’anic verse out of many.

418

THE RAYS

know this, so I have proved it in some respects in the courts. Accusing me 
in this way of insincerity in my service of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and belief, and 
depreciating the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and devaluing it, will deprive this nation of its 
sublime truths.

If,  because  they  imagine  this  world  is  eternal  and  that  like  themselves 
everyone exploits religion and belief for the world, these wretches ascribe 
worldly motives to someone who challenges all the people of misguidance 
in this world, is ready to sacriﬁce his lives both in this world, and if nec-
essary, in the next; and as he claimed in the courts would not exchange a 
single truth of belief for rule of the whole world; and out of sincerity and 
its mystery ﬂees with all his strength from politics and all ranks, material 
and spiritual, which hint of politics; and has endured unequalled torments 
for twenty years; and due to his way, has not condescended to any involve-
ment in politics; and with respect to himself considers himself far inferior to 
his students, and believes himself to be truly wretched and unimportant - if 
because of the extraordinary strength of belief they have obtained from the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , some of his sincere brothers ascribe to him in their private let-
ters some of the virtues of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , because he is their interpreter; 
and in consequence of a custom which has absolutely no political overtones 
they  afford  him  a  high  rank  –like  people  call  ordinary  persons  they  love 
“ My  lord!  My  benefactor!, ”–  and  they  think  much  better  of  him  than  he 
deserves; and follow the old, acceptable custom practised between master 
and students, which is not objected to and has the meaning of thanks, and 
praise him excessively; and write exaggerated eulogies, which has long been 
the custom to write at the ends of acceptable books; if they do these things, 
can it in any way be considered a crime? For sure it is opposed to the truth 
in a way since it is exaggeration, but he is a stranger, alone, with numerous 
enemies, and there are numerous things to make him lose his helpers. So 
purely in order to strengthen their morale in the face of so many opponents 
and to prevent them ﬂeeing and not to destroy the enthusiasm of those who 
praised him excessively, he changed part of what they had written so that it 
referred to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and did not reject it outright. It may be under-
stood therefore just how far from the truth, the law, and fair-mindedness cer-
tain ofﬁcials have fallen when they try to make the above person’s service 
of belief look to this world, despite his age and his being at the door of the 
grave. My last word is:

Supplement

I  saw  that  it  was  written  on  the  back  of  the  last  report  concerning  the 
investigations of the examining magistrate: “ Four months ago the decision 
was taken by the Cabinet to ofﬁcially prohibit the distribution of T h e   M i r a c -
u l o u s n e s s   o f   t h e   Q u r ’ a n ,  that is, the Twenty-Fifth Word, on the pretext that 
its explanations of three verses against civilization were not in conformity 
with the present Civil Code. ”

 is about inheritance; as is the third, 
 

My reply to this: T h e  M i r a c u l o u s n e s s  o f  t h e  Q u r ’ a n  is now part of Z ü l ﬁ k â r , 
and on only two pages of the four hundred pages of Z ü l ﬁ k â r  are explanations 
of the three verses, which reply in a way that cannot be objected to, to some 
of civilization’s criticisms of the Qur’an, and were included in three of my 
old treatises. One of the verses is about the veiling of women; the second, 
 
( 4:11 ) » º 
( 4:176 )  M L K J  I  expounded  the  wisdom  of  these  verses’ 
meanings in a way that would silence the philosophers, in two pages twenty 
years ago, and in my other treatises thirty years ago. It is therefore our legal 
right,  instead  of  banning  the  four-hundred-page  Z ü l ﬁ k â r   on  the  suspicion 
that it was written now, to excise those two pages from it and return the book 
to us - just as if a letter contains one or two harmful words, those words are 
cut out and the publication of the rest is permitted. We seek our rights from 
your just court in this matter.

Since nobody could ﬁnd the opportunity to come to read me the forty-
page indictment, which was given me a month ago, they read it to me today, 
11th  June,  for  the  ﬁrst  time.  I  listened  to  it,  and  I  saw  that  the  list  of  my 
objections  which  I  wrote  for  you  two  months  ago,  and  the  Appendix  and 
Addendum to my objections of nearly a month ago, had been given to both 
six departments of government in Ankara, and to your ofﬁce. Those objec-
tions refute and demolish that indictment. I see absolutely no necessity to 
rewrite the objections to it. I only say now, in order to recall to the prosecu-
tion, the following two or three points:

The reason I did not take the indictment into consideration and reply to 
it was to avoid insulting the honour of the three just courts that had acquit-
ted us and being in contempt of them. For those courts acquitted us after 
studying in the minutest detail all the points in the present indictment. To 
completely disregard their acquittals is to insult the honour of the judiciary.

420

THE RAYS

S e c o n d   P o i n t :   Due  to  its  gross  misrepresentations,  attaching  unimagi-
nable  meanings  to  one  or  two  matters  out  of  thousands,  the  prosecution 
accuses us of certain offences. However, those matters are in the large col-
lections of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . The ulema of al-Azhar University in Cairo, the 
leading scholars of Damascus, the exacting scholars of Mecca and Medina, 
and  of  Aleppo  and  so  on,  and  especially  the  investigative  scholars  of  the 
Directorate of Religious Affairs, have all seen them and have praised them 
appreciatively  and  put  their  signatures  to  them.  So  it  was  with  astonish-
ment  and  bewilderment  that  I  saw  the  pseudo-scholarly  objections  in  the 
indictment. Even if I had made some errors and the indictment was correct 
in what it imputed, although thousands of scholars had not spotted them or 
objected to them, they still would not constitute a crime; they would only 
be scholarly errors. Moreover, three courts have acquitted the entire R i s a l e - i  
N u r  and ourselves. Only Eskişehir Court gave light sentences to myself and 
ﬁfteen out of a hundred of my companions because of ﬁfteen words in the 
Twenty-Fourth Flash, which is about the veiling of women. I wrote in the 
addendum to my objections that if there is justice on the face of the earth, it 
would not accept my being convicted for expounding that verse and comply-
ing with what was laid down in three hundred and ﬁfty thousand Qur’anic 
commentaries. As though collecting water from a thousand streams and in 
its cleverness, the prosecution tried to use against us a number of points in 
books and letters written over twenty years. That makes the, not three, but 
ﬁve or six courts which acquitted us on this point our accomplices in this 
imaginary crime. I am reminding the prosecution not to insult the honour of 
those just courts.

T h e   T h i r d :  Even if explicitly, to criticize and object to a leader who is 
dead and gone, whose relations with the government have ceased, and who 
was the cause of certain faults in the reforms, cannot be a legal offence. But 
there was not anything explicit; the prosecution applied my general state-
ments to him through its misrepresentations. It publicized those conﬁdential 
meanings, which we do not tell to everyone, and drew everyone’s attention 
to them. If there is any crime involved, the prosecution is guilty. Because it 
is inciting the people, and attracting their attention to those meanings.

T h e   F o u r t h :   Due  to  baseless  suspicions,  repeating  the  same  old  story, 
collecting water from a thousand streams, the prosecution investigated hints 
of a secret society, despite our unequivocal acquittal on this point by three 
courts.  However,  while  there  are  numerous  political  societies  which  are 
harmful for this nation and country, which they permit and look on tolerantly, 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

421

to call a secret society the solidarity of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students with their 
fellow-students, which as established by the testimony of thousands of wit-
nesses  and  signs  and  the  fact  that  six  provinces  did  not  interfere  with  us, 
is  solely  for  the  good  of  the  country,  nation,  and  religion,  on  account  of 
happiness in this world and the next, and to strive against the currents from 
inside  and  outside  the  country  which  are  bent  on  corruption,  and  like  the 
prosecution to accuse them of “ exploiting religion and inciting the people 
to disturb public order and breach security, ” although in twenty years not 
one single such incident has been recorded in connection with the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  students, will bring not humankind, but the earth to anger, thus reject-
ing such an accusation. However, there is no need to say anything further. 
My written objections and its addendum, which were written long before the 
indictment, are my reply to it.

I say this to Afyon Court and the Chief Criminal Judge:
Because since my early youth I could not endure to be dominated, I sev-
ered my relations with the world. Now life has become a great burden for 
me with this meaningless, unnecessary oppression. I do not have the power 
to endure the persecution of thousands of ofﬁcials outside. I am fed up with 
this sort of life. With all my strength I am requesting you to sentence me. 
To enter the grave is not within my power, and I have to remain in prison. 
You too know that the unsubstantiated crimes the prosecution accuses me 
of are non-existent. I cannot be convicted because of them. However, I have 
serious faults before my true duties, for which I can in effect be convicted. 
If it is appropriate to ask, I shall reply to your question. Yes, my only crime 
out of my serious faults is this: it occurred to me here in Afyon Prison that 
in the view of reality it was an unforgiveable fault that, because I had not 
looked to the world, I had not performed the weighty duty with which I had 
been charged in the name of the country, nation, and religion, and my not 
knowing this did not excuse me.

The fact that three courts have acquitted us in this respect shows just how 
far from truth and justice those have fallen who give the name of a worldly, 
political society to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students’ disinterested attachment to the 

422

THE RAYS

R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its interpreter, which looks purely to the hereafter, and try 
to show that they are guilty of a criminal offence. We too say:

The basis and foundation of human society and particularly the Islamic 
nation  are  the  sincere  bonds  between  relatives,  and  the  concerned  attach-
ment  between  tribes  and  groups,  and  due  to  Islamic  nationhood  the  spir-
itual  brotherhood  and  mutual  assistance  between  believers,  and  the  devo-
tion  to  one’s  nation,  and  unshakeable  attachment  to  and  partiality  for  the 
truths of the Qur’an and those who propagate them. It is only by denying 
these  bonds,  which  ensure  the  life  of  society,  and  by  accepting  the  “ red 
peril ” – which scatters the terrible seed of anarchy from the North, which 
ruins the younger generation and nationhood, and drawing to itself every-
one’s children, destroys kinship and nationhood, and opens up the way to the 
complete corruption of human civilization and the life of society – that the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  students can be called a political society, which is an indictable 
offence. For this reason, true students of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  proclaim openly 
their  sacred  attachment  to  the  truths  of  the  Qur’an  and  their  unshakeable 
bonds of brotherhood which look to the hereafter. Because they are happy to 
accept any penalty they may receive because of that brotherhood, they admit 
in your just court the truth as it is. They do not stoop to defend themselves 
with lies, sycophancy, and cunning.

An Addendum to the Addition to My Written Objections to 
the Indictment Presented to Afyon Court

F i r s t l y :  I tell the court that since the new indictment is based on the old 
indictments of Denizli and Eskişehir Courts, and on the superﬁcial inves-
tigations of the superﬁcial ‘committees of experts,’ who were opposed to 
us, I claim in your court that if I cannot prove one hundred errors in this 
indictment,  I  shall  be  happy  with  a  hundred-year  sentence.  Now  I  have 
proved my case; if you wish I can present you with the table of more than 
a hundred errors.

S e c o n d l y :  When during the Denizli trial, our books and papers had been 
sent  to  Ankara  and  I  was  full  of  anxiety  and  despair  that  the  judgement 
would be given against us, I wrote to my friends the following piece, which 
has been added at the end of some of my defence speeches: “ If the ofﬁcers 
of the law who are studying the R i s a l e - i   N u r  with the idea of criticizing it 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

423

strengthen or save their belief through it, bear witness that I forgive them. 
For we are here to serve. The Risale-i Nur’s function is to strengthen and 
save  belief.  We  are  charged  with  serving  belief  without  differentiating 
between friend and foe, and without taking sides. ”

Judges of the Court! In consequence of this truth, the powerful, irrefu-
table proofs of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  have directed the hearts of the people of 
the court towards itself; whatever you do against me, I forgive you; I will 
harbour no grudge. It is because of this that although I have been riled by 
the extreme tyranny and repression I have suffered, and the contemptuous 
treatment  and  defamation  of  my  person,  which  have  been  to  an  extent  I 
have never previously experienced, I have endured it and have not even 
spoken  ill  of  those  involved.  The  collections  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  which 
you have in your possession, form my irrefutable, incontestable defence 
and  my  objections  to  all  the  charges  made  against  us  and  the  crimes  of 
which we are accused.

It is astonishing that although the leading scholars of Cairo, Damascus, 
Aleppo, Medina and Mecca, and the exacting scholars of the Directorate of 
Religious  Affairs  have  studied  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   collections  minutely,  and 
offering no criticisms have praised and applauded them, the clever persons 
who compiled the indictment against us showed through an extraordinary 
and  obvious  error  -stating  that  the  Qur’an  contains  forty  suras-  just  how 
superﬁcially they considered the matter. Despite hundreds of thousands of 
the people of reality afﬁrming the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , under these severe condi-
tions, and myself in exile, alone and wretched and the object of fearsome 
attacks, that prosecutor, who does not even know how many suras there are 
in  the  Qur’an,  said:  “ Although  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   attempts  to  expound  the 
Qur’an and interpret Hadiths, it has no scholarly substance or value in teach-
ing its readers in a part of it... ” It is understood just how far his criticisms are 
from the law, reality, justice and equity.

I also make this complaint to you, that although for two hours you made 
us  listen  to  the  entire  forty-page  indictment,  which  contains  hundreds  of 
errors and wounds our hearts, despite my insistence you did not allow me 
two minutes to read one and a half pages in reply, which were the complete 
truth. In the name of justice I therefore request that you permit me to read 
my entire list of objections.

T h i r d l y :   Every  government  has  opponents,  but  so  long  as  they  do  not 
disturb public order, they may not be touched legally. Is it at all possible 
then  that  myself  and  those  like  me  who  are  disenchanted  with  the  world 

424

THE RAYS

and work only for the grave should give up spending the remainder of their 
lives  within  the  bounds  taught  by  the  Qur’an,  on  the  way  our  forefathers 
followed for one thousand three hundred and ﬁfty years, in a way permitted 
by the rules sanctiﬁed at all times by three hundred and ﬁfty million believ-
ers, - that we should give up that way, and being coerced by our enemies and 
their subterfuges, merely for this brief and ﬂeeting worldly life, support the 
savage laws and principles of an immoral, dissolute civilization, indeed, of a 
sort of communism, and adopt them as our way? No law anywhere, and no 
one the tiniest bit fair, would force us to accept them. We only say to those 
who oppose us: Don’t bother us and we won’t bother you!

It is due to this fact that I support neither intellectually nor on scholarly 
grounds the arbitrary commands of a commander, called laws, which have 
made Aya Sophia into a house of idols and the Şeyhülislam’s Ofﬁce into a 
girls’ high school. And for myself I do not act in accordance with them. But 
although for twenty years I have been severely oppressed during my torturous 
captivity, I have not become involved in politics, nor provoked the authori-
ties, nor disturbed public order. Although I have hundreds of thousands of 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  friends, not a single incident has been recorded involving the 
disturbance of the peace. I am fed up with life due to the utterly humiliating 
and unjust treatment directed at my person here in my exile in the last period 
of my life, such as I have never before suffered and which has galled me. 
I feel disgust at freedom even, under this oppression. I have written you a 
petition saying that contrary to everyone else, I want not my acquittal but 
to be convicted and given not a light sentence, I want the heaviest penalty. 
For in order to be saved from this unparalleled, extraordinarily tyrannical 
treatment, there is no solution for me other than entering either the grave or 
prison. But since suicide is not permitted, and the appointed hour of death is 
unknown and outside my power, I am resigned to the imprisonment I now 
suffer in absolute solitary conﬁnement. 1 However, I am not presenting this 
petition for the present, for the sake of my innocent companions.

F o u r t h l y :  Conﬁrmed by all that I have written in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  these 
thirty years of my life, the period I have called that of the New Said, and 
the facts concerning my person, and testiﬁed to by the fair-minded people 
and friends who have met with me with serious intention, I state this: As 
far  as  I  have  been  able  I  have  tried  to  restrain  my  evil-commanding  soul 
from indulging in self-advertisement, fame-seeking, and pride, and perhaps 
a hundred times I have wounded the feelings of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  students 

1.  The same situation has now continued for seventeen months.

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

425

who  have  excessively  good  opinions  of  me.  As  is  conﬁrmed  by  both  my 
close friends and my brothers, and the signs they have observed, I told them: 
“ I possess nothing, I am the wretched herald of the jeweller’s shop of the 
Qur’an. ” Let alone winning worldly rank for myself and high position and 
fame, even supposing I was given high spiritual rank, being frightened of the 
possibility of my soul taking a share in the service I perform and spoiling my 
sincerity and pure intention, I decided to sacriﬁce those ranks and positions 
for my service. Yet despite my acting in this way, and my not accepting the 
gratitude of some of my brothers for their beneﬁting from the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
– which has been presented in your high court as though it were some politi-
cal matter of great moment – you have made their respect for me, which is 
greater than that of a son for his father, the subject of interrogation. You have 
driven some of them to deny it. You have made us listen in astonishment. 
Can it be imagined a crime for some unfortunate to be praised although he 
himself is not happy at this and does not consider himself worthy?

F i f t h l y :   I  tell  you  certainly  that  to  accuse  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students  of 
belonging to a political society and of political involvement when they have 
absolutely no connection with any society, association, or political move-
ment, is knowingly or unknowingly to struggle against us on account of a 
secret atheistic organization which for forty years has been working directly 
against Islam and belief, or in the name of a sort of communism which pro-
duces anarchy in this country. For three courts of law have acquitted in that 
respect  all  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students  and  the  treatises  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r . 
Only, Eskişehir Court gave me one year, and out of one hundred and twenty 
others, ﬁfteen of my friends six months each because of a single matter in 
a short treatise about the veiling of women, or perhaps because of the sen-
tence: “ According to what I have heard, in the centre of government a shoe-
shiner  behaved  impudently  towards  the  semi-naked  wife  of  an  important 
person,  and  his  astonishing  unmannerliness  dealt  a  slap  in  the  shameless 
face of someone opposed to the veiling of women, ” which was written long 
ago. That means, to accuse the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its students now is to charge 
and convict three courts, and to be contemptuous of them.

S i x t h l y :  The R i s a l e - i   N u r  cannot be combated. All the Islamic scholars 
who have seen it have conﬁrmed that it is a veracious commentary on the 
Qur’an,  that  is,  it  consists  of  powerful  proofs  of  its  truths.  It  is  a  miracle 
of  the  Qur’an  this  century,  and  a  ﬁrm  barrier  for  this  nation  and  country 
against the perils from the North. I have understood therefore that it is a duty 
of your court not to scare off its students, but with regard to public rights, 

426

THE RAYS

to encourage them, and I await this from you. Thanks to freedom of schol-
arship, the books and journals of the irreligious and some political atheists, 
who are harmful for the nation, country, and public security, are not inter-
fered with, so it surely is not a crime to be a student of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and 
save the belief of the innocent, needy youth and preserve them from immo-
rality;  indeed,  the  government  and  Ministry  of  Education  should  applaud 
and encourage it.

My last word: May Almighty Allah allow the judges to execute the law 

with true justice. Amen.

My Last Word

I say this to the Judges of the Court: 
I have understood from both the indictment and from my long solitary 
conﬁnement that in this matter it is mostly my person that is under consid-
eration, and it has been seen ﬁt to destroy my character, as though my per-
son were harmful to the government, public security, and the country, and 
making religion a screen, I harboured worldly aims, and was pursuing some 
sort of politics. In the face of this, I tell you the following with complete 
certitude:

Because  of  these  unfounded  suspicions,  do  not  injure  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  
students by slandering my person, for they are devoted to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
and to this country and nation, and are of great value for them. For if you 
do, it could be the cause of considerable immaterial harm for this country 
and nation, indeed, the cause of their being exposed to danger. I tell you this 
certainly too: whatever is visited on my person in the way of insult, humili-
ating  treatment,  slander,  torture,  and  prison  sentences,  on  account  of  the 
way I now follow I have decided to accept it – on condition no harm comes 
to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its students because of me. There is also reward in 
this for me in the hereafter. While weeping, I am also pleased since in this 
way  I  may  be  saved  from  the  sins  of  my  evil-commanding  soul.  If  these 
wretched innocent people had not been sent to prison along with me, I would 
have  spoken  out  with  great  vehemence  in  your  court.  You  have  seen  too 
that  the  person  who  wrote  the  indictment  wants  to  destroy  my  character 
with  his  misrepresentations  and  exaggerations,  and  partly  misinterpreting 
what is written, by showing that all my books and letters, conﬁdential and 
otherwise, written over these twenty to thirty years of my life were written 
this year, and had never been seen by any court, or been pardoned, or been 
subject to the passage of time. I have said a hundred times that my person is 
faulty, and the reason that although they have defamed me on every occa-
sion it has had no effect on public regard for me, which is enough to perturb 
the politicians, is this: there is an intense and overwhelming need here at this 
time for a number of people to teach religion and strengthen belief, people 
who will sacriﬁce the truth for nothing, make it a tool of nothing, and take no 
share for their own souls. Only in this way may what they teach about faith 
be proﬁted from and come to be believed in with complete certainty.

Yes, it seems that at no time or place was the need so great, for the dan-
ger has come in full force from outside. Although I have admitted and pro-
claimed that I myself have not met this need, they have supposed that I have 

428

THE RAYS

met  it  to  an  extent  not  because  of  any  virtue  of  mine,  but  because  of  the 
severity of the need and others not being in the forefront. For a long time I 
have looked on in astonishment and wonder, but only now understood the 
wisdom in this public regard, of which I am in no way worthy – despite my 
fearsome faults. The wisdom in it is this:

Here at this time, the R i s a l e - i  N u r  and the collective personality of its stu-
dents have directed that severe need to themselves. They have supposed my 
person to be a representative of the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s wondrous reality and its 
sincere and pure personality –despite my share of its work and service being 
only a thousandth– and they have given me the attention. But this is both 
harmful for me, and a burden. It is also not my right. But I have remained 
silent and have accepted the harm for the sake of the R i s a l e - i  N u r  and its col-
lective personality. Also, because of my service to it, they have considered 
my unimportant person to be included in the predictions about the R i s a l e - i  
N u r , which is a mirror reﬂecting the All-Wise Qur’an’s miraculousness at 
this time, and the collective personality of its sincere students, made through 
divine inspiration by some of the saints such as Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be 
pleased with him ) and Gawth al-A‘zam ( May his mystery be sanctiﬁed ). 
It seems I was mistaken, for in some places I attributed some of their kind 
attention to my person, and did not direct it towards the R i s a l e - i   N u r . The 
reason for this was my weakness; I apparently accepted part of it for myself 
to prevent the things that might scare away those who help me multiplying 
and to increase their conﬁdence in what I said. I warn you! There is no need 
to defame my transitory person, which is at the door of the grave; there is no 
necessity to give it so much importance. In any event you cannot combat the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , so do not combat it! You cannot defeat it. You will cause great 
harm to this nation and country by combating it. Anyway you cannot scatter 
its students. For the defender of the Qur’an at this time and its heroic actions 
-which in the view of the Islamic world are like the heroes of former times- 
will not allow the sons of this land’s forefathers, who gave forty to ﬁfty mil-
lion martyrs on the way of defending the Qur’an, to abandon it. Even if they 
apparently withdraw, those sincere students are still bound to it with all their 
lives and spirits. They will not abandon the R i s a l e - i  N u r , which is a mirror of 
that reality, thereby harming this nation, country, and public security.

My last word is:

I have a request of the greatest importance to present to the Cabinet.
I request the Cabinet that the ﬁfteen-page Fifth Ray, which was originally 
written years ago and was later included at the end of the more than three-
hundred-page  collection  called  T h e  
(   S i r a c ü ’ n - N u r   ) , 
and was the reason for the collection being collected up by the Cabinet, be 
removed from T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p . For it has been established that the 
work is in many ways useful for the disaster-stricken, the elderly, and those 
who have fallen into doubt concerning their faith. I request that the piece 
which is imagined to be harmful is banned, but permission is given for the 
remaining three hundred pages to be published, so that the calamity- stricken 
and the elderly can receive solace from it and the needy can proﬁt from the 
truths of belief that it contains.

I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p  

verse 

Moreover,  in  the  four-hundred-page  Z ü l ﬁ k â r ,  two  pages  written  thirty 
years ago expounding two verses about inheritance and the veiling of women 
in reply to the philosophers of Europe, and one line about banks in  S i g n s  
o f   M i r a c u l o u s n e s s   (   I s h ā r ā t   a l - I ‘ j ā z   ) , published thirty years ago, about the 
 ( 2:275 ) ; : 9 8 7 and approximately a line written thirty 
years ago while I was in the Darü’l-Hikmet, among the six questions asked 
of the Şeyhülislam’s Ofﬁce by the head cleric of the Anglican Church - I 
request  that  these  passages  are  excised  and  the  Z ü l ﬁ k â r   collection,  which 
has been conﬁscated on the pretext of those two pages and one line -because 
they are not in conformity with the present Civil Code- is returned. For it 
has been highly praised by the Islamic world and its beneﬁts have been seen 
in fact, and it proves wonderfully three of the pillars of belief. This is what 
we request and it is our right. Just as if ﬁve words of a letter are censored, 
the  remainder  are  permitted,  so  we  are  seeking  this  important  legal  right 
of ours. We demand that together with the Qur’an and the lovers of faith 
who through the R i s a l e - i   N u r  serve the nation, country and public security, 
we are delivered from the oppression of those who make mountains out of 
molehills concerning us. Also, I have not seen a copy of T h e   S i x   A t t a c k s  for 
eighteen years, which I wrote when full of anger at the severe repression I 
was suffering at that time; saying it was conﬁdential I did not give permis-
sion for it to be published. Anyway it came into the hands of three or four 
courts, and they returned it to its owners.

[ This  is  written  to  thank  the  experts’  committee  of  the  Directorate 
of  Religious  Affairs.  I  shall  explain  three  points  in  order  to  assist  in 
amending their minor criticisms, the answer of which is clear. ]
The First: I thank those scholars in three ways. For myself I am grateful 

to them.

F i r s t l y :  Apart from the Fifth Ray, their summarizing appreciatively the 

other thirteen parts of T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p   C o l l e c t i o n .

S e c o n d l y :  Their refuting the allegations made against us of founding a 

Suﬁ order, setting up a political society, and breaching security.

T h i r d l y :  Their corroborating my case in court. That is, I told the court: If 
there is any fault, it is mine. The R i s a l e - i   N u r  students are sincere and inno-
cent, and work at the R i s a l e - i   N u r  for their faith. Thus, their committee of 
experts also exonerates the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students, and ascribes all the fault 
to me. So I say to its members: May Allah be pleased with you! Only, they 
made partners in my crime the late Hasan Feyzi and the late Hafız Ali, and 
two or three others who are the heirs of those two blessed martyrs and work 
according to their system. But they were wrong in one way. For they were 
ahead of me not in faults but in the service of belief, and were given to me 
by divine grace as assistants, out of mercy for my weakness, and were free 
of my faults.

Second Point: The committee of experts said that some of the narrations 
in the Fifth Ray are “dubious” and others are “false”, and that some were 
misinterpreted. This was written in the same way as the indictment in Afyon, 
which was against us. But I proved in a table ﬁfteen pages long that it con-
tained eighty-one mistakes. The respected committee of experts should see 
the table. An example of one of the mistakes is as follows:

T h e   p r o s e c u t o r   s a i d :  “ All the interpretations are wrong, and the narra-

tions are either false (   m a w ḍ ū ’   )  or dubious. ”

A n d   I   s a y :   To  interpret  a  Hadith  means  saying  that  such-and-such  a 
meaning is possibly or probably intended by the Hadith. According to logic, 
it  is  possible  to  refute  the  possibility  of  that  meaning  only  by  proving  its 
impossibility. But just as the meaning has been seen this century and has 
been realized, so one aspect of the universality of the Hadith’s allusive level 
of meaning has observedly shown one ﬂash of its miraculous predictions to 
be true at this time, and can therefore in no way be denied or objected to. 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

431

It has also been proved in the table that the prosecutor’s saying that “ all the 
narrations are either false or dubious ” is wrong in three respects.

T h e   F i r s t :   It  is  wrong  in  ten  respects  to  deny  such  narrations  in  their 
entirety, for Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who memorized a million Hadiths, 
and  Imam  B u k h a r i ,   who  memorized  ﬁve  hundred  thousand,  did  not  have 
the  courage  to  deny  them,  and  anyway  such  a  denial  is  not  possible;  and 
the prosecutor has not seen all the books of Hadiths; and most of the Umma 
every century have awaited the appearance of what those narrations signify 
or to witness one aspect of their general meanings; and they have just about 
been accepted by the Umma; and a number of aspects and samples of them 
which are completely true have appeared and been seen.

T h e   S e c o n d   R e s p e c t :  The meaning of m a w ḍ ū ’  is that a narration is not a 
Hadith with an authenticated chain of authorities. It does not mean that its 
meaning is wrong. Since among the Umma, especially the people of reality 
and those who have had uncovered to them the realities, and some of the 
Hadith scholars and those qualiﬁed to interpret the law, have accepted them 
and awaited the appearance of what they indicate, surely those narrations 
contain truths which look to everyone, like proverbs.

  ِلاَ

T h e   T h i r d   R e s p e c t :   What  question  or  narration  is  there  that  in  one  of 
their books the scholars, whose ways and schools are all different, have not 
objected to it? For example, one of the narrations about the appearance of 
several  Dajjals  ( Antichrists )  within  Islam  is  the  following  Hadith,  which 
foretells explicitly the dissension of Hulagu and Jenghiz: 
ِساَ

ّ(cid:93)َ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)ا يـِ(cid:92)َا ِوْ(cid:179) ِ(cid:134) ى ِ
“ The ‘Abbasid Caliphate will long continue, until it falls into the hands of 
the Dajjal. ” 1 Like this Hadith, which states that after ﬁve hundred years a 
Dajjal will appear in Islam, numerous narrations give news of the ﬁgures 
that will appear at the end of time. Nevertheless, some of the m u j t a h i d s  who 
were of different schools, or whose ideas were extreme, did not accept them, 
saying they were either unauthenticated or dubious. Anyway, the reason I 
have cut this long story short is related to the R i s a l e - i   N u r , for just as four 
severe earthquakes coincided 2 with the R i s a l e - i   N u r  being attacked, demon-
strating the earth’s wrath, so during the hours I was writing this reply, two 
severe earthquakes occurred here. It was like this:

THE RAYS

It was two earthquakes coinciding with the suffering I was experiencing 
from  the  wounds  caused  by  the  surgical  operation  of  the  experts’  report, 
which had been given me that evening, and from my pitiful difﬁculties at 
having no contact with others and having to write myself with my wretched 
pen.  Yes,  I  received  that  evening  the  report  from  the  Directorate  of  Reli-
gious Affairs, on which I had placed most trust during my eight months of 
distress in solitary conﬁnement, and had expected would come to our assist-
ance. This morning I understood that with the most trivial matters they had 
helped  not  me  but  the  public  prosecutor.  I  saw  that  they  said:  “ Said  said 
that the last four earthquakes were instances of the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s wonder-
working. ” Then, when intending to write, as I had written in the table of 
errors: “ Like acceptable almsgiving, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is a means of calami-
ties being repulsed. Whenever it is attacked, calamities seize the opportu-
nity and occur. Sometimes too the earth rages, ” two severe earthquakes  1 
occurred here, which made me give up writing the piece, so I am leaving it 
and passing on to the third Point.

Third  Point:  Exacting,  veracious,  and  fair-minded  scholars  of  the 
experts’ committee! A long- standing and acceptable practice among schol-
ars is their writing eulogies and praises, sometimes exaggerated, sometimes 
the  opposite,  at  the  ends  of  ﬁne  works  written  by  others,  and  publishing 
them, and the authors in question being grateful and pleased at the writers 
of such eulogies, and their rivals also not accusing them of boasting. So I 
have been unable to equate it with careful study, precise knowledge, kind 
assistance, and fairness, that you should have considered it self- advertise-
ment that I did not altogether reject the eulogies written by some special and 
sincere students of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  in the style of the late Hasan Feyzi and 
the martyr Hafız Ali, which they wrote with the idea of assisting me in my 
helplessness, weakness, aloneness, and exile in the face of so many unfair 
people attacking and objecting to me savagely, and to encourage the needy 
to embrace the R i s a l e - i   N u r . I was sorry at this. Those pure-hearted friends 
of mine never thought of politics, but veriﬁed by mathematical reckoning 
said:  “ One  aspect  and  minor  meaning  of  the  Hadith’s  universal  allusive 
meaning at this time is the R i s a l e - i   N u r , ” which cannot be said to be wrong. 
For time is proving it right. In any event, even if it was very exaggerated or 
even wrong, it would still only be a scholarly mistake. And everyone can

write his own opinions. You know how many various views and opinions 
are written in the works of the twelve schools of the Shari‘a, and particu-
larly in the Hanaﬁ, Maliki, Shaﬁ‘i, and Hanbali Schools, and of the nearly 
seventy authorities of the sciences of theology (   k a l ā m   )  and the principles 
of religion. However, never at any time has the need for agreement between 
the scholars of religion been as great as it is at present, and for them to avoid 
dispute. Now we are compelled to leave aside conﬂict in secondary matters 
and not to make them the subject of dispute.

* * *
I have three questions to ask of the equitable h o d j a s  of the commit-
tee of experts:

T h e   F i r s t :  Is a person guilty of an offence if someone praises him with 
a  good  intention?  Especially  if  he  does  not  want  it  –  could  it  be  thought 
self-love if as far as he can he either rejects such praise or directs it towards 
someone  else,  but  in  order  not  to  lose  his  sincere  friend,  does  not  scold 
him, and responds with silence and saying that the praise is a hundred times 
greater than his due?

T h e   S e c o n d   Q u e s t i o n :   At  this  time  of  terrible  attacks  on  religion  and 
momentous religious questions, should a lover of the truth from among the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r   students  be  deserving  of  such  blame  and  insult  because  of  a 
harmless, minor scholarly error and a mistaken view? Is it permissible that 
while awaiting from masters like yourselves a gentle warning, the student 
who wrote the eulogy should be dealt a blow in this way with the hand of 
the judiciary?

T h e   T h i r d   Q u e s t i o n :  Are these criticisms of yours, related to only one 
or  two  matters,  ﬁtting  for  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  which  these  twenty  years  has 
never been shaken by its innumerable opponents and has strengthened the 
belief of thousands of needy people? Also I remind those exact scholars of 
the following: because they saw a letter of mine at the top of Ahmed Feyzi’s 
eulogy, they criticize me in their report as though I had written the eulogy 
to myself. But the letter was written in order not to accept the praises for 
myself, and to have them cut out of the eulogy, and I did cut out a part of 
them. Others I was going to modify, but being forced to hurry, I sent the let-
ter to one of my brothers without completing it. He then put the letter at the 
beginning of the eulogy. Then when it was being sent to a private person, it 
was seized by the government. Is such a private eulogy, which was purely 
scholarly and a personal view, and was sent from friend to friend with the 

434

THE RAYS

idea of consulting about modifying it, deserving of such vehement objec-
tions? Moreover, the two small collections bound in red and black consisted 
of  a  number  of  conﬁdential  letters  written  privately  to  friends  in  order  to 
congratulate, encourage, and gratify them. Anyway, one or two people had 
been interested in them, and had gathered them together in a book so they 
should not get lost. In the searches it fell into the hands of the police. Is there 
any need to put forward absurd suppositions about such letters, make them 
the subject of interrogation, and try to relate them to politics? Is it not like 
being blind to the terrible dragons assaulting the Qur’an, and not even look-
ing at them, and trying to combat pestilential mosquitoes?

Does it not infer by ignoring Saraçoğlu, who calls religion and the train-
ing  of  Muhammad  “ poison ”,  and  by  disputing  T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p , 
which  demonstrates  the  Qur’anic  reality  as  clearly  as  the  sun  and  proves 
it  to  be  the  perfect  cure  for  mankind’s  wounds,  assisting  in  the  conﬁsca-
tion of that collection? We await from persons like yourselves balm for our 
wounds, and your insight and assistance, and we are not offended at your 
minor criticisms.

[ This forms the introduction to the pieces that follow it. ]

With the idea of helping a little to refute with true, fair evidences Afyon 
Court’s decision against us and turn the Appeal Court in our favour, and in 
order to indicate brieﬂy some of the errors in the indictment, we have written 
exactly the pieces from the conﬁdential treatises which they mentioned as 
being offences; pointing out the errors, we show those who are convicting 
us to be guilty of an offence.

F o r   i n s t a n c e :  In order to have me sentenced to the heaviest penalty, they 
wrote at the end of the indictment as an index of all my crimes: “ The matters 
Said Nursi rejects: One: the abolition of the Empire and Caliphate. ” This 
is both wrong and an oversight. For ﬁfteen years ago in Eskişehir Court I 
replied to a question about my writing in the Twenty-Sixth Flash, the Tr e a -
t i s e   F o r   T h e   E l d e r l y :  “ I was grieved at the passing of the sovereignty of the 
caliphate, ” and my reply silenced the court. Anyone who considers to be a 
crime an unimportant memory, faded with time, which was covered by the 
pardon and has been acquitted, is himself guilty.

As documentary evidence for this imaginary crime, they showed a Hadith 
from one of the Flashes, which is also found in T h e   M i r a c l e s   o f  M u h a m m a d

That is, after the four Rightly-Guided Caliphs there will be corruption. I 
wrote in one of my old treatises that this Hadith contained three miracu-
lous prophecies. Then in the indictment, it gave as my crime: “ In one of 
his  treatises  Said  says:  ‘After  the  caliphate  will  be  tryanny  and  corrup-
tion.’ ”  You  superﬁcial  committee!  Anyone  who  considers  it  a  crime  to 
explain  the  miraculous  prediction  of  a  Hadith  which  foretells  the  wide-
spread spiritual and material corruption among humankind of the present 
and  an  event  that  will  cause  chaos  on  the  earth,  is  himself  guilty  both 
spiritually and materially.

They also wrote that “a person is guilty of political reaction if he calls 
the reforms innovation, misguidance, and atheism, such things as the closure  
of the Suﬁ  t e k k e s  and  z a v i y e s  and the religious schools; the acceptance of 
secularism; the establishment of nationalist principles instead of Islam; the 
wearing of the brimmed hat; the banning of Islamic dress for women; the 
enforced use of the Latin alphabet in place of the Qur’anic alphabet; the e z a n  
and k â m e t   being recited in Turkish; the prohibition of religious instruction 
in schools; the recognition of equal rights for women and in inheritance; and 
the abolition of polygamy.

Unfair  committee!  The  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  has  every 
century  been  the  sacred,  heavenly  guide  of  three  hundred  and  ﬁfty  mil-
lion people, the programme of all their happiness, and the sacred treasury 
of the life of this world and the next. If it is possible to deny numerous 
of its explicit verses, which do not bear interpretation, about the veiling 
of  women,  inheritance,  polygamy,  the  recollection  of  Allah,  instruction 
in religious knowledge and its dissemination, and the preservation of the 
marks of religion, and to make guilty of crimes all the authoritative Islamic 
interpreters of the law and all the Şeyhülislams, and if you can annul the 
passage of time, quash the numerous court acquittals, and the legal par-
dons, and abolish conﬁdentiality and the private side of things, and free-
dom of conscience and freedom of thought, and intellectual and scholarly

In the Twenty-Sixth Letter, Said Nursi speaks of himself like this: “ This 
wretched brother of yours has three personalities which are far from each 
other.

“   T h e   F i r s t : In regard to being the herald of the elevated treasury of the 
All-Wise Qur’an, I have a temporary personality which pertains solely to the 
Qur’an. The extremely exalted character demanded by the position of herald 
is not my character; I do not possess such a character. It rather consists of 
the qualities necessitated by the position and the duty. Whatever you see in 
me of this sort of quality, is not mine, so do not consider me as possessing 
it; it belongs to the position.

“   T h e   S e c o n d    P e r s o n a l i t y : Through Almighty Allah’s grace, a person-
ality  is  given  me  at  the  time  of  worship,  when  I  am  turned  towards  the 
divine court; this personality displays certain marks. These marks arise from 
“ knowing  one’s  faults,  realizing  one’s  want  and  impotence,  and  seeking 
refuge in utter humility at the divine court, ” which are the basis and mean-
ing of worship. With this personality, I know myself to be more wretched,

and applaud me, they could not make me believe that I am good or possess 
perfection of any sort.

“   T h e   T h i r d : I have my true personality, that is, the degenerate person-
ality of the Old Said, that is, certain veins of character inherited from the 
Old Said. Sometimes it inclines to hypocrisy and desires rank and position. 
Also, because I do not come of a noble family, lowly characteristics are to 
be observed, like my being frugal to the point of miserliness. My brothers! 
I am not going to describe the many secret faults and ills of this personality, 
lest I chase you away altogether. Almighty Allah has compassionately dem-
onstrated His power in me so that He employs my personality, which is like 
that of the lowest common soldier, in serving the mysteries of the Qur’an, 
which resembles the most exalted position of ﬁeld marshal. Thanks be to 
Allah a hundred thousand times! The soul is baser than everything, and the

“Those who do not perform the prayers are traitors, and the pronouncements

court guilty. ]

It is said “ We do not support either intellectually or on scholarly grounds 
the  arbitrary  commands,  called  laws,  of  the  commander  who  made  Aya 
Sophia into a house of idols and the Şeyhülislam’s Ofﬁce into a girls’ high 
school, and in respect of my person, I do not act in accordance with them. ”
It is said in his petition dated 29.8.1948: “ An idea occurred to me, it 
was like this: the fact that although for the good of the nation and coun-
try the government should be protecting and helping me, it is oppressing 
me, suggests that the secret atheistic organization which struggles against 
me  together  with  the  section  of  the  communist  organization  which  has 
combined  with  that  organization  have  gained  hold  of  important  ofﬁcial

positions  and  are  now  confronting  me.  As  for  the  government,  either  it 
is uninformed of this, or it permits it. Could it possibly be a crime not to 
love a man who has turned Aya Sophia into a house of idols, which is an 
eternal source of pride for an heroic nation, and a shining decoration in the 
world showing its services to the Qur’an and j i h a d , and a vast and precious 
souvenir of their swords, and has also turned the Şeyhülislam’s Ofﬁce into 
a girls’ high school?”

[ The piece the court reckoned was the most likely to have Said con-
victed. It attached entirely the wrong meaning to these words, which 
Said had used in Denizli Court against his covert enemies; and alter-

conviction. ]

He called “ some of the new laws of the state, which has carried out the 
reforms, ‘arbitrary compulsion on account of disbelief;’ the republic, ‘abso-

[ It  is  extraordinary  but  Hasan  Feyzi’s  most  sincere  and  entirely  true

being included at the end of one of the collections of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
was given as the reason for the collection’s seizure. ]
Hasan Feyzi wrote a letter, a summary of which is this:
“ O R i s a l e - i   N u r ! There is no doubt that you are the tongue of Truth, and 
inspiration  of  Truth,  and  have  been  written  with  His  permission. ”  “ I  am 
no one’s property. I was taken from no book, I was stolen from no work. I 
belong to the Sustainer and to the Qur’an. I am a wondrous Light pouring 
forth from an immortal work. ” “ You are a most effulgent book of truth and 
mercy. You adorn and honour some of your special, sincere students with 
the decorations of the saints and puriﬁed scholars. Moreover, your treatises 
have not entered the courts as a criminal or suspect, but as a teacher, instruc-
tor,  and  guide.  In  every  session  of  justice  you  have  displayed  splendidly, 
brilliantly,  your  power  and  forcefulness,  your  greatness  and  pride.  You 
laved them with the water of belief and the Qur’an. ”

“ O  Ustad,  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s  Servant  and  Interpreter!  Ustad,  Allah’s 
servant, spiritual son of Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ), and 
disciple  of  Gawth  al-A‘zam  ( May  his  mystery  be  sanctiﬁed )!  Raise  me 
to  the  elevated  degree  of  your  knowledge! ”  “ Only  a  month’s  worth  of

[ They questioned only one of the reasons for the naming of the R i s a l e - i

Küreli Nuri the Clockmaker are now distinguished in their service of 
the R i s a l e - i  N u r . That is to say, they cannot criticize it, so are compelled 
to base their allegations on the most trivial matters. ]

The reason that in the Twenty-Sixth Word, the thirty-three Words, thirty-
three  Letters,  thirty-one  Flashes,  and  thirteen  Rays  are  called  the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r  is this: throughout my life the word Nur ( light ) has everywhere con-
fronted me. For instance, my village was Nurs, my late mother’s name was 
Nuriye, my Naqshi master was Sayyid Nur Muhammad, one of my Qadiri 
masters was Nuruddin, one of my Qur’an masters was Nuri, and of my stu-
dents those most attached to me have been those with Nur in their names. 
( But  how  strange  it  is  that  there  is  no  one  among  the  important  R i s a l e - i  
N u r  students with the name Nuri. ) 1 And what elucidates and illumines my 
books most are the comparisons about light. And what has solved most of 
my difﬁculties related to the divine truths is the luminous name of Nur, out 
of  the  most  beautiful  names.  And  my  particular  leader  in  my  passionate 
enthusiasm for the Qur’an and my restricting my service to it, is ‘Uthman 
Dhi’l-Nurayn ( May Allah be pleased with him ).

“ Recently, the concealed aggression of the irreligious has taken on a most 
ugly form; tyrannical aggression against the unfortunate people of belief and 
against  religion.  Our  private  and  unofﬁcial  call  to  prayer  and  k â m e t   was 
interrupted  during  the  private  worship  of  myself  and  one  or  two  brothers 
in  the  mosque  I  myself  had  repaired.  ‘Why  are  you  reciting  the  k â m e t   in

exhausted in keeping silent. So I say, not to those unscrupulous vile men 
who are not worth addressing, but to the heads of the pharaoh-like society 
who with arbitrary despotism plays with the fate of this nation: O you people 
of innovation who have deviated from the straight path of religion, I want 
the answer to six questions.

“ T h e   F i r s t :  Every government in the world, every people which rules, 
even cannibals, and the chief of a band of brigands, have some principle, 
some law, by which they rule. So according to which principle do you carry

“ The biggest fool in the world is he who expects progress, prosperity, 
and happiness from irreligious anarchists like them. One of those fools who 
occupied  a  high  position,  said:  ‘We  said  “ Allah!  Allah! ”  and  remained 
backward. Europe said “ Guns and cannons, ” and advanced.’

“ According  to  the  rule,  ‘a  fool  should  be  answered  with  silence,’  the 
answer  for  such  people  is  silence.  But  because  behind  certain  fools  are 
inauspicious clever people, we say this:

“ O  you  wretches!  This  world  is  a  guesthouse.  Every  day  with  their 
corpses, thirty thousand witnesses put their signature to the decree ‘Death 
is a reality’ and they testify to the assertion. Can you kill death? Can you 
contradict  these  witnesses?  Since  you  can’t,  death  causes  people  to  say:

‘Allah! Allah!’ Which of your guns and cannons can illuminate the everlast-

comes, if guns and cannons are said once, ‘Allah! Allah!’ should be said a

great harm to our service of the Qur’an. Like the One Powerful Over All 
Things sweeps and cleans in a minute the atmosphere ﬁlled with clouds and 
shows the shining sun in clear skies, so He may also dispel these black and 
merciless clouds and show the truths of the Shari‘a like the sun, and give 
them without expense or trouble. We await it from His mercy that He will 
not sell them to us expensively. May He give intelligence to the heads of 
those at the top, and belief to their hearts; that would be enough. Then mat-
ters would put themselves to rights. ”

“ Since what you hold in your hand is light, not a club, and light cannot be 
objected to, nor ﬂed from, nor can harm come from showing it, why do you 
advise caution to your friends, and prevent them showing many light-ﬁlled 
parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  to people? ”

“ The heads of most of those at the top are drunk and they cannot read 
them.  And  even  if  they  do  read  them,  they  cannot  understand  them;  they 
give them the wrong meaning, and interfere. They should not be shown them 
until  they  come  to  their  senses  lest  they  interfere.  Therefore,  I  advise  my

After explaining that the veiling of women is a command of the Qur’an, it 
says in the Twenty- Fourth Flash, which is about that subject: “ The fact that, 
according to news received, the bare- legged wife of a high-ranking man in 
the world was accosted by a common shoe-shiner in the country’s capital, in 
the marketplace in daylight in front of everyone, deals a slap in the shame-
less faces of those opposed to the veiling of women! ”

While in the Twenty-Sixth Flash, about the elderly, it says: “ I climbed to 
the top of Ankara citadel, which was far more aged, dilapidated, and worn 
out than me. It seemed to me to be formed of petriﬁed historical events. The 
old age of the season of the year together with my old age, the citadel’s old 
age, mankind’s old age, the old age of the glorious Ottoman Empire, and the 
death of the caliphate’s rule, and the world’s old age all caused me to look 
in the most grieved, piteous and melancholy state in that lofty citadel at the 
valleys of the past and the mountains of the future. ... As I sought consola-
tion looking to the right, that is, to the past, my father and forefathers and the 
human race appeared in the form of a vast grave and ﬁlled me with gloom 
rather than consoling me. ... I looked at the present day. It appeared ... as a 
cofﬁn bearing my half-dead, suffering and desperately struggling corpse.”

“ I  spent  most  of  the  salary  I  had  received  from  the  Darü’l-Hikmeti’l-

resulting from frugality and contentment rendered that scanty money suf-
ﬁcient for me. It prevented me being humiliated. There is still a little left of 
that blessed money. ”

is  for  my  closest  and  most  sincere  and  loyal  students:  “  F i r s t   I n d i c a t i o n :

Said says in one of his signed letters: “ I used to be astonished at the inno-

It is written that a number of verses and Hadiths allude unanimously to a 
luminous truth this century, and point to a supreme regenerator of religion 
who is to come at the end of time; that the most important of the three duties 
of  that  person  and  community  will  be  to  save  belief,  and  that  there  will 
be no harm in their disregarding the two duties which dominate the broad 
sphere, such as reviving the Shari‘a and setting up the caliphate. However, 
this  might  lead  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s  opponents,  particularly  the  politicians,

[ This is Husrev’s footnote at the end of my letter entitled “ The Ta k b i r s  
of the Hajjis, which furnishes a perfect reply to their criticisms of my 
explanations. ]

In the letter signed by Said Nursi, with the heading “ The t a k b i r s  of the 
Hajjis on Arafat,” is the reply to “ a signiﬁcant number of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
students  asking  persistently  about  a  prominent  guide  from  the  Prophet’s 
Family who is to come at the end of time; they suppose him to be you. For 
your part, you consistently refuse to accept their ideas and shrink from such 
a suggestion. This is a contradiction. We want the answer to this matter. ”

The  reply:  The  collective  personality  of  the  sacred  community  which 
the Mahdi descended from Allah’s Messenger (UWBP) will represent, will 
have three functions: to save belief, to revive the marks of Islam under the 
title of the caliphate of Muhammad ( UWBP ), and to modify to some extent 
the  laws  of  the  Shari‘a  of  Muhammad  (UWBP).  He  will  attempt  to  carry 
out this vast duty. Since the Risale-i Nur students see the ﬁrst duty being 
fulﬁlled  completely  in  the  Risale-i  Nur,  saying  that  the  second  and  third 
duties are in second and third place, they rightly suppose the Risale-i Nur’s 
collective personality to be a sort of Mahdi. Since some of them suppose its 
wretched Interpreter is a representative of that collective personality, they 
sometimes call him by the same name. Indeed, they say that it is understood 
from interpretation and study of the predictions of some of the saints, that 
the Risale-i Nur is that very guide of the end of time. There is confusion on 
two points, and they have to be interpreted.

T h e   F i r s t :  In reality the latter two duties are not of the same degree as the 
former. However, inﬂuenced by this century’s ideas in particular the mass 
of people and the politicians consider the caliphate of Muhammad (UWBP) 
and Islamic Unity to be immeasurably more extensive than the ﬁrst duty. 
Every century a sort of Mahdi and Regenerator has appeared who gave guid-
ance, but they have performed only one of the three functions and so have 
not been awarded the title of the Great Mahdi.

T h e   S e c o n d :  That supreme person of the Last Days will be a descendant 
of  the  Prophet  ( UWBP ).  For  sure  I  am  like  a  spiritual  son  of  Imam  ‘Ali 
( May Allah be pleased with him ), and I have received instruction from him 
in the realities; and since in one sense the Family of Muhammad ( UWBP ) 
includes true R i s a l e - i   N u r  students, I too may be thought of as belonging to 
the Prophet’s Family. But it is not permissible in the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  way to 
desire any sort of egotism or personality or personal rank, or to win fame

and renown. Even if rank in the hereafter were given me, I would feel myself 
compelled to leave it aside in order not to spoil the sincerity of the R i s a l e - i

clearly and decisively rejected.

[ The events in this piece are facts, and since in extraordinary fashion

criticism. ]

It is said: “ Ten hours after having given my statement for four hours and 
suffering considerable discomfort, virtually at the same time, the ﬁre in the 
Ministry of Education broke out, which caused loss worth two million liras 
and demonstrated that the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is a means of repulsing calamities. 
For if it is attacked, the calamities ﬁnd a way and strike. ”

In letter number one hundred and forty-one, it proves that the ﬁres in the 
Ministry of Education in Ankara and in a garage, in a factory in Izmir, and a 
large building in Adana being burnt to the ground after I had given my state-
ment for four and a half hours were not coincidence, then it says: “ Don’t 
deprive  me  of  my  treatises,  or  both  I  and  this  country  will  pay  for  it;  the 
earth will vent its anger with earthquakes. Three minutes after saying this an 
earthquake occurred which lasted three seconds, and the Ministry of Edu-
cation was engulfed in ﬂames; numerous earthquakes have coincided with 
aggression against the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its students, as has been proved four 
times by courts of law, which cannot be chance or coincidence. Numerous 
incidents have shown that the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  is a means of calamities being 
repulsed in this country. ”

In letter number one hundred and forty-seven: “ This time, the winter 
displayed its fury when we were attacked. The weather raged with storm 
and was bitterly cold, but when the assaults ceased and the Nurjus expe-
rienced an expansiveness, those bitterly cold days began to smile like the 
ﬁrst days of spring. ... The burning down of the Ministry of Education was 
a universal blow.

fect cure for humanity’s wounds, that you are assisting in the conﬁscation 
of that collection? ”

It says the following in the conclusion of one of his defence speeches, 
presented to the court on an unknown date. He stated that neither himself nor 
the students were occupied with politics; the writings shown to be aggres-
sive were conﬁdential; there was freedom of thought and of conscience; that 
even if the above appeared to be criticism of some laws, this did not consti-
tute a crime; many of the treatises under consideration were written a long 
time previously; they had been scrutinized by committees of experts and had 
been found to be inocuous; that just as there had previously been convictions 
for them in Eskişehir Court, so they had been acquitted in Denizli Court, 
so it was not right that they should be tried again for the same offence; the 
R i s a l e - i  N u r  students had up to now been involved in no activities that would 
disturb public order; and that since no one was named explicitly in the Fifth 
Ray and its purpose was only to inform, this did not constitute a crime either.

Further examples may be thought of in the same way.

THE RAYS

To the Judges of the Court of Appeal

[ Again they did not permit me to speak in the session held to discuss 
the  possible  quashing  by  the  Appeal  Court  of  Afyon  Court’s  unjust 
decision  concerning  us.  They  made  us  listen  to  a  third  severe  indict-
ment. They also did not allow anyone to come to help me with writing. 
Despite  my  poor  handwriting  and  my  being  ill,  I  am  presenting  this 
complaint to your court – which has acted justly towards us twice previ-
ously – as a supplement to my petition concerning the appeal. ]

ُهَ(cid:178)اَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126) ِه ِ(cid:175)ـ ْ(cid:126)اِ(cid:92)

A petition to the supreme tribunal of the resurrection; and a complaint to 
the divine court; the Appeal Court of the present should also listen as well 
as coming generations and the enlightened future teachers and students of 
the universities. Of the hundreds of torments and calamities I have suffered 
these twenty-three years, I am setting ten before the court of justice of the 
All-Glorious Sovereign together with my complaints.

The First: Despite my faults, I have dedicated my life to this nation’s 
happiness and the saving of its religious belief. Saying, let my head too be 
sacriﬁced for a truth, that is, the truth of the Qur’an, for which millions of 
heroic heads have been sacriﬁced, I worked with the R i s a l e - i   N u r  with all 
my strength. Through divine assistance, I persisted in the face of all the cruel 
torments. I did not withdraw.

F o r   e x a m p l e :   One  instance  of  the  exceedingly  cruel  treatment  I  have 
received during my trial and imprisonment in Afyon: although three times, 
and every time for nearly two hours, they forced myself and the innocent 
R i s a l e - i   N u r   students,  who  were  awaiting  solace  from  justice,  to  listen  to 
the slanderous, malicious indictments, they did not allow us more than one 
or two minutes to defend our rights, despite my repeated requests for ﬁve or 
ten minutes.

I have been kept for twenty months in total isolation, with only one or 
two of my friends being permitted to visit me for three or four hours. For 
only a small part of my defence speeches did I have anyone to help me with 
the  writing.  Then  they  were  forbidden  as  well,  and  punished  exceedingly 
brutally. They compelled us to listen to the prosecutor’s biased indictment, 
which was like water gathered from a thousand streams, and which I proved 
contained eighty-one errors in ﬁfteen pages arising from twisted meanings 
and slander and lies. They did not permit me to speak. If they had permitted 
me, I would have said:

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

451

Although as required by freedom of thought and freedom of conscience, 
you do not interfere with Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians, and particularly 
now with anarchists, apostates, and dissemblers, hiding behind the screen 
of  communism,  who  both  deny  your  religion,  and  insult  your  forefathers 
accusing them of misguidance, and accept neither your Prophet ( UWBP ) 
nor the laws of the Qur’an; and although through the Qur’an’s instruction 
millions of Muslims in the lands and under the rule of an imperious, bigoted 
Christian state like Britain, reject all the false beliefs and inﬁdel rules of the 
English, their courts do not interfere with them; and although opponents of 
all governments openly publish their ideas without those governments both-
ering them; and although both the Isparta authorities, and Denizli Court, and 
Ankara  Criminal  Court,  and  the  Directorate  of  Religious  Affairs,  and  the 
Appeal Court twice, no, three times, have all scrutinized these forty years 
of my life, and my one hundred and thirty treatises, and my most private 
treatises and letters, and they had in their possession for two or three years 
all the copies of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , conﬁdential and otherwise, yet they could 
not  show  a  single  matter  necessitating  the  smallest  penalty;  and  although 
despite the fact I am extremely weak, oppressed, defeated, and am endur-
ing the harshest conditions, our innocence has been proved by the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  collections you hold as well as our four-hundred-page defence, which 
have been shown to be a most powerful, sound, and veracious guide for two 
hundred thousand true and devoted students beneﬁting this country, nation, 
and public security; - in spite of all these, under which law, what conscience, 
what  good,  what  crime  do  you  convict  us,  contemptuously  giving  us  the 
harshest sentences and severest solitary conﬁnement? Certainly you shall be 
questioned about this at the Last Judgement.

The  Second:  One  reason  they  put  forward  for  punishing  me  was  my 
expounding the Qur’an’s explicit verses about veiling, inheritance, recita-
tion of the divine names, and polygamy, written to silence those who object 
to them in the name of civilization.

Fifteen years ago I wrote the following piece to Eskişehir Court and the 
Appeal Court, which was also included in the court’s decision. I repeat the 
piece as a complaint to the supreme tribunal at the Last Judgement, and as 
a warning to the enlightened teachers of the future, and together with T h e  
S h i n i n g   P r o o f   (   E l h ü c c e t ü ’ z - Z e h r â   )  as a sort of addition to my petition to 
the  Appeal  Court,  which  twice  has  acted  fairly  in  acquitting  me  and  has 
listened to my cry for justice, and to the committee of judges who did not 
permit  me  to  speak  and  due  to  the  malicious  indictment  which  I  proved 

452

THE RAYS

contained eighty errors, convicted me to two year’s hard labour and solitary 
conﬁnement  together  with  two  year’s  further  exile  elsewhere  under  close 
surveillance:

I say this that if there is any justice on the face of the earth, the Appeal 
Court  will  quash  this  decision  which  convicts  someone  who  expounded 
Qur’anic verses which in each century for one thousand three hundred and 
ﬁfty years have acted as sacred, true divine principles in the social life of 
three  hundred  and  ﬁfty  million  Muslims,  and  expounded  them  relying  on 
the consensus and afﬁrmation of three hundred and ﬁfty thousand Qur’anic 
commentaries and following the beliefs of our forefathers for one thousand 
three hundred years. Is it not a denial of Islam and a betrayal of our millions 
of religious and heroic forefathers to convict, because he expounded those 
verses, someone who according to reason and learning does not accept cer-
tain European laws applied temporarily due to certain requirements of the 
times and who has given up politics and withdrawn from social life, and is it 
not to insult millions of Qur’anic commentaries?

The Third: One reason they cited for our conviction was breaching secu-
rity  and  disturbing  public  order.  Putting  forward  the  remotest  possibility, 
one in a hundred or even a thousand, in place of actual events, and attaching 
the wrong meanings to forty to ﬁfty words from some conﬁdential treatises 
and private letters out of the hundred thousand words and sentences of the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , they present these as evidence, and accusing us want to have 
us punished.

Calling  to  witness  those  who  have  known  my  life  these  thirty  to  forty 
years and the thousands of select ( h â s  ) 1 students of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , I say: 
to accuse of disturbing public order someone who, – at a time the commander 
of the British occupation forces in Istanbul was sowing discord among Mus-
lims, even deceiving the Şeyhülislam and some leading men of religion and 
inciting the Committee of Union and Progress and the Freedom and Accord 
Party to struggle against each other, thus paving the way for the Greek vic-
tory and defeat of the National Movement,– foiled that insidious plan of the 
commander by printing and publishing through the efforts of Eşref Edib his 
work  T h e   S i x   S t e p s   (   H u t u v a t - ı   S i t t e   )   against  the  British  and  Greeks,  not 
retreating even in the face of threat of execution; who did not ﬂee to Ankara 
even  when  summoned  because  of  the  above  service  by  the  leaders  there; 
who  attached  no  importance  when  a  prisoner-  of-war  to  the  Russian

commander-in-chief’s  order  for  his  execution;  who  with  a  speech  during 
the  Thirty-First  of  March  Incident  induced  eight  regiments  to  obey  their 
ofﬁcers; 1 and in the Military Court, disregarding the threat of execution said 
in reply to the presiding pashas’ questions of: “ You too are a reactionary, 
you too wanted the Shari‘a? ”, “ If constitutionalism consists of one party’s 
despotism,  then  let  all  men  and  jinn  witness  that  I  am  a  reactionary  and 
ready to sacriﬁce my very soul for a single matter of the Shari‘a, ” causing 
those high-ranking ofﬁcers to appreciate and admire him, and while expect-
ing his execution, they decided on his acquittal, then on being released, he 
did not thank them but went on his way shouting: “ Long live Hell for all 
tyrants! ”; and as is written in the decision of Afyon Court, when Mustafa 
Kemal angrily said to him in the ofﬁce of the Speaker of the Assembly:  2 
“ We summoned you here so you would tell us of your elevated ideas, but 
you  came  and  wrote  some  things  about  the  ﬁve  daily  prayers  and  sowed 
conﬂict among us, ” he replied: “ After belief, the obligatory prayers are the 
most elevated question. Those who do not perform the prayers are traitors, 
and  the  pronouncements  of  traitors  are  to  be  rejected; ”  who  said  this  in 
the presence of forty to ﬁfty deputies, and forced that fearsome commander 
to swallow his anger and make a sort of apology; and in connection with 
whom not one matter has been recorded by the police and authorities of six 
provinces connected with the disturbance of public order; and among whose 
hundreds of thousands of students not the smallest incident has been wit-
nessed ( apart from one insigniﬁcant incident concerning a rightful defence 
in which one unimportant student was involved ); in connection with none 
of whose students any crime has been heard; and whichever prison he has 
been sent to has there reformed the other prisoners; and as testiﬁed to by 
these twenty-three years of his life and three provincial authorities and three 
courts acquitting him and a hundred thousand of his students, who know the 
value of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , afﬁrming it verbally and by action, despite hun-
dreds of thousands of copies of it being distributed throughout the country, 
the Risale-i Nur has produced only beneﬁts and caused no harm; and who is 
a recluse, single, a stranger, elderly, poor, and sees himself at the door of the 
grave; and who with all his strength has given up transitory things, and has 
sought ways of atoning for his former sins and making his life eternal, and 
attaches not the slightest importance to worldly rank, and who, so that no 
harm will come to the innocent and the elderly, out of his compassion does

not curse those who torment and torture him; - those who say about such a 
man: “ This old recluse disturbs the peace and breaches public security; his 
aims are the intrigues of this world, and his correspondence is for this world, 
in which case he is guilty ” and who convict him under such severe condi-
tions are surely themselves guilty from the ground to the heavens, and they 
shall give their account at the Last Judgement!

Can it be said about a man who with a speech induced eight mutinying 
regiments to obey their ofﬁcers, and with a single article persuaded thou-
sands  of  people  to  support  him,  and  was  not  frightened  before  the  three 
above-mentioned formidable commanders, and did not fawn to them, and 
in  courts  of  law  declared:  “ If  I  had  heads  to  the  number  of  hairs  on  my 
head and every day one was cut off, I would not surrender to atheism and 
misguidance and betray my country and nation and Islam; I would not bow 
this head before tyrants, for it has been dedicated to the Qur’an,” and was 
concerned  with  no  one  in  Emirdağ  apart  from  ﬁve  or  ten  brothers  of  the 
hereafter and three or four servants – could it be said about such a man, as 
it does in the indictment: “ This Said was working secretly in Emirdağ; he 
poisoned the minds of some of the people giving them the idea of disturbing 
the peace; twenty men gathered round him and wrote private letters praising 
him, which shows that he was hatching a revolt and was involved in covert 
politics  against  the  government ”?  I  refer  it  to  your  consciences  to  under-
stand just how far from right, justice, and fairness those who torment him 
have deviated by, with unprecedented animosity and hatred, throwing him 
into prison for two years, in solitary conﬁnement, and by not allowing him 
to speak in court.

Is it at all possible that someone who has received public attention a hun-
dred times greater than is his due, and brought thousands of men to obedi-
ence with one speech, and induced thousands of people to join the İttihad-ı 
Muhammedî Society with one newspaper article, and made ﬁfty thousand 
people listen admiringly to his address in Aya Sophia Mosque 1 - that such a 
man should work at it for three years in Emirdağ and deceive only ﬁve or ten 
people, and ﬁll his grave, which he is approaching, with unnecessary dark-
ness rather than with light? Is it at all possible that he should do this? Satan 
himself could not make anyone accept it!

The Fourth is their citing my not wearing the brimmed hat as an impor-
tant reason for my conviction. 2 They did not allow me to speak, otherwise 

1.  These events occurred in early 1909. [ Tr. ]
2.    According  to  the  famous  Hat  Act  passed  25  November  1925,  the  wearing  of 

European headgear became compulsory, and all other headgear was banned. [ Tr. ]

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

455

I would have said this to those who were trying to punish me: I stayed as a 
guest for three months in the police station in Kastamonu. At no time did 
they say to me: “ Wear the brimmed hat! ” And although in three courts of 
law I did not wear the hat and did not remove my own headgear, they did 
not interfere with me. And on that pretext for twenty-three years a number of 
irreligious tyrants have inﬂicted a very distressing and severe penalty on me 
unofﬁcially. And children, women, villagers, ofﬁcials in their ofﬁces, and 
those who wear the beret are not compelled to wear the hat. And there is no 
physical beneﬁt in wearing it. Yet because of their fabrications and allega-
tions a recluse like myself has paid a twenty-year penalty for not wearing 
headgear  that  all  the  m u j t a h i d s   and  Şeyhülislams  have  prohibited.  Those 
people who are trying to have me punished again because of a meaningless 
custom related to dress, and with force, repetition, and insistence to have me 
found guilty because of my dress – despite, saying there is personal freedom, 
their comparing to themselves those who drink r a k ı  in public in Ramadan 
during the day and do not perform the obligatory prayers, and not bother-
ing them – surely after suffering the everlasting extinction of death and per-
petual solitary conﬁnement of the grave, at the Last Judgement they will be 
questioned concerning this error.

The  Fifth:  Anyone  who  has  heard  this  third  indictment  and  seen  the 
judgement  that  we  published  will  conﬁrm  that  on  pretexts  as  ﬂimsy  as  a 
ﬂy’s wing, they are trying to conﬁscate some of the treatises of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r ,  which  is  alluded  to  favourably  by  thirty-three  Qur’anic  verses,  was 
applauded by such saints as Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah exalt him ) and Gawth 
al-A‘zam (  May his mystery be sanctiﬁed ), is afﬁrmed by a hundred thou-
sand  believers,  and  in  twenty  years  has  won  a  highly  beneﬁcial  rank  for 
this nation and country without causing any harm. Even, making a pretext 
two pages about two correct explanations of two verses, which were written 
long ago and have been covered by pardons, it was even the cause of the 
four-hundred-page  Z ü l ﬁ k â r   and  T h e   M i r a c l e s   o f   M u h a m m a d   (   M u ’ c i z a t - ı  
A h m e d i y e   )   being  seized,  which  has  strengthened  and  saved  the  belief  of 
a hundred thousand people and is extremely beneﬁcial and valuable. And 
now, giving the wrong meaning to one or two words out of a thousand, they 
are trying to have that inﬁnitely useful treatise seized. As for us, we say:

The Sixth: To those who deem me guilty of a crime because some of the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  students have seen the wondrous proofs of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and 
proﬁted from its irrefutable teachings about belief, which are at the degree 
of  knowledge  of  certainty,  and  as  encouragement,  congratulations,  appre-
ciation, and gratitude, praise me excessively and have an over-favourable 
opinion of me, I say this: at a time I was a powerless, weak, semi-literate, 
lonely exile subject to derogatory propaganda designed to scare the people 
away from me, I found for myself some of the cures of the Qur’an and its 
sacred truths related to belief which were a perfect remedy for my ills. Then 
concluding that they were also just the medicine for this nation and the sons 
of this land, I wrote them down. Since I have very poor handwriting and was 
much in need of assistants, divine grace sent me loyal and staunch helpers.

If I had completely rejected their good opinion of me and sincere praise 
and offended them by rebuking them it would have been like contempt for 
and  hostility  towards  those  lights  taken  from  the  treasury  of  the  Qur’an. 
Thinking too it would cause those diamond-penned stout-hearted assitants 
to leave me, I directed their praise and applause for my bankrupt person to 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r , a miracle of the Qur’an to which in truth the praise is due, 
and  to  the  collective  personality  of  its  leading  students.  But  I  did  offend 
them in a way by saying that they were affording me a share a hundred times 
greater than my due. Could any law impute guilt to a man because others 
praise him although he eschews it and is not happy at it? For this is what the 
ofﬁcials are doing, who act in the name of the law.

It  was  written  on  page  ﬁfty-four  of  the  court’s  judgement,  which  was 
written against us but which we published: “ That great person of the end of 
time will be a descendant of the Prophet ( UWBP ), and we students of the 
R i s a l e - i  N u r  can be considered to be members of the Prophet’s Family only in 
meaning. Also, there can be no egotism of any sort in the way of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r , nor any wish for position and personal rank, or fame and renown. Even 
if I were offered high rank in the hereafter, I would feel myself compelled 
to refuse it in order not to damage the sincerity of the Risale-i Nur.” And on 
pages twenty-two and three it is written: “ Knowing one’s faults and real-
izing one’s poverty and impotence, and humbly seeking refuge at the divine 
court; with that personality I know myself to be more wretched, impotent, 
and faulty than everyone. So even if all the people praised and lauded me, 
they could not make me believe that I am someone good, of high spiritual 
and moral rank. Lest I frighten you off, I shall not tell you the many secret 
ills and bad characteristics of my third, true, personality. Out of His grace, 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

457

Almighty Allah employs this personality in the mysteries of the Qur’an like 
a lowly private soldier. Endless thanks be to Allah. The soul is lower than 
everything, and the duty higher.” Despite all this being written in the court 
judgement, they ﬁnd me guilty of being called a supreme guide due to the 
praises of others, which in fact refer to the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and are thus deserv-
ing of paying an awesome penalty due to the error.

The Seventh: Although Denizli Court and Ankara Criminal Court and 
the  Appeal  Courts  unanimously  acquitted  us  and  all  the  treatises  of  the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  and returned them and our letters to us, and they said “ Even 
if the Appeal Court’s decision to quash the decision and Denizli’s acquittal 
were wrong, since they have been made ﬁnal, the case cannot be retried, ” 
I was sent to Emirdağ, where I spent three years as a recluse. There, so 
long  as  there  was  no  necessity,  I  spoke  only  with  the  two  or  three  tai-
lor apprentices who were assisting me, and rarely, for ﬁve or ten minutes 
with certain religiously-minded people. I wrote no letters other than once 
a week to one place as encouragement in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and wrote only 
three letters in three years to my Mufti brother. I gave up writing pieces, 
which I had been doing for twenty to thirty years, except for two points, 
twenty pages in length, which were useful for the people of the Qur’an and 
for belief. One was about the wisdom in the repetitions in the Qur’an, and 
the other, about the angels; I wrote no other treatise. Only, I gave permis-
sion for the treatises which the courts had returned to be made into large 
collections, and since ﬁve hundred copies of T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n , which had 
been printed in the old letters, had been handed over to us by the court, and 
since duplicating machines were not ofﬁcially banned, I gave permission 
to my brothers to duplicate them so they could be published for the beneﬁt 
of the Islamic world, and I busied myself with correcting them. I was cer-
tainly not concerned with politics in any way. Moreover, although ofﬁcial 
permission had been given for us to return to our native region, contrary to 
all the other exiles I accepted the hardship of exile in order not to become 
involved in politics and the world, and did not return. The treatment I have 
received these last twenty months proves that the person who is trying in 
this third indictment to ﬁnd such a man guilty by means of the baseless 
accusations, lies, and misinterpretations is ruled by two fearsome mean-
ings. But I shall not utter them for now. What I do say is this: the grave and 
Hell are sufﬁcient, and I refer it to the Last Judgement.

The Eighth: Since the Fifth Ray was returned to us after remaining for 
two years in the hands of Denizli and Ankara Courts, it was added at the 

458

THE RAYS

end of the large collection called T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p  together with my 
defence, which had led to our acquittal in Denizli Court. For sure, previously 
we had held it to be conﬁdential, but since the courts had advertised it and 
returned it after acquitting us, I permitted its duplication seeing that it was 
thus harmless. The original of the Fifth Ray was about allegorical Hadiths 
and  was  written  thirty  to  forty  years  ago.  For  sure  some  Hadith  scholars 
stated that some of the Hadiths that were well- known by the Umma were 
dubious,  but  since  it  was  their  apparent  meanings  that  had  been  objected 
to, the piece was written solely to save the believers from doubting them. 
Then  since  some  time  later  some  of  its  wondrous  interpretations  became 
clear for all to see, I held it to be conﬁdential so that it should not be given 
the wrong meaning. Then numerous courts studied it minutely, and together 
with publicizing it, returned it to us. So I refer it to the consciences of those 
who  have  convicted  us  arbitrarily  to  see  just  how  far  it  is  from  justice, 
right,  and  fairness  to  now  again  ﬁnd  us  guilty  because  of  it.  And  saying, 
( 3:173 ) Ø × Ö Õ I refer them to the Last Judgement.

The Ninth: This is very important, but since those who have convicted 
us have studied the R i s a l e - i   N u r , I have not written it so as not to upset them.
The Tenth: This is powerful and important, but again so as not to offend 

them, I have not written it for now.

[ Part of a petition written during the Eskişehir trial ﬁfteen years ago 
and sent to the Cabinet. ] 1 

You who “ bind and loose ”!
I have suffered an injustice the like of which has rarely been seen in the 
world. To remain silent before such an injustice is disrespect for right. I am 
compelled therefore to divulge a most important fact. Demonstrate the fault 
I have committed so that the law demands either my execution or a hundred 
and one year’s imprisonment, or prove that I am completely mad, or else 
give complete freedom to myself, my treatises, and my friends, and collect 
our losses from those who caused them!

1.  A petition was sent to the Cabinet ﬁfteen years ago concerning this same matter. 
Now, since it has again arisen, I am obliged to send it again to the departments of govern-
ment concerned.

THE FOURTEENTH RAY

Yes, every government has a law and a principle according to which 
penalties are given. If there is nothing in the laws of the government of 
the republic to necessitate the heaviest penalty for myself and my friends, 
we  should  be  given  our  complete  freedom,  as  well  as  recompense  and 
appreciation and an apology. For if my important service of the Qur’an, 
which is clear and open, is against the government, I should receive not a 
year’s sentence in this way and a number of my friends, six months each, 
I should be given the death sentence or a hundred and one year’s impris-
onment and those earnestly attached to me and my work should be given 
the heaviest penalties. But if our service is not against the government, we 
should receive not penalties, charges and imprisonment, but appreciation 
and recompense. For it is service the nature of which may be understood 
through its one hundred and twenty treatises, and its challenging the great 
philosophers of Europe and overthrowing their principles. Certainly, such 
effective service will either produce ghastly results inside the country, or 
it  will  yield  most  advantageous,  elevated,  and  scholarly  fruits.  In  which 
case, I cannot be given a year’s sentence for playing a childish prank of 
hoodwinking, and deceiving public opinion, and concealing the intrigues 
of tyrants and their lies about us. Those like me either receive capital pun-
ishment, proudly climbing the gallows, or they remain free in the position 
of which they are worthy.

Yes, a clever thief can steal diamonds worth thousands, so he would not 
sentence himself to the same penalty for stealing a fragment of glass worth 
virtually  nothing.  No  thief  would  do  that,  indeed,  no  conscious  creature. 
Such a thief is cunning, not utterly stupid in that way.

Sirs! According to your delusions, I am like that thief. Rather than living 
in seclusion in a poor village in one of the districts of Isparta for nine years 
and putting in danger myself and my treatises which are the aim of my life 
by turning against the government the ideas of ﬁve to ten ingenuous unfortu-
nates, who have been given very light sentences along with me, I could have 
held a high position in either Ankara or Istanbul like formerly and manipu-
lated thousands of people towards the aim I was following. Then I would not 
have been convicted so abjectly, but would have been involved in the world 
with the pride and dignity beﬁtting my way and duty.

I do not say this out of pride or to boast, but ashamedly, to point out the 
errors of those who, recalling some of my old self-advertisement and hypoc-
risy, want to abase me so that the position I hold lacks all importance and 
cannot be proﬁted from. So I say to them:

As someone who, as conﬁrmed by his old defence, which was published 
under the name of T h e   Te s t i m o n i a l   o f   Tw o   S c h o o l s   o f   M i s f o r t u n e ,  reduced to 
obedience with a speech eight rebelling regiments during the Thirty-First of 
March Incident; and as was reported in the newspapers of the time, with an 
article called T h e   S i x   S t e p s  performed the important service of turning the 
ideas of the Istanbul ulema against the British and in favour of the National 
Movement; and delivered an address to thousands in Aya Sophia, making 
them listen to him; and was greeted with tumultuous applause by the Assem-
bly and deputies in Ankara, and had one hundred and sixty-three deputies 
assign  one  hundred  and  ﬁfty  thousand  liras  for  his  religious  school  and 
university; and without quailing responded completely ﬁrmly to the angry 
President in the Speaker’s ofﬁce and invited him to perform the obligatory 
prayers; and while in the Darü’l-Hikmeti’l-İslamiye was unanimously con-
sidered worthy by the Union and Progress government of the duty of effec-
tively  inviting  the  philosophers  of  Europe  to  accept  Islamic  wisdom;  and 
S i g n s   o f   M i r a c u l o u s n e s s   (   I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z   ) , the work he wrote on the front 
during  the  War  and  has  now  been  seized,  appeared  so  valuable  to  Enver 
Paşa, who was commander-in-chief at the time, that with respect shown by 
no one else and the idea of sharing in the good and glory of that memento 
of the War, which was racing to the future, he contributed the paper to have 
the work printed so that the exploits of its author during the War would be 
remembered - such a man would not descend to disgracing the dignity of 
his  learning,  the  sacredness  of  his  service,  and  his  thousands  of  valuable 
friends by tainting himself with a petty crime like a horse-thief, abductor of 
girls, or pickpocket so that you could sentence him to a year’s imprisonment 
and treat him like a stealer of goats or sheep. He would prefer execution to 
suffering under the arbitrary persecution of a malicious detective or com-
mon policeman the year’s sentence now given him together with being held 
under supervision for a year, after having been tormented for ten years with-
out reason with oppressive surveillance - although he could not endure to be 
dominated by the Sultan. If such a man had been involved in the world and 
if he had harboured such a wish and if his sacred service had permitted, he 
would have interfered in it to an extent ten times greater than the Menemen 
Affair and Shaykh Said Revolt. 1 The booming sound of a cannon heard by 
all the world would not have subsided to the buzz of a ﬂy.

Yes, I make the following point for the attention of the government of 
the  republic:  this  situation  has  been  brought  about  through  the  intrigues, 

1.  See page 392, fns. 1, 2.

THE FOURTEENTH RAY

machinations and propaganda of the covert organization which drove me to 
this misfortune. The evidence that widespread propaganda and terror and a 
conspiracy have been orchestrated against us in a way never before seen in 
any event is this, that although I have a hundred thousand friends, not one 
of them has been able to write me any letter for six months, or to send any 
greetings, and the fact that due to the informing of plotters who are trying to 
deceive the government, interrogations and searches have been continually 
carried out from the eastern provinces to those in the west.

The plan these intriguers hatched was evidently to organize an incident 
that would be the cause of thousands like me receiving the heaviest penal-
ties.  However,  the  result  was  a  penalty  that  recalled  an  incident  of  petty 
pilfering perpetrated by the commonest person. Of one hundred and ﬁfteen 
people,  ﬁfteen  innocent  men  were  given  sentences  of  ﬁve  or  six  months. 
Would any rational creature in the world prick the tail of a ﬁerce lion or ter-
rible dragon with his brilliantly sharp diamond sword, and make it turn on 
him? If his intention was self-defence or combat, he would use his sword 
somewhere else.

With  your  deluded  view,  you  conceive  of  me  as  such  a  man,  for  that 
is the way you have charged me and sentenced me. If I act in a manner so 
contrary to intelligence and reason, this great country should not be terror-
ized and public opinion turned against me with propaganda, I should be sent 
to  a  lunatic  asylum  like  a  common  madman.  But  if  I  am  someone  of  the 
importance you afford me, my keen sword would not be pointed at the tails 
of the lion or the dragon to make them attack him, he would rather defend 
himself as far as he could. Just as I have indeed voluntarily chosen seclusion 
these  last  ten  years,  and  tolerating  difﬁculties  beyond  human  endurance, 
have interfered in no way whatsoever in matters of government, nor have I 
wanted to interfere. Because my sacred duty prohibits me.

O you who bind and loose! Is it at all possible that in the one hundred and 
twenty treatises of a person who, as was written in the newspapers twenty-
ﬁve  years  ago,  with  one  newspaper  article  caused  thirty  thousand  people 
to accept his ideas, and drew the attention of the huge Operation Army on 
himself, and replied with six words to the questions of the chief cleric of 
the English, who wanted six hundred, and gave a speech after the Consti-
tutional  Revolution  as  though  he  were  a  leading  diplomat,  –  would  only 
ﬁfteen words related to politics and the world be found in the one hundred 
and  twenty  treatises  of  such  a  man?  Is  it  at  all  reasonable  to  accept  that 
this man follows politics and his aim is this world and he is troubling the 

462

THE RAYS

government? If his mind was set on meddling in politics and the govern-
ment, such a person would have made it clear in a single of his treatises, 
and indicated it in a thousand places. If his purpose had been criticism with 
political intent, would he not have found anything to criticize other than one 
or two rules about the veiling of women and inheritance, which have long 
been in force?

Yes,  the  politically-minded  opponent  of  a  ruling  regime  which  had 
enacted far-reaching reforms would have found not those one or two mat-
ters  to  object  to  but  thousands.  As  though  the  reforms  of  the  government 
of the republic consisted only of one or two minor matters. Although I had 
no intention to criticize it whatsoever, because of one or two words in one 
or two of my books which I had written long previously, it was said: “ He 
is attacking the ruling regime and its reforms. ” So I ask: Should the whole 
country be busied with a scholarly matter which demands not the smallest 
penalty, in a way to cause anxiety?

Thus, myself and ﬁve to ten of my friends being given the most minor, 
trivial sentences; and the whole country being intimidated by powerful prop-
aganda against us and being made to hate us; and Şükrü Kaya, the Interior 
Minister, being called to Isparta with a signiﬁcant force of soldiers in order 
to perform a task a single private soldier could perform, that is, to arrest me; 
and Ismet, the head of the Cabinet, going to the eastern provinces in that 
connection; and for two months in prison my being prohibited from speak-
ing with anyone; and no one asking after me or sending me greetings while 
alone in this exile; – all these show that it is a meaningless, pointless, illegal 
situation like a tree as huge as a mountain producing a fruit the size of a pea. 
Seeing that government means to govern with wisdom, it is not something 
any government would be involved in, especially a legal government like 
the government of the republic, which adheres more closely to the law than 
any other.

I want my rights within the bounds of the law. I accuse of being criminals 
those who act against the law in the name of the law. The laws of the govern-
ment of the republic certainly reject the arbitrary acts of such criminals. I am 
hopeful that my rights will be restored to me.

An Example of the Risale-i Nur’s Veracity

NOTE

As  the  fair-minded  and  enlightened  who  read  the  following  treatise,  1 
which was written nineteen years ago, will clearly understand, the R i s a l e - i  
N u r , with all its one hundred and thirty parts, is concerned only with belief 
and the hereafter and was written in that spirit, completely free of all politi-
cal and worldly motives. This clear and deﬁnite fact was corroborated by 
the  lengthy  investigations  and  minute  studies  carried  out  by  the  courts  of 
Eskişehir, Isparta, Denizli, and

Afyon. In this connection, we are requesting your concern and assistance 
in having all our books returned to us, which for more than twenty months 
have been held by Afyon Court, and not the smallest point of which was 
shown by the Appeal Court as constituting an offence, and which have saved 
the belief of thousands of people, and have been praised and applauded by 
their readers, and scholars, and the Islamic world.

The  greater  part  of  the  books  held  by  Afyon  Court  were  collected  by 
the ﬁrst of our companions to be released. Saying: “ We gave these books 
of  ours  to  Ustad,  their  owner;  they  should  be  handed  over  to  him, ”  they 
referred them to me. In particular, they left in the court the gilded Qur’an 
which was written showing the miraculous coincidences of letters, 2 which 
was  among  the  conﬁscated  books.  Before  everything  we  await  the  swift 
return to us of those books and our Qur’an, which were previously returned 
to us by Denizli and Ankara Courts.

This letter manifested the meaning of the verse,  ( 44 :20 )   { z y x 
and  was  not  written  vehemently.  It  is  the  answer  to  a  question  asked  me 
explicitly and implicitly by many people.

[ To reply is not agreeable to me and I do not want to, for I have bound 
everything to reliance on Allah. But since I have not been left in peace 
to  myself  in  my  own  world  and  since  they  have  turned  my  attention 
towards the world, I am compelled to propound ﬁve points in the lan-
guage of the Old Said in order to explain the reality of the situation both 
to my friends, and to the worldly, and to those in authority, so as to save 
not myself, but my friends and my Wo r d s , from the suspicions and ill-
treatment of the worldly. ]

I am asked: “ Why have you withdrawn from politics and now have noth-

T h e   A n s w e r :   The  Old  Said  of  nine  or  ten  years  ago  was  involved  in 
politics to a degree; indeed, thinking he would serve religion and learning 
by means of politics, he was wearied for nothing. He saw that it is a danger-
ous way which is dubious and full of difﬁculties, and for me superﬂuous as 
well as forming an obstacle to the most necessary duties. It is mostly lies and 
may be exploited by foreigners without one being aware of it. Furthermore, 
a person who enters politics either wins or is in opposition. As for winning, 
since I am neither an ofﬁcial nor a deputy, to work in politics is unnecessary 

464

THE FOURTEENTH RAY – SIXTEENTH LETTER 

465

and nonsense for me. Politics have no need for me that I should meddle in 
them for nothing. If I join the opposition, I would do so either with ideas or 
with force. If it was with ideas there is no need for me, for the questions are 
all clear and everyone knows them as I do. To wag one’s chin for nothing 
is pointless. If I join the opposition intending to use force and to provoke 
an incident, I might commit thousands of sins to reach one doubtful goal. 
Numerous people would be struck by disaster on account of one. So say-
ing that in all conscience he could not commit sins and cause the innocent 
to commit them for a one or two in ten possibility, the Old Said gave up 
cigarettes together with the newspapers, politics, and worldly conversation 
about politics. Decisive evidence for this is the fact that for the past eight 
years  I  have  not  read  a  single  newspaper  nor  listened  to  one  being  read. 
Let someone come forward and say that I have read one or listened to one. 
Whereas eight years ago the Old Said used to read perhaps eight newspapers 
every day. Furthermore, for the past ﬁve years I have been under the closest 
scrutiny  and  surveillance.  Anyone  who  has  observed  the  slightest  hint  of 
political activity should say so. For someone like me who is nervous, fear-
less, and without attachment, who considers the best stratagem to be without 
stratagem,  his  ideas  will  not  remain  secret  for  eight  days,  let  alone  eight 
years. If he had had any appetite or desire for politics, there would have been 
no need for investigation and scrutiny, for he would have given voice like 
the ﬁring of a cannon.

Second Point

SECOND POINT

Why does the New Said avoid politics with such vehemence?
T h e   A n s w e r :   He  avoids  it  so  vehemently  in  order  to  serve  belief  and 
the Qur’an, which is of the greatest importance, the greatest necessity and 
is  most  pure  and  most  right,  and  so  as  not  to  sacriﬁce  unnecessarily  and 
ofﬁciously for one or two doubtful years of worldly life the work of gaining 
more than millions of years of eternal life. For he says: I am growing old and 
I do not know how much longer I shall live, so for me the most important 
question  should  be  working  for  eternal  life.  The  prime  means  of  gaining 
eternal life and the key to everlasting happiness is belief (īmān), so I have 
to work for that. But since I am obliged by the Shari‘a to serve people in 
respect of learning so that they may proﬁt too, I want to perform that duty. 
However,  such  service  will  concern  either  social  or  worldly  life,  which  I 
cannot do, and also in stormy times it is not possible to perform such serv-
ice soundly. I therefore gave up that side of it and chose the side of serving 
belief, which is the most important, the most necessary, and the soundest. I 

466

THE RAYS

leave that door open so that the truths of belief I have gained for myself and 
the spiritual remedies I have myself experienced may be acquired by others. 
Perhaps Almighty Allah will accept this service and make it atonement for 
my former sins. Apart from Satan the Accursed, no one, be it a believer or 
an unbeliever, one of the veracious or an atheist, has the right to oppose this 
work. For unbelief resembles nothing else. In tyrannizing, vice, and griev-
ous sins there may be an inauspicious diabolical pleasure, but in unbelief 
there is no sort of pleasure at all. It is pain upon pain, darkness upon dark-
ness, torment upon torment.

Just  how  contrary  to  reason  it  would  be  for  someone  like  me  who  is 
unattached, alone, and compelled to atone for his former sins to leave aside 
working for an endless eternal life and serving a sacred light like belief, and 
to cast himself in old age into the unnecessary, perilous games of politics-
just how contrary to wisdom, just what a lunacy it would be even lunatics 
would understand!

But if you ask why service of the Qur’an and belief prohibit me, I would 
say this: the truths of belief and the Qur’an are each like diamonds. If I were 
polluted  by  politics,  the  ordinary  people  who  are  easily  deceived,  would 
wonder about the diamonds I was holding: “Aren’t they for political propa-
ganda, to attract more supporters?” They might regard the diamonds as bits 
of common glass. Then, by being involved with politics I would be wrong-
ing the diamonds by as though reducing their value. O you whose view is 
restricted to this world! Why do you struggle against me? Why do you not 
leave me to myself?

If you say: The shaikhs sometimes interfere in our business, and they 

sometimes call you a shaikh.

I reply: Good sirs! I am not a shaikh, I am a h o d j a  ( teacher ). The evi-
dence is this: I have been here four years and if I had taught a single person 
the Suﬁ way, you would have had the right to be suspicious. But I have told 
everyone who has come to me: Belief is necessary, Islam is necessary; this 
is not the age of Suﬁsm.

If you say: They call you Said-i Kurdi; perhaps you have some national-

ist ideas and that doesn’t suit our interests.

I would reply: Sirs! The things the Old Said and the New Said have writ-

ten are clear. I cite as testimony the certain statement, 
ْ(cid:202)َا . For years I have considered negative nation-

disease. And Europe has infected Islam with it thinking it would cause divi-
sion, and Islam would break up and be easily swallowed. My students and 
those people who have had anything to do with me know that for years I 
have  tried  to  treat  that  disease.  Since  it  is  thus,  good  sirs,  why  you  make 
every incident a pretext to harass me? According to what principle do you 
cause  me  distress  at  every  worldly  incident,  which  is  like  punishing  and 
inﬂicting trouble on a soldier in the west because of a mistake made by a 
soldier  in  the  east  because  they  both  belong  to  the  army,  or  convicting  a 
shopkeeper  in  Baghdad  because  of  a  crime  committed  by  a  tradesman  in 
Istanbul due to their being in the same line of business? Who could do this 
in all conscience? What advantage is there that could require it?

Third Point

THIRD POINT

My  friends  who  wonder  how  I  am  and  are  astonished  at  my  meeting  
every calamity with patience, silently ask the following question: “How can 
you endure the difﬁculties you’re faced with, when formerly you were very 
proud and angry and could not endure even the least insult? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  Listen to two short stories about two incidents and you will 

receive your answer:

The First Story: Two years ago an ofﬁcial spoke insultingly and con-
temptuously about me behind my back. They told me about it later. A vein 
of temperament remaining from the Old Said made me feel upset about it for 
about an hour. Then through Almighty Allah’s mercy the following occurred 
to me; it dispelled the distress and made me forgive the man. It was this:

I addressed my soul saying: if his insults and the faults he described con-
cerned my person, may Allah be pleased with him, because he recalled the 
faults of my soul. If he spoke the truth, he prompted me to train my soul and 
helped to save me from arrogance. If he spoke falsely, he helped to save me 
from hypocrisy and undeserved fame, the source of hypocrisy. No, I am not 
reconciled with my soul, for I have not trained it. If someone tells me there 
is a scorpion on my neck or breast or else points it out to me, I should be 
grateful to him, not offended. If the man’s insults were directed at my belief 
and my being a servant of the Qur’an, it does not concern me. I refer him to 
the Qur’an’s Owner, Who employs me. He is mighty, He is wise. And if it 
was merely to curse at me, insult me, and blacken my character, that does 
not concern me either. For I am an exile, a prisoner, a stranger, and my hands 
are tied; it does not fall to me to try to restore my honour myself. To do so 
is the business of the authorities of this village where I am a guest and under 

468

THE RAYS

surveillance, then of the district, then of the province. Insulting a person’s 
prisoner  concerns  the  person;  he  defends  the  prisoner.  Since  that  was  the 
reality of the matter, my heart became easy. I declared: 
( 40:44 ) ` _ ^ ] \ [ Z Y X   I  thought  of  the  incident 
as not having happened. But unfortunately it was later understood that the 
Qur’an had not forgiven the man.

The  Second  Story:  This  year  I  heard  that  an  incident  had  occurred. 
Although  I  only  heard  a  brief  account  of  it  after  it  had  happened,  I  was 
treated as though I had been closely connected with it. Anyway I hardly cor-
respond with anyone, and if I do, I only write extremely rarely to a friend 
concerning  some  question  of  belief.  In  fact  I  have  written  only  one  letter 
to my brother in four years. Both I prevent myself from mixing with oth-
ers, and the worldly prevent me. I have only been able to meet with one or 
two close friends once or twice a week. As for visitors to the village, once 
or twice a month perhaps one or two used to meet with me for one or two 
minutes concerning some matter to do with the hereafter. In exile, a stranger, 
alone, with no one, I was barred from everything, from everyone, in a vil-
lage that was unsuitable for someone like me to work for a livelihood. As a 
matter of fact, four years ago I repaired a tumble-down mosque. Although 
with the certiﬁcate I had from my own region to act an imam and preacher, 
I acted as imam in the mosque for four years (May Allah accept it), this past 
Ramadan I could not go there. Sometimes I performed the ﬁve daily prayers 
alone. I was deprived of the twenty-ﬁvefold merit of performing the prayers 
in congregation.

I  showed  the  same  patience  and  forbearance  in  the  face  of  these  two 
incidents that befell me as I did in the face of that ofﬁcial’s treatment two 
years ago. Allah willing I shall continue to do so. I think like this, and say: if 
this ill-treatment, distress, and oppression inﬂicted on me by the worldly is 
for my faulty soul, I forgive it. Perhaps my soul will be reformed by means 
of it, and perhaps it will be atonement for its sins. I have experienced many 
good things in this guesthouse of the world; if I experience a little of its tri-
als, I shall still offer thanks. But if the worldly oppress me because of my 
service of belief and the Qur’an, it is not up to me to defend it. I refer it to 
the Mighty and Compelling One. If their intention is to destroy the regard in 
which I am held generally, to expunge my undeserved fame, which is base-
less and causes hypocrisy and destroys sincerity, may Allah bless them! For 
to be held in high regard by people generally and gain a name among them 
is harmful for people like me. Those who have dealings with me know that 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY – SIXTEENTH LETTER 

469

I do not want respect to be shown to me, indeed, I can’t abide it. I have even 
scolded a valuable friend of mine perhaps ﬁfty times for showing me exces-
sive respect. If their intention in slandering me, belittling me in the eyes of 
the people, and defaming me is aimed at the truths of belief and the Qur’an 
of which I am the interpreter, it is pointless. For a veil cannot be drawn over 
the stars of the Qur’an. A person who closes his eyes only himself does not 
see; he does not make it night for anyone else.

Fourth Point

FOURTH POINT

First Suspicious Question

The answer to a number of suspicious questions:
T h e   F i r s t :  The worldly say to me: “ How do you live? What do you live 
on  since  you  do  not  work?  We  don’t  want  people  in  our  country  who  sit 
around idly and live off the labour of others. ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  I live through frugality and the resulting plenty. I am not 
obliged to anyone other than the One Who provides for me and I have taken 
the decision not to become indebted to anyone else. Yes, someone who lives 
on a hundred para, or even forty para, does not become indebted to anyone. I 
do not want to explain this matter. To do so is most disagreeable to me, as it 
may make me feel a sort of pride or egotism. But since the worldly ask about 
it suspiciously, I reply as follows: since my childhood, throughout my life, 
it has been one of my guiding principles not to accept anything from people, 
even zakat, and not to accept a salary – only I was compelled to accept one 
for one or two years in the Darü’l-Hikmeti’l-İslamiye on the insistence of 
my friends – and not to become obliged to people for a worldly livelihood. 
The  people  of  my  native  region  and  those  who  have  known  me  in  other 
places know this. During these ﬁve years of exile, many friends have tried 
earnestly to make me accept their gifts, but I have accepted none of them. 
And so, if it is asked me, “So how do you manage to live?”, I reply: “I live 
through divine bestowal and blessings.” For sure, my soul deserves every 
sort of insult and contempt, but the plenty and blessings, a divine bestowal, 
I receive as sustenance are a wonder resulting from service of the Qur’an. In 
accordance with the verse,

( 93:11 )  s r q p
I shall cite the bounties Almighty Allah has bestowed on me, and give a few  
examples by way of thanks. To do so is thanks, but I am still frightened that 
it will induce hypocrisy and pride, and that blessed plenty will be cut. For to 
make known a secret divine gift of plenty causes it to cease. But what can I 
do? I have to describe them.

THE RAYS

The First: This six months one bushel (   k i l e   )   1 of wheat, consisting of 
thirty-six loaves of bread, has sufﬁced me. There is still some left, it is not 
ﬁnished. How much longer 2 it will last, I do not know.

The Second: This blessed month of Ramadan I was given food by only 
two houses, and both of them made me ill. I understood that I am prohib-
ited from eating other people’s food. The rest of the time, in the whole of 
Ramadan, three loaves of bread and one o k k a  3 of rice were enough for me, 
as was witnessed and told by Abdullah Çavuş, the owner of a blessed house 
and a loyal friend who saw my economizing. In fact, the rice was ﬁnished 
two weeks after the end of Ramadan.

The Third: For three months on the mountain one k ı y y e  4 of butter was 
enough for me and my guests, eating it every day together with bread. On 
one occasion even I had a blessed visitor called Süleyman. Both his bread 
and my bread were about to be ﬁnished. It was Wednesday. I told him to go 
and get some more. For two hours’ distance on every side of us there was 
no one from whom he could have got any. He said that he wanted to stay 
with me on the mountain on Thursday night so that we could pray together. 
I declared: ِ
ﯯﯦَوَ(cid:98) and told him to stay. Later, although it had no 
connection with this and there was no reason for it, we both began walk-
ing till we reached the top of the mountain. There was a little water in the 
ewer, and we had a small piece of sugar and some tea. I told him: “ Brother! 
Make some tea! ” He set about making it and I sat down under a cedar-tree 
overlooking  a  deep  ravine.  I  thought  regretfully  to  myself:  we  have  a  bit 
of mouldy bread which will only just be enough for us this evening. What 
shall we do for two days and what shall I say to this ingenuous man? While 
thinking  this,  I  suddenly  turned  my  head  involuntarily  and  I  saw  a  huge 
loaf of bread on the cedar-tree in among the branches; it was facing us. I 
exclaimed: “ Süleyman! Good news! Almighty Allah has sent us food. ” We 
took the bread, and looking at it saw that no bird or wild animal had touched 
it. And for twenty or thirty days no one at all had climbed to the top of that 
mountain. The bread was sufﬁcient for us for the two days. While we were 
eating and it was about to be ﬁnished, righteous Süleyman who had been the 
most  loyal  of  loyal  friends  for  four  years,  suddenly  appeared  from  below 
with more bread.

The Fourth: I bought this sack coat I’m wearing seven years ago second-
hand. In ﬁve years I have spent only four and a half liras on clothes, under-
wear, slippers, and stockings. Frugality and divine mercy and the resulting 
plenty have sufﬁced me.

There are many other things like these examples and numerous sorts of 
divine blessings. The people of this village know most of them. But do not 
suppose I am mentioning them out of pride, I have been forced to, rather. 
And do not think they were due to my goodness. These instances of plenty 
were either bestowal to the sincere friends who have visited me, or a bestowal 
on account of service of the Qur’an, or an abundance and beneﬁt resulting 
from frugality, or they have been sustenance for the four cats I have which 
recite the divine names “ O Most Compassionate One! O Most Compassion-
ate One! ”, which comes in the form of plenty and from which I beneﬁt too.
Yes, if you listen carefully to their mournful miaowings, you will under-
stand that they are saying, “ O Most Compassionate One! O Most Compas-
sionate  One! ”  We  have  arrived  at  the  subject  of  cats  and  it  has  recalled 
the hen. I have a hen. This winter every day almost without exception she 
brought me an egg from the treasury of mercy. Then one day she brought 
me two eggs and I was astonished. I asked my friends “ How can this be? ” 
They replied: “ Perhaps it is a divine gift. ” The hen also has a young chick 
she hatched in the summer. It started to lay at the beginning of Ramadan and 
continued for forty days. Neither I nor those who assist me have any doubt 
that, both its being a pullet, and the season being winter, and Ramadan, this 
blessed situation was a divine gift and bestowal. And whenever the mother 
stopped laying, it immediately started, never leaving me without eggs.

Second Suspicious Question

S e c o n d   S u s p i c i o u s   Q u e s t i o n :  The worldly ask: How can we be sure you 
won’t meddle in our world? If we set you free, you may interfere in it. Also, 
how do we know that you aren’t being cunning? How do we know that it 
isn’t a stratagem, pretending to have abandoned the world and taking things 
from the people not openly, but secretly?

T h e   A n s w e r :  My attitude in the Court Martial and in the period before 
the  proclamation  of  the  Constitution,  which  are  known  by  many,  and  my 
defence  in  the  Court  Martial  at  that  time  called  T h e   Te s t i m o n i a l   o f   Tw o  
S c h o o l s   o f   M i s f o r t u n e , show decisively that the life I lived was such that I 
would not resort to the tiniest wiles, let alone cunning and subterfuge. If I 
had resorted to trickery this last ﬁve years, I would have made application to 
you in sycophantic manner. A wily man tries to ingratiate himself. He does 
not hold back; he always tries to deceive and hoodwink. Whereas I have not 

472

THE RAYS

condescended to respond to the severest attacks and criticisms levelled at 
me. Saying, “I place my trust in Allah,” I turned my back on the worldly. 
Moreover, if he is sensible, a person who discovers the reality of this world 
and knows the hereafter, is not sorry; he does not turn back to the world and 
struggle with it again. After the age of ﬁfty, a person who has no connection 
with anything and is alone, will not sacriﬁce eternal life for one or two years 
of the chatter and deception of this world. If he does, he is not cunning but 
foolish and crazy. What can a crazy lunatic do so that anyone should bother 
with him? As for suspecting me of outwardly abandoning the world while 
inwardly seeking it, in accordance with the verse,

( 12:53 ) ) ( ' & % $ # "
I do not exonerate my soul, for it wants everything bad. But in this ﬂeeting 
world,  this  temporary  guesthouse,  during  old  age,  in  a  brief  life,  it  is  not 
reasonable to destroy eternal life and everlasting happiness for a little bit of 
pleasure. Since it is not proﬁtable for the reasonable and the aware, willy-
nilly my soul has had to follow my reason.

Third Suspicious Question

T h e   T h i r d   S u s p i c i o u s   Q u e s t i o n :  The worldly say: Do you like us? Do 
you  approve  of  us?  If  you  do  like  us,  why  are  you  stand-ofﬁsh  and  have 
nothing to do with us? If you don’t like us, that means you object to us and 
we crush those who object to us.

T h e   A n s w e r :  Not you, if I had loved your world, I would not have with-
drawn  from  it.  I  don’t  like  either  you  or  your  world,  but  I  don’t  interfere 
with them. For I have different goals; my heart is ﬁlled with different things, 
leaving no room for anything else. Your duty is to look to a person’s hand, 
not to his heart. For you seek your government and your public order. So 
long as his hand does not interfere, what right do you have to interfere in his 
heart and tell him, “your heart should love us too,” although you are in no 
way worthy of it? Yes, just as I desire the spring during this winter and long 
for it but cannot will it or make it come; so too I long for the world to be 
righted and I pray for it and I want the worldly to be reformed, but I cannot 
will these things because I do not have the power. I cannot bring them about, 
because it is neither my duty, nor do I have the capacity.

Fourth Suspicious Question

F o u r t h  

   S u s p i c i o u s  

   Q u e s t i o n :  The worldly say: we have experienced 
so many calamities, we no longer have conﬁdence in anyone. How can we 
be certain that given the opportunity you won’t interfere like you want to?

T h e   A n s w e r :  The previous points should assure you. In addition, I did 
not interfere in your world while in my native region among my students 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY – SIXTEENTH LETTER 

473

and relatives, with those who heeded me in the midst of volatile events. So 
for someone who is alone in exile, with no one, a stranger, weak, powerless, 
turned with all his strength towards the hereafter, cut off from all social rela-
tions and communication, who has found only a few friends from far aﬁeld 
who also look to the hereafter, and who is a stranger to everyone else and 
whom everyone else regards as a stranger – for such a person to interfere in 
your fruitless, dangerous world would surely be compounded lunacy.

Fifth Point

FIFTH POINT

First Matter

This concerns ﬁve small matters.
T h e      F i r s t :  The worldly ask me: Why don’t you practise the principles 
of our civilization, our style of life, and our manner of dressing? Does this 
mean you oppose us?

M y   R e p l y :  Sirs! What right do you have to propose to me the principles 
of your civilization? For as though casting me outside the laws of civiliza-
tion, you have wrongfully forced me to reside in a village for ﬁve years and 
prohibited me from having any social relations or communication. You left 
all the exiles in the town with their friends and relatives, then gave them 
the papers granting them an amnesty, but without reason you isolated me 
and did not allow me to meet with anyone from my native region, except 
for one or two. That means you do not count me as a member of this nation 
or a citizen. How can you propose that I apply your civil code to myself? 
You have turned  the world into a prison for me. Such things cannot be 
proposed to someone in prison. You closed the door of the world on me, so 
I knocked on the door of the hereafter and divine mercy opened it to me. 
How can the confused customs and principles of the world be dictated to 
someone at the door of the hereafter? Whenever you set me free and return 
me to my native region and restore my rights, then you can require me to 
conform to your principles.

Second Matter

S e c o n d   M a t t e r :  The worldly say: “ We have an ofﬁcial department for 
instructing in the precepts of religion and truths of Islam. On what authority 
do you publish religious works? Since you are a convicted exile, you have 
no right to meddle in these matters. ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  Truth and reality cannot be restricted. How can belief and 
the Qur’an be restricted? You can restrict the principles and laws of your 
world, but the truths of belief and Qur’anic principles cannot be forced into 
the  form  of  worldly  dealings  or  be  given  an  ofﬁcial  guise  in  return  for  a 
wage. Those mysteries, which are divine gifts, those blessings, come rather 

474

THE RAYS

through  a  sincere  intention  and  giving  up  the  world  and  carnal  pleasures. 
Moreover, that ofﬁcial department of yours accepted me and appointed me 
as a preacher while I was in my home region. I accepted the position, but 
rejected the salary. I have the document in my possession. With it I can act 
as an i m a m  and preacher everywhere, because my being exiled was unjust. 
Also, since the exiles have been returned, my old documents are still valid.

Secondly: I addressed the truths of belief I have written directly at my 
own soul. I do not invite everyone. Rather, those whose spirits are needy 
and hearts wounded search out and ﬁnd those Qur’anic remedies. Only, to 
secure my livelihood I had printed a treatise of mine about the resurrection 
of the dead before the new script was introduced. And the former governor, 
who was unfair to me, studied the treatise, but did nothing against it since he 
could ﬁnd nothing in it to criticize.

Third Matter

T h i r d  

   M a t t e r :   Some  of  my  friends  remain  apparently  aloof  from  me 
because the worldly look on me with suspicion and in order to curry favour 
with the worldly, indeed, they criticize me. But the cunning worldly attribute 
their aloofness and avoiding me not to their loyalty to the worldly but to a 
sort of hypocrisy and lack of conscience, and they look on those friends of 
mine coldly.

So I say this: O my friends of the hereafter! Don’t hold back from me as 
a servant of the Qur’an and run away. Allah willing, no harm will come to 
you from me. Suppose some calamity is visited on you or I am oppressed, 
you still cannot be saved by avoiding me. By doing that you will make your-
selves more deserving of being visited by a calamity and receiving a blow. 
And what is there, that you should have these groundless fears?

Fourth Matter

F o u r t h      M a t t e r :  I see during this time of exile that certain boastful peo-
ple who have fallen into the swamp of politics regard me in a partisan man-
ner, with rivalry, as though I were connected with the worldly movements 
like they are.

Sirs! I am in the current of belief. Before me is the current of unbelief. 
I have no connection with other currents or movements. Perhaps some of 
those who work for a wage consider themselves excused to a degree. But 
to assume a stance opposing me in rivalry in the name of patriotism for no 
wage, and to harass me and oppress me, is truly a grievous error. For as was 
proved above, I have no connection at all with world politics. I have dedi-
cated all my time and my life to the truths of belief and the Qur’an. Since it is 
thus, the person who torments and harasses me in rivalry should realize that 
to do so is like harming belief in the name of atheism and unbelief.

Fifth Matter

THE FOURTEENTH RAY – SIXTEENTH LETTER 

475

F i f t h      M a t t e r :  Since this world is transitory, and life is short, and one’s 
essential  duties  are  many,  and  eternal  life  is  gained  here;  and  since  this 
guesthouse of the world is not without an owner, indeed, has a most wise 
and generous director, and neither good nor bad will remain without recom-
pense; and since according to the verse,

( 2:286 ) ¬  «  ª  ©   ¨  § 
there is no obligation that is insupportable, and a safe way is preferable to a 
harmful one, and since friends and ranks last only till the door of the grave; 
then surely the most fortunate person is the one who does not forget the here-
after for this world, nor sacriﬁce the hereafter for this world, nor destroy the 
life of the hereafter for worldly life, nor waste his life on trivial things, but 
considers himself to be a guest and acts in accordance with the commands of 
the guesthouse’s Owner, then opens the door of the grave in conﬁdence and 
enters upon eternal happiness. 1

* * *

1.  The reason for these ‘sinces’ is this: I take no notice of the wrongs and tyranny 
perpetrated against my person and give them no importance. I say, “ They are not worth 
worrying about, ” and I do not interfere in the world.

An Addendum
to the Sixteenth Letter

Without reason the worldly became suspicious of a powerless stranger 
like myself, and imagining me to have the power of thousands, put me under 
numerous restrictions. They did not give permission for me to stay a night 
or two in Bedre, a district of Barla, or on one of the mountains of Barla. I 
heard that they say: “Said possesses the power of ﬁfty thousand soldiers, so 
we can’t set him free.”

So  I  say:  You  unhappy  people  whose  view  is  restricted  to  this  world! 
How is it that you do not know the matters of the world, despite working 
for it with all your strength, and govern it like lunatics? If it is my person 
you fear, one soldier even could do more than me, let alone ﬁfty thousand. 
That is, he could be posted at the door of my room and tell me: “ You can’t 
go out! ”

But  if  it  is  my  profession  and  my  being  herald  of  the  Qur’an  and  the 
moral strength of belief that you fear, then you are wrong; you should be 
aware that in that respect, I have the strength of ﬁfty million soldiers, not 
ﬁfty thousand! For through the strength of the All-Wise Qur’an, I challenge 
all Europe including your irreligious people. Through the lights of belief I 
have published I have razed the sturdy bastions they call the physical sci-
ences and nature. I have cast down lower than animals their loftiest irreli-
gious philosophers. If all Europe were to gather, of which your irreligious 
people are a part, through Allah’s assistance, they could not make me recant 
a single matter of that way of mine. Allah willing, they could not defeat me!
Since the matter is thus, I do not interfere in your world, so don’t you 

interfere in my hereafter! If you do, it will be of no avail.

The  worldly  are  exceptionally  and  excessively  suspicious  of  me;  quite 
simply, they are frightened of me. Imagining about me non-existent things

477

that even if they did exist would not constitute a political crime and could 
not be the cause of accusation, like being a shaikh, or having high rank or 
belonging to a powerful family, or being a tribal leader and inﬂuential and 
having numerous followers, or meeting with people from my native region, 
or being involved in the affairs of the world, or even entering politics or the 
opposition; imagining such things about me, they have been carried away by 
groundless fears. At a time they are discussing pardoning those in prison and 
outside, that is, those that according to them cannot be pardoned, they have 
quite simply barred me from everything. A bad and ephemeral person wrote 
the following good and enduring words:

I f   t y r a n n y   h a s   c a n n o n ,   s h o t ,   a n d   f o r t s ,
R i g h t   h a s   a n   u n t w i s t a b l e   a r m ,   a   c o n s t a n t   f a c e .

And I say:

I f   t h e   w o r l d l y   h a v e   r u l e ,   p o w e r,   a n d   s t r e n g t h ,
T h r o u g h   t h e   Q u r ’ a n ’s   e f f u l g e n c e ,   i t s   s e r v a n t

H e   h a s   a n   u n e r r i n g   h e a r t ,   a n   u n q u e n c h a b l e   l i g h t .

Many friends, as well as a military commander under whose surveillance 
I was, repeatedly asked: “ Why don’t you apply for the release papers and 
present a petition? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  I do not apply and I cannot apply for ﬁve or six reasons:
The First: I did not interfere in the worldly’s world that I should have 
been convicted and so apply to them. I was convicted by divine determining; 
my faults are before it, and I apply to it.

The Second: I believe and have certain knowledge that this world is a 
swiftly  changing  guesthouse.  It  is  not  the  true  homeland  and  everywhere 
is the same. Since I will not remain permanently in my home region, it is 
pointless to struggle for it; it is not worth going there. Since everywhere is a 
guesthouse, if the mercy of the guesthouse’s Owner befriends one, everyone 
is a friend and everywhere is familiar. Whereas if it does not befriend one, 
everywhere is a load on the heart and everyone is hostile.

The Third: Application should be within the framework of the law, but 
the way I have been treated these six years has been arbitrary and outside the 
law. The Exiles’ Law was not applied to me. They looked on me as being 
stripped of all the rights of civilization and even of all worldly rights. It is 
meaningless to apply in the name of the law to those whose treatment of me 
has been thus outside the law.

478

THE RAYS

The Fourth: This year, the local ofﬁcial applied in my name for me to 
stay for a few days in the village of Bedre, which is a sort of district of Barla, 
for a change of air. How can those who reject such an unimportant request 
be applied to? To apply to them would be a futile, degrading abasement.

The Fifth:To claim a right before those who claim a wrong to be right, 
and to apply to them, is a wrong. It is disrespectful towards right. I do not 
want to perpetrate such a wrong and show disrespect for right. And that’s 
that!

The Sixth: The distress and difﬁculty the worldly have caused me has 
not been due to politics, because they know I do not meddle in politics but 
ﬂee  from  them.  Rather,  knowingly  or  unknowingly,  they  torment  me  on 
account of aggressive atheism because I adhere to religion. In which case, to 
apply to them infers regretting religion and ﬂattering the cause of aggressive 
atheism.

Moreover, divine determining, which is just, would punish me through 
their tyrannical hand if I applied to them and had recourse to them, for they 
oppress me because I am religious. As for divine determining, from time to 
time it represses me due to my hypocrisy before the worldly, because I am 
deﬁcient in religion and in sincerity. Since this is so, for the time being I can-
not be saved from this distress. If I apply to the worldly, divine determining 
would say: “Hypocrite! Pay the penalty for applying!” And if I do not apply, 
the worldly say: “You don’t recognize us, go on suffering difﬁculties! ”

The Seventh Reason: It is well-known that the ofﬁcial’s duty is to allow 
harmful individuals no opportunity to cause harm and to assist those who are 
beneﬁcial. Whereas the ofﬁcial who took me into custody approached me, 
an elderly guest at the door of the grave, when I was expounding a subtle 
َ(cid:202) as though I were perpetrat-
aspect of belief contained in the phrase  ُ
ing some misdemeanour, although he had not been to me for a long time pre-
viously. He caused the sincere unfortunate who was listening to be deprived 
of the instruction, and made me angry. But there were other people there, 
and he gave them no importance. Then when they acted discourteously in a 
way that would poison the life of the village, he started to be gracious and 
appreciative towards them.

ّ(cid:202)ِا َهٰ(cid:170)ِا  ٓ

ّ(cid:195)ا  َ

Furthermore, it is well-known that someone in prison who has committed 
a hundred crimes can meet with the ofﬁcial supervising him whether he be 
of high rank or low. But during this last year, although two people important 
in the eyes of the national government who were charged with supervising 

ٰ
THE FOURTEENTH RAY – SIXTEENTH LETTER 

479

me  have  passed  by  my  house  several  times,  they  have  absolutely  neither 
met with me nor asked after me. At ﬁrst I supposed that they avoided me 
out of enmity, then it transpired that it was due to their fearful suspicions; 
they were ﬂeeing from me as though as I were going to gobble them up. So 
to recognize a government whose members and ofﬁcials are like them and 
have recourse to it and apply to it, is not sensible but a futile abasement. If it 
had been the Old Said, he would have said like ‘Antara:
ِز ِ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)ِا(cid:92) ُمـَ

ّ(cid:179)َ(cid:183)َ(cid:106)َو   *   َمـَ
The Old Said no longer exists, and the New Said considers it meaningless to 
talk with the worldly. Let their world be the end of them! They can do what 
they like. He is silent, saying, we shall be judged together with them at the 
Last Judgement.

ّ(cid:179)َ(cid:183)َ(cid:107)ﯬﯦ ٍةَ

The Eighth Reason for my not applying: According to the rule, “The 
result of illicit love is merciless torment,” divine determining, which is just, 
torments me through the tyrannous hand of the worldly, because I incline 
towards them and they are not worthy of it. So saying, “I deserve this tor-
ment,” I remain silent. For in the Great War I fought as the commander of a 
volunteer regiment. Applauded by the commander-in-chief of the army and 
Enver Paşa, I sacriﬁced my valuable students and friends. I was wounded and 
taken prisoner. Returning from captivity, I cast myself into danger through 
such works as T h e   S e v e n   S t e p s , aiming them at the heads of the British, who 
had  occupied  Istanbul.  I  assisted  those  who  now  hold  me  without  reason 
in this torturous captivity. As for them, they punish me in this way for that 
help. Those friends here cause me in three months the hardship and distress 
I suffered in three years as a prisoner-of-war in Russia. Nor did the Russians 
prevent me from giving religious instruction, although they regarded me as a 
Kurdish militia commander, a cruel man who had slaughtered Cossacks and 
prisoners. I used to instruct the great majority of my ninety fellow–ofﬁcer 
prisoners. One time, the Russian commander came and listened. Because he 
did not know Turkish, he thought it was political instruction and put a stop 
to it. Then later he gave permission. Also, in the same barracks we made a 
room into a mosque and I used to lead the prayers. They did not interfere 
at all. They did not prevent me from mixing, or from communicating, with 
the others. Whereas my friends  here, my fellow citizens and co-religionists 
and  those  for  whose  beneﬁts  in  the  form  of  religious  belief  I  have  strug-
gled, have held me in distressing captivity not for three years but for six, 

1. D ī w ā n   ‘ A n t a r a   (ed. Majīd T˘arrād), 135.

480

THE RAYS

for absolutely no reason and although they know I have severed all my rela-
tions  with  the  world.  They  have  prevented  me  mixing  with  others.  They 
have  prevented  me  from  giving  religious  instruction  despite  my  having  a 
certiﬁcate, and even from giving private instruction in my room. They have 
prevented me from communicating with others. They have even barred me 
from  the  mosque  which  I  repaired  and  where  I  acted  as  prayer-leader  for 
four years, although I had the necessary certiﬁcate. And now, to deprive me 
of the merit of performing the prayers in congregation, they do not accept 
me as prayer-leader even for three private individuals, my permanent con-
gregation and brothers of the hereafter.

Furthermore, if, although I do not want it, someone is to call me good, 
the ofﬁcial who holds me in surveillance is jealous and angry. Thinking he 
will destroy my inﬂuence, he entirely unscrupulously takes precautions and 
pesters me in order to curry favour with his superiors.

Who can someone in such a position have recourse to anyone other than 
Allah Almighty? If the judge is also the claimant, of course he cannot com-
plain to him. Come on, you say, what can we say to this? You say what you 
like, I say this: there are many dissemblers among these friends of mine. A 
dissembler is worse than an unbeliever. That is the reason they make me suf-
fer what the inﬁdel Russian did not make me suffer.

You unfortunates! What have I done to you and what I am doing? I am 
trying to save your belief and am serving your eternal happiness! It means 
that my service is not sincere and purely for Allah’s sake so that it has the 
reverse effect. In return, you torment me at every opportunity. For sure, we 
shall meet at the Last Judgement. I say:

riencing  the  calamity  of  prison,  and  for  those  who  kindly  help  them  and 
faithfully supervise their food, which comes from outside.

F i r s t   P o i n t :  Each day spent in prison may gain as much as ten days’ wor-
ship, and, with regards to their fruits, may transform those transient hours 
into enduring hours, and through ﬁve or ten years’ punishment may be the 
means of saving a person from millions of years of eternal imprisonment. 
For the believers, the condition for gaining this most signiﬁcant and valuable 
advantage is to perform the obligatory prayers, repent for the sins that were 
the cause of their imprisonment, and offer thanks in patience. Prison is any-
way an obstacle to many sins; it does not provide the opportunity for them.
S e c o n d   P o i n t :  Just as the cessation of pleasure causes pain, so does the 
cessation of pain give pleasure. Yes, on thinking of past happy, enjoyable 
days, everyone feels a pang of regret and longing, and says: “ Alas! ”, and 
recalling calamitous, unhappy days of the past, experiences a sort of pleas-
ure  since  they  are  passed,  and  says:  “ Praise  and  thanks  be  to  Allah,  that 
calamity has left its reward and departed. ” He breathes a sigh of relief. That 
is to say, an hour’s temporary pain and sorrow leave behind a sort of pleas-
ure in the spirit, while a pleasurable hour leaves a pain.

Since the reality is thus; and since past calamitous hours together with 
their  pains  are  no  longer  existent,  and  future  distressing  days  are  at  the 
present time non-existent, and there is no pain from nothing, to continually 
eat bread and drink water today, for example, because of the possibility of 
being hungry and thirsty in several days’ time, is most foolish. In just the 
same way, to think now of the past and future unhappy hours, which simply 
do  not  exist,  and  to  display  impatience,  and  ignoring  one’s  faulty  self,  to 
moan as though complaining about Allah is also most foolish. So long as 
the power of patience is not scattered to left and right, that is, to the past and 
future, and is held ﬁrm in the face of the present of hour and day, it is suf-
ﬁcient. The distress is reduced from ten to one.

In fact, but let it not be complaining, divine favour pointed out the above 
fact to me while, during a few days of material and spiritual afﬂiction, ill-
ness and trial the like of which I had never before experienced in my life, I 
was being crushed in particular by the despair and distress of the heart and 
spirit which resulted from my being unable to serve the Qur’an and belief 

481

with  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r .  I  was  then  content  with  my  distressing  illness  and 
imprisonment. For, saying: “ It is great proﬁt for an unfortunate like myself 
who waits at the door of the grave to make one hour which might be passed 
in heedlessness ten hours’ worth of worship, ” I gave thanks.

T h i r d   P o i n t :  There is great gain in compassionately aiding and assisting 
prisoners,  in  giving  them  the  sustenance  they  need,  and  in  soothing  their 
spiritual  wounds  with  consolation.  Giving  them  their  food  which  comes 
from outside is like almsgiving which, exactly to the amount of the food, is 
written in the book of good deeds of those, outside and inside, who do this, 
together with the warders concerned. Especially if the unhappy prisoner is 
old,  ill,  poor,  or  a  stranger,  then  the  reward  of  this  almsgiving  increases 
many times over.

This high proﬁt is conditional on performing the obligatory prayers so 
that  such  service  is  for  Allah’s  sake,  and  on  hastening  to  their  assistance 
with sincerity, compassion and joy, and in such a way as to not make them 
feel obliged.

A Short Addendum from A   G u i d e   F o r   Yo u t h

ُهَ(cid:178)اَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126) ِه ِ(cid:175)ـ ْ(cid:126)اِ(cid:92)

People in prison are in great need of the true consolation of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r . Particularly those who having suffered the blows of youth, are passing 
their sweet, young lives in prison; they need the R i s a l e - i  N u r  as much as they 
need bread.

Indeed, youth heeds the emotions rather than reason, and emotions and 
desires are blind; they do not consider the consequences. They prefer one 
ounce of immediate pleasure to tons of future pleasure. They kill for the one 
minute pleasure of revenge, then suffer for eighty thousand hours the pain of 
prison. And one hour’s dissolute pleasure in questions of honour may result 
in life’s enjoyment being utterly destroyed due to distress at the fear of both 
prison and enemies. There are many other examples, many pitfalls for the 
unfortunate young because of which they transform their sweet lives into the 
most bitter and pitiable lives.

Consider  a  vast  state  to  the  north;  1  it  has  gained  possession  of  the 
passions  of  its  young  people  and  is  shaking  this  century  with  its  storms. 

1.  This refers to Russia. [ Tr. ]

For it has made lawful for its youths the pleasing daughters and wives of 
upright people, and these youths act only according to their feelings, which 
are blind to all consequences. By permitting men and women to go together 
to the public baths, they are even encouraging immorality. And they con-
sider it lawful for vagabonds and the poor to plunder the property of the rich. 
All humanity trembles in the face of this calamity.

It is therefore most necessary in this century for all Muslim youths to act 
heroically, and to respond to this two-pronged attack with keen swords like 
T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f  and  A   G u i d e   F o r   Yo u t h  from the  R i s a l e - i   N u r . Other-
wise those unfortunate youths will destroy utterly both their futures in this 
world,  and  their  agreeable  lives,  and  their  happiness  in  the  hereafter,  and 
their eternal lives, and transform them into torment and suffering. Further-
more, through their abuses and dissoluteness, they will end up in hospitals, 
and through their excesses in life, in prisons. In their old age, they will weep 
copiously with a thousand regrets.

If, on the other hand, they protect themselves with Qur’anic training and 
with  the  truths  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  they  will  become  truly  heroic  youths, 
perfect  human  beings,  successful  Muslims,  and  in  some  ways  rulers  over 
animate beings and the rest of the animal kingdom.

When a youth in prison spends one hour out of the twenty-four each 
day on the ﬁve obligatory prayers, and repents for the mistakes that were 
the cause of his disaster, and abstains from other harmful, painful sins, this 
will be of great beneﬁt for both his life, and his future, and his country, and 
his nation, and his relatives, and he will also gain with his ﬂeeting youth 
of ten to ﬁfteen years an eternal, brilliant youth. Foremost the Qur’an of 
Miraculous Exposition, and all the revealed scriptures, have given this cer-
tain good news.

If such a youth demonstrates through moderation and obedience, his grat-
itude for the pleasing, delightful bounty of youth, it will both increase it, and 
make it eternal, and make it a pleasure. Otherwise it will be both calamitous, 
and become painful, grievous, and a nightmare, and then it will depart. It 
will cause him to become like a vagrant, harmful for both his relatives, and 
his country, and his nation.

If the prisoner has been sentenced unjustly, on condition he performs 
the obligatory prayers, each hour will be the equivalent of a day’s worship, 
and the prison will be like a recluse’s cell. He will be counted among the 
pious hermits of olden times who retired to caves in order to devote them-
selves to worship. If he is poor, aged, and ill, and desirous of the truths of 

484

THE RAYS

belief, on condition he performs the obligatory prayers and repents, each 
hour will become the equivalent of twenty hours’ worship, and prison will 
become  like  a  resthouse  for  him,  and  because  of  his  friends  there  who 
regard him with affection, a place of love, training, and education. He will 
probably  be  happier  staying  in  prison  than  being  free,  for  outside  he  is 
confused and subject to the assaults of sins from all sides. He may receive 
a complete education from prison. On being released, it will not be as a 
murderer or thirsting for revenge, but as someone penitent, proven by trial, 
well-behaved, and beneﬁcial for his nation. In fact, the Denizli prisoners 
became so extraordinarily well-behaved after studying the R i s a l e - i   N u r  for 
only a short time that some of those concerned said: “ Studying the R i s a l e -
i   N u r  for ﬁfteen weeks is more effective at reforming them than putting 
them in prison for ﬁfteen years. ”

Since  death  does  not  die,  and  the  appointed  hour  is  unknown,  it  may 
come  at  any  time;  and  since  the  grave  cannot  be  closed,  and  troop  after 
troop enter it and are lost; and since it has been shown through the truths 
of the Qur’an that for those who believe death is transformed into the dis-
charge papers releasing them from eternal annihilation, while for the corrupt 
and the dissolute it is disappearing for ever into eternal annihilation, and is 
unending separation from their loved ones and all beings, most certainly and 
with no doubt at all, the most fortunate person is he who with patience and 
thanks fully beneﬁts from his time in prison, and studying the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
works to serve the Qur’an and his belief on the straight path.

O  you  who  is  addicted  to  enjoyment  and  pleasure!  I  am  seventy-ﬁve 
years old, and I know with utter certainty from thousands of experiences, 
proofs,  and  events  that  true  enjoyment,  pain-free  pleasure,  grief-free  joy, 
and life’s happiness are to be found only in belief and in the sphere of the 
truths of faith. While a single worldly pleasure yields numerous pains; as 
though dealing ten slaps for a single grape, it drives away all life’s pleasure.
O you unfortunates who are experiencing the misfortune of prison! Since 
your world is weeping and your life is bitter, strive so that your hereafter 
will not also weep, and your eternal life will smile and be sweet! Beneﬁt 
from prison! Just as sometimes under severe conditions in the face of the 
enemy,  an  hour’s  watch  may  be  equivalent  to  a  year’s  worship,  so  in  the 
severe conditions you are experiencing, the hardship of each hour spent as 
worship becomes the equivalent of many hours, it transforms that hardship 
into mercy.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
I offer you not my condolences but my congratulations. Since for some 
instance of wisdom divine determining has sent us to this third School of 
Joseph (   M e d r e s e - i   Yu s u ﬁ y e   ) , 1 and has speciﬁed that we should eat some of 
the sustenance allotted us here and it is that sustenance that has summoned 
here; and since as we have understood certainly from our past experiences, 
divine favour has manifested on us the meaning of the verse, 
( 2:216 )  . - , + * ) (  and  since  our  new  brothers  here 
in this School of Joseph are in more need of the solace of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
than anyone, and the members of the judiciary are more in need of the rules 
and  other  sacred  laws  set  out  in  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   than  other  ofﬁcials;  and 
since the very numerous copies of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  are performing your duty 
outside and their conquests do not cease; and since each ﬂeeting hour passed 
here  is  the  equivalent  of  eternal  hours  passed  in  worship;  surely,  because 
of  these  points,  we  should  joyfully  offer  thanks  for  this  affair  in  perfect 
patience and with fortitude. I am going to repeat exactly to you all the short 
letters I wrote as consolation in Denizli Prison. Allah willing, those apposite 
notes will comfort you too.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
F i r s t l y :  I offer Almighty Allah endless thanks that heroes have emerged 
from among the muftis, preachers, i m a m s , and h o d j a s , for it is they who in 
fact should lay claim to the R i s a l e - i   N u r . Up to now, it has been the youth, 
those  educated  in  the  secular  schools,  and  their  teachers  who  have  been 
devoted to the R i s a l e - i   N u r . Now, thanks be to Allah, Ethem, the İbrahims 
and Ali Osmans have cleared the names of the students and teachers of the 
religious schools, and transformed their timidity into courage.

S e c o n d l y :   They  should  not  worry  about  this  incident,  which  occurred 
due  to  their  wholehearted  activities  and  excitement.  For  in  respect  of  its 
consequences, Denizli Prison caused those who had acted incautiously to be 
congratulated. Its difﬁculties were few and immaterial beneﬁts, numerous. 
This third School of Joseph will not lag behind the second, Allah willing.

T h i r d l y :  Since the merit increases proportionately to the hardships, we 
should offer thanks for these conditions. We should try to perform our duties

of serving religious belief with sincerity, which is our duty, and not concern 
ourselves with being successful or obtaining good results, which is Allah’s 
concern. We should say: اَ(cid:182)ُز َ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:110)َا ِروُ(cid:174)ُ

is a sign of the acceptability of our actions and a diploma for having passed 
the examination of our sacred struggle.

I have a petition I want to put before the prison administra-
tors, and chieﬂy the prison governor, which is apparently 
unimportant, but has great importance in my eyes

After spending twenty-two years in total isolation, my seventy-ﬁve-year-
old body cannot sustain inoculations. In fact, long ago they inoculated me, 
and it left a suppurating wound which persisted for twenty years. It was like 
a  chronic  poisoning.  Two  doctors  in  Emirdağ  and  my  friends  there  know 
this.  Also,  four  years  ago  in  Denizli  they  inoculated  me  together  with  all 
the other prisoners. Although it had no harmful effects on any of them, it 
made me ill for three weeks. Thanks to divine preservation, I was not forced 
to  go  to  the  hospital,  which  for  me  is  dangerous.  It  is  absolutely  certain 
that my body cannot take inoculations. Both my excuses are powerful, and 
being  extremely  weak  at  the  age  of  seventy-ﬁve,  I  can  take  the  inocula-
tion only of a ten-year-old child. Moreover, because I am in perpetual soli-
tary conﬁnement, I do not have contact with anyone. Also, two months ago 
the provincial governor sent two doctors to Emirdağ to give me a thorough 
examination. They could ﬁnd no trace of any contagious disease, only that I 
had lumbago, and was extremely weak, elderly, and alone. This condition of 
mine certainly does not oblige me to be inoculated.

I also have a very important request of you: Don’t send me to hospital. 
Don’t force me into a situation I could never have endured these twenty-two 
years of solitary conﬁnement, that is, to be put under the command of nurses 
I do not know. I have started to think of entering the grave as being pleasant, 
but for now I have chosen prison, for the sake of the prison administrators, 
whose humanity I have witnessed, and to console the other prisoners.

My Dear , Loyal Brothers!
F i r s t l y :  Don’t be upset at my being ill-treated or at the contempt directed 
at  my  person.  For  they  can  ﬁnd  no  fault  in  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   so  struggle 
against my unimportant and faulty self instead. I am pleased at this. I am 
bound by what I have learnt from the R i s a l e - i   N u r  to proudly offer thanks, if 
for its well-being and honour, I suffer pains, misfortune, and insults even a 
thousand times greater. So you should not pity me in this respect.

S e c o n d l y :   The  widespread,  ﬁerce,  and  merciless  attack  has  for  now 
abated twentyfold. They rounded up a few people in place of thousands of 
select ( h â s   )  1  R i s a l e - i   N u r  students, and a handful of new brothers instead 
of hundreds of thousands of people who are concerned. That is, divine grace 
made the assault very insigniﬁcant.

T h i r d l y :  Through divine grace, the former provincial governor, who for 
two years was conspiring against us, has been repulsed and there is a strong 
possibility that the Interior Minister, whose suspicions had been excessively 
aroused about us, has ameliorated this ﬁerce assault due to his being from 
the  same  place  and  his  forefathers  having  been  very  religious.  So  do  not 
despair or be alarmed!

F o u r t h l y :   Numerous  experiences  and  events  have  shown  in  a  way  to 
make one completely certain that if the R i s a l e - i   N u r  weeps, either the earth 
quakes or the skies weep too. As we have often seen with our own eyes and 
in part proved in court, the start of winter smiling like summer in unprec-
edented fashion coincided with the R i s a l e - i   N u r  smiling at its being secretly 
duplicated by machine and published, and then on its weeping when it came 
to a standstill with the widespread searches and conﬁscations, this coincided 
with the sudden severe wrath and weeping of winter. It is my guess that this 
is a powerful sign that the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is a supreme, shining miracle of the 
Qur’anic truth this age, and that the earth and universe are concerned with it.

they  are  performing  a  huge  service  in  a  short  time,  like  doing  a  hundred 
year’s work in ten years. Also, they are embarking on this exacting struggle 
and the trial of this new School of Joseph, in order to have a active share in 
its universal, far-reaching and valuable consequences. They are also meeting 
with their loyal, sincere brothers without difﬁculty, whom they were eager 
to see, and they are studying together. Since the easy times in this world do 
not continue and go for nothing, surely the people who make high gains with 
such little trouble should be congratulated.

My brothers! This widespread attack is against the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s con-
quests. But they have understood that the more the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is attacked, 
the  more  brilliantly  it  shines;  the  circle  of  those  it  teaches  is  expanded 
and gains in importance; it is not defeated; it only slips behind the veil of 
ْتَرَ
ّر ِ(cid:126) . 1 For this reason they have changed their tactics and no longer 
attack  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   openly.  But  divine  favour  overspreads  us,  so  we 
should offer thanks in perfect patience.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
It has become necessary to explain two of my strange and subtle states 

of mind.

T h e   F i r s t :   When,  being  in  solitary  conﬁnement,  I  was  unable  to  meet 
with  my  brothers  such  as  yourselves,  whom  I  love  more  than  my  life,  it 
was imparted to me that there was a divine favour and a beneﬁt in this. For 
numerous of our brothers of the hereafter were spending ﬁfty liras coming 
to  Emirdağ  to  see  me,  for  ﬁfty  minutes,  some  for  ten  minutes,  and  some 
returned without seeing me at all, and these they would have thrown into this 
School of Joseph on some pretext. Even if with my little available time and 
the state of mind arising from my seclusion I had been able to, the work of 
serving the R i s a l e - i   N u r  would not have permitted me to converse at length 
with those devoted friends.

S e c o n d l y :  One time a famous scholar was seen on numerous fronts in the 
War by those who had gone to the j i h a d . They said to him... And he replied:

ّوَ(cid:179)َ(cid:98) ا ً

“ Certain saints are doing this in my place in order to gain reward for me and 
allow the people of belief to beneﬁt from my teaching. ” In exactly the same 
way, in Denizli it was even made known ofﬁcially that I had been seen in 
mosques there, and the governor and warders were informed. Some of them 
became alarmed, asking, “ Who opened the prison gates for him? ” Exactly 
the same thing happened here. But rather than attributing a very minor won-
der  to  my  own  very  faulty  and  unimportant  self,  T h e   R a t i f y i n g   S t a m p   o f  
t h e   U n s e e n   C o l l e c t i o n ,  which  proves  and  demonstrates  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s 
wonders, wins conﬁdence in it a hundred or rather a thousand times more, 
and  ratiﬁes  its  acceptance.  And  the  heroic  students  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   in 
particular ratify it with their pens and states, which are truly wonders.

Don’t worry about me, I am pleased and happy just to be together with 

you in the same building.

Our task now: one set of my defence speeches should be sent to Isparta. If 
possible, twenty copies should be made both in the new letters, and by dupli-
cating machine in the old. It should even be shown to the public prosecutor 
there. A copy should also be given to our lawyer in person, and another copy 
given to the prison governor, which he should give to our defence lawyer. 
It should also be sent in both the new letters and the old to the departments 
of government in Ankara, as it was sent while we were in Denizli. If pos-
sible, ﬁve copies should be prepared to send to Ankara. For the copies of 
the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   in  the  old  letters  which  were  seized,  were  sent  to  those 
departments, and particularly to the Directorate of Religious Affairs, before 
being sent here. Also, tell our lawyer, Ahmed Bey, that when writing out 
my defence on the typewriter to pay especial attention to its being correct. 
For my manner of expression does not resemble anyone else’s. Sometimes 
a wrong letter, or even a wrong point, changes the matter in question and 
spoils  the  meaning.  Also,  if  you  are  not  given  permission  to  use  the  two 
typewriters that have been sent, they should be returned. Also don’t become

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
The R i s a l e - i   N u r  meets with you in my place and gives excellent instruc-
tion to the new brothers who are eager for it. We have seen from experience 
that to be occupied with the R i s a l e - i   N u r  by either studying it, or reading it 
out loud, or writing it out, affords an expansiveness to the heart, an ease to 
the spirit, health to the body, and makes sustenance plentiful. Now a hero 
of the Risale-i Nur like Husrev1 has been bestowed on you. Allah willing, 
this  School  of  Joseph  will  be  another  blessed  place  of  study,  part  of  the 
Medresetü’z-Zehra.  2 Up to now, I had not shown Husrev to the worldly, 
and  I  was  hiding  him.  But  the  published  collections  have  shown  him  up 
completely to the politicians, and nothing secret has remained. I have there-
fore described two or three of his tasks to my select (h â s ) brothers. But now 
before  us  are  two  awesomely  obdurate  people  in  amongst  those  who  will 
listen to the truth. One of them emerged in Emirdağ, on account of both athe-
ism and communism, and the other here. They are trying with extreme cun-
ning to alarm the ofﬁcials and turn them against us with slander. At present 
we have therefore to act with the greatest caution and not be scared, and to 
bide our time relying on Allah till His grace comes to our assistance.

My friends in prison and brothers in religion!
It occurred to me to explain a truth to you which will save you from both 

worldly torment and the torment of the hereafter. It is as follows:

1.  Husrev Altınbaşak ( 1899-1977 ) was from Isparta and became one of Bediuzza-
man’s leading students. With his ﬁne handwriting he wrote out hundreds of copies of the 
treatises of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . He is reputed to written nine copies of the Qur’an showing 
the coincidences of the name of Allah. He was together with Bediuzzaman in the prisons 
of Eskişehir, Denizli, and Afyon. [ Tr. ]

2.  Medresetü’z-Zehrâ: the Islamic university Bediuzzaman had since his early youth 
endeavoured  to  found  in  eastern Anatolia,  in  which  the  modern  and  religious  sciences 
would be taught side by side, and which he intended would play the central and unifying 
role in Asia that al-Azhar plays in Africa. Despite twice receiving funds for it and actu-
ally laying the foundations, it was never completed due to the vicissitudes of the times. 
Although it was not realized in the form he had originally foreseen, while in Kastamonu 
( 1936-’43 ), he wrote: “ Endless thanks be to Almighty Allah for He has made the prov-
ince of Isparta into a Medresetü’z-Zehrâ, which has long been the goal of my dreams, -into

For example, a person killed someone’s brother or one of his relatives. 
A murder which yields one minute’s pleasure of revenge causes millions of 
minutes of both distress for the heart and the anguish of prison. And the fear 
of revenge by the murdered man’s relatives, and anxiety of ﬁnding himself 
face to face with his enemy drives away all his pleasure in life. He suffers 
the torment of both fear and anger. There is only one solution for this, and 
that is reconciliation, which the Qur’an commands, and truth, reality, ben-
eﬁt, humanity, and Islam require and encourage.

Certainly, in reality what is required is peace, because the appointed hour 
is set, it does not change. Since his appointed hour had come, in any event 
the murdered man would have stayed no longer. As for the murderer, he was 
the means of Allah’s decree being carried out. So long as there is no rec-
onciliation, both sides perpetually suffer the torments of fear and revenge. 
It is because of this that Islam commands that “ one believer should not be 
vexed with another believer for more than three days. ” If the murder was not 
the result of a vindictive grudge and enmity, and a two-faced troublemaker 
instigated the discord, it is essential to make peace quickly. Otherwise, the 
minor disaster becomes a large one, and continues. If they make peace, and 
the murderer repents and prays continuously for the man he killed, then both 
sides  will  gain  much  and  become  like  brothers.  In  place  of  one  departed 
brother, he will gain several religious brothers. He will be resigned to divine 
decree and determining and forgive his enemy. Especially since they heed 
the lessons of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , both individual and public peace and well-
being, and the brotherhood that there is in the sphere of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
require that they put aside all the hard feelings that exist between them.

It was thus in Denizli Prison; all the prisoners who were enemies became 
brothers through the lessons of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . It was one reason for our 
acquittal,  and  caused  even  the  irreligious  and  ungodly  to  say  about  those 
prisoners: “   M a s h a ’ l l a h !   B a r a k a l l a h !   ”  Also it was an utter relief for those 
prisoners. I myself have seen here a hundred men suffer inconvenience on 
account of one man and not go out to take exercise together. It is oppression 
towards  them.  A  manly  believer  of  sound  conscience  will  not  cause  hun-
dreds of other believers harm because of some petty error or beneﬁt. If he 
makes a mistake and does cause harm, he should repent immediately.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
I congratulate both the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , and you all, and myself, and give 
you the good news of Husrev, Hıfzı, and Bartınlı Seyyid. Those who went 
on the Hajj this year learnt that prominent scholars in Mecca were translat-
ing the main collections of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  into both Arabic and Hindustani 
and were trying to have them published. They had also found such favour 
in  Medina  that  they  had  been  placed  on  the  blessed  tomb  of  the  Prophet 
( UWBP ) in the R a w d a t   a l - M u t a h h a r a . Haji Seyyid saw with his own eyes 
T h e   S t a f f   o f   M o s e s   (   A s â - y ı   M û s a   )  on the Prophet’s tomb. That means it has 
been found acceptable by the Prophet ( UWBP ) and was met with pleasure 
by him ( UWBP ). As we told the people who were going from here to make 
the Hajj, we had made the intention and the R i s a l e - i   N u r  was going to visit 
those  blessed  places  in  our  stead.  Endless  thanks  be  to  Allah,  one  of  the 
many beneﬁts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  heroes publishing those collections after 
having corrected them, is that they saved me both from the task of correct-
ing them myself and from that anxiety; so too, since those copies will form 
the source for others written out by hand, they have become like hundreds 
of  correctors.  May  the  Most  Merciful  of  the  Merciful  have  written  in  the 
records of their good works, a thousand merits for each letter of those col-
lections. Amen. Amen. Amen.

An Auspicious Dream
which turned out to be true

Ali, who assists me, came to me and said: “ I had a dream in which you 
and  Husrev  kissed  the  hand  of  the  Prophet  Muhammad  ( Upon  whom  be 
blessings and peace ). ” Then I received the letter telling me that the Hajjis 
had seen T h e   S t a f f   o f   M o s e s   C o l l e c t i o n , which had been written out by Hus-
rev, on the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) tomb. This is to say, in effect  T h e   S t a f f   o f

My Dear, Loyal Brothers and Companions in Prison!
F i r s t l y :  Do not worry that we have not been able to meet in person. We 
are constantly together in spirit. Whichever of the treatises of the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r  you are able to get hold of and read, and which you listen to, you will 
see me within it, but as a servant of the Qur’an instead of my insigniﬁcant 
person,  and  you  may  converse  with  me.  For  my  part,  I  meet  with  you  in 
imagination  in  all  my  prayers  and  in  what  you  have  written,  and  it  is  as 
though we are all the time together in some sphere of existence.

S e c o n d l y :  We say this to the new students of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  in this new 
School  of  Joseph:  as  indicated  by  the  Qur’an,  and  as  even  the  committee 
of experts had to admit, “ The faithful R i s a l e - i   N u r  students will enter their 
graves in a state of belief. And through the effulgence its collective person-
ality, each student receives a share of the spiritual gains and supplications 
of all his brothers according to his degree. It is as though each seeks divine 
forgiveness and worships with thousands of tongues. ” These two proﬁts and 
results reduce to nothing all the difﬁculties and hardships of this extraordi-
nary time; the two high proﬁts are given their faithful customers at a very 
lost cost.

The Afyon defences contain important truths concerning both ourselves, 

and the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and this country, and the Islamic world.

It is probably necessary to prepare ﬁve to ten copies of them in the new 
letters so they may be sent to the departments of government in Ankara. 
Whether they release us or punish us is of no importance, our task now 
is  to  inform  both  the  government,  and  the  courts,  and  the  nation  of  the 
truths the defences contain. Perhaps that was one reason divine determin-
ing sent us to this place of study. They should be written out by typewriter 
as  quickly  as  possible.  Even  if  they  were  to  release  us  today,  we  would 
still be obliged to send them to Ankara. Don’t be deceived and put it off; 
enough now! Let this be our last defence in the face of the extreme oppres-
sion and unprecedented torments we have suffered three times in ﬁfteen

years  for  the  same  matter  on  trumped-up  charges.  Since  in  the  previous 
courts they legally gave us a typewriter so that we could defend ourselves, 
they can cite no law for depriving us of the right here. If you ﬁnd no solu-
tion ofﬁcially, our lawyer should write out ﬁve copies outside on a type-
writer, but he should pay great attention to their containing no mistakes.

My Loyal New Brothers and Old Prisoners!
I have come to the certain conclusion that, in respect of divine favour, 
you are an important cause in our entering here. That is to say, with its con-
solation and the truths of belief, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is to save both you from the 
distress of this calamity of prison and from much worldly harm, and your 
life from passing proﬁtlessly and in vain through grief and sorrow and being 
wasted on the winds of fancy, and your hereafter from weeping like your 
world is weeping now; it is to provide you with true solace.

Since the reality of the matter is this, of course you must be brothers to 
one another, like the Denizli prisoners and students of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . You 
can see that they examine all your possessions, and food, bread, and soup 
which come from outside so that a knife does not get in among you and you 
do not attack one another. The warders who faithfully serve you suffer much 
trouble. Also, you do not go out to exercise together, as though you were 
going to attack one another like wild beasts. New friends, who are by nature 
bold and courageous! With great moral courage you should say to the group 
at this time:

“ If not knives, but Mausers and revolvers were given us, and the order to 
ﬁre as well, we would not hurt our friends who are unfortunate and suffering 
this calamity like ourselves. Through the guidance and at the command of 
the Qur’an, and belief, and Islamic brotherhood, and our interests, we have 
decided to forgive them and to try not to offend them, even if formerly there 
were a hundred reasons for our hatred and hostility, ” so transforming this 
prison into an auspicious place of study.

at the order of divine determining, impelled by dominical grace. Allah will-

in consequence, and that if the leading students have a value of one in other

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
The reason they nailed up my window today was my greeting the prison-
ers in connection with the trial. They apparently made something else the 
pretext. Don’t be at all anxious. On the contrary, I am earnestly and sincerely 
pleased because they are preoccupied with my unimportant person and not 
causing too much trouble to the Risale-i Nur and its students. Since they are 
persecuting me by insulting and tormenting my person, it means they are 
not doing the same to you and the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and it lessens to an extent 
their interfering with the R i s a l e - i   N u r , so I offer thanks in patience and am 
not anxious. You too should not be at all upset. I am of the opinion that our 
covert enemies’ directing the attention of the ofﬁcials towards my person 
is an instance of divine favour and a good thing from the point of view of 
the  well-being  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   and  its  students.  Certain  of  our  broth-

spectly and not become alarmed. They also should not speak of this matter

naive brothers and those who are not yet accustomed to being cautious, say. 
The spies make mountains out of molehills and may inform on them. Our 
situation  now  is  no  joking  matter.  Nevertheless,  do  not  be  at  all  worried. 
We are under divine protection and are resolved to meet all hardships with 
perfect patience, indeed, with thanks. We are obliged to offer thanks, for a 
small amount of hardship yields plentiful mercy and reward.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
For two important reasons, and in consequence of a powerful warning, 
I have been obliged to leave, with respect to the heart, the task of all the 
defences to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students who have been sent here and will be its 
leading students in the future, especially H, R, T, F, S. 1

F i r s t   R e a s o n :  I understood certainly both in the examining magistrate’s 
ofﬁce, and from numerous other signs, that as far as they possibly can they 
are trying to make difﬁculties for me and to prevent me defeating them intel-
lectually, and that they have received ofﬁcial communications. They are not 
allowing me to speak on various pretexts as though if I do, I shall display 
political and scholarly prowess sufﬁcient to silence the court and practised 
diplomats. In fact, while being questioned, I replied “ I don’t know ” to one 
of the questions. In astonishment the judge asked: “ How could someone of 
your extraordinary intelligence forget something? ” They suppose the won-
drous elevatedness of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its scholarly ﬁndings to be the 
product of my thought and they have taken fright. They do not want to let 
me  speak.  Also,  they  think  that  anyone  who  meets  with  me  immediately 
becomes a devoted  R i s a l e - i   N u r  student, so they do not allow me to meet 
with anyone. The Head of the Directorate of Religious Affairs even said: 
“ Whoever meets with him is immediately drawn to him; his power to attract 
is considerable. ”

This means that the best thing for us now is for me to hand over my work 
to you. And my old and new defence speeches, which you have, should take 
part in your consultations in my place. That is sufﬁcient.

T h e   S e c o n d   R e a s o n :  This is being left to another time. However, a brief 
indication of that warning is this: an extremely powerful duty which looks 
to the hereafter and an effective state of mind, which for twenty-ﬁve years 
have made me give up politics, newspapers, and other transitory things, and 
prevented me being occupied with them, are most deﬁnitely preventing me 
being preoccupied with this question in detail. When consulting with your 
two defence lawyers, you may sometimes discuss my duty too.

* * *

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
This was imparted to me now as I was performing the prayers: because 
of their excessively good opinion of you, your brothers await instruction and 
assistance, both material and spiritual, from you. Just as in worldly affairs 
you have handed things over to the select (hâs) students, leaving these mat-
ters to the leading students (erkân) to confer over, and you were right to do 
so; so you too have appointed the Risale-i Nur and the collective person-
ality  of  its  students  to  perform  your  scholarly  work  related  to  belief,  the 
Qur’an and the hereafter. The collective personality of those purely sincere 
select students performs that duty of yours much more completely than you, 
in addition to the duties of its members. They always have done so up to 
now. For instance, someone who meets with you and receives brief, minor 
instruction and a little advice, may receive from a single part of the Risale-
i  Nur  instruction  a  hundred  times  greater.  They  may  also  receive  advice 
from it. Thinking that their collective personality, whose station is extremely 
elevated and prayers acceptable, is an Ustad and helper who, Allah willing, 
is always with them, it was consolation for my spirit, and good news, and 
made me feel at peace.

Ankara  caused  our  defence  speeches,  which  had  been  sent  to  six  depart-
ments of government there, to explode, without causing us harm, Allah will-
ing; and the angry stove which had been lit against us split into two without 
harming  us.  It  is  also  possible  that  my  beloved  stove,  my  only  and  very 
useful companion, listened to my sorrows and entreaties, and was giving me 
the news: “ You’re going to depart from this dark dungeon, no need remains 
for me.”

Today,  on  receiving  a  spiritual  warning,  I  felt  a  disquiet,  a  grief,  on 
account of you. Just when I was feeling upset at those of my brothers who 
being anxious about their livelihoods want to be released quickly, a blessed 
memory occasioned a truth and some good tidings to be imparted to me: the 
Three Months will begin in ﬁve days time, which are truly blessed and are 
the months of highly meritorious worship. For if the reward yielded by good 
works at other times are tenfold, in the month of Rajab they are more than 
a hundredfold, in Sha‘ban they exceed three hundredfold, and in Ramadan 
they reach a thousandfold, while on Fridays in Ramadan they reach thou-
sands and on the Night of Power may reach thirty thousand. It is certainly 
highly proﬁtable therefore, to spend those three months -which are thus a 
sacred market for the trade of the hereafter earning plentiful gains for it, and 
an exceptional exhibition for the people of reality and worship, and in three 
months may secure for the believers a life of eighty years- in this School of 
Joseph, which increases the proﬁts tenfold. Whatever the hardships suffered, 
they are pure mercy. As with worship, so with the service of the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r ;  with  respect  not  to  quantity  but  quality,  its  proﬁts  are  ﬁvefold.  For 
people are continuously entering this guesthouse, then being released, and 
they are means of the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s lessons being disseminated. Sometimes 
one man’s sincerity yields the beneﬁts of twenty men. It is of no importance 
if such a man suffers a little hardship and distress so that the mystery of the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s sincerity might spread among the unfortunate prisoners, who 
are inclined to be political heroes and are much in need of the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s 
solace. In regard to the problem of livelihood, since these three months are a

market for the hereafter, I felt perfectly easy at it and understood that being 
here inside until the Bayram 1 is a great bounty, for since all of you were sent 
to this prison in place of numerous other R i s a l e - i   N u r  students, and some of 
you in place of a thousand, they will help out in your business outside.

F i r s t l y :   I  offer  you  congratulations  with  all  my  heart  and  soul  for  the 

month of Rajab and the holy night of R a g h a ’ i b  tomorrow.

S e c o n d l y :  Don’t give up hope, and don’t worry or be alarmed. Allah will-
ing, divine grace will come to our aid. The bomb that was being prepared 
these  last  three  months  exploded.  The  news  given  by  my  stove,  Feyzi’s 
beaker, and Husrev’s two drinking-cups turned out to be true. But it was not 
terrible, it was slight. Allah willing, the ﬁre will be extinguished completely. 
All  their  assaults  are  to  discredit  my  person  and  taint  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s

the blow was reduced twentyfold. Allah willing, they will cause us not even

from each other and from the R i s a l e - i   N u r  will come to nothing. It is abso-

and Ministry of Home Affairs 1

All members of the government who witnessed the proclamation of the 
constitution, the First World War, the Armistice Period, the setting up of the 
nationalist government, and the republic know me well. Nevertheless, with 
your permission, we shall take a look at my life as though on a ﬁlm.

I was born in the village of Nurs in the province of Bitlis. As a student, I 
debated with the scholars I encountered, and through divine favour, defeat-
ing in scholarly debate all who opposed me, I came as far as Istanbul. In 
Istanbul, winning calamitous fame, a victim of my rivals’ trouble-making, I 
was dragged to the lunatic asylum on the orders of Sultan Abdülhamid. On 
the proclamation of the constitution, I attracted the attention of the govern-
ment of the Committee of Union and Progress with my activities during the 
Thirty-First of March Incident. I confronted them with the proposal to open 
an Islamic university in Van called the Medresetü’z-Zehra, resembling al-
Azhar University. I even laid its foundations. On the outbreak of the First 
War, I gathered together my students and took part in the War as the com-
mander of a militia force. I fought on the Caucasian Front and was taken 
prisoner  at  Bitlis.  I  escaped  from  where  I  was  being  held  and  returned  to 
Istanbul. I was appointed a member of the Darü’l-Hikmeti’l-İslâmiye. Dur-
ing  the  Armistice  period,  I  worked  against  the  occupying  forces  with  all 
my might, and on the victory of the national government, in appreciation I 
was summoned by it to Ankara, where I repeated my proposal to open the 
university in Van.

The life I had lived up to then had been that of a patriot. I had wanted 
to serve religion by means of politics. But from then on, I turned my back 
on  the  world  completely,  and  in  my  own  words,  buried  the  Old  Said.  As 
the  New  Said,  devoting  myself  entirely  to  the  hereafter,  I  withdrew  from 
the world. Retiring from social life, I went into seclusion on the hill Yuşa 
Tepesi in Istanbul. Later on I went to Bitlis and Van, in my native region, 
where I lived in a cave. I remained alone with the pleasures of my spirit and 
conscience. That is to say, taking as my principle

world. Passing my time studying the Qur’an of Mighty Stature I started to 
live as the New Said. But the manifestations of divine determining sent me 
as an exile to other places. Then, getting the people with me to write down 
the inspirations born in my heart from the effulgence of the Qur’an, a number 
of treatises came to be written. I gave them the name of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r . 
This name was born in my conscience, for truly they were based on the light 
of the Qur’an. I believe absolutely certainly that this was divine inspiration, 
and I said to those who were acting as scribes: “   B a r a k a l l a h !   ”  For it is not 
possible to begrudge others the light of belief.

Exchanging copies, these treatises of mine were written out by a number 
of believers. I formed the opinion that they were driven on by Allah in order 
to  strengthen  the  injured  belief  of  Muslims.  I  understood  that  just  as  no 
believer could obstruct this divine prompting, so I considered it a religious 
obligation to encourage it. Anyway these treatises, which now number one 
hundred and thirty, consist entirely of discussions of the hereafter and belief, 
and  contain  no  deliberate  mention  of  politics  or  this  world.  Nevertheless, 
they became the object of interest with a number of opportunists. Investiga-
tions were carried out into them, and I was arrested and sent to the prisons of 
Eskişehir, Kastamonu, and Denizli. Trials were held. As a result, truth was 
manifested and justice was executed, but those opportunists never wearied 
of hounding us. This time they arrested me and sent me to Afyon. I am under 
arrest and am being interrogated. They accuse me as follows:

1 ) You have founded a political society.
2 ) You publish ideas opposing the regime.
3 ) You harbour political aims.
The evidence for these are ten or ﬁfteen sentences in two or three of my 
treatises. Respected Minister! As Napoleon said: “ Bring me a straightfor-
ward sentence to which no second meaning can be attached, and I’ll have 
you executed for it! ” There is no sentence uttered by anyone which may not 
constitute an offence by having forced meanings attached to it. Especially 
the writings of someone like me who has reached seventy-ﬁve years of age, 
has withdrawn entirely from the life of this world, and has dedicated his life 
here to that of the hereafter – he will certainly write freely. Having nearly 
achieved  a  good  intention,  he  will  be  fearless.  It  is  unfair  to  study  them 
simply in order to seek out offences in them. It is nothing other than unjust.

THE RAYS

Not one of any of my one hundred and thirty treatises comprises any pur-
pose connected to the matters of this world. Proceeding from the light of the 
Qur’an, they are all to do with the hereafter and belief. In any event all the 
trials held up to now have come to the same conclusion and have resulted 
in  acquittals.  It  is  therefore  a  shame  to  busy  the  courts  unnecessarily  and 
take innocent believers away from their work and business in the name of 
the country and nation. While the Old Said spent all his life for the sake of 
the happiness of the country and nation, how could the New Said be preoc-
cupied with politics when he is seventy-ﬁve years old and has completely 
withdrawn from the world? This is your opinion too.

I have only one aim; it is this: at this time as I approach the grave, I hear 
the hooting of the bolshevik owls in this country, which is a Muslim land. 
The  sound  is  damaging  the  fundamentals  of  belief  of  the  Islamic  world. 
Making people lose their belief, it binds them, and particularly the youth, to 
itself. Struggling against it with all my strength, I am calling the youth and 
all  Muslims  to  believe.  I  am  struggling  against  these  unbelieving  masses. 
I want to enter the divine presence with this struggle of mine. This is all I 
do. As for those who prevent me from doing this, I am frightened that they 
are communists! For me it is a sacred aim to co-operate with the forces of 
religion  who  have  embraced  the  struggle  against  these  enemies  of  belief. 
Release me! Let me work to reform the youth, poisoned by communism, and 
for this country’s faith! Let me serve divine unity!

The  most  effective  remedy  for  the  ghastly  troubles  and  hopelessness 
of  the  world,  especially  at  this  time,  especially  those  smitten  by  disaster 
and the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students in particular, is to console and enhearten one 
another and strengthen one another’s morale, and like true, devoted brothers 
to pour balm on one another’s sorrows and afﬂictions and with true compas-
sion,  soothe  one  another’s  troubled  hearts.  The  true  brotherhood  between 
us which looks to the hereafter cannot sustain anyone feeling offended or 
taking  sides.  I  have  placed  all  my  trust  in  you  and  am  counting  on  you, 
and you know that I have decided to sacriﬁce happily not only my comfort,

self- respect, and honour for you, but also my very spirit, and indeed, you 
can see this. I swear even that the torment caused these last eight days by 
the triﬂing incident of two leading R i s a l e - i   N u r  students apparently avoid-
ing and upsetting each other instead of consoling each other, has caused my 
spirit, heart, and mind to weep and cry out: “ Alas! Alas! Mercy! Succour us 
O Most Merciful of the Merciful! Preserve us and save us from the evil of 
satans from among jinn and men. Fill my brothers’ hearts with loyalty, love, 
and fraternal feelings for each other! ”

My  brothers,  as  unyielding  as  steel!  You  help  me.  Our  situation  is 
extremely sensitive. I relied on you to such an extent that I handed over all 
my duties to your collective personality. So for your part, you should help 
me immediately. For sure, the incident was triﬂing, temporary, and unim-
portant, but even a hair, a mote, on the mainspring of our clock or the pupil 
of our eye causes pain. This point must be very important, for three physical 
explosions and three non- physical observations gave news of it exactly.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
My stove and the two drinking-cups of the Feyzi’s, Sabri, and Husrev 
disintegrating foretold a terrible calamity. It is absolutely essential that we 
practise true solidarity and disregard one another’s faults, our most power-
ful  point  of  support,  and  never  take  offence  at  a  hero  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  
like Husrev, since he takes my place and is an important representative of 
the Risale-i Nur’s collective personality. The last few days I felt a terrible 
distress and despair, and said to myself in alarm: “ Our enemies have found 
a way to defeat us. ” Both my stove and the absolutely correct observation 
I  made  in  my  imagination  gave  correct  news.  Beware!  Beware!  Beware! 
Quickly repair your solidarity, which up to now has been as strong as steel. 
There is a strong possibility this incident will cause more harm -especially 
at this juncture- to our service of the Qur’an and belief than our being sent 
to prison.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
The night of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) Ascension is the equivalent of a sec-
ond Night of Power. Working this night as much as one possibly can causes 
a thousandfold increase in spiritual gains. In accordance with the mystery of 
spiritual partnership, on this valuable night, Allah willing, like some angels 
who glorify Allah with forty thousand tongues, you will perform worship 
and supplications with forty thousand tongues. This will yield much reward 
in  this  place  of  tribulation,  and  you  will  be  offering  thanks  through  your 
worship  tonight  for  the  coming  storm  involving  us  being  reduced  a  thou-
sandfold. Together with congratulating you for your perfect caution and pru-

us most clearly.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
F i r s t l y :  I congratulate you with all my heart and soul on the Night of the 

Ascension.

S e c o n d l y :  It has been our claim for twenty years that as far as it is pos-
sible  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students  do  not  disturb  public  order.  As  a  divine 
favour,  and  as  a  wonder  resulting  from  your  loyalty  and  sincerity,  the 
harm of our imprisonment has been reduced a hundredfold. For there was 
a  strong  possibility  that  our  attackers  could  have  taken  it  as  a  sign  sup-
porting their main claim that we disturb public order and breach security 
and made it a pretext for refuting our case. The mountain was made into 
a  molehill.  Otherwise  those  who  make  mountains  out  of  molehills  con-
cerning us could have taken advantage of it and induced many people to 
believe their slanders against us.

T h i r d l y :  Do not worry about me. My being in the same building as you 
reduces all my difﬁculties and distress to nothing. In fact, our being gathered 
together here is important in numerous respects, and it is in many ways ben-
eﬁcial for our service of belief. Indeed, since a number of signiﬁcant facts 
in the supplement to my written objections have been sent to the six depart-
ments of government, and have come to their attention and inﬂuenced them 
to an extent, it has reduced all our troubles to nothing.

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

505

F o u r t h l y :  Busying oneself with the R i s a l e - i  N u r  both dispels distress, and 

may be counted as ﬁve sorts of worship.

F i f t h l y :   The  previous  misfortune  was  lessened  a  hundredfold  through 
the teachings of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r . Otherwise, because of the sensitivity of 
the time and place, that single molehill would have become mountains, like 
putting a match to gunpowder. In fact, some ofﬁcials said: “ Those prison-
ers who listen to the lessons of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  were not involved. ” If only 
everyone had listened to its teachings, nothing would have happened. As far 
as you can, don’t allow things to escalate; don’t let anything else be added 
to the difﬁculties of prison. Like the Nurjus, the other prisoners should be 
brothers and not be angry at each other.

My Dear, Loyal, Sincere Brothers!
It has become obligatory for us to practise as far as we can within the 
bounds of possibility the principles of the Tr e a t i s e   o n   S i n c e r i t y  and sincerity 
in its true sense among ourselves and towards one another. I have received 
certain information that for the past three months three men have been posted 
here to distance my select (   h â s   )  brothers from one another by playing on 
differences  in  ideas  or  temperament.  They  are  also  drawing  out  the  court 
proceedings in order to make the resolute Nurjus fed up and to shake them, 
and to make the sensitive and irresolute ones suspicious and cause them to 
give up their service of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . Beware! Beware! Don’t let the self-
sacriﬁcing brotherhood and genuine love you have maintained up to now be 
shaken. If they are shaken only a jot, it will cause us great harm. For only a 
small jolt in Denizli caused h o d j a s  like... to keep their distance. Our service 
of the Qur’an and belief necessitates that if necessary we sacriﬁce our very 
souls for one another; true devotees do not become vexed with one another 
because of difﬁculties or irritability arising from other things; with perfect 
humility, modesty, and resignation, they attribute the faults to themselves, 
and try to increase their love and sincerity. Otherwise it will be blown up 
out of all proportion, possibly causing irreparable harm. Leaving it to your 
perspicacity, I cut this short here.

THE RAYS

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
In consequence of an important warning I received, there are now one 
or  two  tasks  connected  with  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  to  try  with  all  your  might, 
through the lessons of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , not to fall into dispute or take up 
biased sides among the other unfortunate prisoners in this third School of 
Joseph.  For  there  are  terrible  troublemakers  who  are  concealed  and  are 
attempting to take advantage of differences, grudges, hatred, and obstinacy. 
Since if necessary the majority of our fellow-prisoners manifest a vein of 
heroism which makes them ready to sacriﬁce their lives for their country, 
nation, and friends, surely those brave men should sacriﬁce their obstinacy, 
hatred, and enmity, which are entirely without beneﬁt and extremely dam-
aging in these stormy times for the good of the nation and peace and quiet 
here in prison. For in this way they may be saved from the corruption of 
those who are covertly inculcating communism, which turns into anarchy. 
It may otherwise lead to signiﬁcant difﬁculties and upsets at this time, like 
putting a match to gunpowder, both for a hundred wretched prisoners, and 
for the innocent Risale-i Nur students, and for the town of Afyon. It might 
also lead to the intervention of a secret society which is here but whose roots 
are abroad. Since divine determining sent us here for their sake, and because 
of their happiness and ease of mind some of us do not want to leave and we 
sacriﬁce our comfort for them and endure every hardship patiently, certainly 
it is absolutely essential that for the sake of those new brothers of ours, we 
do not become angry with one another and make peace like brothers, like the 
Denizli prisoners, and out of respect for the months of Sha‘ban and Ram-
adan. In any case, we and I consider them to be within the circle of Risale-i 
Nur students and include them in our prayers.

such as that in order to attract everyone’s attention to its truths. For in its 
glittering  fashion,  beyond  all  our  hopes  and  precautions  and  our  conceal-
ing it, and our enemies belittling it, and outside our wills, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
teaches its truths openly to friend and foe alike. It unhesitatingly divulges its 
most private secrets to the most distant stranger. Since the truth is this, we 
should consider our triﬂing difﬁculties to be a bitter medicine like quinine, 
and offering thanks in patience, say: “ This too will pass, Allah willing. ”

S e c o n d l y :  I wrote this to the supervisor of this School of Joseph: just as 
when I was a prisoner-of- war in Russia, the Bolshevik storm ﬁrst erupted 
in the prisons, so the French Revolution ﬁrst began in the prisons and with 
the  prisoners  known  in  the  histories  as  “ vagabonds. ”  Because  of  this,  in 
both Eskişehir and Denizli we Risale-i Nur students tried to reform the other 
prisoners as far as we possibly could. In both prisons it was extremely suc-
cessful. Here it will be even more useful, for as a result of the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s 
instuction at this sensitive time, the squall  1 that blew up was only a hun-
dredth of what it would have been. Otherwise the harmful outside currents 
which take advantage of conﬂict and such incidents and await such opportu-
nities, would have ignited the gunpowder and caused a conﬂagration.

Due to some physical and spiritual tribulation, my evil-commanding soul 
was feeling sad on your account when this was imparted to me: if you had 
suffered these difﬁculties ten times over in order to meet with all your broth-

that like in former times the people of reality used to gather together and 
meet at least once or twice a year, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students gather together 
every few years in the School of Joseph. In keeping with the Allah-fearing 
and  ascetic  way  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  and  its  teaching  those  most  in  need,

Trusting in you with all my strength, I was expecting to enter the grave

was certain that nothing at all could part you from each other. Now there 
is an ofﬁcial communication concerning ghastly plans to create differences 
between  the  leading  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students.  Since,  as  necessitated  by  the 
strength of your loyalty and your intense concern for the R i s a l e - i   N u r , you 
are ready to sacriﬁce your lives for one another if necessary, certainly you 
are  bound  to  sacriﬁce  your  extremely  trivial,  temporary,  and  unimportant 
feelings. It will otherwise cause untold harm at this juncture, and I tremble 
at the possibility of anyone leaving the R i s a l e - i   N u r  circle. For the last three 
days I have again been shaken by distress such as I have never before expe-
rienced. I have now understood certainly that petulance as slight as a hair on 
the eye on the part of those like yourselves has the effect of a bombshell on 
our lives with the R i s a l e - i   N u r . I’ll tell you this even, much effort was made 
during that storm [ revolt ] to connect us with it. Now they are trying to dis-
tance you from one another. Although I have suffered ten times more than 
you for your sake, I have decided not to see the faults of any of you. I ask of 
you in the name of our master, the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s collective personality, not 
to insist on your own way, whether justiﬁed or not. If in that extraordinary 
place hidden ﬁngers are stirring things up with your being together, one of

are  somewhat  unsociable  and  reserved.  They  also  differ  from  each  other

his  relatives  and  manner  of  his  livelihood,  and  is  obliged  to  be  cautious.

Due to these differences of ways and temperaments, the three of you have

For only slight opposition at present causes much harm.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers and Fellow-Students in this School of Joseph!
The holy Night of Acquittal (   B e r a ’ a t   ) , tonight, is like a sacred seed of the 
whole year and the programme of human destiny, and is therefore as holy as 
the Night of Power. Just as all good works on the Night of Power yield thirty 
thousand merits, so on this Night of Acquittal the merits of such acts and for 
each letter of the Qur’an rise to twenty thousand. If at other times such mer-
its are ten, during the three months [ of Rajab, Sha‘ban, and Ramadan ] they 
rise to a hundred or a thousand. Then on the well-known holy nights, they 
rise to tens of thousands or twenty or thirty thousand. These nights may be 
the equivalent of ﬁfty years of worship. It is highly proﬁtable to be occupied 
as far as one can with the Qur’an, seeking divine forgiveness, and uttering 
prayers for the Prophet ( UWBP ).

caliphate will continue for the lengthy period of ﬁve hundred years, then 
it will be wiped out by one of the three antichrists, known as Jenghiz and 
Hulagu, then he will treacherously rule within Islam. That is, as is indi-
cated by numerous Hadiths, there is clear evidence that three Antichrists

minor things related to the Qur’an and marks of Islam, should not have fore-
told the extraordinary events of our times? And is it at all possible that there

[ One ﬁne point about this verse ]

My Dear Brother Re’fet Bey, Commander of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and Serv-

ant of the Qur’an!

The Jewish nation has always been excessive in its love of life and this 
world, and has therefore deserved the blows of abasement and misery it has 
received every century. However, in the Palestine question it is not love of 
life  and  this  world,  but  a  signiﬁcant  sort  of  national  and  religious  feeling 
because Palestine is where the prophets of the Children of Israel are bur-
ied,  and  the  prophets  belonged  to  their  nation.  In  consequence  they  have 
received no swift blows. A small group could never otherwise have held out 
in the midst of the vast Arab lands; it would quickly have been humiliated.

Q u e s t i o n :   Is  there  any  verse  stating  that  the  earth  is  round,  and  if  so, 
which sura is it in? I am hesitant as to whether it is ﬂat or round. All coun-
tries are situated in lands surrounded by sea. What is there to keep in the 
outer edges of these seas? I request that you provide an explanation, and I 
kiss your hands.

E m i r d a ğ l ı   A l i   H o c a

The R i s a l e - i   N u r  has solved questions of this sort. The Islamic scholars 
have accepted that the earth is round, and this in no way contradicts religion. 
The word “   s a ṭ h   ”  in the verse 1 does not indicate that the earth is not round. 
It has been laid down by the learned authorities that to be turned towards the 
q i b l a   (   i s t i k b a l - i   k ı b l e   )  while performing the prayers is obligatory, and this 
is applicable to every part of the prayers, including the bowing and prostrat-
ing. Since according to the Shari‘a, there is a luminous line from the Ka‘ba 
upwards as far as the divine throne, and downwards to the ground, perform-
ing all the actions of the prayers in the direction of the q i b l a  is possible with 
the earth being round.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
I congratulate you with all my heart and soul on the blessed month of 
Ramadan. May Almighty Allah make the Night of Power the equivalent of 
a thousand months for all of you, and accept it as an eighty-year lifetime of 
worship. Amen.

S e c o n d l y :   I  am  of  the  opinion  that  there  are  numerous  beneﬁts  and 
instances  of  good  in  our  remaining  here  until  the  Festival.  If  we  were  to 
be  released  now,  we  would  both  lose  out  on  all  the  good  of  this  School 
of  Joseph,  and  spoil  Ramadan,  which  looks  purely  to  the  hereafter,  and 
taint  our  spiritual  states  with  worldly  activities.  In  accordance  with 
ّ(cid:195)ا ُهَراَ(cid:99)ْ(cid:114)ا ا َ(cid:175)ـ(cid:193)ِ(cid:158) ُرْ(cid:193)َ(cid:115)ْ(cid:170)َا we shall ﬁnd great joy in this, Allah willing.

You  have  also  understood  in  the  court  that  since  they  can  in  no  way 
convict us with their laws, they discuss triﬂing things of no importance like 
some petty matters in some petty letters which have less connection with the 
law than a ﬂy’s wing. For they have found no way to attack the signiﬁcant, 
universal  matters  of  the  Risale-i  Nur.  Also  their  slandering  my  person  so 
as  to  deprive  it  of  importance  instead  of  the  widespread,  general  Risale-i 
Nur and its students is very advantageous for us; divine determining does 
not allow them to interfere with the Risale-i Nur and its students, and pre-
occupies them with myself. So I say to you and to all my friends: for the 
well-being of yourselves and the Risale-i Nur, I accept wholeheartedly, even 
with my evil-commanding soul’s agreement, and with joy and gratitude, all 
the difﬁculties inﬂicted on my person. Neither is Paradise cheap, nor is Hell 
unnecessary. The world and its tribulations are transitory and ﬂeeting. Also, 
since we shall be avenged a hundred times over at the Last Judgement, and 
in part in this world, for the ill-treatment we receive at the hands of our cov-
ert enemies, we should feel sorry for them rather than angry.

Since the reality is this, it is truly good fortune to submit without alarm, 
and with caution, and perfect patience and thanks, to whatever divine deter-
mining has decreed for us and to trust in divine grace, which protects us, 
and with truly sincere, consoling, and heartfelt friendliness and love for our

human social life, and especially the School of Joseph, resembles a garden. 
It contains both ugly and beautiful things, and distressing and happy things.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
F i r s t l y :  There is a strong possibility that tomorrow night is the Night of 
Power.  Some  of  the  scholarly  authorities  stated  it  is  tomorrow.  Even  if  it 
is not in fact, since the Umma consider it to be so, Allah willing it will be 
accepted as such.

S e c o n d l y :  I am anxious about the comfort of our brothers in Ward Six, 
where there was a disturbance. There is a ﬁnger from outside which stirs up 
the prison, and particularly Ward Six. Our brothers there should be careful 
and cautious, and not get mixed up in anything.

T h i r d l y :   Have  you  sent  the  piece  to  the  lawyer,  to  have  it  read  to  the 
chairman of the court? Also, because it is the same matter, Halil Hilmi is not 
only Sabri’s lawyer, but everyone’s. That is how I look on him. He should 
now assist our ﬁrst lawyer on account of all of us.

F o u r t h l y :  I gave Taşköprülü Sadık Bey’s introduction to Sabri to write 
out. If it has already been written out, the part that has been corrected should 
be sent to him. A newly written-out copy should be sent to me. I have a copy 
of Sadık’s short poem here. If you do not have a copy, I shall send it to you.

should know this and you should tell them.

without  reason  and  our  acting  with  complete  caution  and  self-restraint 
in  consequence,  the  force  of  that  squall  was  reduced  a  hundredfold  and

with perfect self- composure, patience, and caution. It was imparted to me

I congratulate you with all my heart at your quickly healing that wound 
of ours. I felt completely easy last night as a result. In fact, the Medresetü’z-
Zehra is expanding, and the true sincerity, self- sacriﬁce and abandoning of 
egotism, and complete humility of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  circle are being adopted 
and  are  spreading.  Certainly,  very  petty  and  temporary  sensitivity,  irrita-
bility, and petulance cannot spoil its powerful teachings and the bonds of 
brotherhood. The Tr e a t i s e   o n   S i n c e r i t y  is the best advice on this point. Their 
worst strategy now in striking at us and the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and agitating us, is 
to make the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students look coldly on each other by playing on 
differences in their ideas and temperaments, and to separate them from each 
other. For sure, it was only a minor tiff, but only a hair on the eye causes as 
much pain as a stone, so my ﬂask gave news of it as though it were a major 
incident. The late Hafız Ali (May Allah be pleased with him) complaining 
shortly  before  his  death  about  a  similar  very  minor  situation  has  come  to 
mind perhaps a hundred times, and saddened me.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
I gave the students’ written objections to the prison governor. I told him: 
“ We want to send this, together with the end part of my written objections, 
to the Directorate of Religious Affairs and Ankara Criminal Court, which 
acquitted us and our treatises, and if it’s appropriate, to send too the list of 
errors and corrections, but privately and just for the information. ” He said: 

1.  Yesterday I felt happy and joyful. Then I realized that my brother in Nurs had eight 
months previously sent some Nurs honey in a ﬂask to me in Emirdağ. Yesterday it arrived 
here from Emirdağ. I told them to quickly bring it to me. I waited, but it was not brought. 
My happiness suddenly turned into anger. It was the cause of that ﬂask with the honey, 
which  in  my  eyes  was  a  hundred  times  more  precious  than  the  ﬂask,  being  given  to  a 
stranger and sent to the market, and then the ﬂask suddenly broke. I have sent an amount 
of that sweet honey, a gift from the village of Nurs, my birthplace, so that all my brothers 
may have a taste of it as a Festival sweet.

“ It is appropriate. ” Now you may ask the lawyer to prepare several copies 
of the students’ written objections and two copies of the list.

Also,  write  to  the  Directorate  of  Religious  Affairs  and  say:  since  you 
wrote perfectly correctly in the report about Said and his friends you sent 
to Afyon this time that it is your duty to defend scholars of religion, both 
the oppressed Said and his innocent companions are extremely grateful to 
your department. Anyway, our case is related to religion and learning, so 
the Department of Religious Affairs should be concerned with it before the 
police, judiciary, or any other department. For this reason, both in Denizli 
and Afyon, we applied ﬁrstly to your department, sending our complaints to 
the scholars there. Write a paragraph expressing this meaning.

My Dear, Loyal Brother, Re’fet Bey!
Out of respect for the Qur’an of Mighty Stature, and for the sake of your 
relations with the Qur’an, and in honour of your twenty years of service to 
belief through the R i s a l e - i   N u r , quickly put an end to this apparently small, 
but, because of the sensitivity of our situation, terrible and grievous quarrel 
between you. For it greatly assists the covert dissemblers who are trying to 
destroy us, and is like putting a match to gunpowder. There is otherwise a 
strong possibility that because of an ounce of personal rights tons of harm 
will come to us and our service of the Qur’an and belief. I swear that if one 
of you were to insult me most terribly and entirely trample my honour but 
not give up serving the Qur’an, belief, and the R i s a l e - i   N u r , I would forgive 
him and make peace with him and try not to be offended. You know that 
our enemies try to take advantage of the slightest unmannerliness, so make 
it  up  quickly.  Stop  being  petulant,  which  is  meaningless  and  so  harmful. 
Otherwise,  like  Şemsi,  Şeﬁk,  and  Tevﬁk,  some  of  us  will  apparently  join 
those who oppose us, causing great harm and deﬁciency to our service of 
belief. Up to now divine favour has made up for any losses by bestowing 
numerous others who work on the same system. Allah willing, it will again 
come to our aid.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
F i r s t l y :  This report has had exactly the same result as the one in Denizli. 
They  have  exonerated  us  on  the  points  on  which  we  have  been  charged, 
but in order to ingratiate themselves with them and show that they are not 
Nurjus, and due to a vein of Wahhabism, they have attacked us with a few 
scholarly criticisms. I reckon this report arrived before the indictment was 
written, for the indictment includes some points from it. In which case our 
list of errors and corrections answers them completely. What do you think 
of this? Also, what are my new replies like? Are they apt? I wrote them very 
hastily when in a wretched state.

S e c o n d l y :  Up to now they were apparently preoccupied with our persons, 
and the questions of a political society, a Suﬁ order, and a few unimportant 
private letters. But now, with seizing T h e  I l l u m i n a t i n g  L a m p  (   S i r a c ü ’ n - N û r   )  
and T h e   S i x  A t t a c k s   (   H ü c u m a t - ı   S i t t e   ) , and the experts’ committee directing 
attention to the R i s a l e - i  N u r , and the machinations of our covert enemies, the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  has been attacked in a sort of way, which is a means of ensur-
ing tranquillity in this country. So as with many times previously, at exactly 
the  same  time  as  the  country  was  being  attacked  in  this  way,  two  severe 
earthquakes  occurred,  just  as  I  was  writing  that  discussion.  This  afﬁrmed 
me, saying: “ There is no need to write it. ” So I did not write any more. Then 
today I heard that there is fear of war. So I said to the person in charge here: 
“ Whenever  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   is  attacked,  the  earth  either  becomes  angry, 
or there is fear of war. We have experienced numerous such events so that 
no possibility of chance remained, and these have been pointed out to the 
courts. ” That is to say, my terrible anxiety about the R i s a l e - i   N u r  recently, 
and the jealous criticisms of the experts’ committee, and the conﬁscation of

an important part of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , although I did not realize it coincided 
with  T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p   – which  is  like  acceptable  almsgiving  and  a 
means of repelling disaster – disappearing behind the veil of concealment, 
the earthquake, and fear of the outbreak of war.

Do  not  worry,  we  are  under  divine  protection.  There  are  numerous

Don’t  be  upset  at  remaining  here  a  little  longer  and  their  wanting  to 
extend our case somewhat. On the contrary, be pleased, like me. For since 
life never stops and rushes to extinction, in places of tribulation such as this 
it becomes eternal through the fruits its yields for the hereafter. Moreover, 
the circle the R i s a l e - i   N u r  teaches is expanding. For example, the scholars 
of the experts’ committee are being obliged to study T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p  
with  close  attention.  Also,  it  is  possible  that  if  we  were  released  now,  it 
would cause deﬁciencies in our work for the cause of belief in one or two 
respects. Although the distress I suffer far exceeds yours, I do not want to be 
released. So as far as you can, try to endure it patiently and become accus-
tomed to this sort of life, and to ﬁnd solace and ease of mind by writing out 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and reading it.

explain a fact, since some inattentive people do not know the full meaning 
of this. The fact is this:

There are two sorts of Qur’anic commentaries:
T h e   ﬁ r s t  is the well-known sort of commentary. Commentaries of this 
sort expound and elucidate the Qur’an’s phraseology, words, and sentences.
T h e   s e c o n d   s o r t  explain, prove, and elucidate with powerful arguments 
the Qur’an’s truths related to belief. This sort has great importance. Some-
times the well-known, literalist  (   z â h i r   )  commentaries include this sort in 
summary fashion. But the R i s a l e - i   N u r  has made it its basis directly and is 
a commentary on the Qur’an’s meanings which silences obstinate philoso-
phers in unprecedented manner.

Is it us and the R i s a l e - i   N u r  who are the most harmful things around so 
that all other writers are free to write and all classes of people are free to 
meet  together?  But  without  religious  education,  Muslims  cannot  be  gov-
erned except by means of absolute despotism and absolute bribery. For just 
as  up  to  the  present  no  Muslim  has  ever  become  a  true  Christian  or  Jew, 
they rather become irreligious and completely corrupted; so a Muslim can-
not become a communist; he turns into an anarchist and can be governed by 
nothing other than absolute despotism. We R i s a l e - i   N u r  students are work-
ing both for government, and public order, and the happiness of the country 
and nation. Those opposed to us are irreligious anarchists and enemies of the 
country and nation. It is essential that the government should not interfere 
with us, but protect and assist us.

F i r s t l y :  Their releasing publishers of the R i s a l e - i  N u r  like Re’fet, Edhem, 
the Çalışkans, and Burhan shows that it is not forbidden to disseminate the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r   and  the  court  does  not  intervene.  It  is  also  a  sign  that  it  has 
decided that there is no political society. Also, since in prolonging our case 
it has attracted widespread attention to the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  and is like a gen-
eral invitation to read it and an ofﬁcial advertisement and it has excited the 
desire of the needy to study it, it has led to beneﬁts for us and the believers 
far surpassing our tribulations and losses. It is a sign, Allah willing, that this 
sacred instruction will have the effect of an atom bomb against the aggres-
sive troops of misguidance, who are on the assault at this time throughout 
the earth in truly widespread and terrible fashion.

My Dear Brothers Re’fet, Mehmed Feyzi, Sabri!
I received a severe warning and sign, and earnestly request of you for the 
sake of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and out of respect for this Festival and for the sake 
of our old rights that you try to heal this awesome new wound of ours. For 
our covert enemies are following two plans: one is to destroy my character 
with insulting treatment, and the second is to make us feel coldly towards 
each other. To criticize, object to, and be offended at chieﬂy Husrev is to 
cause division amongst us. I tell you that if Husrev had a thousand faults, I 
would still be chary of opposing him. For to oppose him now is to directly 
oppose the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  and myself and to support those who have ruined 
us.  It  is  a  terrible  betrayal  so  that  an  extraordinary  thing  happened  to  me 
for no reason: my stove disintegrated! I am also of the opinion that the last 
torments to have been inﬂicted on me resulted from your meaningless and 
very harmful lack of solidarity. A fearful ﬁnger is stirring things up here, 
especially in Ward Six. Don’t make me weep this Festival. Quickly make 
heartfelt peace!

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
I wanted only two or three of our brothers to be released today. But the 
divine favour that looks to us left them behind here for their own good. It 
is  absolutely  essential  that  our  present  situation  is  maintained  for  around 
three weeks. For our being together for this Festival is necessary both for 
us, and the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and for our work, and for our physical and spiritual 
comfort, and so that we can receive a full share of the Hajjis’ prayers, and 
to save the treatises that have been sent to Ankara from being conﬁscated, 
and so that those who pity us in our plight and embrace the R i s a l e - i   N u r  may 
increase in number, and it can be a proof that we did not have recourse to 
the traitors to the country, nation, and religion by consenting to the serious  
errors of the present.

Because, due to a vein of Wahhabism, the experts’ committee was unable 
to endure Imam ‘Ali’s (May Allah be pleased with him) earnest interest in 
and appreciation of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and was inﬂuenced by the groundless 
suspicions that last year caused Zamzam water to be poured away and this 
year prevented people going to make the Hajj, it directed its unfair, incor-
rect, and unjustiﬁable jealous criticisms at the Fifth Ray. At this time of sus-
picion and alarm, the safest place for us is prison. Allah willing, the treatises 
of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  will win the freedom of both us and themselves. Since 
under these harsh conditions in the face of so many opponents they are mak-
ing  themselves  read  in  unprecedented  fashion,  and  making  their  students 
work in prison in various ways, and through divine favour not allowing them 
to be ruined; we are bound to be content with this much and to offer thanks 
instead of complaining. It is because of this contentment that I am able to 
endure all my severe distress. I do not interfere in Allah’s concerns.

While reading J a l j a l u t i y y a  now, it was imparted to me the moment this

the start of that sura, ( 68:1 )  ] \ [Z Y  that it is the word Y that is 
the origin, basis, pre-eternal source, and eternal master of all pens, writing, 
and books, and indicates the pen of divine determining, and light, and the 
light of pre-eternal knowledge. That is, just as ( 51:1 )  μ looks to the 
Tr e a t i s e   O n   M i n u t e   P a r t i c l e s  with a powerful relation inferring an indica-
tion, so does the word Y look to the “   Tr e a t i s e   o n   D i v i n e   D e t e r m i n i n g   ”  
with a powerful indication.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
An  important  and  meaningful  question  was  asked  by  someone  impor-
tant. He asked me: “You are not a political society and three courts of law 
have acquitted you on that point, and this has also been established because 
the  six  provinces  that  have  kept  you  under  surveillance  for  twenty  years 
have not made any accusations in connection with it. Nevertheless, there is 
a wondrous attachment between the Nurjus that is not found in any political 
society or group. We would like to have this difﬁculty solved for us. ”

In reply I said this: “ That is true, the Nurjus are not a political society 
of any sort or a group organized for any political, worldly, negative, per-
sonal, or communal interests, and they could not be thus. They are the sons 
and daughters and grandchildren of the old heroes of this land, the millions 
of  Islamic  devotees  who  with  perfect  joy  sacriﬁced  their  lives  to  win  the 
rank of martyrdom. They have inherited their vein of self-sacriﬁce so that 
they  display  this  wondrous  attachment,  and  in  Denizli  Court  caused  this 
impotent, wretched brother of theirs to declare on their account: “ Let our 
heads be sacriﬁced for a truth for which millions of heroic heads have been 
sacriﬁced! ”  He  said  this  in  their  name,  leaving  the  court  in  astonishment 
and appreciative silence. That is to say, among the Nurjus are true, sincere, 
positive devotees who act solely for Allah’s pleasure and the hereafter, so 
that  the  fearsome  secret  societies  of  the  Masons,  communists,  corrupters, 
atheists, godless, and Tashnaks have found no means to oppose them, and so 
want to ruin and scatter them through ﬂexible laws by deceiving the govern-
ment and judiciary. Allah willing, they can do nothing, only be the reason 
for the devotees of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and of the faith increasing in number. ”

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
I  am  going  to  relate  to  you  a  question  and  answer  of  forty  years  ago 
which resembles that of yesterday. In those days of long ago, the Old Said’s 
students’ passionate attachment to their Master was such they would sacri-
ﬁce their very lives for him, so he was able to halt the Armenian Tashnak 
revolutionaries around Van and Bitlis, where they were very active, and 
was able to curb them to a degree. He found Mauser riﬂes for his students 

526

THE RAYS

and for a while his medrese was like a barracks with guns and books side 
by side. Then a General from the army came and saw them and said: “This 
isn’t a  m e d r e s e , it’s a barracks.” Because of the Bitlis Incident he became 
suspicious, and ordered that they collect up our riﬂes. A month or two later, 
the Great War broke out and I reclaimed my riﬂes. Anyway.

They asked me in connection the above: “ The Armenian revolutionar-
ies,  among  whom  are  fervent  devotees  ready  to  sacriﬁce  their  lives,  are 
frightened of you, so that when you climb the mountain Erek Dağı near 
Van, they withdraw and go elsewhere. What force do you have that makes 
them do that? ”

In  reply  I  told  them:  “ The  Armenian  devotees  display  this  wondrous 
self-sacriﬁce for the ﬂeeting life of this world and the temporary interests 
of triﬂing, negative nationalism, and attack us, so surely the students, who 
strive for everlasting life and the positive interests of vast, sacred Islamic 
nationhood and believe that the appointed hour cannot be changed, will not 
lag behind those devotees.  1 If necessary, they unhesitatingly and proudly 
sacriﬁce the certain appointed hour and few years of illusory outward life for 
millions of years of true life and the well-being and interests of thousands of 
millions of their fellow believers. ”

My Dear, Loyal, Faithful, Kindly Brothers!
For  two  days  I  have  felt  an  aching  in  my  head  and  nerves  from  ’ﬂu. 
Although  I  needed  the  consolation  and  companionship  in  such  circum-
stances  of  meeting  with  friends,  I  was  constricted  by  a  terrible  loneliness 
and isolation. Complaints like the following occurred to me: “Why do we 
suffer this torment? How does it beneﬁt our work? ”

Then this morning the following was imparted to me: for us to be set this 
rigorous examination, and to be struck on the touchstone numerous times to 
see clearly whether we are gold or brass, and to be tried unfairly in every 
respect, and to be passed through ever ﬁner sieves three or four times to see 
whether our evil-commanding souls take a share or are playing any tricks, 
is extremely necessary for our service, which should be purely and solely 
in the name of truth and reality, so that divine determining and dominical 

1.  Impotently, I say in the name of my brothers: if necessary, we shall overtake them 
and advance far beyond them, Allah willing. We shall show that we are the heirs of our 
forefathers both in religion, and in heroism.

grace  permit  it.  For  by  being  exhibited  in  this  ﬁeld  of  trial  and  examina-
tion  confronted  by  obdurate,  unjust  enemies  and  their  pretexts,  everyone 
has understood that there is no trickery, no egotism, no malice, no worldly 
or personal interests, nor interests that look to the hereafter, mixed in with 
our service, and that it is completely sincere and proceeds from truth and 
reality.  If  it  had  remained  concealed,  it  could  have  been  given  numerous 
meanings. The mass of believers would not have had conﬁdence in it. They 
would have said: “ Perhaps they are deceiving us, ” and the elite too would 
have had their suspicions. Thinking that “ perhaps they are acting the same 
as some of those people who sell themselves to acquire spiritual rank for 
themselves and to win conﬁdence, ” they would not feel completely certain 
about it. Now, following the examination, even the most stubborn and obdu-
rate person is compelled to submit. If your hardship is one, your proﬁts are 
a thousandfold. Allah willing.

Just when with their stringent prohibitions they were trying to scare peo-
ple everywhere away from me, the advertisement in the newspaper about 
the incident when I was a prisoner-of-war has increased their interest. Yes-
terday, three ofﬁcials who are in favour of insulting my person said in the 
prison yard: “ The people gather when Said appears at the window, and they 
look at him. He must not stand at the window or we’ll change his ward. ” The 
chief warder said this. But don’t you worry at all. I have decided to endure 
all difﬁculties. Allah willing, through the blessings of your prayers, the dis-
tress will turn into joy.

Essentially, the incident is true, but because I had no witnesses I never 
described it in detail. I did not realize that a squad had come to execute me; I 
understood later. I did not know that the Russian commander then said some 
things in Russian by way of apology. That is to say, the Muslim major who 
was  present  and  who  reported  the  incident  to  the  newspaper  understood; 
apparently the commander said several times: “ Forgive me! ”

My brothers! When I am busy with the R i s a l e - i   N u r , the distress dimin-
ishes. That means, our duty is to be occupied with its treatises and to give no 
importance to passing things, and to offer thanks in patience.

An Astonishing Trait in Bediuzzaman’s Character

[ This  appeared  in  the  15th  Teşrin-i  Evvel,  1948  number  of  the 
magazine E h l - i   S ü n n e t . It was written by the magazine’s owner, 
who is a lawyer. ]

Bediuzzaman was taken prisoner the same day that I was wounded and 
captured in Bitlis during the First World War. He was sent to Siberia, to one 
of the big prisoner-of-war camps. I was on the island of Nangün near Baku. 
One day, Nicola Nicolayavich visited the camp in order to inspect the pris-
oners. While passing in front of Bediuzzaman, Bediuzzaman ignored him, 
not so much as stirring a ﬁnger. This attracted the the commander-in-chief’s 
attention. On some pretext, he passed by a second time, and again Bediuzza-
man did not stir. He passed by a third time, and stopped, then the following 
exchange ensued:

“ Do you know who I am? ”
“ Yes, I know. You are Nicola Nicolayavich, the Czar’s uncle and com-

mander-in-chief of the Caucasian Front. ”

“ So why do you insult me? ”
“ Forgive me, but I have not insulted you. I am merely doing what my 

beliefs demand. ”

“ What do your beliefs demand? ”
“ I am a Muslim scholar. I have belief in my heart. Someone with belief in 
his heart is superior to one without belief. If I had risen to my feet, I would 
have been disrespectful to my beliefs. I did not stand up for that reason. ”

“ In that case, by saying that I am without belief, you are insulting both 
my person, and the army to which I belong, and my nation, and the Czar. A 
military court will be set up at once and you will be interrogated. ”

On  this  command,  a  military  court  was  set  up.  The  Turkish,  German, 
and Austrian ofﬁcers in the headquarters all pleaded with Bediuzzaman to 
apologize to the commander-in-chief. He replied like this:

“ I want to travel to the realm of the hereafter, to the presence of Allah’s 
Messenger ( UWBP ), and I have to have a passport. I can’t act contrarily to 
my beliefs. ”

No one could open their mouths in the face of this and awaited the results. 
The interrogation ceased, and they passed a sentence of execution for insult-
ing the Russian Czar and army. Bediuzzaman said cheerfully to the ofﬁcer 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

529

leading  the  squad  that  came  to  carry  out  the  sentence:  “ Allow  me ﬁfteen 
minutes to perform my duties. ” He took the ablutions, then while perform-
ing two r a k ‘ a t s  of prayers, Nicola Nicolayavich appeared. He said:

“ Forgive me! I supposed you acted as you did to insult me, so I had you 
tried according to the law. But now I realize that you were merely acting 
out of your beliefs and were carrying out what they enjoin. The judgement 
is quashed. You are worthy of respect for the ﬁrmness of your belief. I dis-
turbed you; again, forgive me. ”

A  major,  one  of  Bediuzzaman’s  companions,  described  this  high  trait 
of his character and ﬁrmness of religion, which is a worthy example for all 
Muslims, as he himself witnessed it. When I heard it, involuntarily my eyes 
ﬁlled with tears.

I have no appetite, and because gifts upset me I have sent you my share, 
which consists of three portions of butter, a basket of grapes, a bag of apples, 
two packets of tea, and sugar. I was going to give them to you as a gift, but 
I asked, and they said you have some too. With the money from them I am 
going to buy things like yoghurt, eggs, and bread, so the Medresetü’z-Zehra 
is not displeased at me, saying that I did not eat the gifts. Sell them to the 
needy, cheaply, and to the deserving, so that the gifts of the Medresetü’z-

certainly no punishment other than Hell could purify them. The penalty for

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
F i r s t l y :  It has been imparted to me that I should describe the astonishing 
and instructive treatment I have received during my two periods of captivity. 
As follows:

I was in a ward in Kosturma in Russia together with ninety other ofﬁc-
ers who were being held as prisoners-of-war. I used to give them religious 
instruction from time to time. One day the Russian commander came and 
he saw this, and said: “ This Kurd was made a militia commander and he 
slaughtered many of our men. Now he’s giving political instruction here. I 
am forbidding this. He must not do this. ” Two days later he again came, and 
this time permitted it, saying: “ Since what you are teaching is not political, 
but religious and moral, you may continue. ”

During my second captivity, here in this prison, the court ofﬁcials for-
bade one of my close brothers to come to me, although he has listened to 
my reading from the R i s a l e - i   N u r  for twenty years and himself reads better 
than I do. Neither did they permit those who attend to my essential needs 
to come, lest they received instruction from me. However, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
leaves no need for other teaching, and we have no other teachings and we 
have no secrets that have not been divulged. Anyway, certain circumstances 
have made me cut a long story short.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
Two or three times I have been afﬂicted with a signﬁcant state of mind. 
Thirty  years  ago  it  made  me  leave  Istanbul’s  glittering  social  life  while  I 
was in the Darü’l-Hikmeti’l-İslâmiye and took me up the high hill known as 
Yûsha Tepesi, where it did not even permit me to have the late Abdurrah-
man, who was in Istanbul and was the ﬁrst student and hero of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r , with me to attend to my needs. Now the ﬁrst stages of a state of mind 
similar to that revolution of the spirit, which showed up the nature of the 
New Said, have begun in me. I reckon it is a sign a Third Said will appear, 
who will abandon the world altogether. That means, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its 
heroic students will perform my duties, and no need remains for me. Any-
way, all the comprehensive parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and all its unshakeable, 
sincere students give instruction far better than me.

F i r s t l y :  I have surmised from a number of signs that of the collections that 
have been published, it is the G u i d e   F o r   Yo u t h  that they give most impor-
tance to. I reckon that T h e  A i r :  A   Wi n d o w   o n t o   D i v i n e   U n i t y   (   H ü v e   N ü k t e s i   )  
has broken the backs of our covert atheist enemies, and smashed the idol of 
nature, their foundation and support. For although it is to an extent possible 
to hide that idol in the dense earth, it is impossible to do so in the transparent 
air. As a result, because of their obdurate disbelief and apostasizing obsti-
nacy, they are deceiving the judiciary and inciting it against us. Allah will-
ing, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  will induce the members of the judiciary to look on us 
favourably, and will make this attack come to nothing too.

S e c o n d l y :  Now, both the E h l - i   S ü n n e t  magazine, and the newspaper here, 
and Zübeyir’s ﬁery reply, and their preoccupation with the R i s a l e - i  N u r  have

I saw that there were people listening to you on both sides. It continued half 
an hour. I was worried and said to myself: it is possible that among those 
listening is a spy who will make a mountain out of a molehill and give the 
wrong meanings. He may be listening carefully, but because of their lack 
of caution and enjoyment, the brothers who are chatting are not looking at 
them or being careful. I sent this as an answer. Thanks be to Allah, I knew 
that nothing harmful had been said, but we have to be cautious at this sensi-
tive time.

S e c o n d l y :   I  understood  from  a  letter  written  by  Hodja  Hasan  that  his 
good opinion of me is a hundred times greater than my due, and that he will 
be a publisher of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  who works on the same system as the hero 
of Denizli, the late Hasan Feyzi. Allah willing, other Hasan Feyzi’s like him 
will emerge in Afyon too and it will not lag behind Denizli, and will trans-
form our hardships into mercy.

My Brothers!
I have not been curious about the newspapers, but articles supporting us 
appearing at this time in both E h l - i   S ü n n e t  and S e b i l - ü r - R e ş a d  has confused 
those  jealous  people  who  oppose  us  and  the  hostile  covert  atheists.  I  am 
anxious that they may try to silence those friends.

My Dear, Loyal, Steadfast Brothers!
With all their stratagems, the dissemblers’ attacks these last ten months 
and their getting hold of an ofﬁcial has not shaken even the youngest student. 
Their slanders are insigniﬁcant. In the face of the ofﬁcial’s hundred  lies that 
we proved, he found one single error he said was contrary to the facts, in one 
of our letters, that a newspaper had reported that the former governor had 
been promoted. But the error was the newspaper’s. Anyway, such slanders 
from such people have virtually no effect on us, and, Allah willing, they will 
cause no harm to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  circle. As I told you before, don’t give any 
importance to the written calumnies of that ofﬁcial, don’t let them confuse 
your ideas. If there is any legal point the reply to which is not found in my 
defence, give a brief answer. And say: “ Said says: I am not going to attach 
any importance to that malicious indictment by replying to it lest I vex the

three courts which acquitted us, or be in contempt of them. A complete and 
apt reply is furnished by my long defence, especially the ten points showing 
the ten ways it is illegal.”

F i r s t l y :  It is an instance of divine favour that I did not hear that man’s 
slanderous indictment, otherwise I would have spoken vehemently. I would 
have told the chairman of the court: I am taking you to court, that is, you 
and your injustice to the supreme tribunal at the Last Judgement, and I am 
taking your contempt of the law to the court of this world. And the reason 
I said I have no lawyer was to tell them that he is the lawyer of all of us in 
general matters, and only I can reply to the attacks on my person. You may 
tell Ahmed Hikmet this.

S e c o n d l y :  Our former defences are sufﬁcient to answer the prosecutor’s 

charges.

T h i r d l y :  Mustafa Osman and Ceylan wrote and told me what they thought 
of it and that it had caused them no discomfort, and that it would have no 
adverse effects in the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  circle either. I saw the hero Tahiri. He 
had the same idea. I was curious as to what Husrev, the Feyzis, and Sabri 
thought.

F o u r t h l y :   I  reckon  it  is  because  disbelief  and  misguidance  now  attack 
us in the form of secret societies and political groups that divine determin-
ing makes them torment us with this extreme tyranny and the accusation of 
being a political society. It means there is an overriding need for the believ-
ers to be united. We were unaware of that fact, so received the blow of jus-
tice from divine determining.

maliciously and illegally, and does not hear the loud weeping through the 
tongue of disposition at the oppression in our house, at such a time, the best 
place to be is prison. Only, if it were possible, it would best if we were trans-
ferred to another prison.

S e c o n d l y :  Just as they force the most unsuitable people to read the most 
conﬁdential treatises, so they insist and force us to be a political society. But 
we feel no need at all to be a political society or secret revolutionary group 
of any sort. For among the Nurjus, due to sincerity and self- sacriﬁce, the 
Islamic brotherhood of the uniﬁed community of believers has unfolded to 
a high degree. With the powerful devotion they have inherited from their 
millions  of  forefathers,  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students  are  bound  to  a  truth  for 
which their forefathers sacriﬁced their lives, and up to now this has left no 
need for any society, ofﬁcial or political, secret or open, or any revolution-
ary group. This means that now there is a need, for divine determining has 
set them to pester us. They tyrannize us with accusations of an imaginary 
political society. And divine determining deals us a slap with their hands, 
saying: “ Why haven’t you had complete sincerity, perfect solidarity, or been 
a perfect ‘Allah’s party’? ”, and it has acted in justice.

F i r s t l y :  I know that you are not in need of consolation. Strengthen one 
another’s morale, and that will be sufﬁcient. The wall-hanging I have on the 
wall opposite me is sufﬁcient for me. It has been understood that this last 
attack consisted of completely unjustiﬁable and illegal intimidation, as the 
result  of  groundless  suspicions  and  weakness.  However,  the  stand  of  the 
people and police was a sort of objection to that meaningless attack.

S e c o n d l y :  Is my defence adequate as a reply to the new charges as well? 
Also, are Zübeyir and the lawyers working? They are not anxious, are they? 
They should not worry at all. In view of the matters with which they have 
charged  us,  they  should  charge  all  those  who  share  in  the  brotherhood  of 
belief,  and  even  all  the  congregations  and  i m a m s ,  and  the  students  of  all 
masters and teachers. This means that their opponents have gained consider-
able power so that instead of actual incidents they are utilizing possibilities 
in this panicky way and attacking us with extraordinary delusions.

Our Beloved Master!
While  the  main  duty  of  the  scholars  of  the  experts’  committee  was  to 
defend  and  protect  the  believers  and  especially  those  who  uphold  the 
Qur’an, with their biased reports about us they have driven the Afyon legal 
authorities to investigate us in the closest detail; have kept you, our beloved 
Master, under the severest repression for eight months; been the cause of 
prolonging the imprisonment of us students; and have studied the undeni-
ably miraculous truths of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  in a spirit of jealousy. Doubtless, 
your writings replying to their reports, which incited Afyon Court against 
us, were the work of your compassion. Let alone defending you, our beloved 
Master,  who  for  twenty-ﬁve  years  has  been  struggling  against  our  covert 
enemies with a handful of students, and the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which comprises 
the Qur’an’s most important truths, although it is your right to ask numerous 
questions of these scholars who have formed a front against us in this our 
most perilous hour, your very minor questions will do nothing except warn 
them. The “special favour” is a supreme divine bounty. Arising from sources 
we have much need of in these sensitive times, it transforms our despair into 
pride and has again been manifested here in Afyon Prison. The earth, which 
has  not  trembled  for  eight  months,  again  became  angry  today  and  twice 
shook as you were describing the earthquakes which occur when you, our 
beloved Master, and the Risale-i Nur are attacked. We witnessed it as well, 
and it strengthened our hope. It pitied your apparent aloneness in the face of 
the fearsome onslaughts of the cruel enemies thirsting to destroy you. It had 
physical compassion on your powerlessness, came to your assistance, and 
with the quaking earth afﬁrmed the rightness of your cause. Giving the good 
news of “ Victory is ours, ” which through a divine, angelic power, issues 
from your blessed pen, it made us truly grateful to our beloved Master.

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!
F i r s t l y :  What is necessary are caution, composure, and consultation.
S e c o n d l y :  It was imparted to me that Zübeyir was given to me in place 
of my late nephew Abdurrahman, and Ceylan, in place of my late nephew 
Fuad. So here I am handing over my work to them.

T h i r d l y :   I  have  been  informed  that  the  judges  of  the  court  have  made 
a pretext of the letter I wrote and was put at the head of hardworking but 
incautious  Ahmed  Feyzi’s  M â i d e t ü ’ l - K u r ’ a n .  Saying:  “ Said  afﬁrms  the 
eulogies and the other things written about him, ” they have made it a reason 
for my conviction. I repeatedly said that before anything else Ahmed Feyzi 
should explain it -that the letter was written in order to not accept the other 
letters about him, and so that he should modify the other part of it- neverthe-
less he wrote things unnecessarily that make them angry. If he had a thou-
sand faults, I would not be offended at him, but he should be wary of acting 
boldly and incautiously, lest harm comes to the R i s a l e - i   N u r .

F o u r t h l y :  Brother Ahmed Feyzi, the hero of the Feyzis, should behave 
exactly  like  Tahiri  in  Tahiri’s  ward,  which  is  his  m e d r e s e ,  and  should 
encourage his students in place of those who have been released, with les-
sons from the Qur’an and R i s a l e - i  N u r , and with writing out its treatises. The 
notebooks of the new students, which he sent me yesterday, turned my sorry 
state into one of joy. “ All praise be to Allah, ” I declared.

* * *
This time, the assault is on a very large scale. Due to their groundless sus-
picions the Prime Minister and Cabinet attacked us in accordance with some 
plan. According to information I have received and numerous signs, due to 
the false reports and intrigues of covert dissemblers, they have shown us to 
be closely connected with the caliphate movement and a secret community 
belonging to the Naqshbandi Order, indeed to be leading it, and have caused 
the government to be greatly alarmed about us. For evidence they point out 
the large collections of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  being bound in Istanbul and pub-
lished  throughout  the  Islamic  world  and  being  well-received  everywhere, 
and have scared the government, and unjustiﬁably turned the jealous ofﬁ-
cial h o d j a s  and suspicious ofﬁcials against us. They reckoned that numerous 
documents and plentiful evidence would be brought to light, and that in the 

538

vein of the Old Said, I would be unable to endure it and would create a dis-
turbance. But endless thanks be to Almighty Allah, He reduced the calam-
ity a thousandfold. In all their searches they found nothing to connect us to 
any secret community or society. We have no connection that they should 
have found it. The prosecutor was therefore compelled to resort to lies and 
slander,  giving  things  the  wrong  meaning,  and  making  allegations  about 
things  that  were  not  offences.  Since  the  truth  is  this,  we  and  the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r  have been delivered from ninety-nine per cent of the calamity. In which 
case, we should not complain, but offering endless thanks and beseeching 
Almighty Allah, await the completion of this manifestation of divine favour 
in  patience.  And  with  the  lessons  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  we  should  console 
those  needy  and  eager  people  who  constantly  enter  and  depart  from  this 
place of study.

S a i d   N u r s i

My Dear, Loyal Brother!
I understood from a severe warning that the excessive, detrimental, com-
bative and politically- minded pieces you and Ahmed Feyzi read in court 
-outside the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s way, which is not to be combative, nor to contest 
the  worldly,  nor  touch  on  politics,  and  only  when  absolutely  essential  to 
defend oneself brieﬂy- has caused great harm to the  R i s a l e - i   N u r . In fact, 
they were the cause of our sentences and the ill-treatment I have received. I 
am not offended at you and Ahmed Feyzi, but you should have shown them 
to me ﬁrst. Your position was given you as a material divine decree. You 
have to act like me to repair the damage. It is essential that Feyzi also gives 
up the political style of defence with all his strength, and like Tahiri, occu-
pies himself with the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and the new students.

My Dear and Loyal Brothers!
It  was  imparted  to  me  that  I  should  write  and  tell  you  of  two  strange, 
subtle incidents that occurred within two hours, and were apparently insig-
niﬁcant but in fact important.

T h e   F i r s t :  I was reading to two people destined to be R i s a l e - i   N u r  stu-
dents “ An Important Matter Which was Imparted to My Heart on the Night 
of  Power ”  from  A   G u i d e   F o r   Yo u t h ,  then  just  as  I  read  “ it  gains  for  the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  students in ten weeks the level of study the students of the reli-
gious schools (   m e d r e s e   )  gain in ﬁve or ten years, ” this occurred to me: just 
as through divine grace the Old Said acquired in ﬁfteen weeks at the age of 
ﬁfteen the knowledge usually acquired in the m e d r e s e s  with ﬁfteen years of 
study, so through dominical mercy at this time when there are no m e d r e s e s , 
the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  is sufﬁcient for acquiring in ﬁfteen weeks the knowledge 
of the sciences of reality and belief it would otherwise take ﬁfteen years to 
acquire, as ﬁfteen thousand people have afﬁrmed through their own experi-
ence this ﬁfteen years.

S e c o n d l y :  That same time, my window, which is heavy, for no reason 
fell on my dishes and bottles and food. I supposed that both the window and 
all my bottles and drinking glasses were broken and the food they contained 
ruined. But marvellously, not one thing was either broken or spoilt. Only the 
meat I had received as a present was spilt. But it was destined for the new 
students of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , maintaining my rule of not accepting presents, 
and conﬁrming with its extraordinariness the ﬁrst incident.

My Brothers!
In a way totally opposed to the law, our documents and additional pieces 
for the appeal have not yet been sent to the Appeal Court. Our three author-
ized lawyers should ﬁnd some way of ensuring that they are sent as soon as 
possible. For their prolonging our detention for eleven months on excuses, 
and  not  permitting  me  to  speak  in  court,  and  their  holding  me  in  solitary 
conﬁnement for eleven months in cold, torturous, and distressing conditions, 
tells  of  a  malicious  bias  unacceptable  by  justice.  It  is  therefore  essential 
that both our lawyers and you do everything in your power to have our trial 
transferred to a court in another province.

My Dear, Loyal, Sincere, Steadfast, Devoted Brothers!
F i r s t l y :  The reason I don’t keep a copy of T h e   M y s t e r y   o f  W V  
( 108:1 )  with me is that long ago there was some confusion in two premoni-
tions I had.

T h e   F i r s t :  I perceived through a premonition a terrible event that would 
occur  in  this  country  alone,  and  the  rise  of  tyrants.  The  mighty  mystery 
became apparent twelve years later as I had foretold, but in the large sphere, 
on the face of the earth. For sure it apparently altered what I had predicted, 
but in reality it turned out to be completely correct and pure truth. For this 
reason, I do not keep that treatise with me and I do not give it to others.

S e c o n d l y :  Forty years ago I used repeatedly to say: “ I see a light. ” I used 
to give good tidings of it. I supposed the light to be on a country-wide scale. 
However, it was the R i s a l e - i   N u r ; I reckoned the circle of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
students to be the political sphere of the whole country, and I was in error.

Sir!
I  thank  you  for  having  the  ﬂag  of  the  Independence  Holiday  hung  on 
my ward. During the national struggle in Istanbul, Ankara knew that I had 
performed the service of maybe a military division through publishing and 
distributing my work entitled T h e   S i x   S t e p s  against the British and Greeks, 
for twice Mustafa Kemal notiﬁed me in cypher wanting me to go to Ankara.

We say the following in the face of those who, departing from reality and 
justice,  have  called  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students’  attachment  for  the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r   and  its  interpreter,  which  looks  purely  and  sincerely  to  the  hereafter, 
a  worldly,  political  society,  and  have  tried  to  show  this  to  be  a  criminal 
offence, despite three courts of law having acquitted them in that respect:

The basis of all human society, and especially the Islamic nation, are ear-
nest love between relatives; concerned relations between tribes and groups; 
brotherhood and moral assistance for fellow believers arising from Islamic 
nationhood; self-sacriﬁcing concern for one’s fellow- countrymen and the 
members of one’s nation; and unshakeable attachment and devotion to and 
support for the truths of the Qur’an, which save their eternal lives, and for 
those who disseminate them. It is only by denying these bonds, which secure 
the life of society, and by accepting the Red Peril -which is scattering the ter-
rible seed of anarchy in the north, destroying nations and their youth, and by 
drawing everyone’s children to itself, annihilates kinship and nationhood, 
and opens the way to the total corruption of human civilization and society- 
that the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students can be called a political society in the sense of 
its being a crime.

The R i s a l e - i   N u r  students therefore do not hesitate to display their attach-
ment to the Qur’an’s truths and their ﬁrm relations with their brothers of the 
hereafter. They accept gratefully any punishment that may be given them 
because of that brotherhood, and admit the truth to your just court. They do 
not condescend to defend themselves with trickery, sycophancy, and lies.

[ Husrev’s Defence ]

THE RAYS

To Afyon Criminal Court

In the indictment the prosecution has charged me in two respects, one 
general, the other particular. The general charge is my service of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  and my sharing in the imaginary crime of my Master. The particular 
charge is my life of seclusion, which is of no importance and constitutes no 
crime, as well as a number of circumstances related to my personal life. In 
reply to the prosecution’s making me share in my Master’s imaginary crime 
because of my service to the R i s a l e - i   N u r , I say this:

On the way my Master has taken, I participate with all my heart and soul 
in the imaginary crime with which he is charged, in the sacred service he 
performs through the R i s a l e - i   N u r  for the Islamic world and particularly for 
this country and nation. I shall offer thanks to Almighty Allah till the end of 
my days for having given me success in this service of religious belief.

Respected Judges! Certain evidence of my success in serving the R i s a l e - i  

N u r  is this:

It was my writing out the copies of the Qur’an, although I had little pro-
ﬁciency in Arabic calligraphy, in a wondrous and unprecedented way, per-
fectly, outside my will and power. One of these you have in your possession.
The second evidence is my success in writing nearly six hundred copies 
of various parts of the R i s a l e - i  N u r , which for twenty years has secured enor-
mous beneﬁts for this country and nation, and for religion and good moral-
ity. In fact, in the short time of one month I wrote out fourteen treatises, as 
my friends know. I ﬁnd it superﬂuous to defend also those points related to 
my part in my Master’s sacred service, which are supposed to be offences. I 
afﬁrm with all my strength my Master’s written objections and their adden-
dum, and I present them to your high court as my own objections.

Respected Judges! Our Master follows no worldly or political aim at 
all  in  his  blessed,  sacred,  and  luminous  works,  which  your  court  is  still 
holding and which consist of the truths of belief and the Qur’an. Moreo-
ver, just as I and my friends conﬁrm the sacred service he has performed 
for this country and nation, so did the patriots in the Union and Progress 
government conﬁrm it. For at that time, they gave nineteen thousand gold 
liras for his university in Van, called the Medresetü’z-Zehra. The lovers 
of their country admiringly conﬁrmed his patriotic, scholarly endeavours. 
Then one hundred and sixty-three deputies out of two hundred allotted one 
hundred  and  ﬁfty  thousand  liras,  when  funds  were  very  scarce,  for  that 
university of his in the east.

THE FOURTEENTH RAY

Throughout his life, my sacred, blessed Master, whom the prosecution 
has designated a criminal, has compelled even his most obdurate and jealous

To Afyon Criminal Court

As has been communicated to me by the ofﬁce of the Afyon state pros-
ecutor, I have been sent to trial together with my Master, Bediuzzaman Said 
Nursi, and his other companions in connection with the matter of inciting the 
people to breach state security by exploiting religious feelings.

I gave correct answers to the questions asked of me both in Isparta Mag-
istrates’ Court, and in the ofﬁce of the Afyon examining magistrate. Denizli 
Court,  which  acquitted  us,  returned  all  our  books  to  us,  and  did  not  con-
vict  us  for  reading  and  writing  out  the  treatises  of  my  Master,  Bediuzza-
man, or for corresponding with our brothers who are his students. However, 
six years ago, without my Master’s permission, on my own initiative I had 
printed in Istanbul ﬁve hundred copies of the Seventh Ray by Bediuzzaman 
in the old letters. In accordance with the decision dated 20.7.1945, Denizli 
Court returned these in their entirety together with their box, handing them 
over to me in person. They were then distributed at cost price to R i s a l e - i   N u r  
students eager for them.

In consequence of that court’s decision, which had been ratiﬁed by the 
Appeal Court and had been made ﬁnal, two years ago I bought a duplicating 
machine in Istanbul and paper, and took them to Isparta.

Of  the  three  collections  which  you  have  in  your  possession,  two  were 
written out by my brother Husrev Altınbaşak, and one was written out by 
myself. First of all we printed Z ü l ﬁ k â r , containing T h e   M i r a c l e s   o f  M u h a m -
m a d   (   U W B P   )   and  T h e   M i r a c u l o u s n e s s   o f  
t h e   Q u r ’ a n .   This  we  in  part 
sold,  and  with  the  money  bought  the  paper  for  T h e   S t a f f   o f   M o s e s   C o l -
l e c t i o n   (   A s â - y ı   M û s a   ) .  We  then  printed  T h e   S t a f f   o f   M o s e s ,   and  sold  it.

THE RAYS

Then we bought the paper for T h e   I l l u m i n a t i n g   L a m p   C o l l e c t i o n   (   S i r a c ü n -
n û r   ) , and printed it. This continued for about a year. Then, when bringing 
around  thirty  copies  of  these  collections  to  Eğirdir,  I  was  arrested  on  the 
way, and handed over to the judicial authorities in Eğirdir. Not much time 
had  passed  when  on  the  initiative  of  the  Isparta  judicial  authorities,  Hus-
rev Altınbaşak’s house was searched and both the duplicating machine and 
the  collections  were  seized,  and  we  were  sent  to  court  to  be  tried  for  the 
offences of a year previously. Since they were religious works which were 
not prohibited, Husrev Altınbaşak, myself, and one other friend were given 
sentences of one month for printing books without permission. We applied 
to  the  Appeal  Court,  and  before  it  had  come  to  a  decision,  I  was  sent  to 
Afyon Prison.

Now, in your high court, because of this altruistic service of mine for my 
religion and co-religionists, and particularly the question of the Fifth Ray, 
which contains interpretations of Hadiths and was returned by the former 
court, the Afyon state prosecutor wants to have me, and the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s 
author,  and  Husrev  Altınbaşak,  and  forty-six  other  student  brothers  pun-
ished  for  “ breaching  state  security, ”  because  they  wrote  out  these  works 
and read them.

I  say  to  you  in  your  presence  as  a  full  citizen  of  this  country,  without 
deviating from the truth, that for years I have been the student of Said Nursi, 
whom we hold with the highest esteem as our Master, and who with these 
works has rectiﬁed our conduct religiously and advanced us, and has rejected 
it when we called him “ Regenerator of Religion. ” I can testify categorically 
and absolutely certainly that neither he himself nor his works nor his stu-
dents have in any way attempted to breach state security. One of the matters 
concerning which we have been charged is the money obtained from sale of 
the books, concerning which Isparta Court was fully aware and was unable 
to ﬁnd us guilty and sentence us. For just as we were in no need to secure 
our livelihoods through sale of the books, so we used the money obtained 
from their sale to buy the duplicating machine, paper, and ink. There is no 
possibility of this service, which we performed purely for Allah’s sake with 
pure intention, being a crime, and therefore request of your high court and 
consciences that the copies of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  be returned.

[ Zübeyir’s Defence ]

To Afyon Criminal Court

I am charged with founding a secret society and breaching state security. 
As I shall set out below, since you will form the certain opinion that I have 
committed no such crime, I reject the charge here and now. Yes, I can say 
gratefully and outright that I am a R i s a l e - i   N u r  student. It would be contrary 
to the virtue the R i s a l e - i   N u r  has taught me to deny it, and I cannot commit 
such a misdemeanour. A person who reads the R i s a l e - i   N u r  would not con-
ceal it. On the contrary, he would proclaim it proudly and fearlessly. For it 
contains not a single word or sentence that demands hesitation.

I tried to describe the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s value in forty to ﬁfty pages. I cannot 
say that I praised it. For I do not have the ability to praise any part of the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , let alone the whole collection. For it is a true commentary on 
the All-Wise Qur’an, which is the sun of the universe and its intelligence, 
and has been illuminating and guiding humanity for around one thousand 
three hundred years. If any matter related to a secret society has been found 
in the works, as I stated above, I attempted to describe the value of, then 
punish me for the crime of trying to disseminate harmful works. However, 
the wonderful way in which the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is written has been afﬁrmed by 
learned scholars; it is sufﬁciently powerful to reform a corrupted society; it 
is a guide for the people of the twentieth century and saves them from mis-
guidance and the vice they are dragged down to by materialism and natural-
ism, and from the dense darkness of their ideas; and through the effulgence 
of the Qur’an, it has opened up for mankind a way leading to happiness and 
salvation, pointing it out clearly with its light. So if the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   C o l -
l e c t i o n  does not contain any discussions related to the crime of which I am 
accused, it is my opinion that your court too will agree that to punish me 
would be contrary to justice.

I was asked by the examining magistrate: “ Are you a R i s a l e - i   N u r  stu-

dent? ”

I do not consider myself worthy to be the student of a genius like Bedi-
uzzaman Said Nursi. But if he accepts me, I proudly confess: “ Yes, I am a 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  student. ”

Having  been  slandered  on  numerous  occasions  by  his  secret  enemies, 
my Master Bediuzzaman Said Nursi, the peerless author of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
has been sent to court, and every time has been acquitted. The R i s a l e - i   N u r  
has been scrutinized line by line by committees of professors and Islamic 

546

THE RAYS

scholars and they have given reports stating that the work is written with 
unsurpassed knowledge and is a true commentary on the Qur’an. Since that 
is the truth, why is he sent to court? My ﬁrmly held views on this subject are 
as follows:

Those who read the R i s a l e - i  N u r , especially the perceptive young, acquire 
a powerful belief. They become unshakeably self-sacriﬁcing and religious 
and devoted to their country. The immorality and vice inculcated by nega-
tive ideologies can ﬁnd no foothold where there is indestructible faith. The 
more those with such belief increase in number, Freemasonry and commu-
nism  cannot  expand  and  spread.  The  R i s a l e - i   N u r   proves  rationally,  logi-
cally, and in scholarly fashion with verses from the Qur’an and extremely 
powerful proofs and arguments, that materialist philosophy, on which com-
munism is based, has absolutely no connection with truth and reality, and 
that its theories are completely unfounded. It illumines those who fall into 
the darkness of those rotten ideas, and saves them. It proves Allah’s exist-
ence with powerful evidences that cannot be denied or objected to, to even 
materialists, who believe only what their eyes can see.

With its original and attractive style and elevated literary art, this won-
derful work quite simply makes itself read, and by high school and univer-
sity students in particular.

It is because of this that the communists and Masons know that the R i s a l e -
i   N u r  forms a powerful obstacle to the spread of their poisonous ideas. They 
have recourse to various stratagems and calumnies in order to eliminate the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , or not to have it read, since, as a true Qur’anic commentary, 
it is a powerful source of belief. Although up to now there has been no sign 
whatsoever  of  any  of  the  lies  they  have  ascribed  to  us,  they  continue  to 
attack us. It is understood from this that they want to intimidate us, make us 
give up the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and at the same time put before us their own putrid 
publications.  In  this  way,  causing  the  nation  and  youth  to  lose  their  faith 
altogether, they want to bring about a decline in moral standards, and thus 
to make the country cave in on itself. It is their ambition to hand over this 
country and its people to a foreign power. In the presence of the bench of 
judges I say this fearlessly:

They should know this and tremble; we are not to be intimidated by mere 
threats. For we have seen truth and reality in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and learnt it 
and believed in it. The Turkish youth is not sleeping. This heroic Islamic 
Turkish  nation  will  not  bow  down  under  the  yoke  of  another  country. 
The religious, warlike Turkish nation, the believing, brave Turkish youth, 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

547

fear nothing. It is for this reason that we read the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which raises 
us  to  the  highest  degrees  of  humanity,  ensures  that  we  advance  in  every 
ﬁeld, and instilling in us young people love of religion, country, and nation, 
makes us true lovers of religion who will sacriﬁce all our beings for them. 
And we shall read this work. As I stated above, I have read very little of the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , and yet I have proﬁted enormously. This work is of the very 
greatest beneﬁt for this country and nation and for all humanity, and if I had 
wealth, I would spend all of it to publish it. For I am ready to sacriﬁce my 
whole being for my religion and the eternal happiness and well-being of my 
country and nation.

Moreover, I have not believed in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  naively. Thirty-three 
verses of the Qur’an, and Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) and 
‘Abd al-Qadir Geylani ( May Allah be pleased with him ) made predictions 
that the R i s a l e - i   N u r  would be written and would offer guidance to the peo-
ple of this age. Furthermore, the parts of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  that I have read 
have made me form the opinion that this collection consists of works that 
teach truth and reality and that reform humanity.

I felt a great emptiness in my spirit, and when searching for a book to 
read,  I  came  across  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r .  Then  when  I  read  it,  I  could  not  be 
without it or put it down. I felt that the R i s a l e - i   N u r  was meeting the over-
whelming need in my heart. I found in it the rational proofs of belief to save 
me from doubts about belief and knowledge. In this way I was saved from 
the distress of scepticism. I understood from its truths that the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
was written for us, the people of this age.

Powerful belief is necessary so that one may acquire the elevated virtues 
necessary for good conduct and manners, and courtesy. Since the truths of 
belief are explained by means of extremely powerful proofs and clear exam-
ples in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , the more I read it, the stronger my belief became. In 
this way I was saved from giving up my religion, which is truth and reality 
and comprises the principles of the highest civilization, and from the calam-
ity  of  being  swallowed  by  the  red  monster.  Thus,  since  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  
saves  its  readers  from  numerous  calamities,  material  and  spiritual;  makes 
them more knowledgeable than a university graduate; instils in them love of 
Islam, country, and nation; and teaches them obedience to Allah, and to be 
hardworking and compassionate; no one who realizes its value would give 
it up, whatever the price. This sincere respect and veneration could be torn 
out of no one’s heart.

548

THE RAYS

The  R i s a l e - i   N u r   is  described  by  the  prosecution  as  a  harmful  work.  I 
protest  in  the  strongest  terms  at  this  lack  of  conscience  and  lie.  And  it  is 
claimed that I encourage it. Yes, this is true. The hearts of all the enlightened 
who  heard  the  other  lie  were  pained,  indeed  they  wept  and  gnashed  their 
teeth. The twentieth century is a time positivist ideas are dominant. Things 
for which there are no proof and evidence are not believed in, and we do not 
believe in them. We want proof that the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is harmful.

Another of the aims of our covert enemies who concoct these lies is to 
destroy  the  solidarity  of  those  who  read  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  which  is  mani-
fested as their embracing each other in exceptional fashion due to the bonds 
of Islam and for the sake of serving the Qur’an, and expresses only respect, 
compassion,  and  affection,  and  has  no  other  goal  in  sight.  Our  enemies 
should not struggle against us for nothing. I am the most backward, the most 
ordinary of those who read the R i s a l e - i   N u r , yet I give them this reply:

Even if one of us is in the east, one in the west, one in the south, one in 
the north, one in the hereafter, and one in this world, we are still together. If 
the power of all the universe were to amass, it could not separate us from our 
exalted Master, Said Nursi, or from the R i s a l e - i   N u r , or from one another.

For we serve the Qur’an and we shall serve it. Because we believe in the 
reality of the hereafter, no force can root out this love and solidarity of ours. 
All Muslims shall gather together in the abode of eternal happiness.

With your permission, I shall describe an important fact concerning the 
well-being of our country and nation: one of the communists’ secret plans is 
to incite the people against the government.

False information was given the leaders of the government so that Bedi-
uzzaman Said Nursi should be sent to prison and his works be seen as harm-
ful. But no one believed the negative propaganda. For years the people of 
this nation have believed so ﬁrmly that he is a unique Islamic scholar this 
age and in every way without peer that no propaganda can destroy their true 
conviction.

I offer praise and thanks to Almighty Allah that He has favoured me with 
proﬁting from the works of a great Master. I am indebted with all my heart 
and soul to him for being the means of my learning about belief and Islam, 
and beneﬁting immeasurably. Since my Master has saved me from the dis-
tress I suffered for years as I wrote, and my youth from becoming fodder for 
communism, and my being condemned to everlasting solitary conﬁnement, 
I am prepared to languish in this worldly prison for years for him.

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

549

If I suffer capital punishment on the way of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , a Qur’anic 
commentary which in twenty years has taught millions of people religion, 
belief, Islam, and virtue, preserving them from irreligion, I shall run to the 
gallows crying: “ Allah! Allah! Ya Rasulallah! ” If I am executed by ﬁring 
squad on the way of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which protects our young people from 
abandoning their religion and being swept away by communism to eternal 
perdition, and from crimes for which they would be shot as traitors to their 
country, without ﬂinching I shall bare my chest to the bullets. And I beseech 
my Sustainer that if I am cut to pieces by knives for my Master Bediuzza-
man, with my blood spurting in all directions I shall write: “ The  R i s a l e - i  
N u r ! The R i s a l e - i   N u r ! ”

Respected Judges of the Court!
The education the R i s a l e - i   N u r  gives is truly marvellous and original; it 
is without equal. The purpose of other sorts of education is to gain material 
beneﬁts and to attain various positions. People study mostly for material-
ist  ends  and  to  be  able  to  become  famous,  or  sometimes  merely  because 
they  have  to  study.  However,  those  who  by  reading  its  treatises,  receive 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  education, which resembles an unorganized free university, 
nurture no worldly aims, only to serve the Qur’an and belief.

Nevertheless, the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which consists of serious, scholarly trea-
tises about the truths of belief, is read with such enthusiasm, passion, and 
pleasure, that it awakens in those who read it faithfully the desire to read it 
over and over again. Even though those who read and write out the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  may ﬁnd their lives in danger at the doors of the courtroom, they state 
openly that they read these wonderful works, and that they shall read them. 
Even if they know that the decision will be given for their execution, they do 
not hesitate to display this constancy. This characteristic of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
one of its many wonders, makes one ask: “ Did those who admit this, ﬁnd 
their lives by the wayside? ”

This means that contained in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and Bediuzzaman is a truth 

so elevated that as well as not being harmful they did not deny it.

Normally  students  are  made  to  study  under  the  constraints  of  disci-
pline and authority. However, Bediuzzaman compelled no one to study the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , and hundreds of thousands of readers study it devotedly and 
resolutely, the majority of them without ever seeing him. Such a wondrous 
method of education was never seen in any m e d r e s e , either recently or previ-
ously, and was never encountered in any university.

550

THE RAYS

The prosecutor said: “ The respect in which Bediuzzaman is held has not 

been offered to any other Qur’anic commentator. ”

That is correct. Seeing that respect and reverence are awarded in relation 
to greatness and achievement, and gratitude and thanks are offered to the 
degree one has proﬁted, Bediuzzaman’s works are proﬁted from to an enor-
mous degree so that respect for him and gratitude to him are unprecedented.
The  Masons  and  communists  expended  every  effort  so  that  Bediuzza-
man, the greatest Islamic thinker and writer of the twentieth century, would 
not be known by us, and especially by the young. But the wide-awake Turk-
ish Muslim nation and youth recognized that hero of religion, our Master, 
and they beneﬁted from him and allowed others to do so. It is because of this 
that their extraordinary attachment and conﬁdence cannot be shaken.

Since the Qur’anic verses in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  are expounded in Turkish 
with supreme art and skill without anything of their virtues, which are the 
Qur’an’s greatest miracle, being lost, every class of people – men, women, 
ofﬁcials, tradesmen, scholars and philosophers – can read and understand it. 
Proﬁting from it to the extent they can, they become ever more attached to it. 
High school students, university students, professors, lecturers, and philoso-
phers all read it. These educated classes proﬁt from it to an extraordinary 
degree, afﬁrming its originality and the superior art of its composition, and 
feeling a strong desire to read the whole work.

When perceptive and appreciative people ﬁrst come to know Bediuzza-
man and the R i s a l e - i   N u r , they are inﬁnitely regretful they did not know of 
them previously, and in order to make up for lost time, never waste their 
spare  time,  and  if  they  have  ﬁve  minutes  even,  pick  up  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
and read it day and night. This extraordinary interest and demand has never 
ever been shown for the work of any psychologist, sociologist, or philoso-
pher. Only the educated can beneﬁt from them. If a middle school student 
or a housewife reads the work of a eminent philosopher, he or she does not 
proﬁt from it. But everyone proﬁts from the R i s a l e - i   N u r  in accordance with 
his level. For this reason, the whole nation awaits your decision to acquit 
Bediuzzaman and the R i s a l e - i  N u r  students. If in this time of tribulation Said 
Nursi had not impressed on his students the need for patience, endurance, 
and moderation, as when the commander of a volunteer militia force in the 
First  War  he  mustered  his  students  to  ﬁght,  so  out  of  the  great  honour  in 
which they hold him thousands of R i s a l e - i   N u r  students would have pitched 
their tents on the heights around Afyon and awaited the decision of Afyon 
Criminal Court to acquit him.

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

551

The  work  that  Said  Nursi  and  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students  do  cannot  be 
considered  within  the  framework  of  the  law  and  be  proved  to  be  a  secret 
society. Why can it not be proved? Is a legal expert who has risen to be chief 
public  prosecutor  incapable  of  proving  it  according  to  the  law?  No,  he  is 
certainly not incapable. But there is no organization that could be called a 
secret political society. That is why it cannot be proved.

It is a contradiction that the statement the prosecutor ﬁrst gave, which was 
completely accurate and in accordance with the law, said that “ the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  students are not a political society, ” and then a bit later for some reason 
said that “ they are a political society. ” Of course the latter is invalid. We 
are certain that the judges will see this fact clearly and give the decision that 
“ there is no secret society. ”
Judges of the Court!
If when suffering sorrow and anguish a piece were to be broken off the 
heart, the news of a youth losing his religion should make the heart break 
into pieces to the number of its minute particles.

Thus,  the  acquittal  you  shall  give  shall  be  the  cause  of  the  Muslim 
youth and Islamic world being effectively saved from this terrible plague. 
This is another of the reasons binding me inseparably to Bediuzzaman and 
his works.

Your decision to acquit the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and give it its freedom will save 
all  the  Turkish  youth  and  all  Muslims  from  the  tragedy  of  irreligion.  For 
without  any  doubt  at  all,  one  day  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  a  treasury  of  elevated 
truths,  will  be  known  throughout  the  world.  Then  you  shall  be  appreci-
ated by all mankind. Your decision to acquit the R i s a l e - i   N u r  will make the 
present and future generations grateful to you, and the more it is read and 
beneﬁted from, the more you shall be appreicated.

Beware! Do not suppose these sincere words of mine are hypocritical. 
Absolutely not! Because I am afraid of no one while Bediuzzaman is being 
tried, nor do I waver.

Only, with your permission, I want to say this much: if the prosecutor 
continues to make such despicable charges against the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which 
is a superlative means of preventing Freemasonry and communism in this 
blessed country, and against its author and readers, and he does not desist 
from making those entirely erroneous accusations, and carried away by his 
feelings, opposes them, he will be supporting communism and Freemasonry, 
and will be assisting the noxious atheists to multiply, against whom in truth 
these charges should be made.

Part of Zübeyir’s Supplement for the Appeal Court

THE RAYS

[ Part of Zübeyir’s Supplement for the Appeal Court ]

Through its proofs the R i s a l e - i   N u r  repairs the belief of people which has 
been  destroyed  by  the  doubts  and  scepticism  sown  by  the  publications  of 
secret atheistic organizations.

One  of  the  least  tangible  reasons  for  the  youth  adhering  to  the  R i s a l e -
i   N u r  as though electrocuted, is this: for years with unparalleled devotion 
and self-sacriﬁce, elderly and ill, at a time demanding extraordinary caution, 
with superhuman patience Bediuzzaman Said Nursi has endured the various 
torments of his enemies, the communists, Masons, and those hoodwinked by 
them. With his truth-seeing, realistic view, he has distinguished numerous 
treacherous stratagems against religion, and has written works about belief 
which will bring to nothing their fearsomely cunning, covert plans.

But what a regretable, sad and sorry situation it is, that for twenty-ﬁve 
years they have tried to eliminate this champion of Islam, this matchless 
person,  in  prisons  and  places  of  detention,  in  absolute  solitary  conﬁne-
ment. Even if due to animosity resulting from the unfounded suspicions 
given rise to by the treachery of communists, the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s author has 
been punished, his works continue to be read with ever increasing interest 
and enthusiasm.

The ﬁrst and most powerful evidence is this: the young people who read 
the work T h e   S t a f f   o f   M o s e s   (   A s â - y ı   M û s a   ) , which has been duplicated in 
the new letters, quickly learn the Qur’anic alphabet in order to be able to 
read the rest of the works. This removes the obstacle of not knowing the 
Qur’anic script, which prevents a person learning numerous sciences and 
compels him to read works written speciﬁcally to distance him from reli-
gion and belief. Whenever the younger generation has been decked out and 
fortiﬁed with the Qur’an and the sciences that irradiate from it, the nation 
to which that youth belongs has begun to progress and advance. Here, the 
youth have begun to ﬁll their spirits, burning with the need for belief and 
Islam, with the lights of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , a Qur’anic commentary. Thus 
acquiring certain, realized belief, our young people will struggle against 
irreligion  and  communism,  and  will  on  no  account  allow  their  country 
to be sold to the enemies of Islam. If the communists, therefore, ﬁnd the 
opportunity to destroy all paper and ink, numerous youths like myself and 
older people will be ready to sacriﬁce themselves, and in order to publish 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r , a treasury of truth, would if it were possible make their 
skins into paper and blood into ink.

Yes! Yes! Yes! A thousand times!
In the indictment the prosecutor says: “ Said Nursi is poisoning the uni-

is to be found in abundance, he should send us there speedily by aeroplane! ”
When we R i s a l e - i   N u r  students suffer the persecution of tyrants for the 
sake of serving belief and Islam, we prefer to die in the corners of prison 
or  on  the  gallows  to  dying  on  the  couch  of  comfort.  We  know  it  to  be  a 
supreme divine favour to die as martyrs in the prison into which we have 
been unjustly cast because of our service to the Qur’an, rather than living 
in captivity in what is apparently freedom but in reality absolute despotism.

[ Mustafa Sungur’s Defence ]

To Afyon Criminal Court

The prosecution wants to have me punished for belonging to the society 

of Nurjus and inciting the people against the government.

F i r s t l y :  There is no society called the Nurju Society, and I belong to no 
such society. I am a member of the sacred, divine society of Islam, which 
every century for one thousand three hundred and ﬁfty years has had three 
hundred  million  members,  was  founded  by  Muhammad  ( Upon  whom  be 
blessings and peace ), the Glory of the Universe, and is vast and luminous 
and promises eternal happiness for all humankind. All thanks be to Allah, I 
am determined to obey its sacred injunctions with all my strength.

As for the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , my being a student of it is considered to be a 
crime, but it is a miracle of the Qur’an that teaches me my religious duties 
and  those  related  to  belief  and  that  Islam  is  the  highest  and  most  sacred 
religion and the sole means of happiness for humanity. It proves with bril-
liant evidences that the Qur’an is a decree of the All-Glorious One, Who is 
the Owner of all beings, is all-present and all-seeing everywhere, and under 
whose pre-eternal administration are all beings from minute particles to the 
stars and suns; it is a miraculous work whose view encompasses pre-eternity

and post-eternity and all events; it is the pre-eternal address of an Everlasting 
Sun which is superior to all other books and miraculous in forty aspects, and 
which by giving mankind the good news of eternal happiness, is the object 
of their eternal gratitude. It proves too that Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ) was sent by the Creator of the Universe, and that 
with all his conduct and practices was the most perfect, the most loyal, the 
highest of all men, whose perfections were the most elevated, and through 
the light of Islam that he brought, gave the best of all news to men, and gave 
them the most sacred consolation, and who has taken under his spiritual rule 
fourteen centuries and one ﬁfth of mankind, and to the book of whose good 
deeds pass the equivalent of all the good deeds performed for one thousand 
three hundred years by his community, and that he is the reason for the uni-
verse’s existence and is Allah’s Beloved. It proves also with brilliant proofs 
that both the hereafter, and Paradise and Hell are certain and deﬁnite.

With its words and sentences, the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  testiﬁes that it is a pre-
eternal and post-eternal light proceeding from the light of the Qur’an and the 
light of Muhammad ( UWBP ). In respect of its belonging to the Qur’an and 
being a special commentary on it, it pertains to the heavens and the divine 
throne. Thus, with all its Wo r d s ,  all its F l a s h e s  and R a y s ,  and all its L e t t e r s ,  
the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  which  is  supposed  to  be  inciting  the  people  against  the 
government, teaches the divine truths, and principles of Islam, and myster-
ies of the Qur’an. Is it a crime, then, to read the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which is thus 
elevated and worthy of veneration, and teaches good morality and virtue and 
the truths of belief, and to copy out its parts, which bestow eternal happiness, 
or to serve it so that believers may proﬁt from it with respect to their belief? 
Is that inciting the people against the government? And to visit the author 
of  such  a  blessed  and  sublime  work,  a  monument  of  light  who  is  decked 
out with the highest degree of belief, laudable morals, and virtue and is at 
the very summit of human perfections, and to be brothers on the way of the 
Qur’an and belief with the R i s a l e - i  N u r  students, who with their good works, 
veracity, and unshakeable belief this century, have defended the honour of 
Islam and truths of the Qur’an, and upheld them, and who have no aim other 
than  winning  Allah’s  pleasure  –  is  to  do  these  things  to  found  a  political 
society? Which equitable, unsullied conscience could inﬂict a punishment 
for these?

Judges of the Court! The  R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s veracity has been afﬁrmed by 
the  most  advanced  scholars,  and  with  its  gaining  for  its  readers  the  high-
est level of belief and greatest love of Islam, there is no doubt that all its 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

555

Wo r d s ,  and its F l a s h e s  and R a y s  are luminous commentaries on the Qur’an 
of Miraculous Exposition. They are all brilliant suns which dispel spiritual 
sicknesses and darkness. As is testiﬁed to by his pure and upright life, our 
Master has passed his life on the way of belief and the Qur’an, and endur-
ing every sort of difﬁculty and distress, has by disseminating the truths of 
the Qur’an worked to save the sons of this blessed nation in particular from 
the awesome attacks of communism and every sort of irreligion, and was 
charged  with  the  sacred  duty  of  writing  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   at  this  time.  He 
does not instruct us ( Allah forbid! ) in immorality and spoliation. He teaches 
us the saving of belief, the highest cause and most momentous question in 
the world of humanity. It is most certainly a divine favour that for twenty-
ﬁve to thirty years he has striven with the R i s a l e - i   N u r  to save the religious 
belief of hundreds of thousands of believers, especially by teaching belief, 
the greatest happiness in life and its most important purpose, to unfortunates 
like myself who knew nothing of Islam. We say the following to those who 
in a way diametrically opposed to reality, consider him to be harmful for the 
life of society and deny his sacred service of belief and work for religion:

If it is a crime to adhere to Allah, and obeying the injunctions of religion, 
save people from terrible calamities such as immorality and being without 
religious belief, and to make them happy with the permanent happiness of 
Islam, then he may be said to be harmful to society. It is otherwise the great-
est calumny and an unforgiveable crime. The R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s aim is not this 
world, it is the never-ending happiness of the hereafter and the pleasure of 
the Eternal Enduring One, the Compassionate One of Beauty, one shadow of 
the manifestation of Whose beauty is all the beauty and good in this world, 
and one ﬂash of whose love is Paradise together with all of its subtle won-
ders. Having a thus divine, sacred, and truly elevated aim, a thousand times 
over I declare the R i s a l e - i   N u r  to be free of all transitory things such as incit-
ing the people against the government. And we seek refuge with Allah from 
the evil of those who with slander of this sort try to crush us and prevent us 
from working for belief or from learning about religion.

Judges of the Court! As is indicated by thirty-three verses of the Qur’an, 
and pointed out by Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) and Gawth 
al-A‘zam ( May Allah be pleased with him ) and hundreds of investigative 
scholars, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is a light of the Qur’an those who adhere to which 
will save their belief, Allah willing. It most deﬁnitely cannot be extinguished 
or be lost. For example, the attacks made on it these last twenty-ﬁve years 
with the intention of eliminating it, have been the cause of its spreading and

shining out in extraordinary fashion. For its Owner is the All-Glorious Mon-
arch in Whose power and under Whose command is everything from pre- 
eternity to post-eternity. For its truths are the Qur’an’s truths, and through 
His  protection  and  grace,  Almighty  Allah  will  always  make  it  shine  out, 
Allah willing.

Judges  of  the  Court!  If  it  is  a  crime  to  read  and  write  out  the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r  -which teaches belief and Islam with the highest love and fervour, and 
recognizes  no  aim  or  purpose  other  than  divine  pleasure,  and  is  certainly 
a supreme miracle of the Qur’an this age and a luminous commentary on 
it- and to give its treatises, which teach the truths of belief, to one’s believ-

enjoined by religion, and the sacred, divine fraternity of uniting on the way 
of the Qur’an and belief for love of Allah constitute a political society, for 
me to belong to such a society is the greatest good fortune, and is a happi-

Mustafa Sungur’s Supplement for the Court of Appeal

[ Mustafa Sungur’s Supplement for the Court of Appeal ]

1. The Criminal Court: My reading the R i s a l e - i  N u r  and writing it out and 
giving a part of it to a needy believing brother so that he might beneﬁt from 
it was called “ inciting the people against the government, ” and deemed an 
offence. However, in my written objections to this charge I said: the R i s a l e - i  
N u r ,  which  is  supposed  to  incite  the  people  against  the  government,  is  a 
true Qur’anic commentary. With all its parts it teaches the truths of belief, 
and bestows the greatest happiness on those who read and write it. Its aim 
is  not  anything  transitory  such  as  inciting  the  people  against  the  govern-
ment,  the  way  of  disruptive,  immoral  layabouts;  it  is  divine  pleasure,  the 
most perfect of all happiness and good fortune. I am proud to read and write 
out the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which has gained for me the highest virtue and belief, 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

557

the  sweetest  bounty,  so  that  I  am  its  luckiest  student  and  most  powerless 
servant. Although I said that I knew to be its student was a supreme divine 
gift, and that I constantly thank my Sustainer Who granted this vast bounty 
to a wretch like myself who was not worthy of it, without basing it on any 
law or evidence, my adherence to belief and Islam was deemed a crime, and 
entirely contrary to truth and right I was punished.

2.  While  studying  in  Kastamonu  Gölköy  Institute,  I  myself  witnessed 
the irreligion taught us by some teachers. They said, Allah forbid, that the 
Prophet Muhammad ( UWBP ) had written the Qur’an, Islam was now abro-
gated,  civilization  had  advanced,  and  that  it  was  a  great  error  and  back-
wardness to follow the Qur’an this century. One day even, a teacher said 
that because Muslims performed the obligatory prayers and thought of the 
hereafter, they suffered constant distress and passed their lives unhappily; 
and that in the mosques of Islam there was a deathly atmosphere, while the 
Christian churches were always happy and full of life, and that with their 
musical  instruments  and  other  amusements,  they  enjoyed  life  and  passed 
their time happily. They tried to break the bonds with Islam and belief in our 
hearts, and instil denial and disbelief in their place.

Then if by reading several treatises from a peerless light of the Qur’an like 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  - which pours out from the Qur’an’s effulgence, and proves 
with brilliant evidences and arguments the truths of belief and Islam, and 
that the religion of Islam is a never-dying inextinguishable sun and means 
whereby humanity may attain happiness and well-being- a wretch in whom 
had been instilled the above poisonous ideas and whose spirituality they had 
wanted to kill with their noxious irreligious lessons, and had even been car-
ried away by them and ( Allah forbid ) believing in those ideas had begun to 
disseminate them - if he had come to believe in the Qur’an, would not his 
offering the endless joy and happiness he felt to the compassionate, loyal, 
and true hero Ustad Bediuzzaman, who had gained these for him through the 
blessed R i s a l e - i   N u r  he had written; would not his telling the revered Mas-
ter, who had been charged with the burdensome duty of writing the R i s a l e - i  
N u r , how it had saved him from his former life of heedlessness and misguid-
ance, leading him to belief and light, and how it was a sun of guidance and 
means of happiness for all humanity, and a divine favour for all men and 
particularly  for  believers;  and  would  not  his  calling  “ the  destruction  and 
corruption  of  a  covert  organization  of  the  Sufyan, ”  those  who  with  their 
terrible  aggressive  assaults  on  the  Qur’an  and  Islam,  as  described  above, 
were  urging  the  sons  of  this  heroic  Muslim  nation  to  embrace  irreligion, 

558

THE RAYS

and trying to raze the sacred, divine foundations of Islam, to whom millions 
of  people  are  bound  and  destroy  their  eternal  happiness  and  feeling  com-
pounded regret and disgust at the lunatics who applaud them and their base, 
aggressive, tyrannical destruction; and would not his saying to his former 
fellow students, who had fallen into doubt concerning their faith: “ Come, 
let’s give up following the lusts and whims of our souls; let’s bow before the 
truths of the Qur’an and hurry to the R i s a l e - i   N u r   m e d r e s e , the guide to hap-
piness this century. Let’s leave those lying scoundrels whom we have been 
applauding for months or years and reject the falsehoods they showed to be 
the truth, and attach ourselves to Bediuzzaman Said Nursi’s teachings and 
take them as our master. Let’s turn our backs on the darkness and embrace 
the light; ” would not these all arise from the joy he found in his belief and 
his love of the Qur’an and Islam, and from his adherence to them, and his 
devotion  to  his  nation,  and  his  desiring  everyone  to  acquire  true,  realized 
belief and attain inﬁnite happiness?

Is it a crime to attach oneself to Allah and proclaim that Islam is the lofti-
est religion and the bringer of virtue and happiness? At a time when with lies 
and slander, from every side there are overwhelming attacks on the Qur’an 
and Islam, and attempts are being made to refute the Qur’an and Muham-
mad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), which are extremely elevated, 
sacred,  and  precious,  yet  books  which  spread  irreligion  and  atheism  and 
rebellious, transient, worthless wretches who attack Islam are held in respect 
and innovations and the unlawful are applauded - at such a time is it a crime 
to believe and proclaim the sacredness and loftiness of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and 
that as a miracle of the Qur’an it is a divine light and dominical gift which 
explains and proves decisively and clearly the elevatedness, veracity, and 
sacredness  of  the  Qur’an  and  Muhammad  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace ); and both Allah’s existence and that the universe with all its beings 
and all its members and systems testiﬁes to its Creator’s necessary existence 
and unity; and because he possesses reason and can think and is the most 
comprehensive mirror of the divine names man is a sort of monarch over all 
other creatures; and that if he has a relationship with Allah through worship 
and belief and preserves himself against misguidance and vice and grievous 
sins, he becomes worthy of rising to the highest of the high, superior to all 
beings, and an esteemed guest who will be forever happy in Paradise, but if 
he denies his Creator through associating partners with Him and rebellion, 
or  through  heedlessness  and  misguidance,  he  falls  lower  than  an  animal, 
descending to the lowest of the low, coming to deserve everlasting Hell and 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

559

unending torment and torture; and that the Qur’an is the true Word of Allah, 
which is constant, and that its injunctions and commands do not, and cannot, 
change; and that mankind’s true and permanent happiness is possible only 
through following the Qur’an’s commands and adhering to them? 

It  is  not  considered  a  crime  to  read  novels  and  stories,  written  against 
Islam for ﬁve or ten minutes’ illicit pleasure, or to publish books extremely 
dangerous  and  harmful  for  the  country  and  nation,  and  to  praise  and  rec-
ommend  them,  so  can  it  be  deemed  a  crime  if  we  read  and  write  out  the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , which describes the Sun of Islam -which hundreds of millions 
of people have followed and in which they have found true happiness- or 
enumerate its elevated characteristics, which we lack the ability to praise? 
Can anyone who has an atom of belief in his heart and desires the well-being 
of the country and nation consider the above to be crimes?

Respected Judges of the Appeal Court! This case presented in your ele-
vated presence is directly the case of belief and the Qur’an. It is the case of 
the eternal happiness and salvation of millions of people. Concerned with 
this case in effect are foremost Allah’s Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ) and all the prophets ( Peace be upon them ), and all 
the saints and innumerable people of reality and believers, as well as all our 
forefathers who have departed for the eternal realm. You may now win the 
love  and  good  will,  the  prayers  and  intercession,  of  those  millions  of  the 
people of reality. The elevated reality called the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is before you. 
Is its aim the lowly, transient ranks and positions of this world, or to win 
Allah’s  pleasure,  the  greatest  happiness,  the  purest  joy,  and  highest  good 
fortune? And does it encourage people to be immoral, or does it deck them 
out with belief and the highest morality and virtue?

Before you is the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , which pours out from The Miraculous-
ness of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition and is a divine light. Since the 
greatest case facing people, more important than anything, is to win belief in 
order to be able to depart from this world for the realm of eternal happiness; 
and since through the effulgence of the Qur’an, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  teaches the 
truths of belief, and as is testiﬁed to by hundreds of thousands of people who 
have read it and written it out, and as indicated by numerous Qur’anic verses 
and Hadiths of the Prophet ( UWBP ), and Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased 
with him ) and many saints like Gawth al- A‘zam ( May Allah be pleased 
with him ), it has deﬁnitely won that case; certainly and without doubt, by 
virtue of your elevated love of truth and justice, above every sort of transient 
anxiety,  you  will  understand  and  appreciate  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s  veracious, 

560

Qur’anic face and its true value, and that its students pursue no aim other 
than Allah’s pleasure.

Judges of the Appeal Court! With his high morality, virtue and compas-
sion  our  esteemed  and  elevated  Master,  Bediuzzaman  Said  Nursi,  strives 
to save people from the dense darkness of false ideas and eternal solitary 
conﬁnement, and enduring the severest distress and torments has risen to the 
highest degree of perfection at this time being charged by Almighty Allah 
with the sacred duty of publishing the truths of the Qur’an, yet entirely con-
trarily to all truth and justice, he is cast into prison. Elderly, ill, and with no 
one,  practising  his  beliefs  and  worship  in  most  elevated  fashion,  possess-
ing  the  most  brilliant  intelligence  and  learning,  and  having  no  aim  other 
than saving the belief of people, the terrible suffering of our Master, who is 
seventy-ﬁve years old and truly loves humanity, in the intense cold of Afyon 
Prison, pierces the heart, causing the severest anguish. Trusting in your ele-
vated truth-loving justice and true philanthrophy, we await the manifestation 
of justice’s compassion.

[ Mehmed Feyzi’s Defence ]

To Afyon Criminal Court

The indictment states that I am my Master, Said Nursi’s, chief scribe, and 
am ﬁrmly attached both to himself and to the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and have served 
them, and it deems this an offence. For my part, I accept the charge with 
all my strength and am proud of it. For I have a powerful, innate yearning 
for knowledge. Evidence for this is that when during the Denizli affair my 
house was searched, it was ofﬁcially established that found in it were more 
than ﬁve hundred various scholarly books, some in Arabic. It is an unusual 
desire to study and extraordinary love of learning that made me collect these 
ﬁve hundred books, that not one person in a thousand would have at this 
time, despite my impecuniosity and young years.

Because  of  this  natural  capacity  of  mine,  I  was  searching  for  a  true 
master. Endless thanks be to Almighty Allah that He gave me what I was 
searching for afar, from close by. Yes, my Master, Said Nursi’s life testi-
ﬁes that his only aim in life has been knowlege and to learn the sciences of 
Islam.  I  have  understood  clearly  both  through  my  own  observations,  and 
from  his  published  biography,  and  from  what  I  have  learnt  from  his  old 
students, the innate love of learning that I have is found in my Master to an 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

561

extraordinary degree, so that on his own in wondrous fashion, contrarily to 
all the other m e d r e s e  teachers at this time, he has persisted in m e d r e s e  teach-
ing and endured every calamity. But then, because they did not understand 
my  Master’s  extraordinary  situation,  the  politicians  attempted  to  link  him 
with a sort of politics, with which he has no connection, even throwing him 
into prison. But later Almighty Allah made his passion for knowledge into 
a key to the Qur’an’s truths, and the R i s a l e - i   N u r  emerged, which has left 
all scholars and philosophers in amazement. Around that time, as a divine 
favour I found close by in Kastamonu the Master I had been searching for 
all my life, whose nature was similar to mine but inﬁnitely more elevated. I 
shall offer thanks for this to the end of my days.

Just as since early days, in order to preserve the dignity of learning my 
Master never accepted such things as charity and gifts, so he did not allow 
his students to accept them. He would bow before no one. In fact, not conde-
scending to crouch down in the trenches in the front lines in the War, or even 
to enter them, he preserved the dignity of learning. Similarly, heroically pre-
serving the honour of scholarship and teaching in the face of three awesome 
commanders, he was completely unmoved at their anger and silenced them. 
I therefore accepted him as my true Master, since I knew that he was some-
one who had sacriﬁced everything to preserve the high honour of this nation 
and country and the Turkish learned establishment. Even, if to suppose the 
impossible a Master so truly devoted to his country and nation had a hundred 
faults, they should be looked on tolerantly and not objected to.

A example showing that this country’s patriots in the Second Constitu-
tional  Period  and  the  nationalists  and  patriots  under  the  republic  appreci-
ated in the name of the country and nation our Master’s extraordinary serv-
ice to learning was that the Committee of Union and Progress government 
gave  nineteen  thousand  gold  liras  for  his  university  in  the  east  called  the 
Medresetü’z-Zehra.  This  was  to  be  organized  along  the  same  lines  of  al-
Azhar University. Its foundations were laid in Van Province, but it remained 
unbuilt due to the First World War. Then the ﬁrst government of the repub-
lic twenty-four years ago allotted one hundred and ﬁfty thousand liras on 
the agreement of one hundred and sixty-three deputies. Our Master’s nearly 
succeeding on his own in founding a large university similar to al-Azhar, 
which was brought into being only through the enterprise of thousands of 
teachers, shows that all patriots and lovers of their country, together with the 
teachers of the m e d r e s e s  ( religious schools ) should appreciate and applaud 
him. As for us, because we found such a Master, we decided to endure every 

562

THE RAYS

sort of hardship and difﬁculty. I have boundless respect for him as an excep-
tionally learned scholar at this time, who through the effulgence of his learn-
ing and truths of his one hundred and thirty works has caused me to advance 
on the way of belief and knowledge. Allah willing, this respect of mine will 
continue for all eternity.

There is no covert organization which exploiting religion and religious 
feelings aims to breach public security, in connection with which the pros-
ecution wants to have me convicted. Despite months of investigations and 
searches it has not been able to verify any such society, nor do we have any 
connection with such a thing. Our sole concern, within the framework of the 
laws of the republic, is for the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which has undergone the tough-
est examinations and has met with due respect from the highest committees 
of experts and has been acquitted by authorized courts of law. This is not 
treason towards the country and nation, but scholarly striving in a way that is 
directly beneﬁcial for country and nation. Other than this we have no politi-
cal aim nor any other purpose. Thus, since our innocence and sincerity are 
clear in this matter, I seek the manifestation of justice from your just court 
and my acquittal, as in Denizli Court.

To Afyon Criminal Court

Judges of the Court!
Is  it  not  the  duty  and  right  of  a  believer  to  serve  the  Qur’an  and  the 
Prophet ( UWBP ) by meeting with a scholar of religion, reading and writing 
out  his  books  about  the  truths  of  religion,  and  hastening  to  the  assistance 
of his co-religionists? Is there any law prohibiting us from this service of 
religion?  Is  it  a  crime  to  criticize  certain  aspects  of  the  atheistic  immoral 
currents of our times? We are purely a body of religiously-minded people 
which has no connection whatsoever with politics or government. To think 
well of someone and consider him worthy is a personal opinion that may be 
held by anyone. We know Bediuzzaman to be the most elevated scholar of 
religion of our times. We know him to be someone who follows reality, and 
who expresses and explains the truths of religion without toadying to any-
one. We call him a m u j a h i d  because of his service to religion and relying on 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

563

the Qur’an’s unshakeable truths, his undertaking the defence of our country 
against the currents of immorality and disbelief which threaten it. In a coun-
try in which freedom of religion and conscience are the rule, we cannot be 
held guilty of an offence because of the views we hold in the light of our 
consciences. Therefore, we are not obliged to give account to anyone.

As for the matter of the persons foretold in Hadiths to come at the end 
of  time:  we  did  not  fabricate  these.  They  have  their  origin  in  religion.  In 
a  number  of  Hadiths,  Allah’s  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace ) said that the life of his community would not exceed one thousand 
ﬁve hundred years. The major historical events up to that time, which would 
have the greatest signiﬁcance for the life of his community and for the life of 
the world, he gave news of, calling them “ the signs of the end of the world. ” 
He drew the attention of the Muslim Umma to their evil. He said that those 
who were heedless and ignorant of these evils would meet with everlasting 
misery and loss. There are innumerable religious proofs of these. We believe 
in Allah, His Messenger, and the Qur’an. So as the result of this belief and 
belief in the Messenger’s veracity, should we not strive to save ourselves 
from everlasting perdition? Should we not see what is happening around us? 
Wondering, “ Have those perilous times come? Don’t let it be us who are the 
generation that falls prey to those dangers, ” should we not point out how 
they may be applied to existent religious truths? If we disregard the positive 
evidences  before  us  and  the  proven  scholarly  truths  which  take  us  to  the 
divine existence, and supposing the irreligion of Europe to be the greatest 
means of civilization and sole mark of knowledge, we abandon our religion, 
who will save us from eternal perdition? Should we not think of this? Would 
a person of this mind who recognizes nothing superior to the Qur’an and its 
truths, throw himself into everlasting perdition out of fear of temporary pun-
ishments? Or would he attach any worth to transient values? Would he give 
up his duty of serving Allah, and His Messenger, and His religion? These 
then are the true factors tying us to Bediuzzaman. Is there any other source 
of religion that can silence the pre-eternal needs of our spirits?

The prosecutor recommends to us the thousands of Arabic books which 
ﬁll the libraries but do not interpret the spirit of today. He himself and those 
who think like him may not like the compendium of knowledge, treasury of 
freedom, and elevated reality called the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and they may criticize 
it. That is a matter for themselves. But they may not interfere in our prefer-
ring this or that work, or our attaching value to them. We like the R i s a l e - i  
N u r .  And  we  know  it  to  be  a  true,  unhypocritical  book  on  religion  and  a 

564

THE RAYS

Qur’anic commentary. Values and value judgements are questions of con-
science. No one can interfere in them. Yes, we agree that the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s 
author always teaches pure truth. The fact that he does not accept this does 
not shake our opinion. Moreover, our opinion is based not on his wonder-
working  in  the  physical  realm,  but  on  the  wonders  of  his  knowledge,  the 
extraordinary  manifestations  of  which  we  have  observed  in  his  teachings 
with  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  which  challenge  all  the  world  of  knowledge.  Can 
you show us a second Bediuzzaman who although his [ ofﬁcial ] period of 
study was no more than three months, spread such a brilliant light of knowl-
edge; and with the wonders of his learning displayed a logic so advanced in 
the ultimate questions of science that they left even the loftiest thinkers in 
amazement; and in a language he learnt only in the second part of his life had 
such a captivating style of exposition, and such a gripping ardour; who over-
ﬂows with love and passion, and is exuberant like a sea of belief, a treasury 
of divine knowledge, an ocean of wisdom?

Do you consider it excessive that we consider to be Master, the monu-
ment of virtue and light who shows not the slightest inclination towards the 
pomp  of  ﬂeeting,  superﬁcial  ostentation;  nor  stoops  to  even  the  smallest 
beneﬁt or pleasure; nor attaches any value to anyone who fawns at the feet 
of ﬂeeting ﬁlth; who awaits nothing from anyone, nor asks for it, and accepts 
nothing offered to him; who displaying the best example of the purest chas-
tity and enduring patiently, with forbearance, every sort of deprivation, has 
dedicated himself to the truth and to making known the lights of the Qur’an 
and knowledge of Muhammad ( UWBP ); and out of the abundance of his 
compassion weeps at the suffering of the country and nation; and who never 
gives up his work, which is for the happiness of those around him, despite 
all the betrayals he has suffered; and disregarding his own old age and alone-
ness, strives and battles with selﬂess, divine exertion to save people from the 
pits of ignorance and whirlpool of denial? In addition to the wonders of his 
knowledge described above, he is worthy of being known and followed as 
an example of perfection and virtue because of this matchless self-sacriﬁce, 
self-sufﬁciency, and masterpiece of chastity and moderation, which he has 
shown at this time when moral values have been lost.

That is how we look on Bediuzzaman and his works. Is it solely because 
of our attachment to him, which arises from our belief, and our belief in the 
severe rebukes and reprimands of the Qur’an and Muhammad ( UWBP ) 
concerning unbelief and morality that he has involved us in politics, which 
are deemed ﬂeeting ﬁlth? Or can it be called corruption to inform about 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY

Allah  and  His  Messenger,  the  truth  and  the  Qur’an  some  of  the  sons  of 
our compatriots who for twenty-ﬁve years have been unable to learn the 
truths  of  religion  and  are  heading  for  certain  perdition,  in  order  to  save 
them from everlasting extinction, and to reform their unsullied spirits and 
innocent consciences?

Judges of the Court! We are in no way involved in politics. We know 
that for those like us who are not versed in politics, politics is a way beset 
with a thousand and one perils, dangers, and responsibilities. In any event 
we attach no importance to ﬂeeting externals. We only look to the good 
face of the world which takes us to divine pleasure. We therefore vehe-
mently reject the charge that we pursue politics or contest the concept of 
the state. If there had been any such intention, there would have been some 
small  manifestation  of  it  in  twenty-ﬁve  years.  Yes,  we  have  a  negative 
front, a side which rebukes, turned to immorality and unbelief. This arises 
only from belief and our necessarily joining in the Qur’an’s severe expres-
sions  and  comprehensive  warnings  about  these  things.  If  these  reasons 
and this sincere, straightforward style of exposition do not convince you, 
sentence us to whatever sort of punishment you please. But do not forget 
that  Jesus  ( Upon  whom  be  peace ),  who  today  has  six  hundred  million 
followers, was sentenced to death like a common thief by the authorities 
of his time only because his heart beat for humankind’s happiness and he 
bore the trust of delivering the message.

Having spoken out freely, we shall be proud to face our conviction. With 
the cry of ( 3:173 ) Ø × Ö Õ we open our hands to the court of 
the Dispenser of Needs.

Making a mountain out of a molehill, because of my service to my Mas-
ter and the R i s a l e - i   N u r , of which I am proud, the prosecution portrays me 
as a prominent diplomat or cunning plotter. In reply to his apportioning me 
a large share of the imaginary crime with which the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is charged, 
I say this: I am closely attached to my Master, Bediuzzaman, from whom, 

566

THE RAYS

by  reading  his  works  on  religion,  belief,  and  morality,  I  have  proﬁted  to 
such an extent that I would readily sacriﬁce my life for his sake. However, 
my attachment is not as the prosecution said, harmful for the country and 
nation, in order to incite the people against the state; it is rather an unsever-
able attachment on the way of saving myself from the eternal annihilation of 
the grave, from which no one can escape, and saving the belief of my broth-
ers in religion, which, like me, they are in need of saving in these perilous 
times, correcting their conduct, and becoming useful members of the nation 
and country.

I am one of those close to him. From time to time for four years I have 
proudly attended on him. During this time, I have witnessed nothing other 
than total virtue. I have not once heard him say a single word about his being 
the Mahdi or the Regenerator of Religion. More than a hundred thousand 
copies  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   and  hundreds  of  thousands  of  pure  intentioned 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  students, who have saved their belief by reading its treatises, 
can testify that he is the very epitome of humility.

My  blessed  Master  considers  himself  to  be  a  R i s a l e - i   N u r   student  like 
us. This is what he claims. This may be seen easily in many of his letters, 
which you have in your possession, and especially in the  Tr e a t i s e   o n   S i n -
c e r i t y,  which is included in T h e   S t a f f   o f   M o s e s   C o l l e c t i o n   (   A s â - y ı   M û s a   ) . 
He repeatedly says in his letters: “ Enduring truths like the sun or diamonds 
cannot be constructed on transient persons, and transient persons cannot lay 
claim to those precious truths. ” So to accuse him of boasting and of claim-
ing to be the Mahdi and Regenerator of Religion is not something anyone 
of intelligence would do. For if you read carefully and fairly all his treatises 
and  letters,  you  will  form  the  certain  conviction  that  the  like  of  this  pro-
foundly learned scholar of the times has not been encountered for centuries. 
He is a saver of belief the like of whom will not be encountered, who at a 
time the red sparks of communism are licking the eaves of our houses is a 
patriot  far  more  useful  and  productive  for  the  country  and  nation  than  an 
army. I am regretful that I was not earlier the student of such a work and the 
esteemed Master who wrote it.

Respected Judges of the Court!
With the idea of performing a sacred service for the nation, so that like 
me the sons of this land might proﬁt from the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , whose end-
less beneﬁts I myself had experienced, I had printed  A   G u i d e   F o r   Yo u t h

and  thus  of  belief,  of  an  unfortunate  like  myself  should  have  met  with 
praise and appreciation, and encouragement, we received this severe treat-
ment? Is it not contrary to justice?

I  request  of  your  just  court  that  you  give  the  decision  for  the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r ’s freedom, for it is the sustenance of our spirits, means of our salvation, 
and key to our eternal happiness. If the circumstances, some of which I have

accept with total resignation the harshest penalty you can inﬂict.

To Afyon Criminal Court

I say in reply to the matters which have been put forward as offences, 
that I took part in the imaginary activities against the regime reputedly per-
petrated by Bediuzzaman Said Nursi, who is accused of founding a secret 
society and by exploiting religious feelings, of being engaged in activities 
that might breach state security:

1. Yes, like many R i s a l e - i   N u r  students, I began to collect the treatises of 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and to read them with the intention of receiving a civilized, 
religious education and learning Qur’anic conduct, which is a national char-
acteristic and is worthy of true Turkism and Islam, and an historical honour 
and virtue of ours. I intended to become a useful member of the country and 
nation, and defend it against the effects of foreign ideologies.

How could it be considered an offence at a time vice and immorality have 
trampled  the  honour  and  mode  of  action  of  our  forefathers,  which  found 
fame in history, and poisoned the life of society, and have spilled into the 
streets to the extent of disgusting even the immoral, alarming public opin-
ion, so that it is gossiped about in every home, and this grievous situation, 
which gives rise to criticism in the form of news about the moral police and 
of various other subjects in the newspapers and magazines, which are the 
tongue of public opinion, is rapidly spreading and quite simply becoming 
general  -  to  read  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   Collection  at  such  a  time,  which  saved 
me  as  it  saves  all  Muslims  who  read  it;  and  to  give  it  to  my  compatriots 

568

THE RAYS

when  they  insistently  asked  for  it,  who  knew  and  heard  that  I  read  these 
works,  so  that  it  could  rectify  their  morals  too;  and  so  to  save  through 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its effective teachings these people who had lost their 
moorings  and  were  becoming  harmful  for  the  country  and  nation;  and  to 
give it to them to read since it would assist them to become useful to human-
ity - how could this be considered an offence? It is the luminous, effective 
weapon of Bediuzzaman in his sacred, moral struggle, which is worthy of 
praise and appreciation. With his effective teachings about religion he is a 
m u j a h i d ,  ﬁghting against the dangerous red plague of communism which is 
spreading like an epidemic even in our country and makes the whole world 
tremble - how could it be considered a crime for myself to have given these 
treatises  to  people  when  they  have  thus  in  twenty  years  transformed  into 
useful members of the country and nation twenty thousand people, and prob-
ably more? And how could charges be made against its respected author in 
the same way? I ask your consciences.

2.  The  Hadith  which  the  prosecution  stated  was  “ false ”  and  therefore 
unscholarly, is said to be “ sound ” in the books of Hadiths. So having been 
accepted by the scholars of Hadiths, and the fact that the leading Istanbul 
scholars  both  before  the  Constitutional  Revolution  and  during  it  accepted 
Bediuzzaman’s  interpretations  and  replies,  which  are  now  found  in  the 
Fifth Ray, to the questions they asked of him in connection with the ques-
tions  asked  of  them  by  the  Japanese  and  the  Anglican  Church,  and  those 
prominent scholars did not object to his replies establishes deﬁnitely that the 
Hadith is sound.

Moreover, the truths of not a part of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , but of all of it, are 
so powerful that no true Islamic scholar could object to them, so that fore-
most the Directorate of Religious Affairs, and true scholars throughout the 
country since the Constitutional Period, have been compelled to accept and 
respect them. The objections of one or two individuals who are known as 
scholars but who are bereft of true knowledge do not refute those truths and 
powerful proofs. They are merely ridiculous. Is it a betrayal of the regime 
to write a letter of thanks to the author of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  because one is 
captivated  by  the  truths  of  the  Qur’an  and  belief  it  contains,  the  spiritual 
and material beneﬁts of which have become clear, and which are studied all 
over the country by every class of person in order to save their eternal lives 
from extinction, and from which thousands of compatriots have proﬁted and 
so are eternally indebted to their esteemed author, since he has saved their 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

569

belief; is it a betrayal, relying on the undeniable truths stated by the Hadith 
which is deemed to constitute an offence, to consider certain acts and works 
to have appeared in this country, which are referred to by the Hadith, and 
supposing it to be thus, relying on the statements of numerous Islamic schol-
ars, to see it as a victory of the Qur’an which will lead to the repairing of 
certain errors and to be pleased at this, and to privately put this view to a 
Master from whose works one has received effulgence; and to hope that the 
country and nation will not fall into anarchy and thus into the embrace of the 
Red Peril, which causes the whole world to tremble - is this a betrayal of the 
regime? Is it to malign the reforms? And although several courts of law have 
acquitted that scholar, who is utterly deserving of commendation and appre-
ciation, and although he is very elderly, a recluse, and has no one, to charge 
him with the same matters, arrest him, put him into solitary conﬁnement, 
and send him to trial, and for us too, to consider to be a crime these scholarly 
views of ours and our working to save our belief, and to put these forward as 
evidence of our supposed breaching of state security, is the just decision of 
which conscience? I ask this of your court and leave it to your consciences.
3.  The  charge  of  “ Carrying  Bediuzzaman’s  picture  as  though  it  were 
something sacred, and collecting his letters, and corresponding with him. ” 
To carry not a simple picture, but one decorated in gold and jewels, of the 
universal scholar and esteemed author who through his works has saved my 
spiritual life and eternal life from extinction, and allowed me to experience 
the pleasure and happiness of physical life, and who has saved the belief of 
thousands like me, and to send him letters and congratulate him, and to get 
to know others who love him, is my right as it is for all members of human-
ity. I do not suppose this right of mine to constitute a crime, and ﬁnally I say: 
as the police of two provinces and numerous towns can testify, in order to be 
able to serve this country, nation, and humanity, for long years the R i s a l e - i  
N u r   students  have  saved  themselves  through  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   from  being 
aimless, and have been the means of saving others. Although the patriotic 
service they have performed for this country and its government has in real-
ity been greater than a police force of thousands, and is worthy of recogni-
tion and appreciation, it has been misinterpreted and we have been arrested, 
as though deliberately on behalf of some foreign power. All our work and 
businesses have gone to rack and ruin and our wretched families and chil-
dren have been left weeping and destitute. Which laws of democracy does 
this conform to? Which just decisions of which just judges? I request from

To Afyon Criminal Court

I am charged with reading some of the works -which teach the truths of 
the Qur’an and belief and are of great beneﬁt for the nation and country- of 
the Islamic scholar Bediuzzaman, who is accused of attempting to breach 
state security by exploiting religious feelings; and with obtaining and giving 
-on request- to a number of acquaintances some of his treatises, from which 
I had greatly beneﬁted in respect of belief and religion and which had led 
me to acquire Qur’anic manners, in the hope that it would be for their good 
and  they  would  proﬁt  from  his  teachings  about  belief,  and  religious  and 
moral instruction, a national characteristic. In addition, on the pretext of a 
number of acquaintances sending letters of a friendly or scholarly nature to 
my address, it is alleged that I am a partner in the crime of the above-men-
tioned. I object as follows to these matters with which I have been charged:
1. I did not read the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , which has previously been tried and 
acquitted and returned to its author, and has been praised and recommended 
by the country’s religious scholars, with any idea of causing trouble in the 
way insisted on by the prosecution. I saw every part of it to be nothing but an 
important Qur’anic commentary which effectively teaches Islam and gives 
religious  instruction,  the  way  to  make  people  virtuous  and  advance  mor-
ally, and to save nations from falling into the abyss. Since this is the case, I 
do not suppose that to read these with the intention of study or maintaining 
my religion and belief, and to give them to others, and to obtain them for 
others, constitutes a crime. For nowhere at all has any incident harmful to 
the country and nation in which R i s a l e - i   N u r  students have taken part been 
witnessed  or  recorded  by  the  police.  In  addition,  it  is  totally  false  to  say: 
“ they  study  and  read  them  secretly ”  and  to  arouse  doubts  about  a  secret 
society.  Because,  whether  scholarly  or  political,  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students 
have no connection with any society, secret or open. In fact, several years 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY 

571

ago  the  same  charges  were  made  against  Bediuzzaman  and  many  others, 
and they were sent for trial in Denizli Criminal Court, and although all the 
parts  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   were  scrutinized  in  the  closest  detail,  they  were 
all acquitted. I do not know the extent to which the imperatives of justice 
demand putting forward as evidence for a serious crime such as breaching 
state security and betrayal of the regime, reading a work which itself and 
whose author have been acquitted, and giving it to others to read; so I refer 
it to your consciences!

2. Among the charges was my being sent, while under arrest, a treatise 
by someone I do not know from Bayezid. I have not seen this treatise. I am 
uninformed about what it contains. If it is the R i s a l e - i   N u r , I accept it. You 
ask, and I shall reply. Only, I learnt that the prosecutor mentions the Mahdi 
in the indictment, and my Master is innocent of all such accusations. Just as 
I have never heard him mention such a thing, so I have not seen it in any of 
his works. Moreover, at every opportunity he has forbidden his students to 
venerate him, exalt him, or accord him any rank, and he has rebuked those 
who  have  written  him  such  letters.  We  have  always  known  him  to  be  an 
important  scholar  who  seeks  no  rank  or  position,  and  to  be  a  precise  and 
exacting h o d j a .

I say brieﬂy in reply to the prosecution’s accusing me of being a partner 

in my Master Bediuzzaman’s imaginary crime:

The service I have performed for my Master and the R i s a l e - i  N u r , without 
having the very slightest regret, resembles a mere droplet before an ocean of 
grace and favour. Just as tiny fragments of glass are sacriﬁced on the way of 
obtaining a treasury of precious diamonds, so I am every moment ready to 
sacriﬁce my life for the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which is the means of saving my ever-
lasting life. I consider it would be a terrible betrayal of my blessed Master, 
the leading scholar of the age, and of his sole aim, belief and the Qur’an, to 
abandon the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , the innumerable beneﬁts of which, worldly and 
for the hereafter, have been established, because of temporary imprisonment 
and its unimportant hardships and so that no harm should come to our brief, 
tumultuous lives in this world, or to be indifferent towards the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
and my Master. I do not want to deviate even an iota from what he permits 
and commands.

Why does it seem excessive that despite my indigence I should be the 
student  of  a  leading  religious  scholar  who  has  formed  a  powerful  front 
against communism, which aims to scatter its poisonous microbes over our 
beautiful  land?  This  surely  proves  that  the  riches  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   far 
exceed worldly riches. Leave my Master and the R i s a l e - i   N u r  free for ever 
so they may save the belief of the Turkish youth like myself, and the young 
people may become useful members of the country. The need of us Turkish 
youth for the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is thousands of times greater than the need for air 
of someone held in close conﬁnement, and the need for light of someone 
in  pitch  blackness,  and  the  need  for  food  and  water  of  someone  parched 
with thirst and hungry in the desert, and the need for a life-saver of some-
one  drowning  in  the  sea.  It  is  therefore  not  conformable  with  the  honour 
of justice, because of the above facts, some of which I have mentioned, to 
condemn Bediuzzaman, who has won our greatest good opinion and regard, 
and to whom we are attached with unbreakable bonds, and the many unfor-

Respected Judges of the Court!
In the indictment read to me by the prosecution my service of my Master 
is cited as a serious crime. My Master came to our town in 1944 and resided 
there for four years. For forty years he has given up all the pleasures and 
comforts  of  the  world  and  worked  only  for  belief  and  Islam  and  to  save 
the  eternal  happiness  of  Muslims,  particularly  in  our  country,  on  the  way 
of belief and the hereafter. With the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s teachings on belief and 
morality, he has constructed a barrier against the noxious ideas of commu-
nism, which are causing great harm to our religion, and particularly among 
our nation, which is Muslim and Turkish. The material and spiritual harm 
it causes is excessive. He prevents too similar things harmful to the nation. 
Does my proud service on and off for three years of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and my 
Master, who is worthy of being applauded by all the scholars in the world,

constitute a crime in the view of justice? It is also shown to be a crime that 
I left being a tailor to perform that service. But if I was to sacriﬁce my very 
life for the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which is truth and reality and a true commentary on 
the Qur’an, and for my Master, should it be deemed a serious offence and 
myself be known as a traitor to my country? I ask you.

Respected Chairman of the Court! I read some parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
and I wrote some out. Endless thanks be to Almighty Allah that due to the 
yearning I had long felt for knowledge, I began to proﬁt from these treatises. 
Although I was closely concerned with them, I saw nothing in them about 
inciting  the  people  against  the  government,  or  disturbing  public  order,  or 
founding a secret society. Nor did I hear anything from my Master about 
being the Mahdi or Regenerator of Religion, or anything about such move-
ments. The sole aim of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and our Master and us students is to 
serve Islam, and particularly the Turkish nation, with respect to belief and 
morality. Certainly, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its servants should not be harassed 
because of this service. Our sole aim and purpose was this and nothing else. 
And  we  performed  this  duty  for  Allah’s  pleasure.  In  any  event  we  could 
not  exploit  such  a  sacred  duty  for  the  world  or  any  worldly  beneﬁt,  and 
would not stoop to such a thing. We therefore cannot endure the prosecu-
tion’s charges against the sincere R i s a l e - i   N u r  students, who have belief in 
their hearts, are preoccupied with the hereafter and have no worldly ambi-
tions whatsoever, of founding a secret political society, which never at any 
time occurred to us.

Respected Judges of the Court! We believe that you have understood 
the  aims,  intentions,  and  nature  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students,  and  have 
formed the opinion that we have no connection with the crimes with which 
we are charged by the prosecution. We therefore request from your high 
court and your consciences that our books are returned to us, free, and we 
are acquitted.

N u r  and my Master. Through his works, my Master saved my belief and life 
in the hereafter. His aim is to save all Muslims and all our compatriots from 
unbelief and for them to win eternal happiness. It has become clear in all our 
trials that we have no connection with any political ambitions. Although the 
reality is this, we have again unjustly and irrelevantly been dragged to court. 
We have understood from this that they want to break our solidarity. Our 
solidarity is not turned to any worldly or political end or matter. We only 
have the very greatest respect for our Master. Those who read the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  acquire an extraordinary belief, Islam, morality, and perfection.

We  are  incapable  of  not  having  enormous  love  for  our  Master.  I  am 
attached with all my being to my Master and to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students. 
This attachment could not be severed or broken even if I was executed. I and 
all my brothers are innocent. We request with all our strength that the R i s a l e -
i  N u r  is left free. I request that my elevated Master and innocent Nurju broth-
ers and myself are acquitted.

To Afyon Criminal Court

Respected Judges!
The crime with which we are charged is both irrelevant and pertains to 
the world, it is political. But you, esteemed judges, understood at ﬁrst sight 
whether or not we were people who would be involved in politics. However, 
even if hundreds of authoritative people were to ensure that this cold and 
alien  charge  was  a  hundred  per  cent  realized,  and  my  intelligence  was  a 
hundred times greater than it is, because of the feeling the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and 
its esteemed author have given me, I would ﬂee with all my being from that 
temporary, ﬂeeting political thrill and adventure, and spend it on the way of 

THE FOURTEENTH RAY

belief in the hereafter and being saved from Hell. Both our respect for and 
attachment to the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s worthy author, and reading and writing out 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and our corresponding with the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students and 
our relations with them, all look directly to the hereafter, as was afﬁrmed by 
Denizli Criminal Court and the Court of Appeal. So much so that because of 
the ideas we have acquired from the R i s a l e - i   N u r , we would not exchange 
these luminous beings for worldly and material values. We will persist in 
this belief until we die.

Respected Judges of the Court!
Since we are gathered together here due to this fearsome charge, I am 
bound by conscience and for the sake of the country to state an important 
fact: only in my own neighbourhood, due to the reform of people’s characters 
brought about by the R i s a l e - i   N u r , over a period of ten years, in full sight of 
everyone, foremost myself and many others have learnt the way home. Vice 
and waywardness have been transformed into happy family lives. Mothers 
and fathers now pray for those who were the cause of it. You may listen to 
the stories of many people of this sort, in our province and around it. Par-
ticularly in Denizli Prison, when the R i s a l e - i   N u r  entered there, it had such 
an  overwhelmingly  beneﬁcial  effect  on  the  prisoners  that  it  is  still  talked 
about. It was the same when I arrived here at Afyon Prison; whoever I spoke 
to, they described their former states and present states, and spoke gratefully 
of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students, praying for them. These facts are well-known. 
I am astonished that love for the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which has reformed me and 
my fellows to this great extent, both socially, morally, and with regard to the 
hereafter, and especially is an important Qur’anic commentary, and love for 
its esteemed author, and to write letters of consolation to my compatriots, 
could  have  been  something  political.  Out  of  this  astonishment  I  say  that 
there cannot be such a crime. At the most I can say that the covert enemies 
of the Qur’an and thus of the R i s a l e - i  N u r  have made the judiciary and police 
suspicious about us for no reason, and have thus been the cause of our pack-
ing  the  prisons.  For  sure,  the  elevated  judges  will  understand  these  facts, 
and placing their hands on their consciences will give their just decisions, 
concerning which good tidings are given by Allah Almighty, and they will 
make the Muslim Turkish nation, which throughout the country is eagerly 
awaiting their decision, grateful to them.

R i s a l e - i   N u r . But then, on the pretext of the petition I wrote to the Court of 
Appeal about being held for eleven months in total solitary conﬁnement in 
Afyon  Prison,  they  forcibly  transferred  me  to  Ward  Five  and  forbade  my 
brothers to come to me. I was feeling truly alarmed that I would be unable to 
endure the crowded conditions when suddenly as a sign of wrath and anger, 
the cold became so severe I would not have survived had I remained where 
I was before. The hardship turned into mercy for me.

It  occurred  to  me  as  I  was  reciting  the  t e s b i h a t   following  the  prayers: 
“ In all the wards the Risale-i Nur students are working as hard as they can 
at the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its lessons both on their own account and in place of 
you. But because this ﬁfth ward is somewhat isolated and is constantly being 
ﬁlled and emptied, the need here is greater for the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s instruction. 
The youths and elderly people read the newspapers, which write about the 
assaults of Russia with its awesome denial of Allah, and are therefore in far 
greater  need  of  its  deﬁnitive,  powerful  instruction  about  belief  in  Allah’s 
existence  and  unity. ”  I  was  thinking  of  writing  a  brief  summary  of  the

the  divine  necessary  existence  and  dominical  unity,  and  eleven  good  tid-
ings. According to one narration, it bears the greatest name. But then it was 
suddenly imparted to me that I should teach this concise summary to Nadir

THE FIRST PHRASE:  ُ

ّ(cid:195)ا  َ

ّ(cid:202)ِا َهٰ(cid:170)ِا  ٓ
َ(cid:202)

The proof here is the treatise called T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n   (   Â y e t ü ’ l - K ü b r a   ) , 
which has been printed. It was because it is a matchless wonder that in giv-
ing  news  of  various  parts  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  Imam  ‘Ali  ( May  Allah  be 
pleased  with  him )  said:  ِتَ(cid:107)َ(cid:159)ْ(cid:170)ا  َنِ(cid:174) يِ

Supreme Sign an intercessor, through the treatise’s victories in the courts of 
both Ankara and Denizli and its spreading effectively and secretly, it was 
both the reason for the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students being acquitted, and since its 
secret printing had led to the students’ imprisonment for nine months, it both 
clearly afﬁrmed Imam ‘Ali’s ( May Allah be pleased with him ) wondrous 
prediction, and his prayer for the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students.

ّ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174)َا ىٰرْ(cid:93)ﯭﯧْ(cid:170)ا ِةَ(cid:192)ٰ

Yes, the Seventh Ray, T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n , points out in all beings thirty-
three vast, universal, unanimous proofs. Alluding to innumerable evidences 
in each universal proof, it proves ﬁrstly that the heavens point to the Neces-
sarily  Existent  One’s  existence  and  unity  with  the  words  of  the  stars;  the 
earth with the phrases and sentences of the animals and plants; and so on, 
until the universe as a whole, with the words of all its contents and beings, 
and the truths of contingency and createdness and change – it proves them as 
clearly as sunlight and as certainly as the day. Anyone who wants unshake-
able belief and seeks an unbreakable sword to combat irreligion and anarchy 
should refer to T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n .

The Second Phrase: ‘He is One’

THE SECOND PHRASE:   ُهَدْ(cid:110)َو

A concise indication of the proof in this phrase is as follows:
In every aspect of the universe a unity, a oneness, is apparent. For exam-
ple, it displays a unity and oneness by being a well set-out city, a magniﬁ-
cent palace, a meaningful, materialized book, and an embodied Qur’an every 
verse,  and  even  every  letter  and  point  of  which,  is  miraculous.  Similarly, 
since the palace’s lamp is one and the same, and its calendar-lamp, and ﬁery 
cook, and water-bearing sponges, and hundreds of thousands of other things 
it contains are all one and the same, it proves decisively that the owner, ruler, 
scribe, and author of the palace, city, book, and mighty embodied Qur’an is 
existent, one, and single.
THE THIRD PHRASE:  ُهَ(cid:170) 

The Third Phrase: ‘He has no partner’

َك(cid:192)ِرَ(cid:130) َ(cid:202)

A brief indication of the proof in this is as follows:
The source, master, and basis of T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n  is the sublime verse:

ٰ
THE FIFTEENTH RAY – FIRST STATION

579

( 17:42 ) Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M 
which is also called T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n . That is, if Allah had any partners 
and others had intervened in creation and interfered in His dominicality, 
the  order  of  the  universe  would  have  been  spoilt.  However,  the  perfect 
order  in  everything,  small  and  large,  particular  and  universal,  from  the 
wing of the tiniest ﬂy and the cell of the pupil of the eye to the numberless 
birds which ﬂy through the air and the solar system, furnishes indubitable 
and decisive evidence for the impossibility and non-existence of any such 
partners.  It  also  testiﬁes  self-evidently  to  the  existence  and  unity  of  the 
Necessarily Existent One.
THE FOURTH PHRASE:   ُكْ(cid:171)ُ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)ا ُهَ(cid:170)

The Fourth Phrase: ‘His is the dominion’

A concise indication of the lengthy proof contained in this phrase:
We  see  that  behind  the  veil  One  of  boundless  power  and  knowledge 
makes the face of the earth into an arable ﬁeld, and every spring sows in it all 
mixed up together the seeds of a hundred thousand species of plants. Then in 
perfect order without confusing any of their crops, He raises them and with 
the hand of mercy and wisdom, out of them distributes to the two hundred 
thousand animal species their sustenance and rations according to need. He 
performs  these  acts  of  disposal  in  His  vast,  rich  dominions,  especially  on 
the face of the earth. Anyone, then, who does not recognize that All-Wise 
Disposer and Compassionate Owner is compelled to deny the earth together 
with its produce, like the foolish Sophists.
THE FIFTH PHRASE:   ُد ْ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)ا ُهَ(cid:170)َو

The Fifth Phrase: ‘His is the praise’

This  indicates  very  brieﬂy  the  very  extensive  proof  contained  in  this 

phrase:

Yes, we see with our eyes and understand clearly with our minds that the 
city of the universe, quarter of the earth, and barracks of humans and animals 
is governed, supervised, and maintained by an All-Compassionate Provider, 
a Muniﬁcent Provider of Bounties. For in order to have His bounties praised 
and thanked for, He makes the earth into a merchant ship and railway train 
bringing provender, and the spring into a waggon ﬁlled with a hundred thou-
sand sorts of foods and packets of conserves called breasts, conveying them 
to the needy living creatures whose rations have been exhausted by the end 
of winter. Anyone with an iota of intelligence would agree that this was the 
work  of  an  All-Compassionate  Provider.  While  the  person  who  does  not 
afﬁrm it and deviates into denial is a foolish, harmful animal since he is then 

580

THE RAYS

obliged to deny all the regular bounties and speciﬁc foods on the face of the 
earth, which are the cause of praise and thanks.

The Sixth Phrase: ‘He gives life’

THE SIXTH PHRASE:   ىـِ(cid:193)ْ(cid:111)ُ(cid:192)

An extremely brief allusion to the proof in this phrase:
Yes, it is proved in the Tenth Word and in other parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
that every spring on the face of the earth a glorious army is raised to life 
which consists of three hundred thousand species of living beings of inﬁ-
nite variety. With its innumerable members, all of whose lives and necessi-
ties are given them with perfect order and regularity, it displays a hundred 
thousand  samples,  indeed,  signs,  of  the  supreme  resurrection  of  the  dead. 
All those innumerable different creatures which are intermingled and mixed 
up  together,  are  raised  to  life  in  perfect  balance  and  order  without  error, 
mistake,  or  deﬁciency,  with  none  being  confused,  disarranged,  or  forgot-
ten. Those hundreds of thousands of animal species with their uncountable 
members, which all differ as regards their forms, art, and livelihoods, are 
resurrected from droplets of ﬂuid called sperm which are all similar, from 
seeds resembling earth, from tiny grains which differ little from one another, 
from the tiny eggs of ﬂies which are all similar, and the birds from the same 
air and from ﬂuid and eggs which are either the same as or only a little dif-
ferent from each other. The person, therefore, who does not conclude that it 
is an Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One, an All- Knowing, Creative Giver 
of Life Who writes out on the page of the earth and the spring a hundred 
thousand different books, all together, one within the other, without error, 
perfectly, is surely compelled to deny both himself and all the living crea-
tures throughout the earth, in all the springs attached to the string of time, 
and on the faces of the living earth and space, and must himself be the most 
foolish and wretched of living creatures.

The Seventh Phrase: ‘And deals death’

THE SEVENTH PHRASE:    ُت(cid:193) ِ(cid:175)ـُ(cid:192)َو

A very brief indication of the proof contained in this phrase:
In the autumn when the three hundred thousand species of living crea-
tures  are  being  discharged  from  their  duties  under  the  name  of  death,  the 
registers and pages of the actions of each species and all their members, and 
the indexes of all they have done, and the lists of all they will do the follow-
ing spring, and their seeds, which are spirits of a sort, are entrusted in their 
places  to  the  hand  of  wisdom  of  the  All-Glorious  Preserver.  The  person, 
therefore, who does not recognize that All-Wise Creator, the Ever-Living 

THE FIFTEENTH RAY – FIRST STATION

581

and Undying One, Who inscribes in the miniscule seeds of the ﬁg tree, each 
of which is like an immortal spirit and bears all the laws governing the tree’s 
life, the story of the tree’s life, which contains writing enough to ﬁll a book, 
thus making it like a large volume - such a person is certainly not even an 
idiot and delirious animal, but more abject than the devils who stoke the ﬁres 
of Hell, and will be condemned to eternal death.

Yes, just as it is a hundredfold impossibility and futility that the above 
universal, comprehensive, wise, purposive acts, which comprise number-
less wonders and miracles and point to the proofs of these phrases, should 
be without the one who performed them; so too, to attribute them to blind, 
impotent, unconscious, deaf, lifeless, confused, disorderly, overwhelming 
causes  is  impossible,  precluded  and  unjustiﬁable  a  thousand  times  over. 
For if that were the case, every particle of earth would have to possess an 
inﬁnite  power  and  wisdom,  and  a  wondrous,  universal  craftsmanship  so 
that it could give form to all the plants and ﬂowers; and as it says in the 
piece about the air in A   G u i d e   F o r   Yo u t h , every molecule of air would have 
to possess the ability to know all speech and all the words spoken on the 
radio and telephone, and to teach them to the other molecules. No satan 
even could make anyone accept such an extraordinary idea. The penalty 
for unbelief and denial, which is thus far from reason and reality and con-
stitutes  insult  and  aggression  against  all  beings,  could  only  be  a  terrible 
Hell, which is pure justice. We should surely declare in the face of such 
disbelievers: “ Long live Hell! ”
THE EIGHTH PHRASE:    ُتوُ(cid:175)ـَ(cid:192) َ(cid:202)  ٌ

ّىَ(cid:110) َوُ(cid:182)َو

The Eighth Phrase: ‘And He is living and dies not’

An extremely brief indication of the proof in this phrase is this:
For example, on the disappearance of the tiny suns reﬂected in the bub-
bles on the surface of a choppy sea or ﬂowing river, the bubbles that replace 
them display the same tiny suns, thus pointing to the sun in the sky and tes-
tifying to it, and with their disappearance and death they indicate the exist-
ence of a perpetual sun. Similarly, in the arable ﬁeld of minute particles, and 
in the river of time, which with its current draws all transitory beings into its 
embrace, the creatures on the surface of the constantly changing sea of the 
universe and ever-renewed, inﬁnite space continuously and speedily ﬂow on 
and depart and their apparent causes die along with them. Every day, every 
year, a universe dies and a new one replaces it. Since the crops of travel-
ling worlds and ﬂowing universes are continuously reaped from the ﬁeld of 
particles, certainly just as the bubbles and tiny suns point to a perpetual sun 

582

THE RAYS

with their passage, so the deaths of those numberless creatures and endless 
crops, and their being discharged in perfect orderliness together with their 
apparent causes, testify with the clarity and certainty of daylight, indeed, of 
the sun, to the necessary existence and being and unity of an Ever-Living 
Undying One, an Eternal Sun, an Enduring Creator, a Most Pure and Holy 
Commander.  All  beings  testify  to  this  a  thousand  times  more  clearly  and 
deﬁnitely than the existence of the universe.

Now you have certainly understood just how deaf, foolish, and offensive 
is someone who does not hear these loud voices and powerful testimonies 
that ﬁll the universe, nor heeds them.

The Ninth Phrase: ‘In His hand is all good’

THE NINTH PHRASE:   ُرْ(cid:193)َ(cid:115)ْ(cid:170)ا ِه ِدَ(cid:193)ِ(cid:92)

A brief indication of the proof contained in this phrase is as follows:
We see that each sphere of the universe, each realm of being, each level, 
each individual and member, and even each cell of each body possesses a 
store or depot containing its reserve supplies of sustenance, an arable ﬁeld or 
treasury producing and preserving all its necessities. For at exactly the right 
time, in perfect order and balance, with perfect wisdom and graciousness, all 
their necessities are given to those needy beings by a hidden hand, outside 
their power and will.

For example, mountains contain all the minerals and chemicals necessary 
for  human  beings  and  living  beings,  and  the  things  necessary  for  life;  on 
someone’s command and through his planning, they are perfect stores and 
treasuries. Similarly, through the power of an All-Wise Provider, the earth is 
an arable ﬁeld, a harvest, a kitchen, producing with perfect order and regu-
larity the sustenance of all those living beings. Even, just as human beings 
and all their bodily members have treasuries and stores, and the cells of their 
bodies have tiny depots; so it goes on, till the world of the hereafter, a store 
of which is this world; and an arable ﬁeld and store of Paradise are the world 
of Islam and true humanity, which produce the good, beauty, and lights of 
this world; and one storehouse of Hell are the ﬁlthy matters and groups of 
this  world,  which  come  from  non-  existence,  which  is  evil,  and  yield  the 
produce of evils, ugly things, and disbelief, and which pollute the worlds of 
existence, which are good. And the store of the stars’ heat is Hell, while the 
treasury of lights is a Paradise. Alluding to all those inﬁnite treasuries, the 
phrase ُرْ(cid:193)َ(cid:115)ْ(cid:170)ا ِه ِدَ(cid:193)ِ(cid:92) then, demonstrates a truly brilliant proof.

THE FIFTEENTH RAY – FIRST STATION

Yes, this phrase, together with the phrase,  ٍء ْىَ(cid:130)  ّ

ِلﯭﯦ ُد(cid:193)۪(cid:170)اَ(cid:163)َ(cid:174) ۪ه ِدَ(cid:193)ِ(cid:92) points 
out  to  anyone  not  totally  blind  an  inﬁnitely  extensive,  wondrous  proof 
of  divine  dominicality  and  unity.  For  example,  consider  only  the  follow-
ing out of those endless treasuries and stores: just as with his command of 
“ Awake! ”  and  the  key  of  His  will,  an  All-Wise  Disposer  Who  holds  the 
keys of seeds and grains, which are all tiny stores containing the members 
and destinies of huge trees or shining ﬂowers, opens up in perfect balance 
and order the minute door of a seed; so too throwing open with the key of 
the rain the treasury of the earth, without error He opens all the seeds, which 
are the tiny stores and seminal ﬂuid of plants, as well as the storehouses of 
droplets, which receive the command to develop and are the origin of ani-
mals, and the seminal ﬂuid composed of water and air of birds and ﬂying 
insects. If you want to understand and see that He opens up with the hand 
of wisdom, will, mercy, and choice, all the treasuries and depots, physical 
and  non-  physical,  universal  and  particular,  in  the  universe,  each  with  its 
particular key, consider your own heart, mind, body, stomach, and garden, 
and the spring, which is the ﬂower of the earth, and its ﬂowers and fruits, for 
they are all opened up by a hidden hand, with perfect order, balance, mercy, 
and  wisdom,  with  all  different  keys  which  come  from  the  workbench  of  
( 2:117 ) ² ± That hidden hand draws out pounds of foods from a minute 
box  weighing  less  than  an  ounce,  and  sometimes  hundreds  of  pounds, 
and presents them to living creatures as a feast. Is it at all possible that 
blind force, deaf nature, aimless chance, or lifeless, ignorant, impotent 
causes could interfere in such a boundless orderly, knowing, and percipi-
ent act, in such totally wise, purposive art in which no chance played any 
part,  in  such  error-free  perfectly  balanced  disposals,  and  in  such  com-
pletely just dominicality which is free of all tryanny? Could any being 
who does not see and administer all beings together at once, nor holds 
under his command minute particles together with the planets and stars, 
intervene in this disposal and government which is in every way wise, 
purposeful, miraculous, and balanced?

As the verse, ( 67:8 ) { z y x states, Hell rages at the person who 
does not recognize the All-Compassionate Disposer, the All-Wise Sustainer, 
in Whose hand is all good and Who holds the keys of all things, and deviates 
into denial; it boils up in fury, saying through the tongue of disposition: “ He 
deserves my boundless torments and is in no way worthy of compassion. ”

The Tenth Phrase

THE RAYS

THE TENTH PHRASE:  ٌر(cid:192) ِدَ(cid:162)  ٍء ْى َ(cid:130)  ّ

ِلﯭﯦ ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) َوُ(cid:182)َو

An extremely concise indication of the proof contained in this phrase is 

as follows:

As soon as every conscious creature who comes into this guesthouse of 
the world opens his eyes, he sees that a power holds in its grasp the whole 
universe, and within that power are a pre-eternal, all-embracing knowledge 
which never confuses anything and a most precise wisdom and favour which 
never act purposelessly or without balance. Just as, spinning a single particle 
from the army of particles like a Mevlevi dervish in ecstasy, it employs it 
in numerous duties; so at the same time and according to the same law, it 
causes the globe of the earth to travel a twenty-four thousand-year-distance 
in a year, again like an ecstatic Mevlevi. At the same time and according to 
same law, through which it sends to humans and the animals the produce of 
the seasons, it makes the sun into a shuttle or spinning-wheel, and spinning 
it ecstatically so it exerts an attraction, it employs the planets, the army of 
the solar system, in various duties in perfect order and balance. At the same 
time and according to the same law of wisdom, that same power writes one 
within the other, without error or confusion, hundreds of thousands of spe-
cies, which resemble books, on the page of the face of the earth, and displays 
thousands  of  samples  of  the  supreme  resurrection  of  the  dead.  That  same 
power at the same time transforms the page of the atmosphere into a slate 
for writing and erasing. Employing all its particles, which are like the nibs 
of  pens  or  the  points  of  the  book,  in  the  tasks  speciﬁed  for  them  by  will 
and command, it endows all of them with such ability that each receives all 
words  and  speech  as  though  it  knows  them,  and  broadcasts  them  without 
confusion. It employs each as a miniscule ear and tiny tongue, proving that 
the element of air is a throne of divine will and command.

Thus, according to this brief indication, it is one Most Merciful and Com-
passionate  Who  makes  the  universe  into  a  well-ordered  city,  a  ﬁrst-class 
apartment building and guesthouse, and a miraculous book and Qur’an, and 
holds in His grasp with the balance of knowledge and arrangements of wis-
dom all the levels, realms, and groups of creatures from the universe as a 
whole to minute particles, and disposes of them. So the person who does not 
recognize that Most Merciful and Compassionate One, Who demonstrates 
as clearly as the sun and daylight His wisdom and mercy within His power, 
and makes known His existence and unity within His absolute dominical-
ity, thus wanting recognition through belief in return for His making these 

THE FIFTEENTH RAY – FIRST STATION

585

known, and love through worship in return for His making Himself loved, 
and thanks and praise in return for His bounties - the satans in human form 
who do not recognize Him or try to love Him through worship, in fact foster 
a sort of enmity towards Him through denial, and are each minor Nimrods 
and Pharaohs, and are certainly deserving of inﬁnite torment.
THE ELEVENTH PHRASE:   ُر(cid:193) ِ(cid:135) َ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)ا ِهْ(cid:193)َ(cid:170)ِاَو

The Eleventh Phrase: ‘And to Him is your return’

This means to say: just as beings will depart for His presence, going to 
the eternal world, the hereafter, and the everlasting realm of happiness; so it 
is He who is the place of recourse of all the creatures in the universe. All the 
chains of causes are based on Him and rest on His power; they are all merely 
veils for the disposals of His power. Apparent causes are only screens for 
preserving the dignity and majesty of His sacred power; they have no effect 
whatsoever in creation. If it were not for His will and command, nothing, 
not even a particle, could move or act. A very brief indication of the proof 
contained in this phrase is as follows:

F i r s t l y :  We refer to the Tenth Word and its addenda, the Twenty-Ninth 
Word, the Seventh Topic of T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f , the Third Ray, and to the 
treatises of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  about belief, the proof, leading to completely 
certain  belief,  that  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  will  occur  and  the  hereaf-
ter  and  eternal  life  will  be  brought  about  as  indubitably  and  deﬁnitely  as 
the coming spring, as this sacred phrase states. Truly, those treatises have 
proved this pillar of belief with so many evidences that they compel even 
the most obdurate deniers to afﬁrm that the existence of the hereafter is as 
certain as the existence of this world.

S e c o n d l y :  One third of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition looks to the 
resurrection of the dead and the hereafter and it constructs all its claims on 
them. Since this is so, all the miracles and evidences proving the Qur’an’s 
veracity indicate the existence of the hereafter. Similarly, all the miracles 
bearing witness to the prophethood of Muhammad ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ), and all the evidences of his prophethood, and all the proofs 
of his truthfulness, testify also to the resurrection of the dead and the here-
after.  For  just  as  throughout  his  life,  one  of  his  most  constant  calls  con-
cerned the hereafter, so all the twenty-four thousand prophets ( Upon whom 
be peace ) taught eternal life and everlasting happiness, giving the glad tid-
ings to humankind, and proving them with innumerable miracles and certain 
evidences. Since this is so, all the miracles and evidences proving their mes-
sengership and veracity testiﬁed to the hereafter and eternal life, which was 

586

THE RAYS

their constant and most important teaching. Making an analogy with this, all 
the evidences proving the other pillars of belief testify also to the resurrec-
tion of the dead and the throwing open of the realm of bliss.

T h i r d l y :  In order to display His perfections and His power and domini-
cality, an All-Glorious Maker, a Beauteous Maker, an All-Perfect Allah cre-
ates the universe together with all its atoms, planets, parts, and levels. With 
perfect wisdom He continuously makes each being work at a task, indeed, at 
numerous tasks, and in order to display the eternal, endless manifestations 
of His names, He sends caravan after caravan, indeed, world after travelling 
renewed world, and the tribes of creatures to the guesthouse of this world 
and the arena of trial which is worldly life. He records for the cinemas of the 
hereafter set up in the World of Similitudes, with the cameras of the Interme-
diate Realm, all their images, deeds, and circumstances, and after releasing 
them from their duties, sends other tribes, caravans, and ﬂowing, travelling 
worlds to the arena in order to perform those duties and be mirrors to the 
manifestations of His names. Is it therefore at all possible that there should 
be no realm of reward and punishment, no resurrection of the dead and last 
judgement  for  men,  who  with  consciousness  and  intelligence  respond  in 
this ﬂeeting world to all the aims of the Creator, loving Him with all their 
capacity  and  making  Him  love  them;  recognizing  Him  and  making  Him 
known; beseeching with endless supplications everlasting happiness in the 
hereafter? Is it at all possible that they should suffer inﬁnite pains because of 
their intelligence and not long for eternal life, which is pure pleasure, with 
all their beings, spirits, and capacities? Allah forbid! A hundred thousand 
times, Allah forbid!

Since these brief indications are proved and explained brilliantly, power-
fully and in detail in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , we refer you to its treatises and here 
cut this long story short.

prison:

While  reciting  Sura  al-Fatiha  during  the  prayers,  it  commanded  me  to 
expound one drop from its ocean and a single ﬂash from the seven colours 
in the light of its sun. For sure we had written some very sweet and agreeable 
points from this sacred treasury in part of the Twenty-Ninth Letter, particu-
larly in the journey of imagination taken in “ the N ū n  of n a ‘ b u d u ,  ” and T h e

Filling the face of the earth, indeed, the universe, are intentional bestow-
als and bounties, which are the cause of praise and thanks, especially the 
sending of pure, clean, nutritious milk to infants from between blood and 
excrement;  so  too  are  there  purposeful  gifts  and  presents,  and  gracious 
benefactions  and  feasts.  The  price  of  these  is  to  say  ِ

' & at the end, and in the middle to perceive the bestowal in the bounty, 
and  through  it  to  recognize  your  Sustainer.  Consider  your  own  self,  your 
stomach, and your senses! How many things and bounties they need! See 
how many foods and delights they want for the price of praise and thanks, 
then  compare  all  living  creatures  with  yourself.  Thus,  the  endless  praise 
offered  verbally  and  through  tongues  of  disposition  in  response  to  these 
general bestowals shows as clearly as the sun the existence and universal 
dominicality of One Who is Worshipped and Praised, an All- Compassion-
ate Bestower of Bounties.

Second Phrase: ‘The Sustainer of All the Worlds’

SECOND PHRASE: ) (

A very short allusion to the proof contained in this phrase:
We  see  with  our  eyes  that  within  the  universe  are  not  thousands,  but 
millions of worlds, small universes, mostly one within the other. Although 
the conditions for the administration and running of these are all different, 
they  are  organized,  maintained,  and  administered  so  perfectly  that  like  a 
single page held constantly in view the universe is renewed and changed, 
and like a line, each of all those worlds is written by a pen of power and 
determining. Every instant attestations, particular and universal, are made; 
boundless, unending testimonies to the number of minute particles and the 
beings formed of them, to the necessary existence and unity of a Sustainer 
of All the Worlds Who administers these millions of worlds and travelling 
universes with an inﬁnite knowledge, wisdom, and limitless all-embracing 
mercy within an inﬁnite dominicality. Not to afﬁrm, perceive, understand or 
see a dominicality which raises and administers with the same law, the same 
dominicality, the same wisdom, all beings from the arable ﬁeld of particles 
to the solar system and the Milky Way, and from the cells of the body to the 
storehouse of the earth and to the universe in its entirety, certainly makes a 
person deserving of endless torment, and negates his worthiness to be pitied.

Third Phrase: ‘The Merciful, the Compassionate’

THIRD PHRASE:   , +

An extremely brief allusion to the proof in this phrase:
Yes, the existence and reality of a boundless mercy is as clearly apparent 
in the universe as the light of the sun. As certainly as light testiﬁes to the 
sun,  so  this  extensive  mercy  testiﬁes  to  One  Most  Merciful  and  Compas-
sionate  behind  the  veil  of  the  Unseen.  An  important  part  of  mercy  being 
sustenance, mercy is signiﬁed by the name of Provider. As for sustenance, 
it points to an All-Compassionate Provider so clearly that anyone with an 

THE FIFTEENTH RAY – FIRST STATION

589

iota of intelligence is compelled to afﬁrm Him. For example, He sends food 
to all living beings, particularly to the helpless and young, throughout the 
earth and the atmosphere, in truly wondrous fashion beyond their wills and 
power, from seeds, droplets of ﬂuid, and grains of earth which all resemble 
each  other.  He  makes  the  hen-birds  search  out  the  food  and  bring  it  their 
wingless,  frail  chicks  in  the  nests  at  the  tops  of  trees.  He  subjugates  the 
hungry lioness to her cubs, so she does not eat the meat she ﬁnds but gives 
it them. He sends the pleasant, nutritious, pure, white milk, like the water of 
Kawthar, from the springs of breasts to the infants of humans and young of 
other animals, without it being polluted by red blood and ﬁlthy excrement, 
sending also their mothers’ tenderness to assist them. Then just as in truly 
wondrous fashion He causes the appropriate sustenance to hasten to all the 
trees, which need a sort of food, so He bestows an extensive table of foods 
on the human senses, which require sustenance physical and non-physical, 
and on the mind, heart, and spirit. It is as though the universe consists of 
hundreds of thousands of laden tables of every different kind and sort, all 
enfolded  one  within  the  other  like  the  petals  of  the  rose  and  shirts  of  the 
maize cob. With a multitude of various tongues, particular and universal, to 
the number of tables and the foods they bear and their bounties, these point 
out to everyone who is not completely blind a Most Merciful Provider, an 
All-Compassionate and Muniﬁcent One.

I f   i t   i s   s a i d :  The calamities, ugliness, and evils in this world are contrary 

to that all-embracing mercy, and spoil it.

T h e   A n s w e r :  This question has been answered completely satisfactorily 
in various parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  such as the Tr e a t i s e   o n   D i v i n e   D e t e r m i n -
i n g . Referring you to them, here we make only a brief allusion, as follows:
All the elements, all the realms of beings, and all creatures, have numer-
ous duties, particular and universal, and each of those duties yields numer-
ous results and fruits. For the most part these are beneﬁcial, beautiful, good, 
and are mercy. Only a few of them encounter those lacking ability, those 
who  act  wrongly,  or  those  who  deserve  punishment  and  disciplining,  or 
those who will be the means of producing many shoots of good. An appar-
ent, minor evil is ugliness; it is apparently unkind. But if for that minor evil 
not to occur, the element and universal being is prevented by mercy from 
performing its duty, then all its other good and beautiful results would not 
come into existence. Since the non-existence of a good is evil and the spoil-
ing  of  beauty  is  ugly,  evils,  ugliness,  and  pitilessness  would  occur  to  the 
number of those results. Thus, hundreds of evil and instances of unkindness 

590

THE RAYS

would  be  perpetrated  just  so  that  one  evil  would  not  occur,  which  would 
be entirely contrary to wisdom, beneﬁt, and the mercy of dominicality. For 
example, things like snow, cold, ﬁre, and rain have hundreds of beneﬁts and 
purposes.  If  through  their  own  choice  careless  or  imprudent  people  harm 
themselves, for instance if they put their hands in the ﬁre and say there is no 
mercy in its creation, the innumerable good, beneﬁcial, merciful uses of ﬁre 
will give them the lie and hit them in the mouth.

Moreover, man’s selﬁsh desires and lowly emotions, which are blind to 
consequences,  cannot  be  the  criteria,  measure,  or  balance  of  the  laws  of 
mercy, sovereignty, and dominicality which are in force in the universe. He 
sees things according to the colour of his own mirror. A black-hearted, cruel 
person sees the universe as weeping, ugly, dark, and tyrannical. But if he 
looks through the eye of belief, he sees a macroanthropos clothed in seventy 
thousand beautiful garments one over the other, sewn of instances of mercy, 
good, and wisdom. It is always laughing, smiling with mercy like a houri of 
Paradise dressed in seventy ﬁne garments. He will observe that humankind 
within it is a miniature universe, and each individual human a microcosm. 
He will exclaim with all his heart and spirit:

S e c o n d l y :   As  is  said  at  the  end  of  the  Tenth  Word,  just  as  the  eternal 
dominicality,  mercy,  and  wisdom  of  the  universe’s  Maker,  and  His  pre-
eternal and post-eternal beauty, glory, and perfection, and His endless other 
attributes  and  hundreds  of  names  certainly  require  the  hereafter;  so  does 
the Qur’an testify to the abode of the hereafter with thousands of its verses 
and  proofs,  as  does  Muhammad  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace ) 
with  his  hundreds  of  miracles  and  evidences,  and  all  the  prophets  ( Upon 
whom be peace ) and the revealed books and scriptures, with their innumer-
able  evidences.  The  person,  therefore,  who  does  not  believe  in  the  ever-
lasting life of the hereafter casts himself into a sort of Hell in this world, 
arising from his unbelief, and suffers constant torment. As is described in

and  creatures  and  universes  continuously  rain  down  endless  pains  on  his 
spirit and heart, making him suffer the torments of Hell before going there.
T h i r d l y :  ‘The Day of Judgement’ 0 / alludes to a vast and powerful 
proof of the resurrection of the dead, but a situation has arisen here causing 
its postponement to another time. Perhaps too, no need remains for it, for 
various  parts  of  the  Risale-i  Nur  have  proved  with  hundreds  of  powerful 
arguments that the morning and spring of the resurrection of the dead and 
Great Gathering will occur as certainly as day follows night and spring fol-
lows winter.
FIFTH PHRASE:   5 4 3 2

It  occurred  to  me  that  before  pointing  out  the  proof  contained  in  this 
phrase, I should relate a true journey of the imagination which is described 
in the Twenty-Ninth Letter. It was like this:

Fifth Phrase: ‘You alone do we worship and from You alone do we seek help.’

As is explained in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and especially in the Qur’anic com-
mentary, S i g n s   o f   M i r a c u l o u s n e s s   (   I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z   )  and T h e   E i g h t   S y m b o l s  
(   R u m û z - u   S e m â n i y e   ) , one time when I was seeking out the Qur’an’s mira-
cles I found four or ﬁve miraculous predictions at the end of Sura al-Fath 
and an historical miracle in the verse: ( 10:92 )  U T S and even 
ﬂashes of miraculousness in numerous other words and sometimes miracu-
lous points in letters. Then, when reciting Sura al-Fatiha during the prayers, 
a question occurred to me in order to inform me of a miracle in the ن of ُدُ(cid:93)ْ(cid:151)َ(cid:178) 
ُن(cid:193) ِ(cid:151)َ(cid:99) ْ(cid:127)َ(cid:178)    (   [   Yo u   a l o n e   ]   d o   w e   w o r s h i p   [   a n d   f r o m   Yo u   a l o n e   ]   d o   w e  
and    
s e e k   h e l p   ) .   (1:5)

Why was it not “ You alone do I worship and from You alone do I seek 
help, ” rather than the ﬁrst person plural, that is, “ We worship You and We 
seek help from You ”? Suddenly the broad arena of a journey of the imagina-
tion opened up through the door of that “   n ū n   ”  ( we ). I understood experi-
entially the mighty mystery and vast beneﬁts of praying in congregation, and 
that this single letter is a miracle, and I actually saw this. It was as follows:

At that time while performing the prayers in Bayezid Mosque in Istanbul, 
I said: 5 4 3 2 I looked and saw that the congregation in the 
mosque was saying اَ(cid:178) ِدْ(cid:182)ِا the same as me; its members were all participat-
ing in my supplication, corroborating it. Then another veil was drawn back. 

592

THE RAYS

I saw that all the mosques in Istanbul had as though become a huge Bayezid 
Mosque. All their congregations were exclaiming: 
5 4 3 2  like  me,  setting  their  seals  on  my  assertions 
and  entreaties,  and  saying  “ Amen! ”  to  them.  Then  within  their  becom-
ing  intercessors  for  me,  a  further  veil  was  unfolded  in  my  imagination.  I 
saw that the world of Islam had assumed the form of a huge mosque, with 
Mecca and the Ka‘ba as the m i h r a b . The rows of all the Muslims perform-
ing  the  prayers  were  in  circles  facing  the  sacred  m i h r a b .  Saying  like  me 

..ﺎﹶﻧ ﹺﺪ ﹾﻫﹺﺍ  *5 4 3 2    each  was  both  supplicating  in  the  name 

of all, and testifying, and afﬁrming it; also making all the others interces-
sors  for  himself.  Then,  as  I  was  thinking:  “ What  such  a  vast  community 
claims  could  not  be  wrong  and  its  supplications  would  not  be  rejected;  it 
repulses Satanic doubts, ” and as I was afﬁrming the vast, self-evident ben-
eﬁts of performing the prayers in congregation, another veil was unfolded. 
I  saw  that  the  universe  and  all  the  varieties  of  creatures  were  as  though 
performing  the  prayers  through  the  tongues  of  their  beings  and  worship-
ping  in  a  way  particular  to  each.  Responding  with  extensive  worship  to 
the all-embracing dominicality of the Glorious All-Worshipped One, each 
group afﬁrmed the testimonies and afﬁrmation of divine unity of all the oth-
ers. While observing that this was the case since they all take up positions 
proving  the  same  result,  yet  another  veil  was  unfolded.  I  saw  that  just  as 
the  universe,  the  macroanthropos,  exclaims: 5 4 3 2  with 
the tongue of disposition, and numerous of its parts declare it through the 
tongue of capacity and innate need, and conscious beings say it verbally, all 
thus displaying their worship before the Creator’s compassionate domini-
cality; in just the same way, through the silent tongue of need and submis-
sion to their Creator’s dominicality, all the particles, powers, and senses of 
my body, like those of all my companions in that vast congregation, each 
resembling a tiny universe, declared: 5 4 3 2  In this way 
they showed that they were acting in accordance with the divine will and 
command  and  were  at  every  instant  in  need  of  their  Creator’s  grace  and 
mercy and assistance. And just as entering through the door of the ن , I had 
observed in wonderment both the sacred mystery of performing the prayers 
in congregation and the beautiful miracle of the ن , so I went out from it. 
' &  I exclaimed. Thereafter I became accustomed to reciting the verse, 

THE FIFTEENTH RAY – FIRST STATION

593

5 4 3 2  on account of those three congregations and those 
companions, great and small.

Now we have completed the introduction and come to our main topic, 

and a brief indication of the proof alluded to by 5 4 3 2
F i r s t l y :  We see with our own eyes that in the universe and especially on  
the face of the earth, within an awesome, continuous, regular activity and 
creativity,  a  compassionate,  administering  absolute  dominicality  responds 
with perfect wisdom and favour to the pleas for help and entreaties made by 
act, tongue, and state, replying actively to each. Sound intelligences and the 
eye of belief see within the appearance of this dominicality, the response of 
the manifestation of an absolute Godhead, an Object of universal worship, 
to the thousands of sorts of worship of all beings, particularly living beings, 
and the voluntary, innate worship of all the groups of humankind in all its 
varieties. All the revealed scriptures and prophets also tell of this.

S e c o n d l y :  As signiﬁed by the  ن  of 3 in the introduction above, each 
of the three congregations, and all of them, being engaged all together in their 
different, innate, voluntary worship, is without doubt a grateful response to 
a worshippedness, and a boundless, unequivocal testimony to a Most Holy 
Object of Worship. As signiﬁed by the ن of 5 the three congrega-
tions mentioned above, that is, every group and every individual from the 
totality of the universe to the congregation of the particles of a living body 
utters pleas for help and supplications both by act and state, testifying indu-
bitably to the One Who administers them compassionately and hastens to 
assist them, and replies to and accepts their entreaties. For example, as is 
said  in  the  Twenty-Third  Word,  the  acceptance  of  the  three  sorts  of  sup-
plications of all the creatures on the earth in a way which is truly wondrous 
and beyond all expectation, testiﬁes deﬁnitely to a Compassionate Sustainer 
and  Answerer  of  Prayer.  Yes,  before  our  eyes  the  supplications  of  grains 
and seeds to their Creator through the tongue of innate capacity to become 
shoots and trees, are accepted. Similarly, all living creatures seeking from 
someone  through  the  tongue  of  innate  need,  their  sustenance,  which  their 
hands  cannot  reach,  and  all  their  vital  necessities  and  desires,  which  are 
beyond their power, testiﬁes clearly to a Muniﬁcent Creator Who before our 
eyes accepts all those supplications they offer through the tongue of innate 
need, and at exactly the right time wisely makes strange, unconscious crea-
tures speedily reply to their calls for help.

THE RAYS

Sixth Phrase: ‘Guide us to the Straight Path’

Thus, as in the above two paragraphs, the acceptance of the verbal sup-
plications of all groups, especially the wondrous acceptance of the prophets’ 
( Upon  whom  be  peace )  supplications  and  those  of  the  elite,  attest  to  the 
proof of divine unity which 5 4 comprises.
SIXTH PHRASE:  9 8 7

Yes,  just  as  the  shortest  way  among  paths  leading  from  one  place  to 
another, and the shortest of lines drawn from one distant point to another, 
are  the  straightest  and  most  direct;  in  exactly  the  same  way,  the  straight-
est and most direct of spiritual paths and interior ways are the shortest and 
easiest. For example, all the comparisons in the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  between the 
ways of belief and unbelief demonstrate decisively that the way of belief and 
the afﬁrmation of divine unity is extremely short, direct, straight, and easy, 
while the ways of unbelief and denial are extremely lengthy, difﬁcult, and 
dangerous. That is to say, unbelief and the association of partners with Allah 
are not tenable in this straight, wise universe, in which everything is driven 
down the easiest and shortest path, and belief and the afﬁrmation of divine 
unity are as necessary and essential in the universe as the sun.

Also, the most comfortable, beneﬁcial, and the shortest and safest way in 
human morality and conduct is the way of the straight path and moderation.
For example, if the power of reason deviates from the wisdom of the mid-
dle way and the easy, beneﬁcial straight path, it falls into either excess and a 
pernicious wiliness, or deﬁciency and a calamitous stupidity, and is prey to 
all sorts of difﬁculties on their lengthy paths.

And if the power of anger does not follow the path of courage, which is 
the middle way, it descends into either excess and an injurious, oppressive 
fury and arrogance, or into deﬁciency and an abased, painful cowardice and 
timidity, and as the penalty for the error of deviating from the straight path, 
suffers continuous torments of the conscience.

And if the power of animal appetites strays from the safe middle way of 
chastity, it falls into either excess and a calamitous, shameful debauchery 
and immorality, or into deﬁciency and frigidity, that is, an inability to expe-
rience pleasure, and suffers the torments of that spiritual sickness.

Thus,  like  these,  in  personal  life  and  social  life,  in  all  their  ways,  the 
direct path is the easiest, shortest, and most beneﬁcial. And ways other than 
the straight path are full of troubles, and are lengthy and harmful.

Seventh Phrase: ‘The path of those whom You have blessed’

That is to say, just as 9 8 7 is a comprehensive supplica-
tion  and  wide-  reaching  worship,  so  it  indicates  a  proof  of  divine  unity, 
instruction in wisdom, and moral training.
SEVENTH PHRASE:   > = < ;

A concise indication of the proof contained in this phrase:
F i r s t l y :  The answer to the question of who > are, is the verse:
 U T S R Q P O N M 
( 4:69 )  W V
This verse lists the four classes of humankind who have received the bounty 
of  right-guidance.  That  is,  with T  it  indicates  Muhammad  ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ), who is the leader of the four classes, with 
U  Abu  Bakr  the  Veracious,  and  with V  ‘Umar,  Uthman, 
and  ‘Ali  ( May  Allah  be  pleased  with  them ).  With  these  prophecies,  that 
after  the  Prophet  Muhammad  ( UWBP )  and  after  Abu  Bakr,  both  ‘Umar, 
and ‘Uthman, and ‘Ali would be both Caliphs and martyrs, this verse dis-
plays a ﬂash of miraculousness.

S e c o n d l y :   The  truth  of  divine  unity,  which  these  most  elevated,  most 
true and rightly-guided four classes of humankind have taught with all their 
strength since the time of Adam, with innumerable proofs, miracles, won-
ders,  evidences,  and  illuminations,  and  whom  the  majority  of  humankind 
have afﬁrmed, is most certainly as deﬁnite as the sun. With their hundreds 
of thousands of miracles and proofs, these pre-eminent members of man-
kind  have  proved  their  veracity  and  truthfulness,  and  their  consensus  and 
agreement in positive matters such as divine unity and the Creator’s neces-
sary existence forms such a proof it can be in no way doubted. They are the 
straightest  and  the  most  veracious  and  veriﬁed  of  guides  and  the  leaders 
in perfection among humankind, and human beings are the most important 
results of the universe, the vicegerents of the earth, and of living creatures 
the most elevated and with the most comprehensive capacity. Those people  
therefore who do not recognize a truth upon which those four classes have 
unanimously agreed, and deny the truths in which they believed unshakea-
bly, with absolute certainty, vision of certainty, and knowledge of certainty, 
and  in  proof  of  which  they  put  forward  the  universe  together  with  all  its 
beings, such deniers surely perpetrate an inﬁnite crime and are deserving of 
inﬁnite punishment.

596

Eighth Phrase: ‘Not those who have received Your wrath nor those who have gone astray’

THE RAYS

EIGHTH PHRASE: C B A @ ? 

A concise indication of the proof contained in this phrase:
Based  on  unanimous  reports,  and  universal,  certain  events  and  obser-
vations,  human  history  and  the  sacred  revealed  scriptures  relate  in  clear, 
deﬁnite fashion how on thousands of occasions succour arrived wondrously 
from the Unseen for the prophets, the people of the straight path, and how 
what they sought was given them exactly, and how on hundreds of occasions 
wrath and heavenly blows were visited on their enemies, the deniers. This 
demonstrates conclusively and unmistakably that the universe and human-
kind  within  it  have  a  sovereign,  just,  generous,  muniﬁcent,  mighty,  sub-
jugating  Disposer  and  Sustainer  Who  in  various  historical  incidents  won-
drously  bestowed  victory  and  salvation  on  many  of  the  prophets  such  as 
Noah, Abraham, Moses, Hud, and Salih ( Upon whom be peace ), and visited 
terrible  heavenly  calamities  on  numerous  oppressors  and  deniers  like  the 
Thamud, ‘Ad, and Pharaoh, as punishment in this world too for rebellion 
against the prophets.

Since the time of Adam ( Upon whom be peace ), two mighty conﬂict-
ing currents have come down to us. One is that of the people of prophet-
hood, righteousness, and belief, who, following the straight path, receive the 
bounty of happiness in this world and the next. Since they act in accordance 
with the true beauty, order, and perfection of the universe, they both receive 
the favours of the universe’s Owner, and experience happiness in this world 
and the next. Being the means of humankind rising to the level of the angels, 
or higher, through the truths of belief they attain to a sort of Paradise in this 
world, and to bliss in the hereafter, and they cause others to win these too.

As for the second current, because it deviates from the straight path and 
through excess and deﬁciency transforms the intelligence into an instrument 
of  torture  amassing  pains,  it  casts  humanity  down  to  a  degree  lower  than 
the animals. Moreover, in addition to receiving the blows of divine wrath 
in return for their wrongdoing in this world, due to their intelligences, they 
see the universe as a place of universal mourning and as the slaughterhouse 
of living creatures toppling over in death, and as exceedingly ugly and con-
fused, thus causing their consciences to suffer a perpetual Hell in this world 
and making themselves deserving of everlasting torment in the next.

Thus,  the  verse,   C B A @ ? > = <   at  the 
end  of  Sura  al-Fatiha  informs  us  of  these  two  mighty  currents.  It  is  also 
the  source,  basis,  and  master  of  all  the  comparisons  in  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r .

Ninth Phrase: ‘Amen’

Since the treatises of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  expound this verse with hundreds of 
comparisons, we refer you to them for further explanation, and here sufﬁce 
with this brief indication.
NINTH PHRASE:   ﮱﮑ(cid:193)ِ(cid:174)ٰا

An extremely brief allusion to this:
The ن in 3 and 5  points out to us those three great congrega-
tions, particularly the congregations of those who afﬁrm divine unity in the 
mosque of the world of Islam, and especially the congregations of millions 
performing the prayers at that time, and it places us among them and opens 
the way for us to receive a share of their intercession; we too, then, through 
the word َن(cid:193)ِ(cid:174)ٰا join in the supplications of that congregation of believing wor-
shippers, afﬁrming what they say, and offering a plea that their intercession 
and  seeking  of  help  will  be  accepted.  It  transforms  our  insigniﬁcant  wor-
ship, supplications, and entreaties into universal, extensive worship, causing 
universal dominicality to respond to it. That is to say, through the mystery 
of the brotherhood of belief and Islamic unity, through the bonds of unity of 
the congregation of millions in the mosque of the Islamic world at the time 
of the prayers, and by means of spiritual radios, the  َن(cid:193)ِ(cid:174)ٰا at the end of Sura 
al-Fatiha acquires universality and may become millions of “ Amens. ” 1

1.  Thus, if, according to his degree, an ordinary man receives a tiny share like a date-
stone  of  this  sacred  truth,  a  perfected  man  who  has  advanced  spiritually  may  receive  a 
share like the palm tree. But a person who has not advanced should not intentionally recall 
these meanings while reciting the Fatiha,* lest he impairs his sense of the divine presence. 
When he advances to such a station, those meanings will anyway make themselves clear 
to him. 

* We asked our Master what was meant by “ intentionally ” in the footnote above, and 

we are writing here exactly the answer we received:

I consider that to dwell on the comprehensive, elevated meanings of the Fatiha and 
t a s h a h h u d , not intentionally but indirectly, and not in detail, which induces a sort of heed-
lessness of the divine presence, but concisely and brieﬂy, dispels heedlessness and imparts 
a brilliance to the worship and invocations. This shows up completely the high value of 
the prayers, the Fatiha, and the t a s h a h h u d . What is meant by “ not dwelling intentionally ” 
at the end of the second part, is that sometimes to ponder over the meanings themselves 
in detail causes one to forget the prayers, lessening the sense of the divine presence. But I 
feel that to dwell on them indirectly and concisely yields great beneﬁts.

So too, truths connected with the universe such as its true perfections and 
its being the enduring mirrors of an eternal Beauteous One of Glory, and the 
manifestation  of  His  names,  and  the  works  – charged  with  duties –  of  His 
wise acts, and His most meaningful missives, and its bearing an everlasting 
world,  and  its  producing  the  result  of  the  hereafter  and  an  abode  of  bliss 
for which all conscious creatures yearn, – these are all realized through the 
Muhammadan  ( UWBP )  Reality  and  his  messengership.  Since  this  is  so, 
the universe testiﬁes most powerfully and decisively to his messengership. 
Moreover,  the  messengership  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP )  and  the  Muham-
madan  Reality  give  certain  good  news  of  eternal  life,  which,  in  order  to 
be saved from non-existence, nothingness, eternal extinction, and absolute 
annihilation, foremost the world of Islam, and all mankind and all conscious 
creatures, constantly and earnestly seek, with all the powers of their com-
prehensive natures, with the tongues of all their abilities, and with all their 
supplications,  worship,  and  entreaties.  They  thus  testify  to  Muhammad’s 
(UWBP)  messengership  and  the  Muhammadan  Reality,  endorsing  that  he 
is  the  pride  of  humankind  and  the  most  noble  of  creatures.  Moreover,  in

THE RAYS

A translation of the above 1 and a brief exposition of its meaning are the 

following testimonies to the messengership of Muhammad ( UWBP ).

The First Testimony

T h e   F i r s t   is  a  proof  of  prophethood  proceeding  from  eleven  of  his 
attributes and states. Yes, his appearing -despite being unlettered- suddenly 
and  without  experience  with  a  religion  which  has  left  in  amazement  the 
learned men and philosophers of fourteen centuries and has won ﬁrst place 
among the revealed religions is an attribute without equal.

Also unequalled is the fact that Islam, which emerged from his words, 
actions, and conduct, has at all times educated and trained the spirits, souls, 
and minds of three hundred and ﬁfty million people, taking them to spiritual 
advancement.

Moreover, he appeared with such a Shari‘a that for fourteen centuries it 
has ruled with its just laws one ﬁfth of humankind, leading it to material and 
spiritual progress.

So too that Being ( UWBP ) appeared with such a faith and creed, and such 
strength of belief that all the people of reality have unanimously afﬁrmed 
that, since they receive perpetual effulgence from it, his belief was at the 
highest and strongest degree. The opposition of his innumerable opponents 
at that time not causing him the slightest anxiety, doubt, or scruple, shows 
too that the strength of his belief was without equal or like.

He also displayed such worship of Allah and servitude to Him that bring-
ing together the beginning and end of worship, imitating no one, he saw and 
conformed to the subtlest mysteries of worship, and fulﬁlled them even in 
times  of  greatest  disturbance.  This  was  an  incomparable  attribute,  as  was 
his  offering  such  prayers,  supplications  and  entreaties  to  his  Creator  that 
up to the present his degree has not been reached, even with the meeting of 
many minds. For example, in the supplication J a u s h a n   a l - K a b i r , taking as 
intercessor a thousand and one divine names, he so describes and acquaints 
his Creator that it has no like. Thus, no one has attained to his knowledge 
of Allah.

He called people to religion with such steadfastness and announced his 
prophethood  with  such  boldness  that  although  his  people,  his  uncle,  the 
great powers of the world, and the followers of the former religions were 
all opposed and hostile to him, he did not fear or hold back even a jot, but 
challenged them all and successfully accomplished his task. This too was an 
unparalleled attribute.

ﬁfteen Testimonies are in Arabic. [ Tr. ]

Thus,  these  eight  wondrous,  matchless  attributes  form  a  truly  power-
ful testimony to his veracity and prophethood. They show too that there is 
complete certainty concerning his utter seriousness, trustworthiness, verac-
ity, and truthfulness. Every day in the t a s h a h h u d  with millions of tongues 
ّ(cid:127)(cid:170)َا 
the  world  of  Islam  declares: ُهُ(cid:98)اﯬﯦَرَ(cid:92)َو  ِ
It  submits  to  the  function  with  which  he  was  charged,  and  afﬁrming  the 
good  news  of  the  eternal  happiness  which  he  brought,  it  gratefully  says: 
ّىـِ(cid:93)َ
ّ(cid:127)(cid:170)َا in the face of the sure way leading to eternal life which 
humankind  seeks  and  yearns  for  with  an  innate,  profound  longing,  thus 
meeting with him in spirit and congratulating him in the name of three hun-
dred million, indeed, thousands of millions.

That  is,  the  truths,  realities,  and  veracity  of  the  six  pillars  of  belief 
testify decisively to Muhammad’s ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 
messengership  and  veracity.  For  the  collective  personality  of  his  life  as 
Messenger and the basis of all he claimed and the essence of his prophet-
hood were those six pillars. In which case, all the evidences verifying the 
pillars  of  belief  proved  the  truth  of  Muhammad’s  ( UWBP )  messenger-
ship, and his veracity. The evidences for the hereafter of the other pillars 
of  faith  are  set  forth  in  T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f   (   M e y v e   R i s a l e s i   )   and  the 
Addenda of the Tenth Word; and all the pillars together with their proofs 
form a proof of his messengership.

of the same hand, and an entire thirsty army drinking from these and testify-

unanimous reports described in the histories, and miracles, which according 
to exacting scholars numbered around a thousand, appearing at his hand; and 
according to friend and foe alike his ﬁne attributes and good character being 
of the very highest degree; 1 and the unanimous agreement -at the degree of 
absolute certainty- of all the people of reality, who have attained to spiritual 
perfection by through following him and reached the vision of certainty in 
the realities, that Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) perfections and attainments were 
of  the  very  highest  level;  and  the  spiritual  achievements  of  the  world  of 
Islam,  which  proceeds  from  his  religion;  as  well  as  the  truths  of  mighty 
Islam - all these furnish evidence for his wondrous perfections. This surely 
means that this Being ( UWBP ) testiﬁed in most brilliant and universal fash-
ion to his own messengership.

The Fourth Testimony

The  Fourth  Testimony,  which  comprises  numerous  powerful  testi-
monies: ِهِ(cid:179)(cid:193)ِ(cid:182)اَرَ(cid:92)َو ِهِ(cid:163)ِ(cid:86)اَ(cid:163)َ(cid:110)  ْنِ(cid:174) ُ

Miraculous Exposition testiﬁes to his messengership and veracity with its 
innumerable truths and proofs.

Yes, with all its veracious truths, the Qur’an of Mighty Stature, which 
as is proved Z ü l ﬁ k â r  is miraculous in forty respects, has illumined fourteen 
centuries and governed through its unchanging laws one ﬁfth of mankind; 
and from that time to this has challenged all those who have opposed it; and 
not  even  one  of  the  suras  of  which  anyone  has  dared  to  produce  the  like 
of; and as is proved in T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n , whose six aspects are luminous 
and cannot be penetrated by doubts; and whose veracity is endorsed by six 
supreme stations; which is based on six unshakeable truths; and is eagerly 
and respectfully recited every moment by hundreds and millions of tongues, 
and is inscribed with its sacredness on the hearts of h a ﬁ z e s ; and from whose 
testimony  proceeds  all  the  testimony  and  belief  of  the  world  of  Islam; 

1.  The hero ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ), whose courage was of the very 
highest order, said: “ When we were frightened when ﬁghting in battle, we used to hide 
behind Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ). ” The histories relate how even his enemies of that 
time corroborated that all his virtues were superior, the same as his courage.

and from whose source ﬂow forth all the sciences of belief and of Islam; 
and just as it afﬁrms all the previous revealed scriptures, so is it afﬁrmed 
by them; – with all its truths and all its proofs of its veracity, the Qur’an of 
Mighty Stature testiﬁes to the truthfulness and messengership of Muham-
mad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ).

That is to say,  J a u s h a n   a l - K a b i r , which looks both explicitly and allu-
sively to a thousand and one divine names; is a wondrous supplication that 
in one respect proceeds from the Qur’an; is superior to all the other invo-
cations  recited  by  those  who  advance  in  knowledge  of  Allah;  which  was 
brought  as  revelation  by  Gabriel  during  a  military  expedition,  who  said: 
“ Cast away your armour and in its place read this  J a u s h a n !   ”  - the truths 
it  contains  and  its  perfectly  accurate  descriptions  of  the  Sustainer  testify 
to Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) messengership and veracity. So too, by proving 
rationally and logically as a single proof with its one hundred and thirty parts 
all the truths of the messengership of Muhammad ( UWBP ), and teaching 
matters which in the view of philosophy are remote from reason in the most 
reasonable and easy fashion as though they were before one’s very eyes, the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r   -which  in  one  respect  received  effulgence  from  the  J a u s h a n  
and was born of it- testiﬁes in universal fashion to Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) 
messengership and veracity.

Also, the past was a universal witness to his messengership, for numer-
ous incidents which occurred before the commencement of his prophethood 
called i r h a s a t ,  and wonders which were counted as miracles of the coming 
prophet and are related unanimously in the histories and books of biography, 
testify in authentic fashion to his messengership. These are of many differ-
ent sorts. A part of them are described in the coming Testimonies below, and 
others are related in the form of sound narrations in Z ü l ﬁ k â r  and in books 
of history.

For  example,  close  to  the  time  of  the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  birth  stones 
being rained down from the claws of the a b a b i l  birds on the heads of Abra-
ha’s soldiers who had come to destroy the Ka‘ba; and on the night of his 
birth the idols in the Ka‘ba all toppling over; and the palace of Chrosroes the 
Persian being destroyed; and the ﬁre-worshipping Zoroastrians’ ﬁre being

extinguished that night, which had been burning continuously for a thousand 
years; and on the certain reports of Bahira the Monk and Halima al-Sa‘diya, 
clouds throwing shadows around his head; numerous events like these gave 
forewarning of his prophethood before its commencement.

Also, there were very many events of differing kinds that he predicted 
would  occur  in  the  future,  that  is,  after  his  death.  Some  were  prophecies 
about his Family and Companions, and the conquests of Islam, which are 
given  in  T h e   M i r a c l e s   o f   M u h a m m a d   (   U W B P   )   in  Z ü l ﬁ k â r ,  together  with 
their authentic sources. Others were eighty accurate predictions, including 
‘Uthman ( May Allah be pleased with him ) being martyred while reading 
the  Qur’an,  Husayn  ( May  Allah  be  pleased  with  him )  being  martyred  at 
Karbala, the conquests of Syria and Iran and Istanbul, and emergence of the 
‘Abbasid dynasty, and Jenghiz and Hulagu defeating and destroying it, have 
all been described in detail on the basis of sound narrations and the books 
of history and the Prophet’s biography. This means that numerous predic-
tions of future events, and the future, which proved Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) 
veracity,  testify  also  in  powerful  and  universal  fashion  to  Muhammad’s 
messengership and its veracity.

Ibrahim  al-Dassuqi,  and  Abu’l-Hasan  al-  Shazali  all  ratiﬁed  through  their 
belief  and  testimonies  the  messengership,  veracity,  and  truthfulness  of 
Muhammad ( UWBP ).

The Tenth Testimony

The Tenth: The Companions of the Prophet, regarded as the most ele-
vated and esteemed group after the prophets, through the light of Muham-
mad ( UWBP ) came in a short time to govern with justice from east to west 
despite being illiterate nomads, and becoming advanced, educated, civilized 
masters, teachers, diplomats and just judges, they defeated world powers and 
made that century into an age of happiness. After scrutinizing every aspect 
of his conduct, because of the power of the many miracles they witnessed 
with their own eyes, they abandoned their former enmities and the ways of 
their forefathers, and many of them such as Khalid ibn al-Walid and Ikrima 
Ibn Abu Jahl gave up the tribalism of their fathers. Their embracing Islam 
in truly devoted and self-sacriﬁcing manner, and believing in Muhammad’s 
(UWBP)  veracity  and  messengership  at  the  degree  of  vision  of  certainty 
forms an unshakeable universal testimony.

The Eleventh Testimony

The Eleventh: The belief in Muhammad’s (UWBP) messengership and 
veracity in reasoned, logical manner at the degree of knowledge of certainty 
of the m u j t a h i d s , imams, and authoritative scholars, who are known as the 
puriﬁed  ones  and  veracious  ones,  and  of  the  thousands  of  investigative 
scholars such as the brilliant philosophers Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd, based on 
thousands of categorical arguments and deﬁnitive proofs, each following his 
own way, forms a testimony so universal that only one with the intelligence 
of all of them could oppose them.

One  of  those  innumerable  witnesses  at  the  present  time  is  the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r , before which the deniers have found themselves helpless, so deceiving 
the police and judiciary, have tried to silence it by means of the courts.

The Twelfth Testimony

The Twelfth: In their spiritual progress, the profoundest people of real-
ity and researchers into the realities known as spiritual poles, each of whom 
drew  into  the  circle  of  his  instruction  a  signiﬁcant  part  of  the  Umma  in 
the World of Islam, and with his wondrous guidance and wonder-working 
caused those people to advance spiritually, and whose progress was based on 
illumination and disclosing the realities in place of proofs -they saw experi-
entially through their illuminations Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) messengership 
and truthfulness and that his veracity was of the very highest degree. Their 
unanimous  and  mutually  conforming  testimony  to  his  prophethood  forms 
such a signature that no one who does not attain to a degree of perfections as 
elevated as all of them can erase it.

It is recorded with sound narrations, and in part with unanimous reports 
in the histories and books of Hadith and the Prophet’s biography that among 
the  most  prominent  and  famous  of  mankind  in  past  times,  foremost  the 
prophets and the gnostics, soothsayers, and voices from the Unseen foretold 
Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) messengership and coming unanimously, explicitly 
and repeatedly in the form of i r h a s a t . Since the most powerful and certain 
of those thousands of predictions are described in detail in T h e   M i r a c l e s   o f  
M u h a m m a d   (   U W B P   ) , we refer you to that and here only say by way of a 
brief indication: out of hundreds in the revealed scriptures of the Torah, Gos-
pels, and Psalms, brought by the prophets, twenty verses about the prophet-
hood  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP )  which  are  close  to  being  explicit  are  writ-
ten in the Nineteenth Letter (   T h e   M i r a c l e s   o f   M u h a m m a d   ( UWBP )  ) . While 
Husayn al-Jisri found a hundred verses about Muhammad’s prophethood in 
their texts, despite the numerous corruptions made by Jews and Christians, 
and wrote them in his book. 1

According  to  a  sound  narration  concerning  which  were  unanimous 
reports,  the  soothsayers,  and  foremost  Shiqq  and  Satih,  who  by  means  of 
jinns and spirit beings gave information about the Unseen and are now called 
mediums, foretold explicitly the coming of Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) and 
that he would wipe out the Persian Empire. They stated repeatedly in a way 
that could not be doubted that a prophet was shortly to appear in the Hijaz.
Similarly, Ka‘b ibn Lu’ayy, one of the Prophet’s forefathers and a gnos-
tic, and many other gnostics and the saints of that time such as the rulers 
of Yemen and Abyssinia, Sayf ibn Dhi Yazan and Tubba, foretold clearly 
Muhammad’s  ( UWBP )  messengership,  and  proclaimed  it  in  their  poetry.

The  most  important  and  certain  of  these  are  included  in  the  Nineteenth 
Letter. One of those kings even said: “ I would choose to be Muhammad’s 
( UWBP ) servant in preference to ruling this kingdom. ” Another said: “ If I 
had lived to see him, I would have been his cousin. ” That is, I would have 
been a devoted servant and minister of his like ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased 
with him ). The histories and books of biography have published all these 
prophecies,  showing  that  the  gnostics  afﬁrmed  Muhammad’s  ( UWBP ) 
messengership and veracity with a powerful, universal testimony.

Similarly, spirit beings called h ā t i f ,  which are heard but not seen, made 
predictions about Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) messengership, the same as the 
gnostics and soothsayers, foretelling his prophethood quite explicitly. Also, 
by foretelling his prophethood, many other things afﬁrmed his messenger-
ship and veracity, such as animals sacriﬁced to idols, idols, and gravestones, 
testifying through the tongue of history.

In T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n , the above is interpreted as follows:
Just as the universe points to its Maker, Writer, and Inscriber, Who cre-
ates, administers, and organizes it, and Who, decorating, determining, and 
planning it, has disposal over it as though it were a palace, a book, an exhi-
bition, or place of display; so it requires and demands an elevated herald, a 
truthful  discoverer,  an  exacting  master,  a  faithful  teacher,  who  will  know 
the divine purposes in its creation, and make them known, and will teach the 
instances of dominical wisdom in its changes, and announce the results of 
its dutiful motions, and proclaim its value and the perfections of the beings 
within it. Since this is so and it points to his existence, surely testifying in

powerful and universal fashion to the veracity of Muhammad ( Upon whom 
be  blessings  and  peace ),  who  performed  these  duties  better  than  anyone, 
and to his being the highest and most loyal ofﬁcial of its Creator, it declares: 
ّ(cid:195)ا ُلو ُ(cid:126)َر اًد َ

Yes,  through  the  light  Muhammad  ( UWBP )  brought  the  universe’s 
nature, value, and perfections, and the duties, results, and value of the beings 
within  it  and  the  fact  that  they  are  ofﬁcials,  all  became  known  and  were 
realized. From top to bottom it became divine missives full of meaning, an 
embodied dominical Qur’an, and a magniﬁcent exhibition of divine works. 
If  not  for  his  light,  it  becomes  a  mere  desolate  ruin,  confused,  a  terrible 
place of mourning, toppling over into the darknesses of non-existence, noth-
ingness,  death,  and  obliteration.  It  is  in  consequence  of  this  truth  that  the 
universe’s  perfections,  purposeful  transformations,  and  eternal  meanings 

declare in powerful fashion: ِ

Referring  details  of  this  most  extensive,  certain,  and  sacred  testimony 
to the R i s a l e - i   N u r , here we shall merely take a look at a brief and concise 
meaning of it.

Since  -in  accordance  with  the  justice  and  wisdom,  mercy,  favour,  and 
protection which we see in the regular, orderly disposals in the universe- it is 
the practice of dominicality to always protect the good and deal blows at the 
bad and liars, as demanded by the acts of His mercifulness,this world’s Dis-
poser and Administrator revealed the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition to 
Muhammad ( UWBP ); and He bestowed on him nearly a thousand miracles 
of very many sorts; and compassionately preserved him in all circumstances 
and dangerous situations, even by means of a pigeon and a spider; and gave 
him complete success in all his duties; and perpetuated his religion together 
with  all  its  truths;  and  caused  his  religion  of  Islam  to  spread  over  all  the 
earth and to all humankind; and by raising him to a position of honour above 
all  creatures  and  a  permanent  rank  of  acceptance  superior  to  all  the  pre-
eminent of humankind and, as is agreed by friend and foe alike, bestowed 
on him the highest character and qualities, and made one ﬁfth of mankind 
his community - all of which testify most decisively to his faithfulness and 
messengership; so we see from the point of view of the acts of dominicality 
that this world’s Disposer and Administrator made Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) 
messengership a sun in the universe, and as is proved in the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
caused it to dispel all kinds of darknesses and show its luminous truths, and 
make happy all conscious beings, indeed the universe, with the good news 
of eternal life; and He made his religion an index of perfections for all the 
acceptable people of worship and a sound programme for their acts of wor-
ship; and as is indicated by the Qur’an and J a u s h a n , He made Muhammad’s 
(UWBP) Reality, which is his collective personality, a comprehensive mir-
ror to the manifestations of His Godhead; and as is indicated by the above- 
mentioned truths, and by the fact that every day for fourteen centuries he has 
gained the equivalent of all the good works of all his community, and by his 
works and traces in human social and spiritual life, He made him the highest 
leader, master, and authority of humankind; and sent him to the assistance 
of humankind with sacred, sublime duties, and made men as needy for his 
religion, his Shari‘a, and the truths of Islam 1 as they are for mercy, wisdom, 

1.  In my old age and wretchedness, I perceived a millionth of the spiritual sustenance 
brought by Muhammad ( UWBP ). If I had been able, I would have thanked him by utter-
  ==
ing benedictions for him with millions of tongues. It was like this:

justice, food, air, water, and light; thus offering sacred testimony to Muham-
mad’s  ( UWBP )  messengership  with  twelve  universal,  decisive  proofs  - 
since this is so, is it at all possible that the messengership of Muhammad 
( UWBP ), which thus manifests these universal, extensive testimonies of the 
universe’s Owner, Who is not indifferent to the ordering of the wing of a ﬂy 
even or a ﬂower, should not be a Sun of the universe?

Each of these ﬁfteen Testimonies comprise numerous testimonies, and 
through  the  tongue  of  miracles  the  Second  even  comprises  thousands, 
thus proving the profession “ I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of 
Allah ” most powerfully and deﬁnitely and proclaiming its reality, value, and 
importance, so that every day ﬁve times in the t a s h a h h u d  the world of Islam 
announces it to the universe with millions of tongues. So too, thousands of 
millions of believers unhesitatingly accept and afﬁrm that the Muhammadan 
( UWBP ) Reality, which is the basis of that profession, is the original seed 
of the universe, a reason for its creation, and its most perfect fruit. And the 
universe’s  Owner  ( May  His  Glory  be  exalted )  made  that  collective  per-
sonality of Muhammad ( UWBP ) the loudest herald of the sovereignty of 
His dominicality; the accurate discloser of the talisman of the universe and 
riddle of creation; a shining exemplar of His favour and mercy; an eloquent 
tongue of His compassion and love; the most powerful bringer of the good 
tidings of everlasting life and happiness in the eternal realm; and of His mes-
sengers, His ﬁnal and greatest Prophet.

It may be seen from this what a great error, foolishness, and crime those 
people commit who do not accept a truth such as this, or attach no impor-
tance to it, and what a terrible loss they suffer.

Thus, as indicated in Part Two, Sura al-Fatiha in the ritual prayers dem-
onstrates with decisive proofs the afﬁrmation of divine unity in the profes-

[ One of the truths contained in the last verse of Sura al-Fatiha, which 
indicates the comparison of the people of guidance and the straight path 
and the people of misguidance and rebellion, and is the source of all 
the comparisons in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , is expressed also in wondrous and 
miraculous fashion by the verse of Sura al- Nur:

and a subsequent verse:

( 24:40 ) ...g f e d c b a ` _ ^ 
It is proved in the First Ray that the ﬁrst verse above, the Light Verse, 
contains  ten  allusions  to  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ;  it  miraculously  foretells  that 
Qur’anic commentary. This was the main reason the name Nur (light) was 
given to the R i s a l e - i   N u r . In a comparison in a section of the Twenty-Ninth 
Letter  describing  a  journey  of  the  imagination,  a  semantic  miracle  (b i r  
m â n e v î   m u ’ c i z e ) in the word “N u r ” in this extraordinary verse – resembling 
the miracle in the “N ū n   o f   N a ‘ b u d u ” – is elucidated. It led the traveller in 
T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n  (Â y e t ü ’ l - K ü b r a ) to question the whole universe and every 
sort of being in order to seek, ﬁnd, and learn about his Creator. He came to 
know Him through thirty-three ways and cogent proofs with the certainty 
of  knowledge  and  the  vision  of  certainty.  The  untiring,  insatiable  travel-
ler journeyed too with his mind, heart, and imagination through the centu-
ries and the levels of the heavens and earth, and seeing and inspecting the 
whole world as a city, he mounted his reason sometimes on the wisdom of 
the Qur’an, sometimes on philosophy, and gazing at the most distant levels

through the powerful telescope of imagination, he saw reality as it is, and in 
part informed us of it in T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n .

Now, of those many worlds and levels he entered on his journey of the 
imagination, which was a sort of analogy or comparison and was completely 
in conformity with reality, we shall explain by way of example only three 
levels, extremely concisely, in order to illustrate the comparison at the end 
of Sura al-Fatiha. However, this will be only from the point of view of the 
power of reason. We refer you to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  for the other observations 
and comparisons.

The First Example

The First Example is like this:

The traveller, who had come into the world solely to ﬁnd his Creator and 
become acquainted with Him, said to his reason: “ We have asked everything 
concerning our Creator and have received perfectly satisfying answers. In 
order to learn about the Sun one has to ask the Sun itself, so now we shall 
make  a  further  journey  in  order  to  ﬁnd  and  become  acquainted  with  our 
Creator through the manifestations of His sacred attributes of knowledge, 
will, and power, and through His visible works, and through the manifesta-
tions of His names. ” So he entered the world. Then the people of misguid-
ance, a second current, embarked on the ship of the earth. The traveller put 
on  the  spectacles  of  the  science  and  philosophy  that  does  not  follow  the 
wisdom of the Qur’an, and looking in accordance with the programme of the 
geography that does not read the Qur’an, saw that the earth was travelling 
seventy times faster than a cannon ball, covering a twenty-thousand- year 
distance in one year in an orbit in the midst of the inﬁnite void. It had taken 
upon itself myriad species of wretched, helpless living beings. He realized 
that if it confused its way even for a minute, or if a stray star collided with it, 
it would disintegrate, pouring all those wretched creatures into nothingness 
and non-existence. Perceiving the awesome calamity of the currents of

The  Sustainer  had  made  the  earth  an  orderly,  safe  ship,  and  ﬁlled  it  with 
living  beings  together  with  their  sustenance,  causing  it  to  journey  around 
the sun in the seas of the universe for numerous beneﬁts and instances of 
wisdom, bringing the produce of the seasons to those who wished for sus-
tenance. Two angels called Thawr and Hut had been appointed captains of 
the ship, and they took it on its voyage through the magniﬁcent dominical 
regions  for  the  enjoyment  of  the  Glorious  Creator’s  creatures  and  guests. 
The traveller understood that this showed the reality of

The Second Sample

w o r l d s :

The traveller alighted from the ship of the earth and entered the world 
of animals and men. He looked at it through the spectacles of the natural 
science that does not receive its spirit from religion, and saw that although 
those innumerable animate creatures had endless needs and were assaulted 
by numberless vexatious enemies and pitiless events, their capital was only a 
thousandth, or even a hundred thousandth of what they needed. Their power 
too was perhaps a millionth of what was necessary to combat those harmful 
things. Being connected to them through his intelligence and out of compas-
sion for his fellow beings, he so pitied them in their ghastly plight, and feel-
ing a hellish pain was so sorry and despairing, that he regretted a thousand 
times  over  his  ever  having  come  to  that  wretched  world.  Then  suddenly 
Qur’anic wisdom came to his assistance, and handing him the telescope of

the manifestation of | { z y numerous divine names such 
as Most Merciful, All- Compassionate, Provider, Bestower, Muniﬁcent, and 
Preserver, each rose like the sun in the constellations of such verses as:

They  ﬁlled  the  world  of  men  and  beasts  with  mercy  and  bounties,  trans-
forming it into a temporary Paradise. He understood that they make known

worth being gazed upon, and a thousand times he repeated:

The traveller from the world, who wanted to know his Creator through 
the manifestations of His names and attributes, turned to his mind and imag-
ination and said: “ Come! Like the spirits and angels we shall leave our bod-
ies behind and ascend to the skies. We shall question the inhabitants of the 
heavens concerning our Creator. ” His spirit mounted his imagination, and 
his mind mounted his thought, and together they rose to the heavens. They 
took astronomy as their guide, and looked with the view of the philosophy 
which does not heed religion, and the currents of  ِبو ُ(cid:139)ْ(cid:155)َ(cid:174) and َن(cid:193)ّ

them had confused its way for a second, it would have collided with another 
unconscious  globe  in  that  boundless,  empty,  inﬁnite  world,  causing  utter 
confusion and chaos, like doomsday.

Whichever  direction  he  looked,  the  traveller  was ﬁlled  with  terror  and 
bewilderment; he was sorry a thousand times over he had ascended to the 
skies. His mind and imagination went utterly to pieces. They declared: “ Our 
duty is to see and point out ﬁne truths. We resign from observing and under-
standing such infernally ugly and painful things. We do not want any such 
thing. ” Then suddenly, through the manifestation of

Referring  to  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   the  other  observations  of  the  traveller 
through the universe, which are comparable with these three examples out of 
hundreds, together with knowledge of the Necessarily Existent One through 
the manifestations of His names, here we sufﬁce with these brief indications 
and cut a long story short. Now, like the traveller through the world, we shall 
try to know the Creator of the universe through the works and manifestations 
of only three of His sacred seven attributes: knowledge, will, and power. 
For details, we refer you to the R i s a l e - i   N u r .

The  following  piece  in  Arabic  is  the  sum  and  substance  of  the  Arabic 
a l - H i z b   a l - N u r i ,  1 which I constantly recite reﬂectively. It expounds three 
of  the  thirty-three  degrees  of  the  phrase  “ Allah  is  Most  Great ”  (   A l l a h u  
A k b a r   ) . This is followed by a sort of translation of the Arabic piece, consist-
ing of brief indications, which opens up the way to acquiring belief in divine 
knowledge, will, and power at the degree of the vision of certainty through 
pointing  out  their  manifestations  in  the  universe,  a  subject  which  greatly 
preoccupied  the  scholars  of  theology  and  of  the  tenets  of  belief.  Pointing 
out the manifestations of knowledge, will, and power, the following indica-
tions thus open up the way to complete belief -at the degree of knowledge of 
certainty- in the Necessarily Existent One’s existence and unity, and to the 
afﬁrmation of that belief.

Now,  before  explaining  the  evidences  of  divine  knowledge,  we  shall 
mention brieﬂy the sacred conversation which took place during the Proph-
et’s  Ascension.  For  Muhammad’s  ( UWBP )  Ascension  indicates  and  tes-
tiﬁes  that,  through  its  manifestations  in  the  universe,  the  sacred  attribute 
of knowledge shows the Most Pure and Holy One most clearly. When on 
that night he received the divine address in Allah’s presence, since he had 
been sent as an envoy on behalf of all living beings and every sort of crea-
ture, instead of giving the greeting (   a l - s a l ā m   )  of conscious beings, he said: 
ِ(cid:193)َ
ّ(cid:143)(cid:170)َا  ُتاَوَ(cid:171) َ
ّ(cid:193) ِ(cid:111)َ
ّ(cid:99)(cid:170)َا  1 thus offering to his Creator the 
ِ(cid:195)  ُتاَ(cid:93)ّ
creatures’  gifts,  showing  the  manner  they  make  known  their  Sustainer 
through the manifestations of the attribute of knowledge. That is, with the 
ِ(cid:193)َ
ّ(cid:143)(cid:170)َا  ُتاَوَ(cid:171) َ
ّ(cid:135)(cid:170)َا  ُتاﯬﯦَراَ(cid:93)ُ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)َا  ُتاَ
ّ(cid:99)(cid:170)َا  he  was  alluding  to  the 
four  words  ُتاَ(cid:93)ّ
salutations, congratulations, worship, and recognition of the One All-Know-
ing of the Unseen of the four main groups of living beings which they offer 
through the manifestations of pre-eternal and post-eternal knowledge. For 
this reason, the recitation of this sacred conversation of the Ascension in its 
broad meaning has become an obligatory part of the t a s h a h h u d  [of the pre-
scribed prayers] for all Muslims. Referring detailed exposition of that sacred 
conversation to the R i s a l e - i   N u r , we shall explain one meaning of it in the 
form of four very brief indications.

ّ(cid:193) ِ(cid:111)َ

The First

ّ(cid:193) ِ(cid:111)َ

ِ(cid:195)  ُتاَ

T h e   F i r s t  is “ Salutations to Allah ”  ِ

ّ(cid:99)(cid:170)َا . Brieﬂy, its meaning is 
this: for example, a master craftsman invents a wonderful machine with his 
profound  knowledge  and  miraculous  intelligence,  and  everyone  who  sees 
it applauds and congratulates the craftsman, and praising and saluting him, 
offers him gifts both material and immaterial. The machine too, by display-
ing  the  craftsman’s  wondrously  subtle  art,  and  skill  and  knowledge,  and 
working perfectly in exactly the way he wanted, applauds him through the 
tongue of its being, in effect greeting him and offering him immaterial gifts. 
In  exactly  the  same  way,  all  the  species  of  living  beings  in  the  universe, 
together  with  all  their  individual  members,  are  in  every  respect  miracu-
lous, wonderful machines, which -like conscious beings, men, and jinn and 
angels, applaud and salute their Maker verbally- through the tongues of their

beings and lives applaud and salute their craftsman, the All-Glorious Maker, 
Who makes Himself known through the profound and subtle manifestations 
of His all- comprehending knowledge, which sees the relationship of eve-
rything with everything else, and knows all the things necessary for the life 
of each and conveys them to it at the right time. Greeting Him, the beings 
ّ(cid:99)(cid:170)َا They worshipfully offer the price of their lives directly 
declare: ِ
to their Creator, Who knows all creatures together with all their states. On 
the night of the Ascension, in the name of all living creatures, Muhammad 
ّ(cid:99)(cid:170)َا instead of the greeting 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) said ِ
of peace in the presence of the Necessarily Existent One, and offered the 
salutations, gifts, and greetings of all those species of living beings.

ِ(cid:195)  ُتاَ

ِ(cid:195)  ُتاَ

ّ(cid:193) ِ(cid:111)َ

ّ(cid:193) ِ(cid:111)َ

Yes,  just  as  with  its  order  and  balance,  an  ordinary  regular  machine 
undoubtedly shows a painstaking, skilful craftsman; so each of the number-
less  living  machines  which  ﬁll  the  universe  displays  a  thousand  and  one 
miracles of knowledge. Whatever the comparison between the light of the 
sun and the feeble glow of the ﬁreﬂy, that is the comparison of the former 
and the brilliance with which, through the manifestations of knowledge, the 
living beings testify to the necessary existence of their eternal Maker and 
Craftsman, and His ﬁtness to be worshipped.

The Second Sacred Word from the Ascension

T h e   S e c o n d   S a c r e d   W o r d  

f r o m  
t h e   A s c e n s i o n   is  “ blessings ” 
ُتاﯬﯦَراَ(cid:93)ُ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)َا .  Since  according  to  Hadiths,  the  prescribed  prayers  are  the 
believer’s ascension 1 and receive the manifestation of the supreme Ascen-
sion; and since the traveller found in every world his Creator, the One Know-
ing of the Unseen, through His attribute of knowledge; accompanying the 
traveller, we shall enter the broad world of blessed things and  ُتاﯬﯦَراَ(cid:93)ُ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)َا 
which make those who behold them declare: “ How great are Allah’s bless-
ings! ” Like the traveller, we shall behold that world of “ blessed beings ” and 
foremost the innocent, blessed infants of beings with spirits, and the seeds of 
animate creatures, which are the tiny containers of the programmes of their 
lives, and through studying them shall attempt to know our Creator with the

treasuries and boxes, -both altogether and singly- suddenly awaken and stir 
into motion, and proceed towards the aim of their creation. They cause those 
who see them as they are in reality to exclaim: “ May Allah bless these a 
thousand times over! What endless wonders Allah has willed! ”

For  example,  all  seeds,  eggs,  sperm,  and  grains  have  a  precise  order 
which springs from knowledge; and the order is within a perfect balance, 
which arises from skill; and the balance is within a constant reordering, and 
the reordering is within a constant measuring and balancing; and the measur-
ing and balancing are within a distinguishing and nurturing, each possessing 
marks intentionally distinguishing it from its fellows; and this distinguishing 
and nurturing are within an artful decorating and adorning; and this adorning 
is within the giving of wise, appropriate, perfect forms and members; and 
this giving of form is together with differences in the ﬂesh and edible parts 
of  those  creatures  and  fruits,  for  the  purpose  of  generously  gratifying  the 
tastes of those desiring sustenance; and this is within miraculous embroider-
ies and adornments which reﬂect knowledge and are all different; and this 
is  together  with  pleasing  smells  and  delicious  tastes  which  are  all  differ-
ent. Thus, through the unfolding and development of all these forms with 
perfect orderliness and distinction, and while being different, without fault 
or error in absolute profusion, and with absolute speed and over an inﬁnite 
area, and with this wondrous situation continuing throughout the seasons; 
all those blessed beings, singly and all together, demonstrate visibly through 
the  above  ﬁfteen  tongues  the  marvels  of  their  Craftsman’s  skills  and  His 
miraculous  knowledge,  making  known  as  clearly  as  the  sun  the  One  All-
Knowing of the Unseen, their Necessarily Existent Maker. It was because of 
this truly brilliant and extensive testimony of theirs and congratulations of 
their Maker, that on the night of the Ascension when speaking on behalf of 
all creatures, Muhammad ( UWBP ) used the word  ُتاﯬﯦَراَ(cid:93)ُ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)َا instead of 
the greeting of peace.

The Third Word

T h e   T h i r d   W o r d   is  “ benedictions ”  ُتاَوَ(cid:171) َ

ّ(cid:135)(cid:170)َا .  This  sacred  word,  which 
was spoken during the supreme Ascension of Muhammad ( UWBP ), hun-
dreds  of  millions  of  believers  offer  to  the  divine  court  every  day  at  least 
ten  times  in  the  t a s h a h h u d   during  the  obligatory  prayers,  which  are  the 
believers’ ascension. They proclaim it to the universe. Since all the truths 
of the Ascension have been proved in the Thirty-First Word in most power-
ful and decisive fashion, even to obdurate, atheist deniers, which it in part 
addresses, for the proofs and details we refer you to that Word, and here,

extremely concisely, we shall take a look at the strange world of the various 
sorts of sentient beings and beings with spirits, which illustrates the broad 
meaning of this third word of the Ascension. We shall also try to understand 
by  means  of  the  manifestation  of  His  pre-eternal  knowledge,  the  perfect 
mercy and compassion of our Creator, and the vastness of His power and 
all-encompassing will, within His existence and unity.

Yes, we see in this world that even if not consciously and with their minds, 
by nature all beings with spirits feel and perceive that despite their bound-
less  impotence  and  weakness,  they  have  innumerable  enemies  and  things 
detrimental to them, and despite their inﬁnite want and need, they have end-
less needs and desires. Since their power and capital are insufﬁcient to meet 
even a thousandth of these, they cry out and weep with all their strength, and 
by their nature implore and entreat. Each with its own particular voice and 
tongue offers supplications, entreaties, prayers of a sort, and benedictions 
to One All-Knowing and All-Powerful. Then while seeking refuge at His 
court, we see that suddenly One All-Wise and Powerful Who is absolutely 
knowing and perceives all the needs of those crying out, understands their 
plaints and plight, and hears their innate petitions and supplications, comes 
to their assistance and does all that they wish. He transforms their weeping 
into smiles and their cries into thanks. This wise, knowing, compassionate 
assistance makes known in truly brilliant fashion through the manifestations 
of knowledge and mercy, an Assisting Answerer of Prayer, a Muniﬁcent and 
Compassionate  One.  During  the  Supreme  Ascension,  Muhammad  ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ), and during the prayers, the lesser ascension, 
ّ(cid:135)(cid:170)َا  which  has  the  meaning  of 
his  community,  all  declare  ِ

beautify the universe. They look to the world of beauties, and understand 
fully the inﬁnite beauties of the eternal Absolutely Beauteous One and the 
perpetual beauties of His names, which adorn the universe, and they respond 
to  them  with  passion  and  ardour  and  universal  worship.  This  word  refers 
to the endless good words they utter to their Creator through the fragrant 
odours of their shining belief, extensive knowledge of Him, and praise and 
laudation. Since good words in this meaning were spoken during the Ascen-
sion, every day without wearying the whole Umma repeats that sacred word 
in the t a s h a h h u d .

Yes, the universe is the mirror of an inﬁnite, sempiternal beauty and love-
liness, and consists of manifestations of it. All the beauties and perfections 
of the universe come from that eternal beauty and become beautiful through 
their connection with it, and increase in value. The universe would other-
wise be a ruin, a house of sorrows, a place of utter confusion. Their connec-
tion with that beauty is understood through the knowledge and afﬁrmation 
of men, angels, and spirit beings, who are the heralds and announcers of the 
sovereignty of the Godhead. It was even imparted to me that there is a strong 
possibility that in order to broadcast everywhere the beautiful, sweet praise 
and laudation of those heralds and their extolling the One they worship, and 
to send them up to the sublime throne and present those good words at the 
divine court, the element of the air has been given a truly strange and won-
drous state whereby its particles, like soldiers under orders, are miniscule 
tongues and ears.

Thus, just as through their belief and their worship, men and the angels 
make  known  the  All-  Glorious  All-Worshipped  One;  so  through  making 
each  of  those  announcers  a  microcosm  connected  to  the  whole  universe 
through the comprehensive capacities, wondrous faculties, and subtleties of 
knowledge He has given them, that All-Glorious and Wise One makes Him-
self known in brilliant fashion. For example, He shows Himself as clearly 
as the sun by creating numerous wonderful machines in a space the size of a 
walnut in man’s tiny head such as his faculties of memory, imagination, and 
thought, and by making his memory into a large library. 1

The attribute of will; one universal proof of this

We shall now allude to a very brief meaning of the Arabic piece men-
tioned above which points out universal proofs of all-encompassing knowl-
edge,  comprises  innumerable  proofs,  bringing  them  together  and  making 
them  one  extensive  proof,  and  demonstrates  all-encompassing  knowledge 
through ﬁfteen evidences. We shall give a sort of translation of the piece.

ْ(cid:202)اَ(cid:158)

The Second Evidence: “ And regular balance ”

The  measured  regularity  and  balanced  order  observed  in  all  creatures 
testify  to  an  all-  encompassing  knowledge.  Yes,  there  being  in  all  things 
-from the universe, which resembles an orderly palace, and the solar system, 
and the page of the air, whose particles display an astonishing order in the 
broadcasting of words and sounds, and the face of the earth, which every 
spring with perfect order and regularity raises three hundred thousand dif-
ferent  species,  to  the  members,  cells,  particles,  and  bodily  systems  of  all 
living beings- a balanced order and perfect regularity, which are the works 
of a profound, comprehensive, unfailing knowledge, means that they testify 
in extremely clear and decisive manner to an all-encompassing knowledge.
The Second Evidence: ُةَ(cid:174)وُ(cid:147)ْ(cid:179) َ(cid:175)ـْ(cid:170)ا  ُتاَ(cid:178)اَزّ
ْ(cid:202)اَو
ِ(cid:98)ِ
In all the creatures in the universe, particular, universal, from the planets 
to the red and white corpuscles in blood, in everything, there is an exceed-
ingly  orderly  measure  and  appropriate  balance  which  point  self-evidently 
to an all-encompassing knowledge and testify to it decisively. Yes, we see 
for instance that the members and bodily systems of a ﬂy or human being, 
and even the cells of the body and red and white corpuscles in the blood, are 
placed with so sensitive a balance and ﬁne a measure, and they are so ﬁt-
ting and suitable for each other, and their mutual proportion with the other 
members of the body is so orderly, and they are in such harmony with them, 
that it is in no way possible that one lacking inﬁnite knowledge could have 
given them those situations.

Similarly, a balance so perfect and measure so regular and unfailing gov-
ern in all living creatures and sorts of creatures from minute particles to the 
planets of the solar system that they prove conclusively an all-encompassing 
knowledge  and  testify  to  it  with  complete  clarity.  This  means  that  all  the 
evidences  for  knowledge  are  evidences  also  for  the  existence  of  the  All-
Knowing  One.  Since  it  is  impossible  and  precluded  that  there  should  be 
an attribute without the one it qualiﬁes, all the proofs of knowledge form 
a powerful and completely certain supreme proof of the Pre- Eternal All-
Knowing One’s necessary existence.

and all species of creatures have functions, uses, and purposes which are so 
intentional  and  knowing  that  they  leave  no  room  for  chance.  We  see  that 
with respect to creation one who does not possess all-encompassing knowl-
edge could in no way lay claim to any of them. For example, although it is 
only a piece of ﬂesh, together with its two main functions, the tongue, which 
is one of the hundred human members – human beings being only one of 
innumerable  animate  creatures-  is  the  means  to  hundreds  of  instances  of 
wisdom, results, fruits, and uses. Its functions of tasting foods, recognizing 
all  their  different  savours,  informing  the  body  and  the  stomach,  being  an 
exacting inspector of the kitchens of divine mercy, and an accurate inter-
preter and telephone exchange for the heart, spirit, and mind in the function 
of speech all point in most brilliant and decisive manner to all-encompass-
ing knowledge. If through its purposes and fruits a single tongue furnishes 
such evidence, innumerable tongues and innumerable living beings, inﬁnite 
creatures, point to and testify to an inﬁnite knowledge with the clarity and 
certainty of the noonday sun. They proclaim that there is nothing at all out-
side the bounds of the knowledge of the One All Knowing of the Unseen, or 
outside His wisdom and will.

The  favours  and  instances  of  compassion  and  protection  bestowed  on 
all living creatures in the world of conscious beings, on every species and 
individual,  particularly  and  appropriately,  point  self-evidently  to  an  all-
encompassing knowledge, and offer innumerable testimonies to the neces-
sary  existence  of  One  Gracious  and  All-Knowing  Who  knows  those  who 
receive the favours and their needs.

The Fourth Evidence: “ And all-embracing, particular favours ”

NOTE: The explanation of the words of the Arabic piece, which is the 
summary  and  essence  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  indicates  the  truths  which 
the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  -being distilled from the Qur’an- has taken from the 
ﬂashes of Qur’anic verses, and particularly the proofs and evidences for 
knowledge, will, and power. For the R i s a l e - i   N u r  expounds the schol-
arly  proofs  which  the  Arabic  words  indicate.  This  means  that  rather 
than being elucidations, explanations, and translations of those Arabic 
words, each of these scholarly proofs explains an indication and ﬁne 
point made by numerous Qur’anic verses.

To return to our main question. Yes, with our own eyes we see that there 
is an All-Knowing and Compassionate One Who knows us and all beings 
with spirits, and knowing them, protects them, and knows all their needs and

plaints, and knowing them comes to their assistance with His favours. One 
out of numberless examples: the general and particular favours bestowed on 
human beings as sustenance, medicines, and the minerals they need point 
most  clearly  to  an  all-encompassing  knowledge,  offering  testimonies  to  a 
Most Merciful and Compassionate One to the number of foods, medicines, 
and  minerals.  Yes,  wise  and  purposive  works  like  the  feeding  of  human 
beings,  and  particularly  of  the  helpless  and  infants,  and  especially  their 
conveying from the kitchen of the stomach the nutrients necessary for all 
their  members  and  even  their  cells,  and  the  mountains  being  pharmacies 
and stores of all the minerals necessary for them, could only occur through 
an all-encompassing knowledge. Aimless chance, blind force, deaf nature, 
and  lifeless,  unconscious  causes  and  the  simple,  overwhelming  elements 
could in no way interfere in this feeding, administering, preservation, and 
planning, which is knowing, percipient, wise, compassionate, and gracious. 
Apparent causes such as those are merely employed and utilized within the 
bounds of the knowledge and wisdom of One possessing absolute knowl-
edge, and at His command and with His permission, as a veil to the dignity 
of divine power.

The Fifth and Sixth Evidences

The  forms  and  proportions  of  all  things,  particularly  plants,  trees,  ani-
mals,  and  men  have  been  cut  out  with  skilful  art  according  to  the  princi-
ples  of  divine  decree  and  determining,  which  are  two  sorts  of  pre-eternal 
knowledge, sewn in a way entirely appropriate to the stature of each, and 
clothed  on  them  perfectly.  Each  is  given  most  well-ordered,  regular,  and 
wise shapes. These singly and all together point to an inﬁnite knowledge and 
testify to their number to an All-Knowing Maker.

Yes, out of innumerable examples, we look at only a single tree and a 
human person, and we see that both outwardly and inwardly the fruit-bearing 
tree and multi-membered person have been delimited by unseen compasses 
and a subtle pen of knowledge, and that each of their members have been 
given perfectly ordered ﬁtting forms so that they may produce the required 
fruits and results and perform the duties of their natures. As for this, since it 
could occur only through inﬁnite knowledge, they testify to the number of 
plants and animals to the necessary existence and boundless knowledge of 
a Maker and Giver of Form, an All-Knowing Determiner Who knows the 
relationships  of  everything  with  everything  else  and  keeps  these  in  view, 
and knows the deﬁnition through the compasses and pen of the decree and 
determining  of  pre-eternal  knowledge  of  the  outsides  and  insides  of  their

ْ(cid:202)اَو

Superﬁcially, the appointed hour and sustenance appear to be unknown 
and unspeciﬁed, but for an important instance of wisdom under the veil of 
vagueness, the appointed hour is determined and speciﬁed on the page of 
every living being’s destiny in the notebook of pre-eternal divine decree and 
determining; it can be neither brought forward nor delayed. There are numer-
ous  evidences  that  the  sustenance  of  every  living  being  is  also  appointed 
and determined and inscribed on the tablets of decree and determining. For 
example, a huge tree leaving behind when it dies its seed, which is its spirit 
of a sort, to continue its duties in its place, and this occurring through the 
wise law of an All-Knowing Preserver; and milk, the sustenance of infants 
and young, ﬂowing forth from breasts, and its appearing from between blood 
and execrement, and pouring into their mouths pure and clean without being 
polluted; reject decisively the possibility of chance and shows clearly that 
they occur through the compassionate law of an All-Knowing and Compas-
sionate Provider. You can make an analogy with these two small examples 
for all living creatures and beings with spirits.

This means that in reality both the appointed hour of death is speciﬁed 
and  determined,  and  each  person’s  sustenance  has  been  determined  and 
recorded in the notebook of his destiny. But for most important instances of 
wisdom, both the appointed hour and sustenance are concealed behind the 
veil of the Unseen, and appear to be to be vague, unspeciﬁed, and apparently 
bound to coincidence. For if the appointed hour had been speciﬁed like the 
setting of the sun, the ﬁrst half of life would be passed in absolute heedless-
ness and be lost by not working for the hereafter, and the second half would 
passed in ghastly terror, as though one was every day taking one more step 
towards the gallows of death, exacerbating the calamity of death a hundred-
fold.  For  which  reason  the  calamities  one  suffers,  and  the  resurrection  of 
the dead, which is the world’s appointed hour, have mercifully been left in 
concealment in the Unseen.

As for sustenance, since after life itself it is the greatest treasury of boun-
ties, and the richest source of thanks and praise, and the most comprehen-
sive mine of worship, supplication, and entreaty, it has apparently been left 
vague and shown to be tied to chance. For in this way the door of seeking 
sustenance  through  the  intercession  of  continuously  seeking  refuge  at  the

of its beauty. For He creates and decorates an insigniﬁcant ﬂower and tiny 
ﬂy with the greatest care, skill, and art, giving them the greatest importance.

This evidence is another and better form of the similar lines at the end 
of the Arabic piece above, but because of my severe illness it explains the 
ﬁve or six evidences it comprises in the form of a very brief indication only.

Firstly

628

THE RAYS

F i r s t l y :   Throughout  the  earth  we  see  the  making  of  wondrous  living 
machines, some instantaneously and some in a minute or two, in orderly and 
measured  fashion,  each  different  from  its  fellows,  with  the  greatest  ease, 
arising from a thorough knowledge and skill, all of which point to an inﬁnite 
knowledge and testify that the perfection of knowledge is proportionate to 
the ease resulting from the skill and knowledge in the art.

Secondly

S e c o n d l y :  Perfect creations of the greatest art within the greatest pro-
fusion  and  multitude,  point  to  a  boundless  knowledge  within  an  inﬁnite 
power, and testify to their number to One Who is Absolutely Knowing and 
Powerful.

Thirdly

T h i r d l y :  Creations which are of the ﬁnest balance and measure despite 
being made with absolute speed, point to a boundless knowledge and testify 
to their number to One Absolutely Knowing and Absolutely Powerful.

Fourthly

F o u r t h l y :  The making of innumerable animate beings on the broad face 
of  the  earth  with  the  greatest  craft,  adornment,  and  beauty  of  art  despite 
their wide extent, points to an all- encompassing knowledge which confus-
ing nothing, sees all things together, and for which nothing is an obstacle to 
anything else. It testiﬁes too that singly and altogether they are the artefacts 
of One Knowing of All Things, an Absolutely Powerful One.

Fifthly

F i f t h l y :  The coming into being of the members of a species which are far 
from each other, with one in the east, one in the west, one in the north, and 
one in the south, in the same way, both resembling each other and differ-
ing, could occur only through the inﬁnite power of One Absolutely Know-
ing and Absolutely Powerful Who governs the whole universe, and through 
His inﬁnite knowledge, which encompasses all beings together with all their 
states, thus pointing to an all-encompassing knowledge and testiﬁes to One 
All-Knowing of the Unseen.

Sixthly

S i x t h l y :  The creation of a great multitude of living machines in confusing 
circumstances and dark places, for example seeds under the ground, with-
out confusion, despite their similarity and all being mixed up together, in 
miraculous fashion without neglecting any single one of any sort, together 
with  all  their  distinguishing  features,  points  as  clearly  as  the  sun  to  pre-
eternal knowledge and testiﬁes as brilliantly as daylight to the creativity and 
dominicality of One Absolutely Powerful and Absolutely Knowing. For the 
details we refer you to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and here cut a long story short.

This  piece  consists  of  one  long  universal  proof  of  divine  will,  which 
comprises  many  of  the  proofs  of  will.  In  a  short  translation  of  it,  we  set 
out evidence proving decisively divine will and choice and volition. All the 
above evidences for divine knowledge are also evidences for will. For the 
manifestations and works of knowledge and will are apparent together in all 
creatures.

The meaning of the above Arabic piece in brief

The meaning of the above Arabic piece in brief:
Everything exists through His will and volition. What He wills occurs, 
what He does not will does not occur. If He did not will it, nothing would 
occur. A proof is this:

1.  Since the Turkish is given for the Arabic piece here, the English translation of the 

Arabic is not given. [ Tr. ]

2.  H u l â s a t ü ’ l - H u l â s a :  The sum and substance in Arabic of T h e   S u p r e m e   S i g n , which 
describes in thirty-three degrees how each of the realms of creation testiﬁes to its Creator’s 
existence and unity. It is included in the collection of invocations and supplications called 
Ḥ i z b   A n w ā r   a l - Ḥ a q ā ’ i q   a l - N ū r i y y a ,  which includes a l - J a u s h a n   a l - K a b ī r . [ Tr. ]

THE RAYS

We see that among inﬁnite, confused possibilities and various fruitless 
ways,  amid  intervening  and  mutually  opposing  elements  which  ﬂow  like 
ﬂoods  causing  chaos,  in  the  midst  of  numerous  others  resembling  them-
selves, which is the cause of disorder, every creature with its own speciﬁc 
essence, particular attributes, individual character, and distinctive form, is 
taken  within  a  precise,  perfect,  regular  order;  all  its  members  and  organs 
are weighed up with a sensitive, exact measure and balance and attached to 
it; its mutually opposing members are created living and with extreme art 
from  simple,  lifeless  matter.  For  example,  a  human  being  is  created  with 
a hundred different organs from a droplet of ﬂuid, and a bird is made with 
numerous different members and organs from a simple egg and clothed in a 
miraculous form, and a tree is drawn out of a tiny seed comprising simple, 
lifeless carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, together with its branches 
and twigs and various members and parts, and dressed in an orderly, fruitful 
form.  This  self-  evidently,  indubitably,  decisively,  and  necessarily  proves 
that all those creatures together with all their parts and particles, form and 
nature, are given their particular perfect states through the will, choice, voli-
tion, and intention of One possessing Absolute Power. It proves too that eve-
rything is governed by an all-embracing will. These single creatures point-
ing in this indubitable way to divine will shows that all creatures offer tes-
timony to their number with a certainty as clear as the sun at noon to divine 
will encompassing all things, and that they comprise numberless proofs of 
the necessary existence of an All-Powerful Possessor of Will.

All the evidences for divine knowledge mentioned above are also evi-
dences for divine will, since both function together with power. One can-
not  be  without  the  other.  Just  as  all  the  correspondence  and  conformities 
between the members of species and sorts of beings indicate that their Maker 
is One and the same; so their features being distinctive and different from 
each other in wise and purposive fashion indicates deﬁnitely that their Sin-
gle Maker of Unity acts with will and choice. He creates everything with 
will, choice, volition, and intention.

This marks the end of my explanations of the Arabic piece’s meaning, 
which sets forth one universal proof of divine will. I had intended to write 
many more important points, as for the question of divine knowledge, but 
my brain was exhausted due to the illness I was suffering as a result of being 
poisoned, so it was postponed to another time.

THE RAYS

Before giving a translation of this Arabic piece from the point of view 
of the truly vast question of divine power, and a brief meaning of it, I shall 
disclose a truth which was imparted to me. It was like this:

The existence of divine power is more certain than the existence of the 
universe. Indeed, singly and all together creatures are the embodied words 
of power; they demonstrate its existence with the vision of certainty. They 
testify to their number to the Absolutely Powerful One, the One qualiﬁed by 
it. There is no need to prove that power with further proofs. But because it 
is one of the most important bases of faith and one of the most substantial 
foundation stones of resurrection, and a necessary means to understanding 
many questions of belief and Qur’anic truths, and because not everyone has 
found the way to it through the use of reason, claimed by the verse,

( 31:28 ) â á à ß Þ Ý Ü
some people have remained bewildered and uncomprehending before power 
and others have denied it, it is therefore necessary to prove an awesome truth 
concerning it.

As  for  the  above-mentioned  basis,  foundation,  means,  assertion,  and 
truth, it is the meaning of the above verse. That is to say: “ Men and jinn! 
The creation of all of you and your being raised to life at the resurrection is 
as easy for My power as the creation of a single individual! ” divine power 
creates the spring as easily as it creates a single ﬂower. For that power, there 
is no difference between particular and universal, small and large, many and 
few. It spins planets as easily as it spins particles.

In  nine  steps,  the  above  Arabic  passage  expounds  a  most  conclusive, 
cogent proof of this awesome question. Very brieﬂy, its meaning is as fol-
lows. The basis of the steps is indicated by this:

That is, divine power is such that it is powerful over all things, encom-
passes all things, is essential to the Necessarily Existent One, and accord-
ing to logic, is “ necessary ” to Him; it is impossible that it should be sepa-
rated  from  Him;  there  is  no  possibility  that  it  could  be.  Since  the  Most

Pure  and  Holy  Essence  possesses  such  necessary  power,  impotence,  its 
opposite, could certainly in no way intervene in it. Impotence could not 
impinge  on  the  All-Powerful  Essence.  Since  the  existence  of  degrees  in 
a thing occurs through the intervention of its opposite -for example, the 
degrees and levels of heat occur through the intervention of cold, and the 
degrees  of  beauty,  through  the  intervention  of  ugliness-  impotence,  the 
opposite of this essential power, can in no way approach it; there is no pos-
sibility whatsoever that it could. There can be no degrees in that absolute 
power.  Since  there  can  be  no  degrees  in  it,  stars  and  particles  are  equal 
to that power, and there are no differences for it between the part and the 
whole, or an individual and a species. The raising to life of a seed and a 
huge  tree,  and  the  universe  and  man,  and  one  individual  and  all  beings 
with spirits at the resurrection of the dead is equal in relation to that power, 
and all are equally easy. There is no difference between great and small, 
many and few. Decisive witnesses to this truth are the perfect art, order, 
balance, distinction and profusion that we see in the creation of things with 
absolute speed, absolute ease, and complete facility.

For  detailed  explanation  of  this  we  refer  you  to  the  end  of  the  Tenth 
Word,  the  Twenty-Ninth  Word,  and  the  Twentieth  Letter,  and  here  make 
only a brief allusion. Just as with respect to luminosity and through domini-
cal power, the sun’s light is reﬂected as easily on the surface of the sea and in 
all its bubbles as is it on a single fragment of glass; the two are equal; so it is 
as easy for the luminous power of the Light of Lights to create and rotate the 
heavens and stars as it is to create ﬂies and particles and rotate them; neither 
presents any difﬁculties for it.

Also, by virtue of the quality of transparency and through divine power, 
the sun’s image is present with the same ease in a tiny mirror or in the pupil 
of the eye as its light is reﬂected through the divine command on all shining 
things  and  droplets,  and  translucent  motes,  and  on  the  surface  of  the  sea.

THE RAYS

Similarly, since the inner faces of the essences of things are transparent and 
shining,  the  manifestation  and  effect  of  absolute  power  creates  all  living 
beings with the ease of creating a single individual; there is no difference 
between many and few, great and small.

Also, if two walnuts of equal weight are placed on a pair of scales which 
are absolutely precise and large enough to weigh mountains and a tiny seed 
is added to one of the walnuts, it will raise one of the pans to the height of 
a mountain-top and lower the other to the bottom of the valley. Then if two 
mountains of equal weight are placed in the pans and a walnut added to one, 
with the same ease it will raise one pan to the skies and lower the other to 
the valley bottom. In exactly the same way, in the terminology of the sci-
ence of theology (k a l ā m ), contingency is equal in regard to existence and 
non-existence. That is, the existence and non-existence of contingent beings 
are equally possible; if there is nothing to cause their existence, things which 
are not necessary but contingent are equal in regard to existence and non-
existence; there is no difference. Few or many, big or small are the same in 
regard to this contingency and equality. Thus, creatures are contingent, and 
since  within  the  sphere  of  contingency  their  existence  and  non-existence 
are equal, it is as easy for the boundless pre-eternal power of the Necessar-
ily Existent One to give existence to a single contingent being as to give all 
contingent beings existence and clothe everything in an appropriate being, 
spoiling the balance of non-existence. And when the being’s duties are com-
pleted, He takes off its garment of external existence and sends it apparently 
to non-existence, but in fact to a non-material existence within the sphere 
of His knowledge. This means that if things are ascribed to the Absolutely 
Powerful One, the raising to life of the spring becomes as easy as that of 
a ﬂower, and the raising to life of all humankind at the resurrection of the 
dead as easy as raising to life a single soul. Whereas if they are ascribed to 
causes, a ﬂower becomes as difﬁcult as the spring, and a ﬂy as difﬁcult as 
all living beings.

Also, through the mystery of order, the setting in motion of a large ship 
or  an  aeroplane  through  pressing  a  button  with  one’s  ﬁnger  is  as  easy  as 
setting in motion the mainspring of a clock by turning the key with one’s 
ﬁnger.  So  too  since  through  the  principles  of  pre-eternal  knowledge,  and 
laws of eternal wisdom, and universal manifestations of dominical will and 
its speciﬁed principles, all things, universal and particular, large and small, 
many  and  few,  have  been  given  an  immaterial  mould,  particular  measure 
and proportions, and sheer limits, they are entirely within the order of divine

knowledge and laws of divine will. Certainly, it is as easy for the Absolutely 
Powerful One to rotate the solar system and cause the ship of the earth to 
voyage around its annual orbit through His inﬁnite power as it is for Him to 
make blood circulate in a body in orderly and wise fashion and the red and 
white corpuscles circulate in the blood, and the particles circulate in the tiny 
corpuscles, for without difﬁculty He creates a human being together with his 
wondrous organs from a droplet of ﬂuid on the pattern of the universe. This 
means, if ascribed to that pre-eternal, inﬁnite power, the creation of the uni-
verse is as easy as the creation of a single human being. But if not ascribed 
to that power, it becomes as difﬁcult to create a single human being together 
with his wondrous organs, members and senses as to create the universe.

Also, through the mystery of obedience, compliance, and conforming to 
commands, with the command of “ Forward march! ” a commander impels 
a single soldier to attack, and with the same command he drives forward to 
the attack a large, disciplined army. So too, with innate desire and eagerness 
resembling soldiers totally obedient to the laws of divine will and subservi-
ent to the signs of the dominical creational commands, creatures are a thou-
sand times more obedient than the soldiers of an army -within the bounds 
of the line of action determined by pre-eternal knowledge and wisdom- and 
are completely compliant and subservient. It is therefore as easy through the 
dominical command of “ Come into existence out of non-existence and get 
down to your business! ” and in the manner determined by knowledge and in 
the form speciﬁed by will, for power to clothe an individual animate being in 
an existence particular to it, and take it by the hand and bring it into being as 
it is to create the army of living beings of the spring and to assign them their 
duties. That is to say, if everything is attributed to that power, the creation 
of the entire army of minute particles and divisions of stars is as easy and 
free of trouble as the creation of a single particle and single star. Whereas if 
attributed to causes, the creation of a particle in the pupil of a living being’s 
eye or in its brain together with its ability to perform its wondrous duties, 
would be as difﬁcult and troublesome as that of the army of animals.

We shall look at the meaning of this by means of brief indications. That 
is, by reason of the unity of sovereignty and all his subjects acting in con-
formity to his commands alone, it is as easy for a ruler and commander-in-
chief to govern a large country and numerous nation as it is to govern the 

636

THE RAYS

people of a village. For due to the unity of his decree, the members of the 
nation become a means of facility just like the soldiers, and his commands 
and  laws  are  easily  executed.  Whereas  if  it  was  left  to  various  rulers,  in 
addition to sinking into confusion, to govern a village, or even a household, 
would be as difﬁcult as governing the country. And since the obedient nation 
is  attached  to  the  single  commander,  like  individual  soldiers,  through  the 
strength of relying on the commander’s strength, and his ammunition stores 
and  army,  each  may  take  an  enemy  king  captive  and  perform  works  far 
exceeding his own individual strength. His connection with the ruler obtains 
for him an inﬁnite strength and power, so that he may perform great works. 
But if the relation is severed, he loses that vast strength, and with his own 
petty strength performs works only to the extent of the arms and ammunition 
on his back. For if it was required of him to perform all the works he carried 
out relying on the power of his connection with the ruler, he would have to 
have in his arm the strength of the army and on his back all the ruler’s stores 
of arms and ammunition.

In exactly the same way, due to the unity of His sovereignty and absolute 
rulership, the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, the All-Powerful 
Maker, creates the universe as easily as a city, and raises to life the spring as 
easily as a garden, and raises to life all the dead at the resurrection as easily 
as creating the leaves, ﬂowers, and fruits of the garden’s trees in the spring. 
He easily creates a ﬂy on the pattern of an eagle. He easily makes man the 
microcosm. Whereas if ascribed to causes, a microbe would be as difﬁcult 
as a rhinoceros, and a fruit as difﬁcult as a mighty tree. Perhaps too, every 
particle which performs its wondrous tasks in the body of a living creature 
would have to be given an eye that sees all things and knowledge that knows 
all things so that it could carry out those subtle and perfect vital duties.

Also, ease and facility reach such a degree in unity, they become neces-
sary. For if the equipping of an army is from one hand, from one factory, 
it becomes as easy as equipping a single soldier. Whereas if numerous dif-
ferent hands interfere and the various parts of the equipment are all brought 
from different factories, quantitively a single soldier’s equipment could be 
prepared  only  with  a  thousand  difﬁculties;  since  numerous  ofﬁcers  inter-
fered, it would be as difﬁcult as a thousand soldiers. Also, if the manage-
ment and command of a thousand soldiers is given to a single ofﬁcer, in one 
respect it becomes as easy as a single soldier, whereas if they were assigned 
to ten ofﬁcers or the soldiers themselves, it would result in confusion and 
great difﬁculty.

THE FIFTEENTH RAY – SECOND STATION

637

In exactly the same way, if all things are attributed to the Single One of 
Unity, they become as easy as a single thing. But if they are attributed to 
causes, a single living creature becomes as difﬁcult as the whole earth, and 
perhaps impossible. This means that in unity ease and facilty are at the level 
of necessity. And with the interference of numerous hands, the difﬁculties 
amount to impossibility.

As it is said in L e t t e r s   (   M e k t û b a t   ) , if the alternations of day and night, 
and the motions of the stars, and the seasons of the year, the autumn, winter, 
spring,  and  summer,  are  left  to  a  single  ofﬁcer  and  organizer,  that  com-
mander-in-chief commands the globe of the earth, which is a soldier: “ Rise 
up, rotate, and travel! ” Out of joy and delight at receiving the command, 
with two motions like a Mevlevi dervish in ectasy, the earth is easily the 
means to the daily and annual changes and the apparent, imaginary move-
ments of the stars, thus demonstrating the total ease and facility of unity. But 
if it is left not to the single commander but to causes and the caprices of the 
stars, and the earth is told: “ You stop in your place and don’t travel! ”, every 
night and every year thousands of stars and suns thousands of times larger 
than the earth would have to cut distances of thousands of millions of years, 
so that through their travelling, the situations of the earth and heavens such 
as the seasons and day and night, might come about. But it would be so dif-
ﬁcult as to be impossible.
ْ(cid:202)ا ىّ

ِ(cid:171)َ(cid:107)َ(cid:98)َو  alludes  to  a  vast  and  extremely  subtle,  pro-
found,  and  extensive  truth.  Referring  explanation  and  proof  of  it  to  the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , we shall here set out a single point by means of a comparison.
Yes, just as with its light the sun illuminates the whole earth and is an 
example  of  unity,  so  with  its  image,  reﬂection,  seven-coloured  light,  and 
shape  appearing  in  all  the  transparent  things  that  face  it,  like  mirrors,  it 
forms an example of oneness. If the sun possessed knowledge, power, and 
will, and the fragments of glass and droplets and bubbles in which the tiny 
suns appeared had the capacity, through the law of divine will, in each and 
next to each a complete sun would be present together with its image and 
attributes, as well as in all the other places. There being no deﬁciency in its 
power of disposal, at the command, effect, and word of dominical power, it 
would be the cause of truly extensive manifestations, thus demonstrating the 
extraordinary ease and facility of oneness.

The  phrase    ِةَ

ّ(cid:192) ِدَ(cid:110)َ

In exactly the same way, just as in respect of His unity, the All-Glori-

all things, and is all-present and all-seeing everywhere, so with respect to 
His oneness and through its manifestation, He is present together with His 
names and attributes with all things, and particularly living things, so that 
easily, in an instant, He creates a ﬂy on the pattern of an eagle and a human 
being according to the system of the universe. He creates living creatures in 
a way so miraculous that if all causes were to gather together, they could not 
make a nightingale or a ﬂy. And the One Who creates the nightingale, is the 
One Who creates all birds; and the One Who creates a human being could 
only be the One Who creates the universe.

It is very difﬁcult to express the reality of these two steps to everyone, so 
their meaning will be explained in one or two very brief points. That is, in 
relation to the power of an Absolutely Powerful One Whose existence is at 
the degree of necessity, the most powerful and stable of the degrees of exist-
ence, and is pre-eternal and post-eternal, and Who is totally detached from 
and free of materiality, and Whose holy nature is totally different to all other 
natures, - in relation to His power, the stars are like minute particles, and the 
resurrection of the dead like the spring, and to raise to life all human beings 
at the resurrection is as easy as raising to life a single soul. For as much as a 
ﬁngernail from the levels of existence that are powerful may hold a moun-
tain  from  an  insubstantial  level  of  existence,  and  may  manipulate  it.  For 
example, a mirror and faculty of memory from the level of powerful, exter-
nal existence may hold a hundred mountains and a thousand books from the 
level of existence of the World of Similitudes and non-material existence, 
which are weak and insubstantial, and they may have disposal over them. 
Thus, however inferior as regards power the level of existence of the World 
of Similitudes is to the level of external existence, the created, accidental 
existences  of  contingent  beings  are  thousands  of  times  more  inferior  and 
weaker than a pre-eternal, everlasting, necessary existence, so that through 
the manifestation of a particle He can manipulate a world from the worlds 
of contingent beings. Regretably, for the time being, three important reasons 
do not permit me to explain this lengthy truth and its ﬁne points in full, so 
we refer it to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and another time.

Through a law of the manifestation of divine will called in science “ the 
life force, ” and of the creational command, and through the command and 
will being turned towards the unconscious branches and hard twigs of a huge 
tree,  the  branches  and  twigs  do  not  form  obstacles  or  impediments  to  the 
necessary substances and foods which pass to its fruits, leaves, and ﬂowers 
through the “ life force, ” which is like the tree’s mainspring and stomach; 
indeed, they facilitate the process. In just the same way, since all [ potential ] 
obstacles in the creation of the universe and creatures cease being obstacles 
in the face of a manifestation of will and regard of the dominical command 
and become means of facility, eternal power creates the universe and all the 
species of creatures on the earth as easily as creating a single tree. Nothing 
at all is difﬁcult for it. If all those acts of creation are not ascribed to that 
power, then the creation and administration of the single tree would be as 
difﬁcult as the creation and administration of all trees, indeed, as the uni-
verse.  For  then  everything  would  become  obstacles  and  obstructions,  and 
if all causes were to gather together, they could not send the necessary sus-
tenance to the fruits, leaves, branches and twigs in orderly, regular fashion 
from the stomach and mainspring of a tree’s “ life force, ” which proceeds 
from command and will. Unless all the parts of the tree, and all its particles 
even, were given an eye, all-encompassing knowledge, and wondrous power 
which  would  see  the  entire  tree  together  with  its  parts  and  particles,  and 
know them and assist them.

So climb these ﬁve steps and take a look; see what difﬁculties -indeed, 
impossibilities- are present in unbelief and associating partners with Allah, 
and  how  distant  they  are  from  reason  and  logic,  and  how  precluded  they 
are. Then see what ease there is on the way of the Qur’an, indeed, that its 
facility is at the degree of necessity, and how acceptable and reasonable it is, 
and what certain and satisfying truth is found on its way, so certain as to be 
necessary. Understand this and say:  ِنا َ(cid:175)ـ(cid:192)ِ

[ NOTE: The basis, mine, and sun of the truths contained in these nine 
steps are the verses: ( 112:1-2 ) ' & *  $ # " ! They 
are brief indications to ﬂashes from the manifestation of divine oneness 
and eternal besoughtedness. We shall take a very brief look in one or 
two points at the meaning of this Seventh Step, and for the details refer 
you to the R i s a l e - i   N u r . ]

That is, a particle which performs wonderful duties in the eye or brain is 
not inferior to a star; nor is a part inferior to the whole; for instance, the brain 
and eye are not inferior to the human being as a whole; nor with regard to 
beauty of art and the marvels of its creation is a particular individual inferior 
to a universal species; nor with his strange members and faculties is a man 
inferior  to  all  the  animal  species;  nor  in  regard  to  ﬁne  craftsmanship  and 
being treasury-like, and resembling an index, programme, and memory, is 
a seed inferior to a mighty tree; nor in regard to his creation, and wondrous, 
comprehensive organs and faculties created so as to perform thousands of 
amazing duties, is a human being, the microcosm, inferior to the universe. 
This means that the One Who creates the particle cannot lack the power to 
create the star. And the One Who creates an organ like the tongue, certainly 
easily creates the human being. And the One Who creates a single person 
thus perfectly surely can create all animals, and this He does before our eyes. 
And the One Who creates a seed as a list, an index, a notebook of the laws 
issuing from the divine command, and as the “ life force, ” is certainly the 
Creator of all trees. And the One Who creates the human being as a sort of 
seed of the world and as its comprehensive fruit, and makes him the mirror 
to all the divine names, and connected to all the universe, and vicegerent of 
the earth, most certainly possesses such power that He creates the universe 
as easily as He creates the human being, and sets it in order. In which case, 
whoever is the Creator, Maker, and Sustainer of the particle, part, particu-
lar  individual,  seed,  and  human  person  must  be  the  Creator,  Maker,  and 
Sustainer of the stars, species, the whole, universals, trees, and the whole 
universe. That it should be otherwise is impossible and precluded.

That is, the relation to the large encompassiong universals of the particu-
lars which are encompassed – and of individuals, seeds, and grains which 
are within universals and wholes –  is as tiny miniatures, and as the identical 
samples of the universal and wholes, inscribed in miniature in the very ﬁn-
est writing. Since this is so, the encompassing universal must be within the 
grasp  of  the  Creator  of  the  particulars  and  completely  under  His  disposal 
so  that  through  the  balances  of  His  knowledge  and  its  ﬁne  pens  He  can 
include that huge all-encompassing book in hundreds of miniscule sections 
and notebooks. The relation and comparison, then, of the encompassed parts 
and  particulars  with  their  surroundings  is  as  droplets  distilled  from  what 
encompasses them, like milk, or as if someone squeezed the surroundings 
and those points dripped from them. For example, a melon seed is a droplet 
distilled from all its surroundings or a point in which is written the whole 
book,  for  it  contains  its  index,  list,  and  programme.  Since  it  is  thus,  the 
encompassing wholes and universals must be within the hand of the Maker 
of those particulars, droplets, and points so that He can distil the individuals, 
droplets, and points from them with the sensitive principles of His wisdom. 
This means that the One Who creates the seed and individual must the One 
Who creates the whole and the universals, and the other universals and sorts, 
which encompass the latter and are bigger than them; it could not be anyone 
else. In which case, the One Who creates a single soul can only be He Who 
creates all humankind. And the One Who raises to life one dead person, can 
raise to life all jinn and human beings at the resurrection of the dead, and 
will raise them to life. So see, what is claimed and stated by the verse,

( 31:28 ) â á à ß Þ Ý Ü

is most deﬁnitely and brilliantly pure truth and reality.

[ I wanted to explain the meaning of this last step at length, but regret-
ably I have been prevented by my extreme distress, arising from arbi-
trary  oppression  and  harassment,  and  my  weakness  and  serious  sick-
nesses, resulting from poisoning. I have therefore have been compelled 
to sufﬁce with a brief indication. ]

That is, let us suppose a Qur’an of Mighty Stature was written on a so-
called indivisible particle, called in the science of theology (   k a l ā m   )  and in 
philosophy  “   j a w h a r   a l - f a r d ,   ”   in  particles  of  ether,  which  is  matter  even 
ﬁner, and another mighty Qur’an was written in stars and suns on the pages 
of the heavens, then the two were compared, the microscopic Qur’an written 
in particles would not be inferior in respect of marvels and miraculous art 
than the vast Qur’an gilding the face of the heavens; indeed, in some ways 
it would be superior.

In exactly the same way, from the point of view of the originality and 
eloquence in their creation, in relation to the power of the universe’s Crea-
tor, the rose is not inferior to the star Venus, the ant is not inferior to the 
elephant,  and  a  microbe  is  more  wondrous  as  regards  its  creation  than  a 
rhinoceros, and with its marvellous inborn faculties the bee is superior to 
the date palm. This means that the One Who creates the bee can create all 
animals. The One Who raises a single soul to life can raise to life all humans 
at the resurrection of the dead and gather them together in the arena of the 
Great Gathering, and will gather them together. Nothing at all is difﬁcult for 

ٰ
THE FIFTEENTH RAY – SECOND STATION

Him, for before our eyes every spring He creates a hundred thousand sam-
ples of the resurrection with the greatest ease and speed.

Very brieﬂy, the meaning of the ﬁnal Arabic sentence is this: since the 
people  of  misguidance  do  not  know  the  unshakeable  truths  of  the  above 
Steps,  and  since  creatures  come  into  existence  extremely  easily  and 
extremely  quickly,  they  imagine  their  formation  and  creation  through  a 
Maker’s inﬁnite power to be self-formation and that they come into exist-
ence of themselves. They have thus opened for themselves the door of in 
every way impossible and precluded superstitions, which no mind, and not 
even delusion, could accept. For example, in that case, every single parti-
cle of every animate creature would have to be ascribed an inﬁnite power, 
knowledge,  and  eye  that  sees  everything,  and  power  sufﬁcient  to  execute 
every art and skill. Thus, by not accepting a single Allah, they are bound 
by their ways to accept gods to the number of particles, and thus deserve to 
enter among the lowest of the low of Hell.

As for the people of guidance, the powerful truths and irrefutable proofs 
of the above Steps afford to their sound hearts and straight minds the ﬁrm-
est conviction and most powerful belief and assent at the level of the vision 
of certainty, so that they believe without doubt or misgiving and with peace 
of mind that in relation to divine power there is no difference between stars 
and particles, or the smallest and the largest, for all these wondrous things 
occur before our very eyes. And every marvel of art conﬁrms the assertion 
of the verse,

( 31:28 ) â á à ß Þ Ý Ü
and  testiﬁes  that  what  it  states  is  pure  truth  and  reality,  and  through  the 
tongues of their beings they declare: “ Allah is Most Great! ” We too declare: 
“ Allah is Most Great! ” to their number. And with all our strength and con-
viction we afﬁrm the verse’s claim, and we testify with innumerable proofs 
that what it states is pure truth and reality.

[ A  Eulogy  which  answers  the  questions:  What  is  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ? 
What is its true nature, and what is the true nature of its Interpreter? ]

The  high  servants  of  religion  who  are  described  in  Hadiths  as  coming 
at the start of every century are not innovators, they are followers. That is 
to say, they do not create anything new themselves, they do not bring any 
new ordinances; they adjust and strengthen religion by way of following to 
the letter the fundamentals and ordinances of religion and the Sunna of the 
Prophet Muhammad ( UWBP ); they proclaim the true and original meaning 
of religion; they remove and render null and void the baseless matters which 
have been mixed up with it; they reject and destroy the attacks made on reli-
gion; they establish the divine commands, and proclaim and make known 
the nobility and exaltedness of the divine ordinances. Only, without spoiling 
the basic position or damaging the original spirit, they carry out their duties 
through new methods of persuasion appropriate to the understanding of the 
age, and in new ways and with new details.

These  dominical  ofﬁcials  conﬁrm  their  positions  through  their  actions 
and deeds. They carry out their duty of reﬂecting the ﬁrmness of their belief 
and their sincerity. They display in their actions their degree of faith. They 
show that they follow to the letter the practices of Muhammad ( UWBP ) and 
that truly they have been invested with the Prophetic robe. In short: for the 
community of Muhammad ( UWBP ) they form perfect models in respect of 
deeds and morality and following and adhering to the Prophet’s Sunna; they 
are examples worthy of being followed. The works they write expounding 
Allah’s Book and elucidating the injunctions of religion, and their present-
ing these in accordance with the understanding of the age and its degree of 
learning, are not the products of their own elevated, fertile minds; they are 
not the result of their own intelligence and knowledge. They are directly the 
inspirations and promptings of the Pure Essence of Messengership ( UWBP ), 
who is the source of revelation. J a l j a l u t i y y a ,   M a t h n a w i - i   S h a r i f ,  and F u t u h  
a l - G h a y b  and such works are all of this sort. Those holy persons have a part 
in the ordering of those choice works, and in their manner of exposition; that 
is, they are the places where their meanings are manifested and reﬂected.

To come to the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its Interpreter: since in this lofty work 
are an elevated effulgence and endless perfection never before encountered 
in any similar work; and since it is observed that, in a way hitherto unseen 
in any work, it is the heir to the effulgences of the Qur’an, which is a divine 

THE FIFTEENTH RAY – SECOND STATION

645

lamp and the sun of guidance and moon of happiness; it is a fact as clear 
as the sun that its basis is the pure light of the Qur’an and that it bears the 
effulgence of the lights of Muhammad ( UWBP ) to a greater extent than the 
works of the saints, and that the share in it, and concern with it, and sacred 
disposal over it of the Pure Essence of Messengership ( UWBP ) are greater 
than in the works of the saints, and the attainment and perfections of the one 
who is its Interpreter and place of manifestation is elevated and matchless 
to the same degree.

Yes, while still in his childhood and never having studied, in the space of 
three month’s study in order to be saved from externals, the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s 
Interpreter was made heir to the early and later sciences, mystic knowledge, 
the  realities  of  things,  the  mysteries  of  the  universe,  and  divine  wisdom, 
which had been bestowed on no one previously. With his learning and moral 
fortitude, consisting of his being embodied chastity, and his extraordinary 
courage  and  complete  self-  sufﬁciency,  he  was  a  miracle  of  creation,  an 
embodiment of divine favour; his abilities were Allah-given.

As a matchless scholar, an extraordinary prodigy, challenging the whole 
world  of  learning  before  reaching  the  age  of  puberty,  he  silenced  all  the 
scholars  with  whom  he  debated,  answered  absolutely  correctly  and  with-
out  hesitation  just  about  all  the  questions  posed  to  him,  bore  the  mantle 
of  master  from  the  age  of  fourteen,  and  continuously  irradiated  the  efful-
gence of knowledge and light of wisdom. With the subtlety and profundity 
of his exposition, the conciseness and loftiness of his explanations, and his 
insight,  perspicacity  and  light  of  wisdom,  he  astonished  the  scholars  and 
learned,  deservedly  earning  the  illustrious  title  of  Bediuzzaman  ( Wonder 
of  the  Age ).  As  someone  who  with  his  elevated  qualities  and  scholarly 
virtues  propagated  and  proved  most  perfectly  the  religion  of  Muhammad 
( UWBP ), he surely received the highest favours of the Lord of the Prophets 
( UWBP ), and was under his lofty protection and auspices. Doubtless he was 
one of noble virtue who advanced at the decree of the Most Holy Prophet 
( UWBP ), and acted under his command, and was the heir to his truths and 
reﬂected his lights.

As  indicated  by  his  making  the  lights  and  knowledge  of  Muhammad 
( UWBP ) and radiance of the Divine Candle ( Qur’an ) shine most brilliantly, 
and the mathematical signiﬁcances of the Qur’an and Hadith being fulﬁlled 
in him, and the mathematical expositions of verses expressing the prophetic 
utterances  concentrating  on  himself,  there  is  no  doubt  that  he  was  a  bur-
nished mirror to the Divine Messengership in serving the cause of belief,

and the ﬁnal luminous fruit of the tree of Messengership, and the ﬁnal mouth 
of reality in respect of the legacy of the tongue of Messengership, and a ﬁnal 
happy bearer of the Divine Candle in respect of serving belief.

Our Most Beloved, Blessed, Highly-Valued, Kindly Master!
Our  revered  Master,  who  has  completely  abandoned  his  own  will  and 
left all matters to dominical will, who sees the mercy and wisdom of divine 
determining in every apparent calamity and hardship, and with perfect trust 
and submission awaits in perfect patience the results of that dominical mani-
festation! In this terrible century when in some places the things on which 
the believers rely have begun to crumble, and with publications opposing the 
pillars of belief the deniers of Allah ﬂaunt themselves openly and arrogantly, 
and to act in opposition to the Qur’an’s commands and not believe in spir-

nature are considered marks of civilization and of being cultured and intel-
lectual -at such a time, our gracious Master wrote the R i s a l e - i   N u r , a miracle 
of the Qur’an, and offering its soothing cures to agitated, wretched hearts 
needy for the water of life of belief, gave them the good news of eternal hap-

Just as in Denizli Prison Almighty Allah bestowed T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f , 
whose remedies were sufﬁciently efﬁcacious to reduce to nothing the dis-
tress of the incarceration, and that rose’s sweet scent eliminated all the pains 
of  its  thorns,  dispelling  all  our  temporary  distress;  so  too  here  in  Afyon 
Prison, the physical discomforts of one day of which are equal to a month’s 
discomfort in Denizli Prison, the Most Muniﬁcent and Compassionate One 
of  Beauty  has  bestowed  at  the  hand  of  you  our  beloved  Master  sublime 
proofs afﬁrming divine unity and praise, and the messengership of Muham-
mad ( UWBP ), which are cures and antidotes. We most faulty students of 
yours, who through the effulgences of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  have learnt to read 
and write, consider these three short treatises to be both conclusive proofs of 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s veracity and a sort of summary of it, in the same way that 
the programme and index of a mighty pine tree is encapsulated in its seed.

We  are  incapable  of  describing  the  virtues  of  these  three  treatises,  but 
on reading them our spirits experience a powerful relief, our physical suf-
ferings are transformed into joy, and they bring us innumerable fruits from 
the garden of belief. With its eleven proofs of divine unity, the ﬁrst of them 
dispels the darknesses of disbelief, misguidance, and nature at this time. The 
second  expounds  with  sacred  proofs  of  belief,  Sura  al-Fatiha,  the  source, 
basis, and master of all the comparisons in the R i s a l e - i   N u r . And the third 
explains brilliantly in a way that ensures complete certitude the part about 
the  messengership  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP ),  which  was  imparted  to  you, 
our beloved Master, here in Afyon Prison.

Although we are in no way worthy of anything, we shall strive with all 
our power to publish these works, which we have received. Offering endless 
thanks to Almighty Allah, we pray to Him saying: “ Most Merciful of the 
Merciful! May You be pleased with our Master for ever and ever! ”

My Dear, Loyal Brothers!

[ With a presentiment of the future, the Old Said perceived the truths 
expressed in this Arabic sermon, which, on the insistence of the Damas-
cus religious authorities, he delivered forty years ago in the Umayyad 
Mosque to a congregation of close on ten thousand, which included a 
hundred religious scholars; he gave news of those truths with complete 
certainty as though they were going to be realized shortly. However, the 
two World Wars and twenty-ﬁve years of absolute despotism delayed 
their realization; it is now that the signs of this, which were predicted 
then, are beginning to be seen in the world of Islam. Therefore, if you 
consider  it  appropriate,  you  may  publish  the  translation  of  this  most 
important and instructive piece, not as an old, outdated sermon, but as 
fresh, pertinent instruction on social and Islamic questions addressing 
directly, in 1371 instead of 1327, the congregation of three hundred and 
seventy ( now more than a million ) million in the mosque of the Islamic 
world, rather than in the Umayyad Mosque. ]

It is ﬁtting here to write the most important answer to a most important 
question. For the Old Said spoke prophetically in that lesson of forty years 
ago as though he were seeing the wondrous teachings of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  
and its effects. It is for this reason that I am writing that question and answer 
here. It is like this:

Many have asked both me and the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students: “ Why is it that 
the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  is not defeated in the face of so much opposition and so 
many obdurate philosophers and people of misguidance? By preventing to 
an extent the dissemination of numerous valuable, true books on belief and 
Islam, and by means of their worldly pleasures and vices, they have deprived 
many youths and others of the truths of belief. But their most violent attacks, 

648

THE FIFTEENTH RAY – SECOND STATION

649

vicious  treatment,  lies  and  propaganda  have  been  directed  at  the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r , to destroy it and to scare people away from it and make them give it 
up. Despite this, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  has spread in a way never seen in any other 
work, six hundred thousand copies of its treatises being written out by hand 
with unﬂagging zeal and published secretly. How is it that it causes itself to 
be read with such enthusiasm, both within the country and abroad? What is 
the reason for it? In reply to the many questions of this sort, we say:

Being a true commentary on the All-Wise Qur’an through the mystery of 
its miraculousness, the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  demonstrates that in misguidance is a 
sort of Hell in this world, while in belief is a sort of Paradise. It points out the 
grievous pains in sins, bad deeds, and forbidden pleasures, and proves that in 
good deeds and virtues and the truths of the Shari‘a are to be found pleasures 
like the pleasures of Paradise. In this way it saves the sensible among those 
who have fallen into vice and misguidance. For at this time there are two 
awesome conditions:

The  First:  Since  the  human  emotions,  which  are  blind  to  the  conse-
quences of things and prefer an ounce of present pleasure to tons of future 
joys, have come to prevail over mind and reason, the only way to save the 
dissipated from their vice is to show them the pain present in their pleasure 
and to defeat their emotions. Although they are aware of the diamond-like 
bounties and pleasures of the hereafter, as the verse,

( 14:3 )  Y  X  W  V   U  
indicates, while being believers, the people of misguidance choose worldly 
pleasures, which are like pieces of glass soon to be shattered. The only way 
of saving them from this love of the world and from the danger of succumb-
ing to it is by showing them the hellish torments and pains they suffer even 
in this world. This is the way the R i s a l e - i   N u r  takes. For at this time, due to 
the obduracy arising from absolute unbelief and the intoxication caused by 
the vice and misguidance arising from science, perhaps only one in ten or 
even twenty can be induced to give up his evil ways by proving the existence 
of Hell and its torments, after having told him of Almighty Allah. Having 
heard this, such people are likely to say: “ Allah is Forgiving and Compas-
sionate, and Hell is a long way off, ” and continue in their dissipation. Their 
hearts and spirits are overcome by their emotions.

Thus, by showing through most of its comparisons the grievous and ter-
rible  results  in  this  world  of  disbelief  and  misguidance,  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  
makes  even  the  most  stubborn  and  arrogant  people  feel  disgust  at  those 

650

THE RAYS

inauspicious,  illicit  pleasures,  leading  them  to  repent.  The  short  compari-
sons in the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Words, and the long one in the Third 
Stopping-Place in the Thirty-Second Word lead a person to feel repugnance 
at the vice and misguidance of the way he has taken, and cause him to accept 
what they teach. As an example, I shall recount brieﬂy the situations I beheld 
on a journey of the imagination, which were in fact reality. Those wishing 
for a more detailed account may look at the end of T h e   R a t i f y i n g   S t a m p   o f  
t h e   U n s e e n   C o l l e c t i o n   (   S i k k e - i   Ta s d i k - i   G a y b i   ) .

When on that journey of the imagination I looked at the animal kingdom 
through the eyes of materialist philosophy and the people of misguidance 
and heedlessness, the innumerable needs of animals and their terrible hunger 
together with their weakness and impotence appeared to me as most piteous 
and grievous. I cried out. Then I saw through the telescope of Qur’anic wis-
dom and belief that the divine name of All-Merciful had risen in the sign of 
Provider like a shining sun; it gilded with the light of its mercy that hungry, 
wretched animal world.

Then I saw within the animal world another grievous world which was 
swathed in darkness and would make anyone feel pity and in which young 
were struggling in their need and powerlessness. I was sorry I had looked 
through the eyes of the people of misguidance. Suddenly, belief gave me 
other spectacles and I saw the name of All-Compassionate rise in the sign 
of  clemency;  it  transformed  and  lit  up  that  pitiful  world  in  joyous  and 
beautiful fashion, changing my tears of complaint and sorrow into tears of 
joy and thanks.

Then  the  world  of  humanity  appeared  to  me  as  though  on  a  cinema 
screen. I looked through the telescope of the people of misguidance and saw 
that world to be so dark and terrifying that I cried out from the depths of my 
heart. “ Alas! ” I cried. For they had desires and hopes that stretched to eter-
nity, thoughts and imaginings that embraced the universe, the earnest desire 
for  everlasting  happiness  and  Paradise,  an  innate  capacity  and  powers  on 
which no limit had been placed and which were free, yet despite their innu-
merable needs and their weakness and impotence they were exposed to the 
attacks  of  innumerable  enemies  and  the  blows  of  innumerable  calamities. 
Under the perpetual threat of death, they lived out their brief and tumultu-
ous lives in wretched circumstances. Ever looking to the grave, which for 
the misguided is the door to everlasting darkness, they suffered the continu-
ous blows of death and separation, the most painful state for the heart and 
conscience. I saw that singly and in groups they were being thrown into that 
black well.

THE FIFTEENTH RAY – SECOND STATION

651

On seeing the world of humanity in this darkness I was about to cry out 
with my heart, spirit, and mind, and all my subtle inner faculties, indeed 
all the particles of my being, when the light and power of belief proceed-
ing from the Qur’an smashed those spectacles of misguidance, giving me 
insight. I saw the divine name of All-Just rising like the sun in the sign of 
All-Wise, the name of All-Merciful rising in the sign of Muniﬁcent, the 
name of All-Compassionate rising in the sign of, that is, in the meaning 
of, All-Forgiving, the name of Resurrector rising in the sign of Inheritor, 
the name of Granter of Life rising in the sign of Bountiful, and the name 
of Sustainer rising in the sign of Owner. They lit up the entire world of 
humanity and all the worlds within it. They dispelled those hellish states, 
opened up windows onto the luminous worlds of the hereafter, and scat-
tered  lights  over  the  world  of  humanity.  I  declared:  “ Praise  and  thanks 
be  to  Allah  to  the  number  of  particles  in  existence! ”  I  understood  with 
complete certainty that in belief is a sort of paradise in this world too and 
in misguidance, a sort of hell.

Then the world of the earth appeared. On that journey of the imagination, 
the dark, hypothetical rules of the philosophy which does not obey religion 
depicted a ghastly world. Voyaging through space on the ship of the aged 
earth  -which  travels  seventy  times  faster  than  a  cannon  ball  a  distance  of 
twenty-ﬁve thousand years in one year, ever disposed to break up, its interior 
in a state of upheaval- the situation of wretched human kind appeared to me 
in a desolate darkness. My eyes darkened. I ﬂung the spectacles of philoso-
phy to the ground, smashing them. Then I looked with a view illumined with 
the wisdom of the Qur’an and belief, and I saw the names of Creator of the 
Heavens and Earth, All-Powerful, All-Knowing, Sustainer, Allah, Sustainer 
of the Heavens and Earth, Subjugator of the Sun and Moon had risen like 
suns in the signs of mercy, grandeur, and dominicality. They lit up that dark, 
desolate, and terrifying world so that the globe appeared to my eye of belief 
as a well-ordered, subjugated, pleasant, and safe ship, or aeroplane, or train. 
It contained everyone’s provisions, and had been decked out for trade and 
enjoyment  and  to  carry  beings  with  spirits  through  the  dominical  realms 
around the sun. I exclaimed: “ All praise be to Allah to the number of parti-
cles of the earth for the bounty of belief. ”

This  has  been  proved  with  many  comparisons  in  the  Risale-i  Nur, 
that  those  who  follow  vice  and  misguidance  suffer  a  hellish  torment  in 
this  world  too,  while  through  the  manifestations  of  belief,  the  believers 
and righteous may taste through the stomachs of Islam and humanity the 

652

THE RAYS

pleasures of Paradise. They may beneﬁt according to the degree of their 
belief.  But  in  these  stormy  times,  currents  which  numb  the  senses  and 
scatter people’s attention on peripheral matters, plunging them into them, 
have deadened their senses and bewildered them. As a result of this the 
people of misguidance are temporarily unable to feel their torment, while 
the people of guidance are overwhelmed by heedlessness and cannot truly 
appreciate its pleasures.

T h e   S e c o n d   A w e s o m e   C o n d i t i o n   T h i s   A g e :  In former times, compared 
with  the  present  there  was  very  little  absolute  disbelief,  or  misguidance 
arising from science, or the disbelief arising from perverse obstinacy. The 
instruction of the Islamic scholars of those times and their arguments were 
therefore  sufﬁcient,  quickly  dispelling  any  unbelief  arising  from  doubts. 
Belief in Allah was general, and they could persuade most people to give up 
their misguidance and wrongdoing through teaching them about Allah and 
reminding them of Hell-ﬁre. But now there are a hundred absolute disbeliev-
ers in one small town instead of perhaps one in a whole country. Those who 
lose their way due to science and learning and obstinately oppose the truths 
of  belief  have  increased  a  hundredfold  in  relation  to  former  times.  With 
pride like that of the Pharaoh and their terrible misguidance these obdurate 
deniers oppose the truths of belief. A sacred truth is therefore much needed 
that will completely destroy the bases of their disbelief in this world, like an 
atom bomb, and will halt their aggression and bring some of them to belief.
All praise be to Almighty Allah that with its many comparisons, as the 
perfect remedy for the wounds of this time, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  -a miracle of 
the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition proceeding from its effulgence- has 
routed even the worst of those obdurate deniers with the diamond sword 
of  the  Qur’an.  Its  proofs  and  arguments  to  the  number  of  the  atoms  of 
the universe demonstrating divine unity and the truths of belief show that 
in  twenty-ﬁve  years  it  has  not  been  defeated  in  the  face  of  the  severest 
attacks, but has itself prevailed and been victorious. Yes, with its compari-
sons  of  belief  and  unbelief,  and  guidance  and  misguidance,  the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r   proves  those  truths  self-evidently.  If  note  is  taken,  for  example  of 
the proofs and ﬂashes of the Second Station of the Twenty-Second Word, 
the First Stopping-Place of the Thirty-Second Word, the Windows of the 
Thirty-Third Letter, and the eleven proofs of T h e   S t a f f   o f   M o s e s   (   A s a - y ı  
M u s a   ) , it will be understood that it is the truths of the Qur’an manifested 
in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  that will smash and destroy absolute disbelief and per-
verse misguidance at this time.

THE FIFTEENTH RAY – SECOND STATION

653

In the same way that the parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  which solve the great-
est mysteries of religion and the riddles of the world’s creation have been 
collected together in  T h e   M y s t e r i e s   C o l l e c t i o n   (   T ı l s ı m l a r   M e c m u a s ı   ) , the 
pieces which describe the hell in this world of the people of misguidance and 
the paradise-like pleasures of the people of guidance and show that belief is 
like a seed of Paradise while unbelief is a seed of the Zakkum tree of Hell, 
will be put together in a small collection, Allah willing, and published.

My Dear, Loyal, Unshakeable, Constant, Devoted, Faithful Brothers!
You know that the Ankara experts’ committee was unable to deny the 
instances of wonder- working and predictions looking to the R i s a l e - i   N u r ; 
its members only wrongly supposed that I had a part in them, and objected 
saying:  “ Such  things  should  not  have  been  written  in  the  book;  wonder-
working should not be made public. ” In reply to this minor criticism, I said 
in my defence:

They are not mine and anyway I would not dare to lay claim to such 
wonders, they are rather distillations and ﬂashes of the Qur’an’s miracu-
lousness, which taking the form of wonders in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which is a 
true commentary on it, are a sort of divine bestowal ( in order to strengthen 
the morale of its students ). To make public divine bestowal is thanks of a 
sort and permissible, and it is acceptable. Now, for an important reason, I 
shall elucidate my answer a little. I was also asked why I make them pub-
lic and why I concentrate so much on this point, and why for the last few 
months I have gone much further in the subject. Most letters are related to 
the wonder-working.

T h e   A n s w e r :  Although at this time in the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s service of reli-
gious belief hundreds of thousands of repairers are necessary in the face of 
the thousands of destructive forces; and although I have need of hundreds 
of scribes and assistants; and although the people and the authorities should 
appreciatively  and  encouragingly  help  us  and  get  in  touch  with  us  rather 
than avoiding us and not having contact with us; and although the believ-
ers  are  obliged  to  give  preference  to  serving  the  cause  of  belief  over  the 

654

THE RAYS

occupations of this worldly life and its beneﬁts, since it looks to eternal life; 
taking myself as an example, I say this:

Because of our opponents preventing me from having contact with peo-
ple and having helpers, and from everything; and their destroying the morale 
of my friends as much as they possibly can, and making them look coldly on 
me and the R i s a l e - i   N u r ; and because of my being burdened with the duties 
of  a  thousand  people  despite  being  an  aged,  ill,  weak,  wretched  stranger 
with no one; and because of my being compelled to avoid having contact 
with people and mixing with them due to a sort of physical illness caused 
by being isolated and oppressed; and because of their scaring off the people 
so effectively and destroying their morale; – because of all these and in the 
face of all those obstacles, I was made to write things of that sort in order 
to muster spiritual forces around the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , and describe the divine 
bestowals,  which  are  a  means  of  strengthening  the  morale  of  the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r  students, and to show that on its own the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  is as powerful 
as an army ( and is in no need of others ). For to sell myself, Allah forbid, 
and make myself liked, and to boast and show off would be to damage the 
mystery of sincerity, which is an important principle of the R i s a l e - i  N u r . Just 
as, Allah willing, the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  will both defend itself and demonstrate 
its true value, so will it in effect also defend us, and be the means of having 
our faults pardoned.

Sending thousands of greetings to all my brothers and sisters, and partic-
ularly to the innocent and venerable elderly, whose prayers are acceptable, 
and offering prayers for all, we congratulate them on the month of Ramadan 
and request that they pray for us.

This  powerless  brother  of  yours  says  this  both  to  that  old  friend  who 
objected, and to the attentive, and to yourselves: through the effulgence of 
the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition,  the  New  Said  offers  proofs  of  the 
truths of belief so logical and correct that they compel not only the Mus-
lim scholars, but also obdurate European philosophers to submit, and this 
they do. As for the signs and allusions of the Qur’an of Miraculous Expo-
sition,  from  the  level  of  its  allusive  meanings,  attracting  attention  to  the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r ,  which  is  one  of  its  miracles  at  this  time,  it  is  a  mark  of  the 
Qur’an’s miraculousness – similar to the allusive and symbolic prophecies 
of Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) and Gawth al-A‘zam ( May 
Allah be pleased with him ) concerning the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s importance and 
value.  To  do  so  is  also  necessitated  by  the  miraculous  eloquence  of  that 
tongue of the Unseen.

Yes, it was imparted to me in Eskişehir Prison at a terrible time when 
we were in dire need of a sacred solace: “ You cite the saints of olden times 
as testifying to the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s acceptability, but in accordance with the 
inner meaning of the verse,

( 6:59 )   Þ Ý Ü Û Ú Ù Ø ×    
it is the Qur’an that should have the word in this matter. Does it ﬁnd the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r   acceptable?  How  does  it  look  on  it? ”  I  was  faced  with  this 
strange  question.  So  I  sought  help  from  the  Qur’an,  and  within  the  space 
of an hour I perceived that the R i s a l e - i   N u r  was one element of the level of 
allusive meanings of thirty-three verses, from the level constituted by details 
of  their  explicit  meanings  ( and  included  in  the  generality  of  the  allusive 
meanings ), and that there were powerful inferences to its inclusion and dis-
tinction. A part of these I saw in some detail, and a part I saw in summary 
form. In my view, no doubt, hesitation, suspicion, or misgiving remained. 
And I wrote that ﬁrm conviction of mine with the intention of strengthen-
ing the faith of the believers through the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and I gave it to my 
closest  (   h â s   )   brothers  on  condition  it  was  held  to  be  conﬁdential.  In  the 
treatise, we do not say that this is the explicit meaning of the verse, lest the 
h o d j a s  say “ he has been smitten by the evil-eye. ” And we do not say that 
this  is  the  generality  of  the  allusive  meaning.  We  say  that  underlying  the 
explicit meaning are numerous layers or levels, one of which is the allusive 
and symbolic meaning, and that the allusive meaning is a generality. Every 

656

THE RAYS

century, this has particularities. And this century the R i s a l e - i   N u r  is one ele-
ment in the generality of that level of its allusive meaning. Inferences drawn 
by means of the principles of j a f r  and numbers, practised since early times 
by  the  ulema,  indeed,  proofs,  show  that  that  element  is  intentionally  held 
in view and will perform an important function, and this does not harm the 
verse of the Qur’an or its clear meaning, but serves its miraculousness and 
eloquence. One who cannot deny the innumerable deductions made by the 
people of reality from Qur’anic allusions, should not deny this, and no one 
can deny it.

However, if the person who out of amazement deems it unlikely that 
such an important work should appear at the hand of an insigniﬁcant per-
son like myself thinks of the creation of a pine tree the size of a mountain 
out of a seed the size of a grain of wheat as being a sign of divine power 
and grandeur, he is surely bound to say that the appearance of this work 
at such a time of intense need from someone as absolutely impotent and 
wanting as myself is evidence for the vast extent of divine mercy. By the 
honour of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , I assure you and those who object, that these 
allusions  and  symbolic  predictions  and  indications  of  the  saints  always 
drove me to offer thanks and praise and to seek forgiveness for my sins. 
I can prove to you through the glimpses you have had of my life, under 
your very eyes these twenty years, that at no time, not even for a minute, 
did  they  inﬂate  my  ego  and  make  my  evil-commanding  soul  proud  and 
arrogant.  Nevertheless,  man  is  not  free  of  fault  or  forgetfulness.  I  have 
numerous  faults  of  which  I  am  not  aware.  Also,  perhaps  my  own  ideas 
crept in and there are some errors in some of the treatises. But since they 
do not object to the false and corrupting interpretations of the people of 
misguidance,  screened  by  setting  up  man-made  translations  in  place  of 
the sacred letters of the Qur’an, in the deﬁcient letters of the new [ Latin ] 
script, and their harming the clear meanings of verses, they surely should 
not object to someone wretched and persecuted expounding a ﬁne point of 
the Qur’an’s miraculousness in order to strengthen the belief of his broth-
ers, to the extent of discouraging him in his service of belief, as not only 
the people of reality, anyone with even a grain of fairness would agree.

In addition I say this: in the face of the awesome attacks of misguidance 
at  this  time,  the  powerful,  true  ways,  paths,  and  t a r i q a t s   with  millions  of 
devoted  followers  have  been  apparently  defeated.  But  a  semi-literate  per-
son  under  constant  surveillance  living  opposite  the  police-station,  who  is 

THE FIFTEENTH RAY – SECOND STATION

657

alone and the object of a many-sided campaign of slander in order to make 
everyone execrate him, cannot lay claim to the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which is more 
advanced than those other ways and has resisted the attacks more strongly, 
and that work cannot be the product of his skill, and he cannot take pride 
in it. It has rather been bestowed directly by divine mercy as a miracle of 
the All-Wise Qur’an at this time. He laid hands on that gift of the Qur’an 
together with thousands of his friends. For sure the duty of chief interpreter 
fell to him, but evidence that it is not the work of his thought, knowledge, 
and intelligence is that in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  are parts which were written in six 
hours, others that were written in two hours, others in one hour, and some 
in  ten  minutes  even.  I  swear  that  even  with  the  power  of  memory  of  the 
Old Said ( May Allah be pleased with him ) 1 with my own thought I could 
not write in ten hours what was written in ten minutes. With my own mind 
and capacity I could not write in two days the treatise that was written in an 
hour. And neither myself nor the most exacting religious philosopher could 
research the matters of the Thirtieth Word and write it in six days, although 
it was written in one day in six hours. And so on.

That is to say, despite being bankrupt, I am the herald and servant of a 
wonderfully  rich  jeweller’s  shop.  Out  of  His  grace  and  muniﬁcence  may 
Almighty Allah make us and all R i s a l e - i   N u r  students purely and sincerely 
constant  in  this  service,  and  give  us  success.  Amen.  In  veneration  of  the 
Lord of Messengers.

1.  Intending it to be a prayer, some of the scribes wrote the phrase ( May Allah be 
pleased with him ) after this wretched Said’s name. I wanted to change it, but it occurred 
to me that since it is a prayer seeking Allah’s pleasure, it should not be interfered with, so 
I did not change it.

declare: ِ

ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا   ]

(cid:2)(cid:3)

FIRST POINT

First of all, two things will be pointed out:
1. Philosophy is a pair of dark glasses which shows everything to be ugly 
and frightful, while belief in Allah is a transparent, clear, luminous pair of 
spectacles which shows everything to be beautiful and familiar.

2. A person is connected with all creatures, has a sort of commerce with 
all things, and by nature is compelled to meet, talk, and be neighbourly with 
the things that blockade him; so too he possesses six aspects: a left, right, 
upper, lower, front, and back aspect.

On wearing either of these two pairs of spectacles, the person can see the 

creatures and things present in the aspects mentioned above.

Right Aspect

R i g h t   A s p e c t :  What is meant by this aspect is the past. When it is beheld 
through the spectacles of philosophy, it is seen to be a vast, dark, terrifying, 
overturned graveyard where the doomsday of the land of the past has come 
to pass. There can be no doubt that such a sight casts one into great terror, 
fear, and despair.

However, when this aspect is looked at through the spectacles of belief, 
even if the land appears to have been turned upside down, as indeed it has, 
there has been no loss of life; it is understood that its crew and inhabitants 
have been transferred to a better world, one full of light. The graves and pits 
are seen to be underground tunnels, dug to lead to another, light-ﬁlled world.

659

That is to say, the joy, relief, conﬁdence, and peace of mind belief gives to 
a person is a divine bounty that makes him repeat thousands of times over: 
ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا

Left Aspect

L e f t   A s p e c t :  When the future is looked at through the spectacles of phi-
losophy, it appears in the form of a huge, black, terrifying grave which is 
going to rot us and make us prey to snakes and scorpions which will elimi-
nate us. But when it is looked at through the spectacles of belief, it is seen 
in the form of a repast comprising every variety of the ﬁnest and most deli-
cious foods and drinks which Almighty Allah, the Most Merciful and All-
Compassionate Creator, has prepared for human beings. So it makes them 
ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا

repeat many thousands of times: ِ

Upper Aspect

U p p e r   A s p e c t :  This is the heavens. When a person looks at this aspect 
through the spectacles of philosophy, he feels an awful terror at the great 
speed and variety of the motions – like horse races or military manoeuvres – 
of the millions of stars and heavenly bodies in endless space. Whereas when 
a believer beholds them, he sees that those strange and wonderful manoeu-
vres are being carried out under the supervision of a commander and at his 
command;  and so the stars are adorning the world of the heavens and are 
light-giving lamps for him. In consequence, he feels not fear and fright at 
those horses racing, but familiarity and affection. It is surely little to say: 
ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا thousands of times for the bounty of belief which thus illuminates 
the world of the heavens.

Lower Aspect

L o w e r   A s p e c t :  This is the earth. When a person looks at this world with 
the eye of philosophy, he sees it as an untethered, unhaltered animal wander-
ing aimlessly around the sun, or like a holed and captainless boat, and he is 
carried away by fear and anxiety. But when he looks with belief, he sees it 
in the form of a ship of the Most Merciful One ploughing its course around 
the sun under the command of Allah Almighty, with all its food, drink, and 
clothing on board, for the pleasure of mankind. So he starts to declare with 

great feeling: ِ

Front Aspect

ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا for this great bounty which springs from belief.

F r o n t  A s p e c t :  If a person who indulges in philosophy looks at this aspect, 
he sees that all living creatures, whether human or animal, are rapidly dis-
appearing group by group. That is to say, they are departing for non-being 
and ceasing to exist. Since he knows that he too is a traveller on that road, 
he goes out of his mind with grief. But for a believer looking with the eye

THE RAYS

of  belief,  those  journeying  to  that  aspect  are  not  passing  to  the  world  of 
non-existence; they are being transferred from one pasture to another like 
nomads, and migrating from a transitory realm to an everlasting one, and 
from a farm of service and labour to the wages ofﬁce, and from a country 
of hardship and difﬁculty to one of plenty and ease. The believer meets this 
aspect with pleasure and gratitude.

Difﬁculties which occur on the road like death and the grave are sources 
of happiness by reason of their results. For the road which leads to the lumi-
nous worlds passes through the grave, and the greatest happiness is the result 
of the worst, most grievous disasters. For example, Joseph ( UWP ) attained 
the happiness of being ruler of Egypt only by way of being thrown into the 
well by his brothers and cast into prison at the slanders of Zulaikha. In the 
same  way,  a  child  coming  into  the  world  from  his  mother’s  womb  only 
reaches the happiness of this world as a result of the excruciating, crushing 
difﬁculties he experiences on the way.

Back Aspect

B a c k   A s p e c t :  That is, since one who looks at those who have remained 
behind  with  the  view  of  philosophy  can  ﬁnd  no  answer  to  the  question: 
“Where have they come from and where are they going, and why did they 
come to the land of this world?”, he naturally remains in a torment of bewil-
derment and doubt. But were he to look through the spectacles of belief, he 
would understand that human beings are observers, sent by the Pre-Eternal 
Sovereign to contemplate and study the wonderful miracles of power dis-
played in the exhibition of the universe, and that after receiving their marks 
and ranks in conformity with the degree they have grasped the value and 
grandeur of those miracles of power and the degree to which the miracles 
point to the grandeur of the Pre-Eternal Sovereign, they will return to the 
ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا for the bounty of 

Sovereign’s realm. So the person will exclaim: ِ
belief which has given him this bounty.

Since the praise offered in saying: ِ

ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا for the bounty of belief, which 
thus  banishes  the  above-mentioned  layers  of  darkness,  is  also  a  bounty, 
praise should be offered for it too. And praise should be offered a third time 
for this second bounty of praise, and a fourth time for the third bounty of 
praise. That is to say, an inﬁnite chain of praise is born of a single uttering 

of the phrase: ِ

One should say: ِ

ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا  for the bounty of belief which illuminates these 
six aspects, for just as since it disperses the darkness of the six aspects, it 
may be considered a great bounty for the warding off of evil, so too since it 
illuminates them it may be thought of as a second bounty, for the attraction 
of beneﬁts. Therefore, since human beings are by nature civilized, they are 
connected with all the creatures in the six aspects, and through the bounty of 
belief have the possibility of beneﬁting from the six aspects.

Thus, according to a meaning of the verse:

( 2:115 ) l k j i h
a person ﬁnds enlightenment in whichever of the six aspects he is found. In 
fact, someone who is a believer has a life which in effect stretches from the 
foundation of the world to its end. This life of his receives assistance from 
the  light  of  a  life  which  extends  from  pre-eternity  to  post-eternity.  In  the 
same way, by virtue of the belief which illuminates the six aspects, his nar-
row time and space are transformed into a broad and easy world. This exten-
sive world becomes like his house, and the past and the future like present 
time for his spirit and heart. The distance between between them disappears.

saying: ِ

The fact that belief affords sources of support and assistance necessitates 

Yes, because of their impotence and their multitudinous enemies, human-
kind are in need of a source of support to which they can have recourse to 
repulse them. Likewise, because of the abundance of their needs and their 
extreme want, they need a source of assistance from which they may seek 
help, so that through it they may meet their needs.

O man! Your one and only point of support is belief in Allah. The only 
source of assistance for your spirit and conscience is belief in the hereafter. 
The person who does not know of these two sources suffers constant fear 
in  his  heart  and  spirit,  and  his  conscience  is  perpetually  tormented,  while 
the person who seeks support from the ﬁrst point and help from the second, 
experiences many pleasures and delights in his heart and spirit, so that he is 
both consoled, and his conscience is at ease.

By showing showing that similar pleasures exist and will be bestowed, 
the light of belief removes the pain that occurs when lawful pleasures start 
to fade. Furthermore, by pointing out the source of bounties, it ensures that 
the bounties continue and do not diminish.

Similarly, by showing the pleasure of renewed acqaintance, it removes 
the pain of separation and parting. That is to say, while many pains occur at 
the thought of the passing of a single pleasure, belief removes the pains by 
calling to mind the recurrence of the pleasure. In any event there are further 
pleasures  in  the  renewal  of  pleasure.  If  a  fruit  has  no  tree,  its  pleasure  is 
restricted to and ceases on its being eaten, and its ceasing is the cause of sor-
row. But if the fruit’s tree is known, there is no pain when the fruit ceases to 
exist, for there are others to come in its place.

At the same time, renewal is in itself a pleasure. For what troubles the 
human spirit most are the pains arising from separation, but the light of belief 
removes those pains due to the hope of renewed meeting and the recurrence 
of similar encounters.

FIFTH POINT

Those things people imagine to be hostile and foreign, and lifeless and 
lost as though orphans or dead, the light of belief shows to be friends and 
brothers,  living,  and  glorifying  Allah.  That  is  to  say,  a  person  who  looks 
with the eye of heedlessness supposes the beings in the world to be harmful 
like enemies, and he takes fright; he looks on things as foreign. For in the 
view of misguidance, there are no bonds of brotherhood between the things 
of  the  past  and  those  of  the  future.  There  is  only  an  insigniﬁcant,  partial 
connection between them. In consequence, the brotherhood of the people of 
misguidance is only for one minute within thousands of years.

In  the  view  of  belief,  all  the  heavenly  bodies  appear  as  living  and  as 
familiar  with  one  another.  Belief  shows  each  of  them  to  be  glorifying  its 
Creator through the tongue of its being. It is in this respect that all the heav-
enly bodies possess a sort of life and spirit according to each. No fear and 
fright therefore can be felt when the heavenly bodies are considered from the 
point of view of belief; just familiarity and love.

Unbelief looks on human beings as powerless to secure their desires, as 
ownerless and without protector; it imagines them to be grieving and sor-
rowful like weeping orphans on account of their impotence. From the point 
of  view  of  belief  on  the  other  hand,  they  are  seen  to  be  living  creatures;

not orphans but ofﬁcials charged with duties; servants glorifying and extol-
ling Allah.

SIXTH POINT

The light of belief depicts this world and the next as two tables display-
ing numerous varieties of bounties from which a believer beneﬁts through 
the  hand  of  belief,  his  inner  and  external  senses,  and  his  subtle,  spiritual 
faculties. In the view of misguidance, the sphere from which a living being 
may beneﬁt diminishes and is restricted to material pleasures, while in the 
view of belief, it expands to a sphere which embraces the heavens and the 
earth. Yes, a believer considers the sun to be a lamp hanging in the roof of 
his house, and the moon to be a night-light. They thus become bounties for 
him, and the sphere from which he beneﬁts is broader than the heavens. The 
Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition alludes to these wonderful bounties and 
blessings which arise from belief with the eloquent verses,

and,

( 14:33 ) Ì Ë Ê É

( 10:22 ) ? > = < ; :

It is known through belief that Allah’s existence is a bounty surpassing 
all other bounties, a supreme bounty that is a source and fountain containing 
endless varieties of bounties, innumerable sorts of blessings, and uncount-
able kinds of gifts. In consequence it is incumbent on human beings and a 
debt to offer praise and laudation for the bounties of belief to the number of 
particles in the world. A number of these have been shown in various parts 
of the R i s a l e - i   N u r ; discussing belief in Allah, they raise the veil from these 
bounties and point them out.

One of the bounties for which praise should be offered with all the praise 
ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا  indicates  with  the  L ā m   of  speciﬁcation,  1  is  the 
that  the  phrase  ِ
bounty of divine mercy. Indeed, mercy comprises bounties to the number of 
living beings which manifest divine mercy. For human beings in particular 
are connected with all living creatures, and in this respect are gladdened by 
their happiness and saddened by their pain. Thus, a bounty found in a single 
being is a bounty also for his fellows.

Another which comprises bounties to the number of children which are 
blessed with their mother’s tenderness, and which deserves praise and lauda-
tion, is divine compassion. Yes, a person with conscience who feels sorrow 
and pity at the weeping of a motherless, hungry child, surely feels pleasure 
at a mother’s compassion for her child, surely he is pleased and happy. Thus, 
pleasures of this sort are each a bounty and require praise and thanks.

Another of the bounties requiring praise and thanks to the number of all 
the  varieties  and  instances  of  wisdom  contained  in  the  universe  is  divine 
wisdom.  For  just  as  a  person’s  self  is  endowed  with  the  manifestation  of 
divine mercy and his heart with the manifestation of divine compassion, so 
too does his intellect take pleasure at the subtleties of divine wisdom. So in 
this respect they require endless praise and laudation through the declaring 

of  ِ

ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا
Another is the bounty of preservation, for which praise should be offered 
to  the  number  of  manifestations  of  the  divine  name  of  Inheritor,  and  the 
number of descendants who endure after the passing of their forbears, and 
the number of the beings of the next world, and the number of men’s actions 
which are preserved so as to be the means of their receiving their rewards in 
ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا that it ﬁlls 
the hereafter; praise should be offered with so great an ِ
all space with its sound. For the continuation of a bounty is more valuable 
than the bounty itself. The perpetuation of pleasure is more pleasurable than 
the  pleasure  itself.  To  abide  permanently  in  Paradise  is  superior  to  Para-
dise itself; and so on. Consequently, the bounties which Almighty Allah’s 
attribute of Preserver comprise are greater and far superior to all the boun-
ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا as 
ties existent in all the universe. Thus, this attribute requires an ِ
great as the world. You can compare the rest of the divine names with the 
four mentioned here, and since in each are endless bounties, each requires 
endless praise and thanks.

Likewise, the Prophet Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), 
who is the means of attaining the bounty of belief and has the authority to 
open all the treasuries of bounty, is also such a bounty that humankind bears 
for all eternity the debt of praising and applauding him.

Likewise, the bounties of Islam and the Qur’an, which are the index and 
source of all varieties of bounties, material and spiritual, require and deserve 
unending, inﬁnite praise.

Praise be to Allah, Whom, according to the Qur’an of Mighty Stature, 
which  is  its  expounder,  this  mighty  book  known  as  the  universe  praises 
and  extols  with  all  its  chapters  and  sections,  all  its  pages  and  lines,  all

extols through making manifest His attributes of beauty and perfection. It 
is as follows:

According to its capacity, whether great or small, each inscription in this 
mighty book praises and extols its Inscriber, Who is the Single and Eternally 
Besought One, through displaying His glorious attributes.

Likewise,  each  inscription  in  the  book  of  the  universe  offers  praise 
through exhibiting the attributes of beauty of its Scribe, Who is the Most-
Merciful and Compassionate One.

Likewise,  through  reﬂecting  and  mirroring  the  manifestations  of  the 
Most Beautiful Names, all the inscriptions and points and embroideries in 
this book utter the praises of the Most Pure and Holy One through lauding, 
glorifying, and exalting Him.

who stand against faith.

His Signs, He shows you the lightning, by way both of fear and of hope, and He 
sends down rain from the sky and with it gives life to the earth after it is dead: verily 
in that are Signs for those who are wise. And among His Signs is this, that heaven 
and earth stand by His command: then when He calls you, by a single call, from the 
earth, behold, you [straightway] come forth. To Him belongs every being that is in 
the heavens and on earth: all are devoutly obedient to Him. It is He Who begins [the

Might, Full of Wisdom.
