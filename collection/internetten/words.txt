angels,  the  animals,  plants  and  inanimate  creatures,  and  man,  and  their  diverse 
duties of worship  

 361 

Fifth  Branch:  Five  ‘Fruits’:  on  love  and  fear;  worship  is  not  the  introduction  to 
further  reward,  but  the  result  of  previous  bounty;  limitless  acts  pertaining  to  the 
hereafter  in  a  brief  life;  do  not  imitate  the  worldly;  turning  from  multiplicity  to 
unity and from transience to permanence

Addendum: A short way to Almighty God, consisting of four ‘Steps’    491

Introduction and nine ‘Indications’

IN THE NAME OF GOD, 
THE MERCIFUL, THE COMPASSIONATE 

And from Him do we seek help. 
All praise be to God, the Sustainer of All the Worlds, 
and blessings and peace be upon our master Muhammad, 
and on all his Family and Companions. 

 [Brother! You wanted a few words of advice from me, so listen to a few truths 
included in eight short stories, which since you are a soldier, are in the form of 
comparisons of a military nature. I consider my own soul to need advice more 
than  anyone,  and  at  one  time  I  addressed  my  soul  at  some  length  with  Eight 
Words inspired by eight verses of the Qur’an from which I had benefited. Now I 
shall address my soul with these same Words, but briefly and in the language of 
ordinary people. Whoever wishes may listen together with me.] 

The First Word 

Bismillah, “In the Name of  God,”  is the  start of  all things good. We too shall  start 
with  it.  Know,  O  my  soul!  Just  as  this  blessed  phrase  is  a  mark  of  Islam,  so  too  it  is 
constantly recited by all beings through their tongues of disposition. If you want to know 
what an inexhaustible strength, what an unending source of bounty is Bismillah, listen to 
the following story, which is in the form of a comparison. It goes like this: 

Someone  who  makes  a  journey  through  the  deserts  of  Arabia  has  to  travel  in  the 
name  of  a  tribal  chief  and  enter  under  his  protection,  for  in  this  way  he  may  be  saved 
from the assaults of bandits and secure his needs. On his own  

 

16

he will perish  in the  face of  innumerable enemies and needs. And so, two men went on 
such  a  journey  and  entered  the  desert.  One  of  them  was  modest  and  humble,  the  other 
proud  and  conceited.  The  humble  man  assumed  the  name  of  a  tribal  chief,  while  the 
proud man did not. The first travelled safely wherever he went. If he encountered bandits, 
he  said:  “I  am  travelling  in  the  name  of  such-and-such  tribal  leader,”  and  they  did  not 
molest him. If he came to some tents, he was treated respectfully due to the name. But the 
proud  man  suffered  indescribable  calamities  throughout  his  journey.  He  both  trembled 
before everything and begged from everything. He was abased and became an object of 
scorn. 

My proud soul! You are the traveller, and this world is a desert. Your impotence and 
poverty have no limit, and your enemies and needs are endless. Since it is thus, take the 
name  of  the  Pre-Eternal  Ruler  and  Post-Eternal  Lord  of  the  desert  and  be  saved  from 
begging before the whole universe and trembling before every event. 

Yes, this phrase is a treasury so blessed that your infinite impotence and poverty bind 
you  to  an  infinite  power  and  mercy;  it  makes  your  impotence  and  poverty  a  most 
acceptable intercessor at the Court of One All-Powerful and Compassionate. The person 
who acts saying, “In the Name of God,” resembles someone who enrolls in the army. He 
acts  in  the  name  of  the  government;  he  has  fear  of  no  one;  he  speaks,  performs  every 
matter,  and  withstands  everything  in  the  name  of  the  law  and  the  name  of  the 
government. 

At  the  beginning  we  said  that  all  beings  say  “In  the  Name  of  God”  through  the 

tongue of disposition. Is that so? 

Indeed, it is so. If you were to see that a single person had come and had driven all 
the inhabitants of a town to a place by force and compelled them to work, you would be 
certain  that  he  had  not  acted  in  his  own  name  and  through  his  own  power,  but  was  a 
soldier, acting in the name of the government and relying on the power of the king.  

In the same way, all things act in the name of Almighty God, for minute things like 
seeds  and  grains  bear  huge  trees  on  their  heads;  they  raise  loads  like  mountains.  That 
means all trees say:  “In the Name of God,”  fill their  hands  from the treasury of  mercy, 
and offer them to us. All gardens say: “In the Name of God,” and become cauldrons from 
the kitchens of Divine power in which are cooked numerous varieties of different foods. 
All blessed animals like cows, camels, sheep, and goats, say: “In the Name of God,” and 
produce  springs  of  milk  from  the  abundance  of  mercy,  offering  us  a  most  delicate  and 
pure food like the water of life in the name of the Provider. The roots and rootlets, soft as 
silk, of plants, trees, and grasses say: “In the Name of God,” and pierce and pass through 
hard rock and earth.  

 

17

Mentioning  the  name  of  God,  the  name  of  the  Most  Merciful,  everything  becomes 
subjected to them. 

The roots spreading through hard rock and earth and producing fruits as easily as the 
branches spread through the air and produce fruits, and the delicate green leaves retaining 
their  moisture  for  months  in  the  face  of  extreme  heat,  deal  a  slap  in  the  mouths  of 
Naturalists and jab a finger in their blind eyes, saying: “Even heat and hardness, in which 
you  most trust, are under a command. For  like the Staff of  Moses, each of those silken 
rootlets conforms to the command of,  And We  said, O Moses, strike the rock  with your 
staff,1 and splits the rock. And the delicate leaves fine as cigarette paper recite the verse, 
O  fire  be  coolness  and  peace2  against  the  heat  of  the  fire,  each  like  the  members  of 
Abraham (UWP). 

Since  all  things  say:  “In  the  Name  of  God,”  and  bearing  God’s  bounties  in  God’s 
name, give them to us, we too should say: “In the Name of God.” We should give in the 
name of God, and take in the name of God. And we should not take from heedless people 
who neglect to give in God’s name. 

Question: We give a price to people, who are like tray-bearers. So what price does 

God want, Who is the true owner? 

The Answer: Yes, the price the True Bestower of Bounties wants in return for those 
valuable bounties and goods is three things: one is remembrance, another is thanks, and 
the other  is  reflection. Saying,  “In the Name of  God” at the start is remembrance, and, 
“All  praise  be  to  God”  at  the  end  is  thanks.  And  perceiving  and  thinking  of  those 
bounties, which are priceless wonders of art, being miracles of power of the Unique and 
Eternally Besought One and gifts of His mercy, is reflection. However foolish it is to kiss 
the  foot  of  a  lowly  man  who  conveys  to  you  the  precious  gift  of  a  king  and  not  to 
recognize  the  gift’s  owner,  it  is  a  thousand  times  more  foolish  to  praise  and  love  the 
apparent source of bounties and forget the True Bestower of Bounties. 

O my soul! If you do not wish to be foolish in that way, give in God’s name, take in 
God’s  name,  begin  in  God’s  name,  and  act  in  God’s  name.  And  that’s  the  matter  in  a 
nutshell!

The Second Station 
of the Fourteenth Flash 

This,  which  is  included  here  because  of  its  relevance,  consists  of  six  of  the 
thousands  of  mysteries  contained  in  “In  the  Name  of  God,  the  Merciful,  the 
Compassionate”  

NOTE:    A  bright  light  from  “In  the  Name  of  God,  the  Merciful,  the 
Compassionate” concerning divine mercy appeared to my dull mind from afar. I 
wanted to record it for myself in the form of notes, to hunt it down and capture it, 
and  circumscribe  the  light  with  twenty  to  thirty  mysteries.  But  unfortunately  I 
was not able to do this at the present time and the twenty or thirty mysteries were 
reduced to five or six. 

When I say: “O man!”, I mean myself. While this lesson is directed particularly 
to  my  own soul, I refer it as the Second Station  of the Fourteenth Flash for the 
approval  of  my  meticulous  brothers  in  the  hope  that  it  may  benefit  those  with 
whom I am connected spiritually and whose souls are more discerning than mine. 
This lesson looks to the heart more than the reason, and regards spiritual pleasure 
and perception rather than rational proofs. 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
[The  Queen]  said:  “Ye  chiefs!  Here  is—delivered  to  me—a  letter  worthy  of 
respect.  It  is  from  Solomon,  and  is  [as  follows]:  In  the  Name  of  God,  the 
Merciful, the Compassionate.”1 

A number of mysteries will be mentioned in this Station. 

FIRST MYSTERY 

as follows: 

I saw one manifestation of “In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate” 

On  the  face  of  the  universe,  the  face  of  the  earth,  and  the  face  of  man  are  three 

stamps of dominicality one within the other and each showing samples of the others. 

                                                
1 Qur’an, 27:29-30. 

 

19

T  h  e    F  i  r  s  t    is  the  great  stamp  of  Godhead,  which  is  manifested  through  the 
mutual  assistance,  co-operation,  and  embracing  and  corresponding  to  one  another  of 
beings in the totality of the universe. This looks to “In the Name of God.” 

T  h  e    S  e  c  o n  d    is  the  great  stamp  of  divine  mercifulness,  which  is  manifested 
through the mutual resemblance and proportion, order, harmony, favour and compassion 
in the disposal, raising, and administration of plants and animals on the face of the earth. 
This looks to “In the Name of God, the Merciful.” 

T  h  e  n    is  the  exalted  stamp  of  divine  compassionateness,  which  is  manifested 
through the subtleties of divine beneficence, fine points of divine clemency, and rays of 
divine  compassion  on  the  face  of  man’s  comprehensive  nature.  This  looks  to  “the 
Compassionate” in “In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.” 

That is to say, “In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate” is the sacred 
title  of  three  stamps  of  divine  oneness,  which  form  a  luminous  line  on  the  page  of  the 
world, and a strong cord, and shining filament. That is, by being revealed from above, the 
tip of “In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate” rests on man, the fruit of 
the  universe  and  miniature  copy  of  the  world;  it  binds  the  lower  world  to  the  Divine 
Throne;  it  is  a  way  for  man  to  ascend  to  the  human  throne  [and  receive  that 
manifestation]. 

SECOND MYSTERY 

In order not to overwhelm minds by divine unity, which is apparent in the boundless 
multiplicity of creatures, the Qur’an of  Miraculous Exposition constantly  points out the 
manifestation of divine oneness within divine unity.  For example, the sun  encompasses 
numberless things with its light. A truly extensive conceptual ability and comprehensive 
view  is  necessary  to  behold  the  sun  itself  in  the  totality  of  its  light.  So,  lest  the  sun  be 
forgotten,  it  is  displayed  in  every  shining  object  by  means  of  its  reflection.  And  in 
accordance with their  capacities, all  lustrous objects reflect the sun’s  attributes, such  as 
its light and heat and the seven colours in its light, together with the manifestation of its 
essence. So too, the sun’s attributes encompass all the things facing it.  

In exactly the same way, “And God’s is the highest similitude”2 – but let there be no 
mistake  in  the  comparison  –  just  as  divine  oneness  and  eternal  besoughtedness  have  a 
manifestation  together  with  all  the  divine  names  in  everything,  in  animate  creatures  in 
particular, and especially in man’s mirror-like essence; so too through divine unity each 
of the divine names connected  

                                                
2 Qur’an, 16:60. 

 

20

to beings encompasses all things. Thus, lest minds become overwhelmed by divine unity 
and hearts forget the Most Pure and Holy Essence, the Qur’an constantly draws attention 
to the stamp of divine oneness within divine unity. And that stamp, with its three salient 
points, is “In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.” 

THIRD MYSTERY 

What  makes  this  boundless  universe  rejoice  is  clearly  divine  mercy.  What 
illuminates  these  dark  beings  is  self-evidently  divine  mercy.  What  fosters  and  raises 
creatures struggling with their endless  needs  is self-evidently again divine  mercy.  What 
causes the whole universe to be turned towards man, like a tree together with all its parts 
is turned towards its fruit, and causes it to look to him and run to his assistance is clearly 
divine  mercy.  What  fills  and  illuminates  boundless  space  and  the  empty,  vacant  world 
and makes it rejoice is self-evidently divine mercy. And what designates ephemeral man 
for eternity and makes him the addressee and beloved of the Pre-Eternal and Post-Eternal 
One is self-evidently divine mercy. 

O  man!  Since  divine  mercy  is  such  a  powerful,  inviting,  sweet,  assisting  lovable 
truth, say:  “In the  Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate,” adhere to this truth 
and  be  saved  from  absolute  desolation  and  the  pains  of  unending  needs!  Draw  close  to 
the  throne  of  the  Pre-Eternal  and  Post-Eternal  Monarch,  and  availing  yourself  of  the 
compassionate and rays of divine mercy, become His addressee, friend, and beloved. 

All the realms of beings in the universe being purposively gathered around man, and 
being  made  to  hasten  to  meet  all  his  needs  with  the  utmost  order  and  wisdom  clearly 
arises from one of two situations. Either each realm of beings knows man, obeys him, and 
runs  to  help  him,  which  just  as  it  is  completely  irrational  is  also  impossible  in  many 
respects;  or  an  absolutely  impotent  being  like  man  has  to  possess  the  power  of  the 
mightiest  absolute  sovereign,  or  this  assistance  occurs  through  the  knowledge  of  an 
Absolutely Powerful One behind the veil of the universe. That is to say, it is not that the 
different beings in the universe know man, but that they are the evidences of a Knowing, 
Compassionate One being acquainted with him and knowing him. 

O  man!  Come  to  your  senses!  Is  it  at  all  possible  that  the  All-Glorious  One,  Who 
causes  all  the  varieties  of  creatures  to  turn  towards  you  and  stretch  out  their  hands  to 
assist  you, and to say:  “Here we  are!”  in the  face of  your needs  –  is  it possible that He 
does not know you, is  not acquainted with  you, does not see you? Since He does know 
you, He  informs  you that He knows  you through His  mercy. So  you should know Him 
too, and with respect let Him know that you know Him, and understand with  

 

21

certainty  that  what  subjugates  the  vast  universe  to  an  absolutely  weak,  absolutely 
impotent, absolutely needy, ephemeral, insignificant creature like you, and despatches it 
to assist you, is the truth of divine mercy, which comprises wisdom, favour, knowledge, 
and power. 

Most  certainly,  a  mercy  such  as  this  requires  universal  and  sincere  thanks,  and 
earnest  and  genuine  respect.  Therefore,  say:  “In  the  Name  of  God,  the  Merciful,  the 
Compassionate,”  which  is  the  interpreter  and  expression  of  such  sincere  thanks  and 
genuine  respect.  Make  it  the  means  of  attaining  to the  mercy,  and  an  intercessor  at the 
court of the All-Merciful One. 

The existence and reality of divine mercy is as clear as the sun. For just as a woven 
tapestry  centred  on  one  point  is  formed  by  the  order  and  situation  of  the  threads  of  its 
warp and weft coming from all directions, so too the luminous threads extending from the 
manifestation  of  a  thousand  and  one  divine  names  in  the  vast  sphere  of  the  universe 
weave such a seal of compassionateness, tapestry of clemency, and seal of  benevolence 
within a stamp of mercy that it demonstrates itself to minds more brilliantly than the sun.  
The  Beauteous  All-Merciful  One,  Who  orders the  sun  and  moon,  the  elements  and 
minerals, and plants and animals like the warp and weft of a vast woven tapestry through 
the rays of His thousand and one names, and causes them to serve life; and demonstrates 
His  compassion  through  the  exceedingly  sweet  and  self-sacrificing  compassion  of 
mothers, plant and animal; and subjugates animate creatures to human life, and from this 
demonstrates man’s  importance and a  most lovely  large tapestry of divine dominicality, 
and manifests His brilliant mercy; – that Most Merciful One has, in the face of His own 
absolute  lack  of  need,  made  His  mercy  an  acceptable  intercessor  for  animate  creatures 
and man. 

O man! If you are truly a human being, say: “In the Name of God, the Merciful, the 
Compassionate.” Find that intercessor! For sure, it is clearly, self-evidently, divine mercy 
which, without forgetting or confusing any of them, raises, nurtures, and administers the 
innumerable  plant  and  animal  species  on  the  earth  at  precisely  the  right  time  and  with 
perfect order, wisdom, and beneficence, and stamps the seal of divine oneness on the face 
of the globe of the earth. The existence of divine mercy is as certain as the existence of 
the beings on the face of the earth, so do the beings offer evidences of its reality to their 
own number. 

Just  as  there  is  this  seal  of  mercy  and  stamp  of  divine  oneness  on  the  face  of  the 
earth, so on the face of man’s nature is a stamp of divine mercy that is not inferior to the 
stamp of compassion and vast stamp of mercy on the face of the universe. Simply, man 
has so comprehensive a nature he is as though the point of focus of a thousand and one 
divine names. 

 

22

O man! Is it at all possible that the One Who gives you this face, and places such a 
stamp of mercy and seal of oneness on it would leave you to your own devices, attach no 
importance to you, pay  no attention to your actions,  make the whole universe, which  is 
turned  towards  you,  futile  and  pointless,  and  make  the  tree  of  creation  rotten  and 
insignificant with decayed fruit? Would He cause His mercy to be denied, although it is 
as obvious as the sun, as well as His wisdom, which is as clear as daylight, and neither of 
which can in any way be doubted, nor are in any way deficient? God forbid! 

O man! Understand that there is a way to ascend to the throne of divine mercy, and 
that  is,  “In  the  Name  of  God,  the  Merciful,  the  Compassionate.”  If  you  want  to 
understand  the  importance  of  this  ascent,  look  at the  beginning  of  the  one  hundred  and 
fourteen  suras  of  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition,  and  at  the  beginnings  of  all 
estimable books, and at the start of all good works. A clear proof of the God-determined 
grandeur of “In the Name of God” is that Imam Shafi‘i (May God be pleased with him), 
one of the  very  foremost Islamic  scholars, said:  “In the Name of God, the Merciful, the 
Compassionate is only one verse, yet it was revealed one hundred  and fourteen times in 
the Qur’an.” 

FOURTH MYSTERY 

In  the  face  of  the  manifestation  of  divine  unity  within  boundless  multiplicity, 
declaring: “You alone do we worship” is not sufficient for everyone; the mind wanders. 
One’s heart would have to be as broad as the globe to observe the Single One behind the 
unity in the totality of beings, and to say: “You alone do we worship, and from You alone 
do we seek help.”3 In consequence, so that the seal of divine oneness should be apparent 
on all species and realms of beings just as it is shown clearly on individual objects, and 
that  they  should  call  to  mind  the  Single  One,  it  is  shown  within  the  stamp  of  divine 
mercy.  Thus  everyone  at  every  level  may  turn  to  the  Most  Pure  and  Holy  One,  and 
saying:  “You alone do  we  worship, and from You alone do  we seek help,” address Him 
directly. 

It is in order to express this mighty mystery and clearly point out the seal of divine 
oneness  that  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  suddenly  mentions  the  smallest  sphere  and  most 
particular  matter  when  describing  the  vastest  sphere  of  the  universe,  for  example,  the 
creation of the heavens and the earth. That is, so that the mind does not wander, nor the 
heart  drown,  and  the  spirit  may  find  its  True  Object  of  Worship  directly,  while 
mentioning the creation of the heavens and earth it opens a discussion of man’s creation 
and voice, and the subtle details of the bounties and wisdom in his features, for example. 
This truth is demonstrated in miraculous fashion by the verse,  

                                                
3 Qur’an, 1:5. 

 

23

“And  among  His  signs  is  the  creation  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  and  the 
variations in your languages and in your colours.”4 

Within innumerable creatures and infinite multiplicity, there are stamps of unity like 
concentric circles of many sorts and degrees from the greatest stamp to the smallest. But 
however  clear  the  unity  is,  it  is  still  unity  within  multiplicity;  it  does  not  truly  address 
observers.  It  is  because  of  this  that  there  has  to be  the  stamp  of  divine  oneness  behind 
unity,  that  unity  does  not  call  to  mind  multiplicity,  and  before  the  Most  Pure  and  Holy 
One a way may be opened up to the heart directly. 

Furthermore, a truly captivating design, shining light, agreeable sweetness, pleasing 
beauty,  and  powerful  truth  –  which  is  the  stamp  of  divine  mercy  and  seal  of  divine 
compassion  –  has  been  placed  on  the  stamp  of  divine  oneness  in  order  to  direct  gazes 
towards it and attract hearts. Yes, it is the strength of that mercy that attracts the gazes of 
conscious beings, draws them to it, and causes them to reach the seal of oneness and to 
observe the Single One, and from that to truly manifest the address of “You alone do we 
worship, and from You alone do we seek help.” 

It is because “In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate” is the index of 
Sura al-Fatiha and a concise summary of the Qur’an that it is the sign and interpreter of 
this  mighty  mystery.  The  person  who  clasps  it  may  travel  through  the  levels  of  divine 
mercy. And the person who causes this interpreter to speak may learn about the mysteries 
of divine mercy and behold the lights of divine compassion and pity. 

FIFTH MYSTERY 

There is a Hadith which goes something like this: 

“God created man in the form of the Most Merciful.”5  

It has been interpreted by some Sufis in an extraordinary way, unfitting for the tenets of 
belief. Some of them who were ecstatics even considered man’s spiritual nature to be in 
the form of the All-Merciful. Since ecstatics are mostly  immersed  in contemplation and 
confused,  they  are  perhaps  to  be  excused  in  holding  views  contrary  to  reality.  But  on 
consideration, people in their right senses cannot accept ideas of theirs that are contrary 
to the fundamentals of belief. If they do, they are in error. 

Indeed, the Most Pure and Holy Deity, Who administers with order the  

                                                
4 Qur’an, 30:22. 
5 “Indeed, Allah created Adam in the form of the Most Merciful.” Bukhari, Isti’dhan, 1; Muslim, Birr, 115; 
Musnad, Janna, ii, 22, 244, 251, 315, 323, 434, 463, 519. 

 

24

whole  universe  as  though  it  were  a  palace  or  house,  and  spins  the  stars  as  though  they 
were  particles  and  causes  them  to  travel  through  space  with  wisdom  and  ease,  and 
employs  minute  particles  as  though  they  were  orderly  officials,  has  no  partner,  match, 
opposite, or equal. So too, according to the meaning of the verse: 

“There  is  nothing  whatever  like  unto  Him,  and  He  hears  and  sees  [all 
things],”6 

He  has  no  form,  like,  or  peer,  and  there  is  nothing  resembling  Him  or  similar  to  Him. 
However, according to the meaning of the following verse and its parabolic comparison,  

“And  His  is  the  highest  similitude  in  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  and  He  is 
Exalted in Might, Full of Wisdom,”7 

His  actions,  attributes,  and  names  may  be  considered.  That  is  to  say,  allegory  and 
comparison may be used in connection with His actions. One of the many things intended 
by  the  above-mentioned  Hadith  is:  “Man  is  in  a  form  that  displays  the  divine  name  of 
All-Merciful  in  its  entirety.”  Yes,  as  we  explained  before,  the  divine  name  of  All-
Merciful is manifested through the rays of a thousand and one names on the face of the 
universe,  and  is  apparent  through  the  innumerable  manifestations  of  God’s  absolute 
dominicality on the face of the earth. Similarly, its complete manifestation is apparent in 
a small measure in man’s comprehensive form, the same as on the face of the earth and 
the face of the universe. 

The Hadith suggests also that the evidences of the Necessarily Existent One offered 
by  such  proofs,  mirrors,  and  manifestations  of  the  Most  Merciful  as  animate  creatures 
and man are so certain, clear, and obvious that just as it may be said of a shining mirror 
which reflects the image of the sun: “That mirror is the sun,” indicating the clarity of its 
brilliance and evidence, so it has been said and may be said: “Man is in the form of the 
All-Merciful One,” indicating the clarity of his evidence and completeness of his relation. 
It is in consequence of this mystery that the more moderate of those who believed in the 
Unity of Existence said: “There is no existent but He,” as a way of expressing the clarity 
of this evidence and perfection of the relation. 

O God! O Most Merciful One! Most Compassionate One! For the sake of “In 
the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate” have mercy on us as befits 
Your Compassionateness, and allow us to understand the mysteries of “In the 
Name  of  God,  the  Merciful,  the  Compassionate”  as  befits  Your  Mercifulness.  
AMEN.

SIXTH MYSTERY 

O unhappy man afflicted by a boundless impotence and endless wants! See from the 
following how valuable and acceptable an intercessor is divine mercy. For it is a way to 
know  the  All-Glorious  Sovereign  in  Whose  army  both  the  stars  and  minute  particles 
serve together in perfect order and obedience – the Glorious Monarch of Pre-Eternity and 
Post-Eternity, who is self-sufficient and utterly without need. He is rich without limit and 
in  no  way  in  need  of  the  universe  and  its  beings.  The  whole  cosmos  is  under  His 
command  and direction, utterly obedient beneath  His  majesty  and grandeur, submissive 
before His sublimity. That is divine mercy for you, O man! It raises you to the presence 
of  the  One  who  lacks  all  need,  the  Eternal  Sovereign,  and  makes  you  His  friend, 
addressee, and well-loved servant. But just as you cannot reach the sun and are far from it 
although it fills your mirror with its light, reflection, and manifestation, and you can in no 
way draw  near to it;  in the same way  you are  infinitely distant from the Most Pure and 
Holy One, the Sun of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, and cannot draw near to Him, but 
the light of His mercy brings Him nearer to us.  

O  man!  Anyone who  finds this  mercy  finds  an eternally unfailing treasury of  light. 
And the way to find it is by following the practices of the Most Noble Messenger (Peace 
and  blessings  be  upon  him),  who  was  the  most  brilliant  exemplar  and  representative  of 
mercy, its most eloquent tongue and herald, and was described in the Qur’an as a “Mercy 
to All the Worlds.” 

The way to attain to this embodiment of mercy who is a mercy to all the worlds is to 
utter  the  prayer  calling  down  God’s  blessings  upon  him.  Indeed,  the  meaning  of  this 
prayer is mercy. As a prayer of mercy for that living embodiment of divine mercy, it is a 
means  of  reaching  the  Mercy  to  All  the  Worlds.  So,  make  this  prayer  the  means  to the 
mercy  to  all  the  worlds  for  yourself,  and  at  the  same  time  make  him  the  means  of 
reaching the mercy of the Most Merciful One. 

The  whole  Muslim  community  in  all  its  vastness  uttering  this  prayer  which  is 
synonymous with mercy for the Mercy to All the Worlds proves in brilliant fashion what 
a precious gift is divine mercy, and how broad is its sphere. 

T o  C o n c l u d e : Just as the most precious jewel in the treasury of mercy is the 
Prophet Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him), its doorkeeper, so is its first key 
“In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate,” and its most easy key the prayer 
for the Prophet. 

O  God!  Through  the  truth  of  “In  the  Name  of  God,  the  Merciful,  the 
Compassionate” grant blessings  

 

26

and peace to the one whom You sent as a mercy to all the worlds as befits Your 
mercy, and in veneration of him, and to all his Family and Companions. And 
grant us mercy so as to make us free of want for the mercy of any other than 
You from among Your creatures.  AMEN. 

Glory be unto You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught us. 
Indeed, You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.8 

                                                
8 Qur’an, 2:32.

The Second Word 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
Those who believe in the Unseen.1 

If you want to understand what great happiness and bounty, what great pleasure and 
ease  are  to  be  found  in  belief  in  God,  listen  to  this  story  which  is  in  the  form  of  a 
comparison: 

One time, two men went on a journey for both pleasure and business. One set off in a 

selfish, inauspicious direction, and the other on a godly, propitious way. 

Since the selfish man was both conceited, self-centred, and pessimistic, he ended up 
in  what  seemed  to  him  to  be  a  most  wicked  country  due  to  his  pessimism.  He  looked 
around and everywhere saw the powerless and the unfortunate lamenting in the grasp of 
fearsome  bullying  tyrants,  weeping  at  their  destruction.  He  saw  the  same  grievous, 
painful situation in all the places he travelled. The whole country took on the form of a 
house  of  mourning.  Apart  from  becoming  drunk,  he  could  find  no  way  of  not  noticing 
this  grievous  and  sombre  situation.  For  everyone  seemed  to  him  to  be  an  enemy  and 
foreign.  And  all  around  he  saw  horrible  corpses  and  despairing,  weeping  orphans.  His 
conscience was in a state of torment. 

The  other  man  was  godly,  devout,  fair-minded,  and  with  fine  morals  so  that  the 
country  he  came  to  was  most  excellent  in  his  view.  This  good  man  saw  universal 
rejoicing  in  the  land  he  had  entered.  Everywhere  was  a  joyful  festival,  a  place  for  the 
remembrance of God overflowing with rapture and happiness; everyone seemed to him a 
friend  and relation. Throughout the country  he saw the  festive celebrations of a general 
discharge from duties accompanied by cries of good wishes and thanks. He also heard the 
sound of a drum and band for the enlistment of soldiers with happy calls of “God is Most 
Great!” and “There is no god but God!” Rather than being grieved at the suffering of both 
himself  and  all  the  people  like  the  first  miserable  man,  this  fortunate  man  was  pleased 
and happy at both his own joy and that of all the inhabitants. Furthermore, he was able to 
do some profitable trade. He offered thanks to God. 

                                                
1 Qur’an, 2:3.

After  some  while  he  returned  and  came  across  the  other  man.  He  understood  his 
condition, and said to him:  “You were out of  your  mind. The ugliness within  you  must 
have been reflected on the outer world so that you imagined laughter to be weeping, and 
the  discharge  from  duties  to  be  sack  and  pillage.  Come  to  your  senses  and  purify  your 
heart so that this calamitous veil is raised from your eyes and you can see the truth. For 
the country of an utterly just, compassionate, beneficent, powerful, order-loving, and kind 
king could not be as you imagined, nor could a country which demonstrated this number 
of clear signs of progress and achievement.” The unhappy  man  later came to his senses 
and repented. He said, “Yes, I was crazy through drink. May God be pleased with  you, 
you have saved me from a hellish state.” 

O my soul! Know that the first man represents an unbeliever, or someone depraved 
and heedless. In his view the world is a house of universal mourning. All living creature 
are orphans weeping at the blows of death and separation. Man and the animals are alone 
and  without ties  being  ripped  apart  by  the  talons  of  the  appointed  hour.  Mighty  beings 
like  the  mountains  and  oceans  are  like  horrendous,  lifeless  corpses.  Many  grievous, 
crushing,  terrifying  delusions  like  these  arise  from  his  unbelief  and  misguidance,  and 
torment him.  

As for the other man, he is a believer. He recognizes and affirms Almighty God. In 
his view this world is an abode where the Names of the All-Merciful One are constantly 
recited, a place of instruction for man and the animals, and a field of examination for man 
and jinn. All animal and human deaths are a demobilization. Those who have completed 
their  duties  of  life  depart  from  this  transient  world  for  another,  happy  and  trouble-free, 
world  so  that  place  may  be  made  for  new  officials  to  come  and  work.  The  birth  of 
animals and humans marks their enlistment into the army, their being taken under arms, 
and  the  start  of  their  duties.  Each  living  being  is  a  joyful  regular  soldier,  an  honest, 
contented official. And all voices are either glorification of God and the recitation of His 
Names at the outset of their duties, and the thanks and rejoicing at their ceasing work, or 
the songs arising from their joy at working. In the view of the believer, all beings are the 
friendly servants, amicable officials, and agreeable books of his Most Generous Lord and 
All-Compassionate  Owner.  Very  many  more  subtle,  exalted,  pleasurable,  and  sweet 
truths like these become manifest and appear from his belief. 

That  is  to  say,  belief  in  God  bears  the  seed  of  what  is  in  effect  a  Tuba-Tree  of 

Paradise, while unbelief conceals the seed of a Zakkum-Tree of Hell. 

That  means  that  salvation  and  security  are  only  to  be  found  in  Islam  and  belief.  In 
which  case,  we  should  continually  say,  “Praise  be  to  God  for the  religion  of  Islam  and 
perfect belief.”

The Third Word 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
O you people, worship...1 

If  you want to understand what great profit and  happiness  lie  in worship, and what 
great loss and ruin lie in vice and dissipation listen to and take heed of the following story 
which is in the form of a comparison: 

One time, two soldiers received orders to proceed to a distant city. They set off and 
travelled together until the road  forked. At the  fork was a  man who said to them,  “The 
road on the right causes no loss at all, and nine out of ten of those who take it receive a 
high profit and experience great ease. While the road on the left provides no advantages, 
and nine out of ten of its travellers make a loss. But they are the same as regards distance. 
Only there is one difference: those who take the left-hand road, which has no rules and no 
one  in  authority,  travel  without  baggage  and  arms.  They  feel  an  apparent  lightness  and 
deceptive ease. Whereas those travelling on the right-hand road, which is under military 
order, are compelled to carry a kit-bag full of nutritious rations four okkas or so in weight 
and  a  superb  army  rifle  of  about  two  kıyyes2  which  will  overpower  and  rout  every 
enemy...” 

After  the  two  soldiers  had  listened  to  what  this  instructive  man  had  to  say,  the 
fortunate  one  took  the  road  to  the  right.  He  loaded  the  weight  of  one  batman  onto  his 
back, but his heart and spirit were saved from thousands of batmans of fear and feeling 
obliged to others. As for the other, luckless, soldier, he left the army. He did not want to 
conform to the order, and he went off to the left. He was released from bearing a load of 
one batman, but his heart was constricted by thousands of batmans of indebtedness, and 
his  spirit  crushed  by  innumerable  fears.  He  proceeded  on  his  way  both  begging  from 
everyone  and  trembling  before  every  object  and  every  event  until  he  reached  his 
destination. And there he was punished as a mutineer and a deserter. 

                                                
1 Qur’an, 2:21. 
2 1 okka = approx. 2.8 lbs. or 1,300 grams. Kıyye, another name for okka. 1 batman = 2 - 8 okkas or 5 - 30 
lbs. [Tr.] 

 

30

As for the soldier who loved the order of the army, had guarded his kit-bag and rifle, 
and taken the right-hand road, he had gone on his way being obliged to no one, fearing no 
one,  and  with  an  easy  heart  and  conscience  until  he  reached  the  city  he  was  seeking. 
There he received a reward worthy of an honourable soldier who had carried out his duty 
faithfully. 

O rebellious soul, know that one of those two travellers represents those who submit 
to the Divine Law, while the other represents the rebellious and those who  follow their 
own  desires.  The  road  is  the  road  of  life,  which  comes  from  the  Spirit  World,  passes 
through the  grave,  and  carries  on  to the  hereafter.  As  for the  kit-bag  and  rifle,  they  are 
worship and fear of God. There is an apparent burden in worship, but there is an ease and 
lightness  in  its  meaning  that  defies  description.  For  in  the  prescribed  prayers  the 
worshipper declares, “I bear witness that there is no god but God.” That is to say, he finds 
the door of a treasury of mercy in everything because he is believing and saying, “There 
is no Creator and Provider other than Him. Harm and benefit are in His hand. He is both 
All-Wise; He does nothing in vain, and He is All-Compassionate; His bounty and mercy 
are abundant.” And he knocks on the door with his supplication. Moreover, he sees that 
everything is subjugated to the command of his own Sustainer, so he takes refuge in Him. 
He places his trust in Him and relies on Him, and is fortified against every disaster; his 
belief gives him complete confidence. 

Indeed,  like  with  every  true  virtue,  the  source  of  courage  is  belief  in  God,  and 

worship. And as with every iniquity, the source of cowardice is misguidance. 

In fact, for a worshipper with a truly illuminated heart, it is possible that even if the 
globe  of  the  earth  became  a  bomb  and  exploded,  it  would  not  frighten  him.  He  would 
watch it with pleasurable wonder as a marvel of the Eternally Besought One’s power. But 
when  a  famous  degenerate  philosopher  with  a  so-called  enlightened  mind  but  no  heart 
saw a comet in the sky, he trembled on the ground, and exclaimed anxiously:  “Isn’t that 
comet going to hit the earth?” (On one occasion, America was quaking with fear at such a 
comet, and many people left their homes in the middle of the night.) 

Yes,  although  man  is  in  need  of  numberless  things,  his  capital  is  as  nothing,  and 
although  he  is  subject  to  endless  calamities,  his  power  too  is  as  nothing.  Simply,  his 
capital and power extend only as far as his hand can reach. However, his hopes, desires, 
pains,  and  tribulations  reach  as  far  as  the  eye  and  the  imagination  can  stretch.  Anyone 
who  is  not totally  blind can see and understand then what a great profit, happiness, and 
bounty  for the  human  spirit,  which  is  thus  impotent  and  weak,  and  needy  and  wanting, 
are worship, affirmation of God’s unity, and reliance on God and submission to Him. 

 

31

It is obvious that a safe way is preferable to a harmful way, even if the possibility of 
its safety is only one in ten. But on the way of worship, which our matter here, there is a 
nine out of ten possibility of it leading to the treasury of eternal happiness, as well as its 
being safe. While it is established by the testimony –which is at the degree of consensus– 
of innumerable experts and witnesses that besides being without benefit, and the dissolute 
even confess to this, the way of vice and dissipation ends in eternal misery. According to 
the  reports  of  those  who  have  uncovered  the  mysteries  of  creation  this  is  absolutely 
certain. 

In Short: Like that of the hereafter, happiness in this world lies in worship and being 
a soldier for Almighty God. In which case, we should constantly say:  “Praise be to God 
for obedience to him and success,” and we should thank Him that we are Muslims.

The Fourth Word 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
The prescribed prayers are the pillar of religion.1 

If you want to understand with the certainty that two plus two equals four just how 
valuable and  important are the prescribed prayers, and with what little expense they are 
gained, and how crazy and harmful is the person who neglects them, pay attention to the 
following story which is in the form of a comparison: 

One  time,  a  mighty  ruler  gave  each  of  two of  his  servants  twenty-four  gold  pieces 
and sent them to settle on one of his rich, royal farms two months’ distance away. “Use 
this  money  for  your  tickets,”  he  commanded  them,  “and  buy  whatever  is  necessary  for 
your house there with it. There is a station one day’s distance from the farm. And there is 
both road-transport, and a railway, and boats, and aeroplanes. They can be benefited from 
according to your capital.” 

The two servants set off after receiving these instructions. One of them was fortunate 
so that he spent a small amount of money on the way to the station. And included in that 
expense  was  some  business  so  profitable  and  pleasing  to  his  master  that  his  capital 
increased a thousandfold. As for the other servant, since he was luckless and a layabout, 
he spent twenty-three pieces of gold on the way to the station, wasting it on gambling and 
amusements. A single gold piece remained. His friend said to him: “Spend this last gold 
piece on a ticket so that you will not have to walk the long journey and starve. Moreover, 
our master is generous; perhaps he will take pity on you and forgive you your faults, and 
put you on an aeroplane as well. Then we shall reach where we are going to live in one 
day.  Otherwise  you  will  be  compelled  to  walk  alone  and  hungry  across  a  desert  which 
takes two  months  to  cross.”  The  most  unintelligent  person  can  understand  how  foolish, 
harmful,  and  senseless  he  would  be  if  out  of  obstinacy  he  did  not  spend  that  single 
remaining gold piece on a ticket, which is like the key to a treasury, and instead spent it 
on vice for passing pleasure. Is that not so? 

                                                
1 Tirmidhi, Iman, 8; Ibn Maja, Fitan, 12; Musnad, v, 231; al-Hakim, al-Mustadrak, ii, 76. 

 

33

O you who do not perform the prescribed prayers! And O my own soul, which does 
not  like  to  pray!  The  ruler  in  the  comparison  is  our  Sustainer,  our  Creator.  Of  the  two 
travelling servants, one represents the devout who perform their prayers with fervour, and 
the other, the heedless who neglect their prayers. The twenty-four pieces of gold are life 
in every twenty-four-hour day. And the royal domain is Paradise. As for the station, it is 
the grave. And the journey is man’s passage to the grave, and on to the resurrection and 
the hereafter. Men cover that long journey to different degrees according to their actions 
and the strength of their fear of God. Some of the truly devout have crossed a thousand-
year  distance  in  a  day  like  lightning.  And  some  have  traversed  a  fifty-thousand-year 
distance in a day with the speed of imagination. The Qur’an of Mighty Stature alludes to 
this truth with two of its verses.2 

The ticket in the comparison represents the prescribed prayers. A single hour a day is 
sufficient for the five prayers together with taking the ablutions. So what a loss a person 
makes who spends twenty-three hours on this fleeting worldly life, and fails to spend one 
hour on the long life of the hereafter; how he wrongs his own self; how unreasonably he 
behaves. For would not anyone who considers himself to be reasonable understand how 
contrary to reason and wisdom  such a person’s conduct is, and  how far  from reason  he 
has become, if, thinking it reasonable, he gives  half of his property to a lottery in which 
one thousand people are participating and the possibility of winning is one in a thousand, 
and does  not give one twenty-fourth of  it to an eternal treasury where the possibility of 
winning has been verified at ninety-nine out of a hundred? 

Moreover, the spirit, the heart, and the mind find great ease in prayer. And it is not 
trying  for the body.  Furthermore, with the right  intention, all the other acts of someone 
who performs the prescribed prayers become like worship. He can make over the whole 
capital of his life to the hereafter in this way. He can make his transient life permanent in 
one respect. 

                                                
2 See, “Said one of them: ‘How long have we stayed there?’ They said: ‘We have stayed [perhaps] a day, or 
part of a day.’”(18:19), and, “So they stayed in their cave three hundred years, and [some] add nine 
[more].”(18:25)

The Fifth Word 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
Indeed, God is with those who fear Him and those who do good.1 

If you want to see what a truly human duty and what a natural, appropriate result of 
man’s  creation  it  is  to  perform  the  prescribed  prayers  and  not  to  commit  serious  sins, 
listen to and take heed of the following comparison: 

Once, at a time of general mobilization, two soldiers found themselves together in a 
regiment.  One  was  well-trained  and  conscientious,  the  other,  a  raw  recruit  and  self-
centred. The conscientious soldier concentrated on training and the war, and did not give 
a thought to rations and provisions,  for he knew that  it was the state’s duty to feed and 
equip him, treat him if he was ill, and even to put the food in his mouth if the need arose. 
He knew that his essential duty was to train and fight. But he would also attend to some 
of the rations and equipment as part of his work. He would boil up the saucepans, wash 
up  the  mess-tins,  and  bring  them.  If  it  was  then  asked  him:  “What  are  you  doing?”,  he 
would reply: “I am doing fatigue duty for the state.” He would not say: “I am working for 
my living.” 

The raw recruit, however, was fond of his stomach and paid no attention to training 
and the war. “That is the state’s business. What is it to me?”, he would say. He thought 
constantly  of  his  livelihood,  and  pursuing  it  would  leave  the  regiment  and  go  to  the 
market to do shopping. One day his well-trained friend said to him: 

“Your  basic  duty  is  training  and  fighting,  brother.  You  were  brought  here  for  that. 
Trust  in  the  king;  he  will  not  let  you  go  hungry.  That  is  his  duty.  Anyway,  you  are 
powerless  and  wanting;  you  cannot  feed  yourself  everywhere.  And  this  is  a  time  of 
mobilization  and  war;  he  will  tell  you  that  you  are  mutinous  and  will  punish  you.  Yes, 
there  are  two  duties  which  concern  us.  One  is  the  king’s  duty:  sometimes  we  do  his 
fatigue duties and he  feeds us  for it. The other is our duty: that is training and  fighting, 
and sometimes the king helps us with it.” 

                                                
1 Qur’an, 16:128. 

 

35

Of course you will understand in what danger the layabout soldier would be if he did 

not pay attention to the striving, well-trained one. 

O my lazy soul! That turbulent place of war is this stormy worldly life, and the army 
divided into regiments, human society. The regiment in the comparison is the community 
of  Islam  in  this  century.  One  of  the  two  soldiers  is  a  devout  Muslim  who  knows  the 
obligations of his religion and performs them, and struggles with Satan and his own soul 
in  order  to  give  up  serious  misdoings  and  not  to  commit  sins.  While  the  other  is  a 
degenerate  wrongdoer  who  is  so  immersed  in  the  struggle  for  livelihood  that  he  casts 
aspersions on the True Provider, abandons his religious obligations, and commits any sins 
that  come  his  way  as  he  makes  his  living.  As  for  the  training  and  instruction,  it  is 
foremost the prescribed prayers and worship. And the war is the struggle against the soul 
and its desires, and against the satans among jinn and men, to deliver them from sin and 
bad morals, and save the heart and spirit from eternal perdition. And the first of the two 
duties  is to give  life and  sustain  it, while the other  is to worship and  beseech the Giver 
and Sustainer of life. It is to trust in Him and rely on Him. 

Indeed,  whoever  made  and  bestowed  life,  which  is  a  most  brilliant  miracle  of  the 
Eternally  Besought  One’s  art  and  a  wonder  of  dominical  wisdom,  is  the  one  who 
maintains  and  perpetuates  it  through  sustenance.  It  cannot  be  another.  Do  you  want 
proof? The most impotent and stupid animals are the best nourished; like fish, and worms 
in fruit. And it is the most helpless and delicate creatures who have the choicest food; like 
infants and the young of all species.  

For  sure,  it  is  enough  to  compare  fish  with  foxes,  newly  born  animals  with  wild 
beasts,  and  trees  with  animals  in  order  to  understand  that  licit  food  is  obtained  not 
through power and will, but through impotence and helplessness. That is to say, someone 
who  gives  up  performing  the  prescribed  prayers  because  of  the  struggle  for  livelihood 
resembles the soldier who abandoned his training and trench and went and begged in the 
market. But to seek ones rations from the kitchens of the All-Generous Provider’s mercy 
after performing the prayers, and to go oneself so as not to be a burden on others is fine 
and manly. It too is a sort of worship.  

Furthermore, man’s nature and spiritual faculties show that he is created for worship. 
For  in  respect  of  the  power  and  actions  necessary  for  the  life  of  this  world,  he  cannot 
compete  with  the  most  inferior  sparrow.  While  in  respect  of  knowledge  and  need,  and 
worship  and  supplication,  which  are  necessary  for  spiritual  life  and  the  life  of  the 
hereafter, he is like the monarch and commander of the animals. 

O  my  soul!  If  you  make  the  life  of  this  world  the  aim  of  your  life  and  work 

constantly for that, you will become like the lowest sparrow. But if  

 

36

you  make the  life of the  hereafter  your aim and end, and  make this  life the  means of  it 
and its tillage, and strive in accordance with it, then you will be like a lofty commander 
of  the  animals,  and  a  petted  and  suppliant  servant of  Almighty  God,  and  His  honoured 
and respected guest. 

Those are the two ways open to you! You can choose whichever you wish... So ask 

for guidance and success from the Most Compassionate of the Compassionate. 

 

37

The Sixth Word 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
Verily God has purchased from the believers their persons and their property 
that Paradise might be theirs.1 

If you wish to understand how profitable a trade it is, and how honour-able a rank, to 
sell one’s person and property to God, to be His slave and His soldier, then listen to the 
following comparison. 

Once  a  king  entrusted  each  of  two  of  his  subjects  with  an  estate,  including  all 
necessary  workshops,  machinery,  horses,  weapons  and  so  forth.  But  since  it  was  a 
tempestuous  and  war-ridden  age,  nothing  enjoyed  stability;  it  was  destined  either  to 
disappear or to change. The king in his infinite mercy sent a most noble lieutenant to the 
two men and by means of a compassionate decree conveyed the following to them: 

“Sell me the property you now hold in trust, so that I may keep it for you. Let it not 
be  destroyed  for  no  purpose.  After the  wars  are  over,  I  will  return  it  to  you  in  a  better 
condition than before. I will regard the trust as your property and pay you a high price for 
it. As for the machinery and the tools in the workshop, they will be used in my name and 
at  my  workbench.  But  the  price  and  the  fee  for  their  use  shall  be  increased  a 
thousandfold.  You  will  receive  all  the  profit  that  accrues.  You  are  indigent  and 
resourceless,  and  unable  to  provide  the  cost  of  these  great  tasks.  So  let  me  assume  the 
provision of all expenses and equipment, and give you all the income and the profit. You 
shall  keep  it  until  the  time  of  demobilization.  So  see  the  five  ways  in  which  you  shall 
profit! Now if you do not sell me the property, you can see that no one is able to preserve 
what he possesses, and you too will lose what you now hold. It will go for nothing, and 
you  will  lose  the  high  price  I  offer.  The  delicate  and  precious  tools  and  scales,  the 
precious metals waiting to be used, will also lose all value. You will have the trouble and 
concern of administering and preserving, but at the same time be punished for betraying 
your trust. So see the five ways in which you may lose! Moreover, if you sell the property 
to  me,  you  become  my  soldier  and  act  in  my  name.  Instead  of  a  common  prisoner  or 
irregular soldier, you will be the free lieutenant of an exalted monarch.” 

                                                
1 Qur’an, 9:111. 

 

said: 

38

After they  had  listened to this gracious decree, the  more  intelligent of the two men 

“By all means, I am proud and happy to sell. I offer thanks a thousandfold.” 
But the other was arrogant, selfish and dissipated; his  soul had become as proud as 
the Pharaoh. As if he was to stay eternally on that estate, he ignored the earthquakes and 
tumults of this world. He said: 

“No! Who is the king? I won’t sell my property, nor spoil my enjoyment.” 
After a short time, the first man reached so high a rank that everyone envied his state. 
He received the favour of the king, and lived happily in the king’s own palace. The other 
by contrast fell into such a state that everyone pitied him, but also said he deserved it. For 
as a result of his error, his happiness and property departed, and he suffered punishment 
and torment. 

O soul full of caprices! Look at the face of truth through the telescope of this parable. 
As for the king, he is the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, your Sustainer and 
Creator. The estates, machinery, tools and scales are your possessions while in life’s fold; 
your body, spirit and heart within those possessions, and your outward and inward senses 
such  as  the  eye  and  the  tongue,  intelligence  and  imagination.  As  for  the  most  noble 
lieutenant,  it  is  the  Noble  Messenger  of  God;  and  the  most  wise  decree  is  the  Wise 
Qur’an, which describes the trade we are discussing in this verse: 

Verily God has purchased from the believers their persons and property that Paradise 

might be theirs. 

The surging field of battle is the tempestuous surface of the world, which ceaselessly 

changes, dissolves and reforms and causes every man to think: 

“Since  everything  will  leave  our  hands,  will  perish  and  be  lost,  is  there  no  way  in 

which we can transform it into something eternal and preserve it?” 

While engaged in these thoughts, he suddenly hears the heavenly voice of the Qur’an 

saying: 

“Indeed there is, a beautiful and easy way which contains five profits within itself.” 
What is that way? 
To sell the trust received back to its true owner. Such a sale yields profit fivefold. 
The First Profit:  Transient property becomes everlasting. For this waning life, when 
given  to  the  Eternal  and  Self-Subsistent  Lord  of  Glory  and  spent  for  His  sake,  will  be 
transmuted  into  eternity.  It  will  yield  eternal  fruits.  The  moments  of  one’s  life  will 
apparently vanish and rot like kernels and seeds. But then the flowers of blessedness and 
auspiciousness will open and bloom in the realm of eternity, and each will also present a 
luminous and reassuring aspect in the Intermediate Realm. 

The Second Profit:  The high price of Paradise is given in exchange. 

 

39

The  Third  Profit:    The  value  of  each  limb  and  each  sense  is  increased  a 
thousandfold.  The  intelligence  is,  for  example,  like  a  tool.  If  you  do  not  sell  it  to  God 
Almighty,  but  rather  employ  it  for  the  sake  of  the  soul,  it  will  become  an  ill-omened, 
noxious and debilitating tool that will burden your weak person with all the sad sorrows 
of  the  past  and  the  terrifying  fears  of  the  future;  it  will  descend  to  the  rank  of  an 
inauspicious  and  destructive  tool.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  a  sinful  man  will  frequently 
resort to drunkenness or frivolous pleasure in order to escape the vexations and injuries of 
his intelligence. But if you sell your intelligence to its True Owner and employ it on His 
behalf, then it will become like the key to a talisman, unlocking the infinite treasures of 
compassion  and the  vaults of wisdom that creation  contains. It will thus rise to being a 
dominical guide preparing its owner for eternal bliss. 

To take another example, the eye is one of the senses, a window through which the 
spirit looks out on this world. If you do not sell it to God Almighty, but rather employ it 
on behalf of the soul,  by gazing upon a  handful  of transient,  impermanent beauties and 
scenes, it will sink to the level of being a pander to lust and the concupiscent soul. But if 
you sell the eye to your All-Seeing Maker, and employ it on His behalf and within limits 
traced out  by  Him,  then  your  eye  will  rise  to the  rank  of  a  reader  of  the  great  book of 
being, a witness to the miracles of dominical art, a blessed bee sucking on the blossoms 
of mercy in the garden of this globe. 

Yet another example is that of the tongue and the sense of taste. If you do not sell it 
to your Wise Creator, but employ it instead on behalf of the soul and for the sake of the 
stomach, it sinks and declines to the level of a gatekeeper at the stable of the stomach, a 
watchman  at  its  factory.  But  if  you  sell  it  to  the  Generous  Provider,  the  sense  of  taste 
contained  in  the  tongue  will  rise  to  the  rank  of  a  skilled  overseer  of  the  treasuries  of 
Divine compassion, a grateful inspector in the kitchens of God’s eternal power. 

So look well, O intelligence! See the difference between a tool of destruction and the 
key to all  being!  And  look carefully, O eye! See  the difference  between an abominable 
pander and the learned overseer of the Divine library! And taste well, O tongue! See the 
difference between a stable doorkeeper or a factory watchman and the superintendent of 
the treasury of God’s mercy! 

Compare all other tools and limbs to these, and then you will understand that in truth 
the believer acquires a nature worthy of Paradise and the unbeliever a nature conforming 
to Hell. The reason for each of them attaining his respective value is that the believer, by 
virtue of his faith, uses the trust of his Creator on His behalf and within the limits traced 
out by Him, whereas the unbeliever  betrays the trust and employs  it  for the sake of the 
instinctual soul. 

The  Fourth  Profit:    Man  is  helpless  and  exposed  to  numerous  misfortunes.  He  is 

indigent, and his needs are numerous. He is weak, and the  

 

40

burden of life is most heavy. If he does not rely on the Omnipotent One of Glory, place 
his trust in Him and confidently submit to Him, his conscience will always be troubled. 
Fruitless  torments,  pains  and  regrets  will  suffocate  him  and  intoxicate  him,  or turn  him 
into a beast. 

The  Fifth  Profit:    Those  who  have  experienced  illumination  and  had  unveiled  to 
them the true nature of things, the elect who have witnessed the truth, are all agreed that 
the  exalted  reward  for  all  the  worship  and  glorification  of  God  performed  by  your 
members and instruments will be given to you at the time of greatest need, in the form of 
the fruits of Paradise. 

If  you  spurn  this  trade  with  its  fivefold  profit,  in  addition  to  being  deprived  of  its 

profit, you will suffer fivefold loss. 

The First Loss:  The property and offspring to which you are so attached, the soul 
and its caprice that you worship, the youth and life with which you are infatuated, all will 
vanish  and  be  lost;  your  hands  will  be  empty.  But they  will  leave  behind  them  sin  and 
pain, fastened on your neck like a yoke. 

The  Second  Loss:    You  will  suffer  the  penalty  for  betrayal  of  trust.  For  you  will 
have  wronged  your  own  self  by  using  the  most  precious  tools  on  the  most  worthless 
objects. 

The Third Loss:  By casting down all the precious faculties of man to a level much 

inferior to the animals, you will have insulted and transgressed against God’s wisdom. 

The Fourth Loss:   In  your weakness and poverty,  you will  have placed the  heavy 
burden of life on your weak shoulders, and will constantly groan and lament beneath the 
blows of transience and separation. 

The Fifth Loss:  You will have clothed in an ugly form, fit to open the gates of Hell 
in front of you, the fair gifts of the Compassionate One such as the intelligence, the heart, 
the  eye  and  the  tongue,  given  to  you  to  make  preparation  for  the  foundations  of 
everlasting life and eternal happiness in the hereafter. 

Now is it so difficult to sell the trust? Is it so burdensome that many people shun the 
transaction?  By  no  means!  It  is  not  in  the  least  burdensome.  For  the  limits  of  the 
permissible  are  broad,  and  are  quite  adequate  for  man’s  desire;  there  is  no  need  to 
trespass on the forbidden. The duties imposed by God are light and few in number. To be 
the slave and soldier of God is an indescribably pleasurable honour. One’s duty is simply 
to act and embark on all things in God’s name, like a soldier; to take and to give on God’s 
behalf; to move and be still in accordance with His permission and law. If one falls short, 
then one should seek His forgiveness, say: 

“O Lord! Forgive our faults, and accept us as Your slaves. Make us sure holders of 
Your trust until the time comes when it is taken from us. Amen!”, and make petition unto 
Him.

The Seventh Word 

If  you  want to  understand  what  valuable,  difficulty-resolving  talismans  are  the  two 
parts of the phrase “I believe in God and the Last Day,” which solve both the enigmatical 
riddle  of  creation  and  open  the  door  of  happiness  for  the  human  spirit,  and  what 
beneficial and curative medicines are reliance on your Creator and taking refuge in Him 
through patience and entreaty, and supplicating  your Provider through thanks, and what 
important,  precious,  shining  tickets  for  the  journey  to  eternity  –  and  provisions  for  the 
hereafter  and  lights  for  the  grave  –  are  listening  to the  Qur’an,  obeying  its  commands, 
performing  the  prescribed  prayers,  and  giving  up  serious  sins,  then  listen  and  pay 
attention to this comparison: 

One  time  a  soldier  fell  into  a  most  grave  situation  in  the  field  of  battle  and 

examination, and the round of profit and loss. It was as follows: 

The  soldier  was  wounded  with  two  deep  and  terrible  wounds  on  his  right  and  left 
sides and behind him stood a huge lion as though waiting to attack him. Before him stood 
a gallows which was putting to death and annihilating all those he loved. It was awaiting 
him  too.  Besides  this,  he  had  a  long  journey  before  him:  he  was  being  exiled.  As  the 
unfortunate soldier pondered over his fearsome plight in despair, a kindly person shining 
with  light  like  Khidr  appeared.  He  said  to  him:  “Do  not  despair.  I  shall  give  you  two 
talismans  and  teach  you  them.  If  you  use  them  properly,  the  lion  will  become  a  docile 
horse  for  you,  and  the  gallows  will  turn  into  a  swing  for  your  pleasure  and  enjoyment. 
Also I shall give you two medicines. If you follow the instructions, those two suppurating 
wounds  will  be  transformed  into  two  sweet-scented  flowers  called  the  Rose  of 
Muhammad (PBUH). Also, I shall give you a ticket; with it, you will be able to make a 
year’s  journey  in a day as though  flying. If  you do not believe  me, experiment a bit, so 
that you can see it is true.” The soldier did experiment a bit, and affirmed that it was true. 
Yes,  I,  that  is,  this  unfortunate  Said,  affirm  it  too.  For  I  experimented  and  saw  it  was 
absolutely true.  

Some time later he saw a sly, debauched-looking man, cunning as the Devil, coming 
from  the  left  bringing  with  him  much  ornamented  finery,  decorated  pictures  and 
fantasies, and many intoxicants. He stopped before the soldier, and said: 

 

42

“Hey, come on, my friend! Let’s go and drink and make merry. We can look at these 
pictures  of  beautiful  girls,  listen  to the  music,  and  eat  this  tasty  food.”    Then  he  asked 
him: “What is it you are reciting under your breath?” 

“A talisman,” came the reply. 
“Stop  that  incomprehensible  nonsense!  Let’s  not  spoil  our  present  fun!”  And  he 

asked a second question: “What is that you have in your hand?” 

“Some medicine,” the soldier replied. 
“Throw it away! You are healthy, there is nothing wrong with you. It is the time of 

cheer.” And he asked: “What is that piece of paper with five marks on it?” 

“It is a ticket and a rations card.” 
“Oh, tear them up!”, the man said. “What need do we have of a journey this beautiful 
spring?” He tried to persuade him with every sort of wile, and the poor soldier was even a 
bit persuaded. Yes, man can be deceived. I was deceived by just such cunning deceptions. 
Suddenly  from  the  right  came  a  voice  like  thunder.  “Beware!”,  it  said.  “Do  not  be 
deceived! Say to that trickster: ‘If you have the means to kill the lion behind me, remove 
the  gallows  from  before  me,  repulse  the  things  wounding  my  right  and  my  left,  and 
prevent the journey in front of me, then come on and do so! Show that you can and let us 
see it! Then say, come on, let’s go and enjoy ourselves. Otherwise be silent!’ Speak in the 
same way as that Khidr-like God-inspired man.” 

O my soul, which laughed in its youth and now weeps at its laughter! Know that the 
unfortunate soldier is you, and man. The lion is the appointed hour. As for the gallows, it 
is death, decline, and separation, through which,  in the alternation of  night and day, all 
friends  bid  farewell  and  are  lost.  Of  the  two  wounds,  one  is  man’s  infinite  and 
troublesome impotence, while the other is his grievous and boundless poverty. The exile 
and  journey  is  the  long  journey  of  examination  which  passes  from  the  world  of  spirits 
through  the  womb  and  childhood  to  old  age;  through  the  world  and  the  grave  and  the 
intermediate realm, to the resurrection and the Bridge of Sirat. As for the two talismans, 
they are belief in Almighty God and the hereafter. 

 Yes,  through  the  second  sacred  talisman,  death  takes  on  the  form  of  a  mastered 
horse,  a  steed  to  take  believing  man  from  the  prison  of  this  world  to  the  gardens  of 
Paradise  and  the  presence  of  the  Most  Merciful  One.  It  is  because  of  this  that the  wise 
who  have  seen  death’s  reality  have  loved  it.  They  have  wanted  it  before  it  came.  And 
through  the  talisman  of  belief  in  God,  the  passage  of  time,  which  is  decline  and 
separation, death and decease and the gallows, takes on the form of the means to observe 
and contemplate with perfect pleasure the miracles of the All-Glorious Maker’s various, 
mul 

 

43

ticoloured, ever-renewed embroideries, the wonders of His power, and the manifestations 
of His mercy. Yes, when mirrors reflecting the colours of the sun’s light are changed and 
renewed,  and  the  images  of  the  cinema  changed,  better,  more  beautiful  scenes  are 
formed.  

As for the two medicines, one is trusting in God and patience, and the other is relying 
on  the  power  of  one’s  Creator  and  having  confidence  in  His  wisdom.  Is  that  the  case? 
Indeed  it  is.  What  fear  can  a  man  have,  who,  through  the  certificate  of  his  impotence, 
relies on a Monarch of the World with the power to command: “Be!’ and it is.”1 For in 
the face of the worst calamity, he says: “Verily, to God do we belong, and verily to Him 
is our return,”2 and places his trust in his Most Compassionate Sustainer. A person with 
knowledge  of  God  takes  pleasure  from  impotence,  from  fear  of  God.  Yes,  there  is 
pleasure in fear. If a twelve-month baby were sufficiently intelligent to be asked: “What 
is  most  pleasurable  and  sweetest  for  you?”,  he  might  well  say:  “To  realize  my 
powerlessness  and  helplessness,  and  fearing  my  mother’s  gentle  smack  to  at  the  same 
time take refuge in her tender breast.” But the compassion of all mothers is but a flash of 
the  manifestation  of  Divine  mercy.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  the  wise  have  found  such 
pleasure in impotence and fear of God, vehemently declaring themselves to be free of any 
strength  and  power,  and  have  taken  refuge  in  God  through  their  powerlessness.  They 
have made powerlessness and fear an intercessor for themselves. 

The second medicine is thanks and contentment, and entreaty and supplication, and 
relying  on  the  mercy  of  the  All-Compassionate  Provider.  Is  that  so?  Yes,  for  how  can 
poverty,  want  and  need  be  painful  and  burdensome  for  a  guest of  an  All-Generous  and 
Munificent One Who makes the whole face of the earth a table of bounties and the spring 
a bunch of  flowers, and  Who places the  flowers  on the table and scatters them over  it? 
Poverty and need take on the form of a pleasant appetite. The guest tries to increase his 
poverty in the same way he does his appetite. It is because of this that the wise have taken 
pride in want and poverty. But beware, do not misunderstand this! It means to be aware 
of one’s poverty before God and to beseech Him, not to parade poverty before the people 
and assume the air of a beggar. 

As for the ticket and voucher, it is to perform the religious duties, and foremost the 
prescribed prayers, and to give up serious sins. Is that so? Yes, it is, for according to the 
consensus  of  those  who  observe  and  have  knowledge  of  the  Unseen  and  those  who 
uncover the mysteries of creation, the provisions, light, and steed for the long, dark road 
to  post-eternity  may  only  be  obtained  through  complying  with  the  commands  of  the 
Qur’an and  

                                                
1 Qur’an, 2:117, etc. 
2 Qur’an, 2:156.  

 

44

avoiding what  it prohibits. Science, philosophy, and  art are worth  nothing on that road. 
Their light reaches only as far as the door of the grave. 

O my lazy soul! How little and light and easy it is to perform the five daily prayers 
and  give  up  the  seven  deadly  sins!  If  you  have  the  faculty  of  reason  and  it  is  not 
corrupted, understand how important and extensive are their results, fruits, and benefits! 
Say  to  the  Devil  and  that  man  who  were  encouraging  you  to  indulge  in  vice  and 
dissipation:  “If  you  have  the  means  to  kill  death,  and  cause  decline  and  transience  to 
disappear  from  the  world,  and  remove  poverty  and  impotence  from  man,  and  close  the 
door of the grave, then tell us and let us hear it! Otherwise, be silent! The Qur’an reads 
the universe in the vast mosque of creation. Let us listen to it. Let us be illuminated with 
that  light.  Let  us  act  according  to  its  guidance.  And  let  us  recite  it  constantly.  Yes,  the 
Qur’an  is  the  word.  That  is  what  they  say  of  it.  It  is  the  Qur’an  which  is  the  truth  and 
comes  from  the  Truth  and  says  the  truth  and  shows  the  truth  and  spreads  luminous 
wisdom...” 

O God! Illuminate our hearts with the light of belief and the Qur’an. 

O God! Enrich us with the need of You and do not impoverish us with the lack of 
need of You. Make us free of our own strength and power, and cause us to take 
refuge  in  Your  strength  and  power.  Appoint  us  among  those  who  place  their 
trust in You, and do not entrust us to ourselves. Protect us with Your protection. 
Have mercy on us and have mercy on all believing men and women. And grant 
blessings and peace to our Master Muhammad, Your Servant and Prophet, Your 
Friend  and  Beloved,  the  Beauty  of  Your  Dominion  and  the  Sovereign  of  Your 
Art, the Essence of Your Favour and the Sun of Your Guidance, the Tongue of 
Your Proof and the Exemplar of Your Mercy, the Light of Your Creation and the 
Glory  of  Your  Creatures,  the  Lamp  of  Your  Unity  in  the  Multiplicity  of  Your 
Creatures and the Discloser of the Talisman of Your Beings, the Herald of the 
Sovereignty of Your Dominicality and the Announcer of those things pleasing to 
You, the Proclaimer of the Treasuries of Your Names and the Instructor of Your 
Servants,  the  Interpreter  of  Your  Signs  and  the  Mirror  of  the  Beauty  of  Your 
Dominicality,  the  Means  of  witnessing  You  and  bearing  witness  to  You,  Your 
Beloved and Your Messenger whom You sent as a Mercy to All the Worlds, and 
to all his Family and Companions, and to his brothers among the prophets and 
messengers,  and  to  Your  angels  and  to  the  righteous  among  Your  servants. 
AMEN.

The Eighth Word 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
God, there is no god but He, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsistent.1 
Verily, the religion before God is Islam.2 

If  you  want  to  understand  this  world,  and  man’s  spirit  within  the  world,  and  the 
nature  and  value  of  religion  for  man,  and  how the  world  is  a  prison  if  there  is  no  True 
Religion, and that without religion man becomes the most miserable of creatures, and that 
it is “O God!” and, “There is no god but God” that solve this world’s talisman and deliver 
the human spirit from darkness, then listen to and consider this comparison: 

Long ago, two brothers set off on a long journey. They continued on their way until 
the road forked. At the fork they saw a serious-looking man and asked him: “Which road 
is good?” He told them:  “On the road to the right one  is compelled to comply  with the 
law and order, but within that hardship  is security and  happiness. However, on the  left-
hand  road  there  is  freedom  and  no  restraint,  but  within  its  freedom  lie  danger  and 
wretchedness. Now, the choice is yours!” 

After  listening  to  this,  saying,  “I  place  my  trust  in  God,”3  the  brother  with  a  good 
character  took  the  right  road  and  conformed  to  the  order  and  regulations.  The  other 
brother, who was  immoral and a  layabout, chose the road to the  left  just  for the  lack of 
restrictions. With our imaginations, we shall follow this man in his situation, which was 
apparently easy but in reality burdensome. 

Thus,  this  man  went  up  hill  and  down  dale  until  he  found  himself  in  a  desolate 
wilderness. He suddenly heard a terrifying sound and saw that a great lion had come out 
of the forest and was about to attack him. He fled. He came across a waterless well sixty 
yards deep, and in his fear jumped into it. He fell half-way down it where his hands met a 
tree. He clung on to it. The tree, which was growing out of the walls of the well, had two 
roots.  

                                                
1 Qur’an, 3:2; 2:255. 
2 Qur’an, 3:19. 
3 Qur’an, 11:56. 

 

46

Two rats, one white and one black, were attacking and gnawing through them. He looked 
up and saw that the lion was waiting at the top of the well like a sentry. He looked down 
and  saw  a  ghastly  dragon.  It  raised  its  head  and  drew  it  close  to  his  foot  thirty  yards 
above. Its mouth was as big as the mouth of the well. Then he looked at the well’s walls 
and  saw  that  stinging,  poisonous  vermin  had  gathered  round  him.  He  looked  up  at  the 
mouth of the well and saw a fig-tree. But it was not an ordinary tree; it bore the fruit of 
many different trees, from walnuts to pomegranates. 

Thus, due to his lack of thought and foolishness, the man did not understand that this 
was not just some ordinary  matter, these things were not here by chance, and that there 
were  mysterious  secrets  concealed  in  these  strange  beings.  And  he  did  not  grasp  that 
there  was  someone  very  powerful  directing  them.  Now,  although  his  heart,  spirit,  and 
mind were secretly weeping and wailing at this grievous situation, his evil-commanding 
soul pretended that it was nothing; it closed its ears to the weeping of his heart and spirit, 
and deceiving itself, started to eat the tree’s fruit as though it was in a garden. But some 
of the  fruit were poisonous and  harmful.  Almighty God says  in a Divine Hadith:  “I  am 
according to how my servants think of Me.”4 

Thus, through his  foolishness and  lack of understanding, this unhappy  man thought 
what he saw to be ordinary and the actual truth. So that is the way he was treated, and is 
treated, and will be treated. He neither dies so that he is saved from it, nor does he live – 
he is in such torment. Now we shall leave this ill-omened man in his torment and return, 
so that we may consider the situation of the other brother. 

This fortunate and intelligent person went on his way, but he suffered no distress like 
his  brother.  For,  due  to  his  fine  morals,  he  thought  of  good  things  and  imagined  good 
things. Everything was friendly and familiar to him. And he did not suffer any difficulty 
and hardship like his brother, for he knew the order and followed it. He found it easy. He 
went on his way freely and in peace and security. Then he came across a garden in which 
were both lovely flowers and fruits, and, since it was not looked after, rotting and filthy 
things.  His  brother  had  also  entered  such  a  garden,  but  he  had  noticed  and  occupied 
himself  with  the  filthy  things  and  they  had  turned  his  stomach,  so  he  had  left  it  and 
moved  on  without  being  able  to  rest  himself.  But  this  man  acted  according  to the  rule, 
‘look on the good side of everything,’ and had paid no attention to the rotting things. He 
had benefited a lot from the good things, and taking a good rest, he had left and gone on 
his way. 

Later, also like the first brother, he had entered a vast desert, and had suddenly heard 

the roar of a lion which was attacking him. He was frightened,  

                                                
4 Bukhari, Tawhid, 15, 35; Muslim, Tawba, 1; Dhikr, 2, 19; Tirmidhi, Zuhd, 51; Da’wat, 131; Ibn Maja, 
Adab, 58; Darimi, Riqaq, 33; Musnad, ii, 251, 315, 391, 412, 445, 482, 516. 

 

47

but not as much as his brother. For, because of his good thoughts and positive attitude, he 
thought to himself:  “This desert has a ruler, and  it  is possible that this  lion  is a servant 
under the ruler’s command,” and found consolation. But he still fled until he came across 
an  empty  well  sixty  yards  deep.  He  threw  himself  into  it.  Like  his  brother,  his  hand 
clasped a tree half-way down and he remained suspended in the air. He looked and saw 
two  animals  gnawing  through  the tree’s  two roots.  He  looked  up  and  saw  the  lion,  and 
looked  down  and  saw  the  dragon.  Just  like  his  brother  he  was  seeing  a  most  strange 
situation.  He  was  terrified  like  him,  but  his  terror  was  a  thousand  times  less  than  his 
brother’s. For his good morals had given him good thoughts, and good thoughts show the 
good side of everything. So, because of this, he thought as follows:  

 “These  strange  happenings  are  connected  to  someone.  Also  it  seems  that  they  are 
acting  in  accordance  with  a  command.  In  which  case,  these  matters  contain  a  talisman. 
Yes,  everything  is  happening  at  the  command  of  a  hidden  ruler.  Therefore,  I  am  not 
alone; the hidden ruler  is watching  me, he  is testing  me, he  is  impelling  me somewhere 
for some purpose, and inviting  me there. A curiosity arising  from this pleasant  fear and 
these agreeable thoughts prompt me to say: I wonder who it is that is testing me, wants to 
make himself known, and is impelling me for some purpose on this strange road.” 

Then,  love  for  the  owner  of  the  talisman  arose  out of  the  desire  to  know  him,  and 
from that love arose the desire to solve the talisman. And from that desire arose the will 
to acquire good qualities which would please and gratify the talisman’s owner. Then he 
looked at the tree and saw it was a fig-tree, but it was bearing the fruits of thousands of 
trees. So then all his fear left him, for he understood that for certain the fig-tree was a list, 
an index, an exhibition. The hidden ruler must have attached samples of the fruits in the 
garden to the tree through a miracle and with a talisman, and must have adorned the tree 
in a way that would point to each of the foods he had prepared for his guests. For there is 
no other way a single tree could produce the fruits of thousands of different trees. Then 
he began to entreat that he would be inspired with the key to the talisman. He called out: 

“O ruler of this place! I  have  happened upon  you and I take refuge with  you. I am 
your servant and I want to please  you. I am searching  for  you.” After he had  made this 
supplication, the walls of the well suddenly parted, and a door opened onto a wonderful, 
pleasant,  quiet  garden.  Indeed,  the  dragon’s  mouth  was  transformed  into  the  door,  and 
both it and the lion took on the forms of two servants; they invited him to enter. The lion 
even became a docile horse for him. 

O my lazy soul! And O my imaginary friend! Come! Let us compare the position of 
these two brothers so that we can see  how good comes of good and evil comes of  evil. 
Let us find out. 

 

48

Look,  the  unhappy  traveller  on  the  left  road  is  all  the  time  trembling  with  fear 
waiting to enter the dragon’s  mouth, while the  fortunate one  is  invited  into a blooming, 
splendid  garden  full  of  fruit.  And  the  unfortunate  one’s  heart  is  being  pounded  by  an 
awful terror and grievous fear, while the fortunate one is gazing at and observing strange 
things  as  a  delightful  lesson,  with  a  pleasant  fear  and  loving  knowledge.  Also  the 
miserable  one  is  suffering  torments  in  desolation,  despair,  and  loneliness,  while  the 
fortunate  one  is  enjoying  himself,  full  of  hope,  longing,  and  a  sense  of  belonging. 
Furthermore, the unfortunate one sees himself as a prisoner subject to the attacks of wild 
beasts,  while  the  fortunate  one  is  an  honoured  guest  who  is  on  friendly  terms  and 
enjoying himself with the strange servants of his generous host. Also the unhappy one is 
hastening  his  torments  by  indulging  in  fruits  which  are  apparently  delicious  but  in  fact 
poisonous. For the fruits are samples; there is permission to taste them so as to seek the 
originals and become customers for them, but there is no permission to devour them like 
an  animal.  But  the  fortunate  one  tastes  them  and  understands  the  matter;  he  postpones 
eating  them  and  takes  pleasure  in  waiting.  Moreover,  the  unfortunate  one  is  wronging 
himself. Through his lack of discernment, he is making a truth and a situation which are 
as clear and bright as daylight into a dark and oppressive fear, into a hellish delusion. He 
does not deserve pity, nor does he have the right to complain to anyone. 

For  example,  if  a  person  at  a  pleasant  banquet  in  a  beautiful  garden  in  summer 
among his friends makes himself drunk through filthy intoxicants, then imagines himself 
hungry and naked in the middle of winter among wild animals and starts shouting out and 
crying, he does  not deserve to be pitied;  he  is  wronging  himself, and  he  is  insulting  his 
friends  by  imagining  them  to  be  wild  beasts.  Thus,  the  unfortunate  brother  is  like  this. 
But the fortunate one sees the truth. And the truth is good. Through perceiving the beauty 
of  the  truth,  the  fortunate  brother  is  being  respectful  towards  the  truth’s  owner.  So  he 
deserves  his  mercy. Thus, the  meaning of the Qur’anic decree:  “Know that evil  is  from 
yourself,  and  good  is  from  God”5  becomes  clear.  If  you  make  a  comparison  of  other 
differences  in  the  same  way,  you  will  understand  that the  evil-commanding  soul  of  the 
first brother has prepared a sort of hell for him, while the good intention, good will, good 
character, and good thoughts of the other have allowed him to receive abundant bounty, 
experience true happiness and prosperity, and display shining virtue. 

O my soul! And O you who is listening to this story together with my soul! If you do 
not  want  to  be  the  unfortunate  brother  and  want  to  be  the  fortunate  one,  listen  to  the 
Qur’an, obey its decrees, adhere to them, and act according to them.  

                                                
5 See, Qur’an, 4:79.

If you have understood the truths in this comparison, you will be able to make them 
correspond  to  the  truths  of  religion,  the  world,  man,  and  belief  in  God.  I  shall  say  the 
important ones, then you deduce the finer points yourself. 

So,  look!  Of  the  two  brothers,  one  is  a  believing  spirit  and  a  righteous  heart.  The 
other is an unbelieving spirit and a depraved heart. Of the two roads, the one to the right 
is the way of the Qur’an and belief in God, while the left one is the road of rebellion and 
denial.  The  garden  on  the  road  is  man’s  fleeting  life  in  human  society  and  civilization, 
where good and evil, and things good and bad and clean and dirty are found side by side. 
The sensible person is he who acts according to the rule: ‘Take what is pleasant and clear, 
and leave what is distressing and turbid,’ and goes on his way with tranquillity of heart. 
As  for the desert, it is the earth and this world. And the  lion  is death and the appointed 
hour. The well is man’s body and the time of his life, while its sixty-yard depth points to 
the normal life-span of sixty years. And the tree is the period of life and the substance of 
life. The two animals, one white and one black, are night and day. The dragon is the road 
to the Intermediate Realm and pavilion of the  hereafter, whose  mouth  is the grave. But 
for  the  believer,  that  mouth  is  a  door  opening  from  a  prison  onto  a  garden.  As  for  the 
poisonous vermin, they are the calamities of this world. But for the believer they are like 
gentle Divine warnings and favours of the Most Merciful One to prevent him slipping off 
into the sleep of heedlessness. The fruits on the tree are the bounties of this world which 
the  Absolutely  Generous  One  has  made  in  the  form  of  a  list  of  the  bounties  of  the 
hereafter, and both as examples of them, and warnings, and samples inviting customers to 
the  fruits  of  Paradise.  And  the  tree  producing  numerous  different  fruits  despite  being  a 
single tree indicates the seal of the Eternally Besought One’s power, the stamp of Divine 
dominicality, and the signet of the sovereignty of the Godhead. For ‘to make everything 
from one thing,’ that  is, to  make  all  plants and  fruits  from earth, and create all animals 
from  a  fluid,  and  to  create  all  the  limbs  and  organs  of  animals  from  a  simple  food, 
together with ‘making everything one thing,’ that is, arts like weaving a simple skin and 
making flesh particular to each animal from the great variety of foods that animals eat, is 
an inimitable stamp and seal peculiar to the Ruler of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, Who 
is  the  Single,  Eternally-Besought  One.  For  sure,  to  make  one  thing  everything,  and 
everything  one  thing  is  a  sign,  a  mark,  peculiar  to  the  Creator  of  all  things,  the  One 
Powerful over all things. 

As  for  the  talisman,  it  is  the  mystery  of  the  purpose  of  creation  which  is  solved 
through the mystery of belief. And the key is “There is no god but God,” and, “God, there 
is  no  god  but  He,  the  Ever-Living,  the  Self-Subsistent.”  The  dragon’s  mouth  being 
transformed  into  the  door  into  the  garden  is  a  sign  that,  although  for  the  people  of 
misguidance and rebellion the grave is a door opening, in desolation and oblivion, onto a 
grave distressing as a dungeon  

 

50

and  narrow  as  a  dragon’s  stomach,  for the  people  of  the  Qur’an  and  belief,  it  is  a  door 
which opens from the prison of this world onto the fields of immortality, from the arena 
of  examination  onto  the  gardens  of  Paradise,  and  from  the  hardships  of  life  onto  the 
mercy  of  the  All-Merciful  One.  The  savage  lion  turning  into  a  friendly  servant  and  a 
docile  mount  is  a  sign  that,  although  for  the  people  of  misguidance,  death  is  a  bitter, 
eternal parting from all their loved ones, and the expulsion from the deceptive paradise of 
this world and the entry in desolation and loneliness into the dungeon of the grave, for the 
people  of  guidance  and  the  Qur’an  it  is  the  means  of  joining  all  their  old  friends  and 
beloved  ones  who  have  already  departed  for the  next  world,  and  the  means  of  entering 
their true homeland and abode of everlasting happiness. It is an invitation to the meadows 
of Paradise from the prison of this world, and a time to receive the wage bestowed out of 
the  generosity  of  the  Most  Merciful  and  Compassionate  One  for  services  rendered  to 
Him, and a discharge from the hardship of the duties of life, and a rest from the drill and 
instruction of worship and examination. 

In Short: Whoever makes this fleeting life his purpose and aim is in fact in Hell even 
if  apparently  in  Paradise.  And  whoever  is  turned  in  all  seriousness  towards  eternal  life 
receives the happiness of both worlds. However difficult and distressing this world is for 
him, since he sees it as the waiting-room for Paradise, he endures it and offers thanks in 
patience. 

O  God!  Appoint  us  among  the  people  of  happiness,  safety,  the  Qur’an,  and 
belief. Amen. O God! Grant peace and blessings to our Master Muhammad, and 
to  his  Family  and  Companions,  to  the  number  of  all  the  letters  of  the  Qur’an 
formed  in  all  its  words,  represented  with  the  permission  of  the  Most  Merciful 
One in the mirrors of the air waves on the recital of each of those words by all 
the Qur’an’s reciters from its first revelation to the end of time, and have mercy 
on us and on our parents, and have mercy on all believing men and  women to 
the  number  of  those  words,  through  Your  mercy,  O  Most  Merciful  of  the 
Merciful. Amen. And all praise be to God, the Sustainer of All the Worlds.

The Ninth Word 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
So glorify God when you reach evening and  when you rise in the morning; for 
all praise is His in the heavens and on earth, and towards the end of the day and 
when you have reached noon.1 

Brother! You ask me concerning the wisdom in the specified times of the five daily 

prayers. I shall point out only one of the many instances of wisdom in the times. 

Yes,  like each of the times of prayer  marks the start of an  important revolution,  so 
also  is  each  a  mirror  to  Divine  disposal  of  power  and  to  the  universal  Divine  bounties 
within  that  disposal.  Thus,  more  glorification  and  extolling  of  the  All-Powerful  One  of 
Glory  have  been  ordered  at  those  times,  and  more  praise  and  thanks  for  all  the 
innumerable  bounties  accumulated  between  each  of  the  times,  which  is  the  meaning  of 
the prescribed prayers. In order to understand a  little this subtle and profound  meaning, 
you should listen together with my own soul to the following five ‘Points’. 

FIRST POINT 

The  meaning  of  the  prayers  is  the  offering  of  glorification,  praise,  and  thanks  to 
Almighty  God.  That  is  to  say,  uttering  “Glory  be  to  God”  by  word  and  action  before 
God’s glory and sublimity, it is to hallow and worship Him. And declaring “God is Most 
Great” through word and act before His sheer perfection, it is to exalt and magnify Him. 
And saying “All praise be to God” with the heart, tongue, and body, it is to offer thanks 
before  His  utter  beauty.  That  is  to  say,  glorification,  exaltation,  and  praise  are  like  the 
seeds  of  the  prayers.  That  is  why  these  three  things  are  present  in  every  part  of  the 
prayers, in all the actions and words. It is also why these blessed words are each repeated 
thirty-three  times  after  the  prayers,  in  order  to  strengthen  and  reiterate  the  prayers’ 
meaning. The meaning of the prayers is confirmed through these concise summaries. 

                                                
1 Qur’an, 30:17-18. 

 

52

SECOND POINT 

The meaning of worship is this, that the servant sees his own faults, impotence, and 
poverty,  and  in  the  Divine  Court  prostrates  in  love  and  wonderment  before  dominical 
perfection, Divine  mercy, and the power of the Eternally Besought One. That  is to say, 
just as the sovereignty of dominicality demands worship and obedience, so also does the 
holiness  of  dominicality  require  that  the  servant  sees  his  faults  through  seeking 
forgiveness,  and  through  his  glorifications  and  declaring  “Glory  be  to  God”  proclaims 
that his Sustainer is pure and free of all defects, and exalted above and far from the false 
ideas of the people of  misguidance, and  hallowed and exempt  from all the  faults  in the 
universe. 

Also, the perfect power of dominicality requires that through understanding his own 
weakness  and  the  impotence  of  other  creatures,  the  servant  proclaims  “God  is  Most 
Great”  in  admiration  and  wonder  before  the  majesty  of  the  works  of  the  Eternally 
Besought One’s power, and bowing in deep humility seeks refuge in Him and places his 
trust in Him. 

Also,  the  infinite  treasury  of  dominicality’s  mercy  requires  that  the  servant  makes 
known  his  own  need  and  the  needs  and  poverty  of  all  creatures  through  the  tongue  of 
entreaty and supplication, and proclaims his Sustainer’s bounties and gifts through thanks 
and laudation and uttering “All praise be to God.” That is to say, the words and actions of 
the prayers comprise these meanings, and have been laid down from the side of Divinity. 

Just  as  man  is  an  example  in  miniature  of  the  greater  world  and  Sura  al-Fatiha  a 
shining  sample  of  the  Qur’an  of  Mighty  Stature,  so  are  the  prescribed  prayers  a 
comprehensive, luminous index of all varieties of worship, and a sacred map pointing to 
all the shades of worship of all the classes of creatures. 

THIRD POINT 

FOURTH POINT 

The second-hand,  minute-hand, hour-hand, and day-hand of a clock which tells the 
weeks  look  to  one  another,  are  examples  of  one  another,  and  follow  one  another. 
Similarly, the alternations of day and  night, which are  like the seconds of this world  –a 
vast clock of Almighty God– and the years which tell its minutes, and the stages of man’s 
life-span which tell the hours, and the epochs of the world’s life-span which tell the days 
look to one another, are examples of one another, resemble one another, and recall one 
another. For example: 

The time of Fajr, the early morning: This time until  sunrise resembles  and calls to 
mind the early spring, the moment of conception in the mother’s womb, and the first of 
the six days of the creation of the heavens and earth; it recalls the Divine acts present in 
them. 

 

53

The  time  of Zuhr,  just  past  midday:  This  resembles  and  points to  midsummer,  and 
the prime of youth, and the period of man’s creation in the lifetime of the world, and calls 
to mind the manifestations of mercy and the abundant bounties they contain. 

The  time  of  ‘Asr,  afternoon:  This  is  like  autumn,  and  old  age,  and  the  time  of  the 
Final Prophet (PBUH), known as the Era of Bliss, and recalls the Divine acts and favours 
of the All-Merciful One present in them. 

The  time  of  Maghrib,  sunset:  Through  recalling  the  departure of  many  creatures  at 
the  end  of  autumn,  and  man’s  death,  and  the  destruction  of  the  world  at  the 
commencement of  the  resurrection,  this  time  puts  in  mind  the  manifestations  of  Divine 
glory and sublimity, and rouses man from his slumbers of heedlessness. 

The  time  of  ‘Isha,  nightfall.  As  for  this  time,  by  calling  to  mind  the  world  of 
darkness  veiling  all  the  objects  of  the  daytime  world  with  a  black  shroud,  and  winter 
hiding the face of the dead earth with its white cerement, and even the remaining works 
of departed men dying and passing beneath the veil of oblivion, and this world, the arena 
of examination,  being  shut up and closed down  for ever,  it proclaims the awesome and 
mighty disposals of the All-Glorious and Compelling Subduer. 

As for the nighttime, through putting in mind both the winter, and the grave, and the 
Intermediate Realm, it reminds man how needy is the human spirit for the Most Merciful 
One’s  mercy.  And  the  tahajjud  prayer  informs  him  what  a  necessary  light  it  is  for  the 
night  of  the  grave  and  darkness  of  the  Intermediate  Realm;  it  warns  him  of  this,  and 
through recalling the infinite bounties of the True Bestower, proclaims how deserving He 
is of praise and thanks. 

And  the  second  morning  calls  to  mind  the  Morning  of  the  Resurrection.  For  sure, 
however reasonable and necessary and certain the morning of this night is, the Morning 
of  the  Resurrection  and  the  spring  following  the  Intermediate  Realm  are  certain  to  the 
same degree. 

That is, just as each of these five times marks the start of an important revolution and 
recalls  other  great  revolutions,  so  through  the  awesome  daily  disposals  of  the  Eternally 
Besought  One’s  power,  each  calls  to  mind  the  miracles  of  Divine  power  and  gifts  of 
Divine  mercy  of  both  every  year,  and  every  age,  and  every  epoch.  That  is  to  say,  the 
prescribed  prayers,  which  are  an  innate  duty  and  the  basis  of  worship  and  an 
incontestable debt, are most appropriate and fitting for these times. 

 

54

FIFTH POINT 

By  nature  man  is  extremely  weak,  yet  everything  touches  him,  and  saddens  and 
grieves  him.  Also  he  is  utterly  lacking  in  power,  yet  the  calamities  and  enemies  that 
afflict  him  are  extremely  numerous.  Also  he  is  extremely  wanting,  yet  his  needs  are 
indeed  many.  Also  he  is  lazy  and  incapable,  yet  life’s  responsibilities  are  most 
burdensome.  Also  his  humanity  has  connected  him  to  the  rest  of  the  universe,  yet  the 
decline and disappearance of the things he loves and with which he is familiar continually 
pains  him.  Also  his  reason  shows  him  exalted  aims  and  lasting  fruits,  yet  his  hand  is 
short, his life brief, his power slight, and his patience little. 

It can be clearly understood from this how essential it is for a spirit in this state at the 
time of Fajr in the early morning to have recourse to and present a petition to the Court 
of  an  All-Powerful  One  of  Glory,  an  All-Compassionate  All-Beauteous  One  through 
prayer and supplication, to seek success and help from Him, and what a necessary point 
of support it is so that he can face the things that will happen to him in the coming day 
and bear the duties that will be loaded on him. 

The time of Zuhr just past midday is the time of the day’s zenith and the start of its 
decline, the time when daily labours approach their achievement, the time of a short rest 
from  the  pressures  of  work,  when  the  spirit  needs  a  pause  from  the  heedlessness  and 
insensibility  caused  by  toil,  and  a  time  Divine  bounties  are  manifested.  Anyone  may 
understand  then  how  fine  and  agreeable,  how  necessary  and  appropriate  it  is  for  the 
human  spirit  to  perform  the  midday  prayer,  which  means  to  be  released  from  the 
pressure,  shake  off  the  heedlessness,  and  leave  behind  those  meaningless,  transient 
things,  and  clasping  one’s  hands  at  the  Court  of  the  True  Bestower  of  Bounties,  the 
Eternally Self-Subsistent One, to offer praise and thanks  for all His gifts, and seek  help 
from  Him,  and  through  bowing  to  display  one’s  impotence  before  His  glory  and 
tremendousness,  and  to  prostrate  and  proclaim  one’s  wonder,  love,  and  humility.  One 
who does not understand this is not a true human being. 

As  for the  time  of  ‘Asr  in  the  afternoon,  it  calls  to  mind  the  melancholy  season  of 
autumn and the mournful state of old age and the sombre period at the end of time. It is 
also when the matters of the day reach their conclusion, and the time the Divine bounties 
which  have  been  received  that  day  like  health,  well-being,  and  beneficial  duties  have 
accumulated  to  form  a  great  total,  and  the  time  that  proclaims  through  the  mighty  sun 
hinting by starting to sink that man is a guest-official and that everything is transient and 
inconstant.  Now,  the  human  spirit  desires  eternity  and  was  created  for  it;  it  worships 
benevolence, and is pained by separation. Thus, anyone who is truly a human being may 
understand what an exalted duty, what an appropriate  

 

55

service,  what  a  fitting  way  to  repay  a  debt  of  human  nature,  indeed,  what  an  agreeable 
pleasure it is to perform the afternoon prayer. For by offering supplications at the Eternal 
Court  of  the  Everlasting  Pre-Eternal  One,  the  Eternally  Self-Subsistent  One,  it  has  the 
meaning of taking refuge in the grace of unending, infinite mercy, and by offering thanks 
and praise in the face of innumerable bounties, of humbly bowing before the mightiness 
of His dominicality, and by prostrating in utter humility before the everlastingness of His 
Godhead, of  finding true consolation of  heart and ease of spirit, and  being girded ready 
for worship in the presence of His grandeur. 

The  time  of  Maghrib  at  sunset  recalls  the  disappearance  amid  sad  farewells  of  the 
delicate,  lovely  creatures  of  the  worlds  of  summer  and  autumn  at  the  start of  winter.  It 
calls  to  mind  the  time  when  through  his  death,  man  will  leave  all  those  he  loves  in 
sorrowful departure and enter the grave. It brings to mind when at the death of this world 
amid the convulsions of its death-agonies, all its inhabitants will migrate to other worlds 
and the lamp of this place of examination will be extinguished. It is a time which gives 
stern warning to those who worship transient, ephemeral beloveds. 

Thus, at such a time,  for the Maghrib prayer,  man’s spirit, which  by  its  nature  is a 
mirror desirous for an Eternal Beauty, turns its face towards the throne of mightiness of 
the  Eternal  Undying  One,  the  Enduring  Everlasting  One,  Who  performs  these  mighty 
works  and  turns  and  transforms  these  huge  worlds,  and  declaring  “God  is  Most  Great” 
over these transient beings, withdraws from them. Man clasps his hands in service of his 
Lord  and  rises  in  the  presence  of  the  Enduring  Eternal  One,  and  through  saying:  All 
praise be to God, he praises and extols His faultless perfection, His peerless beauty, His 
infinite  mercy.  Through  declaring:  “You  alone  do  we  worship  and  from  You  alone  we 
seek  help,”2  he  proclaims  his  worship  for  and  seeks  help  from  His  unassisted 
dominicality,  His  unpartnered  Godhead,  His  unshared  sovereignty.  Then  he  bows,  and 
through declaring together with all the universe his weakness and impotence, his poverty 
and baseness before the infinite majesty, the limitless power, and utter mightiness of the 
Enduring  Eternal  One,  he  says:  “All  glory  to  My  Mighty  Sustainer,”  and  glorifies  his 
Sublime  Sustainer.  And  prostrating  before  the  undying  Beauty  of  His  Essence,  His 
unchanging sacred attributes, His constant everlasting perfection, through abandoning all 
things  other  than  Him,  man  proclaims  his  love  and  worship  in  wonder  and  self-
abasement. He finds an All-Compassionate Eternal One. And through saying, “All glory 
to my Exalted Sustainer,” he declares his Most High Sustainer to be free of decline and 
exalted above any fault.  

Then,  he  testifies  to  God’s  unity  and  the  prophethood  of  Muhammad  (Peace  and 

blessings be upon him). He sits, and on his own account offers as  

                                                
2 Qur’an, 1:5. 

 

56

a  gift  to  the  Undying  All-Beauteous  One,  the  Enduring  All-Glorious  One  the  blessed 
salutations  and  benedictions  of  all  creatures.  And  through  greeting  God’s  Most  Noble 
Messenger,  he  renews  his  allegiance  to  him  and  proclaims  his  obedience  to  his 
commands. In order to renew and illuminate his faith, he observes the wise order in this 
palace  of  the  universe  and  testifies  to  the  unity  of  the  All-Glorious  Maker.  And  he 
testifies to the Messengership of Muhammad the  Arabian (Peace and  blessings be upon 
him), who is the herald of the sovereignty of God’s dominicality, the proclaimer of those 
things  pleasing  to  Him,  and  the  interpreter  of  the  signs  and  verses  of  the  book  of  the 
universe. To perform the Maghrib prayer  is this. So how can  someone  be considered a 
human being who does not understand what a fine and pure duty is the prayer at sunset, 
what  an  exalted  and  pleasurable  act  of  service,  what  an  agreeable  and  pleasing  act  of 
worship,  what  a  serious  matter,  and  what  an  unending  conversation  and  permanent 
happiness it is in this transient guesthouse? 

At the time of ‘Isha at nightfall, the last traces of the day remaining on the horizon 
disappear, and the world of night enfolds the universe. As the All-Powerful and Glorious 
One, The Changer of Night and Day, turns the white page of day into the black page of 
night through the mighty disposals of His dominicality, it recalls the Divine activities of 
that  All-Wise  One  of  Perfection,  The  Subduer  of  the  Sun  and  the  Moon,  turning  the 
green-adorned  page  of  summer  into  the  frigid  white  page  of  winter.  And  with  the 
remaining works of the departed being erased from this world with the passing of time, it 
recalls  the  Divine  acts  of  The  Creator  and  Life  and  Death  in  their  passage  to  another, 
quite  different  world.  It  is  a  time  that  calls  to  mind  the  disposals  of  The  Creator of  the 
Heavens and the Earth’s awesomeness and the  manifestations of His  beauty  in the utter 
destruction  of  this  narrow,  fleeting,  and  lowly  world,  the  terrible  death-agonies  of  its 
decease, and  in the unfolding of the  broad, eternal,  and  majestic  world of the  hereafter. 
And  the  universe’s  Owner,  its  True  Disposer,  its  True  Beloved  and  Object  of  Worship 
can  only  be  the  One  Who  with  ease  turns  night  into  day,  winter  into  spring,  and  this 
world  into  the  hereafter  like  the  pages  of  a  book;  Who  writes  and  erases  them,  and 
changes them. 

Thus, at nightfall, man’s spirit, which is infinitely impotent and weak, and infinitely 
poor and needy, and plunged  into the  infinite darkness of the  future, and tossed around 
amid  innumerable  events,  performs  the  ‘Isha  prayer,  which  has  this  meaning:  like 
Abraham man says: “I love not those that set,”3 and through the prayers seeks refuge at 
the Court of an Undying Object of Worship, an Eternal Beloved One, and in this transient 
world and fleeting life and dark world and black future he supplicates an Enduring,  

                                                
3 Qur’an, 6:76. 

 

57

Everlasting One, and for a moment of unending conversation, a few seconds of immortal 
life, he asks to receive the favours of the All-Merciful and Compassionate One’s mercy 
and  the  light  of  His  guidance,  which  will  strew  light  on  his  world  and  illuminate  his 
future and  bind up the wounds resulting  from the departure and decline of  all  creatures 
and friends.  

Temporarily  man  forgets the hidden world, which has  forgotten him, and pours out 
his woes at the Court of Mercy with his weeping, and whatever happens, before sleeping 
–which  resembles  death–  he  performs  his  last  duty  of  worship.  And  in  order  to  close 
favourably the daily record of his actions, he rises to pray; that is to say, he rises to enter 
the presence of an Eternal Beloved and Worshipped One in place of all the mortal ones 
he  loves,  of  an  All-Powerful  and  Generous  One  in  place  of  all  the  impotent  creatures 
from which he begs, of an All-Compassionate Protector so as to be saved from the evil of 
the harmful beings before which he trembles. 

He  starts  with  the  Sura  al-Fatiha,  that  is,  instead  of  praising  and  being  obliged  to 
defective, wanting creatures, for which they are not suited, he extols and offers praise to 
The  Sustainer  of  All  the  Worlds,  Who  is  Absolutely  Perfect  and  Utterly  Self-Sufficient 
and  Most  Compassionate  and  All-Generous.  Then  he  progresses  to  the  address:  “You 
alone  do  we  worship.”  That  is,  despite  his  smallness,  insignificance,  and  aloneness, 
through  man’s  connection  with  The  Owner  of  the  Day  of  Judgement,  Who  is  the 
Sovereign  of  Pre-Eternity  and  Post-Eternity,  he  attains  to  a  rank  whereat  he  is  an 
indulged guest in the universe and an important official. Through declaring:  “You alone 
do we worship and from You alone do we seek help,” he presents to Him in the name of 
all  creatures  the  worship  and  calls  for  assistance  of  the  mighty  congregation  and  huge 
community of the universe. Then through saying: “Guide us to the Straight Path,” he asks 
to  be  guided  to the  Straight  Path,  which  leads  to  eternal  happiness  and  is  the  luminous 
way. 

And  now,  he  thinks  of  the  mightiness  of  the  All-Glorious  One,  of  Whom,  like  the 
sleeping plants and animals, the hidden suns and sober stars are all soldiers subjugated to 
His command, and lamps and servants in this guesthouse of the world, and uttering: “God 
is  Most  Great,”  he  bows  down.  Then  he  thinks  of  the  great  prostration  of  all  creatures. 
That is, when, at the command of “Be!,” and it is,4 all the varieties of creatures each year 
and each century – even the earth, and the universe – each like a well-ordered army or an 
obedient soldier, is discharged from its duty, that is, when each is sent to the World of the 
Unseen,  through  the  prostration  of  its  decease  and  death  with  complete  orderliness,  it 
declares: “God is Most Great,” and bows down in prostration. Like they are raised to life, 
some in part and some the same, in the spring at an  awakening and life-giving trumpet-
blast from the command  

                                                
4 Qur’an, 2:117, etc.

of ‘“Be!” and it is,’ and they rise up and are girded ready to serve their Lord, insignificant
man  too,  following  them,  declares:  “God  is  Most  Great!”  in  the  presence  of  the  All-
Merciful One of Perfection, the All-Compassionate One of Beauty in wonderstruck love
and eternity-tinged humility and dignified self-effacement, and bows down in prostration;
that is to say, he makes a sort of Ascension. For sure you will have understood now how
agreeable and fine and pleasant and elevated, how high and pleasurable, how reasonable
and  appropriate  a  duty,  service,  and  act  of  worship,  and  what  a  serious  matter  it  is  to
perform the ‘Isha prayer. 

Thus, since each of these five times points to a mighty revolution, is a sign indicating
the  tremendous  dominical  activity,  and  a  token  of  the  universal  Divine  bounties,  it  is
perfect  wisdom  that  being  a  debt  and  an  obligation,  the  prescribed  prayers  should  be
specified at those times.  

Glory be unto You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught us;
indeed You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.5 

O  God!  Grant  blessings  and  peace  to  the  one  whom  You  sent  as  a  teacher  to
Your servants to instruct them in knowledge of You and worship of You, and to
make known the treasures of Your Names, and to translate the signs of the book
of the universe and as a mirror to its worship of the beauty of Your dominicality,
and  to  all  his  Family  and  Companions,  and  have  mercy  on  us  and  on  all
believing men and women. Amen. Through Your Mercy, O Most Merciful of the
Merciful!  

                                                 
5 Qur’an, 2:32.

The Tenth Word 

Resurrection and 
the Hereafter 

NOTE 

[The  reasons  for  my  writing  these  treatises  in  the  form  of  metaphors, 
comparisons and stories are to facilitate comprehension and to show how 
rational, appropriate, well-founded and  coherent are the truths of Islam. 
The meaning of the stories is contained in the truths that conclude them; 
each story is like an allusion pointing to its concluding truth. Therefore, 
they are not mere fictitious tales, but veritable truths.] 

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. 
Look, then, to the signs of God’s mercy —how He restores life to the earth after 
its  death—  verily  He  it  is  Who  quickens  the  dead, for  He  is  powerful  over  all 
things.1 

Brother, if  you wish  for a discussion of resurrection and the  hereafter  in simple and 
common  language,  in  a  straightforward  style,  then  listen  to  the  following  comparison, 
together with my own soul. 

Once two men were travelling through a  land as  beautiful  as Paradise (by that land, 
we  intend  the  world).  Looking  around  them,  they  saw  that  everyone  had  left  open  the 
door of  his  home and  his shop and was  not paying attention to guarding  it. Money and 
property were readily accessible, without anyone to claim them. One of the two travellers 
grasped hold of all that he fancied, stealing it and usurping it. Following his inclinations, 
he  committed  every  kind  of  injustice  and  abomination.  None  of  the  people  of  that  land 
moved to stop him. But his friend said to him: 

“What  are  you  doing?  You  will  be  punished,  and  I  will  be  dragged  into  misfortune 

along with you. All this property belongs to the state. The people  

                                                

1 Qur’an, 30:50.  
NOTE:  The main part of this translation of the Tenth Word is by Hamid Algar, Prof. of Middle 
Eastern Studies in the Univ. of California, Berkeley, USA, and was first published in 1980. It has been 
slightly amended to fit the present work

of  this  land,  including  even  the  children,  are  all  soldiers  or  government  servants.  It  is 
because they are at present civilians that they are not interfering with you. But the laws 
here  are  strict.  The  king  has  installed  telephones  everywhere  and  his  agents  are 
everywhere. Go quickly, and try to settle the matter.” 

But  the  empty-headed  man  said  in  his  obstinacy:  “No,  it  is  not  state  property;  it 
belongs  instead  to  some  endowment,  and  has  no  clear  or obvious  owner.  Everyone  can 
make use of it as he sees fit. I see no reason to deny myself the use of these fine things. I 
will not believe they belong to anyone unless I see him with my own eyes.” He continued 
to speak in this way, with  much philosophical  sophistry, and an earnest discussion took 
place between them. 

First the empty-headed man said: “Who is the king here? I can’t see him,” and then 

his friend replied: 

“Every village must have its headman; every needle must have its  manufacturer and 
craftsman. And, as you know, every letter must be written by someone. How, then, can it 
be  that  so  extremely  well-ordered  a  kingdom  should  have  no  ruler?  And  how  can  so 
much  wealth  have  no  owner,  when  every  hour  a  train2  arrives  filled  with  precious  and 
artful gifts, as  if coming  from the realm of the unseen?  And all the announcements and 
proclamations,  all  the  seals  and  stamps,  found  on  all  those  goods,  all  the  coins  and  the 
flags waving in every corner of the kingdom — can they be without an owner? It seems 
you have studied foreign languages a little, and are unable to read this Islamic script. In 
addition, you refuse to ask those who are able to read it. Come now, let me read to you 
the king’s supreme decree.” 

The empty-headed man then retorted: “Well, let us suppose there is a king; what harm 
can  he  suffer  from  the  minute  use  I  am  making  of  all  his  wealth?  Will  his  treasury 
decrease  on  account  of  it?  In  any  event,  I  can  see  nothing  here  resembling  prison  or 
punishment.” 

His  friend  replied:  “This  land  that  you  see  is  a  manoeuvering  ground.  It  is,  in 
addition,  an  exhibition  of  his  wonderful  royal  arts.  Then  again  it  may  be  regarded  as  a 
temporary hospice, one devoid of foundations. Do you not see that every day one caravan 
arrives  as another departs and  vanishes? It  is  being  constantly  emptied and  filled. Soon 
the whole  land will  be changed;  its  inhabitants will depart for another and  more  lasting 
realm.  There  everyone  will  be  either  rewarded  or  punished  in  accordance  with  his 
services.” 

That treacherous empty-headed one retorted rebelliously: “I don’t believe it. Is it at all 

possible that a whole land should perish, and be transferred to another realm?” 

                                                

of the unseen. 

2 Indicates the cycle of a year. Indeed, every spring is a carload of provisions coming from the realm 

 

61

His faithful friend then replied: “Since you are so obstinate and rebellious, come, let 
me demonstrate to you, with twelve out of the innumerable proofs available, that there is 
a  Supreme  Tribunal,  a  realm  of  reward  and  generosity  and  a  realm  of  punishment  and 
incarceration, and that just as this world is partially emptied every day, so too a day shall 
come when it will be totally emptied and destroyed. 

• First Aspect:  Is it at all possible that in any kingdom, and particularly so splendid a 
kingdom  as  this,  there  should  be  no  reward  for  those  who  serve  obediently  and  no 
punishment for those who rebel? Reward and punishment are virtually non-existent here; 
there must therefore be a Supreme Tribunal somewhere else. 

• Second Aspect:  Look at the organization and administration of this kingdom! See 
how everyone, including the poorest and the weakest, is provided with perfect and ornate 
sustenance.  The  best  care  is  taken  of  the  sick.  Royal  and  delicious  foods,  dishes,  jewel 
encrusted decorations, embroidered garments, splendid feasts — all are to be found here. 
See how everyone pays due  attention to his duties, with the exception of empty-headed 
people  such  as  yourself.  No  one  transgresses  his  bounds  by  as  much  as  an  inch.  The 
greatest of all men is engaged in modest and obedient service, with an attitude of fear and 
awe.  The  ruler  of  this  kingdom  must  possess,  then,  great  generosity  and  all-embracing 
compassion, as well as, at the same time, great dignity, exalted awesomeness and honour. 
Now  generosity  requires  liberality;  compassion  cannot  dispense  with  beneficence;  and 
awesomeness and honour make it imperative that the discourteous be chastised. But not 
even a thousandth part of what that generosity and awesomeness require is to be seen in 
this realm. The oppressor retains  his power, and  the oppressed, his  humiliation, as they 
both depart and migrate from this realm. Their affairs are, then, left to the same Supreme 
Tribunal of which we speak. 

• Third Aspect:  See with what lofty wisdom and ordering affairs are managed, and 
with what true justice and  balance transactions are effected! Now a wise polity requires 
that those who seek refuge under the protecting wing of the state should receive favour, 
and justice demands that the rights of subjects be preserved, so that the splendour of the 
state should not suffer. But here in this land, not a thousandth part of the requirements of 
such wisdom and justice is fulfilled; for example, empty-headed people such as yourself 
usually  leave  this  realm  unpunished.  So  again  we  say,  matters  are  postponed  for  the 
consideration of a Supreme Tribunal. 

•  Fourth  Aspect:  Look  at these  innumerable  and  peerless  jewels  that  are  displayed 
here, these unparalleled dishes laid out like a banquet! They demonstrate that the ruler of 
these  lands  is  possessed  of  infinite  generosity  and  an  inexhaustible  treasury.  Now  such 
generosity and such a treasury  

 

62

deserve  and  require  a  bounteous  display  that  should  be  eternal  and  include  all  possible 
objects  of  desire.  They  further  require  that  all  who  come  as  guests  to  partake  of  that 
display should be there eternally and not suffer the pain of death and separation. For just 
as the cessation of pain is pleasurable, so too is the cessation of pleasure painful! Look at 
these  displays  and  the  announcements  concerning  them!  And  listen  to  these  heralds 
proclaiming the fine and delicate arts of a miracle-working monarch, and demonstrating 
his perfections! They are declaring his peerless and invisible beauty, and speaking of the 
subtle manifestations of his hidden beauteousness; he must be possessed, then, of a great 
and astounding invisible beauty and perfection. This flawless hidden perfection requires 
one who will appreciate and admire it, who will gaze on it exclaiming, Ma’shallah!, thus 
displaying it and making it known. 

As for concealed and peerless beauty, it too requires to see and be seen, or rather to 
behold  itself  in two ways. The  first consists of contemplating  itself  in different mirrors, 
and  the  second  of  contemplating  itself  by  means  of  the  contemplation  of  enraptured 
spectators  and  astounded  admirers.  Hidden  beauty  wishes,  then,  to  see  and  be  seen,  to 
contemplate itself eternally and be contemplated without cease. It desires also permanent 
existence for those who gaze upon it in awe and rapture. For eternal beauty can never be 
content with a transient admirer; moreover, an admirer destined to perish without hope of 
return  will  find  his  love  turning  to  enmity  whenever  he  imagines  his  death,  and  his 
admiration and respect will yield to contempt. It is in man’s nature to hate the unknown 
and the unaccustomed. Now everyone leaves the hospice of this realm very quickly and 
vanishes, having seen only a light or a shadow of the perfection and beauty for no more 
than a moment, without in any way being satiated. Hence, it is necessary that he should 
go towards an eternal realm where he will contemplate the Divine beauty and perfection. 
•  Fifth  Aspect:    See,  it  is  evident  from  all  these  matters that that  peerless  Being  is 
possessed of most great mercy. For he causes aid to be swiftly extended to every victim 
of  misfortune,  answers  every  question  and  petition;  and  mercifully  fulfils  even  the 
lowliest need of his lowliest subject. If, for example, the foot of some herdsman’s sheep 
should hurt, he either provides some medicine or sends a veterinarian. 

Come now, let us go; there is a great meeting on that island. All the nobles of the land 
are  assembled  there.  See,  a  most  noble  commander,  bearing  exalted  decorations,  is 
pronouncing a discourse, and requesting certain things from that compassionate monarch. 
All those present say: “Yes, we too desire the same,” and affirm and assent to his words. 
Now listen to the words of that commander favoured by his monarch: 

“O monarch that nurtures us with his bounty! Show us the source and origin of these 

examples and shadows you have shown us! Draw us nigh to  

 

63

your  seat  of  rule;  do  not  let  us  perish  in  these  deserts!  Take  us  into  your  presence  and 
have mercy on us! Feed us there on the delicious bounty you have caused us to taste here! 
Do  not  torment  us  with  desperation  and  banishment!  Do  not  leave  your  yearning, 
thankful and obedient subjects to their own devices; do not cause them to be annihilated!” 
Do you not hear him thus supplicating? Is it at all possible that so merciful and powerful 
a  monarch  should  not  totally  fulfil  the  finest  and  highest  aim  of  his  most  beloved  and 
noble commander? 

Moreover, the purpose of that commander is the purpose of all men, and its fulfilment 
is required by the pleasure, the compassion and the justice of the king, and it is a matter 
of  ease  for  him,  not  difficulty,  causing  him  less  difficulty  than  the  transient  places  of 
enjoyment contained  in the  hospice of the world. Having  spent so much effort on these 
places  of  witnessing  that  will  last  only  five  or  six  days,  and  on  the  foundation  of  this 
kingdom, in order to demonstrate instances of his power, he will, without doubt, display 
at his seat of rule true treasures, perfections and skills in such a manner, and open before 
us such spectacles, that our intellects will be astonished. 

Those sent to this field of trial will not, then, be left to their own devices; palaces of 

bliss or dungeons await them. 

•  Sixth  Aspect:    Come  now,  look!  All  these  imposing  railways,  planes,  machines, 
warehouses,  exhibitions  show  that  behind  the  veil  an  imposing  monarch  exists  and 
governs.3 

                                                

3 When a vast army in the present age receives the order, “take up your weapons and fix your 

bayonets,” in accordance with the rules of war while on manœuvre, it comes to resemble a forest of upright 
oaks. Similarly, when the soldiers of a garrison are commanded on festive days to don their parade 
uniforms and pin on their medals, it will resemble from one end to the other a colourful and ornate garden, 
where all the flowers have blossomed. Conversely, when on the parade-ground of the world, the various 
and infinite species of the soldiery of the Pre-Eternal Monarch —angels, jinn, men, animals and even 
unfeeling plants— receive the order of “Be!” And it is in the struggle for life’s preservation and the 
command, “take up your weapons and equipment, and prepare to defend yourselves,” when they fix the 
minute bayonets that are the spiked trees and plants found throughout the world, — then they resemble a 
magnificent army advancing with bayonets fixed. 

Similarly, each day and each week of the spring is like a festival for each class of the vegetable 

kingdom, and each class presents itself to the witnessing gaze of the Pre-Eternal Monarch with the jewelled 
decorations He has given them, as if it were on parade in order to display the fine gifts He has bestowed on 
them. It is as if all the plants and trees were heeding a dominical command, don the bejewelled garments 
produced by God’s artistry, put on the decorations made by His creative power — flowers and fruit. The 
face of the earth then comes to represent a parade-ground on a splendid festive day, a magnificent parade 
brilliant with the uniforms and jewelled decorations of the soldiers. 

Such wise and well-ordered arrangement and ornament demonstrates of a certainty, to all who are not 

blind, that they derive from the command of a monarch infinite in power and unlimited in wisdom. 

 

64

Such a monarch requires subjects worthy of himself. But now you see all his subjects 
gathered in a hospice for wayfarers, a hospice that is filled and emptied each day. It can 
also  be  said  that  his  subjects  are  now  gathered  in  a  testing-ground  for  the  sake  of 
manoeuvres,  and  this  ground  also  changes  each  hour.  Again,  we  may  say  that  all  his 
subjects  stay  in  an  exhibition-hall  for  a  few  minutes  to  behold  specimens  of  the 
monarch’s beneficence, valuable products of his miraculous art. But the exhibition itself 
changes  each  moment.  Now  this  situation  and  circumstance  conclusively  shows  that 
beyond  the  hospice,  the  testing-ground,  the  exhibition,  there  are  permanent  palaces, 
lasting  abodes,  and  gardens  and  treasuries  full  of the  pure  and  elevated  originals  of  the 
samples and shapes we see in this world. It is for the sake of these that we exert ourselves 
here.  Here  we  labour,  and  there  we  receive  our  reward.  A  form  and  degree  of  felicity 
suited to everyone’s capacity awaits us there. 

•  Seventh  Aspect:    Come,  let  us  walk  a  little,  and  see  what  is  to  be  found  among 
these civilized people. See, in every place, at every corner, photographers are sitting and 
taking  pictures.  Look,  everywhere  there  are  scribes  sitting  and  writing  things  down. 
Everything is being recorded. They are registering the least significant of deeds, the most 
commonplace  of  events.  Now  look  up  at  the  tall  mountain;  there  you  see  a  supreme 
photographer installed, devoted to the service of the king;4 he is taking pictures of all that 
happens  in  the  area.  The  king  must,  then,  have  issued  this  order;  “Record  all  the 
transactions  made  and  deeds  performed  in  the  kingdom.”  In  other  words,  that  exalted 
personage  is  having  all  events  registered  and  photographically  recorded.  The  precise 
record he is keeping must without doubt be for the sake of one day calling his subjects to 
account. 

Now  is  it  at  all  possible  that  an  All-Wise  and  All-Preserving  Being,  who  does  not 
neglect  the  most  banal  doings  of  the  lowest  of  his  subjects,  should  not  record the  most 
significant  deeds  of  the  greatest  among  his  subjects,  should  not  call  them  to  account, 
should not reward and punish them? After all, it is those foremost among his subjects that 
perform  deeds  offensive  to  his  glory,  contrary  to  his  pride  and  unacceptable  to  his 
compassion, and those deeds remain unpunished in this world. It must be, therefore, that 
their judgement is postponed to a Supreme Court. 

                                                

4 Some of the truths indicated in this parable have been set forth in the Seventh Truth. However, let us 

point out here that the figure of the “supreme photographer devoted to the service of the king” is an 
indication of the Preserved Tablet. The reality and existence of the Preserved Tablet has been proved in the 
Twenty-Sixth Word as follows: a little portfolio suggests the existence of a great ledger; a little document 
points to the existence of a great register; and little drops point to the existence of a great water tank. So too 
the retentive faculties of men, the fruits of trees, the seeds and kernels of fruit, being each like a little 
portfolio, a Preserved Tablet in miniature or a drop proceeding from the pen that inscribes the great 
Preserved Tablet — they point to, indicate and prove the existence of a Supreme Retentive Faculty, a great 
register, an exalted Preserved Tablet. Indeed, they demonstrate this visibly to the perceptive intellect. 

 

65

• Eighth Aspect:  Come, let me read to you the decrees issued by that monarch. See, 
he repeatedly makes the following promises and dire threats: “I will take you from your 
present abode and bring you to the seat of my rule. There I shall bestow happiness on the 
obedient and imprison the disobedient. Destroying that temporary abode, I shall found a 
different realm containing eternal palaces and dungeons.”  

He can easily fulfil the promises that he makes, of such importance for his subjects. It 
is, moreover, incompatible with his pride and his power that he should break his promise. 
So look, o confused one! You assent to the claims of your mendacious imagination, your 
distraught  intellect,  your  deceptive  soul,  but  deny  the  words  of  a  being  who  cannot  be 
compelled  in  any  fashion  to  break  his  promise,  whose  high  stature  does  not  admit  any 
such faithlessness, and to whose truthfulness all visible deeds bear witness. Certainly you 
deserve a great punishment. You resemble a traveller who closes his eyes to the light of 
the sun and  looks  instead upon his own  imagination. His  fancy wishes to illuminate his 
awesomely dark path with the light of his brain, although it is no more than a glow-worm. 
Once that monarch makes a promise, he will by all means fulfil it. Its fulfilment is most 
easy for him, and moreover most necessary for us and all things, as well as for him too 
and his kingdom. 

There is therefore, a Supreme Court, and a lofty felicity. 
• Ninth Aspect:  Come now! Look at the heads of these offices and groups.5 Each has 
a private telephone to speak personally with the king. Sometimes too they go directly to 
his presence. See what they say and unanimously report, that the monarch has prepared a 
most  magnificent  and  awesome  place  for  reward  and  punishment.  His  promises  are 
emphatic and his threats are most stern. His pride and dignity are such that he would in 
no way stoop to the abjectness inherent in the breaking of a promise. The bearers of this 
report, who are so numerous as to be universally accepted, further report with the strong 
unanimity  of  consensus  that  “the  seat  and  headquarters of  the  lofty  monarchy,  some  of 
whose  traces  are  visible  here,  is  in  another  realm  far  distant  from  here.  The  buildings 
existing in this testing-ground are but temporary, and will later be exchanged for eternal 
palaces.  These  places  will  change.  For  this  magnificent  and  unfading  monarchy,  the 
splendour of which is apparent from its works, can in no way be founded or based on so 
transient, impermanent, unstable, insignificant, changing,  

                                                

5 The meanings indicated in this Aspect can be found in the Eighth Truth. For example, by heads of 
offices we mean the prophets and the saints. As for the telephone, it is a link and relation with God that 
goes forth from the heart and is the mirror of revelation and the receptacle of inspiration. The heart is like 
the earpiece of that telephone. 

 

66

defective and imperfect matters. It is based rather on matters worthy of it, eternal, stable, 
permanent and glorious.” 

There is, then, another realm, and of a certainty we shall go toward it. 
• Tenth Aspect:  Come, today is the vernal equinox.6 Certain changes will take place, 
and wondrous things will occur. On this fine spring day, let us go for a walk on the green 
plain adorned with beautiful flowers. See, other people are also coming toward it. There 
must be some magic at work, for buildings that were mere ruins have suddenly sprung up 
again here, and this once empty plain has become like a populous city. See, every hour it 
shows  a  different  scene,  just  like  a  cinema  screen,  and  takes  on  a  different  shape.  But 
notice, too, that among these complex, swiftly  changing and  multifarious scenes perfect 
order  exists,  so  that  all  things  are  put  in  their  proper  places.  The  imaginary  scenes 
presented to us on the cinema  screen  cannot be as well-ordered as this, and  millions of 
skilled magicians would be incapable of this artistry. This monarch whom we cannot see 
must, then, have performed even greater miracles. 

O foolish one! You ask: “How can this vast kingdom be destroyed and re-established 

somewhere else?” 

You  see  that  every  hour  numerous  changes  and  revolutions  occur,  just  like  that 
transfer from one realm to another that your mind will not accept. From this gathering in 
and  scattering  forth  it  can  be  deduced  that  a  certain  purpose  is  concealed  within  these 
visible  and  swift  joinings  and  separations,  these  compoundings  and  dissolvings.  Ten 
years of effort would not be devoted to a joining together destined to last no longer than 
an hour. So these circumstances we witness cannot be ends in themselves; they are a kind 
of parable of something beyond themselves, an imitation of it. That exalted being brings 
them about in miraculous fashion, so that they take shape and then merge, and the result 
is preserved and recorded, in just the same way that every aspect of a manoeuvre on the 
battleground  is written down and recorded. This  implies that proceedings at some great 
concourse and meeting will be based on what happens here. Further, the results of all that 
occurs here will be permanently displayed at some supreme exposition. All the transient 
and  fluctuating  phenomena  we  see  here  will  yield  the  fruit  of  eternal  and  immutable 
form. 

                                                

6 You will find what this Aspect alludes to in the Ninth Truth. The vernal equinox is equivalent to the 
beginning of spring. As for the green plain covered with flowers, this is the face of the earth in springtime. 
The changing scenes and spectacles are an allusion to the different groups of vernal beings, the classes of 
summer creation, and the sustenance for men and animals, that the All-Powerful and Glorious Maker, the 
All-Wise and Beauteous Creator, from the beginning of spring to the end of summer, brings forth in orderly 
succession, renews with the utmost compassion, and despatches uninterruptedly. 

 

67

All  the  variations  we  observe  in  this  world  are  then,  for  the  sake  of  a  supreme 

happiness, a lofty tribunal, for the sake of exalted aims as yet unknown to us. 

•  Eleventh  Aspect:    Come,  o obstinate  friend!  Let  us  embark  on  a  plane  or  a train 
travelling east or west, that is, to the past or the future. Let us see what miraculous works 
that being has accomplished in other places. Look, there are marvels on every hand like 
the dwellings, open spaces and exhibitions we see. But they all differ with respect to art 
and  to  form.  Note  well,  however,  what  order  betokening  manifest  wisdom,  what 
indications  of  evident  compassion,  what  signs  of  lofty  justice,  and  what  fruits  of 
comprehensive  mercy,  are  to  be  seen  in  these  transient  dwellings,  these  impermanent 
open  spaces,  these  fleeting  exhibitions.  Anyone  not  totally  devoid  of  insight  will 
understand  a  certainty  that  no  wisdom  can  be  imagined  more  perfect  than  his,  no 
providence  more  beauteous than  his,  no  compassion  more  comprehensive  than  his,  and 
no justice more glorious than his. 

If, for the sake of argument, as you imagine, no permanent abodes, lofty places, fixed 
stations, lasting residences, or resident and contented population existed in the sphere of 
his kingdom; and if the truths of his wisdom, compassion, mercy and justice had no realm 
in which to manifest themselves fully (for this impermanent kingdom is no place for their 
full manifestation) — then we would be obliged to deny the wisdom we see, to deny the 
compassion we observe, to deny the  mercy that  is  in  front of our eyes, and to deny the 
justice  the  signs  of  which  are  evident. This  would  be  as  idiotic  as  denying  the  sun,  the 
light  of  which  we  clearly  see  at  midday.  We  would  also  have  to  regard  the  one  from 
whom proceed all these wise measures we see, all these generous acts, all these merciful 
gifts, as a vile gambler or treacherous tyrant (God forbid!). This would be to turn truth on 
its head. And turning a truth into its opposite is impossible, according to the unanimous 
testimony of all rational beings, excepting only the idiot sophists who deny everything. 

There is, then, a realm apart from the present one. In it, there is a supreme tribunal, a 
lofty  place  of  justice,  an  exalted  place  of  reward,  where  all  this  compassion,  wisdom, 
mercy and justice will be made fully manifest. 

•  Twelfth  Aspect:    Come,  let  us  return  now.  We  will  speak  with  the  chiefs  and 
officers of these various groups, and looking at their equipment will inquire whether that 
equipment has been given them only for the sake of subsisting for a brief period in that 
realm, or whether it has been given for the sake of obtaining a long life of bliss in another 
realm.  Let  us  see.  We  cannot  look  at  everyone  and  his  equipment.  But  by  way  of 
example, let us look at the identity card and register of this officer. On his card, his rank, 
salary, duty, supplies and instructions are recorded. See, this rank has not been awarded 
him for just a few days; it may be given for a prolonged  

 

68

period.  It  says  on  his  card:  “You  will  receive  so  much  salary  on  such-and-such  a  day 
from the treasury.” But the date in question will not arrive for a long time to come, after 
this realm has been vacated. Similarly, the duty mentioned on his card has not been given 
for  this  temporary  realm,  but  rather  for  the  sake  of  earning  a  permanent  felicity  in  the 
proximity of the king. Then, too, the supplies awarded him cannot be merely for the sake 
of subsisting  in this  hospice of a  few days’ duration; they can only  be  for the sake of a 
long and happy life. The instructions make it quite clear that he is destined for a different 
place, that he is working for another realm. 

Now look at these registers. They contain  instructions  for the use and disposition of 
weapons and equipment. If there were no realm other than this, one exalted and eternal, 
that  register  with  its  categorical  instructions  and  that  identity  card  with  its  clear 
information, would both be quite meaningless. Further, that respected officer, that noble 
commander,  that  honoured  chief,  would  fall  to  a  degree  lower  than  that  of  all  men;  he 
would  be  more  wretched,  luckless,  abased,  afflicted,  indigent  and  weak  than  everyone. 
Apply the same principle to everything. Whatever you look upon bears witness that after 
this transient world another and eternal world exists. 

O  friend! This temporary world  is  like a  field. It is  a place of  instruction, a  market. 
Without doubt a supreme tribunal and ultimate happiness will succeed it. If you deny this, 
you will be obliged also to deny the identity cards of all the officers, their equipment and 
their orders;  in  fact,  you will  have to deny too all the order existing  in the country, the 
existence of a government in it and all the measures that the government takes. Then you 
will no longer deserve the name of man or the appellation of conscious. You will be more 
of a fool than the sophists. 

Beware, do not imagine that the proofs of the transfer of creation from one realm to 
another are restricted to these twelve. There are indications and proofs beyond counting 
and  enumeration,  all  showing  that  this  impermanent,  changing  kingdom  will  be 
transformed into a permanent and immutable realm. There are also innumerable signs and 
evidences that men will be taken from this temporary hospice and sent to the eternal seat 
of rule of all creation. 

I will show one proof  in particular that  is  stronger than all the twelve aspects taken 

together. 

Come now, look, in the midst of the great assembly visible in the distance the same 
noble  commander  whom  we  previously  saw  on  the  island,  adorned  with  numerous 
decorations,  is  making  an  announcement.  Let  us  go  and  listen.  See,  that  luminous  and 
most noble commander is conveying a supreme edict, beautifully inscribed. He says: 

“Prepare yourselves; you will go to another and permanent realm, a realm  

 

69

such that this one will appear as a dungeon by comparison. You will go to the seat of rule 
of our king, and there receive his compassion and his bounty, if you heed this edict well 
and obey  it. But  if  you rebel  and disobey  it,  you will  be cast  into awesome dungeons.” 
Such is the message that he conveys. If you look at the decree, you will see that it bears 
such a miraculous seal that it cannot in any way be imitated. Everyone apart from idiots 
such  as  yourself  knows  of  a  certainty  that  the  decree  is  from  the  king.  Moreover,  the 
noble  commander  bears  such  bright  decorations  that  everyone  except  those  blind  like 
yourself understands full well that he is the veracious conveyer of the king’s orders. 

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  the  teaching  of  transfer  from  one  realm  to  another, 
challengingly conveyed  by that noble commander  in the supreme edict he  has received, 
should at all be open to objection? No, it is not possible, unless we deny all that we have 
seen. 

Now, o friend, it is your turn to speak. Say what you have to say. 
“What should I say? What can be said to contradict all of this? Who can speak against 
the sun at midday? I say only: Praise be to God. A hundred thousand thanks that I have 
been  saved  from  the  dominance  of  fancy  and  vain  imagination,  and  delivered  from  an 
eternal dungeon and prison. I have come to believe that there is an abode of felicity in the 
proximity of the monarch, separate from this confused and impermanent hospice.” 

Our comparison indicating the truth of resurrection and the hereafter is now complete. 
Now  with  God’s  grace,  we  will  pass  on  to  the  most  exalted  truth.  We  shall  set  forth 
twelve interrelated Truths, corresponding to the twelve Aspects discussed above, as well 
as an Introduction. 

 
 

 

70

Introduction 

 [By  means  of  a  few  indications,  we  refer  here  to  several  matters  explained 
elsewhere,  that  is,  in  the  Twenty-Second,  Nineteenth  and  Twenty-Sixth 
Words.] 

• First Indication 

three other pairs: 

The  foolish  man  in the previous story and  his trustworthy companion correspond to 

• The instinctual soul and the heart; 
• The students of philosophy and the pupils of the All-Wise Qur’an; 
• The people of unbelief and the community of Islam. 
The worst error and misguidance of the students of philosophy, the people of unbelief 
and  the  instinctual  soul,  lies  in  not  recognizing  God.  Just  as  in  the  preceding  story  the 
trustworthy  man  said,  “there  can  be  no  letter  without  a  scribe,  no  law  without  a 
legislator,” we too say the following: 

A  book, particularly one  in each word of which  a  minute pen  has  inscribed another 
whole book, and in each letter of which a fine pen has traced a poem, cannot be without a 
writer;  this  would  be  entirely  impossible.  So  too  this  cosmos  cannot  be  without  its 
inscriber; this is impossible to the utmost degree. For the cosmos is precisely such a book 
that each of its pages includes many other books, each of its words contains a book, and 
each of its letters contains a poem. The face of the earth is but a single page in the book 
of the cosmos. See how many books it contains. Every fruit is a letter, and every seed is a 
dot. In that dot is contained the  index of the whole tree  in  its  vastness.  A  book such as 
this can have been inscribed only by the mighty pen of a Possessor of Glory Who enjoys 
the  attributes  of  splendour  and  beauty,  and  Who  is  the  holder  of  infinite  wisdom  and 
power. Faith, then, follows inevitably on the observation of the world, unless one is drunk 
on misguidance. 

Similarly,  a  house  cannot  arise  without  a  builder,  particularly  a  house  adorned  with 
miraculous  works  of  art,  wondrous  designs,  and  amazing  ornaments.  As  much  art  has 
been put into one of its stones as into a whole palace. No intelligence will accept that it 
could arise without a builder; definitely it needs a master architect. Moreover, within the 
building, veritable  

 

71

rooms take shape and change each hour with the utmost order and ease, just as if clothes 
were  being  changed,  or  as  if  scenes  were  passing  across  a  cinema  screen.  We  can  say 
even that numerous little rooms are constantly being created in each of those scenes. 

In  like  manner,  the  cosmos  also  requires  an  infinitely  wise,  all-knowing  and  all-
powerful maker. For the magnificent cosmos is a palace that has the sun and the moon as 
its  lamps and the stars as  its candles; time  is  like a rope or ribbon  hung within  it, on to 
which the Glorious Creator each year threads a new world. And within the world that He 
thus  threads  on  the  string  of  time  He  places  three  hundred  and  sixty  fresh  and  orderly 
forms. He changes them with the utmost orderliness and wisdom. He has made the face 
of the earth a bounteous spread that He adorns each spring with three hundred thousand 
species of creation, that He fills with innumerable kinds of generous gifts. This He does 
in  such  a  fashion  that  they  all  stand  apart  from  each  other,  quite  separate  and  distinct, 
despite their being at the same time so close and intermingled. Is it possible to overlook 
the existence of the Maker of such a palace? 

Again, to deny the existence of the  sun, on a cloudless day at noon, when  its traces 
are to be observed and  its reflection  is to be seen  in every  bubble on the surface of the 
ocean, in every shining object on dry land, and in every particle of snow — to make such 
a denial would be to rave like the deranged. For if one denied and refused to accept the 
existence of the single, unique  sun,  he would  be  compelled to accept the existence of a 
whole  series  of  minor  suns,  each  real  and  existent  in  its  own  right,  as  numerous  as  the 
drops  and  bubbles  of  the  ocean,  as  countless  as  the  particles  of  snow.  It  would  be 
necessary  to  believe  that  each  minute  particle  contains  a  huge  sun,  even  though  the 
particle is large enough only to contain itself. It would be an even greater sign of lunacy 
and  misguidance  to  refuse  one’s  assent  to  the  attributes  of  perfection  of  the  Glorious 
Creator,  even  while  beholding  the  well-ordered  cosmos  that  is  constantly  changing  in 
wise and regular  fashion, that is  being ceaselessly renewed  in disciplined  manner. This, 
too,  would  be  like  the  ravings  of  a  lunatic,  since  it  would  then  become  necessary  to 
believe and accept that absolute divinity is present in all things, even a particle. For every 
particle of air is somehow able to enter and work its effects upon every flower, fruit and 
leaf, and unless the particle be entrusted with this task by a Creator, it must know of itself 
the structure and form of all the objects it penetrates and affects. In other words, it must 
possess all-encompassing power and knowledge. 

Every particle of soil is potentially capable of giving rise to all the different seeds that 
exist.  If  it  is  not  acting  under  command,  it  must  contain  within  itself  equipment  and 
instruments  corresponding  to  all  the  various  trees  and  plants  in  the  world.  Or,  to  put  it 
differently, one must attribute to the particle  

 

72

such artistry and power that it is aware of the structure of each of them, knows the forms 
that  each  of  them  is  caused  to  assume,  and  is  capable  of  fashioning  those  forms.  The 
same is true with respect to the particle and other realms of creation. 

From  this  you  can  understand  that  in  all  things  there  are  numerous  and  manifest 
proofs  of  God’s  Unity.  To  create  all  things  from  one  thing,  and  to  make  all  things  into 
one  thing,  is  a  task  possible  only  for  the  Creator of  all  things.  Pay  heed  to the  sublime 
declaration:  “There  is  naught but proclaims His  Glory with praise.” For  if one does not 
accept God, the One and Unique, one must accept gods as numerous as created beings. 

• Second Indication 

In our story, we made mention of a Most Noble Commander and said that whoever is 
not blind and sees his decorations and medals will understand that he acts in accordance 
with  the  commands  of  a  monarch  and  is  his  favoured  servant.  Now  that  Most  Noble 
Commander is the Most Noble Messenger of God, may peace and blessings be upon him. 
The  sacred  Creator  of  so  ornamented  a  cosmos  must  of  necessity  have  a  Noble 
Messenger, just as the sun must of necessity have light. For the sun cannot exist without 
giving  light,  and  Divinity  cannot  be  without  showing  itself  through  the  sending  of 
prophets. Is it at all possible that a beauty of utter perfection should not desire to manifest 
itself by means of one who will demonstrate and display it? 

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  a  perfection  of  beauteous  artistry  should  not  desire  to  make 

itself known by means of a herald that will draw men’s gazes upon it? 

Is it at all possible that the universal monarchy of all-embracing dominicality should 
not  desire  to  announce  its  unity  and  eternal  besoughtedness  throughout  the  different 
levels of multiplicity and particularity by means of an envoy possessing two aspects? By 
the  two  aspects,  we  mean  that  he  is  both  the  envoy  of  the  realm  of  multiplicity  to  the 
Divine  Court,  by  virtue  of  his  universal  worship,  and  also  the  messenger  of  the  Divine 
Court to the realm of multiplicity, by virtue of his closeness to God and being entrusted 
with His message. 

Is it at all possible that a possessor of infinite inherent beauty should not wish both to 
behold  himself  and  to  display  to others,  in  numerous  mirrors, the  charms  of  his  beauty 
and  the  allurements  of  his  fairness?  God’s  Messenger  is  His  beloved,  making  himself 
beloved of Him by means of his worship and holding up a mirror to Him, and he is also 
the bearer of His  message,  making Him  beloved  of  men and demonstrating to them the 
beauty of His Names. 

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  the  owner  of  treasuries  full  of  wondrous  miracles,  rare  and 

valuable items, should not wish and desire to display them to men’s  

 

73

gaze by means of an expert jeweller, and eloquent describer, thereby revealing his hidden 
perfections? 

Is it at all possible that the One Who manifests the perfection of all His Names in the 
cosmos by means of artful adornment for men to look upon, so that the cosmos comes to 
resemble  a  palace  decorated  with  all  kinds  of  wondrous  and  subtle  art,  should  not  also 
designate a teacher and a guide to the wonders of his creation? 

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  the  Lord  of  the  cosmos  should  not  solve,  by  means  of  a 
messenger, the complex talisman of the aim and purpose of all the changes that take place 
in  the  cosmos,  and  the  riddle  contained  in  the  three  difficult  questions  posed  by  all 
beings: “What is our origin? What is our destination? What is our purpose?” 

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  the  Glorious  Maker  Who  makes  Himself  known  to  sentient 
beings  by  means  of  His  fair  creation,  and  Who  makes  himself  loved  by  means  of  His 
precious  bounties,  should  not  also  communicate  to  sentient  beings,  by  means  of  a 
messenger, what His pleasure desires of them in exchange? 

Is it at all possible that God should create mankind in a form predisposing it to suffer 
the  consciousness  of  multiplicity  but  also  containing  the  ability  to  engage  in  universal 
worship, without at the same time wishing to turn it away from multiplicity to unity, by 
means of a teacher and guide? 

There are numerous other functions of prophethood, each of which is a decisive proof 

that Divinity necessarily implies messengership. 

Did  anyone  ever  appear  in  the  world  more  worthy  and  more  in  possession  of  the 
abovementioned  qualities  and  functions  than  Muhammad,  the  Arabian  Prophet,  may 
peace and blessings be upon him? Has time ever shown us one more fitting and suited to 
the rank of messengerhood and the task of conveying God’s message? No, by no means! 
He  is  the  master  of  all  messengers,  the  foremost  of  all  prophets,  the  leader  of  all  pure 
ones, the closest to God of all those who have drawn nigh unto Him, the most perfect of 
all creatures, the monarch of all guides to righteousness. 

Quite  apart  from  the  countless  indications  of  his  prophethood  deriving  from  more 
than a thousand miracles, such as the splitting of the moon and the flowing of water from 
his  fingers,  that  all  scholars  unanimously  confirm, the  supreme  miracle  of  the  Glorious 
Qur’an —an ocean of truth and a  book miraculous  in  forty different respects—  is  itself 
enough to demonstrate his prophethood as clearly as the sun. Since we discuss the forty 
different  aspects  of  the  Qur’an’s  miraculousness  in  other  treatises,  particularly  the 
Twenty-Fifth Word, we curtail our discussion of the matter here. 

 

74

• Third Indication 

Let  it  not  be  thought  that  petty  man  is  too  insignificant  for  this  vast  world  to  be 
brought  to  an  end  and  another  realm  to  be  unfolded  simply  for  the  sake  of  his  being 
brought to account. For apparently petty man bears great importance as the master of all 
creatures, by  virtue of the comprehensiveness of  his disposition, as the  herald of God’s 
monarchy, and the manifester of universal worship. Also let nobody ask: “How can one 
earn  eternal  torment  in  the  course  of  a  very  brief  life?”  For  unbelief  seeks  to  drag 
creation, something as valuable and exalted as a letter written by God, down to the depths 
of  meaninglessness  and  purposelessness.  It  is  an  insult  to  all  being,  since  it  denies  and 
rejects  the  manifestations  and  impresses  of  God’s  Sacred  Names  that  are  visible  in  all 
being,  and  it  seeks  to  negate  all  the  infinite  proofs  that  demonstrate  the  veracity  and 
truthfulness  of  God  Almighty.  Hence,  unbelief  is  a  crime  of  infinite  proportions, 
deserving of infinite punishment. 

• Fourth Indication 

In  the  story,  we  saw  by  means  of  twelve  aspects  that  a  king  who  had  one  realm 
resembling  a  transient  hospice  must  of  a  necessity  have  another  realm,  one  eternal  and 
permanent, manifesting his splendour and the sublimity of his power. In the same way, it 
is not at all possible that the Eternal Creator of the transient world should not create also 
an  eternal  realm.  It  is  not  possible  that  the  Everlasting  Maker  of  this  fine  but  unstable 
cosmos, should not create another cosmos, permanent and lasting. It is not possible that 
the Wise, Powerful and Merciful Creator of this world, which is like an exhibition, or a 
testing-ground, or a field, should not create also a hereafter in which the purposes of this 
world shall be made manifest. Entry is to be had to this truth by means of twelve gates, 
and the twelve gates are to be unlocked by means of twelve other truths. We will begin 
with the shortest and simplest of them: 

FIRST TRUTH 
The Gate of Dominicality and Sovereignty, 
the Manifestation of the Name of Sustainer 

Is  it at all possible that the glory of God’s dominicality and His Divine sovereignty 
should create a cosmos such as this,  in order to display His perfections, with  such  lofty 
aims  and  elevated  purposes,  without  establishing  a  reward  for  those  believers  who 
through  faith  and  worship  respond  to  these  aims  and  purposes?  Or  that  He  should  not 
punish those misguided ones who treat His purposes with rejection and scorn? 

 

75

SECOND TRUTH 
The Gate of Generosity and Mercy, 
the Manifestation of the Names of Generous and Merciful 

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  the  Lord  of  this  world,  Who  in  His  works  demonstrates 
infinite  generosity,  infinite  mercy,  infinite  splendour  and  infinite  glory,  should  not  give 
reward  in  a  manner  befitting  His  generosity  and  mercy,  and  not  punish  in  a  manner 
befitting His splendour and glory? If one looks at the disposition of affairs in this world, 
one  sees  that  all  animate  beings  —from  the  weakest  to  the  most  powerful—  are  given 
some fitting form of sustenance.7 Indeed, the weakest and most powerless are given the 
best  form  of  sustenance.  This  largesse  and  bounty  is  distributed  with  such  lofty 
generosity that a hand of infinite generosity is manifestly at work. 

For example, in the spring, all the trees are garbed in clothes as fine as silk, just like 
the houris  in Paradise; they are encrusted with  flowers and  fruits, as  if with  jewels, and 
caused  to  offer  us  numerous  varieties  of  the  choicest  fruits,  on  branches  delicately 
outstretched  like  the  hands  of  a  servant.  Similarly,  we  are  given  wholesome  and  sweet 
honey  to  eat,  from  the  hand  of  the  bee  with  its  sting;  we  are  clothed  in  the  finest  and 
softest of clothes by means of an insect that has no hands; and within a small seed a great 
treasure of  mercy  is  preserved  for  us.  It  is  self-evident  that  all  of  this  is  the  effect  of  a 
most beauteous generosity, a most delicate sense of mercy. 

Then, too, the fact that, with the exception of man and certain wild animals, all things, 
from  the  sun,  the  moon  and  earth  to  the  smallest  of  creatures,  perform  their  functions 
with  the  utmost  exactitude,  do  not  overstep  their  bounds  by  an  inch,  and  observe  a 
universal obedience in a spirit of great awe — this shows that they act by the command 
of a Possessor of great glory and dignity. It is also apparent that the fashion in which all 
mothers,  in the  vegetable, animal and human realms,  succour their weak  and powerless 
infants  with  the  delicate  nurture  of  milk,  in  tender  compassion,  is  a  manifestation  of 
God’s all-embracing mercy.8 

                                                

7 All licit nourishment is obtained not through the exercise of strength, but through the existence of 
need. The decisive proof of this is that powerless infants enjoy the finest of livelihoods, while strong wild 
beasts suffer from all kinds of deficiency, and that fish, for all their lack of intelligence, wax fat, while the 
cunning fox and monkey remain thin in their quest for livelihood. There is, therefore, an inverse 
relationship between sustenance on the one hand and strength and will power on the other. The more one 
relies on strength and will power the more difficult it will be to sustain one’s livelihood. 

8 The fact that a hungry lion will prefer its offspring to itself, and give to it a piece of meat it would 
otherwise have eaten; that the cowardly rabbit will attack a lion in order to protect its young; that the fig-
tree contents itself with mud while giving pure milk to its offspring, the fruit — this shows to anyone not 
blind that they act in accordance with the commands of a Being infinitely merciful, generous and solicitous. 
Again, the fact that even unconscious plants and beasts function in the wisest and most conscious of 
fashions demonstrates irrefutably that One Utterly Knowing and All-Wise has set them to work, and that 
they are acting in His name. 

 

76

Since  the  master  of  this  world  has,  then,  such  infinite  generosity,  mercy,  splendour 
and glory, it follows that His infinite glory and splendour require the chastisement of the 
discourteous; that His infinite generosity requires infinite bounty, and His infinite mercy 
requires a bestowal of favour worthy of itself. Now in this transitory world and brief life, 
only a millionth part of all this, like one drop from the ocean, establishes and manifests 
itself. There must therefore be a realm of blessedness appropriate to that generosity and 
worthy of that mercy. One would otherwise have to deny the existence of the mercy that 
is visible to us, and this would be like denying the existence of the sun that fills every day 
with its light. For irrevocable death would transform compassion into disaster, love into 
affliction, blessing into vengeance, intellect into a tool of misery, and pleasure into pain, 
so that the very essence of God’s mercy would vanish. 

There  must  in  addition  be  a  realm  of  punishment  appropriate  to  God’s  glory  and 
dignity.  For  generally  the  oppressor  leaves  this  world  while  still  in  possession  of  his 
might, and the oppressed while still subjected to humiliation. These matters are therefore 
deferred  for  the  attention  of  a  supreme  tribunal;  it  is  not  that  they  are  neglected.  It 
sometimes  happens too that punishment  is enacted  in this world. The torments suffered 
by disobedient and rebellious peoples  in previous centuries  show that man  is  not left to 
his  own  devices,  and  that  he  is  always  subject  to  the  blows  that  God’s  splendour  and 
majesty may choose to inflict on him. 

Is it at all possible that man should have the most important duty in all of creation and 
be  endowed  with  the  most  important  capacities;  that  man’s  Sustainer  should  make 
Himself  known  to  him  with  all  His  well-ordered  works,  and  man  should  then  fail  to 
recognize Him in return by way of worship — or that God should make Himself beloved 
of  men through the  numerous adorned  fruits of  His  mercy, and  man  should then  fail to 
make  himself  beloved  of  God  through  worship  —  or that  God  should  demonstrate  His 
love  and  mercy  to  man  through  His  variegated  bounties  and  man  should  then  fail  to 
respect Him with thanks and with praise  —  is  it  at all possible that  man should remain 
unpunished,  left  to  his  own  devices,  or  that  that  powerful  Possessor  of  splendour  and 
glory should not make ready for him a realm of requital? 

Is it at all possible, on the other hand, that He should not prepare a realm of reward 
and  eternal  bliss  for  those  believers  who  respond  to  the  Merciful  and  Compassionate 
One’s  making  Himself  known  by  recognizing  Him  in  faith;  to  His  making  Himself 
beloved by loving Him in worship; and to His mercy by offering thanks and veneration? 

 

77

THIRD TRUTH 
The Gate of Wisdom and Justice, 
the Manifestation of the Names of Wise and Just 

Is  it  at  all  possible9  that  the  Lord  of  Glory,  Who  demonstrates  His  dominical 
sovereignty in the wisdom and order, the justice and equilibrium that pervade all things, 
from the atom to the sun, should  not bestow favour on those believers who seek refuge 
beneath the protective wing of His dominicality, who believe in His Wisdom and Justice, 
and whose acts are for the purpose of worshipping Him? 

Again, is it possible that He should not chastise those rude and discourteous men who 
disbelieve in His wisdom and justice, and rebel against Him in insolence? Now not even 
a  thousandth  part  of  that  wisdom  and  justice  is  exercised  with  respect  to  man,  in  this 
transient world; it is rather deferred. Most of the people of misguidance leave this world 
unpunished, and most of the people of guidance leave it unrewarded. All things are, then, 
postponed for a supreme tribunal, an ultimate bliss. 

Yes, it is apparent that the Being Who controls this world does so in accordance with 
an infinite wisdom. Do you require a proof? It is the preservation of interest and benefit 
in  all  things.  Do  you  not  see that  numerous  wise  benefits  are  intended  in  all  the  limbs, 
bones and veins of man, even in the cells of his brain and in every particle of his body? 
Do  you  not  see  that  from  certain  limbs  wise  benefits  are  to  be  had  as  numerous  as  the 
fruits  of  a  tree?  All  of  this  shows  that  matters  are  done  in  accordance  with  infinite 
wisdom. The existence of the utmost regularity in the making of all things is a proof of 
the same truth. 

The compression of the exact programme of development of a beautiful flower into a 
minute seed, the inscription on a small seed by the pen of destiny of the scroll of deeds of 
a tree, its life-history and list of equipment, show that a pen of utmost wisdom is at work. 
The existence of a high degree of fine artistry in all things proves that there exists also 

the impress of an infinitely Wise Maker. Further, the  

                                                

9 The sentence “is it at all possible?” is indeed repeated many times, because it expresses a most 
significant mystery. Misguidance and lack of belief generally spring from the habit of imagining things to 
be impossible, far removed from the realm of reason, and therefore denying them. Now in this discussion 
of resurrection it has been decisively demonstrated that true impossibility, absurdity and irrationality 
pertain to the path of misbelief and the road of misguidance, whereas true possibility, facility and 
rationality are characteristics of the path of faith and highway of Islam. 

In short, the philosophers tend to unbelief on account of their regarding things as impossible, whereas 

the Tenth Word (discussion of resurrection), by means of the repeated sentence, “is it at all possible?” 
shows where impossibility lies, and thus deals them a blow in the mouth.

inclusion within the  minute body of  man of an  index of all  being, of the keys to all the 
treasuries  of  mercy,  and  of  the  mirrors  of  all  the  Divine  Names,  demonstrates  the 
existence of wisdom within that infinitely  fine artistry. Now is  it at all possible that the 
wisdom  that  thus  permeates  the  workings  of  dominicality  should  not  wish  eternally  to 
favour those who seek refuge beneath the wing of dominicality and who offer obedience 
in faith? 

Do  you  wish  for  a  proof  that  all  things  are  done  with  justice  and  balance?  The  fact 
that all things are endowed with being, given shape and put in their appropriate place in 
accordance  with  precise  equilibrium  and  in  appropriate  measure,  shows  that  all  matters 
are done in accordance with infinite justice and balance. 

Similarly,  the  fact  that  all  things  are  given  their  rights  in  accordance  with  their 
disposition, that they receive all the necessities of their being and all the requirements of 
life in the most fitting form — this too is the sign left by a hand of infinite justice. 

Again, the fact that answer is always given to every petition and request made by the 
tongue  of  disposition,  and  of  natural  need  or  necessity,  demonstrates  the  existence  of 
infinite justice and wisdom. 

Now is it at all possible that the justice and wisdom that hasten to relieve the pettiest 
need of the  smallest of creation should  fail to provide  immortality, the greatest need of 
man, the greatest of creatures? That it should fail to respond to his greatest plea and cry 
for  assistance?  Or  that  it  should  not  preserve  the  dignity  of  God’s  dominicality  by 
preserving the rights of His servants? Man, whose life is so brief, cannot experience the 
true  essence  of  justice  in  this  transient  world;  it  is  for  this  reason  that  matters  are 
postponed for a supreme tribunal. For true justice requires that man, this apparently petty 
creature,  should  be  rewarded  and  punished,  not  in  accordance  with  his  pettiness,  but  in 
accordance  with  the  magnitude  of  his  crime,  the  importance  of  his  nature  and  the 
greatness of  his  function. Since this passing and transient world  is  far  from  manifesting 
such wisdom and justice for man, who is created for eternity, of necessity there will be an 
eternal Hell and everlasting Paradise of that Just and Awesome Possessor of Beauty, that 
Wise and Beauteous Possessor of Awe. 

FOURTH TRUTH 
The Gate of Generosity and Beauty, 
the Manifestation of the Names of Generous and Beautiful 

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  infinite  generosity  and  liberality,  inexhaustible  riches, 
unending  treasures,  peerless  and  eternal  beauty,  flawless  and  everlasting  perfection, 
should not require the existence of grateful supplicants,  

 

79

yearning spectators and astounded onlookers, all destined to stay an eternity in an abode 
of bliss, a place of repose? Yes, adorning the face of the world with all these objects of 
beauty, creating the moon and the sun as its lamps, filling the surface of the earth with the 
finest varieties of sustenance and thus making it a banquet of bounty, making fruit-trees 
into so many dishes, and renewing them several times each season — all this shows the 
existence  of  infinite  generosity  and  liberality.  Such  unending  liberality  and  generosity, 
such inexhaustible treasures of mercy, require the existence of an abode of repose, a place 
of  bliss,  that  shall  be  everlasting  and  contain  all  desirable  objects  within  it.  They  also 
require that those who enjoy such bliss should remain  in that abode of repose eternally, 
without suffering the pain of cessation and separation. For just as the cessation of pain is 
a  form  of  pleasure,  so  too  the  cessation  of  pleasure  is  a  form  of  pain,  one  that  such 
infinite generosity is unwilling to countenance. It requires, then, the existence both of an 
eternal paradise and of supplicants to abide in it eternally. 

Infinite  generosity  and  liberality  desire  to  bestow  infinite  bounty  and  infinite 
kindness.  The  bestowal  of  infinite  bounty  and  infinite  kindness  require  in  turn  infinite 
gratitude. This necessitates the perpetual existence of those who receive all the kindness 
so  that they  can  demonstrate their  thanks  and  gratitude  for  that  perpetual  bestowal  and 
constant bounty. A petty enjoyment, made bitter by cessation, and lasting for only a brief 
time, is not compatible with the requirements of generosity and liberality. 

Look too  at the  different  regions  of  the  world,  each  like  an  exhibition  where  God’s 
crafts are displayed. Pay attention to the dominical proclamations in the hands of all the 
plants and animals on the face of the earth10 and listen to the prophets and the saints, the 
heralds  of  the  beauties  of  dominicality.  They  unanimously  display  the  flawless 
perfections of the Glorious Maker by demonstrating His miraculous arts, and thus invite 
the gazes of men. 

The Maker of this world has, then, most important, astounding and secret perfections. 
It  is  these  He  wishes  to  display  by  means  of  His  miraculous  arts.  For  secret,  flawless 
perfection wishes to be manifested to those who will appreciate, admire and wonderingly 
gaze at it. Eternal perfection requires eternal manifestation. Such eternal manifestation in 
turn  requires  the  perpetual  existence  of  those  who  are  to  appreciate  and  admire  it.  The 
value of perfection will always sink in the view of its admirer if he is devoid of perpetual 
existence.11 Again, the beauteous, artistic, brilliant and adorned creatures  

                                                

10 The existence of a brightly designed and brilliantly adorned flower, a most artfully conceived and 

bejewelled fruit on a twig as thin as a wire, affixed to a dry, bonelike tree — this is without doubt a 
proclamation to all animate beings of the fine arts produced by a most skilled, wise and miraculous maker. 
This holds true not only of the vegetable kingdom, but also of the animal realm. 

11 There is a proverbial occurrence pertaining to this point. A celebrated beauty once expelled from her 

presence a common man who had become infatuated with her. In order to console himself, he said, “how 
ugly she is!”, thus denying her beauty. 

Once a bear stood beneath a vine trellis, and wished to eat the grapes. But he was unable to reach out 
for the grapes, or to climb up the trellis. So he said to himself, by way of consolation, “the grapes must be 
sour,” and growling went on his way. 

 

80

that cover the  face of the globe,  bear witness to the  fairness of a peerless, transcendent 
beauty,  and  indicate  the  subtle  charms  of  an  unparalleled,  hidden  pulchritude,  just  as 
sunlight  bears  witness  to  the  sun.12  Each  manifestation  of  that  sacred,  transcendent 
beauty,  indicates  the  existence  of  countless  hidden  treasures  in  each  of  God’s  Names. 
Now so exalted, peerless and hidden a beauty, just as it desires to view its own fairness in 
a  mirror and to behold the degrees and  measures of  its  beauty  in an  animate reflection, 
desires also to become  manifest, in order to look on its own beauty through the eyes of 
others. That is, it wishes to look at its own beauty in two ways; firstly, by beholding itself 
in mirrors of variegated colour; secondly, through the gaze of yearning witnesses to itself, 
of bewildered admirers of its beauty. 

In  short,  beauty  and  fairness  desire  to  see  and  be  seen.  Both  of  these  require  the 
existence of yearning witnesses and bewildered admirers. And since beauty and fairness 
are  eternal  and  everlasting,  their  witnesses  and  admirers  must  have  perpetual  life.  An 
eternal  beauty can  never  be satisfied with transient admirers. An admirer condemned to 
irreversible  separation  will  find  his  love  turning  to  enmity  once  he  conceives  of 
separation.  His  admiration  will  yield  to  ridicule,  his  respect  to  contempt.  For  just  as 
obstinate man is an enemy to what is unknown to him, so too he is opposed to all that lies 
beyond  his  reach,  and  love  that  is  not  infinite  will  respond  to  a  beauty  that  deserves 
unending admiration with implicit enmity, hatred and rejection. From this we understand 
the profound reason for the unbeliever’s enmity to God. 

So endless generosity and liberality, peerless fairness and beauty, flawless perfection 
—  all  these  require  the  existence  of  eternally  grateful  and  longing  supplicants  and 
admirers.  But  we  see  in  this  hospice  of  the  world  that  everyone  quickly  leaves  and 
vanishes, having had only a taste of that generosity, enough to whet his appetite but not to 
satiate him, and having seen only a dim light coming from the perfection, or rather a faint 
shadow of its light, without in any way being fully satisfied. It follows, then, that men are 
going toward a place of eternal joy where all will be bestowed on them in full measure. 

In short, just as this world, with all its creatures, decisively demonstrates the existence 
of  the  Glorious  Maker,  so  too  do  His  sacred  attributes  and  Names  indicate,  show  and 
logically require, the existence of the hereafter. 

                                                

12 Although all beings that act as mirrors for God’s beauty constantly vanish and disappear, those that 

succeed them display and manifest in their forms and features the same beauty and fairness. This shows 
that the beauty in question does not belong to them; the visible instances of beauty are rather the signs and 
indications of a transcendent and sacred beauty.

FIFTH TRUTH 
The gate of Compassion and Muhammadan Worship, 
the Manifestation of the Names of 
Answerer of Prayer and Compassionate 

Is it at all possible that a Lord possessing infinite compassion and mercy,  Who most 
compassionately fulfils the smallest need of His lowliest creatures in the most unexpected 
fashion,  Who  heeds  the  muffled  plea  for  help  of  His  most  obscure  creature,  and  Who 
responds to all the petitions He hears, whether vocal or mute — is it at all possible that 
such  a  Lord  should  not  pay  heed  to  the  greatest  petition  of  the  foremost  among  His 
servants,  the  most  beloved  among  his  creatures,  that  He  should  not  hear  and  grant  his 
most  exalted  prayer?  The  kindness  and  ease  manifested  in  the  feeding  and  nurturing  of 
weak and young animals show that the Monarch of the cosmos exercises his dominicality 
with infinite mercy. 

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  a  compassion  merciful  to  this  degree  in  the  exercise  of 
dominicality  should  not  accept  the  prayer  of  the  most  virtuous  and  beautiful  of  all 
creation?13 This truth is explained in the Nineteenth Word, but let us repeat our statement 
of the matter here: 

O  friend  listening  to  these  words  together  with  my  own  soul!  We  said  in  the 
comparison that a  meeting took place on a certain  island, and a  most noble commander 
delivered a speech there. In order to find out the truth indicated in the comparison, come, 
let  us  depart  from  this  age,  and  in  our  mind  and  imagination  travel  to  the  Arabian 
Peninsula  in the  blessed age of the Prophet, in order to visit and watch  him while  he  is 
performing  his  duties  and  engaging  in  worship.  See,  just  as  he  is  the  means  for  the 
attainment of eternal bliss, by means of his messengerhood and guidance, so too he is the 
cause for the existence of that bliss and the means for the creation of Paradise, by means 
of his worship and prayer. 

Now see! That  being  is praying  for eternal  bliss  in  such supreme  supplication, with 
such sublime worship, that it is as  if this  island, or even the whole world,  were praying 
and supplicating together with him. For the worship he performs contains within itself not 
only the worship of the community that  

                                                

13 He whose kingdom has lasted one thousand three hundred and fifty years, who has generally had 

more than three hundred and fifty million subjects, to whom his subjects daily renew their pledge of 
allegiance and to whose perfections they continually bear witness, whose commands are obeyed in perfect 
submission, whose spiritual hue has coloured half of the globe and a fifth of mankind, who is the beloved 
of men’s hearts and the educator of their spirits — such a being is without doubt the greatest servant of the 
Lord Who holds sway over the universe. Also, since most of the realms of beings applauded that being’s 
function and duty through each bearing the fruit of his miracles, he is for sure the most beloved creature of 
the Fashioner of the cosmos. Similarly, the desire for perpetuity existing in all men by virtue of their very 
nature, a desire that lifts men from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high, is the greatest of all 
desires and petitions, fit to be presented to the Provider of all Needs only by the greatest among His 
servants. 

 

82

follows him, but also that of all the other prophets, in its essential form, by virtue of the 
correspondence  existing  between  him  and  them.  Moreover,  he  performs  his  supreme 
prayer and offers his supplications in such a vast congregation that it is as if all luminous 
and  perfect  men,  from  the  time  of  Adam  down  to  the  present,  were  following  him  in 
prayer and saying “amen” to his supplications!14 He is praying for so universal a need —
immortality—  that  not  merely  the  people  of  this  earth,  but  also  the  inhabitants  of  the 
heavens  and  the  entirety  of  creation  are  participating  in  his  supplications  and  silently 
proclaiming, “yes, o Lord! Grant his prayer; we too desire it.” He petitions for everlasting 
bliss with  such touching sadness,  in so  yearning, so longing, and so pleading a  fashion, 
that he causes the whole of the cosmos to weep and thus to share in his prayer. 

See, he desires and prays for bliss, for such a purpose and goal that he elevates man 
and  all  creatures  from  captivity  in  the  abysmal  state  of  utter  annihilation,  from 
worthlessness,  uselessness,  and  purposelessness  to  the  apex  of  preciousness,  eternity, 
exalted function, and the rank of being a script penned by God. 

See, he makes his petition with such elevated plea for succour, makes his supplication 
with  so sweet a request  for  mercy, that  it  is as  if he caused all  beings, the  heavens  and 
God’s  throne  itself  to  listen,  and  to  echo  his  prayer  ecstatically  with  cries  of  “amen,  o 
Lord, amen!”15 

  

                                                

14 From the time that the Prophet (Peace and blessings be upon him) first made his supplication down 

to the present, all the invocations upon him of peace and blessings made by his community are a kind of 
eternal amen to his prayer, a form of universal participation in it. Every invocation of peace and blessings 
upon him by every member of the Muslim community in the course of his prayer, as well as the prayer for 
him uttered after the second call to prayer according to the Shafi‘i school — this too is a powerful and 
universal amen to his supplication for eternal bliss. So the eternity and everlasting bliss desired by all men 
with all of their strength, in accordance with their primordial disposition, is requested in the name of 
humanity by the Prophet (Peace and blessings be upon him), and the luminous segment of humanity says 
“amen” after him. Is it at all possible that such a prayer should not be accepted? 

15 Indeed, it is not at all possible that the Master of this world, all of Whose doings are self-evidently 
inspired by consciousness, knowledge and wisdom, should be unaware and uninformed of the acts of the 
foremost among all of His creatures. Again, it is not at all possible that the All-Knowing Master should 
remain indifferent to the deeds and prayers of that foremost among His creatures, and deem them 
unimportant despite being aware of them. It is further impossible that the Powerful and Merciful Master of 
the World should not accept his prayers, having not remained indifferent to them. Yes, through the light of 
the Muhammadan Being the form of the world has changed. The true essence of men and all beings in the 
cosmos became apparent through that light; it became clear that they are each missives of the Eternally 
Besought One proclaiming the Divine Names, precious and profound beings with God-given functions and 
destined to manifest eternity. Were it not for that light, beings would be condemned to utter annihilation, 
they would be valueless, meaningless, useless, confused, the result of blind chance, sunk in the darkness of 
illusion. It is for this reason that just as men say “amen” to the prayer of the Prophet, so too all other beings, 
from the face of the earth up to God’s throne, from the soil to the stars, all take pride in his light, and 
proclaim their connection with him. The very spirit of the worship of the Prophet is indeed none other than 
this prayer. Again, all the motions and workings of the cosmos are in their essence prayer. For example, the 
progress of a seed until it becomes a tree is a form of prayer to the Creator. 

 

83

See, he requests bliss and eternity  from a Being, One so All-Hearing, Generous and 
Powerful,  so  All-Seeing,  Merciful  and  Knowledgeable  that  He  sees,  hears,  accepts  and 
takes  pity  upon  the  most  secret  wish,  the  slightest  desire  of  the  most  obscure  of  his 
creatures,  this,  in  observable  form.  He  answers  all  pleas  even  if  they  are  silently 
proffered. He bestows all things and answers all pleas in so wise, percipient and merciful 
a fashion that no doubt remains that all that nurturing and regulating can derive only from 
One All-Hearing and All-Seeing, One Generous and Merciful. 

Let us listen to what the Pride of All Being is requesting, that source of honour for all 
of  mankind,  that one  unique  in  all  of  creation,  who  bears  on  his  back  the  burden  of  all 
men, who standing on this earth lifts up his hands towards God’s throne and offers up a 
prayer which in its reality contains the essence of the worship of all of mankind. See, he 
is asking for eternal bliss for himself and for his community. He is asking for eternity and 
Paradise. He  is  making  his plea together with all  the Divine Sacred Names that display 
their  beauty  in  the  mirrors of  all  created  being.  You  can  see,  indeed,  that  he  is  seeking 
intercession from those Names. 

If  there  were  not  countless  reasons  and  causes  for  the  existence  of  the  hereafter,  a 
single prayer of that exalted being would be enough for the creation of Paradise, a task as 
easy for the power of the Merciful Creator as the creation of spring.16 

Indeed,  how  could  the  creation  of  spring  be  difficult  for  the  Possessor  of  Absolute 
Power  Who  each  spring  makes  the  face  of  the  world  into  a  plain  of  resurrection,  and 
brings forth there a hundred thousand examples of resurrection? In just the same way that 
the messengerhood of the Prophet was the reason for the foundation of this realm of trial 
—the  saying  “were  it  not  for  thee,  were  it  not  for  thee,  I  would  not  have  created  the 
spheres”17 being an  indication of this— so too the worship  he performed was the cause 
for the foundation of the abode of bliss. 

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  the  flawless  perfection  of  artistry,  the  peerless  beauty  of 
dominicality  expressed  in  the  order  of  the  world  and  the  comprehensive  mercy  that 
reduce  all  to  bewilderment,  should  not  answer  his  prayer,  and  thus  tolerate  an  extreme 
form of ugliness, cruelty and disorder? Is it possible that it would listen to the most petty 
and insignificant desires and grant them, but dismiss significant and important desires as 
worthless, and fail to  

                                                

16 To display wondrous samples of art, and examples of resurrection on the face of the earth that, 
compared with the hereafter is like a narrow page, to inscribe and include on that single page, in perfect 
order, all the different species of creation, that resemble three hundred thousand separate books, is certainly 
more difficult than building and creating the delicate and symmetrical structure of Paradise in the broad 
realm of eternity. Indeed, it may be said that to whatever degree Paradise is more elevated than the spring, 
to that degree the creation of the gardens of spring is more difficult and wondrous than the creation of 
Paradise. 

17 ‘Ali al-Qari, Sharh al-Shifa, i, 16; al-‘Ajluni, Kashf al-Khafa, ii, 164. 

 

84

fulfil  them?  No,  a  thousand  times  no!  Such  beauty  can  never  accept  such  ugliness  and 
itself become ugly.18 

So  just  as  the  Prophet  opened  the  gates  of  this  world  with  his  messengerhood,  he 

opens the gates of the hereafter with his worship. 

May the blessings of the Compassionate One be  upon him, to the extent of all 
that this world and paradise contain. O God, grant blessings and peace to Your 
servant and Messenger, that Beloved One who is the Master of both Realms, the 
Pride  of  all  the  Worlds,  the  source  of  life  in  both  spheres,  the  means  for  the 
attainment  of  happiness  here  and  in  the  hereafter,  he  who  flies  on  two  wings, 
who is the messenger to both men and jinn — to him, and to his Family, and all 
of  his  Companions,  as  well  as  his  brethren  from  among  the  prophets  and 
messengers. Amen. 

SIXTH TRUTH 
The Gate of Splendour and Eternity, 
the Manifestation of the Names of Glorious and Eternal 

Is it at all possible that the splendour of dominicality that subdues and commands all 
beings,  from  suns  and  trees  down  to  particles,  just  like  obedient  soldiers,  should 
concentrate its entire attention on the wretched and transient beings that pass a temporary 
life  in  the  hospice  of  this  world,  and  not  create  an  eternal  and  everlasting  sphere  of 
splendour, an unending  manifestation of dominicality? The display of Divine  splendour 
in  the  changing  of  the  seasons,  the  sublime  motions  of  the  planets  in  the  heavens  as  if 
they were aeroplanes, the subjugation of all things and the creation of the earth as man’s 
cradle and the sun as his lamp, vast transformations such as the reviving and adornment 
of the dead and dry globe — all of this shows that behind the veil a sublime dominicality 
exists, that a splendid monarchy is at work. 

Now  such  a  dominical  kingdom  requires  subjects  worthy  of  itself,  as  well  as  an 
appropriate mode of manifestation. But look at this hospice of the world, and you will see 
that the  most significant class of  its subjects, endowed with the  most comprehensive of 
functions, are gathered together only temporarily and that, in the most wretched of states. 
The hospice fills and empties each day. All of the subjects stay only temporarily in this 
abode of trial for the sake  

                                                

18 It is unanimously agreed the total reversal of truths is impossible. It is quite impossible that 

something should become the very opposite and reverse of itself, and impossible to the thousandth degree 
that something should retain its own nature, and yet at the same time become identical with its opposite. 
Thus infinite beauty cannot become ugliness, while yet remaining beauty, and, in our example, it is not 
possible that the beauty of dominicality, a beauty perceptible and manifest in its existence, should retain its 
quiddity as the beauty of dominicality, but become the very essence of ugliness. This would be the 
strangest of all impossible and false notions in the world. 

 

85

of  being  tested  in  service.  The  abode  itself  changes  each  hour.  Again,  all  of  the 
monarch’s subjects stay only for a few brief minutes in order to behold the samples of the 
precious  bounty  of  the  Glorious  Maker,  to  look  on  His  miraculous  works  of  art  in  the 
exhibition of the world with the eye of a buyer. Then they disappear. The exhibition itself 
changes  every  minute.  Whoever  leaves  it,  never  returns,  and  whoever  comes  to  it,  will 
ultimately depart. 

Now  this  state  and  circumstance  definitively  shows  that  behind  and  beyond  this 
hospice,  this  testing-ground,  this  exhibition,  there  are  permanent  palaces  and  eternal 
abodes that  fully  manifest and support God’s everlasting  sovereignty; there  are gardens 
and treasure houses full of the pure and exalted originals of the forms and copies we see 
in this world. If we strive here in this world, it is for the sake of what awaits us there. We 
work  here,  and  are  rewarded  there.  Bliss  awaits  everyone  there,  in  accordance  with  his 
capacity, as long as he does not squander his share. Yes, it is impossible that such eternal 
kingship should concentrate exclusively on these wretched transient beings. 

Consider  this  truth  through  the  telescope  of  the  following  comparison.  You  are 
travelling along a road. You see a caravanserai ahead of you on the road, built by a great 
personage  for  people  coming  to  visit  him.  Millions  are  spent  on  the  decoration  of  the 
caravanserai  so  that  guests  should  enjoy  their  one  night’s  stay  there,  and  for  their 
instruction.  But  the  guests  see  very  little  of  those  decorations,  look  at  them  for  a  very 
short time; briefly tasting the joys of what is offered them, they go on their way without 
being  satiated.  But  each  guest  takes  a  photograph  of  the  objects  in  the  caravanserai  by 
means of his special camera. Also, the servants of that great personage record with great 
care the conduct of all the guests and preserve the record. You see, too, that he destroys 
every day most of the valuable decorations, and replaces them with fresh decorations for 
the newly arriving guests. After seeing all this, will any doubt remain that the personage 
who has constructed this caravanserai on the road has permanent and exalted dwellings, 
inexhaustible  and  precious  treasures,  an  uninterrupted  flow  of  great  generosity?  By 
means  of  the  generosity  displayed  in  the  caravanserai,  he  intends  merely  to  whet  the 
appetite of his guests for those things he keeps in his immediate presence; to awaken their 
desire  for  the  gifts  he  has  prepared  for  them.  So  too,  if  you  look  upon  the  state  of  the 
hospice of this world without falling into drunkenness, you will understand the following 
nine principles: 

• First Principle: You will understand that this world does not exist for its own sake, 
any more than does the caravanserai. It is impossible that it should assume this shape by 
itself. Rather, it is a well-constructed hospice, wisely designed to receive the caravan of 
beings that constantly arrive to alight before departing again.

•  Second  Principle:  You  will  understand,  too, that those  living  within  this  hospice 

are guests. They are invited by their Generous Sustainer to the Abode of Peace. 

• Third Principle: You will understand, further, that the adornments of this world are 
not simply for the sake of enjoyment or admiration. For if they yield pleasure for a time, 
they  cause  pain  for  a  longer  time  with  their  cessation.  They  give  you  a  taste  and  whet 
your appetite, but never satiate you. For either the life of the pleasure is short, or your life 
is short, too brief for you to become satiated. These adornments of high value and brief 
duration must, then, be for the sake of instruction in wisdom,19 for arousing gratitude, and 
for encouraging  men to seek out the perpetual originals of  which they are  copies. They 
are, then, for other exalted goals beyond themselves. 

• Fourth Principle: You will understand also that the adornments of this world20 are 
like  samples  and  forms  of  the  blessings  stored  up  in  Paradise  by  the  mercy  of  the 
Compassionate One for the people of faith. 
                                                

19 Now the lifespan of everything is short, although its value is high and the subtleties of its artistry are 

most exalted and beautiful. This implies that everything is only a sample, a form of something else, that it 
has the function of drawing the gaze of the customer to the authentic and original object. This being the 
case, it may be said that the variegated adornments of this world are the samples of the bounties of 
Paradise, prepared by the Compassionate and Merciful One for His beloved servants. 

20 There are numerous purposes for the existence of everything, and numerous results flow from its 
being. These are not restricted to this world and to the souls of men, as the people of misguidance imagine, 
being thus lost in vanity and purposelessness. On the contrary, the purposes for the existence and the results 
of the lives of all things relate to the following three categories. 

The first and the most exalted pertains to the Creator. It consists of presenting to the gaze of the Pre-
Eternal Witness the bejewelled and miraculous wonders He has affixed to the object in question, as if in a 
military parade. To live for a fleeting second is enough to attain that glance. Indeed, the potentiality and 
intent for existence is enough, without ever emerging into life. This purpose is fully realized, for example, 
by delicate creatures that vanish swiftly and by seeds and kernels, each a work of art, that never come to 
life, that is, never bear fruit or flower. They all remain untouched by vanity and purposelessness. Thus the 
first purpose of all things is to proclaim, by means of their life and existence, the miracles of power and the 
traces of artistry of the Maker and display them to the gaze of the Glorious Monarch. 

The second purpose of all existence and the result of all being pertains to conscious creation. 
Everything is like a truth-displaying missive, an artistic poem, or a wise word of the Glorious Maker, 
offered to the gaze of angels and jinn, of men and animals, and desiring to be read by them. It is an object 
for the contemplation and instruction of every conscious being that looks upon it. 

The third purpose of all existence and result of all being pertains to the soul of the thing itself, and 
consists of such minor consequences as the experience of pleasure and joy, and living with some degree of 
permanence and comfort. If we consider the purpose of a servant employed as a steersman on some royal 
ship, we see that only one hundredth of that purpose relates to the steersman himself, the wage he receives; 
ninty-nine hundredths of the purpose relate to the king who owns the ship. A similar relation exists between 
the purpose of a thing related to its own self and its worldly existence, and its purpose related to its Maker. 
In the light of this multiplicity of purposes we can now explain the ultimate compatibility between divine 
wisdom and economy on the one hand, and divine liberality and generosity —in fact, infinite generosity— 
on the other hand, even though they appear to be opposites and contradictory. In the individual purposes of 
things, liberality and generosity predominate, and the Name of Most Generous is manifested. From the 
point of view of individual purpose, fruits and grains are indeed beyond computation, and they demonstrate 
infinite generosity. But in universal purposes, wisdom predominates, and the name of All-Wise is 
manifested. However many purposes a tree has, each of its fruits contains that many purposes, and these 
can be divided into the three categories we have established. Their universal purposes demonstrate an 
infinite wisdom and economy. Infinite wisdom and infinite generosity and liberality are thus combined, 
despite their apparent opposition. For example, one of the purposes for raising an army is the maintenance 
of order. Whatever troops are available for the purpose will suffice or be more than enough. But the whole 
army will be barely enough for other purposes such as protecting the national frontiers and repelling

• Fifth Principle: You will understand, too, that all of these transient objects have not 
been created for the sake of annihilation, in order to appear briefly and then vanish. The 
purpose  for their  creation  is  rather  briefly  to  be  assembled  in  existence  and  acquire  the 
desired form, so that these may be noted, their images preserved, their meanings known, 
and  their  results  recorded.  This  is  so  that,  for  example,  everlasting  spectacles  might  be 
wrought for the people of eternity, and that they might serve other purposes in the realm 
of  eternity.  You  will  understand  that  things  have  been  created  for  eternity,  not  for 
annihilation; and as for apparent annihilation, it has the sense of a completion of duty and 
a release from service, for every transient thing advances to annihilation with one aspect, 
but remains eternally with numerous other aspects. 

Look, for example, at the  flower, a word of God’s power;  for a short time  it  smiles 
and looks at us, and then hides behind the veil of annihilation. It departs just like a word 
leaving  your  mouth.  But  it  does  so  entrusting  thousands  of  its  fellows  to  men’s  ears.  It 
leaves  behind  meanings  in  men’s  minds  as  numerous  as  those  minds.  The  flower,  too, 
expressing  its  meaning  and  thus  fulfilling  its  function,  goes  and  departs.  But  it  goes 
leaving  its  apparent  form  in  the  memory  of  everything  that  sees  it,  its  inner  essence  in 
every seed. It is as  if each  memory and seed were a camera to record the adornment of 
the  flower,  or  a  means  for  its  perpetuation.  If  such  be  the  case  with  an  object  at  the 
simplest level of life, it can be readily understood how closely tied to eternity is man, the 
highest  form  of  life  and  the  possessor  of  an  eternal  soul.  Again,  from  the  fact  that  the 
laws —each resembling a  spirit— according to which  large  flowering and  fruit  bearing 
plants are formed and the representations of their forms are preserved and perpetuated in 
most  regular  fashion  in  tiny  seeds  throughout tempestuous  changes  —  from  this  fact  it 
can be easily understood how closely tied and related to  

                                                                                                                                            
enemies; its size will be in perfect balance with utter wisdom. Thus the wisdom of the state will be joined 
to its splendour, and it can be said that there is no excess in the army. 

 

88

eternity  is  the  spirit  of  man,  which  possesses  an  extremely  exalted  and  comprehensive 
nature,  and  which  although  clothed  in  a  body,  is  a  conscious  and  luminous  law  issuing 
from the divine command. 

•  Sixth  Principle:  You  will  also  understand  that  man  has  not  been  left  to  graze  at 
will, with a halter loosely tied around his neck; on the contrary, the forms of all his deeds 
are recorded and registered, and the results of all his acts are preserved for the day when 
he shall be called to account. 

• Seventh Principle: You will  understand,  further, that the destruction  visited upon 
the  beautiful  creatures  of  summer  and  spring  in  the  autumn  is  not  for  the  sake  of 
annihilation. Instead, it is a form of dismissal after the completion of service.21 It is also a 
form  of  emptying  in  order  to  clear  a  space  for  the  new  creation  that  is  to  come  in  the 
following  spring,  of  preparing  the  ground  and  making  ready  for  the  beings  that  are  to 
come  and  assume  their  functions.  Finally,  it  is  a  form  of  Divine  warning  to  conscious 
beings to awake from the neglect that causes them to forget their duties, from the drunken 
torpor that causes them to forget their obligation of offering thanks. 

•  Eighth  Principle:  You  will  understand  this,  too,  that  the  eternal  Maker  of  this 
transient world has another, everlasting world; it is to this that He urges and impels His 
servants. 

•  Ninth  Principle:  You  will  understand,  also,  that  so  Compassionate  a  Being  will 
bestow upon His choice servants in that world such gifts as no eye has ever seen, no ear 
has ever heard, nor has their image crossed the heart of any man.22 In this we believe. 

SEVENTH TRUTH 
The Gate of Protection and Preservation, 
the Manifestation of the Names of Preserver and Guardian 

Is it at all possible that God’s attribute of Preserver, which protects all things with the 
utmost order and balance, —things in the heavens and on the earth, on dry land and in the 
ocean,  dry  and  wet,  large  and  small,  commonplace  and  exalted—  and  as  it  were,  sifts 
their results by way of accounting  

                                                

21 Yes, it is fitting that the fruits, flowers and leaves on the tips and branches of a tree, proceeding from 

the treasuries of sustenance provided by Divine mercy, should depart when they become old and their 
duties are at an end. Otherwise the gate will remain closed to those that come after them, and a barrier will 
be erected against the expansion of God’s mercy and the services to be performed by their brethren (i.e., 
other members of the species). Moreover, with the passing of youth, they will become wretched and 
distraught. Spring is like a fruit-bearing tree that in turn is an indication of the plain of resurrection. 
Similarly, the world of humanity in every age is like a tree inviting contemplation, and the world as a whole 
is like an amazing tree the fruits of which are despatched to the market of the hereafter. 

22 Bukhari, Bad’u’l-Khalq, 8; Tafsir al-Sura xxxii, 1; Tawhid, 35; Muslim, Iman, 312. 

 

89

—  is  it  at  all  possible  that  this  attribute  should  permit  the  deeds  and  acts  of  man,  man 
who  has  been  given  the  lofty  disposition  of  humanity,  the  rank  of  the  supreme 
vicegerency,  and  the  duty  of  bearing  the  Supreme  Trust,  not  to  be  recorded,  not  to  be 
passed through the sieve of accounting, not to be weighed in the balance of justice, not to 
be  punished  or  rewarded  fittingly,  even  though  his  acts  and  deeds  closely  pertain  to 
God’s universal dominicality? No, it is not in any way possible! 

Yes, the Being that administers this cosmos preserves all things in order and balance. 
Order  and  balance  are  the  manifestation  of  knowledge  and  wisdom,  of  will  and  power. 
For  we  see  that  the  substance  of  every  created  object  is  fashioned  in  well-ordered  and 
symmetrical  fashion.  Not  only  is  each  of  the  forms  it  changes  throughout  its  life  well-
ordered, but the totality of these  forms  is  also  marked by the  same orderliness.  We see, 
too,  that  the  Glorious  Preserver  preserves  many  forms  of  all  things  the  life  of  which 
comes  to  an  end  when  they  have  performed  their  function  and  which  depart  from  the 
manifest world, in the memories of men, that are like a kind of preserved tablet,23 or in a 
form  of  archetypal  mirror.  He  also  writes  and  inscribes  a  brief  history  of  their  life  in  a 
seed,  that  is  like  the  result  and  outcome  of  the  whole.  Thus  He  causes  all  things  to  be 
preserved in mirrors pertaining to both the outer and inner worlds. The memory of man, 
the  fruit  of  the  tree,  the  kernel  of  the  fruit,  the  seed  of  the  flower  —  all  of  these 
demonstrate the universality and comprehensiveness of the law of preservation. 

Do you not see that all the  flowers and  fruits of the  vast spring, the records of their 
deeds in appropriate form, the laws of their formation, and the images of their forms, are 
all inscribed into the finite space of a minute seed and are there preserved? The following 
spring, their record of deeds is set forth, in a form of accounting appropriate to them, and 
another  vast  world  of  spring  is  brought  forth,  with  the  utmost  order  and  wisdom.  This 
demonstrates  with  what  powerful  comprehensiveness  God’s  attribute  of  Preserver 
transient,  commonplace, 
exercises 
impermanent and insignificant things are preserved, is it at all possible that men’s deeds, 
that yield  important fruit  in the world of the unseen, the world of the hereafter, and the 
world of spirits, from the point of view of universal dominicality, is it at all possible that 
they  should  not  be  guarded  and  preserved,  should  not  be  recorded  as  a  matter  of 
importance? No, by no means! 

the  results  of  such 

itself.  Considering 

that 

Yes, from this manifestation of God’s attribute of Preserver it can be deduced that the 
Master of all creation devotes great care to the orderliness of all things that come to pass 
in His realm. He pays great attention to the function of sovereignty, and lavishes extreme 
care  on  the  dominicality  of  kingship.  Thus  He  records,  or  causes  to  be  recorded,  the 
pettiest of happen 

                                                

23 See, the footnote to the Seventh Aspect above.

ings,  the  smallest  of  services,  and  preserves  in  numerous  things  the  form  of  everything 
that happens in His realm. This attribute of Preserver indicates that an important register 
of deeds will  be subjected to a precise examination and weighing: the records of  men’s 
deeds will stand revealed. 

Now  is  it  at  all  possible  that  man  should  be  ennobled  with  the  vicegerency  and  the 
Trust,  that,  as  a  witness  to  the  universality  of  dominicality,  he  should  proclaim  God’s 
unity in the realm of multiplicity, and thus act as a controller and witness by having some 
share in the glorification of God and worship of most beings — is it at all possible that he 
should  do  all  of  this  and  then  go  to  his  grave  and  sleep  peacefully  without  ever  being 
awakened?  Without  ever  being  asked  concerning  his  deeds,  small  and  great?  That  he 
should not go to the plain of resurrection and be tried at the Supreme Tribunal? No, by no 
means! 

Or is it possible for man to flee and hide himself in annihilation, for him to enter the 
earth and conceal himself from that Powerful and Glorious One to Whose Power over all 
contingencies  in  the  future,24  the  occurrences  of  past  time  —each  a  miracle  of  His 
power—  bear  witness,  and  Who  visibly  creates  winter  and  spring,  that,  taken  together, 
resemble resurrection? Since  

                                                

24 The entirety of the past, extending from the present back to the beginning of creation, consists of 
occurrences. Every day, year and century that came into being is like a line, a page, a book, written by the 
pen of destiny; the hand of God’s power has inscribed His miraculous signs there with the utmost wisdom 
and order. 

Similarly, time from the present until resurrection, Paradise and eternity, consists entirely of 
contingencies. The past consists of occurrences, the future of contingencies. Now if these two chains of 
time be compared with each other, it will be seen to be true of a certainty that the Being That created 
yesterday and brought into being the creatures peculiar to it, is capable, too, of creating tomorrow together 
with its creatures. Again, there is no doubt that the beings and wonders of past time, that wondrous display, 
are the miraculous works of a Powerful and Glorious One. They bear decisive witness that that Powerful 
One is capable of creating all of the future and its contingencies, and manifesting all of its wonders. 

The one who creates an apple must of a certainty be able to create all the apples in the world and to 

bring the vast spring into being. Conversely, the one who cannot create a spring cannot create a single 
apple either, for the apple is made at the same workbench. But the one who makes an apple can make the 
spring. Each apple is an example in miniature of a tree, even of a garden or a cosmos. The apple seed that 
carries within itself the life-story of the huge tree is, from the point of view of artistry, such a miracle that 
the one who creates it thus is incapable of nothing. So too, the one that creates today is able also to create 
the day of resurrection, and it is only the one capable of creating the spring that is able, too, to create 
resurrection. The one who affixes all the worlds of past time to the ribbon of time and displays them there 
in utmost wisdom and order, is without doubt capable of attaching other beings to the ribbon of the future 
and displaying them there. In several of the Words, particularly the Twenty-Second Word, we proved with 
utter certainty that: “the one who cannot create everything cannot create anything, and the one who can 
fashion one thing, can fashion everything. Also, if the creation of everything is entrusted to a single being, 
the creation of all things becomes as easy as the creation of a single thing; thus facility arises. If, on the 
contrary, it is entrusted to numerous causes, and ascribed to multiplicity, the creation of a single thing 
becomes as difficult as the creation of everything, and such difficulty arises as borders on impossibility.” 

 

91

man is not called to account and judged in fitting fashion while in this world, it follows 
that he must proceed to a Supreme Tribunal and a final felicity. 

EIGHTH TRUTH 
The Gate of Promise and Threat, 
the Manifestation of the Names of Beautiful and Glorious. 

Is it at all possible that the Maker of this world, the Possessor of Absolute Knowledge 
and  Absolute Power, should  not fulfil the oft-repeated promise and threat that has  been 
proclaimed  unanimously  by  all  the  prophets  and  been  witnessed  in  unison  by  all  the 
veracious and the saints, and thus display weakness and ignorance? God forbid! All that 
is  implied  by  His  promise  and  threat  is  not  at  all  difficult  for  His  power  to  fulfil;  it  is 
extremely  simple  and  easy.  It  is  as  easy  for  Him  as  bringing  back  next  spring  the 
countless beings of last spring, in part identically,25 in part in simile.26 It is our need, the 
need  of  everything,  His  own  need  and  the  need  of  His  dominical  sovereignty,  that  He 
should fulfil His promise. For Him to break His promise would be contrary to the dignity 
of His power, and it would contradict the comprehensiveness of His knowledge. For the 
breaking of a promise can arise only from ignorance or impotence. 

O denier! Do you know how foolish a crime you are committing with your unbelief 
and denial? Paying heed to your own lying fancy, your delirious intellect, your deceptive 
soul,  you  reject  as  a  liar  One  Who  in  no  way  can  be  compelled  to the  breaking  of  His 
promise,  Whose  glory  and  stature  can  in  no  way  admit  the  breaking  of  His  word,  and 
Whose  truthfulness  and  veracity  are  attested  by  all  visible  matters  and  objects!  Despite 
your  infinite  pettiness,  you  are  committing  a  crime  of  infinitely  great  proportions. 
Without doubt you deserve great and eternal punishment. According to certain narrations, 
the  fact that the teeth of some of the people of Hell will  be as  big as a  mountain27 will 
serve as an indication of the magnitude of their crime. O denier,  you are like a traveller 
who closes his eyes to the sunlight and looks instead at the fantasy in his own mind. His 
imagination  wishes  to  illumine  the  awesome  path  in  front  of  him  with  the  light 
proceeding  from  his  mind’s  lamp  that  in  reality  is  no  stronger  than  a  glow-worm. 
Whatever has been promised by God Almighty, Whose veracious words are these beings 
we see and Whose truthful, eloquent signs are the processes of nature, He will of a surety 
fulfil. He will establish a Supreme Tribunal, and bestow an ultimate bliss.

NINTH TRUTH 
The Gate of God’s bestowal of life and death, 
the Manifestation of the Names of Eternally Living 
and Self-Subsistent, and Giver of Life and Giver of Death. 

Is it at all possible that the One Who gives life to this vast dead and dry earth; Who in 
so  doing  demonstrates  His  power  by  deploying  more  than  three  hundred  thousand 
different  forms  of  creation,  each  of  them  as  remarkable  as  man;  Who  further 
demonstrates in this deployment His all-embracing knowledge by the infinite distinctions 
and differentiations He  makes  in the complex  intermingling of all of those  forms;  Who 
directs the gaze of all His slaves to everlasting bliss by promising them resurrection in all 
of His heavenly decrees; Who demonstrates the splendour of His dominicality by causing 
all  of  His  creation  to  collaborate  with  one  another,  to  revolve  within  the  circle  of  His 
command  and  His  will,  to  aid  one  another  and  be  submitted  to  Him;  Who  shows  the 
importance  He  has  given  to  man  by  creating  him  as  the  most  comprehensive,  the  most 
precious  and  delicate,  the  most  valued  and  valuable  fruit  on  the  tree  of  creation  by 
addressing  him  without  intermediary  and  subjugating  all  things  to  him;  —  is  it  at  all 
possible  that  so  Compassionate  and  Powerful  a  One,  so  Wise  and  All-Knowing  a  One, 
should not bring about resurrection; should not gather His creatures together or be unable 
to  do  so;  should  not  restore  man  to  life,  or  be  unable  to  do  so;  should  not  be  able  to 
inaugurate  His  Supreme  Court;  should  not  be  able  to  create  Heaven  and  Hell?  Nay, 
indeed, by no means is any of this possible. 

Indeed, the Almighty Disposer of this world’s affairs creates in every century, every 
year  and  every  day,  on  the  narrow  and  transient  face  of  the  globe,  numerous  signs, 
examples and indications of the Supreme Gathering and the Plain of Resurrection. 

Thus in the gathering that takes place every spring we see that in the course of five or 
six days  more than three  hundred thousand different kinds of animal and plant are  first 
gathered together and then dispersed. The roots of all the trees and plants, as well as some 
animals, are revived and restored exactly as they were. The other animals are recreated in 
a  form  so  similar  as  to  be  almost  identical.  The  seeds  which  appear,  in  their  outward 
form,  to  be  so  close  to  each  other,  nonetheless,  in  the  course  of  six  days  or  six  weeks, 
become  distinct  and  differentiated  from  each  other,  and  then  with  extreme  speed,  ease 
and  facility, are  brought to life  in the utmost order and equilibrium. Is  it at all possible 
that  for  the  One  Who  does  all  of  this  anything  should  be  difficult;  that  He  should  be 
unable  to  create  the  heavens  and  the  earth  in  six  days;  that  He  should  be  unable  to 
resurrect men with a single blast? No, by no means is it possible! 

 

93

Let  us  suppose there  were  to  be  some  gifted  writer  who  could  write  out  in  a  single 
hour  the  confused  and  obliterated  letters  of  three  hundred  thousand  books  on  a  single 
sheet  without  any  error, omission  or  defect,  complete  and  in  the  best  form.  If  someone 
were then to say to you that that writer could write out again from memory a book written 
by him that had fallen into the water and become obliterated, would you then say that he 
is unable, and would you not believe in his ability? Or think of some talented king who, 
in  order  to  demonstrate  his  power  or  for  the  sake  of  providing  a  warning  example, 
removes  whole  mountains  with  a  single  command,  turns  his  realm  upside  down,  and 
transforms the sea into dry land. Then you see that a great rock rolls down into a valley, 
so that the path is blocked for guests travelling to attend the king’s reception and they are 
unable to pass. If someone should say to you: “that exalted one will remove or dissolve 
the stone, however great it may be, with a single command; he will not leave his guests 
stranded,” would you then say that he will not remove the stone, or be unable to do so? 
Or  if someone one day  should gather together a great army,  and  you are then  informed 
that  he  will  summon  its  battalions  together  with  a  blast  of  the  trumpet  after  they  had 
dispersed to rest, and the battalions will form up in disciplined shape, would you respond 
by saying, “I don’t believe it?” Were you to say any of these things your behaviour would 
truly be madness. 

If  you  have understood these three parables,  now  look further and see  how the Pre-
Eternal Designer turns over in  front of our eyes the white page of winter and opens the 
green pages of spring and summer. Then He inscribes on the page of the earth’s surface, 
with the pen of power and destiny, in the most beautiful form, more than three hundred 
thousand  species  of  creation.  Not  one  encroaches  upon  another.  He  writes  them  all 
together, but none blocks the path of another. In their formation and shape, each is kept 
separate from the other without any confusion. There is no error in the writing. That Wise 
and  Preserving  One,  Who  preserves  and  inserts the  spirit  of  a  great tree  in  the  smallest 
seed, no bigger than a dot — is it permissible even to ask how He preserves the spirits of 
those  who  die?  That  Powerful  One  Who  causes  the  globe  to  revolve  like  a  pebble  in  a 
sling — is it permissible even to ask how He will remove this globe from the path of His 
guests who are travelling to meet Him in the Hereafter? 

Again, the One of Glorious Essence Who from non-being recruits anew and inscribes 
into  His  battalions,  with  the  command  of  “Be,  and  behold  it  is,”  and  with  utmost 
discipline, the troops of all living things, the very particles of all of their bodies, and thus 
creates  highly  disciplined  armies  —  is  it  permissible  even  to  ask  how  He  can  make 
bodies  submit  to  His  discipline  like  a  battalion,  how  He  can  gather  together  their 
mutually acquainted fundamental particles, and their component members? 

 

94

You can, moreover, behold with your own eyes, the numerous designs made by God 
as signs, similes and indications of resurrection, designs placed by Him in every age and 
epoch  of  the  world,  in  the  alternation  of  day  and  night,  even  in  the  appearance  and 
disappearance  of  clouds  in  the  sky.  If  you  imagine  yourself  to  have  been  living  a 
thousand years ago, and then compare with each other the two wings of time that are the 
past  and  the  future,  then  you  will  behold  similes  of  the  gathering  and  indications  of 
resurrection  as  numerous  as  the  centuries  and  days.  If,  then,  after  witnessing  so  many 
similes  and  indications,  you  regard  corporeal  resurrection  as  improbable  and  rationally 
unacceptable, know your behaviour to be pure lunacy. 

See what the Supreme Decree says concerning the truth we are discussing: 

Look upon the signs of God’s mercy, and see how He restores life to the earth 
after  its  death.  Verily  He  it  is  Who  shall  bring  to  life  the  dead,  and  He  is 
powerful over all things.28 

In  short:  There  is  nothing  that  makes  impossible  the  gathering  of  resurrection,  and 
much  that  necessitates  it.  The  glorious  and  eternal  dominicality,  the  almighty  and  all 
embracing  sovereignty  of  the  One  Who  gives  life  and  death  to this  vast  and  wondrous 
earth  as  if  it  were  a  mere  animal;  Who  has  made  of  this  earth  a  pleasing  cradle,  a  fine 
ship, for man and the animals; Who has made of the sun a lamp furnishing light and heat 
to the hostelry of the world; Who has made of the planets vehicles for the conveyance of 
His  angels  —  the  dominicality  and  sovereignty  of  such  a  One  cannot  rest  upon  and  be 
restricted  to  the  transitory,  impermanent,  unstable,  insignificant,  changeable,  unlasting, 
deficient and imperfect affairs of this world. He must, therefore, have another realm, one 
worthy of Him, permanent, stable, immutable and glorious. Indeed, He does have another 
kingdom,  and  it  is  for  the  sake  of  this  that  He  causes  us  to  labour,  and  to this  that  He 
summons us. All those of illumined spirit who have penetrated from outer appearances to 
truth,  and  have  been  ennobled  with  proximity  to  the  Divine  Presence,  all  the  spiritual 
poles  endowed  with  luminous  hearts,  all  the  possessors  of  lucent  intelligence,  all  bear 
witness that He will transfer us to that other kingdom. They inform us unanimously that 
He has prepared for us there reward and requital, and relate that He is repeatedly giving 
us firm promises and stern warnings. 

As for the breaking of a promise, it is baseless and utter humiliation. It cannot in any 
way be reconciled with the glory of His sanctity. Similarly, failure to fulfil a threat arises 
either from forgiveness or powerlessness.  

                                                

28 Qur’an, 30:50.

Now  unbelief  is  extreme  crime,  and  cannot  be  forgiven.29  The  Absolutely  Omnipotent 
One  is  exempt  of  and  exalted  above  all  powerlessness.  Those  who  bring  us  their 
testimony  and  report,  despite  all  the  differences  in  their  methods,  temperaments  and 
paths, are totally unanimous and agreed on this basic matter. By their number, they have 
the authority of unanimity. By their quality, they have the authority of learned consensus. 
By their rank, each one  is a guiding star of  mankind, the  cherished eye of a people, the 
object  of  a  nation’s  veneration.  By  their  importance,  each  one  is  an  expert  and  an 
authority  in  the  matter.  In  any  art or  science,  two  experts  are  preferred  to thousands  of 
non-experts,  and  two  positive  affirmers  are  preferred  to  thousands  of  negators  in  the 
transmission of a report. For example, the testimony of two men affirming the sighting of 
the crescent moon at the beginning of Ramadan totally nullifies the negation of thousands 
of deniers. 

In  short:  In  the  whole  world  there  is  no  truer  report,  no  firmer  claim,  no  more 
apparent  truth  than  this.  The  world  is  without  doubt  a  field,  and  the  resurrection  a 
threshing-floor, a harvest. Paradise and Hell are each storehouses for the grain. 

TENTH TRUTH 
The Gate of Wisdom, Grace, Mercy and Justice; 
the Manifestation of the Names of All-Wise, 
Generous, Just and Merciful. 

Is  it at all possible that the Glorious Possessor of all Dominion  in this  impermanent 
hospice of the world, in this transient place of testing,  in this unstable showplace of the 
earth  so  manifest  a  wisdom,  so  evident  a  grace,  so  overwhelming  a  justice,  so 
comprehensive a mercy, — is it at all possible that in His realm, in the worlds of the outer 
and  inner  dimensions  of  things,  there  should  not  exist  permanent  abodes  with  eternal 
inhabitants, everlasting stations with immortal residents, and that as a result all the truths 
of wisdom, grace, mercy and justice that we now see should decline into nothingness. 

                                                

29 Unbelief denounces creation for alleged worthlessness and meaninglessness. It is an insult to all of 
creation, a denial of the manifestation of the Divine Names in the mirror of beings. It is disrespect to all the 
Divine Names, and rejection of the witness borne to the Divine Unity by all beings. It is a denial of all 
creation. It corrupts man’s potentialities in such a way that they are incapable of reform and unreceptive to 
good. Unbelief is also an act of utter injustice, a transgression against all of creation and the rights of God’s 
Names. The preservation of those rights, as well as the unredeemable nature of the unbeliever’s soul, make 
it necessary that unbelief should be unpardonable. The words, “to assign partners to God is verily a great 
transgression,” (Qur’an, 31:13) express this meaning. 

 

96

Again, is it at all possible that that All-Wise Being should choose man, among all His 
creation,  to  receive  direct  and  universal  address  from  Him,  should  make  him  a 
comprehensive  mirror  to  Himself,  should  permit  him  to  taste,  weigh,  and  become 
acquainted with, all the contents of His treasuries of mercy, should make Himself known 
to him with all His Names, should love him and make Himself beloved of him — that He 
should do all this and then fail to despatch wretched man to that eternal realm, to invite 
him to that abode of permanent bliss and make him happy there? 

Is it at all reasonable that He should impose on every being, even the seed, a task as 
heavy  as  a  tree,  mount  in  it  instances  of  His  wisdom  as  numerous  as  the  flowers,  and 
beneficial aspects as numerous as the fruits, but assign to that task, to those instances of 
His wisdom and those beneficial aspects, a purpose pertaining only to this world, one as 
small  as  a  seed?  That  He  should  make  that  purpose  nothing  more  than  the  life  of  this 
world, something less valuable than a grain of mustard-seed? That He should not make of 
beings seeds for the world of meaning and tillage for the realm of the hereafter, for them 
to  yield  there  their  true  and  worthy  results?  That  He  should  permit  such  significant 
alternations  to  remain  without  purpose, to  be  empty  and  vain?  That  He  should  not turn 
their faces towards the world of meaning and the hereafter, so that they might there reveal 
their true purposes and fitting results? 

Again,  is  it at all possible that by thus causing things to controvert their own nature 
He  should  present  His  own  veracious  Names,  All-Wise,  Generous,  Just,  Merciful,  as 
being  characterized  by  their  opposites  —God  forbid!—  that  He  should  deny  the  true 
essences  of  all  those  beings  that  indicate  His  wisdom  and  generosity,  His  justice  and 
mercy,  that  He  should  reject  the  testimony  of  all  creatures,  that  He  should  negate  the 
indications made by all things? 

Can intelligence at all accept that God should impose on man and his senses duties as 
numerous  as  the  hair  on  his  head,  but  give  him  no  more  than  an  earthly  reward, 
something no more valuable than a hair? That He should act meaninglessly, in a fashion 
contrary to His true justice and opposed to His true wisdom? 

Again, is it at all possible that God Who proves and shows Himself to be a possessor 
of absolute wisdom, by attaching to every animate being, or even to every  member  like 
the tongue, indeed to every creature, instances of His wisdom and sources of  benefit as 
numerous as the results and the fruits He has attached to a tree — is it at all possible that 
He should fail to bestow of Himself the greatest of all instances of His wisdom, the most 
significant of all  sources of  benefit, the  most necessary of all results, that which  makes 
His wisdom into wisdom, His blessings into blessings, His mercy into mercy, the  

 

97

source  and  aim  of  all  of  His  wisdom,  bounty,  mercy  and  beneficence  —  eternity,  the 
meeting with Him in the hereafter and everlasting bliss? Were He to abandon these, He 
would plunge all of His doings unto utter pointlessness and cause Himself to resemble a 
being who constructed a palace, each stone of which contained thousands of designs, in 
each  corner  of  which  thousands  of  adornments  were  to  be  found,  and  in  each  part  of 
which thousands of precious household instruments and tools were provided, but failed to 
build  a  roof  over  it,  so  that  everything  rotted  and  was  needlessly  destroyed.  No,  by  no 
means  can  this  be  true!  From  absolute  goodness  comes  forth  goodness,  and  from  the 
Possessor of Absolute Beauty comes forth beauty. So too nothing devoid of purpose can 
emerge from the Possessor of Absolute Wisdom. 

Whoever in his imagination embarks on the ship of history and sets sail for the past, 
will see dead  stages, places, gatherings and worlds, as  numerous as the  years, and  each 
like the stopping-place that is the world, the field of trial, the gathering of creation, that 
we  now  see.  In  form  and  quality  they  are  different  from  each  other,  but they  resemble 
each other with respect to their orderliness, their wondrousness and the fashion in which 
they display the power and wisdom of the Maker. 

In 

those 

those 

transient  fields, 

impermanent  stopping-places, 

those  fleeting 
gatherings, he will also see the orderly workings of so manifest a wisdom, the indications 
of  so  evident  a  beneficence,  the  signs  of  so  imperious  a  justice,  the  fruits  of  so 
comprehensive  a  mercy,  that  he  will  know  of  a  certainty  —unless  totally  devoid  of 
perception— that a more perfect wisdom that that which he beholds is inconceivable, that 
a beneficence more beauteous than that the signs of which he observes is impossible, that 
a  justice  more  glorious  than  that  the  indications  of  which  he  sees  cannot  exist,  and  a 
mercy more comprehensive than that the fruits of which he sees is unimaginable. 

If,  to  suppose  the  impossible,  there  were  no  permanent  abodes,  lofty  mansions, 
everlasting  stations  and  eternal  abodes,  with  their  eternal  residents,  God’s  joyous 
servants,  in  the  realm  of  that  Eternal  Monarch  Who  disposes  all  affairs  and  Who 
constantly  is  changing  the  hospice  and  its  inmates, then  it  would  be  necessary  to  reject 
the  true  essences  of  wisdom,  justice,  beneficence  and  compassion,  those  four  powerful 
and universal spiritual elements that are like light, air, water and earth, and to deny their 
existence, even though they are as apparent as that of the external elements. For it is plain 
that this impermanent world and its contents cannot be a complete manifestation of their 
true essences. If there  is  no other place, somewhere else, where they can  be  manifested 
fully,  it  then  becomes  necessary,  with  a  lunacy  like  that  of  the  man  who  denies  the 
existence of the sun even though  

 

98

he sees its light filling the day, to deny the wisdom that we can see in everything in front 
of our eyes; to deny the  beneficence that we can  observe  in our own souls and  in  most 
other things; to deny the justice the signs of which appear so strongly;30 and to deny the 
compassion we see everywhere in operation. It follows in turn that we must regard as a 
foolish  prankster,  a  treacherous  tyrant,  the  one  from  whom  proceed  all  the  wise 
processes,  the  generous  deeds  and  the  merciful  gifts  we  perceive  in  the  universe.  God 
forbid  that  this  should  be  so;  it  is  a  totally  impossible  reversal  of  the  truth.  Even  the 
foolish  sophists,  who  denied  the  existence  of  everything  and  even  that  of  their  own 
selves, would not readily contemplate such a proposition. 

In short: Considering the utter disparity  between  —on the one  hand— this state of 
affairs which we see together with the universal fusions of life and the swift separations 
of death, the imposing gatherings and the rapid dispersions, the  magnificent revolutions 
and  the  great  manifestations,  and  —on  the  other  hand—  the  petty  fruits  we  see  briefly 
attained  in  this  transient  world,  the  temporary  and  insignificant  purposes  of  beings  that 
pertain  to  this  world,  we  conclude  that  the  non-existence  of  the  hereafter  would  mean 
attaching to a little stone wise purposes as great as a mountain, and to a great mountain, a 
purpose as petty as a small stone. No intelligence or wisdom can find this acceptable. 

In other words, this  lack of proportion  between  beings and these  matters on the one 
hand, and their purposes pertaining to this world on the other, demonstrates with certainty 
that all  beings have their  faces turned to the world of  meaning. It is there that they will 
yield their appropriate fruits, and their eyes are fixed on the Sacred Names. Their ultimate 
aims pertain to that world alone. While their substance is hidden beneath the soil of this 
world,  their  flowers  will  unfold  in  the  World  of  Similitudes.  Man  sows  and  is  sown  in 
this world, in accordance with his capacity; the harvest is gathered in the hereafter. If you 
look at the aspect of things that is turned towards the Divine Names and the hereafter you 
will see that each seed, a miracle of  

                                                

30 There are two varieties of justice, one affirmative, the other negative. The positive variety consists in 
giving the deserving his right. This form of justice exists throughout the world in the most obvious fashion, 
because, as proven in the Third Truth, it observably bestows, in accordance with special balances and 
particular criteria, all the objects of desire requested by everything from its Glorious Creator with the 
tongue of innate capacity, the language of natural need, the speech of necessity, and all the requirements of 
life and existence. This variety of justice is, then, as certain as life and existence itself.The other variety of 
justice, the negative, consists in chastising the unjust; it gives wrongdoers their due by way of requital and 
punishment. This type of justice is not fully manifest in this world, even though there are countless signs 
and indications that permit us to sense its true nature. For example, all the chastising blows and punitive 
lashes that have descended on all rebellious peoples, from the ‘Ad and Thamud to those of the present age, 
show definitely that an exalted justice dominates the world. 

 

99

power, has an aim as vast as a tree. Each flower, which is like a word of Divine wisdom, 
has  meanings  as  numerous  as  the  flowers  on  a  tree,  and  each  fruit,  a  wonder  of  God’s 
workmanship and a poem dictated by His mercy, has wise purposes as numerous as the 
fruits  of  a  tree.  As  for  the  fruit  serving  us  as  sustenance,  it  is  merely  one  out  of  those 
many  thousand  wise  purposes;  it  fulfils  its  purpose,  expresses  its  meanings,  and  dies, 
being buried in our stomach.31 Since these transient beings yield eternal fruits in another 
place,  leave  there  permanent  forms  of  themselves,  and  express  there  everlasting 
meanings;  since  they  engage  in  ceaseless  glorification  of  the  Maker;  and  since  man 
becomes man by perceiving these aspects of things that are oriented to the hereafter, thus 
finding his way to eternity by means of the transient — since all of this is true, there must 
be  some  other  purpose  for  all  these  beings  that  are  cast  around  between  life  and  death, 
that are first gathered and then dispersed. 

There  is no error in this comparison: the above-mentioned state of affairs resembles 
circumstances  formed  and  arranged  by  way  of  imitation  and  representation.  Brief 
gatherings  and  dispersions  are  arranged  at  great  expense  merely  for  the  sake  of  taking 
pictures  that  can  thereafter  be  shown  in  the  cinema.  So  too,  one  of  the  reasons  for  our 
passage through individual and social life in this life, for a brief time, is to enable pictures 
to  be  taken  and  images  formed,  to  enable  the  result  of  our  deeds  to  be  registered  and 
recorded, for display on a day of accounting, for being shown at a vast gathering, and to 
yield the fruit of supreme happiness. The noble saying of the Prophet (Peace and blessing 
be upon him) “This world is the tillage for the hereafter,”32 indicates this meaning. 

Since the world exists, and within this world wisdom,  beneficence, compassion and 
justice also exist, with their numerous evidences, of a certainty the hereafter also exists, 
just as surely as does this world. Since one aspect of everything in this world is turned to 
that world and  is proceeding toward it, to deny that world would  be denying this world 
with all it contains. Just as the allotted hour and the grave await man, so too do Paradise 
and Hell, anxiously watching for his arrival. 

                                                

31 If it be asked, “why do your parables consist chiefly of flowers, seeds and fruits,” our answer is that 

they are the most wondrous, remarkable and delicate of the miracles of God’s power. Moreover, since 
naturalists, philosophers and the people of misguidance have been unable to read the subtle script written 
upon them by the pen of destiny and power, they have choked on them, and fallen into the swamp of 
nature.

ELEVENTH TRUTH 
The Gate of Humanity, and 
the Manifestation of the Name of Truth 

Is it at all possible that God Almighty, He Who is worshipped by right, should create 
man  within  creation  as  the  most  significant  of  all  of  His  servants  with  respect  to  His 
absolute dominicality and with respect to His universal dominicality in all of His realms; 
that He should make him the most thoughtful recipient of His glorious address, the most 
comprehensive  mirror to the  manifestation  of  His  Names;  that  He  should  create  him  as 
the  most  beautiful  miracle  of  His  power  in  the  fairest  of  forms,  in  order  to  receive  the 
manifestation of the Greatest Name, as well as that quality of the Greatest Name inherent 
in the other Names, in order for him to assess and perceive the contents of His treasuries 
of  mercy;  that  He  should  make  him  an  investigator  of  secrets  equipped  more  than  any 
other creature with balances and instruments; and He should make him the most needy of 
all  creatures  with  respect  to  His  infinite  gifts,  the  one  suffering  most  from  annihilation 
and the one most desirous of immortality; that He should make him the most delicate, the 
poorest and neediest of animals, most wretched and subject to pain in his worldly life but 
most sublime in disposition, in the highest of forms and characters — is it possible that 
God  Almighty  should  do  all  this  with  man  and  not  send  him  to  the  Eternal  Realm  for 
which  he  is  suited and  fitted and  for which  he  is  longing? Is  it possible that He  should 
thus negate the whole essence of  humanity, act  in a manner totally contrary to His own 
veracity, and perform an act of injustice that the eye of truth must deem ugly? 

Again, is it at all possible that He Who rules justly, Whose mercy is absolute, should 
bestow  on  man  such  a  disposition  that  he  took  up  the  Supreme  Trust,  from  which  the 
heavens  and  mountains  both  shrank,  in  order to measure  and  know,  with  his  slight  and 
petty  measures  and  crafts,  the  all  encompassing  attributes,  the  universal  workings,  and 
the infinite manifestations of the Creator; that He should create him as the most delicate, 
vulnerable, weak and powerless of beings, while yet entrusting him with the regulation of 
all the vegetal and animal life upon earth, and causing him to intervene in their modes of 
worship  and  glorification  of  God;  that  He  should  cause  him  to  be  a  representation  in 
miniature  of  His  cosmic  processes;  that  He  should  cause  him  to  proclaim  His  glorious 
dominicality to all beings, in word and deed; that He should prefer him to the angels and 
give him the rank of vicegerent — is it at all possible that God should bestow all of this 
on man and not give him eternal bliss, the purpose, result and fruit of all of these duties? 
That  He  should  cast  him  down  to  low  degree,  as  the  most  wretched,  ill-fortuned, 
humiliated  and  suffering  of  all  His  creatures;  or that  He  should  make  of  intelligence,  a 
gift  from  His  own  wisdom  and  a  most  blessed  and  luminous  tool  for  the  attainment  of 
happiness, an inauspicious and sombre tool of torment  

 

101 

for  that  wretch,  thus  acting  in  total  contradiction  to  His  absolute  wisdom  and  in 
opposition to His absolute mercy? No, it is by no means possible! 

In  short:  Just  as  we  saw  by  looking  at  the  identity  papers  of  an  officer  in  our 
comparison that his rank, duty, wage, instructions and equipment prove that he exists not 
for  the  sake  of  some  temporary  battlefield,  but  rather  that  he  is  proceeding  to  some 
permanent kingdom, for the sake of which he is exerting himself — so too those to whom 
truth  and  certainty  have  been  unveiled  are  unanimously  agreed  that  the  subtleties 
inscribed  in  the  book  of  man’s  heart,  the  senses  written  down  in  the  notebook  of  his 
intellect, the equipment contained in his essential character, are all turned towards Eternal 
Bliss; they have been given to man and fashioned in accordance with this ultimate goal. 

For  example,  if  one  servant  and  illustrator  of  the  intellect  called  “the  imaginative 
power,” is told that “you can have a million years of life and rule over the world, but in 
the end  you shall  become  nothing,”  it will react with sorrow instead of pleasure, unless 
deceived by  vain  fancy and the  interference of the soul. The greatest of transient things 
cannot, then, satisfy the smallest faculty of man. 

It is, then, this disposition of man —his desires extending to eternity, his thoughts that 
embrace  all  of  creation  and  his  wishes  that  embrace  the  different  varieties  of  eternal 
bliss—  that  demonstrates  he  has  been  created  for  eternity  and  will  indeed  proceed  to 
eternity. This world is like a hospice for him, a waiting-room for the hereafter. 

TWELFTH TRUTH 
The Gate of Messengerhood and Revelation, 
and the Manifestation of 
“In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.” 

Is it at all possible that errant doubts, no stronger than the wing of a fly, could close 
the path to the hereafter and the gate to Paradise that have been definitively opened by the 
Most Noble Messenger (Peace and blessings be upon him), with all of his might, relying 
upon  the  power  of  his  thousand  certified  miracles  as  well  as  the  thousands  of  decisive 
verses  of  the  All-Wise  Qur’an,  a  book  miraculous  in  forty  different  ways  —  that 
Messenger whose words are affirmed by all of the other prophets, relying upon their own 
miracles,  whose  claim  is  affirmed  by  all  of  the  saints,  relying  upon  their  visionary  and 
charismatic experiences, and to whose veracity all of the purified scholars bear witness, 
relying upon their investigations of truth? 

*  *  * 

 

102 

From the previous truths it has become apparent that resurrection is so firmly rooted a 
truth that not even a power capable of lifting up the globe, breaking it and casting it aside, 
could  shake  it.  For  God  Almighty  Himself  affirms  this  truth  in  accordance  with  the 
meaning of all His Names and attributes; His Noble Messenger confirms it with all of his 
miracles  and  evidences;  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  establishes  it  with  all  of  its  truths  and 
verses; and the  cosmos  itself  bears witness to  it with all the creational  signs  it contains 
and all the wise processes that take place within it. Is it at all possible that the Necessary 
Being  should  unite  with  all  of  His  creation  (excepting  only  the  unbelievers)  on  this 
question  of  resurrection,  and  doubts  feebler  than  a  whisker  and  satanic  insinuations 
should  shake  and  uproot  that  exalted  and  firmly-rooted  truth  which  resembles  a 
mountain? No, by no means! 

Beware,  do  not  imagine  that  the  proofs  of  resurrection  are  restricted  to  the  Twelve 
Truths  we  have  mentioned.  The  All-Wise  Qur’an  alone,  that  instructed  us  in  these 
Twelve  Truths,  indicates  thousands  of  other  aspects  of  the  matter  as  well,  each  aspect 
being a sign that our Creator will transfer us from this transient realm to an eternal one. 

Again, do not imagine that the Divine Names which logically require the existence of 
resurrection  are  only  those  we  have  discussed  —  Wise,  Generous,  Merciful,  Just, 
Preserver. On the contrary, all the Divine Names manifest in the ordering of the cosmos 
logically require the existence of resurrection, indeed make it imperative. 

Do not imagine, either, that the creational signs indicating resurrection are confined to 
those  we  have  mentioned  above.  On  the  contrary,  in  the  majority  of  beings,  there  exist 
different aspects and qualities that are like curtains opening to the right and the left: one 
aspect  bears  witness  to  the  Maker,  and  the  other  aspect  indicates  resurrection.  For 
example,  the  beauty  of  man’s  being,  fashioned  as  he  is  in  the  fairest  of  forms, 
demonstrates  the  existence  of  the  Maker,  while  at  the  same  time  the  fact  that  together 
with  his  comprehensive  abilities,  lodged  in  that  fairest  of  forms,  he  soon  declines  and 
dies,  demonstrates  the  existence  of  resurrection.  Sometimes,  if  one  looks  at  the  same 
aspect  in  two  different  ways,  one  sees  that  it  demonstrates  the  existence  both  of  the 
Maker  and  of  resurrection.  For  example,  if  one  looks  at  the  wise  ordering,  the  just 
balance, the gracious adornment and the merciful favour inherent in most things, they are 
seen to demonstrate that they proceed from the powerful hand of a Wise, Generous, Just 
and Merciful Maker. So too, if one looks at the brief and insignificant life of the transient 
beings  that  are  the  manifestations  of  these  qualities,  despite  their  power  and  infinitude, 
the hereafter appears before one. In other words, all things silently recite and cause others 
to recite “I believe in God and the Last Day.” 

 

103 

Conclusion 

The  preceding  Twelve  Truths  confirm,  supplement  and  support  each  other.  Coming 
together in union, they demonstrate the required result. Does it lie in the capacity of any 
doubt to penetrate those twelve firm walls, each like steel or diamonds, in order to shake 
the belief in resurrection housed within their closed citadel? 

The  verse,  Your  creation  and  resurrection  is  but  like  a  single  soul,33  indicates  the 
following meaning: “The creation and resurrection of all men is as easy for God’s power 
as the creation and resurrection of a single man.” Yes indeed. In a treatise entitled Nokta 
(Point), I explained in detail the truth expressed by this verse. Here we will indicate only 
a summary by means of a few comparisons. If you want more detail, then refer to Nokta. 
For  example,  And  God’s  is  the  highest  similitude,34  and  there  is  no  error  in  the 
comparison, if the manifestation of the sun were in accordance with its own will, it could 
be said that the sun bestows its mystery of manifestation on numerous transparent objects 
with the same ease as on a single particle. 

In  accordance  with  the  mystery  of  transparency,  the  little  pupil  of  a  transparent 

particle is equal to the vast face of the ocean in receiving the reflection of the sun. 

In accordance with the mystery of order, it overturns a huge battleship with the same 

ease as a child turning over his toy boat with his finger. 

In accordance with the mystery of obedience, it causes a vast army to move with the 

same word that a commander uses to make a single infantryman move. 

In accordance with the mystery of equilibrium, let us imagine there to exist in space a 
balance so sensitive and at the same time so large that were two walnuts to be placed in 
its  pans  it  would  feel  them,  and  be  equally  able  to  hold  and  to  weigh  two  suns.  If  two 
suns of equal weight were placed in the pans of the scale; the same power, which causes 
one of the walnuts to be lifted up to the heavens and the other walnut to descend to the 
ground,  will  move  these  heavenly  bodies  with  the  same  ease.  Since  in  this  lowly, 
deficient and transient world of contingency, the greatest and smallest things are

34 Qur’an, 16:60.

equal, and numerous, infinite things appear equal to a single thing, through the mystery 
of  luminosity,  transparency,  order, obedience  and  balance,  then  of  a  certainty  little  and 
much, small and great, will be equal in the sight of the possessor of absolute power, and 
He will be able to summon all men to resurrection with a single blast on the trumpet, just 
as if they were one man — this, by virtue of the mysteries of the luminous manifestations 
of  the  infinite  and  utterly  perfect  power  of  His  essence,  the  transparency  of  the  inner 
dimension of things, the order decreed by wisdom and destiny, the complete obedience of 
all things to His creational commands, and the equilibrium existing in contingent being, 
that consists of the equivalence of the being and non-being of the contingent. 

Furthermore,  the  degrees  of  strength  and  weakness  that  a  thing  possesses  are 
determined by the intervention in that thing of its opposite. For example, degrees of heat 
are  determined  by  the  intervention  of  cold;  degrees  of  beauty,  by  the  intervention  of 
ugliness; stages of light, by the intervention of darkness. But if something exists of itself, 
and  is  not  accidental,  then  its  opposite  cannot  interfere  with  it,  for  then  a  union  of 
opposites would logically have to occur, and that is impossible. In something that exists 
of  itself,  there  can  then  be  no  gradation.  Now  the  power  of  the  Possessor  of  Absolute 
Power  pertains  to  His  essence;  it  enjoys  absolute  perfection  and  is  not  accidental  like 
contingent being. It is therefore impossible that its opposite, impotence, should intervene 
in it. Hence it is as easy for the Lord of Glory to create a spring as it is to create a flower. 
But if creation were ascribed to causality, then the creation of a single flower would be as 
difficult as that of a whole spring. For God it is as easy to resurrect and gather all men as 
it is to resurrect and gather one man. 

All  that  we  have  expounded  so  far  with  regard  to  resurrection,  the  comparisons 
indicating it and its truths, is derived from the effulgence of the All-Wise Qur’an. Its sole 
purpose has  been  bringing the soul to surrender and the  heart to acceptance. It is to the 
Qur’an that the right to speak belongs. It is true speech, and all speech is subordinate to it. 
Let us listen, then, to the Qur’an: 

Say: “With God is the argument that reaches home: if it had been His will, He 
could indeed have guided you all.”35 

Look upon the signs of God’s mercy, and see how He restores life to the earth 
after  its  death.  Verily  He  it  is  Who  shall  bring  to  life  the  dead,  and  He  is 
powerful over all things.36 

And he makes comparisons for Us, and forgets his own [Origin and]  

                                                

35 Qur’an, 6:149. 
36 Qur’an, 30:50. 

 

105 

Creation: he says, “Who can give life to [dry] bones and decomposed ones [at 
that]?”37 

O  mankind!  Fear  your  Lord!  For  the  convulsion  of  the  Hour  [of  Judgement] 
will be a thing terrible! 
The Day ye shall see it, every mother giving suck shall forget her suckling-babe, 
and  every  pregnant  female  shall  drop  her  load  [unformed]:  thou  shalt  see 
mankind as in a drunken riot, yet not drunk: but dreadful will be the Wrath of 
God.38 

God! There is no god but He: of a surety He  will gather you together against 
the Day of Judgement, about which there is no doubt. And whose  word can be 
truer than God’s?39 

As for the righteous, they will be in bliss; 
And the wicked — they will be in the fire.40 

When the Earth is shaken to her [utmost] convulsion, 
And the Earth throws up her burdens [from within], 
And man cries [distressed]: “What is the matter with her!” — 
On that Day will she declare her tidings: 
For that thy Lord will have given her inspiration. 
On that Day will men proceed in companies sorted out, to be shown the deeds 
that they [had done]. 
Then shall anyone who has done an atom’s weight of good, see it. 
And anyone who has done an atom’s weight of evil, shall see it.41 

The [Day] of Noise and Clamour: 
What is the [Day] of Noise and Clamour? 
And what will explain to thee what the [Day] of Noise and Clamour is? 
[It is] a Day whereon men will be like moths scattered about, 
And the mountains will be like carded wool. 
Then, he whose balance [of good deeds] will be [found] heavy, 
Will be in a life of good pleasure and satisfaction. 
But he whose balance [of good deeds] will be [found] light,— 
Will have his home in a [bottomless] Pit. 
And what will explain to thee what this is? 
[It is] a Fire blazing fiercely!42 

To God belongs the mystery of the heavens and the earth. And the

decision of the Hour is as the twinkling of an eye or even quicker: for God has 
power over all things.43 

Listening  to these  and  other  clear  verses  of  the  Qur’an,  let  us  say,  “yes,  we  believe 

and give our assent.” 

I believe in God, His angels, His books, His messengers and in the Last Day. I 
believe  that  both  the  good  and  evil  of  destiny  are  from  God  Almighty;  that 
resurrection after death is a reality; that Paradise is a reality; that Hell-fire is a 
reality;  that  intercession  is  a  reality;  that  Munkar  and  Nakir  are  reality;  and 
that God will resurrect those who are in the tombs. I bear witness that there is 
no god but God, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of God. 

O  God,  grant  blessings  to  the  most  delicate,  the  most  noble,  the  most  perfect, 
the  most  beautiful  fruit  of  the  Tuba  of  Your  mercy,  him  whom  You  sent  as  a 
mercy  to  all  the  worlds,  and  as  a  means  for  our  attaining  unto  the  most 
beauteous,  the  fairest,  purest  and  most  exalted  of  the  fruits  of  that  Tuba,  the 
branches  of  which  are  outspread  over  the  hereafter  and  paradise;  o  God, 
protect  us  and  our  parents  against  the  fire,  and  cause  us  and  our  parents  to 
enter Paradise with the pious, for the sake of Thy chosen Prophet.  Amen. 

O  brother  studying  this  treatise  with  an  open  mind!  Do  not  say,  “why  cannot  I 
immediately understand this ‘Tenth Word’ in all its details?” and do not be saddened by 
your  failure  to  understand  it  completely.  For  even  a  master  of  philosophy  such  as  Ibn 
Sina said that “resurrection cannot be understood by rational criteria.” His judgement was 
that we  must  believe  in resurrection,  but reason  cannot aid our belief. Similarly, all the 
scholars  of  Islam  unanimously  have  held  that  resurrection  rests  entirely  on  traditional 
proofs; it cannot be rationally examined. Naturally, so profound, and at the same time, so 
exalted a path cannot suddenly become a public highway for the exercise of the reason. 
But  we  would  offer  a  thousand  thanks  that  the  Merciful  Creator  has  bestowed  upon  us 
this  much of the path, by  means of the effulgence of the All-Wise Qur’an and His own 
mercy, in an age when belief by imitation is past and meek acceptance has disappeared. 
For the amount vouchsafed to each of us is enough for the salvation of our faith. Being 
content  with  the  amount  that  we  have  been  able  to  understand,  we  should  reread  the 
treatise and seek to increase our comprehension.  

One  of  the  reasons  that  it  is  impossible  to  approach  a  rational  understanding  of 

resurrection is that since the supreme gathering, resurrection, is  

                                                

43 Qur’an, 16:77. 

 

107 

through  the  manifestation  of  the  Greatest  Name,  only  through  beholding  and 
demonstrating  the  great  deeds  evident  in  the  maximum  manifestation  of  the  Greatest 
Name  of  God  as  well  as  His  other  Names,  is  it  possible  to  prove  it  as  certain;  and 
unshakeably believe that resurrection is as simple as the spring. Thus do matters appear 
and thus they are demonstrated in this ‘Tenth Word’ (Resurrection and the Hereafter), by 
means  of  the  effulgence  of  the  Qur’an.  Were  it  not  for  this  effulgence,  and  were  our 
intelligence to be left to its own petty devices, it would be powerless, and condemned to 
believing in resurrection by way of imitation.

The First Part of an Important Supplement 
and Addendum to the Tenth Word 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 

So  [give]  glory  to  God,  when  you  reach  eventide  and  when  you  rise  in  the 
morning;  Yea,  to  Him  be  praise,  in  the  heavens  and  on  earth;  and  in  the  late 
afternoon and when the day begins to decline. 

It is He Who brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from 
the living, and Who Gives life to the earth after it is dead: and thus shall you be 
brought out [from the dead]. 

Among His Signs is this, that He created you from dust; and then,— behold, you 
are men scattered [far and wide]! 

And  among  His  Signs  is  this,  that  He  created  for  you  mates  from  among 
yourselves,  that  you  may  dwell  in  tranquillity  with  them,  and  He  has  put  love 
and mercy between your [hearts]: Verily in that are Signs for those who reflect. 

And  among  His  Signs  is  the  creation  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  and  the 
variations in your languages and your colours: verily in that are Signs for those 
who know. 

And  among  His  Signs  is  the  sleep  that  you  take  by  night  and  by  day,  and  the 
quest that you [make for livelihood] out of His Bounty: verily in that are Signs 
for those who hearken. 

And among His Signs, He shows you the lightning, by way both of fear and of 
hope,  and  He  sends  down  rain  from  the  sky  and  with  it  gives  life  to  the  earth 
after it is dead: verily in that are Signs for those who are wise. 

And  among  His  Signs  is  this,  that  heaven  and  earth  stand  by  His  Command: 
then  when  He  calls  you,  by  a  single  call,  from  the  earth,  behold,  you 
[straightway] come forth. 

To Him belongs every being that is in the heavens and on earth: all are devoutly 
obedient to Him. 

It is He Who begins [the process of] creation; then repeats it; and for Him it is 
most  easy.  To  Him  belongs  the  loftiest  similitude  [we  can  think  of]  in  the 
heavens and the earth: For He is Exalted in Might, Full of Wisdom.44

In  this  Ninth  Ray  will  be  expounded  a  supreme  point  of  these  sublime  heavenly 
verses, which demonstrate one of the ‘poles’ of belief; these mighty sacred proofs of the 
resurrection of the dead will be explained. It is a subtle instance of dominical grace that 
thirty  years ago at the end of his work entitled  Muhâkemat (Reasonings), which was an 
introduction to Qur’anic commentaries, the Old Said wrote: “Second Aim: Two Qur’anic 
verses  alluding  to the  resurrection  of  the  dead  will  be  expounded  and  explained.  In  the 
Name  of  God,  the  Merciful,  the  Compassionate.”  There  he  stopped  and  could  write  no 
further. Now, praise and thanks to my Compassionate Creator to the number of signs and 
indications of the resurrection, that after thirty years He has given me success. Yes, nine 
or  ten  years  ago,  He  bestowed  the  Tenth  and  Twenty-Ninth  Words,  two  brilliant  and 
powerful proofs expounding the Divine decree of: 

So  look  to  the  signs  of  God’s  mercy,  how  He  raises  to  life  the  earth  after  its 
death;  He  it  is  who  will  raise  the  dead  to  life,  for  He  is  Powerful  Over  All 
Things45 

which was the first of the two verses. They silenced the deniers of resurrection. Now, 
nine or ten years after those two impregnable bastions of belief in the resurrection of the 
dead, He bestowed with the present treatise a commentary on the second of the above two 
sublime verses. This Ninth Ray, then, consists of Nine Elevated Stations, indicated by the 
above-mentioned verses, and an important Introduction. 

Introduction 

[This  consists  of  two  Points  comprising  a  concise  explanation  of  one 
comprehensive result of the numerous spiritual benefits of belief in resurrection 
and of its vital consequences; a demonstration of how essential it is for human 
life and especially for the life of society; a summary of one universal proof out 
of numerous proofs of the tenet of belief in the resurrection; and a statement of 
how indubitable and self-evident is that tenet of belief.] 

FIRST POINT 

We shall indicate, as a measure, only four out of hundreds of proofs that belief in the 
hereafter is fundamental to the life of society and to man’s personal life, and is the basis 
of his happiness, prosperity, and achievement. 

T h e   F i r s t :  It is only with the thought of Paradise that children, who  

                                                

45 Qur’an, 30:50. 

 

110 

form almost a half of  mankind, can endure all the deaths around them, which appear to 
them to be grievous and frightening, and strengthen the morale of their weak and delicate 
beings. Through Paradise they find hope in their vulnerable spirits, prone to weeping, and 
may  live  happily.  For  example,  with  the  thought  of  Paradise,  one  may  say:  “My  little 
brother or  friend  has  died  and  become  a  bird  in  Paradise.  He  is  flying  around  Paradise 
and living more happily than us.” The frequent deaths before their unhappy eyes of other 
children  like  themselves  or of  grown-ups  will  otherwise  destroy  all  their  resistance  and 
morale, making their subtle faculties like their spirits, hearts, and minds weep in addition 
to their eyes; they will either decline utterly or become crazy, wretched animals. 

S e c o n d   P r o o f :  It is only through the life of the hereafter that the elderly, who 
form  half  of  mankind,  can  endure  the  proximity  of  the  grave,  and  be  consoled  at  the 
thought that their lives, to which they are firmly attached, will soon be extinguished and 
their  fine  worlds  come  to  an  end.  It  is  only  at  the  hope  of  eternal  life  that  they  can 
respond  to  the  grievous  despair  they  feel  in  their  emotional  child-like  spirits  at  the 
thought of death. Those worthy, anxious fathers and mothers, so deserving of compassion 
and  in  need  of  tranquillity  and  peace  of  mind,  will  otherwise  feel  a  terrible  spiritual 
turmoil  and  distress  in  their  hearts,  and  this  world  will  become  a  dark  prison  for  them, 
and life even, grievous torment.  

T  h  i  r  d    P  r  o  o  f  :  It  is  only  the  thought  of  Hell-fire  that  checks  the  turbulent 
emotions  of  youths,  the  most  vigorous  element  in  the  life  of  society,  and  their  violent 
excesses,  restraining  them  from  aggression,  oppression,  and  destruction,  and  ensuring 
that the life of society continues tranquilly. If not for fear of Hell, in accordance with the 
rule  ‘might  is  right,’  in  pursuing  their  desires,  those  drunken  youths  would  turn  the 
worlds  of  the  wretched  weak  and  powerless  into Hell,  and  elevated  humanity  into  base 
animality. 

F o u r t h   P r o o f : The most comprehensive centre of man’s worldly life, and its 
mainspring,  and  a  paradise,  refuge,  and  fortress  of  worldly  happiness,  is  the  life  of  the 
family.  Everyone’s  home  is  a  small  world  for  him.  And  the  life  and  happiness  of  his 
home and family are possible through genuine, earnest, and loyal respect and true, tender, 
and self-sacrificing compassion. This true respect and genuine kindness may be achieved 
with  the  idea  of  the  members  of  the  family  having  an  everlasting  companionship  and 
friendship  and  togetherness,  and  their  parental,  filial,  brotherly,  and  friendly  relations 
continuing  for  all  eternity  in  a  limitless  life,  and  their  believing  this.  One  says,  for 
example:  “My  wife  will  be  my  constant  companion  in  an  everlasting  world  and  eternal 
life. It does not matter if she is now old and ugly, for she will have an immortal beauty.” 
He  will  tell  himself  that  he  will  be  as  kind  and  devoted  as  he  can  for  the  sake  of  that 
permanent  companionship,  and  treat  his  elderly  wife  lovingly  and  kindly  as  though  she 
were a  

 

111 

beautiful  houri.  A  companionship  that  was to  end  in  eternal  separation  after  an  hour or 
two  of  brief,  apparent  friendship  would  otherwise  afford  only  superficial,  temporary, 
feigned,  animal-like  feelings,  and  false  compassion  and  artificial  respect.  As  with 
animals,  self-interest  and  other  overpowering  emotions  would  prevail  over  the  respect 
and compassion, transforming that worldly paradise into Hell. 

Thus, one of the hundreds of results of belief in resurrection is connected with the life 
of society. If a comparison is made between the above four proofs out of the hundreds of 
aspects and benefits of this single consequence and the rest, it will be understood that the 
realization of the truth of resurrection, and  its occurrence, are as certain as the elevated 
reality  of  humanity  and  its  universal  need.  It  is  clearer  even  than  the  evidence  for  the 
existence  of  food  offered  by  the  existence  of  need  in  man’s  stomach,  and  tells  of  its 
existence  even  more  clearly.  And  it  proves  that  if  the  consequences  of  the  truth  of 
resurrection  were  to  quit  humanity,  whose  nature  is  extremely  significant,  lofty,  and 
living, it would descend to being a corrupt corpse fed on by microbes. 

The sociologists, politicians, and  moralists, who govern  mankind and  are concerned 
with its social and moral questions should be aware of this! How do they propose to fill 
this vacuum? With what can they cure these deep wounds? 

SECOND POINT 

This  explains  in  summary  form  a  proof  —one  of  many—  proceeding  from  the 

testimony to the truth of resurrection of the other pillars of belief. It is as follows: 

All the miracles indicating the Messengership of Muhammad (Peace and blessings be 
upon  him)  and  the  evidences  for  his  prophethood,  and  all  the  proofs  of  his  veracity, 
together testify to the occurrence of the resurrection, and prove it. For after Divine unity, 
everything  he  claimed  throughout  his  life  was  centred  on  the  resurrection  of  the  dead. 
Also,  all  his  miracles  and  proofs  affirming,  and  making  affirmed,  all  the  previous 
prophets  attest  to  the  same  truth.  Also,  the  testimony  of  the  phrase  “and  in  His 
Scriptures,”  which  makes  completely  clear  the  testimony  of  the  phrase  “and  in  His 
Prophets,” testifies to the same truth. Like this: 

All  the  miracles,  truths,  and  proofs  proving  foremost  the  veracity  of  the  Qur’an  of 
Miraculous  Exposition,  testify  to  and  prove  the  realization  and  occurrence  of 
resurrection. For almost a third of the Qur’an is about resurrection, and at the beginning 
of  most  of  its  short  suras  are  powerful  verses  about  it.  It  expresses  the  same  truth 
explicitly and implicitly with thousands of its verses, and proves and demonstrates it. For 
example: 

 

112 

When the sun is folded up.46   

O men, fear your Sustainer; the trembling of the Hour  
is an awesome event;47   
When the earth is convulsed;48   
When the heavens are torn asunder;49   
When the heavens are torn apart;50   
Concerning what they dispute;51   
Has the story reached you, of the overwhelming event?52 

Besides  demonstrating  with  complete  certainty  at  the  beginning  of  thirty  or  forty 
suras  that  resurrection  is  the  most  important  and  necessary  truth  in  the  universe,  it  sets 
forth various persuasive evidences for that truth in others of its verses.  

Is there any possibility that belief in the hereafter should be false, which emerges like 
the sun from the thousands of declarations and statements of a Book a single indication of 
one of the verses of which has yielded before our eyes the fruits of numerous learned and 
cosmic truths in the Islamic sciences? Is there any possibility of denying the sun, or the 
existence of the universe? Would it not be impossible and absurd? Is it at all possible that 
although an army may sometimes be plunged into battle so that a mere sign of the king 
should not be given the lie, to show as false the thousands of words, promises, and threats 
of that most serious, proud monarch? Is it possible that they should be false? 

Although  a  single  sign  of  that  glorious  spiritual  monarch  who  for  thirteen  centuries 
without  break  has  ruled  over  innumerable  spirits,  minds,  hearts,  and  souls  within  the 
bounds of truth and reality, and trained and raised them, would be sufficient to prove the 
truth of resurrection,  it has demonstrated it with thousands of explicit statements. Is the 
torment of Hell-fire not necessary then for the compounded idiot who does not recognize 
this fact? Is it not pure justice? 

Moreover, by their definite acceptance of the truth of resurrection, which the Qur’an 
—prevailing over the future and all times— repeatedly proves in detail and elucidates, all 
the  revealed  scriptures  and  sacred  books,  each  of  which  dominated  a  particular  period, 
proved it according to their own times  

                                                

46 Qur’an, 81:1.

48 Qur’an, 99:1.

and  centuries,  but  in  undetailed,  veiled,  and  summary  manner,  confirming  with  a 
thousand signatures what the Qur’an teaches. 

Included  here  since  it  is  related  to this  discussion  is  the  testimony  at the  end  of  the 
Third  Ray  of  the  other  pillars  of  faith  and  particularly  “the  Prophets”  and  “Holy 
Scriptures” to “belief in the Last Day.” It forms a convincing proof of resurrection, and is 
in the form of a powerful yet succinct supplication, which dispels all doubts. It says in the 
supplication: 

“O My Compassionate Sustainer! 
“I  have  understood  from  the  instruction  of  Your  Noble  Messenger  (PBUH)  and  the 
teaching  of  the  Qur’an,  that  foremost the  Qur’an  and  the  Messenger,  and  all  the  sacred 
scriptures  and  prophets,  have  unanimously 
testified  and  pointed  out  that  the 
manifestations of the Names related to Your beauty and glory, examples of which are to 
be  seen  in  this  world,  will  continue  even  more  radiantly  for  all  eternity,  and  that  Your 
bounties,  samples of which are to be observed  in this transitory world, will continue  in 
the  abode  of  bliss  in  more  glittering  fashion,  and  that  those  who  long  for  them  in  this 
world will accompany them for all eternity. 

“Also,  relying  on  hundreds  of  evident  miracles  and  decisive  signs,  foremost  Your 
Most Noble Messenger (Peace and blessings be upon him) and the All-Wise Qur’an, and 
the prophets with their luminous spirits, and the saints, who are spiritual poles with their 
light-filled  hearts,  and  the  purified  scholars  with  their  enlightened  intellects,  relying  on 
Your  repeated  threats  and  promises  in  all  the  sacred  scriptures,  and  trusting  in  Your 
sacred  attributes  like  power,  mercy,  favour,  wisdom,  glory,  and  beauty,  and  on  Your 
functions, and the dignity of Your glory, and the sovereignty of Your dominicality, and in 
consequence  of  their  illuminations  and  visions  and  beliefs  at  ‘the  knowledge  of 
certainty,’ give the glad tidings to men and jinn of eternal happiness and inform them of 
Hell for the people of misguidance; they firmly believe this and testify to it. 

“O All-Powerful and Wise One! O Most Merciful and Compassionate! O Munificent 
One  True  to  His  Promise!  O  All-Compelling  One  of  Glory,  One  of  Dignity,  Grandeur, 
and Wrath! 

“You  are  utterly  exempt  from  and  exalted  above  giving  the  lie  to  so  many  loyal 
friends,  and  so  many  promises,  and  attributes  and  functions,  and  denying  the  certain 
demands  of  the  sovereignty  of  Your  dominicality  and  the  endless  prayers  and 
supplications of Your innumerable acceptable servants, whom You love and who attract 
Your love by assenting to You and obeying You; and You are exempt from confirming 
the denial of resurrection  by the people of  misguidance and unbelief, who through their 
disbelief  and  rebellion  and  denial  of  Your  promises,  offend  the  magnificence  of  Your 
grandeur and affront Your dignity and glory and the  

 

114 

honour of Your Godhead, and sadden the compassion of Your dominicality. We declare 
Your justice, beauty, and mercy to be exempt from such infinite tyranny, such ugliness. 
We believe with all our strength that the testimony of the prophets, purified scholars, and 
saints, who are those truthful envoys of Yours, those heralds of Your sovereignty, at the 
degrees of ‘absolute certainty,’ ‘knowledge of certainty,’ and ‘the vision of certainty,’ to 
the  treasuries  of  Your  mercy  in  the  hereafter  and  the  stores  of  Your  bounties  in  the 
everlasting  realm,  and  to  the  wondrously  beautiful  manifestations  of  Your  Beautiful 
Names,  which  will  be  manifested  totally  in  the  abode  of  bliss,  are  absolutely  true  and 
veracious, and what they have indicated conforms absolutely with reality, and that what 
they have given glad tidings of is true and will occur. Believing that the supreme ray of 
Your Name of Truth, which is the source, sun, and protector of all realities, is this truth of 
the resurrection and Great Gathering, they teach it to Your servants. 

“O  God!  For  the  sake  of  what  they  teach  and  in  veneration  of  it,  grant  us  and  all 
students  of  the  Risale-i  Nur  perfect  belief  and  a  happy  death.  And  allow  us  to  receive 
their intercession. Amen!” 

Moreover, just as all the proofs demonstrating the veracity of the revealed scriptures, 
and  all  the  miracles  and  evidences  proving  the  prophethood of  God’s  Beloved  (PBUH) 
and  of  all  the  prophets,  indirectly  prove  the  reality  of  the  hereafter,  which  is  what  they 
teach above all else; so most of the evidences for the existence and unity of the Necessary 
Existent  testify  indirectly  to  the  existence  and  opening  up  of  an  eternal  realm  of  bliss, 
which will be the supreme manifestation of dominicality and divinity. For as is explained 
and  proved  in  the  following  paragraphs,  both  the  existence  of  the  Necessarily  Existent 
One,  and  most  of  His  attributes,  functions  and  Names,  like  dominicality,  Godhead, 
mercy, grace, wisdom, and justice, necessitate the hereafter with the utmost certainty, and 
demand  an  eternal  realm  and  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  and  Last  Judgement  for  the 
granting of reward and punishment. 

Since there is a pre-eternal and post-eternal God, most certainly there is the hereafter, 

the everlasting means of the sovereignty of His Godhead. 

And  since  there  is  in  the  universe  and  in  living  beings  a  most  majestic,  wise,  and 
compassionate absolute dominicality, and  it  is apparent; there  is certain to be an eternal 
realm of happiness which will save the majesty of that dominicality from abasement, its 
wisdom  from purposelessness, and  its compassion  from cruelty; and that realm  shall  be 
entered. 

And since the unlimited bestowals, bounties, favours, gifts, and instances of grace and 
mercy which are to be seen, show to minds that are not extinguished and hearts that are 
not dead that behind the veil of the Unseen is  

 

115 

One All-Merciful and Compassionate; surely there is an immortal life in an eternal realm 
which  will  save  the  bestowal  from  mockery,  the  bounties  from  deception,  the  favours 
from enmity, the mercy from torment, the grace and gifts from treachery, and will make 
the bounties bounty and the bestowal bestowal. 

And since in the springtime on the narrow page of the earth, a pen of power writes a 
hundred thousand books without error tirelessly before our eyes; and since the Holder of 
the  pen  has  promised  a  hundred  thousand  times:  “I  am  going  to  write  a  fine,  immortal 
book in a broad realm, easier than this book of the spring, which is written in this narrow 
realm, confused and intermingled, and I shall allow you to read it;” He mentions the book 
in  all  his  decrees;  certainly,  the  main  part  of  the  book  has  been  written,  and  with  the 
resurrection  and  Last  Judgement  its  footnotes  shall  be  added,  and  all  the  notebooks  of 
people’s actions shall be recorded in it. 

And  since,  with  its  multiplicity  of  creatures,  and  its  being  the  dwelling,  source, 
factory, exhibition, and gathering place of hundreds of thousands of constantly changing 
species of living beings and beings with spirits, and the heart, centre, summary, and result 
of the universe, and the reason for its creation, the earth has supreme importance, and is 
held  equal  to  the  mighty  heavens  despite  its  smallness;  in  the  heavenly  decrees,  it  is 
always said: Sustainer of the Heavens and Earth... 

And  since  there  is  man,  who  rules  over  the  earth,  which  is  thus,  has  disposal  over 
most  creatures,  and  subjects  most  living  beings  gathering  them  around  himself;  and  so 
orders,  displays,  and  gathers  each  remarkable  species  together  in  one  place  like  a  list, 
adorning them, that he attracts not only the attention and admiration of men and jinn, but 
of  the  dwellers  of  the  heavens  and  the  universe,  and  the  appreciative  gaze  of  the 
universe’s Owner, thus gaining great importance and high worth; and who shows through 
his  sciences  and  arts  that  he  is  the  purpose  of  the  universe’s  creation,  and  its  most 
important  result,  and  most  precious  fruit,  and  the  vicegerent  of  the  earth;  and  who 
because  with  respect  to  this  world,  he  has  ordered  and  displayed  excellently  the 
miraculous  arts  of  the  world’s  Maker,  is  left  in  this  world  despite  his  rebellion  and 
disbelief,  and  whose  punishment  is  postponed,  and  because  of  this  work  of  his,  whose 
term is prolonged and is allowed success... 

And  since  there  is  an  extremely  powerful,  wise,  and  compassionate  Disposer,  Who 
makes the mighty globe into a treasury of every sort of metal and mineral that man needs 
in a way entirely beyond his strength and will —who despite being weak, impotent, and 
wanting  by  nature  and  creation,  has  innumerable  needs  and  is  subject  to  innumerable 
pains— and a  store of every  sort of  food, and a shop stocking goods of every kind that 
pleases  

 

116 

man, and looks to man in this way, and nurtures him, and gives him what he wants... 

And since there is a Sustainer Who is thus, Who both loves man, and causes man to 
love Him, and  Who is enduring, and  has eternal  worlds, and  Who performs every  work 
with justice, and carries out everything with wisdom; and since the splendour of that Pre-
Eternal  Sovereign’s  rule  and  His  eternal  rule  cannot  be  contained  in  this  brief  worldly 
life,  and  in  man’s  fleeting  span, and  in the temporary and transient earth; and  since the 
excessive  wrongdoing  and  rebellion  that  occur  among  men,  which  are  contrary  to  and 
opposed to the universe’s order, justice, balance, and beauty, and their denial, treachery, 
and disbelief towards their Benefactor, Who nurtures them tenderly, are not punished in 
this world, and the cruel oppressor passes  his  life  in ease, while the unhappy oppressed 
live in hardship; and since the absolute justice whose traces are to be seen throughout the 
universe  is entirely opposed to the cruel tyrant and despairing oppressed  being equal  in 
death, and would in no way permit it... 

And  since  just as the universe’s Owner  has  chosen the  earth  from the universe, and 
man from the earth, and bestowed on him a high rank and importance; so out of mankind 
He has chosen the prophets, saints, and purified ones, true human beings who conform to 
the  aims  of  His  dominicality  and  through  their  belief  and  submission  make  Him  love 
them; He  has taken them as  friends and addressees, and  bestowed miracles and success 
on them and punished their enemies with  heavenly  blows. And out of these worthy and 
lovable  friends  He  has  chosen  their  leader  and  source  of  pride,  Muhammad  (Peace  and 
blessings  be  upon  him),  and  for  long  centuries  has  illuminated  with  his  Light  half  the 
globe and a fifth of humanity; as though the universe was created for him, all its purposes 
become apparent through him and his religion and the Qur’an. And although he deserved 
to live for an infinite time in recompense for his infinitely valuable service, for millions 
of years, he only lived a brief sixty-three years of great hardship and striving. Is there any 
possibility then that he should not be resurrected together with all his peers and friends? 
That they should not now be living in the spirit? That they should have been annihilated 
eternally? God forbid, a hundred thousand times! Yes, all the universe and the reality of 
the world demand that he should  be resurrected and they  beseech the universe’s Owner 
that he should be living... 

And  since  in  the  Seventh  Ray,  The  Supreme  Sign,  each  with  the  strength  of  a 
mountain,  the  thirty-three  powerful  consensuses  have  proved  that the  universe  emerged 
from  a  single  hand  and  is  the  property  of  a  single  being;  and  have  demonstrated  self-
evidently His unity and oneness, the means of the Divine perfections; and through unity 
and  oneness  all  beings  become  like  soldiers  under  orders  and  subservient  officials;  and 
with the coming of  

 

117 

the hereafter, perfections are saved from decline, absolute justice from mocking cruelty, 
universal wisdom from foolish absurdity, all-embracing mercy from jeering torment, and 
the dignity of power from abased impotence, and they are exonerated from this... 

Certainly and without any doubt, as necessitated by the truths in these six ‘sinces’ —
six out of hundreds of points of belief in God— the end of the world shall come and the 
resurrection of the dead occur. Abodes of reward and punishment shall be thrown open so 
that  the  above-mentioned  importance  of  the  earth,  and  its  centrality,  and  man’s 
importance and value shall be realized, and the above-mentioned justice, wisdom, mercy, 
and sovereignty of the  All-Wise Disposer, Who  is the  Creator of the  earth and of  man, 
and their Sustainer, shall be established; and the true and yearning friends of that eternal 
Sustainer  shall  be saved  from  eternal annihilation; and the  most eminent and worthy of 
those friends receive the recompense for his sacred services, which have made all beings 
pleased  and  indebted;  and  the  perfections  of  the  Eternal  Sovereign  should  be  exempted 
and  exonerated  from  all  fault  and  deficiency,  and  His  power  from  impotence,  and  His 
wisdom from foolishness, and His justice from tyranny. 

In Short: Since God exists, so does the hereafter certainly exist. 
Moreover,  just  as  with  all  the  evidences  that  prove  them,  the  above  three  pillars  of 
belief testify to and indicate resurrection; so do the two pillars “and in the angels, and in 
Divine Determining, that both the good of it and the evil of it are from God Almighty,” 
also necessitate resurrection and testify in powerful fashion to the eternal realm. It is like 
this:  

All the evidences proving the existence of the angels and their duties of worship, and 
innumerable  observations  of  them  and  conversations  with  them,  prove  indirectly  the 
existence  of  the  Spirit  World,  and  the  World  of  the  Unseen,  and  the  eternal  realm  and 
world of the hereafter, and the existence of an abode of happiness and Paradise and Hell, 
which in the future shall be populated with men and jinn. For with Divine permission, the 
angels  can  see  these  worlds  and  enter them.  And  all  the  high-ranking  angels  who  meet 
with humans, like Gabriel, tell unanimously of the existence of these worlds and of their 
travelling round them. Just as we are certain, due to the information of those coming from 
there,  that  the  continent  of  America  exists,  although  we  have  not  seen  it,  so  due  to 
information  about  the  angels,  which  has  the  strength  of  a  hundredfold  consensus,  we 
should  believe  in  the  existence  of  the  world  of  eternity,  the  realm  of  the  hereafter,  and 
Paradise and Hell with the same certainty. And thus we do believe in it. 

Furthermore, all the evidences proving the pillar  of  “belief  in  Divine  Determining,” 
included in the Treatise on Divine Determining, the Twenty-Sixth Word, prove indirectly 
the resurrection of the dead, the balancing of  

 

118 

deeds on the supreme scales, and the publishing of the pages of deeds. For the recording 
before our eyes of the appointed courses of all things on the tablets of order and balance, 
and the inscribing of the life-stories of all living beings in their faculties of memory, and 
the transcribing of the notebooks of deeds of all beings with spirits, and especially men, 
on  the  Preserved  Tablet,  such  a  comprehensive  determining  and  wise  apportioning  and 
precise recording and preserving  inscription could surely only  be the result of a general 
judgement  in  a  supreme  tribunal  set  up to  mete out  permanent  reward  and  punishment. 
That  comprehensive  and  precise  recording  and  preservation  would  otherwise  be 
completely meaningless and purposeless, and contrary to wisdom and reality. 

Also,  if  there  was  no  resurrection,  all  the  certain  meanings  of  the  book  of  the 
universe,  written  with  the  pen  of  Divine  Determining,  would  be  nullified,  which  is 
completely impossible. It is as impossible as denying the universe’s existence, indeed, is 
a delirium. 

In Short: The five pillars of belief demand with all their evidences the occurrence of 
the resurrection and Last Judgement, and their existence, and the existence and opening 
up of the realm of the hereafter, and they testify to these and necessitate them.  

Thus,  it  is  because  there  are  such  vast  and  unshakeable  supports  and  proofs  of  the 
resurrection,  completely  in  conformity  with  its  vastness,  that  almost  one  third  of  the 
Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  is  formed  by  resurrection  and  the  hereafter,  and  it 
makes it the basis and foundation stone of all its truths, and constructs everything on it. 

 (The end of the Introduction)

Second Part 
of the Addendum 

The  first  of  nine  stations  comprising  the  nine  levels  of  proofs  of  resurrection 

miraculously indicated in the following verse: 

Glory  be  to  God  in  the  evening  and  at  daybreak,  and  praise  is  His  in  the 
heavens and earth, at nightfall and when the day begins to decline. It is He Who 
brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the living, 
and gives life to the earth after its death; thus, too, will you be brought forth.53 

The  manifest  proof  and  brilliant  evidence  of  God’s  decree  concerning  resurrection 

contained in this verse will now be expounded and set forth, God willing.54 

In connection with the twenty-eighth property of life it was explained that life looks 
upon the six  pillars of  faith and proves them;  it contains a  series of  indications of their 
truth. 

Now the most important result, substance and reason for the creation of the cosmos is 
none  other  than  life,  and  life,  that  exalted  verity,  can  in  no  way  be  restricted  to  this 
transient,  brief,  defective  and  painful  worldly  life.  Rather  the  purpose  and  result  of  the 
tree of  life, the splendour of which can  be deduced  from  its twenty-nine properties, the 
fruit of that tree worthy of its splendour, is the eternal life of the hereafter; it is life in the 
eternal realm where even stones, trees and the soil will be endowed with life. Otherwise, 
it will follow that the tree of life, so plentifully decked out with significant instruments, 
yields  no  fruit, benefit or truth  for animate beings, especially  man; and  man who  in  his 
substance  and  faculties  is  twenty  times  superior  to  the  sparrow  and  is  indeed  the  most 
important and elevated of all creation, will fall to a degree twenty times lower than that of 
the sparrow; with respect to the  felicity of  his  life, he will  be the  most unfortunate and 
humiliated of wretches. 

Similarly,  intelligence,  the  most  precious  of  gifts  for  man,  will  wound  his  heart 

through constant reflection of the pains of the past and the fears of the  

                                                

53 Qur’an, 30:17-19. 
54 The whole station has not yet been written and has been included here because of the relevance of 
the topic of life to resurrection. In addition, it contains a subtle and profound allusion to the pillar of Divine 
Determining at the end of the topic of life. 

 

120 

future; it will mix nine pains with every pleasure and thus become a disaster to man. Now 
this  is  false  to  the  hundredth  degree.  The  life  of  this  world  thus  proves  decisively  the 
pillar  of  faith  that  is  belief  in  the  hereafter  and  displays  to our  eyes  every  spring  more 
than three hundred thousand specimens of resurrection. 

Is it at all possible that an All-Powerful Agent Who promptly supplies and provides, 
with wisdom, solicitude and mercy, all the instruments and tools needed for your life, in 
your  body,  your  garden  and  your  homeland,  Who  hears  and  answers  the  private  and 
particular  prayer  made  for  sustenance  by  your  stomach,  for  the  sake  of  its  life  and 
survival, Who shows His acceptance of that prayer by means of numerous delicious foods 
— is it at all possible that such a Being should not be aware of you or hear you, that He 
should not provide you with the means of life eternal, the greatest purpose of the human 
species?  Is  it  possible  that  He  should  not  accept  the  greatest,  most  significant,  most 
worthy  and  most  universal  prayer  for  eternity  of  the  human  species  by  establishing 
eternal life and creating paradise? Is it possible that He should not heed the universal and 
insistent  prayer  of  the  human  species,  the  most  important  creature  in  the  cosmos,  the 
monarch of the earth, a prayer that resounds throughout heaven and earth, and not pay it 
the same attention, or grant it the same gratification, as a little stomach? Is it possible that 
He should thus cause His perfect wisdom and infinite mercy to be denied? No, a hundred 
thousand times no! 

Again,  is  it  at  all  possible  that  He  should  hear  the  most  secret  voice  of  the  most 
minute of  beings, remedy  its pain and succour its plaint; that He should  nourish  it with 
the utmost care and consideration and cause creatures greater than itself to serve it — is it 
at  all  possible  that  He  should  do  all  of  this  and  not  hear the  thunderous  cry  of  life,  the 
greatest, most precious, most eternal and most delicate form of life? That He should pay 
no heed to its powerful prayer and supplications for eternity? It would be like equipping a 
single  soldier  with  the  utmost  care  and  totally  ignoring  a  vast  and  obedient  army!  Like 
seeing a speck and overlooking the sun!  Like  hearing the  buzz of a  fly and  not hearing 
the roar of the thunder! No, a hundred thousand times no! 

Again,  can  the  intelligence  at  all  accept  that  an  All-Powerful  and  All-Wise  Being, 
Whose mercy, love and solicitude are infinite, Who loves His own artistry, Who causes 
Himself to be loved, and Who greatly loves those that love Him — can it accept that such 
a Being would annihilate through permanent death  a  life that  loves Him  greatly, that  is 
itself lovable and that instinctively worships its Maker; and, the essence and jewel of that 
life,  the  spirit?  That  He  would  offend  and  insult  His  lover  and  beloved  for  all  eternity, 
that He would injure his feelings and deny Himself, and cause others to deny, the mystery 
of His  mercy and the  light of His  love? No, a hundred thousand times  no!  An absolute 
beauty that adorns creation with its  

 

121 

manifestation and the absolute  mercy that  makes  all creatures rejoice are without doubt 
exempt and purified from such infinite ugliness, such utter abomination and pitilessness. 

The result, then,  is that considering the existence  of  life, those  men who understand 
the  purpose  of  life  and  who  do  not  misuse  their  lives  will  become  manifestations  of 
eternal  life  in the realm of eternity and eternal Paradise. In this we  believe. So, too, the 
shining of brilliant objects found on the earth through the reflection of sunlight, the brief 
glinting  on  the  surface  of  the  ocean  of  little  bubbles  through  flashes  of  light,  and  the 
coming in their place of further bubbles that like them hold up a mirror to a whole series 
of  imaginary  suns  —  this  demonstrates  tangibly  that  those  flashes  are  the  reflectory 
manifestation of the one supreme sun.  With their  manifold tongues, they  make  mention 
of that one sun and they point toward it with their luminous fingers. 

So, too, the fashion in which, through the supreme manifestation of the Name ‘Giver 
of Life’ of the Living and Self-Subsistent Being, all the animate beings on the face of the 
earth and in the depths of the sea shine through God’s power, and then disappear behind 
the  veil  of  the  unseen,  saying,  “O  Eternally  Living  One!”,  in  order  to  make  room  for 
those that follow them — this represents a series of testimonies to and indications of the 
life and necessary existence of the Living and Self-Subsistent Being. 

Similarly, all the proofs that bear witness to the Divine knowledge the traces of which 
are visible in the ordering of all beings; all the evidences that establish the existence of a 
power working its will throughout creation; all the arguments that point to a volition and 
purposefulness  dominating  the  ordering  and  administering  of  the  cosmos;  all  the  signs 
and  miracles  that  attest  the  messengerhood  of  the  prophets,  the  means  of  dominical 
speech and Divine revelation, and the indications bearing witness to the seven attributes 
of  Divinity  —  all  of  them  point  to,  testify  to,  and  indicate  unanimously  the  life  of  the 
Living and Self-Subsistent Being. For if the faculty of vision is present in a thing, there 
must also be life. If there is hearing, this too is a sign of life. If there is speech, this also 
points to the existence of life. 

Similarly,  attributes  the  existence  of  which  is  proven  and  self-evident  by  virtue  of 
their traces throughout the cosmos, attributes such as Absolute power, all-embracing will, 
and  comprehensive  knowledge,  bear  witness  with  all  of  their  proofs  to  the  life  and 
necessary existence of the Living and Self-Subsistent Being. They attest His everlasting 
life,  one  shadow  of  which  is  enough  to  illumine  the  whole  of  the  cosmos,  and  one 
manifestation  of  which  suffices  to  give  life  to  the  hereafter,  together  with  all  of  its 
particles. 

The  Divine  attribute  of  life  is  also  connected  with  the  pillar  of  belief  in  the  angels, 

and proves it by way of indication. For the most important of all  

 

122 

goals  of  the  cosmos  is  life,  and  animate  beings  constitute the  most  widespread  form  of 
creation, with its specimens multiplied on account of their value; they constantly animate 
the hospice of this world with the coming and going of their caravans. Further, the globe, 
which is filled with so many species of animate beings, is being constantly emptied and 
refilled  as  these  various  species  are  renewed  and  multiplied,  and  animate  beings  are 
created in multiplicity even in the vilest and most corrupt substances, so that there is —as 
it were— a constant resurrection of microbes. Finally, consciousness and intellect, which 
are the distilled essence of life, and the spirit, which is its subtle and stable substance, are 
also created everywhere on the globe in the utmost multiplicity, so that it is as if the globe 
were animated and caused to rejoice by life, intellect, consciousness and spirit. If we take 
into  consideration  all  of  the  foregoing,  it  is  totally  impossible  that the  heavenly  bodies, 
which are subtler, more luminous, greater and more significant than the globe, should be 
dead, rigid, lifeless, and dumb. 

There  must,  then,  exist  and  be  provided  with  the  property  of  life,  conscious  and 
animate  beings  that  animate  the  skies,  the  suns,  and  the  stars,  bestow  upon  them  their 
vitality,  manifest  the  result  of  the  purpose  for  the  creation  of  the  heavens,  and  receive 
address from the Glorious Creator. These creatures, of a nature suited to the heavens, are 
none other than the angels. 

Similarly, the innermost essence of life symbolically proves the pillar of belief in the 
prophets.  For the  cosmos  was  created  for the  sake  of  life,  and  life  is  in  turn  one  of  the 
supreme  manifestations  of  the  Living,  Self-Subsistent  and  Eternal  One.  It  is  one  of  His 
most  perfect  designs,  one  of  His  most  beauteous  arts.  Further,  the  eternal  life  of  God 
shows itself only through the sending of messengers and the revelation of books. If there 
were no books or prophets, then eternal life would remain unknown. When a man speaks, 
he  is  recognized  to  be  alive.  Similarly,  it  is  the  prophets  and  revealed  books that  make 
manifest the words and decrees of the Being Who, from behind the world of the unseen 
that  is  veiled  by  the  cosmos,  speaks,  talks,  and  emits  His  commands  and  prohibitions. 
Just as the life existent in the cosmos bears decisive witness to the necessary existence of 
the Living and Eternal One, so too does  it point to and  indirectly confirm the pillars of 
belief in the sending of messengers and the revelation of scriptures, for these are the rays, 
the manifestations, and the relations of that eternal life. And especially the messengership 
of Muhammad —Peace and blessings be upon him— and the Qur’anic revelation, since 
they  are  like  the  very  spirit  and  intellect  of  life,  their  veracity  is  as  indisputable  as  the 
existence of this life. 

Life  is,  then,  the  distilled  essence  of  the  cosmos;  consciousness  and  feeling  are  the 
distilled  essence  of  life;  the  intellect  is  the  distilled  essence  of  consciousness;  and  the 
spirit, finally, is the pure and unsullied substance, the  

 

123 

stable  and  autonomous  essence,  that  lies  at  the  heart  of  life.  So,  too,  the  life  of  the 
Prophet Muhammad —Peace and blessings  be upon him— in both its outer and its inner 
aspects  is  the  distilled  quintessence  of  life  and  the  spirit  of  the  cosmos,  and  the 
messengership  of  Muhammad  —Peace  and  blessings    be  upon  him—  is  the  pure  and 
distilled essence of the feeling, the consciousness and the intellect of the cosmos. Rather, 
the life of the Prophet Muhammad —Peace and blessings  be upon him— in its outer and 
inner aspects  is, as the centuries  have  borne  witness, the  very essence of the  life of the 
cosmos, and the prophethood of Muhammad —Peace and blessings  be upon him— is the 
very  light  and  essence  of  the  consciousness  of  the  cosmos.  The  Qur’anic  revelation  is 
also the spirit of the life of the cosmos and the intellect of its consciousness. 

If  the  light  of  the  messengership  of  Muhammad  —Peace  and  blessings    be  upon 
him— were to depart from the cosmos and vanish, the cosmos would die. If the Qur’an 
were to depart, the cosmos would lose its sanity, and the globe would lose its sense and 
its head. Its dizzy, uncomprehending head would collide with a planet, and the end of the 
world would result. 

Life also looks to the pillar of belief in Divine Determining, and proves it indirectly. 
Because, since life is the light of the Manifest World, and it dominates it, and is the result 
and aim of existence, and since it is the most comprehensive mirror of the Creator of the 
universe and the most perfect sample and index of dominical activity, and —let there be 
no mistake in the comparison— is like a sort of programme, for sure, the mystery of life 
necessitates that the creatures in the World of the Unseen, that is, the past and the future, 
that  is,  that  have  been  and  will  come,  are  predisposed  to  conform  to  order,  regularity, 
being  known  and  observed,  specific  individual  existence,  and  the  creative  commands, 
which are their lives in one respect. 

The original seed of a tree and its root, as well as the seeds contained in its fruit and 
final  outcome,  all  manifest  a  sort  of  life,  no  less  than  the  tree  itself;  indeed,  they  bear 
within themselves laws of life more subtle than those of the tree. Similarly, the seeds and 
roots left by last autumn, before the present spring, as well as the seeds and roots that will 
be  left  to  subsequent  springs  after  this  spring  has  departed  —  they  all  bear  the 
manifestations of life, just like this spring, and are subject to the laws of life. In just the 
same  way,  all  the  branches  and  twigs  of  the  cosmic  tree  each  have  a  past  and  a  future. 
They  have a  chain consisting of past and  future stages and circumstances. The  multiple 
existences  and  stages  of  each  species  and  each  member  of  each  species,  existing  in 
Divine  knowledge,  forms  a  chain  of  being  in  God’s  knowledge,  and  both  its  external 
existence, and its existence in God’s knowledge, is a manifestation of universal life that 
draws  all  the  aspects  of  its  life  from  these  meaningful  and  vital  Tablets  of  Divine 
Determining. 

 

124 

The fact that the World of Spirits —which is one form of the World of the Unseen— 
is full of the essence of life, the matter of life and the spirits, which are the substances and 
essence  of  life,  demands  and  requires  of  a  certainty  that  past  and  future  —which  are 
another form of the  World of the Unseen  and  its  second segment— should also receive 
the manifestation of life. 

In addition, the perfect order, the meaningful circumstances and vital fruits and stages 
inherent  in  the  existence  of  a  thing  within  God’s  knowledge,  also  demonstrate  the 
manifestation of a sort of life. Such a manifestation of life, which is the light emitted by 
the  sun  of  eternal  life,  cannot  be  limited  to  this  manifest  world,  this  present  time,  this 
external existence. On the contrary, each world receives the manifestation of that light in 
accordance  with  its  capacity,  and  the  cosmos  together  with  all  its  worlds  is  alive  and 
illumined  through  it.  Otherwise,  as  the  misguided  imagine,  beneath  a  temporary  and 
apparent life, each world would be a vast and terrible corpse, a dark ruin. 

One  broad  aspect  of  the  pillar  of  faith  in  Divine  Determining  and  Decree  is,  then, 
understood through the mystery of life and is established by it. Just as the life and vitality 
of  the  Manifest  World  and  existent,  visible  objects  becomes  apparent  from  their 
orderliness  and  the  consequences  of  their  existence,  so too  past  and  future  creatures  —
regarded  as  belonging  to the  World  of  the  Unseen—  have  an  immaterial  existence  and 
sort  of  life,  and  a  spiritual  presence  in  God’s  knowledge.  The  trace  of  this  life  and 
presence is made manifest and known by means of the Tablet of Divine Determining and 
Decree and through all the stages and circumstances of their external lives and existences.

Third Part 
of the Addendum 

A question related to the resurrection of the dead: 
The frequently repeated verse, It will be naught but a single cry,55 and the verse, The 
command of the Hour will be like the glance of the eye,56 show that the resurrection of the 
dead and Great Gathering will occur instantaneously, in a flash. But man’s narrow reason 
requires some tangible  example so that it can conceive of this wondrous, extraordinary, 
and unparalleled event, and accept it. 

T  h  e    A  n  s  w  e  r  :  At  the  resurrection  there  will  be  the  return  of  spirits  to  their 
bodies,  the  revivification  of  the  bodies,  and  the  remaking  of  the  bodies.  It  consists  of 
three matters. 

THE  FIRST  MATTER:  An  example  for  the  return  of  spirits  to their  bodies  is  the 
mustering, at a loud bugle call, of the members of a well-disciplined army after they have 
dispersed to rest. Yes, the Sur of the Angel Israfil is no less powerful than an army bugle. 
The spirits, too, who, while in post-eternity, reply with “Yes, we accept” to the question 
“Am  I  not  your  Sustainer?”,57  which  comes  from  pre-eternity,  are  infinitely  more 
subjugated,  disciplined,  and  obedient  than  the  soldiers  of  an  army.  The  Thirtieth  Word 
has  demonstrated  with  decisive  proofs  that  not  only  spirits,  but  all  particles,  form  a 
Divine army and are its soldiers under command. 

SECOND MATTER: An example for the revivification of bodies is the springing to 
life in an instant of the hundred thousand electric lights of a large city on a festival night, 
switched on from one centre. It would be possible to light up in the same way a hundred 
million  lamps  scattered  over  the  face  of  the  earth  from  one  centre.  Since  through  the 
training and instruction in regularity and order it has received from its Creator, a creature 
of  Almighty  God  like  electricity  —a  servant  and  candleholder  in  His  guest-house— 
possesses this quality, surely the resurrection of the dead could occur in the twinkling of 
an  eye  within  the  bounds  of  the  regular  laws  of  Divine  wisdom  which  thousands  of 
luminous servants represent, like electricity. 

                                                

55 Qur’an, 36:29, 49, 53; 38:15; 54:31. 
56 Qur’an, 16:77. 
57 Qur’an, 7:172. 

 

126 

THIRD  MATTER:  An  example  for  the  remaking  of  bodies  instantaneously  is  the 
perfect  remaking  within  a  few  days  of  all  the  trees  in  the  spring,  which  are  far  more 
numerous  than  all  humanity,  together  with  all  their  leaves,  in  exactly  the  same  way  as 
those  of  the  previous  spring;  and  the  bringing  into  being,  again  like  those  of  previous 
springs, all the blossoms, fruits and leaves of the trees with the speed of lightning; and the 
sudden awakening of the uncountable numbers of seeds, grains, and roots, which are the 
source  of  the  spring,  and  their  unfolding  and  being  raised  to  life;  and  reflecting  the 
meaning  of  “resurrection  after  death,”  the  sudden  raising  to  life  at  a  command  of  the 
upright  skeleton-like  corpses  of  the  trees;  and  the  reanimation  of  the  innumerable 
members of all species of small  animals;  and the revivification of all the sorts of  flying 
insects,  particularly  those  which,  continually  cleaning  their  faces,  eyes,  and  wings, 
remind  us  of  our  ablutions  and  cleanliness,  and  caress  our  faces  —the  resurrection  and 
remaking of all the members of this tribe within a few days every spring before our very 
eyes together with all the other species, despite being greater in number than all mankind 
since the time of Adam, provides not one example of the remaking of all human bodies at 
the resurrection, but thousands. 

Yes,  since  this  world  is  the  realm  of  wisdom  and  the  hereafter  the  realm  of  power, 
numerous Divine Names like All-Wise, Arranger, Disposer, and Nurturer, and dominical 
wisdom, require that the creation of things  in this world  is gradual and  in the course of 
time. In the hereafter, however, power and mercy will be manifested more than wisdom, 
and  there  being  no  need  for  matter,  time,  and  waiting,  things  will  be  made 
instantaneously. Alluding to the fact that things which are made here in a day or in a year 
will be made in the hereafter in an instant or a flash, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition 
states: 

The command of the Hour will be like the glance of the eye, or briefer.58 

If  you  want  to  be  as  certain  about the occurrence  of  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  as 
you  are  about  the  arrival  of  next  spring,  study  the  Tenth  and  Twenty-Ninth  Words 
carefully, which are about this, and  you will  see! If  you do not then  believe that  it will 
occur as you believe the coming of spring, come and stick your finger in my eye! 

A  FOURTH  MATTER:  The  death  of  the  world  and  Doomsday.  The  sudden 
collision with this globe, our guest-house, at a dominical command, of a planet or comet, 
could wipe out this dwelling-place of ours. Like the destruction  in a  minute of a palace 
the building of which had taken ten years.

Fourth Part 
of the Addendum 

He said: “Who shall give life to decaying bones?” Say: “He shall give them life 
who first gave them life, and He is All-Knowing concerning all creation.”59 

As was illustrated in the third comparison in the Ninth Truth of the Tenth Word, some 
personage may one day summon together before your eyes a great army. If someone were 
then  to  say,  “that  personage  is  able  to  call  together  the  troops  in  his  army,  who  had 
dispersed  to take  rest,  and  assemble  them  again  in  battalions,”  and  you  were  to  say,  “I 
don’t  believe  it,”  you  know  well  how  lunatic  would  be  your  denial.  So  too,  an  All-
Powerful and All-Knowing Being Who out of nothing recorded and put in place, with the 
command  of,  “Be!”,  and  it  is,  all  the  particles  and  subtle  aspects  of  the  bodies  of  all 
animals  and  other  animate  beings,  as  if  they  were  an  army  with  the  utmost orderliness 
and wise equilibrium, and Who creates each century, or rather each spring, the hundreds 
of thousands of different species and groups of animate beings that populate the face of 
the earth, each  like an army — such a Being can gather together, with one  blow on the 
trump of Israfil, all the fundamental particles and original components that enjoy mutual 
acquaintance  through  joint  submission  to  the  order  of  the  body  that  corresponds  to  a 
battalion. Were you to say, “how can this be?” or consider it unlikely, it would be idiotic 
lunacy. 

It  sometimes  happens  in  the  Qur’an  that,  in  order  to  impress  upon  the  heart  the 
wondrous deeds He will perform in the hereafter and to prepare the mind for acceptance 
of them, God Almighty mentions the wondrous deeds He performs in this world as a kind 
of  preparation.  Alternatively,  He  may  sometimes  mention  the  wondrous  deeds  He  will 
perform in the future and the hereafter in such a fashion that we are convinced of them by 
analogy with the similar deeds we observe in this world. One example is furnished by the 
verse, 

Has not man seen that We created him from a drop of sperm? 
And then he becomes an open disputer.60  

                                                

59 Qur’an, 36:78. 
60 Qur’an, 16:4. 

 

128 

and the remaining verses of the same sura. The All-Wise Qur’an thus proves the question 
of resurrection in seven or eight different forms. 

It first directs man’s attention to his own origins. It says “you see how you advanced 
from a drop of sperm to a drop of blood, from a drop of blood to a formless lump of flesh, 
and from a formless lump of flesh to human form. How, then, can you deny your second 
creation? It is just the same as the first, or even easier of accomplishment for God.” God 
Almighty also refers to the great bounties He has bestowed on man with phrases such as: 

He Who made fire for you from the green tree61 

and says to man: “Will the Being Who thus bestowed bounty upon you leave you to your 
own devices, in such fashion that you enter the grave to sleep without rising again?” He 
also hints at the following: “You see how dead trees come to life and grow green again. 
Refusing to regard as a parallel the reanimation  of  your bones, that resemble dry wood, 
you dismiss the whole matter as improbable. Now is it at all possible that the One Who 
creates the heavens and earth should  not be empowered over the  life and death of  man, 
the fruit of heaven and earth? Do you imagine that He would make fruitless and vain the 
tree  of  creation  that  He  has  moulded  with  wisdom  in  all  its  parts,  by  abandoning  the 
supreme result of that tree?” 

The  Qur’an  says  further:  “The  Being  That  will  restore  you  to  life  at  resurrection  is 
such  that  the  whole  cosmos  is  like  an  obedient  soldier  of  His.  It  bows  its  head 
submissively whenever it hears the command, 

 “Be!”, and it is.62 

To create a spring is easier for Him than the creation of a flower. To create the whole 
of  the  animal  realm  is  as  easy  for  His  power  as  creating  a  fly.  None  may  belittlingly 
challenge His power by saying to Him: 

Who will give life to the bones?63 

Then, from the verse, 

Glory be to Him in Whose hand lies the sovereignty of all things,64 

we see that the index of all things is in His hand, the key to all things is in His possession; 
He rotates night and day, winter and summer, with as much ease as if He were turning the 
pages  of  a  book.  He  is  an  All-Powerful,  Glorious  Being  Who  closes  the  door  on  this 
world and opens  it on the hereafter as  if they  were two stations. This being the case, as 
the result of the mentioned evidences,  

                                                

61 Qur’an, 36:80. 
62 Qur’an, 2:117. 
63 Qur’an, 36:78. 
64 Qur’an, 36:83. 

 

129 

To Him you shall return,65 

that  is,  He  will  bring  you  back  to  life  from  your  graves,  take  you  to  the  plain  of 

resurrection, and judge you in His majestic presence. 

Now these verses prepare the mind and make ready the heart to accept the reality of 
resurrection,  for  they  have  demonstrated  parallels  to  resurrection  in  worldly  processes. 
Sometimes it also happens that He mentions the deeds He will perform in the hereafter in 
such a way as to draw attention to their worldly parallels, so that no room should be left 
for doubt and denial. Examples are the Suras introduced by these verses: 

When the sun is rolled up,66 
When the heavens are torn asunder.67 

In  these  Suras,  God  Almighty  mentions  resurrection  and  the  vast  revolutions  and 
dominical  deeds  that  shall  take  place  at  that time,  in  such  a  fashion  that  man  thinks  of 
their worldly parallels that he  has seen  in autumn and spring, and then, with awe  in  his 
heart,  easily  accepts  what  the  intellect  would  otherwise  refuse.  Even  to  indicate  the 
general meaning of the three suras just mentioned would take very long. Let us, then, take 
simply one word as a specimen of the whole. With the words, 

When the pages are spread out,68 

God Almighty expresses the following: “Upon resurrection, everyone’s deeds will be 
revealed on a written page. This appears to be very strange, and totally beyond the reach 
of reason. But as the Sura indicates, just as the resurrection of the spring is a parallel to 
other  matters, so too the  ‘spreading out of pages’ has a  very  clear parallel. Every  fruit-
bearing  tree,  every  flowering  plant  has  its  deeds,  actions  and  functions.  It  performs  a 
certain kind of worship, depending on the  fashion  in  which  it glorifies God through the 
manifestations of His Names. Now all of its deeds and the record of its life are inscribed 
in all the seeds that are to emerge next spring in another plot of soil. With the tongue of 
shape  and  form,  the  seeds  make  eloquent  mention  of  the  origins  of  those  deeds,  and 
spread out the page of deeds together with branch, twig,  leaf,  flower and  fruit. He Who 
says: “When the pages are spread out” is the same Being That performs, before our eyes, 
these wise, preserving, nurturing and subtle acts. 

Compare  other  matters  with  this  by  analogy,  and  deduce  the  truth  if  you  have  the 
capacity. Let us aid you with the following. The verse, When the sun is folded up, refers 
to a brilliant similitude and hints at its parallel: 

First:  God Almighty has cast aside the curtains of non-being, the ether  

                                                

65 Qur’an, 10:56. 
66 Qur’an, 81:1. 
67 Qur’an, 82:1. 
68 Qur’an, 81:10. 

 

130 

and the heavens to bring forth from His treasury of mercy and show to the world a jewel-
like  lamp  illumining  the  world  —  the  sun.  After  closing  the  world,  He  will  wrap  that 
jewel again in His veils and remove it. 

Second:  The sun may be depicted as an official entrusted with the task of distributing 
the commodity of light over the globe, and causing it and darkness to succeed each other. 
Every evening the official is ordered to gather up the light. It may sometimes happen also 
that his trade may be slackened when he is hidden by the veil of a cloud. At other times it 
may be that the moon will also form a veil, and hinder his task. Now just as that official 
has his goods and ledgers gathered up for inspection, so too he will one day be relieved of 
his duties. Even if there be no cause for his dismissal, there are two dark spots on the sun 
—now small,  but  liable to grow— that one day  will grow to the point that the sun  will 
take back, by dominical command, the  light  it now wraps around the head of the  earth, 
and wrap it around its own head. It will then be told: “Come, your task on earth is now 
complete. Go to Hell, and  burn there those who have worshipped  you and thus  mocked 
with  faithlessness  an  obedient  servant  like  you.”  With  its  own  dark  and  scarred  face,  it 
will read out the decree, “When the sun is rolled up.”

Fifth Part 
of the Addendum 

The  hundred  and  twenty-four  thousand  prophets,69  who  are  according  to  explicit 
prophetic  tradition  the  choice  part of  humanity,  have  unanimously  and  with  one  accord 
reported, partly on the basis of direct vision and partly on the basis of absolute certainty, 
that the hereafter exists and that all beings will be taken to the hereafter as the Creator has 
firmly promised. 

Similarly, the one hundred and twenty-four million saints who confirm the reports of 
the  prophets  through  unveiling  and  witnessing,  give  testimony  to  the  existence  of  the 
hereafter in the form of certain knowledge, and also bear testimony to the existence of the 
hereafter.  All  the  Names  of  the  All-Wise  Maker  of  the  cosmos  also  necessitate  the 
existence of an eternal realm through the manifestations they display in this world. 

The  existence  of  the  hereafter  is  furthermore  necessitated  by  the  infinite  eternal 
power,  the  unlimited  and  exact  everlasting  wisdom,  that  revives  every  spring  the 
countless  dead  trees  scattered  all  over  the  earth  with  the  command  of  “Be!”,  and  it  is, 
thus making of them manifestations of “resurrection after death,” and that resurrects three 
hundred thousand different species of the various groups of plant and nations of animals, 
as hundreds of thousands of specimens of the supreme resurrection. 

The existence of the hereafter is also necessitated by an eternal mercy and permanent 
grace  that  sustains  in  wondrous  and  solicitous  fashion  all  animate  beings  that  stand  in 
need of nurture, and that display each spring, in the briefest of periods, infinite different 
varieties of adornment and beauty. Finally, there is the self-evident proof and indication 
given  by  the  intense,  unshakeable,  and  permanent  love  of  eternity,  yearning  for 
immortality and hope of permanence that are lodged in man, the most beloved creation of 
the  Maker  of  the  cosmos,  and  whose  concern  with  all  the  beings  in  the  cosmos  is  the 
greatest. 

                                                

al-Arnawut), i, 43-4. 

69 Musnad, v, 266; Tabrizi, Mishkat al-Masabih, iii, 122; Ibn Qayyim al-Jawzi, Zad al-Ma’ad (Tahqiq: 

 

132 

All  of  the  foregoing  so  firmly  prove  that  after  this  transient  world  there  will  be  an 
eternal  world,  a  hereafter,  a  realm  of  felicity,  that  we  are  compelled  to  accept  the 
existence of a hereafter as indisputably as we accept the existence of this world.70 

One of the most important lessons taught us by the All-Wise Qur’an, is, then, belief in 
the hereafter. This  belief  is so  firm and  contains  within  itself  so powerful a  hope and  a 
consolation that if a person be assailed by old age hundred thousandfold, the consolation 
derived from this belief will be fully enough. Saying, “Praise be to God for the perfection 
of belief,” we old people should rejoice in old age. 

                                                

70 It can be realized from this comparison how easy it is to make a positive affirmation and how 
difficult to make a denial and negation. If, for example, someone should say, “there exists somewhere on 
this earth a wondrous garden containing canned milk,” and someone else should say, “there is not,” the 
affirmer need only point to the place of that garden or show some of its fruits in order to prove his claim. 
The denier, by contrast, will have to inspect and display the whole world in order to justify his negation. So 
too the testimony of two veracious witnesses will be enough to establish the existence of Paradise, quite 
apart from the hundreds of thousands of traces, fruits and indications demonstrated by those who assert its 
existence. Those who deny it must examine, explore and sift the infinite cosmos and infinite time before 
they can prove their denial and demonstrate the non-existence of Paradise. So, o aged brothers of mine, 
understand how firm is belief in the hereafter.

The Eleventh Word 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
By the sun and its glorious splendour; * By the moon as it follows it; * By the 
day  as  it  shows  [the  sun’s]  glory;  *  By  the  night  as  it  conceals  it;  *  By  the 
firmament and its wonderful structure; * By the earth and its wide expanse; * By 
the soul and the order and proportion given it.1 

Brother!  If you want to understand a little about the talisman of the wisdom of the 
world  and  the  riddle  of  man’s  creation  and  the  mystery  of  the  reality  of  the  prescribed 
prayers, then consider this short comparison together with my own soul. 

One  time  there  was  a  king.  As  wealth  he  had  numerous  treasuries  containing 
diamonds  and  emeralds  and  jewels  of  every  kind.  Besides  these  he  had  other,  hidden, 
wondrous treasuries. By way of attainment he had consummate skill in strange arts, and 
encompassing  knowledge  of  innumerable  wondrous  sciences,  and  great  erudition  in 
endless branches of abstruse learning. Now, like every possessor of beauty and perfection 
wants to see and display his own beauty and perfection, that glorious king wanted to open 
up an exhibition and set out displays within  it  in  order to make  manifest and display  in 
the view of the people the majesty of his rule, his glittering wealth, the wonders of his art, 
and the marvels of his knowledge, and so that he could behold his beauty and perfection 
in two respects: 

The First Respect: so that he himself could behold them with his own discerning eye. 
The Other: so that he could look through the view of others. 
With this purpose  in  mind, the king  started to construct a vast and  majestic palace. 
He divided it into magnificent apartments and dwellings, and decorated it with every sort 
of jewel from his treasuries, and with his own hand so full of art adorned it with the finest 
and most beautiful works. He ordered it with the subtlest of the arts of his wisdom, and 
decked  it out with the  miraculous works of  his knowledge. Then after completing  it, he 
set up in the palace broad tables containing the most delicious of every kind of food  

                                                
1 Qur’an, 91:1-7. 

 

134 

and  every  sort  of  bounty.  He  specified  an  appropriate  table  for  each  group.  He  set  out 
such  a  munificent  and  artful  banquet  that  it  was  as  though  the  boundless  priceless 
bounties  he  spread  out  had  come  into  existence  through  the  works  of  a  hundred  subtle 
arts. Then he invited his people and subjects from all the regions of his lands to feast and 
behold the spectacle. 

Later the king appointed a Supreme Commander (PBUH) as teacher, to make known 
the purposes of the palace and the meanings of its contents; to describe its Maker and its 
contents  to  the  people,  make  known  the  secrets  of  the  palace’s  embellishments,  teach 
what the arts within it were pointing to, and to explain what the well-set jewels were, and 
the harmonious embroideries; and to explain to those who entered the palace the way in 
which they indicated the perfections and arts of the palace’s owner, and to inform them of 
the correct conduct in beholding them, and to explain the official ceremonies as the king, 
who  did  not  appear,  wished  them  to  be.  The  teacher  and  instructor  had  an  assistant  in 
each  area  of  the  palace,  while  he  himself  remained  in  the  largest  apartment  among  his 
students, making the following announcement to all the spectators. He told them: 

“O  people!  By  making  this  palace  and  displaying  these  things  our  lord,  who  is  the 
king of the palace, wants to make himself known to you. You therefore should recognize 
Him and try to get to know Him. And with these adornments He wants to make Himself 
loved  by  you.  Also, He shows His  love  for  you through these  bounties that  you see, so 
you  should  love  Him too by obeying Him.  And through these  bounties and gifts which 
are to be seen He shows His compassion and kindness for you, so you should show your 
respect for Him by offering thanks. And through these works of His perfection He wants 
to display His transcendent beauty to you, so you should show your eagerness to see Him 
and  gain  His  regard.  And  through  placing  a  particular  stamp  and  special  seal  and  an 
inimitable  signet on  every  one  of  these  adorned  works of  art that  you  see,  He  wants  to 
show that everything is particular to Him, and is the work of His own hand, and that He is 
single and unique and independent and removed. You therefore should recognize that He 
is  single  and  alone,  and  without  peer or  like  or match,  and  accept that  He  is  such.”  He 
spoke  further  fitting  words  to  the  spectators  like  these  concerning  the  King  and  this 
station. Then the people who had entered the palace separated into two groups. 

The First Group: Since these people had self-knowledge, were intelligent, and their 
hearts  were  in  the  right  place,  when  they  looked  at the  wonders  inside  the  palace,  they 
declared: “There are great matters afoot here!” They understood that it was not in vain or 
some  trifling  plaything.  They  were  curious,  and  while  wondering:  “I  wonder  what  the 
talisman to this is and what it contains,” they suddenly heard the speech the Master and 
Instructor was giving, and they realized that the keys to all the mysteries were with  

 

135 

him.  So  they  approached  him  and  said:  “Peace  be  upon  you,  O  Master!  By  rights,  a 
truthful and exact instructor like  you  is  necessary  for a magnificent palace such as this. 
Please tell us what our Lord has made known to you!” First of all the Master repeated the 
speech to them. They listened carefully, and accepting it, profited greatly. They acted as 
the  King  wished.  And  because  the  King  was  pleased  at  their  becoming  conduct  and 
manners, he invited them to another special, elevated, ineffable palace. And he bestowed 
it  on  them  in  a  way  worthy  of  such  a  munificent  king,  and  fitting  for  such  obedient 
subjects, and suitable for such well-mannered guests, and appropriate to such an elevated 
palace. He made them permanently happy. 

As  for  the  Second  Group,  because  their  minds  were  corrupted  and  their  hearts 
extinguished, when they entered the palace, they were defeated by their evil-commanding 
souls and took notice of nothing apart from the delicious foods; they closed their eyes to 
all  the  virtues  and  stopped  up their  ears  to the  guidance  of  the  Master  (PBUH)  and  the 
warnings of his students. They stuffed themselves like animals then sank into sleep. They 
quaffed  elixirs  which  had  been  prepared  for  certain  other  matters  and  were  not to  have 
been consumed. Then they became drunk and started shouting so much they greatly upset 
the other spectating guests. They were ill-mannered in the face of the Glorious Maker’s 
rules.  So  the  soldiers  of  the  palace’s  owner  arrested  them,  and  cast  them  into  a  prison 
appropriate to such unmannerly people. 

O friend who is listening to this story with me! Of course you have understood that 
the Glorious Creator built this palace for the above-mentioned aims. The achievement of 
these aims is dependent on two things: 

The First: The existence of the Master (PBUH) whom we saw and whose speech we 
heard.  Because  if  not  for  him,  all  the  aims  would  have  been  futile.  For  an 
incomprehensible book with no author consists only of meaningless paper. 

The Second is the people listening the Master’s words and accepting them. That is to 
say,  the  Master’s  existence  is  the  cause  of  the  palace’s  existence,  and  the  people’s 
listening to him is the cause of the continuation of the palace’s existence. In which case, 
it may be said that if it had not been for the Master (PBUH), the Glorious King would not 
have  built  the  palace.  And  again  it  may  be  said  that  when  the  people  do  not  heed  the 
Master’s (PBUH) instructions, the palace will of a certainty be transformed and changed. 
Friend! The story ends here. If you have understood the meaning of the comparison, 

come and behold its reality. 

The palace is this world. Its roof is the heavens illuminated with smiling stars, and its 
floor, the face of the earth adorned from east to west with multifarious flowers. As for the 
King,  he  is  the  Most  Holy  One,  the  Pre-Eternal  and  Post-Eternal  Monarch,  Whom  all 
things in the seven heavens and the  

 

136 

earth  glorify  and  extol,  each  with  its  particular  tongue.  He  is  a  king  so  powerful  He 
created the heavens and earth in six days, then abided on the Throne. One of Power and 
Majesty, Who, alternating night and day like two threads, one white and one black, writes 
His signs of the page of the universe; One to Whose command the sun, moon, and stars 
are  subjugated.  The  apartments of  the  palace  are  the  eighteen  thousand  worlds,  each  of 
which has been set in order and decorated in a fashion suitable to it. The strange arts you 
saw in the palace are the miracles of Divine power you see in this world, and the foods 
you saw there allude to the wonderful fruits of Divine mercy in this world, especially in 
summer, and above all  in the gardens of Barla. The  stove and kitchen there  is the earth 
here, which has fire in its heart, and the face of the earth. While the jewels of the hidden 
treasuries  you  saw  in  the  comparison  are  the  similitudes  of  the  manifestations  of  the 
sacred Divine Names. And the embroideries there, and the signs of the embroideries, are 
the  well-ordered  and  finely  worked  beings  and  the  harmonious  impresses  of  the  pen  of 
power which adorn this world and point to the Names of the All-Powerful One of Glory.  
As for the Master, he is our Master Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him). 
His  assistants  are  the  prophets  (Peace  be  upon  them),  and  his  students,  the  saints  and 
purified  scholars.  The  ruler’s  servants  in  the  palace  indicate  the  angels  (Peace  be  upon 
them) in this world. And the guests invited to the banquet to spectate in the comparison 
are the jinn and mankind in this guest-house of the world, and the animals, who are the 
servants of  mankind.  As  for the two groups, one of them  here consists of the people of 
belief, who are the students of the All-Wise Qur’an, the interpreter of the verses and signs 
of  the  book  of  the  universe.  The  other  group  consists  of  the  people  of  unbelief  and 
rebellion,  who  follow  Satan  and  their  evil-commanding  souls;  deaf  and  dumb,  like 
animals, or even lower, they form the group of the misguided, who recognize the life of 
this world only. 

FIRST GROUP: These are the felicitous and the good, who listened to the Master, 
‘the Possessor of Two Wings.’ He  is  both the worshipping servant of God;  in regard to 
worship  he describes  his Sustainer so that he  is  like the envoy of  his community  at the 
Court of  Almighty  God. He  is also God’s Messenger; with regard to Messengership  he 
conveys his Sustainer’s decrees to men and the jinn by means of the Qur’an. 

This happy community heeded the Messenger and listened to the Qur’an. They saw 
themselves  invested with the prescribed prayers, which are the  index of all the varieties 
of  worship,  and  numerous  subtle  duties  within  elevated  stations.  Indeed,  they  saw  in 
detail the duties and stations which the prayers point to with their  various  formulas and 
actions. It was like this: 

Firstly: Since they observed the Divine works, and in the form of a transaction in the 

absence of the person concerned, saw themselves in the station  

 

137 

of observing the wonders of the sovereignty of dominicality, they performed the duty of 
extolling and glorifying God, declaring: “God is Most Great!” 

Secondly: Through being seen in the station of herald of His brilliant and wonderful 
works, which are the manifestations of the sacred Divine Names, exclaiming: “Glory be 
to God!  All Praise be to God!”, they performed the duty of hallowing and praising God. 

Thirdly:  In  the  station  of  perceiving  and  understanding  with  their  inner  and  outer 
senses the bounties stored up in the treasuries of Divine mercy, they started to carry out 
the duty of thanks and praise. 

Fourthly: In the station of weighing up with the scales of their spiritual faculties the 
jewels in the treasuries of the Divine Names, they began the duty of praise and declaring 
God to be free of all fault. 

Fifthly:  In the  station  of  studying  the  Sustainer’s  missives,  written  with  the  pen  of 
power  on  the  plan  of  Divine  Determining,  they  began  the  duty  of  contemplation  and 
appreciation. 

Sixthly:  With  beholding  the  subtle,  delicate,  fine  beauties  in  the  creation  of  things 
and in the art in beings, in the station of declaring God to be free of all defect, they took 
up  the  duty  of  love  and  yearning  for  their  All-Glorious  Creator,  their  All-Beauteous 
Maker. That is to say, after looking at the universe and works and performing the duties 
in the above-mentioned stations through transactions in the object of worship’s absence, 
they rose to the degree of also beholding the transactions and acts of the All-Wise Maker, 
whereby,  in  the  form  of  a  transaction  in  the  presence  of  the  person  concerned,  they 
responded with knowledge and wonder in the face of the All-Glorious Creator’s making 
Himself known to conscious beings through the miracles of His art, and declared: “Glory 
be unto You! How can we truly know you? What makes You known are the miracles of 
the works of Your art!” 

Then,  they  responded  with  love  and  passion  to  that  Most  Merciful  One’s  making 
Himself loved through the beautiful fruits of His mercy. “You alone do we worship and 
from You alone do we seek help!”, they declared. 

Then  they  responded  with  thanks  and  praise  to  the  True  Bestower’s  showing  His 
mercy and compassion through His sweet bounties, and exclaimed: “Glory be unto You! 
All praise  is Yours! How can we thank  You as  is Your due? You are utterly worthy of 
thanks!  For  all  Your  bounties  spread  through  all  the  universe  hymn  Your  praises  and 
thanks through the clear tongues of their beings. All Your bounties lined up in the market 
of the world and scattered over the face of the earth proclaim Your praises and extol You. 
Through  testifying  to  Your  munificence  and  generosity,  all  the  well-ordered  and  well-
proportioned fruits of Your mercy and bounty offer You thanks before the gazes of Your 
creatures.” 

 

138 

Then  they  responded,  saying:  “God  is  Most  Great!”  before  the  manifestation  of 
Divine beauty, glory, perfection, and majesty in the mirrors of beings, ever changing on 
the  face  of  the  universe;  they  bowed  reverently  in  their  impotence,  and  prostrated  in 
humility with love and wonder. 

Then  announcing  their  poverty  and  need,  they  responded  with  supplication  and 
beseeching to the Possessor of Absolute Riches’ displaying the abundance of His wealth 
and breadth of His mercy, and declared: “From You alone do we seek help!” 

Then  they  responded  appreciatively  to  the  All-Glorious  Maker’s  displaying  the 
subtleties  and  wonders  of  His  antique  art  in  the  exhibition  of  creatures,  exclaiming: 
“What wonders God has willed!” Observing and applauding them, they declared, “How 
beautifully they have been made! What blessings God has bestowed!” Holding everyone 
witness,  they  said  in  wonder:  “Come!  Look  at  these!  Hasten  to  the  prayers  and  to 
prosperity!” 

And they responded with submission and obedience to the Monarch of Pre-Eternity 
and Post-Eternity’s proclamation of the  sovereignty of  His dominicality  in  every  corner 
of the universe and the manifestation of His unity. Declaring: “We hear  and we obey!”, 
they affirmed His unity. 

Then, before the  manifestation of the Godhead of that Sustainer of  All the  Worlds, 
they responded with worship and humble veneration, which consists of proclaiming their 
poverty within need, and with the prescribed prayers, which are the summary of worship. 
Thus, through performing their various duties of worship in the mighty mosque known as 
the  abode  of  this  world,  they  carried  out  the  obligations  and  duties  of  their  lives,  and 
assumed  ‘the  finest  of  forms.’  They  ascended  to  a  rank  above  all  creatures  by  which, 
through  the  auspiciousness  of  belief  and  assurance  and  ‘the  Trust,’  they  became 
trustworthy  Vicegerents  of  God  on  the  Earth.  And  after  this  field  of  trial  and  place  of 
examination, their Munificent Sustainer invited them to eternal happiness in recompense 
for their belief, and to the Abode of Peace in reward for their adhering to His religion of 
Islam. There, He bestowed on them out of His mercy bounties so dazzling that no eye has 
seen them, nor ear heard them, nor have they occurred to the heart of man2 – and so He 
does  bestow  these  on  them,  and  He  gave  them  eternity  and  everlasting  life.  For  the 
desirous,  mirror-bearing  lovers  of  an  eternal,  abiding  beauty  who  gaze  upon  it  will 
certainly  not  perish,  but  will  go  to  eternity.  The  final  state  of  the  Qur’an’s  students  is 
thus. May Almighty God include us among them, Amen! 

As for the other group, the sinners and the wicked, when they entered the palace of 

this world at the age of discretion, they responded with unbelief to  

                                                
2 See page 88, footnote 22. 

 

139 

all  the  evidences  of  Divine  unity,  and  with  ingratitude  towards  all  the  bounties,  and  by 
accusing  all  creatures  of  being  valueless,  insulted  them  in  an  unbelieving  manner.  And 
since  they  rejected  and  denied  all  the  manifestations  of  the  Divine  Names,  they 
committed  a  boundless  crime  in  a  short  time  and  became  deserving  of  endless 
punishment.  For  the  capital  of  life  and  man’s  faculties  were  given  him  for  the  duties 
mentioned above. 

O my senseless soul and foolish friend! Do you suppose your life’s duty is restricted 
to  following  the  good  life  according  to  the  requisites  of  civilization,  and,  if  you  will 
excuse the expression, to gratifying the physical appetites? Do you suppose the sole aim 
of  the  delicate  and  subtle  senses,  the  sensitive  faculties  and  members,  the  well-ordered 
limbs  and  systems,  the  inquisitive  feelings  and  senses  included  in  the  machine  of  your 
life  is  restricted  to  satisfying  the  low  desires  of  the  base  soul  in  this  fleeting  life?  God 
forbid! There are two main aims in their creation and inclusion in your essential being: 

The First consists of  making known to you all the varieties of the True Bestower’s 
bounties,  and  causing  you  to offer  Him  thanks.  You  should  be  aware  of  this,  and  offer 
Him thanks and worship. 

The Second is to make known to you by means of your faculties all the sorts of the 
manifestations of the sacred Divine Names  manifested in the world and to cause  you to 
experience them. And you, by recognizing them through experiencing them, should come 
to believe in them. 

Thus,  man  develops  and  is  perfected  through  the  achievement  of  these  two  basic 

aims. Through them, man becomes a true human being. 

Look  through  the  meaning  of  the  following  comparison,  and  see  that  the  human 

faculties were not given in order to gain worldly life like an animal. 

For  example,  someone  gave  one  of  his  servants  twenty  gold  pieces,  telling  him  to 
have a suit of clothes made out of a particular cloth. The servant went and got himself a 
fine  suit  out  of  the  highest  grade  of  the  cloth,  and  put  it  on.  Then  he  saw  that  his 
employer  had  given  another  of  his  servants  a  thousand  gold  pieces,  and  putting  in  the 
servant’s pocket a piece of paper with some things written on it, had sent him to conclude 
some  business.  Now,  anyone  with  any  sense  would  know  that  the  capital  was  not  for 
getting a  suit of clothes,  for, since the  first servant had  bought a suit of the  finest cloth 
with twenty gold pieces, the thousand gold pieces were certainly not to be spent on that. 
Since  the  second  servant  had  not  read  the  paper  in  his  pocket,  and  looking  at  the  first 
servant, had given all the money to a shopkeeper for a suit of clothes, and then received 
the very lowest grade of cloth and a suit fifty times worse that his friend’s, his employer 
was bound to reprimand him severely for his utter stupidity, and punish him angrily. 
O my soul and my friend! Come to your senses! Do not spend the capital  

 

140 

and  potentialities  of  your  life  on  pleasures  of  the  flesh  and  this  fleeting  life  like  an 
animal,  or  even  lower.  Otherwise,  although  you  are  fifty  times  superior  with  regard  to 
capital than the highest animal, you will fall fifty times lower than the lowest. 

O my heedless soul! If you want to understand to a degree both the aim of your life 
and its nature, and the form of your life, and the true meaning of your life, and its perfect 
happiness, then look! The summary of the aims of your life consists of nine matters: 

The  First  is  this:  To  weigh  up  on  the  scales  of  the  senses  put  in  your  being  the 

bounties stored up in the treasuries of Divine mercy, and to offer universal thanks. 

The Second:  To open with the keys of the faculties placed in your nature the hidden 

treasuries of the sacred Divine Names. 

The Third:  To consciously display and make known through your life in the view of 
the creatures in this exhibition of the world the wondrous arts and subtle manifestations 
which the Divine Names have attached to you. 

The Fourth:  To proclaim  your worship to the Court of the  Creator’s dominicality 

verbally and through the tongue of your disposition. 

The Fifth:  Like on ceremonial occasions a soldier wears all the decorations he has 
received from his king, and through appearing before the him, displays the marks of his 
favour  towards  him,  this  is  to  consciously  adorn  yourself  in  the  jewels  of  the  subtle 
senses which the  manifestations of the Divine Names  have given  you, and to appear  in 
the observant view of the Pre-Eternal Witness. 

The Sixth:  To consciously observe the salutations of living beings to their Creator, 
known as the manifestations of life, and their glorifications of their Maker, known as the 
signs of life, and their worship of the Bestower of Life, known as the aims of life, and by 
reflecting on them to see them, and through testifying to them to display them. 

The  Seventh:    Through  taking  as  units  of  measurement  the  small  samples  of 
attributes  like  the  partial  knowledge,  power,  and  will  given  to  your  life,  it  is  to  know 
through  those  measures  the  absolute  attributes  and  sacred  qualities  of  the  All-Glorious 
Creator. For example, since, through your partial power, knowledge, and will, you have 
made your house in well-ordered fashion, you should know that the Maker of the palace 
of the world is its Disposer, and Powerful, Knowing, and Wise to the degree it is greater 
than your house. 

The Eighth:  To understand the words concerning the Creator’s unity and Maker’s 

dominicality uttered by each of the beings in the world in its particular tongue. 

 

141 

The Ninth:  To understand through your impotence and weakness, your poverty and 
need,  the  degrees  of  the  Divine  power  and  dominical  riches.  Just  as  the  pleasure  and 
degrees and varieties of food are understood through the degrees of hunger and the sorts 
of  need,  so  you  should  understand  the  degrees  of  the  infinite  Divine  power  and  riches 
through  your  infinite  impotence  and  poverty.  The  aims  of  your  life,  then,  briefly,  are 
matters like these. Now consider the nature of your life; its summary is this: 

It is an index of wonders pertaining to the Divine Names; a scale for measuring the 
Divine attributes; a balance of the worlds within the universe; a list of the mighty world; 
a map of the cosmos; a summary of the vast book of the universe; a bunch of keys with 
which to open the hidden treasuries of Divine power; and a most excellent pattern of the 
perfections scattered over beings and attached to time. The nature of your life consists of 
matters like these. 

Now, the form of your life and the manner of its duty is this: your life is an inscribed 
word, a wisdom-displaying word written by the pen of power. Seen and heard, it points to 
the Divine Names. The form of your life consists of matters like these.  

Now the true meaning of your life is this: its acting as a mirror to the manifestation 
of Divine oneness  and the  manifestation of the Eternally  Besought One. That  is to say, 
through a comprehensiveness as though being the point of focus for all the Divine Names 
manifested in the world, it is its being a mirror to the Single and Eternally Besought One.  
Now, as for the perfection of your life, it is to perceive the lights of the Pre-Eternal 
Sun which are depicted in the mirror of your life, and to love them. It is to display ardour 
for  Him  as  a  conscious  being.  It  is  to  pass  beyond  yourself  with  love  of  Him.  It  is  to 
establish the reflection of His  light  in the  centre of  your  heart. It is due to this  mystery 
that  the  Hadith  Qudsi  was  uttered,  which  is  expressed  by  the  following  lines,  and  will 
raise you to the highest of the high: 

The heavens and the earth contain me not; 
Yet, how strange! I am contained in the hearts of believers.3 

And  so,  my  soul!  Since  your  life  is  turned  towards  such  elevated  aims  and  gathers 
together such priceless treasuries, is it at all worthy of reason and fairness that you should 
spend it on temporary gratification of the instinctual soul and fleeting worldly pleasures, 
and  waste  it? If  you do  not want to fritter away  your  life, ponder over the oaths  in this 
Sura of the Qur’an, which allude to the above comparison and truths, and act accordingly: 

By the sun and its [glorious] splendour; * By the moon as it  

                                                
3 See, al-‘Ajluni, Kashf al-Khafa’, ii, 165; al-Ghazzali, Ihya’ l-‘Ulum al-Din, iii, 14. 

 

142 

follows  it;  *  By  the  day  as  it  shows  up  [the  sun’s]  glory;  *  By  the  night  as  it 
conceals it; * By the firmament and its [wonderful] structure; * By the earth and 
its [wide] expanse; * By the soul and the order and proportion given it; * And 
its enlightenment to its wrong and its right. * Truly he succeeds that purifies it, * 
And he fails that corrupts it.4 

O God, grant blessings and peace to the Sun of the Skies of Messengership, the 
Moon of the Constellation of Prophethood, and to his Family and Companions, 
the  stars  of  guidance,  and  grant  mercy  to  us  and  to  all  believing  men  and  all 
believing women. Amen. Amen. Amen. 

                                                
4 Qur’an, 91:1-10. 

 

143 

The Twelfth Word 

[This  Word  consists  of  a  brief  comparison  between  the  sacred  wisdom  of  the 
All-Wise  Qur’an  and  the  wisdom  of  philosophy  and  science,  and  a  concise 
summary of the instruction and training which Qur’anic wisdom gives to man in 
his personal life and social life, and an indication of the Qur’an’s superiority to 
other Divine words, and to all speech. There are Four Principles in this Word.] 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
And he who has been given wisdom has been given great good.1 

FIRST PRINCIPLE 

Look  through  the  telescope  of  the  following  story  which  is  in  the  form  of  a 
comparison,  and  see  the  differences  between  Qur’anic  wisdom  and  that  of  philosophy 
and science: 

One time, a renowned Ruler who was both religious and a fine craftsman wanted to 
write  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  in  a  script  worthy  of  the  sacredness  in  its  meaning  and  the 
miraculousness  in  its  words,  so  that  its  marvel-displaying  stature  would  be  arrayed  in 
wondrous  apparel.  The  artist-King  therefore  wrote  the  Qur’an  in  a  truly  wonderful 
fashion.  He  used  all  his  precious  jewels  in  its  writing.  In  order  to  indicate  the  great 
variety of its truths, he wrote some of its embodied letters in diamonds and emeralds, and 
some in rubies and agate, and other sorts in brilliants and coral, while others he inscribed 
with silver and gold. He adorned and decorated it in such a way that everyone, those who 
knew how to read and those who did not, were full of admiration and astonishment when 
they beheld it. Especially in the view of the people of truth, since the outer beauty was an 
indication of the brilliant beauty and striking adornment in its meaning, it became a truly 
precious antique. 

                                                
1 Qur’an, 2:269. 

 

144 

Then the Ruler showed the artistically wrought and bejewelled Qur’an to a European 
philosopher and to a Muslim scholar. In order to test them and for reward, he commanded 
them:  “Each  of  you  write  a  work  about  the  wisdom  and  purposes  of  this!”  First  the 
philosopher, then the scholar composed a book about it. However, the philosopher’s book 
discussed  only  the  decorations  of  the  letters  and  their  relationships  and  conditions,  and 
the properties of the jewels, and described them. It did not touch on their meaning at all, 
for the European had no knowledge of the Arabic script. He did not even know that the 
embellished Qur’an was a book, a written piece, expressing a meaning. He rather looked 
on  it  as  an  ornamented  antique.  He  did  not  know  any  Arabic,  but  he  was  a  very  good 
engineer,  and  he  described  things  very  aptly,  and  he  was  a  skilful  chemist,  and  an 
ingenious jeweller. So this man wrote his work according to those crafts. 

As for the Muslim scholar, when he looked at the Qur’an, he understood that it was 
the  Perspicuous  Book,  the  All-Wise  Qur’an.  This  truth-loving  person  neither  attached 
importance  to the  external  adornments,  nor  busied  himself  with  the  ornamented  letters. 
He became preoccupied with something that was a million times higher, more elevated, 
more subtle, more noble, more beneficial, and more comprehensive than the matters with 
which the other man had busied himself. For discussing the sacred truths and lights of the 
mysteries beneath the veil of the decorations, he wrote a truly fine commentary. Then the 
two of them took their works and presented them to the Illustrious Ruler. The Ruler first 
took  the  philosopher’s  work.  He  looked  at  it  and  saw  that  the  self-centred  and  nature-
worshipping man had worked very hard, but had written nothing of true wisdom. He had 
understood  nothing  of  its  meaning.  Indeed,  he  had  confused  it  and  been  disrespectful 
towards it, and ill-mannered even. For supposing that source of truths, the Qur’an, to be 
meaningless decoration, he had insulted it as being valueless in regard to meaning. So the 
Wise Ruler hit him over the head with his work and expelled him from his presence. 

Then  he  looked  at  the  work  of  the  other,  the  truth-loving,  scrupulous  scholar,  and 
saw that  it was an extremely  fine and  beneficial  commentary, a  most wise composition 
full of guidance. “Congratulations! May God bless  you!”, he said. Thus, wisdom  is this 
and they call those who possess it knowledgeable and wise. As for the other man, he was 
a  craftsman  who  had  exceeded  his  mark.  Then  in  reward  for  the  scholar’s  work,  he 
commanded  that  in  return  for  each  letter ten  gold  pieces  should  be  given  him  from  his 
inexhaustible treasury. 

If you have understood the comparison, now look and see the reality: 
The  ornamented  Qur’an  is  this  artistically  fashioned  universe,  and  the  Ruler  is  the 
Pre-Eternal  All-Wise  One.  As  for  the  two  men,  one  –the  European–  represents 
philosophy and its philosophers, and the other, the Qur’an  

 

145 

and its students. Yes, the All-Wise Qur’an is a most elevated expounder, a most eloquent 
translator of the Mighty Qur’an of the Universe.  Yes,  it  is the Criterion which  instructs 
man and the  jinn concerning the signs of creation  inscribed  by the pen of power on the 
pages  of  the  universe  and  on  the  leaves  of  time.  It  regards  beings,  each  of  which  is  a 
meaningful letter, as bearing the meaning of another, that is, it looks at them on account 
of  their  Maker.  It  says,  “How  beautifully  they  have  been  made!  How  exquisitely  they 
point  to  their  Maker’s  beauty!”,  thus  showing  the  universe’s  true  beauty.  But  the 
philosophy they call natural philosophy or science has plunged into the decorations of the 
letters of beings and into their relationships, and has become bewildered; it has confused 
the way of reality. While the  letters of this  mighty  book should  be  looked at as bearing 
the  meaning  of  another, that  is,  on  account of  God, they  have  not  done  this;  they  have 
looked at beings as signifying themselves. That is, they have looked at beings on account 
of beings, and have discussed them in that way. Instead of saying, “How beautifully they 
have been made,” they say “How beautiful they are,” and have made them ugly. In doing 
this  they  have  insulted  the  universe,  and  made  it  complain  about  them.  Indeed, 
philosophy  without  religion  is  a  sophistry  divorced  from  reality  and  an  insult  to  the 
universe. 

SECOND PRINCIPLE 

A comparison between the moral training the wisdom of the All-Wise Qur’an gives 

to personal life and what philosophy and science teach: 

The sincere student of philosophy is a pharaoh, but he is a contemptible pharaoh who 
worships the basest thing for the sake of benefit; he recognizes everything from which he 
can profit as his ‘Lord’. And that irreligious student is obstinate and refractory, but he is 
wretched together with his obstinacy and accepts endless abasement for the sake of one 
pleasure.  And  he  is  abject  together  with  his  recalcitrance  and  shows  his  abasement  by 
kissing  the  feet  of  satanic  individuals  for  the  sake  of  some  base  benefit.  And  that 
irreligious student is conceited and domineering, but since he can find no point of support 
in his heart, he is an utterly impotent blustering tyrant. And that student is a self-centered 
seeker  of  benefit  whose  aim  and  endeavour  is  to  gratify  his  animal  appetites;  a  crafty 
egotist who seeks his personal interests within certain nationalist interests. 

However, the sincere student of Qur’anic wisdom is a servant, but he does not stoop 
to  worship  even  the  greatest of  creatures;  he  is  an  esteemed  slave  who  does  not take  a 
supreme benefit like Paradise as the aim of his worship. And its student is humble; he is 
righteous and mild, yet outside the limits of his Maker’s leave, he would not voluntarily 
lower  and  abase  himself  before  anything  other  than  his  Maker.  And  he  is  weak  and  in 
want, and he knows his weakness and poverty, but he is self-sufficient due to the  

 

146 

wealth  which  his  All-Generous  Lord  has  stored  up  for  him  in  the  hereafter,  and  he  is 
strong  since  he  relies  on  his  Master’s  infinite  power.  And  he  acts  and  strives  only  for 
God’s sake, for God’s pleasure, and for virtue.  

Thus, the training the two give  may  be understood from the comparison of the two 

students. 

THIRD PRINCIPLE 

is this: 

The training philosophy and science and Qur’anic wisdom give to human social life 

Philosophy accepts ‘force’ as its point of support in the life of society. It considers its 
aim  to  be  ‘benefits’.  The  principle  of  its  life  it  recognizes  to  be  ‘conflict’.  It  holds  the 
bond  between  communities  to  be  ‘racialism  and  negative  nationalism’.  Its  fruits  are 
‘gratifying the appetites of the soul and increasing human needs’. However, the mark of 
force is ‘aggression’. The mark of benefit – since they are insufficient for every desire – 
is ‘jostling and tussling’. While the mark of conflict is ‘strife’. And the mark of racialism 
–since it is nourished by devouring others– is ‘aggression’. It is for these reasons that it 
has negated the happiness of mankind. 

As  for the Qur’anic wisdom,  its point of support is  ‘truth’  instead of  force. It takes 
‘virtue  and  God’s  pleasure’  as  its  aims  in  place  of  benefits.  It  takes  the  principle  of 
‘mutual  assistance’  as  the  principle  of  life  in  place  of  the  principle  of  conflict.  And  it 
takes ‘the ties of religion, class, and country’ to be the ties bonding communities. Its aim 
is to form a barrier against the lusts of the soul, urge the spirit to sublime matters, satisfy 
the  high  emotions,  and  urging  man  to  the  human  perfections,  make  him  a  true  human 
being. And the mark of ‘the truth’ is accord. The mark of virtue is ‘solidarity’. The mark 
of  mutual  assistance  is  ‘hastening  to  assist  one  another’.  The  mark  of  religion  is 
‘brotherhood’  and  ‘attraction’.  And  the  mark  of  reining  in  and  tethering  the  soul  and 
leaving the spirit free and urging it towards perfections is ‘happiness in this world and the 
next’. 

FOURTH PRINCIPLE 

If  you  want  to  understand  the  Qur’an’s  superiority  among  all  the  Divine  scriptures 
and  its  supremacy  over  all  speech  and  writings,  then  consider  the  following  two 
comparisons: 

The First: A king has two forms of speech, two forms of address. One is to speak on 
his  private  telephone  with  a  common  subject  concerning  some  minor  matter,  some 
private need. The other, under the title of sublime sovereignty, supreme vicegerent, and 
universal rulership, is to speak with an envoy or high official for the purpose of making 
known and promulgating his commands, to make an utterance through an elevated decree 
proclaiming his majesty. 

 

147 

The Second: One man holds the mirror he is holding up to the sun. He receives light 
containing  the  seven  colours  according  to  the  capacity  of  the  mirror.  He  becomes 
connected  to  the  sun  through  that  relation  and  converses  with  it,  and  if  he  directs  the 
light-filled mirror towards his dark house or his garden covered by a roof, he will benefit, 
not  in  relation  to  the  sun’s  value,  but  in  accordance  with  the  capacity  of  the  mirror. 
Another man, however, opens up broad windows out of his house or out of the roof over 
his garden. He opens up ways to the sun in the sky. He converses with the perpetual light 
of  the  actual  sun  and  speaks  with  it,  and  says  in  gratitude  through  the  tongue  of  his 
disposition:  “O  you  beauty of the world who gilds the  face of the  earth with  your  light 
and  makes  the  faces  of  the  flowers  smile!  O  beauty  of  the  skies,  fine  sun!  You  have 
furnished  my  little  house  and  garden  with  light  and  heat  the  same  as  you  have  them.” 
Whereas  the  man  with  the  mirror  cannot  say  that.  The  reflection  and  works  of  the  sun 
under that restriction are limited; they are in accordance with the restriction. Look at the 
Qur’an  through  the  telescope  of  these  two  comparisons  and  see  its  miraculousness  and 
understand its sacredness. 

The Qur’an says:  “If all the trees on the  land were to become pens and all the seas 
ink, and if they were to write the words of Almighty God, they would never come to the 
end  of  them.”  Now,  the  reason  the  Qur’an  has  been  given  the  highest  rank  among  the 
infinite  words of God is this: the Qur’an  has come  from the Greatest Divine Name and 
from the greatest level of every Name. It is God’s Word in respect of His being Sustainer 
of All the Worlds; it is His decree through His title of God of All Beings; an address in 
regard  to  His  being  Creator  of  the  Heavens  and  the  Earth;  a  conversation  in  regard  to 
absolute dominicality; a pre-eternal address on account of universal Divine sovereignty; a 
note-book  of  the  favours  of  the  Most  Merciful  One  from  the  point  of  view  of  His  all-
embracing,  comprehensive  mercy;  a  collection  of  communications  at  the  beginnings  of 
which are sometimes ciphers related to the sublime majesty of the Godhead; a wisdom-
scattering holy scripture which, descending from the reaches of the Greatest Name, looks 
to  and  inspects  the  all-comprehensive  domain  of  the  Supreme  Throne.  It  is  for  these 
reasons  that  the  title  of  Word  of  God  has  been  given  with  complete  worthiness  to  the 
Qur’an. 

In  respect  to  the  other  Divine  Words,  they  are  speech  which  has  become  evident 
through a particular regard, a minor title, through the partial manifestation of a particular 
Name;  through  a  particular  dominicality,  special  sovereignty,  a  private  mercy.  Their 
degrees  vary  in  regard  to  particularity  and  universality.  Most  inspiration  is  of  this  sort, 
but its degrees vary greatly. For example, the most particular and simple is the inspiration 
of the animals. Then there is the inspiration of the ordinary people; then the inspiration of 
ordinary angels; then the inspiration of the saints, then the inspiration of the  

 

148 

higher  angels.  Thus,  it  is  for  this  reason  that  a  saint  who  offers  supplications  directly 
without  means  by  the  telephone  of  the  heart  says:  “My  heart  tells  me  news  of  my 
Sustainer.” He does not say, “It tells me of the Sustainer of All the Worlds.” And he says: 
“My heart is the mirror, the throne, of my Sustainer.” He does not say, “It is the throne of 
the  Sustainer  of  All  the  Worlds.”  For  he  can  manifest  the  address  to  the  extent  of  its 
capacity and to the degree nearly seventy thousand veils have been raised. Thus, however 
much  higher  and  more  elevated  is  the  decree  of  a  king  promulgated  in  respect  of  his 
supreme sovereignty than the insignificant speech of a common man, and however much 
more  abundantly  the  effulgence  of  the  sun  in  the  sky  may  be  benefited  from  than  the 
manifestation of its reflection in the mirror, and however greater is its superiority, to that 
degree the Qur’an of Mighty Stature is superior to all other speech and all other books. 

After the Qur’an, at the second level, the Holy Books and Revealed Scriptures have 
superiority  according  to  their  degree.  They  have  their  share  from  the  mystery  of  that 
superiority. If all the fine words of all men and jinn which do not issue from the Qur’an 
were to be gathered together, they still could not attain to the sacred rank of the Qur’an 
and  imitate  it.  If  you  want  to  understand  a  little  of  how  the  Qur’an  comes  from  the 
Greatest  Name  and  from  the  greatest  level  of  every  Name,  consider  the  universal, 
elevated statements of Ayat al-Kursi and the following verses: 
And with Him are the keys of the Unseen.2 
O God! Lord of All Dominion.3 

He  draws  the  night  as  a  veil  over  day,  each  seeking  the  other  in  rapid 
succession;  He  created  the  sun,  the  moon,  and  the  stars,  [all]  subject  to  His 
command.4 
O Earth, swallow up your water! And O Sky, withhold your rain!5 
The heavens and the earth and all within them extol and glorify Him.6 

The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all is but like that of a single 
soul.7 
We did indeed offer the Trust to the heavens, and the earth, and the mountains.8 

                                                
2 Qur’an, 6:59. 
3 Qur’an, 3:26. 
4 Qur’an, 7:54. 
5 Qur’an, 11:44. 
6 Qur’an, 17:44. 
7 Qur’an, 31:28. 
8 Qur’an, 33:72. 

 

149 

The  Day  that  We  roll  up  the  heavens  like  a  scroll  rolled  up  for  books 
[completed].9 

No just estimate have they made of God, such as is due to Him: on the Day of 
Judgement the whole of the earth will be but His handful.10 

Had  We  sent  down  this  Qur’an  on  a  mountain,  you  would  indeed  have  seen  it 
humble itself and cleave asunder for fear of God.11 

And study the Suras which begin al-Hamdulillah, or Tusabbihu, and see the rays of 
this  mighty  mystery.  Look  too  at the  openings  of  the  Alif.  Lam.  Mim.’s,  the  Alif.  Lam. 
Ra.’s, and the Ha. Mim.’s, and understand the Qur’an’s importance in the sight of God. 

If  you  have  understood  the  valuable  mystery  of  this  Fourth  Principle,  you  have 
understood  that  revelation  mostly  comes  to  the  prophets  by  means  of  an  angel,  and 
inspiration  is  mostly without means. You will  have  also understood the reason why the 
greatest saint cannot attain to the  level of a prophet. And  you will  have understood too 
the  Qur’an’s  sublimity  and  its  sacred  grandeur  and  the  mystery  of  its  elevated 
miraculousness.  So  too  you  will  have  understood  the  mystery  of  the  necessity  of  the 
Prophet  Muhammad’s  Ascension,  that  is,  that  he  went  to  the  heavens,  to  the  furthest 
Lote-tree, to the  distance  of  two  bow-lengths,  offered  supplications  to the  All-Glorious 
One, Who is closer to him than his jugular vein, and in the twinkling of an eye returned 
whence  he  came.  Indeed,  just  as  the  Splitting  of  the  Moon  was  a  miracle  of  his 
messengership whereby he demonstrated his prophethood to the jinn and mankind, so the 
Ascension was a miracle of his worship and servitude to God whereby he demonstrated 
to the spirits and angels that he was God’s Beloved. 

O God, grant blessings and peace to him and to his Family as befits Your mercy, 
and in veneration of him.  Amen.

The Thirteenth Word 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
And We send down [stage by stage] in the Qur’an that which is a healing and a 
mercy to those  who believe.1 * We have not instructed [the Prophet] in poetry, 
nor is it meet for him.2 

If  you  want  to  compare  the  results  yielded  by  the  wisdom  of  the  All-Wise  Qur’an 
and of the sciences of philosophy, and their  instruction and teaching  and the degrees  in 
their knowledge, then listen carefully to the following words: 

With  its  acute  expositions,  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  rends  the  veil  of 
familiarity and the habitual cast over all the beings in the universe, which are known as 
ordinary things but are all extraordinary and miracles of Divine power, and reveals those 
astonishing wonders to conscious beings. It attracts their gazes and opens up before their 
minds an inexhaustible treasury of knowledge. 

As  for  philosophy,  it  conceals  within  veils  of  the  commonplace  all  the  miracles  of 
power,  which  are  extraordinary,  and  passes  over  them  in  an  ignorant  and  indifferent 
fashion.  It  only  puts  forward  to  be  noted  freaks,  which  have  fallen  from  being 
extraordinary  and  deviated  from  the  order  of  creation,  and  sheered  away  from  the 
perfections  of  their  true  natures;  it  offers  them  to  conscious  beings  as  objects  of  wise 
instruction.  For  example,  it  says  that  man’s  creation  is  ordinary,  despite  its  being  a 
comprehensive  miracle  of  power,  and  looks  on  it  indifferently.  But  then  with  cries  of 
astonishment, it points out as an object of instruction a person who has diverged from the 
perfection of creation, and has three legs or two heads. 

And for example, it considers ordinary the regular sustenance of infants and young, 
bestowed  from  the  treasury  of  mercy,  which  is  a  most  delicate  and  general  miracle  of 
mercy, and draws a  veil of  ingratitude over it. Whereas, on spotting an  insect under the 
sea  which  is  an  exception  from  the  general  order  and  is  alone  and  isolated  from  its 
fellows,  being  fed  with  green  sea-weed,  it  wants  to  make  the  fishermen  weep  for  it, 
because of the Divine favour and munificence manifested on it.3 

                                                
1 Qur’an, 17:82. 
2 Qur’an, 36:69. 
3 Just such an event occurred in America. 

 

151 

So  see  the  wealth  and  riches  of  the  Holy  Qur’an  in  regard  to  knowledge,  wisdom, 
and knowledge of God, and the poverty and bankruptcy of philosophy regarding learning, 
instruction, and knowledge of the Maker! See them, and take a lesson!  

It is because of this, because the All-Wise Qur’an contains infinite brilliant, elevated 
truths, that  it  is  free  of  the  fancies  of  poetry.  Another  reason  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous 
Exposition is not in verse, despite the perfection of its word-order and orderedness and its 
expounding with its well-ordered styles the order and art of the book of the universe, is 
that by not entering under the restrictions of metre, each star of its verses can be a sort of 
centre  to  the  most  of  the  other  verses,  and  be  a  brother  to  them,  and  each  can  form  a 
connecting line with the verses within the sphere encompassing it in order to be a bond in 
the relationships which exist between them. It is as if each independent verse has an eye 
which  looks to most of the other verses, and a  face turned towards them. Thousands of 
Qur’ans are present within the Qur’an, each of which it offers to followers of the different 
paths.  As  is  described  in  the  Twenty-Fifth  Word,  in  Sura  al-Ikhlas  is  a  treasury  of 
knowledge  about  Divine  unity  comprising  thirty-six  Sura  al-Ikhlas’s,  formed  of  a 
compound of six  phrases, each winged. Indeed,  like with the stars  in the sky which are 
apparently  without  order,  each  is  unrestricted  and  as  a  sort  of  centre  extends  a  line  of 
connection to all the stars in the area surrounding it, indicating a hidden relation between 
beings. It is as  if,  like the stars of verses, each single star has an eye which  looks to all 
stars and a  face which  is turned to them. See then the perfect order within the apparent 
lack of order, and take a lesson! Understand one meaning of the verse, 

We have not instructed [the Prophet] in poetry, nor is it meet for him!4 

Understand  also  from  it  that  the  mark  of  poetry  is  to  adorn  insignificant  and  dull 
facts  with  big  and  shining  images  and  fancies,  and  make  them  attractive.  Whereas  the 
truths of the Qur’an are so great, elevated, shining and brilliant, that even the greatest and 
most  brilliant  imaginings  are  dull  and  insignificant  in  comparison  with  them. 
Innumerable truths like the following verses testify to this. For example: 

The  Day  that  We  roll  up  the  heavens  like  a  scroll  rolled  up  for  books 
[completed].5 * He draws the night as a veil over the day, each seeking the other 
in rapid succession.6 * It will be no more than a single blast, when lo! they will 
all be brought up before Us!7 

If you want to see and appreciate how, like shining stars, each of the

152 

Qur’an’s verses scatters the darkness of unbelief by spreading the light of miraculousness 
and  guidance,  imagine  yourself  in  the  age  of  ignorance  and  desert  of  savagery  where 
everything  was  enveloped  in  veils  of  lifelessness  and  nature  amid  the  darkness  of 
ignorance and heedlessness. Then suddenly from the elevated tongue of the Qur’an, you 
hear verses like: 

Whatever is in the heavens and earth declares the praises and glory of God, the 
Sovereign, the Most Holy One, the Mighty, the Wise.8 

See  how  those  dead  or  sleeping  creatures  of  the  world  spring  to  life  at  the  sound  of 
declares the praises and glory in the minds of those listening, how they awake, spring up, 
and mention God’s Names! And at the sound of,  

The seven heavens and the earth and all within them extol and glorify Him,9 

the stars in those black skies, all lifeless pieces of fire, and the wretched creatures on the 
face  of  the  earth,  present  the  following  view  to  those  listening:  the  sky  appears  as  a 
mouth and the stars each as wisdom-displaying words and truth-uttering lights. The earth 
appears  as  a  head,  the  land  and  sea  as  tongues,  and  all  animals  and  plants  as  words  of 
glorification.  Otherwise  you  will  not  appreciate  the  fine  points  and  pleasure  at  looking 
from  this  time  to  that.  For  if  when  you  consider  its  verses,  you  see  them  as  having 
scattered their light since that time, and become like universally accepted knowledge with 
the passage of time, and as shining with the other lights of Islam, and taking their colour 
from the sun of the Qur’an, or if you look at them through a superficial and simple veil of 
familiarity,  you  will  not  truly  see  the  darkness  each  verse  scatters  or  how  sweet  is  the 
recital  of  its  miraculousness,  and  you  will  not  appreciate  this  sort  of  miraculousness 
among  its  many  varieties.  If  you  want  to  understand  one  of  the  highest  degrees  of  the 
Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition’s miraculousness, listen to the following comparison: 

Let us imagine an extremely strange and vast and spreading tree which is concealed 
beneath a veil of the unseen and hidden in a level of concealment. It is clear that there has 
to  be  a  relationship,  harmony,  and  balance  between  a  tree  and  all  its  members  like  its 
branches,  fruits,  leaves, and  blossom, the  same  as between  man’s  members. Each of  its 
parts takes on a form and is given a shape in accordance with the nature of the tree. So if 
someone appears and traces a picture on top of the veil corresponding to the members of 
the tree, which has never been seen, then delimits each member, and from the branches to 
the  fruit,  and  the  fruit  to  the  leaves  draws  a  form  proportionately,  and  fills  the  space 
between its source and extremities, which are an  

                                                
8 Qur’an, 62:1. 
9 Qur’an, 17:44. 

 

153 

infinite distance from one another, with drawings showing exactly the shape and form of 
its members, certainly no doubt will remain that the artist sees the concealed tree with an 
eye that penetrates and encompasses the unseen, then he depicts it. 

In  just  the  same  way,  the  discriminating  statements  of  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous 
Exposition concerning the reality of contingent beings (that is, concerning the reality of 
the tree of creation which stretches from the beginning of the world to the farthest limits 
of  the  hereafter,  and  spreads  from  the  earth  to  the  Divine  Throne  and  from  minute 
particles to the sun) have preserved the proportion between the members to such a degree 
and  have  given  all  the  members  and  fruits  a  form  so  suitable  that  all  investigative 
scholars  have  declared  when  they  have  concluded  their  researches  into  its  depictions: 
“What wonders God has willed! How great are God’s blessings!” They have said: “It is 
only you who solves and unravels the talisman of the universe and riddle of creation, O 
All-Wise Qur’an!” 

“And God’s is the highest similitude”10 –and there is no error in the comparison– let 
us  represent  the  Divine  Names  and  attributes,  and  dominical  acts  and  deeds  as  a  Tuba-
tree of light, the extent of whose grandeur stretches from pre-eternity to post-eternity, and 
the limits of whose vastness spread through infinite, endless space, and encompass it, and 
the compass of whose deeds extend from,  

It is God Who splits the seed-grain and date-stone,11 and, Comes between man 
and his heart,12 and, It is He Who shapes you in the wombs as He wishes,13 

to,  

Who created the heavens and the earth in six days,14 and, And the heavens rolled 
up in His right hand,15 and, He has subjected the sun and the moon.16 

The All-Wise Qur’an has described that luminous reality, the truths of those Names and 
attributes,  and  acts  and  deeds,  together  with  all  their  branches  and  twigs  and  aims  and 
fruits in a way so harmonious, so fitting for one another, so appropriate for one another, 
without  marring  one  another  or  spoiling  the  decree  of  one  other,  or  their  being  remote 
from one another, that all those who have discerned the reality of things and penetrated 
the

mysteries,  and  all  the  wise  and  the  sage  who  have  journeyed  in  the  realm  of  the  inner 
dimension of things, have declared: “Glory be to God!” in the face of that Discriminating 
Exposition, and have affirmed it, saying: “How right, how conformable with reality, how 
fine, how worthy!” 

Take, for example, the six pillars of belief, which resemble a single branch of those 
two mighty trees which look to the entire sphere of contingency and sphere of necessity: 
it  depicts  all  the  branches  and  boughs  of  those  pillars  –even  the  farthest  fruits  and 
flowers– observing such a harmony and proportion between them, and describes them in 
a manner so balanced, and illustrates them a way so symmetrical that the human mind is 
powerless to perceive it and stands astonished at its beauty. And the proof that a beauty 
of proportion and perfect relation and complete balance have been preserved between the 
five pillars of Islam, which are  like one twig of the  branch of  belief, down to the  finest 
details,  smallest  point  of  conduct,  furthest  aims,  most  profound  wisdom,  and  most 
insignificant  fruits,  is  the  perfect  order  and  balance  and  beauty  of  proportion  and 
soundness  of  the  Greater  Shari’a  of  Islam,  which  has  emerged  from  the  decisive 
statements, senses, indications, and allusions of the comprehensive Qur’an; they form an 
irrefutable  and  decisive  proof  and  just  witness  that  cannot  be  doubted. This  means  that 
the  expositions  of  the  Qur’an  cannot  be  attributed  to  man’s  partial  knowledge,  and 
particularly to the knowledge of someone unlettered. They rest rather on a comprehensive 
knowledge  and  are  the  word  of  One  able  to  see  all  things  together  and  observe  in  one 
moment all truths between pre-eternity and post-eternity. The verse: 

Praise be to God, Who has revealed to His servant the Book, and has allowed no 
crookedness therein.17 

concerns this fact. 

O God! O Revealer of the Qur’an! For the sake of the Qur’an and for the sake 
of  the  one  to  whom  You  revealed  the  Qur’an,  illuminate  our  hearts  and  our 
graves with the light of belief and the Qur’an. Amen. O One from Whom help is 
sought! 

                                                
17 Qur’an, 18:1.

The Second Station 
of the Thirteenth Word 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 

 [A  conversation  held  with  some  young  people  who,  though  surrounded  by 
temptation, had not yet lost their power of reason.] 

Being assaulted by the deceptive, seductive amusements of the present time, a group 
of  young  people  were  asking:  “How  can  we  save  our  lives  in  the  hereafter?”,  and  they 
sought  help  from  the  Risale-i  Nur.    So  I  said  the  following  to them  in  the  name  of  the 
Risale-i Nur: 

The  grave  is  there  and  no  one  can  deny  it.  Whether  they  want  to or  not,  everyone 
must enter it. And apart from the following three ‘Ways’, there is no other way it can be 
approached: 

First  Way:   For those who believe, the grave  is the door to a world  far  better than 

this world. 

Second  Way:    For  those  who  believe  in  the  hereafter,  but  who  approach  it  on  the 
path of dissipation and misguidance, it is the door to a prison of solitary confinement, an 
eternal dungeon, where they will be separated from all their loved ones. 

Third  Way:    For  the  unbelievers  and  the  misguided  who  do  not  believe  in  the 
hereafter, it is the door to eternal extinction. That is to say, it is the gallows on which both 
themselves  and  all  those  they  love  will  be  executed.  Since  they  think  it  is  thus,  that  is 
exactly how they shall experience it: as punishment. 

These last two Ways are self-evident, they do not require proof, they are plain for all 
to see. Since the appointed hour is secret, and death may come any time and cut off his 
head,  and  it  does  not  differentiate  between  young  and  old,  perpetually  having  such  an 
awesome and serious matter before him, unhappy man will surely search for the means to 
deliver  himself  from  that  eternal  extinction,  that  infinite,  endless  solitary  confinement; 
the  means  to  transform  the  door  of  the  grave  into  a  door  opening  on  to  an  everlasting 
world, eternal happiness, and a world of light. It will be a question for him that looms as 
large as the world. 

 

156 

The certain fact of death, then, can only be approached in these three ways, and one 
hundred and twenty-four thousand  veracious  messengers  –the prophets,  in whose  hands 
are  miracles  as  signs  of  confirmation–  have  announced  that  the  three  ways  are  as 
described  above.  And,  relying  on  their  illuminations  and  visions,  one  hundred  and 
twenty-four  million  saints  have  confirmed  and  set  their  signatures  on  the  prophets’ 
tidings.  And  innumerable  exact  scholars  have  proved  it  rationally  with  their  categorical 
proofs at the level of ‘certainty at the degree of knowledge.’1 They have all unanimously 
declared  it to be a ninety-nine per cent certain probability, saying:  “The only way to be 
saved  from  extinction  and  eternal  imprisonment,  and  be  directed  towards  eternal 
happiness, is through belief in God and obedience to Him.” 

If a person considers but does not heed the word of a single messenger not to take a 
dangerous  road  on  which  there  is  a  one  per  cent  danger  of  perishing,  and  takes  it,  the 
anxiety at perishing he suffers will destroy even his appetite for food. Thus hundreds of 
thousands  of  veracious  and  verified  messengers  announced  that  there  is  a  one  hundred 
per  cent  probability  that  misguidance  and  vice  lead  to  the  gallows  of  the  grave,  ever 
before the eyes, and eternal solitary confinement, and that there is a one hundred per cent 
probability  that  belief  and  worship  remove  those  gallows,  close  the  solitary  prison,  and 
transform  the  ever-apparent  grave  into  a  door  opening  onto  an  everlasting  treasury  and 
palace of felicity; and they have pointed out signs and traces of these. Confronted as he 
is, then, with this strange, awesome, terrifying matter, if wretched man –especially if he 
is a Muslim– does not believe and worship, is he able to banish the grievous pain arising 
from  the  anxiety  he  suffers  as  he  all  the  time  awaits  his  turn  to  be  summoned  to those 
gallows,  ever-present  before  his  eyes,  even  if  he  is  given  rule  over  the  whole  world 
together with all its pleasures? I ask you. 

Since old-age, illness, disaster, and on all sides death open up the frightful pain and 
are  a  reminder,  even  if  the  people  of  misguidance  and  vice  enjoy  a  hundred  thousand 
pleasures and delights, they most certainly experience a sort of hell in their hearts, but a 
profound stupor of heedlessness temporarily makes them insensible to it. 

Since  for  the  people  of  belief  and  worship  the  grave,  ever  before  their  eyes,  is  the 
door to an everlasting treasury and eternal happiness, and since, by reason of the ‘belief 
coupon’,  a  ticket  from  the  pre-eternal  lottery  of  Divine  Determining  for  millions  upon 
millions of poundsworth of gold and diamonds has come up for each of them, they all the 
time await the word, “Come and collect your ticket” with a truly profound pleasure and 
real spiritual delight. This pleasure  is such that  if  it materialized and the  seed  became  a 
tree, it would be like a private paradise. However, one who abandons the  

                                                
1 One of these is the Risale-i Nur. And it is there for all to see. 

 

157 

delight  and  great  pleasure  due  to  the  drives  of  youth,  and  chooses  in  a  dissolute  and 
licentious  manner temporary  illicit pleasures, which resemble poisonous  honey polluted 
with those innumerable pains, falls to a degree a hundred times lower than an animal. 

Furthermore, such a person will not be like unbelieving Europeans, for if they deny 
the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), they may recognize the other prophets. And if they do 
not  know  God,  they  may  possess  some  good  qualities  which  are  the  means  to  certain 
perfections. But a Muslim knows both the prophets, and his Sustainer, and all perfection 
by  means  of  Muhammad  the  Arabian  (PBUH).  If  one  of  them  abandons  the  Prophet’s 
instruction  and  puts  himself  outside  his  fold,  he  will  not  recognize  any  other  prophet, 
neither will he recognize God. Nor will he know any of the fundamentals within his spirit 
which  will  preserve  his  perfections.  For,  since  Muhammad  (PBUH)  is  the  last  and 
greatest of the prophets, and his religion and summons are for the whole of mankind, and 
since he is superior to all with regard to his miracles and religion, and acts as teacher to 
all mankind in all matters concerning reality, and has proved this in a brilliant manner for 
fourteen  centuries,  and  is  the  cause  of  pride  for  mankind,  a  Muslim  who  abandons 
Muhammad  (PBUH)’s  essential  training  and  the  principles  of  his  religion  will  most 
certainly be unable to find any light, or achieve any perfection. He will be condemned to 
absolute decline. 

And so, you unfortunates who are addicted to the pleasures of the life of this world, 
and with anxiety at the future, struggle to secure it and your lives! If you want pleasure, 
delight, happiness, and ease in this world, make do with what is licit. That is sufficient for 
your  enjoyment.  You  will  surely  have  understood  from  other  parts  of  the  Risale-i  Nur 
that in each pleasure which is outside this and is illicit, lies a thousand pains. If the events 
of the future –for example, of fifty years hence– were shown in the cinema in the same 
way that they show at the present time the events of the past, those who indulge in vice 
would weep filled with horror and disgust at those things which now amuse them. 

Those who wish to be permanently, eternally happy in this world and the next should 

take as their guide the instruction of Muhammad (PBUH) within the bounds of belief.

A Warning, Lesson and Reminder 
Given to a Number of Unhappy Youths 

One  day  a  number  of  bright  youths  came  to  me,  seeking  an  effective  deterrent  in 
order to guard themselves against the dangers arising from life, youth, and the lusts of the 
soul.  I  said  to these  youths  as  I  had  to those  who  had  previously  sought  help  from  the 
Risale-i Nur: 

Your youth will definitely leave you, and if you do not remain within the bounds of 
the  licit,  it  will  be  lost,  and  rather  than  its  pleasures,  it  will  bring  you  calamities  and 
suffering in this world, in the grave, and in the hereafter. But if, through Islamic training, 
you spend the bounty of your youth as thanks honourably, in uprightness and obedience, 
it will in effect remain perpetually and will be the cause of gaining eternal youth. 

As for life, if it is without belief, or because of rebelliousness belief is ineffective, it 
will produce pains, sorrows and grief far exceeding the superficial, fleeting enjoyment it 
brings. Because, since, contrary to the animals, man possesses a mind and he thinks, he is 
connected to both the present time, and to the past and the future. He can obtain both pain 
and  pleasure  from  them.  Whereas,  since  the  animals  do  not  think,  the  sorrows  arising 
from  the  past  and  the  fears  and  anxieties  arising  from  the  future  do  not  spoil  their 
pleasure  of  the  present.  Especially  if  the  pleasure  is  illicit;  then  it  is  like  an  altogether 
poisonous honey. 

That  is to say,  from the point of  view of the pleasure of  life,  man  falls to a level  a 
hundred  times  lower  than  the  animals.  In  fact,  life  for  the  people  of  misguidance  and 
heedlessness, and indeed their existence, rather their world, is the day in which they find 
themselves. From the point of view of their misguidance, all the time and universes of the 
past are non-existent, are dead. So their intellects, which connect them to the past and the 
future, produce darkness, blackness for them. Due to their lack of belief, the future is also 
non-existent. Furthermore, because they think, the eternal separations resulting from this 
non-existence continuously produce darkness for their lives. But if belief gives life to life, 
through  its  light  both  the  past  and  the  future  are  illuminated  and  find  existence.  Like 
present time, it produces elevated, spiritual pleasures and lights of existence for the spirit 
and heart – in respect of belief. There is an explanation of this truth in the ‘Seventh Hope’ 
in The Treatise for the Elderly. You may refer to that. 

 

159 

Life  is  thus.  If  you  want  the  pleasure  and  enjoyment  of  life,  give  life  to  your  life 
through belief, and adorn it with religious duties, and preserve it by abstaining from sins. 
Concerning  the  fearsome  reality  of  death,  which  is  demonstrated  by  deaths  every 
day, everywhere, at all times, I shall explain it to you with a comparison, in the same way 
that I told the other youths. 

For  example,  a  gallows  has  been  erected  here  in  front  of  your  eyes.  Beside  it  is  a 
lottery office, but one which gives tickets  for truly  huge prizes.  We people  here are ten 
people,  whether  we  like  it  or  not,  we  shall  be  summoned  there;  there  is  no  other 
alternative. They will call us, and since the time is secret, any minute they may say either: 
“Come  and  collect  the  ticket  for  your  execution!  Mount  the  gallows!”  Or:  “A  ticket  to 
win a prize of millions of dollars’ worth of gold has come up for you. Come and collect 
it!” While waiting  for them to say this, two people suddenly appear at the door. One of 
them  is  a  scantily  dressed  woman,  beautiful  and  deceiving.  In  her  hand  is  some 
apparently  extremely  delicious,  but  in  fact  poisonous,  candy,  which  she  has  brought 
wanting  us  to  eat  it.  The  other  is  an  undeceiving  and  undeceivable  serious  person.  He 
enters behind the woman, and says: 

“I  have  brought you a talisman, a  lesson. If  you study  it, and  if  you do not eat that 
candy,  you  will  be  saved  from  the  gallows.  With  this  talisman,  you  will  receive  your 
ticket for the matchless prize. Look, you see with your own eyes that those who eat the 
honey mount those gallows, and until that time they suffer dreadful stomach pains from 
the poison of the candy. And who it is that will receive the ticket for the large prize is not 
apparent;  it  seems  that  they  too  mount the  gallows.  But there  are  millions  of  witnesses 
who  testify  that  they  can  enter the  prize  arena  easily.  So,  look  from  the  windows!  The 
highest officials and the high-ranking persons concerned with this business proclaim with 
loud voices: ‘Just as you see with the clear certainty of your own eyes those mounting the 
gallows,  so  be  certain  as  daylight,  with  no  doubt  or  misgiving,  that  those  with  the 
talisman receive the ticket for the prize.’” 

Thus, like the comparison, since the dissolute pleasures of youth in the sphere of the 
illicit,  which  are  like  poisonous  honey,  lose  belief,  which  is  the  ticket  for  an  eternal 
treasury  and  the  passport  for  everlasting  happiness,  a  person  who  indulges  in  them 
descends to death, which is like the gallows, and to the tribulations of the grave, which is 
like  the  door  to  eternal  darkness.  And  since  the  appointed  hour  is  unknown,  its 
executioner, not differentiating between young and old, may come at any time to cut off 
your head. If you give up illicit desires, which are like the poisonous honey, and acquire 
belief and perform the religious duties, which are the Qur’anic talisman, one hundred and 
twenty-four thousand prophets (Peace be upon them) together  

 

160 

with innumerable saints and people of truth have unanimously announced that you shall 
receive  the  ticket  for  the  treasury  of  eternal  happiness  which  comes  up  from  the 
extraordinary lottery of human destiny. And they have pointed to traces of it. 

In Short: Youth will go. And if it goes being squandered, it results in thousands of 
calamities and pains both in this world and in the next. If you want to understand how the 
majority of such youths end up in hospitals with imagined diseases arising from misspent 
youth and prodigality, and  in  prisons or hostels  for the destitute through their excesses, 
and in bars due to the distress arising from their pain and suffering, then go and ask at the 
hospitals, prisons and graveyards. 

For sure,  just as  you  will  hear  from  most of the  hospitals the  moans and groans of 
those ill from dissipation and debauchery resulting from the drives of youth, so will you 
hear from the prisons the regretful sighs of unhappy youths who are being punished for 
illicit  deeds  mostly  resulting  from  the  excesses  of  youth.  And  you  will  understand  that 
most  of  the  torments  of  the  grave  –  that  Intermediate  Realm  the  doors  of  which 
continuously open and shut for those who enter it – are the result of misspent youth, as is 
testified to by those who have divined the life of the grave, and is affirmed by the people 
of reality. 

Also, ask the elderly and the sick, who form the majority of mankind. Certainly, the 
great majority of them will say with sorrow and regret: “Alas! We wasted our youth on 
passion  and  fancy;  indeed,  harmfully.  Be  careful,  do  not  do  as  we  did!”  Because,  as  a 
consequence of the illicit pleasures of five to ten years’ youth, a person suffers years of 
grief  and  sorrow  in  this  world,  torment  and  harm  in  the  Intermediate  Realm,  and  the 
calamities  of  Hell  in  the  hereafter.  And  although  such  a  person  is  in  a  most  pitiable 
situation, he in no way deserves pity. For those who freely consent to indulge in harmful 
actions may not be pitied. They are not worthy of it. 

May Almighty God save us and you from the alluring temptations of this time, and 

preserve us from them. Amen.

A Footnote to the Second Station 
of the Thirteenth Word 

In His name, be He glorified! 

Those  in  prison  are  in  great  need  of  the  true  consolation  of  the  Risale-i  Nur.  
Particularly those who having suffered the blows of youth, are passing their sweet, young 
lives in prison; they need the Risale-i Nur as much as they need bread. 

Indeed,  youth  heeds  the  emotions  rather  than  reason,  and  emotions  and  desires  are 
blind;  they  do  not  consider  the  consequences.  They  prefer  one  ounce  of  immediate 
pleasure to tons of future pleasure. They kill for the one minute pleasure of revenge, then 
suffer for eighty thousand hours the pain of prison. And one hour’s dissolute pleasure in 
questions of honour may result in life’s enjoyment being utterly destroyed due to distress 
at the fear of both prison and enemies. There are many other examples, many pitfalls for 
the  unfortunate  young  because  of  which  they  transform  their  sweet  lives  into  the  most 
bitter and pitiable lives. 

Consider  a  vast  state  to  the  north;1  it  has  gained  possession  of  the  passions  of  its 
young people and  is shaking this century with  its storms.  For it has  made  lawful  for  its 
youths  the  pleasing  daughters  and  wives  of  upright  people,  and  these  youths  act  only 
according to their feelings, which are blind to all  consequences. By permitting men and 
women  to  go  together  to  the  public  baths,  they  are  even  encouraging  immorality.  And 
they consider it lawful for vagabonds and the poor to plunder the property of the rich. All 
mankind trembles in the face of this calamity. 

It is therefore most necessary in this century for all Muslim youths to act heroically, 
and to respond to this two-pronged attack with keen swords like the Fruits of Belief and 
the  Guide  For  Youth  from  the  Risale-i  Nur.  Otherwise  those  unfortunate  youths  will 
destroy  utterly  both  their  futures  in  this  world,  and  their  agreeable  lives,  and  their 
happiness  in  the  hereafter,  and  their  eternal  lives,  and  transform  them  into  torment  and 
suffering. And through their abuses and dissoluteness, they will end up in hospitals, and 
through their excesses in life, in prisons. In their old age, they will weep copiously with a 
thousand regrets.

162 

If,  on  the  other  hand,  they  protect  themselves  with  Qur’anic  training  and  with  the 
truths  of  the  Risale-i  Nur,  they  will  become  truly  heroic  youths,  perfect  human  beings, 
successful  Muslims,  and  in  some  ways  rulers  over  animate  beings  and  the  rest  of  the 
animal kingdom. 

When a youth in prison spends one hour out of the twenty-four each day on the five 
obligatory prayers, and repents  for the  mistakes that were the cause of  his disaster, and 
abstains from other harmful, painful sins, this will be of great benefit for both his life, and 
his future, and his country, and his nation, and his relatives, and he will also gain with his 
fleeting  youth of ten to fifteen  years an eternal,  brilliant  youth. Foremost the Qur’an of 
Miraculous Exposition, and all the revealed scriptures, have given this certain good news. 
If such a youth demonstrates through moderation and obedience, his gratitude for the 
pleasing,  delightful  bounty  of  youth,  it  will  both  increase  it,  and  make  it  eternal,  and 
make  it a pleasure. Otherwise  it will  be  both calamitous, and  become painful, grievous, 
and  a  nightmare,  and  then  it  will  depart.  It  will  cause  him  to  become  like  a  vagrant, 
harmful for both his relatives, and his country, and his nation. 

If the prisoner has been sentenced unjustly, on condition he performs the obligatory 
prayers, each hour will be the equivalent of a day’s worship, and the prison will be like a 
recluse’s cell. He will be counted among the pious hermits of olden times who retired to 
caves in order to devote themselves to worship. If he is poor, aged, and ill, and desirous 
of the truths of belief, on condition he performs the obligatory prayers and repents, each 
hour will become the equivalent of twenty hours’ worship, and prison will become like a 
rest-house  for  him,  and  because  of  his  friends  there  who  regard  him  with  affection,  a 
place of love, training, and education. He will probably be happier staying in prison than 
being free, for outside he is confused and subject to the assaults of sins from all sides. He 
may  receive  a  complete  education  from  prison.  On  being  released,  it  will  not  be  as  a 
murderer,  or  thirsting  for  revenge,  but  as  someone  penitent,  proven  by  trial,  well-
behaved,  and  beneficial  for  his  nation.  In  fact,  the  Denizli  prisoners  became  so 
extraordinarily  well-behaved  after  studying  the  Risale-i  Nur  for  only  a  short  time  that 
some  of  those  concerned  said:  “Studying  the  Risale-i  Nur  for  fifteen  weeks  is  more 
effective at reforming them than putting them in prison for fifteen years.” 

Since  death  does  not  die,  and  the  appointed  hour  is  unknown,  it  may  come  at  any 
time; and since the grave cannot be closed, and troop after troop enter it and are lost; and 
since it has been shown through the truths of the Qur’an that for those who believe death 
is transformed  into the discharge papers releasing them  from  eternal  annihilation, while 
for the corrupt and the  

 

163 

dissolute it  is disappearing  for ever  into eternal annihilation, and  is unending separation 
from  their  loved  ones  and  all  beings,  most  certainly  and  with  no  doubt  at  all,  the  most 
fortunate person is he who with patience and thanks fully benefits from his time in prison, 
and  studying  the  Risale-i  Nur  works  to  serve  the  Qur’an  and  his  belief  on  the  straight 
path. 

O man who is addicted to enjoyment and pleasure! I am seventy-five years old, and I 
know  with  utter  certainty  from  thousands  of  experiences,  proofs,  and  events  that  true 
enjoyment, pain-free pleasure, grief-free joy, and life’s happiness are only to be found in 
belief  and  in  the  sphere  of  the  truths  of  belief.  While  a  single  worldly  pleasure  yields 
numerous  pains;  as  though  dealing  ten  slaps  for  a  single  grape,  it  drives  away  all  life’s 
pleasure. 

O you unfortunate people who are experiencing the misfortune of prison! Since your 
world is weeping and your life is bitter, strive so that your hereafter will not also weep, 
and  your  eternal  life  will  smile  and  be  sweet!  Benefit  from  prison!  Just  as  sometimes 
under severe conditions in the face of the enemy, an hour’s watch may be equivalent to a 
year’s  worship,  so  in  the  severe  conditions  you  are  experiencing,  the  hardship  of  each 
hour spent as worship becomes the equivalent of many hours, it transforms that hardship 
into mercy. 

*  *  * 

In His Name, be He glorified! 

My dear and loyal brothers! 
I shall explain in three ‘Points’ an effective solace for those who are experiencing the 
calamity  of  prison,  and  for  those  who  kindly  help  them  and  faithfully  supervise  their 
food, which comes from outside. 

First Point: Each day spent in prison may gain as much as ten days’ worship, and, 
with regards to their fruits, may transform those transient hours into enduring hours, and 
through five or ten years’ punishment may be the means of saving a person from millions 
of  years  of  eternal  imprisonment.  For the  believers, the  condition  for  gaining  this  most 
significant and valuable advantage is to perform the obligatory prayers, repent for the sins 
that were the cause of their imprisonment, and offer thanks in patience. For sure, prison is 
an obstacle to many sins; it does not provide the opportunity for them. 

Second Point: Just as the cessation of pleasure causes pain, so does the cessation of 
pain give pleasure. Yes, on thinking of past happy, enjoyable days, everyone feels a pang 
of regret and  longing, and says:  “Alas!”, and recalling calamitous, unhappy days of the 
past, experiences a sort of  

 

164 

pleasure since they are passed, and says: “Praise and thanks be to God, that calamity has 
left  its  reward  and  departed.”  He  breathes  a  sigh  of  relief.  That  is  to  say,  an  hour’s 
temporary  pain  and  sorrow  leave  behind  a  sort  of  pleasure  in  the  spirit,  while  a 
pleasurable hour leaves a pain. 

Since the reality is thus; and since past calamitous hours together with their pains are 
no  longer  existent,  and  future  distressing  days  are  at the  present  time  non-existent,  and 
there  is  no  pain  from  nothing,  to  continually  eat  bread  and  drink  water  today,  for 
example, because of the possibility of being hungry and thirsty in several days’ time, is 
most  foolish. In  just the same way, to think  now of the past and  future unhappy  hours, 
which simply do not exist, and to display  impatience, and  ignoring one’s  faulty  self, to 
moan  as  though  complaining  about  God  is  also  most  foolish.  So  long  as  the  power  of 
patience is not scattered to left and right, that is, to the past and future, and is held firm in 
the face of the present of hour and day, it is sufficient. The distress is reduced from ten to 
one. 

In fact, but let it not be complaining, Divine favour pointed out the above fact to me 
while, during a  few days of  material  and spiritual  affliction,  illness and trial the  like of 
which I had never before experienced in my life, I was being crushed in particular by the 
despair and distress of the heart and spirit which resulted from my being unable to serve 
the Qur’an and belief with the Risale-i Nur. I was then content with my distressing illness 
and imprisonment. For, saying: “It is great profit for an unfortunate like myself who waits 
at  the  door  of  the  grave  to  make  one  hour  which  might  be  passed  in  heedlessness  ten 
hours’ worth of worship,” I gave thanks. 

Third Point: There  is great gain  in  compassionately aiding and assisting prisoners, 
in  giving  them  the  sustenance  they  need,  and  in  soothing  their  spiritual  wounds  with 
consolation. Giving them their food which comes from outside is like alms-giving which, 
exactly to the amount of the food, is written in the book of good deeds of those, outside 
and inside, who do this, together with the warders concerned. Especially  if the unhappy 
prisoner is old, ill, poor, or a stranger, then the reward of this alms-giving increases many 
times over. 

The  condition  of  this  high  profit  is  to  perform  the  obligatory  prayers  so  that  such 
service is for God’s sake. Another condition is to hasten to their assistance with sincerity, 
compassion and joy, and in such a way as to not make them feel obliged.

In His Name, be He glorified! 
And there is nothing but it glorifies Him with praise. 

My friends in prison and brothers in religion! 
It occurred to  me  to  explain  a  truth  to  you  which  will  save  you  from  both  worldly 

torment and the torment of the hereafter. It is as follows: 

For  example,  a  person  killed  someone’s  brother  or  one  of  his  relatives.  A  murder 
which yields one minute’s pleasure of revenge causes millions of minutes of both distress 
for the heart and the anguish of prison. And the fear of revenge by the murdered man’s 
relatives, and anxiety of finding himself face to face with his enemy drives away all his 
pleasure in life. He suffers the torment of both fear and anger. There is only one solution 
for this, and that is reconciliation, which the Qur’an commands, and truth, reality, benefit, 
humanity, and Islam require and encourage. 

Certainly,  what  is  required  in  reality  is  peace,  because  the  appointed  hour  is  set,  it 
does  not  change.  Since  his  appointed  hour  had  come,  in  any  event  the  murdered  man 
would  have  stayed  no  longer.  As  for  the  murderer,  he  was  the  means  of  God’s  decree 
being carried out. So long as there is no reconciliation, both sides perpetually suffer the 
torments of fear and revenge. It is because of this that Islam commands that “one believer 
should not be vexed with another believer for more than three days.”1 If the murder was 
not the result of a vindictive grudge and enmity, and a two-faced trouble-maker instigated 
the discord, it is essential to make peace quickly. Otherwise, that minor disaster becomes 
a  large  one,  and  continues.  If  they  make  peace,  and  the  murderer  repents  and  prays 
continuously  for  the  man  he  killed,  then  both  sides  will  gain  much  and  become  like 
brothers. In place of one departed brother, he will gain several religious brothers. He will 
be  resigned  to  Divine  Decree  and  Determining  and  forgive  his  enemy.  Especially  since 
they  heed  the  lessons  of  the  Risale-i  Nur,  both  individual  and  public  peace  and  well-
being, and the brotherhood that there is in the sphere of the Risale-i Nur, require that they 
put aside all the hard feelings that exist between them. 

It  was thus  in  Denizli  Prison;  all  the  prisoners  who  were  enemies  became  brothers 
through the  lessons of the Risale-i Nur. It was one reason  for our acquittal,  and caused 
even the irreligious and ungodly to say about those prisoners: “Masha’llah! Barakallah!” 
And  it  was  an  utter    relief  for  those  prisoners.  I  myself  have  seen  here  a  hundred  men 
suffer inconvenience on account of one man and not go out to take exercise together. It is 
oppression towards them. A manly believer of sound conscience will not cause hundreds 
of other

believers  harm  because of some  insignificant and  minor error or benefit. If he  makes  a 
mistake and does cause harm, he should repent immediately. 

*  *  * 

In His Name, be He glorified! 

My loyal new brothers and old prisoners! 
I  have  formed  the  firm  conclusion  that,  in  respect  of  Divine  favour,  you  are  an 
important cause in our entering here. That is to say, with its consolation and the truths of 
belief, the Risale-i Nur is to save both you from the distress of this calamity of prison and 
from  much  worldly  harm,  and  your  life  from  passing  profitlessly  and  in  vain  through 
grief  and  sorrow  and  being  wasted  on  the  winds  of  fancy,  and  your  hereafter  from 
weeping like your world is weeping now; it is to provide you with true solace. 

Since the reality of the matter is this, of course you must be brothers to one another, 
like the Denizli prisoners and Students of the Risale-i Nur. You can see that they examine 
all your possessions, food, bread, and soup which come from outside so that a knife does 
not  get  in  among  you  and  you  do  not  attack  one  another.  The  warders  who  faithfully 
serve  you  suffer  much  trouble.  Also,  you  do  not go out to  exercise  together,  as  though 
you were going to attack one another like wild beasts. And so, new friends, who are by 
nature bold and courageous, with great moral courage you should say to the group at this 
time: 

“If not knives, but Mausers and revolvers were given us, and the order to fire as well, 
we  would  not  hurt  our  friends  who  are  unfortunate  and  suffering  this  calamity  like 
ourselves.  Through  the  guidance  and  at  the  command  of  the  Qur’an,  and  belief,  and 
Islamic brotherhood, and our interests, we have decided to forgive them and to try not to 
offend them, even if formerly there were a hundred reasons for our enmity and hostility.” 
And so transform this prison into an auspicious place of study.

AN IMPORTANT MATTER 
which occurred to my heart on the Night of Power 

(The Addendum to the Second Station of the Thirteenth Word) 

I  shall  allude  briefly  to  a  most  extensive  and  lengthy  truth  which  occurred  to  my 

heart on the Night of Power. 

Because  of  the  extreme  tyranny  and  despotism  of  this  last  World  War  and  its 
merciless destruction, and hundreds of innocents being scattered and ruined on account of 
a single enemy, and the awesome despair of the defeated, and the fearsome alarm of the 
victors and their ghastly pangs of conscience arising from the supremacy they are unable 
to maintain and the destruction they are unable to repair, and the utter transitoriness and 
ephemerality of the life of this world and the deceptive, opiate nature of the fantasies of 
civilization  becoming  apparent  to  all,  and  the  exalted  abilities  lodged  in  human  nature 
and the  human essence  being wounded  in a universal and awesome  manner,  and  man’s 
innate love and desire for immortality being aroused and awakened, and heedlessness and 
misguidance  and  deaf,  lifeless  nature  being  smashed  by  the  diamond  sword  of  the 
Qur’an, and the exceedingly ugly, exceedingly cruel true face of world politics becoming 
apparent, which is the widest and most suffocating and deceptive cover for heedlessness 
and misguidance, most certainly and without any shadow of a doubt, since the life of this 
world –which is the metaphorical beloved of mankind– is thus ugly and transient, man’s 
true nature will search with all its strength for eternal life, which it truly loves and yearns 
for, just as there are signs of this occurring in the North, the West, and in America. 

Most certainly there is also no doubt that since the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, 
which each century for one thousand three hundred and sixty years has had three hundred 
and  fifty  million  students,  and  sets  the  seal  on  each  of  its  pronouncements  and  claims 
through the affirmation of millions of profound, veracious scholars, and each minute has 
been present with its sacredness in the hearts of millions of hafiz’s and given instruction 
to  mankind  through  their  tongues,  and  which  in  a  way  unmatched  by  any  other  book 
conveys the good news of eternal life and everlasting happiness to mankind and heals all 
their  wounds,  –since  the  Qur’an  has  given  this  certain  good  news  of  eternal  life  and 
happiness  with  thousands  of  its  insistent,  powerful  and  repeated  verses,  and  with  its 
certain unshakeable proofs and innumerable indubitable arguments which invite and give 
news explicitly and implicitly tens of thousands of times, so long as human kind does not 
altogether  lose  its  mind  and  a  material  or  immaterial  doomsday  does  not  erupt over  its 
head, the  

 

168 

broad  masses  and  great  states  in  the  world  will  search  out  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous 
Exposition, and having grasped its truths, will embrace it with all their lives and spirits, 
just  as  there  are  [now]  famous  preachers  in  Sweden,  Norway,  Finland  and  England 
working  to  have  the  Qur’an  accepted,  and  the  important  community  of  America  is 
searching for the true religion. Because in view of this fact, the Qur’an by no means has – 
nor can have – any equal. Absolutely nothing can take the place of this greatest miracle. 

SECONDLY: Since the Risale-i Nur has performed the service of a diamond sword 
in  the  hand  of  this  greatest  miracle  and  compelled  its  stubborn  enemies  to  submit,  and 
acts  as  a  herald  to  the  treasures  of  the  Qur’an  in  a  fashion  that  illuminates  and  heals 
completely both the heart, and the spirit, and the emotions, and has no source or authority 
other than the Qur’an and is its miracle, it performs that duty perfectly.  

Furthermore  it  has  completely  routed  the  obstinate  atheists  and  their  fearsome 
propaganda  against  it,  and  smashed  to  pieces  with  the  treatise  Nature:  Cause  or  Effect 
nature, which is the most impregnable bastion of misguidance, and, with the Sixth Topic 
of the treatise Fruits of Belief together with the First, Second, Third and Eighth Proofs all 
of  which  are  included  in  the  book  The  Staff  of  Moses,  has  banished  heedlessness  in  a 
most brilliant fashion in its most dense, suffocating and extensive form beneath the wide-
reaching veils of science and has demonstrated the light of Divine unity. 

For  sure,  since  religious  instruction  is  now  officially  permitted  and  permission  has 
been  given  to  open  private  places  of  study,  it  is  necessary  for  us  and  essential  for  the 
nation that, as far as is possible, Students of the Risale-i Nur should open a small ‘Risale-
i Nur Study Centre’ in every place. Although everyone would benefit to some extent, not 
everyone  would  understand  every  matter  completely.  But  since  these  matters  are 
explanations  of  the  truths  of  belief,  they  are  both  learning,  and  knowledge  of  God,  and 
lead to a sense of God’s presence, and are worship. 

God  willing,  these  Risale-i  Nur  ‘Medreses’  will  secure  in  five  to  ten  weeks  the 
results  that  the  former  medreses  produced  in  five  to  ten  years  –and  they  have  been  so 
doing for twenty years. 

Also, it is essential that the Government does not interfere with these flashes of the 
Qur’an, the Risale-i Nur, which is the Qur’an’s herald and is beneficial in many ways for 
the worldly  and political  life of this  nation and country, and  for  its  life  in the hereafter. 
Indeed,  it  should  work  for  its  total  spread  and  acceptance,  so  that  it  may  atone  for  the 
grievous sins of the past, and form a barrier to the severe trials and anarchy of the future.

THE SIXTH TOPIC FROM  
THE FRUITS OF BELIEF 

 [This consists of a single, brief proof of the pillar of belief, ‘Belief in God,’ for 
which there are numerous decisive proofs and explanations in the Risale-i Nur.] 

In  Kastamonu  a  group  of  high-school  students  came  to  me,  saying:  “Tell  us  about 
our  Creator,  our  teachers  do  not  speak  of  God.”  I  said  to  them:  “All  the  sciences  you 
study  continuously  speak  of  God  and  make  known  the  Creator,  each  with  its  own 
particular tongue. Do not listen to your teachers; listen to them. 

“For example, a well-equipped pharmacy with life-giving potions and cures in every 
jar weighed out in precise and wondrous measures doubtless shows an extremely skilful, 
practised, and wise pharmacist. In the same way, to the extent that it is bigger and more 
perfect  and  better  stocked  than  the  pharmacy  in  the  market-place,  the  pharmacy  of  the 
globe of the earth with its living potions and medicaments in the jars which are the four 
hundred thousand species of plants and animals shows and makes known to eyes that are 
blind even – by means of the measure or scale of the science of medicine that you study – 
the All-Wise One of Glory, Who is the Pharmacist of the mighty pharmacy of the earth.  

“To take another example; a wondrous  factory which  weaves thousands of  sorts of 
cloth  from  a  simple  material  doubtless  makes  known  a  manufacturer  and  skilful 
mechanic.  In  the  same  way,  to  whatever  extent  it  is  larger  and  more  perfect  than  the 
human factory, this travelling dominical machine known as the globe of the earth with its 
hundreds of thousands of heads, in each of which are hundreds of thousands of factories, 
shows and makes known –by means of the measure or scale of the science of engineering 
which you study– its Manufacturer and Owner. 

“And,  for  example,  a  depot,  store, or  shop  in  which  has  been  brought together and 
stored  up  in  regular  and  orderly  fashion  a  thousand  and  one  varieties  of  provisions 
undoubtedly makes known a wondrous owner, proprietor, and overseer of provisions and 
foodstuffs.  In  just  the  same  way,  to  whatever  degree  it  is  vaster  and  more  perfect  than 
such a store or factory, this foodstore of the Most Merciful One known as the globe of the 
earth, this Divine ship, this dominical depot and shop holding goods, equipment, and  

 

170 

conserved  food,  which  in  one  year  travels  regularly  an  orbit  of  twenty-four  thousand 
years,  and  carrying  groups  of  beings  requiring  different  foods  and  passing  through  the 
seasons on its journey and filling the spring with thousands of different provisions like a 
huge waggon, brings them to the wretched animate creatures whose sustenance has been 
exhausted  in  winter,  –  by  means  of  the  measure  or  scale  of  the  science  of  economics 
which  you  study  –  this  depot of  the  earth  makes  known  and  makes  loved  its  Manager, 
Organizer, and Owner.      

“And, for example, let us imagine an army which consists of four hundred thousand 
nations,  and  each  nation  requires  different  provisions,  uses  different  weapons,  wears 
different uniforms, undergoes different drill, and is discharged from its duties differently. 
If  this  army  and  camp  has  a  miracle-working  commander  who  on  his  own  provides  all 
those  different  nations  with  all  their  different  provisions,  weapons,  uniforms,  and 
equipment without forgetting or confusing any of them, then surely the army and camp 
show  the  commander  and  make  him  loved  appreciatively.  In  just  the  same  way,  the 
spring camp of the face of the earth in which every spring a newly recruited Divine army 
of  the  four  hundred  thousand  species  of  plants  and  animals  are  given  their  varying 
uniforms,  rations,  weapons,  training,  and  demobilizations  in  utterly  perfect  and  regular 
fashion  by a single  Commander-in-Chief  Who forgets or confuses not one of them  – to 
whatever extent the spring camp of the face of the earth is vaster and more perfect than 
that  human  army,  –  by  means  of  the  measure  or  scale  of  the  military  science  that  you 
study – it makes known to the attentive and sensible, its Ruler, Sustainer, Administrator, 
and Most Holy Commander, causing wonderment and acclaim, and makes Him loved and 
praised and glorified. 

“Another  example:  millions  of  electric  lights  that  move  and  travel  through  a 
wondrous  city,  their  fuel  and  power  source  never  being  exhausted,  self-evidently  make 
known a wonder-working craftsman and extraordinarily talented electrician who manages 
the  electricity,  makes  the  moving  lamps,  sets  up  the  power  source,  and  brings  the  fuel; 
they cause others to congratulate and applaud him, and to love him. In just the same way, 
although some of the lamps of the stars in the roof of the palace of the world in the city of 
the universe –if they are considered in the way that astronomy says– are a thousand times 
larger than the earth and move seventy times faster than a cannon-ball, they do not spoil 
their  order,  nor  collide  with  one  another,  nor  become  extinguished,  nor  is  their  fuel 
exhausted.  According  to  astronomy,  which  you  study,  for  our  sun  to  continue  burning, 
which is a million times larger than the earth and a million times older and is a lamp and 
stove in one guest-house of the Most Merciful One, as much oil as the seas of the earth 
and  as  much  coal  as  its  mountains  or  as  many  logs  and  much  wood  as  ten  earths  are 
necessary for it not to be extinguished. And however much greater  

 

171 

and more perfect than this example are the electric lamps of the palace of the world in the 
majestic city of the universe, which point with their fingers of light to an infinite power 
and sovereignty which illuminates the sun and other lofty stars like it without oil, wood, 
or  coal,  not  allowing  them  to  be  extinguished  or  to  collide  with  one  another,  though 
travelling together at speed, to that degree – by  means of the  measure of the science of 
electricity  which  you  either  study  or  will  study  –  they  testify  to  and  make  known  the 
Monarch, Illuminator, Director, and Maker of the mighty exhibition of the universe; they 
make Him loved, glorified, and worshipped. 

“And, for example, take a book in every line of which a whole book is finely written, 
and in every word of which a sura of the Qur’an is inscribed with a fine pen. Being most 
meaningful  with all of  its  matters corroborating one another, and a wondrous collection 
showing  its  writer  and  author  to  be  extraordinarily  skilful  and  capable,  it  undoubtedly 
shows  its  writer  and  author  together  with  all  his  perfections  and  arts  as  clearly  as 
daylight,  and  makes  him  known.    It  makes  him  appreciated  with  phrases  like,  “What 
wonders God has willed!” and,  “Blessed  be God!” Just the  same  is the  mighty  book of 
the universe; we see with our eyes a pen at work which writes on the  face of the earth, 
which is a single of its pages, and on the spring, which is a single folio, the three hundred 
thousand  plant  and  animal  species,  which  are  like  three  hundred  thousand  different 
books, all together, one within the other, without fault or error, without mixing them up 
or confusing them, perfectly and with complete order, and sometimes writes an ode in a 
word like a tree, and the complete index of a book in a point like a seed. However much 
vaster and more perfect and meaningful than the book in the example mentioned above is 
this  compendium  of  the  universe  and  mighty  embodied  Qur’an  of  the  world,  which  is 
infinitely full of meaning and in every word of which are numerous instances of wisdom, 
to  that  degree  –in  accordance  with  the  extensive  measure  and  far-seeing  vision  of  the 
natural  science  that  you  study  and  the  sciences  of  reading  and  writing  that  you  have 
practised at school– it makes known the Inscriber and Author of the book of the universe 
together  with  His  infinite  perfections.  Proclaiming  ‘God  is  Most  Great!’,  it  makes  Him 
known.  Uttering  words  like  ‘Glory  be  to  God!’,  it  describes  Him.  Uttering  praises  like 
‘All praise be to God!’, it makes Him loved. 

“Thus, hundreds of other sciences like these make known the Glorious Creator of the 
universe together with His Names, each through its broad measure or scale, its particular 
mirror,  its  far-seeing  eyes,  and  searching  gaze;  they  make  known  His  attributes  and 
perfections. 

“It is in order to give instruction in this matter, which is a brilliant and magnificent 
proof  of  Divine  unity,  that  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  teaches  us  about  our 
Creator most often with the verses, Sustainer of the  

 

172 

Heavens  and  the  Earth,1  and,  He  created  the  Heavens  and  Earth.”2  I  said  this  to  the 
schoolboys, and they accepted it completely, affirming  it by saying:  “Endless thanks be 
to God, for we have received an absolutely true and sacred lesson. May God be pleased 
with you!” And I said: 

“Man  is  a  living  machine  who  is  grieved  with  thousands  of  different  sorrows  and 
receives  pleasure  in  thousands  of  different  ways;  and  despite  his  utter  impotence  has 
innumerable  enemies,  physical  and  spiritual;  and  despite  his  infinite  poverty,  has 
countless needs, external and inner; and is a wretched creature continuously suffering the 
blows  of  death  and  separation.  Yet,  through  belief  and  worship,  he  at  once  becomes 
connected to a Monarch  so Glorious  he  finds a point of support against all  his enemies 
and  a  source  of  help  for  all  his  needs,  and  like  everyone  takes  pride  at  the  honour  and 
rank of the lord to whom he is attached, you can compare for yourselves how pleased and 
grateful and thankful and full of pride man becomes at being connected through belief to 
an  infinitely  Powerful  and  Compassionate  Monarch,  at  entering  His  service  through 
worship,  and  transforming  for  himself  the  announcement  of  the  execution  of  the 
appointed hour into the papers releasing him from duty.” 

I repeat to the calamity-stricken prisoners what I said to the schoolboys: “One who 
recognizes Him and obeys Him is fortunate even if he is in prison. While one who forgets 
Him  is wretched and a prisoner even  if  he resides  in a palace.” Even, one wronged  but 
fortunate  man  said  to  the  wretched  tyrants  who  were  executing  him:  “I  am  not  being 
executed but being demobilized and departing for where I shall find happiness. But I see 
that  you  are  being  condemned  to  eternal  execution  and  am  therefore  taking  perfect 
revenge on you.” And declaring: “There is no god but God!”, he happily surrendered his 
spirit. 

Glory be unto You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught us; 
indeed, You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.3

THE AIR: 
A Window onto Divine Unity 

In His Name, be He glorified! 
And there is nothing but it glorifies Him with praise. 

My very dear and loyal brothers! 
My  brothers,  I  observed  in  a  subtle  point  concerning  God’s  unity,  which  suddenly 
became clear while studying the page of the air on a journey of the imagination and mind, 
that is, in the word HE (HU) in the phrases THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE, and, SAY HE 
IS GOD, (and that was only in its material aspect) that the way of belief is infinitely easy, 
easy  to  the  point  of  being  necessary,  and  that  the  way  of  misguidance  and  associating 
partners  with  God  is  infinitely  difficult,  so  difficult  as  to  be  impossible.  I  shall  explain 
that long and extensive point with an extremely brief indication. 

Yes,  if soil, one  handful of which can act as a  flower-pot for hundreds of plants  in 
turn, is attributed to nature or causes, it becomes necessary either for there to be present 
in such a handful hundreds of immaterial machines, indeed, machines and factories to the 
number  of  the  plants,  or  for  each  particle  of  that  small  amount of  soil  to  know  how  to 
make  all  those  different  plants  together  with  their  different  characteristics  and  living 
organs; quite simply, each would have to possess infinite knowledge and limitless power 
like a god. 

The  same  is  true  for  the  air,  which  is  a  place  of  maximum  manifestation  of  the 
Divine  will  and  command;  either  there  would  have  to  be  present  on  a  minute  scale  in 
each  of  its  molecules,  in  each  waft  of  wind,  each  breath,  and  in  the  tiny  amount  air 
expended with the word HE, the innumerable different exchanges, centres, receivers and 
transmitters  of  all  the  telephones,  telegraphs  and  radios  in  the  world  so that  each  could 
perform those innumerable acts at the same time; or else, each particle of each molecule 
of air exhaled with HE, and indeed of the element air, would have to possess abilities and 
personalities  to  the  number  of  all  the  different  telephone  users,  telegraphers,  and  those 
who speak on the radio, and know all their different languages, and broadcast them to the 
other particles at the same time. For such a situation is actually apparent, and every bit of 
air possesses that ability. Thus, in  

 

174 

the  ways  of  the  unbelievers,  Naturalists,  and  Materialists  not  one  impossibility,  but 
impossibilities and difficulties are clearly apparent to the number of molecules of air. 

If attributed to the All-Glorious Maker, however, the air together with all its particles 
becomes  a  soldier  under  His  command.  With  its  Creator’s  permission  and  through  His 
power, and through being connected to its Creator and relying on Him, and through the 
manifestation of its Maker’s Power, in an instant with the speed of lightning, and with the 
ease  of  uttering  the  word  HE  and  the  movement  of  the  air  in  waves,  its  innumerable 
universal  duties  are  performed  as  easily  as  an  orderly,  single  duty  of  a  single  particle. 
That is to say, the air becomes a page for the endless, wonderful, and orderly writings of 
the pen of power, and its particles become the nibs of the pen, and their duties the points 
inscribed by it. The air functions as easily as the movement of a single particle.  

Thus, while on my journey of contemplation prompted by the phrases THERE IS NO 
GOD  BUT  HE,  and,  SAY,  HE  IS  GOD,  and  while  observing  the  world  of  the  air  and 
studying  the  page  of  that  element,  I  witnessed  this  brief  truth  with  utter  certainty  and 
clarity, and in detail. And I understood with ‘knowledge of certainty’ that it was because 
there  is  in  the  word  HE,  in  the  air  of  its  utterance,  such  a  brilliant  proof  and  flash  of 
Divine  unity,  and  also  in  its  meaning  and  allusions  such  a  luminous  manifestation  of 
Divine oneness and powerful proof of Divine unity, and  in that proof an  indication that 
since the pronoun HE is unconditional and indefinite, it suggests the question, “Who does 
it  refer  to?”  that  both  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  and  those  who  constantly 
recite the Divine Names frequently repeat this sacred word in the station of unity. 

If,  for example, there  is one point on a piece of  white paper and two or three other 
points are jumbled around with it and then someone who already has numerous jobs tries 
to  distinguish  them,  he  will  be  confused;  and  if  many  burdens  are  loaded  on  a  small 
creature, it will be crushed; and if numerous words issue from one tongue and enter one 
ear altogether at the same time, their order will be broken and they will be a muddle. 

Despite  this  being  the  case,  I  saw  with  complete  certainty  that  with  the  key  and 
compass of HE, although thousands of different points, letters and words had been put in 
each molecule –and even in each particle– of the element air, through which I journeyed 
in  my  mind,  neither  did  they  become  mixed  up  nor  did  they  spoil  their  order;  and 
although  they  performed  a  great  many  different  duties,  these  were  carried  out  without 
being  confused  in  any way; and although  very  heavy  loads were  laid on each  molecule 
and particle, they  bore them in order without lagging or displaying any weakness at all. 
And I saw that thousands of different words of all different sorts enter and  

 

175 

issue  with  perfect  order  from  what  is  in  effect  those  minute  ears  and  tongues  without 
being mixed up and spoilt in any way, they enter those minute ears and issue from those 
tiny  tongues,  and  by  performing  these  extraordinary  duties,  each  particle  and  each 
molecule declares through the enraptured tongue of its being and its perfect freedom, and 
through the testimony and tongue of the above truth: THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE, and: 
SAY,  HE  IS  GOD,  THE  ONE,  and  travels  among  air-clashing  waves  like  storms  and 
lightning and thunder without  in any  way  spoiling their order or confusing their duties. 
One duty is not an obstacle to another duty. I observed this and was utterly certain.  

That  is  to  say,  either  every  particle  and  piece  of  the  air  has  to  possess  infinite 
wisdom,  knowledge,  will,  and  power,  and  the  qualities  for  being  absolutely  dominant 
over all the other particles so that it can be the means of those functions being carried out, 
which  is  absurd  and  impossible  to  the  number  of  particles,  and  no  devil  even  could 
imagine it, or else, and it is self-evident to the degree of ‘knowledge of certainty,’ ‘vision 
of  certainty,’  and  ‘absolute  certainty’  that  the  page  of  the  air  functions  through  the 
boundless, infinite knowledge and wisdom of the All-Glorious One, and is the changing 
page for the pen of Divine Power and Determining, and like a signboard for writing and 
erasing, known as a Tablet of Appearance and Dissolution, which has the function of the 
Preserved Tablet in the world of transformation and change. 

Thus,  just  as  the  element  of  air  demonstrates  the  above-mentioned  wonders  and 
manifestation  of  Divine  unity  in  only  the  duty  of  transmitting  sound  and  shows  the 
impossibilities of misguidance, so does it perform other important duties with order and 
without  confusing  them,  such  as  transmitting  subtle  forces  and  energy,  like  electricity, 
light,  and  the  forces  of  attraction  and  repulsion.  At  the  same  time  as  conveying  these, 
with perfect order, it carries out duties essential for the lives of plants and animals, such 
as respiration and pollination. It proves in decisive fashion that it is a place of maximum 
manifestation  of  the  Divine  will  and  command.  I  came  to  the  firm  conclusion  that  it 
proves that in no way is there any possibility of vagrant chance, blind force, deaf nature, 
confused and aimless causes, and powerless, lifeless, unknowing matter interfering in the 
writing and duties of the page of the air. And I understood that every particle and part of 
it  says  with  the  tongue  of  its  being:  SAY,  HE  IS GOD,  THE  ONE,  and:  THERE  IS  NO 
GOD BUT HE. Just as with the key of HE I saw these wonders in the material aspect of 
the air, so also, as a HE, did the element of air become a key to the World of Similitudes 
and the World of Meaning. 

I  saw that the  World  of  Similitudes  is  all  the  time  taking  innumerable  photographs 
without confusing them, and that each photograph contains innumerable events occurring 
in this world. I understood that it was a  

 

176 

gigantic  camera,  and  a  vast  cinema  of  the  hereafter  thousands  of  times  larger  than  the 
world  for showing  in eternal theatres the fruits of the transitory and  impermanent states 
and lives of ephemeral beings, for showing to those enjoying everlasting bliss in Paradise 
scenes from their old memories and adventures in this world.1 

While  the  faculties  of  memory  and  imagination,  which  are  two  proofs,  two  small 
examples,  and  two  points  of  both  the  Preserved  Tablet  and  the  World  of  Similitudes 
situated in man’s head, are as tiny as lentils, within them are written in perfect order and 
without being mixed up as much information as may be contained in a large library. This 
proves decisively that large examples of those faculties are the World of Similitudes and 
the Preserved Tablet. 

It  is  definite  and  certain  with  ‘knowledge  of  certainty’  that the  elements  of  air  and 
water, and the element air and water like seminal fluid in particular, are far superior to the 
element of earth, and are written with more wisdom and will, and with the pen of Divine 
Determining and Power, and that it is completely impossible for chance, blind force, deaf 
nature, and lifeless and aimless causes to interfere in them, and that they are a page of the 
pen of Power and the wisdom of the All-Wise One of Glory. 

                                                
1 Since the time and place and conditions do not allow this to be proven with firm proofs and arguments 
like clear facts, it is cut short here.

The Fourteenth Word 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
Alif.  Lam.  Ra.  [This  is]  a  Book  with  verses  fundamental  [of  established 
meaning]. Further explained in detail, from One All-Wise and Well-Acquainted 
[with all things].1 

 [In order to ascend to some of the elevated truths of the All-Wise Qur’an, and 
of  Hadiths,  which  are  the  true  expounder  of  the  Qur’an,  we  shall  point  out  a 
number  of  comparisons  of  those  truths  which  are  like  steps  to  assist  hearts 
deficient  in submission and  obedience, and shall  explain  in the Conclusion an 
object lesson and a mystery concerning Divine favour. Since from among those 
truths,  comparisons  of  the  Resurrection  and  the  Day  of  Judgement  have  been 
mentioned in the Tenth Word, and its Ninth Truth in particular, there is no need 
to  repeat  them.  Here  we  shall  mention  only  five  ‘Matters’  as  examples  of  the 
other truths.] 

THE FIRST: For example, in order to induce certainty about the verse, 

He created the heavens and the earth in six days,2 

and  the  elevated  truth  it  alludes  to  through  the  Qur’anic  days,  which  consist  of  a  long 
period of time like perhaps a thousand or fifty thousand years, that man’s world and that 
of  the  animals  will  last  six  days,  we  draw  attention  to  the  travelling  worlds,  transient 
universes, and passing cosmoses which the Glorious Maker creates every day, every year, 
every century, each of which is like a day. It is as though these worlds are all guests like 
man. At the All-Glorious One’s command, each season the world is filled and emptied. 

THE SECOND:  For example, the verses, 

Nor anything fresh or dry but is [inscribed] in a Record Clear.3 * And  

                                                
1 Qur’an, 11:1. 
2 Qur’an, 7:54. 
3 Qur’an, 6:59. 

 

178 

of  all  things  have  We  taken  account  in  a  Clear  Book.4  *  From  Whom  is  not 
hidden the least little atom in the heavens or on earth; nor is there anything less 
than that, or greater, but it is in the Record Clear.5 

In  order  to  be  convinced  of  the  elevated  truth  which  these  verses  state,  that,  “All 
things  together  with  all  their  states  are  recorded before  they  come  into  existence,  when 
they come into existence, and after they have departed; and they are being recorded,” we 
point  out  to  be  observed  the  All-Glorious  Inscriber’s  including  and  preserving  in 
immaterial  fashion  in  the  seeds  and  roots  of  the  innumerable  well-ordered  creatures 
which He changes every  season on the page of the earth, and particularly  in the spring, 
the indexes of their beings, life-histories, and principles according to which they act; and 
when  they  die  His  inscribing  in  immaterial  fashion  with  the  same  pen  of  Divine 
Determining those indexes, life-histories and principles in the simple seeds in their fruits; 
and  every  passing  spring  even  His  preserving  them  –whether  fresh  or  dry–  in  perfect 
order in seeds like dry chips of wood and bones, limited and tiny. It is as if each spring is 
attached like a flower to the face of the earth in extremely orderly and balanced fashion 
by the hand of One All-Beautiful and All-Glorious, then plucked from it; each is placed 
on  it,  then  removed.  While  the  reality  is  this,  one  of  the  strangest  forms  of  man’s 
misguidance  is  that  he  calls  this  natural  writing,  this  inscribing  full  of  art,  this  passive 
pattern  of  wisdom  which  is  an  index  of  dominical  art  and  only  a  reflection  and 
manifestation  of  the  Preserved  Tablet,  ‘nature’,  and  considers  it  to  be  the  source  and 
active and effective. Can there be any comparison between the ground and the Pleiades? 
Can there be any comparison between reality and the views of the heedless? 

THE  THIRD:    For  example,  in  order  to  ascend  to  the  truth  which  the  Bringer  of 
Sure News described concerning the  Bearers of the Throne, the angels appointed to the 
earth  and  the  skies,  and  other  sorts  of  angels,  stating  that  they  glorify  God  with  forty 
thousand heads, and with the forty thousand tongues in each head, and in forty thousand 
ways with each tongue, consider the following carefully. Through verses like, 

The seven heavens and the earth and all within them glorify and extol Him.6 * It 
was We Who made the hills declare in unison with him Our praises.7 * We did 
indeed offer the Trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains,8 

the All-Glorious One expresses clearly that even the greatest and most  

                                                
4 Qur’an, 36:12. 
5 Qur’an, 34:3. 
6 Qur’an, 17:44. 
7 Qur’an, 38:18. 
8 Qur’an, 33:72. 

 

179 

universal  of  beings  demonstrate  that  they  glorify  Him  in  accordance  with  their 
universality and in a way appropriate to their vastness. And it appears to be thus. Just as 
the  words  of  glorification  of  the  heavens,  which  are  an  ocean  glorifying  God,  are  the 
suns,  moons,  and  stars,  so  the  words  of  praise  of  the  earth,  a  flying  thing  praising  and 
glorifying, are the animals, plants and trees. That is to say, just as the trees and stars all 
perform  particular  forms  of  glorification,  so  does  the  earth  and  every  part  of  the  earth, 
and  all  the  mountains  and  valleys,  and  the  land  and  the  sea,  and  the  spheres  of  the 
firmament  and  the  constellations  in  the  heavens  all  perform  universal  forms  of 
glorification. The earth, which possesses these thousands of  heads containing thousands 
of tongues, certainly has an angel appointed to it who translates and displays in the World 
of Similitudes the flowers of glorification and fruits of praise it performs with each, and 
who represents and proclaims them in the World of Spirits. 

Indeed, if numerous things take on the form of a collectivity, a collective personality 
comes  into  being.  If  such  a  collectivity  fuses  and  becomes  a  unity,  it  will  have  a 
collective personality and a sort of spirit which will represent it, and an appointed angel 
who will perform its duty of glorification. As an example, consider the plane-tree in front 
of my room here, a mighty word of the mouth of Barla and the tongue of this mountain: 
see how many hundreds of tongues of smaller branches there are on the three heads of the 
three main  branches of  its trunk. Study carefully  how  many  hundreds of words of well-
ordered and balanced fruits it has, and how many hundreds of letters of well-proportioned 
winged  seeds;  just  as  you  hear  and  see  how  eloquently  it  praises  and  glorifies  the  All-
Glorious  Maker,  the  Owner  of  the  command  of  “Be!”  and  it  is,  so  too  the  angel 
appointed  to  it  represents  its  glorification  with  numerous  tongues  in  the  World  of 
Meaning. Wisdom necessitates that it is so. 

THE FOURTH:  For example, consider the elevated truth expressed by verses like: 
Indeed,  His  command  when  He  wills  a  thing,  is,  “Be!”,  and  it  is.9  *  And  the 
decision of the Hour is as the twinkling of an eye.10 * And We are closer to him 
than  his  jugular  vein.11  *  The  angels  ascend  to  Him  in  a  day  the  measure  of 
which is fifty thousand years,12 

which is that the Absolutely Powerful One creates things with such ease and speed, with 
such facility and lack of trouble, that it appears and is understood that He creates with a 
mere command. Also, although the All- 

                                                
9 Qur’an, 36:82. 
10 Qur’an, 16:77. 
11 Qur’an, 50:16. 
12 Qur’an, 70:4. 

 

180 

Powerful  Maker  is  infinitely  close  to  beings,  they  are  infinitely  distant  from  him. 
Furthermore, despite His infinite might and glory, attaching importance to them, He also 
sets in order the most insignificant and lowly matters, and does not deny them the beauty 
of His art. Thus, the perfect order within absolute ease observed in beings testifies to the 
existence of this Qur’anic truth. The following comparison demonstrates its meaning and 
wisdom.  For  example,  And  God’s  is  the  highest  similitude,  the  duties  the  sun  displays 
through the dominical command and Divine subjugation, which is like a dense mirror to 
the  Divine  Name  of  Light  among  the  All-Glorious  Maker’s  Most  Beautiful  Names, 
brings this truth closer to the understanding. It is as follows: 

Although  through  its  elevatedness,  the  sun  is  infinitely  close  to  all  transparent  and 
shining  things,  indeed,  is  closer  to  them  than  their  own  selves,  and  although  it  has  an 
effect on them in numerous ways like through its manifestation, its image, and power of 
disposal, those transparent objects are thousands of years distant from it, they can in no 
way  have  an  effect  on  it,  they  cannot  claim  to  be  close  to  it.  Also,  the  sun’s  being  as 
though present and seeing in all transparent particles, and wherever its light enters even, 
is  understood  through  the  sun’s  reflection  and  its  image  being  apparent  in  accordance 
with the particles’ capacities and colours. Furthermore, the sun’s comprehensiveness and 
penetration increase to the vast extent of its luminosity. It is because of the greatness of 
its  luminosity  that  the  tiniest  things  cannot  hide  or  escape  from  it.  This  means  that 
through  the  mystery  of  luminosity  its  immense  vastness  does  not  exclude  even 
insignificant  and  tiny  things;  on  the  contrary,  it  takes  them  within  the  sphere  of  its 
comprehension. Moreover, if to suppose the impossible we were to imagine the sun acted 
with  will  in  the  tasks  and  manifestations  its  displays,  with  Divine  permission  it  would 
function with such ease and speed and breadth in everything from particles and droplets 
and the surface of the sea to the planets, that it would be supposed that it performed these 
mighty disposals through a mere command. A particle and a planet would be equal before 
its command. The effulgence it would bestow on the surface of the sea, it would bestow 
also with perfect order on a particle in accordance with the particle’s capacity. 

Thus, we see that the sun, which is a luminous bubble in the seas of the skies and a 
small and dense  mirror to the  manifestation of the Absolutely Powerful One’s Name of 
Light,  observedly  displays  examples  of  the  three  principles  of  this  truth.  So  we  surely 
believe with complete certainty as though witnessing it that the All-Glorious One, Who is 
the Light of Light, the Illuminator of Light, the Determiner of Light, and in comparison 
to Whose knowledge and power the sun’s  light and  heat  is  like  earth,  is all-present and 
all-seeing and infinitely close to all things with His knowledge and power, and that things 
are utterly distant from Him, and that He does  

 

181 

things with such ease and facility that it is understood He creates with the ease and speed 
of  a  mere  command,  and  that  nothing  at  all,  great or  small,  particular  or  universal,  can 
escape from the sphere of His power, and that His magnificence encompasses all things. 
And this has to be believed. 

THE FIFTH:  While the limits of the vastness of the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and 

Post-Eternity’s dominicality and the tremendousness of His Godhead stretch from, 

No just estimate have they made of God, such as is due to Him: on the Day of 
Judgement the whole of the earth will be but His handful, and the heavens  will 
be rolled up in His right hand 13 

And know that God comes between man and his heart,14 

God  is  the  Creator  of  All  Things,  and  He  is  the Guardian  and  Disposer  of  all 
affairs,15 

[God] knows what they hide as well as what they disclose,16 

[Who] created the heavens and the earth,17 

God has created you and what you do,18 

God has willed this! There is no power but with God,19 

But you will not, except as God wills,20 

what is the purpose of His stern complaints and severe and awesome threats in the Qur’an 
against the sons of Adam, so impotent and infinitely weak and utterly poor and endlessly 
needy,  who  possess  only  partial  will  and  have  no  power  to  create?  In  what  way  is  it 
conformable,  and  how  is  it  appropriate?  In  order  to  be  convinced  of  this  profound  and 
elevated truth, consider the following two comparisons: 

First  Comparison:  For  example,  there  was  a  royal  garden  in  which  innumerable 

fruit-bearing and flowering things were found. Many servants were  

to,  

and from,  

to, 

to, 

to, 

and from,  

and from, 

                                                
13 Qur’an, 39:67. 
14 Qur’an, 8:24. 
15 Qur’an, 39:62. 
16 Qur’an, 2:77, etc. 
17 Qur’an, 7:54, etc. 
18 Qur’an, 37:96. 
19 Qur’an, 18:39. 
20 Qur’an, 76:30. 

 

182 

appointed to attend to it. The duty of one of the servants was only to open the water canal 
so  that  the  water  could  spread  throughout  the  garden  and  be  benefited  from.  But  the 
servant was lazy and did not open the canal, so harm came to the growth of the garden, or 
else it dried up. All the other servants had the right to complain, not about the Creator’s 
dominical art and the Sultan’s royal supervision and the obedient service of the light, air, 
and earth, but about that foolish  servant, for their duties were all  made  fruitless, or else 
harm came to them. 

Second  Comparison:  For  example,  if,  through  abandoning  his  minor  duty  on  a 
mighty royal ship, a common man causes harm to come to the results of the duties of all 
the others employed on the ship, and some of them even are made to come to nothing, the 
ship’s owner will complain bitterly about him in the name of all the others. And the one 
at fault cannot say: “I’m just an ordinary person. I don’t deserve this severity because of 
my unimportant omission.” For a single instance of non-existence results in innumerable 
such  instances,  whereas  existence  yields  results  in  accordance  with  itself.  For  although 
the existence of a thing is dependent on the existence of all the conditions and causes, its 
non-existence, its removal, occurs with the removal of a single condition and results from 
the  non-existence  of  a  single  particular.  It  is  because  of  this  that  ‘destruction  is  much 
easier  than  repair’  has  become  like  a  universally  accepted  principle.  Since  the  bases  of 
unbelief  and  misguidance,  and  rebellion  and  sin  are  denial  and  rejection,  they  are  an 
abandoning  and  non-acceptance.  However  positive  and  possessing  of  existence  they 
appear superficially, in reality they are removal and non-existence. In which case they are 
a contagious crime. Just as they cause harm to the results of the acts of other beings, so 
they draw a veil over the manifestation of the beauties of the Divine Names. 

The  Monarch  of  Beings,  Whose  right  it  is  to  make  these  innumerable  complaints, 
therefore  utters  awesome  complaints  about  rebellious  man  in  the  name  of  those  beings. 
And to do so is perfect wisdom. Rebellious man is certainly deserving of His severe and 
awesome threats; without doubt he deserves them. 

 

183 

Conclusion 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
And what are the goods of this world but the goods of deception?21 

 [A slap for the heedless and a warning lesson] 

O my wretched soul sunk in heedlessness, which sees this life as sweet, has forgotten 
the hereafter, and seeks only this world! Do you know what you resemble? An ostrich! It 
sees the hunter, but cannot fly, so sticks it head in the sand so the hunter will not see it. 
Its bulky body remains in the open, and the hunter sees it. Only, its eyes are closed in the 
sand and it cannot see him. O my soul, consider the following comparison, and see it! 

Restricting one’s view to this world transforms a great pleasure into a grievous pain. 
For  example,  there  are  two  men  in  this  village,  that  is,  in  Barla.  Ninety-nine  out  of  a 
hundred of the friends of one of them have gone to Istanbul, where they are living in fine 
fashion. Only one has remained here, and he too will go there. For this reason, the man 
longs  for  Istanbul  and  thinks  of  it;  he  wants  to  join  his  friends.  When  he  is  told  to  go 
there, he is overjoyed and goes happily. As for the second man, ninety-nine of his friends 
have  departed  from  here.  But  some  have  perished,  and  some  have  been  put  in  places 
where they neither see nor are seen. He imagines that they have departed and disappeared 
in utter misery. This wretched man becomes friendly with a single guest in place of all of 
them, and wants to find consolation. Through him he wants to forget his grievous pain of 
separation. 

O my soul! Foremost God’s Beloved, and all your friends, are beyond the grave. The 
one  or  two  who  remain  will  also  depart  for  there.  So  do  not  be  frightened  of  death, 
anxious at the grave, and avert your head. Look manfully at the grave, and listen to what 
it  seeks.  Laugh  in  death’s  face  like  a  man,  and  see  what  it  wants.  Beware,  do  not  be 
heedless and resemble the second man. 

O  my  soul! Do not say, “The times have changed, this age  is different, everyone  is 
plunged  into  this  world  and  worships  this  life.  Everyone  is  drunk  with  the  struggle  for 
livelihood.” For death does not change. Separation is not  

                                                
21 Qur’an, 3:185. 

 

184 

transformed  into  permanence  and  does  not  become  different.  Man’s  impotence  and 
poverty do not change, they increase. Man’s journey is not cut, it becomes faster. 

Also, do not say, “I am like everyone else.” For everyone befriends you only as far 
as the grave, and the consolation of being together with everyone else in disaster has no 
meaning beyond the grave. And do not suppose yourself to be free and independent. For 
if  you  look  at  this  guest-house  of  the  world  with  the  eye  of  wisdom,  you  will  see  that 
nothing  at  all  is  without  order  and  without  purpose.  How  can  you  remain  outside  the 
order and be without purpose? Events in the world like earthquakes are not the playthings 
of chance. For example, you see that the extremely well-ordered and finely embroidered 
shirts, one over the other and one within the other, which are clothed on the earth from 
the  species  of  animals  and  plants,  are  adorned  and  decked  out  from  top to  bottom  with 
purposes  and  instances  of  wisdom,  and  you  know  that  the  earth  revolves  and  is  turned 
like an ecstatic Mevlevi in perfect order within most exalted aims. How is it then, as an 
atheist  published,  they  suppose  the  death-tainted  events  of  the  earth,  like  the 
earthquake,22 which resembles the earth’s shaking off itself the weight of certain forms of 
heedlessness of which it disapproves from mankind, and especially from the believers, to 
be without purpose and the result of chance? How is it that they show the grievous losses 
of  all  those  stricken  to  be  without  recompense  and  to  have  gone  for  nothing,  and  cast 
them into a fearsome despair? They are both making a great error and perpetrating a great 
wrong.  Indeed,  such  events  occur  at  the  command  of  One  All-Wise  and  All-
Compassionate,  in  order  to  transform  the  transient  property  of  the  believers  into  the 
equivalent of alms, and make it permanent. And they are atonement for their sins arising 
from ingratitude for bounties. Just as a day will come when this subjugated earth will see 
the works of man, which are the adornment of its face, to be tainted by the attributing of 
partners  to  God  and  not  to  be  the  cause  of  thanks,  and  it  will  find  them  ugly.  At  the 
Creator’s  command,  it  will  wipe  them  off  its  entire  face  and  cleanse  it.  At  God’s 
command, it will pour those who attribute partners to God into Hell, and say to those who 
offer thanks, “Come and enter Paradise!” 

                                                
22 This was written in connection with the Izmir earthquake.

The Addendum to the Fourteenth Word 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate 
When the earth is shaken to its [utmost] convulsion, * And the  earth throws up 
its burdens [from within], * And man cries [distressed] “What is the matter with 
it?” * On that Day will it declare its tidings. * For that your Sustainer will have 
given it inspiration.23 

This Sura states definitely that in its movements and earthquakes the earth shakes at 

a command, on receiving revelation and inspiration. And sometimes it trembles. 

 [Prompted by an inspiration, the answers occurred to me to six or seven minor 
questions related to the current earthquakes, importantly from the point of view 
of  their  meaning.  Although  on  several  occasions  I  intended  to  write  them  in 
detail, permission was not given, so they have been written briefly and in short.] 

First  Question:    More  distressing  than  the  material  disaster  of  the  present  severe 
earthquake  are  its  immaterial  aspects;  the  fear  and  despair  at  further  earthquakes  is 
destroying the nightly rest of most of the people in most areas. What is the reason for this 
terrible torment? 

The  Answer,  again  in  regard  to  its  Meaning:  It  has  been  said  that  the  drunken, 
licentious songs, some of which were performed by girls, being broadcast rapturously by 
means of the radio during the tarawih prayers of the month of Ramadan in every corner 
of this blessed centre of Islam resulted in the torment of this fear. 

Second Question:  Why aren’t these heavenly blows dealt at the unbelievers in their 

countries? Why are they visited on the unhappy Muslims? 

The Answer:  Just as the requital for big mistakes and crimes is postponed and made 
in  big  centres,  and  the  requital  for  small  crimes  is  made  quickly  in  small  centres,  as  a 
consequence of an  important instance of wisdom, the recompense of the greater part of 
the unbelievers’ crimes is  

                                                
23 Qur’an, 99:1-5. 

 

186 

postponed to the Last Judgement, while the punishment for the believers’ faults is in part 
given in this world.24 

Third  Question:    What  is  the  reason  for  this  disaster,  which  arises  from  the 
wrongdoing of a few individuals, occurring to a degree generally throughout the country? 
The Answer:  The general disaster results from the wrongdoing of the majority: most 
people  in  effect  participate  in  the  actions  of  those  tyrannical  individuals  by  supporting 
them either actively or morally or in some connection. 

Fourth Question:  Since this disaster of an earthquake results from wrongdoing and 
is atonement for sins, why are the innocent and those not at fault struck by it? How does 
Divine justice permit this? 

The  Answer,  again  in  regard  to  its  meaning:    Since  this  matter  concerns  the 

mystery of Divine Determining, we refer you to the Risale-i Nur and here only say this: 

And  fear  tumult  or  oppression,  which  affects  not  in  particular  [only]  those  of 
you who do wrong.25 

That  is,  beware  of  the  calamity  or  disaster  which  when  it  occurs  is  not  restricted  to 
wrongdoers but strikes the innocent as well. 

The  meaning  of  the  above  verse  is  as  follows:  this  world  is  a  field  of  trial  and 
examination,  and  a  place  of  striving  where  man  is  accountable  for  his  actions. 
Accountability  and  examination  require  that  reality  remains  veiled  so  that  through 
competition and striving the Abu Bakr’s may rise to the highest of the high and the Abu 
Jahl’s  may  enter  among  the  lowest  of  the  low.  If  the  innocent  remained  untouched  by 
such  disasters,  the  Abu  Jahl’s  would  submit  just  like  the  Abu  Bakr’s,  and  the  door  of 
spiritual  and  moral  progress  through  striving  would  be  closed  and  the  mystery  of 
accountability spoiled. 

Since Divine wisdom requires that oppressed and oppressor are together afflicted by 

disaster, what then is the share of the wretched oppressed of Divine mercy and justice? 

It was said in reply to this question: for them there is a manifestation of mercy within 

the wrath and anger in the disaster. For just as the transient pro 

perty  of  the  innocent  becomes  like  alms  and  gains  permanence,  the  relatively  little 

and temporary difficulty and torment is a form of martyrdom for them  

                                                
24 Furthermore, in abandoning an abrogated and corrupted religion, people like the Russians do not incur 
Divine wrath to the extent of those who betray a true and eternal religion which may not be abrogated. 
Thus, the earth leaves them at present, and displays its anger towards those here. 
25 Qur’an, 8:25. 

 

187 

which also gains for their transient lives a permanent life. The earthquake earns for them 
a huge, perpetual profit, so for them is an instance of Divine mercy within the wrath. 

Fifth  Question:    Why  does  the  One  Who  is  All-Just  and  All-Compassionate,  All-
Powerful and All-Wise, not give particular punishments for particular wrongs, but inflicts 
a  mighty  element?  How  is  this  in  keeping  with  the  beauty  of  His  mercy  and  His  all-
encompassing power? 

The Answer:  The All-Powerful One of Glory gives numerous duties to each element 
and through each duty causes them to produce numerous different results. If one result of 
one of an  element’s duties  is ugly, evil, or calamitous, the other good results  make this 
result good also. If the element, which is angry at man, is prevented from that duty so that 
the  single  ugly  result  will  not occur, then  instances  of  good to the  number  of  the  good 
results will  be abandoned, and so since  not doing a necessary good is evil,  instances of 
evil  will  be  perpetrated  to  the  number  of  the  instances  of  good.  A  single  evil  not 
occurring would be extremely ugly, contrary to wisdom, contrary to reality, and a fault. 
And power, wisdom and reality are free of fault. Since certain errors constitute rebellion 
comprehensive  enough  to  make  the  earth  and  elements  angry,  and  are  insulting 
aggression against the rights of numerous creatures, for sure, in order to demonstrate the 
extraordinary ugliness of such a crime, the command being given to a mighty element to 
“reprimand them” among its other general duties, is perfect wisdom and justice, and for 
the oppressed, perfect mercy. 

Sixth  Question:    The  neglectful  and  heedless  put  it  about  that  the  earthquake 
resulted from a fault in the rock strata inside the earth, and look upon it as quite simply a 
chance event, natural, and without purpose. They do not see the non-material causes and 
results,  so  that  they  can  come  to  their  senses.  Does  ‘matter’,  on  which  they  base  their 
views, have some reality? 

The Answer:  It has no reality other than misguidance for the following reason. Take 
the fly out of all the species on the earth, which each year is clothed in and changes more 
than fifty million finely embroidered well-ordered shirts: the intention, will, purpose, and 
wisdom manifested on the wing of a single fly, which is only one organ out of hundreds 
of one individual fly out of the countless numbers of all flies on the face of the earth, the 
fact that it is not neglected or left to its own devices, shows that the significant acts and 
states of the huge globe of the earth, which is the cradle, mother, place of recourse, and 
protector  of  innumerable  conscious  beings  –  no  aspect  of  it  whether  particular  or 
universal – can be outside the Divine will, choice, and purpose. However, as is required 
by  His  wisdom,  the  Possessor  of  absolute  power  makes  apparent  causes  a  veil  to  His 
disposals. When He wills an earthquake, and sometimes He does, He commands the  

 

188 

movement of the strata and ignites them. Even if it results from this movement or a fault 
in  the  strata,  it  is  still  at  the  Divine  command  and  in  accordance  with  His  wisdom;  it 
cannot occur in any other way.  

For  example,  one  man  shot  another  with  a  rifle.  If  the  man  who  fired  the  shot  is 
entirely  disregarded,  and  only  the  gunpowder  in  the  bullet  igniting  is  taken  into 
consideration,  the  rights  of  the  wretched  victim  would  be  completely  violated,  and  it 
would  be  the  epitome  of  foolishness.  In  just  the  same  way,  to  forget  the  dominical 
command  concerning  the  earth,  which  is  a  docile  official  of  the  All-Powerful  One  of 
Glory, rather, a ship or an aeroplane of His:  “Explode a bomb  inside the earth prepared 
through wisdom and will in order to arouse the heedless and the rebellious;” to forget this 
and to deviate into ‘nature’, is the very peak of stupidity. 

An Addition and Footnote to the Sixth Question: In order to defend their way and 
counter the awakening of the believers and  hinder them, the people of  misguidance and 
the  atheists  display  an  obduracy  so  strange  and  a  stupidity  so  peculiar  that  it  makes  a 
person regret his humanity. For example, in order to make men give up their wicked and 
wrongful rebellion which recently has to a degree taken on a general form, and to arouse 
mankind and make it forego this awesome revolt and recognize the universe’s Sovereign, 
Whom  it  does  not  want to  recognize,  the  Creator  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth  –not on 
account of a particular title but as Sustainer and Ruler of the whole universe and all the 
worlds  and  through  a  widespread  and  general  manifestation  throughout  the  universe  in 
the universal sphere of His dominicality– has struck mankind in the face with awesome 
and widespread calamities like earthquakes, storms, and world wars through the universal 
elements  coming  to  anger  –through  water,  the  air,  and  electricity,  which  are  matchless 
and  constant–  and  has  demonstrated  through  them  in  most  clear  fashion  His  wisdom, 
power, justice, and self-subsistence. Although this is the case, certain brainless satans in 
human  form  respond  to  these  universal  dominical  signs  and  divine  reprimands  with  a 
foolish obstinacy, saying:  

“It’s nature. It’s the explosion of some strata under the earth and just chance. It’s the 
sun’s  heat  clashing  with  electricity,  which  happened  in  America  and  brought  all 
machinery  to  a  standstill  for  five  hours,  and  also  caused  the  atmosphere  in  Kastamonu 
Province  to  turn  red  and  take  on  the  appearance  of  a  conflagration.”  They  utter 
meaningless nonsense like this. Due to a boundless ignorance resulting from misguidance 
and an ugly obduracy arising from aggressive atheism, they do not know that causes are 
only each a pretext and a veil. A small seed taking the place of a village full of factories 
and looms to weave and produce the members of a pine-tree as large as a mountain shows 
this.  By  saying,  “The  tree  emerged  from  the  seed,”  they  in  effect  deny  the  thousand 
miracles displayed  in the pine tree, and put forward a number of apparent causes. They 
reduce to nothing a  

 

189 

huge  dominical  act  worked  through  the  Creator’s  will  and  wisdom.  Sometimes  they 
attach a scientific name to a most profound, unknowable, and important truth which has 
purposes  in  a  thousand  respects,  as  though  through  the  name  it  has  been  understood. 
Whereas it is merely made commonplace, and without purpose, wisdom, or meaning. 

So, come and see the innumerable degrees of stupidity and foolishness! They attach a 
name to a truth so profound and broad and unknown  it could  be completely understood 
only if it and its purposes and instances of wisdom were described in a hundred pages. As 
though  it  were  something  obvious  they  say:  “It  is  this.”  For  example,  “It  is  some 
substance in the sun clashing with electricity.” Furthermore, they ascribe a particular and 
intentional  dominical  event  to  one  of  the  natural  laws,  which  are  each  the  titles  of 
universal and all-encompassing will and universal sovereignty, and are known as ‘Divine 
laws.’ And by doing this they sever its connection with Divine will and choice, then refer 
it to chance and nature. They display an ignorance more profound than Abu Jahl. It is a 
rebellious  foolishness  like  attributing  the  victorious  battle  of  an  individual  soldier  or  a 
battalion  to  military  regulations  and  discipline,  and  cutting  its  connection  with  the 
commander, king, government, and purposeful action. 

Similarly,  if  a  wonder-working  craftsman  produces  a  hundred  okkas26  of  various 
foodstuffs  and  a  hundred  yards  of  varying  cloths  from  a  chip  of  wood  the  size  of 
fingernail, like the creation of a fruitbearing tree from a seed, and someone points to the 
chip of wood and declares that these things have come into being out of it ‘naturally’ and 
‘through chance,’ reducing to nothing the craftsman’s wondrous arts and skills, what utter 
lunacy it would be. It is exactly the same as that.... 

Seventh  Question:    What  should  be  understood  from  this  event  of  the  earth’s 
happening to the Muslim people of this country and being aimed at them? And why are 
the areas of Erzincan and Izmir affected most? 

The Answer: As  is  indicated by  many  signs,  like the event occurring during a hard 
winter in the dark of night in severely cold weather, and its restriction to a region where 
due respect is not paid to the month of Ramadan, and the earthquakes continuing mildly 
in order to arouse the neglectful –it suggests the earthquakes are aimed at and look to the 
believers and are shaking the earth in order to warn them to perform the prayers and their 
supplications,  and  the  earth  itself  is  shaking.  There  are  two  reasons  for  places  like 
unfortunate Erzincan being shaken more than other places: 

One: Since its faults are few, their purification has been expedited. 
The Second: Since there is the opportunity in places like that of strong  

                                                
26 1 okka = approx. 2.8 lbs. or 1,300 grams. 

 

190 

and  loyal  defenders  of  the  faith  and  protectors  of  Islam  being  defeated  to  a  degree  or 
entirely  and  atheists  establishing  an  effective  centre  of  activity,  it  is  possible  that 
punishment has been visited on them first. None knows the Unseen save God. 

All Glory be unto You, we have no knowledge save that which You have taught 
us; indeed You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.27 

                                                
27 Qur’an, 2:32. 

 

191 

The Fifteenth Word 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
And  We  have  adorned  the  lowest  heaven  with  lamps,  and  We  have  made  them 
missiles to drive away the evil ones.1 

Oh,  modern-educated  Sir  whose  brain  has  shrunk  through  studying  the  soulless 
matters of astronomy, whose  mind can  see  no further than the tip of  his  nose, and who 
cannot  squeeze  the  mighty  mystery  of  the  above  verse  into  his  constricted  brain!  The 
heaven  of  the  verse  may  be  reached  by  a  stairway  of  Seven  Steps.  Come,  let  us  climb 
them together! 

FIRST  STEP:    Truth  and  wisdom  require  that  the  heavens  have  inhabitants 
appropriate to them as the earth  has.  According to the Shari’a, those various  beings are 
called angels and spirit beings. Reality requires it to be thus, for despite its small size and 
insignificance, the earth being filled with living and conscious beings, then emptied from 
time to time and once again repopulated suggests, indeed makes it clear, that the heavens 
too, in which are magnificent constellations and are like adorned palaces, should be filled 
with conscious and percipient creatures. Like men and jinn, those creatures are spectators 
of the palace of the universe, the observers of the book of creation, and the heralds of the 
sovereignty  of  dominicality.  For  the  universe  is  arrayed  and  embellished  with 
innumerable  adornments,  decorations,  and  ornaments,  and  self-evidently  requires  the 
thoughtful  gazes  of  those  who  will  appreciate  it  and  wonder  at  it.  Certainly,  beauty 
requires a lover and sustenance is given to the hungry. However, man and jinn are able to 
perform only a millionth of this endless duty, this grand viewing, this extensive worship. 
That  is  to  say,  endless  sorts  of  angels  and  spirit  beings  are  necessary  to  perform  these 
endless duties and diverse worship. 

As  is  indicated  by  certain  narrations  and  the  wisdom  in  the  order  of  the  universe, 
some  kinds  of  travelling  bodies,  from  planets  to drops of  water,  are  the  mounts  of  one 
kind of angel. It may be said that they mount them with  

                                                

1 Qur’an, 67:5. 

 

192 

God’s permission and tour and gaze upon the manifest world. It also may be said that one 
type of animal bodies, from the birds of Paradise called ‘The Green Birds’2 in a Hadith, 
to  flies,  are  the  aircraft  for  a  sort  of  spirit  being.  They  enter  them  at  God’s  command, 
travel  around  the  physical  universe,  observing  the  miracles  of  creation  through  the 
windows of the senses of the animals’ bodies. 

The  Creator,  Who  continuously  creates  subtle  life  and  luminous  percipient  beings 
from dense earth and turbid water, surely also creates conscious beings suitable for spirit 
and life, from those seas of light and even from the oceans of darkness. And He creates 
them in great abundance. The existence of angels and spirit beings has been proved with 
the certainty of two plus two equals four in my treatise entitled Nokta (Point), and in the 
Twenty-Ninth Word. If you wish, you may refer to them. 

SECOND STEP: The earth and the heavens are connected to one another like two 
countries  under  a  single  government.  There  are  important  relations  and  transactions 
between them. Things necessary for the earth like light, heat, blessings, and mercy in the 
form of rain come from the sky, that is, they are sent. According to the consensus of the 
revealed religions, which are founded on revelation, and the agreement of all those who 
uncover  the  mysteries  of  the  universe,  relying  on  what  they  have  witnessed,  the  angels 
and  spirit  beings  descend  to  the  earth  from  the  skies.  From  this  it  may  be  understood 
through a surmise so certain it can almost be felt that for the inhabitants of the earth there 
is a way to ascend to the heavens. 

Indeed, everyone’s mind, imagination, and gaze perpetually rise to the skies. So too, 
having  discarded  all  heaviness  do  the  spirits  of  the  prophets  and  saints  rise  there  with 
God’s  permission,  and  having  stripped  off  their  bodies,  the  spirits  of  the  dead.  Since 
those who become light and subtle rise to the heavens, for sure, one sort of the inhabitants 
of the earth and the air who are clothed in what resembles a body and are light and subtle 
like spirits may rise there. 

THIRD  STEP:  The  silence  and  tranquillity  of  the  heavens,  and  their  order  and 
regularity, and vastness and  luminosity, show that their  inhabitants are not like those of 
the earth; they are obedient, they do whatever they are commanded. Because the country 
is vast there is nothing to cause overcrowding and disputes. Their natures are pure, they 
are innocent, their stations are fixed.  

On the earth, opposites come together, evils are mixed with good, and disputes start 
between  them.  For  this  reason,  conflict  and  suffering  are  born.  And  from  them 
examination  and  competition  are  set.  And  from  them  progress  and  retrogression  occur. 
The wisdom in these facts is as follows: 

                                                

Musnad, vi, 386 

2 Muslim, Imara, 121; Tirmidhi, Tafsir Sura iii:19; Ibn Maja, Jana’iz, 4; Jihad, 16; Darimi, Jihad, 18; 

 

193 

Man is the fruit of the tree of creation, its furthest part. It is well-known that the fruit 
of something is its most distant, most comprehensive, most delicate, and most important 
part.  Therefore,  since  man,  who  is  the  fruit  of  the  universe,  is  a  most  comprehensive, 
most wonderful, most powerless, most weak, and most subtle miracle of power, the earth, 
which  is  his  cradle and dwelling-place,  is the  heart and centre of the whole universe as 
regards meaning and art, despite being physically small and insignificant in relation to the 
heavens; it is the exposition and exhibition-place of all the miracles of art; and the display 
and point of focus of all the manifestations of the Divine Names; the place of assembly 
and reflection of unending dominical activity; the means and market of boundless Divine 
creativity, whose  liberality  is especially evident in the numerous small species of plants 
and animals; the place, in a small measure, of samples of the artefacts to be found in the 
truly vast worlds of the hereafter; the speedily operating workshop for eternal textiles; the 
fast-changing  place  of  imitation  of  everlasting  panoramas;  the  narrow,  temporary  field 
and tillage rapidly raising the seeds for never-ending gardens.  

Thus,  it  is  because  of  this  immaterial  greatness  of  the  earth,3  and  its  importance  in 
regard to art, that the All-Wise Qur’an puts it on a par with the heavens, although it is like 
a tiny fruit of a huge tree. It places it in one pan of a pair of scales and the whole of the 
rest of the universe in the other. It repeatedly says, 

Sustainer of the Heavens and the Earth. 

Furthermore,  the  speedy,  constant  change  and  transformation  of  the  earth,  which 
arises  from  the  instances  of  wisdom  mentioned  above,  requires  that  its  inhabitants 
undergo  change  in  accordance  with  it.  And,  it  is  because  this  limited  earth  manifests 
unlimited  miracles  of  power  that  according  to  their  creation  and  unlike  other  animate 
beings, no natural limit or restriction has been  

                                                

3 Despite its small size, the globe of the earth may be thought of as equal to the heavens, for it may be 

said that ‘a constant spring is greater than a lake with no inlet.’ And, although a pile of grain the size of a 
mountain apparently seems to be thousands of times larger than a measure, since it has all passed through 
the measure and been transferred to another place, the measure may be seen as in balance with the grain. It 
is exactly the same with the globe of the earth; God Almighty has created it as a place for exhibiting His 
art, a place where His creativity is concentrated, as a pivot of His wisdom, a place for the manifestation of 
His power, a garden of His mercy, a field for His Paradise, the measure for uncountable universes and 
worlds of creatures, and like a spring flowing into the seas of the past and the World of the Unseen. Think 
of all those renewed worlds whose shirts woven of beings are changed every year, layer upon layer, in 
hundreds of thousands of different forms, how they fill the earth many times and being emptied into the 
past are poured into the World of the Unseen; consider those numerous shirts of the earth. That is, suppose 
all the past to be present, and then compare it with the somewhat monotonous and plain heavens: you will 
see that even if the earth does not weigh more than the heavens, it does not weigh less, either. Thus, you 
may understand the meaning of, Sustainer of the Heavens and the Earth. 

 

194 

placed  on  the  faculties  and  powers  of  man  and  jinn,  who  are  its  most  important 
inhabitants.  As  a  result  of  this  they  have  manifested  endless  progress  and  endless 
retrogression.  A  great  field  of  trial  and  examination  has  opened,  from  the  prophets  and 
the saints to the nimrods and the devils. Since this is so, of course, with their boundless 
evil, the pharaoh-like devils will throw stones at the heavens and its inhabitants. 

FOURTH  STEP:  The  All-Glorious  One,  Who  is  the  Sustainer,  Controller,  and 
Creator of all the worlds, has numerous principles and rules, and very many appellations, 
titles,  and  most  Beautiful  Names,  which  are  all  different.  Whichever  Name  and  title 
necessitated sending angels to the ranks of the Prophet (PBUH)’s Companions in order to 
do battle against unbelievers also required that there should be battle between angels and 
devils, and contest between the good inhabitants of the heavens and the evil  inhabitants 
of the earth. The All-Powerful One of Glory, Who holds within the grasp of His power 
the  breathing-in  and  breathing-out  of  the  unbelievers,  does  not  wipe  them  out  with  a 
single command, a single trumpet-blast. With His title of universal Sustainer and Names 
of All-Wise and Controller, He inaugurates a field of examination and contest. 

If  the  comparison  is  not  mistaken,  we  see  that  a  king  has  numerous  different  titles 
and names in respect of the different areas of his rule. For example, in the judicature he is 
known by the name of Wise Judge, in the army as Commander-in-Chief, in the office of 
the Shaykh al-Islam as Khalifa, and  in the civil  service as Sultan. His obedient subjects 
call  him  Gracious  Sovereign,  while  the  rebellious  call  him  All-Compelling  Ruler.  You 
may think of further examples. 

Thus, it sometimes happens that such an exalted king, whose subjects are all within 
his power, does not issue the command to execute an impotent and contemptible rebel; he 
sends  him  to  court  under  his  name  of  Wise  Judge.  Also,  he  knows  a  both  capable  and 
honest  official  who  is  worthy  of  being  favoured,  but  he  does  not  favour  him  with  his 
particular knowledge by private telephone. Instead, under his titles relating to the majesty 
of sovereignty and expedients of government, he opens a field of competition in order to 
make  public  how  deserving  the  official  is  of  reward,  and  he  gives  the  command  to  his 
minister and invites the people to watch. He has organized a welcoming ceremony, and, 
as  a  result  of  a  grand,  elevated  trial  and  examination,  favours  him  in  a  distinguished 
assembly;  he  proclaims  his  worthiness.  You  can  think  of  further  examples  in  the  same 
way. 

Thus,  And  God’s  is  the  highest  similitude,  the  Monarch  of  Pre-Eternity  and  Post-
Eternity  has  numerous  Most  Beautiful  Names.  Through  the  manifestations  of  His  glory 
and  appearances  of  His  beauty,  He  has  many  attributes  and  titles.  The  Name,  title,  and 
attribute which  necessitate the existence of  light and darkness,  summer and  winter, and 
Paradise and Hell, require  

 

195 

also numerous general laws like the law of generation, those of competition and mutual 
assistance, and the making general to a degree also of the law of contest. From the contest 
of inspirations and satanic whisperings around the heart to the contest between angels and 
devils on the bounds of the heavens, they require that law to be all-embracing. 

FIFTH STEP: Since there  is coming and going  from the earth to the heavens, and 
there is descent and ascent from the heavens to the earth and important necessities for the 
earth are sent from there; and since good spirits rise to the heavens, for sure, imitating the 
good spirits, evil spirits will also attempt to ascend to the realm of the heavens. For they 
are  light  and  subtle  in  regard  to their  beings.  However,  they  will  doubtless  be  repulsed 
and expelled, for by nature they are evil and inauspicious. Moreover, there will doubtless 
be  a  sign,  an  indication,  in  the  Manifest  World  of  this  important  exchange,  this  contest 
outside  the  realm  of  materiality.  For  the  wisdom  of  the  sovereignty  of  dominicality 
requires that it should place a sign and leave an indication of these significant disposals in 
the Unseen for man in particular, whose most important duty is observation, witnessing, 
supervision, and acting as a herald; in the same way that it has made rain an indication of 
the endless miracles of spring, and made apparent causes signs of the wonders of Divine 
art. It thus summons the people of the Manifest Realm to witness them; indeed, it attracts 
the  attentive  gazes  of  all  the  inhabitants  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth  to that  wondrous 
exhibition. That is, it shows the vast heavens to be a castle or city arrayed with towers on 
which sentries are posted, so that they may reflect on the majesty of dominicality. 

Since  wisdom  requires  that  there  should  be  an  announcement  for  this  elevated 
contest,  there  is  surely  an  indication  of  it.  But  –other  than  shooting  stars–  no  event 
appropriate  to  this  announcement  is  apparent  among  the  events  of  the  atmosphere  and 
heavens;  there  is  nothing  more  appropriate  than  this.  For  it  may  be  understood  clearly 
how suitable for the repulsion of devils are these stellar events, which resemble missiles 
and  signal  rockets  fired  from  the  sturdy  bastions  of  towering  castles.  And  there  is  no 
other  known  purpose,  wisdom,  and  aim,  no  other  purpose  appropriate  to  these 
occurrences  other  than  these.  Other  occurrences  are  not  like  this.  Furthermore,  this 
purpose of them has been well-known since the time of Adam, and has been witnessed by 
the people of reality. 

SIXTH STEP: Since man and jinn are capable of infinite evil and exertion, they are 
infinitely obdurate and rebellious. It is because of this that the Holy Qur’an restrains them 
from  rebellion  and  insubordination  with  an  eloquence  so  miraculous,  styles  so  elevated 
and clear, comparisons and stories so exalted and evident that they cause the universe to 
tremble. For example,  

 

196 

observe  carefully  the  awesome  warning,  fearsome  threat,  and  severe  restraining  in  the 
verses: 

O  you  assembly  of  jinn  and  men!  If  you  can  pass  beyond  the  regions  of  the 
heavens and the earth, pass beyond them! [But] you cannot pass beyond them, 
save  by  [God’s]  authority.  *  Then  which  of  the  favours  of  your  Sustainer  will 
you deny? * On you will be sent a flame of fire, and smoke; no succour will you 
have,4 

which has the meaning of ‘O man and jinn! If you are not going to obey my commands, 
come  on,  pass  beyond  the  bounds  of  My  realms  if  you  are  able!’  With  miraculous 
eloquence, it smashes the excessively conceited obstinacy of man and jinn. It proclaims 
their  impotence, and shows  just how powerless and wretched they are  in relation to the 
immense  grandeur  of  the  sovereignty  of  dominicality.  It  is  as  though  it  says  with  that 
verse, and the verse, 

And We have made them missiles to drive away the evil ones:5 

‘O  man  and  jinn,  proud  and  obstinate  within  your  baseness,  and  obdurate  and 
refractory  within  your  weakness  and  poverty!  How  are  you  so  bold  as  to  oppose  with 
your rebellion the commands of a Monarch  so Glorious that the stars,  moons, and suns 
obey  His  commands  like  soldiers  under  orders?  Through  your  defiance  you  contest  an 
All-Wise  One  of  Glory  Who  has  obedient  soldiers  so  awesome  that,  if  to  suppose  the 
impossible  your  devils  could  withstand  them,  they  would  drive  them  off  with  cannon-
balls the size of mountains. And with your ingratitude, you revolt in the realm of a Lord 
of  Glory  Who  has  servants  and  troops  so  fearsome,  it  is  not  insignificant  impotent 
creatures  like  you,  if  you  were  each  infidel  enemies  the  size  of  mountains  or the  earth, 
they  would  be  able  to  hurl  stars,  flaming  projectiles,  and  molten  metal  the  size  of 
mountains or the earth at you, and rout you. And you break a law that is such that those 
bound by it could if necessary strike your earth in your face, and rain down on you stars 
like cannon-balls the size of your globe.’ 

Yes,  in  the  Qur’an  are  certain  important  ‘concentrations  of  forces’  which  arise  not 
from  the  enemies’  strength,  but  from  reasons  like  the  displaying  of  majesty  and 
exhibiting the enemy’s wickedness. Then sometimes  it  mobilizes against the  littlest and 
weakest thing, the  largest and  most powerful causes,  in order to show  its perfect order, 
infinite justice, vast knowledge, and power of wisdom, and holds them above it; but does 
not make them fall upon it or aggress against it. For example, look at this verse, 

But  if  you  uphold  each  other  against  him,  truly  God  is  his  Protector,  and 
Gabriel, and all the righteous among the believers, and furthermore, the angels, 
will back him up.6 

                                                

4 Qur’an, 55:33-5. 
5 Qur’an, 67:5. 
6 Qur’an, 66:4. 

 

197 

How respectful it is concerning the Prophet (PBUH), and how compassionate towards the 
rights  of  his  wives!  This  important  concentration  of  forces  is  only  to  express 
compassionately  its  tremendous  respect  for  the  Prophet  and  the  importance  of  the 
complaints of two weak beings and the observance of their rights. 

SEVENTH STEP:  As with angels and  fish, there are numerous different varieties 
of stars. Some are extremely small, and some are extremely large. Everything that shines 
in the sky even is called a star. Thus, the stars of one sort that the Glorious Creator and 
Beauteous  Maker  created  are  like  the  embossed  decorations  on  the  face  of  the  delicate 
heavens,  and  the  shining  fruits  of  that  tree,  and  the  praising  and  extolling  fishes  of  its 
seas.  Others  He  made  the  places  of  excursion  and  thousands  of  dwelling-places  for  the 
angels. And one sort of small star He made the means for driving off devils. Thus, these 
shooting stars fired to repulse satans may have three meanings: 

The First: They are a sign and indication that the law of contest is also in force in the 

vastest sphere. 

The Second: There are vigilant guards and obedient inhabitants in the heavens. The 
shooting stars are a proclamation and indication that there are Divine forces found there 
who are displeased at the rebellion of evil dwellers on the earth, and their eavesdropping 
on them. 

The  Third:  It  is  the  rejection  and  repulsion  with  shooting  stars  like  missiles  and 
signal rockets of spying satans, which are the execrable representatives of the filth of the 
earth, from the portals of the heavens, so that they do not soil the pure and clean and the 
dwelling-place of the pure, the skies; to prevent them  spying on account of evil  spirits, 
and to scare off mannerless spies. 

And so, Astronomer Sir, who relies on the torch in his head like a fire-fly and shuts 
his eyes to the sun of the Qur’an! Open your eyes, put aside the torch in your head, and 
see within the light of miraculousness as bright as daylight the meaning of the verse at the 
beginning!  Take  one  star  of  truth  from  the  heavens  of  that  verse,  cast  it  at the  satan  in 
your  head,  and  drive  away  your  own  devil!  And  we  must  do  the  same.  Together  we 
should say, 

O my Sustainer! I seek refuge with you from the suggestions of the Evil Ones.7 
And God’s is the eloquent proof and the decisive wisdom.7 
All glory be unto You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught 
us; indeed, You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.8 

                                                

7 Qur’an, 23:97. 
8 Qur’an, 2.32.

The Addendum to the Fifteenth Word 

[The First Topic of the Twenty-Sixth Letter] 

In His Name be He Glorified. 
And there is nothing but glorifies Him with praise. 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
And if a suggestion from Satan assails your mind, seek refuge with God; for He 
is All-Hearing and All-Knowing.9 

A Proof of the Qur’an against Satan and His Party 

This  First  Topic  defeats  in  argument  the  Devil,  silences  the  rebellious,  and  strikes 
them dumb by refuting in the most clear manner a fearsome and cunning stratagem of the 
Devil,  which  is  to  be  ‘unbiased’.  It  concerns  an  event  part  of  which  I  described  in 
summary form ten years ago in my work entitled Leme’at. It is as follows: 

Eleven  years  before  this  treatise  was  written  in  the  month  of  Ramadan,  I  was 
listening to the Qur’an being recited in Beyazit Mosque in Istanbul. Suddenly, although I 
could  not  see  anyone,  I  seemed  to  hear  an  unearthly  voice  which  captured  all  my 
attention. I listened with my imagination, and realized that it was saying to me: 

‘You consider the Qur’an to be extremely elevated and  brilliant. Be unbiased  for a 
minute and consider it again. That is, suppose it to be man’s word. I wonder whether you 
would still see the same qualities and beauty in it?’ 

In  truth,  I  was  deceived  by  the  voice;  I  thought  of  the  Qur’an  as  being  written  by 
man.  And  just  as  Beyazit  Mosque  is  plunged  into  darkness  when  the  electric  switch  is 
turned off, I observed that with that thought the brilliant lights of the Qur’an began to be 
extinguished. At that point I understood that it was the Devil who was speaking to me. He 
was drawing me towards the abyss. 

I sought help  from the Qur’an and  a  light was at once  imparted to my  heart giving 

me firm strength for the defence. I began to argue back at the Devil, saying: 

                                                

9 Qur’an, 7:200. 

 

199 

‘O Satan! Unbiased thinking is to take a position between two sides. Whereas what 
both you and your disciples from among men call unbiased thinking is to take the part of 
the opposing side; it is not impartiality, it is temporary unbelief. Because, to consider the 
Qur’an to be man’s word and to judge it as such is to take the part of the opposing side; it 
is  to  favour  something  baseless  and  invalid.  It  is  not  being  unbiased,  it  is  being  biased 
towards falsehood.’ 

The Devil replied: ‘Well, in that case, say it is neither God’s Word nor man’s word. 

Think of it as between the two.’ To which I rejoined: 

‘That is not possible either. For if there is a disputed property for which there are two 
claimants,  and  the  claimants  are  close  both  to  one  another  and  to  the  property,  the 
property will then either be given to someone other than them, or will be put somewhere 
accessible so that whoever proves ownership can take it. If the two claimants are far apart 
with one in the East and one in the West, then according to the rule, it will remain with 
the one who has possession of it, as it is not possible for it to be left somewhere between 
them. 

‘Thus,  the  Qur’an  is  a  valuable  property,  and  however  distant  man’s  word  is  from 
God’s, the two sides in question are that far apart; indeed, they are infinitely far from one 
another. It is not possible for the Qur’an to be left between the two sides, which are as far 
apart  as  the  Pleiades  and  the  ground.  For  they  are  opposites  like  existence  and  non-
existence or the two magnetic poles; there can be no point between them. In which case, 
for the Qur’an, the one who possesses it is God’s side. It will be accepted as being in His 
possession,  and  the  proofs  of  ownership  will  be  regarded  in  that  way.  Should  the 
opposing  side  refute  all  the  arguments  proving  it  to  be  God’s  Word,  it  may  claim 
ownership  of  it,  otherwise  it  may  not.  God  forbid!  What  hand  can  pull  out  the  nails 
fastening that vast jewel to the Sublime Throne of God, riveted as it is with thousands of 
certain proofs, and break its supporting pillars, causing it to fall?’ 

‘And  so,  inspite  of  you,  O  Satan!,  the  just  and  the  fair-minded  reason  in  this 
equitable and rightful manner. They increase their belief in the Qur’an through even the 
slightest evidences. While according to the way shown by you and your disciples, if just 
once it is supposed to be man’s word and that mighty jewel fastened to the Divine Throne 
is cast to the ground, a proof with the strength of all the nails and the firmness of many 
proofs becomes necessary in order to raise it from the ground and fasten it once more to 
the Throne, and so be saved from the darkness of unbelief and reach the lights of belief. 
But because it is extremely difficult to do this, due to your wiles, many people are losing 
their faith at this time by imagining themselves to be making unbiased judgements.’ 

The Devil turned and said: ‘The Qur’an resembles man’s word. It is  

 

200 

similar to the way men converse. That means it is man’s word. If it was God’s Word, it 
would be appropriate to Him and would be altogether out of the ordinary. Just as His art 
does not resemble man’s art, so also should His Word not resemble man’s word.’  

I  replied:  ‘It  may  be  understood  as  follows:  apart  from  his  miracles  and  special 
attributes,  the  Prophet  Muhammad  (PBUH)  was  a  human  being  in  all  his  actions, 
conduct,  and  behaviour.  He  submitted  to  and  complied  with  the  Divine  laws  and 
commands manifested in creation. He too suffered from the cold, experienced pain, and 
so on. His deeds and attributes were not all made out of the ordinary so that he could be 
the  leader  of  his  community  through  his  actions,  its  guide  through  his  conduct,  and 
instruct it through all his behaviour. If he had been out of the ordinary in all his conduct, 
he could  not himself  have  been the  leader  in every respect, the total guide of everyone, 
the ‘Mercy to All the Worlds’ through all his attributes. 

‘In  just  the  same  way,  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  is  the  leader  to  the  aware  and  the 
conscious,  the  guide  of  jinn  and  men,  the  teacher  of  those  attaining  to  perfection,  and 
instructor of  those  seeking  reality.  It  is  of  necessity  and  of  a  certainty,  therefore,  in  the 
same  form  as  man’s  conversation  and  style.  For  men  and  jinn  take  their  supplications 
from  it  and  learn  their  prayers  from  it;  they  express  their  concerns  in  its  language,  and 
learn  from  it  the  rules  of  social  behaviour,  and  so  on.  Everyone  has  recourse  to  it.  If, 
therefore, it had been in the form of the Divine speech which the Prophet Moses (Peace 
be upon him) heard on Mount Sinai, man could not have borne listening to it and hearing 
it, nor made it the point of reference and recourse. Moses (Peace be upon him), one of the 
five greatest prophets, could only endure to hear a few words. He said: 

‘‘Is Your speech thus?’ God replied: ‘I have the power of all tongues.’’ 
Next, the Devil said: ‘Many people speak of matters similar to those in the Qur’an in 
the name of religion. Is it not possible, therefore, that a human being did such a thing and 
made up the Qur’an in the name of religion?’ 

Through the light of the Qur’an I replied as follows: 
‘Firstly:  Out  of  love  of  religion,  someone  who  is  religious  may  say,  ‘The  truth  is 
thus, the reality of the  matter is this.  Almighty God commands that.’ But he would  not 
make God speak to suit himself. Trembling at the verse, 

Who, then does more wrong than one who utters a lie concerning God?,10 

he  would  not  overstep  his  mark  to  an  infinite  degree,  imitate  God,  and  speak  on  His 
behalf. 

‘Secondly: It is in no way possible for a human being to be successful in doing such 

a thing on his own, in fact, it is completely impossible. Individuals  

                                                

10 Qur’an, 39:32. 

 

201 

who resemble one another may imitate one another, those of the same kind may take on 
one another’s forms, those who are close to one another in rank or status may imitate one 
another and temporarily deceive people, but they cannot do so for ever. For in any event, 
the  falseness  and  artificiality  in  their  behaviour  will  show  up  their  imposture  to  the 
observant,  and  their  deception  will  not  last.  If  the  one  who  is  attempting  to  imitate 
another  under  false  pretences  is  quite  unlike  them,  for  example,  if  an  uneducated  man 
wants to imitate in learning a genius like Ibn-i Sina, or a shepherd assume the position of 
a  king,  of  course,  they  will  not  deceive  anyone  at  all,  they  will  only  make  fools  of 
themselves. Everything they do will proclaim, ‘This is an impostor.’ 

‘Thus, to suppose – God forbid!, a hundred thousand times – the Qur’an to be man’s 
word  is  utterly  impossible,  no  rational  being  can  accept  it  as  possible,  to  do  so  is  a 
delirium  like imagining to be possible something that is self-evidently impossible like a 
fire-fly being seen by astronomers as a real star for a thousand years; or a fly appearing to 
observers in the true form of a peacock for a year; or a bogus common private posing as a 
famous lofty field marshal, taking over his position and remaining in it for a long period 
without  giving  away  his  deception;  or  like  a  slandering,  unbelieving  liar  affecting  the 
manner and position of the most truthful, trustworthy, upright believer throughout his life 
and  being  completely  unruffled  before  even  the  most  observant  while  concealing  his 
fraud from them. 

‘In just the same way, if the Qur’an is supposed to be man’s word, then it has to be 
supposed,  God  forbid,  that  that  Perspicuous  Book,  which  is  considered  to  be  clearly  a 
most brilliant star, rather, a sun of perfections perpetually scattering the lights of truth in 
the  heavens  of  the  world  of  Islam,  is  like  a  fire-fly,  a  spurious  sham  made  up  by  a 
counterfeiting human. And those who are closest to it and study it most carefully do not 
realize this, and consider  it to be a perpetual, exalted  star and source of truth. Together 
with this being impossible a hundred times over, even if you went a hundred times further 
in  your  diabolical  machinations,  O  Satan,  you  could  not  make  such  an  assertion,  you 
could not deceive anyone of sound reason! Only sometimes you trick people by making 
them look from a great distance, thus making the star appear as small as a fire-fly. 

‘Thirdly: Also,  if the Qur’an  is  imagined to be man’s  word, it necessitates that the 
hidden reality of a criterion of truth and falsehood, which is miraculous in its exposition, 
and  through  the  testimony  of  its  fruits,  results,  and  effects,  is  gilded  with  the  most 
spiritual  and 
the  most 
comprehensive  and  exalted  qualities  in  the  world  of  mankind,  is,  God  forbid,  the 
fabrication of a single unaided and unlearned man’s mind; and that the great geniuses and 
brilliant  scholars  who  observed  that  being  closely  and  studied  him  meticulously  at  no 
time  

truthful  and  happiness-bringing, 

life-giving, 

the  most 

 

202 

saw any trace of counterfeit or pretence  in  him and always  found  him serious, genuine, 
and sincere. 

‘This is completely impossible, an idea so nonsensical as to shame the Devil himself, 
like  dreaming  up  an  utterly  impossible  situation.  For  it  entails  supposing  one  who 
throughout  his  life  demonstrated  and  taught  trust,  belief,  confidence,  sincerity, 
seriousness,  and  integrity  through  all  his  conduct,  words,  and  actions,  and  raised 
eminently  truthful  and  sincere  followers,  and  was  accepted  to  possess  the  highest  and 
most  brilliant  and  elevated  virtues  to  be  the  most  untrustworthy,  insincere,  and 
unbelieving. For in this question there is no point between the two. 

‘If, to suppose the impossible, the Qur’an was not the Word of God, it would fall as 
though from the Divine Throne to the ground, it would not remain somewhere between. 
While being the meeting-point of truths, it would become the source of superstition and 
myth. And if, God forbid, the one who proclaimed that wonderful decree was not God’s 
Messenger, it would necessitate his descending from the highest of the high to the lowest 
of the low, and from the degree of being the source of accomplishments and perfections 
to the level of being a mine of trickery and intrigue; he could not remain between the two. 
For one who lies and fabricates in God’s name falls to the very lowest of degrees. 

‘However impossible it is to permanently see a fly as a peacock, and to all the time 
see  the  peacocks’s  attributes  in  the  fly,  this  matter  is  that  impossible.  Only  someone 
lacking all intelligence could imagine it to be possible. 

‘Fourthly: Also, if the Qur’an is imagined to be man’s word, it necessitates fancying 
that  the  Qur’an,  which  is  a  sacred  commander  of  the  community  of  Muhammad, 
mankind’s  largest  and  most  powerful  army,  is  –God  forbid–  a  powerless,  valueless, 
baseless  forgery.  Whereas,  self-evidently,  through  its  powerful  laws,  sound  principles, 
and penetrating commands, it has equipped that huge army both materially, and morally 
and spiritually, has given it an order and regularity and imposed a discipline on it that are 
such as to conquer both this world and the next, and has instructed the minds, trained the 
hearts,  conquered  the  spirits,  purified  the  consciences,  and  employed  and  utilized  the 
limbs and members of individuals according to the degree of each. To imagine it to be a 
counterfeit necessitates accepting a hundredfold impossibility. 

‘This  impossibility  entails  the  further  complete  impossibility  of  supposing  that  one 
who, through his deliberate conduct throughout his life taught mankind Almighty God’s 
laws,  and  through  his  honest  behaviour  instructed  man  in  the  principles  of  truth,  and 
through  his  sincere  and  reasonable  words  showed  and  established  the  straight  way  of 
moderation and happiness, and as all his life testifies, felt great fear of Divine punishment 
and knew God  

 

203 

better  than  anyone  else  and  made  Him  known,  and  in  splendid  fashion  has  for  one 
thousand three hundred and fifty years commanded a fifth of mankind and half the globe, 
and through his qualities of renown is in truth the means of pride of mankind, indeed, of 
the universe, God forbid a  hundred thousand times, neither  feared God, nor knew Him, 
nor  held  back  from  lying,  nor  had  any  self-respect.  For  in  this  matter there  is  no  point 
between the two. For if, to suppose the impossible, the Qur’an is not the Word of God, if 
it falls from the Divine Throne to the ground, it cannot remain somewhere in between the 
two. Indeed, it then has to be accepted as the property of the very worst of liars. And as 
for this, O Satan, even if you were a hundred times more satanic, you could not deceive 
any mind that was not unsound, nor persuade any heart that was not corrupted.’ 

The  Devil  retorted:  ‘How  should  I  not  deceive  them?  I  have  deceived  most  of 

mankind and their foremost thinkers into denying the Qur’an and Muhammad.’  

I  replied:  ‘Firstly:  When  seen  from  a  great  distance,  the  greatest thing  appears  the 

same as the smallest. A star may even appear as a candle. 

‘Secondly: Also, when seen both as secondary and superficially, something which is 

completely impossible may appear to be possible. 

‘One  time  an  old  man  was  watching  the  sky  in  order  to  spot  the  new  moon  of 
Ramadan when a white hair fell on his eye. Imagining it to be the moon, he announced: ‘I 
have seen the new moon.’ Now, it is impossible that the white hair should have been the 
moon,  but  because  his  intention  was  to  look  for  just the  moon  and  the  hair  was  by  the 
way and secondary, he paid it no attention and thought that impossibility was possible. 

‘Thirdly: Also, non-acceptance is one thing and denial is something quite different. 
Non-acceptance  is  indifference, a closing of the eyes to something, an  ignorant absence 
of  judgement.  Many  completely  impossible  things  may  be  concealed  within  it,  and  the 
mind  does  not  concern  itself  with  them.  As  for  denial,  it  is  not  non-acceptance,  but  an 
acceptance of non-existence; it is a judgement. The mind is compelled to work. So a devil 
like you takes hold of the mind of a person, then leads it to denial. And, showing the false 
as  truth  and  the  impossible  as  possible  through  satanic  wiles  like  heedlessness, 
misguidance,  fallacious  reasoning,  obstinacy,  false  arguments,  pride,  deception,  and 
habit, you make those unfortunate creatures in human form swallow unbelief and denial, 
although they comprise innumerable impossibilities. 

‘Fourthly:  Also,  if  the  Qur’an  is  supposed  to  be  the  word  of  man,  it  necessitates 
imagining  to  be  its  opposite  a  book  which  has  self-evidently  guided  the  purified, 
veracious saints and spiritual poles, who shine  like stars  in the  heavens of the world of 
mankind, has continuously instructed every level of the people of perfection in truth and 
justice, veracity and fidelity,  

 

204 

faith  and  trustworthiness,  and  has  ensured  the  happiness  of  the  two  worlds  through  the 
truths  of  the  pillars  of  belief  and  the  principles  of  the  pillars  of  Islam,  and  through  the 
testimony  of  these  achievements  is  of  necessity  veracious,  and  pure,  genuine  truth,  and 
absolutely right, and most serious – it necessitates imagining, God forbid, that this Book 
comprises the opposites of these qualities, effects, and lights. And that, regarding it as a 
collection  of  fabrications  and  lies,  is  a  frenzy  of  unbelief  that  would  shame  even  the 
Sophists and the devils, and cause them to tremble. 

‘And this impossibility necessitates the further most ugly and abhorrent impossibility 
that One who, according to the testimony of the religion and Shari’a of Islam which  he 
proclaimed, and the unanimous indications to the extraordinary fear of God and pure and 
sincere  worship  which  he  demonstrated  throughout  his  life,  and  as  necessitated  by  the 
good moral qualities unanimously witnessed in him, and according to the affirmation of 
the  people  of  truth  and  perfection  whom  he  reared,  was  the  most  believing,  the  most 
steadfast, the most trustworthy, and the most truthful, was – God forbid, and again, God 
forbid – without belief, that he was most untrustworthy, did not fear God, nor shrink from 
lying.  To  imagine  this  necessitates  imagining  the  most  loathsome  form  of  impossibility 
and perpetrating the most iniquitous and vicious sort of misguidance. 

‘In Short: As is stated in the Eighteenth Sign of the Nineteenth Letter, the common 
people,  whose  understanding  of  the  Qur’an  is  gained  by  listening  to  it,  say,  ‘Were  the 
Qur’an to be compared with  all the  books I have  listened to and the other books  in the 
world,  it would  not resemble any of them;  it  is  not of the same sort as them  nor or the 
same degree.’ The Qur’an, then,  is of  a degree  either above all of them or below  all of 
them. To be below them is impossible, and no enemy nor the Devil even could accept it. 
In which case, the Qur’an is above all other books, and is therefore a miracle. In just the 
same  way,  we  say  according  to  the  categorical  proof  called  ‘residue’,  taken  from  the 
sciences of method and logic: 

‘O Satan and O disciples of Satan! The Qur’an is either the Word of God come from 
the  Supreme  Throne  of  God  and  His  Greatest  Name,  or,  God  forbid,  and  again,  God 
forbid, it is a human forgery fabricated on earth by someone without belief who neither 
feared God nor knew Him. In the face of the above proofs, O Satan, you can neither say 
that, nor could you have said it, nor will you be able to say it in the future. Therefore, the 
Qur’an is the Word of the Creator of the universe. Because there is no point between the 
two;  it  is  impossible  and  precluded  that there  should  be.  Just  as  we  have  proved  in  the 
most clear and decisive manner; and you have seen it and heard it. 

‘In  the  same  way,  Muhammad  (Peace  and  blessings  be  upon  him)  is  either  God’s 

Messenger and the highest of the prophets and the most superior  

 

205 

of creatures, or, God forbid, he has to be imagined to be someone without belief having 
fallen to the  lowest of the  low because  he  lied concerning God, and did not know God, 
and  did  not  believe  in  His  punishment.11  And  as  for  this,  O  Devil,  neither  you  nor  the 
philosophers of Europe and hypocrites of Asia on whom you rely could say it, nor could 
you say it in the past, neither shall you be able to say it in the future, for there is no one in 
the  world  who  would  listen  to  it  and  accept  it.  It  is  because  of  this  that  the  most 
corrupting  of  those  philosophers  and  the  most  lacking  in  conscience  of  the  hypocrites, 
even, admit that ‘Muhammad the Arabian (PBUH) was very clever, and was most moral 
and upright.’ 

‘Since this  matter is restricted to these two sides, and the second one  is  impossible 
and no one at all claims it to be true, and since we have proved with decisive arguments 
that there  is  no point  between them,  for sure and of  necessity,  in  spite of  you and  your 
party, Muhammad the Arabian (Peace and blessings be upon him) was God’s Messenger, 
and the highest of the prophets and the best of all creatures.’ 

Upon him be blessings and peace to the number of angels and jinn and men. 

                                                

11 Relying on the fact that the Qur’an mentions the blasphemies and obscenities of the unbelievers, in 

order to refute them, trembling, I too have been compelled to use these expressions in the form of 
impossibilities in order to demonstrate the total impossibility and complete worthlessness of the 
blasphemous ideas of the people of misguidance.

A SECOND, SMALL OBJECTION 
OF SATAN 

Not a word does he utter but there is a sentinel by him, ready [to note it]. * And 
the stupor of death will bring the truth [before his eyes]: ‘This was the thing you 
were trying to escape!’ * And the Trumpet shall be blown: that will be the Day 
whereof warning [had been given]. * And there will come forth every soul: with 
each  will  be  [an  angel]  to  drive,  and  [an  angel]  to  bear  witness.  *  ‘You  were 
heedless  of  this;  now  have  We  removed  your  veil.  And  sharp  is  your  sight  this 
Day!’  *  And  his  companion  will  say:  ‘Here  is  [his  record]  ready  with  me!’  * 
‘Throw, throw into Hell every contumacious rejecter!’12 

One  time  while  reading  these  verses  from  Sura  Qaf,  the  Devil  said  to  me:  ‘You 
consider  the  most  important  aspects  of  the  Qur’an’s  eloquence  to  lie  in  its  clarity  and 
fluency  of  style.  But  in  this  verse  it  jumps  from  one  subject  to  another.  It  jumps  from 
death agonies to the resurrection of the dead, from the blowing of the trumpet to the Last 
Judgement, and from that to the entry into Hell of the unbelievers. What fluency of style 
remains with this extraordinary switching about? In most places in the Qur’an, it brings 
together subjects that bear little relation to each other like this. Where is its eloquence and 
smoothness with such discontinuity?’ 

I answered as follows: 
‘After its eloquence, one of the most important elements of the miraculousness of the 
Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition  is  its conciseness. Conciseness  is one of the  strongest 
and  most  important  elements  of  the  Qur’an’s  miraculousness.  Instances  of  this 
miraculous  conciseness  of  the  Qur’an  are  so  numerous  and  beautiful  that  exacting 
scholars are left in wonder at it. For example: 

Then the word went forth: ‘O earth! swallow up your water, and O sky! withhold 
[your  rain]!’  And  the  water  abated,  and  matter  was  ended.  The  ark  rested  on 
Mount Judi, and the word went forth: ‘Away with those who do wrong!’13 

                                                

12 Qur’an, 50:18-24. 
13 Qur’an, 11:44. 

 

207 

‘It describes the Great Flood and its consequences so concisely and miraculously in a 
few  short  sentences  that  it  has  caused  many  scholars  of  rhetoric  to  prostrate  before  its 
eloquence. And, for example: 

The  Thamud  rejected  [their  prophet]  through  their  inordinate  wrongdoing.  * 
Behold, the most wicked man among them was deputed [for impiety]. * But the 
apostle of God said to them: ‘It is a she-camel of God. And [bar her not from] 
having  her  drink!’  *  Then  they  rejected  him,  and  they  hamstrung  her.  So  their 
Lord,  on  account  of  their  crime,  obliterated  their  traces  and  made  them  equal 
[in destruction, high and low]! * And for Him is no fear of its consequences.14 

‘In  these  few  short  sentences  and  with  a  miraculousness  within  the  conciseness, 
fluency, and clarity, and in a way that does not spoil the understanding, the Qur’an relates 
the  strange  and  momentous  events  concerning  the  Thamud  people,  together  with  the 
consequences and their calamitous end. And for example: 

And remember Zun-Nun, when he departed in  wrath: he imagined that We had 
no  power  over  him.  But  he  cried  through  the  depths  of  darkness:  ‘There  is  no 
god but You; glory be unto You; I was indeed among the wrongdoers.’15 

‘Here, many sentences have be ‘rolled up’ between the words ‘that We had no power 
over him’ and ‘but he cried out in the depths of the darkness,’ but these omitted sentences 
neither  spoil  the  understanding,  nor  mar  the  fluency  of  the  style.  It  mentions  the  most 
important elements in the story of Jonah (Peace be upon him), and refers the rest to the 
intelligence. 

‘And  for  example,  in  Sura  Yusuf,  the  seven  or  eight  sentences  between  the  words 
‘Send me’ and  ‘Joseph, O  man of truth!’16 have  been skipped  in conciseness. It neither 
impairs the understanding, nor mars the smoothness of the style. There are a great many 
instances of this sort of miraculous conciseness in the Qur’an, and they are very beautiful 
indeed. 

‘However,  the  conciseness  of  the  verses  from  Sura  Qaf  are  particularly  wonderful 
and miraculous. For they each point out the truly dreadful future of the unbelievers when 
each  endless  day  will  last  fifty  thousand  years,  and  the  grievous,  dire  things  that  will 
happen to them in the awesome revolutions of the future. It conveys the mind over them 
like  lightning,  presenting  that  long,  long  period  of  time  to  the  mind’s  eye  as  a  single 
present  page.  Referring  the  events  which  are  not  mentioned  to  the  imagination,  it 
describes them with a most elevated fluency and smoothness of style. 

  

                                                

14 Qur’an, 91:11-15. 
15 Qur’an, 21:87. 
16 Qur’an, 12:45-6. 

 

208 

When  the  Qur’an  is  read,  listen  to  it  with  attention,  and  hold  your  peace:  that 
you may receive mercy.17 

‘And now if you have anything to say, O Satan, say it!’ 
Satan replied: ‘I cannot oppose what you say, nor defend myself. But there are many 
foolish  people  who  listen  to  me;  and  many  devils  in  human  form  who  assist  me;  and 
many  pharaohs  among  philosophers  who  learn  things  from  me  which  flatter their  egos, 
and prevent the publication of works like yours. Therefore I shall not lay down my arms 
before you.’

The Sixteenth Word 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
Indeed,  His  command  when  He  wills  a  thing  is,  ‘Be!’,  and  it  is.  *  So  glory  be 
unto Him in Whose hand is the dominion of all things, and to Him will you all be 
brought back.11 

 [This Word was written to afford insight and understanding to my blind soul by 
pointing out four Rays from the light of the above verse – to dispel the darkness 
and afford me certainty.] 

FIRST RAY  

O my ignorant soul! You say, ‘The Oneness of the Divine Essence together with the 
universality  of  the  Divine  acts,  the  Unity  of  Almighty  God’s  person  together  with  His 
unassisted  comprehensive  dominicality,  His  Singleness  together  with  His  unshared  all-
embracing  disposal,  His  being  beyond  space  and  yet  present  everywhere,  His  infinite 
exaltedness  together  with  being  close  to  all  things,  and  His  being  One  and  yet  Himself 
holding all matters in His hand, are among the truths of the Qur’an. Yet the Qur’an is All-
Wise,  and  that  which  is  Wise  does  not  impose  on  the  reason  things  which  are 
unreasonable.  And  the  reason  sees  an  apparent  contradiction  between  these  things.  I 
would like an explanation of them which will impel the reason to submit.’ 

The Answer:   Since that  is the way  it  is and  you want to be certain and reassured, 
relying  on  the  effulgence  of  the  Qur’an,  we  say:  the  Divine  Name  of  Light  has  solved 
many  of  my  difficulties.  God  willing,  it  will  solve  this  one  too.  Choosing  the  way  of 
comparison,  which  brings  clarity  to  the  mind  and  luminosity  to  the  heart,  like  Imam-i 
Rabbani, we say: 

I am neither the night nor a lover of the night; 
I am a servant of the Sun; it is of the Sun that I speak. 

Since comparison is a most brilliant mirror to the Qur’an’s miraculousness, we too shall 
look at this mystery by means of a comparison. It is as follows: 

                                                

1 Qur’an, 36:82-3. 

 

210 

A  single  person  may  gain  universality  by  means  of  various  mirrors.  While  being  a 
single individual, he becomes like a universal possessing general qualities. For example, 
while  the  sun  is  a  single  individual,  by  means  of  transparent  objects,  it  becomes  so 
universal it fills the face of the earth with its images and reflections. It even has as many 
manifestations  as  the  number  of  droplets  and  shining  motes.  Although  the  sun’s  heat, 
light,  and  the  seven  colours  in  its  light  comprehend,  encompass,  and  embrace  all  the 
things which confront them, all transparent things also hold in the pupils of their eyes the 
sun’s  heat,  and  its  light  and  seven  colours,  together  with  its  image.  And  they  make  a 
throne for them in their hearts. That is to say, with regard to Unity, the sun encompasses 
all the things which confront it, while with regard to Oneness, the sun is present together 
with  many  of  its  attributes  in  everything  through  a  sort of  manifestation  of  its  essence. 
Since  we  have  passed  from  the  comparison  to  a  discussion  of  representation,  we  shall 
indicate three of the many sorts of representation which will be a means to understanding 
this matter. 

The First: This is the reflection of dense, physical objects. These reflections are both 
other than the thing reflected; they are not the same, and they are dead, without life. They 
possess no quality other than their apparent identity. For example, if you enter a store full 
of mirrors, one Said will become thousands of Said’s, but the only living one is you, all 
the others are dead. They possess none of the characteristics of life. 

The  Second:  This  is  the  reflection  of  physical  luminous  objects.  This  reflection  is 
not  the  same  as  the  thing  reflected,  but  neither  is  it  other  than  it.  It  does  not  hold  the 
luminous  object’s  nature,  but  it  possesses  most  of  its  characteristics,  and  may  be 
considered as living. For example, the sun entered the world and displayed its reflection 
in all  mirrors. Present in each of the reflections are  light and the  seven colours  in  light, 
which are like the sun’s qualities. Let us suppose the sun possessed consciousness, and its 
heat  was  pure  power;  its  light,  pure  knowledge;  and  its  seven  colours,  the  seven 
attributes:  the  single  sun  would  be  present  in  all  mirrors  at one  moment,  and  would  be 
able to make each a throne for itself and a sort of telephone. One mirror would not be an 
obstacle  to  another.  It  would  be  able  to  meet  with  all  of  us  by  means  of  our  mirrors. 
While we are distant from it, it would be closer to us than ourselves. 

The Third: This  is the reflection of  luminous  spirits. This reflection  is  both living, 
and the same as the spirits. But since it appears in relation to the capacity of the mirrors, 
it does not hold completely the spirit’s essence and nature. For example, at the moment 
the Angel Gabriel (Peace  be upon  him)  is  in the  presence of the Prophet in the  form of 
Dihya,  he  is  prostrating  with  his  magnificent  wings  in  the  Divine  Presence  before  the 
Sublime  Throne.  And  at  the  same  moment  he  is  present  in  innumerable  places,  and  is 
relaying  

 

211 

the  Divine  commands.  One  task  is  not  an  obstacle  to  another.  Thus,  it  is  through  this 
mystery that the Prophet Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him), whose essence 
is  light  and  nature,  luminous,  in  this  world  hears  at  the  same  time  all  the  benedictions 
recited  for  him  by  all  his  community,  and  at  the  resurrection  will  meet  with  all  the 
purified  at  the  same  time.  One  will  not  be  an  obstacle  to  another.  In  fact,  some  of  the 
saints who have acquired a high degree of luminosity and are called ‘substitutes’ (abdal) 
have been observed in many places at the same time, and the same person has performed 
numerous different acts at the same time.  

Indeed, just as things like glass and water act as mirrors to physical objects, so the air 
and ether, and certain beings of the World of Similitudes are like mirrors to spirit beings; 
they  become  like  means  of  transport  and  conveyance  of  the  speed  of  lightning  and 
imagination.  The  spirit  beings  travel  in  those  pure  mirrors  and  subtle  dwellings  with 
speed  of  imagination.  They  enter  thousands  of  places  at  the  same  time.  Despite  being 
restricted  particulars,  through  the  mystery  of  luminosity  impotent  and  subjugated 
creatures  like  the  sun  and  semi-luminous  beings  restricted  by  matter  like  spirit  beings 
may be present in numerous places while being in one place, thus becoming like absolute 
universals,  and  with  a  limited  power  of  choice  being  able  to  perform  many  matters 
simultaneously. 

Thus,  what  thing  may  hide  itself  from  address  of  Oneness  which  is  within  the 
manifestation  of  the  attributes  and  acts  of  the  Most  Pure  and  Holy  One  through  His 
universal  will,  absolute  power,  and  all-encompassing  knowledge?  The  Most  Holy  One, 
Who  is  far  beyond  and  exalted  above  matter;  free  and  exempt  from  any  restriction  or 
limitation  and  the  darkness  of  density;  of  the  sacred  lights  of  Whose  Names  all  these 
lights and luminous beings are but dense shadows; and of Whose beauty all existence and 
all  life  and  the  World  of  Spirits  and  the  World  of  Similitudes  are  semi-transparent 
mirrors;  Whose  attributes  are  all-encompassing  and  Whose  qualities,  universal?  What 
matter  could  be  difficult  for  Him?  What  thing  can  be  concealed  from  Him?  What 
individual  can  be  distant  from  Him?  What  person  can  draw  close  to  Him  without 
acquiring universality? 

Although  by  means  of  its  unrestricted  light  and  immaterial  reflection,  the  sun  is 
closer  to  you  than  the  pupil  of  your  eye,  since  you  are  restricted,  you  are  truly  distant 
from it. In order to draw close to it, you have to transcend numerous restrictions and pass 
over many universal degrees. Simply, in effect you have to expand to the size of the earth 
and  rise  as  far  as  the  moon, then  you  may  be  able  to  approach  directly  to  a  degree the 
sun’s  essential  level,  and  meet  with  it  without  veil.  In  just  the  same  way,  the  Glorious 
One  of  Beauty  and  Beauteous  One  of  Perfection  is  infinitely  close  to  you,  and  you  are 
infinitely  distant  from Him. If  your  heart has strength, and  your  mind, eminence, try to 
put the points in the comparison into practice.

SECOND RAY  

O my senseless soul! You say that verses like, 

Indeed, His command when He wills a thing is, ‘Be!’, and it is,2 

It will be no more than a single blast, when lo! they will all be brought up before 
Us!3 

show  that the  existence  of  things  is  instantaneous  and  merely  through  a  command,  and 
that verses like, 

[Such is] the artistry of God, Who disposes of all things in perfect order,4 

Who has created everything in the best way5 

show that existence of things  is gradual, through  a vast power within knowledge, and a 
fine art within wisdom. What is the point of agreement between them?  
The Answer:  Relying on the effulgence of the Qur’an, we say: 
Firstly:  There  is  no  contradiction.  Some  are  like the  former,  like  primary  creation. 

And some are like the latter, like the repetition of creation... 

Secondly: The infinite order and extreme skill, fine art, and perfect creation together 
with the ease, speed, multiplicity, and extensiveness which are observed in beings testify 
decisively  to  the  existence  of  the  truths  of  these  two  sorts  of  verses.  Since  this  is  so, 
proving it to be true outside this and making that the point of discussion, is unnecessary. 
It  should  rather  be  asked:  ‘What  is  the  wisdom  in  them?  What  is  their  meaning  and 
purpose?’  Thus,  we  shall  point  to  this  wisdom  with  an  analogy  in  the  form  of  a 
comparison.  

For example, a craftsman like a tailor creates something artistic with much difficulty 
and employing many skills, and makes a model for it. Then he can make others similar to 
it quickly and without difficulty. Sometimes, even, it becomes so easy they are as though 
made  at  a  command,  and  they  acquire  a  powerful  order  in  that  way;  like  a  clock,  they 
function and work as though at the touch of a command. 

In  just  the  same  way,  after  making  this  palace  of  the  world  and  all  its  contents 
originally,  the  All-Wise  Maker  and  All-Knowing  Inscriber  gave  everything,  particular 
and universal, the whole and the parts, a specified measure  

                                                

2 Qur’an, 36:82. 
3 Qur’an, 36:53. 
4 Qur’an, 27:88. 
5 Qur’an, 32:7. 

 

213 

and  proportion  through  an  ordering  of  Divine  Determining,  like  a  model.  So,  look! 
Making  every  century  a  model,  the  Pre-Eternal  Inscriber  clothes  them  with  bejewelled 
new worlds through the miracles of His power. And making every year a scale, He sews 
skilfully  fashioned  new  universes  through  the  wonders  of  His  mercy  according  to their 
stature. And making every day a line, He writes the decorated, constantly renewed beings 
in them through the subtleties of His wisdom. 

Furthermore,  just  as  that  Absolutely  Powerful  One  makes  each  century,  each  year, 
and each day a model, so He makes the face of the earth, and the mountains and plains, 
gardens and orchards, and trees each a model. He continuously sets up new universes on 
the  earth  and  creates  new  worlds.  He  removes  one  world  and  replaces  it  with  another, 
well-ordered world. Season after season He displays the miracles of His power and gifts 
of  His  mercy  in  all  the  gardens  and  orchards.  He  writes  them  all  as  wisdom-displaying 
books,  establishes  them  as  kitchens  of  His  mercy,  and  clothes  them  in  ever-renewed 
garments  full of art. Every spring He arrays all trees  in raiments of  brocade and adorns 
them  with  fresh  jewels  like  pearls.  He  fills  their  hands  with  the  star-like  gifts  of  His 
mercy.  

Thus, the One Who performs these matters with infinitely fine art and perfect order 
and changes with infinite wisdom, bounty, and perfection of power and art the travelling 
worlds  which  follow  on  one  after  the  other  and  are  attached  to  the  string  of  time,  is 
certainly  All-Powerful  and  All-Wise.  He  is  All-Seeing  and  All-Knowing  to  an  infinite 
degree. Chance cannot interfere in His works. He is the All-Glorious One Who decrees, 

Indeed, His command when He wills a thing is, ‘Be!’, and it is,6  

and,  

And the decision of the Hour is as the twinkling of an eye, or even closer,7 

and  both  proclaims  the  perfection  of  His  power,  and  that  in  relation  to  His  power  the 
resurrection and Great Gathering are most easy and free of trouble. Since His creational 
command comprises power and will, and all things are entirely subjugated and obedient 
to His command, and He creates with no difficulty or hindrance, in order to express the 
absolute ease in His creating, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition decrees that He does 
this through a mere command. 

To Conclude:  Some verses proclaim the extremely fine art and infinite perfection of 
wisdom  in  beings,  especially  at  the  start  of  their  creation.  Others  describe  the  extreme 
ease and speed and infinite obedience and lack of difficulty in the recreation and return of 
things in particular.

THIRD RAY 

verses like, 

and,  

and, 

and, 

In Whose hand is the dominion of all things,9 

And We are closer to him than his jugular vein,10 

show that God is infinitely close to us. And yet, the verses, 

And to Him shall you return.11 

The  angels  ascend  to  Him  in  a  day  the  measure  of  which  is  fifty  thousand 
years,12 

and, the Hadith which says: ‘God is beyond seventy thousand veils,’13 and truths like the 
Prophet’s  Ascension  show  that  we  are  infinitely  distant  from  Him.  I  would  like  an 
explanation which will bring this profound mystery closer to the understanding. 

The Answer:  Then listen to the following: 
Firstly:  At  the  end  of  the  First  Ray  we  said  that  although  with  regard  to  its 
unrestricted light and immaterial reflection, the sun is closer to you than the pupil of your 
eye,  which  is  the  window  of  your  spirit  and  its  mirror,  since  you  are  restricted  and 
imprisoned in materiality, you are extremely distant from it. You can make contact with it 
only through some of  its reflections and shadows, and  meet with  it through a sort of  its 
minor  and  particular  manifestations,  and  draw  close  to  its  colours,  which  are  like  a 
category  of  attribute,  and  to  its  rays  and  manifestations,  which  are  like  a  class  of  its 
names. If you want to approach the sun’s essential level and meet with the sun’s essence 
directly  in  person,  then  you  have  to transcend  very  many  restrictions  and  traverse  very 
many levels of universality. Simply, after abstracting yourself from materiality, becoming 
enlarged to the extent of the earth, expanding in the spirit like the air, rising as far as the 
moon  and  resembling  the  full-moon,  only  then  can  you  claim  to  meet  with  it  in  person 
without veil and to draw close to it to any degree. 

In  just  the  same  way,  the  All-Glorious  One  of  Perfection,  the  Peerless  One  of 

Beauty, the Necessarily Existent One, the Giver of Existence to All

9 Qur’an, 36:83.

215 

Beings, the Eternal Sun, the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, is closer to you 
than yourself. Yet you are infinitely distant from Him. If you have the power, put the fine 
points in the comparison into practice... 

Secondly: For example, And God’s is the highest similitude, among many names, a 
king’s  name  of  ‘Commander’  appears  in  many  spheres,  one  within  the  other.  It  has  a 
manifestation and appearance  in spheres extensive and  narrow, universal and particular, 
from  the  universal  sphere  of  Commander-in-Chief,  to  those  of  Field  Marshal  and 
General, then those of captain and corporal. Now, in his military duties, a private soldier 
holds as his authority the minor point of commandership manifest in the rank of corporal; 
he  is  in  touch  with  and  connected  to  the  Commander-in-Chief  through  this  minor 
manifestation  of  his  name.  If  he  wishes  to  get  in  touch  with  him  through  his  essential 
name and meet with him through that title, he will have to rise from the corporalship to 
the universal rank of Commander-in-Chief. That is to say, the king is extremely close to 
the soldier through his name, decree, law and knowledge, his telephone and regulations, 
and if he is luminous like a saint who is an abdal, with his presence in person. Nothing at 
all  can  be  an  obstacle  or  obstruction  for  him.  Whereas  the  soldier  is  extremely  distant. 
Thousands of degrees form obstructions, and thousands of veils intervene. But sometimes 
the  king  is  compassionate,  and  contrary  to  his  practice,  receives  a  soldier  into  his 
presence and favours him with his grace. 

In  just the same way,  although the  All-Glorious  One, the Lord of the command of, 
‘Be!’, and it is, for Whom the suns and stars are like His soldiers under orders, is closer 
to all things than they themselves, all things are infinitely distant from Him. If you want 
to  enter  the  presence  of  His  grandeur  without  veil,  you  have  to  pass  through  seventy 
thousands of veils of darkness and light, that is, material and physical veils and the veils 
of the Divine Names and attributes, rise through the thousands of particular and universal 
degrees of manifestation of each Name, pass on through the most elevated levels of His 
attributes, and ascend as far as the Sublime Throne, which manifests His Greatest Name, 
and  if  you  are  not  the  object  of  favour  and  attraction,  work  and  journey  spiritually  for 
thousands of years. For example, if you want to draw close to Him through His Name of 
Creator, you have to have a relationship through the particularities of your own Creator, 
then in regard to the Creator of all mankind, then through the title of Creator of all living 
creatures, then through the Name of Creator of all beings. Otherwise you will remain in 
shadow and only find a minor manifestation. 

A REMINDER: Because of his impotence, the king in the comparison put means like Field Marshal 
and General in the degrees of his names. But the Absolutely Powerful One, in Whose hand is the dominion 
of  all  things,  has  no  need  of  intermediaries.  Intermediaries  are  only  apparent;  a  veil  to  His  dignity  and 
grandeur.  They  are  heralds  and  observers  of  the  sovereignty  of  His  dominicality  within  worship,  awe, 
impotence,  and  want.  They  are  not  His  assistants,  and  cannot  be  partners  in  the  sovereignty  of  His 
dominicality.

FOURTH RAY 

O  my  lazy  soul!  Like  the  soldier  in  the  previous  comparison  was  received  into the 
royal presence as a pure favour, the reality of the five daily prayers, which are like a sort 
of Ascension, are a being received into the presence of the All-Glorious One of Beauty, 
the Beauteous One of Glory, Who is the True Object of Worship, as an instance of pure 
mercy. Declaring ‘God is Most Great!’, it is to traverse the two worlds either in fact, or in 
the  imagination,  or  by  intention,  be  divested  of  the  restrictions  of  materiality,  pass  to  a 
universal  degree  of  worship  or  a  shadow  or  form  of  universality,  and  being  honoured 
with  a  sort  of  presence,  it  is  to  manifest  the  address  of  ‘You  alone  do  we  worship!’ 
(everyone according to his own capacity); it is a most elevated attainment. The repetition 
of ‘God is Most Great! God is Most Great!’ in the actions of the prayers indicates rising 
through  the  degrees  of  spiritual  progress,  and  ascending  from  minor  particulars  to 
universal spheres, and is a concise title of the perfections of Divine sublimity which are 
beyond our knowledge. It is as if each ‘God is Most Great!’ indicates traversing a step in 
the Ascension. To attain to a shadow or a ray of this reality of the prayers either in fact, 
or by intention, or with the imagination, is a great happiness. 

The  frequent  declaring  of  ‘God  is  Most  Great!’  during  the  Hajj  is  for  the  above 
reason.  For  the  blessed  Hajj  is  worship  at  a  universal  level  for  everyone.  Just  as  on  a 
special day  like a  festival a soldier goes to the king’s celebrations  like a General  in the 
sphere  of  General,  and  receives  his  favours,  in  the  same  way,  a  Hajji,  no  matter  how 
lowly, is turned towards his Sustainer under the title Mighty Sustainer of every region of 
the  earth,  like  a  saint  who  has  traversed  all  the  degrees.  He  is  honoured  with  universal 
worship. For sure, the universal degrees of dominicality opened with the key of the Hajj, 
and the horizons of the tremendousness of Godhead which are visible to his eye through 
its  telescope,  and  the  spheres  of  worship  which  gradually  unfold  to  his  heart  and 
imagination  through  its  observances,  and  the  heat,  wonder,  awe,  and  dread  of 
dominicality caused by the levels of sublimity and last stage of manifestation, can only be 
quietened by ‘God is Most Great! God is Most Great!’, and those observed or imagined 
unfolded degrees can only  be proclaimed  by  it. After the Hajj, this  meaning  is  found  in 
various exalted and universal degrees in the Festival (‘Eid) Prayers, the prayers for rain, 
and those recited at solar and lunar eclipses, and in prayers performed as a congregation. 
Thus, the importance of the marks and observances of Islam, also even if of the category 
of Sunna, lies in this reason. 

Glory be unto the One Who has placed His treasuries between the Kaf and the 
Nun. 

So glory be unto Him in Whose hand is the dominion  

 

217 

of all things, and to Him will you all be brought back.14 

Glory be unto You, we have no knowledge save that which You have taught us; 
indeed You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.15 
O our Sustainer! Do not take us to task if we forget or unwittingly do wrong!16 * 
O our Sustainer! Let not our hearts deviate after You have guided us, and grant 
us  Mercy  from  Your  presence,  for  You  are  the  Granter  of  bounties  without 
measure.17 

And grant blessings and peace to Your Most Noble Messenger, the manifester of 
Your  Greatest  Name,  and  to  his  Family,  and  Companions,  and  brothers,  and 
followers. Amen. O Most Merciful of the Merciful!

A Short Addendum 

The All-Powerful and All-Knowing One, the All-Wise Maker, shows His power and 
His wisdom and that chance can in no way interfere in His works through the system and 
order  His  rules  and  practices  in  the  universe  demonstrate  in  the  form  of  laws.  So  too, 
through  exceptions  to  the  laws,  the  wonders  of  His  practices,  superficial  changes, 
differences  in  individual  characteristics,  and  changes  in  the  times  of  appearance  and 
descent, He shows His  volition, will, choice, that He  is the  Agent with choice, and that 
He  is  under  no  restrictions  whatsoever.  Thus,  rending  the  veil  of  monotony,  and 
proclaiming that everything is in need of Him every moment for everything in every way 
and is obedient to His dominicality, He dispels heedlessness, and turns the gazes of man 
and jinn from causes to the Producer of Causes. The statements of the Qur’an look to this 
principle. 

For example, in most places some fruit-bearing trees produce fruit one year, that is, it 

is given to their hands from the treasury of mercy, and they  

                                                

14 Qur’an, 36:83. 
15 Qur’an, 2:32. 
16 Qur’an, 2:286. 
17 Qur’an, 3:8. 

 

218 

offer it. Then the following year while all apparent causes are present, they do not take it 
and  offer  it;  that  is,  they  do  not  produce  fruit.  Also,  for  example,  contrary  to  other 
necessities,  the  times  rain  falls  are  so  changeable  that  it  has  been  included  among  ‘the 
Five  Hidden  Things.’18  For  the  most  important  position  in  existence  is  that  of  life  and 
mercy. And rain is the source of life and pure mercy. Thus, the water of life and rain of 
mercy does not enter under a monotonous law, which is a veil and leads to heedlessness, 
rather,  the  All-Glorious  One,  Who  is  Most  Merciful  and  All-Compassionate,  and  the 
Bestower of Bounties and Giver of Life, holds it in His hand directly, without veil, so that 
the doors of supplication and thanks will all the time be left open. And, for example, the 
giving of  sustenance and determining of particular features are works of special  favour, 
and their occurring in unexpected ways shows in excellent fashion the will and choice of 
the  Sustainer.  You  may  make  further  comparisons  with  other  Divine  acts,  like  the 
disposals of the air and weather and the subjugation of the clouds.

The Seventeenth Word 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
That which is on earth We have made as a glittering show for the earth, in order 
that We may test them, as to which of them are best in conduct * Verily what is 
on earth We shall make but as dust and dry soil.1 * What is the life of this world 
but play and amusement?2 

 [This Word consists of two elevated Stations, and one brilliant Addendum.] 

The All-Compassionate Creator, the Munificent Provider, the All-Wise Maker made 
this  world  in  the  form  of  a  festival  and  celebration  for  the  World  of  Spirits  and  spirit 
beings. Adorning  it  with the wondrous embroideries of all His Names, He clothes each 
spirit, great or small, elevated or lowly,  in a  body decked out with senses, suitable to it 
and appropriate for benefiting from the innumerable, various good things and bounties in 
the festival; He gives each a corporeal being and sends it to the spectacle once. And He 
divides  the  festival,  which  is  most  extensive  in  regard  to  both  time  and  space,  into 
centuries,  years,  seasons,  and  even  days  and  their  parts,  and  makes  them  all  exalted 
festivals in the form of parades for all the groups of His creatures with spirits and for His 
plant and vegetable artefacts. Especially the face of the earth in spring and summer, it is a 
series  of  festivals  for  the  groups  of  small  beings  so  glittering  it  draws  the  gazes  of  the 
spirit beings and angels and the dwellers of the heavens in the high levels of the world. 
For those who think and contemplate it is a place for reflection so wonderful, the mind is 
powerless  to  describe  it.  But  in  the  face  of  the  manifestations  of  the  Divine  Names  of 
Most Merciful and Giver of Life in this Divine feast and dominical festival, the Names of 
Subduer  and  Dealer  of  Death  appear  with  death  and  separation.  And  this  is  apparently 
unconformable with the all-embracing mercy of, 

My Mercy encompasses all things.3 

However,  in  reality  there  are  several  ways  in  which  it  is  conformable,  and  one  of 

these is as follows: 

After each group of beings has completed its turn in the parade and the  

                                                

1 Qur’an, 18:7-8. 
2 Qur’an, 6:32. 
3 Qur’an, 7:156. 

 

220 

desired  results  have  been  obtained  from  it,  in  a  compassionate  way  the  Most  Generous 
Maker and Compassionate Creator makes  most of them  feel weariness and disgust with 
the  world,  and  bestows  on  them  a  desire  for  rest  and  a  longing  to  migrate  to  another 
world. And when they are to be discharged from their duties of life, He awakens in their 
spirits a compelling desire for their original home.  

Moreover, it  is  not far  from the  infinite  mercy of the Most Merciful that  just as He 
bestows the rank of  martyrdom on  a soldier  who perishes on account of  his duty while 
fighting, and rewards a sheep slaughtered as a sacrifice by giving it an eternal corporeal 
existence  in the  hereafter and the rank of  being a  mount  for  its owner on the Bridge of 
Sirat4  like  Buraq,  so  too  with  other  animals  and  beings  with  spirits  who  perish  while 
performing  the  dominical  duties  peculiar  to  their  natures  and  in  obeying  the  Divine 
commands,  and  who  suffer  severe  distress,  –  it  is  not  unlikely  that  there  should  be  for 
them  in the  inexhaustible treasuries of His  mercy a  sort of spiritual reward and kind of 
wage suitable to their capacities, and that they should not be unduly troubled at departing 
this world, indeed, that they should be pleased. None knows the Unseen save God. 

However, although man, the noblest of beings with spirits and the one who benefits 
most  from  the  festivals  with  regard  to  both  quality  and  quantity,  is  captivated  by  the 
world and absorbed in it, as a work of mercy, the Most Merciful induces in him a state of 
mind whereby he feels disgust at the world and a longing to travel to the eternal realm. A 
person whose humanity is not plunged in misguidance profits from that state of mind, and 
departs  with  a  tranquil  heart.  Now,  by  way  of  example,  we  shall  explain  five  of  the 
aspects which produce that state of mind. 

The  First:  By  showing  with  the  season  of  old  age  the  stamp  of  transience  and 
decline  on  the  beautiful  and  inviting  things  of  this  world,  and  their  bitter  meaning,  it 
makes a person feel disgust at the world and causes him to seek a permanent beloved in 
place of the transient. 

The  Second:  Since  ninety-nine  per  cent  of  all  the  friends  to  whom  a  person  is 
attached have departed this world and settled in another, impelled by his heart-felt love, it 
bestows on him a longing for the place they have gone to, and makes him meet death and 
the appointed hour with joy. 

The  Third:  By  means  of  certain  things,  it  makes  a  person  realize  the  infinite 
weakness and  impotence  in  man, and understand how heavy are the burdens of  life and 
responsibilities of living, and awakens in him a serious wish for rest and a sincere desire 
to go to another world. 

The Fourth: Through the light of belief, it shows to the heart of a believer that death 
is not execution, but a change of abode; that the grave is not the mouth of a dark well, but 
the door to light-filled worlds; and that for

all its glitter, the world is like a prison in relation to the hereafter. To be released from the 
prison  of  this  world  and  enter  the  gardens  of  Paradise,  and  pass  from  the  troublesome 
turmoil of bodily life to the world of rest and the arena where spirits soar, and to slip free 
from  the  vexatious  noise  of  creatures  and  go  to the  presence  of  the  Most  Merciful  is  a 
journey, indeed, a happiness, to be desired with a thousand lives. 

The  Fifth:  By  informing  a  person  who  heeds  the  Qur’an  about  the  knowledge  of 
reality  it contains, and through the  light of reality the world’s true nature, it  makes  him 
realize that love for the world and attachment to it are quite meaningless. That is, it says 
the following to man, and proves it: 

‘The world is a book of the Eternally Besought One. Its letters and words point not to 
themselves  but to the essence, attributes and Names of another. In which  case,  learn  its 
meaning and grasp it, but ignore its decorations, then go! 

‘The world is also a tillage; sow and reap your crop, and preserve it. Throw away the 

chaff, and give it no importance!... 

‘The world  is also a collection of  mirrors which  continuously pass on one after the 
other;  so  know  the  One  Who  is  manifest  in  them,  see  His  lights,  understand  the 
manifestations of the Names which appear in them and love the One they signify. Cease 
your attachment for the fragments of glass which are doomed to be broken and perish!... 

‘The world is also a travelling place of trade. So do your commerce and come; do not 
chase in vain the caravans which flee from you and pay you no attention. Do not weary 
yourself for nothing!... 

‘The  world  is  also  a  temporary  exhibition.  So  look  at  it  and  take  lessons.  Pay 
attention, not to its apparent, ugly face, but to its hidden, beautiful face which looks to the 
Eternal All-Beauteous One. Go for a pleasant and beneficial promenade, then return, and 
do  not  weep  like  a  silly  child  at  the  disappearance  of  scenes  displaying  fine  views  and 
showing beautiful things, and do not be anxious!... 

‘The world is also a guesthouse. So eat and drink within the limits permitted by the 
Generous Host Who made it, and offer thanks. Act and behave within the bounds of His 
law. Then leave it without looking behind you, and go. Do not interfere in it in a delirious 
or officious  manner. Do not busy  yourself  for  nothing with things  which part from  you 
and do not concern you. Do not attach yourself to passing things and drown!..’ 

This Fifth Aspect shows the secrets in the world’s inner face through apparent truths 
like  these,  and  greatly  lightens  the  parting  from  it.  Indeed,  to  those  who  are  aware  it 
makes parting desirable for them, and shows that there is a trace of mercy in everything 
and  every  aspect  of  it.  The  Qur’an  indicates  these  Five  Aspects,  and  its  verses  point to 
other particular aspects. 

Woe to that person who has no share of these five Aspects!

The Second Station 
of the Seventeenth Word5

 

Cry not out at misfortune, O wretch, come, trust in God! 
For know that crying out compounds the misfortune and is a great error. 
* * * 
Find misfortune’s Sender, and know it is a gift within gift, and pleasure. 
So leave crying out and offer thanks; like the nightingale, smile through your 

tears! 

* * * 
If you find Him not, know the world is all pain within pain, transience and loss. 
So why lament at a small misfortune while upon you is a worldful of woe? 
Come trust in God! 
* * * 
Trust in God! Laugh in misfortune’s face; it too will laugh. 
As it laughs, it will diminish; it will be changed and transformed. 
* * * 
Know, O arrogant one, happiness in this world is in abandoning it. 
To know God is enough. Abandon the world; all things will be for you. 
* * * 
To be arrogant is total loss; whatever you do, all things will be against you. 
So both states demand abandoning the world here. 
* * * 
Abandoning the world is to regard it as God’s property, with His permission, 
in His Name; 
If you want to do trade, it lies in making this fleeting life eternal. 
* * * 
If you seek yourself, it is both rotten and without foundation. 
If you seek the world outside, the stamp of ephemerality is upon it. 
* * * 
That means there is no value in taking it; the goods in this market are all rotten. 
So pass on; the sound goods are all lined up beyond it.

verse intentionally. They rather took on that form to a degree due to the perfect order of the truths they 
express.

A FRUIT OF THE BLACK MULBERRY 

[The Old Said spoke this with the tongue of the New Said 
under the blessed mulberry tree.] 

The one I’m addressing isn’t Ziya Pasha, it’s those enamoured of Europe. 
The one speaking isn’t my soul, it’s my heart in the name of the students of the Qur’an. 
* * * 
The previous words are all truth; beware, don’t lose course, don’t exceed their bounds! 
Don’t heed the ideas of Europe and deviate, or they’ll make you regret it! 
* * * 
You see the most enlightened of them, in brilliance their standard-bearer, 
Exclaim in bewilderment: Of whom, to whom can I complain? 
* * * 
The Qur’an says, and I say too – I won’t hold back: 
I lodge my complaint with Him. I’m not confused, like you. 
* * * 
I cry out to the True God; I don’t slip away, like you. 
I shout my cause from the ground to the skies; I don’t flee, like you. 
* * * 
For all the Qur’an’s cause is light upon light; I don’t renege, like you. 
In the Qur’an is truth and wisdom; I’ll prove it. I count as nothing hostile philosophy. 
* * * 
In the Criterion are diamond truths; I take them to myself, not sell them, like you. 
I journey from creation to Creator; I don’t lose the way, like you. 
* * * 
I pass over thorny paths, I don’t tread on them, like you. 
From the earth to the Throne, I offer thanks; I don’t neglect it, like you. 
* * * 

 

224 

I look on death and the appointed hour as a friend; I am not frightened, like you. 
I’ll enter the grave smiling, not trembling, like you. 
* * * 
I don’t see it as a monster’s mouth, a beast’s lair, descending to nothingness, 
like you. 
It joins me with my friends; I’m not vexed at the grave, like you. 
* * * 
It’s the door of Mercy, gate of Light, portal of Truth; I am not discomforted by it; 
I won’t retreat. 
Saying: In the Name of God, I’ll knock on it.6 I’ll not look behind me nor feel terror. 
* * * 
Saying: All Praise be to God!, I’ll lay down and find ease. I’ll suffer no trouble 
nor remain solitary. 
Saying, God is Most Great!, I’ll hear the Call to the Resurrection and rise up,7 
I won’t hang back from the Great Gathering, or the Mighty Mosque. 
* * * 
I’ll feel no distress, thanks to Divine favour, the Qur’an’s light, 
and the effulgence of belief; 
Not stopping, I’ll hasten, fly, to the shade of the Most Merciful’s Throne. 
God willing, I won’t go astray, like you. 
 
*  *  * 

                                                

6 I won’t exclaim: ‘Alas!’, and flee. 
7 I’ll hear the Call of Israfil on the dawn of the Resurrection, and declaring, ‘God is Most Great!’, shall 

rise up. I won’t hold back from the Great Gathering and Congress of Prayers.

A SUPPLICATION WHICH OCCURRED 
TO ME IN PERSIAN 

 [This supplication occurred to my heart in Persian, and was therefore written in  
that language.8 It was first included in my published work, Hubab.] 

O my Sustainer! Heedlessly not trusting in You but in my own power and will, I cast 
an eye over ‘the six aspects’ searching for a cure for my ills. Alas, I could find no cure 
for them, and I understood it was being said to me: ‘Are  your  ills  not sufficient as cure 
for you?’ 

In  heedlessness  I  looked  to  past  time  on  my  right  to  find  solace,  but  I  saw  that 
yesterday  appeared  to  be  my  father’s  grave  and  past  time  as  the  huge  tomb  of  all  my 
forbears. It filled me with horror rather than consolation.(*) 

(*) Belief shows that horrific vast grave to be a familiar and enlightened meeting and a gathering of 

friends. 

Then I looked to the future on the left, but again I could find no cure. For tomorrow 
appeared  as  my  grave  and  the  future  as  the  vast  tomb  of  my  contemporaries  and  the 
forthcoming generations; it afforded not a feeling of familiarity, but one of fright.(*) 

(*) Belief and the peace of belief shows that terrible huge grave to be a feast of the Most Merciful in 

delightful palaces of bliss. 

Since  no good appeared from the  left either, I  looked at the present day, and I saw 

that it resembled a bier; it was bearing my desperately struggling corpse.(*) 

(*) Belief shows the bier to be a place of trade and a glittering guesthouse. 
Thus, I could find no cure from this aspect either, so I raised my head and looked at 
the top of the tree of my life. But I saw that its single fruit was my corpse; it was looking 
down on me from the tree-top.(*) 

(*) Belief shows the tree’s fruit to be not the corpse, but the worn out home of my spirit, which will 
manifest eternal life and is destined for everlasting happiness, from which it has departed in order to travel 
among the stars. 

Despairing of that aspect too, I lowered my head. I looked and saw that the dust of 
my bones underfoot had mixed with the dust of my first creation. It afforded no cure, but 
added further pain to my ills.(*) 

(*) Belief shows the dust to be the door leading to mercy and a curtain before the halls of Paradise. 

                                                

the basis of the translation here. [Tr.] 

8 The Supplication is included in the original together with an enlarged Turkish rendering, which is 

 

226 

I  turned  away  from  that  too  and  looked  behind  me,  where  I  saw  a  transient  world 
without  foundation  revolving  and  departing  in  the  valleys  of  nothingness  and  the 
darkness of non-existence. It was no salve for my ills, it rather added the poison of horror 
and fright.(*) 

(*) Belief shows the world revolving in darkness to consist of missives of the Eternally Besought One 
and pages of Divine inscriptions, which, having completed their duties and expressed their meanings, have 
left their results in existence in their place. 

Since I could see no good in that either, I switched my gaze to before me. I saw that 
the door of the grave stood open at the end of my road. The highway leading to eternity 
beyond it, struck my gaze from afar.(*) 

(*) Since belief shows the door of the grave to open onto the world of light and the road to lead to 

eternal happiness, it was both a salve for my ills, and a cure. 

Thus, rather than receiving consolation and a feeling of familiarity, I felt only horror 
and fear at these six aspects. And apart from the faculty of will I had nothing in my hand 
with which to withstand them and act in the face of them.(*) 

(*) Belief gives a document for relying on an infinite power in place of the power of choice, which is 

like the smallest indivisible particle; indeed, belief itself is a document. 

But the  human  weapon  called  the  faculty  of  will  both  lacks  power  and  its  range  is 
short. And it is inaccurate. It cannot create, and apart from ‘acquiring,’ can do nothing.(*) 
(*)  Belief  causes  the  faculty  of  will  to  be  employed  in  God’s  name,  and  makes  it  sufficient  before 
everything it may face. Like when a soldier employs his insignificant strength on account of the state, he 
can perform deeds thousands of times greater than his own strength... 

It can neither penetrate the past nor discern the future, and in regard to my hopes and 

fears concerning these, was of no benefit.(*) 

(*) Belief takes its reins from the hand of the animal body and hands them over to the heart and the 
spirit, and may therefore penetrate the past and the future. For the sphere of life of the heart and spirit is 
broad. 

The arena of the faculty of will is brief present time and the passing present instant. 
Thus, despite all my needs and weakness, want and poverty, and my wretched state 
induced by the horrors and terrors arising from the six aspects, clearly written on the page 
of  my  being by the pen of power, and  included  in  my  nature, were desires stretching to 
eternity and hopes spreading through eternity. 

Indeed,  whatever  there  is  in  the  world,  there  are  samples  of  it  in  my  being.  I  am 

connected to everything. It is for them that I am caused to work. 
The sphere of need stretches as far as the eye can see. 
In fact, wherever the imagination goes, the sphere of need extends that far. There is 

need there too. Whatever man lacks, he is in need of. That  

 

227 

which he does not have, he needs.  And what he lacks is endless. 

But then the extent of  his power extends only as  far as  his short arm reaches. That 
means  my  want  and  needs  are  as  great  as  the  world.  Whereas  my  capital  is  as 
infinitesimal as an indivisible particle. 

So, of what use is the faculty of will, worth twopence in relation to my needs which 
encompass  the  world  and  can  only  be  obtained  for  millions  of  liras?  They  cannot  be 
bought with it, and cannot be gained by it. In which case, one has to search for another 
solution. 

The solution is this: to forego one’s own will and leave matters to the Divine will; to 
give up one’s own power and strength, and seeking refuge in the power and strength of 
Almighty God, to adhere to true reliance on Him.  

‘O  my  Sustainer!  Since  the  way  to  be  saved  is  this,  I  forego  my  own  will  in  Your 
way,  and  I  give  up  my  egotism.  Then  Your  grace  may  take  me  by  the  hand  out  of 
compassion for my impotence and weakness, and Your mercy may take pity on my need 
and indigence and be a support for me, and open its door for me.’ 

Yes,  whoever  finds  the  boundless  sea  of  mercy,  surely  does  not  rely  on  his  own 

mirage-like will and choice; he does not abandon mercy and have recourse to his will. 

Alas! We have been deceived. We supposed the life of this world to be constant, and 
so have lost everything. Yes, this passing life is but a sleep; it passes like a dream. This 
frail life flies like the wind, and departs. 

Arrogant man, who relies on himself and supposes he will live for ever, is doomed to 
die.  He  passes  swiftly.  The  world,  too,  man’s  house,  tumbles  into the  darkness  of  non-
existence. Hopes do not last, while pains endure in the spirit. 

Since the reality is this, come, my wretched soul, which yearns for life, is enamoured 
of the world and afflicted with endless hopes and pains! Awake and come to your senses! 
As the fire-fly relies on its own miniscule light and remains in the boundless darkness of 
the night, and since it does not rely on itself, the honey-bee finds the sun of daytime, and 
gazes on its friends, the flowers, gilded with the sunlight; if you rely on yourself and your 
being and your ego, you will resemble the fire-fly. Whereas if you sacrifice your transient 
being  in the way of the  Creator Who gave  it to you,  you will  find an unending  light of 
existence. So sacrifice it! For your being is a trust given to you for safekeeping. 

Moreover,  it  is  His  property,  and  it  is  He  Who  bestowed  it.  So  do  not  scorn  it, 
sacrifice it unhesitatingly. Sacrifice it so that it will be made permanent. For negation of a 
negation  is  an  affirmation.  That  is,  if  non-being  is  not,  there  is  being.  If  non-being  is 
negated, existence comes into being. 

 

228 

The All-Generous Creator buys His own property from you, and gives you the high 
price of Paradise in return. Also, He looks after that property well for you, and increases 
its value. And He will return it to you in both enduring and perfect form. O my soul! Do 
not  delay!  Do  this  trade  which  is  profitable  in  five  respects,  and  be  saved  from  five 
losses; make a fivefold profit all at once! 

*  *  * 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
But when it set, he said: ‘I love not those that set.’9 

It made me weep, the verse I love not those that set, which was uttered by Abraham 

(Peace be upon him), and announces the universe’s passing and death. 

The  eyes  of  my  heart  wept  at  it,  pouring  out  bitter  tear-drops.  Each  tear-drop  was 
sorely sad as the eyes of my heart wept. The verse causes others to weep, and as though 
weeps  itself.  The  following  lines  in  Persian  are  my  tear-drops,  they  are  a  sort  of 
commentary  of  some  words  present  within  the  Divine  Word  of  God’s  Wise  One,  the 
Prophet Muhammad. 

A beloved who is hidden through setting is not beautiful, for those doomed to decline 
cannot be truly beautiful. They may not loved with the heart, which is created for eternal 
love and is the mirror of the Eternally Besought One, and should not be loved with it. 

A desired one who is doomed to be lost on setting; such a one is not worthy of the 
heart’s attachment, the mind’s preoccupation. He may not be the object of desires. He is 
not worthy of being regretted with the sorrow and grief that follows. So why should the 
heart worship such a one and be bound to him? 

One  sought  who  is  lost  in  ephemerality;  I  do  not  want  such  a  one.  For  I  am 

ephemeral, I do not want one who is thus. What should I do? 

A worshipped one who is buried in death; I shall not call him, I shall not seek refuge 
with him. For I am infinitely needy and impotent. One who is impotent can find no cure 
for my boundless ills. He can spread no salve on my eternal wounds. How can one who 
cannot save himself from death be an object of worship? 

                                                

9 Qur’an, 6:76. 

 

229 

Indeed, the reason, which is obsessed with externals, cries out despairingly at seeing 
the  deaths  of  the  things  it  worships  in  the  universe,  and  the  spirit,  which  seeks  for  an 
eternal beloved, utters the cry:  I love not those that set. 

I do not want separation, I do not desire separation, I cannot abide separation... 
Meetings  followed  immediately  by  separation  are  not  worth  sorrow  and  grief,  they 
are not worthy of being longed for. For just as the passing of pleasure is pain, imagining 
the passing of pleasure is also a pain. The works of all the metaphorical lovers, that is, the 
works of poetry on  love, are all cries at the pain arising  from  imagining this passing. If 
you were to constrain the spirit of all the  works of poetry,  from each would  flow these 
grievous cries. 

Thus,  it  is  due  to  the  pain  and  tribulations  of  those  meetings  stained  with 
transitoriness, those sorrowful, metaphorical loves, that my heart weeps and cries through 
the weeping of, I love not those that set. 

If  you  want  permanence  in  this  transitory  world,  permanence  comes  from 
transitoriness. Find transience with regard to your evil-commanding soul so that you may 
be enduring. 

Divest yourself of bad morals, the basis of the worship of this world. Be transitory! 
Sacrifice your goods and property in the way of the True Beloved. See the ends of beings, 
which point to non-existence, for the way leading to permanence in this world starts from 
transitoriness. 

The  human  mind,  which  plunges  into  causes,  is  bewildered  at the  upheavals  of  the 
passing of the world, and laments despairingly. While the conscience, which desires true 
existence, severs the connection with metaphorical beloveds and transient beings through 
crying  like  Abraham,  I  love  not  those  that  set,  and  it  binds  itself  to  the  Truly  Existent 
One, and Eternal Beloved. 

O my ignorant soul! Know that the world and its beings are certainly ephemeral, but 
you  may  find  a  way  leading  to  permanence  in  each  ephemeral  thing,  and  may  see  two 
flashes, two mysteries, of the manifestations of the Undying Beloved’s Beauty. 

Yes, it is within the bounty that the bestowal is to be seen and the favour of the Most 
Merciful  perceived.  If  you  pass  from  bounty  to  bestowal,  you  will  find  the  Bestower. 
Also, each work of the Eternally Besought One makes known the All-Glorious Maker’s 
Names like a missive. If you pass from the decoration to the meaning, you will find the 
One signified by way of His Names. Since you can find the kernel, the essence, of these 
ephemeral  beings,  obtain  it.  Then  without  pity  you  can  throw  away  their  meaningless 
shells and externals onto the flood of ephemerality. 

 

230 

Among beings there is no work which is not a most meaningful embodied word and 
does  not  cause  to  be  read  numerous  of  the  Glorious  Maker’s  Names.  Since  beings  are 
words, words of power, read their meanings and place them in your heart. Fearlessly cast 
words  without  meaning  onto  the  winds  of  transience.  Do  not  concern  yourself  looking 
behind them, needlessly occupying yourself. 

Since the chain of thought of the worldly mind, which worships externals and whose 
capital consists of ‘objective’ knowledge, leads to nothingness and non-existence, it cries 
out despairingly in its bewilderment and frustration. It seeks a true path leading to reality. 
Since the spirit has withdrawn from ‘those that set’ and the ephemeral, and the heart has 
given  up  its  metaphorical  beloveds,  and  the  conscience  too  has  turned  its  face  from 
transitory beings, you too, my wretched soul, attract the assistance of I love not those that 
set, like Abraham, and be saved. 

See how well Mawlana Jami expressed it, whose nature was kneaded with love and 

who was intoxicated with the cup of love: 

Yaki khwah(1)   Yaki khwan(2)    Yaki ju(3)   Yaki bin(4)   Yaki dan(5)  Yaki gu(6) 10 
That is,  
1. Want only One; the rest are not worth wanting. 
2. Call One; the others will not come to your assistance. 
3. Seek One; the rest are not worth it. 
4. See One; the others are not seen all the time; they hide themselves behind the veil 

of ephemerality. 

benefit. 

5. Know One; knowledge other than that which assists knowledge of Him is without 

6. Say One; words not concerning Him may be considered meaningless. 
Yes, Jami, you spoke the truth absolutely. The True Beloved, the True Sought One, 

the True Desired One, the True Object of Worship is He alone... 

For, in a mighty circle for the mentioning of the Divine Names, this world together 
with all its beings and their different tongues and various songs declares, There is no god 
but God; together they testify to Divine unity.  And binding the wound caused  by  I love 
not those that set, point to an Undying Beloved in place of all the metaphorical beloveds, 
attachment to whom has been severed.

 [About  twenty-five  years  ago  on  Yuşa  Tepesi  (Mount  Joshua)  above  the 
Istanbul Bosphorus, at a time I had decided to give up the world, a number of 
important  friends  came  to  me  in  order  to  call  me  back  to  the  world  and  my 
former  position.  I  told  them  to  leave  me  till  the  following  morning  so  that  I 
could seek guidance. That morning the following two Tables were imparted to 
my heart. They resemble poetry, but they are not. I have not changed them for 
the sake  of that blessed  memory, and they  have been  kept as they occurred to 
me. They were added to the Twenty-Third Word, and now have been included 
here on account of their ‘station’.] 

THE FIRST TABLE 

[The Table depicting the reality of the world of the heedless.] 

-- I came, and saw it was transitory. 

Don’t call me to the world; 
Heedlessness was a veil; -- I saw the light of truth was concealed.  
-- I saw were ephemeral, harmful. 
All the beings in existence, 
If you say, being, I dressed in it; -- Alas! It was non-being; I suffered much! 
If you say, life, I tasted it; 
-- I saw it was torment upon torment. 
The mind became pure torture;  -- I saw permanence to be tribulation. 
Life became pure whim;  -- I saw attainment to be pure loss. 
Deeds became pure hypocrisy;   -- I saw hopes to be pure pain. 
Union became parting itself; 
These lights became darkness; 
These voices became announcements 
   of death;  
Knowledge was transformed into fancy;  

-- I saw the cure to be the ill. 
-- I saw these friends to be orphans. 

-- I saw the living to be dead. 

ailments. 

   non-existence. 

Pleasure became pure pain; 
 
If you say the Beloved, I found him; 
 

   grievous pain. 

-- I saw existence to be compounded 

-- Alas! On separation I suffered 

--  I  saw  in  science  a  thousand

THE SECOND TABLE

the people of guidance, those with easy hearts.] 

   and extols Him. 

-- See, life is the mirror of God. 

-- And I saw the light of truth clearly. 

-- But, behold the Sun of Beauty! 
-- See, pain is pure pleasure. 

-- See, all sounds are the mentioning of God. 
-- See, each recites God’s praises 

Then the heedlessness passed, 
Existence became the proof of God; 
The mind became the key to treasuries.  -- See, transience is the door to permanence. 
The spark of perfection died, 
Separation became true union; 
Life became pure action; -- See, eternity is pure life. 
Darkness became the container of light;  -- See, there is true life in death. 
All things became familiar; 
All the atoms in existence – 
 
I found poverty to be a treasury of 
     wealth; -- See, in impotence is perfect strength. 
If you find God,  -- See, all things are yours. 
If you are the slave of the Owner of 
     All Things, 
If you are arrogant and claim to 
     own yourself,  -- See, it is trial and tribulation without end; 
Experience its boundless torment; 
If you are a true slave of God, 
Taste its uncountable rewards, 

-- See, it is a limitless pleasure and ease. 
-- Experience its infinite happiness... 

-- See, it is a calamity most crushing. 

-- See, His property is yours.

[Twenty-five  years ago in Ramadan after the  Afternoon Prayer, I read Shaykh 
‘Abd al-Qadir Geylani’s composition in verse about the Most Beautiful Names. 
I felt a desire to  write a supplication  with the Divine  Names, and at that time 
only this  much  was written. I wanted to  write a supplication similar to that of 
my  holy  master,  but,  alas!  I  have  no  ability  to  write  poetry  and  it  remained 
deficient. Nevertheless, the supplication was added to the Thirty-Third Letter of 
the Thirty-Third Word, known as the Thirty-Three Windows, then was included 
here on account of its ‘station’.] 

 
He is the Enduring One 

The Wise Judge of affairs, we are under His decree; 

He is the Just Arbiter; His are the heavens and the earth. 

The One Knowing of the secrets and hidden matters in His dominions; 

He is the All-Powerful, Self-Subsistent; His is all from the Throne to the ground.  

The Perceiver of the fine points and embroideries in His art; 

He is the Creator, the Loving One; His is the beauty and the splendour. 
The Glorious One Whose attributes are reflected in the mirrors in His creation; 

He is the Lord, the Most Holy; His is the might and the grandeur. 

The Originator of creatures; we form the embroideries of His art; 

He is the Constant, the Enduring One; His is the dominion and eternity. 

The Munificent Bestower of gifts; we are the caravan of His guests; 
He is the Provider, the Sufficer; His is the praise and laudation. 
The Beauteous Granter of gifts; We are the weavings of His knowledge; 
He is the Creator, the Faithful; His is the munificence, the giving. 

The Hearer of plaints and supplications in His creation; 

He is the Merciful, the Healer; His are the thanks and the praise. 

The Pardoner of the faults and sins of His servants; 

He is the Oft Forgiving, the Compassionate; His is forgiveness and acceptance. 

O my soul! Together with my heart, weep and cry, and say: 

I am ephemeral; I do not want one such as that.  
I am impotent; I do not want one such as that.  
I have surrendered my spirit to the Most Merciful; I do not want another.  
I want one, but I want an eternal friend.  
I am a mere speck, but I want an eternal sun.  
I am nothing, but nothing, yet I want these beings, all of them.

A FRUIT OF THE PINE, CEDAR, JUNIPER, 
AND BLACK CYPRESS TREES 
IN THE UPLANDS OF BARLA 

 [While being a part of the Eleventh Letter, this has 

One time during  my captivity while gazing  at the  majestic and wonderful  forms of 
the  pine,  cedar,  and  juniper  trees  on  the  mountain  top,  a  gentle  breeze  was  blowing. 
Transforming the scene into a magnificent, delightful, and clamorous display of dancing 
and a rapturous performance of praise and glorification, the enjoyment of watching it was 
transformed into instruction for my eyes and wisdom for my ears. I suddenly recalled the 
Kurdish lines of Ahmad al-Jizri, whose meaning is: 

‘Everyone  has  hastened  to  gaze  at  You  and  Your  Beauty;  they  are  acting  coyly 

before Your Beauty.’ 

My heart wept as follows, expressing their instructive meanings. The meaning of the 
verses in Persian written at Tepelice in the mountains of Barla about the fruit of the pine, 
cedar, juniper, and black cypress trees is this: 

Living creatures have appeared from everywhere on the face of the earth, Your art, to 

gaze on You. 

dance. 

From above and below they emerge like heralds, and call out. 
The  herald-like  trees  take  pleasure  at  the  beauty  of  Your  embroideries,  and  they 

They are filled with joy at the perfection of Your art, and utter most beautiful sounds. 
It is as if the sweetness of their own voices fills them with joy too, and makes them 

perform a delicate melody. 

In response the trees have started dancing and are seeking ecstasy. 
It  is  through  these  works  of  Divine  mercy  that  all  the  living  creatures  receive 

instruction in the glorification and prayer particular to each. 

After  receiving  instruction,  on  high  rocks  the  trees  raise  their  heads  to  the  Divine 

Throne. 

 

235 

Each,  like  Shahbaz  Qalandar,11  stretches  out  a  hundred  hands  to the  Court of  God, 

and assumes an imposing position of worship. 

They make their small tassel-like twigs and branches dance, so both they and those 

that watch them express their fine pleasure and elevated delight. 

They give voice as though touching the most sensitive strings and veins of the veils 

of love: ‘Ah! It is He!’ 

From it a meaning such as this comes to mind: they recall both the weeping caused 

by the pain of the fading of metaphorical loves, and a profoundly sorrowful moaning. 

They make heard the melancholy songs of all lovers parted from their beloveds, like 

Sultan Mahmud. 

They  seem  to  have  a  duty  of  making  the  dead  hear  the  pre-eternal  songs  and 

sorrowful voices, who no longer hear worldly voices and words. 

The  spirit  understands  from  this  that  beings  respond  with  glorification  to  the 

manifestation of the Glorious Maker’s Names; they perform a graceful chant. 

The heart reads the mystery of Divine unity from these trees, each like an embodied 
sign, from the elevated word-order of this miraculousness. That is, there is so wonderful 
an  order,  art,  and  wisdom  in  the  manner  of  their  creation,  that  if  all  the  causes  in 
existence  had  the  power  to  act  and  choose,  and  they  gathered  together,  they  could  not 
imitate them. 

The soul, on seeing them, sees the whole earth as revolving in a clamorous tumult of 
separation,  and  seeks  enduring  pleasure.  It  receives  the  meaning:  ‘You  will  find  it  in 
abandoning worship of this world.’ 

The  mind  discovers  from  the  chanting  animals  and  trees  and  the  vociferous  plants 
and  air,  a  most  meaningful  order  of  creation,  embroidery  of  wisdom,  and  treasury  of 
secrets. 

The  desirous  soul  receives  such  pleasure  from  the  murmuring  air  and  whispering 
leaves  that  it  forgets  all  metaphorical  pleasures,  and  through  abandoning  these,  which 
endow it with life, wants to die in the pleasure of reality. 

The imagination sees that appointed angels have entered these trees like bodies, from 
whose  branches  hang  many  flutes.  It  is  as  though  an  Eternal  Monarch  has  clothed  the 
angels  in  the  trees  for  a  splendid  parade  accompanied  with  the  sounds  of  a  thousand 
flutes. Thus the trees show themselves to be not lifeless, unconscious bodies, but highly 
conscious and meaningful. 

                                                

11 Shahbaz Qalandar was a famous hero who through the guidance of Shaykh Geylani took refuge at 

the Divine Court and rose to the degree of sainthood. 

 

236 

The  flutes  are  pure  and  powerful  as  though  issuing  from  a  heavenly,  exalted 
orchestra.  The  mind  does  not  hear  from  them  the  sorrowful  plaints  of  separation,  that 
foremost  Mawlana  Jalaluddin  Rumi  and  all  lovers  hear,  but  dominical  praise  and 
laudation  and  grateful  thanks  offered  to  the  Most  Merciful  One,  the  Ever-Living,  the 
Self-Subsistent. 

Since  the  trees  have  all  become  bodies,  their  leaves  have  become  tongues.  At  the 
touching  of  the  breeze  each  recites  over  and  over  again:  ‘It  is  He!  It  is  He!’  With  the 
benedictions  of  their  lives  they  proclaim  their  Maker  to  be  Ever-Living  and  Self-
Subsistent. 

With  the  tongue  of  disposition  they  continuously  declare  ‘O  God!’,  and  seek  the 
necessities of their lives from Him, from the treasury of mercy. And through the tongue 
of their manifesting life from top to bottom, they recite His Name of ‘O Living One!’ 

O Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One! Through the Names of Ever-Living and 
Self-Subsistent, endow the heart of this wretched one with life, and bestow sound 
direction on his confused mind. Amen.

 [One time at night in a high spot on Çamdağı (the Pine Mountain) near Barla I 
was  looking  at  the  face  of  the  heavens  when  the  following  lines  suddenly 
occurred to me. With the imagination I heard the speaking of the stars through 
the tongue of disposition, and that is how the lines were written. Since I do not 
know the rules  of  versification, they  were  not written accordingly, but as they 
occurred to me. The piece is taken from the Fourth Letter, and the last part of 
the First Stopping Place of the Thirty-Second Word.] 

THE UTTERANCE OF THE STARS 

Then listen to the stars, listen to their harmonious address! 
See what wisdom has emblazed on the decree of its light! 

Altogether they start to speak with the tongue of truth, 
They address the majesty of the All-Powerful One of Glory’s sovereignty: 

We are each of us light-scattering proofs of the existence of our Maker; 
We are witnesses both to His Unity and His Power; 

We are subtle miracles gilding the face of the skies 
For the angels to make excursions on; 

We are the innumerable attentive eyes of the heavens 
That watch the earth, that study Paradise;12 

                                                

12 That is, since innumerable miracles of power are exhibited on the face of the earth, which is the 

seedbed and tillage for Paradise, the angels in the world of the heavens gaze on those miracles, those 
marvels. And like the angels, the stars, which are like the eyes of the heavenly bodies, gaze on the finely 
fashioned creatures on the earth, and in so doing look at the world of Paradise. At the same time they look 
on both the earth and Paradise; they observe those fleeting wonders in an enduring form in Paradise. That is 
to say, there, there are prospects of both worlds. 

 

238 

We  are  the  innumerable  exquisite  fruits  that  the  hand  of  wisdom  of  the  Beauteous 

One of Glory has fastened 

To the celestial portion of the tree of creation, to all the branches of the Milky Way; 

For the inhabitants of the heavens, we are each of us a travelling mosque, 

a spinning house, a lofty home, 

Each is an illumining lamp, a mighty ship, an aeroplane; 

We are each of us a miracle of power of the All-Powerful One of Perfection, The All-

Each a wonder of His creative art, a rarity of His wisdom, a marvel of 

Wise One of Glory;  

His creation, a world of light; 

innumerable tongues of ours; 

We  demonstrated  to  mankind  innumerable  proofs,  we  made  them  hear  with  these 

But their accursed unseeing, unbelieving eyes did not see our faces, they did not hear 

our words; and we are signs that speak the truth; 

Our stamp is one; our seal is one; we are mastered by our Sustainer; 
We glorify Him through our subjugation; 
We recite His Names; we are each of us in ecstasy, a member of the 
mighty circle of the Milky Way.

The Eighteenth Word 

 [This Word consists of two Stations, of which the Second has 
not yet been written. There are three Points in the First Station.] 

FIRST POINT 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
Think not that those who exult in what they have thus contrived, and who love to 
be  praised  for  what  they  have  not  done  –  think  not  that  they  will  escape 
suffering: for grievous suffering does await them.1 

A Chastening Slap for my Evil-Commanding Soul: 

O  my  foolish  soul,  charmed  at  glory,  enamoured  of  fame,  addicted  to  praise,  and 
without equal in egotism! If it is a just claim that the source of the fig and its thousands of 
fruits is its tiny seed, and that all the grapes in their hundred bunches hanging from a dry 
branch  of  the  vine  are  produced  through  the  skill  of  the  branch,  and  that  those  who 
benefit  from  them  should  praise  and  esteem  the  branch  and  the  seed,  then  perhaps  you 
have the right to be proud and conceited about the bounties with which  you are  loaded. 
But in fact you deserve to be constantly chided, because you are not like the seed and the 
branch: since you have the faculty of will, you reduce the value of those bounties through 
your pride. Through your conceit, you destroy them; through your ingratitude, you nullify 
them; through claiming them as your own, you lay hands on them unlawfully. Your duty 
is  not  to  glory  in  your  deeds,  but  to  offer  thanks.  What  is  fit  for  you  is  not  fame,  but 
humility.  Your  right  is  not  praise,  it  is  repentance  and  to  seek  forgiveness.  Your 
perfection lies not in self-centredness, but in recognizing God.  

Yes,  you  in  my  body  resemble  ‘nature’  in  the  world.  Both  of  you  were  created  to 
receive  good  and  be  the  thing  to  which  evil  is  referred.  That  is  to  say,  you  are  not the 
agent and source, but the recipient and passive. You have only an effect, and that is being 
the cause of evil because you did not accept as you should have done a good arising from 
absolute good. Also you

were  both  created  as  veils,  so  that things  that  are  apparently  ugly,  whose  beauty  is  not 
obvious, would  be attributed to you, and  you would  be  means of the Most Holy Divine 
Essence  being  acknowledged  free  of  defect.  But  you  have  taken  on  a  form  entirely 
contrary  to  the  duty  of  your  natures.  Although  out  of  your  incapacity  you  have 
transformed good into evil, you as though act as partners to your Creator. That means one 
who  worships  himself  and  worships  nature  is  extremely  foolish  and  perpetrates  a  great 
wrong. 

And  do  not  say:  ‘I  am  a  place  of  manifestation,  and  one  who  manifests  beauty 
becomes  beautiful.’  For you  have  not assimilated  it,  so are not a place of  manifestation 
but a place of passage. 

And  do  not  say:  ‘Among  people  I  was  chosen.  These  fruits,  these  fine  works,  are 
shown  through  me.  That  means  I  have  some  merit.’  No!  God  forbid!  Rather  they  were 
given to you first because you are more bankrupt, needy, and sad than everyone else!2 

SECOND POINT 

This Point elucidates one meaning of the verse: 

Who has created everything in the best way,3 

and is as follows: 

In everything, even the things which appear to be the most ugly, there is an aspect of 
true  beauty.  Yes,  everything  in  the  universe,  every  event,  is  either  in  itself  beautiful, 
which is called ‘essential beauty,’ or it is beautiful in regard to its results, which is called 
‘relative  beauty.’  There  are  certain  events  which  are  apparently  ugly  and  confused,  but 
beneath that apparent veil, there are most shining instances of beauty and order. 

Beneath the  veil of stormy rains and  muddy soil  in the season of spring are  hidden 
the smiles of innumerable beautiful flowers and well-ordered plants. And behind the veils 
of  the  harsh  destruction  and  mournful  separations  of  autumn  is  the  discharge  from  the 
duties of their lives of the amiable small animals, the friends of the coy flowers, so as to 
preserve them from the blows and torments of winter events, which are manifestations of 
Divine  might  and  glory,  and  under  the  veil  of  which  the  way  is  paved  for the  new  and 
beautiful spring. 

Beneath the  veil of events  like  storms, earthquakes, and plague,  is the unfolding of 
numerous  hidden  immaterial  flowers.  The  seeds  of  many  potentialities  which  have  not 
developed sprout and grow beautiful on account of events which are apparently ugly. As 
though general upheavals and universal  

2 Truly, I was extremely pleased at the New Said silencing his soul to this extent in this dispute, and 

                                                

said, A thousand bravo’s! 
3 Qur’an, 32:7.

change are all immaterial rain. But because man is both enamoured of the apparent and is 
self-centered, he considers only the externals and pronounces them ugly. Since he is self-
centred,  he  reasons  according  to  the  result  which  looks  to  himself  and  judges  it  to  be 
ugly.  Whereas,  if,  of  their  aims  one  looks  to  man,  thousands  look  to  their  Maker’s 
Names.  

For example,  man reckons to be  harmful and  meaningless thorned plants and trees, 
which are among the great  miracles of the  Creator’s power.  Whereas they are the well-
equipped  heroes of the grasses  and trees. And  for example,  hawks  harrying  sparrows  is 
apparently  incompatible  with  mercy,  but  through  this  harrying,  the  sparrow’s  abilities 
unfold. And for example, he considers the snow to be very cold and uninviting, but under 
that  chilly,  unpleasing  veil  there  are  aims  so  warm  and  results  so  sweet  they  defy 
description.  Also,  since  man  is  self-centred  and  worships  the  apparent  and  therefore 
judges everything according to the face that looks to him, he supposes to contrary to good 
manners  many things that are perfectly  polite and correct. For example,  in  man’s  view, 
the discussion of his sexual organ is shameful. But this veil of shame is in the face which 
looks to man. Whereas the faces that look to creation, art, and its aims and purposes are 
veils which if considered with the eye of wisdom, are perfectly correct. Shame does not 
touch them at all. 

Thus, certain expressions of the All-Wise Qur’an, the source of politeness and right 
conduct,  are  in  accordance  with  these  faces  and  veils.  Beneath  the  apparent  faces  of 
creatures  and  events  which  seem  to  us  to  be  ugly,  are  extremely  fine,  wise  art  and 
beautiful  faces  looking  to  their  creation,  which  look  to  their  Maker;  so  too  there  are 
numerous  beautiful  veils  which  conceal  their  wisdom,  and  moreover,  great  numbers  of 
apparent instances of disorder and confusion which are most regular sacred writing. 

THIRD POINT 

If you do love God, follow me; God will love you.4 

Since  in  the  universe  there  is  observedly  beauty  of  art,  and  this  is  certain,  it 
necessitates  with  a  certainty  as  definite  as  actually  witnessing  it  the  Messengership  of 
Muhammad  (PBUH).  For  the  beauty  of  art  and  finely  ornamented  forms  of  these 
beautiful  creatures  show  that  their  Fashioner  possesses  a  significant  will  to  make 
beautiful  and  powerful  desire  to  adorn.  And  this  will  and  desire  show  that  the  Maker 
possesses  an  elevated  love  and  sacred  inclination  towards  the  perfections  of  the  art  He 
displays in His creatures. And this love and inclination require to be turned towards and 
concentrated  on  man,  the  most  enlightened  and  perfect  individual  among  beings.  And 
man is the conscious fruit of the tree of creation. And the fruit  

                                                

4 Qur’an, 3:31. 

 

242 

is  the  most  comprehensive  and  furthest  part,  the  part  with  the  most  general  view  and 
universal  consciousness.  And  the  one  with  the  most  comprehensive  view  and  universal 
consciousness  should  be  the  most  elevated  and  brilliant  individual,  who  will  meet  with 
and be addressed by that Beauteous Maker; who will expend his universal consciousness 
and comprehensive view entirely on the worship of his Maker, the appreciation of His art, 
and offering thanks for His bounties. 

Now, two signboards, two spheres appear. One is a magnificent, well-ordered sphere 
of  dominicality  and  exquisitely  fashioned,  bejewelled  signboard  of  art.  The  other  is  an 
enlightened and illumined sphere of worship and broad and comprehensive signboard of 
thought and reflection, admiration, thanks, and belief. This second sphere acts with all its 
strength in the name of the first sphere. 

Thus,  it  will  be  clearly  understood  how  closely  connected  with  the  Maker  is  the 
leader of the second  sphere, which serves all the  Maker’s art-cherishing aims, and  how 
beloved and acceptable he is in His eyes. 

Is it at all reasonable to accept that the munificent Fashioner of these fine creatures, 
Who so loves His art and even takes into consideration all the tastes of the mouth, would 
remain indifferent towards His most beautiful creature, who, in a clamour of admiration 
and appreciation which makes the Throne and earth reverberate and in a litany of thanks 
and  exaltation  which  brings  to  ecstasy  the  land  and  the  sea,  is  worshipfully  turned 
towards Him? Would He not speak with him and want to make him His Messenger and 
wish his commendable conduct to pass to others? It is possible that He would not speak 
with him and not make him His Messenger... By no means! 

Verily, the religion before God is Islam.55 
Muhammad is the Messenger of God.6

The Nineteenth Word 

[About the Messengership of Muhammad (PBUH)] 

I  could  not  praise  Muhammad  with  my  words;  rather,  my  words  were  made 
praiseworthy by Muhammad. 

Yes, this Word is beautiful, but what makes it so is the most beautiful of all things, 

the attributes and qualities of Muhammad (PBUH). 

Also being the Fourteenth Flash, this Word consists of fourteen ‘Droplets.’ 

FIRST DROPLET 

There  are  three  great  and  universal  things  which  make  known  to  us  our  Sustainer. 
One is the book of the universe, a jot of whose testimony we have heard from the thirteen 
Flashes together with the thirteenth  lesson  from the  Arabic  Risale-i Nur. Another  is the 
Seal of the Prophets (Peace and blessings be upon him), the supreme sign of the book of 
the  universe.  The  other  is  the  Qur’an  of  Mighty  Stature.  Now  we  must  become 
acquainted with the Seal of the Prophets (PBUH), who is the second and articulate proof, 
and must listen to him. 

Yes,  consider  the  collective  personality  of  this  proof:  the  face  of  the  earth  has 
become his mosque, Mecca, his mihrab, and Medina, his pulpit. Our Prophet (Peace and 
blessings  be  upon  him),  this  clear  proof,  is  leader  of  all  the  believers,  preacher  to  all 
mankind, the chief of all the prophets, lord of all the saints, the leader of a circle for the 
remembrance of God comprising all the prophets and saints. He is a luminous tree whose 
living roots are all the prophets, and  fresh  fruits  are all the  saints; whose claims all the 
prophets  relying  on  their  miracles  and  all  the  saints  relying  on  their  wonder-working 
confirm and corroborate. For he declares and claims: “There is no god but God!” And all 
on left and right, that is, those luminous reciters of God’s Names lined up in the past and 
the  future,  repeat  the  same  words,  and  through  their  consensus  in  effect  declare:  “You 
speak the truth and what you say is right!” What false idea has the power to meddle in a 
claim which is thus affirmed and corroborated by thousands? 

 

244 

SECOND DROPLET 

Just  as  that  luminous  proof  of  Divine  unity  is  affirmed  by  the  unanimity  and 
consensus  of  those two  wings,  so  do  hundreds  of  indications  in  the  revealed  scriptures, 
like the Torah and Bible,1 and the thousands of signs that appeared before the beginning 
of  his  mission,  and  the  well-known  news  given  by  the  voices  from  the  Unseen  and  the 
unanimous testimony of the soothsayers, the indications of the thousands of his miracles 
like the Splitting of the Moon, and the justice of Shari’a all confirm and corroborate him. 
So too, in his person, his laudable morals, which were at the summit of perfection; and in 
his  duties,  his  complete  confidence  and  elevated  qualities,  which  were  of  the  highest 
excellence, and his extraordinary fear of God, worship, seriousness, and fortitude, which 
demonstrated  the  strength  of  his  belief,  and  his  total  certainty  and  his  complete 
steadfastness,  –  these  all  show  as  clearly  as  the  sun  how  utterly  faithful  he  was  to  his 
cause. 

THIRD DROPLET 

If  you  wish,  come!  Let  us  go  to  Arabian  Peninsula,  to  the  Era  of  Bliss!  In  our 
imaginations  we  shall  see  him  at  his  duties  and  visit  him.  Look!  We  see  a  person 
distinguished by his fine character and beautiful form. In his hand is a miraculous book 
and on his tongue, a truthful address; he is delivering a pre-eternal sermon to all mankind, 
indeed,  to  man,  jinn,  and  the  angels,  and  to  all  beings.  He  solves  and  expounds  the 
strange riddle of the mystery of the world’s creation; he discovers and solves the abstruse 
talisman which is the mystery of the universe; and he provides convincing and satisfying 
answers to the three awesome and difficult questions that are asked of all beings and have 
always bewildered and occupied minds: “Where do you come from? What are you doing 
here? What is your destination?” 

FOURTH DROPLET 

See! He spreads such a Light of truth that if you look at the universe as being outside 
the  luminous  sphere  of  his  truth  and  guidance,  you  see  it  to  be  like  a  place  of  general 
mourning,  and  beings  strangers  to  one  another  and  hostile,  and  inanimate  beings  to  be 
like ghastly corpses and living creatures like orphans weeping at the blows of death and 
separation.  Now  look!  Through  the  Light  he  spreads,  that  place  of  universal  mourning 
has been transformed into a place where God’s Names and praises are recited in joy and 
ecstasy. The foreign, hostile beings have become  friends and brothers. While the dumb, 
dead inanimate creatures have all become familiar officials and docile servants. And the 
weeping, complaining orphans are seen to be  

                                                

1 In his Risale-i Hamidiye, Husayn Jisri extracted one hundred and fourteen indications from those 

scriptures. If this many have remained after the texts have become corrupted, there were surely many 
explicit mentions before. 

 

245 

either  reciting  God’s  Names  and  praises  or offering  thanks  at  being  released  from  their 
duties. 

FIFTH DROPLET 

Also, through his Light, the motion and movement of the universe, and its variations, 
changes  and  transformations  cease  being  meaningless,  futile,  and  the  playthings  of 
chance; they rise to being dominical missives, pages inscribed with the signs of creation, 
mirrors  to  the  Divine  Names,  and  the  world  itself  becomes  a  book  of  the  Eternally 
Besought One’s wisdom. Man’s boundless weakness and impotence make him inferior to 
all  other  animals  and  his  intelligence,  an  instrument  for  conveying  grief,  sorrow,  and 
sadness,  makes  him  more  wretched,  yet  when  he  is  illumined  with  that  Light,  he  rises 
above all animals and all creatures. Through entreaty, his illuminated impotence, poverty, 
and intelligence make him a petted monarch; due to his complaints, he becomes a spoiled 
vicegerent of the earth. That is to say, if it were not for his Light, the universe and man, 
and  all  things,  would  be  nothing.  Yes,  certainly  such  a  person  is  necessary  in  such  a 
wondrous universe; otherwise the universe and firmaments would not be in existence. 

SIXTH DROPLET 

Thus, that Being brings and announces the good news of eternal happiness; he is the 
discoverer and proclaimer of an infinite mercy, the herald and observer of the beauties of 
the  sovereignty  of  dominicality,  and  the  discloser  and  displayer  of  the  treasures  of  the 
Divine Names. If you regard him in that way, that is in regard to his being a worshipful 
servant  of  God,  you  will  see  him  to  be  the  model  of  love,  the  exemplar  of  mercy,  the 
glory of mankind, and the most luminous fruit of the tree of creation. While if you look in 
this way, that is, in regard to his Messengership, you see him to be the proof of God, the 
lamp of truth, the sun of guidance, and the means to happiness. And look! His Light has 
lighted  up  from  east  to  west  like  dazzling  lightning,  and  half  the  earth  and  a  fifth  of 
mankind has accepted the gift of his guidance and preserved it like life itself. So how is it 
that our evil-commanding souls and satans do not accept with all its degrees, the basis of 
all such a Being claimed, that is, There is no god but God? 

SEVENTH DROPLET 

Now, consider how, eradicating in no time at all their evil, savage customs and habits 
to  which  they  were  fanatically  attached,  he  decked  out  the  various  wild,  unyielding 
peoples of that broad peninsula with all the finest virtues, and made them teachers of all 
the world and masters to the civilized nations. See, it was not an outward domination, he 
conquered and subjugated their minds, spirits, hearts, and souls. He became the beloved 
of hearts, the teacher of minds, the trainer of souls, the ruler of spirits. 

 

246 

EIGHTH DROPLET 

You  know  that  a  small  habit  like  cigarette  smoking  among  a  small  nation  can  be 
removed  permanently  only  by  a  powerful  ruler  with  great  effort.  But  look!  This  Being 
removed  numerous  ingrained  habits  from  intractable,  fanatical  large  nations  with  slight 
outward  power  and  little  effort  in  a  short  period  of  time,  and  in  their  place  he  so 
established  exalted  qualities  that they  became  as  firm  as  if  they  had  mingled  with  their 
very  blood.  He  achieved  very  many  extraordinary  feats  like  this.  Thus,  we  present  the 
Arabian Peninsula as a challenge to those who refuse to see the testimony of the blessed 
age of the Prophet. Let them each take a hundred philosophers, go there, and strive for a 
hundred  years;  would  they  be  able  to  carry  out  in  that  time  one  hundredth  of  what  he 
achieved in a year? 

NINTH DROPLET 

Also,  you  know  that  an  insignificant  man  of  small  standing  among  a  small 
community in a disputed matter of small importance cannot tell a small but shameful lie 
brazen-faced  and  without  fear  without  displaying  anxiety  or  disquiet  enough  to  inform 
the enemies at his side of his deception. Now look at that Being; although he undertook a 
tremendous  task  which  required  an  official  of  great  authority  and  great  standing  and  a 
situation of great security, can any contradiction at all  be  found  in the words he uttered 
among a community of great size  in the  face of great hostility concerning a great cause 
and  matters of great significance, with great ease and  freedom, without fear, hesitation, 
diffidence, or anxiety, with pure sincerity, great seriousness, and  in  an  intense, elevated 
manner that angered his enemies? Is it at all possible that any trickery should have been 
involved? God forbid! It is naught but Revelation inspired.2 The truth does not deceive, 
and  one  who  perceives  the  truth  is  not  deceived.  His  way,  which  is  truth,  is  free  of 
deception.  How  could  a  fancy  appear  to  one  who  sees  the  truth  to  be  the  truth,  and 
deceive him? 

TENTH DROPLET 

shows, what matters he proves! 

Now,  look!  What  curiosity-arousing,  attractive,  necessary,  and  awesome  truths  he 

You know that what impels man most is curiosity. Even, if it was to be said to you: 
“If you give half of your life and property, someone will come from the Moon and Jupiter 
and tell you all about them. He will also tell you the truth about your future and what will 
happen  to  you,”  you  would  be  bound  to  give  them  if  you  have  any  curiosity  at  all. 
Whereas  that  Being  tells  of  a  Monarch  Who  is  such  that  in  His  realm,  the  Moon  flies 
round a moth like a fly, and the moth, the earth, flutters round a lamp, and the lamp, the 
sun,  is  merely  one  lamp  among  thousands  in  one  guest-house  out  of  thousands  of  that 
Monarch.  

                                                

2 Qur’an, 53:4. 

 

247 

Also, he speaks truly of a world so wondrous and a revolution so momentous that if 
the earth was a bomb and exploded, it would not be all that strange. Look! Listen to Suras 
like, When the sun is folded up;3 * When the sky is cleft asunder;4 * [The Day] of Noise 
and Clamour;5 which he recites. 

Also,  he  speaks  truly  about  a  future  in  comparison  with  which  the  future  in  this 
world is like a tiny mirage. And he tells most seriously of a happiness in comparison with 
which  all  worldly  happiness  is  but  a  fleeting  flash  of  lightning  in  relation  to  an  eternal 
sun. 

ELEVENTH DROPLET 

For  sure,  wonders  await  us  under  the  apparent  veil  of  the  universe  which  is  thus 
strange and perplexing. So one thus wonderful and extraordinary, a displayer of marvels, 
is  necessary  to tell  of  its  wonders.  It  is  apparent  from  that  Being’s  conduct  that  he  has 
seen  them,  and  sees  them,  and  says  that  he  has  seen  them.  And  he  instructs  us  most 
soundly concerning what the God of the heavens and the earth, Who nurtures us with His 
bounties, wants and desires of us. Everyone should therefore leave everything and run to 
and heed this Being who teaches numerous other necessary and curiosity-arousing truths 
like these, so how is it that most people are deaf and blind, and mad even, so that they do 
not see this truth, and they do not listen to it and understand it? 

TWELFTH DROPLET 

Thus, just as this Being is an articulate proof and true evidence at the degree of the 
veracity of the unity of the Creator of beings, so is he a decisive proof and clear evidence 
for  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  and  eternal  happiness.  Yes,  with  his  guidance  he  is  the 
reason for eternal happiness coming about and is the means of attaining it; so too through 
his prayers and supplications, he is the cause of its existence and reason for its creation. 
We repeat here this mystery, which is mentioned in the Tenth Word, due to its ‘station’. 

See! This Being prays with a prayer so supreme it is as if the Arabian Peninsula and 
the  earth  itself  performs  the  prayers  through  his  sublime  prayer,  and  offers  entreaties. 
See,  he  also  entreats  in  a  congregation  so  vast  that  it  is  as  if  all  the  luminous  and 
perfected  members of  mankind  from the time of  Adam till our age and until the end of 
time,  are  following  him  and  saying  “Amen”  to  his  supplications.  And  see!  He  is 
beseeching for a need so universal that not only the dwellers of the earth, but also those 
of the heavens, and all beings, join in his prayer, declaring: “Yes! O our Sustainer!  

                                                

3 Qur’an, 81:1. 
4 Qur’an, 82:1. 
5 Qur’an, 101:1. 

 

248 

Grant  it to  us!  We  too  want  it!”  And  he  supplicates  with  such  want,  so  sorrowfully,  in 
such a loving, yearning, and beseeching fashion that he brings the whole cosmos to tears, 
leading them to join in his prayer. 

And see! The purpose and aim of his prayer is such it raises man and the world, and 
all creatures, from the lowest of the low, from inferiority, worthlessness, and uselessness 
to the highest of the  high; that  is to having  value, permanence, and exalted duties.  And 
see! He seeks and pleads for help and mercy in a manner so elevated and sweet, it is as if 
he makes all beings and the heavens and the earth hear, and bringing them to ecstasy, to 
exclaim:  “Amen,  O  our  God!  Amen!”  And  see!  He  seeks  his  needs  from  One  so 
Powerful,  Hearing,  and  Munificent,  One  so  Knowing,  Seeing,  and  Compassionate,  that 
He sees and hears the most secret need of the most hidden living being and its entreaties, 
accepts  them,  and  has  mercy  on  it.  For  He  gives  what  is  asked  for,  if  only  through  the 
tongue of disposition. And He gives it in so Wise, Seeing, and Compassionate a form that 
it  leaves  no doubt that that nurturing and regulation  is particular to the All-Hearing and 
All-Seeing One, the Most Generous and Most Compassionate One. 

THIRTEENTH DROPLET 

What  does  he  want,  this  pride  of  the  human  race,  who  taking  behind  him  all  the 
eminent  of  mankind,  stands  on  top  of  the  world,  and  raising  up  his  hand,  is  praying? 
What  is this unique  being, who  is truly the glory of the cosmos, seeking?  Listen! He  is 
seeking eternal happiness. He is asking for eternal life, and to meet with God. He wants 
Paradise.  And  he  wants  all  the  Sacred  Divine  Names,  which  display  their  beauty  and 
decrees  in  the  mirrors  of  beings.  Even,  if  it  were  not  for  reasons  for  the  fulfilment  of 
those countless requests, like mercy, grace, wisdom, and justice, a single of that Being’s 
prayers would have been sufficient for the construction of Paradise, the creation of which 
is as easy for Divine power as the creation of the spring. Yes, just as his Messengership 
was the reason for the opening of this place of examination and trial, so too his worship 
and servitude to God were the reason for the opening of the next world. 

Would the perfect order observed in the universe, which has caused scholars and the 
intelligent  to  pronounce:  “It  is  not  possible  for  there  to  be  anything  better  than  what 
exists;”  and  the  faultless  beauty  of  art  within  mercy,  the  incomparable  beauty  of 
dominicality,  –  would  these  permit  the  ugliness,  the  cruelty,  the  lack  of  order  of  its 
hearing and responding to the least significant, the least important desires and voices, and 
its  considering  unimportant  the  most  important,  the  most  necessary  wishes,  and  its  not 
hearing them or understanding them, and not carrying them out? God forbid! A hundred 
thousand times, God forbid! Such a beauty would not permit such an ugliness; it would 
not become ugly. 

 

249 

And  so,  my  imaginary  friend!  That  is  enough  for  now,  we  must  return.  For  if  we 
remain  a  hundred  years  in  this  age  in  the  Arabian  Peninsula,  we  still  would  only 
completely  comprehend  one  hundredth  of  the  marvels  of  that  Being’s  duties  and  the 
wonders he carried out, and we would never tire of watching him. 

Now, come! We shall look at the centuries, which will turn above us. See how each 
has  opened  like  a  flower  through  the  effulgence  it  has  received  from  that  Sun  of 
Guidance!  They  have  produced  millions  of  enlightened  fruits  like  Abu  Hanifa,  Shafi’i, 
Abu  Bayazid  Bistami,  Shah  Geylani,  Shah  Naqshband,  Imam  Ghazzali,  and  Imam 
Rabbani. But postponing the details of our observations to another time, we  must recite 
some benedictions for that displayer of miracles and bringer of guidance, which mention 
a number of his certain miracles: 

Endless peace and blessings be upon our master  Muhammad, to the number of the 
good deeds of his community, to whom was revealed the All-Wise Criterion of Truth 
and  Falsehood,  from  One  Most  Merciful,  Most  Compassionate,  from  the  Sublime 
Throne;  whose Messengership  was foretold by the Torah and Bible, and told of by 
wondrous  signs,  the  voices  of  jinn,  saints  of  man,  and  soothsayers;  at  whose 
indication the moon split; our master Muhammad! Peace and blessings be upon him 
thousands and thousands of times, to the number of the breaths of his community; at 
whose  beckoning  came  the  tree,  on  whose  prayer  rain  swiftly  fell;  and  whom  the 
cloud  shaded  from  the  heat;  who  satisfied  a  hundred  men  with  his  food;  from 
between  whose fingers three times flowed  water like the Spring of Kawthar; and to 
whom God made speak the lizard, the gazelle, the wolf, the torso, the arm, the camel, 
the mountain, the rock, and the clod; the one who made the Ascension and whose eye 
did  not  waver;  our  master  and  intercessor,  Muhammad!  Peace  and  blessings  be 
upon  him  thousands  and  thousands  of  times,  to  the  number  of  the  letters  of  the 
Qur’an formed in the words, represented with the permission of the Most Merciful in 
the mirrors of the airwaves, at the reciting of all the Qur’an’s words by all reciters 
from when it was first revealed to the end of time. And grant us forgiveness and have 
mercy on us, O God, for each of those blessings. Amen. 

[I  have  described the  evidences  for Muhammad’s (PBUH) Prophethood  which  I  have  here 
indicated briefly in a Turkish treatise called Şua’at-ı Marifeti’n-Nebi and in the Nineteenth Letter 
(The  Miracles  of  Muhammad).  And  there  too  aspects  of  the  All-Wise  Qur’an’s  miraculousness 
have  been  mentioned  briefly.  Again,  in  a  Turkish  treatise  called  Lemeat  (Gleams)  and  in  the 
Twenty-Fifth Word (The Miraculousness of the Qur’an) I have explained concisely forty ways in 
which the Qur’an is a miracle, and indicated forty aspects of its miraculousness. And of those  

 

250 

forty  aspects,  only  the  eloquence  in  the  word-order,  I  have  written  in  forty  pages  in  an  Arabic 
commentary  called  Isharat  al-I’jaz  (Signs  of  Miraculousness).  If  you  have  the  need,  you  may 
refer to those three works.] 

FOURTEENTH DROPLET 

The  All-Wise  Qur’an,  the  treasury  of  miracles  and  supreme  miracle,  proves  the 
Prophethood  of  Muhammad  (PBUH)  together  with  Divine  unity  so  decisively  that  it 
leaves no need for further proof. And we shall give its definition and indicate one or two 
flashes of its miraculousness which have been the cause of criticism. 

The All-Wise Qur’an, which makes known to us our Sustainer, is thus: it is the pre-
eternal  translator of  the  great  book of  the  universe;  the  discloser  of  the  treasures  of  the 
Divine Names concealed in the pages of the earth and the heavens; the key to the truths 
hidden beneath these lines of events; the treasury of the favours of the Most Merciful and 
pre-eternal addresses, which come forth from the World of the Unseen beyond the veil of 
this Manifest World; the sun, foundation, and plan of the spiritual world of Islam, and the 
map  of  the  worlds  of  the  hereafter;  the  distinct  expounder,  lucid  exposition,  articulate 
proof, and clear translator of the Divine Essence, attributes, and deeds; the instructor, true 
wisdom, guide, and leader of the world of humanity; it is both a book of wisdom and law, 
and a book of prayer and worship, and a book of command and summons, and a book of 
invocation  and  Divine  knowledge  –  it  is  book  for  all  spiritual  needs;  and  it  is  a  sacred 
library offering books appropriate to the ways of all the saints and veracious, the purified 
and the scholars, whose ways and paths are all different. 

Consider the flashes of miraculousness in its repetitions, which are imagined to be a 
fault: since the Qur’an is both a book of invocation, and a book of prayer, and a book of 
summons, the repetition  in  it  is desirable,  indeed,  it is essential and  most eloquent. It is 
not as the  faulty  imagine. For the  mark of  invocation  is  illumination through repetition. 
The  mark  of  prayer  is  strengthening  through  repetition.  The  mark  of  command  and 
summons  is  confirmation  through  repetition.  Moreover,  everyone  is  not  capable  of 
always reading the whole Qur’an,  but  is  mostly  able to read one Sura. Therefore, since 
the most important purposes of the Qur’an are included in most of the longer Suras, each 
is  like  a  small  Qur’an.  That  is  to  say,  so  that  no  one  should  be  deprived,  certain  of  its 
aims  like  Divine  unity,  the  resurrection  of  the  dead,  and  the  story  of  Moses,  have  been 
repeated.  Also,  like  bodily  needs,  spiritual  needs  are  various.  Man  is  need  of  some  of 
them every breath; like the body needs air, the spirit needs the word Hu (He). Some he is 
in need of every hour, like “In the Name of God.” And so on. That means the repetition 
of verses arises from the repetition of need. It makes the  

 

251 

repetition in order to point out the need and awaken and excite it, and to arouse desire and 
appetite. 

Also, the Qur’an is a founder; it is the basis of the Clear Religion, and the foundation 
of  the  world  of  Islam.  It  changed  human  social  life,  and  is  the  answer  to  the  repeated 
questions of its various classes. Repetition is necessary for a founder in order to establish 
things.  Repetition  is  necessary  to  corroborate  them.  Confirmation,  verification  and 
repetition are necessary to emphasize them. 

Also,  it  speaks  of  such  mighty  matters  and  minute  truths  that  numerous  repetitions 
are  necessary  in  different  forms  in  order  to  establish  them  in  everyone’s  hearts. 
Nevertheless,  they  are  apparently  repetitions,  but  in  reality  every  verse  has  numerous 
meanings,  numerous  benefits,  and  many  aspects  and  levels.  In  each  place  they  are 
mentioned with a different meaning, for different benefits and purposes. 

Also, the Qur’an’s being unspecific and concise in certain matters to do with cosmos 
is  a  flash  of  miraculousness  for  the  purpose  of  guidance.  It  cannot  be  the  target  of 
criticism and is not a fault, like some atheists imagine. 

 If you ask: “Why does the All-Wise Qur’an not speak of beings in the same way as 
philosophy and science? It leaves some matters in brief form, and some it speaks of in a 
simple  and  superficial  way  that  is  easy  in  the  general  view,  does  not  wound  general 
feelings, and does not weary or tax the minds of ordinary people. Why is this?” 

By way of an answer we  say: Philosophy  has strayed  from the path of truth, that’s 
why. Also, of course you have understood from past Words and what they teach that the 
All-Wise  Qur’an  speaks  of  the  universe  in  order  to  make  known  the  Divine  Essence, 
attributes,  and  Names.  That  is,  it  explains  the  meanings  of  the  book  of  the  universe  to 
make known its Creator. That means it looks at beings, not for themselves, but for their 
Creator.  Also,  it  addresses  everyone.  But  philosophy  and  science  look  at  beings  for 
themselves, and address scientists in particular. In which case, since the All-Wise Qur’an 
makes  beings evidences and proofs, the evidence has to be superficial  so that it will  be 
quickly understood in the general view. And since the Qur’an of Guidance addresses all 
classes of men, the ordinary people, which form the most numerous class, want guidance 
which  is  concise  with  unnecessary  things  being  vague,  and  which  brings  subtle  things 
close with comparisons, and which does not change things which in their superficial view 
are  obvious  into  an  unnecessary  or  even  harmful  form,  lest  it  causes  them  to  fall  into 
error. 

For example, it says about the sun: “The sun is a revolving lamp or lantern.” For it 
does not speak of the sun for itself and its nature, but because it is a sort of mainspring of 
an order and centre of a system, and order and system are mirrors of the Maker’s skill. It 
says: 

 

252 

The sun runs its course.6 

that is, the sun revolves. Through calling to mind the orderly disposals of Divine power 
in  the  revolutions  of  winter  and  summer,  and  day  and  night  with  the  phrase,  The  sun 
revolves, it makes understood the Maker’s tremendousness. Thus, whatever the reality of 
this revolving, it does not affect the order, which is woven and observed, and which is the 
purpose. It also says, 

And set the sun as a lamp.7 

Through depicting through the word lamp the world in the form of a palace, and the 
things  within  it  as  decorations,  necessities,  and  provisions  prepared  for  man  and  living 
beings, and inferring that the sun is also a subjugated candleholder, it makes known the 
mercy  and  bestowal  of  the  Creator.  Now  look  and  see  what  this  foolish  and  prattling 
philosophy says: 

“The sun is a vast burning liquid mass. It causes the planets which have been flung 
off from it to revolve around it. Its mass is such-and-such. It is this, it is that.” It does not 
afford the spirit the satisfaction and fulfilment of true knowledge, just a terrible dread and 
fearful wonder. It does not speak of it as the Qur’an does. You may understand from this 
the value of the matters of philosophy, whose inside is hollow and outside, ostentatious. 
So  do  not  be  deceived  by  its  glittering  exterior  and  be  disrespectful  towards  the  most 
miraculous expositions of the Qur’an! 

O God! Make the Qur’an healing for us, the writer of this and his peers, from all ills, 
and a  companion to us and to them  in our lives and after our deaths, and  in this world, 
and in the grave, and at the Last Judgement an intercessor, and on the Bridge a light, and 
from the Fire a screen and shield, and in Paradise a friend, and in all good deeds a guide 
and  leader,  through  Your  grace  and  munificence  and  beneficence  and  mercy,  O  Most 
Munificent of the Munificent and Most Merciful of the Merciful! Amen. 

O  God!  Grant  blessings  and  peace  to  the  one  to  whom  the  All-Wise  Qur’an,  the 
Distinguisher  between  Truth  and  Falsehood,  was  re-vealed,  and  to  all  his  Family  and 
Companions. Amen. Amen. 

 [NOTE: The Six Drops of the Fourteenth Droplet in the Arabic Risale-i Nur, and especially 
the Six Points of the Fourth Drop, explain fifteen of the approximately forty sorts of the All-Wise 
Qur’an’s miraculousness. Deeming those to be sufficient, we have limited the discussion here. If 
you wish, refer to them, and you will find a treasury of miracles...]

The Twentieth Word 

[This Word consists of Two Stations] 

First Station 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
And  when  We  told  the  angels:  Prostrate  before  Adam,  they  prostrated,  except 
Iblis.1 * God commands that you sacrifice a cow.2 * And yet after all this your 
hearts hardened and became like rocks or even harder.3 

One  day  while  reading  these  verses,  three  points  were  imparted  to  me  from  the 
effulgence of the Qur’an against the promptings of Satan. His suggestions took this form: 
He  said:  “You  say  the  Qur’an  is  a  miracle,  and  of  infinite  eloquence,  and  that  it  is 
guidance for everyone at all times. So what is the meaning in its persistently repeating in 
historical form certain minor events like the following: how is it appropriate to mention 
an  insignificant  event  like  the  slaughtering  of  a  cow  as  though  it  were  something 
significant,  and  even  naming  that  important  Sura,  The  Cow?  Also  the  event  of 
‘prostrating  before  Adam;’  it  occurred  in  the  realm  of  the  Unseen  and  cannot  be 
understood  rationally.  It  may  be  submitted  to  and  accepted  with  certainty  only  after  a 
strong belief has been attained. Whereas the Qur’an instructs those who use their reasons; 
in many places it says: So will you not think?, and refers what it says to the reason. Also, 
how is it guidance to show certain natural conditions of rocks to be important which are 
the results of chance?” 

The Points with which I was inspired took this form: 
FIRST POINT:  In the All-Wise Qur’an are numerous minor events behind which 
are concealed universal principles, and which are shown as the tips of general laws. For 
example, 

He taught Adam the Names, all of them.4 

                                                

1 Qur’an, 2:34. 
2 Qur’an, 2:67. 
3 Qur’an, 2:74. 
4 Qur’an, 2:31. 

 

254 

This  is  the  ‘teaching  of  the  Names,’  which  was  a  miracle  of  Adam  before  the  angels 
because of his ability to be vicegerent of the earth, and was a minor event. But it forms 
the  tip  of  a  universal  principle  which  is  as  follows:  it  was  the  teaching,  due  to  man’s 
comprehensive disposition, of countless  sciences, and  numerous all-embracing  branches 
of  knowledge  about  the  universe,  and  extensive  learning  about  the  Creator’s  attributes 
and  qualities,  which  afforded  man  superiority  over  not  only  the  angels  but  also  the 
heavens  and  earth  and  mountains  in  the  question  of  the  bearing  of  the  Supreme  Trust. 
And like the Qur’an states that through his comprehensive disposition, man is a spiritual 
vicegerent of the earth, so the minor event in the Unseen of the angels prostrating before 
Adam  and  Satan  not  prostrating  is  the  tip  of  a  broad  and  universal  observed  principle; 
these hint at an extensive truth which is as follows:  

By  mentioning  the  angels’  obedience  and  submission  before  the  person  of  Adam, 
and  Satan’s  pride  and  refusal,  the  Qur’an  makes  understood  that  most  of  the  physical 
beings  in  the  universe  and  their  non-physical  representatives  and  appointed  beings  are 
subjugated  to  man,  and  that  man’s  senses  are  predisposed  and  amenable  to  benefiting 
from  all  of  them.  And  pointing  out  what  a  fearsome  enemy  and  serious  obstacle  in  the 
path of man’s progress are evil matter and its representatives and evil indwelling spirits, 
which corrupt man’s nature and drive him down wrong paths, the Qur’an of Miraculous 
Exposition, while speaking of a minor matter with Adam (Peace be upon him), converses 
in elevated fashion with the whole universe and all mankind. 

SECOND  POINT:  Although  the  Land  of  Egypt  is  a  part  of  the  Greater  Sahara 
Desert,  through  the  blessing  of  the  Nile,  it  has  become  like  an  extremely  fertile  arable 
field. Such a blessed heavenly place being found adjacent to the hellish Sahara has made 
its agriculture highly sought after by its people and has so fixed it in their characters that 
for them it has become sacred, and the cow and the bull, the means of agriculture, have 
also  become  sacred,  and  even  objects  of  worship.  The  people  of  Egypt  of  that  time 
considered the cow and bull to be so holy they worshipped them. Thus, it is understood 
from the question of  ‘the  Calf’ that the Children  of Israel of that time, who grew up  in 
Egypt, had come to have a share of that custom. 

Thus,  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  makes  understood  through  the  sacrifice  of  a  cow  that 
through  his  messengership,  Moses  excised  and  destroyed  the  concept  of  cow-worship, 
which had become a part of that nation’s character and worked in their very natures. 

Thus,  through  this  minor  incident,  it  expounds  with  an  elevated  miraculousness  a 

universal principle which is essential instruction in wisdom for everyone at all times. 

Making an analogy with this, you may understand that certain minor  

 

255 

incidents in the Qur’an which are mentioned in the form of historical events, are the tips 
of  universal  principles.  Even,  in  Lemeat,  in  the  section  on  the  Miraculousness  of  the 
Qur’an,  taking  the  seven  sentences  of  the  Story  of  Moses,  which  is  mentioned  and 
repeated in  many Suras, we  have explained  how each part of those particular  sentences 
comprises an important universal principle. If you wish, you may refer to that treatise. 

THIRD POINT: 

And  yet,  after  all  this  your  hearts  hardened  and  became  like  rocks,  or  even 
harder: for, behold, there are rocks from which streams gush forth; and, behold, 
there  are  some  from  which,  when  they  are  cleft,  water  issues;  and  there  are 
some that fall down for awe of God. And God is not unmindful of what you do.5 

While  reading  the  above  verse,  the  Whisperer  said:  “What  meaning  is  there  in 
discussing  and  explaining  as  though  they  were  the  most  important  and  significant  of 
matters,  certain  natural  states  of  rocks  which  are  commonplace  and  everyone  knows 
about? How is it fitting, and what need is there?” 

 In  the  face  of  this  suggestion,  the  following  point  was  imparted  to  me  from  the 

effulgence of the Qur’an: 

Yes, it is fitting and there is need for it. And it is so fitting and there is a meaning so 
significant  and  truth  so  enormous  and  necessary  that  only  through  the  Qur’an’s 
miraculous  conciseness  and  guiding  grace  has  it  been  simplified  to  a  degree,  and 
summarized.  Yes,  conciseness,  one  foundation  of  the  Qur’an’s  miraculousness,  and 
guiding grace and  fitting  instruction, which are one  light of  its guidance, require that in 
the face of ordinary people, who form the majority of those whom the Qur’an addresses, 
universal truths and profound and general principles are shown in familiar and particular 
forms, and that, due to their simple minds, only the tips of vast truths are shown, and in a 
simple  form,  and,  moreover,  that  the  Divine  disposals,  which  are  wondrous  and 
extraordinary  beneath  the  veil  of  the  commonplace  and  under  the  earth,  are  shown 
briefly. Thus, it is due to this mystery that the All-Wise Qur’an says the following with 
the above verse: 

O Children of Israel and Sons of Adam! What has happened to you that your hearts 
have become harder and more lifeless than stone? For do you not see that those extremely 
hard,  lifeless,  huge  rocks  formed  in  vast  strata  under  the  earth  are  so  obedient  and 
subjugated  before  the  Divine  commands  and  so  soft  and  tractable  under  the  dominical 
works  that  to  whatever  degree  the  Divine  disposals  occur  without  resistance  in  the 
formation  of  trees  in  the  air,  orderly  water  channels  and  veins,  like  the  circulation  of 
blood  in  veins,  occur  with  the  same  ease  and  order  and  with  perfect  wisdom  in  those 
hard,  

                                                

5 Qur’an, 2:74. 

 

256 

deaf rocks under the earth.6 And like the way the branches of trees and plants spread in 
the  air  with  ease  encountering  no  obstacles,  the  delicate  veins  of  roots  spread  with  the 
same ease in the rocks under the earth. The Qur’an indicates this and teaches an extensive 
truth with the verse, and thus by allusion says the following to the hard-hearted: 

O Children of Israel and Sons of Adam! What sort of heart do you bear within your 
weakness and impotence so that with its hardness it resists the command of such a One? 
Whereas  how  perfectly  and  obediently  the  huge  strata  of  hard  rocks  carry  out  their 
delicate  duties  in  the  darkness  before  His  commands.  They  display  no  disobedience. 
Indeed, those rocks act as treasurers for the water of life and other means of life of all the 
living  creatures  above  the  earth,  and  are  the  means  for  their  division  and  distribution. 
They do this with such wisdom and justice that they are soft like wax or air in the hand of 
power  of  the  All-Wise  One  of  Glory;  offering  no  resistance,  they  prostrate  before  His 
mighty  power.  For  just  like  well-ordered  creatures  and  wise  and  gracious  Divine 
disposals occur on top of the earth, which we observe, the same occur beneath it. Indeed, 
Divine  wisdom  and  favour  are  manifest  there  in  a  more  wondrous  and  strange  way  in 
regard to wisdom and order. See how like wax those hard, unfeeling mighty rocks display 
a softness towards the creational commands, and how they offer no resistance or hardness 
to  the  delicate  waters,  the  fine  roots,  and  silken  veins,  which  are  Divine  officials.  As 
though like a lover, the rock’s heart melts at the touch of those delicate, beautiful things, 
and becomes earth in their path. 

And, through, 

And, behold, there are some that fall down for awe of God, 

the  Qur’an  shows  the  tip  of  a  vast  truth  which  is  like  this:  like  in  the  event  of  ‘Moses 
asking  for  the  vision  of  God’  and  the  famous  mountain  crumbling  at  the  Divine 
manifestation and the rocks being scattered, through the manifestations of Divine glory in 
the  form  of  earthquakes  and  the  mountains  shaking,  most  of  which  are  like  great 
monoliths formed of solidified liquid, and certain other geological occurrences – through 
such awesome manifesta 

                                                

6 Yes, it is only fitting that  the Qur’an  should explain  the three important duties of the rock strata, the 

foundation stone of the majestic travelling palace known as the earth, which are entrusted to it by the All-
Glorious Creator. 

Their First Duty: Just as earth acts as a mother to plants and raises them through dominical power, so 

through Divine power, the rocks act as a nurse to the earth and raise it. 

Their Second Duty: They serve the orderly circulation of waters in the body of the earth, like the 

circulation of the blood. 

Their Third Duty: This is to act as treasurer to the rising and continuous flow with regular balance of 

the springs and rivers, sources and streams. Indeed, the evidences of Divine unity which the rocks make 
flow with all their strength in mouthfuls in the form of the water of life, they write and sprinkle over the 
face of the earth. 

 

257 

tions of glory, the rocks fall from the high summits of the mountains and are broken up. 
Some  of  these  crumble  and  being  transformed  into  earth,  become  the  source  of  plants. 
Others  remain  as  rocks,  and  rolling  down  to the  valleys  and  plains,  are  scattered. They 
serve  many  purposes  in  the  works  of  the  earth’s  inhabitants;  by  being  utilized  in  their 
houses for example, and prostrating in submission before Divine wisdom and power for 
certain  hidden  instances  of  wisdom  and  benefits,  they  take  on  the  form  of  being  at  the 
command of the principles of Divine wisdom. The evidence that their leaving their high 
places out of awe, choosing lower places in humble fashion, and being the means of those 
significant  benefits,  and  that they  are  neither  futile,  nor  acting  of  their  own  accord,  nor 
are objects of chance, but that within the disorder, through the wise disposals of One All-
Wise and All-Powerful they are within a wise order not apparent to the superficial eye –
the evidence for this are the purposes and benefits attached to the rocks, and the perfect 
order and fine art of the shirts adorned and embossed with the jewels of fruits and flowers 
with which the bodies of the mountains down which they roll are clothed. These testify in 
a decisive fashion which cannot be doubted. 

Thus, you have seen how valuable these three parts of the verse are from the point of 
view  of  wisdom.  Now  see  the  Qur’an’s  subtle  manner  of  exposition  and  miraculous 
eloquence. See how it shows through the three famous and observed events in the three 
parts  of  the  verse,  the  tips  of  the  above-mentioned  extensive  and  important  truths,  and 
through  recalling  three  further  events,  which  are  a  warning  lesson,  it  offers  subtle 
guidance; its restrains in a way that cannot be resisted. 

For example, in the second part of the verse, it says: 

And, behold, there are some from which, when they are cleft, water issues;  

By alluding through this sentence to the rock which split with perfect eagerness under the 
Staff  of  Moses  (Peace  be  upon  him)  and  poured  forth  twelve  streams  from  twelve 
sources, it imparts the following meaning: O Children of Israel! Great rocks become soft 
and crumble before a single miracle of Moses (PUH). They shed tears in floods, pouring 
forth out of either awe or joy. How is it you are so unfair you are obstinate in the face of 
all Moses’ miracles, and not weeping, your eyes are lifeless and your hearts, hard? 

And in the third part, it says:  

And, behold, there are some that fall down for awe of God. 

Through calling to mind with this part the famous event of the huge mountain crumbling 
and  being scattered out of awe at the  manifestation of Divine glory, which occurred on 
Mount  Sinai  at  the  supplications  of  Moses  (Peace  be  upon  him),  and  the  rocks  rolling 
down all round out again in awe, it  

 

258 

teaches this meaning: O people of Moses (PUH)! How is it you do not fear God when the 
mountains  which  are  composed  of  rocks  are  crushed  and  scattered out of  awe  of  Him? 
Although  you know that Moses climbed Mount Sinai above  you  in order to receive the 
Covenant, and that on his seeking the vision of God, the mountain crumbled, and you saw 
it, how is  it  you are so bold  you do not tremble out of  fear of God, and  you make  your 
hearts hard and unfeeling? 

And, in the first part, it says: 

For, behold, there are rocks from which streams gush forth; 

Through recalling with this part rivers like the blessed Nile and the Tigris and Euphrates, 
which  gush  up  out  of  mountains,  the  Qur’an  makes  understood  the  miraculous  fashion 
rocks receive the creational commands and are subjugated to them. It infers the following 
meaning  to  vigilant  hearts:  it  is  certainly  not  possible  that  the  mountains  could  be  the 
actual source of such mighty rivers. For let us suppose the water was cut completely and 
the  mountains  each  became  a  conical  reservoir,  they  would  only  persist  a  few  months 
before  losing  the  balance  to the  swift  and  abundant  flow  of  those  large  rivers.  And  the 
rain, which penetrates only about a metre into the earth, would not be sufficient income 
for that high expenditure. This  means that the springs of these rivers are  not something 
ordinary and  natural arising  from chance,  but that the All-Glorious Creator makes them 
flow forth from an unseen treasury in truly marvellous fashion. 

Thus,  alluding  to  this  mystery  and  stating  this  meaning,  it  is  narrated  in  a  Hadith: 
“Each of those three rivers is a drop from Paradise which continuously issues forth from 
Paradise, as a result of which they are sources of abundance.”7 And in another it is said: 
“The source of these three rivers is from Paradise.”8 The truth of these narrations is this: 
since  physical  causes  are  not  capable  of  producing  their  abundant  flow,  their  sources 
must  be  in  an  unseen  world  and  must  arise  from  a  treasury  of  mercy;  the  equilibrium 
between their incomings and outgoings is maintained in this way.  

Thus,  through  inferring  this  meaning,  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  gives  the  following 
instruction:  O  Children  of  Israel  and  Sons  of  Adam!  With  your  hardness  of  heart, 
unfeelingness,  and  heedlessness  you  disobey  and  close  your  eyes  to the  commands  and 
light  of  knowledge  of  the  Pre-Eternal  Sun,  One  so  Glorious  that  He  makes  flow  forth 
from  the  mouths  of  common,  lifeless  rocks  mighty  rivers  like  the  blessed  Nile,  which 
transforms Egypt  into a paradise and produces witnesses to His unity  for the universe’s 
heart and earth’s mind as eloquent as the force, appearance, and abundant flow of those 
mighty rivers, and makes them flow to the hearts and minds of jinn and men.

How is it that while some unfeeling, lifeless rocks manifest the miracles of His power in 
such  wondrous  fashion,99  showing  the  All-Glorious  Creator  as  the  sunlight  shows  the 
sun, you are blind before the light of His knowledge, and do not see it? 

So see what eloquence has been clothed on these three truths, and note carefully the 
eloquent guidance. What hardness of heart can withstand without melting the heat of this 
eloquent guidance? 

If you have understood this from the beginning to here, behold one flash of the All-

Wise Qur’an’s miraculous guidance, and offer thanks to Almighty God! 

Glory be unto to You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught 
us; indeed, You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.10 

O God! Grant us understanding of the mysteries of the Qur’an as You love and 
is pleasing to You, and grant us success in the service of it. Amen. Through Your 
Mercy, O Most Merciful of the Merciful! 

O God! Grant blessings and peace to the one to whom the All-Wise Qur’an was 
revealed, and to all his Family and Companions. 

                                                

9 The blessed Nile rises in the Mountains of the Moon, the main stream of the River Tigris in a cave in 

the district of Müküs in the province of Van, and the main branch of the Euphrates, in the foothills of a 
mountain in the region of Diyadin. It is established by science that the origins of mountains are rocks 
solidified from liquid matter. One of the Prophet (PBUH)’s glorifications, “Glory be to the One Who 
spread out the earth on solidified liquid” is decisive evidence that the original creation of the earth was as 
follows: some liquid matter solidified at the Divine command and became rock. With Divine leave, the 
rock became earth. The word Earth (arz) in the glorification, means earth (soil). That is to say, the liquid 
matter was too soft to support anything, and the rock was too hard to be benefited from. Therefore, the All-
Wise and Compassionate One spread the earth over the rock and made it the place of habitation for living 
beings.

The Second Station 
of the Twentieth Word 

 [A  flash  of  the  Qur’an’s  miraculousness  that  shines  on  the  Miracles  of  the 
Prophets.] 

Note carefully the two questions and answers at the end. 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
Nor anything fresh or dry, but is in a Record Clear.11 

Fourteen years ago (and now thirty years have passed) in my Qur’anic commentary 
called  Isharat  al-I’jaz  (Signs  of  Miraculousness),  I  wrote  a  discussion  in  Arabic  about 
one of the mysteries of this verse. Now two of my brothers whose wishes are important in 
my view have asked for an explanation of that discussion in Turkish. And so, relying on 
Almighty God’s assistance, and on the effulgence of the Qur’an, I say this: 

According  to  one  interpretation,  the  Clear  Book  or  Record  consists  of  the  Qur’an. 
The  above  verse  states that  everything,  fresh  or  dry,  is  found  within  it,  is  that  so?  Yes, 
everything  is  found  in  it,  but  everyone  cannot  see  this,  for  all  the  things  it  contains  are 
found  at  different  levels.  Sometimes  the  seeds,  sometimes  the  nuclei,  sometimes  the 
summaries, sometimes the principles, sometimes the signs, are found either explicitly, or 
implicitly, or allusively, or vaguely, or as a reminder. One of these is expressed according 
to  need,  in  a  manner  suitable  to the  purposes  of  the  Qur’an  and  in  connection  with  the 
requirements of the position. For instance: 

Things  like  the  aeroplane,  electricity,  railways,  and  the  telegraph  have  come  into 
existence as wonders of science and technology as the result of man’s progress in science 
and industry. Surely the All-Wise Qur’an, which addresses all mankind, does not neglect 
these. Indeed, it has not neglected them; it indicates them in two ‘Ways’. 

The First:  In the form of the miracles of the Prophets... 
The  Second  is  this:  it  indicates  them  in  the  form  of  certain  historical  events.  For 

instance: 

                                                

11 Qur’an, 6:59. 

 

261 

Woe to the makers of the pit [of fire] * Fire  supplied [abundantly]  with fuel * 
Behold!  They  sat  over  against  [the  fire]  *  And  they  witnessed  [all]  that  they 
were doing against the believers * And they ill-treated them for no other reason 
than that they believed in God, the Mighty, the One to Whom all Praise is due.12 

Likewise, 

In  the  loaded  ark  *  And  We  have  created  for  them  similar  [vessels]  on  which 
they ride,13 14 

Just  as  verses  like  these  point  to  the  railway,  so  the  following  verse  alludes  to 

electricity, as well as pointing to numerous other lights and mysteries: 

God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as if 
there were a niche, and within it a lamp; the lamp enclosed in glass: the glass as 
it were a brilliant star. Lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east nor of 
the  west,  whose  oil  is  well-nigh  luminous,  though  the  fire  scarce  touched  it: 
Light upon Light!1515 God guides whom He wills to His Light.16 

Since numerous people have occupied themselves with this second sort, and they are 
in need of much care and elucidation, and since they are many, for now we shall content 
ourselves with these  verses that allude to the railway and electricity, and  shall  not open 
that door. 

As for The First Sort, it indicates them in the form of the Miracles of the Prophets. 

And we shall mention some of these by way of example. 

INTRODUCTION: The All-Wise Qur’an sends the Prophets to man’s communities 
as leaders and vanguards of spiritual and moral progress. Similarly it gives all of them a 
number  of  wonders  and  makes  them  the  masters  and  foremen  in  regard  to  mankind’s 
material  progress,  and  commands  men  to  follow  them  absolutely.  Thus,  just  as  by 
speaking of the spiritual and moral perfections of the Prophets, it is encouraging people 
to benefit from them, so too in discussing their miracles it is inferring encouragement to 
achieve  similar  things  and  to  imitate  them.  It  may  even  be  said  that  like  spiritual  and 
moral attainments, material attainments and wonders were first given to mankind as a gift 
by  the  hand  of  miracles.  Thus,  what  first  gave  man  the  gift  of  the  ship,  which  was  a 
miracle of Noah (Peace be upon him), and

illuminates that allusion. 
16 Qur’an, 24:35. 

 

262 

the  clock,  a  miracle  of  Joseph  (Peace  be  upon  him),  was  the  hand  of  miracles.  It  is  a 
subtle  indication  to this  truth  that  most  craftsmen  have  a  Prophet  as  the  patron  of  their 
craft. For example, seamen have Noah (PUH), watchmakers have Joseph (PUH), tailors 
have Idris (PUH), and so on. 

Indeed, investigative scholars and the science of rhetoric are in agreement that all the 
Qur’an’s verses contain numerous aspects of guidance and instruction. The verses of the 
miracles  of  the  Prophets,  which  are  the  most  brilliant  of  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous 
Exposition’s  verses,  are  not  therefore  mere  historical  stories,  but  comprise  numerous 
meanings and sorts of guidance. Yes, in  mentioning the Prophets’ miracles,  it is tracing 
the final limit of man’s science and industry. It is pointing the finger at his furthest aims. 
It  is  specifying  his  final  goals.  And  by  striking  the  hand  of  encouragement  on  man’s 
back, it is urging him forward towards them. Just as the past is the store of the seeds of 
the future and mirror to its attributes, so the future is the arable field of the past and the 
mirror  to  its  states.  Now  we  shall  explain  only  a  few  samples  of  that  most  extensive 
source as examples: 

For example, the verse: 

To  Solomon  [We  made]  the  wind  [obedient]:  its  early  morning  [stride]  was  a 
month’s [journey], and its evening [stride] was a month’s [journey],17 

which describes one of Solomon’s (Peace be upon him) miracles, the subjugating of the 
air.  This  says:  “Solomon  traversed  the  distance  of  two  months  in  one  day  by  flying 
through  the  air.”  It  is  thus  suggesting  that  the  road  is  open  for  man  to  cover  such  a 
distance in the air. In which case, O man! since the road is open to you, reach this level! 
And  in  meaning  Almighty  God  is  saying  through  the  tongue  of  this  verse:  “O  man!  I 
mounted one of my servants on the air because he gave up the desires of his soul. If you 
too give up laziness, which comes from the soul, and benefit thoroughly  from certain of 
my laws in the cosmos, you too may mount it...” 

And the verse, 

So  We  said:  “Strike  the  rock  with  your  staff.”  Then  gushed  forth  therefrom 
twelve springs,18 

which  explains  a  miracle  of  Moses  (Peace  be  upon  him).  This  verse  indicates  that  the 
treasuries  of  mercy  concealed  under  the  earth  may  be  profited  from  with  simple  tools. 
Even  from  places  hard  as  rock,  the  water  of  life  may  be  attracted  with  a  staff.  Thus, 
through  this  meaning  the  verse  says  to  man:  “You  may  find  the  subtlest  effulgence  of 
mercy, the water of life, with a staff. In which case, come on, work and find it!” And in 
meaning Almighty  

                                                

17 Qur’an, 34:12. 
18 Qur’an, 2:60. 

 

263 

God  says  through  the  verse’s  allusive  tongue:  “O  man!  I  put  in  the  hand  of  one  of  my 
servants who trusted in Me a staff that draws the water of life from wherever he wishes, if 
you  too  rely  on  the  laws  of  My  mercy,  you  may  obtain  an  implement  resembling  it  or 
close  to  it.  So,  come  on  and  do  so!”  And  one  of  the  most  important  contributions  to 
man’s  progress  was  the  creation  of  an  implement  that  causes  water  to  flow  forth  from 
most of the places it is struck. This verse traces farther goals and limits, and ends beyond 
that, just as the previous verse specified final points far ahead of today’s aeroplanes. 

And for example, 

I  shall  heal  the  blind  and  the  leper  and  I  shall  quicken  the  dead,  by  God’s 
leave,19 

which  concerns  a  miracle  of  Jesus  (Peace  be  upon  him).  Just  as  the  Qur’an  explicitly 
urges man to follow Jesus’ (Peace be upon him) high morals, so it allusively encourages 
him towards the elevated art and dominical medicine of which Jesus was the master. The 
verse indicates the following: “Remedies may be found for even the most chronic ills. In 
which case, O man!, O calamity-afflicted sons of Adam! Don’t despair! Whatever the ill, 
its  cure  is  possible.  Search  for  it  and  you  will  find  it.  It  is  even  possible  to  give  a 
temporary  tinge  of  life  to  death.”  And  in  meaning  Almighty  God  is  saying  through  the 
figurative  tongue  of  this  verse:  “O  man!  I  gave  two  gifts  to  one  of  My  servants  who 
abandoned the world for Me. One was the remedy for spiritual ills, and the other the cure 
for physical sicknesses. Moribund hearts were raised to life through the light of guidance, 
and sick people who were as though dead found health through his breath and cure. You 
too may find the cure for every ill in the pharmacy of My wisdom. Work to find it! If you 
seek, you will certainly find.” Thus, this verse traces the limit which is far ahead of man’s 
present progress in medicine. It hints at it, and urges him towards it. 

And for example, the verses: 

And  We  made  the  iron  soft  for  him20  *  And  We  gave  him  wisdom  and  sound 
judgement in speech and decision,21 

which are about David (Peace be upon him), and,  

And We made a font of molten copper to flow for him,22 

which is about Solomon (Peace be upon him). These indicate that the softening of iron is 
one of the greatest of Divine  bounties, through which  is shown the  virtue of one of the 
greatest Prophets. Indeed, softening iron, that is,  

                                                

19 Qur’an, 3:49. 
20 Qur’an, 34:10. 
21 Qur’an, 38:20. 
22 Qur’an, 34:12. 

 

264 

making it soft like dough, and smelting copper, and finding minerals and extracting them 
is the origin and source, and basis and foundation of all man’s material industries. Thus, 
this  verse  indicates:  “A  great  bounty  bestowed on  a  great  Messenger  and  vicegerent  of 
the  earth  in  the  form  of  a  great  miracle  was  the  softening  of  iron.  Making  it  as  soft  as 
dough  and  fine  as  a  thread  and  smelting  copper  are  the  basis  of  most  of  the  general 
industries.” Since wisdom was given to the tongue of one who was both Messenger and 
vicegerent,  that  is,  to  one  who  was  both  a  spiritual  and  material  leader,  and  craft  and 
industry were given to his hand. It is on the one hand explicitly urging men towards the 
wisdom on his tongue, and on the other is implicitly encouraging them towards the craft 
in  his  hand.  Through  the  allusive  tongue  of  this  verse,  in  meaning  Almighty  God  is 
saying: 

“O Sons of Adam! I gave such wisdom to the tongue and heart of one of My servants 
who  complied  with  my  commands  and  obligations  that  he  rendered  judgement  on 
everything with the finest distinction and made manifest the truth. And I gave him such 
art that he could  mould  iron  into any  shape  in  his hand as though  it  were wax. It was a 
significant  means  of  power  for  his  vicegerency  and  rule.  Since  it  was  possible,  it  was 
given. It is both important, and you are in much need of it in your social life. If you too 
obey  my  commands  in  creation,  that  wisdom  and  craft  will  be  given  you  too.  In  the 
course of time you will reach it and draw close to it.” Thus, it is through the softening of 
iron and smelting of copper that man achieves  his greatest progress  in  industry, and his 
greatest power and strength. In the verse, the word qitr is used to describe copper. These 
verses  direct  mankind’s  sight  towards  this  truth,  and  they  sternly  warned  the  people  of 
former  times  who  did  not  appreciate  their  importance,  as  well  as  the  lazy  in  modern 
times... 

And, for example, the verse, 

Said one who had knowledge of the Book: “I will bring it to you in the twinkling 
of an eye!” Then when [Solomon] saw it placed firmly before him,23 

which points to the  following wondrous event:  in order to attract Bilkis’ throne to him, 
one  of  Solomon’s  (Peace  be  upon  him)  ministers  who  was  versed  in  the  science  of 
attraction said: “I’ll have the throne here before you before you can blink your eyes.” The 
verse suggests then that it is possible to bring either things themselves or their images to 
one  instantaneously  from  far  away,  and  it  is  a  fact  that  Almighty  God  bestowed  this 
ability on Solomon (PBH) in the form of a miracle, to establish his innocence and justice. 
For being  honoured with rulership as well as  his  Messengership, Solomon could  in this 
way himself be informed of events in all the regions of his extensive dominions, and see 
the condition of his subjects and hear of their ills. That  

                                                

23 Qur’an, 27:40. 

 

265 

means, if man relies on Almighty God, and asks it of Him with the tongue of his innate 
capacity,  like  Solomon  (PBH)  asked  for  it  with  the  tongue  of  his  chastity,  and  if  he 
conforms to His laws of wisdom in the universe, the world may become like a town for 
him. That is to say, while Bilkis’ throne was in Yemen, it was instantaneously present in 
Damascus, or its  image was, and  it was seen. The  images of the  men around the throne 
were  also  certainly  conveyed  there,  and  their  voices  heard.  This  therefore  indicates 
splendidly the attraction of images and sounds from long distances, and in effect says: 

“O  Kings  and  Rulers!  If  you  wish  to  act  with  pure  justice,  endeavour  to  see  and 
understand the face of the earth in all its details, like Solomon. For, by rising to the level 
of being informed whenever he wishes about every part of his realm, a just ruler and king 
who cherishes his subjects will avoid inequity, and may rule with complete justice.” And 
Almighty God in effect says through the allusive tongue of the verse: 

“O Sons of Adam! I bestowed on one of My servants a broad realm, and so that he 
could act completely  justly within  it, I allowed  him to know personally of all  situations 
and events that occurred there. And since I have given all men the innate capacity to be 
vicegerent of the earth, I gave them also the ability to see, consider, and understand the 
whole  face of the earth  in  accordance  with that ability,  for My  wisdom requires this. If 
individuals do not reach that point, men may reach it as a race. And if they do not reach it 
physically, the saints may reach it in meaning. In which case, you may take advantage of 
this  great  bounty.  Come  on,  let’s  see  you  do  it!  On  condition  you  do  not  neglect  your 
duties  of  worship,  strive  to  transform  the  face  of  the  earth  into  a  garden  every  part  of 
which  you  may  see,  and  the  sounds  of  every  corner  of  which  you  may  hear.  Heed  the 
decree of the Most Merciful: 

It is He Who has made the earth manageable for you, so traverse its tracts and 
enjoy of the sustenance which He furnishes, but unto Him is the Resurrection.24 

The  above-mentioned  verse  thus  alludes  to  the  farthest  limit  far  in  the  future  in  the 
attraction of images and sounds, one of man’s finest arts, and hints encouragement. 

And, for example, the verses, 

And also others bound together in fetters25 * And of the evil ones were some who 
dived for him, and did other work besides,26 

state that Solomon (PBH) subjugated  jinns, satans, and evil  spirits, and preventing their 
evil,  employed  them  usefully,  and  they  say:  the  jinn,  the  most  important  intelligent 
inhabitants of the earth after man, may serve him.  

                                                

24 Qur’an, 67:15. 
25 Qur’an, 38:38. 
26 Qur’an, 21:82. 

 

266 

Contact  may  be  made with them. Devils too may be compelled to give up their  enmity 
and whether they  want to or not made to serve.  Thus,  Almighty God subjected them to 
one of His servants who was obedient to His commands. Through the allusive tongue of 
the verses, in meaning Almighty God is saying: “O man! I made jinns, devils, and their 
evil  obey  one  of  My  servants  who  obeyed  Me.  If  you  too  are  subjugated  to  my 
commands, numerous beings, and even jinns and devils, may be subjugated to you.” 

These  verses  trace  the  final  limits  of  the  calling-up  of  spirits,  and  conversing  with 
jinns, like spiritualism, which have been filtered from a blend of art and science and have 
arisen from man’s extraordinary physical and spiritual sensitivity. The verses specify the 
most beneficial form of these and open up the way to them. But it is not to be subjugated 
to  jinns,  devils,  and  evil  spirits,  who  sometimes  call  themselves  the  spirits  of  the  dead, 
and  to  become  their  playthings,  and  a  laughing-stock,  like  nowadays,  but  to  subjugate 
them through the talisman of the Qur’an, and be delivered from their evil. 

Other verses about Solomon (Peace be upon him) which allude to spirits appearing in 
physical form, and his calling up demons and subjugating them, and other verses besides, 
such as, 

Then  We  sent  to  her  Our  angel,  and  he  appeared  before  her  as  man  in  all 
respects,27 

indicate both the calling-up of spirits, and spirit beings assuming physical  form. But the 
calling-up  of  good  spirits  alluded  to  here  is  not  in  the  manner  of  ‘the  cultured,’  to  be 
disrespectful to spirits  in that utterly  serious world and attract them to their own places 
and  games,  but  –like  one  group  of  the  saints  like  Muhyiddin  al-Arabi,  who,  most 
seriously and for a serious purpose, met with spirits when they wanted– to be attracted to 
them and to form a relation with them, and by going to their place and drawing close to 
their world to an extent, to benefit from their spirituality. It is this that the verses allude 
to, and within the allusion, make it understood that they are encouraging man to achieve 
it. They trace the furthest limit of occult arts and sciences of this sort, and point out their 
best form. 

And, for example, the verses about David’s (Peace be upon him) miracles: 

It  was  We  that  made  the  hills  declare  in  unison  with  him  Our  praises,  at 
eventide, and at break of day.28 * O you mountains! Sing you back the Praises of 
God with him! and you birds! And We made the iron soft for him.29 * We have 
been taught the speech of birds.30 

These indicate that Almighty God gave to David’s (PBH) praises and glorifi 

                                                

27 Qur’an, 19:17. 
28 Qur’an, 38:18. 
29 Qur’an, 34:10. 
30 Qur’an, 27:16. 

 

267 

cations  such  strength and  a  sound so  loud  and agreeable they  brought the  mountains to 
ecstasy,  which,  each  like  a  huge  gramophone  or a  man,  formed  a  circle  on  the  horizon 
around the chief reciter, reciting also the glorifications. Is this possible, I wonder? Is it the 
truth? 

Yes,  it  is  the  truth.  Every  mountain  with  caves  can  speak  with  man  in  man’s 
language  like  a  parrot.  By  means  of  an  echo.  You  say:  “All  praise  be  to  God!”  to  the 
mountain before you, and the mountain will declare: “All praise be to God!”, exactly the 
same  as  you.  Since  Almighty  God  has  given  this  ability  to  mountains,  it  can  surely  be 
made to develop, and that seed made to sprout. 

Thus, since He gave to David (PBH) the vicegerency of the earth together with  his 
Messengership  in  exceptional  form,  He  so  made  the  seed  of  that  ability  unfold  –  as  a 
miracle  –  worthy  of  his  extensive  Messengership  and  magnificent  rule  that  huge 
mountains followed him like soldiers, students, or followers, and at his command and in 
his tongue declared the praises and glorifications of the All-Glorious Creator. Whatever 
David  (PBH)  said,  they  repeated.  Now  at  the  present  time,  because  the  means  of 
communication have multiplied and developed, a powerful commander could compel his 
large army dispersed in the mountains to declare: “God is Most Great!”, and could make 
the mountains speak, bringing them to tumult. Since a commander of men can make the 
mountains speak metaphorically in the tongue of those present in the mountains, surely a 
magnificent  commander  of  Almighty  God  could  make  them  speak  actually,  and  recite 
His  praises.  In  addition,  I  have  explained  in  previous  Words  that  all  mountains  have  a 
collective personality or corporate identity, and offer glorifications and worship in a way 
suitable to each. That is to say, just as through the mystery of echo all mountains recite 
glorifications in the tongue of men, so too they glorify the All-Glorious Creator in their 
own particular tongues. 
Also, the verses, 

And the birds gathered [in assemblies];31 * We have been taught the speech of 
birds,32 

show  that  Almighty  God  bestowed  on  David  and  Solomon  (Peace  be  upon  them) 
knowledge  of  the  tongues  of  the  bird  species,  and  of  the  tongues  of  their  innate 
capacities; that is, of the things for which they would be useful. Yes, since it is the truth 
and since the face of the earth is a laden table set up by the Most Merciful in honour of 
man, most of the other animals and birds who benefit from it may be subjugated to man 
and serve him. Man employs some of the smallest of them, the honey-bee and silk-worm, 
and through Divine inspiration has opened up a beneficial highway, and by employing

pigeons in various tasks and teaching birds like parrots to speak, he has added fine things 
to the virtues of human civilization. In the same way, if the tongues of innate capacities 
of other birds and animals were known, there are many species which could be employed 
in  important  tasks  like  their  brothers,  the  domesticated  animals.  For  example,  against 
plagues of locusts: if the tongue of starlings was known, who eat and destroy locusts, and 
their  movements  could  be  regulated,  what  valuable  services  they  could  be  employed  in 
free of charge.  

Thus,  this  verse  traces  the  furthest  limit  in  subjugating  birds  and  benefiting  from 
them  in  this  way,  and  in  making  lifeless  beings  speak  like  a  telephone  or  gramophone, 
and  in  profiting  from  birds.  It  specifies  the  most  distant  goal.  It  points  a  finger  at  it  in 
majestic fashion and in a way urges man towards it. Through the allusive tongue of these 
verses, Almighty God is therefore saying in meaning: 

“O  men! In order to honour his prophethood and the complete  justice of  his rule, I 
subjugated  to  one  of  your  fellow  men  who  was  totally  submissive  to  me,  the  huge 
creatures  in  my  dominions,  causing  them  to  speak,  and  I  made  most  of  my  troops  and 
animals his servants. In which case, since I have committed to each of you the Supreme 
Trust, from which the sky, earth, and mountains shrank, and I have given you the ability 
to  be  My  vicegerent  on  earth,  you  should  yield  to  Me, the  One  in  Whose  hand  are  the 
reins of these creatures, so that the creatures in My dominions may yield also to you, and 
you may obtain in the name of the One Who holds them, their reins, and rise to a position 
worthy of your abilities. 

Since the truth is this, rather than listening to the gramophone, playing with pigeons 
and making them deliver letters, and teaching parrots to speak, you should strive to attain 
to  the  most  agreeable  and  elevated  amusement.  Then  the  mountains  may  be  huge 
gramophones for you like David’s, and the harmonious recitations of Divine praises may 
reach your ears from the trees and plants at the touching of the breeze, and the mountains 
may  show  their  true  nature  as  wondrous  creatures  who  recite  the  Divine  praises  in 
thousands of tongues, and  most birds  may  be  clothed  in the  form of  intimate  friends or 
obedient  servants,  like  Solomon’s  Hoopoe.  Then  they  may  entertain  you  and  drive  you 
eagerly towards the perfections and attainments of which you are capable, and not make 
you fall from the position required by being a human being, like other amusements.” 

And, for example, in the verse, 

We said: “O fire! Be cool and [a means of] safety for Abraham,33 

                                                

33 Qur’an, 21:69. 

 

269 

which  is  about  one  of  Abraham’s  (Peace  be  upon  him)  miracles,  are  three  subtle 
indications: 

The First:  Like other natural causes,  fire does not act according to its own wishes 
and nature, blindly, but performs a duty under a command. Thus it did not burn Abraham 
(Peace be upon him), because it was commanded not to burn him. 

The Second:  There is a degree of heat which burns through its coldness. That is, it 
has an effect like burning. Through the word, Be cool!,34 Almighty God is saying to the 
coldness:  “Do not burn him with  your coldness, the same as  your  heat!” That  is to say, 
through its coldness, fire at that degree has an effect like burning. It is both fire and cold. 
In  fact,  in  natural  science there  is a degree of  fire, the state of ‘white  heat,’ the  heat of 
which does not spread to its surroundings. It attracts the heat around it to itself and with 
this  cold,  freezes  surrounding  liquids  such  as  water,  in  effect  burning  them  through  its 
cold. Thus, intense cold is a category of fire which burns through its cold. In which case, 
this intense cold is surely a part of Hell, for it contains all the degrees and sorts of fire. 

The Third:  Just as there  is an  immaterial  substance  like  belief  which counters the 
effects  of  Hell-fire  and  affords  protection  against  it,  the  armour  of  Islam,  so  there  is  a 
physical substance which protects against the effects of worldly fire. For as is required by 
the Name of All-Wise, this world is the abode of wisdom, and Almighty God carries out 
His works under the veil of causes. Therefore, the fire burnt neither Abraham’s body, nor 
his garments; He imbued them with a state which resisted fire. Thus, by this allusion, the 
verse  is  in  effect  saying:  “O  nation  of  Abraham!  Resemble  Abraham,  so  that  your 
garments  may  be  your  armour  against  fire,  your  greatest  enemy  both  here  and  there. 
Clothe  your  spirit  in  belief  in  God,  and  it  will  be  your  armour  against  Hell-fire. 
Moreover, there are certain substances which  Almighty God has  hidden  in the earth  for 
you  which  will  protect  you  from  the  evils  of  fire.  Search  for  them,  extract  them,  and 
clothe  yourselves  in  them!”  Thus,  one  of  man’s  important  discoveries  and  a  step  in  his 
progress was his finding a substance which fire does not burn; and he clothed himself in 
garments  resistant  to  fire.  So  see  how  elevated,  subtle,  and  fine  a  garment  this  verse 
weaves on the loom of Hanifan Musliman, which will not be rent in all eternity. 

And, for example, the verse, 

And He taught Adam the Names, all of them,35  

  

                                                

34 One Qur’anic commentary states: If He had not said: Be cool!, it would have burnt him with its 

coldness. [See, for example, Ibn Hanbal, al-Zuhd, 101.– Tr.] 

35 Qur’an, 2:31. 

 

270 

which says: “Adam’s (Peace be upon him) greatest miracle in the question of the supreme 
vicegerency was the teaching of the Names.” Like the miracles of the other Prophets each 
allude to a particular human wonder, the miracle of Adam, who was the father of all the 
Prophets and the ‘Inauguration of the Office of Prophethood,’ points almost explicitly to 
the  final  points  of  all  human  attainment  and  progress,  and  humanity’s  final  goals. 
Through the tongue of allusion, Almighty God (May His glory be exalted) is saying with 
this verse:  

“O  Sons  of  Adam!  Since  as  a  proof  of  their  superiority  over  the  angels  in  the 
question of the vicegerency, I taught your forefather all the Names, you too, since you are 
his sons and the inheritors of his abilities, should learn all the Names and in your position 
as holder of the Supreme Trust demonstrate before all creatures your worthiness. For the 
way is open to you to rise to exalted rank such as holding the highest positions over all 
beings in the universe, and for vast creatures like the earth to be subjected to you. Come 
on,  step  forward,  adhere  to  all  My  Names,  and  rise!  But  your  forefather  was  once 
deceived  by  Satan,  and  temporarily  fell  to  the  earth  from  a  position  like  Paradise. 
Beware! In  your progress, do not follow Satan and from the heavens of Divine wisdom 
thus  fall  into the  misguidance  of  ‘nature.’  Continuously  raising  your  head  and  studying 
carefully  My  Most  Beautiful  Names,  make  your  sciences  and  your  progress  steps  by 
which to ascend to those heavens. Then you may rise to My dominical Names, which are 
the  realities  and  sources  of  your  sciences  and  attainments,  and  you  may  look  to  your 
Sustainer with your hearts through the telescope of the Names.” 

A SIGNIFICANT POINT AND IMPORTANT MYSTERY 

By  describing  under  the  title  of  ‘the  teaching  of  the  Names’  all  the  attainments  of 
learning and scientific progress and wonders of technology which man manifests through 
his  comprehensive  disposition,  this  wondrous  verse  contains  the  following  subtle  and 
elevated  allusion:  all  attainments  and  perfections,  all  learning,  all  progress,  and  all 
sciences, have an elevated reality which is based on one of the Divine Names. On being 
based  on  the  Name,  which  is  concealed  under  numerous  veils  and  has  various 
manifestations  and  different  spheres,  the  sciences  and  arts  and  attainments  find  their 
perfection and become reality. They are not some incomplete and deficient shadow. 

For example, engineering is a science; its reality and final point reaches to Almighty 
God’s  Names  of  All-Just  and  Determiner,  and  observes  with  all  their  majesty  the  wise 
manifestation of those Names in the mirror of engineering.  

And, for example, medicine is a science, and also an art; its final point and reality are 
based on the Absolutely Wise One’s Name of Healer, and through observing that Name’s 
compassionate manifestations in the vast  

 

271 

pharmacy of the earth, medicine finds its perfection and becomes reality. 

And, for example, the natural sciences, which discuss the reality of beings; through 
seeing  the  regulating,  nurturing  supreme  manifestations  of  Almighty  God’s  (May  His 
glory  be  exalted)  Name  of  All-Wise  in  things,  in  their  benefits  and  advantages,  and 
through  attaining  to  the  Name,  and  being  based  on  It,  these  sciences  may  contain  true 
wisdom. Otherwise they are either transformed into superstition, or become nonsense, or 
open up the way to misguidance like Naturalist philosophy. 

There,  three  examples  for  you!  You  may  make  analogies  with  these  for  the  other 

sciences and attainments.  

Thus,  with  this  verse,  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  strikes  the  hand  of  encouragement  on 
man’s back, urging him to the highest peaks, the furthest limits, the final degrees, which 
he is far behind at the present degree of his progress. It points its fingers at those degrees, 
saying:  “Forward  march!”  Contenting  ourselves  for  now  with  these  jewels  from  the 
sublime treasury of this verse, we close this door. 

Also, for example, the All-Wise Qur’an, the supreme miracle of Muhammad (Peace 
and blessings be upon him), the Seal of the Office of Prophethood, in the face of whose 
claim to Divine Messengership the miracles of all the former Prophets were like a single 
confirmatory miracle; the leader of the Prophets and cause of pride of the universe; who 
manifested  in  detail  with  all  their  degrees  all  the  Names  which  were  taught  in  brief  to 
Adam (PBH); who, in raising his finger, through the manifestation of Divine glory split 
the moon, and lowering it, through the manifestation of Divine beauty poured water from 
it  like  the  Spring  of  Kawthar;  and  who  was  verified  and  corroborated  by  a  thousand 
miracles.36 Through numerous clear verses like, 

Say: If all mankind and the Jinn  were to gather together to produce the like of 
this Qur’an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they backed up each 
other with help and support,37 

which  describes  the  purity  of  its  exposition,  the  eloquence  of  its  expression,  the 
comprehensiveness  of  its  meanings,  and  the  elevatedness  and  sweetness  of  its  styles 
concerning truth and reality, which are the most brilliant of the All-Wise Qur’an’s aspects 
of miraculousness – through verses like these, it directs the gazes of men and jinn to the 
clearest  and  most  brilliant  aspects  of  this  pre-eternal  miracle.  It  provokes  all  men  and 
jinn.  Arousing  the  eagerness  of  its  friends  and  obstinacy  of  its  enemies,  it  urges  them 
with intense encouragement to imitate and copy it, to resemble it with their words. It also 
places that miracle before the eyes of creatures in such a way that it is as if the only aim 
in man coming into this world is to take that miracle as his goal

272 

and  guiding  principle,  and  studying  it  to  understand  the  purpose  of  his  creation,  and  to 
proceed towards it. 

In  Brief:    The  miracles  of  the  other  Prophets  (Peace  be  upon  them)  all  indicate  a 
wonder  of  human  art  or  craft,  and  Adam’s  (Peace  be  upon  him)  miracle  indicates  in 
concise form, besides the bases of those crafts, the index of the sciences and branches of 
knowledge, and of the wonders and perfections, and urges man towards them. As for the 
Qur’an of  Miraculous Exposition, the supreme  miracle of Muhammad (PBUH), since  it 
shows in detail the reality of the teaching of the Names, it points clearly to the true goal 
of  the  sciences  and  branches  of  knowledge,  which  are  truth  and  reality,  as  well  as  the 
perfections,  attainments,  and  happiness  of  this  world  and  the  next.  With  truly  powerful 
encouragement, it urges man towards them. It encourages and urges in a such way it says:  
“O  man!  In  the  face  of  manifestations  of  dominicality,  the  elevated  purpose  of  the 
universe is man’s universal worship and submission to God, while his furthest aim is to 
attain to that worship by means of those sciences and perfections.” In stating this, it hints:  
“At the end of time, mankind will spill into science and learning. It will obtain all its 

strength from science. Power and rule will pass to the hand of science.”  

Also,  since  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  repeatedly  puts  forward  its 
eloquence and  beauty of expression,  by  allusion  it says:  “At the end of time, eloquence 
and  beauty of expression, the  most brilliant of the sciences and  branches of knowledge, 
will be most sought after in all their varieties. Even, in order to make one another accept 
their  ideas  and  carry  out  their  word,  men  will  find  their  most  effective  weapon  in 
eloquent expression, and their most irresistible force in fine oratory.” 

In Short: Most of the Qur’an’s verses are keys to a treasury of perfections and guides 

to a store of knowledge. 

If you wish, you may reach up to the skies of the Qur’an and the stars of its verses by 
making the previous twenty Words a stairway of twenty steps.38 Through them you will 
see what a brilliant sun  is the Qur’an! See how  it sprinkles a pure  light over the Divine 
truths and the truths of the contingent realm! See what a brilliant effulgence it spreads! 

Conclusion:    Since  together  with  alluding  to  the  wonders  of  present-day  human 
progress, all the verses about the Prophets are also in a style which as though infers and 
traces their limits in the future; and since it is certain that all the verses point to numerous 
meanings, indeed, it is unanimously  

                                                

stairway of one hundred and twenty steps. 

38 Indeed, the thirty-three Words, thirty-three Letters, thirty-one Flashes, and thirteen Rays form a 

 

273 

agreed upon, and since there are categorical commands to follow and obey the Prophets, 
then  together  with  the  explicit  meanings  of  the  above  verses,  it  may  be  said  that  they 
indicate  in  allusive  fashion  the  important  of  man’s  arts  and  sciences,  and  urge  him 
towards them. 

TWO IMPORTANT ANSWERS 
TO TWO IMPORTANT QUESTIONS 

THE FIRST 

If  you  say:  “The  Qur’an  was  revealed  for  man,  so  why  does  it  not  describe  the 
wonders of civilization explicitly, for they have the greatest importance in his eyes? Why 
does  it  suffice  with  secret  signs,  concealed  allusions,  slight  indications,  and  slender 
reminders?” 

The Answer:  Because the rights of the marvels of human civilization can only claim 
that much in the Qur’an’s discussions. For the Qur’an’s basic duty is to teach about the 
perfections and acts  in the ‘sphere of dominicality’ and the duties and circumstances  in 
the ‘sphere of worship.’ So the rights of human wonders in those two spheres diminish to 
being only a weak sign and slight indication. For if they were to demand their rights from 
the ‘sphere of dominicality,’ they would receive very few.  

For example, if man’s aeroplane39 were to say to the Qur’an: “Give me the right to 
speak and a place in your verses,” the planets, earth, and moon, which are the aeroplanes 
of the ‘sphere of dominicality,’ would reply in the name of the Qur’an: “You take a place 
in  relation  to  your  size.”  And  if  man’s  submarines  were  to  ask  for  a  place  from  the 
Qur’an’s verses, the submarines of that sphere, that is, the earth and stars which swim in 
the  vast  ocean  of  the  atmosphere  and  the  ether  would  say:  “Your  place  beside  us  is  so 
small as to be negligible.” And if the brilliant, star-like electric lights were to demand the 
right to speak and ask to be  included  in  its  verses, the electric  lights of that sphere, the 
shooting  stars,  lightning,  and  stars  and  lamps  which  adorn  the  face  of  the  skies,  would 
say:  “You  may  enter  its  discussions  and  explanations  in  relation  to  your  light.”  If  the 
wonders  of  civilization  were  to  demand  their  rights  with  a  view  to  fineness  of  art  and 
seek a place from its verses, then a single fly would bid them to be silent, saying: “Your 
rights  are  not  equal  to  even  one  of  my  wings!  For  if  all  the  fine  arts  and  delicate 
instruments  achieved  through  man’s  faculty  of  will  were  to  be  gathered  together,  they 
could  not  be  as  wondrous  as  the  fine  art  of  my  delicate  members  and  tiny  body.”  The 
verse, 

                                                

39 While writing this serious matter, involuntarily my pen adopted this subtle, though witty, style. So I 

left my pen free. I hope that the somewhat unserious style does not mar the seriousness of the subject. 

 

274 

Those on whom you call besides God cannot create [even] a fly, if they all met 
together for the purpose.40 

bids you to fall silent!” 

If the marvels of civilization were to go to the ‘sphere of worship’ and demand their 
rights, they would receive a reply like this: “Your relations with us are very few, and you 
may  not easily enter our sphere. For our programme  is this: the world  is a guest-house, 
and as for man, he remains there only a short time. He is a guest with many duties and in 
a  brief  lifetime  is  charged  with  preparing  all  the  necessities  for  eternal  life.  The  most 
important and essential matters will be offered to you. But most of you see this fleeting 
world  through  a  veil  of  heedlessness,  as  an  eternal  abode,  coloured  and  shaped  by 
worldly  feelings.  So  your  share  of  worship,  the  basis  of  which  is  love  of  the  truth  and 
thinking  of  the  hereafter,  is  very  small.  However,  if  there  are  among  you  respected 
craftsmen  and  artists  and  inspired  inventors,  who,  purely  for  the  benefit  of  God’s 
servants,  serve  the  general  interest  and  public  well-being  and  betterment  of  social  life, 
which  is  a  valuable  worship,  these  signs  and  indications  of  the  Qur’an  are  surely 
sufficient for those sensitive people, who of course form a minority, in order to encourage 
their efforts and appreciate their art.” 

THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION 

If you say:  “None of my doubts remains now after these investigations, and I affirm 
that  together  with  other  wonders,  in  the  Qur’an  are  allusions  to  and  indications  of  the 
wonders  of  modern  civilization,  indeed,  to  further  advancements.  Everything  necessary 
for man’s happiness in this world and the next is found within it in relation to its worth. 
But why does the Qur’an not mention them explicitly so that obstinate unbelievers would 
be compelled to confirm it, and our hearts also would be easy?” 

The  Answer:    Religion  is  an  examination,  a  test,  proposed  by  God  so  that  in  the 
arena  of  competition  elevated  spirits  and  base  spirits  may  be  distinguished  from  one 
another.  Just  as  materials  are  plunged  in  the  fire  so  that  diamonds  and  coal,  gold  and 
earth, separate out from one another, so too religion is a trial concerning the obligations 
placed  on  man  by  God  and  a  driving  to  competition,  which  is  what  this  abode  of 
examination  consists  of.  In  this  way  the  elevated  jewels  in  the  mine  of  man’s  abilities 
become  separated  out  from  the  dross.  Since  the  Qur’an  was  revealed  in  this  abode  of 
examination  for  man  to  be  perfected  through  trial  in  the  arena  of  competition,  it  will 
surely  only  allude  to  the  hidden  events  of  the  future  pertaining  to  this  world  which 
everyone  will  see, and will only open the door to the reason to a degree that proves  its 
argument. If it mentioned them explicitly, the  

                                                

40 Qur’an, 22:73. 

 

275 

mystery of man’s accountability would be negated. Simply, it would be as self-evident as 
writing There is no god but God clearly in stars on the face of the skies. Then everyone 
would  have to affirm  it whether they wanted to or not. There would be no competition, 
and  the  examination  too  would  go  for  nothing.  A  spirit  like  coal  would  remain  on  the 
same level of a spirit like diamonds.41 

In Short:  The All-Wise Qur’an is wise. It affords everything a position in relation to 
its  value. Thus, one thousand three hundred  years ago, the Qur’an saw concealed  in the 
darkness  of  the  future,  man’s  hidden  fruits  and  progress,  and  showed  them  in  a  form 
better than we see and shall see. That means the Qur’an is the Word of One Who sees at 
the same instant all time and all within it. 

Thus,  one  flash  of  the  Qur’an’s  miraculousness  which  shines  on  the  face  of  the 

miracles of the Prophets. 

O  God!  Grant  us  understanding  of  the  mysteries  of  the  Qur’an  and  success  in 
the service of it at every instant at all times. 

Glory be unto You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught us; 
indeed, You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.42 

O God! Grant blessings and peace and benedictions and honour to our master 
and lord Muhammad, Your servant and Prophet and Messenger, the Unlettered 
Prophet, and to his Family and Companions and wives and descendants, and to 
all  the  Prophets  and  Messengers,  and  to  the  angels  close  to  Your  Throne,  and 
the  saints  and  the  righteous;  grant  too  the  most  excellent  of  blessings  and  the 
purest peace and the most abundant benedictions, to the number of the Suras of 
the  Qur’an,  and  its  verses,  and  words  and  letters,  and  its  meanings  and 
indications  and  signs  and  allusions,  and  grant  us  forgiveness,  and  have  mercy 
on  us,  and  be  gracious  to  us,  O  God,  Our  Creator,  to  the  number  of  those 
blessings, through Your mercy, O Most Merciful of the Merciful! And all praise 
be to God, the Sustainer of All the Worlds. Amen. Amen. 

41 . Abu Jahl the Accursed and Abu Bakr the Truthful would appear to be equal, and the mystery of the 

                                                

examination set by God, lost. 

42 Qur’an, 2:32. 

 

276 

The Twenty-First Word 

[This Word consists of Two Stations.] 

First Station 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
For such Prayers are enjoined on believers at stated times.1 

One time, a man great in age, physique, and rank said to me: “The prayers are fine, 
but  to  perform  them  every  single  day  five  times  is  excessive.  Since  they  never  end,  it 
becomes wearying.” 

A long time after the man said these words, I listened to my soul and I heard it say 
exactly  the  same  things.  I  looked  at  it  and  saw  that  with  the  ear  of  laziness,  it  was 
receiving the same lesson from Satan. Then I understood that those words were as though 
said in the name of all evil-commanding souls, or else they had been prompted. So I said: 
“Since my soul commands to evil, one who does not reform his own soul cannot reform 
others. In which case, I shall begin with my own soul.” 

I  said:  O  soul!  Listen  to  five  ‘Warnings’  in  response  to  those  words  which  you 
uttered  in  compounded  ignorance,  on  the  couch  of  idleness,  in  the  slumber  of 
heedlessness. 

FIRST WARNING 

O  my  wretched soul! Is  your  life eternal, I wonder? Have  you any  incontrovertible 
document showing that you will live to next year, or even to tomorrow? What causes you 
boredom  is  that  you  fancy  you  shall  live  for  ever.  You  complain  as  though  you  will 
remain  in  this  world  to  enjoy  yourself  for  ever.  If  you  had  understood that  your  life  is 
brief and that it is departing fruitlessly, it surely would not cause you boredom, but excite 
a  real  eagerness  and  agreeable  pleasure  to  spend  one  hour  out  of  the  twenty-four  on  a 
fine,  agreeable,  easy,  and  merciful  act  of  service  which  is  a  means  of  gaining  the  true 
happiness of eternal life. 

                                                

1 Qur’an, 4:103. 

 

277 

SECOND WARNING 

O my stomach-worshipping soul! Every day you eat bread, drink water, and breathe 
air; do they cause you boredom? They do not, because since the need is repeated, it is not 
boredom  that they  cause,  but  pleasure.  In  which  case,  the  five  daily  prayers  should  not 
cause  you  boredom,  for  they  attract  the  needs  of  your  companions  in  the  house  of  my 
body, the sustenance of my heart, the water of life of my spirit, and the air of my subtle 
faculties.  Yes,  it  is  by  knocking  through  supplication  on  the  door  of  One  All-
Compassionate and Munificent that sustenance and strength  may be obtained for a heart 
afflicted with infinite griefs and sorrows and captivated by infinite pleasures and hopes. 
And it is by turning towards the spring of mercy of an Eternal Beloved through the five 
daily  prayers  that  the  water  of  life  may  be  imbibed  by  a  spirit  connected  with  most 
beings,  which  swiftly  depart  from  this  transitory  world  crying  out  at  separation.  And 
being  most  needy  for  air  in  the  sorrowful,  crushing,  distressing,  transient,  dark,  and 
suffocating conditions of this world,  it is only through the window of the prayers that a 
conscious inner sense and luminous subtle faculty can breathe, which by its nature desires 
eternal  life  and  was  created  for  eternity  and  is  a  mirror  of  the  Pre-Eternal  and  Post-
Eternal One and is infinitely delicate and subtle. 

THIRD WARNING 

O my impatient soul! Is it at all sensible to think today of past hardships of worship, 
difficulties of the prayers, and troubles of  misfortune, and  be distressed, and to imagine 
the future duties of worship, service of the prayers, and sorrows of disaster, and display 
impatience?  In  being  thus  impatient  you  resemble  a  foolish  commander,  who,  although 
the  enemy’s  right  flank  joined  his  right  flank  and  became  fresh  forces  for  him,  sent  a 
significant force to the right  flank, and weakened the centre. Then, while there were  no 
enemy soldiers on the  left  flank, he sent a large  force there, and gave them the order to 
fire. No forces then remained in the centre, and the enemy understood this and attacked it 
and routed him.  

Yes,  you  resemble  this,  for  the  troubles  of  yesterday  have  today  been  transformed 
into mercy; the pain has gone while the pleasure remains. The difficulty has been turned 
into blessings, and the hardship into reward. In which case, you should not feel wearied at 
it, but make a serious effort to continue with a new eagerness and  fresh enthusiasm.  As 
for  future days, they  have  not yet arrived, and to think of them  now and  feel  bored and 
wearied is a lunacy like thinking today of future hunger and thirst, and starting to  shout 
and cry out. Since the truth is this, if you are reasonable, you will think of only today in 
connection  with  worship,  and  say:  “I  am  spending  one  hour  of  it  on  an  agreeable, 
pleasant, and elevated act of service, the reward  for which  is  high and whose trouble  is 
little.” Then your bitter dispiritedness will be transformed into sweet endeavour. 

 

278 

My  impatient  soul!  You  are  charged  with  being  patient  in  three  respects.  One  is 
patience in worship. Another is patience in refraining from sin. And a third is patience in 
the  face  of  disaster.2  If  you  are  intelligent,  take  as  your  guide  the  truth  apparent  in  the 
comparison  in  this  Third  Warning.  Say  in  manly  fashion:  “O  Most  Patient  One!”,  and 
shoulder the three sorts of patience. If you do not squander on the wrong way the forces 
of  patience  Almighty  God  has  given  you,  they  should  be  enough  to  withstand  every 
difficulty and disaster. So hold out with those forces! 

FOURTH WARNING 

O my foolish soul! Is this duty of worship without result, and is its recompense little 
that it causes  you weariness?  Whereas  if  someone was to give  you a  little  money, or to 
intimidate  you,  he  could  make  you  work  till  evening,  and  you  would  work  without 
slacking. So is it that the prescribed prayers are without result, which in this guest-house 
of  the  world  are  sustenance  and  wealth  for  your  impotent  and  weak  heart,  and  in  your 
grave,  which  will  be  a  certain  dwelling-place  for  you,  sustenance  and  light,  and  at  the 
Resurrection,  when  you  will  anyway  be  judged,  a  document  and  patent,  and  on  the 
Bridge  of  Sirat,  over  which  you  are  bound  to  pass,  a  light  and  a  mount?  Are  their 
recompense little? Someone promises you a present worth a hundred liras, and makes you 
work  for  a  hundred  days.  You  trust  the  man  who  may  go  back  on  his  word  and  work 
without slacking. So if One for Whom the breaking of a promise is impossible, promises 
you  recompense  like  Paradise  and  a  gift  like  eternal  happiness,  and  employs  you  for  a 
very  short time  in a  very agreeable duty,  if  you  do not perform that service, or  you act 
accusingly  towards  His  promise  or  slight  His  gift  by  performing  it  unwillingly  like 
someone  forced to work, or by  being  bored, or by working  in  half-hearted  fashion,  you 
will deserve a severe reprimand and awesome punishment. Have you not thought of this? 
Although  you  serve  without  flagging  in  the  heaviest  work  in  this  world  out  of  fear  of 
imprisonment,  does  the  fear  of  an  eternal  incarceration  like  Hell  not  fill  you  with 
enthusiasm for a truly light and agreeable act of service? 

FIFTH WARNING 

O my world-worshipping soul! Does your slackness in worship and remissness in the 
prescribed  prayers  arise  from  the  multiplicity  of  your  worldly  occupations,  or  because 
you cannot find time due to the struggle  for  livelihood?  Were  you created only  for this 
world that you spend all  your time on  it? You know that in regard to your abilities  you 
are superior to all the animals,  but in regard to procuring the  necessities of worldly  life 
you cannot compete with even a sparrow. So why can you not understand that your basic  

                                                

2 Suyuti, al-Durar al-Muntathira, 46; Suyuti, al-Fath al-Kabir, ii, 200. 

 

279 

duty  is  not  to  labour  like  an  animal,  but  to  strive  for  a  true,  perpetual  life,  like  a  true 
human being. In addition, the things you call worldly occupations mostly do not concern 
you,  and  are  trivial  matters  which  you  meddle  in  officiously.  You  neglect  the  essential 
things and pass your time acquiring inessential information as though you were going to 
live  for  a  thousand  years.  For  example,  you  squander  your  precious  time  on  worthless 
things like learning what the rings around Saturn are like or how many chickens there are 
in America. As though you were becoming an expert in astronomy or statistics. 

If you say: “What keeps me from the prayers and worship and causes me to be lax is 
not unnecessary things like that, but essential matters like earning a livelihood,” then my 
answer is this: if you work for a daily wage of one hundred kurush, and someone comes 
to you and says: “Come and dig here for ten minutes, and you will find a brilliant and an 
emerald worth a hundred liras.” If you reply: “No, I won’t come, because ten kurush will 
be cut from my wage and my subsistence will be less,” of course you understand what a 
foolish  pretext  it  would  be.  In  just  the  same  way,  you  work  in  this  orchard  for  your 
livelihood.  If  you  abandon  the  obligatory  prayers,  all  the  fruits  of  your  effort  will  be 
restricted to only a worldly, unimportant, and unproductive livelihood. But if you spend 
your  rest  periods  on  the  prayers,  which  allow  your  spirit  to  relax  and  heart  to  take  a 
breather,  you  will  discover  two  mines  which  are  an  important  source,  both  for  a 
productive worldly livelihood, and your livelihood and provisions of the hereafter. 

First Mine: Through a sound  intention,  you will  receive a  share of the praises and 
glorifications offered by all the plants and trees, whether flowering or fruit-bearing, that 
you grow in the garden.3 

Second  Mine:    Whatever  is  eaten  of  the  garden’s  produce,  whether  by  animals  or 
man, cattle or flies, buyers or thieves, it will become like almsgiving from you.4 But on 
condition you work in the name of the True Provider and within the bounds of what He 
permits, and see yourself as a distribution official giving His property to His creatures. 

So see what a great loss is made by one who abandons the prescribed prayers. What 
significant  wealth  he  loses,  and  he  is  deprived  of  those  two  results  and  mines  which 
would otherwise cause him to work eagerly and ensure his morale is strong; he becomes 
bankrupt. Even, as he grows old, he will grow weary of gardening and lose interest in it, 
saying, “What is it to me? I am anyway leaving this world, why should I put up with this 
much difficulty?” He will sink into idleness. But the first man says: “I shall work harder 
at both worship and licit activities in order to send even more abundant light to my grave 
and procure more provisions for my life in the hereafter.” 

                                                

3 This First Station was a lesson for someone in a garden, so it was explained in this way.

280 

In Short:  O my  soul!  Know that yesterday  has  left you, and as  for tomorrow, you 
have nothing to prove that it will be yours. In which case, know that your true life is the 
present day. So throw at least one of its hours into a mosque or prayer-mat, a coffer for 
the hereafter like a reserve fund, set up for the true future. Know too that for you and for 
everyone  each  new  day  is  the  door to  a  new  world.  If  you  do  not  perform  the  prayers, 
your  world  that  day  will  depart  dark  and  wretched,  and  will  testify  against  you  in  the 
World of Similitudes. For everyone, every day, has a private world out of this world, and 
its nature is dependent on the person’s heart and actions. Like a splendid palace reflected 
in a mirror takes on the colour of the mirror; if it is black, it appears black; if it is red, it 
appears red. Also it takes on the qualities of the mirror; if the mirror is smooth, it shows 
the  palace  to  be  beautiful,  and  if  it  is  not,  it  shows  it  to  be  ugly.  As  it  shows  the  most 
delicate  things  to  be  coarse,  so  you  alter the  shape  of  your  own  world  with  your  heart, 
mind, actions, and wishes. You may make it testify either for you or against you. If you 
perform  the  five  daily  prayers,  and  through  them  you  are  turned  towards  that  world’s 
Glorious Maker, all of a sudden your world, which looks to you, is lit up. Quite simply as 
though the prayers are an electric  lamp  and  your  intention to perform them touches the 
switch, they disperse the world’s darkness and show the changes and movements within 
the  confused  wretchedness  of  worldly  chaos  to  be  a  wise  and  purposeful  order  and  a 
meaningful writing of Divine power. They scatter one light of the light-filled verse, 

God is the Light of the Heavens and the Earth5 

over your heart, and your world on that day is illuminated through the light’s reflection. It 
will cause it to testify in your favour through its luminosity. 

Beware,  do  not  say:    “What  are  my  prayers  in  comparison  with  the  reality  of  the 
prayers?”,  because  like  the  seed  of  a  date-palm  describes  the  full-grown  tree,  your 
prayers  describe  your  tree.  The  difference  is  only  in  the  summary  and  details;  like  the 
prayers of a great saint, the prayers of ordinary people like you or me, even if they are not 
aware  of  it,  have  a  share  of  that  light.  There  is  a  mystery  in  this  truth,  even  if  the 
conscious  mind  does  not  perceive  it...  but  the  unfolding  and  illumination  differs 
according  to  the  degrees  of  those  performing  them.  However  many  stages  and  degrees 
there are from the seed of a date-palm to the mature tree, the degrees of the prayers and 
their stages are even more numerous. But the essence of that luminous truth is present in 
all the degrees. 

O God! Grant blessings and peace to the one who said: “The five daily prayers 
are the pillar of religion,”6 and to all his Family and Companions.

The Second Station 
of the Twenty-First Word 

[This comprises five cures for five of the heart’s wounds.] 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
And  say:  “O  my  Sustainer!  I  seek  refuge  with  You  from  the  suggestions  of  the 
evil  ones  *  And  I  seek  refuge  with  you,  O  my  Sustainer,  lest  they  should  come 
near me.”7 

O  one  afflicted  with  the  sickness  of  scruples!  Do  you  know  what  your  scruples 
resemble? A calamity! The more importance they are given, the more they grow. If you 
give them no importance, they die away. If you see them as big, they grow bigger. If you 
see them as small, they grow smaller. If  you  fear them, they  swell and  make  you  ill. If 
you  do  not  fear  them,  they  are  light  and  remain  hidden.  If  you  do  not  know  their  true 
nature, they  persist  and  become  established.  While  if  you  do  know them  and  recognize 
them, they disappear. And so, I shall explain only five ‘Aspects’ which, of the many sorts 
of  these  calamitous  scruples,  are  those  which  most  frequently  occur.  Perhaps  it  may  be 
curative for you and for me, for these scruples are such that ignorance invites them and 
knowledge repulses them. If  you do not recognize them they come,  if  you do recognize 
them they go. 

FIRST ASPECT - FIRST WOUND 

Satan first casts a doubt into the heart. If the heart does not accept it, it turns from a 
doubt  into  abuse.  It  depicts  before  the  imagination  some  unclean  memories  and 
unmannerly, ugly states which resemble abuse, and causes the heart to declare: “Alas!”, 
and  fall  into  despair.  The  person  suffering  from  scruples  supposes  that  he  has  acted 
wrongfully  before his Sustainer and  feels  a terrible agitation and anxiety. In order to be 
saved from it, he flees from the Divine presence and wants to plunge into heedlessness. 
The cure for this wound is this: 

O  wretched  man  suffering  from  scruples!  Do  not  be  alarmed!  For  what  comes  to 
your  mind  is  not  abuse,  but  something  imaginary.  And  like  to  imagine  unbelief  is  not 
unbelief, to imagine abuse is not abuse either. For  

                                                

7 Qur’an, 23:97-8. 

 

282 

according to logic, an imagining is not a judgement, and abuse is a judgement. Moreover, 
those  ugly  words  are  not  the  words  of  your  heart,  because  your  heart  is  saddened  and 
sorry at them. Rather they come from the inner faculty situated near the heart which is a 
means of Satanic whisperings. The harm of scruples is imagining the harm. That is, it is 
to suffer harm in the heart through imagining them to be harmful. For it is imagining to 
be reality an imagining which is devoid of judgement. Also, it is to attribute to the heart 
Satan’s works; to suppose his words to be from it. Such a person thinks it is harmful, so it 
becomes harmful. That is anyway what Satan wanted. 

SECOND ASPECT 

It  is  this:  when  meanings  arise  in  the  heart,  they  enter  the  imagination  stripped  of 
form;  it  is  there  that  they  are  clothed  in  an  image  or  form.  The  imagination,  always 
affected by some cause, weaves images of a sort. It leaves on the way the images of the 
things to which it gives importance. Whatever meaning passes through it, it either clothes 
it, or wears it, or taints it, or veils it. If the meanings are pure and clean, and the images, 
dirty and base, there is no clothing, but there is contact. The man with scruples confuses 
the contact with being clothed. He exclaims: “Alas! How corrupted my heart has become. 
This  lowness  has  made  me  despicable!”  Satan  takes  advantage  of  this  vein  of  his.  The 
cure for such a wound is as follows: 

Listen,  O  you  unfortunate!  Just  as  outward  cleanliness,  which  is  the  means  to  the 
correct conduct of your prayers, is not affected by the uncleanness of the inside of your 
inner  organs,  and  is  not  spoiled  by  it,  so  the  sacred  meanings  being  close  to  unclean 
forms does not harm them. For example, you are reflecting on some Divine  signs when 
suddenly you feel ill, or an appetite, or a stimulation like a need to pass water. Of course 
your  imagination  will  see  whatever  is  necessary  to  cure the  ill  or  answer  the  need,  and 
will  look at it, weave  lowly  forms appropriate to them, and the  meanings that arise will 
pass  between  them.  But  there  is  no  harm  in  their  passing,  nor  soiling,  nor  error,  nor 
injury. If there is any mistake, it is in paying them attention and imagining the harm. 

THIRD ASPECT 

It  is  this:  there  are  certain  hidden  connections  between  things.  There  are  even  the 
threads of connections between things you least expected. They are either there in fact, or 
your imagination made them according to the art with which it was preoccupied, and tied 
them  together.  It  is  due  to  this  mystery  of  connections  that  sometimes  seeing  a  sacred 
thing  calls  to  mind  a  dirty  thing.  As  stated  in  the  science  of  rhetoric,  “Although 
opposition is the cause of distance in the outer world, it is the cause of proximity in the 
imagination.” That is, an imaginary connection is the means of bringing together the  

 

283 

images of two opposites. The recollection which arises from this connection is called the 
association of ideas.  

For example, while performing the prayers or reciting supplications before the Ka’ba 
in the Divine Presence, this association of ideas takes hold of you and drives you to the 
furthest,  lowest  trivia,  although  you  are  reflecting  on  Qur’anic  verses.  If  your  head  is 
afflicted  with  association  of  ideas  in  this  way,  beware,  do  not  be  alarmed.  Rather,  the 
moment you come to your senses, turn back. Do not say: “I’ve done a great wrong,” and 
keep  playing  with  the  trigger,  lest  through  your  attention,  that  tenuous  connection 
strengthens. For the more you feel regret, the more importance you give it and that faint 
memory  of  yours  becomes  ingrained.  It  becomes  an  imaginary  sickness.  Do  not  be 
frightened, it is not a sickness of the heart. This sort of recollection is mostly involuntary. 
Especially in sensitive, nervous people it is more common. Satan works the mine of this 
sort of scruple a great deal. The cure for this wound is as follows:  

The  association  of  ideas  is  mostly  involuntary.  One  is  not  answerable  for  it.  In 
association there is proximity; there is no touching or intermingling. Therefore the nature 
of the ideas do not pass to one another and do not harm one another. Just as Satan and the 
angel of inspiration being in proximity to one another around the heart, and sinners and 
the pious  being  close to one another  in the same  house cause  no  harm,  so too, if  at the 
prompting  of  the  association  of  ideas,  dirty  imaginings  come  and  enter  among  clean 
thoughts,  they  cause  no  harm.  Unless  it  is  intentional,  or  by  imagining  them  to  be 
harmful, one is over-occupied with them. And sometimes the heart becomes tired, and the 
mind  occupies  itself  with  anything  it  encounters  in  order to  entertain  itself.  Then  Satan 
finds an opportunity, and scatters dirty things before it, and eggs it on. 

FOURTH ASPECT 

This is a scruple arising from searching for the best form of an action. Supposing it 
to be fear of God, the more rigorous it becomes, the more severe the condition becomes 
for  the  person.  It  even  reaches  the  point  that  while  searching  for  even  better  forms  of 
action,  he  deviates  into  what  is  unlawful.  Sometimes  searching  for  a  Sunna  makes  him 
give up what is obligatory. He says: “I wonder if my act was sound?”, and repeats it. This 
state  continues,  and  he  falls  into  terrible  despair.  Satan  takes  advantage  of  this  state  of 
his, and wounds him. There are two cures for such a wound. 

The First Cure:  Scruples like this are worthy of the Mu’tazilites, because they say: 
“Actions  and  things  for  which  a  person  is  responsible  are  either,  of  themselves  and  in 
regard to the hereafter, good, and because of this good they were commanded, or they are 
bad, and because they are bad they were prohibited. That means, from the point of view 
of reality and the  

 

284 

hereafter,  the  good  and  bad  in  things  is  dependent  on  the  things  themselves,  and  the 
Divine command and prohibition follows this.” According to this school of thought, the 
following scruple arises in every action which a person performs: “I wonder if my action 
was performed  in the good way that  in  essence  it  is?”  While the true school, the Sunni 
School, says: “Almighty God orders a thing, then it becomes good. He prohibits a thing, 
then it becomes bad.” That is, goodness becomes existent through command, and badness 
through prohibition. They look to the awareness of the one who performs the action, and 
are established according to that. And this good and bad is not in the apparent face which 
looks to this world, but in the face that looks to the hereafter.  

For example, you performed the prayers or took the ablutions and there was a cause 
that of itself would spoil them, but you were completely unaware of it. Your prayers and 
ablutions,  therefore,  are  both  sound  and  acceptable.  However,  the  Mu’tazilites  say:  “In 
reality  it  was  bad  and  unsound.  But  it  may  be  accepted  from  you  because  you  were 
ignorant  and  did  not  know,  so  you  have  an  excuse.”  Therefore,  according  to the  Sunni 
School, do not say about an action which is conformable with the externals of the Shari’a: 
“I wonder if  it was sound?”; do not have scruples about it. Say: “Was it accepted?”; do 
not become proud and conceited! 

The  Second  Cure:    This  is:  “There  is  no  difficulty  in  religion.”8  Since  the  four 
schools  of  law  are  true;  and  since  realizing  a  fault  which  leads  to  the  seeking  of 
forgiveness  is  preferable  –for  the  person  afflicted  with  scruples–  to  seeing  actions  as 
good, which leads to pride, that is, it is better if such a person sees his action as faulty and 
seeks forgiveness, rather than considering it to be good and falling into pride; since it is 
thus, throw away your scruples and say to Satan: “This state is a difficulty. It is difficult 
to  be  aware  of  the  reality  of  things.  It  is  contrary  to  the  ease  in  religion  expressed  by: 
There  is  no  difficulty  in  religion.  It  is  contrary  to  the  principle,  Religion  is  facility. 
Certainly such an action is conformable with a true school of law. That is enough for me. 
And at least by admitting my inability to perform the worship in a way worthy of it, it is a 
means of taking refuge with Divine compassion through humbly beseeching forgiveness, 
and to meekly supplicating that my faulty actions be accepted. 

FIFTH ASPECT 

In  matters  of  belief,  what  occurs  to  one  in  the  form  of  doubts  are  scruples.  The 
unhappy  man suffering  from scruples  sometimes  confuses conceptions  in  his  mind with 
imaginings.  That  is,  he  imagines  a  doubt  that  has  occurred  to  his  imagination  to  be  a 
doubt that has entered his mind, and supposes that  

                                                

8 Bukhari, i, 16; Ibn Hibban, Sahih, i, 280; Kanz al-‘Ummal, iii, 33, 36, 47; vi, 42, 47. 

 

285 

his beliefs have been damaged. Sometimes he supposes a doubt he has imagined to have 
harmed  his  belief.  Sometimes  he  supposes  a  doubt  he  has  imagined  to  have  been 
confirmed  by  his  reason.  Sometimes  he  supposes  pondering  over  a  matter  related  to 
unbelief  to  be  unbelief.  That  is,  he  supposes  to  be  contrary  to  belief  his  exercising  his 
ability to reflect in the form of understanding the causes of misguidance, and his ability to 
study  and  reason  in  impartial  fashion.  Then,  taking  fright  at  these  suppositions,  which 
result from the whisperings of Satan, he exclaims: “Alas! My heart is corrupted and my 
beliefs  spoiled.”  Since  those  states  are  mostly  involuntary,  and  he  cannot  put  them  to 
rights  through  his  faculty  of  will,  he  falls  into  despair.  The  cure  for  this  wound  is  as 
follows: 

Just as imagining unbelief is not unbelief, neither is fancying unbelief, unbelief. And 
just as imagining misguidance is not misguidance, so too reflecting on misguidance is not 
misguidance.  For  both  imagining,  and  fancying,  and  supposing,  and  reflecting,  are 
different  from  confirmation  with  the  reason  and  submission  of  the  heart, they  are  other 
than them; they are free to an extent; they do not listen to the faculty of will; they are not 
included among the obligations of religion. But affirmation and submission are  not like 
that;  they  are  dependent on  a  balance.  And  just  as  imagining,  fancying,  supposing,  and 
reflecting  are  not  affirmation  or  submission,  so  they  cannot  be  said  to  be  doubt  or 
hesitation. But if they are repeated unnecessarily  and become established, then a sort of 
real  doubt  may  be  born  of  them.  Also,  continually  taking  the  part  of  the  opposing  side 
calling it unbiased reasoning or being fair reaches the point that the person involuntarily 
favours the opposing side. His taking the part of the truth, which is incumbent on him, is 
destroyed. He too falls into danger. A state of mind becomes fixed in his head whereby 
he becomes an officious representative of Satan or the enemy. 

The  most  important  of  this  sort  of  scruple  is  this:  the  person  suffering  from  it 
confuses something that is actually possible with something which is reasonably possible. 
That is, if he sees something which is of itself possible, he imagines it to be reasonably 
possible  and  reasonably  doubtful.  Whereas  one  of  the  principles  of  theology  (kalam)  is 
that something which  is of  itself possible  is  not opposed to certain knowledge and does 
not contradict the demands of reason. For example, the Black Sea sinking into the earth at 
this moment is of itself possible, but we judge with certainty that the sea is in its place, 
and  we  know  this  without  doubting  it,  and  that  possibility  which  is  actually  possible 
causes  us  no  doubt  and  does  not  damage  our  certainty.  And,  for  example,  of  itself  it  is 
possible  that  the  sun  will  not  set  today  or  that  it  will  not  rise  tomorrow.  But  this 
possibility  in  no  way  damages  our  certainty  that it  will  rise  and  gives  rise  to  no  doubt. 
Similarly, unfounded suspicions arising from possibilities of this sort about, for example, 
the setting of  

 

286 

the life of this world and rising of the life of the hereafter, which are among the truths of 
belief,  cause  no  harm  to  the  certainty  of  belief.  Furthermore,  the  well-known  rule,  A 
possibility that does not arise  from any proof or evidence  is of  no  importance  is one of 
the  established  principles  of  both  the  sciences  of  the  principles  of  religion  and  the 
principles of jurisprudence (fiqh). 

If you say: “What is the wisdom and purpose in scruples being visited on us, which 

are thus harmful and an affliction for believers?” 

The  Answer:    On  condition  they  do  not  lead  to  excess  or  overwhelm  a  person, 
essentially scruples are the cause of vigilance, lead to seeking the best way, and give rise 
to seriousness. They banish indifference and repulse carelessness. Therefore, in this realm 
of examination and arena of competition, the Absolutely Wise One put them in the hand 
of  Satan  as  a  whip  of  encouragement  for  us.  He  strikes  it  at  our  heads.  If  it  hurts 
excessively, one must complain to the All-Wise and Compassionate One, and say: “I seek 
refuge with God from Satan the Accursed.”

The Twenty-Second Word 

[This Word consists of Two Stations] 

First Station 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
So  God  sets  forth  parables  for  men,  so  that  they  may  bear  [them]  in  mind.1  * 
Such are the similitudes which we propound to men that they may reflect.2 

One time two men were washing in a pool. Under some extraordinary influence they 
lost their senses and when they opened their eyes, they saw that it had transported them to 
a  strange  land.  It  was  such  that  with  its  perfect  order  it  was  like  a  country,  or  rather  a 
town,  or  a  palace.  They  looked  around  themselves  in  complete  bewilderment:  if  it  was 
looked at  in one way, a  vast world was apparent;  if  in  another, a well-ordered country; 
and if in another, a fine town. And if it was looked at in still another way, it was a palace 
which  comprised  a  truly  magnificent  world.  Travelling  around  this  strange  world,  they 
observed it and saw that creatures of one sort were speaking in a fashion, but they did not 
understand  their  language.  Nevertheless,  it  was  understood  from  their  signs  that  they 
were performing important works and duties. 

One  of  the  two  men  said  to  his  friend:  “This  strange  world  must  have  someone  to 
regulate it, and this orderly country must have a lord, and this fine town, an owner, and 
this finely made palace, a master builder. We must try to know him, for it is understood 
that the one who brought us here was he. If we do not recognize him, who will help us? 
What can we await  from these  impotent creatures whose  language we do not know and 
who  do  not  heed  us?  Moreover,  surely  one  who  makes  a  vast  world  in  the  form  of  a 
country,  town,  and  palace,  and  fills  it  from  top  to  bottom  with  wonderful  things,  and 
embellishes it with every sort of adornment, and decks it out  

                                                

1 Qur’an, 14:25. 
2 Qur’an, 59:21. 

 

288 

with  instructive  miracles  wants  something  from  us  and  from  those  that  come  here.  We 
must get to know him and find out what he wants.” 

The other man said:  “I do not believe  it, that there  is a person  such as the one  you 

speak of, and that he governs this whole world on his own.” 

His  friend  replied  to  him:  “If  we  do  not  recognize  him  and  remain  indifferent 
towards  him,  there  is  no  advantage  in  it  at  all,  and  if  it  is  harmful,  its  harm  will  be 
immense.  Whereas  if  we  try  to  recognize  him,  there  is  little  hardship  involved,  and  if 
there is benefit, it will be great. Therefore, it is in no way sensible to remain indifferent 
towards him.” 

The foolish man said: “I consider all my ease and enjoyment to lie in not thinking of 
him. Also, I am not going to bother with things that make no sense to me. All these things 
are the confused objects of chance, they are happening by themselves. What is it to me?” 
His  intelligent  friend  replied:  “This  obstinacy  of  yours  will  push  me,  and  a  lot  of 
others, into disaster. It sometimes happens that a whole country is laid waste because of 
one ill-mannered person.” 

So the foolish  man turned to him  and said:  “Either prove to me decisively that this 

large country has a single lord and single maker, or leave me alone.” 

His friend replied: “Your obstinacy has reached the degree of lunacy, and you will be 
the  cause  of  some  disaster  being  visited  on  us.  So  I  shall  show  you  twelve  proofs 
demonstrating that this world which is like a palace, and country which is like town, has a 
single maker and that it is only he who runs and administers everything. He is completely 
free of all deficiency. This maker, who does not appear to us, sees us and everything, and 
hears our words. All  his works are  miracles and  marvels.  All these creatures whom we 
see but whose tongues we do not understand are his officials.” 

FIRST PROOF 

Come and look carefully at everything around you: a hidden hand is working within 
all these works. For something which  has  not even an ounce of strength,3 something as 
small  as  a  seed,  is  raising  a  load  of  thousands  of  pounds.  And  something  that  does  not 
have  even  a  particle  of  consciousness4  is  performing  extremely  wise  and  purposeful 
works. That  means  they  are  not  working  by  themselves,  but that  a  hidden  possessor  of 
power  is  causing  them  to  work.  If  they  were  independent,  it  would  necessitate  all  the 
works  which  we  see  everywhere  in  this  land  being  miracles  and  everything  to  be  a 
wonder-working marvel. And that is nonsense. 

                                                

3 This alludes to seeds, which bear trees on their heads. 
4 This indicates delicate plants like the grapevine, which themselves cannot climb or bear the weight of 

fruits, so throwing their delicate arms around other plants or trees and winding themselves around them, 
they load themselves onto them. 

 

289 

SECOND PROOF 

Come, look carefully at the things which adorn all these plains, fields, and dwellings! 
There are marks on each telling of that hidden one. Simply, each gives news of Him like 
a  seal  or  stamp.  Look  in  front  of  your  eyes:  what  does  He  make  from  one  ounce  of 
cotton?5 See how many rolls of cloth, fine linen, and flowered material have come out of 
it.  See  how  many  sugared  delights  and  round  sweets  are  being  made.  If  thousands  of 
people  like  us  were  to  clothe  themselves  in  them  and  eat  them,  they  would  still  be 
sufficient. And look! He has taken a handful of iron, water, earth, coal, copper, silver, and 
gold,  and  made  some  flesh6  out  of  them.  Look  at  that  and  see!  O  foolish  one!  These 
works are particular to such a one that all this land together with all its parts is under his 
miraculous power and is submissive to his every wish. 

THIRD PROOF 

Come,  look  at these  mobile  works  of  art!7  Each  has  been  fashioned  in  such  a  way 
that it is simply a miniature sample of the huge palace. Whatever there is in the palace, it 
is  found  in these tiny  mobile  machines. Is  it at all possible that someone other than the 
palace’s maker could come and include the wondrous palace in a tiny machine? Also, is it 
at all possible that although he has included a whole world in a machine the size of a box, 
there could be anything in it that was purposeless or could be attributed to chance? That 
means that however many skilfully fashioned machines you can see, each is like a seal of 
that hidden one. Rather, each  is  like a herald or proclamation. Through their tongues of 
disposition they are saying:  “We  are the  art of One  Who can  make this entire  world of 
ours as easily and simply as He created us.” 

FOURTH PROOF 

O my stubborn friend! Come, I shall show you something even stranger. Look! All 
these works and things in this land have changed and are changing. They do not stop in 
any  one  state.  Note  carefully  that  each  of  these  lifeless  bodies  and  unfeeling  boxes  has 
taken on the form of being absolutely dominant. Quite simply it is as though each rules 
all the others. Look at this  

                                                

5 This indicates a seed. For example, a poppy seed like an  atom, the kernel of an apricot stone, and a 
tiny melon seed, produce from the treasury of mercy woven leaves finer than broadcloth, flowers whiter 
than linen, and fruits sweeter than sugar and more delicate and delicious than sweets and conserves, and 
they offer them to us. 

6 This indicates the creation of animal bodies from the elements, and living creatures from sperm. 
7 This alludes to animals and humans. For since animals are tiny indexes of the world, and man is a 

miniature sample of the universe, whatever there is in the world, a sample of it is in man. 

 

290 

machine next to us;8 it is as though issuing commands; all the necessities and substances 
necessary  for  its  adornment  and  functioning  come  hastening  to  it  from  distant  places. 
Look over there: that lifeless  body9  is as though  beckoning;  it  makes the  largest bodies 
serve it and work in its own workplace. Make further analogies in the same way.  

Simply,  everything  subjugates  to  itself  all  the  beings  in  this  world.  If  you  do  not 
accept  the  existence  of  that  hidden  one,  you  have  to  attribute  all  his  skills,  arts,  and 
perfections in the stones, earth, animals, and creatures resembling man everywhere in this 
land  to  the  things  themselves.  In  place  of  a  single  wonder-working  being,  which  your 
mind deems unlikely, you have to accept millions like him, who are both opposed to one 
another, and similar, and one within the other, so they do not cause confusion everywhere 
and  the  order  be  spoiled.  Whereas  if  two  fingers  meddle  in  a  country,  they  cause 
confusion. For if there are two headmen in a village, or two governors in a town, or two 
kings in a country, the result is chaos. So what about an infinite, absolute ruler? 

FIFTH PROOF 

O  my  sceptical  friend!  Come,  look  carefully  at  the  inscriptions  of  this  vast  palace, 
look at all the adornments of the town, see the ordering of this whole land, and reflect on 
all the works of art in this world! See! If these inscriptions are not worked by the pen of 
one hidden who possesses  infinite  miracles and skills, and are attributed to unconscious 
causes, to blind chance and deaf nature, then every stone and every plant in this land has 
to be an inscriber so wondrous it can write a thousand books in every letter and include 
millions of works of art in a single  inscription. Because  look at the  inscription on these 
stones;10 in each are the inscriptions of all the palace, and the laws ordering all the town, 
and the programmes for organizing the whole country. That means that it is as wonderful 
to  make  these  inscriptions  as  to  make  the  whole  country.  In  which  case,  all  the 
inscriptions, all the works of art, are proclamations of that hidden one, and seals of his. 

                                                

8 The machine indicates fruit-bearing trees. For they bear on their slender branches hundreds of 
workbenches and factories, and weave, adorn, and cook wonderful leaves, flowers and fruits, and stretch 
them out to us. And majestic trees like the pine and the cedar, even, set up their workbenches on dry rock, 
and work. 

9 This alludes to grains, seeds, and the eggs of flies. For example, a fly leaves its eggs on the leaves of 
the elm. Suddenly the huge tree turns its leaves into a mother’s womb and a cradle for the eggs, and into a 
store full of a food like honey. Simply, in that way the tree, which is not fruit-producing, produces fruits 
bearing spirits. 

10 This alludes to man, the fruit of the tree of creation, and to the fruit which bears its tree’s programme 

and index. For whatever the pen of power has written in the great book of the universe, it has written its 
summary in man’s nature. And whatever the pen of Divine Determining has written in a tree the size of a 
mountain, it has also included it in its fruit the size of a finger nail. 

 

291 

Since  a  letter  cannot  exist  without  showing  the  one  who  wrote  it,  and  an  artistic 
inscription  cannot  exist  without  making  known  its  inscriber,  how  is  it  that  an  inscriber 
who writes a huge book in a single letter and inscribes a thousand inscriptions in a single 
inscription, should not be known through his writing and through his inscribing? 

SIXTH PROOF 

Come, let us go out onto this broad plain.11 On it is a high mountain whose summit 
we shall climb to so that we can see all the surrounding country. We shall take with us a 
good  pair  of  binoculars  which  will  bring  everything  close,  for  strange  things  are 
happening  in  this  strange  land.  Every  hour  things  are  taking  place  that  we  could  not 
imagine. Look! These mountains, plains, and towns are suddenly changing. And how? In 
such  a  way  that  millions  of  things  are  being  changed  in  a  most  regulated  and  orderly 
fashion one within the other. Truly wondrous transformations are being wrought, just as 
though  millions  of  various  cloths  are  being  woven  one  within  the  other.  Look!  These 
flowery  things  which  we  know  and  are  familiar  with  are  disappearing  and  others  have 
come in their place in orderly fashion which resemble them in nature but are different in 
form. It is quite simply as though this plain and the mountains are each a page, and within 
them  are  being  written  hundreds  of  thousands  of  different  books.  And  they  are  being 
written faultlessly and without defect. 

It is impossible a hundred times over that these matters should have come about on 
their own. Yes, for these works which are skilfully and carefully fashioned to an infinite 
degree  to  have  occurred  on  their  own  is  impossible  a  thousand  times,  for  rather  than 
themselves,  they  show  the  artist  who  fashioned  them.  Moreover,  the  one  who  did  this 
displays such miracles that nothing at all could be difficult for him. It is as easy for him 
to  write  a  thousand  books  as  to  write  one  book.  Look  all  around  you;  he  both  puts 
everything  in  its  proper  place  with  perfect  wisdom,  and  he  munificently  showers  the 
favours on everyone of which they are worthy, and he draws back and opens general veils 
and  doors  so  bountifully  that  everyone’s  desires  are  satisfied.  And  he  sets  up  tables  so 
generously that a feast of bounties is given to all the people and animals of this land; each 
group and individual is given one particular and suitable for it, even. So, is there anything 
more impossible in the world than that there should be anything attributable to chance in 
these matters that we see, or that among these matters that we see there is anything  

                                                

11 This indicates the face of  the earth in the spring and summer. For the groups of hundreds of 
thousands of different creatures are created one within the other and written there. They are changed 
without fault or error and with perfect order. Thousands of tables of the Most Merciful One are laid out, 
then removed and replaced by fresh ones. All the trees as though bear trays, all the gardens are like 
cauldrons. 

 

292 

purposeless or vain, or that many hands should be interfering in them, or that their maker 
should not be capable of everything, or that everything should not be subjugated to him? 
And so, my friend, find a pretext in the face of these if you can! 

SEVENTH PROOF 

Come, my friend! Now we shall leave these particular matters and turn our attention 
to the mutual positions of the parts of this wondrous world in the form of a palace. Look! 
Universal works are being carried out and general revolutions are occurring in this world 
with  such  order  that  all  the  rocks,  earth,  trees,  everything  in  this  palace,  observe  the 
universal  systems  of  the  world,  and  conform  to  them  as  if  each  was  acting  with  will. 
Things which are distant hasten to assist one another. Now look, a strange caravan12 has 
appeared,  coming  from  the  Unseen.  The  mounts  in  it  resemble  trees,  plants,  and 
mountains. Each  bears a tray of provisions on  its head.  And  look, they are  bringing the 
provisions  for  the  various  animals  awaiting  them  on  this  side.  And  see,  the  mighty 
electric lamp13  in that dome both furnishes them with light, and cooks all their food so 
well  that  the  foods to  be  cooked  are  each  attached  to  a  string14  by  an  unseen  hand  and 
held  up  before  it.  And  on  this  side,  see  these  wretched,  weak,  powerless  little  animals; 
how  before  their  heads  are  attached  two  small  pumps15  full  of  delicate  sustenance,  like 
two springs; it is enough for those powerless creatures to only press their mouths against 
them. 

In  Short:    Just  as  all  the  things  throughout the  world  look  to one  another,  so they 
help one another. And just as they see one another, so they co-operate with one another. 
And  just  as  they  perfect  each  other’s  works,  so  too  they  support  one  another;  standing 
shoulder to shoulder, they  work together. Make analogies with this  for everything; they 
are uncountable. Thus, all these things demonstrate as decisively as two plus two equals 
four  that  everything  is  subjugated  to  the  maker  of  this  wondrous  palace,  that  is,  to  the 
owner of this strange world. Everything is like a soldier under his command. Everything 
turns  through  his  strength.  Everything  acts  through  his  command.  Everything  is  set  in 
order  through  his  wisdom.  Everything  helps  the  others  through  his  munificence. 
Everything hastens to the assistance of the others through his compassion, that is, they are 
made to hasten to it. Now, my friend, say something in the face of this if you can! 

                                                

12 These are the caravans of plants and trees, which bear the sustenance of all the animals. 
13 The mighty electric lamp indicates the sun. 
14 And the string, and the food attached to it, are the slender branches of trees and their delicious fruits. 
15 And the two small pumps allude to the breasts of mothers. 

 

293 

EIGHTH PROOF 

Come,  my  foolish  friend  who  thinks  himself  reasonable  like  my  soul!  You  do  not 
want to recognize the owner of this magnificent palace! But everything shows him, points 
to him, testifies to him. How can  you deny the testimony of all these things? You have 
therefore  to  deny  the  palace  as  well,  and  say:  “There  is  no  world,  no  country.”  Deny 
yourself, too, and disappear! Or else come to your senses and  listen to  me! Now,  look, 
there are uniform elements and  minerals  inside the palace and encompassing the  land.16 
Simply,  everything  appearing  in  the  country  is  made  of  those  elements.  That  means, 
whoever those things belong to, everything made of them is also his. Whoever the field 
belongs to, the crops are his too. And whoever the sea belongs to, the things within it are 
also his.  

And  look, these  textiles,  these  decorated  woven  materials,  are  being  made  out of  a 
single substance. It is self-evidently the same person who brings the substance, prepares 
it, and makes it into string. For such a work would not permit the participation of others. 
In which case, all the woven, skilfully made things are particular to him.  

And look! Every sort of these woven, manufactured goods is found in every part of 
the  country;  they  have  spread  with  all  their  fellows,  and  are  being  made  and  woven 
together and one within the other, in the same way, at the same instant. That means they 
are the work of the same person and the same act through a single command, otherwise 
their correspondence and conformity at the same instant, in the same fashion, of the same 
sort, would be impossible. In which case, each of these skilfully fashioned things is like a 
proclamation of that hidden one which points to him. As if each sort of flowered material, 
each  ingenious  machine,  each  sweet  mouthful,  is  a  stamp  of  that  miracle-displaying 
person; a stamp of his, a mark, a decoration; each says through the tongue of disposition: 
“Whose-ever  work  of  art  I  am,  the  boxes  and  shops  where  I  am  found  are  also  his 
property.” Each inscription says: “Whoever wove me also wove the roll of cloth of which 
I  am  a  part.”  Every  sweet  mouthful  says:  “Whoever  makes  me  and  cooks  me,  the 
cauldron in which I am is also his.” And every machine says: “Whoever made me, also 
makes all those like me who have spread throughout the land, and the one who raises us 
in every part of it, is also he. That means he is also the country’s owner. In which case, 
whoever the owner of all this country and palace is, he may be our owner too.”  
For example, in order to be the true owner of a single cartridge-belt or  

                                                

16 As for the elements and minerals, these indicate the elements of air, water, light, and earth, which 
have numerous well-ordered duties; they hasten to the assistance of all needy beings with dominical leave, 
enter everywhere and bring help at the Divine command, and raise all the things necessary for life and 
suckle living creatures, and are the source of the weaving and inscribing of the Divine artefacts, and their 
progenitors and cradles. 

 

294 

even a button belonging to the government, one also has to own all the factories in which 
they are made. If a bragging irregular soldier claims otherwise, he will be told: “They are 
government property.” And they will be taken from him, and he will be punished. 

In  Short:    Just  as  the  elements  in  this  country  all  surround  and  encompass  it,  and 
their  owner  can  only  be  one  who  owns  the  whole  country,  in  the  same  way,  since  the 
works  of  art  that  are  spread  throughout  it  resemble  one  another  and  display  a  single 
stamp, they show that they are the art of a single person who governs everything. 

And so, my friend! There is a sign of oneness, a stamp of unity, in this country, that 
is, this magnificent palace. For while being the same, certain things are all-encompassing. 
And while  being  numerous, some display a unity or similarity, since they resemble one 
another and are found everywhere. As for unity, it shows One of Unity. That means that 
its  maker,  owner,  lord,  and  fashioner  has  to  be  one  and  the  same.  In  addition,  look 
carefully at this: from behind the veil of the unseen a thickish string has appeared.17 Now 
look,  thousands  of  strings  have  hung  down  from  it.  And  see  the  tips  of  the  strings:  a 
diamond,  a  decoration,  a  favour,  a  gift  has  been  attached  to  each.  Suitable  presents  are 
being  given  to  everyone.  Do  you  know  what  a  lunatic  action  it  is  not  to  recognize  or 
thank  the  one  who  stretches  out  from  behind  the  strange  veil  of  the  unseen  such 
wondrous favours and gifts. Because if you do not recognize him, you will be compelled 
to say:  “These  strings are  making the diamonds  and other gifts on their tips themselves 
and  offering  them.”  Then  you  have  to  attribute  to  each  string  the  meaning  of  a  king. 
Whereas before our eyes an unseen hand is making the strings too, and attaching the gifts 
to them. That means, everything in this palace points to that miracle-displaying one rather 
than  to  themselves.  If  you  do  not  recognize  him,  through  denying  them,  you  fall  a 
hundred times lower than an animal. 

NINTH PROOF 

Come, my unreasoning friend! You do not recognize this palace’s owner, and you do 
not  want  to  recognize  him  because  you  deem  his  existence  unlikely.  You  deviate  into 
denial  because  you  cannot  comprehend  with  your  narrow  brain  his  wondrous  arts  and 
acts. Whereas the true unlikelihood, real difficulties, hardships, and awesome trouble lie 
in not recognizing him. For if we recognize him, this whole palace, this world, becomes 
as  easy,  as  trouble-free  as  a  single  thing;  it  becomes  the  means  to  the  abundance  and 
plenty  around  us.  If  we  do  not  recognize  him  and  he  does  not  exist,  then  everything 
becomes as difficult as this whole palace, because everything is as skilfully  

                                                

17 The thickish string alludes to fruit-bearing trees, the thousands of strings, to their branch-es, and the 

diamonds, decorations, favours, and gifts, to the varieties of blossoms and fruits. 

 

295 

made as the palace. Then neither the abundance nor the plenty would remain. Indeed, not 
one of these things which we see would pass to anyone’s  hand,  let alone ours. Look at 
just  the  jar  of  conserve  attached  to this  string.18  If  it  had  not  emerged  from  his  hidden, 
miracle-displaying kitchen, we could not have bought it for a hundred liras, although we 
buy it now for forty para.19 

Yes,  all  unlikelihood,  difficulty,  trouble,  arduousness,  indeed,  impossibility,  lies  in 
not  recognizing  him.  For  a  tree  is  given  life  from  one  root,  through  one  law,  in  one 
centre,  and  the  formation  of  thousands  of  fruits  is  as  easy  as  one  fruit.  But  if  the  fruits 
were tied to different centres and roots, and different laws, each fruit would be as difficult 
to produce as the tree. And  if the equipping of an entire army  is  in one centre, through 
one  law,  and  from  one  factory,  as  regards  quantity  it  is  as  easy  as  equipping  a  single 
soldier.  While  if  each  soldier  is  equipped  from  all  different  places,  then  to  equip  one 
soldier there would have to be as many factories as for the entire army. 

Just  like  these  two  examples,  if,  in  this  well-ordered  palace,  this  fine  town,  this 
advanced  country,  this  magnificent  world,  the  creation  of  all  things  is  attributed  to  a 
single  being,  it  becomes  so  easy,  so  light,  it  is  the  reason  for  the  infinite  abundance, 
availability, and munificence we see. Otherwise everything would become so expensive, 
so difficult, that if the whole world was given to someone, they could not obtain them. 

TENTH PROOF 

Come,  my  friend,  who  has  come  a  little  to  his  senses!  We  have  been  here  fifteen 
days20 now. If we do not know the regulations of this world and do not recognize its king, 
we  shall  deserve  punishment.  We  have  no  excuse,  because  for  fifteen  days,  as  though 
given a respite, they did not interfere with us. Of course we have not just been left to our 
own  devices.  We  cannot  wander  around  among  these  delicate,  well-balanced,  subtle, 
skilfully  made  and  instructive  creatures  like  an  animal  and  spoil  them;  they  would  not 
permit  us  to  harm  them.  The  penalties  of  this  country’s  august  king  are  bound  to  be 
awesome. You can understand how powerful and majestic he is from the way he orders 
this  huge  world  as  though  it  was  a  palace,  and  makes  it  revolve  like  a  machine.  He 
administers this large country like a house, missing nothing. See, like filling a container 
and  emptying  it,  he  continuously  fills  this  palace,  this  country,  this  town,  with  perfect 
order,  and  empties  it  with  perfect  wisdom.  Like  spreading  out  a  table  then  clearing  it 
away, varieties of foods are brought in turn and given to eat in the form of a great  

                                                

18 The jar of conserve indicates the gifts of Divine mercy like melons, water melons, pomegranates, 

and coconuts, which are the conserves of Divine power, and like tins of milk. 

19 1 Para = 1/40th of a kurush; 100 kurush = 1 lira. 
20 Fifteen days indicates the age of fifteen, the age of discretion. (See, Bukhari, iii, 232.)

variety of tables21 being laid out by an unseen hand in every part of his vast country, and 
then  being  cleared  away.  The  unseen  hand  clears  away  one,  then  brings  another  in  its 
place.  You  see  this  too,  and  if  you  use  your  head,  you  will  understand  that  within  that 
awesome majesty is an infinitely munificent liberality.  

And see, just as all these things testify to that unseen one’s sovereignty and unity, so 
too  these  revolutions  and  changes  which  pass  on  in  succession  like  caravans  and  are 
opened and closed from behind that true veil, testify to his continuance and permanence. 
For  the  causes  of  things  disappear  along  with  them.  Whereas  the  things  which  we 
attribute to them, which follow on after them, are repeated. That means those works are 
not theirs, but the works of one who does not perish. It is understood from the the bubbles 
on the surface of a river disappearing  and the bubbles which succeed them  sparkling  in 
the same way that what makes them sparkle is a constant and elevated possessor of light. 
Similarly,  the  speedy  changing  of  things  and  the  things  that  follow  on  after  them 
assuming the same colours shows that they are the  manifestations,  inscriptions,  mirrors, 
and works of art of one who is perpetual, undying, and single. 

ELEVENTH PROOF 

Come,  my  friend!  Now  I  shall  show  you  a  decisive  proof  as  powerful  as  the  ten 
previous ones. We shall board a boat,22 and sail to a peninsula, far away. For the key to 
this riddle-filled world will be there. Moreover, everyone is looking to that peninsula and 
awaiting something from it; they are receiving orders from there. See, we are going there. 
Now  we  have  arrived  and  have  alighted  on  the  peninsula.  There  is  a  vast  gathering,  a 
great  concourse,  as though  all  the  important  people  of  the  country  have  gathered  there. 
Look carefully, this great community has a leader. Come, we shall draw closer; we must 
become  acquainted  with  him.  Look!  What  brilliant  decorations  he  has,  more  than  a 
thousand  of  them.23  How  powerfully  he  speaks!  How  pleasant  is  his  conversation!  In 
these two weeks I have learnt a little of what he says. You learn them from me. See, he is 
speaking  of  this  country’s  miracle-displaying  king.  He  is  saying  that  the  glorious  king 
sent him to us.  

                                                

21 The tables indicate the face of the earth in summer, during which hundreds of tables of the Most 
Merciful emerge fresh and different from the kitchens of mercy. Every garden is a cauldron, every tree, a 
tray-bearer. 

22 The ship indicates history, and the peninsula, the Era of Bliss or Age of the Prophet (PBUH). 
Through casting off the dress of this low civilization on its dark shore, entering the seas of time, boarding 
the ship of history and alighting at the Arabian Peninsula and Era of Bliss, and visiting the Glory of the 
World (PBUH) at his duties, we know that he is a proof of Divine Unity so brilliant that he illuminates the 
entire globe and the two faces of the past and the future, and disperses the darkness of unbelief and 
misguidance. 

23 The thousand decorations are the miracles of Muhammad (PBUH), which according to those who 

have investigated them, reach nearly a thousand. (Bayhaqi, Dala’il, i, 10.) 

 

297 

And he is displaying such wonders that they leave no doubt that he is his special envoy. 
Look carefully, it is not only the creatures on this peninsula that are listening to what he 
says;  he  is  making  the  whole  country  hear  in  wondrous  fashion.  For  near  and  far 
everyone  is  trying  to  hear  the  speech  here.  It  is  not  only  humans  that  are  listening, 
animals  are  listening  too.  Look,  even  the  mountains  are  listening  to  the  commands  he 
brought so that they are stirring in their places, and the trees, too, move to the place that 
he indicates. He brings forth water from wherever he wishes. He even makes his fingers 
like a Spring of Kawthar, and gives to drink from them. Look, at his sign, an important 
lamp24 in the dome of this palace splits into two. That means this country together with 
all  its  beings  recognizes  that  he  is  an  official  and  envoy.  They  heed  and  obey  him,  as 
though knowing that he is the most eminent and true interpreter of an unseen displayer of 
miracles,  and  the  herald  of  his  dominicality,  the  discloser  of  his  talisman,  and  a 
trustworthy  envoy  delivering  his  commands.  All  those  with  intelligence  around  him 
declare:  “Yes,  that  is  right!”  about  everything  he  says,  and  affirm  it.  Indeed,  through 
submitting  to  his  signs  and  commands,  the  mountains  and  trees  in  this  country  and  the 
huge light25 that illuminates it, say: “Yes, yes, everything you say is true!” 

My  foolish  friend!  Could  there  be  any  contradiction  or  deception  concerning  the 
miracle-displaying king about whom this most luminous, magnificent, and serious being, 
who bears a thousand decorations particular to the king’s own treasury, is speaking with 
all  his  strength,  confirmed  by  all  the  country’s  notables,  and  concerning  the  king’s 
attributes  which  he  mentions,  and  the  commands  which  he  relays?  If  there  is  anything 
contrary to the truth in these things, it will be necessary to deny this palace, these lamps, 
this  community,  both  their  reality  and  their  existence.  If  you  can,  raise  any  objections 
against these; but you will see that they will be smashed by the power of the proof, and 
flung back at you. 

TWELFTH PROOF 

Come,  my  brother,  who  has  come  to  his  senses  a  little!  I  shall  show  you  a  further 
proof  of  the  strength  of  all  the  eleven  preceding  proofs.  See  this  luminous  Decree,26 
which descends from above and which everyone looks  

                                                

24 The important lamp is the moon, which split into two halves at his indication. That is, as Mawlana 
Jami said: “With the pen of his finger, that unlettered one who knew no writing, wrote an alif on the page 
of the skies and made one forty, two fifties.” That is, before it split, the moon resembled m(cid:0)m, the value of 
which is forty; and after splitting it became two crescents, and resembled two nu\ns, the value of which is 
fifty. 

25 The huge light is the sun; when it reappeared from the East on the earth’s revolving backwards, 
Imam ‘Ali (May God be pleased with him), who had been unable to perform the prayers since the Prophet 
(PBUH) was sleeping in his arms, due to this miracle, was able to perform the prayers on time. (See, Qadi 
Iyad, al-Shifa’, i, 240; Suyuti, al-Khasa’is al-Kubra, ii, 342.) 

26 The luminous Decree refers to the Qur’an, and the seal on it, to its miraculousness. 

 

298 

on  in  rapt  attention  out  of  either  wonder  or  veneration.  The  one  with  the  thousand 
decorations has stopped by it and is explaining its meaning to everyone. The styles of the 
Decree  so  shine  they  attract  everyone’s  appreciative  gaze,  and  it  speaks  of  matters  so 
important and serious that everyone is compelled to give ear to them. For it describes all 
the qualities, acts, commands, and attributes of the one who governs this whole land, who 
made  this  palace,  and  exhibits  these  wonders.  Just  as  there  is  a  mighty  stamp  on  the 
Decree as a whole, look! there is an inimitable seal on every line and every sentence, and, 
moreover, the meanings, truths, commands, and instances of wisdom it states are seen to 
be in a style particular to him, thus bearing the meaning of a stamp. 

In  Short:  The  Supreme  Decree  shows  the  Supreme  Being  as  clearly  as  the  sun,  so 

that anyone who is not blind can see it. 

My  friend!  If  you  have  come  to  your  senses,  this  is  enough  for  now.  If  you  have 

something to say, say it.  

In  reply,  the  obstinate  man  said:  “I  can  only  say  this  in  the  face  of  these  proofs  of 
yours: All praise be to God for I have come to believe. And I believe in a way bright as 
the sun and clear as daylight that this country has a single King of Perfection, this world, 
a  Single  Glorious  Owner,  this  palace,  a  Single  Beauteous  Maker.  May  God  be  pleased 
with you, for you have saved me from my former obstinacy and foolishness. Each of the 
proofs  you  showed  was  sufficient  to  demonstrate  the  truth.  But  because  with  each 
successive  proof,  clearer,  pleasanter,  more  agreeable,  more  luminous,  finer  levels  of 
knowledge, veils in acquaintanceship, and windows of love were opened and revealed, I 
waited and listened.” 

The story in the form of a comparison indicating the mighty truth of Divine unity and 
belief  in  God  has  reached  its  conclusion.  Through  the  grace  of  the  Most  Merciful,  the 
effulgence  of  the  Qur’an,  and  the  light of  belief,  we  shall  now  set out twelve  ‘Flashes’ 
and an Introduction from the sun of true Divine unity corresponding to the twelve proofs 
in the story. 

Success and Guidance are from God alone.

The Second Station 
of the Twenty-Second Word 

Introduction 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
God  is  the  Creator  of  all  things,  and  He  is  the  Guardian  and  Disposer  of  all 
affairs. * To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth.27 * So glory to 
Him in Whose hands is the sovereignty of all things, and to Him will you all be 
brought  back.28  *  And  there  is  not  a  thing  but  its  [sources  and]  treasures 
[inexhaustible]  are  with  Us;  but  We  only  send  down  thereof  in  due  and 
ascertainable measures.29 * There is not a moving creature, but He has grasp of 
its forelock. Verily it is my Sustainer that is on a Straight Path.30 

 
In my treatise entitled Katre, which is about belief in God, the principal pole of the 
pillars of belief, I explained in brief the evidence to Almighty God’s existence and unity 
given  by  all  beings  through  fifty-five  tongues.  Also,  in  the  treatise  Nokta,  I  mentioned 
four universal proofs out of the evidences of Almighty God’s existence and unity each of 
which has the strength of a thousand proofs. Moreover, since I have discussed in around 
twelve of my Arabic treatises hundreds of decisive proofs demonstrating Almighty God’s 
necessary existence and unity, I shall  be  content with those and  not now undertake any 
profound investigations. Only, I shall try to explain in this Twenty-Second Word, twelve 
‘Flashes’ from the sun of belief in God which I have written briefly in other places in the 
Risale-i Nur. 

FIRST FLASH 

The affirmation of Divine unity  is of two sorts. For example,  if the goods of a rich 

man arrive in a market or a town, there are two ways in which one  

                                                

27 Qur’an, 39:62. 
28 Qur’an, 36:83. 
29 Qur’an, 15:21. 
30 Qur’an, 11:56. 

 

300 

may know they are his. One is briefly and simply, as with ordinary people, which is: “No 
one apart from him is capable of owning this vast amount of goods.” But when under the 
supervision of a common man such as that, much of it may be stolen. Many others may 
claim  ownership  of  parts  of  it.  The  second  sort  is  this:  through  reading  his  writing  on 
every packet, recognizing his signature on every roll, and seeing his seal on every bill, the 
man declares: “Everything belongs to that person.” Here, everything in effect shows the 
important man. Similarly, the affirmation of Divine unity is of two sorts: 

One  is  the  superficial  and  common  affirmation  of  Divine  unity  which  says: 

“Almighty God is One, He has no partner or like. This universe is His.” 

The  Second  is  the  true  affirmation  of  Divine  unity  which,  through  seeing  on 
everything the stamp of His power, the seal of His dominicality, and the  inscriptions of 
His pen, is to open a window directly onto His light from everything and to confirm and 
believe  with  almost the  certainty  of  seeing  it  that  everything  emerges  from  the  hand  of 
His power and that in no way has He any partner or assistant  in His Godhead or in His 
dominicality or in His sovereignty, and thus to attain to a sort of perpetual awareness of 
the  Divine  presence.  In  this  Word,  we  shall  mention  rays  demonstrating  this  pure  and 
elevated true affirmation of Divine unity. 

A Reminder within the First Point:  O heedless worshipper of causes! Causes are a 
veil;  for  Divine  dignity  and  grandeur  require  them  to  be  thus.  But  that  which  acts  and 
performs matters is the power of the Eternally Besought One; for Divine unity and glory 
require it to be thus, and necessitate their independence. The officials of the Pre-Eternal 
Monarch are not executives of the sovereignty of dominicality, they are the heralds of His 
sovereignty and the observers and superintendents of His dominicality. Their purpose is 
to make known the dignity of power and  majesty of dominicality,  so that power should 
not be seen to be associated with base and lowly matters. Not like a human king, tainted 
by  impotence  and  indigence,  who  therefore  takes  officials  as  partners.  That  is  to  say, 
causes have been placed so that the dignity of power may be preserved in the superficial 
view  of  the  mind.  For  like  the  two  faces  of  a  mirror,  everything  has  an  outer  face  that 
looks to this manifest world, which resembles the mirror’s coloured face and may reflect 
various colours and states, and an inner face which looks to its Maker, which resembles 
the  mirror’s  shining  face.  In  the  outer  face  which  looks  to  the  manifest  world  may  be 
states  incompatible  with  the  dignity  and  perfection  of  the  Eternally  Besought  One’s 
power, so causes have been put to be both the source and the means of those states. But in 
the inner face, that of reality, which looks to their Creator, everything is transparent and 
beautiful; it is fitting that power should itself be associated with it. It is not  

 

301 

incompatible with its dignity; therefore, causes are purely apparent and in the inner face 
of things and in reality have no true effect. 

A further instance of wisdom in apparent causes is this: causes have been put so that 
unjust  complaints  and  baseless  objections  should  be  directed  at  them  and  not  at  the 
Absolutely  Just  One.  For  the  faults  arise  from  them,  from  their  incapacity  and  lack  of 
ability. A comparison is narrated which is in the form of a subtle example illustrating this 
mystery: 

The  Angel  Azra’il (Peace be upon him)  said to Almighty God: “Your servants will 
complain about me while I am carrying out my duty of taking possession of the spirits of 
the dying; they will be resentful towards me.” So Almighty God said to him through the 
tongue of wisdom: “I shall leave the veil of disasters and illnesses between you and my 
servants so that the complaints will be directed at them, and they will not be indignant at 
you.”31  So  see,  illnesses  are  a  veil;  what  are  imagined  to  be  the  bad  things  at  the 
appointed hour are attributed to them, and what are in reality the good things in the spirits 
of the dying  being  seized are  attributed to Azra’il (PBH) and  his duty.  Azra’il  is also a 
veil; he is a supervisor of that duty and a veil to Divine power so that certain conditions 
when  spirits  are  seized  which  are  apparently  unkind  and  are  inappropriate  to  the 
perfection of mercy be attributed to him. 

Yes, dignity and grandeur demand that causes are a veil to the hand of power in the 
view of the mind, while Divine unity and glory demand that causes withdraw their hands 
and have no true effect. 

SECOND FLASH 

Look  at this  garden  of  the  universe,  this  orchard  of  the  earth;  look  carefully  at  the 
beautiful  face  of  the  heavens  gilded  with  stars!  You  will  see  that  on  all  the  artefacts 
spread out and scattered over them are stamps particular to the Creator of All Things, and 
on all creatures are seals special to the Maker of  All Things, and on the levels of  being 
written on the pages of night and day, and summer and winter, all published by the pen of 
power, are inimitable, illustrious signatures of an All-Glorious Maker, an All-Beauteous 
Creator.  We  shall  now  mention  a  few  of  those  stamps,  seals,  and  signatures  by  way  of 
example: 

For  example,  of  the  innumerable  stamps,  consider  this  one  out  of  many  placed  on 
life: “He makes everything out of one thing and makes one thing out of everything.” For 
He makes the innumerable members and systems of animals out of a fluid and also out of 
simple water which  is drunk. Thus, to make one  thing everything  is  surely the work of 
One  possessing  Absolute  Power.  And  One  Who  with  perfect  order  transforms  into  a 
particular body numerous substances from the innumerable foods eaten, whether plant or 
animal, and weaves from them a particular skin, and makes from them  

                                                

31 Suyuti, al-Durr al-Manthur, v, 173-4. 

 

302 

simple  members,  is  surely  One  Powerful  over  All  Things  and  One  Knowing  of  All 
Things. Indeed, the Creator of Life and Death administers life through His wisdom in this 
workshop of the world through a law issuing from His command so miraculous that only 
one  Who  holds  the  whole  universe  in  the  grasp  of  His  power  could  apply  that  law  and 
enforce it. 

Thus, if your mind is not extinguished and your heart not blind, you will understand 
that what makes one thing with perfect ease and  order, and makes everything one thing 
skilfully with perfect balance and order, is a stamp particular to the Maker of everything 
and a seal special to the Creator of All Things. For example, if you see that together with 
weaving a hundred rolls of broadcloth and various other cloths like silk or cambric from a 
single  ounce  of  cotton,  a  wonder-worker  makes  many  foods  from  it  like  helva  and 
pastries, then you see that he takes a handful of iron and stone, honey and butter, water 
and  earth,  and  makes  some  fine  gold,  you  would  certainly  pronounce  him  to  possess 
unique  art,  for  all  the  elements  of  the  earth  are  subjugated  to  his  command  and  all  the 
substances  of  the  earth  subject  to  his  word.  Indeed,  the  manifestation  of  power  and 
wisdom in life is a thousand times more wondrous than this example. 

Thus, one stamp on life out of many. 

THIRD FLASH 

Look  at  the  living  creatures  revolving  in  this  flowing  universe,  in  this  flood  of 
beings!  You  will  see  that  on  each  are  many  seals  placed  by  the  Ever-Living  and  Self-
Subsistent  One.  One  of  them  is  this:  a  living  creature,  for  example  a  human  being,  is 
quite simply a miniature sample of the universe, a fruit of the tree of creation, and a seed 
of the world, for he comprises samples of most of the realms of beings in the world. It is 
as if the animate being is a drop filtered from the universe in an extremely fine measure. 
So to  create  it  and  be  its  Sustainer,  one  has  to  hold  the  whole  universe  in  the  grasp  of 
one’s power. 

Thus, if your mind is not submerged in delusions you will understand that to make a 
word of power, for example, a honey-bee, a minute index of most things, and to write in 
one  page,  for  example  in  man,  most  of  the  matters  in  this  book of  the  universe,  and  to 
include in one point, for example in a tiny fig seed, the programme of the mighty fig-tree, 
and  to  display  in  a  single  letter,  for  example  in  the  human  heart,  the  works  of  all  the 
Divine  Names  manifested  in  the  pages  of  the  macrocosm  which  encompass  it,  and  to 
make written in the human faculty of memory, which is situated in a place the size of a 
lentil, writings enough to fill a library, and to include in that tiny faculty a detailed index 
of  all  events  in  the  cosmos  –to  do  all  things  is  most  certainly  a  stamp  particular  to the 
Creator of All Things, the Glorious Sustainer of the universe. 

 

303 

Thus, if one seal out of many dominical seals on living beings displays its light and 
makes  read  its  signs  thus,  if  you  were  able  to  see  and  consider  all  those  seals  at  once, 
would  you  not  declare:  “Glory  be  to  Him  Who  is  concealed  in  the  intensity  of  His 
manifestation!”? 

FOURTH FLASH 

Look carefully at the multicoloured, multifarious beings swimming in the seas of the 
heavens and scattered over the face of the earth! You will see that on each are inimitable 
signatures of the Pre-Eternal Sun. Just as the stamps on life and seals on living beings are 
apparent and we saw one or two of them,  so are there such  signatures on the giving of 
life.  Since  comparisons  bring  profound  meanings  closer  to  the  understanding,  we  shall 
demonstrate this truth with a comparison. 

For  example,  from  the  planets  to  droplets  of  water,  to  fragments  of  glass  and 
sparkling snow-flakes, a signature from the sun’s image and reflection, a luminous work 
particular  to  the  sun,  is  apparent.  If  you  do  not  accept  the  tiny  suns  apparent  in  those 
innumerable things to be the manifestation of the sun’s reflection, you have to accept the 
actual existence of a true, natural  sun  in  every droplet and  fragment of glass  facing the 
light, and in every transparent speck before it, thus descending to the depths of lunacy.  

In  just the same way, there  is such  a signature on all  living  beings  in regard to the 
giving  of  life  from  among  the  luminous  manifestations  of  the  Pre-Eternal  Sun,  that 
supposing all causes were gathered together and had the power to act and possessed will, 
they still could not imitate that signature. For living beings, all miracles of Divine power, 
are points of focus of the Divine Names, which are like the rays of the Pre-Eternal Sun. If 
that  strange  inscription  of  art, that  wondrous  ordering  of  wisdom,  that  manifestation  of 
the  mystery  of  Oneness  on  living  beings  is  not  ascribed  to  the  Single  and  Eternally 
Besought  One,  it  necessitates  accepting  that  concealed  within  each  living  creature,  and 
even  in  a  fly  or  a  flower,  is  an  infinite  creative  power,  a  knowledge  encompassing  all 
things, an absolute will with which to govern the universe, and even the eternal attributes 
particular  to  the  Necessarily  Existent  One,  thus  falling  to  the  most  ludicrous  degree  of 
misguidance  and  superstition.  Quite  simply,  it  necessitates  attributing  Divinity  to  each 
particle  of  the  flower  or  fly.  For  a  state  has  been  given  to those  particles,  especially  if 
they are in seeds, whereby they look to the living being of which they are a part, and take 
up  a  position  in  accordance  with  its  systems  and  ordering.  The  particle  is  even  in  a 
position to look to all members of the species to which its living being belongs, or to fly 
with wings in order to be planted in a place suitable to the continuation of its species and 
to  plant  the  species’  flag.  In  fact,  it  holds  a  position  whereby  that  living  being’s 
transactions with all other beings may be continued, and its relations with them connected 
with sustenance. For it is in need of all of them. 

 

304 

Thus,  if  that  particle  is  not  an  official  of  a  Possessor of  Absolute  Power,  and  if  its 
relation  with  Him  is  severed,  it  has  to  be  ascribed  an  eye  which  sees  all  things  and  a 
consciousness which encompasses all things. 

In  Short:    If  the  miniature  suns  and  various  colours  in  droplets  of  water  and 
fragments  of  glass  are  not  attributed  to the  sun’s  reflection  and  the  manifestation  of  its 
reflection, one has to accept the existence of innumerable suns in place of the one sun; it 
necessitates  accepting  an  utterly  impossible  superstition.  In  exactly  the  same  way,  if 
everything  is  not  attributed  to  the  Absolutely  Powerful  One,  it  necessitates  accepting 
infinite  gods  instead  of  the  Single  God;  indeed,  gods  to  the  number  of  particles  in 
existence, thus falling to the degree of accepting a hundredfold impossibility. 

To Sum Up:  From every particle three windows open up onto the light of unity and 

necessary existence of the Pre-Eternal Sun: 

First Window:  A soldier has a relation with each of the spheres of the military, that 
is,  with  his  squad,  his  company,  his  battalion,  his  regiment,  his  division,  and  the  army, 
and duties  in accordance with those relations, and actions  in accordance with the duties 
and army regulations. Particles have similar relations. 

For example, a lifeless particle in the pupil of your eye has relations with your eye, 
your  head,  your  body,  your  powers  of  reproduction,  and  attraction  and  repulsion,  with 
your  veins  and  arteries,  and  motor  and  sensory  nerves,  and  with  the  rest  of  the  human 
race, and  it has duties  in relation to each. This  shows self-evidently to eyes that are not 
blind that it is the work of art and charged official of the Pre-Eternal All-Powerful One, 
and is under his regulation. 

Second  Window:   All  molecules  of  air  may  visit  all  flowers  and  fruits.  They  may 
also  enter  them  and  work  within  them.  If  they  are  not  the  subjugated  officials  of  an 
Absolutely  Powerful  One  Who  sees  and  knows  all  things,  those  wandering  molecules 
would have to know all the systems and structures of the fruits and flowers and their art, 
and  the  tailoring  of  the  all-different  forms  which  clothe  them  with  its  perfect  and  all-
embracing art. Thus those particles all display as clearly as the sun the rays of a light of 
Divine unity. You may compare light with air, and earth with water. 

In any event, the original sources of things are these  four substances.  According to 
modern science they are hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, the components of the 
former elements. 

Third  Window:    You  fill  a  flower-pot  with  some  earth,  which  is  composed  of 
particles  and  is  the  means  of  growth  of  any  flowering  or  fruit-bearing  plant,  then  put 
some seeds in it. The same as the seed of animals does not differ, but is a fluid, the seeds 
of all the flowering and fruit-bearing plants in the world do not differ from one another. 
Being composed of  

 

305 

carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, they only differ by virtue of the programme of 
their progenitors, deposited in them through the immaterial writing of the pen of Divine 
Determining.  

Thus,  if  we  put  these  seeds  in  turn  in  the  flower-pot,  we  believe  as  though  it  has 
occurred  that  each  plant  will  appear  together  with  its  wonderful  forms  and  shapes  and 
parts. If those particles are not officials under the orders of one who knows all the states 
and  conditions  of  everything,  is  capable  of  giving  everything  a  being  suitable  to  it  and 
everything  necessary  for  it,  and  to  whose  power  everything  is  subjugated  with  utterly 
facility,  every  particle  of  the  earth  would  then  have  to  contain  immaterial  factories  and 
printing-presses  to  the  number  of  all  the  flowering  and  fruit-bearing  plants,  so  that  it 
could be the source of all those various and different beings whose parts, members, and 
forms are all distant and different from one another. It is otherwise necessary to attribute 
to all those beings comprehensive knowledge and a power capable of  forming them,  so 
that they could be the means of the above. 

That is to say, if the connection with Almighty God is severed, it becomes necessary 
to accept gods to the number of particles of earth, and this is an impossible superstition 
compounded  a  thousand  times  over.  However,  when  they  are  officials,  it  becomes 
extremely easy. Just as, in his king’s name and through his power, a common soldier of a 
mighty  king  can  make  a  whole  country  migrate, or  join  two  seas,  or  take  another  king 
prisoner, so at the command of the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, a fly did 
away with Nimrod, and an ant destroyed Pharaoh’s palace, razing it to the ground, and a 
fig-seed bears the load of a fig-tree.  

Moreover, in all particles are two further truthful witnesses to the Maker’s necessary 
existence and unity. One is that together with their absolute impotence, they all perform 
most  important  and  various  duties.  The  other  is  that  despite  their  lifelessness,  they  all 
conform  to  the  universal  order  and  systems,  thus  displaying  a  universal  consciousness. 
That is to say, through the tongue of its impotence each particle testifies to the necessary 
existence of the Absolutely Powerful One, and through its conforming to the order in the 
world, each testifies to His unity. 

Just as every particle testifies in two ways to His being the Necessarily Existent One 
of Unity, so too on every  living being are two signs that He  is the Single and Eternally 
Besought One. 

Yes,  on  all  living  beings  are  a  seal  of  Divine  oneness  and  a  stamp  of  ‘eternal 
besoughtedness.’ For each displays together in the mirror of its being most of the Divine 
Names,  the  manifestations  of  which  are  apparent  in  the  universe.  Quite  simply,  like  a 
point of focus, each displays the manifestation of the Greatest Name of Ever-Living and 
Self-Subsistent One. Thus, since it  

 

306 

shows a sort of shadow of the oneness of the Divine Essence under the veil of the Name 
of Giver of Life, it bears a stamp of Divine oneness. And since the living being is like a 
miniature  sample  of  the  universe  and  a  fruit  of  the  tree  of  creation,  it  shows  a  seal  of 
Divine eternal besoughtedness, which conveys altogether with ease to the tiny sphere of 
its  life  its  needs,  which  are  as  many  as  the  universe.  That  is  to  say,  this  shows  it  has  a 
Sustainer  Whose regard and  favour take the place of all things. Everything  in existence 
cannot take the place of His regard. 

Furthermore,  this  situation  shows  that  its  Sustainer  is  in  need  of  nothing,  nor  does 
anything  diminish  His  treasury,  and  nor  is  anything  at  all  difficult  for  His  power.  This, 
then, is a sort of seal of ‘eternal besoughtedness.’ 

Thus,  on  every  living  being  are  a  seal  of  Divine  oneness  and  stamp  of  eternal 

besoughtedness. Yes, through the tongue of its life, every living being recites: 

Say, He is God, the One, * The Eternally Besought.32 

In addition to these two seals are several more important ‘windows’, but since they 

have been explained in detail in other places, our discussion here has been brief. 

Seeing  that  each  particle  in  existence  at  once  opens  up  three  windows  and  two 
openings onto the unity of the Necessarily Existent, and life too opens two doors, you can 
compare  how  all  the  levels  of  beings  from  particles  to  the  sun  spread  the  light  of 
knowledge of the All-Glorious One. 

Thus,  you  can  understand  from  this  the  degrees  of  progress  in  knowledge  of  God, 

and the levels of awareness of His presence. 

FIFTH FLASH 

If a book is hand-written and in the form of a letter, a single pen is sufficient to write 
it, while if  it is printed, pens, that is, pieces of print, are necessary to the number of the 
book’s  letters  so  that  it  can  be  printed  and  come  into  existence.  If  most  of  the  book  is 
written  in  an  extremely  fine  script  within  some  of  its  letters,  like  Sura  Ya.  Sin.  being 
written within the letters Ya. Sin., then for it to be printed all the small pieces of print are 
necessary for those single letters.  

Similarly,  if  you say the  book of the universe  is the writing of the pen of power of 
the Eternally Besought One and the missive of the Single and Unique One, you travel a 
reasonable road so easy  as to be  necessary. But  if  you  attribute  it to nature and causes, 
you travel a road so difficult as to be impossible, and so full of superstition and delusion 
as to be unacceptable. For then there would have to be present in every bit of earth and 
every drop

307 

of  water  and  every  piece  of  air  millions  of  metal  printing-presses  and  innumerable 
immaterial  factories,  which  could  fashion  and  form  the  countless  numbers  of  flowering 
and fruit-bearing plants. Otherwise one has to accept that they possess all-encompassing 
knowledge  and  power  over  all  things  so  that  they  could  be  the  true  source  of  those 
creatures.  For  every  piece  of  earth,  water,  and  air  can  be  the  source  of  most  plants. 
However,  plants,  whether  flowering  or  fruit-bearing,  are  formed  in  so  well-ordered  and 
balanced a fashion, and are so distinctive and different from one another, that a different 
immaterial factory or different printing-press would be necessary for each. That means, if 
nature  ceases  being  a  pattern  and  becomes  the  source,  it  necessitates  that  everything 
contains the machines to make everything else. Nature-worship is therefore based on an 
idea  so  superstitious  that  even  those  who  subscribe  to  it  are  ashamed  of  it.  See  the 
infinitely delirious unreason of the misguided, who suppose themselves to be intelligent, 
and take a lesson! 

In Short:  All the letters of a book describe themselves to the extent of a letter and 
point to their own existence in one way, while they describe their writer with ten words 
and  show  him  in  many  ways.  For  example:  “The  one  who  wrote  me  has  fine  hand-
writing. His pen is red, and so on.” In just the same way, all the letters of the mighty book 
of  the  universe  point to themselves  to the  extent  of  their  own  size  and  physical  beings, 
but describe the Names of the Pre-Eternal Inscriber like odes, and testify to the One they 
signify and point to His Names with fingers to the number of their attributes. That means 
that even  if one denies  both oneself  and the universe  like the  foolish Sophists, one still 
should not deny the All-Glorious Maker. 

SIXTH FLASH 

Just as the All-Glorious Creator has placed on the heads of all His beings and on the 
foreheads of all His creatures the seals of His oneness, some of which you have seen in 
the previous Flashes, so in brilliant fashion has He placed many stamps of oneness on all 
species  and  numerous  seals  of  unity  on  all  universals,  as  well  as  the  various  stamps  of 
unity on the world as a whole. Of those many seals and stamps, we shall point out one on 
the page of the face of the earth in the springtime. It is like this: 

The  Pre-Eternal  Inscriber’s  raising  to  life  in  the  spring  and  summer  at  least  three 
hundred  thousand  species  of  plants  and  animals  with  complete  distinction  and 
differentiation and total order and separation amid infinite intermingling and confusion, is 
a stamp of Divine unity as clear and brilliant as the spring itself. Yes, anyone with an iota 
of consciousness will understand that to create with perfect order while raising to life of 
the  dead  earth  in  the  spring,  three  hundred  thousand  samples  of  the  resurrection  of  the 
dead, and to write without fault, error, mistake or deficiency, in most well-balanced, well-
proportioned, well-ordered, and perfect fashion the individual  

 

308 

members of three hundred thousand different species one within the other on the face of 
the earth, is a seal particular to an All-Glorious One, an All-Powerful One of Perfection, 
an All-Wise One of Beauty, possessing infinite power, all-encompassing knowledge, and 
a will capable of governing the whole universe. The All-Wise Qur’an decrees: 

So  look  to  the  signs  of  God’s  Mercy,  how  He  raises  to  life  the  earth  after  its 
death;  He  it  is  Who  will  raise  the  dead  to  life,  for  He  is  Powerful  over  all 
things.33 

Yes, it is surely easy for the Creative Power which, within a few days, demonstrates 
examples of three hundred thousand resurrections in raising the earth to life, to raise men 
to life. For example, could it be said to a Displayer of Miracles Who at a sign will remove 
the  mountains  of  Gelincik  and  SŸbhan:  “Are  you  able  to  remove  from  this  valley  this 
huge rock which is blocking our path?” Similarly, can it be said in a way that infers doubt 
to  an  All-Wise  and  Powerful  One,  an  All-Generous  and  Compassionate  One,  Who 
created  the  sky  and  the  mountains  and  the  earth  in  six  days  and  continuously  fills  and 
empties them: “Can you remove from us this layer of earth which was prepared and laid 
out in eternity and is blocking our way to your banquet? Can you level the earth and let 
us pass on?” 

You observed a seal of Divine unity on the face of the earth in the summertime. Now 
look! A stamp of unity is clearly obvious on the vast, wise and perspicacious disposals of 
the spring on the face of the earth. For that activity is on an absolutely vast scale, and the 
vastness  is  together  with  an  absolute  speed,  and  that  speed  is  together  with  an  absolute 
munificence,  and  together  with  these  an  absolute  order  and  perfect  beauty  of  art  and 
exquisiteness of creation are apparent. These form a seal which could belong only to one 
possessing infinite knowledge and boundless power. Yes, we see that on the earth within 
an absolute extensiveness are a creation, disposal, and activity which are on an absolutely 
vast  scale.  And  these  are  occurring  within  that  vast  scope  with  absolute  speed.  And 
together  with  that  speed  and  vast  scope  an  absolute  munificence  is  apparent  in  the 
multiplication of individual beings. And together with that munificence, vast scope, and 
speed,  an  absolute  ease  is  apparent.  And  to  create  the  absolute  order  and  exceptional 
beauty  of  art  to  be  seen  in  all  species  and  individuals,  and  the  perfect  differentiation 
within infinite intermingling, and the valuable works within extreme abundance, and the 
complete correspondence on an extensive scale, and the artistic marvels with the greatest 
ease,  and  to  demonstrate  a  wondrous  art  and  miraculous  activity  at  one  moment, 
everywhere,  in  the  same  fashion,  in  every  individual  –  together  with  that  munificence, 
ease,  speed,  and  vast  scope,  is  certainly  and  without  doubt  the  stamp  of  One  Who 
although He is

309 

nowhere  is  all-present  and  all-seeing  everywhere.  Nothing  is  hidden  from  Him,  nor  is 
anything difficult for him. Particles and stars are equal in relation to His power. 

For  example,  in  a  garden  of  that  All-Glorious  and  Compassionate  One’s 
munificence,  I  counted  the  bunches  hanging  from  a  grape-vine  of  the  thickness  of  two 
fingers,  which  I  saw  to  be  like  one  little  pip  among  the  bunches  of  His  miracles:  there 
were  one  hundred  and  fifty-five.  I  counted the  grapes  in  one  bunch:  there  were  around 
one  hundred  and  twenty.  I  thought:  if  this  vine  was  a  tap  from  which  flowed  honeyed 
water and it produced water continuously, it would only  just be enough for the bunches 
which,  in  the  face  of  this  heat,  suckle  those  hundreds  of  little  pumps  of  the  sherbet  of 
mercy. However,  it only occasionally obtains a  little  moisture. The One  Who does this, 
then,  must surely  be powerful over all things.  Glory be to Him at Whose art minds are 
bewildered! 

SEVENTH FLASH 

Look!  With  little  difficulty  you  can  see  the  seals  of  the  Single,  Eternally  Besought 
One on the page of the earth, so raise your head, open your eyes, and look too at the great 
book of the universe. You will see that on it as a whole a stamp of unity is read out which 
is  as  clear  as  it  is  big.  For  like  the  components  of  a  factory  or  members  of  a  palace  or 
town, these beings support one another, stretch out their hands to assist one another, and 
answer  the  needs  and  requests  of  one  another,  saying:  “Here  I  am,  at  your  service!” 
Assisting  one  another,  they  work  together  in  order.  Joining  efforts,  they  serve  animate 
beings.  Co-operating  and  turned  a  single  goal,  they  obey  an  All-Wise  Disposer.  They 
conform to a rule of mutual assistance which is in force from the sun and moon, night and 
day,  and  winter  and  summer,  to  plants  coming  to  the  assistance  of  hungry  and  needy 
animals, and animals hastening to the assistance of weak, noble men, and even nutritious 
substances flying to assist delicate, weak infants and fruits, and particles of food passing 
to the assistance of the cells of the body. They show to anyone who is not altogether blind 
that they are acting through the strength of a single,  most generous Nurturer, and at the 
command of a single most wise Disposer. 

Thus,  on  the  one  hand  this  mutual  support  and  assistance,  this  answering  one 
another’s needs, this mutual embracing, this subjugation, this order, testify decisively that 
beings are administered and organized  by a single Disposer and are  being  impelled and 
directed  by  a  single  Nurturer.  And  on  the  other  hand,  this  perfect  grace  within  the 
universal  wisdom  to  be  seen  plainly  in  the  art  of  things;  and  the  all-embracing  mercy 
which  shines  within  the  providence;  and  the  sustenance  spread  over  that  mercy  and 
scattered so as to answer the needs of all living beings needy for sustenance; –these form 
a stamp of Divine unity so brilliant that anyone whose mind is not altogether  

 

310 

extinguished will understand it and anyone who is not altogether blind will see it.  

Yes, a veil of wisdom demonstrating intention, consciousness, and will, has covered 
the  whole  universe,  and  upon  that  veil  of  wisdom  has  been  spread  a  veil  of  grace  and 
favour  exhibiting  beneficence,  adornment,  embellishment,  and  benevolence;  and  over 
that adorned veil of favour a garment of mercy displaying flashes of making known and 
loved, of bestowal and the granting of gifts has enveloped the universe; and spread over 
that illuminated veil of universal mercy is a table of general provisions showing kindness 
and bestowal and benevolence and perfect compassion and fine nurturing and dominical 
favour. 

Yes,  all  beings  from  particles  to  suns,  whether  individuals  or  species,  or  large  or 
small,  have  been  clothed  in  a  magnificent  shirt  of  wisdom  embroidered  with  fruits  and 
aims, benefits and purposes. And over the wisdom-displaying shirt, a garment of favour 
embroidered with flowers of grace and beneficence has been cut out in accordance with 
the  stature  of  things;  and  over  that  ornamented  garment  of  favour,  a  general  table  of 
sustenance  has  been  set  up,  lit  up  with  flashes  of  love,  bestowal,  affection,  and  the 
granting  of  gifts,  to  which  the  decorations  of  mercy  have  been  attached,  and  which, 
together with  bestowing those  illuminated and  jewel-encrusted decorations,  is  sufficient 
for all the groups of living beings on the face of the earth, and meets all their needs. Thus, 
this  matter points to an All-Glorious Provider  Who  is  All-Wise, All-Generous, and All-
Compassionate, and shows Him as clearly as the sun. 

Is that so? Is everything in need of sustenance? 
Yes,  like  individual  beings  are  in  need  of  sustenance  and  all  the  necessities  to 
continue their lives, we see that all the beings in the world, and especially living beings, 
whether  universal  or  particular,  wholes  or  parts, have  many  desires  and  needs,  material 
and otherwise, for their existence, their lives, and the continuation of their lives. But their 
wants and  needs are  for such things that their  hands  cannot reach the  least of them and 
their power is insufficient for the smallest of them. Yet, we see that all their wishes and 
material  and  immaterial  sustenance  is  given  to  them  “From  where  he  could  not 
imagine,”34  from  unhoped  for  places,  with  perfect  order,  at  the  appropriate  time,  in  a 
suitable fashion, with perfect wisdom. And so, does this want and need of creatures and 
this manner of unseen help and assistance not show an All-Wise and Glorious Nurturer, 
an All-Compassionate Beauteous Disposer?

EIGHTH FLASH 

Any sort of seed sown  in a  field shows that the field  must be at the disposal of the 
seed’s owner, and that the seed too is under the disposal of the one who has control of the 
field.  Similarly,  the  arable  field  of  beings  known  as  the  elements  and  their  universality 
and comprehensiveness as well as their  sameness and uncomplex  nature, and the plants 
and animals –these  fruits of  mercy,  miracles of power, and words of wisdom known  as 
creatures–  and  their  spreading  to  most  places  and  settling  everywhere  as  well  as  their 
being  similar  and  resembling  one  another,  show  that  they  are  under  the  disposal  of  a 
single Miracle-Displaying Maker, and in such a way that it is as if every flower, fruit, and 
animal  is a seal, stamp, and signature of  its Maker. Wherever they are  found, each says 
through the tongue of disposition: “Whose-ever seal I am, the place I am found is also of 
his making. Whose-ever stamp I am, this place is a missive of His. Whose-ever signature 
I am, this land too is of his weaving.” That means, to be Sustainer of the least creature is 
particular to the One Who holds all the elements in the grasp of His power. Anyone who 
is  not  blind  can  see  that  to regulate  and  govern  the  simplest  animal  is  particular  to the 
One Who has all beings in the grasp of His dominicality. 

Indeed,  through  the  tongue  of  similarity  to  other  individuals,  all  individual  beings 
say:  “Only  one  who  owns  my  species  can  be  my  owner.  It  cannot  be  otherwise.”  And 
through  the  tongue  of  spreading  over  the  face  of  the  earth  together  with  other  species, 
each species says: “Only one who owns the whole face of the earth can be our owner. It 
cannot be otherwise.” And through the tongue of being bound to the sun and other planets 
and  mutually  supportive  with  the  skies,  the  earth  says:  “Only  one  who  is  owner  of  the 
whole universe can be my owner. It cannot be otherwise.” Yes, supposing someone were 
to say to a conscious apple: “You are my work of art.” Through the tongue of disposition, 
the apple would reply: “Be silent! If you are capable of fashioning all the other apples on 
the  earth;  indeed,  if  you  can  have  disposal  over  all  my  fellows,  the  other  fruit-bearing 
trees,  spread over  the  earth,  and  all  the  gifts  of  the  Most  Merciful  proceeding  from  the 
treasury of mercy in boatloads, then you can claim to be my Sustainer.” The apple would 
say that and aim a slap at that foolish person. 

NINTH FLASH 

We  have  pointed  out  some  of  the  seals,  stamps,  and  signatures  on  particulars  and 
parts,  universals  and  wholes,  on  the  world  as  a  whole,  and  on  life,  living  beings,  and 
raising to life. Now, we shall indicate one of the countless stamps on species. 

Since the countless fruits of a fruit-bearing tree are administered from one centre, in 
accordance with one law and a single way of raising, the difficulty, hardship, and expense 
are transformed into ease. It is so easy the numerous  

 

312 

fruits raised become equal to a single fruit. That means in regard to quantity, multiplicity 
and numerous centres necessitate the difficulty, expense, and equipment of the whole tree 
for a single fruit. The difference is only in regard to quality. Like all the factories required 
for the whole army are necessary to manufacture all the military equipment necessary for 
a single soldier. That is to say, if the matter passes from unity to multiplicity, in respect of 
quantity  the  difficulties  increase  to  the  number  of  individuals.  Thus,  the  extraordinary 
ease  to  be  seen  clearly  in  all  species  is  the  result  of  the  ease  and  facility  arising  from 
unity. 

In  Short:  The  conformity  and  similarity  in  basic  members  between  all  the 
individuals of a species, and all the species of a genus, prove that they are the works of a 
single  Maker,  because  the  unity  of  the  pen  and  oneness  of  the  seal  requires  this. 
Similarly,  the  observable  absolute  ease  and  lack  of  difficulty  require  –indeed, 
necessitate–  that  they  are  the  works  of  One  Maker.  Otherwise  difficulties  rising  to  the 
degree of impossibility would doom the genus and the species to non-existence. 

To Conclude: If all things are ascribed to Almighty God, they become an easy as a 
single thing, while if they are attributed to causes, they become as difficult as everything. 
Since  it  is thus, the extraordinary profusion observed  in the universe and the  boundless 
abundance before our eyes display a stamp of unity like the sun. If these fruits which we 
obtain  in  such  plenty  were  not  the  property  of  the  Single  One  of  Unity,  we  would  not 
have a single pomegranate to eat, even if we gave the whole world for it. 

TENTH FLASH 

Just  as  life,  which  displays  a  manifestation  of  Divine  beauty,  is  a  proof  of  Divine 
oneness, and a sort of manifestation of unity, death too, which displays the manifestation 
of Divine glory, is a proof of Divine unity. 

For  example,  And  God’s  is  the  highest  similitude,  by  showing  the  sun’s  light  and 
reflection, the bubbles on a wide flowing river which sparkle in the sun and transparent 
objects which glisten on the face of the earth testify to the sun. On those tribes of bubbles 
and transparent objects disappearing, the continued magnificent manifestation of the sun 
and the uninterrupted and constant display of its light on the successive groups and tribes 
of bubbles and transparent objects which follow on after them, testify decisively that the 
little images of the sun and the lights and flashes which appear and sparkle, flare up and 
die away, and are changed and renewed, are the manifestations of an enduring, perpetual, 
elevated, single Sun whose manifestation is undying. That is to say, just as through their 
appearance  and  becoming  visible,  the  shining  droplets  demonstrate the  sun’s  existence, 
so  with 
its  continuation, 
permanence, and unity. 

their  disappearance  and  extinction, 

they  demonstrate 

 

313 

In  exactly  the  same  way,  through  their  existence  and  lives  these  flowing  beings 
testify to the necessary existence and oneness of the Necessarily Existent One, and with 
their  deaths  and  disappearance,  they  testify  to the  His  pre-eternity,  everlastingness,  and 
unity. Yes, the beautiful creatures and fine beings which are renewed and restored within 
the decline and disappearance that occur through the alternation of night and day, winter 
and summer, and the centuries and ages, surely point to the existence, continuance, and 
unity of an elevated, eternal possessor of continually manifested beauty. While the deaths 
and  disappearance  of  those  beings  together  with  their  apparent  and  lowly  causes 
demonstrate that the causes are nothing but a mere veil. This situation proves decisively 
that these  arts,  these  inscriptions,  these  manifestations,  are  the  constantly  renewed  arts, 
the changing  inscriptions, the  moving  mirrors of  an  All-Beauteous One of Glory, all of 
Whose Names are sacred and beautiful; that they are His seals which follow on one after 
the other, and His stamps that are changed with wisdom. 

In  Short:    The  mighty  book  of  the  universe  both  teaches  us  the  creational  signs 
concerning Divine existence and unity, and  it testifies to all the attributes of perfection, 
beauty, and glory of that All-Glorious One. And they prove the perfection of the Divine 
Essence faultlessly and without defect. For it is obvious that perfection in a work points 
to the perfection of the act which is the source and origin of the work. And the perfection 
of  the  act  points  to  the  perfection  of  the  name,  and  the  perfection  of  the  name,  to  the 
perfection of the attribute, and perfection of the attribute to the perfection of the essential 
qualities,  and  the  perfection  of  the  qualities  point  necessarily  and  self-evidently  to  the 
perfection of the essence possessing those qualities.  

For  example,  the  perfect  inscriptions  and  adornments  of  a  faultless  palace  indicate 
the  perfection  of  a  master  builder’s  acts  behind  them.  And  the  perfection  of  the  acts 
shows the perfection of that active master’s titles and names, which demonstrate his rank. 
And  the  perfection  of  the  names  and  titles  show  the  perfection  of  the  other  attributes 
qualifying the master builder’s art. And the perfection of the art and attributes show the 
perfection  of  the  abilities  and  essential  capacity  of  that  craftsman,  which  are  called  the 
essential  qualities.  And  the  perfection  of  those  essential  qualities  and  abilities  show the 
perfection of the master’s essential nature. 

In exactly the same way, the faultless works observed in the world, which manifest 
the  meaning  of  “Do  you  see  any  flaw?”,35  this  art  in  the  well-ordered  beings  of  the 
universe, point observedly to the perfect acts of an active possessor of power. And those 
perfect acts point clearly to the perfect Names of a Glorious Agent. And that perfection 
necessarily points to and testifies to the perfect attributes of the Beauteous One signified 
by the  

                                                

35 Qur’an, 67:3. 

 

314 

Names.  And  certainly  those  perfect  attributes  point  and  testify  to  the  perfection  of  the 
Perfect  One  qualified  by  the  attributes.  And  those  perfect  qualities  point  with  such 
absolute  certainty  to  the  perfect  Essence  of  the  One  possessing  the  qualities  that  they 
indicate that all the sorts of perfection to be seen in the whole universe are but signs of 
His perfections, hints of His Glory, and allusions to His beauty, and pale, weak shadows 
in relation to His perfection. 

THE ELEVENTH FLASH, 

  WHICH HAS THE STRENGTH OF SUNS 

As  is  defined  in  the  Nineteenth  Word,  our  master  Muhammad  the  Trustworthy 
(Peace  and  blessings  be  upon  him)  is  the  supreme  sign  of  the  mighty  Book  of  the 
Universe  and  the  Greatest  Name  of  that  mighty  Qur’an,  the  seed  of  the  tree  of  the 
universe and  its  most  luminous  fruit, the sun of the palace of the world and the radiant 
moon of the world of Islam, the herald of the sovereignty of Divine dominicality, and the 
wise discloser of the talisman of the universe, who flies  in the  levels of reality with the 
wings of Messengership, which take under their shade all the prophets, and the wings of 
Islam, which take under their protection all the world of Islam; who took behind him all 
the  prophets  and  messengers,  all  the  saints  and  veracious  ones,  all  the  purified  and  the 
scholars, and demonstrated Divine unity with all  his  strength and opened up the way to 
Divine  oneness;  has  any  doubt  or  suspicion,  then,  the  power  to  conceal  or  obscure  the 
belief in God which he demonstrated, or the Divine unity which he proved? Since in the 
Nineteenth  Word and Nineteenth  Letter we have  defined and described  briefly  and to a 
small degree in Fourteen Droplets and Nineteen Signs from the water of life of that Clear 
Proof’s knowledge that miracle-displaying Being  together with  his  various  miracles, we 
shall here content ourselves with this indication, and conclude with a benediction for him: 

O God! Grant blessings to the one who demonstrated Your necessary existence 
and unity, and testified to Your glory and beauty and perfection; the verified and 
veracious  witness,  the  verifying  articulate  proof;  the  lord  of  the  prophets  and 
messengers,  the  bearer  of  the  mystery  of  their  consensus,  affirmation,  and 
miracles; the leader of the saints and veracious ones, the holder of the mystery 
of  their  accord,  verifications,  and  wonder-working;  the  one  with  evident 
miracles,  clear  marvels,  and  decisive  evidences  which  corroborated  and 
affirmed  him;  who  displayed  exalted  purity  in  his  self,  elevated  morals  in  his 
duty, and lofty qualities in his Shari’a, perfect and free of all contradiction, to 
whom according to the consensus of the revealed and the Revealer and the one 
who revealed it to him, dominical reve

lation  descended;  the  traveller  through  the  Worlds  of  the  Unseen  and  of  the 
Inner  Dimensions  of  Things;  the  observer  of  spirits,  who  conversed  with  the 
angels;  the  sample  of  the  perfections  of  the  universe,  in  regard  to  both 
individuals, and species, and realms of beings; the most luminous of the fruits of 
the  tree  of  creation;  the lamp  of  truth;  the  proof of  reality;  the  embodiment  of 
mercy; the exemplification of love; the discloser of the talisman of the universe; 
the  herald  of  the  sovereignty  of  dominicality;  the  sign  that  the  elevatedness  of 
his  collective  personality  was  before  the  eyes  of  the  world’s  Creator  at  the 
creation  of  the  universe;  the  possessor  of  a  Shari’a  that  indicates  through  the 
breadth  of  its  principles  and  strength  that  it  is  the  order  of  the  Orderer  of  the 
World, drawn up by the Creator of the Universe. 

Yes,  the  One  Who  ordered  the  universe  with  this  perfect  and  total  order  is  He 
Who ordered this religion  with its fine and beautiful order, our master,  we are 
the community of the sons of Adam, our guide to belief, we are the community of 
believers,  Muhammad  ibn  ‘Abdullah  ibn  ‘Abd  al-Mutallib,  Upon  him  be  the 
most  perfect  blessings  and  most  complete  peace  as  long  as  the  heavens  and 
earth  subsist,  for  he  is  the  veracious  and  verified  witness  who  summoned  the 
leaders of witnesses and has instructed the branches of mankind throughout the 
centuries  and  all  the  regions  of  the  world  in  elevated  fashion  with  all  his 
strength, with complete seriousness and utter steadfastness, and with the power 
of his certainty and perfect belief, testifying: 

“I testify that there is no god but God, the One, He has no partner.” 

THE TWELFTH FLASH, 

  WHICH HAS THE STRENGTH OF SUNS 

This Twelfth Flash of the Twenty-Second Word is such an ocean of truths that all the 
previous twenty-two Words form only twenty-two drops of it, and it is a source of such 
lights that they  form only twenty-two flashes of that Sun. Yes, all the previous twenty-
two Words are flashes of the stars of the verses shining in the skies of the Qur’an; all are 
single  droplets  from  the  river  of  a  verse  flowing  from  that  ocean  of  discernment 
distinguishing truth and falsehood; each is but one pearl from a single of its verses, all of 
which  are  chests  of  jewels  in  the  sublime  treasury  of  God’s  Book.  Thus,  the  Word  of 
God,  which  is  in  small  part  defined  in  the  Fourteenth  Droplet  of  the  Nineteenth  Word, 
has been revealed from the Greatest Name, the Sublime  

 

316 

Throne, and the greatest manifestation of dominicality, and it repeatedly states with all its 
strength within a breadth and elevatedness that binds pre-eternity to post-eternity and ties 
the ground to the Divine Throne, and with the certainty of all its verses: There is no god 
but God!; it calls the whole universe to witness and makes it testify. Yes, altogether the 
world hymns: There is no god but God! 

If  you  look  at  the  Qur’an  with  the  eyes  of  a  sound  heart,  you  will  see  that  its  six 
aspects  are  so  brilliant  and  transparent  that  no  darkness,  no  misguidance,  no  doubt  or 
suspicion, no trickery could enter it or find a fissure through which to enter and violate its 
purity.  For  above  it  is  the  stamp  of  miraculousness;  beneath  it,  proof  and  evidence; 
behind it, its point of support, pure dominical revelation; before it, the happiness of this 
world and the next; on its right, questioning the reason and ensuring its confirmation; on 
its left, calling on the conscience to witness and securing its submission; within it is self-
evidently the pure guidance of the Most Merciful;  its outside observedly consists of the 
lights  of  belief;  and  its  fruits,  with  all  certainty  the  purified  and  veracious  scholars  and 
saints,  who  are  adorned  with  all  the  human  perfections  and  attainments.  If  you  fasten 
your  ear  to  the  breast  of  that  tongue  of  the  Unseen,  you  will  hear  from  afar  a  most 
familiar and convincing, an infinitely serious and elevated heavenly voice equipped with 
proof  which  repeats  “There  is  no  god  but  God.”  It  states  this  so  certainly  it  is  at  the 
degree  of  ‘absolute  certainty’,  and  illuminates  you  with  a  ‘knowledge  of  certainty’ 
resembling ‘vision of certainty.’ 

In  Short:    Both  God’s  Most  Noble  Messenger  (Peace  and  blessings  be  upon  him) 
and the  Most Decisive Criterion of Truth and  Falsehood were suns. One, the tongue of 
the Manifest World, pointing with the fingers of Islam and Messengership and confirmed 
by all the prophets and purified ones supported by a thousand miracles, demonstrated this 
truth with all his strength. 

And the other, like the tongue of the World of the Unseen, indicating with the fingers 
of  right  and  guidance  under  the  confirmation  of  all  the  creational  signs  in  the  universe 
within forty aspects of miraculousness, demonstrates the same truth with all seriousness. 
Is that truth then not clearer than the sun and more brilliant than sunlight? 

Oh, obdurate little man sunk in misguidance!36 How can you oppose these suns with 
the lamp of your head, dimmer than a fire-fly? How can you show disdain for them? Are 
you  trying  to  extinguish  them  by  puffing?  Pooh  to  your  denying  mind!  How  can  you 
deny the words and claims which those two tongues of the Manifest and Unseen Worlds 
speak in the  

                                                

36 This is addressing someone who was trying to abolish the Qur’an. 

 

317 

name of the Sustainer of all the worlds and Owner of the universe; which they speak on 
His behalf? Oh, you wretch, lower and more impotent than a fly! Who are you that you 
attempt to give the lie to the universe’s Glorious Owner? 

Conclusion 

O  friend,  whose  mind  is  alert  and  heart,  attentive!  If  you  have  understood  this 
Twenty-Second Word from the beginning up to here, take the twelve Flashes together in 
your hand, and finding a lamp of truth as powerful as a thousand electric lamps, adhere to 
the below-mentioned verses of the Qur’an. Mount the steed of Divine assistance, ascend 
to the heavens of truth, rise to the Throne of Divine knowledge. Declare: 

I testify that there is no god but You, You are One, You have no partner!37 

And, saying, 

I testify that there is no god but God, He is One, He has no partner; His is the 
dominion and His is the praise; He gives life and gives death, and He is ever-
living and dies not; in His hand is all good, and He is powerful over all things,38 

proclaim His unity over the heads of all the beings in the universe in this mighty mosque 
of the world. 

Glory  be  to  You!  We  have  no  knowledge  save  that  which  You  have  taught  us; 
indeed, You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.39 

O  our  Sustainer!  Do  not  call  us  to  task  if  we  forget  or  fall  into  error.    *  Our 
Sustainer! Lay not a burden on us like that which you laid on those before us;  * 
Our  Sustainer!  Lay  not  on  us  a  burden  greater  than  we  have  the  strength  to 
bear. * Blot out our sins. And grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are 
our Protector; help us against those who stand

bounties without measure. * Our Sustainer! You are He that will gather mankind 
together against a Day about which there is no doubt; for God never fails in His 
promise.41 

O God! Grant blessings and peace to the one whom You sent as a Mercy to all 
the  worlds,  and  to  all  his  Family  and  Companions.  And  have  mercy  of  us  and 
have  mercy  on  his  community,  through  Your  mercy,  O  Most  Merciful  of  the 
Merciful. Amen.  

And the close of their prayer will be: Praise be to God, the Sustainer of All the 
Worlds! 42

The Twenty-Third Word 

[This Word contains Two Chapters] 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
Indeed, We have created man on the most excellent of patterns, * Then sent him 
down to the lowest of the low, * Except those who believe and do good deeds.1 

First Chapter 

We shall explain in five ‘Points’ only five of the virtues of belief out of thousands. 

FIRST POINT 

Through the light of belief, man rises to the highest of the high and acquires a value 
worthy of Paradise.  And through the darkness of  unbelief,  he descends to the  lowest of 
the  low  and  falls  to  a  position  fit  for  Hell.  For  belief  connects  man  to the  All-Glorious 
Maker;  it  is  a  relation.  Thus,  man  acquires  value  by  virtue  of  the  Divine  art  and 
inscriptions  of  the  dominical  Names  which  become  apparent  in  him  through  belief. 
Unbelief severs the relation, and due to that severance the dominical art is concealed. His 
value then is only in respect to the matter of his physical being. And since this matter has 
only a transitory, passing, temporary animal life, its value is virtually nothing. We shall 
explain this mystery by means of a comparison: 

For example: among man’s arts, the value of the materials used and that of the art are 
entirely  different.  Sometimes  they  are  equal,  sometimes  the  material  is  more  valuable, 
and sometimes it happens that five liras’ worth of art is to be found in material like iron 
worth five kurush. Sometimes, even, an antique work of art is worth a million while the 
material of which it is composed is not worth five kurush. If such a work of art is taken to 
the  

                                                

1 Qur’an, 95:4-6. 

 

320 

antiques  market and ascribed to a brilliant and accomplished artist of  former times, and 
announced mentioning the artist and that art, it may be sold for a million liras.2 Whereas 
if  it  is  taken  to  the  scrap-dealers,  the  only  price  received  will  be  for  the  five  kurush’s 
worth of iron. 

Thus, man is such an antique work of art of Almighty God. He is a most subtle and 
graceful  miracle  of  His  power  whom  He  created  to  manifest  all  his  Names  and  their 
inscriptions,  in  the  form  of  a  miniature  specimen  of  the  universe.  If  the  light  of  belief 
enters  his  being,  all  the  meaningful  inscriptions  on  him  may  be  read.  As  one  who 
believes, he reads them consciously, and through that relation, causes others to read them. 
That is to say, the dominical art in man becomes apparent through meanings like,  “I am 
the  creature  and  artefact  of  the  All-Glorious  Maker.  I  manifest  His  mercy  and 
munificence.”  That  is,  belief,  which  consists  of  being  connected  to  the  Maker,  makes 
apparent all the works of art in man. Man’s value is in accordance with that dominical art 
and  by  virtue  of  being  a  mirror  to  the  Eternally  Besought  One.  In  this  respect 
insignificant  man  becomes  God’s  addressee  and  a  guest  of  the  Sustainer  worthy  of 
Paradise superior to all other creatures. 

However,  should  unbelief,  which  consists  of  the  severance  of  the  relation,  enter 
man’s being, then all those meaningful inscriptions of the Divine Names are plunged into 
darkness and become illegible. For if the Maker is forgotten, the spiritual aspects which 
look to Him will not be comprehended, they will be as though reversed. The majority of 
those  meaningful  sublime  arts  and  elevated  inscriptions  will  be  hidden.  The  remainder, 
those  that  may  be  seen  with  the  eye,  will  be  attributed  to  lowly  causes,  nature,  and 
chance,  and  will  become  utterly  devoid  of  value.  While  they  are  all  brilliant  diamonds, 
they  become  dull  pieces  of  glass.  His  importance  looks  only  to  his  animal,  physical 
being. And as we said, the aim and fruit of his physical being is only to pass a brief and 
partial  life  as  the  most  impotent,  needy,  and  grieving  of  animals.  Then  it  decays  and 
departs. See how unbelief destroys human nature, and transforms it from diamonds into 
coal. 

SECOND POINT 

Just as belief is a light which illuminates man and makes legible all the missives of 
the  Eternally  Besought  One  inscribed  upon  him,  so  too  it  illuminates  the  universe,  and 
delivers  the  past  and  the  future  from  darkness.  I  shall  explain  this  mystery  with  a 
comparison I saw during a vision, which concerns one meaning of the verse: 

God  is  the  Protector  of those  who  believe;  He  leads  them  out  of  darkness  into 
light.3 

                                                
2 See, page 295, footnote 19. 
3 Qur’an, 2:257. 

 

321 

It was like this: 
I  saw  in  a  vision  an  awesome  bridge  built  between  two  high  mountains  situated 
opposite one another. Beneath the bridge was a valley of great depth. I was on the bridge. 
A dense darkness had enveloped every part of the world. I looked to my right and saw a 
vast grave swathed in an unending dense gloom, that is, I imagined it. I looked to my left 
and  as  though  saw  violent  storms  and  calamities  gathering  amid  terrifying  waves  of 
blackness. I looked beneath the bridge and imagined I saw a profound abyss. I had a dim 
torch in the face of this terrifying darkness. I used it and could see a little with its light. A 
most horrific situation appeared to me. In  fact, such awful dragons,  lions, and  monsters 
appeared around  me and on the bridge  in  front of  me that I exclaimed:  “Oh! This torch 
brings  me  only  trouble!”,  and  I  angrily  cast  it  to  the  ground  and  broke  it.  Then  on 
smashing it, the darkness suddenly dispersed as though I had turned on the switch for a 
huge  electric  lamp  that  lit  up  the  whole  world.  Everywhere  was  filled  with  the  lamp’s 
light. It showed everything as it was in reality.  

I  saw  that  the  bridge  I  had  seen  was  a  highway  through  a  plain  passing  over  even 
ground. The vast grave I had seen on my right I realized consisted from top to bottom of 
beautiful,  verdant  gardens  and  gatherings  for  worship,  service,  conversation,  and  the 
remembrance of God under the direction of luminous men. The precipices and peaks on 
my left which I had imagined to be tempestuous and stormy I now saw fleetingly to be a 
vast, lovely, and elevated place of feasting, recreation, and enjoyment behind mountains 
that were adorned and pleasant. And the creatures I had thought to be terrifying monsters 
and dragons, I saw were  familiar domestic animals  like camels, oxen, sheep, and goats. 
Declaring, “All praise be to God for the light of belief,” I recited the verse,  

God  is  the  Protector  of those  who  believe;  He  leads  them  out  of  darkness  into 
light, 

and I awoke from my vision. 

Thus, the two mountains were the beginning and end of  life; that is, this world and 
the Intermediate Realm. The bridge was the road of life. To the right was the past, and to 
the  left,  the  future.  As  for  the  small  torch,  it  was  the  human  ego,  which  is  egotistical, 
relies on what it knows, and does not heed the heavenly revelation. The things imagined 
to be the monsters were the events and strange creatures of the world.  

Thus, one who relies on his ego, who falls  into the darkness of  heedlessness and  is 
afflicted with the blackness of misguidance resembles my first state in the vision, which, 
like with the pocket-torch and due to deficient and misguided knowledge, saw the past in 
the form a huge grave amid darkness imbued with non-existence. It showed the future to 
be a stormy and desolate  

 

322 

wasteland  governed  by  coincidence,  and  events  and  beings,  which  are  all  submissive 
officials  of  One  All-Wise  and  All-Compassionate  to  be  monsters.  Such  a  person  as 
though manifests the verse, 

And those who reject belief, their protectors are the evil ones; they lead them out 
of light into darkness.4 

But  if  such  a  man  attains  to  Divine  guidance  and  belief  enters  his  heart,  and  if  the 
tyranny  of  his  soul  is  smashed  and  he  heeds  God’s  Book,  he  will  resemble  my  second 
state in the vision. Then the universe will suddenly take on the colour of day and be filled 
with Divine light. The world will recite the verse, 

God is the light of the heavens and the earth.5 

Then he will see with the eye of the heart that the past is not a vast grave, but where 
the groups of purified spirits who each century having performed their duties of worship 
under the leadership of a prophet or saint exclaim, “God is Most Great!” on completion 
of the duties of their lives, and fly to elevated abodes, moving on to the past. He will look 
to the  left, and through the  light of belief distinguish  in the distance a  feasting-place of 
the  Most  Merciful  set  up  in  palaces  of  bliss  in  the  gardens  of  Paradise,  beyond  the 
mountainous revolutions of the Intermediate Realm and the hereafter. And he will realize 
that the storms and earthquakes and tempestuous events are all submissive officials, and 
understand  that  they  are  the  means  for  instances  of  wisdom  which  though  apparently 
harsh are in fact most gentle, like the storms and rains of spring. He will even see death to 
be the introduction to eternal life, and the grave, the door to everlasting happiness. You 
can deduce further aspects for yourself. Apply the reality to the comparison! 

THIRD POINT 

Belief is both light and strength. Yes, one who acquires true belief may challenge the 
whole universe and be saved from the pressure of events in accordance with the strength 
of  his  belief.  Saying,  “I  place  my  trust  in  God,”  he  travels  through  the  mountainous 
waves of events in the ship of life in complete safety. He entrusts all his burdens to the 
hand of power of the Absolutely Powerful One, voyages through the world in ease, then 
takes his rest in the Intermediate Realm. Later he may fly up to Paradise in order to enter 
eternal happiness. Otherwise, if he does not rely on God, rather than flying, the burdens 
of  the  world  will  drag  him  down  to  the  lowest  of  the  low.  That  is  to  say,  belief 
necessitates  affirmation  of  Divine  unity,  affirmation  of  Divine  unity  necessitates 
submission to God, submission to God necessitates reliance on God, and reliance on God 
necessarily leads to happiness in this  

                                                

4 Qur’an, 2:257. 
5 Qur’an, 24:35. 

 

323 

world and the next. But do not misunderstand this, reliance on God is not to reject causes 
altogether;  it  is  rather  to  know  that  causes  are  a  veil  to  the  hand  of  power  and  have 
recourse to them. Knowing that attempting causes is a sort of active prayer, it is to seek 
the effects only from Almighty God, recognize that the results are from Him alone, and to 
be thankful to Him. 

Those who place their trust in God and those who do not, resemble the two men in 

this story: 

One  time  two  men  loaded  heavy  burdens  onto  both  their  backs  and  heads,  and 
buying tickets, boarded a large ship. As soon as they boarded it, one of them left his load 
on the deck, and sitting on it guarded it. The other, however, since he was both stupid and 
arrogant,  did  not  put  down  his  load.  When  he  was  told:  “Leave  that  heavy  load  on  the 
deck  and  be  comfortable,”  he  replied:  “No,  I  won’t  put  it  down,  it  might  get  lost.  I  am 
strong, I’ll guard  my property by carrying  it on my  head and  back.” He was told again: 
“This reliable royal ship which is carrying you and us is stronger, it can protect it better 
than you. You may get giddy and fall into the sea together with your load. Anyway you 
will  gradually  lose  your  strength,  and  by  degrees  those  loads  will  get  heavier  and  your 
bent  back  and  brainless  head  will  not  have  the  power to  bear  them.  And  if  the  Captain 
sees you in this state, he will either say that you are crazy and expel you from the ship, or 
he  will  think  you  are  ungrateful,  accusing  our  ship  and  jeering  at  us,  and  he  will  order 
you to be put into prison. Also you are making a fool of yourself in front of everyone. For 
the  perceptive  see  that  you  are  displaying  weakness  through  your  conceit,  impotence 
through  your pride, and abasement and  hypocrisy through  your pretence, and  have thus 
made  yourself  a  laughing-stock in the eyes of the people. Everyone’s  laughing at  you.” 
Whereupon  the  unfortunate  man  came  to  his  senses.  He  put  down  his  load  on the  deck 
and sat on it. He said to the other: “Ah! May God be pleased with you. I’ve been saved 
from that difficulty, from prison, and from making a fool of myself.” 

O  man who does not place  his trust in God! You too come to your senses  like that 
man and place  your trust in Him, so that you  may  be delivered  from  begging before all 
the universe, trembling before every event, from pride, making a fool of yourself, misery 
in the hereafter, and the prison of the pressures of this world... 

FOURTH POINT 

Belief makes man into man, indeed, it makes him into a king. Since this is so, man’s 
basic  duty  is  belief  and  supplication.  Unbelief  makes  him  into  an  extremely  impotent 
beast. 

Out of  thousands  of  proofs  of  this  matter, the  differences  in  the  ways  animals  and 

man come into the world are a clear indication and decisive proof.  

 

324 

Yes, these differences  show that humanity  becomes  humanity through  belief.  For when 
animals come  into the world, they come complete  in all points  in accordance with their 
abilities  as  though  having  been  perfected  in  another  world;  that  is,  they  are  sent.  They 
learn all the conditions of their lives, their relationships with the universe, and the laws of 
life  in  either  two  hours  or  two  days  or  two  months,  and  become  proficient  in  them. 
Animals  like  sparrows  and  bees  acquire  in  twenty  days  the  power  to  survive  and 
proficiency  in  their  actions  that  man  only  acquires  in  twenty  years;  that  is,  they  are 
inspired with them. This means that the animals’ fundamental duty is not to be perfected 
through  learning  and  progress  by  acquiring  knowledge,  nor  to  seek  help  and  offer 
supplications through displaying their impotence, but in accordance with their abilities to 
work and act. Their duty is active worship. 

As  for  man,  he  needs  to  learn  everything  when  he  comes  into  the  world;  he  is 
ignorant, and cannot even learn completely the conditions of life in twenty years. Indeed, 
he needs to go on learning till the end of his life. Also he is sent to the world in a most 
weak and impotent form, and can only rise to his feet in one or two years. Only in fifteen 
years  can  he  distinguish  between  harm  and  benefit,  and  with  the  help  of  mankind’s 
experience  attract  things  advantageous  to  him  and  avoid  others  that  are  harmful.  This 
means  that  man’s  innate  duty  is  to  be  perfected  through  learning  and  to  proclaim  his 
worship of God and servitude to Him through supplication. That is to say, it is to know 
the  answers  of  the  questions:  “Through  whose  compassion  is  my  life  so  wisely 
administered  in  this  way?  Through  whose  generosity  am  I  so  kindly  raised?  Through 
whose graciousness am I so delicately  nurtured and  ministered to?” It is to beseech and 
supplicate  the  Provider  of  Needs  through  the  tongue  of  impotence  and  poverty;  it  is  to 
seek  from  Him.  It  is  to  fly  to  the  high  station  of  worship  and  servitude  to  God  on  the 
wings of impotence and poverty. 

This means that man came to this world to be perfected by means of knowledge and 
supplication. In regard to his nature and abilities everything is tied to knowledge. And the 
foundation,  source,  light,  and  spirit  of  all  true  knowledge  is  knowledge  of  God,  and  its 
essence and basis is belief in God. 

Furthermore,  since  man  is  subject  to  endless  tribulations  and  afflicted  with 
innumerable  enemies  despite  his  boundless  impotence,  and  suffers  from  endless  needs 
and has innumerable desires despite his boundless poverty, after belief, his fundamental 
innate  duty  is  supplication.  As  for  supplication,  it  is  the  basis  of  worship  of  God  and 
servitude to Him. In order to secure a desire or wish he cannot obtain, a child will either 
cry  or  ask  for  it,  that  is,  he  will  supplicate  through  the  tongue  of  his  impotence  either 
actively or verbally, and will be successful in securing it. In the same way, man is like a 
delicate, petted child in the world of living creatures. He has to either weep at the Court 
of the Most Merciful and Compassionate One through his  

 

325 

weakness and impotence, or supplicate through his poverty and need, so that the things he 
wants  may  be  made  subject  to  him,  or  he  may  offer  thanks  for  their  being  made  so. 
Otherwise like a silly child who creates a fuss over a fly, saying: “With my own strength 
I  subjugate  things  it  is  not  possible  to  subjugate  and  things  a  thousand  times  more 
powerful, and I  make them obey  me through  my  own  ideas and  measures,”  he displays 
ingratitude  for  the  bounties.  And  just  as  this  is  contrary  to  man’s  innate  nature,  so  he 
makes himself deserving of severe punishment. 

FIFTH POINT 

Belief  necessitates  supplication  as  a  certain  means  of  securing  needs,  and  both 

human nature has an intense desire for it, and Almighty God decrees, 

Say:  My  Sustainer  would  not  concern  Himself  with  you  but  for  your 
supplication,6 

which  has  the  meaning  of:  What  importance  would  you  have  if  you  did  not  offer  Me 
supplications? He also commands: 

Call upon Me and I will answer you.7 

If  you  say:    We  frequently  offer  supplications,  but  they  are  not  accepted.  But  the 

verse is general, it states that every supplication is answered. 

The Answer:  To answer is one thing, to accept is something quite different. Every 
supplication is answered, but its being accepted and exactly what was sought being given 
is  dependent on  Almighty  God’s  wisdom.  For  example,  if  a  sick  child  calls  the  doctor, 
saying: “Doctor! Doctor!”, and he replies: “Here I am, what do you want?”, and the child 
says: “Give me that medicine!”, the doctor will either give him exactly what he asks for 
or something better and more beneficial for him. Or knowing that medicine is harmful for 
his illness, he will give him nothing.  

Thus,  since  Almighty  God  is  all-present  and  all-seeing,  He  responds  to  the 
supplications  of  His  servants.  Through  His  presence  and  response,  He  transforms  the 
desolation of loneliness and solitude into familiarity. But He does this, not in accordance 
with man’s capricious and importunate demands, but in accordance with the requirements 
of dominical wisdom; He gives either what is sought or what is better than it, or He gives 
nothing at all. 

Also, supplication  is  a  form of worship and recognition of  man’s  servitude to God. 
The fruits of this pertain to the hereafter. The aims pertaining to this world are the times 
of  a  particular  sort  of  supplication  and  worship.  For  example,  the  prayers  and 
supplications for rain are a form of worship.  

                                                

6 Qur’an, 25:77. 
7 Qur’an, 40:60. 

 

326 

Drought  is  the  time  for  such  worship.  Worship  and  supplications  of  this  sort  are  not  in 
order to bring rain. If they are performed with that intention alone they are not worthy of 
acceptance,  for they  are  not  sincere  worship.  Sunset  is  the  time  of  the  evening  prayers. 
And eclipses of the sun and moon are the times of two particular prayers known as salat 
al-kusuf and salat al-khusuf. That is to say, with the veiling of the two luminous signs of 
the  night  and  day,  God’s  tremendousness  is  proclaimed,  so  Almighty  God  calls  his 
servants to a sort of worship at those times. The prayers are not so that the sun and moon 
will be revealed (whose appearance and how long the eclipses will continue have anyway 
been reckoned by astronomers). 

In just the same way, drought is the time for the prayers for rain, and the visitation of 
calamities  and  infliction  of  harmful  things  the  times  of  certain  supplications  when  man 
realizes his impotence and through his supplication and entreaty seeks refuge at the Court 
of  One  Possessing  Absolute  Power.  Even  if  the  calamities  are  not  lifted  despite  many 
supplications, it may not be said that they were not accepted. It should rather be said that 
the time for the supplication is not yet over. If through His graciousness and munificence 
Almighty God removes the calamity, light upon light, then the time for that supplication 
is over and done with. That is to say, supplication has the meaning of worship and man’s 
acknowledging his servitude to God. 

As  for  worship  and  servitude  to  God,  it  should  be  purely  and  sincerely  for  God’s 
sake.  Man  should  only  proclaim  his  impotence  and  seek  refuge  with  Him  through 
supplication,  he  should  not  interfere  in  His  dominicality.  He  should  leave  the  taking  of 
measures to Him and rely on His wisdom. He should not accuse His Mercy.  

Indeed, what  is  in reality  established  by the Qur’an’s clear  verses  is that  just as all 
beings  offer  their  own  particular  glorification  and  worship,  so  what  rises  to  the  Divine 
Court  from  all  the  universe  is  supplication.  This  is  either  through  the  tongue  of  innate 
ability  like the  supplication of plants and animals, through which they  seek  forms  from 
the  Absolute  Bestower  and  to  display  and  manifest  His  Names.  Or  it  is  through  the 
tongue of innate need. These are the supplications for all their essential needs – beyond 
their  power  to  obtain  –  offered  by  animate  beings.  Through  this  tongue,  the  animate 
beings seek certain things from the Absolutely Generous One for the continuance of their 
lives,  like  a  sort  of  sustenance.  Or  it  is  supplication  through  the  tongue  of  exigency, 
through which all beings with spirits who find themselves in some plight or predicament 
make supplication and seek urgent refuge with an unknown protector; indeed, they turn to 
the  All-Compassionate  Sustainer.  If  there  is  nothing  to  prevent  it,  these  three  sorts  of 
supplication are always accepted. 

The  fourth  sort of  supplication  is  the  most  well-known;  it  is  our  supplication.  This 

too is of two sorts: one is active and by disposition, and the other,  

 

327 

verbal and with the heart. For example, having recourse to causes is an active prayer. To 
gather  together  causes  is  not  in  order  to  create  the  effect,  but  through  the  tongue  of 
disposition  to take  up  an  acceptable  position  in  order to  seek  the  effect  from  Almighty 
God. To plough a field is to knock at the door of the treasury of mercy. Since this sort of 
active supplication is directed towards the Absolutely Generous One’s Name and title, it 
is accepted in the great majority of cases. 

The  second  sort  is  to offer  supplication  with  the  tongue  and  the  heart.  It  is  to  seek 
certain  wishes  which  the  hand  cannot  reach.  The  most  important  aspect,  the  most 
beautiful  aim,  the  sweetest  fruit  of  this  is  this:  “The  one  who  offers  the  supplications 
knows that there is Someone  Who hears the wishes of his  heart, Whose hand can reach 
all things, Who can bring about each of his desires, Who takes pity on his impotence, and 
answers his poverty.” 

O impotent, needy man! Do not neglect a means like supplication, which is the key 
to the treasury of mercy and to an inexhaustible strength. Cling to it! Rise to the highest 
peaks  of  humanity!  Include  in  your  supplications  those of  all  the  universe,  like  a  king! 
Say,  “From You alone do  we  seek help,”8  like a servant and deputy representing all the 
universe! Be on the Most Excellent Pattern of creation! 

                                                

8 Qur’an, 1:4.

Second Chapter 

INCLUDING FIVE REMARKS WITH RESPECT TO 
MAN’S HAPPINESS AND MISERY 

 [Since man has been created on the most excellent of patterns and has been given 
most  comprehensive  abilities,  he  has  been  cast  into  an  arena  of  trial  and 
examination in which he may rise or fall to stations, ranks, and degrees from the 
lowest of the low to the highest of the high, from the earth to the Divine Throne, 
and from minute particles to the sun. He has been sent to this world as a miracle 
of Divine Power, the result of creation, and a wonder of Divine art before whom 
have been  opened two roads leading  either to  infinite  ascent or infinite descent. 
We shall explain the mystery of this awesome progress and decline of man’s in 
five ‘Remarks’.] 

FIRST REMARK 

Man stands in need of most of the varieties of beings in the universe and is connected 
to  them.  His  needs  spread  through  every  part  of  the  world,  and  his  desires  extend  to 
eternity. As he wants a flower, so he wants the spring. As he desires a garden, so does he 
also desire everlasting Paradise.  As  he  longs to see a  friend, so does he  long to see the 
All-Beauteous One of Glory. Just as in order to visit one he loves who lives somewhere 
else, he is in need for his beloved’s door to be opened to him, so too in order to visit the 
ninety-nine per cent of his friends who have travelled to the intermediate realm and so be 
saved  from  eternal  separation,  he  needs  to  seek  refuge  at  the  court  of  an  Absolutely 
Powerful One. For it is He Who will close the door of this huge world and open the door 
of the hereafter, which  is an exhibition of wonders, remove this world and establish the 
hereafter in its place. 

Thus for man in this position the only True Object of Worship will be One in Whose 
hand are the reins of all things, with Whom are the treasuries of all things, Who sees all 
things, and is present everywhere, Who is beyond space, exempt from impotence, free of 
fault, and far above all defect; an All-Powerful One of Glory, an All-Compassionate One 
of Beauty, an All-Wise One of Perfection. 

 

329 

O  man,  if  you  are  the  slave  of  Him  alone,  you  will  earn  a  place  superior  to  all 
creatures. But if  you  hold  back  from this servitude to Him,  you will  become an abased 
slave  to  impotent  creatures.  If  you  rely  on  your  ego  and  own  power  and  abandoning 
reliance on God and supplication, deviate into pride and boasting, then you will fall lower 
than an ant or bee in regard to goodness and creation, and become weaker than a spider or 
a  fly.  You  will  become  heavier  than  a  mountain  in  regard  to  evil  and  destruction,  and 
more harmful than a pestilence. 

Yes, O man! You have two aspects: one is that of creation, good, acts, and positivity. 
The  other  is  the  aspect  of  destruction,  non-existence,  evil,  negativity,  and  passivity.  In 
regard to the first aspect, you are lower than a bee or sparrow, and weaker than a spider 
or  fly.  Whereas  in  regard  to  the  second  aspect,  you  surpass  the  mountains,  earth,  and 
skies; you take on a burden before which they expressed their impotence and from which 
they  shrank,  and  you  assume  a  sphere  more  extensive  and  vaster  than  them.  For  when 
you create and do good, you are able to do so only to the extent of your own power and 
strength  and  to  the  degree  your  hand  can  reach.  But  when  you  commit  evil  and 
destruction, then your evil overwhelms and your destruction spreads. 

For  example,  unbelief  is  an  evil,  a  destruction,  an  absence  of  affirmation.  But  that 
single  evil  comprises  insulting  the  whole  universe,  belittling  all  the  Divine  Names,  and 
abusing all humanity. For these beings have elevated positions and important duties; they 
are dominical missives, Divine mirrors, and Divine officials. But unbelief dismisses them 
from their rank of being mirrors, officials charged with duties, and bearing meanings, and 
reduces them to the level of futility and being the playthings of chance. And through the 
destruction  of  death  and  separation,  it  lowers  them  to  the  degree  of  being  swiftly 
decaying  ephemeral  matter  lacking  all  importance  and  value,  to  being  nothing.  So  too 
through denial it insults the Divine Names, the inscriptions, manifestations, and beauties 
of which are to be seen throughout the universe and in the mirrors of beings. And it casts 
down to a position more abased and weaker, more powerless and needy than the lowliest 
transient animal the one who holds the rank of vicegerent of the earth, known as man. For 
man  is  a  well-composed  ode  of  wisdom  proclaiming  the  manifestations  of  the  Sacred 
Divine  Names,  and  a  seed-like  self-evident  miracle  of  Divine  power  containing  all  the 
members of an eternal tree, and who, with assuming the  ‘Supreme Trust,’ rose to being 
higher  than  the  earth,  sky  and  mountains  and  gained  superiority  over  the  angels.  It 
reduces  him  to the  level  of  being  a  common  sign-board  lacking  all  meaning,  confused, 
and swiftly decaying. 

In Short: In regard to destruction and evil, the  evil-commanding soul  may  commit 

infinite crimes, but concerning creativity and good, its power is  

 

330 

extremely little and partial. Yes, he may destroy a house  in one day, while it cannot be 
built  in  a  hundred. However,  if the  soul gives up egoism and seeks good and existence 
from Divine assistance, and if it foregoes evil and destruction and relying on the soul, and 
seeking forgiveness becomes a true slave of God’s, then it will manifest the meaning of 
the verse, 

God will change their evil into good.9 

Its infinite capacity for evil will be transformed into an infinite capacity for good. It will 
acquire the value of the Most Excellent of Patterns and ascend to the highest of the high. 

O  heedless  man!  See  Almighty  God’s  munificence  and  generosity!  Although  it 
would be justice to record one evil as a thousand and a single good deed as one or not at 
all,  He  records  a  single  evil  as  one,  and  a  single  good  deed  as  ten,  and  sometimes  as 
seventy  or  seven  hundred,  or  even  sometimes  as  seven  thousand.  You  will  also 
understand  from this Remark that to be sent to Hell, which  is so dreadful,  is retribution 
for the deed and pure justice, while to be sent to Paradise is pure generosity. 

SECOND REMARK 

Man has two faces: one, concerning his ego, looks to the life of this world. The other, 
concerning worship and servitude to God, looks to eternal life. In respect to the first face 
he is a wretched creature whose capital consists only of the following: of will he has only 
a partial  power of  choice  like a  hair; of power, a weak  ability to acquire; of  life, a  fast 
dying flame; of a life-span, a fleeting brief spell; and of being, a swiftly decaying small 
body.  Together  with  this,  he  is  one  delicate,  weak  individual  out  of  the  innumerable 
individuals  of  the  numberless  varieties  of  beings  dispersed  through  the  levels  of  the 
universe. 

In  respect  of  the  second  face  and  especially  his  impotence  and  poverty,  which  are 
turned  towards  worship,  man  has  truly  great  breadth  and  vast  importance.  For  the  All-
Wise Creator has included in man’s nature an infinitely vast impotence and boundlessly 
huge  poverty,  so  that  he  can  be  an  extensive  mirror  containing  the  innumerable 
manifestations  of  an  All-Powerful  and  Compassionate  One  Whose  power  is  infinite,  an 
All-Generous All-Rich One Whose wealth is boundless. 

Indeed,  man  resembles  a  seed.  This  seed  has  been  given  significant  immaterial 
members by Divine power and a subtle, valuable programme by Divine Determining, so 
that  it  may  work  beneath  the  ground,  and  emerging  from  that  narrow  world,  enter  the 
broad  world  of  the  air,  and  asking  its  Creator  with  the  tongue  of  its  disposition  to  be  a 
tree, find a perfection worthy of  

                                                

9 Qur’an, 25:70. 

 

331 

it. If, due to bad temperament, the seed uses the immaterial members given it in attracting 
certain harmful substances under the ground, in a short time it will rot and decay in that 
narrow place without benefit. But if the seed conforms to the creational command of, 

God is the Splitter of the seed-grain and date-stone10 

and employs well those immaterial members, it will emerge from that narrow world, and 
through  becoming  a  large  fruit-bearing  tree,  its  tiny  particular  reality  and  its  spirit  will 
take on the form of an extensive universal reality. 

Similarly,  significant  members  and  valuable  programmes  have  been  deposited  in 
man’s  nature by Divine power and determining. If  man uses those  immaterial  members 
on  the  desires  of  his  soul  and  on  minor  pleasures  under  the  soil  of  worldly  life  in  the 
narrow  confines  of  this  earthly  world,  he  will  decay  and  decompose  in  the  midst  of 
difficulties  in  a  brief  life  in  a  constricted  place  like  the  rotted  seed,  and  load  the 
responsibility on his unfortunate spirit, then depart from this world. 

If, however, he nurtures the seed of his abilities with the water of Islam and light of 
belief under the soil of worship and servitude to God, conforms to the commands of the 
Qur’an,  and  turns  his  faculties  towards their  true  aims,  they  will  produce  branches  and 
buds in the World of Similitudes and the Intermediate Realm; he will be a seed of great 
value  and  a  shining  machine  containing  the  members  of  an  everlasting  tree  and 
permanent  truth  which  will  be  the  means  to  innumerable  perfections  and  bounties  in 
Paradise. And he will be a blessed and luminous fruit of the tree of the universe. 

Yes,  true  progress  is  to  turn  the  faces  of  the  heart,  spirit,  intellect,  and  even  the 
imagination and other subtle faculties given to man towards eternal life and for each to be 
occupied with the particular duty of worship worthy of it. Progress is not as the people of 
misguidance imagine, to plunge into the life of this world in all its minute details and in 
order  to  taste  every  sort  of  pleasure,  even  the  basest,  make  subject  to  the  evil-
commanding soul all the subtle faculties and the heart and intellect, and make them assist 
it; to do this is not progress, it is decline. I saw this fact in a vision which is described in 
the following comparison: 

I was entering a large town when I looked and saw it was full of large palaces. At the 
doors of some of these palaces was merry-making like a brilliant theatre; it captured and 
held everyone’s attention and was entertaining them. I looked carefully and saw that the 
lord of such a palace had come to the door; he was playing with a dog and assisting the 
merry-making.  The  ladies  were  indulging  in  sweet  conversation  with  ill-mannered 
youths. Grown-up girls were organizing the children’s games. And the doorkeeper  

                                                

10 Qur’an, 6:95. 

 

332 

had taken the role of directing the others. I then realized that the inside of the huge palace 
was  completely  empty.  Its  refined  duties  all  remained  undone.  The  morals  of  its 
inhabitants had declined so that they had taken on these roles at the door. 

I passed on until I came to another large palace. I saw that there was a faithful dog 
stretched  out  at the  door  and  a  stern  and  taciturn  doorkeeper;  it  had  an  undistinguished 
appearance. I was curious: why was the other the way it was and this palace like this? I 
went  inside. Then I  saw that the  inside was  very  merry.  Apartment over apartment, the 
people  of  the  palace  were  busy  with  their  different  refined  duties.  The  men  in  the  first 
apartment were overseeing the administration and running of the palace. In the apartment 
over that, girls were teaching the children. Above that the ladies were occupied with fine 
arts and beautiful embroideries. And on the top floor, the lord was exchanging news with 
the  king,  and  was  busy  with  his  own  elevated  duties  in  order  to  maintain  the  peoples’ 
tranquillity and his own attainments and progress. They did not stop me since I was not 
visible to them, and I  was able to wander around. Then I came out and  looked around: 
everywhere in the town were these two sorts of palaces. I asked about this and they told 
me: “The palaces where there is merry-making at the door and whose insides are empty 
belong to the foremost of the unbelievers and people of misguidance. The others belong 
to honourable Muslim notables.” Then in one corner I came across a palace on which was 
written  my  name,  SAID.  I  was  curious.  I  looked more  closely  and  I  as  though  saw  my 
image on it. Calling out in utter bewilderment, I came to my senses and awoke. 

And now I shall interpret this vision for you. May God cause good to come of it. 
The  town  was  human  social  life  and  the  city  of  man’s  civilization.  Each  of  the 
palaces  was a  human  being. The people of the palaces  were the  subtle  faculties  in  man 
like the eyes, ears, heart, inner heart, spirit, intellect, and things like the soul and caprice, 
and powers of lust and anger. Each of man’s faculties has a different duty of worship, and 
different pleasures and pains. The soul and caprice and powers of lust and anger are like 
the doorkeeper and the dog. Thus, to make the elevated subtle faculties subject to the soul 
and  caprice  and  make  them  forget their  fundamental  duties  is  certainly  decline  and  not 
progress. You can interpret the rest for yourself. 

THIRD REMARK 

In  regard  to  his  acts  and  deeds  and  his  labour  man  is  a  weak  animal,  an  impotent 
creature. The extent of his power of disposal and ownership in this respect is so narrow 
that it is no greater than as far as his hand can reach. Domestic animals, even, the reins of 
which have been given to man, have each taken a share of his weakness, impotence, and 
laziness, so that if they  

 

333 

are compared with their wild counterparts, a great difference is apparent. (Like domestic 
goats  and  cattle,  and  wild  goats  and  cattle).  But  in  regard  to  passivity,  acceptance, 
supplication, and entreaty, man is an honoured traveller in this hostel of the world. He is 
the guest of One so generous that infinite treasuries of  mercy  have  been opened to him 
and innumerable unique beings and servants subjugated to him. And a sphere so large has 
been prepared for this guest’s recreation, amusement, and benefit that half its diameter is 
as long and broad as the imagination can stretch. 

Thus,  if  man  relies  on  his  ego,  and  making  worldly  life  his  goal,  attempts  to  taste 
temporary pleasures while  struggling to  make  his  living,  he  becomes submerged within 
an  extremely  constricted  sphere,  then  departs.  All  the  members,  systems,  and  faculties 
given  him  will  testify  against  him  at the  resurrection  and  will  bring  a  suit  against  him. 
Whereas  if  he knows himself to be a guest and  spends the  capital of  his  life within the 
sphere of permission of the Generous One of Whom he is the guest, he will strive for a 
long, eternal life within a broad sphere, then take his rest and ease. And later, he may rise 
to the highest of the high. 

Moreover,  all  the  members  and  systems  given  to  man  will  be  happy  with  him  and 
testify in favour of him in the hereafter. For sure, all the wonderful faculties given to men 
were  not  for  this  insignificant  worldly  life,  but  for  an  everlasting  life  of  great 
significance.  For  if  we  compare  man  with  the  animals,  we  see  that  man  is  very  rich  in 
regard to  faculties  and  members,  a  hundred  times  more  so than  the  animals.  But  in  the 
pleasures  of  worldly  life  and  in  animal  life  he  falls  a  hundred  times  lower.  For  in  each 
pleasure he receives is the trace of thousands of pains. The pains of the past and fears of 
the future and the pain at each pleasure’s passing spoil the enjoyment to had from them, 
and leave a trace in the pleasure. But animals are not like that. They receive pleasure with 
no  pains.  They  take  enjoyment  with  no  sorrow.  Neither  the  sorrows  of  the  past  cause 
them suffering, nor the fears of the future distress them. They live peacefully, and offer 
thanks to their Creator. 

This means that if man, who is created on the most excellent of patterns, restricts his 
thought  to  the  life  of  this  world,  he  falls  a  hundred  times  lower  than  a  creature  like  a 
sparrow, although he is higher than the animals. I explained this fact in another place by 
means of a comparison. It is related to this, so I shall repeat it here. It was like this: 

A  man  gave  one  of  his  servants  ten  pieces  of  gold  and  told  him  to  have  a  suit  of 
clothes  made  in  a  particular  cloth.  Then  to  a  second  one,  he  gave  a  thousand  pieces  of 
gold, and putting in the servant’s pocket a note on which certain things were written, sent 
him to a market. The first servant bought an excellent suit of the finest cloth with the ten 
pieces  of  gold.  While  the  second  servant  did  not  use  his  head,  and  looking  at  the  first 
servant  and  not  reading  the  account-note  in  his  pocket,  he  gave  the  thousand  pieces  of 
gold to a shop 

 

334 

keeper and asked  for a suit of clothes. The dishonest shopkeeper gave  him  a suit of the 
very  worst-quality  cloth.  Then  the  wretched  servant  returned  to  his  lord  and  received  a 
severe reprimand and a terrible punishment. 

Thus,  even  the  most  unintelligent  will  understand  that  the  thousand  pieces  of  gold 

given the second servant were not to buy a suit of clothes, but for some important trade. 

In  just  the  same  way,  each  of  the  immaterial  members  and  subtle  faculties  in  man 
have expanded to a degree a hundred times greater than that of the animals. For example, 
consider  faculties  and  members  like  man’s  eyes,  which  can  discern  all  the  degrees  of 
beauty,  and  his  sense  of  taste,  which  can  distinguish  all  the  varieties  of  the  particular 
tastes of foods, and his mind, which can penetrate to all the subtlest points of reality, and 
his  heart,  which  yearns  for  every  sort  of  perfection,  and  then  consider  the  extremely 
simple members of the animals which have developed only one or two degrees. There is 
just this difference, that in animals a member particular to some function and special to a 
particular species develops more. But this development is particular. 

The reason for man’s wealth in regard to faculties is this: by reason of the mind and 
thought, man’s senses and feelings have greatly developed and expanded. And numerous 
emotions  have come  into being  because of the  multiplicity of his  needs. And  his senses 
have  become  extremely  diverse.  And  because  of  the  comprehensiveness  of  his  nature, 
desires  have  appeared  turned  towards  numerous  aims.  And  because  he  has  numerous 
duties due to his nature, his members and faculties have expanded greatly. And since he 
has been created with a nature capable of performing every sort of worship, he has been 
given abilities which embrace the seeds of all perfections. 

Thus, this great wealth in faculties and abundant capital was certainly not given for 
procuring this temporary worldly life. Rather, man’s fundamental duty is to perform his 
duties, which look to innumerable aims; and proclaim his impotence, poverty, and faults 
in the form of worship; and observing the glorifications of beings with a universal eye, to 
bear witness to them; and seeing the instances of the assistance of the Most Merciful One, 
to offer thanks; and gazing on the miracles of dominical power in beings, to contemplate 
on them as objects from which lessons may be drawn. 

O  man who worships this world,  is the  lover of  worldly  life, and  is  heedless of the 
meaning of ‘the most excellent of patterns’! The Old Said saw the reality of worldly life 
in  a  vision.  It transformed  him  into the  New  Said.  You too  listen  to  it  in  the  form  of  a 
comparison: 

I  saw  that  I  was  a  traveller  and  was  going  on  a  long  journey;  that  is  to  say,  I  was 
being  sent.  The  one  who  was  my  lord  gradually  gave  me  some  of  the  money  from  the 
sixty gold pieces he had allotted me. I spent them, and came  

 

335 

to a hostel where there were amusements of all kinds. In one night in that hostel I spent 
ten pieces of gold on gambling, amusements, and the enjoyment of fame. In the morning 
I had no money left. Moreover I had done no trade nor bought any goods for the place I 
was  going.  All  that  remained  to  me  from  the  money  were  sins  and  pains,  and  from  the 
amusements, wounds and sorrow. While in that sorry state, a man suddenly appeared. He 
said to me: 

“You  have  wasted  all  your  capital  and  deserve  punishment.  You  are  going  to  your 
destination bankrupt and with your hands empty. But if you have any sense, the door of 
repentance is open. When you receive the fifteen pieces of gold that remain to you, keep 
half  of  them  in  reserve.  That  is,  obtain  the  things  necessary  for  you  in  the  place  where 
you are going.” 

I looked, my soul did not agree to this. 
So he said: “A third, then.” 
My soul still did not obey him. 
Then he said: “A quarter.” 
My  soul  could  not  give  up  the  habits  to  which  it  was  addicted,  so the  man  angrily 

turned his back on me and left. 

Suddenly, the scene changed. I was in a train in a tunnel, which was travelling fast as 
though  downwards  vertically.  I  took  fright.  But  what  could  I  do,  there  was  no  escape 
anywhere. Strangely, attractive flowers and enticing fruits appeared on both sides of the 
train.  And  I,  like  the  foolish  and  inexperienced,  looked  at  them  and  stretching  out  my 
hand, tried to pick them. But they were covered  in thorns  and tore at my  hands when I 
touched  them  making  them  bleed.  With  the  movement  of  the  train,  my  hands  were 
lacerated at being parted from them. They cost me much. Suddenly a porter on the train 
said: 

“Give me five kurush and I shall give you as much of the flowers and fruits as you 
want. You are caused the loss of a hundred kurush with your hands being torn, rather than 
five kurush. Also there is a penalty; you cannot pick them without permission.” 

In distress I put my head out of the window and looked ahead to see when the tunnel 
would end. I saw that in place of the tunnel’s entrance were numerous holes. People were 
being thrown into them from the long train. I saw a hole opposite me. On either side of it 
was  a  gravestone.  I  looked  in  amazement.  I  saw that  written  on  one  of  the  gravestones 
was  the  name  SAID.  In  my  bewilderment  and  anxiety  I  exclaimed:  “Alas!”  Then 
suddenly I heard the voice of the man who had given me advice at the door of the hostel. 
He asked: 

“Have you come to your senses?” 

 

336 

I replied: “Yes, but it is too late now.” 
So he said: “Repent and place your trust in God.” 
I replied that I would. Then I awoke and saw myself as the New Said; the Old Said 

had disappeared. 

So, that was the vision. May God cause good to come of  it! I shall  interpret one or 

two parts of it, then you can interpret the rest for yourself. 

The  journey  was  the  journey  which  passes  from  the  World  of  Spirits,  through  the 
mother’s womb, youth, old age, the grave, the Intermediate Realm, the resurrection, and 
the Bridge of Sirat towards eternity. The sixty pieces of gold were the sixty years of life. I 
reckoned I saw the vision when I was forty-five years old. I had nothing to guarantee it, 
but a sincere student of the All-Wise Qur’an advised me to spend half of the fifteen that 
remained to me on the hereafter. The hostel for me was Istanbul. The train was time, and 
each year a carriage. As for the tunnel, it was the life of this world. The thorny flowers 
and  fruits  were  illicit  pleasures  and  forbidden  amusements  which  cause  pain  while 
indulging  in  them  on  thinking  of  their  passing,  and  on  separation  lacerate  the  heart, 
making it bleed. They also cause a punishment to be inflicted. The porter on the train told 
me to give him five kurush so that he would give me as many as I wanted. 

The meaning of this is as follows: the pleasures and enjoyment man receives through 
licit striving within the sphere of what is lawful are sufficient for him. No need remains 
to enter the unlawful. You may interpret the rest for yourself. 

FOURTH REMARK 

Man resembles a delicate and petted child in the universe. There is a great strength in 
his  weakness  and  great  power  in  his  impotence.  For  it  is  through  the  strength  of  his 
weakness  and  power  of  his  impotence  that  beings  have  been  subjected  to  him.  If  man 
understands his weakness and offers supplications verbally and by state and conduct, and 
recognizes his impotence and seeks help, since he has offered thanks by exhibiting them, 
he achieves his aims and his desires are subjugated to him in a way far exceeding what he 
could  achieve  with  his  own  power.  Only,  he  sometimes  wrongly  attributes  to  his  own 
power the attainment of a wish that has been obtained for him through the supplications 
offered  by the tongue of  his disposition. For example, the strength in the weakness of a 
chick causes the  mother hen to attack a lion. And  its newly-born  lion cub subjugates to 
itself the savage and hungry lioness, leaving the mother hungry and the cub full. See this 
strength in weakness and manifestation of Divine mercy, which are worthy of notice! 

Just as through crying or asking or looking unhappy, a child subjugates the strong to 

himself, and is so successful in getting what he wants that he  

 

337 

could not obtain one thousandth of it with a thousand times his own strength. That is to 
say, since weakness and impotence excite compassion and a sense of protection towards 
him, the child can subjugate heroes to himself with his tiny  finger. Now, should such  a 
child  with  foolish  conceit  deny  the  compassion  and  accuse  the  protection  saying:  “I 
subjugate these with my own strength”, of course he will receive a slap.  

In the same way, if, like Qarun, man says: 

I have been given it on account of the knowledge I have,11 

that  is,  “I  gained  this  through  my  own  knowledge  and  my  own  power”  in  a  way  that 
demonstrates ingratitude and denies his Creator’s mercy and accuses His wisdom, he will 
of  course  deserve  a  punishing  blow.  This  means  that  man’s  domination  and  human 
advances and the attainments of civilization, which are to be observed, have been  made 
subject to him not through his attracting them or conquering them or through combat, but 
due  to  his  weakness.  He  has  been  assisted  because  of  his  impotence.  They  have  been 
bestowed  on  him  due  to  his  indigence.  He  has  been  inspired  with  them  due  to  his 
ignorance. They have been given him due to his need. And the reason for his domination 
is  not  strength  and  the  power  of  knowledge,  but  the  compassion  and  clemency  of  the 
Sustainer and Divine mercy and wisdom: they have subjugated things to him. Yes, what 
clothes man, who is defeated by vermin like eyeless scorpions and legless snakes, in silk 
from a tiny worm and feeds him honey from a poisonous insect is not his own power, but 
the  subjugation  of  the  Sustainer  and  the  bestowal  of  the  Most  Merciful,  which  are  the 
fruits of his weakness. 

O man! Since the reality of the matter is thus, give up egotism and arrogance. With 
the tongue of seeking  help proclaim  your  impotence  and weakness at the Divine  Court, 
and with the tongue of entreaty and supplication, your poverty and need. Show that you 
are His slave. Say: 

God is enough for us, for He is the Best Disposer of Affairs,12 

and rise in degree. 

Also, do not say: “I am nothing. What importance do I have that the universe should 
purposefully be made subject to me by an Absolutely All-Wise One, and universal thanks 
required  of  me?”  Because  for  sure  you  are  as though  nothing  with  respect  to  your  soul 
and form, but from the point of view of duty and rank, you are an observant spectator of 
this majestic universe, an eloquent, articulate tongue of these beings so full of wisdom, a 
discerning reader of this book of the universe, a supervisor of these creatures  

                                                

11 Qur’an, 28:78. 
12 Qur’an, 3:173. 

 

338 

full of wonder at their glorifications, and like a foreman of these beings full of respect for 
their worship. 

Yes, O  man! In regard to your vegetable physical being and animal  soul,  you are a 
deaf particle, a contemptible atom, a needy creature, a weak animal, who, tossed on the 
awesome waves of the flood of beings, is departing. But being perfected through the light 
of belief, which comprises the radiance of Divine love, and through the training of Islam, 
which is enlightened, in regard to humanity and servitude to God, you are a king, and a 
universal  within  particularity,  and  within  your  insignificance,  a  world,  and  within  your 
contemptibility,  a  supervisor  of  such  high  rank  and  extensive  sphere  that  you  can  say: 
“My  Compassionate  Sustainer  has  made  the  world  a  house  for  me,  the  sun  and  moon 
lamps for it, and the spring, a bunch of flowers for me, and summer, a table of bounties, 
and  the  animals,  He  has  made  my  servants.  And  He  has  made  plants  the  decorated 
furnishings of my house.” 

To conclude: If you heed Satan and your soul, you will fall to the lowest of the low. 
But if you heed Truth and the Qur’an, you will rise to the highest of the high and become 
the Most Excellent Pattern of the universe. 

FIFTH REMARK 

Man has been sent to this world as an official and guest, and has been given abilities 
of great significance. And he has been entrusted with important duties in accordance with 
those  abilities.  In  order  to  employ  man  in  fulfilling  those  aims  and  duties,  powerful 
encouragement  and  severe  threats  have  been  made.  We  shall  here  summarize  the 
fundamentals  of  worship  and  of  man’s  duties,  which  we  have  explained  at  length 
elsewhere, so that the mystery of ‘the Most Excellent of Patterns’ may be understood. 

On  coming  into the  universe  man  has  two  aspects  of  worship  and  being  a  slave  of 
God’s. One is worship and contemplation in the absence of the Object of Worship. The 
other is worship and supplication in His presence and addressing Him directly. 

First Aspect: It is to affirm submissively the sovereignty of dominicality apparent in 

the universe and to observe its perfections and virtues in wonder. 

Then it is to proclaim and herald the unique arts which consist of the inscriptions of 

the Sacred Divine Names and to display them to others. 

Then  it  is to weigh on the  scales of perception the  jewels of the dominical Names, 
which  are  all  like  hidden  treasures;  it  is  to  appreciatively  affirm  their  value  with  the 
discerning heart. 

Then it is to study and ponder over in wonder the pages of beings and leaves of the 

earth and sky, which are like missives of the pen of power. 

Then through beholding admiringly the adornment and subtle arts in beings, it is to 

feel love for knowledge of their All-Beauteous Creator, and to  

 

339 

yearn to ascend to the presence of their All-Perfect Maker and to receive His favours. 

Second Aspect: This is the station of presence and address wherein man passes from 
the work to the producer of the work and he sees that an All-Beauteous Maker wants to 
make  himself  known  and  acquainted  through  the  miracles  of  His  art,  and  he  responds 
with knowledge and belief. 

Then  he  sees  that  an  All-Compassionate  Sustainer  wants  to  make  himself  loved 
through the fine fruits of His mercy. So confining his love and worship to Him, he makes 
himself love Him. 

Then  he  sees  that  an  All-Generous  Bestower  is  nurturing  him  with  the  delights  of 
bounties material and immaterial, and in return he offers Him thanks and praise with his 
actions, conduct, words, and as far as he can, with all his senses and faculties. 

Then  he  sees  that  an  All-Beauteous  and  Glorious  One  is  announcing  His 
tremendousness and perfections, and glory and beauty in the mirrors of these beings, and 
is drawing attentive gazes to them. So in response he declares: “God is Most Great! Glory 
be to God!”, and in humility prostrates in love and wonder. 

Then he sees that a Possessor of Absolute Riches is displaying His boundless wealth 
and treasuries amid an absolute munificence. So in response, exalting and praising Him, 
he entreats and asks for them, expressing his utter need. 

Then  he  sees  that  the  All-Glorious  Creator  has  made  the  face  of  the  earth  like  an 
exhibition and displayed on it all His antique works of art. So in response he exclaims in 
appreciation: “What wonders God has willed!”, and in admiration: “What blessings God 
has bestowed!”, and in wonder: “Glory be to God!”, and in astonishment: “God is Most 
Great!” 

Then he sees that in His palace of the universe a Single One of Unity has struck seals 
of  unity  on  all  beings  with  His  inimitable  signature,  and  with  His  stamps,  signets,  and 
cyphers  particular  to  Him;  that  He  inscribes  the  signs  of  His  unity;  and  planting  the 
banner  of  unity  in  every  region  of  the  world,  He  proclaims  His  dominicality.  And  he 
responds with assent, belief, submission, worship, and affirmation of His unity. 

Thus,  through  worship  and  contemplation  of  this  kind  he  becomes  a  true  man.  He 
shows that he is on the Most Excellent of Patterns. Through the auspiciousness of belief 
he becomes a reliable vicegerent of the earth worthy of bearing the Trust. 

O heedless man created on the Most Excellent of Patterns, who, through the misuse 
of  his  will  is  descending  to  the  lowest  of  the  low!  Listen  to  me!  In  the  heedlessness 
induced  by the  intoxication of  youth I, like  you, thought the world was  fine and  lovely. 
Then the moment I awoke in the morning of  

 

340 

old age, I saw how ugly was the world’s face that was not turned towards the hereafter, 
which  I  had  previously  imagined  to  be  beautiful.  To  see this  and  how  beautiful  was  its 
true  face,  which  looks  to  the  hereafter,  you  may  refer  to  the  two  ‘Signboards’  in  the 
Second Station of the Seventeenth Word, and see for yourself. 

The First Signboard depicts the reality of the world of the people of neglect, which 
long  ago,  like  the  people  of  misguidance,  I  saw  through  the  veil  of  heedlessness,  but 
without being intoxicated. 

The Second Signboard indicates the reality of the worlds of the people of guidance. I 

left it in the form it was written long ago. It resembles poetry, but it is not truly that... 

Glory be unto You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught us; 
indeed You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.13 

O My Sustainer! Expand for me my breast * Make easy for me my affair * And 
loosen the knot on my tongue * That they may understand my words.14 

O God! Grant blessings to the subtle unitary Muhammadan essence, the Sun in 
the skies of mysteries and manifestation of lights, the centre of the orbit of glory 
and  the  pole  of  the  sphere  of  beauty.  O  God!  By  his  mystery  in  Your  presence 
and  by  his  journeying  to  You,  succour  my  fear,  and  right  my  stumbling,  and 
dispel my grief and my greed, and be mine, and take me from myself to Yourself, 
and bestow on me annihilation from myself, and do not make me captivated by 
my soul and veiled by my senses, and reveal to  me all hidden secrets, O Ever-
Living and Self-Subsistent One! O Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One! O Ever-
Living and Self-Subsistent One! And grant mercy to me and to my companions 
and  to  the  people  of  belief  and  the  Qur’an.  Amen.  O  Most  Merciful  of  the 
Merciful and Most Generous of the Generous!  

And the close of their prayer will be: All Praise be to God, the Sustainer of All 
the Worlds.

The Twenty-Fourth Word 

 [This  Word  consists  of  five  ‘Branches’.  Study  the  Fourth  Branch  carefully. 
And hold on to the Fifth Branch and climb it, then pluck its fruits!] 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
God, there is no god but He; His are the Most Beautiful Names.1 

We shall indicate five branches of one of the many truths from the luminous tree of 

this glorious verse. 

FIRST BRANCH 

A sultan has different titles in the spheres of his government, and different styles and 
attributes among the classes of his subjects, and different names and signs in the levels of 
his rule, for example, Just Judge in the judiciary, Sultan in the civil service, Commander-
in-Chief in the army, and Caliph in the learned establishment. If, making an analogy with 
these, you know the rest of his names and titles, you will understand that a single sultan 
may  possess  a  thousand  names  and  titles  in  the  spheres  of  his  rule  and  levels  of 
government.  It  is  as  if,  through  his  corporate  personality  and  telephone,  the  ruler  is 
present  and  knowing  in  every  sphere;  and  through  his  laws  and  regulations  and 
representatives, sees and is seen; and behind the veil in every degree, disposes and sees, 
governs and observes through his decree, knowledge, and power. 

It is exactly the same for the Sustainer of All the Worlds, Who is the Ruler of Pre-
Eternity  and  Post-Eternity;  in  the  degrees  of  His  dominicality  He  has  attributes  and 
designations which are all different but which  look to each other; and  in the spheres of 
His Godhead He has  names and  marks which are all different but which are one within 
the other; and in His magnificent activities He has representations and appellations which 
are all different but which resemble each other; and in the disposals of His power He  

                                                

1 Qur’an, 20:8. 

 

342 

has titles which are all different but which hint of one another; and in the manifestations 
of His attributes He  has sacred appearances which are all different but which show one 
another;  and  in  the  displays  of  His  acts  He  has  wise  disposals  which  are  of  numerous 
sorts  but  which  complete  one  another;  and  in  His  multicoloured  art  and  varieties  of 
creatures, He has splendid aspects of dominicality which are all different but which look 
to one another. And together with this, in every world, in every realm of beings, the title 
of one of the Most Beautiful Names is manifested. In each sphere one Name is dominant 
and the other Names are subordinate to it, rather, they are there on account of it. 

Furthermore,  in  every  level  of  beings,  many  or  few,  great  or  small,  particular  or 
general,  He  has  an  appearance  through  a  particular  manifestation,  a  particular 
dominicality, a particular Name. That is to say, although the Name in question is general 
and  encompasses  everything,  it  is  turned  towards  a  thing  with  such  intention  and 
importance  that  it  is  as  if  it  is  special  to  that  thing  alone.  Moreover,  although  the  All-
Glorious Creator is close to everything, there are almost seventy thousand luminous veils 
obscuring Him. You can compare how many veils there are from the particular degree of 
creativity of the Name of Creator which is manifested on you to the greatest degree and 
supreme title which is Creator of all the universe. That means, on condition you leave the 
whole universe  behind  you,  from the door of creativity  you  may reach the  limits of the 
Name of Creator and draw close to the sphere of attributes. 

The  veils  have  windows  which  look  to  one  another,  and  the  Names  appear  one 
within the other, and the acts look to one another, and the similitudes enter one within the 
other, and the titles hint of one another, and the manifestations resemble each other, and 
the  disposals  assist  and  complete  one  another,  and  the  various  dispositions  of 
dominicality help and assist one another. It surely therefore necessitates not denying the 
other titles, acts, and degrees of dominicality when Almighty God is known through one 
of His Names, titles, or degrees of dominicality. Indeed, it is harmful if a transition is not 
made from the manifestation of any one Name to the others. For example, if the works of 
the  Names  of  All-Powerful  and  Creator  are  seen,  and  not the  Name  of  All-Knowing,  a 
person may fall into heedlessness and the misguidance of nature. He should always keep 
in view and recite: “He!” and: “He is God!” He should listen, and hear from everything: 
“Say,  He  is  God,  the  One!”  His  tongue  should  utter  and  proclaim:  “All  the  world 
declares: There is no god but He!” Thus, through the decree of God, There is no god but 
He;  His  are  the  Most  Beautiful  Names,  the  Qur’an  points  to  these  truths  we  have 
mentioned. 

If you want to observe these elevated truths from close to, go and ask a stormy sea or 

the quaking earth: “What are you saying?” You will hear that  

 

343 

they are saying: “O Glorious One! O Glorious One! O One of Might, All-Compelling!” 
Then ask the small animals and their young being raised with kindness and compassion in 
the  sea  and  on  the  land:  “What  are  you  saying?”  They  will  surely  reply:  “O  Beauteous 
One! O Beauteous One! O Most Compassionate and Merciful One!”2 Then listen to the 
skies; they say: “O Glorious One of Beauty!” And give your ear to the earth; it says: “O 
Beauteous  One  of  Glory!”  Listen  carefully  to  the  animals;  they  are  saying:  “O  Most 
Merciful  One!  O  Provider!”  And  ask  the  spring;  you  will  hear  many  Names  like:  “O 
Gentle One! O Most Merciful One! O Most Compassionate One! O Most Generous One! 
O Gracious One! O Benevolent One! O Giver of Forms! O Giver of Light! O Bestower! 
O Adorner!” Then ask a human being who is a true human, and see how he recites all the 
Most Beautiful  Names and  how they are written  on his  forehead. If  you  look carefully, 
you too may read them. It is as if the universe is a huge orchestra celebrating the Divine 
Names. Mixing the  faintest song with the  most powerful refrains,  it produces a sublime 
and subtle harmony. You may make further analogies in the same way. 

For  sure,  man  is  the  place  of  manifestation  of  all  the  Names,  but the  Names  being 
various has resulted in the universe’s variety and the differences in the angels’ worship, 
and has also caused a degree of variety among men. The different laws of the prophets, 
the different ways of the saints, and the different paths of the purified scholars has arisen 
from  this  mystery.  For  example,  together  with  the  other  Names,  the  Name  of  All-
Powerful  was  predominant  in  Jesus  (Peace  be  upon  him).  And  in  those  who  follow  the 
path of  

                                                

2 Even, one day I looked at the cats; all they were doing was eating, playing, and sleeping. I wondered: 
how is it these little monsters which perform no duties are known as blessed. Later, I lay down to sleep for 
the night. I looked; one of the cats had come. It lay against my pillow and put its mouth against my ear, and 
murmuring: “O Most Compassionate One! O Most Compassionate One!” in the most clear manner, as 
though refuted in the name of its species the objection and insult which had occurred to me, throwing it in 
my face. Then this occurred to me: I wonder if this recitation is particular to this cat, or is it general among 
cats? And is it only an unfair objector like me who hears it, or if anyone listens carefully, can they hear it? 
The next morning I listened to the other cats; it was not so clearly, but to varying degrees they were 
repeating the same invocation. At first, “O Most Compassionate!” was discernible following their purring. 
Then gradually their purrings and meaowings became the same “O Most Merciful!” It became an 
unarticulated, eloquent and sorrowful recitation. They would close their mouths and utter a fine “O Most 
Compassionate!” 

I related the story to the brothers who visited me, and they listened carefully as well, and said that they 

heard it to an extent. Later I wondered what this Name’s special feature was, and why they recite it in the 
way of men and not in animal tongue. Then it imparted to my heart that since these animals are very 
delicate and petted like children and are a friend of man, they are in much need of kindness and 
compassion. When they are stroked and paid attention to in the way they like, as praise and thanks for the 
bounty, and unlike dogs, they proclaim the mercy of their All-Compassionate Creator in their own worlds. 
They warn men in the sleep of heedlessness, and through their cry of “O Most Compassionate!”, they 
remind those who worship causes Who it is that help comes from and from Whom mercy may be awaited.

love,  the  Name  of  Loving  One  prevails,  and  in  those  who  follow  the  path  of 
contemplation and reflection, the Name of All-Wise. 

Thus, if someone is both a teacher, and a policeman, and a clerk of the court, and an 
inspector  in  the  civil  service,  in  each  office  he  has  both  relations,  and  duties,  and 
obligations, and salaries, and responsibilities, and promotion, and enemies and rivals who 
are the cause of his failures. He appears before the king with many titles, and he sees the 
king. He seeks help from him with many tongues. He has recourse to many of the ruler’s 
titles, and seeks his help in many forms in order to be saved from the evil of his enemies. 
In  just the  same  way,  man,  who  manifests  many  Names  and  is  charged  with  many 
duties and afflicted with  many enemies,  invokes  many of the Names  in  his prayers and 
supplications. Like Muhammad the Arabian (Peace and blessings be upon him), the cause 
of pride of mankind and truly the most perfect man, supplicated with a thousand and one 
Names in his prayer, Jawshan al-Kabir. It is due to this mystery that the Sura, 

Say, I seek refuge with the Sustainer and Cherisher of men, * The Sovereign of 
men, * The God of men, * From the evil of the whispering, elusive tempter3 

commands that we take refuge with God through three titles, and, 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate 

shows the seeking of help through three Names. 

SECOND BRANCH 

This explains two mysteries which comprise the keys to many further mysteries. 
FIRST  MYSTERY:  “Why  do  the  saints  differ  greatly  in  their  visions  and 
illuminations  although  they  are  unanimous  on  the  principles  of  belief?  Why  are  their 
illuminations,  which  are  at  the  degree  of  witnessing,  sometimes  opposed  to  reality  and 
contrary  to  the  truth?  And  why  in  their  ideas  which  they  consider  to  be  the  the  truth, 
establishing them through decisive proofs, do thinkers and scholars see and show reality 
in a way that contradicts one another? Why does one truth take on numerous colours?” 

SECOND  MYSTERY:  “Why  did  the  early  prophets  leave  some  of  the  pillars  of 
belief like bodily resurrection in brief form and not explain them in detail like the Qur’an, 
so  that  in  the  future  some  of  their  communities  went  as  far  as  denying  some  of  those 
concise  pillars?  Also,  why  did  some  of  the  saints  only  advance  in  the  affirmation  of 
Divine unity, and although they  

                                                

3 Qur’an, 114:1-4. 

 

345 

even progressed as far as the degree of  ‘absolute certainty’ in Divine unity, some of the 
pillars of  belief appear  in their paths  very  little  and  in  summary  form?  And as a result, 
those who followed them in the future did not give the necessary importance to the pillars 
of  belief, and some of them even  fell  into error? Since true perfection  is  found through 
the  unfolding  of  all  the  pillars  of  belief,  why  did  some  of  the  mystics  advance 
significantly  in them, while  some remained  very  backward, whereas God’s  Most Noble 
Messenger (Peace and blessings be upon him), who manifested all the Divine Names at 
their maximum degree and was the chief of the prophets, and the All-Wise Qur’an, which 
is  the  luminous  chief  of  all  the  sacred  scriptures,  described  in  detail  all  the  pillars  of 
belief, clearly, and in a most serious manner and deliberate way?” 

Because in reality the most true and complete perfection is thus. Yes, the wisdom in 
these  mysteries  is this:  for sure  man  is the place  of  manifestation of all the Names,  but 
since  his  power  is  slight,  his  will  partial,  his  abilities  various,  and  desires  different,  he 
searches for reality among thousands of veils and barriers. So, in uncovering reality and 
witnessing  the  truth,  barriers  intervene.  Some  people  cannot  by-pass  the  barriers.  Their 
abilities are all different. The abilities of  some cannot support the unfolding of some of 
the truths of belief. Moreover, the colours of the Name’s manifestations vary according to 
the place they are manifested; they become all different. Some people who manifest them 
cannot be the means to the complete manifestation of a Name. Also, the manifestation of 
the  Names  takes  on  different  forms  in  respect  of  universality,  particularity,  shadow,  or 
originality.  Some  capacities  cannot  transcend  particularity.  And  some  cannot  emerge 
from the shadow. In some capacities, sometimes one Name is predominant, and it carries 
out  its  word  and  rules  in  that  capacity.  Now  we  shall  make  a  few  indications  to  this 
profound  mystery  and  this  extensive  wisdom  with  an  enigmatical,  comprehensive,  true, 
but somewhat complex, comparison. 

For  example,  let  us  suppose  an  adorned  flower,  a  living  droplet  enamoured  of  the 
Moon,  and  a  translucent  atom  which  looks  to  the  Sun.  Each  of  these  possesses 
consciousness and some perfection, and each has a yearning for that perfection. Together 
with indicating many truths, these three things also allude to the spiritual voyaging of the 
soul,  the  mind,  and  the  heart.  They  also  correspond  to  three  levels  of  those  who 
investigate reality.4 

The  First  indicates  those  who  follow  the  path  of  intellectual  thought;  those  who 

follow the path of sainthood; and those who follow the path of prophethood. 
The Second corresponds to those who approach reality by striving for  

                                                

4 There are also three groups in each level. The three things given as examples in the comparison look 

to these three groups which are in each level. Indeed, they look to those nine groups, not the three levels. 

 

346 

perfection  through  the  bodily  systems;  and  those  who  approach  it  by  striving  with  the 
mind  and  refining  the  soul;  and  those  who  approach  it  through  belief,  submission,  and 
purifying the heart. 

The  Third  is  the  comparison  of  those  who  do  not  give  up  egotism,  are  plunged  in 
works,  and  approach  reality  through  deduction  and  reasoning  only;  and  of  those  who 
search  for  reality  through  knowledge  and  science,  reason  and  learning;  and  those  who 
approach  reality  swiftly  through  belief  and  the  Qur’an,  poverty  and  worship.  These 
comparisons  point  to  the  wisdom  in  the  differences  between  the  three  groups,  whose 
capacities are also different. 

Thus,  under  the  titles  of  Flower,  Droplet,  and  Atom,  we  shall  show  by  means  of  a 
comparison, the  mystery and extensive  wisdom  in the progress of the three groups. For 
example, through its Creator’s permission and at His command, the Sun has three sorts of 
manifestation, reflection and radiance: one  is  its reflection on  flowers, one  its reflection 
on  the  Moon  and  the  planets,  and  one  its  reflection  on  shining  objects  like  glass  and 
water. 

The First is in three ways: 
One  is  a  universal  and  general  manifestation  and  reflection  whereby  its  radiance 

encompasses all flowers at once. 

species. 

Another  is  a  special  manifestation  whereby  it  has  a  special  reflection  for  each 

Another  is  a  particular  manifestation  whereby  its  effulgence  is  in  accordance  with 
the  individuality  of  each  flower.  This  comparison  of  ours  is  in  conformity  with  this 
statement, that the adorned colours of flowers arises from the changing reflections of the 
seven colours in the Sun’s light. According to this, flowers too are sorts of mirrors to the 
Sun. 

The  Second  is  the  light  and  effulgence  which,  with  the  All-Wise  Creator’s 
permission,  the  Sun  gives  to  the  Moon  and  planets.  Having  received  this  extensive, 
universal  light  and  effulgence,  the  Moon,  whose  light  is  like  a  shadow  of  that  light, 
profits from the Sun in a universal fashion. Then its radiance and effulgence shines in a 
particular way on the seas and air and shining earth, and partially on the bubbles on the 
sea and translucent particles of the earth and the molecules of the air. 

The Third  is, through the Divine command, a reflection of the Sun which,  making 
the  air  and  the  surface  of  the  seas  into  mirrors,  is  pure,  universal,  and  without  shadow. 
Then the Sun gives to each of the bubbles on the sea, the droplets of water, molecules of 
air, and snow-flakes, a particular reflection and tiny image of itself.  

Thus, in the three forms mentioned above, the Sun bestows an effulgence and favour 
on every flower, the Moon, and all droplets and atoms. And these in turn are each in two 
ways: 

 

347 

The First Way is direct, and without barrier or veil. This way represents the way of 

prophethood. 

The Second Way: In this, barriers intervene. The capacities of the mirrors and places 
of manifestation add colour to the Sun’s manifestations. This way represents the way of 
sainthood. 

Thus, on the First Way, ‘Flower’, ‘Droplet’, and ‘Atom’ can each say: “I am a mirror 
to the Sun of all the world.” But on the Second Way they cannot say that; they can rather 
say: “I am the mirror to my own Sun, or the mirror to the Sun which is manifested in my 
species.”  For  that  is  the  manner  in  which  they  know  the  Sun.  They  cannot  see  a  Sun 
which looks to the whole world; the Sun of that individual or species or genus appears to 
it  within  narrow  confines  and  under  limiting  restrictions.  And  it  cannot  ascribe  to  that 
restricted Sun the works of the unrestricted, unconfined, absolute Sun. For within those 
narrow  restrictions  and  limited  confines  it  cannot  attribute  to  the  Sun  with  the  certain 
witnessing of the heart its majestic works like furnishing the whole face of the earth with 
light  and  heat,  stirring  all  plants  and  animals  into  life,  and  making  the  planets  revolve 
around  it.  Indeed,  even  if  those  three  things,  which  we  suppose  to  have  consciousness, 
ascribe  those  wondrous  works  to  the  Sun  which  they  see  under  those  restrictions,  they 
can only do so with the mind and through belief, and through submitting to the fact that 
that  restricted  thing  is  absolute.  Whereas  these  judgements  of  ‘Flower’,  ‘Droplet’,  and 
‘Atom’, which we suppose to possess reason like a human being, that is, their ascribing 
those  mighty  works  to  the  Sun,  is  through  the  mind  and  reason,  it  is  not  through 
illumination.  Indeed,  sometimes  their  judgements  concerning  belief  clash  with  their 
illuminations about the cosmos. They can only believe them with great difficulty. 

Now the three of us must enter into this comparison, which is narrow for reality, but 
in some of the corners of which the members of reality are to be seen and which is mixed 
with  reality.  The  three  of  us  shall  suppose  ourselves  to  be  ‘Flower’,  ‘Droplet’,  and 
‘Atom’. For the consciousness which we suppose them to have insufficient. We must add 
our  reasons  to theirs.  That  is  to  say,  just  as  they  receive  effulgence  from  their  physical 
Sun, we too shall receive effulgence from our immaterial Sun, and must understand it. 

And so, my friend, who has not forgotten the world, is preoccupied with materiality, 
and whose soul is dense! You be ‘Flower’. ‘Flower’ takes on a colour dissolved from the 
Sun’s  light,  and  it  mixes  the  Sun’s  image  in  with  that  colour  and  clothes  itself  in  an 
adorned form. For your capacity resembles  it as well. Then let this philosopher who has 
studied secular science and is plunged in causes like the Old Said be ‘Droplet’, which is 
enamoured  of  the  Moon.  For the  Moon  affords  him  the  shadow of  light  it  has  received 
from the Sun, and it gives a light to the pupil of his eye. ‘Droplet’ too shines  

 

348 

with the light, but he can only see the Moon with it, he cannot see the Sun. Rather, he can 
only see it through his belief. Then, let this poor man be ‘Atom’, who knows everything 
to be directly from Almighty God and considers causes to be a veil. He is such an ‘Atom’ 
that knows himself to be poor in his own self. He has nothing on which to depend so as to 
rely  on  himself  like  ‘Flower’.  He  possesses  no  colour that  he  should  appear  through  it. 
And he does not recognize other things that he should turn towards them. He has a sheer 
purity by which he holds the Sun’s image directly in the pupil of his eye. Now, since we 
have taken the place of these three things, we must consider ourselves. What do we have? 
What must we do? 

Thus, we look and see that through his favours a Most Munificent One is adorning, 
illuminating, and nurturing us. And man worships one who bestows favours on him. He 
wants to be close to one worthy of  being worshipped, and desires to see him. In which 
case, in accordance with our capacities, each of us journeys through the attraction of that 
love. You who is  like  ‘Flower’,  you are going,  but go as a flower. See, you have gone. 
You have advanced and advanced till you have reached a universal degree, as though you 
have become like all flowers. But ‘Flower’ is a dense mirror; it dissolves and refracts the 
seven  colours  in  light;  it  conceals  the  Sun’s  reflection.  You  will  not  be  successful  in 
seeing the face of the Sun which you love, for the colours and characteristics, which are 
restricted, disperse it, draw a veil over it and obscure it. In this situation, you cannot be 
saved  from  the  separation  which  occurs  with  the  interposing  of  barriers.  However,  you 
can be saved on one condition, which is that you raise your head, which is sunk in love of 
your  own  soul,  and  withdraw  your  gaze,  which  glories  and  takes  pleasure  in  its  own 
merits, and cast it at the face of the Sun in the sky. But on condition you turn your face 
looking down to the earth to gain your livelihood, up to the Sun. For you are its mirror. 
Your  duty  is  to  act  as  a  mirror to  it.  Whether  you  know  it  or  not,  your  sustenance  will 
anyway  come  from  the  earth,  the  door  to  the  treasury  of  mercy.  Yes,  a  flower  is  a 
miniscule  mirror of the Sun, and the Sun too is  merely a drop-like  flash  manifesting  in 
the seas of the skies the Name of Light of the Pre-Eternal Sun. 

O heart of man! Understand from this, of what sort of a Sun you are the mirror. After 
fulfilling  this  condition,  you  will  find  your  perfection.  But  just  as  in  actual  reality  you 
cannot see the Sun in that way, so you cannot understand this truth naked; the colours of 
your attributes give it a colour and your cloudy telescope imposes a form on it, and your 
limited capacity restricts it. 

Now, wise philosopher who has entered into ‘Droplet’! You have advanced as far as 
the  Moon  with  the  telescope  of  your  droplet  of  thought  and  by  the  stairway  of 
philosophy. You have entered the Moon. Look, of  itself the Moon  is dense and dark;  it 
has neither light nor life. Your  

 

349 

endeavour has all been in vain and your knowledge has proved to be profitless. You can 
only be saved from the darkness of despair, the desolation of loneliness, the pestering of 
evil spirits, and the  horrors of that bleakness through these conditions: that you give up 
the night of nature and turn to the Sun of reality, and you believe with complete certainty 
that  the  light  of  this  night  are  the  shadows  of  the  lights  of  the  daytime  Sun.  After 
fulfilling these conditions, you will find your perfection. You will find the majestic Sun 
in place of the poor and darksome Moon. But like your previous friend, you will not be 
able to see the Sun clearly; you will see it beyond the veils with which your reason and 
your  philosophy  are  familiar  and  conversant,  and  behind  the  screens  woven  by  science 
and learning, and within a colour conferred by your capacity. 

And  now  our  Atom-like  third  friend,  who  is  both  poor  and  colourless.  He  swiftly 
evaporates in the Sun’s heat, abandons his egotism, mounts the steam, and rises into the 
air. The dense matter within him takes fire with the flame of love and is transformed into 
light and radiance. He adheres to a ray proceeding from the manifestations of that light, 
and draws close to it. O you who resembles  ‘Atom’! Since you act as a direct mirror to 
the Sun, at whatever degree you are, you will find an opening, a window, looking purely 
at the Sun itself in a fashion that affords absolute certainty. And you will experience no 
difficulty  in  attributing  to  the  Sun  its  wondrous  works.  Without  hesitation  you  will  be 
able to ascribe to it the majestic attributes of which it is worthy. Nothing will be able to 
take  you  by  the  hand  and  make  you  forego  ascribing  to  it  the  awesome  works  of  its 
essential  sovereignty.  Neither  the  constriction  of  barriers,  nor  the  limitations  of  your 
capacity,  nor  the  smallness  of  mirrors  will  confuse  you,  nor  impel  you  contrary  to  the 
truth. Because, since  you  look at it purely, sincerely, and directly,  you  have understood 
that what appears in the places of manifestation and is observed in the mirrors, is not the 
Sun,  but  manifestations  of  it  of  a  sort,  and  coloured  reflections  of  it  of  a  sort.  For  sure 
those reflections are its titles, but they do not display all the works of its splendour. 

Thus, in this comparison, which is mixed with reality, perfection is reached by means 
of  three  ways  which  are  all  different,  and  which  differ  concerning  the  virtues  of  those 
perfections  and  the  details  of  the  degrees  of  witnessing.  But  in  conclusion  and  in 
submitting to the Truth and confirming the reality, they are in agreement. Just as a man of 
the night who has  never seen the Sun and has only seen  its shadow  in the  mirror of the 
Moon, cannot squeeze into his mind the resplendent light and awesome gravity particular 
to the Sun, but submits to those who have seen it and imitates them; similarly, one who 
cannot  attain  to  the  maximum  degrees  of  Names  like  All-Powerful  and  Giver  of  Life 
through the legacy of Muhammad (PBUH), accepts the resurrection of the dead and Great 
Gathering imitatively, and declares it is not a  

 

350 

matter that can be understood through the reason. For the reality of the resurrection and 
Last Judgement is the manifestation of the Greatest Name and of the supreme degree of 
certain other Names. Those whose gaze cannot rise there are compelled to believe  it by 
way of imitation. While those whose minds can enter there, see the resurrection and Last 
Judgement as easily as day and night, and spring and winter, and accept it with an easy 
mind. 

Thus,  it  is due to this  mystery that the Qur’an  speaks of the resurrection and Great 
Gathering at the highest level and  in the  most perfect detailed  manner, and our Prophet 
(Peace  and  blessings  be  upon  him),  who  manifested  the  Greatest  Name,  taught  it  thus. 
And  as  required  by  the  wisdom  of  guidance,  the  former  prophets  did  not  teach  their 
communities,  which  were  at  a  somewhat  simple  and  primitive  level,  about  the 
resurrection of the dead at the highest level and with the most extensive details. It is also 
due to this mystery that some of those who followed the path of sainthood did not see or 
could not demonstrate some of the truths of belief at the greatest degree. It is also due to 
this  mystery  that  there  are  pronounced  differences  in  the  degrees  of  those  who  have 
knowledge  of  God.  Numerous  other  mysteries  like  these  unfold  from  this  truth.  Now, 
since both this comparison hints at the truth a little, and the truth is extremely extensive 
and  profound,  we  also  shall  content  ourselves  with  the  comparison,  and  not  attempt 
mysteries which are beyond our limit and capacity. 

THIRD BRANCH 

Since the Hadiths that speak of the signs of the end of time, the events at the end of 
time, and the merits and rewards of certain actions have not been well understood, some 
scholars  who  rely  on  their  reason  have  pronounced  some  of  them  to  be  either  weak  or 
false. While some of the scholars whose belief was weak but whose egotism was strong 
have gone as far as denying them. For now we shall not attempt any detailed discussion, 
but shall only explain twelve ‘Principles’. 

FIRST PRINCIPLE:  This is a matter which we have explained in the question and 
answer at the end of the Twentieth Word. Its summary is this: Religion is an examination, 
a test, which distinguishes elevated spirits from base ones. It therefore speaks of matters 
that everyone shall see with their eyes in the future in such a way that they remain neither 
altogether  unknown,  nor  self-evident  so  that  everyone  would  be  compelled  to  confirm 
them. They open the door to the reason but do not take the will from the hand. Because if 
a sign of the Last Day appeared completely self-evidently and everyone was compelled to 
affirm  it,  then  a  disposition  like  coal  would  remain  equal  to  one  like  diamonds.  The 
mystery  of  man’s  accountability  and  results  of  examination  would  go  for  nothing.  It  is 
because of this that there has been much dispute over many matters like that of the Mahdi 
and Sufyan.  

 

351 

Also,  the  narrations  differ  greatly;  they  have  become  pronouncements  which  contradict 
one another. 

SECOND  PRINCIPLE:  There  are  various  levels  in  the  matters  of  Islam.  If  one 
requires  certain  proof,  for  another  the  prevailing  opinion  is  sufficient.  Others  require 
merely assent and acceptance and not to be rejected. In which case, secondary matters or 
particular events  in time which are  not among the bases of  belief do not require certain 
compliance and definite proof, just not to be rejected and to be submitted to, and not to be 
interfered with. 

THIRD PRINCIPLE: In the time of the Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) most of 
the  Jewish  and  Christian  scholars  entered  Islam,  and  their  former  knowledge  became 
Muslim  along  with  them.  Some  of  their  former  knowledge  which  was  contrary  to  the 
truth was imagined to be a part of Islam. 

FOURTH  PRINCIPLE:    Some  of  the  words  of  the  narrators  of  Hadith  or  the 
meanings they deduced were considered to be part of the texts of the Hadiths themselves. 
However,  since  man  cannot  be  free  of  fault,  some  of  their  deductions  or  words  which 
were contrary to the truth were supposed to be Hadiths and were pronounced to be weak. 
FIFTH  PRINCIPLE:    According  to  the  meaning  of:  “Among  my  community  are 
transmitters  of  Hadiths,”  that  is,  meaning,  “who  are  inspired,”5  some  of  the  meanings 
which were obtained through the inspirations of scholars of related Hadiths who followed 
the  path  of  illumination  and  sainthood  were  supposed  to  be  Hadiths.  Whereas,  due  to 
certain  obstructions,  the  inspiration  of  saints  may  be  in  error.  Thus,  some  that  are 
contrary to the truth may arise from this. 

SIXTH  PRINCIPLE:    There  are  certain  stories  which,  having  become  universally 
known,  have  become  like  proverbs.  Their  true  meanings  are  not  borne  in  mind.  For 
whatever  purpose  they  were  spread,  that  is  what  is  considered.  Thus,  some  stories  and 
fables  which  have  become  well-known  among  people  in  this  way,  God’s  Noble 
Messenger  (Peace  and  blessings  be  upon  him)  told  in  the  form  of  comparisons  and 
metaphors for the purpose of guidance. If there is any error in the true meanings of this 
sort of matters, it pertains to the customs and traditions of the people, and the way they 
have been passed among them. 

SEVENTH PRINCIPLE:  There are many similes and parables that with the passage 
of  time  or  with  passing  from  the  hand  of  learning  to  the  hand  of  ignorance  have  been 
supposed to be physical fact, and have become mistaken. For example, two angels of God 
in  the  World  of  Similitudes  called  ‘The  Ox’  and  ‘The  Fish’,6  who  are  among  the 
supervisors of the animals of  

                                                

5 Bukhari, iii, 211; v, 15; Muslim, iv, 184; al-Hakim; al-Mustadrak, iii, 86; Ibn Hibban, ix, 21. 
6 Suyuti, al-Durr al-Manthur, vi, 249; al-Hakim, al-Mustadrak, iii, 588; iv, 120, 203. 

 

352 

the land and the sea and are represented as an ox and fish, were imagined to be huge ox 
and a physical fish, and the Hadith was wrongly interpreted. And for example, one time 
in  the  presence  of  the  Prophet  a  deep  rumbling  was  heard.  God’s  Messenger  (PBUH) 
decreed: “That is the sound of a rock that has been rolling downhill for seventy years and 
only now has hit the bottom of Hell.”7 Thus, someone hearing this Hadith who does not 
know  the  truth  may  deviate  into  denial.  But  then,  twenty  minutes  after  the  Hadith  was 
spoken  it  was  definitely  established,  for  someone  came  and  told  God’s  Messenger 
(PBUH): “The famous dissembler died twenty minutes ago.” God’s Messenger (PBUH) 
had described most eloquently how the dissembler’s seventy year lifetime of unbelief had 
been a continuous descent to the lowest of the low as a stone of Hell. Almighty God had 
made that rumbling heard at the moment of his death and given him a sign. 

EIGHTH  PRINCIPLE:  In  this  arena  of  trial  and  realm  of  examination,  Almighty 
God, the Absolutely Wise One, conceals most important things in the midst of numerous 
others, and this is tied to many purposes, benefits, and instances of wisdom. For example, 
He has hidden the Night of Power in the whole of Ramadan, and the hour when prayers 
are  answered  in  the  whole  of  Friday,  and  well-accepted  saints  among  the  people 
generally, and the appointed  hour  in  a person’s  life-time,  and the time of Doomsday  in 
the life of the world.8 For if the time of man’s death had been specified, the first half of 
his life would be passed in absolute heedlessness and the second, in terror, like going step 
by  step  to the  gallows.  Whereas  for  the  balance  between  this  world  and  the  next  to  be 
preserved, and to remain perpetually between hope and fear, living and dying have to be 
possible every moment. In which case, twenty years of uncertain life are preferable to a 
thousand years of life that are specified.  

Thus,  the  Last  Day  is  the  appointed  hour  of  the  world,  the  macroanthropos.  If  the 
time  had  been  specified,  all  the  early  and  middle  ages  would  have  been  plunged  into 
absolute heedlessness, and the latter centuries, into terror. Just as in his personal life man 
is  concerned  with  the  continued  existence  of  his  home  and  village,  so  in  his  social  life 
and as a  member of  mankind  he  is concerned with the continued existence of the earth 
and the world. The Qur’an says, 

The Hour has drawn nigh.9 

That  is, Doomsday  is  near. It still  not having  come after a thousand or this  many  years 
does not negate its closeness. Because Doomsday is the appointed hour of the world, and 
in relation to the life of the world one or

two  thousand  years  are  like  one  or  two  minutes  in  relation  to  a  year.  The  Hour  of 
Doomsday  is  not only the appointed hour of  mankind that  it should  be related to it and 
seen as distant. It is because of this that the Absolutely Wise One conceals Doomsday in 
His  knowledge  among  the  ‘Five  Hidden  Things.’  It  is  due  to  the  mystery  of  this 
vagueness that every age including the Age of the Bliss, the Age of the Prophet, people 
have been frightened of the end of the world. Some of them even said that the conditions 
had all but appeared.10 

Thus, unfair people who do not know this truth say: “Why did the Companions of the 
Prophet with their  vigilant hearts and keen  sight, who had  been taught all the details of 
the hereafter, suppose a fact that would occur one thousand four hundred years later to be 
close  to  their  century,  as  though  their  ideas  had  deviated  a  thousand  years  from  the 
truth?” 

The  Answer:  Because,  through  the  effulgence  of  the  Prophet’s  conversation,  the 
Companions  thought of  the  hereafter  more  than  anyone,  and  knowing  the  transience  of 
the world and understanding the Divine wisdom  in the  hour of Doomsday  being  vague, 
they  assumed  a  position  of  always  awaiting  the  world’s  appointed  hour  and  worked 
seriously  for  the  hereafter.  God’s  Noble  Messenger  (Peace  and  blessings  be  upon  him) 
repeating:  “Expect  Doomsday.  Wait  for  it”11  was  prophetic  guidance  arising  from  this 
wisdom,  it  was  not  a  pronouncement  of  revelation  concerning  the  specific  time  of  its 
occurrence  and  far  from  the  truth.  The  cause  is  one  thing  and  the  wisdom  is  another. 
Thus, sayings of the Prophet (PBUH) of this sort arise from the wisdom in certain things 
being indefinite.  

It is also due to this mystery that they expected the individuals who will come at the 
end  of  time  like  the  Mahdi  and  Sufyan  long  beforehand,  and  even  in  the  time  of  the 
generation succeeding the Prophet, and hoped to live long enough to see them. Some of 
the  saints,  even,  said  that  they  had  passed.  Like  the  end  of  the  world,  Divine  wisdom 
requires that the times of these individuals are not specified either. Because every age is 
in  need  of  the  Mahdi’s  meaning,  for  he  strengthens  morale  and  saves  the  people  from 
despair. Every century  has to have a share of this  meaning. In order that people should 
not heedlessly follow evil and the reins of the soul should not be left free in indifference, 
every century the fearsome individuals who come to lead strife must be shrunk from and 
feared. If they had been specified, the benefits of general guidance would have been lost. 
Now,  the  difference  in  the  narrations  about  individuals  like  the  Mahdi,  and  their 
meaning,  is  this:  those  who  expounded  Hadiths  applied  the  text  of  the  Hadiths  to  their 
own interpretations and commentaries. For example, since  

                                                

10 al-Hakim, al-Mustadrak, iv, 545, 549; Musnad, ii, 298, 299. 
11 Tirmidhi, Fitan, 39. 

 

354 

the  centre  of  power  at  that  time  was  Damascus  or  Medina,  they  imagined  the  events 
connected with the Mahdi and Sufyan in places like Basra, Kufa, and Syria, which were 
in  the  region  of  those  centres,  and  expounded  them  accordingly.  Moreover,  they 
imagined  the  mighty  works  belonging  to  the  collective  identity  or  community  which 
those individuals represent to be in their persons and expounded them in that way, so that 
they  ascribed  a  form  to  them  whereby  when  those  extraordinary  individuals  appear, 
everyone will recognize them. However, as we said, this world is the arena of trial. The 
door  is  opened  to  the  reason,  but  the  will  is  not  taken  from  the  hand.  So,  when  those 
individuals, and even the terrible Dajjal, appear, many people and himself even will not 
know  to  start  with  that  he  is  the  Dajjal.  Those  individuals  of  the  end  of  time  will  be 
known through the insight and the light of belief. 

It is narrated in a Hadith about the Dajjal, who is one of the signs of the end of time: 
“His first day is like a year, his second day like a month, his third day like a week, and 
his  fourth  day  like  other  days.  When  he  appears  the  world  will  hear.  He  will  travel  the 
world  in  forty  days.”12  Some  unfair  people  have  said  about  this  narration  that  it  is 
impossible, God forbid, and have gone as far as denying and declaring it null. Whereas, 
And the knowledge of it is with God, the reality of it must be this: 

It indicates the appearance of an individual from the North who will come to lead a 
great current issuing forth from the godless ideas of Naturalism, in the North, where the 
world of unbelief is at its densest, and who will be atheist. There is an instance of wisdom 
in  this,  for  in  the  latitudes  close  to  the  North  Pole  the  whole  year  is  one  day  and  one 
night; there are  six  months of  night and six  months of day.  “One day of the Dajjal  is a 
year” alludes to his appearance close to those latitudes. What is meant from “His second 
day is a month” is that passing in this direction from the North, it sometimes happens that 
for a month in the summer the sun does not set. This suggests that the Dajjal will emerge 
in the North and invade southwards towards the civilized world. By attributing the day to 
the Dajjal, it points to this. He comes further in this direction, and the sun does not set for 
a  week,  and  so  it  continues  until  there  are  three  hours  between  its  rising  and  setting. 
While being held as a prisoner-of-war in Russia, I was in such a place. Close to us was a 
place where the sun did not set for a week. They used to go there to watch it. As for the 
part, “When the Dajjal appears, all the world will hear of it,” the telegraph and radio have 
solved this. As for his travelling the world in forty days, the railway and aeroplane, which 
are his mounts, have solved. Deniers who formerly considered these two statements to be 
impossible, now see them as commonplace! 

Since in another treatise I have written in some detail about Gog and  

                                                

12 Muslim, iv, 252, No: 110; Musnad, iii, 367; vi, 181; al-Hakim, al-Mustadrak, vi, 530. 

 

355 

Magog and the Barrier, which are among the signs of the end of the world, I refer readers 
to those, and here only say this: there are  narrations stating that the tribes known as the 
Manchurians and Mongols, who threw  human society  into chaos and were the cause of 
the building of the Great Wall of China, will again overturn human civilization close to 
Doomsday with an idea like anarchy. 

Some  atheists  say:  “Where  are  the  tribes  that  perform  these  extraordinary  acts  and 

that will perform them?” 

The  Answer:  A  calamity  like  locusts  appears  in  one  season  in  enormous  numbers, 
then  on  the  change  of  the  seasons,  those  numerous  tribes  which  disrupt  the  country 
consign  their  reality  to  a  few  limited  individuals.  Then,  when  the  time  comes,  at  the 
Divine  command,  great  numbers  appear  from  those  limited  individuals  and  embark  on 
the same corruption. As though the reality of their national identity is fined down, but not 
destroyed,  and  when  the  time  arrives,  it  reemerges.  In  just  the  same  way,  those  same 
tribes which overturned the world at one time will when the time comes again overturn 
human civilization with Divine permission. But what  impels them  will  be  in  a different 
form. None knows the Unseen save God. 

NINTH  PRINCIPLE:    The  results  of  some  of  the  questions  of  belief  look  to  this 
restricted  and  narrow  world,  while  others  look  to  the  world  of  the  hereafter,  which  is 
broad  and  absolute.  In  order  to  give  the  appropriate  effect  of  either  encouraging  or 
restraining, some Hadiths about the merits and rewards of actions are in an eloquent style, 
and some unthinking people have supposed them to be exaggerated. However, since they 
are all pure truth and reality, there is no exaggeration or overstatement in them.  

For instance, there is this Hadith which has worried the heads of the unfair more than 
any. Its meaning is: “If the world had as much value as a fly’s wing for Almighty God, 
the  unbelievers  would  not  have  had  so  much  as  a  mouthful  of  water  from  it.”13  The 
reality of it is this: the phrase for Almighty God refers to the eternal realm. Yes, since a 
light from the eternal realm to the extent of a fly’s wing is everlasting, it is greater than a 
temporary  light that fills the  face of the  earth. That means  it  is  not to say that the huge 
world is equal to a fly’s wing, but that everyone’s private world which is situated within 
their short lives, is not equal to an everlasting Divine effulgence and bounty to the extent 
of a fly’s wing from the eternal realm.  

Furthermore,  the  world  has  two  faces,  indeed,  three  faces.  One  is  the  mirror  to 
Almighty God’s Names, another looks to the hereafter and is its arable field, and the third 
looks  to  transience  and  non-existence.  This  is  the  world  of  the  people  of  misguidance 
which is not in accordance with the things that please God that we know. That is to say, it 
infers not that the vast world  

                                                

13 Tirmidhi, Zuhd, 13; Ibn Maja, Zuhd, 3; al-Hakim, al-Mustadrak, iv, 306. 

 

356 

which  is  the  mirror  to  the  Most  Beautiful  Names,  and  consists  of  missives  of  the 
Eternally  Besought  One,  and  is  the  tillage  of  the  hereafter,  but  that  the  world  of  those 
who worship the world, which is opposed to the hereafter and is the source of all wrongs 
and spring of calamities, is not worth one everlasting particle which will be given to the 
believers in the hereafter. Thus, how can the way it is understood by the unfair atheists be 
compared  with  this  most  true  and  serious  truth?  What  has  the  meaning  which  those 
atheists supposed to be the most exaggerated and overstated to do with this? 

And, for example, others which the unfair atheists supposed to be exaggeration and 
even impossible overstatement are narrations about the rewards for actions and merits of 
some of the Qur’an’s Suras. For example, there are narrations that, “The merit of Sura al-
Fatiha  is  equal  to  that  of  the  Qur’an.”14  And,  “Sura  al-Ikhlas  equals  a  third  of  the 
Qur’an,”15 “Sura al-Zilzal, a quarter,”16 “Sura al-Kafirun, a quarter,”17 “Sura Ya. Sin., ten 
times  the  Qur’an.”18  Unjust  and  unthinking  people  have  said  that  these  are  impossible 
because  Sura  Ya.  Sin.  and  the  other  meritorious  Suras  are  within  the  Qur’an,  which 
makes it meaningless. 

The Answer: The reality is this: for each of the All-Wise Qur’an’s letters is a merit. 
Each  is  a  good  deed.  Out  of  Divine  grace  the  merits  of  those  letters  sprout  and  yield 
sometimes ten, sometimes seventy, and sometimes seven hundred, merits, like the letters 
of Ayat al-Kursi. Sometimes they yield one thousand five hundred, like the letters of Sura 
al-Ikhlas, and sometimes ten thousand, like verses recited on Layla al-Bara’a and those 
that coincide with other acceptable times. And sometimes they yield thirty thousand, like 
verses  recited  on  the  Night  of  Power,  which  are  like  poppy  seeds  in  their  multiplicity. 
The indication that that night is the equivalent to a thousand months makes it understood 
that on that night one letter has thirty thousand merits. For example, let us suppose there 
is  a  field  planted  with  maize,  one  thousand  plants  of  it.  If  some  seeds  produce  seven 
shoots, and from each shoot a hundred grains, then a single seed becomes the equivalent 
of two thirds of the whole field. For example, if one seed produces ten shoots, and each 
yields two hundred grains, then a single seed is the equivalent of twice the original field. 
You can make further analogies in the same way. 

Now,  let  us  imagine  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  to  be  a  luminous,  sacred,  heavenly  field. 
Each of its letters together with its original merit is like a seed. Their shoots will not be 
taken into consideration. They may be compared with the Suras and verses about which 
are narrations concerning their merits,  

                                                

14 Bukhari, Tafsir Sura, I; xv, 3; Fada’il al-Qur’an, 9; Tirmidhi, Thawab al-Qur’an, 1. 
15 Tirmidhi, Thawab al-Qur’an, 10, 11; Ibn Maja, Adab, 52. 
16 Tirmidhi, Thawab al-Qur’an, 9; Musnad, iii, 147, 221. 
17 Tirmidhi, Thawab al-Qur’an, 9; Musnad, iii, 147, 221. 
18 Tirmidhi, Thawab al-Qur’an, 7; Darimi, Fada’il al-Qur’an, 21. 

 

357 

like Ya. Sin., Ikhlas, Fatiha, Kafirun, Zilzal. For example, the Qur’an has three hundred 
thousand  six  hundred  and  twenty  letters,  and  Sura  al-Ikhlas  together  with  Bismillah, 
sixty-nine.  Three  times  sixty  nine  is  two  hundred  and  seven  letters.  Thus,  if  Sura  Ya. 
Sin.’s letters are reckoned and compared with all the letters of the All-Wise Qur’an, and 
then multiplied ten times, it produces the following result: each letter of Sura Ya. Sin. has 
close on five hundred merits. That is, that many good deeds may be reckoned. And so, if 
you  apply  the  others  to  this,  you  will  understand  what  a  subtle,  fine,  true,  and 
unexaggerated truth it is. 

TENTH  PRINCIPLE:    Like  with  most  of  the  other  sorts  of  creatures,  among 
mankind are certain individuals who are extraordinary by virtue of their acts and deeds. If 
those  individuals  have  advanced  in  good  deeds,  they  have  been  the  cause  of  pride  of 
mankind. Otherwise, they have been the cause of their shame. Also, they are hidden. It is 
as though each becomes a collective identity, an imaginary goal. Other individuals try to 
emulate them, and it is possible. That means, being absolute and indefinite, it is possible 
for  such  a  perfect,  extraordinary  person  to  be  present  everywhere.  In  regard  to  this 
indefiniteness,  according  to  logic,  his  universality  may  be  posited  in  the  form  of  a 
possible proposition. That is, it is possible for all acts to produce the following result: for 
example,  “Whoever  performs  two  rak’ats  of  prayers  at  such  and  such  a  time  has 
performed  the  equivalent  of  the  Hajj.”19  It  is  thus  the  truth  that  at  certain  times  two 
rak’ats of prayers  may  be the equivalent of a Hajj. Due to its universality, this  meaning 
may apply to all prayers of two rak’ats. That means what narrations of this sort refer to is 
not in fact continuous and universal, because since there are conditions of acceptance, it 
disallows it being continuous and universal. It is either in fact temporary and absolute or 
possible and universal. That is to say, the universality in this sort of Hadith is in regard to 
possibility.  For  example,  “Backbiting  is  like  murder.”20  This  means,  someone  who 
indulges in backbiting is more harmful than deadly poison, like a killer. And for example, 
“A good word is a deed so good it is like freeing a slave.”21 

Here, in order to encourage and restrain, it points out the possibility of that indefinite 
perfect individual being present everywhere in absolute form as though it is actually the 
case, thus arousing eagerness for good and disgust for evil. Furthermore, the things of the 
eternal world cannot be measured on the scale of this world. The greatest thing here is not 
equal  to  the  least  thing  there.  Because  the  merits  of  actions  look  to  that  world,  our 
worldly  view  is  narrow  for  them.  We  cannot  fit  them  into  our  minds.  For  example, 
“Whoever reads this is given the reward of Moses and Aaron.” That is to say:

20 Musnad al-Firdaws, iii, 116, 117. 
21 al-Manzari, al-Targhib wa’l-Tarhib, iii, 421, 434; Kanz al-‘Ummal, iii, 589.

All  praise  be  to  God,  Sustainer  of  the  heavens  and  Sustainer  of  the  earth  * 
Sustainer of all the worlds, His is the might in the heavens and the earth, and He 
is  the  Mighty,  the  Wise.  *  All  praise  be  to  God,  Sustainer  of  the  heavens  and 
Sustainer of the earths, * Sustainer of all the worlds, and His is the sublimity in 
the  heavens  and  the  earth,  and  He  is  the  Mighty,  the  Wise.  *  And  His  is  the 
dominion, Sustainer of the heavens, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.  

What  has  most attracted the attention of the unfair and the unthinking  is  narrations 

like these. The reality of the matter is this: 

With  our  narrow  mind  and  short  views  in  this  world,  we  know  how  much  we 
imagine the the rewards of Moses and Aaron (Peace be upon them) to be. The reward the 
Absolutely  Compassionate  One  will  give  to one  of  His  infinitely  needy  servants  in  the 
world of eternity and everlasting happiness, in return for a single invocation may be equal 
to the reward of those two, but equal to the rewards as we conceive of them and surmise 
them to be.  

For example, there is a primitive, uncouth man who has never seen the king and does 
not  know the  majesty  of  his  rule.  He  imagines  a  lord  in  a  village,  and  with  his  limited 
ideas  thinks  of  the  king  as  a  more  exalted  version  of  the  lord.  Long  ago  with  us  even, 
there was a simple-minded tribe who used to say: “Our lord knows what the Sultan does 
as he cooks his bulgur soup on his stove in a saucepan.” That is to say, they imagined the 
Sultan  in such a  narrow situation and so common a form that he cooked his own wheat 
soup; they supposed him to have the majesty of a captain. Now, if someone was to say to 
one of that tribe: “If you do this work for me today, I’ll give you as much majesty as you 
think  the  Sultan  has,  and  give  you  a  rank  as  high  as  a  captain.”  To  say  that  is  right, 
because, of the  majesty of kingship, what enters the  narrow bounds of  his  ideas  is only 
the majesty of a captain. 

Thus,  with  our  worldly  views  and  narrow  minds,  we  cannot think  as  much  as  that 
primitive man of the true rewards which look to the hereafter. It is not the equivalent of 
the true rewards of Moses and Aaron (Peace be upon them), for according to the rule of 
similes and comparisons, the unknown is compared to the known; the true reward, which 
is unknown,  for an  invocation of one of God’s  believing  servants  is  compared with the 
rewards that we know and surmise.  Moreover, the surface of the sea and the  heart of  a 
droplet  are  equal  when  it  comes  to  holding  the  complete  reflection  of  the  sun.  The 
difference  is  only  in  quality.  The  nature  of  the  reward  reflected  in  the  mirrors  of  the 
ocean-like spirits of Moses and Aaron (Peace be upon them) is exactly the same in nature 
as  the  reward  that  a  believing  servant,  who  is  like  a  droplet,  receives  from  a  Qur’anic 
verse.  They  are  the  same  in  nature  and  quantity,  while  their  quality  is  dependent  on 
capacity.  

Also, it sometimes happens that a single word, a single glorification, opens  

 

359 

a treasury of happiness that was not opened with sixty years of service. That is to say, it 
sometimes  happens  that  a  single  verse  may  be  as  beneficial  as  the  Qur’an.  Also,  the 
Divine effulgence which God’s Noble Messenger (PBUH), who manifested the Greatest 
Name, received from a single verse, may have been as much as all the effulgence one of 
the other prophets received. And  it would  not be contrary to the truth  if  it  is said that a 
believer who through ‘the  legacy of prophethood’  manifests the shadow of the Greatest 
Name, receives, in accordance with his own capacity and in regard to quantity, a reward 
as great as a prophet’s effulgence. Furthermore, reward and merit are from the world of 
light, and one world from that world may be contained in a speck. Just as the heavens and 
all its stars may appear in a tiny fragment of glass, so luminous reward and merit like the 
heavens  may  be situated  in an  invocation or verse which acquires  transparency through 
pure intention. 

Conclusion: O unfair, unthinking, self-centred, cavilling  man whose  belief  is weak 
and  philosophy,  strong!  Consider  these  Ten  Principles,  then  do  not  make  the  pretext  a 
narration  you  thought  was  contrary  to  the  truth  and  definitely  opposed  to  reality,  and 
point the finger of objection at Hadiths thus casting aspersions on the Noble Messenger’s 
(PBUH) sinlessness! Because, firstly, these Ten Principles and what they entail will make 
you forego denial; they say: “If there is any real fault, it is ours,” it may not be referred to 
it  springs  from  your 
the  Hadiths.  They  say 
misunderstanding.” In short; if one embarks on denial and rejection, one first has to deny 
these Ten Principles and show them to be false. Now, if you are fair, after pondering over 
these  Ten  Principles  with  due  attention,  do  not  attempt  to  deny  a  Hadith  your  reason 
considers contrary to the truth! Say, “There is either an explanation, or an interpretation, 
or an exegesis of this,” and do not criticize it.

too:  “If 

ELEVENTH PRINCIPLE:  Just as the Qur’an has obscure verses which are in need 
of interpretation or else require absolute submission, Hadiths also contain difficulties like 
the  obscurities  of  the  Qur’an.  They  are  sometimes  in  need  of  extremely  careful 
expounding and interpretation. The above examples may be sufficient for you. 

Yes,  someone  who  is  awake  interprets  the  dream  of  another  who  is  sleeping,  and 
sometimes one who is sleeping hears the words spoken by those near him who are awake, 
but gives them a meaning and interprets them in a way that applies to his own world of 
sleep. O man stupified by the sleep of heedlessness and philosophy! Do not deny in your 
dream what One saw, who manifested the meaning of, “His eye never wavered nor did it 
swerve,”22 and “My eye sleeps, but my heart sleeps not,”23 and who was truly awake and  

                                                

22 Qur’an, 53:17. 
23 Bukhari, Tahajjud, 16; Tarawih, 1; Manaqib, 24; Tirmidhi, Adab, 86; Musnad, i, 274. 

 

360 

aware, interpret it. Yes, if a mosquito bites someone who is asleep, he sometimes dreams 
that he has received terrible wounds in war and this has a reality in sleep. If he was to be 
questioned,  he  would  say:  “Truly  I  have  been  wounded.  Guns  and  rifles  were  fired  at 
me.” Those sitting by him laugh at his anguish in sleep. Thus, the sleep-stained view of 
heedlessness and philosophical thought certainly cannot be the criterion for the truths of 
prophethood. 

TWELFTH  PRINCIPLE:    Since  prophethood, the  affirmation  of  Divine  unity,  and 
belief  all  look  to  unity,  the  hereafter,  and  Divinity,  they  see  truth  and  reality  in 
accordance with those. While philosophers and scientists look to multiplicity, causes, and 
nature, and see in accordance with them. Their points of view are extremely distant from 
one another. The greatest aim of the people of philosophy is so small and insignificant as 
to be imperceptible among the aims of the scholars of religion and theology. 

It is  because of this that scientists have advanced greatly  in detailed  explanation of 
the  nature  of  beings  and  their  minutest  states,  but  they  are  so  far  behind  the  exalted 
Divine  sciences  and  sciences  concerned  with  the  hereafter,  which  are  true  wisdom  and 
knowledge,  that  they  are  more  backward  than  a  simple  believer.  Those  who  do  not 
understand  this  mystery  suppose  the  investigative  scholars  of  Islam  to  be  relatively 
backward to the philosophers. But how can those whose minds see no further than their 
eyes  and  are  submerged  in  multiplicity  reach  those  who  follow  elevated  sacred  aims 
through ‘the legacy of prophethood’? 

Furthermore, when  something  is considered  from two points of  view,  it shows two 
different truths, and both of them may be the truth. No certain fact of science can touch 
the  sacred  truths  of  the  Qur’an.  The  short  hand  of  science  cannot  reach  up  to  its  pure 
sublimity. We shall mention an example to illustrate this:  

For  example,  if  the  globe  of  the  earth  is  considered  from  the  point  of  view  of  the 
people of science,  its reality  is this: as a  middle-sized planet, it revolves around the sun 
amid countless stars; it is a small creature in relation to the stars. But as is explained in 
the Fifteenth Word, if it is considered from the point of view of the people of the Qur’an, 
its  reality  is  this:  since  man,  the  fruit  of  the  world,  is  a  most  comprehensive,  most 
wondrous,  most  impotent,  most  weak,  and  most  subtle  miracle  of  Divine  power,  the 
earth, his cradle and dwelling-place, is in regard to meaning and art, the universe’s heart 
and centre; despite its smallness and lowliness in relation to the heavens, it is the display 
and exhibition of all the miracles of Divine art; the place of reflection and point of focus 
of  the  manifestations  of  all  the  Divine  Names;  the  place  of  display  and  reflection  of 
infinite  dominical  activity;  the  means  and  market  of  boundless  Divine  creativity  and 
especially the  munificent creation of the  numerous species of plants and small  animals; 
and the  

 

361 

place in small measure of samples of the creatures of the broad worlds of the hereafter; it 
is  a  rapidly  working  loom  weaving  everlasting  textiles;  the  swiftly  changing  place 
producing  views  for  eternal  panoramas;  and  the  narrow  and  temporary  arable  field  and 
seed-bed producing at speed the seeds for everlasting gardens. 

It is  because of this  vastness of  meaning and  importance of art of the earth that the 
All-Wise Qur’an holds it –like a tiny fruit of the vast tree of the heavens– equal to all the 
heavens, like holding a tiny heart equivalent to a huge body. It places it in one pan of a 
scales  and  places  all  the  heavens  in  the  other,  and  repeatedly  says:  “Sustainer  of  the 
heavens and the earth.” Compare other matters with this and understand that the soulless, 
dim truths of philosophy cannot clash with the brilliant, living truths of the Qur’an. Since 
the point of view is different, they appear differently. 

FOURTH BRANCH 

Are  you  not  aware  that  before  God  prostrate  themselves  all  that  are  in  the 
heavens and all that are on earth – the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the 
mountains, and the trees, and the beasts, and a great number among mankind? 
But a great number are such as are fit for punishment; and such as God  shall 
disgrace, none can raise to honour; for, verily, God does what He wills.24 

We shall point out only a single jewel from the treasure of this extensive and sublime 

verse. It is as follows: 

The  All-Wise  Qur’an  states  clearly  that  everything,  from  the  heavens  to  the  earth, 
from  the  stars  to  flies,  from  angels  to  fishes,  and  from  planets  to  particles,  prostrates, 
worships, praises and glorifies Almighty God. But their worship varies according to their 
capacities and the Divine Names that they  manifest;  it  is all different. We shall  explain 
one of the varieties of their worship with a comparison. 

For  example,  And  God’s  is  the  highest  similitude,  when  a  mighty  lord  of  all 

dominion builds a city or splendid palace, he employs four categories of workers. 

THE FIRST CATEGORY are his slaves and bondsmen. This sort receive no wage or 
remuneration,  but  for  each  item  of  work  that  they  carry  out  through  their  lord’s 
command, they experience a subtle pleasure and pleasant eagerness. Whatever they utter 
by  way  of  praise  and  description  of  their  lord  increases  their  pleasure  and  eagerness. 
Knowing  their  connection  with  their  holy  lord  to  be  a  great  honour,  they  content 
themselves with that. Also they find pleasure from looking to their work with the view of 
their lord, and  

                                                

24 Qur’an, 22:18. 

 

362 

for his sake and in his name. They are not in need of any wage, rank, or remuneration. 

THE SECOND CATEGORY are ordinary servants. They do not know why they are 
working  or that they  are  being  employed  by  the  glorious  lord.  He  causes  them  to  work 
through his own ideas and knowledge and gives them an appropriately small wage. These 
servants are unaware of what various and comprehensive aims and exalted matters result 
as  a  consequence  of  their  work.  Some  of  them  even  imagine  that  their  work  concerns 
themselves alone and has no aim besides their wage. 

THE  THIRD  CATEGORY:  The  lord  of  all  dominion  has  some  animals  which  he 
employs  in  various  jobs  in  the  construction  of  the  city  and  palace.  He  only  gives  them 
fodder, but their working at tasks suitable for their abilities gives them pleasure. For, if a 
potentiality or ability is realized in action and work, there is a breathing in and expansion 
and this results in pleasure. The pleasure to be had from all activity stems from this. The 
wage and remuneration of this sort of servant, then, is only fodder and that pleasure. 

THE FOURTH CATEGORY are workers who know what they are doing, and why 
and  for  whom  they  are  working,  and  why  the  other  workers  are  working,  and  what the 
purpose of the lord of all dominion is, and why he is causing them to work. Workers of 
this  category  are  therefore  bosses  and  supervisors  over the other  workers. They  receive 
remuneration that is graded according to their rank and degree. 

In exactly the same way, the Sustainer of  All the  Worlds,  Who  is the  All-Glorious 
Lord of  the  heavens  and  the  earth  and  the  All-Beauteous  Builder  of  this  world  and  the 
hereafter, employs both angels, and animals, and inanimate beings and plants, and human 
beings in the palace of this world, in this realm of causality. He employs them not out of 
need,  for  the  Creator of  everything  is  He,  but  for  certain  instances  of  wisdom,  like  the 
functioning of His might, sublimity, and dominicality. He causes them to worship and has 
charged these four categories with different duties of worship. 

The  First  Category  is  the  angels,  who  are  represented  in  the  comparison  by  the 
slaves. For the angels there is no endeavour and progress; they all have their fixed station 
and  determined  rank,  and  receive  a  particular  pleasure  from  the  work  itself  and  an 
emanation from their worship. That is to say, the reward of these servants is found within 
their duties. Just as man is nourished by air, water, light, and food, and receives pleasure 
from  them,  so  are  the  angels  nourished  by  the  varieties  of  remembrance,  glorification, 
praise, worship, knowledge, and love of God, and take pleasure in them. For, since they 
are  created  out  of  light,  light  is  sufficient  for  their  sustenance.  Fragrant  scents,  even, 
which  are  close  to  light,  are  a  sort  of  nourishment  for  them  which  they  enjoy.  Indeed, 
good spirits take pleasure in sweet smells. 

 

363 

Furthermore, there is in the tasks that the angels perform at the command of the One 
Whom  they  worship,  in  the  work  they  accomplish  for  His  sake,  in  the  service  they 
discharge in His name, in the supervision they execute through His favour, in the honour 
they gain through their connection with Him,  in the  immaculateness they attain through 
studying His dominion in both its outer face and its face which looks to Him, and in the 
ease  they  find  through  beholding  the  manifestations  of  His  beauty  and  glory,  such 
sublime  bliss  that  the  human  mind  cannot  comprehend  it,  and  one  who  is  not  an  angel 
cannot perceive it. 

One sort of the angels are worshippers, and the worship of another sort is in work. Of 
the angels of the earth, the sort that are workers have a kind of human occupation. If one 
may say so, one type are like shepherds and another like farmers. That is to say, the face 
of  the  earth  is  like  a  general  farm  and  an  appointed  angel  supervises  all  the  species  of 
animals  within  it  through  the  command  of  the  All-Glorious  Creator,  and  with  His 
permission,  for  His  sake  and  through  His  power  and  strength.  And  for  each  species  of 
animal there is a lesser angel who is is appointed to act as a special shepherd. 

The face of the earth is also a place of cultivation; the plants are all sown in it. There 
is an angel charged with supervising them in the name of God Almighty and through His 
power, and there are angels who are lesser than him and who worship and glorify God by 
supervising particular species. The Archangel Michael (Peace be upon him), who is one 
of the bearers of the throne of sustenance, is the most important overseer of these. 

The  angels  who  are  in  the  position  of  shepherd  and  farmer  do  not  bear  any 
resemblance  to  human  beings,  for  their  supervision  is  purely  for  the  sake  of  Almighty 
God,  and  in  His  name  and  through  His  power  and  command.  Their  supervision  of 
animals  consists  only  of  beholding  the  manifestations  of  dominicality  in  the  species 
where they are employed; studying the manifestations of power and mercy in it; making 
known to that species the Divine commands by way of a sort of inspiration; and in some 
way ordering the voluntary actions of the species. 

Their  supervision  of  the  plants  in  the  field  of  the  earth  in  particular  consists  of 
representing  the  plants’  glorification  in  the  angelic  tongue;  proclaiming  in  the  angelic 
tongue the salutations the plants offer to the All-Glorious Creator through their lives; and 
employing the faculties given to plants correctly and directing them towards certain aims 
and ordering them to some extent. These duties of the angels are meritorious actions of a 
sort  by  reason  of  the  angels’  faculty  of  will.  Indeed,  they  are  a  kind  of  worship  and 
adoration.  But  the  angels  have  no  real  power  of  disposal,  for  on  everything  is  a  stamp 
peculiar to the Creator of all things. Another’s hand cannot interfere in creation. That is 
to  say,  this  sort of  work of  the  angels  forms  their  worship.  It  is  not  a  custom  like  with 
human beings. 

 

364 

The Second Category of workers  in this palace  of the universe are animals. Since 
animals also have an appetitive soul and faculty of will, their work is not ‘purely for the 
sake  of  God;’  to  some  extent,  they  take  a  share  for  their  souls.  Therefore,  since  the 
Glorious  and  Munificent  Lord of  All  Dominion  is  all-generous,  He  bestows  a  wage  on 
them  during  their  work  so  that  their  souls  receive  a  share.  For  example,  the  All-Wise 
Creator  employs  the  famous  nightingale,25  renowned  for  his  love  of  the  rose,  for  five 
aims. 

First Aim: It is the official employed to proclaim in the name of the animal species 

the intense relationship that exists between them and the plant species. 

Second Aim: It is a dominical orator from among the animals, who are like guests of 
the All-Merciful One needy for sustenance, employed to acclaim the gifts sent by the All-
Generous Provider, and to announce their joy. 

Third Aim: It is to announce to everyone the welcome offered to plants, which are 

sent for the assistance of his fellow animals. 

Fourth Aim: It is to announce, over the blessed heads and to the beautiful  faces of 
plants, the intense need of the animal species for them, which reaches the degree of love 
and passion. 

Fifth  Aim:  It  is  to  present  with  acute  yearning  at  the  Court  of  Mercy  of  the  All-
Glorious  and  Beauteous  and  Munificent  Lord  of  All  Dominion  a  most  graceful 
glorification inspired by the truly delicate face of the rose. 

There are further meanings similar to these five aims, and they are the purpose of the 
deeds the nightingale performs for the sake of Truth (All glory be unto Him and may He 
be exalted). The nightingale speaks in his own tongue, but we understand these meanings 
from his plaintive words. If he himself does not altogether know the meaning of his own 
song  like  the  angels  do,  it  does  not  impair  our  understanding.  The  saying,  “One  who 
listens understands better than the one who speaks” is well-known. Also, the nightingale 
does not show that he does not know these aims in detail, but this does not mean that they 
do not exist. At least he informs you of them like a clock informs you of the time. What 
difference does it make if he does not know? It does not prevent you from knowing. 

However, the nightingale’s small wage is the delight he experiences from gazing on 
the smiling, beautiful roses, and the pleasure he receives from conversing with them and 
pouring out his woes. That is to say, his sorrowful  song  is not a complaint arising  from 
animal grief, it is thanks in return for the gifts of the Most Merciful. Compare the bee, the 
spider, the ant, creeping insects, the male animals that are the means of reproduction, and 
the nightingales of all small creatures, with the nightingale: the deeds of all of them  

                                                

imaginary, it is the truth. 

25 Since the nightingale speaks poetically, our discussion also becomes poetic for a bit. But it is not 

 

365 

have  numerous  aims.  For  them,  too,  a  particular  pleasure,  like  a  small  wage,  has  been 
included in their duties. Through that pleasure, they serve the important aims contained in 
dominical  art.  Just  as  an  ordinary  seaman  acts  as  helmsman  on  an  imperial  ship  and 
receives a small wage, so do the animals employed in duties of glorification each receive 
a small wage. 

An  Addendum  to  the  Discussion  on  the  Nightingale:  However,  do  not  suppose 
this  proclaiming  and  heralding  and  these  songs  of  glorification  are  peculiar  to  the 
nightingale.  In  most  species  there  is  a  class  similar to the  nightingale  that  consists  of  a 
fine individual or individuals which represent the finest feelings of that species with the 
finest glorification and  finest poetry. The  nightingales of  flies and  insects, in particular, 
are  both  numerous  and  various.  Through  their  humming  poetry  they  make  all  animals 
with  ears,  from  the  largest  to  the  smallest,  hear  their  glorifications,  and  give  them 
pleasure.  

Some of them are nocturnal. These poetry-declaiming friends of all small animals are 
their sweet-voiced orators when all beings are plunged into the silence and tranquillity of 
the night. Each is the centre of a circle of silent recollection, an assembly in solitude, to 
which all the others listen, and, in a fashion, recollect and extol the All-Glorious Creator 
in their own hearts. 

Another sort are diurnal. By day, in spring and summer, they proclaim the mercy of 
the Most Merciful and Compassionate One to all animate beings from the pulpits of the 
trees with their ringing voices, subtle songs, and poetic glorifications. It is as if, like the 
leader  of  a  gathering  for  the  recitation  of  God’s  Names  induces  the  ecstasy  of  those 
participating, all the creatures listening start to praise the All-Glorious Creator each in its 
own special tongue and with a particular chant. 

That is to say, every sort of being, and even the stars, have a chief-reciter and light-
scattering  nightingale.  But  the  most  excellent,  the  most  noble,  the  most  luminous,  the 
most  dazzling,  the  greatest  and  the  most  honourable  nightingale,  whose  voice  was  the 
most  ringing,  whose  attributes  the  most  brilliant,  whose  recitation  the  most  complete, 
whose thanks the  most universal, whose essence  was the  most perfect, and whose  form 
the most beautiful, who brought all the beings of the heavens and the earth in the garden 
of  the  universe  to  ecstasy  and  rapture  through  his  subtle  poetry,  his  sweet  song,  his 
exalted glorification, was the glorious nightingale of human kind, the nightingale of the 
Qur’an:  Muhammad  the  Arabian,  Upon  whom  and  upon  whose  Family  and  those  who 
resemble him be the best of blessings and peace. 

To  Conclude:  The  animals,  who  serve  in  the  palace  of  the  universe,  conform  with 
complete  obedience  to  the  creational  commands  and  display  perfectly  in  the  name  of 
Almighty  God  the  aims  included  in  their  natures.  The  glorification  and  worship  they 
perform by carrying out the duties related to  

 

366 

their  lives  in  this  wonderful  fashion  through  the  power of  God  Almighty,  are  gifts  and 
salutations which they present to the Court of the All-Glorious Creator, the Bestower of 
Life. 

The  Third  Category  of  Workers  are  plants  and  inanimate  creatures.  Since  they 
have no faculty of will, they receive no wage. Their work is ‘purely for the sake of God,’ 
and in His name, on His account, and through His will, power and strength. However, it 
may be perceived from their growth and development that they receive a sort of pleasure 
from  their  duties  of  pollination  and  producing  seeds  and  fruits.  But they  experience  no 
pain at all. Due to their will, animals experience pain as well as pleasure. Since will does 
not  enter  into the  work of  plants  and  inanimate  beings,  their  work  is  more  perfect than 
that of animals, who have will. Among those who possess will, the work of creatures like 
the bee which are enlightened by revelation and inspiration is more perfect than the work 
of those animals which rely on their faculty of will.  

All the species of plants in the field of the face of the earth pray and ask of the All-
Wise  Creator  through  their  tongues  of  disposition  and  potentiality:  “O  our  Sustainer! 
Give us strength so that by raising the  flag of our species  in every part of the earth, we 
may proclaim the splendour of Your dominicality; and grant us prosperity so that we may 
worship You in every corner of the mosque of the earth; and bestow on us the power to 
spread  and  travel  in  order  to  exhibit  through  our  particular  tongue  the  embroideries  of 
Your Most Beautiful Names and Your wonderful, antique arts.” 

The  All-Wise  Creator  answers  their  silent  prayer  and  bestows  on  the  seeds  of  one 
species  tiny  wings  made  of  hair:  they  fly  away  spreading  everywhere.  They  cause  the 
Divine  Names  to  be  read  in  the  name  of  their  species.  (Like  the  seeds  of  most  thorned 
plants and some  yellow  flowers.) He gives to some  species  beautiful  flesh that  is either 
necessary  or  pleasant  for  human  beings;  He  causes  man  to  serve  them  and  plant  them 
everywhere. To some He gives, covering a hard and indigestible bone, flesh that animals 
eat so that they disperse the seeds over a wide area. On some He bestows small claws that 
grip onto all who touch them; moving on to other places, they raise the flag of the species 
and  exhibit  the  antique  art of  the  All-Glorious  Maker.  And  to  some  species,  like  to the 
bitter  melon,  He  gives  the  force  of  a  buckshot  rifle  so  that,  when  the  time  is  ripe,  the 
small  melons  which  are  its  fruits,  fall  and  fire  out their  seeds  like  shot to  a  distance  of 
several metres, and sow them. They work so that numerous tongues will glorify the All-
Glorious Creator and recite His Beautiful Names. You may think of other examples in the 
same way. 

The  All-Wise  Creator,  Who  is  All-Powerful  and  All-Knowing,  has  created 
everything beautifully and with perfect order. He has  fitted them out beautifully, turned 
their faces towards beautiful aims, employed them in  

 

367 

beautiful duties, caused them to utter beautiful glorifications and to worship beautifully. 
O  man!  If  indeed  you  are  a  human  being,  do  not  confuse  nature,  chance,  futility,  and 
misguidance with these beautiful matters. Do not make them ugly. Do not act in an ugly 
fashion. Do not be ugly! 

The Fourth Category are human beings. Human beings, who are servants of a sort 
in the palace of the universe, resemble both angels and animals. They resemble angels in 
universality of worship, extensiveness of supervision, comprehensiveness of knowledge, 
and in being heralds of Divine dominicality. However, man is more comprehensive in his 
worship, but since he has an appetitive soul that is disposed towards evil, contrary to the 
angels, he is subject to progress and decline, which is of great importance. Also, since in 
his work man seeks pleasure for his soul and a share for himself, he resembles an animal. 
Since this is so, man receives two wages: the first is insignificant, animal, and immediate; 
the second, angelic, universal, and postponed. 

Now, man’s duty and his wages, and his progress and decline, have been discussed 
in part  in  all thirty-three of the  Words, and  have  been explained  in  greater detail  in the 
Eleventh  and  Twenty-Third  Words  in  particular.  We  shall  therefore  cut  short  the 
discussion here and close the door. And beseeching the Most Merciful to open to us the 
gates of His mercy, and seeking forgiveness for our faults and errors, we conclude it here. 

FIFTH BRANCH 

The Fifth Branch has five ‘Fruits’. 

FIRST FRUIT 
O  my self-worshipping soul! O  my world-worshipping  friend! Love  is the cause of 
the universe’s existence, and what binds it; and it is both the light of the universe and its 
life. Since man is the most comprehensive fruit of the universe, a  love that will conquer 
the  universe  has  been  included  in  his  heart,  the  seed  of  that  fruit.  Thus,  only  one 
possessing infinite perfection may be worthy of such an infinite love.  

O  soul  and  O  friend!  Two  faculties,  through  which  one  may  experience  fear  and 
love,  have  been  included  in  man’s  nature.  This  love  and  fear  are  bound  to  be  turned 
towards  either  creatures  or  Creator.  However,  fear  of  creatures  is  a  grievous  affliction, 
while love for them is a calamitous tribulation. For you will fear people who will neither 
pity you nor accept your pleas for mercy. So fear is a grievous calamity. As for love, the 
one  you  love will either  not recognize  you or will depart without bidding  you  farewell. 
Like your youth and property. Or else he will despise you because of your love. Have you 
not  noticed  that  in  ninety-nine  out  of  a  hundred  cases  of  metaphorical  love,  the  lover 
complains about the beloved. For to love and idol 

 

368 

ize worldly beloveds with the inner heart, which is the mirror of the Eternally Besought 
One,  oppresses  the  beloved,  and  he  finds  it  disagreeable  and  rejects  it.  Because  man’s 
nature rejects and casts away things that are contrary to it and unworthy of it. (Physical 
loves are outside our discussion.) 

That  is to say, the things  you  love either will  not recognize  you, or they will  scorn 
you, or they will not accompany you. They will part from you in spite of you. Since this 
is  so, direct your  fear and  love to the One  by  Whom  your  fear will  become pleasurable 
abasement, and your love, shadowless happiness. Yes, to fear the Glorious Creator means 
finding  a  way  to  His  compassionate  mercy,  and  taking  refuge  in  it.  Fear  is  a  whip;  it 
drives  you  into the embrace of His  mercy. It  is  well-known that a  mother gently  scares 
her  infant,  for example, and draws  it to her breast. The  fear  is  most pleasurable  for the 
child, because it drives him to her tender embrace. Whereas the tenderness of all mothers 
is but a flash of Divine mercy. That means there is a supreme pleasure in fear of God. If 
there is such pleasure in fear of God, it is clear what infinite pleasure there is to be found 
in  love  of  God.  Moreover,  one  who  fears  God  is  saved  from  the  calamitous  and 
distressing fear of others. Also, because it is for God’s sake, the love he has for creatures 
is not tinged with sorrow and separation. 

Indeed,  man  loves  firstly  himself,  then  his  relations,  then  his  nation,  then  living 
creatures, then  the  universe,  and  the  world.  He  is  connected  with  all  these  spheres.  He 
may receive pleasure at their pleasure and pain at their pain. However, since  nothing  is 
stable in this world of upheavals and revolutions swift as the wind, man’s wretched heart 
is constantly wounded. The things his hands cling onto tear at them as they depart, even 
severing  them.  He  remains  in  perpetual  distress,  or  else  plunges  into  heedless 
drunkenness. Since it is thus, my soul, if you have sense, gather together all those loves 
and  give  them  to their  true owner;  be  saved  from those  calamities.  These  infinite  loves 
are  particular  to  One  possessing  infinite  perfection  and  beauty.  When  you  give  it  to  its 
true owner, you will be able to love everything without distress in His name and as His 
mirrors.  That  means  this  love  should  not  be  spent  directly  on  the  universe.  Otherwise, 
while being a delicious bounty, it becomes a grievous affliction. 

There is another aspect besides, O soul! and it is the most important. You spend all 
your love on yourself. You make your own soul your object of worship and beloved. You 
sacrifice  everything  for  your  soul.  Simply,  you  ascribe  to  it  a  sort  of  dominicality. 
Whereas the cause of love is either perfection, because perfection is loved for itself, or it 
is benefit, or it is pleasure, or it is goodness, or causes like these. Now, O soul! In several 
of the Words we have proved decisively that your essential nature is kneaded out of fault, 
deficiency, poverty, and impotence, and like the relative degree of darkness and obscurity 
shows the brightness of light, with regard to opposites, you act  

 

369 

as  a  mirror through them  to the  perfection,  beauty,  power,  and  mercy  of  the  Beauteous 
Creator. That means O soul, that it is not love you should have for your soul, but enmity, 
or you should pity it, or after it is at peace, have compassion on it. If you love your soul 
because it is the source of pleasure and benefit and you are captivated by their delights, 
do not prefer the pleasure and benefit of the soul, which is a mere jot, to infinite pleasure 
and benefits. Do not resemble a fire-fly. For it drowns all your friends and the things you 
love in the darkness of desolation and suffices with a tiny glimmer in itself. You should 
love  a  Pre-Eternal  Beloved  on  Whose  gracious  favours  are  dependent  all  the  pleasures 
and benefits of your soul together with all the benefits and bounties and creatures of the 
universe  with  which  you  are  connected  and  from  which  you  profit  and  through  whose 
happiness  you  are  happy,  so  then  you  may  take  pleasure  at  both  your  own  and  their 
happiness, and receive an infinite pleasure from the love of the Absolutely Perfect One. 

Anyway, your intense love for yourself and your soul is love for the Divine Essence 
which you misuse and spend on your own self. In which case, rend the egotism in your 
soul and show Him. All your loves dispersed through the universe are love given to you 
to spend on His Names  and attributes. You have  used  it wrongly and  you are  suffering 
the penalty.  For the penalty  for an  illicit,  mis-spent  love  is  merciless torment. For sure, 
one  particle  of  the  love  of  a  Pre-Eternal  Beloved  Who,  through  the  Names  of  Most 
Merciful and Compassionate, has prepared a dwelling like Paradise adorned with houris 
for  you  in  which  all  your  bodily  desires  will  be  gratified,  and  through  others  of  His 
Names  has  readied  for  you  in  that  Paradise  everlasting  favours  that  will  satisfy  all  the 
longings of your spirit, heart, mind, and other subtle inner faculties, and in all of Whose 
Names are contained many treasuries of grace and munificence – one particle of His love 
may take the place of the whole universe. But the universe cannot take the place of even a 
particular  manifestation of His  love. In which  case, heed this Pre-Eternal Decree which 
that Pre-Eternal Beloved caused His own Beloved to announce, and follow it: 

If you love God, follow me, and God will love you.26 

SECOND FRUIT 

O  soul!  Worship  is  not  the  introduction  to  additional  rewards,  but  the  result  of 
previous bounties. Yes, we have received our wage, and are accordingly charged with the 
duties  of  service  and  worship.  Because,  O  soul!,  since  the  All-Glorious  Creator,  Who 
clothed  you  in  existence  which  is  pure  good,  has  given  you  a  stomach  and  appetite, 
through His Name of Provider, He has placed before you all foods on a table of bounties. 
Then, since He has given you a life decked out with senses, life too requires sustenance 
like a  

                                                

26 Qur’an, 3:31.

stomach; all your senses like eyes and ears are like hands before which He has placed a 
table of bounties as broad as the earth. Then, because He has given you humanity, which 
requires  many  immaterial  foods  and  bounties,  He  has  laid  out  before  that  stomach  of 
humanity, in so far as the hand of the mind can reach, an extensive table of bounties as 
broad as the worlds of both the inner and outer dimensions of things. Then, since He has 
given  you  Islam  and  belief,  which  require  infinite  bounties  and  are  nourished  through 
countless fruits of mercy and are supreme humanity, He has opened up before you a table 
of  bounties,  pleasure,  and  happiness  which  includes  the  sphere  of  contingency  together 
with the sphere of His sacred Names and attributes. Then, through giving you love, which 
is a light of belief, He has bestowed on you an endless table of bounties, happiness, and 
pleasure. That is to say, with regard to your corporeality you are an insignificant, weak, 
impotent, lowly, restricted, limited particular, but through His favour, you have as though 
risen from being an insignificant particular to being a universal, luminous whole. For by 
giving  you  life,  He  has  raised  you  from  particularity  to  a  sort  of  universality;  and  by 
giving you humanity, to true universality; and by bestowing Islam on you, to an exalted, 
luminous universality; and  by giving  you knowledge and  love of Him, He  has  elevated 
you to an all-encompassing light. 

O  soul!  You  have  received  this  wage,  and  you  are  charged  with  the  pleasurable, 
bountiful, easy, and light duty of worship. But you are lazy in this too. If you perform it 
half-heartedly,  it  is  as  though  the  former  wages  are  insufficient  for  you  and  you  are 
overbearingly wanting greater things.  Also,  you are complaining:  “Why  was  my prayer 
not accepted?” But your right is not complaint, it is supplication. Through His pure grace 
and munificence, Almighty God bestows Paradise and eternal happiness. So seek refuge 
in His mercy and munificence constantly. Trust in Him and heed this decree: 

Say:  “In  the  bounty  of  God,  and  His  mercy  –in  that  let  them  rejoice;”  that  is 
better than the [wealth] they hoard.27 

If  you  say:  “How  can  I  respond  to  these  countless,  universal  bounties  with  my 

limited and partial thanks?” 

The Answer: With a universal intention and boundless belief... For example, a man 
enters a king’s presence with a gift worth five kurush, and he sees that other gifts worth 
millions have arrived from acceptable people, and have been lined up there. It occurs to 
him: “My present is nothing. What shall I do?” Then he says suddenly: “My Lord! I offer 
you all these valuable gifts in my name. For you are worthy of them. If I had the power, I 
would have given you gifts equal to them.” Thus, the king, who has need of  

                                                

27 Qur’an, 10:58. 

 

371 

nothing and accepts his subjects’ gifts as a sign of their loyalty and respect, accepts that 
wretched man’s universal intention and wish, and the worthiness of his elevated belief as 
though it was the greatest gift. 

In exactly the same way, while performing the five daily prayers an impotent servant 
of  Almighty  God  declares:  “Salutations  be  to  God!”  That  is,  “I  offer  You  on  my  own 
account all the gifts of worship all creatures offer  you through their  lives. If I had been 
able, I would have offered You as many salutations as them, for You are worthy of them, 
and worthy of more besides.” Such an intention and belief comprise extensive universal 
thanks. The seeds and grains of plants are their intentions. 

And for example, the melon utters a thousand intentions in its heart in the form of the 
nuclei  of  its  seeds:  “O  my  Creator!  I  want  to  proclaim  the  embroideries  of  Your  Most 
Beautiful  Names  in  many  places  on  the  earth.”  Since  Almighty  God  knows  how  future 
things  will  come  about,  He  accepts  their  intention  as  actual  worship.  The  rule,  “A 
believer’s  intention  is  better than  his  actions”28  alludes  to this  mystery.  The  wisdom  in 
offering  glorifications  in  also  infinite  numbers  is  understood  from  this  mystery.  For 
instance: 

Glory and praise be unto You to the number of Your creatures, that may be  as 
pleasing to You as the extent of Your Throne and the ink of Your words, and we 
glorify You with all the glorifications of Your prophets and saints and angels.29 

Just as an officer presents all the duties of his soldiers to the king in his own name, 
so man, who acts as officer to other creatures, commands the animals and plants, has the 
capacity  to  be  vicegerent  over  the  beings  of  the  earth,  and  in  his  own  world  considers 
himself to represent everyone, declares: 

You alone do we worship, and from You alone do we seek help;30 

He offers the worship and seeking of help of all creation to the All-Glorious True Object 
of Worship in his own name. He also says: 

O  God!  Grant  blessings  to  Muhammad  to  the  number  of  the  particles  in 
existence and all their compounds! 

He  offers  benedictions  for  the  Prophet  (PBUH)  in  the  name  of  everything.  Because 
everything  is  connected  with  the  Muhammadan  Light.  Thus,  you  may  understand  the 
wisdom in the countless numbers mentioned in the glorifications and benedictions for the 
Prophet (PBUH).

THIRD FRUIT 

O soul! If, in a brief life, you want to do something that will profit you infinitely in 
the hereafter, and you want every moment of your life to be as beneficial as a life-time, 
and  if  you  want  to  transform  your  habitual  actions  into  worship  and  your  heedlessness 
into  awareness  of  the  Divine  presence,  follow  the  Illustrious  Practices  of  the  Prophet 
(PBUH). For when you apply your actions to the rulings of the Shari’a, it affords a sort of 
awareness of God’s presence; it becomes worship of a sort and yields many fruits for the 
hereafter.  For  example,  you  bought  something.  The  moment  you  applied  what  is 
acceptable and required by the Shari’a, that ordinary act of shopping acquired the value 
of  worship.  Recalling  the  injunctions  of  the  Shari’a  calls  to  mind  Revelation.  And  by 
thinking of the Lawgiver, you are turned towards God. And that makes you aware of His 
presence.  That  means,  in  applying  the  Illustrious  Sunna  to  your  actions,  are  advantages 
like  making  this  fleeting  life  the  means  of  gaining  an  everlasting  life  which  produces 
eternal fruits. Heed the decree: 

So  believe  in  God  and  His  Messenger,  the  unlettered  Prophet,  who  believes  in 
God and His Word: follow him that you may be guided.31 

Try  to  reflect  comprehensively  the  effulgence  and  manifestation  of  all  of  the  Most 
Beautiful Names, whose manifestations are diffused within the ordinances of the Shari’a 
and Illustrious Sunna... 

FOURTH FRUIT 

O soul! Do not look at the worldly, and especially the dissipated and the unbelievers, 
and be deceived by their superficial glitter and illicit pleasures; do not imitate them. For 
even  if  you do imitate them,  you will  not be  like them;  you will decline  immeasurably. 
You  cannot  be  an  animal  even.  For the  intellect  in  your  head  becomes  an  inauspicious 
tool which constantly beats you over the head. For example, there is a palace and in one 
of its large apartments is a powerful electric lamp. Small electric lights which branch out 
from  it  and  are  attached  to  it  have  been  divided  among  its  small  apartments.  Now, 
someone  touches  the  switch  of  the  big  light  and  turns  it  off;  all  the  apartments  are 
plunged into deep darkness and desolation. Another palace has small electric lights in all 
its apartments which are not connected to the large light. If the owner of the latter palace 
presses the switch of the large electric light and turns it off, there may still be lights on in 
the  other  apartments  by  which  he  can  carry  out  his  work,  and  which  will  not  allow 
thieves to profit from the darkness. 

O  soul!  The  first  palace  is  a  Muslim  and  the  Prophet  Muhammad  (Peace  and 

blessings be upon him) is the large electric light in his heart. If he  

                                                

31 Qur’an, 7:158. 

 

373 

forgets him, or (I seek refuge with God from Satan the Accursed) he expels him from his 
heart, he will accept none of the other prophets, indeed, no place will remain in his spirit 
for  any  perfection.  He  will  not  even  recognize  His  Sustainer.  All  the  apartments  and 
subtle  faculties  in  his  nature  will  be  plunged  into  darkness,  and  there  will  be  a  terrible 
destruction and desolation in his heart. How will he profit in the face of this destruction 
and  desolation,  where  will  he  find  familiarity?  What  benefit  will  he  secure  which  will 
repair the damage? However, Europeans resemble the second palace; even if they cast out 
from their hearts the light of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him), 
lights of a sort may remain, or they suppose they remain. They  may continue to have a 
sort of belief in their Creator and in Moses and Jesus (Peace be upon them), which will 
allow them to attain good morals and character.  

O my evil-commanding soul! If you say: “I am not a European and I want to be an 
animal,”  how  many  times  have  I  told  you:  “You  cannot  be  an  animal.  For  there  is 
intelligence  in  your  head,  and  it  strikes  your  face,  eyes,  and  head  with  the  pains  of  the 
past  and  fears  of  the  future,  and  beats  you.  It  adds  a  thousand  pains  to  one  pleasure. 
Whereas animals receive pleasure without pain. So first pluck out your intelligence and 
throw  it  away,  then  be  an  animal!  You  will  also  receive  the  chastening  slap  of  ‘Like 
cattle, nay, they are further astray.’”32 

FIFTH FRUIT 

O  my  soul!  As  we  have  stated  repeatedly,  since  man  is  the  fruit  of  the  tree  of 
creation, he is a creature which, like a fruit, is the furthest and most comprehensive and 
looks  to  everything,  and  bears  the  seed  of  a  heart  which  holds  within  it  the  aspects  of 
unity of everything, and whose  face  looks to multiplicity, transience, and the world. As 
for worship, it is a line of union which turns his face from transience to permanence, from 
creation to Creator, from multiplicity to unity, and from the extremity to the source, or it 
is  a  point  of  union  between  the  source  and  the  extremity.  If  a  valuable,  conscious  fruit 
which will  form a  seed  looks to the  living creatures beneath the tree, and relying on  its 
beauty throws itself into their hands; if being heedless, it falls; it will fall to their hands 
and  be  smashed,  and  will  go  for  nothing  like  a  common  fruit.  But  if  the  fruit  finds  its 
point of support, and  it is able to think  that by the seed within  it holding the aspects of 
unity  of  the  whole  tree,  it  will  be  the  means  of  tree’s  continuance  and  the  continued 
existence  of  the  tree’s  reality,  then  a  single  seed  within  that  single  fruit  will  manifest  a 
perpetual universal truth within an everlasting life. 

In the same way, if man plunges into multiplicity, is drowned in the  

                                                

32 Qur’an, 7:179. 

 

374 

universe  and  intoxicated  by  love  of  the  world,  is  deceived  by  the  smiles  of  ephemeral 
beings and casts himself into their arms, he certainly falls into infinite loss. He falls into 
both transitoriness, and ephemerality, and non-existence. In effect he sentences himself to 
death. But if he listens with the ear of his heart to the lessons in belief from the tongue of 
the Qur’an and raises his head and turns towards unity, he may rise through the ascension 
of worship to the throne of perfections. He may become an eternal man. 

O  my  soul!  Since  the  reality  is  thus,  and  since  you  are  a  member  of  the  nation  of 
Abraham (Peace be upon him), like Abraham, say: “I love not those that set.”33 Turn your 
face to the Eternal Beloved and weep the following lines like me. The Persian verses to 
be included here have been included in the Second Station of the Seventeenth Word, and 
have not been repeated here.

The Twenty-Fifth Word 
The Miraculousness of the Qur’an 

While  there  is  a  perpetual  miracle  like  the  Qur’an,  searching  for  further 

proof appears to my mind as superfluous; 

While there is a proof of reality like the Qur’an, would silencing those who 

deny it weigh heavily on my heart? 

A REMINDER 

[At  the  start,  our  intention  was  to  write  this  Word  in  the  form  of  five 
‘Lights’,  but  at  the  end  of  the  First  Light,  we  were  compelled  to  write 
extremely fast in order to print it in the old [Ottoman] script.1 On some days 
even  we  wrote  twenty  to  thirty  pages  in  two  or  three  hours.  Therefore, 
writing  three  Lights  in  a  brief  and  concise  manner,  we  have  for  now 
abandoned  the  last  two.  I  hope  that  my  brothers  will  look  fairly  and  with 
tolerance at any faults and defects, difficulties and mistakes, which may be 
attributed to me.] 

Most  of  the  verses  in  this  treatise  of  The  Miraculousness  of  the  Qur’an  have 
either been the cause of criticism by atheists, or have been objected to by scientists, or 
have been the subject of doubt and misgiving by satans among  jinn and men. Thus, 
this  Twenty-Fifth  Word  has  explained  the  truths  and  fine  points  of  those  verses  in 
such a way that the very points which the atheists and scientists imagined to be faults 
have  been  proved  according  to  scholarly  principles  to  be  flashes  of  miraculousness 
and  the  sources  of  the  perfections  of  the  Qur’an’s  eloquence.  In  order  not  to  cause 
aversion, decisive answers have been given without mentioning their doubts. Only, in 
the first Station of the Twentieth Word their doubts have been stated concerning three 
or four verses, like, And the mountains [its] pegs,2 and, And the sun runs its course.3 

                                                 

1 According to a law passed in November 1928, the Arabic (Ottoman) alphabet was banned from 

the end of that year, and the Latin alphabet officially adopted. [Tr.]

376

Also, although this treatise of The Miraculousness of the Qur’an was written very 
concisely and with great speed, with regard to the science of rhetoric and sciences of 
Arabic,  it  is  explained  in  a  way  so  learned  and  profound  and  powerful  that  it  has 
caused wonder to scholars. Although everyone who studies it will not understand all 
the matters discussed, there is a significant share for everyone in this garden. In spite 
of  the  defects  in  the  phraseology  and  manner  of  expression  due  to  its  being  written 
very  fast  and  under  confused  conditions,  it  explains  the  truth  and  reality  of  most 
important matters. 

Said Nursi 

The Miraculousness of the Qur’an 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 

Say: If all mankind and all jinn were to come together to produce the like of 
this  Qur’an,  they  could not produce  the  like of  it,  even  if  they  were  to help 
and support each other.4 

 [Of the innumerable aspects of the miraculousness of the All-Wise Qur’an 
of  Miraculous  Exposition,  the  treasury  of  miracles  and  greatest  miracle  of 
Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him), I have pointed out close on 
forty  in  my  Arabic  treatises,  in  the  Arabic  Risale-i  Nur,  in  my  Qur’anic 
commentary  called  Isharat  al-I’jaz  (Signs  of  Miraculousness),  and  in  the 
preceding twenty-four Words. Now I shall explain to a degree only five of 
those  aspects  and  include  within  them  briefly  the  other  aspects,  and  in  an 
Introduction give a definition of the Qur’an and indicate its nature.] 

INTRODUCTION 

The Introduction consists of three parts. 

FIRST PART:  WHAT IS THE QUR’AN? How is it defined? 

Answer:    As  is  explained  in  the  Nineteenth  Word  and  proved  in  other  Words, 
THE  QUR’AN  is  the  pre-eternal  translator of  the  mighty  Book  of  the  Universe;  the 
post-eternal  interpreter  of  the  various  tongues  reciting  the  verses  of  creation;  the 
commentator of the book of the Worlds of the Seen and the  Unseen; the revealer of 
the treasuries of the Divine Names hidden in  

                                                 

4 Qur’an, 17:88. 

 

377

the  heavens  and  on  the  earth;  the  key  to  the  truths  concealed  beneath  the  lines  of 
events;  the  tongue  of  the  Unseen  World  in  the  Manifest  World;  the  treasury  of  the 
post-eternal favours of the Most Merciful and of the pre-eternal addresses of the Most 
Holy,  which  come  from  the  World  of  the  Unseen  beyond  the  veil  of  this  Manifest 
World; it is the  sun, foundation, and plan of the  spiritual world of Islam; the sacred 
map of  the  worlds  of  the hereafter;  the  expounding  word,  lucid  exposition,  decisive 
proof, and clear interpreter of the Divine Essence, attributes, Names, and functions; it 
is  the  instructor  of  the  world  of  humanity;  the  light  and  water  of  Islam,  the 
macroanthropos;  the  true  wisdom  of  mankind;  and  the  true  guide and  leader  urging 
humanity to prosperity and happiness; it is a both a book of law, and a book of prayer, 
and a book of wisdom, and a book of worship, and a book of command and summons, 
and a book of invocation, and a book of thought, and a unique, comprehensive sacred 
book  comprising  many  books  to  which  recourse  may  be  had for  all  the  needs  of  all 
mankind; it  is a revealed scripture resembling  a sacred library which offers treatises 
suitable  for  all  the  various  ways  and  different  paths  of  the  all  the  saints  and  the 
veracious ones and the wise and the learned, which is appropriate for the illuminations 
of each way and enlightens it, and is suitable for the course of each path and depicts it. 

SECOND PART and complement to the definition: 

As is explained and proved in the Twelfth Word, since THE QUR’AN has come 
from the Sublime Throne and the Greatest Name, and from the highest degree of each 
Name,  it  is  God’s  Word in  regard  to  His  being  Sustainer  of  All  The  Worlds;  it  is  a 
Divine decree through His title of God of All Beings; it is an address in the name of 
the  Creator of  the  Heavens  and  the  Earth;  it  is  a  conversation  in  respect of  absolute 
dominicality; it is a pre-eternal discourse on account of universal Divine sovereignty; 
it  is  a  notebook  of  the  favours  of  the  Most  Merciful  from  the  point  of  view  of  all-
embracing, all-encompassing Divine mercy; it is a collection of addresses at the start 
of which are certain ciphers in respect of the tremendousness of Divine majesty; and 
through  its  descent  from  the  comprehensiveness  of  the  Greatest  Name,  it  is  a  holy 
scripture full of wisdom which looks to and inspects all sides of the Sublime Throne. 

It  is  because  of  this  mystery  that  with  complete  fitness  the  title  of  the  Word of 
God has been  given to the Qur’an, and is always given. After the Qur’an comes the 
level  of  the  books  and  scriptures  of  the  other  prophets.  However,  those  other 
innumerable Divine Words are each in the form of inspiration made manifest through 
a special regard, a partial title, a particular manifestation, a particular Name, a special 
dominicality, a particular sovereignty, a special mercy. The inspirations of the angels 
and man and the animals vary greatly with regard to universality and particularity. 

 

378

THIRD  PART:    THE  QUR’AN  is  a  revealed  scripture  which  contains  in 
summary the books of all the prophets, whose times were all different, the writings of 
all the saints, whose paths are all different, and the works of all the purified scholars, 
whose ways are all different. Its six aspects are all brilliant and refined of the darkness 
of  doubts  and scepticism;  its  point  of  support  is  certain  heavenly  revelation  and  the 
pre-eternal Word; its aim and goal is self-evidently eternal happiness; its inner aspect 
is clearly pure guidance;  its upper aspect is necessarily the  lights of belief; its lower 
aspect is undeniably evidence and proof; its right aspect is evidently the surrender of 
the heart and conscience; its left aspect is manifestly the subjugation of the reason and 
intellect;  its  fruit  is  indisputably  the  mercy  of  the  Most  Merciful  and  the  realm  of 
Paradise; and its rank and desirability are assuredly accepted by the angels and man 
and the jinn. 

Each of the attributes in these three parts concerning the Qur’an’s definition have 
been  proved  decisively  in  other  places,  or  they  will  be  proved.  Our  claims  are  not 
isolated; each may be proved with clear proofs. 

FIRST LIGHT 

This Light consists of three ‘Rays’. 
FIRST  RAY:  This  is  the  eloquence  of  the  Qur’an,  which  is  at  the  degree  of 
miraculousness.  Its  eloquence  is  a  wonderful  eloquence  born  of  the  beauty  of  its 
word-order,  the  perfection  of  its  conciseness,  the  marvels  of  its  style, its  singularity 
and  pleasantness,  the  excellence  of  its  expression,  its  superiority  and  clarity,  the 
power  and  truth  of  its  meanings,  and  from  the  purity  and  fluency  of  its  language, 
which for one thousand three hundred years has challenged the most brilliant men of 
letters of mankind, their most celebrated orators, and the most profoundly learned of 
them, and invited them to dispute it. It has provoked them intensely. And although it 
has  invited  them  to  dispute  it,  those  geniuses,  whose  heads  touch  the  skies  in  their 
pride  and  conceit,  have  been  unable  to so  much  as open their  mouths  to do so,  and 
have bowed their heads utterly humiliated. Thus, we shall point to the miraculousness 
in its eloquence in two ‘Aspects’. 

First  Aspect:  It  possesses  miraculousness  and  its  miraculousness  exists  for  the 
following reasons. The great majority of the people of the Arabian Peninsula at that 
time were illiterate. Due to this, rather than in writing, they preserved the sources of 
their  pride,  historical  events  and  stories  encouraging  good  morality,  by  means  of 
poetry  and  eloquence.  Due  to  the  attraction  of  poetry  and  eloquence,  meaningful 
sayings would remain in people’s memories and be passed down the  generations. In 
consequence  of  this  innate  need,  therefore,  the  goods  most  in  demand  in  the 
immaterial  market  of  that  people  were  eloquence  and  fine  speech. A  tribe’s poet  or 
orator was like its greatest national hero. It was he who was their greatest source of  

 

379

pride.  Thus,  among  the  peoples  of  the  world,  the  eloquence  and  rhetoric  of  that 
intelligent people, who due to their intelligence ruled the world after the establishment 
of Islam, was at the highest and most advanced degree. It was the thing most highly 
prized among them that they felt greatest need of, and was their cause of pride. They 
attached such value to eloquence that two tribes would do battle at the word of a poet 
or orator,  and  they  would  make  peace  at  his  word.  They  even  wrote  in  gold on  the 
walls of the Ka’ba the seven qasidas of seven poets called the al-Mu’allaqat al-Sab’a, 
and  took  great  pride  in  them.  It  was  at  such  a  time  when  eloquence  was  thus  most 
sought after that the Qur’an was revealed. Just as at the time of Moses (Peace be upon 
him) it was magic that was most sought after and at the time of Jesus (Peace be upon 
him), it was medicine. The most important of their miracles were in those fields.  

The  Qur’an,  therefore, invited  the  Arabian  orators  of  that  time  to  reply  to  even 

one of the shortest of the Suras. It challenged them with the decree of: 

And  if  you are  in doubt about  what  We have  revealed  to  Our servant,  then 
produce a Sura resembling it.5 

It also said: “If you do not believe, you shall be damned and shall go to Hell.” It 
provoked  them  intensely.  It  smashed  their  pride  in  fearsome  manner.  It  was 
contemptuous of their arrogant minds. It condemned them firstly to eternal extinction 
and then to eternal extinction in Hell, as well as to worldly extinction. It said: “Either 
dispute me, or you and your property shall perish.” 

If it had been possible to dispute the Qur’an, is it at all possible that while there 
was an easy solution like disputing it with one or two lines and nullifying the claim, 
they should have chosen the most dangerous and most difficult, the way of war? Yes, 
is it at all possible that that clever people, that politically-minded nation, who at one 
time were to govern the world through politics, should have abandoned the shortest, 
easiest, and most light way, and chosen the most dangerous, which was going to cast 
their lives and all their property into peril? For if their literary figures had been able to 
dispute it with a few words, the Qur’an would have given up its claim, and they would 
have  been  saved  from  material  and  moral  disaster.  Whereas  they  chose  a  perilous, 
lengthy  road  like  war.  That  means  it  was  not possible  to  dispute  in  by  word;  it  was 
impossible, so they were compelled to fight it with the sword.  

Furthermore, there are two compelling reasons for the Qur’an being imitated. The 
first is its enemies’ ambition to dispute it, the other, its friends’ pleasure at imitating 
it. Impelled by these, millions of books in Arabic have  

                                                 

5 Qur’an, 2:23.

been written, but not one of them resembles the Qur’an. Whether learned or ignorant, 
whoever looks at it and at them is bound to say: “The Qur’an does not resemble these. 
Not one of them has been able to imitate it.” The Qur’an is therefore either inferior to 
all of them, and according to the consensus of friend and foe alike, this is completely 
non-valid and impossible, or the Qur’an is superior to all of them. 

If you say: “How do you know that no one has tried to dispute it, and that no one 
has  had sufficient confidence to challenge  it, and that  no one’s help for anyone else 
was of any avail?” 

The  Answer:  If  it  had  been  possible  to  dispute  it,  most  certainly  it  would  have 
been attempted. For it was a question of honour and pride, and life and property were 
at  risk.  If  it  had  been  attempted,  numerous  people  would  have  supported  such  an 
attempt. For those who obstinately oppose the truth  have always been many. And if 
many people had supported it, they surely would have  found fame. For insignificant 
contests, even, attracted the wonder of people and found fame in stories and tales. So 
an  extraordinary  contest  and  event  such  as  that  would  never  have  remained  secret. 
The most ugly and infamous things against Islam have been passed down and become 
famous, but apart from one or two stories about Musaylima the Liar, no such thing has 
been related. Musaylima was  very eloquent, but when compared with the exposition 
of the Qur’an, which possesses infinite beauty, his words passed into the chronicles as 
nonsense.  Thus,  the  miraculousness  of  the Qur’an’s  eloquence  is  as  certain  as  twice 
two equals four; and that is how it is. 

Second  Aspect:    We  shall  now  explain  in  five  ‘Points’  the  wisdom  of  the 

Qur’an’s miraculousness contained in its eloquence. 

First Point: There is a wonderful eloquence and purity of style in the Qur’an’s 
word-order.  From  beginning  to  end,  Isharat  al-I’jaz  (Signs  of  Miraculousness) 
demonstrates this eloquence and conciseness in the word-order. The way the second, 
minute, and hour hands of a  clock each complete the order of the others, that is the 
way  all  the  sentences  of  the  All-Wise  Qur’an,  and  its  words,  and  the  order  in  the 
relationships  between  the  sentences  and  words,  have  been  expounded  in  Isharat  al-
I’jaz,  from  it  first  page  to  its  last.  Whoever  wishes  may  look  at  that  and  see  this 
wonderful eloquence in the word-order. Here, we shall mention one or two examples 
in order to demonstrate the word-order in the parts of a sentence. For example: 

But if a breath of your Sustainer’s punishment touches them.6 

In this sentence, it wants to point out the punishment as terrible through showing the 
severity of the least amount. That is to say, it expresses littleness or fewness, and all 
the parts of the sentence look also to this littleness  

                                                 

6 Qur’an, 21:46. 

 

381

or fewness and reinforce it. Thus, the words, But if signify doubt, and doubt looks to 
littleness or fewness. The word touches means to touch lightly and expresses a small 
amount. And just as the word a breath is merely a whiff, so is it in the singular form. 
Grammatically  it  is  a  masdar  marra  and  signifies  once.  Also  the  tanwin  indicating 
indefiniteness  in  a  breathe  expresses  littleness  or  fewness  and  means  it  is  so 
insignificant that it can scarcely be known. The word of signifies division or a part; it 
means  a  bit  and  indicates  paucity.  The  word  punishment  points  to  a  light  sort  of 
punishment in relation to chastisement (nakal) or penalty (i’qab), and suggests a small 
amount.  And  by  alluding  to  compassion  and  being  used  in  place  of  Subduer,  All-
Compelling, or Avenger, the word Sustainer indicates littleness or fewness. It says, if 
the small amount of punishment suggested in all this paucity has such an effect,  you 
can  compare  how  dreadful  Divine  chastisement  would  be.  How  much  then  do  the 
small  parts  of  this  sentence  look  to  one  another  and  assist  one  another!  How  each 
reinforces the aim of the whole! This example looks to the words and aim to a small 
degree. 

Second Example: 

And  spend  [in  God’s  way]  out  of  what  We  have  bestowed  on  them  as 
sustenance.7 

The parts of this sentence point out five of the conditions which make almsgiving 

acceptable. 

First Condition: This is to give only so much alms as will not cause the giver to 
be in  need of receiving  alms  himself.  It states this condition through the division or 
parts signified by out of in the words out of what. 

Second Condition: It is not to take from ‘Ali and give to Wali, but to give out of 
a one’s own property. The words We have bestowed on them as  sustenance express 
this condition. It means: “Give out of the sustenance that is yours.” 

Third Condition: This is not to place an obligation on the recipient. The word We 
in  We  have  bestowed on  them  as  sustenance  states this  condition.  That  is  to  say:  “I 
give you the sustenance. When you give some of My property to one of My servants, 
you cannot place them under an obligation.” 

Fourth  Condition:  You  should  give  it  to  a  person  who  will  spend  it  on  his 
livelihood,  for  alms  given  to  those  who  will  squander  it  idly  is  not  acceptable.  The 
word spend points to this condition. 

Fifth Condition: This is to give in God’s name. The words We bestow on them 
as sustenance states this. That is to say: “The property is Mine; you should give it in 
My name.” 

                                                 

7 Qur’an, 2:3. 

 

382

These conditions may be extended. That is, the form almsgiving should take, with 
what goods. It may be given as learning and knowledge. It may be given as words, or 
as  acts,  or  as  advice.  The  word  what  in  out  of  what  indicates  these  various  sorts 
through its generality. Furthermore, it indicates this with the sentence itself, because it 
is  absolute  and  expresses  generality.  Thus,  with  the  five  conditions  in  this  short 
sentence describing almsgiving, it opens up a broad field before the mind, granting it 
to it through the sentence as a whole. Thus, in the sentence as a whole, the word-order 
has many aspects. 

Similarly,  the  word-order  between  words  encompasses  a  broad  sphere  and  has 
many aspects. And between phrases. For example, Say: He is God, the One8 contains 
six sentences. Three of them are positive and three negative. It proves six degrees of 
Divine unity and at the same time refutes six ways of associating partners with God. 
Each  sentence  is  both  the  proof  of  the  other  sentences  and  the  result.  For  each 
sentence  has  two  meanings.  Through  one  meaning  it  is  the  result,  and  through  the 
other  the  proof.  That  is  to  say,  within  Sura  al-Ikhlas  are  thirty  suras  composed  of 
proofs  that  demonstrate  each  another  to  be  as  well-ordered  as  the  Sura  itself.  For 
example: 

Say,  He  is  God, because  He  is  One, because  He  is  the  Eternally  Besought, 
because  He  begets  not,  because  He  is  not  begotten,  because  there  is  none 
that is equal to Him. 

And there is none that is equal to Him, because He is not begotten, because 
He  begets  not,  because  He  is  Eternally  Besought,  because  He  is  One, 
because He is God. 

And: 

And: 

He is God, so He is One, so He is the Eternally Besought, so He begets not, 
so He is not begotten, so there is none that is equal to Him. 

You can continue in the same way.  

A further example: 

Alif. Lam. Mim. * This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance 
for those who fear God.9 

Each of these four phrases has two meanings. With one meaning each is a proof 
of the other phrases, with the other, it is their result. From the sixteen threads of their 
relationships, a miraculous word-order embroidery is wrought. It is described thus in 
Isharat al-I’jaz.  Also,  as  is  explained  in  the  Thirteenth  Word,  it  is  as  though all  the 
Qur’an’s  verses  have  eyes  that  see  most  of  the  other  verses  and  faces  that  look  to 
them,  so  that each  extends  to  the  others  the  immaterial  threads  of  relationship;  each 
weaves a miraculous  

                                                 

8 Qur’an, 112:1. 
9 Qur’an, 2:1-2. 

 

383

embroidery.  From  beginning  to  end  Isharat  al-I’jaz  expounds  this  beauty  and 
eloquence of the word-order. 

Second  Point:    This  is  the  wonderful  eloquence  in  its  meaning.  Consider  this 
example,  which  is  explained  in  the  Thirteenth  Word.  For  example,  if  you  want  to 
understand the eloquence of the verse, 

All that is in the heavens and on the earth extols and glorifies God, for He is 
the Tremendous, the Wise,10 

imagine yourself in the Age of Ignorance in the deserts of barbarism before the Light 
of the Qur’an. Then, at a time everything is swathed in the darkness of ignorance and 
heedlessness  and  enveloped  in  the  lifeless  veils  of  nature,  you  hear  verses  from  the 
heavenly tongue of the Qur’an like: 

All that is in the heavens and on the earth extols and glorifies God, 

or, 

The heavens and the earth and all within them extol and glorify Him.11 

Now look! See how the dead or sleeping creatures in the world are raised to life 
in the minds of listeners at the sound of extols and glorifies Him; how they become 
conscious, and rise up and recite God’s Names. And how at the cry and light of extols 
and glorifies Him the stars, which had been lifeless lumps of fire in the black skies, all 
appear in the view of those who hear it as wisdom-displaying words in the mouth of 
the  sky  and  truth-pronouncing  lights.  The  earth,  too,  rather  than  being  a  desolate 
wasteland  is  seen  to  be  a  head  with  the  land  and  sea  as  tongues,  and  animals  and 
plants as words of glorification and praise. 

Now  consider  this  example,  which  is  proved  in  the  Fifteenth  Word.  Listen  to 

these verses. What do they say? 

O you company of jinn and men! If you can pass beyond the regions of the 
heavens and  the  earth, pass beyond  them!  But  you  will not be able  to pass 
beyond  them  save  with  authority  [given  by  God].  *  Which  then,  of  the 
blessings of your Sustainer do you deny? * A flash of fire, and smoke, will be 
sent on you, and no succour shall you have. * Which then of the blessings of 
your Sustainer do you deny?12 

And We have adorned the skies nearest the earth with lamps, and made them 
missiles to drive away the evil ones.13 

These  verses  say:  “O  men  and  jinn,  arrogant  and  refractory  in  your  impotence  and 
baseness, and rebellious and obstinate in  your weakness and poverty! If you disobey 
My commands and you have the power to do so, pass  

                                                 
10 Qur’an, 57:1; 59:1; 61:1. 
11 Qur’an, 17:44. 
12 Qur’an, 55:33-6. 
13 Qur’an, 67:5. 

 

384

beyond the boundaries of My dominions! How can you dare to oppose the commands 
of a Monarch Whose commands the stars, moons, and suns obey as though they were 
soldiers  under  orders?  In  your  rebelliousness  you  oppose  an  All-Wise  and  Glorious 
One Who has obedient soldiers which are thus awesome. Suppose your satans were to 
resist,  His  soldiers  could  rain  down  stones  on  them  like  cannon-balls.  In  your 
godlessness you revolt in the lands of a Sovereign so Glorious that among His forces 
are some which, it is not insignificant powerless creatures like you, but supposing the 
impossible  you  were  infidel  enemies  the  size  of  mountains  or  the  globe,  they  could 
hurl  down  stars  and  flaming  missiles  on  you  of  that  magnitude  and  rout  you.  You 
infringe a law which binds beings such as those; if it was necessary, they could hurl 
the globe of the earth in your face and rain down stars and heavenly bodies on you as 
though they were missiles, with God’s permission.” You can compare with these the 
power,  eloquence,  and  elevated  manner  of  expression  of  other  verses  and  their 
meanings. 

Third Point:  This is the wonderful uniqueness of its style. Indeed, the Qur’an’s 
style  is  both  strange,  and  original,  and  wonderful,  and  convincing.  It  has  imitated 
nothing  and  no  one.  And  no  one  has  been  able  to  imitate  it.  Its  style  has  always 
preserved the freshness, youth, and singularity it possessed when it was first revealed 
and  continues  to  preserve  it.  For  instance,  the  unique  style  of  the  cipher-like 
muqatta’at, the ‘disjointed letters,’ like, Alif. Lam. Mim., Alif. Lam. Ra., Ta. Ha., Ya. 
Sin.,  Ha.  Mim.  ‘Ayn.  Sin.  Qaf.,  at  the  beginning  of  some  of  the  Suras.  We  have 
described  five  or  six  of  the  flashes  of  miraculousness  they  comprise  in  Isharat  al-
I’jaz. 

For  example,  these  letters  at  the  start  of  certain  Suras  have  taken  half  of  each 
category of the many well-known categories of letters, like the emphatic letters (Kaf, 
Qaf, Ta, Alif, Jim, Dal, Ta, Ba), the sibilants, the stressed letters, the soft letters, the 
labiolinguals, and tremolo (qalqala) letters (Qaf, Ta, Dal, Jim, Ba). Taking more than 
half from the  light  letters and less than  half  from the  heavy  letters, neither of which 
are  divisible,  it  has  halved  every  category.  Although  the  human  mind  would  be 
capable  of  it,  halving  all  those  categories overlapping  one  within  the  other,  hesitant 
among two hundred possibilities, in the only way possible, which was  hidden to the 
human mind and unknown to it, and organizing all the letters on that way, over that 
broad  distance,  was  not  the  work  of  the  human  mind.  And  chance  could  not  have 
interfered in it. Thus, in addition to these letters at the beginning of the Suras – Divine 
ciphers – displaying  five or six similar flashes of miraculousness, scholars  versed in 
the  mysteries  of  the  science  of  letters  and  the  authorities  from  among  the  saints 
deduced many secrets from these ‘disjointed letters.’ They discovered such truths that 
they declared that on their own these letters form a brilliant miracle. Since we are not 
party to their secrets and also we cannot provide proofs clear to everyone, we cannot 
open that door. We shall therefore suffice with referring  

 

385

readers to the explanation  in Isharat al-I’jaz of five or six  flashes of miraculousness 
related to them. 

Now  we  shall  point  out  the  Qur’anic  styles  with  regard  to  Sura,  aim,  verse, 

phrase, and word. 

For example, if the Sura About what are they disputing?14 is studied carefully, it 
shows the events of the hereafter, the resurrection of the dead, and Paradise and Hell 
in a style so unique and wonderful that it proves the Divine acts and dominical works 
in  this  world  as  though  looking  at  each  of  those  events  of  the  next  world,  and 
convinces the heart. To expound the style of this Sura fully would be lengthy, so we 
shall merely indicate one or two points, as follows: 

At  the  start  of  the  Sura,  to  prove  the  resurrection,  it  says:  “We  have  made  the 
earth a beautifully decked-out cradle for you, and the mountains masts and poles full 
of treasure for your house and your lives. We have made you as couples, loving and 
close to one another. We have made the night a coverlet for your sleep of comfort, the 
daytime  the  arena  in  which  you  earn  your  livelihood,  the  sun  a  light-giving,  heat-
supplying  lamp,  and  from  the  clouds  We  pour  down  water  as  though  they  were  a 
spring producing the water of life. And We create easily and quickly from the simple 
water  the  various  flower-bearing  and  fruit-bearing  things  which  bear  all  your 
sustenance. Since this is so, the Day of Resurrection, the day when good and evil shall 
be separated out, awaits  you. It is  not difficult for Us to bring about that Day.” In  a 
veiled way it points to proofs that after this at the resurrection, the mountains will be 
scattered, the skies shattered, Hell readied, and the people of Paradise given gardens 
and orchards. It says  in effect: “Since  He does these things related to the mountains 
and  the  earth  before  your  very  eyes,  He  shall  do  things  resembling  these  in  the 
hereafter.” That is to say, the ‘mountain’ at the beginning of the Sura looks to the state 
of the mountains at the resurrection, and the garden to the gardens and paradises in the 
hereafter. You may compare other points to this and see what a beautiful and elevated 
style it has. 

And, for example: 

Say:  O  God,  Holder  of  All  Power!  You  grant  dominion  to  whomever  You 
wish  and  You  remove  dominion  from  whomever  You  wish.  You  exalt 
whomever You wish and You bring low whomever You wish. In Your hand is 
all good. Indeed, You are Powerful over all things. * You enter the night into 
the day and enter the day into the night, and You bring forth the living from 
the dead and bring forth the dead from the living, and You grant sustenance 
to whomever You wish without measure.15 

                                                 
14 The Great News, Sura 78. 
15 Qur’an, 3:26-7. 

 

386

These  verses  describe  the  Divine  acts  in  human  kind,  and  the  Divine 
manifestations in the alternations of night and day, and the dominical acts of disposal 
in the seasons of the year, and the dominical deeds in life and death on the face of the 
earth and in the resurrections in this world in a style so elevated that it captivates the 
minds of the attentive. Since its brilliant, elevated, and wide-reaching style is clearly 
understood with little study, we shall not open that treasury for now. 

And for example, 

When the sky is rent asunder * Heeding [the command of] its Sustainer, as in 
truth it must. * And when the earth is levelled * And casts out what is within 
it and becomes  empty * And  it heeds  [the  command of]  its Sustainer, as  in 
truth it must.16 

This explains in a truly elevated style the degree of submission and obedience to 
Almighty  God’s  command  of  the  skies  and  the  earth.  It  is  like  this:  just  as  a 
commander-in-chief  opens  two  offices  to  accommodate  the  matters  necessary  for 
fighting, like one for strategy and one for the enrollment of soldiers, and when those 
matters  are  accomplished  and  the  fighting  is  over,  he  addresses  himself  to  the  two 
offices in order to convert them into something else for some other business, they both 
say,  either  through  the  tongues  of  those  employed  in  them  or  through  their  own 
tongues: “O Chief! Give us a short respite so that we can clean up the bits and pieces 
of  the  former  business  and  throw  them  out,  then  you  may  honour  us  with  your 
presence. There, we have thrown them out, we await your command. Order what you 
wish. We hear and obey! Everything you do is true, good, and beneficial.”  

In  the  same  way,  the  heavens  and  the  earth  were  opened  as  two  arenas  of 
obligation,  trial,  and  examination.  After  the  allotted period  is  finished, they  will  put 
aside  the  things  pertaining  to  the  arena  of  trial  and  say:  “O  our  Sustainer!  The 
command is Yours, employ us now in whatever You wish. Our right is only to obey 
You.  Everything  You  do  is  right.”  Consider  carefully  the  majestic  style  of  those 
sentences!  

And for example,  

Then  the  word  went  forth:  “O  earth,  swallow  up  your  water!  And  o  sky 
withhold [your rain]!” And the water abated and the matter was ended. The 
ark  rested  on  Mount  Judi,  and  the  word  went  forth:  “Away  with  all  those 
who do wrong!”17 

In order to point to a mere drop from the sea of eloquence of this verse, we shall 
show one aspect of its style in the mirror of a comparison. On the victory being won 
in a great war, the commander says “Cease fire!” to one  

                                                 

16 Qur’an, 84:1-5. 
17 Qur’an, 11:44. 

 

387

firing army and “Halt!” to another, assaulting, army. He issues the command, and at 
that  moment  the  firing  ceases  and  the  assault  is  halted.  He  says:  “It  is  finished,  we 
have  beaten  them.  Our  flag  is planted at  the top of  the  high  citadel  at  the  enemies’ 
centre. Those  mannerless  tyrants  have  met  with  their  reward  and been cast  down  to 
the lowest of the low.” 

In just the same way, the Peerless Sovereign issued the command to the heavens 
and the earth to annihilate the people of Noah. When they had carried out their duty, 
He  decreed:  “Drink  up  your  water,  O  earth!  Cease  from  your  work,  O  skies!  It  is 
finished. Now the waters are receding. The Ark, which is a Divine official performing 
its duty as a tent, is settled on the top of the mountain. The wrongdoers have received 
retribution.” See the elevated nature of this style. It is saying: “The heavens and earth 
obey the command like two highly disciplined soldier.” It is thus alluding to the fact 
that  the  universe  becomes  angry  at  man’s  rebellion.  The  heavens  and  the  earth 
become  incensed.  And  with  this  allusion  it  is  saying:  “One  Whose  commands  the 
skies  and  the  earth  obey  like  two  disciplined  soldiers  may  not  be  rebelled  against,” 
restraining  man  in  awesome  fashion.  Thus,  it  describes  a  universal  event  like  the 
Flood with all its consequences and truths in a few sentences in a concise, miraculous, 
beautiful,  and  succinct  manner.  You  can  compare  this  droplet  from  the  ocean  with 
other drops. Now consider the style displayed by the window of the words. 

For example, consider the words like an old date-stalk, withered and curved in,  

And  the  moon  We  have  determined  mansions  for  till  it  returns  like  an  old 
date-stalk, withered and curved;18 

see what a subtle style it displays. It is like this: one of the moon’s mansions is in the 
Pleiades. The Qur’an likens the moon when it is a crescent to a withered and whitened 
old  date-stalk.  Through  this  simile  it  depicts  for  the  eye  of  the  imagination  a  tree 
behind the green veil of the skies; one of its white, curved, luminous branches has rent 
the veil and raised its head; the Pleiades are like a bunch of grapes on the branch and 
the  other  stars  all  luminous  fruits  of  that  hidden  tree  of  creation.  If  you  have  any 
discernment,  you will understand what an appropriate, graceful, subtle, and elevated 
style and manner of expression this is in the view of the desert-dwellers, for whom the 
date-palm is the most important means of livelihood. 

And for example, as is proven at the end of the Nineteenth Word, the words runs 

its course in, 

And the sun runs its course to a place appointed19 

opens a window onto an elevated style, as follows: with the words runs its  

                                                 

18 Qur’an, 36:39. 
19 Qur’an, 36:38. 

 

388

course,  that  is,  ‘the  sun  revolves,’  it  puts  in  mind  the  Maker’s  tremendousness  by 
recalling  the  orderly  disposals  of  Divine  power  in  the  alternations  of  winter  and 
summer  and  day  and  night,  and  directs  one’s  gaze  to  the  missives  of  the  Eternally 
Besought One inscribed by the pen of power on the pages of the seasons. It proclaims 
the wisdom of the All-Glorious Creator. 

And with the word lamp in, 

And set the sun as a lamp,20 

it  opens  a  window  onto  the  style  like  this:  it  makes  one  understand  the  Maker’s 
majesty  and  Creator’s  bounty  by  recalling  that  the  world  is  a  palace  and  the  things 
within it are adornments, food, and necessities prepared for man and living creatures 
and that the sun is a subservient candle, demonstrating that the sun is an evidence of 
God’s unity, and that the idolators’ greatest, most brilliant object of worship is merely 
a subjugated lamp, an inanimate creature. That is to say, the word lamp calls to mind 
the  Creator’s  mercy  within  the  grandeur  of  His  dominicality;  it  recalls  His  favours 
within the breadth of His mercy, and in so doing informs of His munificence within 
the  majesty  of  His  sovereignty,  thereby  proclaiming  Divine  unity,  and  saying 
indirectly: “An inanimate and subservient lamp is in no way fit to be worshipped.” 

And  in  the  course  of  runs  its  course  it  calls  to  mind  the  wondrous  orderly 
disposals of Divine power in the revolutions of night and day and winter and summer, 
and  in  so  doing  makes  known  the  grandeur  of  a  single  Maker’s  power  in  His 
dominicality. That is to say, it turns man’s mind from the points of the sun and moon 
to the pages of night and day and winter and summer, and draws his attention to the 
lines of events written on those pages. For the Qur’an does not speak of the sun  for 
the sake of the sun, but for the One Who illuminates it. Also, it does not speak of the 
sun’s  nature,  for  which  man  has  no  need,  but  of  the  sun’s  duty,  which  is  that  of 
mainspring  for  the  order  of  dominical  art,  and  centre  of  the  order  of  dominical 
creativity, and a shuttle for the harmony and order of dominical art in the things the 
Pre-Eternal  Inscriber  weaves  with  the  threads  of  day  and  night.  You  can  compare 
others  of  the  Qur’an’s  words  with these. While  all  are  simple,  ordinary  words,  each 
performs the duty of a key to treasuries of subtle meanings. 

It is because the Qur’an’s style is for the greater part elevated and brilliant in the 
ways  described  above  that  on  occasion  Arab  nomads  were  captivated  by  a  single 
phrase, and without being Muslims would prostrate. One nomad prostrated on hearing 
the phrase: 

Therefore proclaim openly what you are commanded.21

21 Qur’an, 15:94.

When asked: “Have you become a Muslim?”, he replied: “No. I am prostrating at the 
eloquence of these words.” 

Fourth  Point:    This  is  the  wonderful  eloquence  in  its  wording;  that  is,  in  the 
words  employed. Yes,  just  as  the  Qur’an  is  extraordinarily  eloquent  in  regard  to its 
style  and  manner  of  exposition,  so  is  there  a  truly  fluent  eloquence  in  its  wording. 
Clear  evidence  of  the  existence  of  this  eloquence  is  the  fact  that  it  does  not bore or 
cause  weariness;  while  the  testimony  of  the  brilliant  scholars  of  the  sciences  of 
rhetoric forms a decisive proof of the wisdom of the eloquence.  

Yes,  it  does  not  weary  even  if  repeated  thousands  of  times;  indeed,  it  gives 
pleasure. It is  not burdensome for the memory of a small and simple child; children 
can memorize it easily. It is not unpleasant to the ear, pained by the slightest word, of 
someone  extremely  ill;  it  is  easy  on  it.  It  is  like  sherbet  to  the  palate  of  one  in  the 
throes of death. The recitation of the Qur’an gives sweet pleasure to the ear and mind 
of such a person just like Zemzem water to his mouth and palate. The reason for its 
not causing boredom, and the wisdom of it, is this: it  is  food and sustenance for the 
heart, strength and wealth for the mind, water and light for the spirit, and the cure and 
remedy for the soul. Everyday we eat bread, yet we do not tire of it. But if we were to 
eat the choicest fruit every day, it would cause boredom. That means it is because the 
Qur’an  is  truth  and  reality  and  truthfulness  and  guidance  and  wonderfully  eloquent 
that  it  does  not  cause  weariness  and  preserves  its  freshness  and  agreeableness  as 
though  preserving  a  perpetual  youth.  One  of  the  Qurayshi  leaders  even,  an  expert 
orator,  was  sent  by  the  idolators to  listen  to  the  Qur’an.  He  went  and  listened,  then 
returned  and  said  to  them:  “These  words  have  such  a  sweetness  and  freshness  that 
they do not resemble the words of men. I know the poets and soothsayers; these words 
do  not  resemble  theirs.  The  best  we  can  do  is  mislead  our  followers  and  say  it  is 
magic.”22 Thus, even the All-Wise Qur’an’s most obdurate enemies were amazed at 
its eloquence. 

It  would  be  very  lengthy  to  explain  the  sources  of  the  All-Wise  Qur’an’s 
eloquence  in  its  verses  and  words  and  sentences,  therefore  we  shall  keep  the 
explanation  brief  and  show  by  way  of  example  the  fluency  and  eloquence  of  the 
wording in one sentence obtained through the position of the letters and a single flash 
of miraculousness that shines forth from that positioning. Take the verse: 

Then  after  the  distress  He  sent  down  on  you  a  feeling  of  peace  and 
drowsiness, which overcame a group of you.23 [to the end of the verse] 

In  this  verse,  all  the  letters  of  the  alphabet  are  present.  But,  see,  although  all  the 
categories of emphatic letters are together, it has not spoilt the smooth 

                                                 

22 Suyuti, al-Itqan fi ‘Ulum al-Qur’an, ii, 117; Qadi Iyad, al-Shifa’, i, 264. 
23 Qur’an, 3:154. 

 

390

ness  of  style.  Indeed,  it has added  a  brilliance  and  harmonious,  congruent,  eloquent 
melody  issuing  from  varied  strings.  Also,  note  carefully  the  following  flash  of 
eloquence:  of  the  letters  of  the  alphabet, Alif  and  Ya,  since  they  are  the  lightest  and 
have  been  transposed  with  one  another  like  sisters,  they  have  each  been  repeated 
twenty-one times. And since Mim and Nun24 are sisters and have changed places, they 
have each been mentioned thirty-three times. And since Shin, Sin, and Sad are sisters 
in  regard  to  articulation,  quality,  and  sound,  each  has  been  mentioned  three  times. 
And  although  ‘Ayn  and  Ghayn  are  sisters,  since  ‘Ayn  is  lighter,  it  is  mentioned  six 
times, while because Ghayn is harsher, it is mentioned half as many, three times. And 
since  Zay,  Dhal, Za,  and  Ta are  sisters  in  regard  to  articulation,  quality,  and  sound, 
each is mentioned twice, while Lam and Alif in the form of LA have united and Alif’s 
share in the the form of LA is half that of Lam, Lam is mentioned forty-two times and 
as  a  half  of  it  Alif  twenty-one  times.  Since  Hamza  and  Ha  are  sisters  in  regard  to 
articulation,  Hamza25  is  mentioned  thirteen  times  and  being  a  degree  lighter  Ha\  is 
mentioned  fourteen  times.  And  Kaf,  Fa  and  Qaf  are  sisters;  since  Qaf  has  an 
additional  point,  it  is  mentioned  ten  times,  Fa,  nine  times,  Kaf  nine  times,  Ba  nine 
times, and Ta twelve times. Since Ta comes third, it is mentioned twelve times. Ra is 
Lam’s  sister,  but  according  to  their  numerical  value,  Ra  is  two  hundred,  and  Lam 
thirty, so since it has risen six times more, it has fallen six. Also, since Ra is repeated 
on pronunciation, it becomes emphatic and is only mentioned six times. And because 
Dad, Tha, Ha, and Kha are emphatic and gain additional qualities in connection with 
other letters, they have each been mentioned only once. Since Waw is lighter than Ha 
and Hamza, and heavier than Ya and Alif, it is mentioned seventeen times, four times 
more than heavy Hamza and four times less than light Alif. 

Thus, the  extraordinary  positioning  of  the  letters  in  the  passage  mentioned  here 
and their hidden relationships, and the beautiful order and fine, subtle regularity and 
harmony  show  as  clearly  as  twice  two  equals  four  that  it  would  not  be  within  the 
limits  of  human  thought  to  have  composed  it.  As  for  chance  and  coincidence,  it  is 
impossible  that  it  should  have  interfered.  And  so,  just  as  the  strange  and  wonderful 
order and regularity in the position of these letters leads to a fluency and eloquence in 
the  words,  so  may  there  be  many  other  hidden  instances  of  wisdom.  Since  such  an 
order  has  been  followed  in  the  letters,  surely  in  the  words,  sentences  and  meanings 
such a mysterious order, such a luminous harmony, has been observed that should the 
eye  see  it,  it  would  declare:  Ma’shallah!,  and  should  the  reason  comprehend  it,  it 
would exclaim: Barakallah! 

                                                 

24 Tanwin is also a Nun. 
25 Pronounced and unpronounced, Hamza is twenty-five, and three more than Hamza’s silent sister 

Alif, because its points are three. 

 

391

Fifth Point: This is the excellence in its manner of exposition; that is to say, the 
superiority,  conciseness,  and  grandeur.  Just  as  there is  eloquence  in  the  word-order, 
the  wording,  and  the  meaning,  and  a  uniqueness  in  its  style,  so  in  its  manner  of 
exposition is there a superiority and excellence. Indeed, all the categories and levels of 
speech  and  address,  like  encouragement  and  deterring,  praise  and  censure, 
demonstration and guidance, explanation and silencing in argument, are at the highest 
degree in the Qur’an’s exposition. 

Of  the  innumerable  examples  of  its  manner  of  exposition26  in  the  category  of 
encouragement and urging is that in Sura Has there not been over man a long period 
of time when he was nothing – [not even] mentioned?;27 this is as sweet as the water 
of  Kawthar  and  flows with  the  fluency  of  the  spring  of  Salsabil,  it  is  as  fine  as  the 
raiment of the houris. 

Of the numerous examples of the category of deterring and threatening is the start 
of Sura Has the story reached you of the Overwhelming Event?28  Here the Qur’an’s 
exposition has an effect like lead boiling in the ears of the people of misguidance, and 
fire  burning  in  their  brains,  and  zaqqum  scalding  their  palates,  and  Hell  assaulting 
their faces, and like a bitter thorny tree in their stomachs. An official like Hell charged 
by someone with inflicting torment and torture in order to demonstrate his threats, and 
its  splitting  apart  with  seething  rage,  and  its  saying:  well-nigh  bursting  with  fury29 
certainly show how awesomely dreadful that person’s threats are. 

Of the thousands of examples in the category of  praise, the Qur’an’s manner of 
exposition in the five Suras starting al-Hamdulillah is brilliant like the sun,30 adorned 
like  the  stars,  majestic  like  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  lovable  like  the  angels, 
compassionate  like  tenderness  towards  young  in  this  world,  and  beautiful  like 
Paradise in the hereafter. 

Of  the  thousands  of  examples  in  the  category  of  censure  and  restraint,  in  the 
verse, Would any among you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother,31 it censures six 
times. It restrains from backbiting forcibly six times over. It is like this: as is known, 
the  Hamza  at  the  beginning  of  the  verse  is  interrogative.  This  seeps  through  all  the 
words of the verse like water. Thus, with the first Hamza it asks: Have you no reason, 
the seat of question and answer, that you do not understand how ugly it is?   

With  the  second,  it  asks  with  the  word  like:  Is  your  heart,  the  seat  of  love  and 

hate, so corrupted that it loves the most despicable thing?  

                                                 

26 The style here has slipped into the clothes of this Sura’s meaning. 
27 Qur’an, 76:1. 
28 Qur’an, 88:1. 
29 Qur’an, 67:8. 
30 In these phrases is an allusion to the matters discussed in these Suras. 
31 Qur’an, 49:12. 

 

392

With  the  third,  it  asks  with  the  words  one  of  you:  What  has  happened  to  your 
social life and civilization, which receives its vitality from the community, that it finds 
acceptable an act which thus poisons your life? 

With  the  fourth,  it  asks  with  the  words  to  eat  the  flesh:  What  has  happened  to 

your humanity that you tear apart your friend like a savage beast?  

With the fifth, it asks with the words your brother: Have you no compassion and 
fellow-feeling that you unjustly tear with your teeth at the character of the one injured, 
your brother in so many respects? Have you no reason that you bite at your own limbs 
like a madman? 

And with the sixth it asks with the word dead: Where is your conscience? Is your 
nature so corrupted that you do the most repulsive thing to the most respected person, 
your brother, like eating his flesh? That is to say, backbiting is censured and despised 
by  the  reason,  the  heart,  humanity,  the  conscience,  human  nature,  and  social  and 
national  solidarity.  So  see!  How  this  verse  restrains  from  this  crime  in  six  concise 
degrees, on six miraculous levels! 

Of the thousands of examples of the category of proof and demonstration, is the 

verse: 

So consider the signs of God’s mercy; how He gives life to the earth after its 
death. Indeed, it is He Who gives life to the dead, for He is powerful over all 
things.32 

Its exposition is such in proving resurrection and banishing doubts that it could not be 
more clearly demonstrated. It is like this: it says that, as is proved and explained in the 
Ninth  Truth  of  the  Tenth  Word  and  in  the  Fifth  Flash  of  the  Twenty-Second  Word, 
every spring examples of resurrection are provided in three hundred thousand ways in 
the  earth  being  raised  to  life  with  the  utmost  order  and  differentiation  despite  the 
innumerable  species  being  all  mixed  up 
thus 
demonstrating  to  the  human  observer  that  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  would  not be 
difficult for the One who does this. Also, since to write without fault or error with the 
pen of power hundreds of thousands of species on the page of the earth, all together 
and one within the other, is the seal of the Single One of Unity; with this verse it both 
proves Divine unity as the clearly as the sun, and it demonstrates the resurrection of 
the dead as easily and decisively as the rising and setting of the sun. Thus, the Qur’an 
demonstrates this truth in regard to manner, as described by the word how, just as it 
mentions it in detail in many Suras. 

total  confusion,

in 

And for example, in Sura, Qaf. By the Glorious Qur’an,33 it proves  

                                                 

32 Qur’an, 30:50. 
33 Qur’an, 50:1. 

 

393

resurrection  in  such  a  brilliant,  fine,  sweet,  and  exalted  manner  that  it  convinces  as 
certainly  as  the  coming  of  spring.  Look:  in  answer  to  the  unbelievers  denying  the 
raising  to  life  of  decomposed bones  and  saying:  “This  is  extraordinary;  it  could not 
be!”, it decrees: 

Do  they  not  look  to  the  skies  above  them;  how  we  have  made  them  and 
adorned them and how there is no flaw in them.... until: ... and thus will be 
the Resurrection.34 

Its  manner  of  exposition  flows  like  water  and  shines  like  the  stars.  It  gives  both 
pleasure and delight to the heart like dates. And it is sustenance. 

And in one of the most subtle examples of the category of demonstration, it says: 
Ya. Sin.* By the All-Wise Qur’an * Indeed you are one of the Messengers.35  

That is, “I swear by the Wise Qur’an that you are one of the Divine Messengers.” This 
oath indicates that the proof of Messengership is so certain and true, and its veracity is 
so worthy of  honour and respect, that it  is sworn  by. By  indicating this, it is saying: 
“You are the Messenger, for you hold the Qur’an in your hand, and the Qur’an is the 
truth  and  it  is  the  word of  Truth.  For  it  contains  true  wisdom,  and bears  the  seal  of 
miraculousness.” 

And  one  of  the  concise  and  miraculous  examples  of  the  category  of  proof  and 

demonstration is this: 

He says: Who will raise to life these bones when they are rotted? * Say: He 
will  raise  them  Who  created  them  in  the  first  instance,  for  He  has  full 
knowledge of every kind of creation.36 

That  is,  man  asks:  “Who  will  resurrect  decayed  bones?”  You  say:  “Whoever  made 
them in the first place and gave them life, He will resurrect them.” As was depicted in 
the third comparison of the Ninth Truth in the Tenth Word, if someone reassembles a 
large army in one day before your eyes, and someone else says: “At a bugle-call that 
person brought together the members of a battalion who  had dispersed to rest; he  is 
able to bring the battalion under order,” and you say, O man: “I do not believe it,” you 
can see what a foolish denial it would be. 

In just the same way, the All-Powerful and All-Knowing One enrolls and unites 
anew with the command of “Be!” and it is, and with perfect order and the balance of 
wisdom,  the  particles  and  subtle  faculties  of  the  battalion-like  bodies  of  all  the 
animals  –  which  are  like  an  army  –  and  other  living  creatures,  and  creates  every 
century, and every spring even, all the hundreds of  

                                                 

34 Qur’an, 50:6-11. 
35 Qur’an, 36:1-3. 
36 Qur’an, 36:78-79. 

 

394

thousands of army-like species of living creatures on the face of the earth. Can it be 
questioned  then  how  He  can  gather  together  at  one  blast  of  Israfil’s  trumpet  the 
fundamental  parts  and  particles  of  a  battalion-like  body,  which  are  already  familiar 
with one another, through taking them under order? Can it be considered unlikely? If 
it is considered unlikely, it is a mindless foolishness. 

In the category of guidance, the Qur’an’s manner of exposition is so moving and 
tender, and familiar and gentle that it fills the spirit with ardour, the heart with delight, 
the mind with interest, and the eyes with tears. Of thousands of examples is this verse: 

And  yet after all this  your hearts  hardened and became  like  rocks,  or  even 
harder... to the end of the verse.37 

As is proved and explained in the discussion of the third verse in the First Station of 
the Twentieth Word, it says to the Children of Israel: “What has happened to you that 
although hard rock shed tears from twelve springs like eyes before a miracle like the 
Staff  of  Moses  (Peace  be  upon  him),  you  remain  indifferent  in  the  face  of  all  his 
miracles, with  your eyes dry and tearless and your hearts hard and without fervour?” 
Since  this  meaning  of  guidance  is  explained  there,  we  refer  you  to  that  Word,  and 
curtail this here. 

Of thousands of examples in the category of making understood and silencing in 

argument, consider only the following two: 

If  you  have  doubts  about  the  Qur’an  We  have  revealed  to  Our  servant 
Muhammad, then produce a Sura similar to it. And call upon all your helpers 
besides God to bear witness for you, if what you say is true.38 

That is, “If you have any doubts, summon all  your elders and supporters to help you 
and  testify  for  you,  then  compose  the  like  of  a  single  Sura.”  Since  this  has  been 
explained and proved in Isharat al-I’jaz, here we shall only point out a brief summary 
of it. It is as follows:  

The  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  says:  “O  men  and  jinn!  If  you  have  any 
doubts  that  the  Qur’an  is  the  Word  of  God  and  imagine  it  to  be  man’s  word,  then 
come  on,  here  it  is,  let’s  see!  You  bring  a  book  like  this  Qur’an  from  someone 
unlettered,  who  does  not  know  how  to  read  and  write  like  the  one  you  call 
Muhammad the Trustworthy, and get him to compose it! If you cannot do this, then he 
need not be untaught, let him be a famous man of letters and learned. And if you are 
not able to do this, alright, not on his own, take all the finest works of all your orators 
and men of eloquence, and indeed of all the literary geniuses of the past and all those 
of  the  future,  and  the  assistance  of  all  your  gods.  Work  with  all  your  strength, 
compose the  

                                                 

37 Qur’an, 2:74. 
38 Qur’an, 2:23. 

 

395

like of this Qur’an. And if you cannot do this, leave aside the truths of the Qur’an and 
its many miraculous aspects, which it is not possible to imitate, and compose a work 
which is its equal in only the eloquence of its word-order!” 

Through the silencing words of 

Bring then ten Suras forged, like it,39 

it says: “Come on, I do not want its true meaning from you, let it be fabrications and 
lies and false tales. You will not be able to do this. So it need not be as much as the 
whole  Qur’an,  just bring  ten  Suras  like  it.  You  will  not  be  able  to do  this  either,  so 
bring a single Sura. This will be too much as well. So alright, make it the equivalent 
of a short Sura. You will not be able to do this either, although the need for you to do 
so is so great. For your honour and self-respect, your dignity and religion, your tribal 
honour and pride, your life and property, and your lives in this world and the next will 
all  be  saved  by  producing the  like  of  it.  Otherwise  in  this  world  you  will remain  in 
abasement,  without  honour,  dignity,  religion,  or  pride,  and  your  lives  and  property 
will be destroyed and will perish, and in the hereafter, as is indicated by the verse, 

Then give heed to Hell-fire, whose fuel is men and stones,40 

you will be condemned to everlasting incarceration in  Hell; together with  your idols 
you  will  be  fuel  to  its  fires.  Since  your  need  is  thus  great,  and since  you  have  now 
understood  your  impotence  in  eight  degrees,  you  should be  certain  eight  times  over 
that the Qur’an is a miracle. So either believe in it, or be silent and go to Hell!” So see 
the way the Qur’an forces them to accept the argument in this category of ‘silencing 
in  argument’  which  is  within  that  of  ‘making  understood,’  and  say:  “There  is  no 
manner of exposition better than that of the Qur’an!” Indeed, after that of the Qur’an 
no need remains for further exposition. 

Here is a second example: 

Exhort  then  [O  Prophet],  for  by  your  Sustainer’s  grace  you  are  neither  a 
soothsayer  nor  a  madman  *  Or do  they  say:  A  poet!  –  let  us  wait  and  see 
what time will do! * Say: Wait then, I too shall wait with you. * Is it that their 
faculties  of  understanding  urge  them  to  this,  or  are  they  but  a  people 
transgressing all bounds.  *  Or  do  they  say:  He  fabricated  this  [Message]? 
Nay, they do not believe. * Let them then produce a recital like unto it – if 
they  speak  the  truth.  *  Or  were  they  created  of  nothing,  or  were  they 
themselves  the  creators?  *  Or  did  they  create  the  heavens  and  the  earth? 
Nay, they have no firm belief. *  

                                                 

39 Qur’an, 11:13. 
40 Qur’an, 2:24. 

 

396

Or are the treasuries of your Sustainer with them, or are they the managers 
[of affairs]? * Or have they a ladder by which they can [climb up to heaven 
and]  listen  [to  its  secrets]?  Then  let  [such  a]  listener  of  theirs  produce  a 
manifest  proof.  *  Or has  He  only  daughters  and you have  sons? *  Or is  it 
that you ask for a reward, so that they are burdened with a load of debt? * 
Or that the Unseen is in their hands, and they write it down? * Or do they 
intend a plot [against you]? But those who defy God are themselves involved 
in a plot! * Or have they a god other than God? Exalted is God far above the 
things they associate with them.41 

Here we shall explain only one of the thousands of truths of these verses as a further 
example  of  the  category  of  silencing  in  argument.  It  is  as  follows:  with  the  word, 
Or....Or...,  it  silences  every  group  of  the  people  of  misguidance  with  a  rhetorical 
question expressing surprise and stops up all the sources of their doubts. It leaves no 
satanic chink through which doubts might enter and hide themselves; it closes them 
all. It leaves no veil of misguidance under which they might creep and lurk; it rends 
all of them. It leaves  not one of their lies; it crushes them. In each sentence it either 
demolishes the essence of the blasphemous ideas of one group with a short phrase, or 
since the falsity is obvious, it exposes it by  silence, or since  it  is refuted in detail  in 
other verses, it here alludes to it briefly. For example, the first sentence alludes to the 
verse: 

And We have not instructed him poetry, nor is it meet for him.42 

While the fifteenth sentence points to the verse: 

Were there gods other than God in the heavens and earth, there surely would 
have been confusion in both.43 

You can make further examples from the other sentences like these. It is like this: it 
says  at  the  start:  Announce  the  Divine  decrees.  You  are  not  a  soothsayer,  for  the 
words of soothsayers are  confused and conjectural, while  yours are true and certain. 
And you are not mad; your enemies even attest to your perfect sanity. 

Or do they say: A poet – let us wait and see what time will do!44 

Do they call you a poet, like the unreasoning, common infidels? Are they waiting for 
you to perish? You say to them: “Wait! I shall wait with you!” Your vast and brilliant 
truths are free of the imaginings of poetry and independent of their fancies.

Or is it that their faculties of understanding urge them to this?45 

Or like unreasoning philosophers who rely on their reasons, do they  hold back from 
following you, saying: “Our faculties of reason are sufficient.” But reason commands 
that you are followed, because everything you say is reasonable. But again the reason 
on its own cannot reach it. 

Or are they but a people transgressing all bounds?46 

Or  is  the  reason  for  their  denial  their  not  submitting  to  Almighty  God  like  wicked 
tyrants? But the ends of the Pharaohs and Nimrods, who were the leaders of arrogant 
oppressors, are known. 

Or do they say: He fabricated this [Message]? Nay, they do not believe.47 

Or like lying dissemblers without conscience do they accuse  you saying: “You have 
made  up  the  Qur’an!”?  But  up  to  this  time  they  have  known  you  to  be  the  most 
truthful among them and have called you Muhammad the Trustworthy. It means that 
they  have  no  intention  to  believe.  Otherwise  let  them  find  the  like  of  the  Qur’an 
among the works of men. 

Or were they created of nothing?48 

Or like the absurd philosophers who believed the universe to be without purpose and 
in vain, do they suppose themselves to be aimless and without wisdom, purpose, duty, 
or Creator? Have they become blind that they do not see that the universe is adorned 
from  top  to  bottom  with  instances  of  wisdom  and  bears  the  fruit  of  aims,  and  that 
beings  from  particles  to  the  suns  are  charged  with  duties  and  are  subjugated  to  the 
Divine commands? 

Or were they themselves the creators?49 

Or do they imagine like the pharaoh-like Materialists that “They came into being by 
themselves,  feed  themselves,  and  themselves  create  everything  they  need,”  so  that 
they hold back from believing and worship? That means they all suppose themselves 
to  be  the  Creator.  Whereas  the  Creator  of  one  thing  has  to  be  the  Creator  of 
everything.  That  is  to  say,  their  pride  and  conceit  have  made  them  so  utterly  stupid 
they imagine to be a Possessor of Absolute Power one who is absolutely impotent and 
may  be  defeated  by  a  fly  or  a  microbe.  Since  they  have  abdicated  their  reason  and 
humanity  to  this  degree  and  have  fallen  lower  than  the  animals  and  even  inanimate 
beings, do not be saddened at their denial. Consider them to be a variety of harmful 
animal and filthy matter! Ignore them and give them no importance!

Or  did  they  create  the  heavens  and  the  earth?  Nay,  they  have  no  firm 
belief!50 

Or,  like  the  mindless,  confused  Mu’attila,  who  denied  God  all  attributes  and  denied 
the Creator, do they deny God so that they do not heed the Qur’an? In which case, let 
them  deny  the  existence  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  or  let  them  say:  “We created 
them!” Let them lose their minds altogether and begin uttering the frenzied ravings of 
lunacy. For in the heavens as many proofs of Divine unity are apparent and are recited 
as  the  stars,  and  on  the  earth  as  many  as  the  flowers.  That  means  they  have  no 
intention of acquiring certain knowledge and finding the truth. Otherwise how do they 
suppose  to  be  without  inscriber  the  book  of  the  universe,  in  one  word  of  which  is 
written  a  whole  book,  although  they  know  that  a  letter  cannot  exist  without the  one 
who wrote it. 

Or are the treasuries of your Sustainer with them?51 

Or, like one group of misguided philosophers who denied Almighty God the power of 
choice, or like the Brahmans, do they deny the source of prophethood so that they do 
not believe in you? In which case, let them deny all the traces of wisdom and purpose, 
all  the  order  and  fruits  which  are  apparent  in  all  beings  and  demonstrate  will  and 
choice, let them deny all the works of mercy and grace, and all the miracles of all the 
prophets!  Or  let  them  say:  “All  the  treasuries  of  the  bounties  given  to  creatures  are 
with us and under our control.” Let them prove they are  not fit to be addressed! Do 
not be grieved at their denial, say: “God’s unreasoning animals are many!” 

Or are they the managers [of affairs]?52 

Or,  like  the  arrogant  Mu’tazilites,  who  made  the  reason  dominant,  do  they  imagine 
themselves to be rivals to and inspectors of the Creator’s works, and want to hold the 
All-Glorious Creator responsible? Beware, do not lose heart! Nothing can come of the 
denials of self-centred people like that! You do not be deceived either! 

Or have they a ladder by which they can [climb up to heaven and] listen [to 
its secrets]? Then let [such a] listener of theirs produce a manifest proof! 53 

Or, like the spiritualists and phony soothsayers, do they follow Satan and the jinn and 
suppose  they  have  found  another  way  to  the  World  of  the  Unseen?  In  which  case, 
have they a ladder by which to ascend to the heavens which

are closed to the satans? Do they imagine that they can give the lie to your news from 
the heavens? The denials of such charlatans are worth nothing! 

Or has He only daughters and you have sons? 54 

Or, like the polytheist philosophers who ascribed partners to God under the name of 
‘the ten intellects’ and ‘the masters of the species,’ and the Sabeans, who attributed a 
sort  of  godhead  to  the  stars  and  the  angels,  do  they  ascribe  offspring  to  Almighty 
God? Like the heretics and misguided, do they ascribe a son to Him, which is contrary 
to the necessary existence, unity, eternity, and absolute self-sufficiency of the Single 
and  Eternally  Besought  One?  Do they  ascribe  femininity  to  that  offspring,  which  is 
opposed  to  the  angels’  worship,  purity,  and  kind?  Do  they  suppose  it  to  be  an 
intercessor  for  them,  so  that  they  do  not  follow  you?  Generation  is  the  means  of 
multiplying,  mutual  assistance,  perpetuation,  and  life  for creatures  like  man,  who  is 
contingent,  transitory,  and  in  need  of  perpetuating  the  species,  is  corporeal  and 
divisible,  capable  of  multiplying,  impotent  and  needy  for  an  heir  to  help  him.  So  to 
ascribe  offspring  –  and  a  sort of offspring  that  those  impotent,  contingent,  wretched 
men  did  not  themselves  like  and  could  not  equate  with  their  arrogant  pride,  that  is, 
female  offspring  –  to  the  All-Glorious  One,  Whose  existence  is  necessary  and 
perpetual,  Who  endures  from  pre-eternity  to  post-eternity,  Whose  essence  is  utterly 
remote from and exalted above corporality, Whose being is free of and exempt from 
division and multiplication, and Whose Power is far above and beyond all impotence, 
is  indeed  such  a  delirium,  such  a  lunatic  raving  that  the  lies  and  denials  of  those 
wretches who subscribe to such an idea are worth nothing. You must not be deceived. 
The scatter-brained nonsense, the delirious ravings of every crazy lunatic, should not 
be heeded! 

Or is it that you ask for a reward, so that they are burdened with a load of 
debt? 55 

Or, like the rebellious, overweening worshippers of this world, who have made a habit 
of greed and miserliness, do they find what you propose burdensome, so that they flee 
from  you?  Do  they  not  know  that  you  seek  your  wage  and  recompense  from  God 
alone?  Is  it  a  burden  to give  to  their  own  poor one  fortieth  of  the  property  given  to 
them by God Almighty, or a part of it, and as a consequence both receive plenty, and 
be saved from the envy and curses of the poor? Do they consider the command to give 
zakat  burdensome  and  therefore  hold  back  from  Islam?  Their  denials  have  no 
importance, and what they deserve is a slap, not an answer...

Or is it that the Unseen is in their hands, and they write it down?56 

Or,  like  Buddhists,  who  claim  to  be  familiar  with  the  Unseen,  or  the  pseudo-
intellectuals, who imagine their conjectures about its affairs to be certain, does what 
you  said  about  the  Unseen  not  appeal  to  them?  That  means  they  imagine  that  the 
World of the Unseen, which is disclosed to no one apart from the Divine Messengers, 
who receive revelation, and which no one has the ability to enter, is present and laid 
open before them, and that they obtain information from it and write it down. So do 
not be disheartened by the lies of these arrogant braggarts who have overstepped their 
mark to an infinite degree! For in a short while  your truths will completely overturn 
their imaginings! 

Or  do  they  intend  a  plot  [against  you]?  But  those  who  defy  God  are 
themselves involved in a plot! 57 

Or, like two-faced dissemblers and cunning atheists whose natures are corrupted and 
consciences rotted, do they want to deceive the people and turn them away from the 
guidance which they cannot obtain, to trick them, and so call you either a soothsayer, 
or  possessed,  or  a  sorcerer?  Do  they  want  to  make  others  believe  what  they  do  not 
believe themselves? Don’t think of these insidious charlatans as human beings, don’t 
be saddened at their wiles and denials, and  lose heart. Rather,  increase  your efforts! 
For  they  only  deceive their  own  souls  and  harm  themselves.  And  their  successes  in 
evil are temporary; it is a Divine stratagem, drawing them to perdition by degrees. 

Or have they a god other than God? Exalted is God far above the things they 
associate with Him!58 

Or, like the Magians, who imagined two separate gods called the Creator of Good and 
the  Creator of  Evil,  or  like  the  idolators  and  worshippers  of  causes,  who  attribute  a 
sort of godhead to different causes and imagine each of them to be a source of support 
for  them,  do  they  rely  on  other  gods  and  contest  you?  Do  they  consider  themselves 
free  of  any  need  of  you?  That  means  they  have  become  blind  and  do  not  see  the 
perfect order and flawless harmony throughout the universe, which is as clear as day. 
For in accordance with the decree, 

Were  there  gods other  than  God  in the heavens and  the  earth,  there  surely 
would have been confusion in both,59 

if there are two headmen in a village, or two governors in a town, or two kings  in a 
country, order is turned upside down and harmony spoilt. But from a fly’s wing to the 
lamps in the heavens, such a fine order has been observed that it leaves not so much 
space as a fly’s wing for partners to be

associated with God. Since the above act in a manner so opposed to reason, wisdom, 
feeling, and what is obvious, don’t let their lies put you off proclaiming the Message! 
Thus,  of  the  hundreds  of  jewels  of  these  verses,  which  constitute  a  series  of 
truths,  we  have  briefly  explained  only  a  single  jewel  of  the  Qur’an’s  manner  of 
exposition in the category of ‘giving to understand’ and ‘silencing in argument.’ If I 
had  had  the  power and  shown  a  few  more  jewels,  you  too  would  have  said:  “These 
verses  are  a  miracle  just  on  their  own.”  But  the  Qur’an’s  manner  of  exposition  in 
making  understood  and  instruction  is  so  wonderful,  subtle,  and  fluent  that  the  most 
simple  ordinary  person  easily  comprehends  a  most  profound  truth  from  the  way  it 
explains it. Yes, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition simply and clearly teaches most 
abstruse truths in a way that caresses the view of people in general, and neither hurts 
their  feelings,  nor irritates their minds,  nor tires them. Just as when  speaking with a 
child, childish words are used, in the same way the Qur’anic styles come down to the 
level  of  those  it  addresses  –called  in  the  terminology  of  the  scholars  of  theology, 
‘Divine  condescension  to  the  mind of  man’–  it addresses  them  in  that  way;  through 
comparisons  in  the  form  of  allegories,  it  makes  an  illiterate  common  person 
understand  abstruse  Divine  truths  and  dominical  mysteries  which  the  minds  of  the 
most learned philosophers cannot rise to. 

For example, by means of a comparison, the verse, 

The Most Merciful One on the Throne established 60 

depicts Divine dominicality as a kingdom, and the degree of that dominicality as that 
of a King seated on the throne of his sovereignty and exercising His rule. Indeed, as 
the speech of the All-Glorious Creator of the universe, the Qur’an proceeds from the 
ultimate  degree  of  His  dominicality,  passes  over  all  the  other  degrees  guiding  those 
who  rise  to  them,  and  passing  through  seventy  thousand  veils,  it  looks  to  each  and 
illuminates it. It scatters its radiance and spreads its light to the thousands of levels of 
those  it  addresses,  the  understanding  and  intelligence  of  whom  are  all  different. 
Although  it  has  lived  through  ages  and  centuries  whose  capacities  are  all  different, 
and has broadcast its meaning to this great extent, it has not lost an iota of its perfect 
youth  and  juvenility,  and  retaining  its  total  freshness  and  delicacy,  it  teaches  every 
ordinary person in a most easy, skilful, and comprehensible manner. Whatever aspect 
of  a  wonder-displaying  book  which  thus  teaches,  convinces,  and  satisfies  with  the 
same  lesson,  the  same  words,  numerous  levels  of  people  whose  understanding  and 
degrees  are  all  different  –  whatever  aspect  of  such  a  book  is  studied,  a  flash  of 
miraculousness will surely appear. 

                                                 

60 Qur’an, 20:5. 

 

402

In Short: Just as when some words of the Qur’an like “All praise and thanks be 
to God” are recited, they fill a cave, which is the ear of a mountain, in the same way 
that  they  fill  the  tiny  ears  of  a  fly,  so  too  the  Qur’an’s  meanings  satisfy  ears  like 
mountains  in  the  same  way  that  with  the  same  words  they  teach  and  satisfy  tiny 
simple minds, like a fly. For the Qur’an calls to belief all the levels of men and jinn. It 
teaches  the  sciences  of  belief  to  all.  In  which  case,  the  most  lowly  of  the  common 
people  kneels  shoulder  to  shoulder with  the  most  elevated  of  the  elite,  and  together 
they listen to the Qur’an’s teachings and benefit from them. That is to say, the Holy 
Qur’an  is  a  heavenly  repast  at  which  the  thousands  of  different  levels  of  minds, 
intellects,  hearts,  and  spirits  find  their  nourishment.  Their  desires  are  fulfilled  and 
their appetites are satisfied. In fact, numerous of its doors remain closed and are left to 
those  who  will  come  in  the  future.  If  you  want  an  example  of  this  category,  from 
beginning to end the Qur’an forms examples of it. All the Qur’an’s students and those 
who  listen  to  its  teachings,  like  the  interpreters  of  the  law,  the  veracious  ones,  the 
Islamic  philosophers,  the  sages,  the  scholars  of  jurisprudence  and  scholars  of 
theology, the saintly guides of those seeking knowledge of God, the spiritual poles of 
the  lovers  of  God,  the  learned  and  exacting  scholars,  and  the  mass  of  Muslims, 
unanimously  declare:  “We  understand  thoroughly  what  the  Qur’an  teaches  us.”  In 
short,  flashes  of  the  Qur’an’s  miraculousness  sparkle  in  the  category  of  ‘making 
understood and instruction’ just as they do in the other categories. 

SECOND RAY 

‘Flashes’. 

This  Ray  is  the  Qur’an’s  extraordinary  comprehensiveness.  It  consists  of  five 

The First Flash is the comprehensiveness in the words. This comprehensiveness 
is clearly apparent from the verses mentioned both in all the previous Words, and in 
this Word. As is indicated by the Hadith “Each verse has an outer meaning, an inner 
meaning,  a  limit,  and  an  aim,  and  each  has  roots,  and  boughs,  and  branches,”61  the 
words  of  the  Qur’an  have been  positioned  in  such  a  way  that  all  its  phrases,  words 
even, and even letters, and sometimes even an omission, has many aspects. It gives to 
all those it addresses their share from a different door. 

Take, for example, the verse, 

And the mountains [its] pegs,62 

a  phrase  which  says,  “I  made  the  mountains  as  stakes  and  masts  for  that  earth  of 
yours.”  An  ordinary  person’s  share  from  this  phrase  would  be  this:  he  sees  the 
mountains which appear like stakes driven into the ground, thinks of the benefits and 
bounties in them, and offers thanks to his Creator.  

                                                 

61 Ibn Hibban, Sahih, i, 146; al-Manawi, Fayd al-Qadir, iii, 54. 
62 Qur’an, 78:7. 

 

403

A  poet’s  share  from  this  phrase:  he  imagines  the  earth  as  the  ground,  on  which  is 
pitched in a sweeping arc the dome of the heavens  like a mighty  green tent adorned 
with electric lamps, and he sees the mountains skirting the base of the heavens to be 
the pegs of the tent. He worships the All-Glorious Maker in wondering amazement. 

A  tent-dwelling  literary  man’s  share  of  this  phrase:  he  imagines  the  face  of  the 
earth  to  be  a  barren  desert,  and  the  mountain  chains  as  the  multifarious  tents  of 
nomads, as if the soil layer had been cast over high posts and the pointed tips of the 
posts had raised up the cloth of the soil, which he sees as the habitation of numerous 
different  creatures  looking  one  to  the  other.  He  prostrates  in  wonder  before  the 
Glorious Creator, Who placed and pitched so easily these august and mighty beings 
like tents on the face of the earth. 

The share of a geographer with a literary bent from this phrase: he thinks of the 
globe of the earth as a ship sailing the oceans of  either the air or the ¾ther, and the 
mountains  as  masts  and  posts  driven  into  the  ship  to  balance  and  stabilize  it.  He 
declares: “Glory be unto You! How sublime is Your glory!” before the All-Powerful 
One of Perfection, Who makes the mighty  globe as an orderly  ship, places us on  it, 
and makes it voyage through the far reaches of the world. 

A  sociologist  and  philosopher  of  human  society’s  share  of  this  phrase;  his 
thoughts would go like this: the earth is a house, and the supporting post of the life of 
that  house is animal  life, while the supporting post of animal  life are water, air, and 
earth, the conditions of  life. And the  supporting post of water, air, and earth are the 
mountains. For the mountains are the reservoirs for water, the combs for the air: they 
precipitate  the  noxious  gases  and  purify  it;  they  are  the  earth’s  preserver:  they 
preserve it from being transformed into a swamp, and from the encroachment of the 
sea. They are also the treasuries for other necessities of human life. In utter reverence 
he  offers  praise  and  thanks  to  the  Maker  of  Glory  and  Kindness,  Who  made  these 
great  mountains  as  posts  for  the  earth  –  the  house  of  our  life  –  in  this  way,  and 
appointed them as the keepers of the treasuries of our livelihood. 

The share of a scholar of natural science from this phrase would be this: he would 
think  of  the  earthquakes  and  tremors  which  occur  as  the  result  of  upheavals  and 
fusions in the heart of the earth being calmed with the upthrust of mountains; that the 
emergence of mountains is the cause of the earth’s stable rotation on its axis and in its 
orbit  and  its  not  deviating  in  its  annual  rotation  as  a  result  of  the  convulsions  of 
earthquakes; and that the anger and wrath of the earth is quieted through it breathing 
through the vents in the mountains. He would come to believe completely, and would 
exclaim: “All wisdom is God’s!” 

 

404

Another example: 

The  heavens  and  the  earth  were  joined  together  before  We  clove  them 
asunder.63 

A  scholar  untainted  by  the  study  of  philosophy  would  explain  the  words  joined 
together  like  this:  while  the skies were  shining  and  cloudless,  and  the  earth  dry  and 
without life and incapable of giving birth, the skies were opened up with rain and the 
earth  with  vegetation,  and  all  living  beings  were  created through  a  sort  of  marriage 
and impregnation. To do this was the work of One so Powerful and Glorious that the 
face of the earth is merely a small garden of His, while the clouds veiling the face of 
the skies, sponges for watering it. The scholar understands this and prostrates before 
the tremendousness of His power. 

A searching philosopher would explain the same words in this way: while at the 
start of creation the heavens and earth were a formless mass, each consisting of matter 
like  wet  dough  without  benefit,  offspring,  or  creatures,  the  All-Wise  Creator  both 
rolled them out and expanded them into a beautiful, beneficial form, and made them 
the  source  of  adorned  and  numerous  creatures.  The  philosopher  would  stand  in 
wonder before the breadth of His wisdom. 

A modern philosopher would explain the words thus: at  first, our globe and the 
other  planets  which  form  the  solar  system  were  fused  together  in  the  form  of  an 
undifferentiated dough. Then the All-Powerful and Self-Subsistent One rolled out the 
dough, and placed each of the planets in its position; leaving the sun where it was and 
bringing the  earth  here,  He  spread  earth  over  the  globe of  the  earth  and  sprinkled  it 
with rain from the skies, scattered light over it from the sun, and inhabited it placing 
us on it. The philosopher would pull his head out of the swamp of nature, and declare: 
“I believe in God, the One, the Unique!” 

And another example: 

And the sun runs its course to a place appointed.64 

The  Lam,  translated  here  as  ‘to’,  expresses also  the  meaning of  ‘in’.  Thus, ordinary 
believers see it as meaning ‘to’ and understand that the sun, which is a mobile lamp 
providing light and heat for them, will certainly conclude its journeying and reach its 
place of rest, then take on a form which will no longer be beneficial. And pondering 
over the great bounties the All-Glorious Creator has attached to the sun, they declare: 
“Glory be to God! All praise and thanks be to God!” 

A learned scholar would also show the Lam as meaning ‘to’, but he would think 

of it not only as a lamp, but also as a shuttle weaving the  

                                                 

63 Qur’an, 21:30. 
64 Qur’an, 36:38. 

 

405

tapestries of the Sustainer on the loom of spring and summer, as an ink-pot whose ink 
is light for the letters of the Eternally Besought One written on the pages of night and 
day.  And  thinking  of  the  order  and  regularity  of  the  world,  of  which  the  apparent 
movement  of  the  sun  is  a  sign  and  to  which  it  points,  he  would  exclaim  before  His 
wisdom: “What wonders God has willed!”, and declare before the All-Wise Maker’s 
art: “How great are His blessings!”, and he would bow in prostration.  

A geographer and philosopher would explain the Lam as meaning ‘in’, like this: 
through the Divine command and with a spring-like motion on its own axis, the sun 
orders and propels the solar system. Exclaiming in wonder and amazement before the 
All-Glorious  Maker  Who  thus  creates  and  sets  in  order  this  mighty  clock:  “All 
mightiness is God’s, and all power!”, he would cast away philosophy and embrace the 
wisdom of the Qur’an. 

A  precise  scholar  would  consider  this  Lam  as  both  causal  and  adverbial,  and 
would explain it like this: “Since the All-Wise Maker has made apparent causes a veil 
to His works, through a Divine law of His called gravity, He has tied the planets to the 
sun  like  stones  in  a  sling,  and  causes  them  to  revolve  with  different  but  regular 
motions within the sphere of His wisdom; and He has made the sun’s spinning on its 
own axis an apparent cause giving rise to the gravity. That  is, the meaning of (to) a 
place appointed, is ‘it is in motion in its own appointed place for the stability of the 
solar system.’ For it is a Divine rule, a dominical law  like motion apparently  giving 
rise to heat, and heat to force, and force to gravity.” Thus, on understanding this from 
a single letter of the Qur’an, the philosopher would declare: “All praise and thanks be 
to God! It is in the Qur’an that true wisdom is to be found. I consider philosophy to be 
worth virtually nothing!” 

And  the  following  idea would occur  to  a  thinker  of  poetic  bent  from this  La\m 
and the stability mentioned above: “The sun is a luminous tree, and the planets are its 
mobile fruits. But contrary to trees the sun shakes itself so the fruits do not fall. If it 
did not shake itself, they would fall and be scattered.” Then he would think to himself: 
“The sun is the ecstatic leader of a group reciting God’s Names. It recites in ecstasy in 
the centre of the circle and causes others to recite.” In another treatise, I described this 
meaning as follows: 

Yes, the sun is a fruit-bearing tree; it shakes itself, so that the planets fall not, 

its fruits. 

If  it  rested  in  silence,  the  attraction  would  cease;  and  they  would  weep 

through space, its ecstatics. 

A further example: 

It is they who shall prosper.65 

                                                 

65 Qur’an, 2:5. 

 

406

This  verse  is  general  and  unspecific,  it  does  not  specify  in  what  way  they  shall  be 
successful, so that each person may find what he wants in it. Its words are few, so that 
they may be lengthy. For the aim of some of those it is addressing is to be saved from 
the Fire. Others think only of Paradise. Some desire eternal happiness. Yet others seek 
only God’s pleasure. While others know their aim and desire to be the vision of God; 
and so on. In numerous places, the Qur’an leaves the words open in this way, so that 
they may be general. It leaves things unsaid, so that it can express many meanings. It 
makes it brief, so that everyone may find his share. Thus, it says, who shall prosper. It 
does not determine how they shall prosper. It is as if with this omission it is saying: 
“O  Muslims!  Good  news!  O  you  who  fear  God!  You  shall  find  prosperity  through 
being saved from Hell. O righteous one! You shall find prosperity in Paradise. O you 
who seeks knowledge of God! You will attain God’s pleasure. O lover of God! You 
will experience the vision of God.” And so on.  

Thus,  out  of  thousands  we  have  offered  one  example  of  each  of  the  phrases, 
words,  letters,  and  omissions  demonstrating  the  comprehensiveness  of  the  Qur’an’s 
words. You may make analogies and compare its verses and stories with these. 

Another example, the verse, 

Know then that there is no god but God, and ask forgiveness for your fault.66 

This  verse  contains  so  many  aspects  and  degrees  that  all  the  levels  of  saints  have 
found their needs from it in all their spiritual journeyings and in all their degrees, and 
have found spiritual sustenance and a fresh meaning from it appropriate for their own 
level. For, since the Name of ‘Allah’  is a comprehensive Name, there are aspects of 
Divine  unity  within  it  to  the  number  of  the  Most  Beautiful  Names:  “There  is  no 
provider but Him! There is  no creator but Him!  There is no merciful one but Him!” 
And so on.  

And, for example, among the stories of the Qur’an, the story of Moses (Peace be 
upon  him)  contains  thousands  of  benefits,  just  like  the  Staff  of  Moses.  There  are 
numerous  aims  and  aspects  in  the  story,  like  consoling  and  comforting  the  Prophet 
Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him), and threatening the unbelievers, and 
censuring  the  dissemblers,  and  rebuking  the  Jews.  For  this  reason  it  is  repeated  in 
many Suras. Although it expresses all the aims in every place it is repeated, only one 
is the main aim and the others are secondary. 

If you say: How can we know all the meanings in the examples you have given, 

which the Qur’an intends and points to? 

                                                 

66 Qur’an, 47:19.

the  Qur’anic  commentators  and  scholars  of 

We would reply: Since the Qur’an is a pre-eternal address, and sitting above and 
beyond the centuries, which, layer upon layer, are all different, addresses and instructs 
all  of  mankind  lined  up  within  them,  certainly  it  will  include  and  intend  numerous 
meanings according to those varying understandings, and will make allusions to what 
it  intends. The numerous meanings contained in the Qur’an’s words similar to those 
mentioned  here  have  been  proved  in  Isharat  al-I’jaz  (Signs  of  Miraculousness) 
according to the rules of Arabic grammar, and the sciences of rhetoric, semantics, and 
eloquence and their rules. According to the consensus of those qualified to interpret 
theology  and 
the  Shari’a  and 
jurisprudence, and according to the testimony of  their differences, on condition they 
are considered correct by the sciences of Arabic and the principles of religion, all the 
aspects  and  meanings  which  are  found  acceptable  by  the  science  of  semantics,  and 
appropriate by the science of rhetoric, and desirable by the science of eloquence, may 
be considered among the meanings of the Qur’an. The Qur’an has placed allusions to 
each of those meanings according to its degree. They are either literal or significative. 
If significative, there are allusions to them in either the preceding context or the after 
context  or  in  other  verses.  Some  of  them  have  been  expounded  in  Qur’anic 
commentaries  of  twenty,  thirty,  forty,  sixty,  and  even  eighty  volumes,  written  by 
exacting  scholars,  which  are  clear  and  decisive  proofs  of  the  extraordinary 
comprehensiveness of the Qur’an’s words. However, if in this Word we were to point 
out the allusions indicating all the meanings together with their rules, the discussion 
would become extremely prolonged. So we cut it short here, and for part of it, refer 
you to Isharat al-I’jaz. 

Second Flash:  This is the extraordinary comprehensiveness in its meaning. Yes, 
together  with  bestowing  from  the  treasuries  of  its  meaning  the  sources  for  all  the 
interpreters of  the  Shari’a,  the  illuminations  of  all  those  seeking  knowledge  of  God, 
the  ways  of  all  those  seeking  union  with  God,  the  paths  of  all  the  perfected  from 
among mankind, and the schools of all the scholars, the Qur’an has at all times been 
the  guide  of  all  of  them  and  directed  them  in  their  progress,  and  it  is  verified 
unanimously by all of them that it has illuminated their ways from its treasuries. 

Third Flash: This is the extraordinary comprehensiveness in its knowledge. The 
Qur’an has caused to flow forth from the oceans of its own knowledge, the numerous 
and various sciences of the Shari’a, the multifarious sciences of reality (haqiqat), and 
the innumerable different sciences of sufism (tariqat). Similarly, it has caused to flow 
forth in abundance and good order the true wisdom of the sphere of contingency, the 
true sciences of the sphere of necessity, and the enigmatic knowledge of the sphere of 
the  hereafter.  One  would  have  to  write  a  whole  volume  to provide  examples  of  this 
Flash, and so as mere samples, we point to the twenty-five Words so far  

 

408

written.  Yes,  the  veracious  truths  of  all  twenty-five  Words  are  only  twenty-five 
droplets from the ocean of the Qur’an’s knowledge. If there are errors in those Words, 
they spring from my defective understanding. 

Fourth  Flash:    This  is  the  extraordinary  comprehensiveness  of  the  subjects  it 
puts forward. Together with bringing together the extensive  subjects of man  and his 
duties,  the  universe  and  the  Creator  of  the  universe,  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  this 
world and the hereafter, the past and the future, and pre-eternity and post-eternity, the 
Qur’an  explains  all  the  essential  and  important  topics  from  man’s  creation  from 
seminal  fluid  till  when  he  enters  the  grave;  from  the  correct  conduct  of  eating  and 
sleeping  to  the  matters of  Divine  Decree  and  Determining; from the  creation  of  the 
world in six days, to the duties of the wind blowing, indicated by the oaths of, 

By the [winds] that scatter,67 

By the [winds] sent forth;68 

from His intervention in man’s heart and will, indicated by, 

comes between a man and his heart,69 

But you will not except as God wills,70 

and, 

and, 

to, 

And the heavens rolled up in His right hand,71 

that  is, to His  holding all the  heavens within  His  grip; from the flowers, and grapes, 
and dates of the earth described in, 

And We produce therein gardens of date-palms and vines,72 

to the strange truth expressed by, 

When the earth is shaken to its utmost convulsion;73 

from the state of the skies in, 

Then He directed [His will] towards the skies and they were smoke,74 

to  their  being  rent  with  smoke  and  the  stars  falling  and  being  scattered  in  infinite 
space; from the world’s being opened for test and examination, to its closing; from the 
grave, the first dwelling of the hereafter, and then from the

Intermediate  Realm,  the  resurrection,  and  the  Bridge,  to  eternal  happiness;  from  the 
events of the past, and the creation of the body of Adam and the dispute of his two 
sons, to the Flood, and the drowning of the people of Pharaoh, and the major events of 
most of the prophets; and from the pre-eternal circumstance alluded to by, 

Am I not your Sustainer? 75 

to the post-eternal occurrence expressed by, 

Some  faces  that  day  will  beam  in  brightness  *  Looking  towards  their 
Sustainer;76  

all  these  fundamental,  important  subjects  are  explained  in  a  way  befitting  the  All-
Glorious  One  Who  administers  the  whole  universe  as  though  it  was  a  palace,  and 
opens and closes this world and the hereafter like two rooms, and regulates the earth 
as if it was a garden and the heavens as though they were a roof adorned with lamps, 
and beholds the past and the future as though they were two pages present in His sight 
like a single night and day, and looks on pre-eternity and post-eternity as though they 
were  yesterday and tomorrow, in a form in which the two sides of a chain of events 
are  joined  together  and  touching  in  present  time.  Just  as a  master  builder  speaks  of 
two  houses  he  has  constructed  and  arranged,  and  makes  out  the  programme  and  list 
and index of the matters involved, so the Qur’an is fitting for the One Who makes the 
universe  and  arranges  it,  and  writes  out  and  displays  the  list  and  index  and  –if  one 
may say so– the programme of the matters concerned with it. There is no sign of any 
artificiality  or  false  display.  And  just  as  there  is  no  trace of  imitation  or  hint  of  any 
fraud, like speaking on behalf of someone else or supposing  itself to be in  someone 
else’s place and speaking, so too with all its seriousness, all its purity, all its sincerity, 
the  Qur’an’s  pure,  shining,  brilliant  exposition  declares:  “I  am  the  word  and 
exposition of the Creator of the world,” just as the light of day declares: “I came from 
the sun.” 

Indeed, apart from the Maker Who adorns this world with antique arts and fills its 
with  delicious  bounties  and  scatters  bountifully  over  the  face  of  the  world  together 
with these wonders of His art so many valuable gifts, and setting them in orderly lines 
spreads them out over the face of the earth, apart from this Bestower of Bounties, who 
else could the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition be fitting for – the Qur’an which fills 
the  world  with  this  clamour  of  salutation  and  acclaim,  this  resounding  praise  and 
thanks,  and  transforms  the  earth  into  a  place  for  the  recitation  of  God’s  Names,  a 
mosque, and place for gazing on the Divine works of art? Whose speech could it be 
apart from His? Who can claim ownership of it apart from Him?  

                                                 

75 Qur’an, 7:172. 
76 Qur’an, 75:22-3. 

 

410

Whose  word  could  it  be  other  than  His?  Whose  light  could  the  exposition  of  the 
Qur’an be, which solves the talisman of creation and illuminates the world, other than 
the Pre-Eternal Sun’s? Who has the ability to produce the like of it, and imitate it? In 
truth, it is impossible for the Artist Who adorns this world with His arts not to speak 
with  man,  who  appreciates  His  art.  Since  He  makes  and  knows,  He  surely  speaks. 
And since He speaks, it is surely the Qur’an which is appropriate to His speech. How 
should a Lord of All Dominion Who is not indifferent to the way a flower is ordered 
remain  indifferent  to  a  discourse  which  brings  all  His  dominion  to  a  clamour  of 
salutation  and praise?  Would  He  permit  it  to be attributed  to others  and  be  made  as 
nothing? 

Fifth Flash:  This is the wonderful comprehensiveness of the Qur’an’s style and 

conciseness. It consists of five ‘Glows’. 

First  Glow:  The  Qur’an’s  style  has  a  comprehensiveness  so  wonderful  that  a 
single Sura contains the ocean of the Qur’an, which  in turn contains the universe. A 
single of its verses contains the treasury of the Sura. And most of the verses are each a 
short Sura, while most of the Suras are short Qur’ans. Thus, this is a great favour and 
guidance  and  facilitating  arising  from  its  miraculous  conciseness.  For  although 
everyone  has  need  of  the  Qur’an  all  the  time,  either  due  to  foolishness  or  for  some 
other  reason,  they  do  not  have  the  time  to  read  all  of  it,  or  they  do  not  have  the 
opportunity. So in order that they should not to be deprived of it, each Sura is like a 
short Qur’an, and each long verse even has the rank of a Sura. Those who penetrate to 
the  inner meaning of things agree that the whole Qur’an is contained in the Sura al-
Fatiha, even, and the Fatiha in the Bismillah. The proof of this fact is the consensus of 
the scholars who have investigated it. 

Second Glow: The verses of the Qur’an are comprehensive through their denoting 
and indicating all the categories of speech and true knowledge and human needs, like 
command and prohibition, promise and threat, encouragement and deterring, restraint 
and  guidance,  stories  and  comparisons,  the  Divine  ordinances  and  teachings,  the 
sciences  related  to  the  universe,  and  the  laws  and  conditions of  personal  life,  social 
life, the life of the heart, spiritual life, and the life of the hereafter. So that the truth of 
the  saying,  “Take  whatever  you  want  from  the  Qur’an  for  whatever  you  want”  has 
become  accepted  to  such  a  degree  by  the  people  of  reality  that  it  has  become 
proverbial  among  them.  There  is  such  a  comprehensiveness  in  the  verses  of  the 
Qur’an that they may be the cure for every ill and the sustenance for every need. Yes, 
they have to be like that, because it is essential that the absolute guide of all the levels 
of the people of perfection, who continually rise in the degrees of progress, possesses 
this property. 

Third Glow: This is the Qur’an’s miraculous conciseness. It sometimes  

 

411

happens that the Qur’an mentions the two ends of a long chain in such a way that it 
shows clearly the whole  chain. And sometimes  it happens that it  includes explicitly, 
implicitly,  figuratively,  and  allusively  in  one word many  proofs  of  an  assertion.  For 
example, in the verse: 

And among  His  signs  is  the  creation  of  the  heavens and  the  earth, and  the 
variations in your tongues and in your colours,77 

by  mentioning  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  chain  of  the  universe’s  creation,  which 
forms  a  chain  of  signs  and  indications  of  Divine  unity,  the  verse  shows  the  second 
chain.  It  makes  the  first  chain  read  it  out.  Yes,  the  first  degree  of  the  pages  of  the 
world which testify to an All-Wise Maker is the origin of the heavens and the earth, 
their  creation.  Next  is  the  heavens  being  adorned  with  stars  and  the  earth  made  to 
rejoice with living beings. Then the change of the seasons through the subjugation of 
the sun and the moon. Then is the alternation of day and night, and the chain of events 
within  these.  And  so  it  goes  on  as  far  as  the  characteristics  and  distinguishing 
individual features on faces and in voices, the most widely spread loci of multiplicity. 
Thus, since there is an astonishing and wise order in the characteristics of individual 
faces,  which  are  the  furthest  from  order  and  most  subject  to  the  interference  of 
chance, if  it  is  shown  that  the  pen  of  a  most  wise  craftsman  works  there,  surely the 
other  pages,  whose  order  is  clear,  will  themselves  be  understood  and  display  their 
Inscriber.  And  since  the  works  of  art  and  wisdom  of  a  Maker  are  apparent  in  the 
original  creation  of  the  vast  heavens  and  earth,  Who  positions  them purposefully  as 
the  foundation  stones  of  the  palace  of  the  universe;  the  works  of  His  art  and  the 
impress  of  His  wisdom  will  surely  be  most  clear  in  His  other  beings.  Thus,  by 
exposing  the  concealed  and  concealing  the  obvious,  this  verse  expresses  a  most 
beautiful succinctness. 

Similarly in the verses from: 

So give glory to God when you reach eventide .... till 

And to Him belongs the loftiest similitude in the heavens and the earth; for He is 

Exalted in Might, Full of Wisdom,78 

the chain of proofs which begins  six times with the words, And among  His signs..., 
And  among  His  signs,  is  a  sequence  of  jewels,  a  sequence  of  light,  a  sequence  of 
miraculousness,  a  sequence  of  miraculous  conciseness.  I  wish  from  the  heart  to 
display  the  hidden  diamonds  in  these  treasuries,  but  what  can  I  do?,  the  discussion 
here does not support it. So postponing it to another time, I am not opening that door 
for now. 

And for example: 

                                                 

77 Qur’an, 30:22. 
78 Qur’an, 30:17-27. 

 

412

...Send me therefore * O Joseph! O Man of truth! 79 

Between ..send me therefore and O Joseph! are these words: ...Joseph, that I may ask 
him  to  interpret  the  dream.  So  I  sent  him,  and  he  went  to  the  prison  and  said  to 
Joseph...  That  is  to  say,  although  five  sentences  have  been  abbreviated  and 
summarized in one sentence, it does not mar the clarity or hinder the understanding. 

And, for example: 

Who produces for you fire from the green tree.80 

Here  the  Qur’an  is  saying  in  the  face  of  rebellious  man’s  denials,  who  is  as  though 
challenging  the  Qur’an by  saying,  “Who  will  raise  to  life  rotten bones?”,  “Whoever 
created  them  in  the  first  place,  He  will  raise  them  to  life.  And  that  Creator  knows 
every single aspect of every single thing. Furthermore, He who provides fire for you 
from  the  green  tree,  is  able  to  give  life  to  dry  bones.”  Thus,  this  sentence  looks  in 
numerous ways to the claim that man will raised to life, and proves it.  

Firstly, with these words the Qur’an starts off the chain of bounties it lays before 
man,  moves  its  forward,  and  calls  it  to  mind.  Having  described  it  in  detail  in  other 
verses, it cuts short the description here, and refers it to the intelligence. That is, “You 
cannot  flee  from  the  One  Who  gives  you  fruit  and  fire  from  trees,  sustenance  and 
seeds from plants, cereals and grains from the earth, and makes the earth a fine cradle 
for  you filled with all  your sustenance, and the world a palace in which is  found all 
your needs – you cannot be independent of Him, or disappear into non-existence and 
hide  there.  You  cannot  enter  the  grave  without  duties  to  sleep  in  comfort  not  to  be 
awoken.  

Then  it  points  out  an  evidence  of  the  claim.  With  the  words,  the  green  tree,  it 
implies: “O you who deny resurrection! Look at the trees! One Who raises to life and 
makes  green  in  spring  numberless  bone-like  trees  which  have  been  dead  throughout 
winter, and in every tree even demonstrates three examples of resurrection through the 
leaves, blossoms, and fruit – the power of such a One cannot be challenged through 
denial or by considering resurrection improbable.”  

Then  it points out another evidence, saying: “How do  you deem it unlikely that 
One Who extracts  for  you out of dense,  heavy, dark matter  like a tree,  subtle, light, 
luminous  manner  like  fire  should  give  fire-like  life  and  light-like  consciousness  to 
wood-like bones?”  

Then it states another evidence explicitly; it says: “One Who creates the famous 
tree which while green produces fire for nomads in place of matches when two of its 
branches are rubbed together, and combines two opposites  

                                                 

79 Qur’an, 12:46. 
80 Qur’an, 36:80. 

 

413

like the green and damp and the dry and hot, and makes them the source of the fire – 
everything, even the fundamental elements, looks to His  command and acts through 
His power. It cannot be considered unlikely of the One Who demonstrates that none 
of these is independent and acts of its own accord that He should raise up man from 
the earth once again, who was made from earth and later returned to the earth. He may 
not be challenged with rebellion.” 

Then, through recalling Moses’s (Peace be upon him) famous tree, it shows that 
this  claim  of  Muhammad  (Peace  and  blessings  be  upon  him)  is  also  that  of  Moses 
(PBH).  Lightly  alluding  to  the  consensus  of  the  prophets,  it  adds  one  more  subtle 
point to the phrase. 

Fourth Glow: The Qur’an’s conciseness is so comprehensive and wonderful that 
when  studied  carefully  it  becomes  apparent  that  sometimes,  through  some  simple 
detail  or  particular  event,  it  compassionately  shows  to  simple,  ordinary  minds  most 
extensive, lengthy, universal rules and general laws, like showing an ocean in a ewer. 
We shall point out only two examples of this out of thousands. 

First Example: This is the three verses expounded in detail in the First Station of 
the Twentieth Word, which describe under the name of ‘the teaching of the Names’ to 
the person of Adam, the teaching of all the sciences and branches of knowledge with 
which  the  sons  of  Adam  have  been  inspired.  Through  the  angels  prostrating  before 
Adam  and  Satan  not  prostrating,  they  state that  most beings  from  fish  to  angels  are 
subjugated to human kind, just as harmful creatures from snakes to Satan do not obey 
man  and  are  hostile  to  him.  And  through  the  people  of  Moses  (Peace  be upon  him) 
slaughtering a cow, they state that the concept of cow-worship –which was taken from 
the  worship  of  cows  in  Egypt  and  showed  its  effect  in  ‘the  event  of  the  calf’–  was 
slaughtered  by  Moses’  knife.  And  through  water  gushing  forth  from  the  rock  and 
springs  flowing out and spreading, they also state that the rock layer which  is under 
the soil layer acts as the source of both water springs and the soil. 

Second Example: This is the whole and the parts of the story of Moses (Peace be 
upon him), which is frequently repeated in the Qur’an, and each of the repetitions of 
which  is  shown as the tip of a universal rule, with each repetition stating the rule in 
question. For example: 

O Haman! Build me a lofty palace.81 

Pharaoh is commanding his minister: “Build me a high tower so that I can take a look 
at the heavens and observe them. I wonder if there is a God who governs in the skies 
like Moses claims, who can be seen from their  

                                                 

81 Qur’an, 40:36. 

 

414

disposition?”  Thus,  through  the  word  ‘palace’  and  this  minor  incident,  it  states  a 
strange  rule  dominant  in the  traditions  of  the  Egyptian  Pharaohs,  who, because  they 
lived  in  the  desert  with  no  mountains,  wanted  mountains,  and  because  they  did  not 
recognize  the  Creator,  were  worshippers  of  nature  and  claimed  godhead;  and 
worshipping  fame, through displaying the  works  of their dominion perpetuated their 
name  and  constructed  the  famous  mountain-like  pyramids;  and  agreed  to magic  and 
metempsychosis, and had their corpses mummified and preserved in their mountain-
like tombs. 

And, for example: 

This day We shall save you in your body.82 

By saying to Pharaoh, who is drowning: “Today I am going to save your body which 
will  drown,”  it  is  expressing  a  death-tainted,  exemplary  rule  of  the  Pharaohs’  lives, 
which  was,  as  a  consequence  of  the  idea  of  metempsychosis  and  mummifying  the 
bodies of all of them, to take them from the past and send them to be viewed by the 
generations of the future. And this present century a body was discovered which was 
the  very  body of  Pharaoh,  thrown  up on the  seashore  where  he  drowned. The  verse 
thus  states  a  miraculous  sign  of  the  Unseen,  that  the  body  was  to  be  borne  on  the 
waves of the centuries and cast up from the sea of time onto the shore of this century. 

And, for example: 

They slaughtered your sons and let your women-folk live.83 

With an event in the time of a Pharaoh, the slaughtering of the sons of the Children of 
Israel  and  the  sparing  of  their  women  and  daughters,  it  mentions  the  numerous 
massacres which the Jewish nation has suffered every age, and the role their women 
and girls have played in dissolute human life. 

And you will indeed find them, of all people, most greedy of life.84 * And you 
see many of them racing each other in sin and rancour, and their eating of 
things forbidden. Evil indeed are the things they do.85 * But they [ever] strive 
to do mischief on earth. And God loves not those  who do mischief.86 * And 
We  gave  [clear]  warning  to  the  Children  of  Israel  in  the  Book,  that  twice 
they would do mischief on the earth.87 * And do no evil nor mischief on the 
earth.88 

These two statements of the Qur’an directed at the Jews, comprise the two fearsome 
general rules, that that nation hatches plots in human social life

with their trickery, which shake human society. They say that just as it was that nation 
which made labour contest with capital; and through usury and compounded interest, 
made the poor clash with the rich, and caused the banks to be founded, and amassed 
wealth through wiles and fraud; so it was again that nation who, in order to take their 
revenge on the victors and governments under which they always suffered deprivation 
and oppression, were involved in every sort of corrupting covert organization and had 
a finger in every sort of revolution. 

And, for example: 

Then seek ye for death89 

That is, “If what  you say is true, seek death, but you won’t seek it!” Thus, through a 
minor incident in a small gathering in the presence of the Prophet (PBUH), it points 
out that the Jewish nation, which is most famous among the nations of mankind for its 
greed for life and fear of death, will  not, according to its tongue of disposition, seek 
death till Doomsday, and will not give up its greed for life. 

And, for example: 

Thus they were stamped with humiliation and indigence.90 

With  this,  it  describes  generally  that  nation’s  future  destiny.  It  is  because  of  these 
fearsome rules governing the destiny and character of this nation that the Qur’an acts 
so  severely  against  them.  It  deals  them  awesomely  punishing  slaps.  From  these 
examples draw analogies with the other stories and passages about Moses (Peace be 
upon  him)  and  the  Children  of  Israel.  Now,  there  are  very  many  flashes  of 
miraculousness  like  the  flash  in  this  Fourth  Glow  behind  the  simple  words  and 
specific subjects of the Qur’an. A hint is enough for the wise. 

Fifth Glow: This is the extraordinary comprehensiveness of the Qur’an in regard 
to its aims and subjects, meanings and styles, and its subtle qualities and fine virtues. 
Indeed,  if  the  Suras  and  verses  of  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  are  studied 
carefully, and especially the openings of the Suras, and the beginnings and ends of the 
verses, it will be seen that although it gathers together all the categories of rhetoric, all 
the parts of fine speech, all the classes of elevated styles, all the sorts of fine morality, 
all  the  summaries  of  the  sciences  relating  to the  universe,  all  the  indexes  of  Divine 
knowledge,  all  the  beneficial  rules  for  individual  and  human  social  life,  and  all  the 
luminous laws of the exalted physical sciences, not a trace of confusion is apparent. In 
truth, to gather together in one place this many different categories of knowledge and 
not  to  cause  any  dispute  or  difficulty  can  only  be  the  work  of  an  overwhelming 
miraculous order.  

                                                 

89 Qur’an, 2:94. 
90 Qur’an, 2:61. 

 

416

Then together with the order within this comprehensiveness, as is expounded and 
proved  in  the  previous  twenty-four  Words,  to  rend  the  veils  of  the  habitual  and 
commonplace,  which  are  the  source  of compounded  ignorance,  and  to  draw  out  the 
wonders concealed beneath them and display them; to smash with the diamond sword 
of  proof  the  idol  of  nature,  which  is  the  source  of  misguidance;  to  scatter  with 
thunderous  trumpet-blasts  the  dense  layers  of  the  sleep  of  heedlessness;  and  to 
uncover and reveal the obscure talisman of being and the strange riddle of the creation 
of the world, before which human philosophy and science have remained impotent, is 
most  surely  only  the  wondrous  work  of  a  wonder-worker  like  the  Qur’an  –  the 
Qur’an, which sees reality, is familiar with the Unseen, bestows guidance, and shows 
the truth. 

If the Qur’an’s verses are considered carefully and fairly, it will be seen that they 
do  not  resemble  a  gradual  chain  of  thought,  following  one  or  two  aims,  like  other 
books.  For  the  Qur’an’s  manner  is  sudden  and  instantaneous;  it  is  inspired  on  the 
moment; its mark is that all its aspects arrive together but independently from distant 
places, a most serious and important discourse which comes singly and concisely.  

Yes,  who  is  there  apart  from  the  universe’s  Creator  that could  give  a  discourse 
concerned to this degree with the universe and the Creator of the universe? Who could 
step beyond his mark to an  infinite degree and make the All-Glorious Creator speak 
according  to  his  own  whims,  then  make  the  universe  speak  the  truth?  Yes,  in  the 
Qur’an,  the  universe’s  Maker  is  seen  to  be  speaking  and  making  others  speak  most 
seriously  and  truthfully  and  in  elevated  and  true  fashion.  There  is  no  sign  at  all  to 
suggest imitation. He speaks and makes speak. If, to suppose the impossible, someone 
like  Musaylima  was  to  step  beyond  his  mark  to  an  infinite  degree,  and  by  way  of 
imitation  make  the  All-Glorious  Creator,  the  Sublime  and  Majestic  One,  speak 
according  to  his  own  ideas,  and  the  universe  as  well,  there  certainly  would  be 
thousands  of  signs  of  imitation  and  indications  of  falsehood.  For  when  the 
contemptible  assume  the  manner  of  the  lofty,  their  every  action  shows  up  their 
pretence. So consider carefully these verses, which proclaim this fact with an oath: 

By the star when it goes down! * Your companion is neither astray nor being 
misled  *  Nor  does  he  say  [aught]  of  [his  own]  desire  *  It  is  no  less  than 
revelation inspired! 91 

THIRD RAY 

This  is  the  miraculousness  of  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  which  is  its 
giving news of the Unseen, preserving its youth in every age, and being appropriate to 
every level of person. This Ray has three ‘Radiances’. 

                                                 

91 Qur’an, 53:1-4. 

 

417

First  Radiance:    This  is  its  giving  news  of  the  Unseen.  It  consists  of  three 

‘Glistens’. 

The First Glisten is its telling about the past, one part of the Unseen. Indeed, the 
All-Wise  Qur’an  mentions  through  the  tongue  of  one  whom  everyone  agreed  was 
both unlettered and trustworthy the important events and significant facts concerning 
the prophets from the time of Adam till the Era of Bliss in a way which, confirmed by 
scriptures  like  the  Torah  and  the  Bible,  tells  of  them  with  the  greatest  power  and 
seriousness. It concurs with the points on  which the former Books were agreed, and 
decides between them on the points over which they differed, pointing out the truth of 
the  matter.  That  is  to  say,  the  Qur’an’s  view  which  penetrates  the  Unseen  sees  the 
events of the past in a way over and above all the previous scriptures, and pronounces 
them  right  and  confirms  them  in  the  matters  on  which  they  are  agreed,  and  acts  as 
arbiter between them, correcting in matters about which they are at variance. 

However, the facts the Qur’an relates about the events of the past are not things 
that  could  have  been  learnt  through  the  exercise  of  reason  that  they  were 
communicated  by  it;  they  were  rather  transmitted  knowledge,  dependent  on  the 
heavens,  on  revelation.  And  as  for  transmitted  knowledge,  it  is the  domain  of  those 
who know how to read and write, and these were revealed to one known by friend and 
foe alike as knowing neither how to read nor how to write, and as being trustworthy; 
someone described as unlettered. 

Also,  the  Qur’an  tells  of  those  past events  as  though  it  had  actually  seen  them. 
For  it  takes  the  spirit  and  vital  point  of  a  lengthy  event,  and  makes  them  the 
introduction to its aim. That  is to say, the summaries  and extracts which the Qur’an 
contains show that it sees all the past together with all its events. For just as someone 
who  is  an  expert  in  some  science  or  craft  shows  his  skill  and  proficiency  through 
some  succinct  words  or  a  concise  statement, so  the  summaries  and  spirits  of  events 
mentioned in the Qur’an show that the one who said them comprehends all the events 
and sees them, and, if one may say so, relates them with extraordinary skill. 

The Second Glisten is its giving news of the future, which is another part of the 
Unseen.  There  are  many  sorts  of  this.  The  first  sort  is  particular,  and  special  to  the 
saints  and  those  seek  the  truth  through  illumination.  For  example,  Muhyiddin  al-
’Arabi discovered numerous instances of the Qur’an’s  giving news of the  Unseen  in 
the Sura, 

Alif. Lam. Mim. * The Roman Empire has been defeated.92 

And Imam-i Rabbani saw many signs of the events of the Unseen and the  

                                                 

92 Qur’an, 30:1-2. 

 

418

communicating of them through the ‘disjointed letters’ at the start of some Suras, and 
so  on.  For  scholars  of  the  Batiniya  School,  the  Qur’an  consisted  from  beginning  to 
end  of  information  about  the  Unseen.  We,  however,  shall  indicate  some  which  are 
general.  These  too  have  many  levels, one  of which  we  shall  discuss.  Thus,  the  All-
Wise Qur’an says to God’s Noble Messenger (Peace and blessings be upon him):93 

So  patiently  persevere,  for  God’s  promise  is  true.94  *  You  shall  enter  the 
Sacred Mosque if God wills, with minds secure, heads shaved, hair cut short, 
and without fear; * He it is Who sent His Messenger with guidance and the 
religion of truth, so it should prevail over all religion.95 * But they, after this 
defeat of theirs will soon be victorious, * within a few years. With God is the 
decision.96 * Soon will you see, and they will see * which of you is afflicted 
with  madness97.97  *  Or  do  they  say:  “A  poet!  We  await  for  him  some 
calamity  [hatched]  by  time?”  *  Say:  “Wait,  then.  And  I  shall  wait  with 
you!”98 * And God will defend you from men.99 * But if you cannot, and of a 
surety you cannot.100 * But they will never seek it.101 * We shall show them 
Our signs on the furthest horizons and in their own selves, so that it becomes 
clear to them that this is the Truth.102 * Say: If the whole of mankind and the 
jinns were to come together to produce the like of this Qur’an, they could not 
produce  the  like  thereof,  even  if  they  backed  up  each  other  with  help  and 
support.103 * God will produce a people whom He will love as they will love 
Him,  lowly  with  the  believers,  mighty  against  the  rejecters,  fighting  in  the 
way of God, and never afraid of the reproaches of such as find fault.104 * And 
say: Praise be to God, Who will show you His signs, so that you shall know 
them.105  *  Say:  He  is  the  Most  Merciful;  we  have  believed  in  Him,  and  in 
Him have we put our trust. Soon you shall know which [of us] it is that is in 
manifest error.106  

                                                 

93 Since these verses which give news of the Unseen have been expounded in numerous Qur’anic 

commentaries, and also due to the haste imposed on the author by his intention to have this work 
printed in the old [Ottoman] script,* they have not been explained here and those valuable treasuries 
have remained closed.  [*See, page 375, footnote 1 above. –Tr.]

* God has promised to those among you who believe and act righteously that 
He  will  of  a  surety  grant  them  inheritance  [of  power]  in  the  land,  as  He 
granted  it  to  those  before  them;  that  He  will  establish  in  authority  their 
religion, which He has chosen for them; and that He will change [their state] 
after their fear, to one of security and peace.107  

The information about the Unseen which many verses like these give turned out 
to be exactly true. Because it was  given by one  who was subject to many criticisms 
and  objections  and  could  have  lost  his  cause  through  the  tiniest  mistake,  and  was 
spoken  unhesitatingly,  and  with  absolute  seriousness  and  confidence  in  a  way  that 
confirmed  its  authenticity,  this  news  of  the  Unseen  demonstrates  with  certainty  that 
the one who gave it had received instruction from the Pre-Eternal Master, and then he 
spoke. 

The Third Glisten is its giving news of the Divine truths, cosmic truths, and the 
matters  of  the  hereafter.  The  Qur’an’s  expositions  of  the  Divine  truths,  and  its 
explanations  of  the  cosmos,  which  solve  the  talisman  of  the  universe  and  riddle  of 
creation,  are  the  most  important  of  its  disclosures  about  the  Unseen.  For  it  is  not 
reasonable to expect the human reason to discover those truths about the Unseen and 
follow  them  without  deviating  amid  innumerable  ways  of  misguidance.  It  is  well-
known that the most brilliant philosophers of mankind have been unable to solve the 
most insignificant of those matters by use of the reason. Furthermore, it is only after 
the Qur’an has elucidated those Divine truths and cosmic truths, which it points out, 
and after man’s heart has been cleansed and his soul purified, and after his spirit has 
advanced and his mind been perfected that his mind affirms and accepts those truths, 
and he says to the Qur’an: “How great are God’s blessings!” This section has been in 
part explained and proved in the Eleventh Word, and there is no need to repeat it. But 
when  it comes to facts concerning the hereafter and Intermediate  Realm, the  human 
mind  certainly  cannot  rise  to  them  and  see them  on  its  own.  However, it  can  prove 
them to the degree it sees them through the ways shown by the Qur’an. It is explained 
and  proved  in  the  Tenth  Word  just  how  right  and  true  are  these  disclosures  of  the 
Qur’an about the Unseen. 

Second  Radiance:    This  is  the  Qur’an’s  youth.  It  preserves  its  freshness  and 
youth every age as though  newly revealed. In fact, the Qur’an has to have perpetual 
youth since as a pre-eternal address, it addresses at once all the levels of mankind in 
every  age.  And  that  is  how  it  has  been  seen  and  is  seen.  Even,  although  all  the 
centuries  are  different  with  regard  to  ideas  and  capacity,  it  as  though  looks  to  each 
particularly, and teaches it. Man’s works and laws grow old like man, they change and 
are changed. But the rulings and laws of the Qur’an are so firm and well-founded that 
they  

                                                 

107 Qur’an, 24:55. 

 

420

increase  in strength as the centuries pass. Indeed, this present age and the People of 
the Book this age, who have more than any other relied on themselves and stopped up 
their ears to the words of the Qur’an, are so in need of its guiding address of, 

O People of the Book! O People of the Book! 

that  it  is  as  if  it  addresses  this  age  directly,  and  the  phrase  O  People  of  the  Book! 
comprises also the meaning of O People of the Modern Science Books!108  It delivers 
its shout of, 

O People of the Book! Come to common terms as between us and you109  

to the ends of the world with all its strength, all its freshness, all its youth. 

For  example,  modern  civilization,  which  is  the  product  of  the  thought  of  all 
mankind and perhaps the jinn as well, has taken up a position opposed to the Qur’an, 
which individuals and communities have failed to dispute. With its sorcery it impugns 
the Qur’an’s miraculousness. Now, in order to prove the claim of the verse: 

Say: if the whole of mankind and the jinns were to gather together,110 

we  shall  compare  the  foundations  and  principles  which  civilization  has  laid  in  the 
form of dispute, with the principles of the Qur’an. 

At  the  First  Degree:  The  comparisons  and  balances  which  form  all  the  Words 
from  the  First  to  the  Twenty-Fifth,  and  the  verses  at  their  heads  which  form  their 
truths,  all  prove  with  the  certainty  that  two  plus  two  equals  four  the  Qur’an’s 
miraculousness and superiority in the face of civilization. 

At the Second Degree: Like the proofs in the Twelfth Word, it is to summarize a 
number  of  principles.  By  reason  of  its  philosophy,  present-day  civilization  accepts 
‘force’ as the point of support in the life of society. It takes as its aim ‘benefits,’ and 
considers  the  principle  of  its  life  to  be  ‘conflict.’  It  considers  the  bond  between 
communities  to  be  ‘racialism  and  negative  nationalism.’  While  its  aim  is  to provide 
‘amusements’  for  gratifying  the  appetites  of  the  soul  and  increasing  man’s  needs. 
However,  the  mark  of  force  is  aggression.  And  since  the  benefits  are  insufficient  to 
meet all needs, their mark is that everyone tussles and jostles over them. The mark of 
conflict  is  contention,  and  the  mark  of  racialism,  aggression,  since  it  thrives  on 
devouring others. Thus, it is because of these principles of civilization that despite all 
its virtues, it has provided a sort of superficial happiness for only twenty per cent of 
mankind and cast eighty per cent into distress and poverty. 

The wisdom of the Qur’an, however, takes as its point of support ‘truth’ in stead 

of force, and in place of benefit has ‘virtue and God’s pleasure’ as  

                                                 

108 Ehl-i Mekteb, those educated in modern secular schools, as opposed to Ehl-i Kitab. [Tr.] 
109 Qur’an, 3:64. 
110 Qur’an, 17:88. 

 

421

its  aims.  It  considers  ‘the  principle  of  mutual  assistance’  to  be  fundamental  in  life, 
rather than conflict. In the ties between communities it accepts ‘the bonds of religion, 
class,  and  country,’  in  place  of  racialism  and  nationalism.  Its  aims  are  to  place  a 
barrier before the illicit assaults of the soul’s base appetites and to urge the spirit to 
sublime  matters,  to  satisfy  man’s  elevated  emotions  and  encourage  him  towards  the 
human  perfections.  And  as  for  the  truth,  its  mark  is  concord,  the  mark  of  virtue  is 
mutual support, and the mark of mutual assistance, hastening to help one another. The 
mark  of  religion  is  brotherhood  and  attraction.  And  the  result  of  reining  in  and 
tethering the evil-commanding  soul and leaving the  spirit  free  and urging  it towards 
perfection  is  happiness in this  world and the  next. Thus, despite the  virtues present-
day civilization has acquired from the guidance of the Qur’an in particular, and from 
the preceding revealed religions, in point of fact it has thus suffered defeat before the 
Qur’an. 

Third Degree: Of thousands of matters, we shall point out only three or four by 
way of example. Since the Qur’an’s principles and laws have come from pre-eternity, 
they  shall  go  to  post-eternity.  They  are  not  condemned  to  grow  old  and  die  like 
civilization’s  laws.  They  are  always  young  and  strong.  For  example,  despite  all  its 
societies for good works, all its establishments for the teaching of ethics, all its severe 
discipline and regulations, civilization has been unable to contest the All-Wise Qur’an 
on two of its matters, and has been defeated by them. These two matters are: 
Be steadfast in performing the prayers, and give zakat,111 

and,  

like this: 

God has permitted trade and forbidden usury.112 

We shall describe them, this miraculous victory, by means of an introduction. It is 

As is proved in Isharat al-I’jaz, just as the source of mankind’s revolutions is one 

phrase, so another phrase is the origin of all immorality. 

First Phrase: “So long as I’m full, what is it to me if others die of hunger.” 
Second Phrase: “You work so that I can eat.” 
Yes, the upper and lower classes in human society, that is, the rich and the poor, 
live  at  peace  when  in  equilibrium.  The  basis  of  that  equilibrium  is  compassion  and 
kindness  in  the  upper  classes,  and  respect  and obedience in  the  lower  classes.  Now, 
the  first  phrase  has  incited  the  upper  classes  to practise  oppression,  immorality,  and 
mercilessness. And just as the second has driven the lower classes to hatred, envy, and 
to contend the upper classes, and has negated man’s tranquillity for several centuries, 
so too this century,  

                                                 

111 Qur’an, 2:43, etc. 
112 Qur’an, 2:275. 

 

422

as the result of the  struggle between capital  and labour, it  has been the cause of the 
momentous events of Europe well-known by all. Thus, together with all its societies 
for  good  works,  all  its  establishments  for  the  teaching  of  ethics,  all  its  severe 
discipline  and  regulations,  it  could  not  reconcile  these  two  classes  of  mankind,  nor 
could it heal the two fearsome wounds in human life. The Qur’an, however, eradicates 
the  first  phrase  with  its  injunction  to  pay  zakat,  and  heals  it.  While  it  uproots  the 
second  phrase  with  its  prohibition on  usury  and  interest,  and  cures  that.  Indeed,  the 
Qur’anic  verse  stands  at  the  door of  the  world  and declares  usury  and  interest  to be 
forbidden.  It  reads  out  its  decree  to  mankind,  saying:  “In  order  to  close  the  door of 
strife, close the door of usury and interest!” It forbids its students to enter it. 

Second  Principle:  Civilization  does  not  accept  polygamy.  It  considers  the 
Qur’an’s decree to be contrary to wisdom and opposed to man’s benefits. Indeed, if 
the purpose of marriage was only to satisfy lust, polygamy would have been contrary 
to it. But as is testified to by all animals and corroborated by plants that ‘marry’, the 
purpose and aim of marriage is reproduction. The pleasure of satisfying lust is a small 
wage given by Divine mercy to encourage performace of the duty. Since in truth and 
according to wisdom, marriage is for reproduction and the perpetuation of the species, 
since women can  give birth only once a  year, and can be impregnated only  half the 
month,  and  after  the  age  of  fifty  fall  into  despair,  and  men  can  impregnate  till  a 
hundred  years  old,  and  thus one  woman  is  insufficient  for  one  man,  civilization  has 
been compelled to accept numerous houses of ill-repute. 

Third  Principle:  Unreasoning  civilization  criticizes  the  Qur’anic  verse  which 
apportions  to  women  one  third  [in  inheritance].  However,  most  of  the  rulings 
concerning social life are in accordance with the majority, and mostly a women finds 
someone to protect her. As for the man, she will be a burden on him and will have to 
combine efforts with someone else who will leave her her means of subsistence. Thus, 
in this form, if a woman takes half of the father’s legacy, her husband makes up her 
deficiency. But if the man receives two parts from his father, one part he will give to 
maintaining  the  woman  he  has  married,  thus  becoming  equal  with  his  sister.  The 
justice of the Qur’an requires it to be thus. It has decreed it in this way.113 

Fourth Principle: Just as the Qur’an severely prohibits the worship of  

                                                 

113 This is part of my court defence, which was the supplement for the Appeal Court and which 
silenced the court. It is appropriate as a footnote for this passage. I told the court of law: Surely if there 
is any justice on the face of the earth, it will reject and quash an unjust decision which has convicted 
someone for expounding a most sacred, just Divine rule which governs in the social life of three 
hundred and fifty million people in the year one thousand three hundred and fifty, and in every century, 
relying on the confirmation and consensus of three hundred and fifty thousand Qur’anic commentaries, 
and following the beliefs of our forefathers of one thousand three hundred and fifty years.

idols, so it forbids the worship of images, which is a sort of imitation of idol-worship. 
Whereas civilization counts the representation of forms as one of its virtues, and has 
attempted  to  dispute  the  Qur’an  in  this  matter.  But  represented  forms,  whether 
pictorial  or  concrete,  are  either  embodied  tyranny,  or  embodied  hypocrisy,  or 
embodied  lust;  they  excite  lust  and  encourage  man  to  oppression,  hypocrisy,  and 
licentiousness. Moreover, the Qur’an compassionately commands women to wear the 
veil  of  modesty  so  that  they  will  be  treated  with  respect  and  those  mines  of 
compassion  will  not  be  trodden under the  feet  of  low  desires,  nor  be  like  worthless 
goods  for  the  excitement  of  lust.114  Civilization,  however,  has  drawn  women  out  of 
their homes, rent their veils, and corrupted mankind. For family life continues through 
the  mutual  love  and  respect  of  man  and  wife.  But  immodest  dress  has  destroyed 
sincere  respect  and  affection,  and  has  poisoned  family  life.  While  worship  of  the 
human  form  in  particular  has  shaken  morality  in  appalling  fashion,  causing  the 
abasement  of  man’s  spirit.  This  may  be  understood  from  the  following:  to  look 
lustfully and with desire at the corpse of a beautiful woman who is in need of pity and 
compassion  destroys  morality;  so  too,  to  look  lasciviously  at  the  representations  of 
dead women, or of living women, for they are like little corpses, shakes to their very 
roots the elevated human emotions, and destroys them. 

Thus, together with assisting  human happiness  in this world, all of thousands of 
matters of the Qur’an like the above three examples also serve eternal happiness. You 
can compare other matters to these. 

Just  as  present-day  civilization  stands  defeated  before  the  Qur’anic  principles 
concerning  human  social  life  and  in  reality  is  bankrupt  in  the  face  of  the  Qur’an’s 
miraculousness,  so  too  it  has  been  proved  decisively  in  the  previous  twenty-five 
Words  through  the  comparisons  between  European  philosophy  and  human  science, 
which are the spirit of civilization, and the wisdom of the Qur’an that philosophy  is 
impotent and the wisdom of the Qur’an miraculous. The impotence and bankruptcy of 
philosophy and miraculousness and wealth of Qur’anic wisdom have been proved in 
the Eleventh and Twelfth Words; you may refer to those. 
just  as  present-day  civilization 

the 
miraculousness of the Qur’an’s wisdom in regard to learning and actions, the same is 
true  for  literature  and  rhetoric.  The  comparison  of  the  literature  and  rhetoric  of 
civilization and those of the Qur’an is that of the dark grief and hopeless wailing of a 
motherless orphan and the low and uproarious song of a drunkard, and the  yearning, 
hopeful sorrow of an elevated lover arising from a temporary separation and patriotic 
songs urging victory or war and high self-sacrifice. For in regard to the effects of its 
styles, literature and rhetoric  

is  defeated  before 

Furthermore, 

                                                 

114 The Twenty-Fourth Flash of the Thirty-First Letter about the veiling of women has proved most 

decisively that Islamic dress is natural for women, and that to cast it aside is contrary to women’s 
nature.

produce either  sorrow or joy. And sadness is of two sorts. It is either a dark sorrow 
arising  from  the  lack  of  friends,  that  is,  having  no  friends  or  owner,  which  is  the 
sorrow  produced  by  the  literature  of  civilization,  which  is  stained  by  misguidance, 
enamoured of nature, tainted by  heedlessness, or it  is the second sorrow. This arises 
from  the  separation  of  friends,  that  is,  the  friends  exist,  but  their  absence  causes  a 
yearning  sorrow.  This  is  the  guidance-giving,  light-scattering  sorrow  which  the 
Qur’an produces. Joy, too, is of two sorts. One stimulates the desires of the soul. This 
is the mark of civilization’s  literature in the  fields of theatre, cinema, and the  novel. 
While the other  joy silences the soul, and  is  subtle and mannerly,  innocently urging 
the  spirit,  heart,  mind,  and  subtle  faculties  to  attain  to  sublime  matters,  to  their 
original  home and eternal abode, and their companions of the hereafter;  it  is the  joy 
the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  produces.  It  fills  man  with  eagerness  for 
Paradise and eternal happiness and the vision of God’s beauty.  

Thus, the vast meaning and mighty truth expressed by the verse, 

Say:  If  the  whole  of  mankind  and  the  jinns  were  to  gather  together  to 
produce the like of this Qur’an, they could not produce the like thereof, even 
if they backed up each other with help and support115 

is  imagined  by  those  of  scant  intelligence  to  be  an  impossible  supposition  for  the 
purposes  of  uttering  an  exaggerated  piece  of  eloquence.  God  forbid!  It  is  not  an 
exaggeration, nor is it an impossible supposition; it is an absolutely truthful piece of 
rhetoric, and possible and actual. 

One aspect of its being in this form is this: if all the fine words of man and jinn 
which  do  not  issue  from  the  Qur’an  and  do  not  belong  to  it  were  to  be  gathered 
together, they could not imitate the Qur’an. And they have not been able to imitate it, 
for  they  have  been  unable  to  show  that  they  have.  The  second  aspect  is  this: 
civilization,  and  science  and  philosophy  and  European  literature,  which  are  the 
products of the thought and efforts of mankind and the jinn and even satans, remain in 
the very pits of impotence before the decrees, wisdom, and eloquence of the Qur’an. 
Just as we showed in the examples. 

Third  Radiance:    It  is  as  though  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  is  every  century  turned 
directly towards all the classes of humanity, and addresses each particularly. Indeed, 
since the Qur’an summons all mankind with all its classes and instructs them in belief, 
the highest and most subtle science, and in knowledge of God, the broadest and most 
luminous branch of learning, and in the laws of Islam, which are the most important 
and various of the sciences, it is essential that it should instruct every class and group 
appropriately. What it teaches, however, is the same; it does not differ. In which case, 
there have to be different levels in the same lesson, and according to its degree, every 
class takes its share from one of the veils of the Qur’an. We  

                                                 

115 Qur’an, 17:88. 

 

425

have  given many  examples of this, and they  may be referred to. Here we  shall only 
indicate  one  or  two  minor  points,  and  the  share  of  understanding  of  one  or  two 
classes. For example: 

He begets not, nor is He begotten * And there is none like unto Him.116 

The  share  of  understanding  of  this  of  the  ordinary  people,  which  forms  the  most 
numerous class: “Almighty God is above having mother and father, relatives or wife.” 
While the share of a middle class: “It is to deny the divinity of Jesus (Peace be upon 
him),  and  the  angels,  and  anything  which  has  been  born.”  For  although  denying 
something  impossible is apparently purposeless, according to the rules of rhetoric, a 
necessary statement is intended, which gives it purpose. Thus, the purpose of denying 
son and begetter, which are particular to corporality,  is to deny the divinity of those 
who have offspring and parents and equals; and it is to show that they are not worthy 
of being worshipped. It is because of this that Sura al-Ikhlas is beneficial for everyone 
all the time. The share of a more advanced class: “Almighty God is above all relations 
which  suggest  giving  birth  and  being  born.  He  is  exempt  from  having  any  partners, 
helpers,  or  fellows.  His  relations  with  all  beings  are  those  of  Creator.  He  creates 
through  His pre-eternal will with the command of “Be!,” and it is. He is  far beyond 
having any relation which is contrary to perfection, or is compelling, necessitating, or 
involuntary.” And the share of understanding of a higher class still: “Almighty God is 
pre-eternal and post-eternal, He is the First and the Last. Neither in His essence, nor in 
His attributes, nor in His actions, has He in any way any equal, peer, like, or match, or 
anything  similar,  resembling,  or  analogous  to  Him.  Only,  in  His  acts,  there  may  be 
comparisons expressing similarity:  

And God’s is the highest similitude.”117 

You can draw analogies with the above for other classes, which all receive different 
shares,  like  those  who  have  attained  knowledge  of  God,  the  lovers  of  God,  and  the 
truly sincere. 

A Second Example:  

Muhammad is not the father of any of your men.118 

The  share  of  understanding  from  this  of  the  first  class:  “Zayd,  the  servant  of 
God’s Noble Messenger (Peace and blessings be upon him), whom he also addressed 
as ‘my son,’ divorced his stately wife because he did not find himself equal to her. On 
God’s  command,  the  Messenger  (PBUH)  took  her.  The  verse  says:  ‘If  the  Prophet 
calls  you son, it is in respect of his Messengership. In regard to his person, he is not 
your father, so that the women he takes should be unsuitable for him.’”  

                                                 

116 Qur’an, 112:3-4. 
117 Qur’an, 16:60. 
118 Qur’an, 33:40. 

 

426

The second class’s share is this: “A great ruler looks on his subjects with paternal 
compassion.  If  he  is  a  spiritual  monarch  ruling  both  outwardly  and  inwardly,  then 
since his compassion goes a hundred times beyond that of a father, his subjects look 
on  him  as  a  father  and  on  themselves  as  his  real  sons.  A  father’s  view  cannot  be 
transformed  into  that  of  a  husband,  and  a  daughter’s  view  cannot  be  easily 
transformed  into  the  view  of  a  wife,  so  since  the  Prophet’s  taking  the  believers’ 
daughters  would  seem  inappropriate,  the  Qur’an  says:  ‘The  Prophet  (PBUH)  acts 
kindly  towards  you  with  the  eye  of  Divine compassion, and  treats  you  in a  fatherly 
manner. In the name of his Messengership, you are like his children. But with regard 
to his human person, he is not your father so that his taking a wife from you should be 
unfitting.’” 

The third group would understand it like this: “You should not claim a connection 
with the Prophet (PBUH), and relying on  his perfections and trusting  in  his  fatherly 
compassion, commit errors and faults.” Yes, many people are lazy because they lean 
on  their  elders  and  guides.  They  even  sometimes  say:  “Our  prayers  have  been 
performed.” (Like some ‘Alawis) 

The Fourth Point. Another group would understand a sign from the Unseen from 
this verse, as follows: The Prophet’s male children would not remain at the degree of 
‘men’  [rija\l];  in  consequence  of  some  wise  purpose,  his  descendants  would  not 
continue  as  men.  Since  through  the  use  of  the  term  ‘rijal’  it  indicates  that  he  is the 
father  of  women,  his  line  would  continue  through  women.  And,  Praise  be  to  God, 
Fatima’s  blessed  descendants,  like  Hasan  and  Husayn,  the  radiant  moons  of  two 
luminous lines, continued the physical and spiritual line of the Sun of Prophethood. 

O God, grant blessings to him and his Family. 

[The First Light here reaches a conclusion with Three Rays.] 

SECOND LIGHT 

The Second Light comprises Three Beams. 

FIRST BEAM:  According to the testimony of thousands of brilliant scholars of 
rhetoric  and  the  science  of  rhetorical  style  like  Zamakhshari,  Sakkaki,  and  ‘Abd  al-
Qahir Jurjani, there  is  in the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition as a whole a pleasant 
fluency,  a  superior  correctness,  a 
firm  mutual  solidarity,  and  compact 
proportionateness,  powerful  co-operation  between  the  sentences  and  parts,  and  an 
elevated harmony between the verses and their aims. And yet, while there are seven or 
eight  significant  factors  that  might  mar  or  destroy  the  harmony,  co-operation,  and 
mutual support, and the fluency  and correctness, they do not mar them, indeed, they 
give  strength  to  the  fluency,  correctness,  and  proportionateness.  Only,  those  causes 
have exerted an influence to some extent and taken others out of the veil of the order 
and fluency. But just as a number of bumps and excres 

 

427

cences  appear  on  a  tree,  not  to  spoil  the  harmony  of  the  tree,  but  to  produce  fruit 
which will be the means for the tree reaching its adorned perfection and beauty; in just 
the same way, these factors stick out their knobbly heads in order to express meanings 
which  will  enhance  the  Qur’an’s  fluent  word-order. Thus,  although  the  Perspicuous 
Qur’an  was  revealed  part  by  part  like  stars  over  twenty  years  in  response  to  the 
circumstances  and  needs,  it  possesses  such  a  perfect  harmony  and  displays  such  a 
proportionateness that it is as though it was revealed all at once. 

Furthermore, although the circumstances which prompted the Qur’an’s revelation 
were all different and various, its parts are so mutually supportive that it is as though 
it  was  revealed  in  response  to  only  one  of  them.  And  although  the  Qur’an  came  in 
response to different and repeated questions, it displays the utmost blending and unity, 
as  though  it  was  the  answer  to  a  single  question.  And  although  the  Qur’an came  to 
explain the requirements of numerous diverse events, it displays such a perfect order 
that it is as though it explains a single event. And although the Qur’an was revealed 
through  Divine  condescension  in  styles  appropriate  to  the  understanding  of  the 
innumerable  people  it  would  address,  whose  circumstances  were  different  and 
diverse, it displays such a fine correspondence and beautiful smoothness of style that 
it is as though the circumstances were one and the level of understanding the same; it 
flows  as  smoothly  as  water.  And  although  the  Qur’an  addresses  numerous  classes 
distant from one another, it possesses such an ease of exposition, such an eloquence in 
its  word-order,  such  a  clarity  in  its  manner  of  expression  that  it  is  as  though  it  is 
addressing a single class. Even, each class supposes that it alone  is being addressed. 
And although the Qur’an was revealed in order to guide and lead to various aims, it 
possesses such an perfect integrity, such a careful balance, such a fine order that it is 
as though the aim was one. 

Thus,  while  these  are  all  causes  of  confusion,  they  have  been  employed  in  the 
Qur’an’s miraculous manner of exposition,  in  its  fluency and proportionateness. For 
sure,  everyone  whose  heart  is  without  disease,  whose  mind  is  sound,  whose 
conscience  is  not  sick,  whose  taste  is  unimpaired  sees  in  the  Qur’an’s  manner  of 
exposition  a  beautiful  smoothness  of  style,  a  graceful  harmony,  a  pleasing 
proportionateness,  a  unique  eloquence.  All  the  clear-sighted  see  that  the  Qur’an 
possesses an eye that sees the whole universe together with its outer and inner aspects 
clearly before it as though it was a page; that it turns the page as it wishes, and tells 
the page’s meanings as it wishes. Several volumes would be necessary if we were to 
explain the meaning of this First Beam together with examples, so sufficing with the 
explanations and proofs of this fact in my Arabic treatises and in Isharat al-I’jaz, and 
in the twenty-five Words up to here, I have only pointed out here these features of the 
Qur’an in it as whole. 

 

428

SECOND BEAM 

This  concerns  the  miraculous  qualities  in  the  Qur’an’s  unique  style  in  the 
summaries and Most Beautiful Divine Names, which it shows at the ends of its verses. 

REMINDER:  There  are  many  verses  in  this  Second  Beam.  These  are  not 
only examples for the Second Beam, but for all the preceding examples and 
Rays.  It  would  be  extremely  lengthy  to  explain  them  all  giving  them  their 
due,  so  for  now  I  am  compelled  to  be  brief  and  succinct.  I  have  therefore 
indicated  very  concisely  all  the  verses  which  form  examples  of  this  mighty 
mystery of miraculousness, and have postponed detailed explanation of them 
to another time. 

Thus, the Qur’an  of  Miraculous Exposition  mostly  mentions summaries at 
the  conclusion  of  its  verses  which  either  contain  the  Divine  Names  or  their 
meanings; or refer the verse to the reason in order to urge it ponder over it; or 
they comprise a universal rule from among the aims of the Qur’an in order to 
corroborate  and  strengthen  the  verse.  Thus,  in  the  summaries  are  certain 
indications  from  the  Qur’an’s  exalted  wisdom  and  certain  droplets  from  the 
water of life of Divine guidance, and certain sparks from the lightning of the 
Qur’an’s  miraculousness.  Now  I  shall  mention  briefly  only  ten  of  those 
numerous  indications,  and  point  out  a  concise  meaning  of  only  one  of 
numerous truths, which are all  one  example  out  of  many.  Most of these ten 
indications are found together in compact form in most verses and form a true 
embroidery  of  miraculousness.  Furthermore,  most  of  the  verses  we  give  as 
examples are examples of most of the indications. We shall point out only one 
indication for each verse, and shall just point lightly to the meanings of those 
verses given as examples in the preceding Words. 

First Quality of Eloquence: With its miraculous exposition, the All-Wise Qur’an 
lays out, spreads out before the eyes, the acts and works of the All-Glorious Maker. 
Then  it extracts the Divine Names  from those works and acts, or it proves the basic 
aims of the Qur’an like the resurrection of the dead and Divine unity. An example of 
the first meaning is this: 

He  it  is  Who  has  created  for  you  all  things  that  are  on  the  earth,  then  He 
turned His will to the heavens and ordered them as the seven heavens, for He 
has knowledge of all things.119 

And an example of the second part: 

Have We not made the earth as a resting place * And the mountains as pegs? 
*  And  [have  We  not]  created  you  in  pairs?  *  ....  until,  Verily  the  Day  of 
Sorting Out is a thing appointed.120 

  

                                                 

119 Qur’an, 2:29. 
120 Qur’an, 78:6-17. 

 

429

In  the  first  verse  it  describes  the  Divine  works,  and  sets  out  the  mightiest  of  them, 
which testify through their order and aims to knowledge and power, like the premises 
of a conclusion, or a momentous aim. Then it extracts the Name of All-Knowing. In 
the second verse, as is explained briefly in the Third Point of the First Ray in the First 
Light,  it  mentions  Almighty  God’s  mighty  acts  and  works,  then  concludes  the 
resurrection of the dead, which is the Day of Sorting Out. 

Second Point of Eloquence: The Qur’an unrolls the woven fabrics of Divine art 
and  displays  them  to  the  human  gaze.  Then,  in  the  summaries  it  passes  over  the 
weaving within the Divine Names, or else refers them to the reason. 

The first example of these: 

Say: who is it that sustains you from the sky and from the earth? Or who is it 
that  has  power  over  hearing  and  sight?  And  who  is  it  that  brings  out  the 
living from the dead and the dead from the living? And who is it that rules 
and regulate all affairs? They will say, “God.” Say: Will you not then show 
piety [to Him]? * This is God, your Sustainer, The Truth.121 

Thus, at the start it asks: “Who is it that readies the skies and the earth as though they 
were  two  storehouses  for  your  sustenance,  and  causes  one  to  produce  rain  and  the 
other, seeds? Is there anyone other than God Who could make them two subservient 
storekeepers? In which case, thanks should be offered to Him alone.” 

In the second phrase, it asks: “Who is the owner of your eyes and ears, the most 
precious of your members? From which workbench or shop did you obtain them? It is 
only your Sustainer that could give you them. It is He Who creates and raises you, and 
gave you them. In which case, there is no Sustainer but He, and the only one fit to be 
worshipped is He.” 

In the third phrase, it says: “Who is it that resurrects the dead earth and raises to 
life hundreds of thousands of sorts of dead beings? Who could bring this about apart 
from  the  True  God  and  Creator  of  all  the  universe?  It  is  surely  He  Who  brings  it 
about,  He  raises  them  to  life.  Since  He  is  Truth, He  will  not  violate  rights;  He  will 
send you to a Supreme Tribunal. He will raise you to life just as He raises to life the 
earth.” 

In  the  fourth phrase,  it  asks:  “Who  other  than  God  can  administer  and  regulate 
this vast universe with perfect order as though it were a palace or a city? Since it can 
be  none  other  than  God,  the  power  which  administers  with  extreme  ease  the  vast 
universe and all its heavenly bodies is so faultless and  

                                                 

121 Qur’an, 10:31-2. 

 

430

infinite it can have no need of partner or associate, assistance or help. The One Who 
directs the vast universe will not leave small creatures to other hands. That means you 
will be obliged to say: ‘God.’” 

Thus,  the  first  and  fourth  phrases  say  “God,”  the  second,  “Sustainer,”  and  the 
third, “Truth.” So understand how miraculously apt are the words: This is God, your 
Sustainer,  The  Truth.  It  mentions  Almighty  God’s  vast  disposals,  the  meaningful 
weavings of His power. Then through mentioning the Names of “God,” “Sustainer,” 
and “Truth,” it shows the source of those vast disposals of Divine power. 

An example of the second: 

Behold! In the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the alternation of the 
night and the day; in the sailing of the ships through the oceans for the profit 
of mankind; in the rain which God sends down from the skies, and the life He 
gives  therewith  to  an  earth  that  is  dead;  in  the  beasts  of  all  kinds  that  He 
scatters  through  the  earth;  in  the  disposal  of  the  winds  and  the  clouds 
subjugated between  the  sky  and  the  earth,  indeed  are  signs  for people  who 
think.122 

First this enumerates the manifestations of Divine sovereignty  in the creation of 
the heavens and the earth, which demonstrates Almighty God’s perfect power and the 
vastness  of  His  dominicality,  and  testifies  to  His  unity;  and  the  manifestation  of 
dominicality  in  the  alternation  of  night  and  day,  and  the  manifestation  of  Divine 
mercy in the subjugation of the ships in the sea, the most important means of transport 
in human social life; and the manifestation of the immensity of Divine power, which 
sends the water of life to the dead earth from the skies and raises to life hundreds of 
thousands of species and makes it like a exhibition of wonders; and the manifestation 
of  mercy  and  power  in  the  creation  of  infinite  numbers  of  different  animals  on  the 
earth from simple soil; and the manifestation of wisdom and mercy in the employment 
of  the  winds  in  important  duties  like  assisting  in  the  pollination  and  respiration  of 
plants  and  animals  and  in  the  impelling  and  regulating  of  them  so  as  to  make  them 
suitable  to  perform  those  duties;  and  the  manifestation  of  dominicality  in  the 
subjugation  and  gathering  together  of  the  clouds,  the  means  of  mercy,  suspended 
between  the  skies  and  the  earth  in  great  strange  masses,  and  dispersing  them,  as 
though  dispersing  an  army  for  rest  and  then  summoning  them  back  to  their  duties. 
Then,  in  order  to  urge  the  mind  to  ponder  over  their  details  and  essential  truths,  it 
says: Indeed are signs for people who think. In order to rouse people’s minds with it, 
it refers it to their faculties of reason. 

Third  Quality  of  Eloquence:  Sometimes  the  Qur’an  explains  Almighty  God’s 

acts in detail, then sums them up with a summary. It convinces with  

                                                 

122 Qur’an, 2:164. 

 

431

the  details  and  commits  it  to  the  memory  and  fixes  it  there  by  summarizing  it.  For 
example: 

Thus  will  your  Sustainer  choose  you  and  teach  you  the  interpretation  of 
events and perfect His favour to you and to the posterity of Jacob – even as 
He  perfected  it  to  your  fathers  Abraham and  Isaac aforetime;  indeed,  your 
Sustainer is All-Knowing, All-Wise.123 

With this verse, it points out the bounties bestowed on the Prophet Joseph and his 
forefathers. It says: “Out of all mankind Divine favour has ennobled you with the rank 
of prophethood; tied all the lines of prophethood to your line and made it the chief of 
all  lineages  among  mankind;  it  has  made  your  family  a  cell  of  instruction  and 
guidance in the Divine sciences and dominical wisdom, and united in you through that 
knowledge  and  wisdom,  prosperous  worldly  dominion  and  the  eternal  happiness  of 
the hereafter; and it has made you both a mighty  ruler of Egypt, and a high prophet, 
and a wise guide, and has distinguished you and your forefathers with knowledge and 
wisdom.” It enumerates these Divine bounties, then it says: Indeed, your Sustainer is 
All-Knowing, All-Wise. “His dominicality and wisdom require that He made manifest 
in  you  and  your  fathers and  forefathers  the  Divine  Names  of  All-Knowing  and  All-
Wise.” Thus, it sums up those detailed bounties with this summary. 

And, for example: 

O God! Lord of All Dominion, You give power to whom You will.124 

This  verse  shows  Almighty  God’s  disposals  in  mankind’s  social  life  in  such  a  way 
that  it  ties  glory  and  abasement,  poverty  and  riches  directly  to  Almighty  God’s  will 
and  wish.  It  means,  “Even  the  disposals  most  dispersed  through  the  levels  of 
multiplicity are through Divine will and determining. Chance and coincidence cannot 
interfere.”  After  making  this  statement,  it  mentions  the  most  important  matter  in 
man’s life, his sustenance. This verse proves with one or two introductory phrases that 
man’s sustenance is sent directly from the True Provider’s treasury of mercy. It is like 
this:  “Your  sustenance  is  tied  to the  earth’s  life,  and  the earth’s  being raised  to  life 
looks to the spring, and the spring is in the hands of the One Who subjugates the sun 
and the moon, and alternates the night and the day. In which case, only the One Who 
fills  the  face  of  the  earth  with  all  the  fruits  can  give  an  apple  to  someone  as  true 
sustenance. Only He can be his true Provider.” Then it says: 

And You give sustenance to whom You please without measure.125 

                                                 

123 Qur’an, 12:6. 
124 Qur’an, 3:26. 
125 Qur’an, 3:27. 

 

432

It summarizes and proves those detailed acts in this sentence. That is, “The One Who 
gives you unlimited sustenance is He Who performs these acts.” 

Fourth Point of Eloquence: It sometimes happens that the Qur’an mentions the 
Divine creatures with a particular arrangement of the sentence, then through showing 
that the creatures are within an order and balance and that they are its fruits, affords a 
sort  of  transparency  and  brilliance.  This  transparency  and  brilliance  then  show  the 
Divine Names, the manifestation of which is through that mirror-like arrangement. It 
is  as  though  the  above-mentioned  creatures  are  words,  and  the  Names  are  their 
meanings, or the seeds of the fruits, or their essences. For example: 

Man  We did  create  from quintessence of  clay * Then  We  placed him as  [a 
drop of]  sperm  in a place of  rest,  firmly  fixed; *  Then  We  made  the  sperm 
into a  clot of  congealed blood; then of that  clot We  made a  [foetus]  lump; 
then We made out of that lump bones and clothed the bones with flesh; then 
We  developed  out  of  it  another  creature.  So  blessed  be  God,  the  Best  of 
Creators!126 

Thus, the Qur’an mentions  in order those wonderful, strange, amazing, well-ordered 
and balanced stages of man’s creation in such a mirror-like fashion that 

So blessed be God, the Best of Creators! 

appears  of  itself  from  within  them,  and  makes  itself  exclaimed.  A  scribe  who  was 
writing  out  this  verse  uttered  the  words  before  coming  to  them,  and  wondered  to 
himself: “Has revelation come to me as well?”  Whereas  it was the perfection of the 
order and transparency of the preceding words and their coherence which had showed 
up the final words before coming to them. 

And for example: 

Your  Sustainer  is  God, Who  created  the  heavens  and  the  earth  is  six  days, 
and is firmly established on the Throne [of authority]; He draws the night as 
a veil over the day, each seeking the other in rapid succession; He created 
the sun, the moon, and the stars, [all] subject to His command. Is it not His 
to  create  and  to  command?  Blessed  by  God,  the  Sustainer  of  All  the 
Worlds!127 

In  this  verse,  the  Qur’an  points  out  the  sublimity  of  Divine  power  and  the 
sovereignty of dominicality. It shows an All-Powerful One of Glory established on the 
throne  of  His  dominicality,  Who,  with  the  sun,  moon  and  stars  like  soldiers  under 
orders  awaiting  his  command, rotates  the  night and  day  one  after  the  other  like  two 
lines or two ribbons, one white and one black,  

                                                 

126 Qur’an, 23:12-14. 
127 Qur’an, 7:54. 

 

433

and writes the signs of His dominicality on the pages of the universe. This he does in 
such a way that when a spirit hears the verse, it feels the desire to exclaim: “Blessed 
be God! What wonders God has willed! So Blessed be God, the Sustainer of All the 
Worlds!”  That  is  to  say,  Blessed be God, the Sustainer of All the  Worlds  is  like  the 
summary, the seed, the fruit, and water of life, of what has preceded it. 

Fifth Quality of Eloquence: The Qur’an sometimes mentions material, particular 
matters which are subject to change and are the means of various circumstances, then 
in  order  to  transform  them  into  the  form  of  constant  truths,  summarizes  them  with 
constant, luminous, universal Divine Names, and ties them up. Or it concludes with a 
summary which encourages thought and the taking of lessons. An example of the first 
meaning: 

And  He  taught  Adam  the  Names,  all  of  them,  then  placed  them  before  the 
angels, and said: “Tell me the Names of these if you are right.” * They said: 
“Glory be unto You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught 
us; indeed You are All-Knowing , All-Wise!”128 

First  of  all  this  verse  mentions  a  particular  matter,  which  is,  “In  the  question  of 
Adam’s vicegerency, it was his knowledge that gave him superiority over the angels.” 
Then within this event it mentions that of the angels’ defeat before Adam in respect of 
knowledge. Then it summarizes these two events with two universal Names: Indeed 
You are All-Knowing, All-Wise. That is: since You are All-Knowing and Wise, You 
instructed Adam and he prevailed over us. And since You are All-Wise, You treated 
us according to our abilities and gave him preference in accordance with his abilities. 

An example of the second meaning: 

And  verily  in  cattle  you  will  find  an  instructive  sign.  From  what  is  within 
their bodies, between excretions and blood, We produce for your drink, milk, 
pure and agreeable for those who drink it... 

until, 

Wherein  is  healing  for  men;  indeed  in  this  is  a  sign  for  a  people  who 
thinks.129 

These  verses  point  out that  Almighty  God  makes  creatures  of  His  like sheep,  goats, 
cattle,  and  camels  into  springs  of  pure,  delicious  milk  for  man,  and  artefacts  like 
grapes  and  dates  into  cauldrons  and  trays  laden  with  deliciously  sweet  bounties  for 
him, and tiny miracles of His power like the honey-bee into makers of a sweet, health-
giving  sherbet,  and  then  conclude  with  the  words,  Indeed  in  these  are  signs  for  a 
people who thinks,  

                                                 

128 Qur’an, 2:31-2. 
129 Qur’an, 16:66-9. 

 

434

thus urging man to think and take lessons and compare these with other things. 

Sixth  Quality  of  Eloquence:  It  sometimes  happens  that  a  verse  spreads  out 
dominical decrees over a great multiplicity of things, then it unifies them with a tie of 
unity  resembling  an  aspect  of  unity,  or  it  situates  them  within  a  universal  rule.  For 
example: 

His  Throne  does  extend  over  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  and  He  feels  no 
fatigue in preserving them, for He is the Most High, the Supreme.130 

Thus,  together  with  proving  with  ten  phrases  in  Ayat  al-Kursi  ten  levels  of  Divine 
unity in varying hues, with the phrase, 

Who is there that can intercede in His presence except as He permits?, 

it rejects utterly and vehemently the associating of partners with God and interference 
of others, and casts them away. Also, since this verse manifests the Greatest Name, its 
meanings related to the Divine truths are at a maximum degree, so that it demonstrates 
the dominical acts of disposal at a maximum level. Furthermore, after mentioning the 
Divine regulation of all the heavens and the earth and a preservation encompassing all 
things  at  the  maximum  degree,  a  tie  of  unity  and  aspect  of  unity  summarize  the 
sources of those maximum manifestations with the phrase, 

For He is the Most High, the Supreme. 

And, for example: 

It  is  God  Who has  created  the heavens and  the  earth and  sends down  rain 
from  the  skies,  and  with  it  brings  out  fruits  therewith  to  feed  you;  made 
subject to you the ships, that they may sail through the sea by His command; 
and the rivers [too] He has made subject to you; * and He has made subject 
to you the sun and the moon, both diligently pursuing their courses; and the 
night and the day has He [also] made subject to you; * And He gives you of 
all that you ask for. But if you count the favours of God, never will you will 
able to number them.131 

These  verses describe how Almighty God created the  huge universe as a palace 
for man, and sending the water of life from the skies to the earth, made the skies and 
the  earth  two  servants  producing  food  for  him.  Similarly,  He  made  ships  subject  to 
men  so that they might benefit  from the fruits of the earth found in  every part of it, 
and  also  exchange  the  fruits  of  their  labours  and  secure  their  livelihoods  in  every 
respect. That is, He made the winds as whips, ships as horses, and the seas as a desert 
beneath their hooves. And besides connecting man with every region of the earth by 
means of ships, He  

                                                 

130 Qur’an, 2:255. 
131 Qur’an, 14:32-4. 

 

435

subjugated  the  rivers,  great  and  small,  to  him  by  making  them  means  of  transport. 
And causing the sun and moon to travel, the True Bestower of Bounties alternates the 
seasons  and  makes  them  two  obedient  servants  whereby  He  offers  man  His 
multicoloured bounties which change with the seasons;  He created them also as two 
steersmen turning that mighty wheel. And He made the night and day subject to man; 
that  is,  He made the night as a  veil  for his  sleep and repose, and the day a place of 
trade for winning his livelihood.  

After enumerating these Divine bounties, with the summary: 

And He gives you of all that you ask for. But if you count the favours of God, 
never will you will be able to number them, 

it  points  out  the  vast  extent  of  the  bounties  bestowed  on  man,  and  their  abounding 
profusion  and  abundance.  That  is,  whatever  man  asks  for  through  the  tongue  of  his 
capacity and innate needs, they have all been given him. An end can never be reached 
in  counting  the  Divine  bounties  bestowed  on  man  nor  can  they  be  exhausted. 
Certainly, since the heavens and the earth are a table of bounties for man, and things 
like  the  sun  and  the  moon  and  night  and  day  some  of  the  bounties  on  the  table,  the 
bounties directed towards man are most surely beyond count and calculation. 

Seventh  Mystery  of  Eloquence:  It  sometimes  happens  that  in  order  to  disallow 
apparent causes the ability to create and to demonstrate how far they are from this, a 
verse  points  out  the  aims  and  fruits of  the  effects  so  that  it  may  be  understood  that 
causes are only an apparent veil. For to will that  most wise and purposeful aims are 
followed, and important results are obtained, is of  necessity  the work of one who is 
most Knowing and Wise. Whereas causes are lifeless and without intelligence. So by 
mentioning  the  aims  and  results,  such  verses  show  that  although  causes  are 
superficially and as beings joined to and adjacent to their effects, in reality there is a 
great distance between them. The distance from the cause to the creation of the effect 
is  so great that the  hand of the greatest causes cannot reach the creation of the most 
insignificant effects. Thus, it is within this long distance between cause and effect that 
the Divine Names each rise like stars. The place of their rising is this distance. To the 
superficial  glance  mountains  on  the  horizon  appear  to  be  joined  to  and  contiguous 
with the skirts of the sky, although from the mountains to the sky is a vast distance in 
which the stars rise and other things are situated; so too the distance between causes 
and effects  is such that it may be seen only with the  light of the Qur’an through the 
telescope of belief. For example: 

Then  let  man  consider  his  sustenance.  *  For  that  We  pour  forth  water  in  
abundance.  *  And  We  split  the  earth  into  fragments.  *  And  We  produce 
therein corn, * And grapes and nutritious plants, * And olives 

 

436

 and dates, * And enclosed gardens, dense with lofty trees, * And fruits and 
fodder, * For use and convenience to you and your cattle.132   

By  mentioning  miracles  of  Divine  power  in  a  purposeful  sequence,  this  verse  ties 
causes to effects and with the words, For use and convenience to you points to an aim 
at  its  conclusion.  This  aim  proves  that  within  the  sequence  of  all  the  causes  and 
effects is a hidden disposer who sees and follows the aim, to whom the causes are a 
veil.  Indeed,  with  the  phrase,  For  use  and  convenience  to  you  and  your  cattle,  it 
disallows all the causes the ability to create. It is in effect saying: “Rain comes from 
the  sky  in  order  to  produce  food  for  you  and  your  animals.  Since  water  does  not 
possess the ability to pity you and produce food, it means that the rain does not come, 
it is sent. And the earth produces plants and your food comes from there. But lacking 
feelings  and  intelligence,  it  is  far  beyond  the  ability  of  the  earth  to  think  of  your 
sustenance and feel compassion for you, so it does not produce it itself. Furthermore, 
since  it  is  remote  from  plants  and  trees  to  consider  your  food  and  compassionately 
produce  fruits  and  grains  for  you,  the  verse  demonstrates  that  they  are  strings  and 
ropes which One All-Wise and Compassionate extends from behind the veil, to which 
He  attaches  His  bounties  and  holds  out  to  animate  creatures.”  Thus,  from  this 
explanation  numerous  Divine  Names  rise, 
like  All-Compassionate,  Provider, 
Bestower, and All-Generous. 
And another example: 

Do  you  not  see  that  God  makes  the  clouds  move  gently,  then  joins  them 
together, then makes them into a heap? – then will you see rain issue forth 
from  their  midst.  And  He  sends  down  from  the  sky  mountain  [masses  of 
clouds] wherein is hail; He strikes therewith whom He pleases and He turns 
it  away  from  whom  He  pleases.  The  vivid  flash  of  His  lightning  well-nigh 
blinds the sight. * It is God Who alternates the night and the day; indeed in 
these things is an instructive example for those who have vision. * And God 
has created every animal from water; of them are some that creep on their 
bellies; some that walk on two legs; and some that walk on four. God creates 
what He wills; for verily God has power over all things.133 

This verse explains the wondrous disposals in the formation of clouds and causing of 
rainfall, which is one of the most important miracles of dominicality and strangest veil 
of the treasury of mercy.  Like soldiers who have dispersed to rest gather together at 
the  call of a bugle, clouds gather and form at the Divine command when their parts 
have been dispersed and hidden  in the atmosphere. Then,  like an army  is  formed of 
small groups, the  

                                                 

132 Qur’an, 80:24-32. 
133 Qur’an, 24:43-5. 

 

437

pieces of cloud come together and form masses –which are vast and towering, moist 
and white, and contain snow and hail like the moving mountains at the resurrection– 
from which the water of life  is sent to living beings. But in  its being sent a will and 
purpose are apparent; it comes in accordance with need. This means it is sent. While 
the skies are clear and empty, the mountainous pieces of cloud do not gather together 
of  their  own  accord  into  a  great  gathering  of  wonders,  they  are  sent  by  One  Who 
knows  the  living  creatures.  In  this  distance,  then,  Divine  Names  rise,  like  All-
Powerful, All-Knowing, Disposer, Designer, Nurturer, Succourer, and Giver of Life. 

Eighth  Quality  of  Eloquence:  It  sometimes  happens  that  in  order  to  impel  the 
heart to accept Almighty God’s wondrous works in the hereafter and make the mind 
affirm  them,  the  Qur’an  mentions  His  amazing  works  in  this  world  by  way  of 
preparation, or it mentions the wondrous Divine works of the future and hereafter in 
such a way that we acquire firm conviction about them through similar things which 
we observe here. For example: 

Does  man  not  see  that  We  created  him  from  sperm,  and  behold,  he  stands 
forth an open adversary?134... to the end of the Sura. 

In this discussion of the resurrection of the dead, the Qur’an proves the resurrection in 
seven  or  eight  different  ways.  Firstly  it  draws  attention  to  the  first  creation,  saying: 
“You  see  your  creation  from  sperm  to  a  blood-clot,  from  a  blood-clot  to  a  foetus 
lump,  and  from  that  to  the  human  creation,  so  how  is  it  that  you  deny  the  second 
creation, which is like it or even easier?” 

And with the words: 

Who produces for you fire out of the green tree,135 

Almighty  God  indicates  the  mighty  favours  He  bestows  on  man,  saying:  “The  One 
Who bestows such bounties on you will not leave you at liberty to enter the grave and 
sleep never to rise again.” And by allusion  it  says:  “You see the dead trees come to 
life and grow green, but  you draw no conclusions from their bones springing to life 
when  like  dry  fire-wood,  and  so  deem  man’s  rising  again  unlikely.  Also,  could  the 
One Who creates the heavens and the earth remain impotent before the life and death 
of man, the fruit of the  heavens and the earth?  Would the One Who administers the 
mighty  tree  attach  no  importance  to  its  fruit  and  allow  others  to  claim  it?  Do  you 
suppose that He would abandon the result of all the tree, thus making purposeless and 
vain the tree of creation, which together with all its parts is kneaded with wisdom?” It 
says: “The One Who will raise you to  

                                                 

134 Qur’an, 36:77. 
135 Qur’an, 36:80. 

 

438

life  at  the  resurrection  is  such  that  the  whole  universe  is  like  a  soldier  under  His 
orders.” It is utterly submissive before His command of “Be!,” and it is. It is as easy 
for Him to create the spring as to create a flower. He is One for Whose power it is as 
easy to create all animals as to create a fly. Such a One may  not be challenged with 
the words:  

Who can give life to [dry] bones?,136  

and His power belittled.  Then, with the phrase:  

So glory be unto Him in Whose hand is the dominion of all things,137 

it  says:  “He  is  an  All-Powerful  One  of  Glory  in  Whose  hands  are  the  reins  of  all 
things, with Him are the keys to all things; He alternates winter and summer as easily 
as turning the pages of a book, and opens and closes this world and the  hereafter as 
though they were two houses.” Since it is thus, the conclusion of all these evidences 
is: 

And to Him will you all be brought back.138 

That  is,  “He  will  raise  you  to  life  from  the  grave  and  bring  you  to  the 
resurrection;there you will be called to account in the presence of the Almighty.”  

Thus, all these  verses  have prepared the mind to accept the resurrection, and so 

have they prepared the heart, for they have pointed out similar deeds in this world. 

It sometimes happens also that the Qur’an mentions Almighty God’s deeds of the 
hereafter in such a way that man may understand similar things in this world. Then no 
possibility  remains to  deny  them  or  deem  them  unlikely.  An  example  are  the  Suras 
which begin: 

When the Sun is folded up;139 * When the sky is cleft asunder;140 * When the 
sky is rent asunder.141 

In these Suras it mentions the mighty revolutions and dominical acts of disposal in the 
resurrection and Great Gathering in such a way that, since man sees things similar to 
them  in  this  world,  for  example,  in  the  autumn  and  spring,  he  accepts  those 
revolutions easily, which cause dread to the heart and cannot be comprehended by the 
mind. To provide even a summary of the meaning of these three Suras would be very 
lengthy, so for now we shall point out a single phrase by way of example. 

                                                 

136 Qur’an, 36:78. 
137 Qur’an, 36:83. 
138 Qur’an, 36:83. 
139 Sura 81, al-Takwir. 
140 Sura 82, al-Infitar. 
141 Sura 84, al-Inshiqaq. 

 

439

For example, the phrase: 

When the pages are laid open142 

expresses the following: at the resurrection all the deeds of everyone will be published 
written  on  pages.  Being  very  strange  on  its  own,  the  mind  cannot  grasp this  matter. 
But as the Sura indicates, the same way as in the resurrection of the spring are things 
similar  to  other  points,  the  things  similar  to  this  laying  open  of  the  pages  are  quite 
clear.  For  all  fruit-bearing  trees  or  flowering  plants  perform deeds, acts,  and  duties, 
and  in  whatever  way  they  display  the  Divine  Names  and  glorify  God,  they perform 
worship.  All  these  deeds  are  written  in  their  seeds  together  with  their  life  histories, 
and emerge in another spring in another place. Just as they mention most eloquently 
the deeds of their mothers and stock through the tongues of the shapes and forms they 
display,  so  they  publish  the  pages  of  their  deeds  through  their  branches,  leaves, 
flowers,  and  fruits.  Thus,  the  One  Who  carries  out  this  Wise,  Preserving,  Planned, 
Nurturing, Benevolent work, is He Who says: 

You can make analogies with other points from this and deduce them if  you can. To 
help you, I shall say the following: the phrase: 

When the pages are laid open. 

When the sun is folded up 

is  a  brilliant  metaphor  meaning  ‘rolling  up’  and  ‘gathering  up’;  so  too  it  alludes  to 
things similar to it. 

The First: Almighty God drew back the veils of non-existence, the ether, and the 
skies,  and  taking  from  the  treasury  of  His  mercy  a  lamp  like  a  sparkling  brilliant  to 
illuminate  the  world,  displayed  it  to  the  world.  When  the  world  is  closed,  He  shall 
rewrap that brilliant in its veils and remove it. 

The  Second:  The  sun  is  an  official  charged  with  spreading  out  the  wares  of  its 
light  and  wrapping  the  head  of  the  earth  alternately  in  light  and  darkness.  Every 
evening  it  gathers  up  its  wares  and  conceals  them,  and  sometimes  it  does  scant 
business due to the veil of a cloud, and sometimes the moon draws a veil over its face 
and somewhat hinders its transactions, then  it adjusts the account books of its wares 
and  transactions.  Similarly,  a  time  will  come  when  this  official  will  resign  from  its 
post.  Even  if  there  is  no  cause  for  its  dismissal,  due  to  the  enlargement  of  the  two 
black  spots on its  face, as  has begun, with Divine permission the sun will take back 
the light that it spreads at a dominical command and wrap it around its own head. It 
will  be  told:  “No  work  remains  for  you  on  earth.  Go  to  Hell  and  burn  those  who 
worshipped you and insulted an obedient official like  yourself by inferring  you were 
disloyal!” It will read out the decree of When the Sun is folded up through its black-
spotted face. 

                                                 

142 Qur’an, 81:10. 

 

440

Ninth  Point  of  Eloquence:  It  sometimes  happens  that  the  All-Wise  Qur’an 
mentions certain particular aims, then  in order to impel the mind by means of them, 
confirms, establishes, verifies, and proves the aims through the Divine Names, which 
are like universal rules. For example: 

God  has  indeed  heard  the  statement  of  the  woman  who  pleads  with  you 
concerning  her  husband  and  carries  her  complaint  to  God;  and  God 
[always] hears the arguments between both sides among you; for God is All-
Hearing, All-Seeing.143 

Here  the  Qur’an  is  saying:  “Almighty  God  is  absolutely  All-Hearing;  He  hears 
everything,  even,  through  the  Divine  Name  of  Truth,  a  wife  arguing  with  you  and 
complaining  about  her  husband,  a  truly  insignificant  matter.  And  since  women 
manifest  the  subtlest  manifestations  of  mercy  and  are  mines  of  self-sacrificing 
compassion, He hears through the Name of Most Compassionate the rightful claim of 
a woman and her complaint to Him, and through the Name of Truth takes it seriously, 
affording  it  the  greatest  importance.”  Thus,  in  order  to  make  this  particular  aim 
universal, One outside the sphere of contingency of the universe Who hears and sees a 
minor  incident  among  creatures,  must  of  necessity  hear  and  see all  things,  and  One 
Who  is  Sustainer  of  the  universe  of  necessity  sees  the  suffering  of  insignificant 
creatures within the universe who are wronged, and hears their cries. One who does 
not see their suffering and does not hear their cries for help cannot be the Sustainer. In 
which case, it establishes two mighty truths with the phrase, 

For God is All-Hearing, All-Seeing. 

And, for example: 

Glory be to [God] who did take His servant by night from the Sacred Mosque 
to  the  Farthest  Mosque,  whose  precincts  We  did  bless,  in  order  that  We 
might  show  him  some  of  Our  signs,  for  He  is  indeed  All-Hearing,  All-
Seeing.144 

Here, after mentioning the Noble Messenger’s (Peace and blessings be upon him) 
journey  from  the  Sacred  Mosque  in  Mecca  to  the  Farthest  Mosque  in  Jerusalem, 
which was the start of his Ascension, the Qur’an says: for He is indeed All-Hearing, 
All-Seeing.  The  pronoun  He  refers  to  either  Almighty  God  or  to  the  Prophet.  If  it 
refers to the Prophet, it is like this: “There was within this particular journey a general 
journey  and  universal  ascension,  during  which,  as  far  as  the  Farthest  Lote-tree  and 
distance  of  two bow-strings,  he  heard  and  saw  the  dominical  signs  and  wonders  of 
Divine  art  which  were  apparent  to  his  eyes  and  ears  in  the  universal  degrees  of  the 
Divine Names.”  

                                                 

143 Qur’an, 58:1. 
144 Qur’an, 17:1. 

 

441

It  shows  that  that  particular  and  insignificant  journey  was  like  a  key  to  a  journey 
which was universal and an assembly of wonders. 

If  the  pronoun  refers  to  Almighty  God,  it  is  like  this:  “He  invited  one  of  His 
servants to journey to His presence; and in order to entrust him with a duty, sent him 
from the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque, where He caused him to meet with 
the  prophets who  were  gathered  there.  Then  after  showing  that  he  was  the  absolute 
heir to the principles of all their religions, conveyed him through His realms in their 
inner and outer aspects as far as ‘the distance of two bow-lengths.’” 

He was certainly a servant and he journeyed on an ascension that was particular, 
but  he  held  a  trust  that  was  related  to  the  whole  universe,  and  a  light  which  would 
change the universe’s colour. Since he had with him a key to open the doors of eternal 
happiness,  Almighty  God  described  this  Being  with  the  attributes  of  hearing  and 
seeing all things. For in this way he could demonstrate the world-embracing purposes 
and instances of wisdom of the trust, the light, and the key. 

And, for example: 

Praise  be  to  God,  Creator  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  Who  made  the 
angels  messengers  with  wings,  two,  three,  or  four  [pairs]:  He  adds  to 
creation as He pleases, for God is Powerful over all things.145 

In this Sura, the Qur’an says: “By adorning the heavens and the earth in this way and 
displaying the works of His perfection, their All-Glorious Creator causes innumerable 
spectators to extol and praise  Him. He decks them out with uncountable bounties so 
that the heavens and the earth praise and extol unendingly the Most Merciful Creator 
through  the  tongues  of  all  the  bounties  and  those  who  receive  them.”  After  this  it 
points  out  that  since  the  Creator  has  given  men  and  the  animals  and  birds  members 
and  wings  with  which  to  travel  through  the  towns  and  lands  of  the  earth,  and  since 
that All-Glorious One has also given wings to the angels, the inhabitants of the realm 
of the heavens, in order to fly through the celestial palaces of the stars and lofty lands 
of  the  constellations,  He  is  certainly  powerful  over  all  things.  The  One  Who  gives 
wings to a fly, to fly from fruit to fruit, and wings to a sparrow to fly from tree to tree, 
is the One Who gives wings to the angels to fly from Venus to Jupiter. Furthermore, 
the angels are not restricted to particularity like the dwellers of the earth; they are not 
confined by a specific place. With the words: two, three, or four [pairs], it suggests 
that  at  one  time  they  may  be  present  on  four  or  more  stars;  it  gives  details.  Thus, 
through  describing  “the  arraying  of  the  angels  with  wings,”  which  is  a  particular 
event, it points to a universal, general workshop of Divine power and its immensity, 
and  

                                                 

145 Qur’an, 35:1.

verifies and establishes it with the summary: For God is Powerful over all things.  

Tenth  Point  of  Eloquence:  It  sometimes  happens  that  a  verse  mentions  man’s 
rebellious acts, then restrains him with severe threats. Then, so that the severity of the 
threats  should  not  cast  him  into  despair  and  hopelessness,  it  concludes  with  some 
Divine Names which point to His mercy and console him. For example: 

Say:  if  there  had  been  [other]  gods  with  Him  –  as  they  say  –  behold  they  
would certainly have sought out a way to the Lord of the Throne! * Glory be 
to  Him!  He  is  high  above  all  that  they  say!  –  Exalted  and  Great  [beyond 
measure] * The sevens heavens and the earth, and all beings therein declare 
His  glory;  there  is  not  a  thing  but  celebrates  His  praise;  and  yet  you 
understand  not  how  they  declare  His  glory!  Indeed,  He  is  Oft-Forbearing, 
Most Forgiving!146 

This verse says: “Say: if, like you say, God had had partners in his sovereignty, there 
would surely have been some signs of disorder, caused by the hand that stretched up 
to the throne of His dominicality and interfered. However, through the tongues of the 
manifestations  and  inscriptions  of  the  Divine  Names  which  they  manifest,  all 
creatures, universal or particular, great or small, from the seven levels of the heavens 
to  microscopic  organisms,  glorify  the  All-Glorious  One  signified  by  those  Names, 
declaring Him to be free of partners or like. 

Yes, just as the heavens declare Him to be All-Holy through the light-scattering 
words of the suns and stars, and through the wisdom they display and their order, and 
testify to His unity, so the atmosphere glorifies and sanctifies Him through the voice 
of the clouds and words of the thunder, lightning, and rain, and testifies to His unity. 
The  earth  too  glorifies  and  declares  to  be  One  the  All-Glorious  Creator  through  its 
living words known as animals, plants, and other beings; and so does it glorify  Him 
and testify to His unity through the words of its trees and their leaves, blossoms, and 
fruits. Similarly, despite their tiny  size and insignificance, the  smallest creatures and 
most  particular  beings  glorify  the  All-Glorious  One  signified  by  the  numerous 
universal  Names  they  display,  and  testify  to  His  unity  through  the  inscriptions  they 
bear. 

Thus, since man is the summary and result of the universe, and vicegerent of the 
earth,  and  its  delicate  fruit,  this  verse  points  out  how  ugly  and  deserving  of 
punishment  is  his  unbelief  and  associating  partners  with  God.  For  it  is  counter  and 
contrary  to  the  whole  universe,  which  altogether  glorifies  unanimously,  with  one 
tongue, its All-Glorious Creator and testifies in  

                                                 

146 Qur’an, 17:42-4. 

 

443

its own way to His unity, and performs the duty of worship with which it is charged, 
carrying it out in perfect submission. But in order not to cast man into despair, and to 
show  the  wisdom  in  the  All-Glorious  Subduer’s  permitting  such  an  infinitely  ugly 
rebellion and not destroying the universe around mankind, it says:  

Indeed, He is Oft-Forbearing, Most Forgiving! 

It shows with this summary the wisdom in His postponing it, and leaves a door open 
for hope. 

Thus,  you  may  understand  from  these  ten  indications  of  miraculousness  that  in 
the summaries at the conclusions of verses are numerous sprinklings of guidance and 
flashes of miraculousness. The greatest geniuses among the scholars of rhetoric have 
bitten  their  fingers  in  absolute  wonder  and  admiration  at  these  unique  styles,  and 
declared:  “THIS  IS  NOT  THE  WORD OF  MAN,”  and  have  believed  with  absolute 
certainty that 

It is no less than revelation inspired.147 

This  means  that  together  with  the  above-mentioned  indications,  numerous  further 
facets not included in our discussion are contained in other verses in the arrangement 
of which such an  impress of miraculousness is apparent that even the blind may see 
it... 

THE THIRD BEAM of The Second Light 

The  Qur’an  cannot  be  compared  with  other  words  and  speech.  This  is  because 
speech  is  of  different  categories,  and  in  regard  to  superiority,  power,  beauty  and 
fineness, has four sources: one is the speaker, another is the person addressed, another 
is  the  purpose,  and  another  is  the  form.  Its  source  is  not  only  the  form  as  literary 
people  have  wrongly  shown.  So  in  speech  one  should  consider,  “Who  said  it?  To 
whom did they say it? Why did they say it? In what form did they say it?” One should 
not consider the words only and stop there. Since speech draws its strength and beauty 
from these four sources, if the Qur’an’s sources are studied carefully, the degree of its 
eloquence, superiority,  and beauty will be understood. Indeed, since speech  looks to 
the speaker, if it is command or prohibition, it comprises also the speaker’s will and 
power in accordance with  his position. Then it eliminates resistance;  it  has an effect 
like  physical  electricity  and  increases  in  proportion  to  the  speech’s  superiority  and 
power. Take, for example, the verse: 

O earth! swallow up your water. And O sky! withhold [your rain].148 

That is, “O earth! Your duty is completed, swallow your water. O skies! No need now 
remains, cease giving rain.” And for example: 

                                                 

147 Qur’an, 53:4. 
148 Qur’an, 11:44. 

 

444

And  He said  to  it and  to  the  earth:  Come  together  willingly or unwillingly. 
They said: We do come [together] in willing obedience.149 

That  is,  “O  earth!  O  skies!  Come  whether  you  want  to  or  not,  you  are  anyway 
submissive  to  my  wisdom  and  power.  Emerge  from  non-being  and  come  to  the 
exhibition-place  of  my  art  in  existence.”  And  they  replied:  “We  come  in  perfect 
obedience.  Through  Your power,  we  perform  every duty  that You  have  shown us.” 
Consider  the  power  and  elevatedness  of  these  true,  effective  commands,  which 
comprise  power  and  will,  then  look  at  human  words  like  the  following  nonsensical 
conversation with inanimate beings: 

Be stationary, O earth! Be cleft, O skies! O resurrection, break forth! 

Can  the  two  commands  be  compared?  Yes,  is  there  are  any  comparison  between 
wishes arising  from desires and officious commands  issuing  from those wishes, and 
the  command  of  a  commander  of  real  authority?  Can  there  be  any  comparison 
between  such  words  and  the  effective  command,  “Forward  march!”  of  a  supreme 
commander of a vast army? For if a command such as that is heard from a common 
soldier,  while  the  two  commands  are  the  same  in  form,  in  meaning  they  differ  as 
greatly as a common soldier and the commander of an army. 

And for example the verses: 

Indeed, His command when He wills a thing is “Be!,” and it is,150 

and, 

And on Our saying to the angels: Prostrate before Adam.151 

Look at the power and elevatedness of these two verses, then look at man’s speech in 
the form of commands. Is the latter not like a fire-fly in relation to the sun? In order to 
describe his act to both eye and ear, a true owner describes his act while performing it, 
and  a  true  artist  explains  his  art  as  he  works  it,  and  a  true  bestower  explains  his 
bounties  as  he  bestows  them,  that  is,  in  order  to  combine  both  word  and  act,  each 
says:  “Look!  I  have  done  this  and  I  am  doing  this  in  this  way.  I  did  that  for  this 
reason, and this will be thus, and I am doing this so it will be like that.” 

And for example: 

Do they not look at the sky above them? How We have made it and adorned 
it, and there are no flaws in it? * And the earth, We have spread it out, and 
set  thereon  mountains  standing  firm,  and  produced  therein  every  kind  of 
beautiful  growth  [in  pairs],  *  As  an  insight  and  reminder  for  all  [God’s] 
servants who turn unto Him. * And We send down from the sky rain charged 
with blessing, and We produce there 

                                                 

149 Qur’an, 41:11. 
150 Qur’an, 36:82. 
151 Qur’an, 2:34. 

 

445

with gardens and grain for harvests; * And tall [and stately] palm-trees, with 
shoots  of  fruit-stalks,  piled  one  over  another;  * As  sustenance  for  [God’s] 
servants; And We give [new] life therewith to land that is dead: thus will the 
coming-forth [from the grave].152 

Can there be any comparison between these descriptions, these acts, which shine like 
the starry fruits of Paradise in the constellation of this Sura in the skies of the Qur’an, 
and  this  mentioning  many  levels  of  proofs  within  them  by  means  of  the  order  of 
rhetoric, and this proving the resurrection of the dead, its conclusion, with the phrase 
thus will be the coming-forth, thus silencing those at the  start of the Sura who deny 
resurrection – can there be any comparison between this and the discussions of men 
about  meddlesome  acts  which  have  little  connection  with  them?  It  is  not  even  the 
comparison of pictures of flowers by way of copying, and real living flowers. To fully 
explain the meaning from Do they not look to Thus will be the coming-forth would be 
very lengthy, so we shall just pass over it with a brief indication, like this:  

Since, at the start of the Sura, the unbelievers deny resurrection, the Qur’an gives 
a long introductory passage in order to compel them to accept it. It says: “Do you not 
look at the skies above you, which we have constructed in such magnificent, orderly 
fashion? Do you not see how We have adorned it with stars and the sun and the moon, 
and how We have allowed no fault or defect? Do you not see how We have spread out 
the  earth  for  you  and  with  what  wisdom  We  have  furnished  it?  We  have  fixed 
mountains  on  it  and  protected  it  from  the  encroachment  of  the  sea.  Do  you  not  see 
how We have created every variety of plant and growing thing on the earth, beautiful 
and of every colour, and how We have made beautiful every part of it with them. And 
do you not see how we send down bounteous rain from the skies, and with  it create 
gardens and orchards, and grains, and tall,  fruit-bearing trees  like the delicious date, 
and how I cause them to grow and send My servants sustenance with them? And do 
you  not  see  that  I  raise  to life the  dead  country  with  the  rain?  I create  thousands  of 
worldly resurrections. Just as I raise up with My power these plants out of this dead 
country, that is how your coming-forth will be at the resurrection. At the resurrection, 
the  earth  will  die  and  you  will  come  forth  alive.”  Can  there  be  any  comparison 
between the eloquent explanations these verses set forth in proving resurrection, only 
one  thousandth  of  which  we  have  been  able  to  allude  to,  and  the  words  man  puts 
forward to support a claim? 

From  the  beginning  of  this  treatise  up  to  here,  in  endeavouring  to  make  an 
obstinate  enemy  accept  the  Qur’an’s  miraculousness  by  way  of  impartial  reasoning, 
known as ascertaining the truth, we have left secret many of the  

                                                 

152 Qur’an, 50:6-11. 

 

446

Qur’an’s rights. We have brought that Sun in among candles and drawn comparisons. 
We  have  carried  out  the  duty  of  ascertaining  the  truth,  and  have  proved  its 
miraculousness  in  brilliant  fashion.  Now,  in  one  or  two  words,  not  in  the  name  of 
‘ascertaining  the  truth,’  but  in  that  of  ‘reality,’  we  shall  point  to  the  Qur’an’s  true 
station, which is beyond comparison. 

Indeed,  the  comparison  of  other  speech  to  the  Qur’an  is  that  of  minuscule 
reflections  of  stars  in  pieces  of  glass.  How  can  the  Qur’an’s  words,  each  of  which 
depict and show a constant truth, be compared with the meanings man depicts through 
his  words  in  the  minute  mirrors  of his  thoughts  and  feelings?  How  can  the  angelic, 
living words of the Qur’an, which inspire the lights of guidance and are the speech of 
the  All-Glorious  Creator  of  the  sun  and  the  moon,  be  compared  with  man’s  biting 
words with their bewitching substance and sham subtleties for arousing base desires? 
Yes,  the  comparison  of  poisonous  vermin  and  insects,  and  blessed  angels  and 
luminous spirit beings, is that of man’s words and those of the Qur’an. The Twenty-
Fifth  Word  together  with  the  previous  twenty-four  Words  have  proved  these  truths. 
This claim of ours is not unsubstantiated; its proof is the above-mentioned conclusion. 
Indeed,  how  can  the  words  of  the  Qur’an,  which  are  all  the  shells  of  jewels  of 
guidance, and sources of the truths of belief and springs of the fundamentals of Islam, 
and have come directly from the Throne of All-Merciful One, and above and beyond 
the universe look to man and descend to him, and comprise Divine knowledge, power, 
and will, and are the pre-eternal address – how can its words be compared with man’s 
vain, fanciful, futile, desire-nurturing words? 

Yes, how can the Qur’an, which is like a tree of Tuba, and spreads in the form of 
leaves  the  world  of  Islam  with  all  its  qualities,  marks,  and  perfections,  all  its 
ordinances and principles, and displays as fresh and beautiful through its water of life 
its  purified  scholars  and  saints,  each  like  a  flower,  and  produces  all  perfections  and 
cosmic  and  Divine  truths  as  fruits,  and  again  like  a  fruit-bearing  tree  produces 
numerous seeds within its fruits each like a principle and programme for actions and 
displays  truths  in  continuous  succession  –  how  can  this  be  compared  with  man’s 
speech, which we know about? Where is the ground and where are the Pleiades? 

Although for one thousand three hundred and fifty years, the All-Wise Qur’an has 
set  forth  and displayed  all  its  truths  in  the market of  the  universe,  and everyone,  all 
nations,  all  countries  have  taken  some  of  its  jewels  and  its  truths,  and  they  do  take 
them, neither the familiarity, nor the abundance, nor the passage of time, nor the great 
changes  have  damaged  its  valuable  truths  and  fine  styles,  or  caused  it  to  age,  or 
desiccated it, or made it lose its value, or extinguished its beauty. This on its own is an 
aspect of miraculousness. 

 

447

If  someone  were  to  come  forward  now  and  put  some  of  the  truths  the  Qur’an 
brought into a childish order according to his own fancies, and if he were to compare 
these  with  some  of  the  Qur’an’s  verses  in  order  to  contest  them,  and  say  “I  have 
uttered words close to the Qur’an’s,” it would be utterly foolish, like in the following 
example:  there  is  a  common  man,  a  builder  of  ordinary  houses,  incapable  of 
understanding the elevated inscriptions of a master who has built a splendid palace the 
stones of which are various jewels, and has decorated it with harmonious adornments 
which  look  to  the  elevated  inscriptions  of  all  the  palace  and  their  relation  to  the 
stones. If the common man, who had no share in any of the jewels and adornment of 
the palace, were to enter the palace, destroy the elevated inscriptions  in the  valuable 
stones and give it a form, an order, similar to that of an ordinary house in accordance 
with  his  childish  desires  and  tack  on  a  few  beads  pleasing  to  his  juvenile  view,  and 
then say, “Look! I  have  greater skill and wealth and more precious adornments than 
the builder of the palace,” in comparison, it would be the art of a crazy, raving forger. 

THIRD LIGHT 

The Third Light consists of three Gleams. 
FIRST  GLEAM: 

  An 

important  aspect  of  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous 
Expositions’s  miraculousness  was  explained  in  the  Thirteenth  Word.  It  has  been 
included  here  so  that  it  might  take  its  place  among  the  other  aspects  of 
miraculousness,  its brothers. It is as  follows:  if  you want to see and appreciate  how, 
like shining stars, all the Qur’an’s verses scatter the darkness of unbelief by spreading 
the  light  of  miraculousness  and  guidance,  imagine  yourself  in  the  age  of  ignorance 
and  desert  of  savagery  where  everything  was  enveloped  in  lifeless  veils  of  nature, 
under the  darkness of  ignorance  and  heedlessness.  Then  suddenly  from  the  elevated 
tongue of the Qur’an, you hear verses like: 

Whatever is in the heavens extols and glorifies God, for He is the Mighty, the 
Wise.153 * Whatever is in the heavens and earth extols and glorifies God, the 
Sovereign, the Most Holy One, the Mighty, the Wise.154 

See how those dead or sleeping creatures of the  world spring to life at the sound of 
extols and  glorifies  in  the  minds of  those listening,  how  they  awake, spring  up,  and 
mention God’s Names! And at the sound of, 

The  seven  heavens  and  the  earth  and  all  within  them  extol  and  glorify 
Him,155 

                                                 
153 Qur’an, 57:1; 59:1; 61:1. 
154 Qur’an, 62:1. 
155 Qur’an, 17:44. 

 

448

the stars in those black skies, each a lifeless piece of fire, and the wretched creatures 
on the face of the earth present the following view to those listening: the sky appears 
as  a  mouth  and  the  stars  as  wisdom-displaying  words  and  truth-uttering  lights.  The 
earth  appears  as  a  head,  the  land  and  sea  as  tongues,  and  all  animals  and  plants  as 
words of glorification. Otherwise you will not appreciate the subtleties of the pleasure 
at looking from this time to that. For if you look at each verse as having scattered its 
light since that time, and having become like universally accepted knowledge with the 
passage  of  time, and  as shining  with  the  other  lights  of  Islam,  and  taking  its  colour 
from the sun of the Qur’an, or if you look at it through a superficial and simple veil of 
familiarity,  you  will  not  truly  see  what  sort  of  darkness  each  verse  scatters  or  how 
sweet  is the recital of  its miraculousness, and  you will  not appreciate this  sort of its 
miraculousness among its many sorts. If you want to see one of the highest degrees of 
the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition’s  miraculousness,  listen  to  the  following 
comparison: 

Let  us  imagine  an  extremely  strange  and  vast  and  spreading  tree  which  is 
concealed beneath a veil of the unseen and hidden in a level of concealment. It is clear 
that  there  has  to  be  a  relationship,  harmony,  and  balance  between  a  tree  and  all  its 
members  like  its  branches,  fruits,  leaves,  and  blossom,  the  same  as  between  man’s 
members. Each of its parts takes on a  form and is given a shape  in accordance with 
the  nature of  the  tree.  So if  someone  appears  and  traces  a  picture on  top of  the  veil 
corresponding  to  the  members of  the  tree,  which  has  never been  seen,  then  delimits 
each member, and from the branches to the fruit, and the  fruit to the leaves draws a 
form proportionately, and fills the space between its source and extremities, which are 
an  infinite  distance  from one  another,  with  drawings  showing  exactly  the  shape  and 
form of its members, certainly no doubt will remain that the artist sees the concealed 
tree with an eye that penetrates and encompasses the unseen, then he depicts it. 

In just the same way, the discriminating statements of the Qur’an of Miraculous 
Exposition concerning the reality of contingent beings (that is, concerning the reality 
of the tree of creation which stretches from the beginning of the world to the farthest 
limits  of  the  hereafter,  and  spreads  from  the  earth  to  the  Divine  Throne  and  from 
minute  particles  to  the  sun)  have  preserved  the  proportion  between  the  members  to 
such  a  degree  and  have  given  each  member  and  fruit  a  form  so  suitable  that  at  the 
depictions of the Qur’an, all exacting scholars have declared at the conclusion of their 
investigations: “What wonders God has willed! How great are God’s blessings!” They 
have  said:  “It  is  only  you  who  solves  and unravels  the  talisman  of  the  universe  and 
riddle of creation, Oh All-Wise Qur’an!”  

 

449

And God’s is the highest similitude156 – and there is no error in the comparison – 
let  us  represent  the  Divine  Names and  attributes,  and  dominical  acts  and deeds  as  a 
Tuba-tree of light, the sphere of whose  grandeur stretches  from pre-eternity to post-
eternity,  and  the  limits  of  whose  vastness  spread through  infinite,  endless  space  and 
encompass it, and the limits of whose deeds stretch from,  

It  is  God  Who  splits  the  seed-grain and date-stone,157  and,  Comes between 
man and his heart,158 

to,  

Who created the heavens and the earth in six days,159 and, And the heavens 
rolled up in His right hand.160 

The All-Wise Qur’an  has described that  luminous reality, the truths of those Names 
and attributes, and acts and deeds, together with all their branches and twigs and aims 
and fruits, in a way so harmonious, so fitting for one another, so appropriate for one 
another,  without marring  one  another  or  spoiling  the  decree  of  one  another,  or their 
being remote from one another, that all the people of illumination and those who have 
penetrated  to  the  realities,  and  all  the  wise  and  the  sage  who  have  journeyed  in the 
realm of the inner dimension of things, have declared: “Glory be to God!” in the face 
of  that  Discriminating  Exposition,  and  have  affirmed  it,  saying:  “How  right,  how 
conformable with reality, how fine, how worthy!” 

Take, for example, the six pillars of belief, which are like a single branch of those 
two  mighty  trees  which  look  to  the  entire  sphere  of  contingency  and  sphere  of 
necessity: it depicts all the branches and boughs of those pillars –as far as the furthest 
fruits  and  flowers–  observing  such  a  harmony  and  proportion  between  them,  and 
describes  them  in  a manner  so  balanced,  and  illustrates  them  a  way  so  symmetrical 
that  the  human  mind  is  powerless  to perceive  it  and  stands  astonished  at  its beauty. 
And the proof that a beauty of proportion and perfect relation and complete balance 
have been preserved between the five pillars of Islam, which are like one twig of the 
branch of belief, down to the finest details, smallest point of conduct, furthest aims, 
most profound wisdom, and most insignificant fruits, is the perfect order and balance 
and  beauty  of  proportion  and  soundness  of  the  Greater  Shari’a  of  Islam,  which  has 
emerged  from  the  decisive  statements,  senses,  indications,  and  allusions  of  the 
comprehensive  Qur’an;  they  form  an  irrefutable  and  decisive  proof and  just  witness 
that cannot be doubted. This means that

the  expositions  of  the  Qur’an  cannot  be  attributed  to  man’s  partial  knowledge,  and 
particularly  to  the  knowledge  of  someone  unlettered.  They  rest  rather  on  a 
comprehensive  knowledge  and  are  the  word  of  One  Who  is  able  to  see  all  things 
together and observe in one moment all truths between pre-eternity and post-eternity. 
In this we believe. 

SECOND GLEAM:  Since just how far the human philosophy which challenges 
Qur’anic  wisdom  has  fallen  in  the  face  of  that  wisdom  has  been  explained  and 
illustrated with comparisons in the Twelfth Word and proved in the other Words, we 
refer  readers  to  those  treatises and  for  now  offer  a  further  comparison  from  another 
point of view. It is as follows: 

Human science and philosophy look at the world as fixed and constant. And they 
discuss the nature of beings and their characteristics in detail; if they do speak of their 
duties before their Maker, they speak of them briefly. Quite simply, they speak only 
of the decoration and letters of the book of the universe, and attach no importance to 
its meaning. Whereas the Qur’an  looks at the world as transient, passing, deceptive, 
travelling,  unstable,  and  undergoing  revolution.  It  speaks  briefly  of  the  nature  of 
beings  and  their  superficial  and  material  characteristics,  but  mentions  in  detail  the 
worshipful  duties  with  which  they  are  charged  by  the  Maker,  and  how and  in  what 
respects  they  point  to  His  Names,  and  their  obedience  before  the  Divine  creational 
commands. We shall therefore look at the differences between human philosophy and 
Qur’anic  wisdom  in  regard  to  this  matter  of  looking  at  things  either  briefly  or  in 
detail, and shall see which is pure truth and reality. 

A watch in our hand appears to be constant, but its inside is in perpetual upheaval 
through  the  motion  of  the  workings  and  the  constant  anguish  of  the  cogwheels  and 
parts. In just the same way, together with its apparent stability, this world, which is a 
huge  clock  of  Divine  power,  is  perpetually  revolving  within  upheaval  and  change, 
transience and evanescence.  Indeed, since time  has entered the world, night and day 
are like a two-headed hand counting the seconds of that huge clock. The years are like 
a hand counting its minutes, while the centuries count its hours. Thus, time casts the 
world onto  the  waves  of  death  and  decline.  It  assigns  all  the  past  and  the  future  to 
non-existence, leaving in existence only the present.  

Together with this form which time gives the world, with regard to space also it is 
like  an  unstable  clock  undergoing  revolution.  For since  the  space  of  the  atmosphere 
changes swiftly and quickly passes from one state to another through being filled and 
emptied  with  clouds  sometimes  several  times  a  day,  it  causes  change  like  a  hand 
counting the seconds. And the space of the earth, which is like the floor of the house 
of the world, since with life and death and  

 

451

the animals and plants its face changes very rapidly, like a minute-hand it shows that 
this aspect of the world also is transient. And just as the earth is like this in regard to 
its  face,  so  through  the  revolutions  and  upheavals  within  it,  and  the  mountains 
emerging as a result and disappearing, this aspect of the world is slowly passing also, 
like an hour-hand. And through change like the movements of the celestial bodies, the 
appearance of comets, the occurrence of solar and lunar eclipses, and falling stars, the 
space of the  heavens too, which  is  like the  ceiling of the  house of the world, shows 
that the heavens also are not stable and constant, but are progressing towards old age 
and destruction. Their change is slow and tardy  like the  hand counting the days  in a 
weekly clock, but in every respect it demonstrates that it is transient and passing and 
heading for destruction. 

Thus,  the  world,  in  regard  to  the  world,  has  been  constructed  on  these  seven 
pillars. These pillars perpetually shake it. But when the world which is thus in motion 
and being shaken looks to its Maker, the motion and change is the working of the pen 
of  power  writing  the  missives  of  the  Eternally  Besought  One.  And  those  changing 
states are the mirrors of the Divine Names, which, being constantly renewed, display 
with ever-differing depictions the manifestation of the Names’ qualities.  

And so, in respect of the world, the world is both transient and hastens towards 
death,  and  is  undergoing  revolution.  Although  in  reality  it  is  departing  like  flowing 
water,  to  the  heedless  eye  it  appears  to  be  frozen;  due  to  the  idea  of  nature,  it  has 
become dense and turbid, and become a veil concealing the hereafter. Thus, through 
philosophical  investigation  and  natural  science,  and  the  seductive  amusements  of 
dissolute civilization and its intoxicated passions, sick philosophy has both increased 
the world’s frozen state and inaction, and made denser heedlessness, and increased its 
opaqueness  and  turbidity,  and  caused  the  Maker  and  the  hereafter  to  be  forgotten. 
Whereas, with its verses, 

By  the  Mount  [of  Revelation]. *  By a  Book  inscribed.161  *  When  the Event 
Inevitable  comes  to pass.162  *  The [Day of]  Noise  and  Clamour,  *  What  is 
[the Day of] Noise and Clamour?,163 

the  Qur’an  cards  the  world  in  regard  to  the  world  like  cotton,  and  casts  it  away. 
Through its expositions like, 

Do they see nothing in the government of the heavens and the earth?164 * Do 
they not look at the sky above them? - How We have made it.165 *  

                                                 

161 Qur’an, 52:1-2. 
162 Qur’an, 56:1. 
163 Qur’an, 101:1. 
164 Qur’an, 7:185. 
165 Qur’an, 50:6. 

 

452

Do  the  unbelievers  not  see  that  the  heavens  and  the  earth  were  joined 
together, before We clove them asunder?,166 

it  gives  the  world  a  transparency  and  removes  its  turbidity.  Through  its  light-
scattering illuminations like, 

God  is  the  Light  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth.167  *  What  is  the  life  of  this 
world but play and amusement?,168  

it melts the frozen, inactive world. Through its death-tainted expressions like, 

When the sun is folded up.169 * When the sky is cleft asunder.170 * When the 
sky is rent asunder.171 * And the trumpet will be sounded, and all that are in 
the heavens and all  that  are  on  earth  will  fall  down  senseless,  except  such 
that it pleases God [to exempt],172 

it smashes the delusion that the world is eternal. Through its thunderous blasts, like,  

He knows what enters within the earth and what comes forth out of it, what 
comes down from the skies and what mounts up to them. And He is with you 
wheresoever you may be. And God sees all that you do.173 * And say: Praise 
be to God, Who will show you His signs, so that you shall know them. And 
your Sustainer is not unmindful of all that you do,174 

it scatters the heedlessness born of the notion of ‘nature’. 

Thus,  from  beginning  to  end  the  Qur’an’s  verses  which  are  turned  towards  the 
universe proceed according to this principle. They reveal and display the reality of the 
world as it is. Through showing  just how ugly the ugly world is, it turns man’s face 
from it, and points out the beautiful world’s beautiful face, which looks to the Maker. 
It fastens man’s eye on that. It instructs in true wisdom and knowledge, teaching the 
meanings  of  the  book  of  the  universe,  and  looking  infrequently  at  the  letters  and 
decorations.  It  does not  cause  the  meaning  to  be forgotten  like  drunken  philosophy, 
nor make man enamoured of the ugly and waste his time on meaningless things due to 
the decoration of the letters.

THIRD  GLEAM:    In  the  Second  Gleam  we  pointed  to  the  fall  of  human 
philosophy  before Qur’anic  wisdom  and  to  the  miraculousness  of  Qur’anic  wisdom. 
Now,  in  this  Gleam,  we  shall  show  the  degree  of  the  wisdom  and  science  –  before 
Qur’anic  wisdom  –  of  the  purified  scholars,  the  saints,  and  the  enlightened  among 
philosophers, the  Ishraqiyyun,  who  are  all students  of  the  Qur’an,  and  shall  make  a 
brief indication to the Qur’an’s miraculousness in this respect. 

A most true indication of the All-Wise Qur’an’s sublimity, and a most clear proof 
of  its  truth  and  justice,  and  a  most  powerful  sign  of  its  miraculousness  is  this: 
preserving  all  the  degrees  of  all  the  areas  of  Divine  unity  together  with  all  their 
necessities, and expounding them, it has preserved their balance and not spoilt it; and 
it  has  preserved  the  balance  of  all  the  exalted  Divine  truths;  and  it  has  brought 
together all the ordinances dictated by the Divine Names and preserved their mutual 
proportion;  and  it  has  brought  together  the  dominical  and  Divine  acts  with  perfect 
balance.  Thus,  this  preserving  and  balance  and  bringing  together  is  a  characteristic 
which is certainly not present in man’s works nor in the products of the thought of the 
eminent  among  mankind.  It  is  to  be  found  nowhere  in  the  works  of  the  saints  who 
have  penetrated  to  the  inner  face  of  beings,  which  looks  to  their  Creator,  nor  in the 
books of the Ishraqiyyun, who have passed to the inward, hidden meaning of things, 
nor in the  knowledge of the spiritual who have penetrated the World of the Unseen. 
As though they  have practised a division of labour, it  is  as  if  each  group adheres to 
only one or two branches of the mighty tree of reality; each busies itself with only its 
fruit  or  its  leaves.  They  either  know  nothing  of  the  others,  or  else  do  not  concern 
themselves with them. 

Absolute  reality  cannot  be  comprehended by  restricted  views.  A  universal  view 
like the Qur’an is necessary in order to comprehend it. For sure they are instructed by 
the Qur’an, but with a particular mind they can only see completely one or two sides 
of universal  reality,  are  preoccupied  with  them,  and  imprisoned  in  them.  They  spoil 
the balance of reality through either excess or negligence and mar its proportion and 
harmony. This truth was explained with an unusual comparison in the Second Branch 
of  the  Twenty-Fourth  Word,  and  now  we  shall  point  to  the  matter  with  another 
comparison. 

For  example,  let  us  suppose  there  is  some  treasure  under  the  sea,  full  of 
innumerable jewels of various kinds. Divers are plunging the depths to search for the 
jewels  of  the  treasure.  Since  their  eyes  are  closed,  they  understand  what  is  there 
through the dexterous use of their hands. A longish diamond comes into the hand of 
one of them. The diver assumes that the whole treasure consists of a long, pillar-like 
diamond. When he hears of other jewels from his companions, he imagines that they 
are subsidiary to the diamond he  

 

454

has found, and are facets and embellishments of it. Into the hand of another passes a 
round  ruby,  while  another  finds  a  square  piece  of  amber,  and  so  on,  each  of  them 
believes that the jewel he sees with his hand is the essential, major part of the treasure, 
and supposes that the things about which he hears are additional parts and details of it. 
So  then  the  balance  of  the  truths  is  spoilt,  and  the  mutual  proportion  too  is  marred. 
The colour of many truths changes, and in order to see the true colour of reality they 
are  obliged  to  resort  to  forced  interpretation  and  elaborate  explanations.  Sometimes 
even  they  go  as  far  as  denial  and  rejection.  Anyone  who  studies  the  books  of  the 
Ishraqiyyun philosophers and the works of sufis who rely on illuminations and visions 
without  weighing  them  on  the  scales  of  the  Sunna  will  doubtless  confirm  this 
statement of ours. That is to say, although their works concern truths similar to those 
of  the  Qur’an  and  are  taken  from  the  Qur’an’s  teachings,  because  they  are  not  the 
Qur’an, they are defective in that way. The Qur’an’s verses also, which are oceans of 
truths,  are  divers  for  that  treasure  under  the  sea.  But  their  eyes  are  open  and 
encompass the treasure. They see what there is in the treasure and what there is not. 
They  describe  and  expound  it  with  such  harmony,  order,  and  proportion  that  they 
show  the  true  beauty  and  fineness.  For  example,  just  as  they  see  the  vastness  of 
dominicality expressed by the verses, 

And the whole of the earth will be but His handful, and the heavens will be 
rolled up in His hand.175 * The Day that We roll up the heavens like a scroll 
rolled up for books [completed],176 

so too they see the all-encompassing mercy expressed by these:  

God, there is nothing hidden from Him on the earth or in the heavens * He it 
is Who shapes you in the wombs as He pleases.177 * There is not a moving 
creature, but He has grasp of its forelock.178 * How many are the creatures 
that  carry  not  their  own  sustenance?  It  is  God  who  feeds  [both]  them  and 
you.179  

And just as they see and point out the vast extent of the creativity expressed by, 

Who  created  the  heavens  and  the  earth  and  made  the  darkness  and  the 
light,180 

so too they see and show the comprehensive disposal and encompassing dominicality 
expressed by, 

But God has created you and what you do.181

177 Qur’an, 3:5-6. 
178 Qur’an, 11:56. 
179 Qur’an, 29:60. 
180 Qur’an, 6:1. 
181 Qur’an, 37:96. 

 

455

They see and point out the mighty truth expressed by, 

He gives life to the earth after its death,182 

and the magnanimous truth expressed by, 

And your Sustainer inspired the bee,183 

and the sovereign and commanding vast truth expressed by, 

The sun and the moon and the stars subjugated to His command.184 

They see and show the compassionate, regulating truth expressed by, 

Do they not observe the birds above them, spreading their wings and folding 
them in? None can uphold them except the Most Merciful; indeed He sees all 
things,185 

and the vast truth expressed by, 

His Throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue 
in preserving them,186 

and the guarding truth expressed by, 

And He is with you wherever you may be,187 

and the all-encompassing truth expressed by, 

He  is  the  First  and  the  Last  and  the  Outward  and  the  Inward,  and  He  is 
Knowing of All Things,188 

and the proximity expressed by, 

It  was  We  Who  created  man, and  We  know  what  dark  suggestions  his  soul 
makes to him; for We are nearer to him than his jugular vein,189 

and the elevated truth indicated by, 

The  angels  ascend  to  Him  in  a  day  the  measure  of  which  is  fifty  thousand 
years,190  

and the all-embracing truth expressed by, 

God commands justice, the doing of good, and liberality to kith and kin, and 
He forbids all shameful deeds, and injustice and rebellion.191 

The Qur’an’s verses see and show in detail each of the six pillars of belief in

191 Qur’an, 16:90. 

 

456

respect  of  this  world  and  the  hereafter,  action  and  knowledge.  They  see  and  show 
intentionally  and  seriously  each  of  the  five  pillars  of  Islam,  and  all  the  principles 
which  ensure  happiness  in  this  world  and  the  next.  They  preserve  their  balance, 
perpetuate  their  proportion,  and  a  form  of  the  Qur’an’s  miraculousness  comes  into 
being  from  the  source  of  the  beauty  which  is  born  of  the  mutual  proportion  of  the 
entirety of those truths. 

It is due to this great mystery that although the scholars of theology (kala\m) are 
students of the Qur’an and one section of them has written thousands of works of ten 
volumes each on the pillars of belief, because like the Mu’tazilites they preferred the 
reason to revelation, they have not been able to express with clarity so many as ten of 
the  Qur’an’s  verses,  or  prove  them  decisively,  or  convince  persuasively  concerning 
them.  It  is  quite  simply  as  though  they  have  dug  tunnels  under  distant  mountains, 
taken  pipes  with  the  chains  of  causes  to  the  ends  of  the  world,  there  cut  the  chains, 
and  then  demonstrated  knowledge  of  God  and  the  existence  of  the  Necessarily 
Existent One, which are like the water of life. The Qur’an’s verses, however, can all 
extract  water  from  every  place  like  the  Staff  of  Moses,  open  up  a  window  from 
everything,  and  make  known  the  All-Glorious  Maker.  We  have  actually proved  and 
demonstrated this fact in the Arabic treatise Katre, and in the other Words, which flow 
forth from the ocean of the Qur’an. 

It is also due to this mystery that since all the leaders of the heretical groups who 
have passed to the  inward nature of things (batin), who, not following the Sunna of 
the Prophet (PBUH) but relying on their visions, have returned having gone half way, 
and  becoming  leaders  of  a  community  have  founded  sects,  have  been  unable  to 
preserve  the  proportion  and  balance  of  the  Qur’anic  truths,  they  have  fallen  into 
innovation and misguidance and driven a community of people down the wrong road. 
Thus,  the  complete  impotence  of  all  these  demonstrates  the  miraculousness  of  the 
Qur’an’s verses.

Conclusion 

Two flashes of the Qur’an’s miraculousness mentioned in the Fourteenth Drop of 
the  Nineteenth  Word  are  its  repetitions,  which  are  imagined  to  be  a  fault,  and  its 
brevity  concerning  the  physical  sciences,  both  of  which  are  sources  for  flashes  of 
miraculousness.  Also,  a  flash  of  the  Qur’an’s  miraculousness  which  shines  on  the 
miracles of the prophets in the Qur’an is demonstrated clearly in the Second Station of 
the  Twentieth  Word.  Similarly  to  these,  numerous  flashes  of  miraculousness  have 
been  mentioned  in  the  other  Words and  in  my  Arabic treatises.  Therefore,  deeming 
those to be sufficient, here we shall only say this, that a further miracle of the Qur’an 
is  that  just  as  all  the  miracles  of  the  prophets  display  an  impress  of  the  Qur’an’s 
miraculousness, so with all its miracles, the Qur’an is itself a miracle of the Prophet 
Muhammad (PBUH). And all the miracles of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) are a 
miracle  of  the  Qur’an  which  demonstrate its  relation  with  Almighty  God.  And  with 
the appearance of that relation all of its words become miracles. For then a single of 
its  words  may  contain  the  meaning  of  a  tree  of  truths,  like  a  seed;  and  may  be 
connected  with  all  the  members  of  a  mighty  truth,  like  the  centre  of  the  heart;  and 
since  its  relies  on  an  all-encompassing  knowledge  and  infinite  will,  it  may  look  to 
innumerable things together with their letters, totalities, situations, and positions. It is 
because of this that the scholars of the science of letters claim that they have found a 
pageful of secrets in a single of the Qur’an’s letters, and they prove what they claim to 
adepts of that science. 

Now,  gather  together  in  your  mind’s  eye  all  the  Lights,  Rays,  Flashes,  Beams, 
and Gleams from the start of this treatise up to here and consider them all together! As 
a decisive conclusion, they recite and proclaim in resounding tones the claim made at 
the beginning, that is, 

Say: If all mankind and the Jinn were to gather together to produce the like 
of this Qur’an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they backed up 
each other with help and support.192

Glory be unto You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught 
us; indeed, You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.193 
O our Sustainer! Do not call us to task if we forget or do wrong.194 * O my 
Sustainer! Expand for me my breast, * And make easy for me my task, * And 
remove the impediment from my speech, * So that they may understand what 
I say.195 

O  God! Grant  blessings  to  our  master  Muhammad  that  will  be  pleasing  to 
You and  will  be  fulfilment  to his  truth, and to his  Family, his  Companions, 
and his brothers, and grant them peace. 

O  our  Sustainer!  Let  not  our  hearts  deviate  after  you  have  guided  us,  and 
grant  us  mercy  from  Your  Presence,  for  You  are  the  Granter  of  bounties 
without measure.196 * And the close of their prayer will be, All praise be to 
God, the Sustainer of All the Worlds.197   Amen. Amen. Amen.

First Addendum 

 [Of  the  Addenda  added  to  the  Twenty-Fifth  Word,  this  First  Addendum 
consists of the Seventeenth Degree of the First Station of the Seventh Ray, 
The Supreme Sign, on account of its station.] 

Knowing the aim of life in this world, and the life of life, to be belief, the tireless 
and  insatiable  traveller  through  the  world  who  was  questioning  the  universe 
concerning  his  Sustainer  then  said  to  himself:  “Let  us  refer  to  the  book  called  the 
Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, which is known as the word and speech of the One 
we  are  seeking,  and  is  the  most  famous,  brilliant,  dominant  book  in  the  world, 
challenging  everyone  in  every  century  who  does not  submit  to  it.  But  first  we  must 
prove that it is the book of our Creator.” And he started to search. 

Since  the  traveller  lived  at  this  time,  he  looked  first  at  the  Risale-i  Nur,  which 
consists of flashes of the Qur’an’s miraculousness, and saw that its one hundred and 
thirty parts are fine points and lights of the verses of that Distinguisher between Truth 
and  Falsehood,  and  authentic  explanations  of  them.  Although  through  striving  and 
endeavour  the  Risale-i  Nur  has  spread  the  Qur’anic  truths  everywhere  in  an  age  as 
obstinate and atheistic as this, the fact that no one has opposed it successfully proves 
that  the  Qur’an,  which  is  its  master,  source,  authority,  and  sun,  is  heavenly  and 
revealed, and  not man’s word. Only one proof of the Qur’an out of the  hundreds of 
the Risale-i Nur, the Twenty-Fifth Word together with the last part of the Nineteenth 
Letter,  has  proved  so  decisively  that  the  Qur’an  is  miraculous  in  forty  aspects  that 
everyone who has seen them, rather than criticizing or objecting to them, has been full 
of wonder at their proofs, appreciating and praising them. So referring it to the Risale-
i  Nur  to prove  the  Qur’an’s  miraculous  aspects  and  its being  the  Word of  God,  the 
traveller only noted with brief indications several points demonstrating its greatness.  

First Point:  Just as with all its miracles and all its truths, which are an indication 
of its  veracity, the Qur’an is a miracle of Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon 
him),  so  too  with  all  his  miracles  and  the  evidences  of  his  prophethood  and 
perfections of his knowledge, Muhammad (PBUH) is a miracle of the Qur’an, and a 
decisive proof that it is the Word of God. 

 

460

Second Point: The Qur’an caused a transformation in social life in this world in 
so  luminous,  happy,  and  truthful  a  fashion,  and  brought  about  such  a  revolution  in 
both men’s souls, and hearts, and spirits, and minds, and in their personal lives, social 
lives, and political lives, and continued and directed that revolution, that every minute 
for  fourteen  centuries  its  six  thousand  six  hundred  and  sixty-six  verses  have  been 
recited with deep reverence by the tongues of at least one hundred million men, and it 
has trained men, purified their souls and cleansed their hearts, and has caused spirits 
to unfold and progress, given direction and light to minds, and vitality and happiness 
to life. For sure, such a book has no like; it is a wonder, a marvel, a miracle. 

Third Point:  The eloquence the Qur’an has demonstrated from that age till now 
is illustrated by the following: it caused Labid’s daughter to remove from the walls of 
the  Ka’ba  the  famous  verses  written  in  gold  of  the most celebrated poets  called  the 
Seven  Hanging  Poems,  and  to  declare  while  doing  so:  “Beside  the  verses  of  the 
Qur’an these no longer have any value!” 

Also, when a bedouin poet heard the verse,  

Therefore expound openly what you are commanded 1 

being recited, he bowed down in prostration. When asked if he had become a Muslim, 
he replied: “No, I was prostrating before the eloquence of this verse.” 

Also, thousands of brilliant scholars and learned literary figures like the geniuses 
of  the  science  of  rhetoric,  ‘Abd  al-Qahir  Jurjani,  Sakkaki,  and  Zamakhshari,  all 
reached  the  conclusion  that,  “The  Qur’an’s  eloquence  is  beyond  man’s  power,  he 
could not achieve it.” 

Also,  although  from  that  time  it  has  continuously  issued  a  challenge  provoking 
conceited  and  egotistical  orators  and  poets,  proclaiming  in  a  way  which  will  sting 
their pride: “Produce the like of one single Sura or be resigned to ignominy and ruin 
in  this  world  and  the  next!”,  the  obdurate  orators  of  that  time  gave  up  disputing  it 
verbally, the  short way of producing the  like of  one Sura, and chose the way of the 
war, which was lengthy and threw their lives and property into peril, thus proving that 
it was not possible to take the short way.  

Also,  millions  of  Arabic  books  are  in  circulation,  written  since  that  time by the 
Qur’an’s  friends  through  the  desire  to  resemble  and  imitate  it,  and  by  its  enemies, 
driven to combat and criticize it, and such works are being written and have improved 
through  the  meeting  of  minds  and  ideas,  but  if  even  the  most  common  man  should 
listen  to  them,  he  would  declare  that  none  of  them  have  reached  it,  saying:  “The 
Qur’an does not resemble these and is not of their level. It is either lower than all of 
them or higher. No one in the world, no unbeliever, nor an idiot even, can say that it is 
lower, which means  

                                                 

1 Qur’an, 15:94. 

 

461

that the degree of its eloquence is above all of them.”  

One time, a man recited the verse, 

All that is in the heavens and the earth extols and glorifies God,2 

and said: “I can’t see the eloquence in this, although it is considered wonderful.” So it 
was said to him, “You return to that time like the traveller, and then listen to it.” So 
imagining  himself to be there before the Qur’an  was revealed, he  saw the beings of 
the world to be lifeless, without consciousness and duties, wretched and obscure in an 
unstable, transitory world in the middle of limitless, empty space. Suddenly, listening 
to this verse from the tongue of the Qur’an, he saw that it drew back a veil from the 
universe  and  face  of  the  world,  illuminating  it.  He  saw  that  this  pre-eternal  address 
and eternal decree instructs the conscious beings  lined up in the centuries, revealing 
the universe to be like a huge mosque, and foremost the heavens and the earth, and all 
beings, to be employed in the glorification and remembrance of God, enthusiastically 
performing  their  duties  with  joy  and  eagerness.  He  appreciated  the  degree  of 
eloquence  of  this  verse,  and  comparing  the  others  to  it,  understood  one  of  the 
thousands  of  instances  of  wisdom  in  the  recitation  of  the  Qur’an’s  eloquence 
overspreading  half  the  earth  and  a  fifth  of  mankind,  and,  being  held  in  utter 
veneration, perpetuating its sublime sovereignty for fourteen centuries without break. 

Fourth  Point: The  Qur’an  displays an  agreeableness  so  true  that  for  those  who 
recite  it, its many repetitions, which are the cause of even the sweetest things being 
wearied  of,  do  not  cause  weariness,  rather  for  those  whose  hearts  are  not  corrupted 
and  taste  spoilt,  the repetitions  increase  its  agreeableness. Since  early  times  this  has 
been accepted by everyone and become proverbial. Furthermore, it demonstrates such 
a freshness, youth, and originality that although it has lived for fourteen centuries and 
has been freely available to everyone, it has preserved its freshness as though newly 
revealed.  Each  century  has  seen  it  to  be  young  as  though  it  was  addressing  that 
century  in  particular.  And  although  in  order  to  benefit  from  it  all  the  time,  all  the 
branches of scholars have always had copies of it present with them in large numbers 
and have followed and emulated its style and manner of expression, it has preserved 
the originality in its style and manner of exposition exactly. 

Fifth Point:  One wing of the Qur’an is in the past, and one is in the future, and 
just  as  its  root  and  one  wing  are  the  agreed  truths  of  the  former  prophets,  and  it 
confirms and corroborates them, and they too confirm it with the tongue of unanimity, 
so  too  all  the  true  sufi  paths  and  ways  of  sainthood  whose  fruits,  the  saints  and 
purified scholars, who receive life from the  

                                                 

2 Qur’an, 57:1, etc. 

 

462

Qur’an,  show  through  their  vital  spiritual  progress  that  their  blessed  tree  is  living, 
effulgent,  and  the  means  to  truth.  They  grow  and  live  under  the  protection  of  its 
second wing, and testify that the Qur’an is pure truth and the assembly of truths and in 
its comprehensiveness, is a matchless wonder. 

Sixth Point: The Qur’an’s truthfulness and veracity show that its six aspects are 
luminous.  Indeed,  the  pillars  of  argument  and  proof  beneath  it;  the  flashes  of  the 
stamp  of  miraculousness  above  it;  the  gifts  of  happiness  in  this  world  and  the  next 
before it, its goal; the truths of heavenly revelation, its point of support behind it; the 
assent  and  evidence  of  innumerable  upright  minds  to  its  right;  and  the  true 
tranquillity, sincere attraction, and submission of sound hearts and clean consciences 
on its  left all prove that the  Qur’an is a  wondrous, firm, unassailable citadel of both 
the heavens and the earth.  

Similarly,  the  universe’s  Disposer,  Who  has  made  it  His  practice  to  foremost 
always exhibit beauty in the universe, protect good and right, and eliminate imposters 
and liars, has set His seal on its being sheer truth and right on six levels, and not being 
man’s word, and its containing no error; and by giving it the most acceptable, highest, 
and most dominant place of respect and degree of success in the world, has confirmed 
and endorsed the Qur’an.   

So  too,  the  one  who  is  the  source  of  Islam  and  interpreter  of  the  Qur’an  –  his 
believing  in  it  and  holding  it  in  greater  respect  than  everyone  else,  and  being  in  a 
sleep-like state when it was revealed, and other words and speeches not resembling or 
coming near it, and that Interpreter’s describing without hesitation and with complete 
confidence through the Qur’an true cosmic events of generally the past and the future 
from  behind  the  veil  of  the  Unseen,  and  no  trickery  or  fault  being  observed  in  him 
while  being  under  the  gazes  of  the  sharpest  eyes,  and  his  believing  and  affirming 
every pronouncement of the Qur’an with all his strength and nothing shaking him, is a 
stamp  confirming  that  the  Qur’an  is  revealed  and  true  and  the  blessed  Word  of  his 
own Compassionate Creator. 

Also, a fifth of mankind, indeed the greater part of it, being drawn to the Qur’an 
and  bound  to  it  in  religion  and  giving  ear  to  it  eagerly  desirous  of  the  truth,  and 
according to the testimony of many indications and events and illuminations, the jinn, 
angels,  and  spirit  beings  also  gathering  around  it  in  truth-worshipping  fashion  like 
moths  whenever  it  is  recited  is  a  stamp  confirming  the  Qur’an’s  acceptance  by  all 
beings and that it occupies an elevated position. 

Also, all the classes of mankind from the most stupid and lowly to the cleverest 
and  most  learned  taking  their  full  share  of  the  Qur’an’s  instruction  and  their 
understanding its profoundest truths, and all branches of scholars  

 

463

like the great interpreters of the Greater Shari’a in particular, and hundreds of Islamic 
sciences  and  branches  of  knowledge,  and  the  brilliant  and  exacting  scholars  of 
theology  and  the  principles  of religion  extracting  from  the  Qur’an  all  the  needs  and 
answers  for  their  own  sciences,  –  this  is  a  stamp  confirming  that  the  Qur’an  is  a 
source of truth and mine of reality. 

Also, although the Arab literary figures, who were the most advanced in regard to 
literature, – those of them who were not Muslims – had the greatest  need to dispute 
the Qur’an, their avoiding producing the like of only a single Sura and its eloquence, 
eloquence  being  only  one  aspect  of  the  seven  major  aspects  of  the  Qur’an’s 
miraculousness, as well as the famous orators and brilliant scholars up to the present 
who  have  wanted  to gain  fame  through  disputing  it  being  unable  to oppose  a  single 
aspect of its miraculousness and their remaining silent in impotence, – this is a stamp 
confirming that the Qur’an is a miracle and beyond the powers of man.  

Yes,  the  value,  superiority,  and  eloquence  of  a  speech  or  word  is  apparent 
through knowing, “from whom it has come and to whom, and for what purpose;” the 
Qur’an then can have no like, and none can reach it. For the Qur’an is the speech and 
address  of  the  Sustainer  of  all  the  worlds  and  Creator  of  the  whole  universe  and  a 
dialogue in no way hinting of imitation and artificiality. It is addressed to the one sent 
in  the  name  of  all  men,  indeed  of  all  beings,  the  most  famous  and  renowned  of 
mankind,  the  strength  and  breadth  of  whose  belief  gave  rise  to  mighty  Islam  and 
raised its owner to the level of ‘the distance of two bow-strings’ and returned him as 
the  addressee  of  the  Eternally  Besought  One.  It  describes  and  explains  the  matters 
concerning  happiness  in  this  world  and  the  next,  the  results  of  the  creation  of  the 
universe, and the dominical purposes within it. It expounds also the belief of the one it 
addresses, which was the highest and most extensive, and bore all the truths of Islam. 
It turns and shows every side of the huge universe like a map, a clock, or a house, and 
teaches and describes it in the manner of the Craftsman Who made them – to produce 
the  like  of  this  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  is  not  possible;  the  degree  of  its 
miraculousness cannot be attained to. 

Also,  thousands  of  precise  and  learned  scholars  of  high  intelligence  have  all 
written  commentaries  expounding  the  Qur’an,  some  of  which are  of  thirty,  forty,  or 
even  seventy  volumes,  showing  and  proving  through  evidence  and  argument  the 
innumerable  qualities,  fine  points,  characteristics,  mysteries,  elevated  meanings,  and 
numerous  indications  concerning  every  sort  of  hidden  and  unseen  matter  in  the 
Qur’an. And the one hundred and thirty parts of the Risale-i Nur in particular, each of 
which proves with decisive arguments one quality, one fine point of the Qur’an, – all 
its  parts,  such  as  the  Miraculousness  of  the  Qur’an,  and  the  Second  Station  of  the 
Twentieth  Word,  which  deduces  many  things  from  the  Qur’an  concerning  the 
wonders of civilization  

 

464

like  the  railway  and  the  aeroplane,  and  the  First  Ray,  called  Signs  of  the  Qur’an, 
which  divulges  allusions  of  verses  to  the  Risale-i  Nur  and  electricity,  and  the  eight 
short treatises called The Eight Signs, which show how well-ordered, full of meaning, 
and  mysterious  are  the  words  of  the  Qur’an,  and  the  small  treatise  proving  in  five 
aspects the miraculousness of the verses at the end of Sura al-Fath in regard to their 
giving news of the Unseen – each part of the Risale-i Nur shows one truth, one light 
of  the  Qur’an.  All  this  forms  a  stamp  confirming  that  the  Qur’an  has  no  like,  is  a 
miracle  and  a  marvel,  and  that  it  is  the  tongue  of  the  World  of  the  Unseen  in  the 
Manifest World and the Word of One All-Knowing of the Unseen. 

Thus, due to these qualities and characteristics of the Qur’an indicated above in 
six  points,  six  aspects,  and  six  levels,  its  sublime,  luminous  sovereignty  and  sacred, 
mighty  rule  have  continued  in  perfect  splendour  illuminating  the  centuries  and  the 
face  of  the  earth  for  one  thousand  three  hundred  years.  Also,  on  account  of  these 
qualities of the Qur’an, each of its letters has gained the sacred distinction of yielding 
at least ten rewards, ten merits, and ten eternal fruits, and the letters of certain verses 
and Suras yielding a hundred or a thousand fruits, or even more, and at blessed times 
the  light,  reward,  and  value of  each  letter  rising  from  ten  to  hundreds.  The  traveller 
through  the  world understood  this  and  said  to  his  heart:  “The Qur’an,  which  is  thus 
miraculous in every respect, through the consensus of its Suras, the agreement of its 
verses,  the  accord  of  its  lights  and  mysteries,  and  the  concurrence  of  its  fruits  and 
works,  so  testifies  with  its  evidences  in  the  form  of  proofs  to  the  existence,  unity, 
attributes,  and  Names  of  a  Single  Necessarily  Existent  One  that  it  is  from  its 
testimony that the endless testimony of all the believers has issued forth.” 

Thus,  in  brief  indication  to  the  instruction  in  belief  and  Divine  unity  that  the 
traveller received from the Qur’an, it was said in the Seventeenth Degree of the First 
Station: 

There is no god but God, the One and Unique Necessary Existent, to Whose 
Necessary  Existence  in  Unity  points  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition, 
the book accepted and desired by all species of angel, men and jinn, whose 
verses  are  read  each  minute  of  the  year,  with  the  utmost  reverence,  by 
hundreds  of  millions of  men,  whose  sacred  sovereignty  over  the  regions  of 
the earth and the universe and the face of time is permanent, whose spiritual 
and luminous authority has run over half the earth and a fifth of humanity, 
for more than fourteen centuries, with the utmost splendour. Testimony and 
proof  is  also  given  by  the unanimity  of  its  sacred  and  heavenly  Suras,  the 
agreement of its luminous, divine verses, the congruence of its mysteries and 
lights,  the  correspondence  of  its  fruits and  effects,  by  witnessing and  clear 
vision.

THE TENTH TOPIC OF THE FRUITS OF BELIEF, 
THE ELEVENTH RAY 
A Flower of Emirdağ 

 [An extremely powerful reply to objections raised against repetition in the 
Qur’an.] 

My Dear and Loyal Brothers! 
Due to my wretched situation, this Matter is confused and graceless. But I knew 
definitely  that  beneath  the  confused  wording  was  a  most  valuable  sort  of 
miraculousness,  though  unfortunately  I  was  incapable  of  expressing  it.  But  however 
dull  the  wording,  since  it  concerns  the  Qur’an,  it  is  both  worship  in  the  form  of 
reflection, and the shell of a sacred, elevated, shining jewel. The diamond in the hand 
should be  looked  at,  not  its  torn  clothes.  Also,  I  wrote  it  in  one  or  two days  during 
Ramadan while extremely ill, wretched, and without food, of necessity very concisely 
and briefly, and including many truths and numerous proofs in a single sentence. Its 
deficiencies, then, should be overlooked!1 

My True and Loyal Brothers! While reading the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition 
in  Ramadan,  whichever  of  the  thirty-three  verses  I  came  to  that  in  the  First  Ray 
describe the allusions to the Risale-i Nur, I saw that the page and story of the  verse 
also  look  to  the  Risale-i  Nur  and  its  Students  to a  degree  –  in  so  far  as  they  have  a 
share of the story. Particularly  the Light  Verses  in Sura al-Nur, just as they point to 
the Risale-i Nur with ten fingers, so the Darkness Verses following it point directly at 
those  opposing  it;  these  afford  a  further  share.  Quite  simply,  I  understood  that  this 
‘station’ rises from particularity to universality and that one part of that universality is 
the Risale-i Nur and its Students.  

Indeed,  in  regard  to  the  breadth,  exaltedness,  and  comprehensiveness  that  the 
Qur’an’s  address  receives  from  firstly  the  extensive  station  of  the  universal 
dominicality of the Pre-Eternal Speaker, and from the extensive station  

                                                 

1 As the Tenth Topic of the fruit of Denizli Prison, it is a small shining flower of Emirdağ and of 

this month of Ramadan. By explaining one instance of wisdom in the repetitions of the Qur’an, it 
dispels the poisonous, putrid illusions of the people of misguidance. 

 

466

of  the  one  addressed  in  the  name  of  mankind,  indeed  of  all  beings,  and  the  most 
extensive station of all mankind’s guidance in all the centuries, and from the station of 
the  most  elevated  comprehensive  expositions  of  the  Divine  laws  concerning  the 
regulation of this world and the hereafter, the heavens and the earth, pre-eternity and 
post-eternity,  and  the dominicality  of  the  Creator  of  the universe,  and  of  all  beings, 
this  Address  displays  such  an  elevated  miraculousness  and  comprehensiveness  that 
both its apparent and simple level, which flatters the simple minds of ordinary people, 
the most numerous group the Qur’an addresses, and its highest level, partake of it.  

It is as though, addressing every age and every class of people, not as one share 
of the story or one lesson from an historical story, but as parts of a universal principle, 
it  is  newly  revealed.  Particularly  its  often  repeated  threats  of  the  wrongdoers,  the 
wrongdoers,  and  its  severe  expositions  of  calamities  visited  on  the  heavens  and  the 
earth, in punishment for their wrongdoing – through these and the retribution visited 
on the ‘Ad and Thamud peoples and on Pharaoh – it draws attention to the unequalled 
wrongs  of  this  century,  and  through  the  salvation  of  prophets  like  Abraham  (PUH) 
and Moses (PUH) gives consolation to the oppressed believers. 

Indeed,  all  past  time  and the  departed  ages  and  centuries,  which  in  the  view  of 
heedlessness and misguidance form a fearsome place of non-existence and a grievous, 
ruined  graveyard,  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  shows  to  every  century  and 
class  of  people  in  the  form  of  living  instructive  pages,  strange  worlds,  living  and 
endowed with  spirits, and existent realms of the  Sustainer which are connected with 
us;  with  an  elevated  miraculousness,  it  sometimes  conveys  us  to  those  times,  and 
sometimes brings those times to us. Infusing with life the universe, which in the view 
of misguidance  is  lifeless, wretched, dead, and a limitless wasteland revolving amid 
separation  and  decline,  with  the  same  miraculousness  this  same  Qur’an  of  Mighty 
Stature  raises  to  life  those  dead  beings,  makes  them  converse  with  one  another  as 
officials charged with duties and  hasten to the assistance of one another;  it  instructs 
mankind, the jinn, and the angels in true, luminous, and pleasurable wisdom.  

For sure, then, it  gains sacred distinctions, like there being ten merits in each of 
its letters, and sometimes a hundred, a thousand, or thousands of merits; and if all men 
and jinn were to gather together, their being unable to produce the like of  it; and its 
speaking completely appropriately with all mankind and all beings; and its all the time 
being inscribed with eagerness in the hearts of millions of hafizes; and its not causing 
weariness through its frequent and numerous repetitions; and despite its many obscure 
passages and sentences, its being settled perfectly in the delicate and simple heads of 
children; and its being agreeable like Zamzam water in the ears of the sick,  

 

467

the  dying,  and  those  distressed  by  a  few  words;  and  its  gaining  for  its  students 
happiness in this world and the next. 

Its  smoothness  of  style,  which,  observing  exactly  its  interpreter’s  being 
unlettered,  allows  for  no  bombast,  artificiality,  or  affectedness,  and  its  descending 
directly from the heavens, demonstrate a fine miraculousness. So too it shows a fine 
miraculousness  in  the  grace and  guidance  of  flattering  the  simple  minds  of  ordinary 
people,  the  most  numerous  of  the  classes  of  men,  through  the  condescension  in  its 
expression, and mostly opening the clearest and most evident pages like the heavens 
and  earth,  and  teaching  the  wondrous  miracles  of  power  and  meaningful  lines  of 
wisdom beneath those commonplace things.  

By making known that it is also a book of prayer and summons, of invocation and 
Divine  unity,  which  require  repetition,  it  demonstrates  a  sort  of  miraculousness 
through  making  understood  in  a  single  sentence  and  a  single  story  through  its 
agreeable  repetitions  numerous  different  meanings  to  numerous  different  classes  of 
people.  Similarly,  by  making  known  that  the  most  minor  and  unimportant  things  in 
ordinary, commonplace events are within its compassionate view and the sphere of its 
will and regulation, it demonstrates a sort of miraculousness in attaching importance 
to  even  the  minor  events  of  the  Companions  of  the  Prophet  in  the  establishment  of 
Islam and codification of the Shari’a, and both in those minor events being universal 
principles, and, in the establishment of Islam and the Shari’a, which are general, their 
producing most important fruits, as though they had been seeds. 

With  regard  to  repetition  being  necessary  due  to  the  repetition  of  need,  the 
repetition of certain verses which, as answers to numerous repeated questions over a 
period  of  twenty  years,  instruct  numerous  different  levels  of  people  is  not  a  fault, 
indeed, to repeat certain sentences so powerful they produce thousands of results and 
a  number  of  verses  resulting  from  countless  evidences,  which  describe  an  infinite, 
awesome,  all-embracing  revolution  that,  by  destroying  utterly  the  vast  universe  and 
changing  its  shape  at  Doomsday,  will  remove  the  world  and  found  the  mighty 
hereafter in its place, and will prove that all particulars and universals from atoms to 
the stars are in the hand and under the disposal of a single Being, and will show the 
Divine  wrath  and  dominical  anger  –on  account  of  the  result  of  the  universe’s 
creation– at mankind's wrongdoing, which brings to anger the earth and the  heavens 
and  the  elements,  to  repeat  such  verses  is  not  a  fault,  but  most  powerful 
miraculousness,  and  most  elevated  eloquence;  an  eloquence  and  lucid  style 
corresponding exactly to the requirements of the subject. 

For  example,  as  is  explained  in  the  Fourteenth  Flash  of  the  Risale-i  Nur,  the 

sentence, 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate, 

 

468

which  forms  a  single  verse  and  is  repeated  one  hundred  and  fourteen  times  in  the 
Qur’an,  is  a  truth  which  binds  the  Divine  Throne  and  the  earth,  and  illuminates the 
cosmos, and for which everyone is in need all the time; if it was repeated millions of 
times, there would still be need for it. There is need and longing for it, not only every 
day like bread, but every moment like air and light. 

And, for example, the verse, 

And verily your Sustainer is Exalted in Might, Most Compassionate, 
which  is  repeated  eight  times  in  Sura  Ta.  Sin.  Mim.2  Repeating  on  account  of  the 
result  of  the  universe’s  creation  and  in  the  name  of  universal  dominicality,  the 
salvation  of  the prophets  whose  stories are  told  in  the  Sura,  and  the punishments  of 
their peoples, in order to teach that dominical dignity requires the torments of those 
wrongdoing  peoples  while  Divine  compassion  requires  the  prophets’  salvation,  is  a 
concise, miraculous, and elevated miraculousness, for which, if repeated thousands of 
times, there would still be need and longing. 

And, for example, the verse, 

Then which of the favours of your Sustainer will you deny?3 

which is repeated in Sura al-Rahman, and the verse, 

Woe that Day to the rejecters of truth!, 

in  Sura  al-Mursalat4  shout  out  threateningly  to  mankind  and  the  jinn  across  the 
centuries and the heavens and the earth, the unbelief, ingratitude, and wrongdoing of 
those who bring the universe and the heavens and earth to anger, spoil the results of 
the world’s creation, and deny and respond slightingly to the majesty of Divine rule, 
and aggress against the rights of all creatures. If a general lesson thus concerned with 
thousands of truths and of the strength of thousands of matters is repeated thousands 
of  times,  there  would  still  be  need  for  it  and  its  awe-inspiring  conciseness  and 
beautiful, miraculous eloquence. 

And, for example, the repetition of the phrase,  

Glory be unto You! There is no god but You: Mercy! Mercy! Save us, deliver 
us, preserve us, from Hell-fire! 

in  the  supplication  of  the  Prophet  (PBUH)  called  Jawshan al-Kabir,  which  is  a true 
and  authentic  supplication of  the  Qur’an  and  a  sort of  summary proceeding  from  it. 
Since it contains the greatest truth and the most important of the three supreme duties 
of creatures in the face of dominicality, the glorifi 

                                                 

2 Sura 26, al-Shu’ara. 
3 Qur’an, 55:13, etc. 
4 Sura 77. 

 

469

cation  and  praise  of  God  and declaring  Him  to  be All-Holy,  and  the  most  awesome 
question facing mankind, man being saved from eternal misery, and worship, the most 
necessary  result  of  human  impotence,  if  it  is  repeated  thousands  of  times,  it  is  still 
few. 

Thus, repetition  in the  Qur’an  looks  to  principles  like  these.  Sometimes  on  one 
page,  even,  with  regard  to  the  requirements  of  the  position  and  the  need  for 
explanation  and  the  demands  of  eloquence,  it  expresses  the  truth  of  Divine  unity 
perhaps  twenty  times  explicitly  and  by  implication.  It  does  not  cause  boredom,  but 
gives a power to it and inspires an eagerness. It has been explained in the Risale-i Nur 
with proofs how appropriate, fitting, and acceptable from the point of view of rhetoric 
are  the  repetitions  in  the  Qur’an.  The  wisdom  and  meaning  of  the  Meccan  and 
Medinan  Suras  in  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  being  different  in  regard  to 
eloquence, miraculousness, and detail and brevity is as follows: 

In Mecca, the first line of those it was addressing and those opposed to it were the 
Qurayshi idolators and untaught tribesmen, so a powerful and elevated style in regard 
to rhetoric was necessary, and a miraculous, convincing, persuasive conciseness, and 
in  order  to  establish  it,  repetition  was  required. Thus,  in  most  of  the  Meccan  Suras, 
repeating and expressing the pillars of belief and degrees in the affirmation of Divine 
unity  with  a  most  powerful,  elevated,  and  miraculous  conciseness,  it  proved  so 
powerfully the first creation and the Resurrection, God and the hereafter, not only in a 
single page, verse, sentence or word, but sometimes in a letter, through grammatical 
devices  like  inverting  the  words  or  sentences,  making  a  word  indefinite,  and 
omissions and inclusions, that the geniuses and leaders of the science of rhetoric met 
it  with  wonder.  The  Risale-i  Nur,  and  the  Twenty-Fifth  Word  and  its  Addenda  in 
particular, which prove in summary forty aspects of the Qur’an’s miraculousness, and 
the  Qur’anic  commentary,  Isharat  al-I’az,  from  the  Arabic  Risale-i  Nur,  which  in 
wondrous fashion proves the aspect of the Qur’an’s miraculousness in its word-order, 
have demonstrated in fact that in the Meccan Suras and verses are the highest styles of 
eloquence and the most elevated, concise miraculousness. 

As  for  the  Medinan  Suras  and  verses,  since  the  first  line  of  those  they  were 
addressing,  who  opposed them,  were  the  People  of  the  Book,  such  as  the  Jews  and 
Christians  who  affirmed  God’s  existence,  what  was  required  by  eloquence  and 
guidance and for the discussion to correspond to the situation, was not explanation of 
the  high  principles  of  religion  and  pillars  of  belief  in  a  simple,  clear,  and  detailed 
style, but the explanation of particular matters of the Shari’a and its injunctions, which 
were the cause of dispute, and the origins and causes of secondary matters and general 
laws. Thus, in the Medinan Suras and verses, through explanations in a detailed, clear, 
simple style, in the matchless manner of exposition peculiar to the Qur’an, it mostly  

 

470

mentions  within  those  particular  secondary  matters,  a  powerful  and  elevated 
summary;  a  conclusion  and  proof,  a  sentence  relating  to  Divine  unity,  belief,  or  the 
hereafter which makes the particular matter of the Shari’a universal and ensures that it 
conforms to belief in God. It illuminates the passage, and elevates it. The Risale-i Nur 
has proved the qualities and fine points and elevated eloquence in the summaries and 
conclusions, which express Divine unity and the hereafter, and come mostly at the end 
of verses, like: 

Indeed, God is Powerful over all things. * Verily God has knowledge of all 
things. * And He is the Mighty, the Wise. * And He is Exalted in Might, Most 
Compassionate. 

In explaining in the Second Beam of the Second Light of the Twenty-Fifth Word, 
ten out of the many fine points of those summaries and conclusions, it has proved to 
the obstinate that they contain a supreme miracle. 

Yes, in expounding those secondary matters of the Shari’a and laws of social life, 
the  Qur’an  at  once  raises  the  views  of  those  it  addresses  to  elevated  and  universal 
points,  and  transforming  a  simple  style  into  an  elevated  one  and  instruction  in  the 
Shari’a to instruction in Divine unity, it shows it is both a book of law and commands 
and  wisdom,  and  a  book  of  the  tenets  of  faith  and  belief,  and  of  invocation  and 
reflection  and  summons.  And  through  teaching  many  of  the  aims  of  Qur’anic 
guidance in every passage, it displays a brilliant and miraculous eloquence different to 
that of the Meccan Suras. 

Sometimes  in  two  words,  for  example,  in  Sustainer  of  All  the  Worlds  and Your 
Sustainer,  through  the  phrase,  Your  Sustainer,  it  expresses  Divine  oneness,  and 
through,  Sustainer  of  All  the  Worlds,  Divine  unity.  It  expresses  the  Divine  oneness 
within  Divine  unity.  In  a  single  sentence  even  it  sees  and  situates  a  particle  in  the 
pupil of an eye, and with the same verse, the same hammer, it situates the sun in the 
sky, making it an eye to the sky. For example, after the verse, 

Who created the heavens and the earth, 

following the verse, 

it says:  

He merges the night into the day, and He merges the day into the night,5 

And He has full knowledge of all that is in [men’s] hearts.6  

It says: “Within the vast majesty of the creation of the earth and the skies, He knows 
and regulates also the thoughts of the heart.” And through an exposition of this sort, 
transforms that simple and unlettered level and particular discussion which takes into 
account the minds of ordinary people, into  

                                                 

5 Qur’an, 35:13. 
6 Qur’an, 35:38.

an elevated, attractive, and general conversation for the purpose of guidance. 

A Question: “Sometimes an important truth is not apparent to a superficial view, 
and  in  some  positions  the  connection  is  not  known  when  an  elevated  summary 
concerning Divine unity or a universal principle is drawn from a minor and ordinary 
matter,  and  it  is  imagined  to  be  a  fault.  For  example,  to  mention  the  extremely 
elevated principle: And over all endued with knowledge, One Knowing7 when Joseph 
(Peace be upon him) seized his brother through  subterfuge, does not appear to be in 
keeping with eloquence. What is its meaning and purpose?” 

The Answer:  In most of the long and middle-length Suras, which are each small 
Qur’ans, and in many pages and passages, not only two or three aims are followed, for 
by its nature the Qur’an comprises many books and teachings, such as being a book of 
invocation,  belief,  and  reflection,  and  a  book  of  law,  wisdom,  and  guidance.  Thus, 
since  it  describes  the  majestic  manifestations  of  Divine  dominicality  and  its 
encompassing all things, as a sort of recitation of the mighty book of the universe, it 
follows  many  aims  in  every  discussion  and  sometimes  on  a  single  page;  while 
instructing in knowledge of God, the degrees in Divine unity, and the truths of belief, 
with  an  apparently  weak  connection  it  opens  another  subject  of  instruction  in  the 
following  passage,  joining  powerful  connections  to  the  weak  one.  It  corresponds 
perfectly to the discussion and raises the level of eloquence. 

A  Second  Question:    “What  is  the  purpose  of  the  Qur’an  proving  and  drawing 
attention to the hereafter, Divine unity, and man’s reward and punishment thousands 
of  times,  explicitly,  implicitly,  and  allusively,  and  teaching  them  in  every  Sura,  on 
every page, and in every discussion?” 

The  Answer:  To  instruct  in  the  most  important,  most  significant,  and  most 
awesome matters in the sphere of contingency and in the revolutions in the universe’s 
history  concerning  man’s  duty,  the  means  to  his  eternal  misery  or  happiness  –  man 
who undertook the vicegerency of the earth – and to remove his countless doubts and 
to  smash  his  violent  denials  and  obduracy,  indeed,  to  make  man  confirm  those 
awesome revolutions and submit to those most necessary essential matters which are 
as  great  as  the  revolutions,  if  the  Qur’an  draws  his  attention  to  them  thousands,  or 
even millions of times, it is not excessive, for those discussions in the Qur’an are read 
millions of times, and they do not cause boredom, nor does the need cease. 

For example, since the verse, 

For  those  who  believe  and  do  righteous  deeds  are  gardens  beneath  which 
rivers flow,8 * They will dwell there for ever.9 

                                                 

7 Qur’an, 12:76. 
8 Qur’an, 85:11. 
9 Qur’an, 5:85, etc. 

 

472

shows the truth of the good news of eternal happiness, which “saves from the eternal 
execution of the reality of death, which every moment shows itself to wretched man, 
both himself, and his world, and all those he loves, and gains for them an everlasting 
sovereignty,” if it is repeated thousands of millions of times and given the importance 
of the universe, it still is not excessive and does not lose its value. Thus, in teaching 
the  innumerable,  invaluable  matters  of  this  sort,  and  endeavouring  to  persuade, 
convince, and prove the occurrence of the awesome revolutions which will destroy the 
present form of the universe and transform it as though it was a house, the Qur’an of 
Miraculous  Exposition  certainly  draws  attention to  these  matters  thousands  of  times 
times  explicitly,  implicitly,  and  allusively,  and  this  is  not  excessive,  but  renews  the 
bounty  which  is  like  an  essential  need,  the  same  as  the  essential  needs  of  bread, 
medicine, air, and light are renewed. 

And, for example, as is proved decisively in the  Risale-i Nur, the wisdom in the 

Qur’an repeating severely, angrily, and forcefully, threatening verses like, 

For  wrong-doers  there  is  a  grievous  penalty.10  *  But  for  those  who  reject 
[God] – for them will be the Fire of Hell.11 

is  that  man’s  unbelief  is  such  a  transgression  against  the  rights  of  the  universe  and 
most creatures that  it makes the  heavens and earth angry and brings the elements to 
anger  so  that  they  deal  blows  on  those  wrong-doers  with  tempest  and  storm. 
According to the clear statement of the verses, 

And when they are cast therein, they will hear the [terrible] drawing-in of its 
breath as it blazes forth * Almost bursting with fury,12 

Hell  so rages at those  iniquitous deniers that it almost disintegrates with  fury. Thus, 
through the wisdom of showing,  not from the point of view of man’s smallness  and 
insignificance  before  such  a  general  crime  and  boundless  aggression,  but  the 
importance of the rights of the Monarch of Universe’s subjects before the greatness of 
the wrongful crime and the awesomeness of the unjust aggression, and the boundless 
ugliness in the unbelief and iniquity of those deniers – in accordance with the wisdom 
of showing this, if repeating in His decree most wrathfully and severely the crime and 
its  punishment,  thousands,  millions,  or  even  thousands  of  millions  of  times,  it  still 
would not be excessive and a fault, because for a thousand years thousands of millions 
of  people  have  read  such  verses  every  day,  not  with  boredom,  but  with  complete 
eagerness and need. 

Indeed, every day, all the time, for everyone, one world disappears and the door 

of a new world is opened to them. Through repeating There is no  

                                                 

10 Qur’an, 14:22. 
11 Qur’an, 35:36. 
12 Qur’an, 67:7-8. 

 

473

god but God a thousand times out of need and with longing in order to illuminate each 
of those transitory worlds, it makes There is no god but God a lamp for each of those 
changing  veils.  In  the  same  way,  in  accordance  with  the  wisdom  of  appreciating 
through reading the Qur’an the penalties of those crimes and the severe threats of the 
Pre-Eternal Monarch, which smash their obduracy, and of working to be saved from 
the rebellion of the soul, so as not to obscure in darkness those multiple, fleeting veils 
and  renewed  travelling  universes,  and  not  to  make  ugly  their  images  which  are 
reflected in the mirrors of their lives, and not to turn against them those guest views 
which  may  testify  in  favour  of  them,  the  Qur’an  repeats  them  in  most  meaningful 
fashion. Even Satan would shudder at imagining to be out of place these so powerful, 
severe, and repeated threats of the Qur’an. It shows that the torments of Hell are pure 
justice for the deniers who do not heed them.  

And, for example, in repeating many times the stories of Moses (Peace be upon 
him), which contain many instances of wisdom and benefits, like that of the Staff of 
Moses,  and  of  the  other  prophets  (Peace  be  upon  them),  it  demonstrates  that  the 
prophethoods of all the other prophets are a proof of the veracity of the prophethood 
of Muhammad (PBUH), and that one who does not deny all of them cannot in truth 
deny  his  messengership. For this purpose, and since everyone does not always  have 
the  time or  capability  to  read  the  whole  Qur’an,  it  repeats those  stories  in  the  same 
way as the important pillars of belief, in order to make all the long and middle-length 
Suras each like a small Qur’an. To repeat them then is not excessive, it is required by 
eloquence,  and  teaches  that  the  question  of  Muhammad  (PBUH)  is  the  greatest 
question of mankind and the most important matter of the universe. 

It  has  been  demonstrated  decisively  in  the  Risale-i  Nur  with  many  proofs  and 
indications that through giving the highest position to the person of Muhammad in the 
Qur’an  and  including  him  in  four  pillars  of  belief  and  holding  Muhammad  is  the 
Messenger  of  God  equal  to  the  pillar  of  There  is  no  god  but  God,  that  the 
Messengership of Muhammad (PBUH) is the  greatest truth  in the universe, and that 
the Person of Muhammad is the most noble of creatures, and his universal collective 
personality  and  sacred  rank,  known  as  the  Muhammadan  Truth,  is  the  most  radiant 
Sun  of  the two  worlds.  His  worthiness  for  this extraordinary  position  has  also  been 
proved. One of these proofs is this: 

According to the principle of ‘the cause is  like the doer,’ with the equivalent of 
all the good works performed by all his community at all times entering his book of 
good works; and the light which he brought illuminating all the truths of the cosmos; 
and  his  gratifying  not  only  the  jinn,  mankind,  and  animate  beings,  but  also  the 
universe and  the  heavens  and  earth;  and  the  supplications  of  plants,  offered  through 
the tongue of disposition, and the supplications of animals offered through the tongue 
of their innate need, and the  

 

474

righteous of his (PBUH) community every day bequeating to him their benedictions 
and  supplications  for  mercy  and  spiritual  gains,  whose  millions  –and  together  with 
spirit beings, even, millions of millions– of unrejectable supplications are accepted, as 
we  actually  witness  with  our  eyes;  and  since  each  of  the  three  hundred  thousand 
letters of the Qur’an yield from a hundred to a thousand merits, with infinite numbers 
of  lights  entering  the  book  of  his  deeds,  only  with  regard  to  the  recitation  of  the 
Qur’an by all his community, the One All-Knowing of the Unseen saw and knew that 
the Muhammadan (PBUH)  Reality, which  is  his  collective personality, would in the 
future be like a Tuba-tree of Paradise. It was in accordance with that position that He 
gave  him  such  supreme  importance  in  the  Qur’an,  and  in  His  Decree  showed  the 
following of him and receiving of his intercession through adhering to his Illustrious 
Sunna  to  be  one  of  the  most  important  matters  concerning  man.  And  from  time  to 
time  He  took  into consideration  his  human  personality  and  human  state  in  his  early 
life, which was a seed of the majestic Tuba-tree. 

Thus, since the truths repeated in the Qur’an are of this  value, all sound natures 
will testify that in its repetitions is a powerful and extensive miracle. Unless, that is to 
say, a person is afflicted with some sickness of the heart and malady of the conscience 
due to the plague of materialism, and is included under the rule,  

Man denied the light of the sun due to disease of the eye,  
His mouth denied the taste of water due to sickness. 

TWO ADDITIONS, WHICH FORM A CONCLUSION 
TO THE TENTH TOPIC 

THE FIRST: Twelve years ago I heard that a most fearsome and obdurate atheist 
had  instigated  a  conspiracy  against  the  Qur’an,  which  was  to  have  it  translated.  He 
said:  “The  Qur’an  should  be  translated  so  that  everyone  can  know  just  what  it  is.” 
That  is,  he  hatched  a  dire  plan  with  the  idea  of  everyone  seeing  its  unnecessary 
repetitions and its translation being read in its place. However, the irrefutable proofs 
of  the  Risale-i  Nur  proved  decisively  that  “A  true  translation  of  the  Qur’an  is  not 
possible, and other languages cannot preserve the Qur’an’s qualities and fine points in 
place  of  the  grammatical  language  of  Arabic.  Man’s  trite  and  partial  translations 
cannot be substituted for the miraculous and comprehensive words of the Qur’an,  

 

475

every letter of which yields from ten to a thousand merits; they may not be read in its 
place  in  mosques.”  Through  spreading  everywhere,  the  Risale-i  Nur  made  the 
fearsome  plan  come  to  nothing.  I  surmise  that  it  was  due  to  the  idiotic  and  lunatic 
attempts of dissemblers  to  extinguish  the  Sun  of the  Qur’an  on  account of  Satan  by 
puffing  at  it  like  silly  children  having  taken  lessons  from  that  atheist,  that  I  was 
inspired  to  write  this  Tenth  Matter  while  under  great  constraint  and  in  a  most 
distressing situation. But I do not know the reality of the situation since I have been 
unable to meet with others. 

SECOND ADDITION:  After our release from Denizli Prison, I was staying on 
the top floor of the famous Şehir Hotel. The subtle and graceful dancing of the leaves, 
branches, and trunks of the many poplar trees in  the fine  gardens opposite me at the 
touching  of  the  breeze,  each  with  a  rapturous  and  ecstatic  motion  like  a  circle  of 
dervishes,  pained  my  heart,  sorrowful  and  melancholy  at  being  parted  from  my 
brothers  and  remaining  alone.  Suddenly  the  seasons  of  autumn  and  winter  came  to 
mind  and  a  heedlessness  overcame me.  I  so  pitied  those  graceful  poplars  and  living 
creatures  swaying  with  perfect  joyousness  that  my  eyes  filled  with  tears.  With  this 
reminder  of  the  separations  and  non-being  beneath  the  ornamented  veil  of  the 
universe, the grief at a world-full of deaths and separations pressed down on me. Then 
suddenly,  the  Light  the  Muhammadan  (PBUH)  Truth  had  brought  came  to  my 
assistance  and  transformed  my  grief  and  sorrow  into  joy.  Indeed,  I  am  eternally 
grateful to the Muhammadan Being (PBUH) for the assistance and consolation which 
alleviated my situation at that time, only a single instance of the boundless effulgence 
of that Light for me, like for all believers and everyone. It was like this:  

By  showing  those  blessed  and  delicate  creatures  to  be  without  function  or 
purpose, and their motion to be not out of joy, but as though trembling on the brink of 
non-existence  and  separation  and  tumbling  into  nothingness,  that  heedless  view  so 
touched  the  feelings  in  me  of  desire  for  permanence,  love  of  good  things,  and 
compassion  for  fellow-creatures  and  life  that  it transformed  the  world  into  a  sort of 
hell  and  my  mind  into  an  instrument  of  torture.  Then,  just  at  that  point,  the  Light 
Muhammad  (Peace  and  blessings  by  upon  him)  had  brought  as  a  gift  for  mankind 
raised the veil; it showed in place of extinction, non-being, nothingness, purposeless, 
futility,  and  separations,  meanings  and  instances  of  wisdom  to  the  number  of  the 
leaves  of the  poplars,  and  as  is  proved  in  the  Risale-i  Nur, results  and  duties  which 
may be divided into three sorts:  

The  First  Sort    looks  to  the  All-Glorious  Maker’s  Names.  For  example,  if  a 
master craftsman makes a wondrous machine, everyone applauds him, saying: “What 
wonders God has willed! Blessed be God!” Similarly, the machine congratulates the 
craftsman  through  the  tongue  of  its  disposition,  through  displaying  perfectly  the 
results intended from it. All living beings  

 

476

and all things are machines  such as that; they  applaud their Craftsman through their 
glorifications. 

The  Second  Sort  of  the  Instances  of  Wisdom  looks  to  the  views  of  living 
creatures and conscious beings. Beings each become an agreeable object of study,  a 
book of knowledge. They leave their meanings in the sphere of existence in the minds 
of conscious beings and their forms in their memories, and on the tablets in the World 
of  Similitudes,  and  in  the  notebooks  of  the  World  of  the  Unseen,  then  they  depart 
from  the  Manifest  World  and  withdraw  to  the  World  of  the  Unseen.  That  is,  they 
leave behind an apparent existence, but gain many existences pertaining to meaning, 
the  Unseen, and knowledge. Yes, since God exists and His  knowledge encompasses 
everything,  in  the  view  of  reality,  in  the  world  of  believers  there  is  surely  no  non-
being,  extinction,  nothingness,  annihilation,  and  transitoriness,  while  the  world  of 
unbelievers  is  full  of  non-existence,  separation,  nothingness,  and  transience.  This  is 
taught  by  the  saying,  which  is  on  everyone’s  lips,  “For  those  for  whom God  exists, 
everything exists; and for those for whom He does not exist, nothing exists; for them 
there is nothing.” 

IN  SHORT:  Just  as  belief  saves  man  from  eternal  annihilation  at  the  time  of 
death,  so  it  saves  everyone’s  private  world  from  the  darknesses  of  annihilation  and 
nothingness.  Whereas  unbelief,  and  especially  if  it  is  absolute  unbelief,  both  sends 
man  and  his  private  world  to  non-existence  with  death,  and  casts  him  into  infernal 
darknesses. It transforms the pleasures of life into bitter poisons. Let the ears ring of 
those who prefer the life of this world to that of the hereafter! Let them come and find 
a solution for this, or else  let them embrace belief and be saved from these dreadful 
losses! 

Glory be unto You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught 
us; indeed, You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.13 

From your brother who is in much need 
of your prayers and misses you greatly, 

Said Nursi

The Twenty-Sixth Word 

THE TREATISE ON DIVINE DETERMINING 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
And there is not a thing but its [sources and] treasures [inexhaustible] are with 
Us, but We only send down thereof in due and ascertainable measures.1 * And of 
all things have We taken account in a Clear Book.2 

 [Divine Determining3 and the power of choice4 are two important matters. We 
shall attempt to disclose a few of their mysteries in four ‘Topics’.] 

FIRST TOPIC 

Divine Determining and the power of choice are aspects of a belief pertaining to state 
and conscience which show the  final  limits of Islam and  belief; they  are  not theoretical 
and  do  not  pertain  to  knowledge.  That  is  to  say,  a  believer  attributes  everything  to 
Almighty God, even his actions and self, till finally the power of choice confronts him, so 
he cannot evade his obligation and responsibility. It tells him:  “You are responsible and 
under  obligation.”  Then,  so  that  he  does  not  become  proud  at  his  good  deeds  and  his 
achievements,  Divine  Determining  confronts  him,  saying:  “Know  your  limits;  the  one 
who does them is not you.” Yes, Divine Determining and the power of choice are at the 
final  degrees  of  belief  and  Islam;  the  former  has  been  included  among  the  matters  of 
belief  to  save  the  soul  from  pride,  and  the  latter,  to  make  it  admit  to  its  responsibility. 
Obdurate  evil-commanding  souls  clinging  to  Divine  Determining  in  order  to  clear 
themselves  of  the  responsibility  of  the  evils  they  have  committed,  and  their  becoming 
proud and conceited on account of the virtues bestowed on them and their relying on the 
power of  choice,  are  actions  totally  opposed to the  mystery  of  Divine  Determining  and 
wisdom  of  the  power  of  choice;  they  are  not  matters  pertaining  to  knowledge  which 
might give rise to such actions. 

                                                

1 Qur’an, 15:21. 
2 Qur’an, 36:12. 
3 Divine Determining (Qadar; T. Kader) is also known as fate or destiny. [Tr.] 
4 The power of choice or faculty of will (juz’i irada, juz’-i ikhtiyari), also known as free will. [Tr.] 

 

478 

For  ordinary  people  who  have  not  progressed  spiritually  there  may  be  occasions 
when  Divine  Determining  is  used,  and  these  are  calamities  and  disasters  when  it  is  the 
remedy for despair and grief. But it should not be used to justify rebellion and in matters 
of the future so that it becomes a cause of dissipation and idleness. That is to say, Divine 
Determining  has  not  been  included  among  the  matters  of  belief  to  relieve  people  from 
their obligations  and responsibility,  but to save them  from pride and  conceit.  While the 
power of choice has been included in order to be the source of evils, not to be the source 
of virtues, so that people become like the Pharaoh.  

Yes,  as  the  Qur’an  states,  man  is  totally  responsible  for  his  evils,  for  it  is  he  who 
wants the evils. Since evils are destructive, man may perpetrate much destruction with a 
single evil act, like burning down a house with one match, and he becomes deserving of 
an  awesome  punishment.  However,  he  does  not  have  the  right  to  take  pride  in  good 
deeds; his part in them is extremely small. For what wants and requires the good deeds is 
Divine mercy, and what creates them is dominical power. Both request and reply, reason 
and  cause,  are  from  God.  Man  only  comes  to  have  them  through  supplication,  belief, 
consciousness, and consent. As for evils, it is man’s soul that wants them, either through 
capacity  or  through  choice,  –  like  in  the  white  and  beautiful  light  of  the  sun  some 
substances  become  black  and  putrefy,  and  the  blackness  is  related  to  their  capacity  – 
however,  it  is  Almighty  God  Who  creates  the  evils  through  a  Divine  law  which 
comprises numerous benefits. That is to say, the cause and the request are from the soul, 
so that it is the soul which is responsible, while it is Almighty God Who creates the evils 
and  brings  them  into  existence,  and  since  they  have  other  results  and  fruits  which  are 
good, they are good.  

It is  for the above reason that the  ‘acquisition’ (kasb) of  evil, that  is, the desire  for 
evil,  is evil,  but the creation of evil  is  not evil.  A  lazy  man who receives damage  from 
rain,  which  comprises  many  instances  of  good, may  not  say  that  the  rain  is  not  mercy. 
Yes,  together  with  a  minor  evil  in  its  creation  are  numerous  instances  of  good.  To 
abandon  that  good  for  a  minor  evil  becomes  a  greater  evil.  Therefore,  a  minor  evil 
becomes like good. There is no evil or ugliness in Divine creation. They rather pertain to 
His servant’s wish and to his capacity. 

Furthermore, Divine Determining is both exempt from evil and ugliness with regard 
to results and fruits, and free from tyranny and ugliness with respect to reason and cause. 
Because Divine Determining looks to the true causes and acts justly. Men construct their 
judgements  on  causes  which  they  see  superficially  and  fall  into  error  within  the  pure 
justice of Divine Determining. For example, a  judge  finds  you guilty of theft and  sends 
you to prison. You are not a thief, but you have committed a murder which no one knows 
about. Thus, Divine Determining also sentenced you to imprisonment,  

 

479 

but it sentenced you for the secret murder and acted justly. Since the judge sentenced you 
for  a  theft  of  which  you  were  innocent,  he  acted  unjustly.  Thus,  in  a  single  thing  the 
justice  of  Divine  Determining  and  Divine  creation  and  man’s  wrongful  choice  or 
acquisition  were  apparent  in  two  respects;  you  can  make  analogies  with  this  for  other 
things. That is to say, with regard to origin and end, source and branch, cause and results, 
Divine Determining and creation are exempt from evil, ugliness, and tyranny. 

I f  i t  i s  s a i d :  “Man has no ability to create with his power of choice and has 
nothing apart  from ‘acquisition,’ which  is as though theoretical, so  how  is  it that  in the 
Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  he  is  shown  to  be  rebellious  and  hostile  towards  the 
Creator  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  Who  complains  greatly  about  him;  the  Creator 
mobilizes  Himself  and  all  His  angels  to  assist  His  believing  servants  against  the 
rebellious, affording them the greatest importance?” 

T h e  A n s w e r :  Because disbelief, rebellion, and evil are destruction and non-
existence.  However,  vast  destruction  and  innumerable  instances  of  non-existence  may 
result  from  a  single  theoretical  matter  and  one  instance  of  non-existence.  Through  the 
helmsman  of  a  large  ship  abandoning  his  duty,  the  ship  may  sink  and  the  labour  of  all 
those employed on it go for nothing; all those instances of destruction will result from a 
single  instance  of  non-existence.  Similarly,  since  disbelief  and  rebellion  are  non-
existence  and  destruction,  the  power of  choice  may  provoke them  through  a theoretical 
matter  and  cause  awesome  consequences.  For  although  disbelief  is  only  one  evil,  it 
insults  the  whole  universe,  accusing  it  of  being  worthless  and  futile,  and  denies  all 
beings,  which  display  proofs  of  Divine  unity,  and  is  contemptuous  towards  all  the 
manifestations of the Divine Names. It is therefore pure wisdom that Almighty God utters 
severe complaints about the unbelievers, threatening them awesomely in the name of the 
universe  and  all  beings  and  the  Divine  Names;  it  is  pure  justice  that they  should  suffer 
eternal  punishment.  Since  through  unbelief  and  rebellion  man  takes  the  way  of 
destruction, with a small act of service, he may perform a great many works. In the face 
of unbelief therefore, the believers are  in  need of Almighty God’s  boundless grace. For 
due to one troublesome child who  is trying to burn down a  house, ten  strong  men  who 
have undertaken to protect and repair it may be obliged to beseech the child’s parents, or 
even have recourse to the king. In the same way the believers are in need of many Divine 
favours in order to withstand the unmannerly people of rebellion. 

I n  S h o r t :  If the one speaking of Divine Determining and the power of choice 
has  perfect  belief  and  is  aware  of  the  Divine  presence,  he  attributes  the  universe  and 
himself  to  Almighty  God,  knowing  them  to  be  under  His  disposal.  He  has  the  right  to 
speak of them. For since he knows himself and everything to be from Almighty God, he 
assumes the responsibility,  

 

480 

basing it on his power of choice. He accepts that it is the source of evils and proclaims his 
Sustainer  free  of  fault.  He  remains  within  the  sphere  of  worship  and  undertakes  the 
obligations with which  he  is charged by  Almighty God. Moreover, he does not become 
proud  at  his  good  deeds  and  achievements;  he  rather  looks  to  Divine  Determining  and 
offers thanks. He sees Divine Determining in the calamities that befall him, and endures 
them in patience. 

However, if the one speaking of Divine Determining and the power of choice is one 
of the heedless and neglectful, then he has no right to speak of them. For, impelled by his 
misguidance, his evil-commanding  soul attributes the universe to causes and divides up 
God’s property among them.  And  he attributes the ownership of  himself to himself. He 
ascribes  his  acts  to  himself  and  to  causes.  His  responsibility  and  faults,  he  refers  to 
Divine Determining. He will finally ascribe the power of choice to Almighty God, and he 
will  consider  Divine  Determining  last  of  all;  thus  discussion  of  them  becomes 
meaningless. To discuss them is only a trick of the soul which is entirely contrary to the 
wisdom in them, in order to save such a person from responsibility. 

SECOND TOPIC 

This is a minute and scholarly investigation addressing scholars in particular.5 
I f  y o u  s a y : “How is Divine Determining compatible with the power of choice?” 
T h e  A n s w e r : In seven ways... 
The  First:  The  All-Just  and  Wise  One,  to  Whose  wisdom  and  justice  the  universe 
testifies with the tongue of order and balance, gave to man a power of choice of unknown 
nature  which  would  be  the  means  of  reward  and  punishment  for  him.  We  do  not  know 
many of the numerous aspects of the All-Just and Wise One’s wisdom; our not knowing 
how the power of choice is compatible with Divine Determining does not prove that it is 
not so. 

The Second: Of necessity everyone perceives in himself a will and choice; he knows 
it through his conscience. To know the nature of beings is one thing; to know they exist is 
something different. There are many things which although their existence is self-evident, 
we do not know their true nature... The power of choice  may  be  included among these. 
Everything is not restricted to what we know; our not knowing them does not prove the 
things we do not know do not exist. 

                                                

5 This Second Topic is the most profound and difficult of the questions of the mystery of Divine 
Determining. It is held by the all learned scholars to be one of the most important and controversial 
questions of theology and belief, yet the Risale-i Nur has solved it completely. 

 

481 

The  Third:  The  power  of  choice  is  not  opposed  to  Divine  Determining,  indeed, 
Divine Determining corroborates the power of choice. Because Divine Determining is a 
sort of  Divine  knowledge.  Divine  knowledge  is  connected  with  our  will  and  choice,  in 
which case it corroborates it, it does not nullify it. 

The  Fourth:  Divine  Determining  is  a  sort of  knowledge.  Knowledge  is  dependent 
on  the  thing  known.  That  is,  it  knows  it  as  it  is.  The  thing  known  is  not  dependent  on 
knowledge.  That  is,  the  principles  of  knowledge  are  not  fundamental  so  that  the 
knowledge  directs  the  thing  known  with  regard  to  its  external  existence.  Because  the 
essence  of  the  thing  known  and  its  external  existence  look  to  will  and  are  based  on 
power. Also, pre-eternity is not the tip of a chain reaching into the past which should be 
considered the end point  in the existence of things and a  source of compulsion. Rather, 
pre-eternity  holds the past, the present, and the  future all at once, looking at them  from 
above  like a  mirror. In which  case,  it  is  not right to imagine an  end to past time which 
stretches  back  within  the  sphere  of  contingency  and  call  it  pre-eternity,  and  to  suppose 
that things enter that knowledge of pre-eternity in sequence, and that oneself is outside it; 
to  reason  thus  is  not  right.  Consider  the  following  example  in  order  to  explain  this 
mystery: 

Suppose there is a mirror in your hand and the area to your right is the past and the 
area  to  your  left,  the  future;  the  mirror  only  holds  what  is  opposite  it.  Then  with  a 
movement it holds both sides, but it cannot hold all of it. However low the mirror is held, 
less will appear in it, and the higher it rises, the area it encompasses expands, until it can 
hold both sides in their entirety simultaneously. Whatever occurs in the areas reflected in 
the mirror in this position cannot be said to precede or follow one another, or to conform 
to or oppose one another. Divine Determining is part of pre-eternal knowledge, and in the 
words of the Hadith, pre-eternal knowledge is “at an elevated station which from its lofty 
view-point encompasses everything that has  been and will  be  from pre-eternity to post-
eternity.” We and our reasoning cannot be outside of it so we can be like a mirror to the 
area of the past. 

The Fifth: Divine Determining has a connection with cause and effect. That is, this 
effect will occur through this cause. In which case, it may not be said that “Since so-and-
so’s death  is determined  at such-and-such a time, what  fault  has the  man who  fired the 
rifle through his own choice, for if he had not fired it, the other still would have died?” 

Question: Why may it not be said? 
The  Answer:  Because  Divine  Determining  specified  that  so-and-so’s  death  would 

occur through the man’s rifle. If you suppose that he did not fire  

 

482 

the rifle, then  you are  supposing that Divine  Determining  had  no connection with  it, so 
with what would you decree his death? If you imagine cause and effect to be separate like 
the  Jabriyya,  or  you  deny  Divine  Determining  like  the  Mu’tazila,  you  leave  the  Sunni 
School and join the heretics. We people of truth say: “If he had not fired the rifle, we do 
not know if he would have died.” The Jabariyya say: “If he had not fired it, he still would 
have died.” While the Mu’tazila say: “If he had not fired it, he would not have died.” 

The Sixth:6 According to Maturidi, inclination, the essence of the power of choice, 
is  a  theoretical  or  relative  matter  and  may  be  attributed  to  God’s  servants.  But  Ash’ari 
considered  it  to  have  existence,  so  did  not  attribute  it  to  them.  However,  according  to 
Ash’ari, the power of disposal within inclination is a theoretical matter, which makes the 
inclination  and  the  disposal  together  a  relative  matter  lacking  a  definite  external 
existence. Theoretical or relative  matters do not require  causes through which,  for their 
existence, necessity would intervene and nullify the will and power of choice. Rather, if 
the  cause  of  the  theoretical  matters  acquires  the  weight  of  preference,  the  theoretical 
matter  may  become  actual  and  existent.  In  which  case,  at  that  juncture,  it  may  be 
abandoned.  The  Qur’an  may  say  to  a  person  at  that  point:  “This  is  evil;  do  not  do  it.” 
Indeed, if God’s servants had been the creators of their actions and had had the power to 
create, then their wills would have been removed. For an established rule in the sciences 
of religion and philosophy is: “If a thing is not necessary, it may not come into existence 
[of itself].” That is, there has to be a cause for a thing to come into existence. The cause 
necessarily requires the effect. Then no power of choice would remain. 

If  you  say:  Preference  without  a  cause  or  attribute  to  cause  the  preference  is 
impossible.  Whereas  the  theoretical  or  relative  matter  we  call  human  acquisition 
sometimes  does  a  thing  and  sometimes  does  not;  if  there  is  nothing  to  cause  the 
preference,  preference  without  something  to  cause  it  would  necessarily  occur,  and  this 
demolishes one of the most important bases of theology? 

The  Answer:  A  being  preferable  without  something  to  make  it  preferable  is 
impossible. That is, a being deemed preferable or superior without a cause or attribute to 
make it so is impossible. But preference without something to cause it is permissible and 
occurs. Will is an attribute, and its mark is to perform a work such as that. 

If you ask: “Since the one who creates the murder is Almighty God, why do you call 

me a murderer?” 

The  Answer:  Because  according  to  the  rules  of  grammar,  the  active  participle  is 

derived from the infinitive, which is a relative matter. It cannot be  

                                                

6 This is a truth addressing exact scholars in particular. 

 

483 

derived from the verbal noun, which is an actual or existent matter. The infinitive is our 
acquisition; so we are called the murderer. The verbal noun is Almighty God’s creature. 
Something  which  gives  an  inkling  of  responsibility  cannot  be  derived  from  the  verbal 
noun. 

The  Seventh:  For  sure,  man’s  faculty  of  will  and  power of  choice  are  weak  and  a 
theoretical  matter,  but  Almighty  God,  the  Absolutely  Wise  One,  made  that  weak  and 
partial will a condition  for the connection of His  universal  will. He  in  effect says:  “My 
servant! Whichever way you wish to take with your will, I will take you there. In which 
case the responsibility is yours!” If the comparison is not mistaken, you take a powerless 
child  onto  your  shoulders  and  leaving  the  choice  to  him,  tell  him  you  will  take  him 
wherever he wishes. The child wants to go to a high mountain so you take him there, but 
he either catches cold or falls. So of course you reprimand him, saying, “You wanted to 
go there,” and  you give  him  a slap. Thus,  Almighty God, the Firmest of Judges,  makes 
His servant’s will, which is utterly weak, a condition, and His universal will follows it. 

I  n    S  h  o  r  t  :    O  man!  You  have  a  will  known  as  the  power  of  choice  which  is 
extremely  weak,  but  whose  hand  in  evil  acts  and  destruction  is  extremely  long  and  in 
good deeds is extremely short. Give one of the hands of that will of yours to supplication, 
so  that  it  may  reach  Paradise,  a  fruit  of  the  chain  of  good  deeds,  and  stretch  to  eternal 
happiness. And give its other hand to the seeking of forgiveness, so that it may be short 
for  evil  deeds  and  will  not  reach  the  Zakkum-tree  of  Hell,  which  is  one  fruit  of  that 
accursed  tree.  That  is,  just  as  supplication  and  reliance  on  God  greatly  strengthen  the 
inclination to do good, so repentance and the seeking of forgiveness cut the inclination to 
do evil, putting an end to its transgressions. 

THIRD TOPIC 

Belief  in  Divine  Determining  is  one  of  the  pillars  of  belief.  That  is,  the  belief  that 
“everything is determined by Almighty God.” The certain proofs for Divine Determining 
are so numerous they cannot be calculated. We shall show in an Introduction, simply and 
clearly, how strong and broad is this pillar of belief. 

I n t r o d u c t i o n :   
Numerous verses of the Qur’an, like, 

Nor  anything  fresh  or  dry  [green  or  withered]  but  is  [inscribed]  in  a  Clear 
Book,7 

state  clearly  that  before  it  comes  into  existence  and  after  it  passes  from  existence, 
everything is written. Through its creational signs like the order,  

                                                

7 Qur’an, 6:59. 

 

484 

balance,  regularity,  adornment,  differentiation,  and  the  giving  of  form,  the  verses,  the 
signs, of the  mighty Qur’an  inscribed  by Divine  power and called the universe confirm 
these  statements  of  the  Qur’an.  Indeed,  the  well-ordered  missives  and  finely  balanced 
verses  of  the  book of  the  universe  testify  that  everything  is  written. The  indication  that 
everything  is  determined  and  written  before  it  comes  into  existence  are  all  beginnings, 
seeds,  measured  proportions,  and  forms;  each  of  these  testifies  to  this.  For  seeds  and 
grains are subtle containers appearing from the workbench of  “Be!,” and it is in each of 
which  is  deposited  a  tiny  index  traced  by  Divine  Determining.  Divine  power  employs 
minute particles according to that plan of Divine Determining, and constructs the mighty 
miracles of power on the seeds. That is to say, everything that will happen to the tree is as 
though inscribed in its seed. For in regard to their substance seeds are simple and similar 
to one another; materially they are nothing. 

Furthermore,  the  well-measured  proportions  of  everything  clearly  show  Divine 
Determining.  Yes,  whatever  living  creature  is  considered,  it  is  as  though  its  form  and 
measure  emerged  from  a  wisely  and  skilfully  wrought  mould.  For  it  to  receive  such  a 
measure, form, and shape, either there has to be a truly wondrous and infinitely intricate 
physical  mould,  or  else  pre-eternal  power  cuts  out  the  form  and  shape  according  to  a 
well-proportioned  immaterial  mould  that  exists  in  knowledge  and  comes  from  Divine 
Determining, and clothes  it  in  it. For example,  look carefully at this tree or that animal, 
you will see that the particles, which are lifeless, deaf, blind, unconscious, and similar to 
one another, are in motion in its growth and development. In some of the being’s intricate 
extremities  the  particles  halt,  as  though  seeing,  knowing  and  recognizing  the  place  of 
fruits and benefits. Then in another place they change their direction as though following 
some  important  aim.  That  means  they  are  in  motion  in  accordance  with  the  immaterial 
measured proportions of the tree or animal, which  come  from Divine Determining, and 
are governed by those proportions.  

Since  there  are  the  manifestations  of  Divine  Determining  to this  extent  in  physical 
and visible things, certainly the forms with which things are clothed with the passing of 
time and the states acquired through the motions they perform will also be dependent on 
the  ordering  of  Divine  Determining.  In  a  seed  are  two  manifestations  of  Divine 
Determining; one is ‘evident’ and points to the Clear Book, which is a title of will and the 
creational commands; the other is ‘theoretical’ and points to the Clear Record, which is a 
title  of  Divine  knowledge  and  the  Divine  command.  ‘Evident’  Divine  Determining 
specifies the physical nature, states, and parts of the tree which the seed comprises. While 
‘theoretical’  Divine  Determining  specifies  the  stages,  states,  forms,  motions,  and 
glorifications  which  the  tree  will  undergo  and  perform  over  the  period  of  its  life,  and 
which are in the seed and will be  

 

485 

created  from  it;  these  stages,  states,  forms,  and  acts,  which  constantly  change  and  are 
called  its  life-history,  each  have  a  regulated  measure  in  accordance  with  Divine 
Determining, the same as the tree’s branches and leaves.  

Since there is such a manifestation of Divine Determining in the most common and 
simple of things, it surely demonstrates that all things are written before they come into 
existence; this may be understood with little attention. Now, evidence for the fact that the 
story  of  everything’s  life  is  written  after  its  existence  are  all  fruits,  which  in  this  world 
tell of the Clear  Book and the  Clear Record, and the  faculty of  memory  in  man, which 
points to the Preserved Tablet; these all hint and testify to this fact. Indeed, the appointed 
events of a tree’s life are written in its seeds, which are like the hearts of its fruits. And 
man’s  life-history  together  with  some  of  the  past  events  of  the  world  are  written  in  his 
memory  in  such  a  way  that,  as  though  copying  out  with  the  hand  of  power  and  pen  of 
Divine Determining in a faculty as tiny as a mustard seed a small note from the page of 
his  actions,  the  memory  gives  the  note  to  man’s  hand  and  puts  it  in  the  pocket  of  his 
mind, so that with it he will call his actions to mind at the time of reckoning. So too, due 
to  it  he  may  be  confident  that  within  the  upheavals  of  transience  and  death  there  are 
numerous  lasting  mirrors  in  which  the  All-Powerful  and  Wise  One  depicts  and  makes 
permanent  the  identities  of  transient  beings;  and  truly  numerous  tablets  which  shall 
endure  for  all  eternity  on  which  that  All-Knowing  Preserver  inscribes  the  meanings  of 
transitory beings. 

I n  S h o r t :  Since plant life, the simplest and lowest level of life, is dependent on 
the ordering of Divine Determining to this extent, certainly human life, the highest level 
of life, has been drawn in all in its details according to the scale and measuring of Divine 
Determining and is inscribed by its pen. Yes, just as raindrops tell of clouds, and drops of 
water point to the existence of a water-source, and notes and portfolios to the existence of 
a large ledger, so too, the ‘evident’ Divine Determining which we observe and which is 
the  physical  order  in  living  beings  indicates  the  notebook of  Divine  will  and  creational 
commands  known  as  the  Clear  Book.  Similarly,  their  fruits,  seeds,  grains,  forms,  and 
shapes,  which  are  like  the  droplets,  notes,  and  portfolios  of  ‘theoretical’  Divine 
Determining, which is the non-physical order and pertains to life, indicates the Preserved 
Tablet, one office of Divine knowledge, which is called the Clear Record. 

T o  C o n c l u d e : We see clearly that at the time of their growth and development 
the particles of living beings travel to their intricate extremities and halt, then they change 
their  path.  At  each  of  the  extremities  they  produce  the  fruits  of  benefits,  uses,  and 
instances  of  wisdom.  Clearly,  the  forms  of  those  things  and  their  measures  are  drawn 
with a pen of Determining. Thus, observable, evident Determining shows that in the non-
physical states of  

 

486 

living beings also are well-ordered, fruitful extremities and limits drawn with the pen of 
Determining. Divine power is the source, Divine Determining is the pattern. Power writes 
the  meaningful  book on that pattern. Since we understand clearly that the  fruitful  limits 
and  purposeful  extremities  have  been  drawn  with  the  pen  of  Divine  Determining, 
physical and non-physical, certainly the states and stages which all living beings undergo 
in  the  course  of  their  lives  are  also  drawn  with  that  pen.  For  their  life-stories  follow  a 
course with order and  balance; they change  forms and receive  shapes. Since the pen of 
Divine  Determining  thus  rules  in  all  living  beings,  surely  the  life-history  of  man,  the 
world’s most perfect fruit and vicegerent of the earth and bearer of the Supreme Trust, is 
more than anything dependent on the law of Divine Determining. 

I  f    y  o  u    s  a  y  :  “Divine  Determining  has  bound  us  like  this.  It  has  negated  our 
freedom. Isn’t belief in it a burden and irksome for the heart and spirit, which yearn for 
expansion and to roam freely?” 

T  h  e    A  n  s  w  e  r  :  Absolutely  not!  It  is  not  burdensome;  it  rather  affords  a 
luminosity  and  joy  producing  a  lightness,  ease,  and  spirit,  and  ensuring  confidence  and 
security. Because if man does not believe in Divine Determining, he is compelled to bear 
a burden as heavy as the world on the shoulders of his spirit within a constricted space, 
which allows him only an insignificant independence and temporary freedom. For man is 
connected with the whole universe. He has infinite aims and desires. But since his power, 
will, and freedom are insufficient to meet a millionth of these, it may be understood how 
awesome  is  the  burden  of  the  distress  he  bears.  Thus,  belief  in  Divine  Determining 
throws that burden  in  its entirety onto the ship of Divine Determining,  allowing  him to 
roam free within its perfections with perfect ease and perfect freedom of spirit and heart. 
It only negates the petty freedom of the evil-commanding soul and smashes its Pharaoh-
like  tyranny  and  lordship,  and  its  acting  as  it  wishes.  Belief  in  Divine  Determining 
produces such pleasure and happiness it is beyond description. We shall only allude to it 
with the following comparison. 

Two men travelled to the seat of government of a king, and there entered his private 
palace, a place of rare wonders. One of them did not recognize the king and laying hands 
on everything and stealing them, wanted to settle there. However, he experienced certain 
difficulties, for he had to manage the palace and its park, oversee  its revenues, work its 
machines,  and  feed  its  strange  animals;  he  suffered  constant  distress.  The  paradise-like 
park became hell for him. He pitied everything. He could not govern them. He passed his 
time  regretfully.  Then  this  thieving,  unmannerly  man  was  cast  into  prison  as  a 
punishment. The second man recognized the king and knew himself to be his guest. He 
believed that all the matters in the park and  

 

487 

palace  occurred  through  the  regulation  of  the  law,  and  that  everything  functioned  with 
perfect ease in accordance with a programme. Leaving the difficulties to the king’s law, 
he benefited with complete enjoyment from all the pleasures of that Paradise-like garden, 
and  relying  on  the  king’s  mercy  and  the  efficacy  of  the  administrative  laws,  he  saw 
everything  as  agreeable  and  passed  his  life  in  perfect  pleasure  and  happiness.  He 
understood the meaning of the saying: “He who believes in Divine Determining is saved 
from grief.” 

FOURTH TOPIC 

I  f    y  o  u    s  a  y  :    “In  the  First  Topic  you  proved  that  everything  about  Divine 
Determining  is  good  and  beautiful.  Even  the  evil  that  comes  from  it  is  good,  and  the 
ugliness, beautiful. But the disasters and tribulations in this world refute that statement.” 

T h e  A n s w e r :  O my soul and  my  friend  who feel  severe pain out of  intense 
compassion!  The  facts  that  all  virtues  and  perfections  return  to  existence  and  that  the 
basis of all rebellion, calamities, and defects is non-existence are a proof that existence is 
pure good and  non-existence, pure evil. Since  non-existence  is pure evil, circumstances 
that either result in non-existence or give an inkling of it, also comprise evil. Therefore, 
life,  the  most  brilliant  light  of  existence,  proceeding  through  different  circumstances, 
finds  strength;  it  encounters  varying  situations  and  is  purified;  it  takes  on  numerous 
qualities  and  produces  the  desired  results,  and  enters  many  stages  and  displays 
comprehensively the impresses of the Bestower of Life’s Names. It is due to this fact that 
certain things happen to living creatures in the form of griefs, calamities, difficulties, and 
tribulations whereby the lights of existence are renewed in their lives, and the darkness of 
non-existence  draws  distant  and  their  lives  are  purified.  For  arrest,  repose,  silence, 
idleness,  rest,  and  monotony  are  all,  both  in  quality  and  as  conditions,  non-existence. 
Even the greatest pleasure is reduced to nothing by monotony. 

I  n    S  h  o  r  t  :  Since  life  displays  the  impresses  of  the  Most  Beautiful  Names, 
everything that happens to it is good. For example, an extremely rich and infinitely skilful 
person who  is proficient  in  many crafts,  for an  hour and  in return  for a wage, clothes a 
miserable wretch in a bejewelled, artistically fashioned garment. This garment he made in 
order to make the miserable man act as a model and to display the works of his art and 
his extensive wealth. He works the garment on the man, gives it various forms, and alters 
it.  In  order  to  display  every  variety  of  his  art,  he  cuts  it,  changes  it,  and  lengthens  and 
shortens  it.  Can  the  poor  man  receiving  the  wage  be  justified  if  he  says  to  the  person: 
“You are giving me trouble. You are making me bow down and stand up. By cutting and 
shortening  this  garment  which  makes  me  more  beautiful,  you  are  spoiling  my  beauty”? 
Does he have the  

 

488 

right  to  tell  him:  “You  are  acting  unkindly  and  unfairly”?  Thus,  like  him,  in  order  to 
display the impresses of His Most Beautiful Names, the All-Glorious Maker, the Peerless 
Creator,  alters  within  numerous  circumstances  the  garment  of  existence  He  clothes  on 
living  creatures,  bejewelled  with  senses  and  subtle  faculties  like  eyes,  ears,  the  reason, 
and the heart. He changes it within very many situations. Among these are circumstances 
in the form of suffering and calamity which show the meanings of some of His Names, 
and the rays of mercy within flashes of wisdom, and the subtle instances of beauty within 
those rays of mercy. 

Conclusion 

 [Five  Paragraphs  which  silenced  the  Old  Said’s  rebellious,  proud,  vain, 
conceited, and hypocritical soul, and compelled it to submit.] 

FIRST PARAGRAPH: Since things exist and they are full of art, they surely have a 
maker.  As  is  decisively  proved  in  the  Twenty-Second  Word,  if  everything  is  not  one 
person’s,  then  each  thing  becomes  as  difficult  and  problematical  as  all  things.  Since 
someone  made the earth and the  heavens and created them,  for sure that most wise and 
skilful  Being  would  not  leave  to  others  living  beings,  which  are  the  fruits,  results,  and 
aims  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  and  spoil  his  work.  Making  it  futile  and  without 
purpose, He would not hand over to others all His wise works; He would not give their 
thanks and worship to others. 

SECOND PARAGRAPH:  O my conceited soul! You resemble a grape-vine. Do not 
become  proud!  The  vine  itself  did  not  attach  the  bunches  of  grapes;  someone  else 
attached them. 

THIRD  PARAGRAPH:    O  my  hypocritical  soul!  Do  not  become  vain,  saying:  “I 
have  served  religion.”  According  to  the  meaning  of  the  saying,  “God  strengthens  this 
religion  by  means  of  sinful  men,”8  it  was  because  you  were  not  purified.  Indeed,  you 
should know yourself to be such a sinful man, and that your duty and worship is thanks 
for past bounties. For these are the function of your nature, incumbent on you due to your 
creation, and the result of art; know this and be saved from vanity and hypocrisy! 

FOURTH PARAGRAPH:  If you want knowledge of reality and true wisdom, gain 

knowledge of Almighty God. For the realities of beings are

489 

rays  of  the  Divine  Name  of  Truth  and  the  manifestations  of  His  Names  and  attributes. 
The reality of all things, whether physical, non-physical, essential, non-essential, and the 
reality of all human beings, is based on a Name and relies on Its reality. Things are not 
merely  insignificant  forms without reality. There is a  brief discussion  of this  mystery at 
the end of the Twentieth Word. O my soul! If you long for the life of this world and flee 
death,  know  certainly  that  the  conditions  you  suppose  to  be  life  are  only  the  minute  in 
which  you  are.  All  the  time  previous  to the  present  minute  and  the  things  of  the  world 
within that time are dead in the present minute. And all the time subsequent to the present 
minute and all it contains are non-existent in it, and nothing. That means the physical life 
on which you rely is only one minute. Some of the learned, even, said it was a tenth of a 
minute, rather, the passing instant. It is due to this mystery that certain saints stated that 
with regard to this world, this world is non-existent. Since it is thus, give up the physical 
life of the soul; rise to the level of life of the heart, spirit, and inner faculties; see what a 
broad sphere of life they have. For them, the past and the future, which for you are dead, 
are living; they are existent and full of life. O my soul! Like my heart, you too weep and 
cry out and say: 

I am ephemeral; I do not want another who is thus. 
I am impotent; I do not want another who is thus. 
I have surrendered my spirit to the Most Merciful; I do not want another. 
I want another, but let him be an eternal friend. 
I am a mere atom, but I desire an Everlasting Sun. 
I am nothing, yet I wish for these beings, all of them. 

FIFTH  PARAGRAPH:    This  Paragraph  occurred  to  me  in  Arabic,  and  so  it  was 
written thus. Also, it recalls one of the thirty-three degrees of reflection in the recitation, 
God is Most Great. 

God is Most Great! The Eternal, All-Knowing, All-Wise, Most Generous, Most 
Compassionate,  All-Beauteous,  the  Inscriber,  the  Pre-Eternal!  What  is  the 
reality  of  the  universe  in  its  entirety  and  in  its  parts,  and  its  pages  and  levels, 
and  what  is  the  reality  of  beings  altogether  and  singly,  in  their  existence  and 
continuation,  but  the  lines  of  the  pen  of  His  Determining  and  Decree,  and  His 
setting in order and determining, with knowledge and wisdom; what are they but 
the  skilful  inscriptions  of  His  knowledge  and  wisdom  and  regulating  and 
forming, with art and favour; the adornments of the shining hand of His art and 
favour  and  embellishing  and  illuminating,  with  grace  and  munificence;  the 
flowers of the subtleties of His favour and munificence and making known and 
loved, with mercy and bounty; the fruits of the effusions of His mercy and bounty 
and pity and compassion, with  

 

490 

beauty  and  perfection;  the  flashes  and  manifestations  of  His  beauty  and 
perfection  through  the  testimony  of  the  transience  of  the  mirrors  and  the 
ephemerality  of  the  places  of  manifestation  and  the  permanence  of  that 
transcendent,  eternal  beauty,  and  its  constant  manifestation  and  appearance 
throughout  the  passage  of  the  seasons,  centuries,  and  ages,  and  the  perpetual 
bestowal  of  bounties  throughout  the  passage  of  the  creatures  and  days  and 
people?  

Indeed, a perfect work points to one possessing intellect who performs a perfect 
act, and the perfect act points to one with understanding who possesses perfect 
names, and the perfect names point to perfect attributes, and perfect attributes 
point to perfect qualities, and the perfect qualities point to the perfection of the 
essence from which they proceed, and this is absolutely certain. 

Indeed, the ephemerality of the mirrors and death of creatures together with the 
perpetual  manifestation  and  constant  effulgence  is  the  clearest  of  proofs  that 
their  apparent  beauty  does  not  belong  to  the  places  of  manifestation;  it  is  the 
most  eloquent  statement  and  clearest  argument  for  a  transcendent  beauty,  and 
renewed  bestowal,  to  the  Necessary  Existent,  to  the  Enduring  One,  the  Loving 
One... 

O  God!  Grant  blessings  to  our  master  Muhammad  from  pre-eternity  to  post-
eternity to the number of things encompassed by Divine Knowledge, and to his 
Family and Companions, and grant them peace.

Addendum 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 

 [This short Addendum has great importance; it is beneficial for everyone.] 

The ways leading to Almighty God are truly numerous. While all true ways are taken 
from the  Qur’an, some are  shorter, safer, and  more general than others. One of these  is 
the  way  of  impotence,  poverty,  compassion,  and  reflection,  from  which,  with  my 
defective understanding, I have benefited. 

Indeed,  like  ecstatic  love,  impotence  is  a  path  which,  by  way  of  worship,  leads  to 
winning God’s love; but it is safer. Poverty too leads to the Divine Name of All-Merciful. 
And,  like  ecstatic  love,  compassion  leads  to  the  Name  of  All-Compassionate,  but  is  a 
swifter  and  broader  path.  Also  like  ecstatic  love,  reflection  leads  to  the  Name  of  All-
Wise,  but  it  is  a  richer,  broader,  and  more  brilliant  path.  This  path  consists  not  of  ten 
steps like the ‘ten subtle faculties’ of some of the Sufi orders (tariqat) employing silent 
recollection,  nor  of  seven  stages  like  the  ‘seven  souls’  of  those  practising  public 
recitation, but of four steps. It is reality , rather than a tariqat. It is Shari’a. 

However, let it not be misunderstood. It means to see one’s impotence, poverty and 
faults before Almighty God, not to fabricate them or display them to people. The method 
of this short path is to follow the Practices of the Prophet (PBUH), perform the religious 
obligations  and  give  up  serious  sins.  And  it  is  especially  to  perform  the  prescribed 
prayers correctly and with attention, and following them to say the tesbihat. 
The verse, Therefore, do not justify yourselves,9 points to the first step. 
The  verse,  And  be  not  like  those  who  forget  God,  and  He  therefore  makes  them 

forget their own selves,10 points to the second step. 

                                                

9 Qur’an, 53:32. 
10 Qur’an, 59:19. 

 

492 

The verse, Whatever good happens to you is from God, but whatever evil befalls you 

is from yourself,11 points to the third step. 

The verse, Everything will perish save His countenance,12 points to the fourth step. 
A brief explanation of these Four Steps is as follows: 
THE FIRST STEP: As the verse, Therefore, do not justify yourselves suggests, it is 
to  not  purify  the  soul.  For  on  account  of  his  nature  and  innate  disposition,  man  loves 
himself.  Indeed,  he  loves  himself  before  anything  else,  and  only  himself.  He  sacrifices 
everything other than  himself to his own  soul. He praises  himself  in  a  manner  befitting 
some object of worship. He absolves and exonerates himself from faults in the same way. 
As  far as he possibly can, he does not see faults  as being appropriate  for him, and does 
not accept them. He defends himself passionately as though worshipping himself. Even, 
using  on  himself  the  members  and  faculties  given  him  as  part of  his  nature  in  order to 
praise and glorify the True Object of Worship, he displays the meaning of the verse, Who 
takes as his god his own desires.13 He considers himself, he relies on himself, he fancies 
himself.  Thus,  his  purification  and  cleansing  at  this  stage,  in  this  step,  is  to  not  purify 
himself; it is not to absolve himself. 

SECOND  STEP:  As  the  verse,  And  be  not  like  those  who  forget  God,  and  He 
therefore makes them forget their own selves teaches, man is oblivious of himself, and is 
not aware of himself. If he thinks of death, it is in relation to others. If he sees transience 
and  decline,  he  does  not  attribute  them  to  himself.  His  evil-commanding  soul  demands 
that when it comes to inconvenience and service of others, he forgets himself, but when it 
comes to receiving his recompense, and to benefits and enjoyment, he thinks of himself, 
and takes his own part fervently. His purification, cleansing, and training at this stage is 
the reverse of this state. That is to say, when oblivious of himself, it is not to be oblivious. 
That is, to forget himself when it comes to pleasure, and ambition and greed, and to think 
of himself when it comes to death and service of others. 

THIRD  STEP:  As  the  verse,  Whatever  good  happens  to  you  is  from  God,  but 
whatever evil befalls you is from yourself teaches, the nature of the evil-commanding soul 
demands  that  it  always  considers  goodness  to  be  from  itself  and  becomes  vain  and 
conceited. Thus, in this Step, a person sees only faults, defects, impotence, and poverty in 
himself, and understands that all his good qualities and perfections are bounties bestowed 
on him by the All- 

                                                

11 Qur’an, 4:79. 
12 Qur’an, 28:88. 
13 Qur’an, 25:43; 45:23. 

 

493 

Glorious Creator. He gives thanks instead of being conceited, and offers praise instead of 
boasting. According to the meaning of the verse, Truly he succeeds who purifies it,14 his 
purification  at  this  stage  is  to  know  his  perfection  to  lie  in  imperfection,  his  power  in 
impotence, and his wealth in poverty. 

FOURTH  STEP:    As  the  verse,  Everything  will  perish  save  His  countenance 
teaches, the evil-commanding soul considers itself to be free and independent and to exist 
of  itself.  Because  of  this,  man  claims  to  possess  a  sort  of  dominicality.  He  harbours  a 
hostile rebelliousness towards his True Object of Worship. Thus, through understanding 
the following fact, he is saved from this. The fact is this: 

According  to  the  apparent  meaning  of  things,  which  looks  to  each  thing  itself, 
everything  is transitory,  lacking, accidental, non-existent. But according to the  meaning 
that signifies something other than itself and in respect of each thing being a mirror to the 
All-Glorious  Maker’s  Names  and  charged  with  various  duties,  each  is  a  witness,  it  is 
witnessed, and it is existent. The purification and cleansing of a person at this stage is as 
follows: 

In his existence he is non-existent, and in his non-existence he has existence. That is 
to say, if he values himself and attributes existence to himself, he is in a darkness of non-
existence as great as the universe. That is, if he relies on his individual existence and is 
unmindful of the True Giver of Existence, he has an individual light of existence like that 
of a fire-fly and is submerged in an endless darkness of non-existence and separation. But 
if he gives up egotism and sees that he is a mirror of the manifestations of the True Giver 
of  Existence,  he  gains  all  beings  and  an  infinite  existence.  For  he  who  finds  the 
Necessary  Existent  One,  the  manifestation  of  Whose  Names  all  beings  manifest,  finds 
everything. 

Conclusion 

The Four Steps in this way of  impotence, poverty,  compassion, and reflection  have 
been  explained  in  the  twenty-six  Words  so  far  written,  which  are  concerned  with 
knowledge of reality, the reality of the Shari’a, and the wisdom of the Qur’an. So here we 
shall allude briefly to only one or two points, as follows: 

Indeed,  this  path  is  shorter,  because  it  consists  of  four  steps.  When  impotence 
removes  the  hand  from  the  soul,  it  gives  it  directly  to  the  All-Powerful  One  of  Glory. 
Whereas, when the way of ecstatic love, the swiftest way,  

                                                

14 Qur’an, 91:9. 

 

494 

takes the hand away from the soul, it attaches it to the metaphorical beloved. Only after 
the beloved is found to be impermanent does it go to the True Beloved. 

Also, this path is much safer, because the ravings and high-flown claims of the soul 
are not present on  it. For, apart from  impotence, poverty, and defect, the soul possesses 
nothing so that it oversteps its mark. 

Also,  this  path  is  much  broader  and  more  universal.  For,  in  order  to  attain  to  a 
constant awareness of God’s presence, a person is not compelled to imagine the universe 
to  be  condemned  to  non-existence  and  to  declare:  “There  is  no  existent  but  He,”  like 
those  who  believe  in  ‘the  unity  of  existence,’  nor  to  suppose  the  universe  to  be 
condemned to imprisonment in absolute oblivion and to say, “There is nothing witnessed 
but He,” like those who believe in ‘the unity of witnessing.’ Rather, since the Qur’an has 
most explicitly pardoned the universe and released it from execution and imprisonment, 
one on this path disregards the above, and dismissing beings from working on their own 
account and employing them on account of the All-Glorious Creator, and in the duty of 
manifesting  the  Most  Beautiful  Names  and  being  mirrors  to  them,  he  considers  them 
from the point of  view of  signifying something other than themselves; and  being saved 
from  absolute  heedlessness  he  enters  the  Divine  presence  permanently;  he  finds  a  way 
leading to Almighty God in everything. 

In Short: Dismissing beings from working on account of other beings, this way is to 

not look at them as signifying themselves.

The Twenty-Seventh Word 

TREATISE ON INDEPENDENT JUDGEMENTS 
OF THE LAW (Ijtihad) 

 [Five or six years ago in an Arabic treatise, I wrote concerning a matter to do 
with  independent  judgements  on  points  of  the  Shari’a.  Now,  at  the  request  of 
two of my brothers, this Word was written about that matter in order to put in 
his place someone who had overstepped the mark in his attacks on it.] 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
If  they  had  only  referred  it  to  the  Prophet,  or  to  those  charged  with  authority 
among them, the proper investigators would have tested it from them [direct].1 

The door of independent judgements on the law is open, but at the present time there 

are six ‘Obstacles’ to entering it. 

THE FIRST:  In winter when the storms are fierce even small holes are blocked up, 
and  it  is  in  no  way  reasonable  to open  up  new  doors.  Under  the  onslaught  of  a  mighty 
flood, to make openings in the wall in order to repair it leads to being drowned. In just the 
same way, at this time of denial and the assault of the customs of Europe and the legion 
of innovations and the destruction of misguidance, to open up new doors in the citadel of 
Islam in the name of ijtihad, and make openings that will be the means of those bent on 
destruction scaling the walls and entering it, is a crime against Islam. 

THE  SECOND:    Independent  judgements  may  not  be  made  about  the  essential 
teachings  of  religion,  for  they  are  specified  and  definite.  Moreover,  they  are  like  basic 
food and sustenance. Although at this time all effort and endeavour should be expended 
on  their  being  upheld  and  raised  to  life,  they  are  being  abandoned  and  degraded.  So to 
give them up, despite their being among the theoretical matters of Islam and due to being 
the pure and sincere  

                                                

1 Qur’an, 4:83. 

 

496 

interpretations  of  the  first  generations  of  Islam  are  not  inadequate  for  the  needs  of  all 
times,  and  to  make  new  interpretations  of  the  law  in  arbitrary  fashion,  is  an  innovation 
and betrayal of Islam. 

THE THIRD:  Just as varying goods in the market are sought after according to the 
season;  they  are  in  demand  one  after  the  other,  so  in  the  exhibition  of  the  world  and 
market of human society and civilization, every century different goods are sought after 
and  are  in  demand;  they  are  displayed  in  the  market,  demand  attracts  them,  gazes  are 
turned on them, minds are drawn by them. Like at the present time the goods of politics 
and  securing  the  life  of  this  world  and  the  demand  of  philosophy  are  sought  after,  for 
example. And at the time of the first generations of Islam and in the market of that age, 
deducing from the Word of the Creator of the Heavens and the Earth His wishes and what 
He  wants  of  us  were  the  most  sought-after  goods,  and  obtaining  the  means  to  gain 
through  the  light  of  prophethood  and  the  Qur’an  eternal  happiness  in  the  world  of  the 
hereafter, which had been revealed to such a degree it could not be concealed. 

At  that  time,  since  people’s  minds,  hearts  and  spirits  were  directed  with  all  their 
strength towards understanding the wishes of the Sustainer of the Heavens and the Earth, 
the discussions, conversations, events, and circumstances of social life all looked to that. 
Since they occurred in accordance with those wishes, whoever had high ability, his heart 
and nature unconsciously received instruction in knowledge of God from everything. He 
received knowledge from the circumstances, events, and discussions which took place at 
that time. As though everything became a teacher for such a person, and inculcated in his 
nature  and  disposition  the  preparatory  knowledge  for  independent  judgements.  That 
natural  instruction  illuminated  him  to  such  a  degree  that  he  was  almost  capable  of 
interpreting  the  law  without  acquiring  the  knowledge,  to  be  illuminated  without  fire... 
Thus, when someone capable who received such natural instruction in this way began to 
work at interpreting the law, his capacity which had become like a match manifested the 
mystery of Light upon Light; he became qualified to interpret it (mujtahid) swiftly and in 
a brief time. 

At  this  time,  however,  due  to  the  domination  of  European  civilization  and  the 
supremacy of natural philosophy and the preponderance of the conditions of worldly life, 
minds and hearts have become scattered, and endeavour and favour divided. Minds have 
become strangers to non-material matters. Thus, it is because of this that if someone now 
was  to  memorize  the  Qur’an  at  the  age  of  four  and  have  the  intelligence  of  a  mujtahid 
like Sufyan ibn Uyayna, who held discussions with religious scholars at an early age, he 
would  need  ten  times  longer  than  Sufyan  to  become  qualified  to  interpret  the  law.  If 
Sufyan acquired the learning in ten years, this man would need one  

 

497 

hundred years. Because the period of Sufyan’s natural study began at the age of reason. 
His  disposition  and  abilities  were  slowly  prepared  and  illuminated;  they  took  lessons 
from everything and became like a match. But his counterpart at the present time, since 
his  thought  is  submerged  in  philosophy,  his  mind  plunged  in  politics,  and  his  heart  is 
giddy  at  the  life  of  this  world,  his  disposition  and  abilities  have  grown  distant  from 
interpretation  of  the  law.  For  sure,  they  have  become  distant  from  interpretation  of  the 
Shari’a  to  the  degree  they  have  been  preoccupied  with  the  modern  sciences,  and  have 
remained  backward  in  regard  to  it  to  the  extent  he  has  become  learned  in  the  physical 
sciences. Therefore, he may not say:  “I am as intelligent as him. Why can’t I on a level 
with him?” He does not have the right to say this, and he cannot be on a level with him. 

THE FOURTH:  Just as within a  body  is the  inclination to expand,  for  its growth 
and  development.  And,  since  it  is  from  within,  the  inclination  to  expand  is  a  being 
perfected for the body. Whereas if it is an inclination for expansion from outside it, it is 
to  rip  the  body’s  skin;  to  destroy  it;  it  is  not  expansion.  In  the  same  way,  when  the 
inclination to expand and will to interpret the law were present in those within the sphere 
of  Islam  through  the  door  of  perfect  taqwa  and  the  way  of  conforming  to the  essential 
teachings of Islam, like the righteous early generations, that was a perfection and a being 
perfected.    But  if  such  an  inclination  and  desire  come  from  those  who  give  up  the 
essentials,  prefer  the  life  of  this  world  to  that  of  the  hereafter,  and  are  tainted  with 
materialist philosophy, it is the means of destroying the body of Islam and casting off the 
chain of the Shari’a from the neck. 

THE  FIFTH:    Three  points  of  view  make  interpretation  of  the  law  earthly  at  this 
time, and prevent it being heavenly. Whereas the Shari’a is heavenly, revealed, and since 
interpretations of it make known its hidden ordinances, they also are heavenly. 

The  First:    The  wisdom  of  an  ordinance  is  one  thing,  while  the  reason  for  it  is 
something different. Wisdom and benefit are the cause of its choice, not the means of its 
being  necessitated  and  created.  And  the  reason  is  the  means  for  its  existence.  For 
example, the obligatory prayers are shortened while travelling; two rak’ats are performed. 
The  reason  for  this  permission  of  the  Shari’a  is  the  journey,  while  its  wisdom  is  the 
hardship. If there is the journey but no hardship, the prayers are still shortened. For there 
is  the  reason.  But  if  there  is  no  journey  yet  hardship,  it  may  not  be  the  reason  for 
shortening the prayers. Thus, contrary to this  fact, the view at this time  is to set up the 
benefit and wisdom in place of the reason, and to make its judgement in accordance with 
that. Such an interpretation is certainly earthly, not heavenly. 

The Second:  The view at the present time looks primarily to worldly  

 

498 

happiness, whereas the view of the Shari’a looks primarily to happiness in the hereafter, 
and  to  happiness  in  this  world  in  second  place  and  indirectly  as  the  means  to  the 
hereafter. That is to say, the view of this time is a stranger to the spirit of the Shari’a; in 
which case, it may not make interpretations in its name. 

The Third  There  is a rule: “Necessity  makes permissible what  is  forbidden.” This 
rule  is  not universal. So  long  as  it  is  not by  way  of what  is  forbidden,  necessity  makes 
licit  what  is  forbidden.  But  if  something  has  become  a  necessity  due  to  abuse  and  for 
illicit reasons, this necessity may not be the basis of ordinances permitting it, nor form an 
excuse. For example, if, through ill choice someone makes himself drunk in an unlawful 
way, according to scholars of the Shari’a, his actions act against him and he may not be 
counted as excused. If he divorces his wife, the divorce is in force. And if he commits a 
crime, he receives the punishment. But if it is not through ill choice, the divorce is not in 
force,  neither  does  he  receive  punishment.  And,  for  example,  even  if  an  alcoholic  is 
addicted  to  alcohol  to  the  degree  of  necessity,  he  may  not  say:  “It  is  a  necessity,  and 
lawful for me.” 

Thus, at this time there are many matters which have reached the degree of necessity 
and have taken on the form of a general calamity afflicting people, and which, since they 
have  arisen  from  ill  choice,  illicit  desires,  and  forbidden  acts,  may  not  be  the  basis  of 
ordinances  permitting  them  and  making  what  is  unlawful  lawful.  However,  since  those 
who  make  interpretations  at  the  present  time  make  those  necessities  the  basis  of 
ordinances  of  the  Shari’a,  their  interpretations  are  earthly,  the  products  of  their  own 
fancies, tainted by philosophy, and cannot be heavenly or revealed, or in accordance with 
the  Shari’a.  However,  if  exercise  of  authority  concerning  the  Divine  ordinances  of  the 
Creator of the Heavens and the Earth and  interference  in the worship of His servants  is 
without the Creator’s permission, that exercise of authority and interference are rejected. 
For example, a number of the  heedless and  neglectful  approve the changing of some of 
the marks of Islam like the Friday Sermon, and substituting the language of each country 
for Arabic, for two reasons: 

The  First:  “So  that  in  that  way  the  mass  of  Muslims  will  understand  current 
politics.”  But  current  politics  has  become  so  intermixed  with  lies  and  trickery  and  evil 
that it has become like the very whisperings of Satan. However, the pulpit is the seat of 
delivering Divine revelation, so political rumours do not have the right to rise to that high 
position. 

The  Second:  “The  Friday  Sermon  is  for  understanding  the  admonitions  of  certain 
Suras of the Qur’an.” Yes, if the majority of the Islamic nation conformed to the essential 
teachings  and  incontestable  matters  of  Islam  and  the  ordinances  which  are  well-known 
and carried them out, then the reading  

 

499 

teachings.  But 

its  subtle  matters  and  abstruse 

of  the  Sermon  in  the  known  language  and  the  translation  of  the  Qur’an,2  if  it  was 
possible, might have been desirable, in order to understand the theoretical matters of the 
Shari’a  and 
the  well-known, 
incontrovertible ordinances of Islam like the five daily prayers, fasting in Ramadan, and 
zakat, and the unlawfulness of murder, fornication, and wine are neglected. The ordinary 
people  are  not  in  need  of  learning  their  necessity  or  unlawfulness,  but  through 
encouragement and warning, to be reminded of those sacred decrees, and, through their 
sense  of  belief  and  feelings  for  Islam  being  stirred,  to  be  prompted,  encouraged,  and 
reminded to conform to them. However lowly and ignorant they may be, they understand 
the following brief meaning from the Qur’an and Arabic Sermon: “The preacher and the 
reciter of the Qur’an are recalling the pillars of belief and Islam, which are known by me 
and  everyone,  and  teaching  us,  and  reciting  them.”  A  longing  for  them  is  born  in  their 
hearts. What words are there in the universe which can be compared with the miraculous, 
instructive  reminders,  warnings,  and  encouragement  of  the  All-Wise  Qur’an,  which 
comes from the Sublime Throne? 

THE  SIXTH:  Since  the  great  interpreters  of  the  law  among  the  righteous  early 
generations of Islam lived close to the time of the Companions of the Prophet, the age of 
light  and  age  of  truth,  they  were  able  to  receive  a  pure  light  and  make  pure 
interpretations. But the interpreters of the law at this time look at the book of reality from 
behind  so  many  veils  and  from  such  a  long  distance  that they  can  see  even  its  clearest 
letters only with difficulty. 

If  you  say:  The  Companions  also  were  human  beings  and  not  free  of  error  and 
differences, while the means of interpretation of the law and the ordinances of the Shari’a 
is the justice and truthfulness of the Companions, on which the Islamic community have 
agreed, saying: “All the Companions were just and all spoke the truth.” 

The  Answer:  Yes,  the  absolute  majority  of  the  Companions  of  the  Prophet  were 
lovers  of  the  truth,  truthfulness,  and  justice.  For  in  that  age,  the  ugliness  of  lies  and 
falsehood  was  shown  in  all  its  ugliness  and  the  beauty  of  right  and  truthfulness  was 
shown in all its beauty in such a way that the distance between them stretched from the 
ground to the Divine Throne. There was a clear separation between them, from the depths 
of Musaylima the Liar at the lowest of the low to the degree of truthfulness of the Prophet 
Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him) at the highest of the high. Indeed, just as 
it was lying that brought Musaylima to the lowest of the low, so it  

                                                

possible. 

2 The Twenty-Fifth Word, about miraculousness, has shown that a true translation of the Qur’an is not 

 

500 

was truthfulness and right which raised Muhammad the Trustworthy to the highest of the 
high. 

Thus,  the  Companions,  who  held  elevated  sentiments  and  worshipped  good  morals 
and  were  illuminated  with  the  light of  the  conversation  of  the  Sun  of  Prophethood,  did 
not stretch out their hands to the buffoonery and filth of the lying in Musaylima’s shop, 
which was so ugly and the cause of descent, and they shrank from unbelief. So too they 
shrank  from  lying,  the  companion  of  unbelief,  and  sought  as  far  as  they  were  able  –
especially  in  relating  the  ordinances  of  the  Shari’a  and  propagating  them–  truth, 
truthfulness,  and  right,  which  are  so  fine  and  the  cause  of  pride  and  glory,  ascent  and 
progress, and were the thing most in demand from the elevated treasury of the Glory of 
Messengership,  and  which  illuminate  man’s  social  life  with  their  beauteous  splendour; 
the Companions acted in conformity with them and were desirous of them; this is certain, 
definite,  and  necessary.  Whereas  at  this  time,  the  distance  between  truth  and  lying  has 
become  so  narrow  that they  are  now  quite  simply  shoulder  to  shoulder.  It  is  extremely 
easy to pass from truthfulness to lying. Lying is even preferred to truthfulness due to the 
propaganda of politics and diplomacy. And so, if the most ugly and the finest things are 
sold  in  the  same  shop  for  the  same  price,  certainly  the  jewel  of  truthfulness  and  right, 
which  is  most  elevated  and  penetrates  to  the  essence  of  reality,  will  not  be  obtained 
blindly, relying on the word and skill of the shopkeeper. 

Conclusion 

Sacred laws change according to the ages. Indeed, in one age different prophets may 
come,  and  they  have  come.  Since  subsequent  to  the  Seal  of  the  Prophets,  his  Greater 
Shari’a is sufficient for all peoples in every age, no need has remained for different laws. 
However, in secondary  matters, the need  for different schools  has persisted to a degree. 
Just as clothes change with the change of the seasons and medicines change according to 
dispositions,  so  sacred  laws  change  according  to  the  ages,  and  their  ordinances  change 
according to the capacities of peoples. Because the secondary  matters of the ordinances 
of the Shari’a  look to human circumstances; they come according to them, and are  like 
medicine. 

At  the  time  of  the  early  prophets,  since  social  classes  were  far  apart  and  men’s 
characters were both somewhat coarse and violent, and their  minds, primitive and close 
to  nomadism,  the  laws  at  that  time  came  all  in  different  forms,  appropriate  to  their 
conditions. There were even different prophets  

 

501 

and laws in the same continent in the same century. Then, since with the coming of the 
Prophet of the end of time,  man as though advanced  from the primary to the secondary 
stage,  and  through  numerous  revolutions  and  upheavals  reached  a  position  at  which  all 
the human peoples could receive a single lesson and listen to a single teacher and act in 
accordance  with  a  single  law,  no  need  remained  for  different  laws,  neither  was  there 
necessity  for  different  teachers.  But  because  they  were  not  all  at  completely  the  same 
level  and  did  not  proceed  in  the  same  sort  of  social  life,  the  schools  of  law  became 
numerous. If, like students of a school of higher education, the vast majority of mankind 
were  clothed  in  the  same  sort  of  social  life  and  attained  the  same  level,  then  all  the 
schools  could  be  united.  But  just  as  the  state  of  the  world  does  not  permit  that,  so  the 
schools of law cannot be the same. 

If you say: The truth is one; how can the different ordinances of the four and twelve 

schools be true? 

The  Answer:  The  same  water  governs  in  five  different  ways  in  five  ill  people  of 
different  disposition,  thus:  for  one,  the  water  is  a  cure  for  his  illness,  and  according  to 
medicine,  necessary.  For  another,  it  is  like  poison  for  his  sickness  and  harmful,  and 
medically prohibited. For another, it causes a small amount of harm, and is reprehensible 
medically.  For another the water is  beneficial  and without harm; according to medicine 
that is sunna for him. And for yet another it is neither harmful nor beneficial; he can drink 
it  with  good  health,  and  for  him  it  is  medically  permissible.  Thus,  here  the  truth  has 
become numerous; all five are true. Are you able to say: “The water is only a cure, only 
necessary, and it governs in no other way?” 

Similarly,  impelled  by  Divine  wisdom,  the  Divine  ordinances  change  according  to 
the schools of law and those who follow them, and they change as truth, and all are true 
and  right.  For  example,  since,  in  accordance  with  Divine  wisdom  and  determining,  the 
majority of those who follow Imam Shafi’i are closer to village life and nomadism than 
the Hanafis, and are lacking in social life, which makes the community like a single body, 
each person recites the Fatiha behind the prayer-leader so as to himself express his pains 
at the Court of the Dispenser of Needs and utter his private wishes. And this is absolutely 
right and pure wisdom. However, since most Islamic governments favoured the school of 
Imam-i  A’zam,  the  great  majority  of  those  who  follow  that  school  are  closer  to 
civilization and town  life and  more  fitted  for social  life. Thus, the community  becomes 
like a single individual and one man speaks in the name of all; all affirm him with their 
hearts and bind their hearts to his and his word becomes the word of all; according to the 
Hanafi school, the Fatiha is not recited behind the prayer-leader. And its not being recited 
is absolutely right and pure wisdom. 

And, for example, since through forming a barrier against the assaults of  

 

502 

nature,  the  Shari’a  modifies  it  and  trains  the  evil-commanding  soul,  according  to  the 
Shafi’i  school,  most  of  whose  followers  are  villagers,  semi-nomadic,  and  occupied  in 
manual labour: “Ablutions are spoilt by touching a woman; the slightest uncleanliness is 
harmful.” While according to the Hanafi School, since the great majority of it followers 
have  entered  social  life  and  become  ‘semi-civilized:’  “Touching  women  does  not  spoil 
the ablutions; there is licence for a small amount of uncleanliness.” 

Now we shall consider a  manual worker and a gentleman. Due to his craft and the 
manner of his livelihood, a worker is afflicted with mixing with and being in contact with 
women who are canonically strangers to him. Since he sits at the same hearth as them and 
is involved with unclean things, nature and his evil-commanding soul find the field empty 
and may attack him. Therefore, in order to form a barrier against such attacks, the Shari’a 
states  concerning  them:  “Your  ablutions  will  be  spoilt;  do  not  touch  the  women.  Your 
prayers  will  be  invalid;  do  not  be  tainted.”  A  heavenly  voice  rings  in  his  spiritual  ears. 
Whereas,  in  accordance  with  social  custom  and  in  the  name  of  common  morality,  the 
gentleman  –on  condition  he  is  honourable–  is  not  afflicted  with  being  in  contact  with 
women  who  are  canonically  strangers  to  him,  and  in  the  name  of  cleanliness  of 
civilization, he is not tainted to any degree with unclean things. Therefore, in the Hanafi 
school, the Shari’a has not shown him harshness and censure; it has shown its permissive 
side, and lightened it. “If your hand has been touched, your ablutions are not spoilt. If you 
are  ashamed  and  do  not  perform  the  istinja  in  public,  there  is  no  harm  in  it.  A  small 
amount of uncleanliness is permitted.” It saves him from scruples. Thus, two drops from 
the ocean as examples for you. Make analogies with them, and if you can, balance them 
on the scales of the Shari’a in this way, with the balance of Sha’rani’s Mizan.3 

Glory be unto You, we have no knowledge save that which You have taught us; 
indeed You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.4 
O God! Grant blessings and peace to the one in whom were embodied the lights 
of Your love through the beauty of Your attributes; the comprehensive mirror to 
the  manifestations  of  Your  Most  Beautiful  Names;  in  whom  was  focussed  the 
rays  of  Your  love  for  the  art  which  is  in  Your  creatures;  the  most  perfect  and 
wonderful of Your artefacts, who was a sample of the perfections of Your art and 
an index of the beauties of Your inscriptions; and who reflected the subtleties of 
Your  love  and  Your  desire  that  Your  art  be  appreciated;  the  most  elevated 
herald of Your fine art, who proclaimed in resounding voice admiration

for the beauty of Your inscriptions, the most wonderful praiser of the perfections 
of  Your  art;  who  reflected  together  in  his  being  the  varieties  of  Your  love  and 
Your  appreciation  for  the  good  morals  of  your  creatures  and  the  subtleties  of 
Your  artefacts’  qualities,  comprehending  all  fine  conduct  and  good  morality 
through Your favour and the subtleties of commendable attributes through Your 
grace;  who  was  the  most  excellent  criterion  and  measure  of  everything  You 
mention in Your Criterion of Truth and Falsehood, the Qur’an, those whom You 
love  from  among  the  righteous,  the  patient,  the  believers,  those  who  fear  You, 
who turn to You, and who repent, and all the classes of those whom You infuse 
with  life  and  honour  through  Your  love  in  Your  Criterion  of  Truth  and 
Falsehood, until they become as the leader of those whom You love; the master 
of  those  beloved  by  You  and  chief  of  Your  beloveds;  and  grant  blessings  and 
peace  to  all  his  Family  and  Companions  and  brothers.  Amen.  Through  Your 
mercy, O Most Merciful of the Merciful!

Addendum to the Twenty-Seventh Word 
On the Companions of the Prophet (PBUH) 

Like Mawlana Jami, I say, 

O Messenger of God! If only like the dog of the Companions of the Cave, 
I could be in Paradise among your Companions. 
Is it right that their dog is in Paradise while I am in Hell? 
He was the dog of those Companions; I am the dog of yours! 

In His Name, be He glorified! 
And there is nothing but it glorifies Him with praise. 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
Muhammad is the Messenger of God, and those who are with him are strong against 

the unbelievers, [but] compassionate amongst each other.5 

You  Ask:    There  are  some  narrations  which  say:  “At  a  time  when  innovations  are 
rife, some of the righteous from among the believers and those who fear God will be on a 
level with the Companions, or of even greater virtue.” Are these narrations sound? And if 
so, what is their true meaning? 

The Answer:  The consensus of the Sunnis, the Ahl al-Sunna wa’l-Jama’at, that after 
the  prophets  the  most  virtuous  of  mankind  are  the  Companions,  is  a  certain  proof  that 
those that  are  sound out of  those  narrations  refer to  minor  virtues.  For  in  minor  virtues 
and  particular  perfections  a  quality  may  be  deemed  preferable  to that  which  is  superior 
and  in  fact  preferable.  But  from  the  point  of  view  of  general  virtue  the  Companions 
cannot be reached, who are the subject of Divine praise at the end of Sura al-Fath, and are 
praised and applauded in the Torah, Gospels, and Qur’an. For now, we shall explain three 
points of wisdom concerning this truth, which comprise three reasons, out of very many 
reasons and instances of wisdom. 

                                                

5 Qur’an, 48:29. 

 

505 

First Instance of Wisdom:  The conversation of the Prophet was such an elixir that 
someone who experienced it for one minute received lights of reality equivalent to years 
of spiritual journeying. For in conversation there is reflection and a being coloured. It is 
well-known that through reflection and following and imitating, and through the sublime 
light of prophethood, a truly exalted level may be reached; –like through allegiance to his 
sovereign  and  following  him,  a  sultan’s  servant  may  rise  to  a  position  so  high  a  king 
cannot rise to it. It is due to this mystery that the greatest saints cannot reach the level of 
the  Companions.  Even  saints  like  Jalaluddin  Suyuti,  who  conversed  many  times  with 
God’s Noble Messenger (PBUH) while awake, even if they do this and are honoured in 
this  world  with  his  company,  they  still  cannot  reach  the  Companions.  For  through  the 
light of Muhammad’s (PBUH) prophethood, the Companions’ conversation was with him 
as  Prophet.  While  the  saints  saw  him  (PBUH)  after  his  death  and  conversed  with  him 
(PBUH)  through  the  light  of  his  sainthood.  That  is  to  say,  the  personification  and 
appearance  of  God’s  Noble  Messenger  (PBUH)  is  in  respect  of  his  sainthood,  not  in 
regard  to  his  prophethood.  Since  that  is  so,  however  much  higher  the  level  of 
prophethood  is  to  that  of  sainthood,  one  should  differentiate  between  the  two 
conversations to that degree. 

Just how luminous an elixir was the Prophet’s company may be understood through 
the  following:  a  primitive  man  so  hard-hearted  and  savage  he  buried  his  daughter  alive 
would come and be honoured with the conversation of the Prophet for an hour, and would 
acquire such kindness and compassion that he would not step on an ant. And an ignorant 
savage would converse with the Prophet for a day, then go to lands like China and India 
and instruct civilized peoples in the realities and guide them in perfections. 

Second Reason:  As is explained and proved in the discussion of interpretation of the 
law  in  the  Twenty-Seventh  Word,  the  vast  majority  of  the  Companions  were  at  the 
highest  level  of  human  perfections.  For  at  that  time  in  the  mighty  revolution  of  Islam, 
good and truth appeared in all their beauty, and evil and falsehood, in all their ugliness, 
and they were felt physically. Such a difference was apparent between good and evil and 
such a distance opened up between truth and falsehood that they drew as distant from one 
another as belief is from unbelief, and even Hell is from Paradise. The Companions, who 
by  nature  possessed  elevated  emotions,  were  captivated  by  the  highest  morality,  and 
inclined towards dignity and virtue, would not voluntarily stretch out their hands to evil 
and  falsehood,  and  so  fall  to  the  level  of  Musaylima  the  Liar  and  his  ridiculous 
utterances. For he was the herald of falsehood, evil, and lies, and their embodiment. Their 
characters  demanded  that  they  looked  to  the  rank  of  the  perfections,  those  of  God’s 
Beloved  (PBUH)  at  the  highest  of  the  high,  who  was  the  herald  and  embodiment  of 
truthfulness, good, and right, and that they hastened in that way with all their strength and 
endeavour. 

 

506 

For example, it sometimes happens that in the market of human civilization and shop 
of social life, everyone flees in disgust from the fearsome results and ugly consequences 
of  certain  things,  like  from  a  deadly  poison,  let  alone  buying  them,  while  the  beautiful 
results and valuable consequences of certain other things and of immaterial goods attract 
the  general  view  and  demand  to  themselves  like  a  universal  panacea  and  a  sparkling 
brilliant; everyone tries their utmost to buy them. In just the same way, in the Era of Bliss 
in the market of human social life, since goods like lying, evil, and unbelief gave rise to 
results  like  everlasting  misery  and  base  buffoons  like  Musaylima  the  Liar,  it  is  certain 
and clear that the Companions, who were captivated by elevated characteristics and love 
of  exalted  things,  would  flee  from  them  with  loathing  as  from  fatal  poison.  And  of  a 
necessity,  the  Companions,  with  their  pure  natures  and  praiseworthy  characteristics, 
would, with all their strength, emotions, and  faculties,  be desirous of and customers  for 
truth, truthfulness and  belief, which  yielded results  like eternal  happiness and  luminous 
fruits like God’s Noble Messenger (PBUH), as though for the most effective panacea and 
precious diamond. However, after that time, the distance between truthfulness and lying 
has  gradually  and  by  degrees  diminished,  until  they  have  become  shoulder  to  shoulder. 
Having begun to be sold together in the same shop, social morality has become corrupted. 
The  propaganda  of  politics  has  caused  greater  demand  for  lying.  At  a  time  when  the 
awesome  ugliness  of  lying  has  begun  to  be  concealed  and  the  shining  beauty  of 
truthfulness has begun not to be apparent, who can attain to the strength, constancy, and 
taqwa of the Companions in the matters of justice, truthfulness, exaltedness, and right, or 
surpass their level? I shall explain something which occurred to me which will illuminate 
this to a degree. It was like this:  

One  time,  it  occurred  to  me,  why  could  wondrous  individuals  like  Muhyiddin  al-
’Arabi  not attain to the  levels of the Companions? Then, while saying,  “Glory be to my 
Sustainer, the Most High” during the prayers, the meaning of the phrase was unfolded to 
me. Not in its complete meaning, but its reality in part became apparent to me. I said in 
my heart: “If only I could perform one of the five daily prayers in the same way as this 
phrase, it would be better than a year’s worship.” After the prayers I understood that that 
thought and state was guidance indicating that the Companions’ degree in worship could 
not be reached. In that mighty social revolution brought about by the lights of the Qur’an, 
while  opposites  were  separated  from  one  another,  and  evils  together  with  all  their 
darkness, details and all who followed them, and good and perfections together with all 
their lights and results came face to face – at such an exciting time, all glorifications of 
God and recitations of His Names expressed all the levels of their meanings freshly and 
newly  and  in  a  young  and  unfaded  fashion.  So  too,  under  the  crashing  of  that  mighty 
revolution all the senses and subtle inner faculties of people were awakened,  

 

507 

even  senses  like  those  of  fancy  and  imagination,  in  an  awakened  and  aware  state, 
received  the  numerous  meanings  of  those  recitations  and  glorifications  in  accordance 
with their own perceptions, and absorbed them. 

Thus, due to this wisdom, when the Companions, whose senses were awakened and 
subtle  faculties,  alert,  uttered  those  blessed  words  comprising  the  lights  of  belief  and 
glorification,  they  did  so  in  all  their  meaning  and  they  partook  of  them  with  all  their 
senses.  However,  after that  revolution  and  upheaval,  the  subtle  faculties  have  gradually 
sunk  into  sleep  and  the  senses  fallen  from  that  point  of  realities  into  heedlessness;  like 
fruits, under the veil of familiarity, those blessed words have gradually lost their delicacy 
and freshness. Simply, as though drying up through the air of superficiality, only a little 
freshness  remains,  and  this  may  be  restored  to  its  former  state  only  through  drastic 
surgery  of  a  reflective  and  reasoning  kind.  Thus,  it  is  because  of  this  that  another  can 
reach  the  virtue  and  level  the  Companions  attained  to  in  forty  minutes,  only  in  forty 
years. 

Third  Reason:  As  is  proved  in  the  Twelfth,  Twenty-Fourth,  and  Twenty-Fifth 
Words,  the  comparison  of  prophethood  and  sainthood  is  that  of  the  sun  itself  and  the 
sun’s  image  as  it  appears  in  mirrors.  Thus,  however  much  higher  the  sphere  of 
prophethood is than that of sainthood, the servants of the sphere of prophethood and the 
Companions, the stars of that Sun, have to be superior to the righteous in the sphere of 
sainthood  to  the  same  degree.  The  legacy  of  prophethood  and  veracity,  which  is  the 
supreme sainthood, is the sainthood of the Companions; even if a saint attains to this, he 
still cannot reach the level of the Companions, the first rank. We shall explain three out 
of the numerous aspects of this Third Reason. 

First Aspect: The Companions cannot be reached in interpretation of the law, that is, 
in deducing its ordinances, that is, in understanding what pleases Almighty God from His 
Word.  Because  that  mighty  Divine  revolution  revolved  on  understanding  the  dominical 
wishes  and  Divine  ordinances.  All  minds  were  turned  towards  deducing  the  Divine 
ordinances. All hearts were eager to know “What does our Sustainer want from us?” All 
that  happened  at  that  time  did  so  in  a  way  that  made  this  known  and  understood.  The 
discussions  of  the  time  concerned  them.  Thus,  since  everything  and  all  situations  and 
discussions and conversations and stories occurred in such a way as to give some sort of 
instruction  in  these  meanings,  and  since  this  perfected  the  Companions’  capacities  and 
illuminated  their  minds,  and  since  their  ability  to  interpret  the  law  and  deduce  its 
ordinances was ready to be lit up like a match, someone at this time with the intelligence 
and capacity of the Companions could not reach in ten years or perhaps in a hundred, the 
level  of  deduction  and  interpretation  they  reached  in  a  day  or  a  month.  Because  now, 
worldly  happiness  is  the  focus  of  attention  in  place  of  eternal  happiness.  Mankind’s 
attention and view is directed towards different goals.  

 

508 

Since  the  struggle  for  livelihood  together  with  lack  of  reliance  on  God  has  bewildered 
man’s spirit, and Naturalist and Materialist philosophies have blinded his intellect, just as 
the social environment does not strengthen a person’s mind and capacity in the matter of 
interpreting the Divine law, so it confuses and scatters them. We proved in the discussion 
on  interpretation  of  the  law  in  the  Twenty-Seventh  Word  in  the  comparison  between 
Sufyan ibn Uyayna and someone of his intelligence today that the other person could not 
acquire in a hundred years what Sufyan acquired in ten. 

Second Aspect: The level of the Companions in closeness to God cannot be attained 
with the  feet of sainthood. For Almighty God  is  infinitely  close to us; closer to us than 
everything,  but  we  are  infinitely  distant  from  Him.  Divine  proximity  may  be  gained  in 
two ways: 

The  First  is  through  the  unfolding  of  Divine  immediacy,  to  which  the  Divine 
proximity  in  prophethood  looks,  and  which  the  Companions  manifested  through  the 
legacy of prophethood and conversation of the Prophet. 

The Second Way is to traverse the degrees of our distance from God and be honoured 
with  Divine  proximity  to  an  extent.  Most  of  the  spiritual  voyaging  of  sainthood  is 
according  to  this,  and  illumination  through  the  self  and  through  the  outside  world 
proceeds in this way. 

Thus, the first way is purely given, it is not acquired; it is attraction, the drawing of 
the Most Merciful One, and it is being loved by Him. The path is short, but very severe, 
very elevated, very pure, and without shadow. The other is acquired, long, and in shadow. 
Even  if  its  strange  wonders  are  many,  it  cannot  reach  the  first  in  regard  to  quality  and 
Divine proximity. For example, there are two ways of reaching yesterday. The first is not 
to be subject to the course of time. Through a sacred power, it is to rise above time, and 
see  yesterday  as  present  like  today.  The  second  is  to traverse  the  distance  of  a  year,  to 
travel  and  turn,  and  come  to  yesterday.  But  still  yesterday  cannot  be  held;  it  leaves  the 
person and departs. In just the same way, there are two ways of passing from the apparent 
to reality. The first is to be carried away directly on the attraction of reality, and, without 
entering the intermediate realm of the sufi way, to find reality within the apparent itself. 
The  second  is  to  pass  through  many  levels  through  spiritual  journeying.  For  sure,  the 
saints are successful in annihilating the soul and kill the evil-commanding soul, but they 
still  cannot  reach  the  Companions.  Because,  since  the  Companions’  souls  had  been 
purified  and  cleansed,  through  the  many  faculties  within  the  soul,  they  manifested  to  a 
greater  degree the  varieties  of  worship,  and  thanks,  and  praise.  After  the  soul  has  been 
annihilated, the worship of the saints acquires a simpleness and plainness. 

Third Aspect: The Companions cannot be reached in regard to virtuous actions and  

good deeds pertaining to the hereafter. Because, just as in certain  

 

509 

conditions in a frightening and important post, a soldier may gain in one hour’s watch the 
virtue of a year’s worship, and by being hit by a bullet may rise in one minute to a station 
similar to a degree of sainthood which can only by gained in at least forty years; so too, 
the Companions’ service in the establishment of Islam and propagating the decrees of the 
Qur’an and their declaring war on the whole world for Islam was so elevated that others 
cannot reach one minute of it in a year. It may even be said that in that sacred service all 
their minutes were like that one minute of the martyred soldier. All their hours were like 
the  one  hour’s  watch  of  a  faithful  soldier  in  some  terrifying  post  in  which  the  acts  are 
few, but the recompense great and value high.  

Indeed, since the Companions formed the first rank in the establishment of Islam and 
spreading  of  the  lights  of  the  Qur’an,  in  accordance  with  the  rule  ‘the  cause  is  like  the 
doer,’  a  share  of  all  the  good  works  of  all  the  Islamic  community  passes  to them.  The 
Islamic community saying “O God! Grant blessings to our master Muhammad and to his 
Family and Companions” shows that the Companions receive a share of the good works 
of their whole community. 

Furthermore,  just  as  an  insignificant  characteristic  in  the  root  of  a  tree  takes  on  a 
large form in the tree’s branches, and is larger than the largest branch; and just as a small 
protuberance at the beginning gradually forms a mass; and just as an excess the size of a 
needle point at a central point may become more than a metre at the circumference of the 
circle,  just  like  these  four  examples,  since  the  Companions  were  from  the  roots  and 
foundations of the luminous tree of Islam, and were at the beginning of luminous lines of 
the structure of Islam, and were  from  among the  leaders of the Islamic community and 
were  the  first  of  their  number,  and  since  they  were  close  to  the  centre  of  the  Sun  of 
Prophethood and Lamp of Reality, a few of their actions were many and their small acts 
of service, great. To reach their level necessitates being a true Companion. 

O God! Grant blessings to our master Muhammad, who said: “My Companions 
are  like  the  stars,  whichever  of  them  you  follow,  you  will  be  rightly  guided,”6 
and, “The best of centuries is my century,”7 and to his Family and Companions, 
and grant them peace. 

Glory be unto You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught us; 
indeed, You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.8

QUESTION:    It  is  said,  the  Companions  saw  God’s  Noble  Messenger  (Peace  and 
blessings  be  upon  him),  then  they  believed.  However  we  have  believed  without  seeing 
him,  in  which  case  our  belief  is  stronger.  Also,  there  are  narrations  mentioning  the 
strength of our belief, are there not? 

THE ANSWER:  At that time, when all ideas were opposed and hostile to the truths 
of Islam, the Companions believed so strongly –sometimes on only seeing the person of 
God’s Messenger (PBUH) and without miracles– that all the generally held ideas in the 
world  did  not  shake  them.  Let  alone  doubts, they  did  not  even  cause  some  of  them  the 
slightest anxiety or scruple. You are comparing your belief with that of the Companions, 
but how can there be any comparison? For despite your seeing with the mind’s eye, not 
the Messenger’s (PBUH) humanity and bodily form, which was the seed of the Tuba-tree 
of  his  prophethood,  but  through  all  the  lights  of  Islam  and  truths  of  the  Qur’an,  his 
luminous,  magnificent collective personality, encompassed  by a thousand  miracles,  you 
waver and fall into doubt at the word of a European philosopher. Yet due to their belief, 
the Companions did  not waver  in the  face of the  attacks of the entire world of unbelief 
and of the Christians, Jews, and philosophers? And how can you compare the intense fear 
of  God  of  the  Companions  and  their  complete  righteousness,  which  demonstrated  the 
strength  of  their  belief  and  proceeded  from  it,  and  your  dull  belief,  which  due  to  your 
extreme  weakness  does  not  impel  you  to  perform  even  the  obligatory  practices 
completely, O you who make such a claim!? However, the Hadith the meaning of which 
is: “Those at the end of time who do not see me and believe, are more acceptable,”9 refers 
to particular virtues. It concerns certain special  individuals. Our discussion, however,  is 
in regard to general virtue and the majority. 

SECOND  QUESTION:    They  say  that  the  saints  and  possessors  of  perfection 
abandoned  the  world.  It  even  says  in  a  Hadith:  “Love  of  this  world  is  the  source of  all 
error.”10  Whereas  the  Companions  were  very  involved  in  the  world.  It  was  not 
abandoning the world, some of them were ahead of the civilized of that time, even. How 
is  it that  you say that even the  least of  such Companions was of greater worth than the 
greatest saint? 

THE ANSWER:  It has been proved decisively in the Second and Third Stopping-
Places of the Thirty-Second  Word that to love the  face of the world which  looks to the 
hereafter and that which looks to the Divine Names is not the cause of loss, but the means 
to perfection and attainment, and however far one goes in those two faces, the further one 
goes in worship and knowledge of God. The world of the Companions was in those two 
faces. They saw this world as the arable field of the hereafter, and sowed

10 al-Munawi, Fayd al-Qadir, iii, 368, No: 3662. 

 

511 

and reaped  it. They saw  beings as the  mirrors of the Divine Names, and gazed on them 
yearningly.  As  for the transience of the world, that is  its transitory  face, which  looks to 
man’s base desires. 

THIRD  QUESTION:    The  sufi  paths  are  the  ways  of  reality.  Some  of  the  heroes 
and leaders of the Naqshbandi Order, which is claimed to be the most famous, the most 
elevated, and the highway among the sufi ways, defined its basis as follows. They said: 
On  the  Naqshbandi  way  four  ‘abandonings’  are  necessary:  abandoning  the  world, 
abandoning the  hereafter, abandoning existence, and abandoning abandoning. That  is to 
say, on the Naqshi way one has to give up four things: both give up this world; and, on 
account of the  soul, not make even the  hereafter one’s true aim;  forget one’s existence; 
and  in  order  not to  become  vain  and  proud,  not  think  about these  acts  of  renunciation. 
That means true knowledge of God and human perfections are attained through giving up 
what is other than God? 

THE ANSWER:  If man consisted of only a heart, it would be necessary to give up 
everything other than God, and to leave behind even the Divine Names and attributes and 
bind one’s heart to the Divine Essence alone. But man possesses many senses and subtle 
faculties charged with duties, like the mind, spirit, soul, and others. The perfect man is he 
who,  driving  all  those  subtle  senses  towards  reality  on  the  different  ways  of  worship 
particular  to  them,  marches  heroically  like  the  Companions  in  a  broad  arena  and  rich 
fashion towards the goal, with the heart as commander and the subtle faculties as soldiers. 
For the heart to abandon its soldiers in order to save only itself and to proceed on its own 
is the cause not of pride, but of distress. 

FOURTH  QUESTION:    Where  does  the  claim  of  the  Companions’  superiority 
spring  from?  And  who  put  it  forward?  Why  should  this  matter  be  made  the  subject  of 
discussion  at  this  time?  Also,  why  is  there  this  claim  of  equality  with  the  great 
interpreters of the law? 

THE ANSWER:  There are two groups who say these things. Some are the sincere 
religious  scholars  and  men  of  religion  who,  seeing  certain  Hadiths,  open  up  such 
discussions in order to encourage and hearten the pious and the upright at this time. We 
do not have anything to say to them. They are anyway few and are quickly made aware. 
The  other  group,  however,  consists  of  most  fearsome,  conceited  people  who  want  to 
spread their denial of the schools of law by claiming equality with the great interpreters 
of  the  law,  and  to  further  their  irreligion  by  claiming  equality  with  the  Companions. 
Because  firstly,  those  people  of  misguidance  have  become  depraved,  and  have  become 
addicted to depravity, and cannot carry out the obligations of the Shari’a, since they form 
an obstacle to their depravity. In order to find a pretext for themselves, they say:  “These 
questions  may  be  interpreted.  The  schools  of  law  are  opposed  to  each  other  in  these 
matters.  

 

512 

And the interpreters of the law were human beings like us, and may have made mistakes. 
In which case, like them we shall interpret the Divine law and perform our worship as we 
wish.  Why should we  be compelled to follow them?” Thus, due to these Satanic wiles, 
these wretches put themselves outside the  fold of the schools of  law. It is demonstrated 
clearly in the Twenty-Seventh Word just how baseless and rotten these claims are, so we 
refer you to that. 

Secondly; that group of the people of misguidance saw that the matter does not end 
with the interpreters of the law, for what lay on their shoulders were only the theoretical 
matters  of  religion.  Whereas  this  group  wants  to  give  up  and  change  the  essential 
teachings of religion. If they  say:  “We  are  better than them,” the  matter does not finish 
there.  For  interpreters  of  the  law  may  interfere  in  theoretical  matters  and  in  secondary 
matters which are not categorical, but these people of misguidance who follow no school 
of law want to mix their ideas in the essentials of religion as well, and to change matters 
which  are  not  capable  of  being  changed,  and  to  oppose  the  incontrovertible  pillars  of 
Islam. And so they are bound to attack the Companions, who are the bearers and supports 
of the essentials of religion.  Alas! It has  been proved decisively  in the Twenty-Seventh 
Word that not animals in human form like them, but true human beings and the greatest 
of the saints even, who are the  most perfect of true  human  beings, cannot win the case 
claiming equality with the least of the Companions. 

O God! Grant blessings and peace to Your Messenger, who said: “Do not insult 
my  Companions!  By  the  One  in  Whose  hand  is  my  self,  if  one  of  you  were  to 
spend gold equivalent to Mt. Uhud, he could not attain to the equivalent of two 
handfuls that one of them spent, or even half that.”11

The Twenty-Eighth Word 

 [This Word is about Paradise and consists of two Stations. The First indicates 
some  of  the  subtle  wonders  of  Paradise.  However,  it  does  not  prove  the 
existence  of  Paradise,  since  this  has  been  proved  in  brilliant  fashion  by  the 
twelve decisive Truths of the Tenth Word and by the firm and clear consecutive 
arguments in Arabic which form the basis and summary of the Tenth Word and 
the Second Station of this Word. This Station discusses in question and answer 
form  a  number  of  the  aspects  of  Paradise  which  have  been  the  cause  of 
criticism. If Divine assistance is forthcoming, a great Word will later be written 
about that mighty truth. God willing.] 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
And give glad tidings to those  who believe and act righteously that theirs shall 
be  gardens  beneath  which  flow  rivers.  Everytime  they  are  fed  with  fruits 
therefrom, they will say: “Why, this is what we were fed with before.” For they 
will be given things in similitude. And they shall have therein spouses pure, and 
shall abide there for ever.1 

The brief answers to a number of questions about eternal Paradise. 
The  descriptions  of  the  Qur’an’s  verses  about  Paradise,  which  are  more  beautiful 
than Paradise, more lovely than the houris, and sweeter than the water of Salsabil, leave 
nothing to be said about it so that anyone should say it. However, in order to bring closer 
to  the  understanding  those  shining,  pre-eternal,  post-eternal,  elevated  and  exquisite 
verses, we shall mention a number of steps, and, as samples of that Qur’anic Paradise, a 
number  of  fine  points  which  are  like  samples  of  its  flowers.  We  shall  point  to  these 
through  five  allusive  questions  and  answers.  Indeed,  Paradise  is  the  means  both  to  all 
spiritual and non-physical pleasures, and to all physical pleasures. 

QUESTION:    What  connection  with  eternity  and  Paradise  has  faulty,  deficient, 

changing, unstable, and suffering corporeality? Since the spirit has  

                                                

1 Qur’an, 2:25. 

 

514 

elevated  pleasures,  that  is  sufficient.  Why  is  bodily  resurrection  necessary  for  bodily 
pleasures? 

THE ANSWER: Because,  just as  in relation to water, air, and  light, earth is dense 
and dark, but since  it  is the source and  means of  all the  varieties of Divine  artefacts,  in 
meaning  it  rises  above  the  other  elements;  and  just  as  in  regard  to  the  mystery  of  its 
comprehensiveness and on condition it is purified, the human soul, which is also dense, 
rises above all the other human subtle faculties; so too corporeality is the richest and most 
comprehensive  and  all-embracing  mirror to the  manifestation  of  the  Divine  Names.  All 
the  tools  and  instruments  for  measuring  the  contents  of  the  treasuries  of  mercy  and 
reckoning their balances lie in corporeality. For example, if scales to the number of sorts 
of  food and their pleasures did  not originate in the sense of taste in the tongue, it could 
not  taste  and  weigh  them  all  up,  and  recognize  and  experience  them.  Also,  the 
instruments  for  experiencing  and  knowing  the  manifestations  of  most  of  the  Divine 
Names, and tasting and recognizing them, again lie in corporeality. And the faculties for 
experiencing all the infinitely various pleasures are also in corporeality. 

As  is proved  in the Eleventh  Word, it  is understood clearly  from the disposition of 
the  universe  and  man’s  comprehensiveness  that  the  universe’s  Maker  wants  to  make 
known  all  the  treasuries  of  His  mercy,  and  all  the  manifestations  of  His  Names,  and  to 
make experienced all the varieties of His bounties. The abode of bliss, therefore, which is 
a  vast  pool  formed  from  the  flood  of  the  universe  and  a  great  exhibition  of  the  textiles 
woven on the loom of the universe and an everlasting store of the crops produced in the 
arable field of this world, will resemble the universe to a degree. And it will preserve all 
its  fundamental  matters,  both  corporeal  and  spiritual.  Its  All-Wise  Maker,  the  Most 
Compassionate One, will also give as recompense for the duties of the physical tools and 
instruments, pleasures worthy of them; and to His servants, as a wage and reward for the 
particular  worship  of  each.  Otherwise  a  situation  would  occur  that  was  contrary  to  His 
wisdom,  justice, and  mercy, which  is  in  no way  fitting  for the beauty of His  mercy  and 
perfection of His justice, and in no way compatible with them. 

QUESTION:    If  a  body  is  living,  its  parts  are  constantly  being  formed  and 
dissolved;  it  is doomed to extinction and cannot be eternal. Eating  and drinking are  for 
the  perpetuation  of  the  individual,  and  sexual  relations  are  for  the  perpetuation  of  the 
species. These are fundamental to this world, but there is no need for them in the world of 
eternity and hereafter. So why are they among the greatest pleasures of Paradise? 

THE ANSWER:  Firstly, the bodies of living creatures are doomed to annihilation 
and  death  in  this  world  because  of  an  imbalance  between  what  is  taken  in  and  what  is 
expended. From childhood until maturity much is  

 

515 

taken  in,  and  after  that  what  is  expended  increases;  the  balance  is  spoilt,  and  the  body 
dies. In the world of eternity, however, the particles of the body remain constant and are 
not subject to composition and dissolution, or else the balance remains constant.2 Like a 
closed circle or perpetual motion, the body of the living creature becomes eternal together 
with  the  functioning  of  the  machine  of  bodily  life  for  pleasure.  Although  in  this  world 
eating and drinking and sexual relations arise from need and perform a function, various 
delights and pleasures have been placed within them as an immediate wage for the duty 
performed, and these are superior to other pleasures. Since in this abode of sorrows eating 
and sexual relations are the means to so many wonderful and various pleasures, certainly 
in  Paradise,  which  is  the  abode  of  pleasure  and  bliss,  those  pleasures  will  take  on  a 
sublime  form.  The  recompense  of  the  duties  pertaining  to the  hereafter  performed  here 
will  also  be  added  to  them  as  pleasure,  and  they  will  be  augmented  by  worldly  needs 
which  have  taken  the  form  of  agreeable,  otherworldly  appetites,  so  will  become  an  all-
embracing, living source of pleasure worthy of Paradise and suitable to eternity. Indeed, 
according to the meaning of the verse, 

And what is the life of this world but amusement and play? But indeed the Abode 
of the hereafter, that is life indeed,3 

substances, matters, which are inanimate and without consciousness and life in the abode 
of this world, there will be living and conscious. Like human beings and animals here, the 
trees and stones there will understand commands and carry them out. If you tell a tree to 
bring you such-and-such a fruit, it will bring it. And if you tell such-and-such a stone to 
come,  it  will  come.  Since  stones  and  trees  will  take  on  this  elevated  form,  it  surely 
necessitates  that,  together  with  preserving  their  bodily  realities,  eating,  drinking,  and 
sexual  relations  also  will  take  on  a  form  higher  than  their  worldly  form,  higher  to  the 
degree that Paradise is higher than this world. 

QUESTION:  According to the meaning of: 

Everyone will be together with those he loves,4 

in Paradise, friend will be together with friend. Therefore, love for God’s sake kindled in 
a  simple  nomad  during  one  minute’s  conversation  with  the  Prophet  (PBUH),  means  he 
has to be with the Prophet (Peace and blessings be  

                                                

2 In this world, the bodies of humans and animals are like guesthouses, barracks, and schools for 
particles. The lifeless particles enter them and acquire worthiness to be particles for the everlasting realm, 
which is living, then they leave them. In the hereafter, however, according to the verse, “The Abode of the 
Hereafter, that is life indeed,” the light of life is general. There is no necessity for that travelling, drill, and 
instruction in order to be illuminated. Particles will remain constant as permanent fixtures.

516 

upon  him)  in  Paradise.  But  since  God’s  Noble  Messenger  (PBUH)  receives  limitless 
effulgence, how can it be united with that of a simple nomad? 

THE  ANSWER:    We  shall  allude  to  this  elevated  truth  with  a  comparison.  For 
example, a magnificent personage set up a vast banquet and finely-adorned spectacle in a 
splendid garden. He prepared it in such a way that it included all the delicious foods that 
the sense of taste can experience, and all the fine things that please the sense of sight, and 
all  the  wonders  that  amuse  the  faculty  of  imagination,  and  so  on;  he  included  in  it 
everything  that  would  gratify  and  give  pleasure  to  the  external  and  inner  senses.  Now, 
there were two friends and they went together to the banquet and sat down at a table in a 
pavilion.  But  the  sense  of  taste  of  one  of  them  was  very  limited,  so  he  received  only 
minor pleasure. His eyes could see only a  little, he had  no sense of smell, and  he could 
not  understand  the  wondrous  arts  nor  comprehend  the  marvels.  He  could  only  benefit 
from and take pleasure in a thousandth or even a millionth of that beautiful place, to the 
extent of his capacity. The other man however had developed his outer and inner senses, 
his  mind,  heart,  emotions,  and  subtle  faculties  so  perfectly  and  to  such  a  degree  that 
although he was next to his friend, he could perceive and experience all the subtleties and 
beauties  and  marvels  and  fine  things  in  the  exhibition,  and  receive  their  different 
pleasures.  

Since this  confused, sorrowful,  and  narrow world  is thus, and although the greatest 
and the least are together, the difference between them is as great as from the ground to 
the Pleiades, surely  in  Paradise, the realm of  bliss and  eternity, while  friend  is together 
with  friend,  each  will  receive  his  share  from  the  table  of  the  Most  Merciful  and 
Compassionate  One  in  accordance  with  his  capacity  and  to  the  extent  of  his  abilities. 
Even if the Paradises in which they are found are different, it will not be an obstacle to 
their being together. For although the eight levels of Paradise are one above the other, the 
roof  of  all  of  them  is  the  Sublime  Throne.5  If  there  are  walled  circles  round  a  conical 
mountain, one within the other and one above the other from its foot to the summit, the 
circles  are  one  over  the  other  and  look  to  one  another,  but  do  not  prevent  each  other 
seeing the sun. There are also various narrations of Hadiths indicating that the Paradises 
are in a manner close to this. 

QUESTION:    It  is  said  in  Hadiths:  “Although  the  houris  are  clothed  in  seventy 
garments, the marrow of their leg-bones may be seen.”6 What does this mean? What sort 
of meaning can it have? What sort of beauty is this? 

THE ANSWER:  Its  meaning  is truly  beautiful  and  its  beauty  is  most  lovely. It is 

like this: in this world, which is ugly, inanimate, lifeless, and for

517 

the most part just a husk, beauty and loveliness only appear beautiful to the eye, and so 
long  as  familiarity  is  not  an  obstacle,  that  is  sufficient.  Whereas  in  Paradise,  which  is 
beautiful,  living,  brilliant,  and  entirely  the  essence  without  the  husk  and  the  kernel 
without the shell, like the eye, all  man’s senses and subtle faculties will want to receive 
their different pleasures and various delights from the houris, the gentle sex, and from the 
women of this world, who will be like houris and even more beautiful. That is to say, the 
Hadith indicates that from the beauty of their top garments to the marrow of their bones, 
each layer will be the means of pleasure to a sense and a subtle faculty. Yes, by saying, 
“The houris wear seventy garments and the marrow of their leg-bones can be seen,” the 
Hadith  points  out  that  however  many  senses,  feeling,  powers,  and  faculties  man  has 
which are enamoured of beauty, worship pleasure, are captivated by ornament, and yearn 
for  loveliness,  the  houris  comprise  all  of  them  –  every  sort of  adornment  and  exquisite 
loveliness,  physical  and  spiritual  and  immaterial,  which  will  please  and  satisfy  all  of 
them, and gratify them and make them all happy.  

That  is  to  say,  just  as  the  houris  are  clothed  in  seventy  of  the  varieties  of  the 
adornment  of  Paradise,  and  not  one  sort,  none  of  which  conceal  the  others;  so  they 
display  beauty  and  loveliness  perhaps  seventy  times  greater  than  their  own  bodies  and 
beings,  all  of  different  sorts  and  varieties.  They  demonstrate  the  truth  indicated  by  the 
verse: 

There  will  be  there  all  that  the  souls  could  desire  and  all  that  the  eyes  could 
delight in.7 

There  is  also  a  Hadith  which  states  that  since  in  Paradise  there  are  no  unnecessary, 
extraneous, waste-matters, the people of Paradise will not excrete waste after eating and 
drinking.8  Since  in  this  lowly  world,  trees,  the  most  ordinary  of  living  beings,  do  not 
excrete despite taking in much nourishment, why should the people of Paradise, who are 
the highest class of life? 

QUESTION:  It says in Hadiths: “Some of the people of Paradise are given lands as 
extensive as the world, and thousands of palaces and hundreds of thousands of houris are 
bestowed on them.”9 What need has a single person of all these things, why should it be 
necessary? How can this be and what does it mean? 

THE ANSWER:  If man was only a lifeless being, or was only a vegetable creature 
consisting  of  a  stomach,  or  consisted  only  of  a  limited,  heavy,  temporary,  simple 
corporeality or animal body, he could not own

many palaces and houris, or be fit for them. But man is such a comprehensive miracle of 
power that  even  in  this  transitory  world  and  brief  life,  if  he  is  given  the  rule  of  all  the 
world with its wealth and pleasures, his ambition is not satisfied – in respect of the need 
of  some  of  his  subtle  faculties,  which  do  not  develop  here.  It  is  therefore  reasonable, 
right, and true that a person possessing an infinite capacity who knocks on the door of an 
infinite  mercy  with  the  hand  of  infinite  desires  and  the  tongue  of  infinite  needs  will 
receive  in  an  eternal  abode  of  bliss  the  Divine  bounties  described  in  Hadiths.  We  shall 
observe this elevated truth through the telescope of a comparison. It is as follows: 

Although,  like  this  valley  garden,10  all  these  gardens  and  vineyards  of  Barla  have 
different  owners,  all  the  birds  and  sparrows  and  honey-bees  in  Barla,  who  have  only  a 
handful  of  grain  for  food,  may  say:  “All  the  gardens  and  orchards  of  Barla  are  my 
pleasant resorts where I fly around and enjoy myself.” Each may take possession of Barla 
and  include  it  in  its  property.  Others  sharing  it  does  not  invalidate  his  ownership. 
Similarly,  a  man  who  is  a  true  human  being  may  say:  “My  Creator  made  this  world  a 
house for me. The sun is my lamp and the stars my electric lights. The face of the earth is 
my resting-place spread with flowered carpets.” And he offers thanks to God. The other 
creatures sharing it does not negate his statement. On the contrary, the creatures adorn his 
house like decorations. And so, if in this narrow fleeting world, by virtue of his humanity, 
man – and even a bird – claims a sort of power of disposal over such a vast sphere and 
receives such a vast bounty, how can it be deemed unlikely that he is given ownership of 
a  property  stretching  over  a  five  hundred  year  distance  in  a  broad  and  eternal  abode  of 
bliss? 

Moreover, just as in this dense and dark narrow world the sun is present in the same 
way at the same time in numerous mirrors, so too, as is proved in the Sixteenth Word, a 
luminous  being  may  be  present  in  many  places  in  the  same  way  at  the  same  time.  For 
example, Gabriel (Peace be upon him) being on a thousand stars simultaneously, and at 
the  Divine  Throne,  and  in  the  presence  of  the  Prophet  (PBUH),  and  in  the  Divine 
Presence; and the Prophet Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him) meeting with 
most of the righteous of his community  at the resurrection of the dead at the same time 
and appearing in this world in innumerable places simultaneously; and a strange group of 
the  saints  known  as  abdal,  appearing  at  the  same  time  in  many  places;  and  ordinary 
people  sometimes carrying out as much  as a  year’s work  in one  minute  in a dream and 
observing this; and everyone being in contact with and concerned with numerous places 
at the same time in their hearts, spirits, and imaginations – all these are well-known and 
may  

                                                

this Word was written in one or two hours. 

10 That is, the garden of Süleyman, who served this poor one with perfect loyalty for eight years, where

be  witnessed.  Most  certainly,  in  Paradise,  therefore,  which  is  luminous,  unrestricted, 
broad, and eternal, the people of Paradise, whose bodies have the strength and lightness 
of the spirit and the swiftness of imagination, being in hundreds of thousands of places at 
the  same  time,  and  conversing  with  hundreds  of  thousands  of  houris,  and  receiving 
pleasure in hundreds of thousands of ways, is fitting for that eternal Paradise, that infinite 
mercy,  and  as  told  by  the  Bringer  of  Sure  News  (PBUH),  is  reality  and  the  truth. 
Nevertheless, these vast truths cannot be weighed on the scales of our tiny minds. 

This tiny mind cannot perceive the true meanings, 
For this scale cannot bear such a weight. 

Glory be unto to You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught 
us; indeed, You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.11 
O our Sustainer! Do not call us to task if we forget or fall into error.12 

O  God!  Grant  blessings  to  Your  Beloved,  who  by  being  Your  Beloved  and 
through  his  prayers,  flung  open  the  doors  of  Paradise,  and  because  of  the 
benedictions  for  him  of  its  members,  You  confirmed  its  opening  for  his 
community, and bless him and grant him peace. 

O God! Appoint us to Paradise among the righteous, through the intercession of 
Your Beloved, the Chosen One. Amen.

A Short Addendum 
to the Word on Paradise 

[On Hell] 

As  is  proved  in  the  Second  and  Eighth  Words,  belief  bears  the  seed  of  a  sort  of 
Paradise, while unbelief conceals the seed of a sort of Hell. And just as unbelief is a seed 
of  Hell,  so  Hell  is  one  of  its  fruits.  And  just  as  unbelief  is  the  reason  for  being  sent to 
Hell,  so  it  is  the  cause  of  Hell’s  existence  and  creation.  For  if  an  insignificant  ruler  of 
small  dignity,  small  pride,  and  small  majesty  is  told  impudently  by  some  unmannerly 
person: “You may not punish me and you cannot,” if there is no prison in that place, the 
ruler  will  certainly  have  one  built  for  him  and  will  throw  him  into  it.  However,  by 
denying Hell, the unbeliever is giving the lie to One of infinite dignity, pride, and glory, 
Who is sublimely and infinitely powerful, and is accusing Him of impotence, lying, and 
powerlessness;  he  is  insulting  His  dignity  and  offending  His  pride  terribly.  He  is 
rebelliously  causing  affront  to  His  glory.  If,  to  suppose  the  impossible,  there  was  no 
reason  for  Hell’s  existence,  it  would  certainly  be  created  for  unbelief,  which  comprises 
denial and ascribing impotence to this degree, and such an unbeliever would certainly be 
cast into it. 

Our Sustainer! You did not create that in vain. Glory be unto You! Save us from 
the penalty of the Fire!13

The Twenty-Ninth Word 

This, the Twenty-Ninth Word, is about the Immortality 
of Man’s Spirit, the Angels, and the Resurrection. 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
Therein  came  down  the  angels  and  the  Spirit  by  the  permission  of  their 
Sustainer.1 * Say: The Spirit [comes] by command of my Sustainer.2 

 [This treatise consists of an Introduction and two main Aims] 

Introduction 

It may be said that the existence of the angels and spirit beings is as definite as that 
of  human  beings  and  animals.  Indeed,  as  is  explained  in  the  First  Step of  the  Fifteenth 
Word, reality undoubtedly requires and wisdom certainly demands that like the earth the 
heavens  have  inhabitants,  and  that  its  inhabitants  are  intelligent,  and  suitable  for  the 
heavens.  In  the  tongue  of  the  Shari‘a,  those  inhabitants,  of  which  there  are  numerous 
kinds, are called angels and spirit beings.   

Reality requires it to be thus. For despite the earth’s smallness and insignificance in 
relation to the heavens, its being filled with intelligent beings and from time to time being 
emptied  and  then  refilled  with  new  ones  suggests  —indeed,  states  clearly—  that  the 
heavens  too,  with  their  majestic  constellations  like  adorned  palaces,  are  filled  with 
animate  creatures,  the  light  of  the  light  of  existence,  and  conscious  and  intelligent 
creatures,  the  light  of  animate  creatures.  Like  man  and  the  jinn,  those  creatures  are 
spectators of the palace of the world, and ponderers over the  book of the universe, and 
heralds of this realm of dominicality. With their universal and  

                                                

1 Qur’an, 97:4. 
2 Qur’an, 17:85. 

 

522 

comprehensive worship, they represent the glorification of the large and universal beings 
in the universe.  

The nature of the universe surely points to their existence. For since it is embellished 
and decked out with uncountable numbers of finely adorned works of art and meaningful 
decorations  and  wise  embroideries,  it  self-evidently  requires  the  gazes  of  thoughtful 
admirers  and  wondering,  appreciative  lovers;  it  demands  their  existence.  Yes,  just  as 
beauty requires a lover, so is food is given to the hungry. Thus, the sustenance of spirits 
and  nourishment  of  hearts  in  this  boundless  beauty  of  art  looks to the  angels  and  spirit 
beings;  it  points  to  them.  For  while  this  infinite  adornment  requires  an  infinite  duty  of 
contemplation and worship, man and the jinn can perform only a millionth of that infinite 
duty, that wise supervision, that extensive worship. This  means that boundless  varieties 
of angels and spirit beings are  necessary to perform those duties, and to fill and  inhabit 
the mighty mosque of the world with their ranks. 

Indeed, a species of the spirit beings and angels is present in every aspect, in every 
sphere, of the universe, each charged with a duty of worship. It may be said according to 
both the narrations of Hadiths and the wisdom in the order of the world that from lifeless 
planets  and  stars  to  raindrops,  all  are  ships  or  vehicles  for  a  kind  of  angel.  The  angels 
mount  these  vehicles  with  Divine  permission  and  travel  observing  the  Manifest  World; 
they represent their praise and glorification.  

It also may  be said that certain sorts of  living  bodies act as aeroplanes  for different 
kinds  of  spirits.  From  the  birds  of  Paradise,  called  the  Green  Birds  in  a  Hadith  which 
says:  “The  spirits  of  the  people  of  Paradise  enter  into  Green  Birds  in  the  Intermediate 
Realm and travel around Paradise in them,”3 to flies, each is a vehicle for a sort of spirit. 
The spirits enter into them at a Divine command, and through the faculties and senses of 
those  living  bodies  like  the  eyes  and  ears,  observe  the  miracles  of  creation  in  the 
corporeal world. They perform the particular glorification of each. 

Just as reality necessitates it to be thus, so does wisdom. For, with an intense activity, 
the All-Wise Maker continuously creates subtle life and luminous intelligent beings from 
dense  earth,  which  has  little  connection  with  spirit,  and  from  turbid  water,  which  has 
small  relation  with  the  light  of  life.  He  surely  then  creates  certain  sorts  of  intelligent 
beings  from  the  seas  of  light  and  even  from  the  oceans  of  darkness,  from  the  air, 
electricity, and other subtle matter suitable for spirit and appropriate for life. And surely 
these creatures are exceedingly numerous.

First Aim 

To  believe  in  the  angels  and  affirm  that  belief  is  a  pillar  of  faith.  There  are  four 

Fundamental Points in this Aim. 

FIRST FUNDAMENTAL POINT 

The perfection of existence is through life. Rather, the true existence of existence is 
through life. Life is the light of existence, and consciousness is the light of life. Life is the 
summit and foundation of everything. Life appropriates everything for living beings; it is 
as though  it  makes one thing the owner of everything. Through  life, a  living thing  may 
say: “All these things belong to me. The world is my house. The universe is my property, 
given to me by my owner.” 

Just  as  light  is  the  cause  of  things  being  seen,  and,  according  to  some,  of  the 
existence of colours, so is life the revealer of beings; it is the cause of their qualities being 
realized.  Furthermore,  it  makes  an  insignificant  particular  general  and  universal,  and  is 
the cause of universal things being concentrated in a particular. It is also the cause of all 
the perfections of existence, by, for example, making innumerable things co-operate and 
unite, and making them the means of unity and being endowed with spirit. Life is even a 
sort of manifestation of Divine unity in the levels of multiplicity, and a mirror reflecting 
Divine oneness. 

Consider the following: a lifeless object, even if it is a great mountain, is an orphan, 
a stranger, alone. Its only relations are with the place in which it is situated, and with the 
things which encounter it. Whatever else there is in the cosmos, it does not exist for the 
mountain. For the mountain has neither life through which it might be related to life, nor 
consciousness by which it might be concerned. 

Now  consider  a  tiny  object  like  a  bee,  for  example.  The  instant  life  enters  it,  it 
establishes such a connection with the universe that it is as though it concludes a trading 
agreement  with  it,  especially  with  the  flowers  and  plants  of  the  earth.  It  can  say:  “The 
earth  is  my  garden;  it  is  my  trading  house.”  Thus,  through  the  unconscious  instinctive 
senses  which  impel  and  stimulate  it  in  addition  to  the  well-known  five  external  senses 
and  inner  senses  of  animate  beings,  the  bee  has  a  feeling  for,  and  a  familiarity  and 
reciprocal relationship with, most of the species in the world, and they are at its disposal. 

 

524 

If life then displays its effect thus in the tiniest of animate beings, certainly when it 
rises to the highest level, that of man, it will be revealed and extended and illumined to 
such a degree that just as a human being is able to move through the rooms of his house 
with his consciousness and mind, which are the light of life, so he may travel through the 
higher,  and  the  spiritual  and  corporeal  worlds  with  them.  That  is  to  say,  just  as  that 
conscious and animate being may go in spirit as though as a guest to those worlds, those 
worlds too come as guests to his mirror-like spirit by being reflected and depicted there. 

Life is a most brilliant proof of the All-Glorious One’s unity, and one of the greatest 
sources of His bounty; it is a most subtle manifestation of His compassionateness, and a 
most hidden, unknowable, and incomparable embroidery of His art. 

Life is hidden and subtle, because the life of plants even, which is the lowest of the 
levels of life, and the awakening of the life-force in seeds, that is, their stirring, opening, 
and  growth,  which  are  the  first  steps  in  plant  life,  has  remained  unfathomed  by  human 
science since the time of Adam, despite being so evident and familiar, so ubiquitous and 
common. Man’s reason has been unable to discover its true reality. 

Moreover, life is so pure and unblemished that in both its aspects, that is in both its 
inner and outer faces,  it  is pure, translucent, transparent. Not veiling  it with causes, the 
hand  of  power  touches  it  directly.  Whereas  It  made  apparent  causes  a  veil,  to  be  the 
source of  the  insignificant  aspects  of  things  and  their  base  external  qualities,  which  are 
inappropriate to the dignity of power. 

IN  SHORT:  It  may  be  said  that  if  there  was  no  life,  existence  would  not  be 
existence; it would be no different from non-existence. Life is the light of the spirit, and 
consciousness is the light of life. Since life and consciousness are important to this great 
extent; and since there is self-evidently an absolutely perfect order in the universe, and a 
masterly  precision  and  most  wise  harmony;  and  since  our  lowly,  wretched  globe,  our 
wandering earth has been filled with uncountable numbers of animate beings, intelligent 
beings,  and  beings  with  spirits;  it  may  be  concluded  with  decisive  certainty  that  those 
heavenly palaces, those lofty constellations also have animate and conscious inhabitants 
appropriate to them. As fish swim in water, so are those luminous inhabitants present in 
the fire of the sun. Fire does not consume light; indeed, Fire aids light. 

Moreover,  since,  as  is  plain  to  see,  pre-eternal  power  creates  innumerable  animate 
beings and beings with spirits from the most common substances and densest matter, and 
giving  it  great  importance,  transmutes  dense  matter  by  means  of  life  into  a  subtle 
substance; and since it strews the light of life  

 

525 

everywhere  in  great  abundance,  and  gilds  most  things  with  the  light  of  consciousness; 
with  such  flawless  power  and  faultless  wisdom,  the  All-Wise  and  All-Powerful  One 
would certainly  not neglect the other  floods of  subtle  matter like  light and  ether, which 
are  close  to  and  fitting  for  the  spirit;  He  would  not  leave  them  without  life,  without 
consciousness,  inanimate.  Indeed,  He  creates  animate  and  conscious  beings  in  great 
numbers from light, which is also matter, and even from meanings, air, and even words. 
Just as He creates numerous different species of animals, so from these torrents of subtle 
matter  He  creates  numerous  different  spirit  creatures.  One  kind  of  them  are  the  angels, 
others  are  the  varieties  of  spirit  beings  and  jinn.  If  you  wish  to  see  just  how  true,  self-
evident,  and  rational  it  is  to  accept  the  existence  of  great  numbers  of  angels  and  spirit 
beings,  and  as  the  Qur’an  shows,  just  how  contrary  to  truth  and  wisdom,  and  what  a 
superstition,  aberration,  delirium  and  foolishness  it  is  not  to  accept  them,  consider  the 
following comparison. 

There were two men, one rustic and uncouth, the other civilized and intelligent, who 
made friends and went to a splendid city like Istanbul. In a distant corner of that civilized 
and  magnificent  city  they  came  across  a  dirty,  wretched  little  building,  a  factory.  They 
looked  and  saw  that  the  strange  factory  was  full  of  miserable,  impoverished  men 
working. All around the  building were  beings with  spirits  and animate beings, but their 
means  of  livelihood  and  conditions  of  life  were  such  that  some  were  herbivorous, they 
lived only on plants, while others were piscivorous, they ate nothing but fish. 

The two men watched the scene. Then they saw in the distance thousands of adorned 
palaces  and  lofty  castles.  Among  the  palaces  were  spacious  workshops  and  broad 
squares.  Because  of  either  the  distance,  or  the  defectiveness  of  the  men’s  eyesight,  or 
because they had hidden themselves, the inhabitants of the palaces were not visible to the 
two  men.  Moreover,  the  wretched  conditions  in  the  factory  were  not  to  be  seen  in  the 
palaces.  In  consequence  of  this,  the  uncouth  country-bumpkin,  who  had  never  before 
seen  a  city,  declared:  “Those  palaces  have  no  inhabitants,  they  are  empty,  there  are  no 
beings with  spirits  in them,” uttering the  most  ignorant garbled nonsense. To which the 
second man replied: 

“O you miserable man! This insignificant little building you see here has been filled 
with  beings  endowed  with  spirits,  with  workers,  and  there  is  someone  who  continually 
employs and replaces them. Look, there is not an empty space all around this factory, it 
has  been  filled  with  animate  beings  and  beings  with  spirits.  Do  you  think  it  is  at  all 
possible that there would be no high-ranking and suitable inhabitants in that orderly city, 
in those wisely adorned palaces so full of art which we can see in the distance? Of course  

 

526 

they are occupied, and the different conditions of life there are appropriate for those who 
live there. In place of grass, they eat pastries, and in place of fish, cakes. Their not being 
visible to you because of the distance, or your weak eyesight, or their hiding themselves, 
can at no time point to their  not being there.” The  fact that a thing  is  not seen does not 
indicate its non-existence. 

As the above comparison indicates, the fact that the globe of the earth is the home of 
these  infinite  numbers  of  beings  endowed  with  consciousness  and  spirit,  despite  its 
insignificance  and  density  among  the  lofty  heavenly  bodies  and  planets,  and  even  its 
grossest  and  most  rotten  particulars  becoming  masses  of  micro-organisms  when  they 
cease  as  sources  of  life,  necessarily,  demonstrably,  decisively  indicates,  testifies  to  and 
proclaims that infinite space and the majestic heavens with their constellations and stars 
are  full  of  animate  beings,  conscious  beings,  and  beings  with  spirits.  The  Illustrious 
Shari‘a of Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him) and the Qur’an of Miraculous 
Exposition call these beings, who are created from fire, light, and even from electricity, 
and from other subtle flowing matter, “The angels, the jinn, and spirit beings.” There are 
different kinds of angels, just as there are different kinds of corporeal beings. Indeed, the 
angel who is appointed to a raindrop will not be of the same sort as the angel appointed to 
the sun. There are also a very great many different sorts of jinn and spirit beings. 

The Conclusion of this Fundamental Point: 

As  may  be established empirically,  matter is  not essential  so that existence  may  be 
made subject to it, and be dependent on it. Rather, matter subsists through a meaning, and 
that meaning is life, it is spirit. 

Also,  as  may  be  established  through  observation,  matter  is  not  the  thing  served  so 
that  everything  may  be  ascribed  to  it.  It  is  rather  the  servant;  it  renders  service  to  the 
process of the perfection of a truth. And that truth is life. And the fundament of that truth 
is spirit. 

Also, as is self-evident, matter is not dominant so that recourse may be made to it or 
perfections  sought  from  it.  Rather,  it  is  dominated;  it  looks  to  the  decree  of  some 
fundament, it is in motion in the way that that decree dictates. And that fundament is life, 
it is spirit, it is consciousness. 

Also,  as  is  necessary,  matter  is  not  the  kernel,  it  is  not  the  fundament,  it  is  not  a 
settled  abode  so  that  events  and  perfections  may  be  affixed  to  it  or  constructed  on  it. 
Rather, it is a shell prepared to be split, rent, dissolved; it is a husk, it is froth, it is a form.  

Consider the following: a creature so minute it can only be seen with a  

 

527 

microscope has such acute senses it can hear its friend’s voice, and see its sustenance; it 
has  extremely  sensitive  and  sharp  senses.  This  demonstrates  that  the  effects  of  life 
increase and the light of the spirit intensifies in proportion to the reducing and refining of 
matter. It is as though the more matter is refined and the more we become distanced from 
our material  existences, the  closer we draw to the world of the  spirit, the world of  life, 
and the world of consciousness; and the more intensely the heat of the spirit and the light 
of life are manifested. 

Is  it  therefore  at  all  possible  that  there  should  be  this  many  distillations  of  life, 
consciousness, and spirit within this veil of materiality, and that the inner world which is 
beyond this veil should not be full of conscious beings and beings with spirits? Is it at all 
possible that the sources of these numberless distillations, flashes, and fruits of meaning, 
spirit, life and the truth apparent in this material existence in the Manifest World should 
be ascribed only to matter and the motion of matter, and be explained by it? God forbid! 
Absolutely  not!  These  innumerable  distillations  and  flashes  demonstrate  that  this  
material and manifest world is but a lace veil strewn over the inner and spirit worlds.    

SECOND FUNDAMENTAL POINT 

It may be said that all the scholars of the speculative and the scriptural sciences have, 
knowingly or unknowingly, united to effect a consensus in affirming, despite difference 
of  expression,  the  existence  and  reality  of  the  angels  and  spirit  beings.  One  group  of 
Peripatetic  philosophers  of  the  Illuminist  School  even,  who  made  much  progress  in  the 
study  of  matter,  without  denying  the  meaning  of  the  angels,  stated  that  each  realm  in 
creation  has  a  spiritual,  incorporeal  essence.  They  described  the  angels  thus.  Also,  a 
group  of  the  early  philosophers  who  were  Illuminists,  being  compelled  to  accept  the 
meaning of the angels, were only wrong in naming them ‘the Ten Intellects and Masters 
of the Realms of Creation.’ Through the inspiration and guidance of revelation, scholars 
of  all  the  revealed  religions  have  accepted  that  each  realm  of  creation  has  an  angel 
appointed to it, and have named them the Mountain Angel, the Sea Angel, and the Rain 
Angel,  for example. Even the Materialists and Naturalists, whose reasoning  is restricted 
to what is immediately apparent to them and who have in effect fallen from the level of 
humanity to that of  inanimate matter, rather than being able to deny the  meaning of the 
angels,4  have  been  compelled  to  accept  them  in  one  respect,  though  naming  them  the 
Flowing Forces. 

                                                

4 They have been unable to find a way to deny the reality and meaning of the angels and spirit beings. 
In fact, they have been compelled to affirm them in one respect by claiming them to be one of the natural 
laws, although they described them wrongly, naming them Kuwa-yi Sariya or Flowing Forces. (Hey you 
who consider yourselves to be so clever!) 

 

528 

O you wretched man who is reluctant to accept the angels and spirit beings, on what 
do  you  base  this  view?  What  facts  do  you  rely  on  that  you  oppose  the  conscious  or 
otherwise  unanimity  of  all  the  scholars  concerning  the  existence  and  reality  of  the 
meaning of the angels and the real existence of spirit beings? And since, as was proved in 
the First Fundamental Point, life  is the revealer of  beings,  indeed,  is their consequence, 
their quintessence; and since all the scholars are in effect unanimous in their acceptance 
of the meaning of the angels; and this world of ours has been filled to such a degree with 
animate creatures and beings with spirits; is it all possible that the vastness of space and 
the rarefied  heavens would remain empty of dwellers,  have  no  inhabitants? You should 
never  think  that  the  laws  in  force  in  this  creation  are  sufficient  for  the  universe  to  be 
alive,  because  those  governing  laws  are  insubstantial  commands;  they  are  imaginary 
principles; they may be considered as non-existent. If there were no absolutely obedient 
creatures called angels to represent them,  make them apparent, and take their reins  into 
their own hands, those laws could not be defined as existent, nor be represented as having 
a particular  identity, nor be an external reality.  Whereas, Life  is an external reality, and 
an imaginary command cannot sustain an external reality. 

In Short:  Since the scholars of religion and philosophy, and of the speculative and 
scriptural  sciences,  have  in  effect  agreed  that  beings  are  not  restricted  to  this  Manifest 
World; and since, despite being inanimate and inappropriate for the formation of spirits, 
the visible Manifest World  has  been adorned to such an extent with beings with spirits; 
existence  is  surely  not  limited  to  it.  There  are  numerous  other  levels  of  existence  in 
relation to which the Manifest World is an embroidered veil. 

Furthermore,  since,  just  as  the  sea  is  appropriate  for  fish,  and  the  World  of  the 
Unseen and the World of Meaning appropriate for spirits, and this necessitates their being 
filled with them;  and  since  all  commands testify  to the existence of the  meaning of the 
angels;  certainly  and  without  any  shadow  of  a  doubt,  the  most  beautiful  form  of  the 
angels’  existence  and  spirit  beings’  reality,  and  the  most  rational  view  of  their  nature 
which sound intellects will accept and acclaim, is that which the Qur’an has expounded 
and  elucidated.  The  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  states  that:  “The  angels  are 
honoured  slaves.  Never  contesting  a  command,  they  do  whatever  they  are  commanded. 
The angels are subtle, luminous beings, and are divided into different kinds.” 

Just  as  mankind  is  a  nation  and  human  beings  are  the  bearers,  representatives,  and 
embodiments of the Shari‘a or code of divine laws which proceeds from the attribute of 
Divine speech, so are the angels a mighty nation, and those of them who are workers are 
the bearers, representatives,  

 

529 

and  embodiments  of  the  ‘code  of  laws  pertaining  to  creation,  which  proceeds  from  the 
attribute  of  Divine  will.’  They  are  a  class  of  God’s  slaves  who  are  dependent  on  the 
commands of the creative power and pre-eternal will, which are the true effective agent, 
and for whom all the heavenly bodies are like places of worship, like mosques. 

THIRD FUNDAMENTAL POINT 

The  question  of  the  angels  and  spirit  beings  is  one  of  those  questions  in  which  the 
reality of a universal may be inferred from the existence of a single particular. If a single 
individual  is  seen,  the  existence  of  the  species  may  be  concluded.  Whoever  denies  it, 
denies  it  as  a  member  of  the  species  to  which  it  belongs.  While  whoever  accepts  the 
single  individual  is compelled to accept its whole species. Since  it  is thus, consider the 
following: 

Have you not seen and heard that all the scholars of the revealed religions throughout 
the ages from the time of Adam until now have agreed on the existence of the angels and 
the  reality  of  spirit  beings?  The  different  groups  of  mankind  have  concurred  in  having 
seen and conversed with angels and  in their  narrations concerning them, as though they 
were  discussing  and  narrating  events  about  one  another.  Do  you  think  that  if  a  single 
angel  had  not  been  seen,  and  the  existence  of  one  or  numerous  individuals  not  been 
established  through  observation,  and  their  existence  not  been  perceived  clearly,  self-
evidently, that it would have been at all possible for such accord and such a consensus to 
continue,  and  to  continue  persistently  and  unanimously  in  such  an  affirmative  and 
positive manner, based on observation? 

Also,  is  it  at  all  possible  that  the  source  of  this  general  belief  should  not  be  some 
necessary  principles  and  self-evident  matters?  And  is  it  all  possible  that  a  baseless 
delusion should persist and  become permanent  in all the  beliefs of  mankind throughout 
all the revolutions it has undergone? And is it all possible that the basis of the assertion of 
these scholars of the religions, of this mighty consensus, should not be a certain intuition 
and empirical certainty? And is it at all possible that that certain intuition and empirical 
certainty which result from innumerable signs, and those signs which have been observed 
on numerous occasions, and those numerous observations should not all, without doubt or 
hesitation, be founded on necessary principles? In which case, the cause and the basis of 
the  assertion  of  the  universal  belief  held  by  these  scholars  are  the  necessary  and 
categorical  principles  resulting  from  the  great  number  of  times  the  angels  and  spirit 
beings have been observed and seen, which demonstrates the strength of the consensus. 

Furthermore,  is  it  all  possible,  rational  or  feasible  that the  unanimous  testimony  of 

the prophets and saints, who are like the suns, moons, and stars in  

 

530 

human society, concerning the existence of the angels and spirit beings and their actually 
seeing them, should be prey to doubts or be the object of suspicion? Especially since they 
are  qualified  to  speak  in  this  matter. It  is  obvious  that two  people  who  are  qualified  to 
speak  on  a  matter  are  preferable  to  thousands  who  are  not.  Moreover,  in  this  question 
they are affirming a  matter, and people who affirm a  matter are preferable to thousands 
who deny or reject it. 

Is it at all possible for there to be any doubt concerning the statements of the Qur’an 
of Miraculous Exposition, the Sun of Suns in the world of truths, which never at any time 
sets,  shining  continuously  in  the  skies  of  the  universe?  And  can  there  be  doubt 
concerning the testimony and witnessings of the Muhammadan Being (PBUH), the Sun 
of Prophethood? 

Since,  if  on  a  single  occasion  the  existence  of  a  single  spirit  being  is  verified,  this 
demonstrates the real existence of the whole species; and since it proves the existence of 
the whole species to be true, for sure, the best and most rational and acceptable form of 
their  real  existence  will  be  similar  to  that  expounded  by  the  Shari‘a,  described  by  the 
Qur’an, and seen by the One who ascended to a “distance of two bow-lengths.” 

FOURTH FUNDAMENTAL POINT 

If  the  creatures  of  the  universe  are  observed  with  care,  it  may  be  seen  that  like 
particulars,  universals  have  collective  identities,  each  of  which  appears  as  a  universal 
function; it is apparent that each performs a universal duty. For example, just as a flower 
as  itself  displays  an  embroidery  full  of  art,  and  with  the  tongue  of  its  being  recites  the 
Creator’s  Names,  so  the  garden  of  the  globe  resembles  a  flower,  and  performs  an 
extremely  orderly,  universal  duty  of  glorification.  And  just  as  a  fruit  issues  a 
proclamation expressing its glorification of God within an order and regularity, so does a 
mighty tree in its entirety have a most well-ordered natural duty and worship. And just as 
a  tree  glorifies  God  through  the  words  of  its  fruits,  flowers  and  leaves,  so  do  the  vast 
oceans  of  the  heavens  glorify  the  All-Glorious  Creator  and  praise  the  Sublime  Maker 
through their suns, moons, and stars, which are like words; and so on. Although external 
beings are outwardly inanimate and unconscious, they all perform extremely vital, living, 
and  conscious  duties  and  glorification.  Of  a  certainty,  therefore,  just  as  angels  are  their 
representatives  expressing  their  glorification  in  the  World  of  the  Inner  Dimensions  of 
Things,  so  are  they  the  counterparts,  dwellings,  and  mosques  of  those  angels  in  the 
external and manifest world. 

As is explained in the Fourth Branch of the Twenty-Fourth Word, the first of the four 
categories of workers employed by the All-Glorious Maker of the palace of this world is 
that of the angels and spirit beings. Since, without  

 

531 

knowing  it,  plants  and  inanimate  beings  perform  extremely  important  though  wageless 
duties  at the command of One  Who does know; also without knowing  it, animals serve 
extensive  universal  aims  in  return  for  an  insignificant  wage;  and  since,  observedly,  in 
return  for  two  wages,  one  immediate  and  the  other  postponed,  human  beings,  knowing 
the  All-Glorious  Maker’s  aims,  are  employed  through  their  conforming  to  them,  their 
taking  a  share  of  everything  for  themselves,  and  their  supervising  the  other  servants;  it 
will certainly be the first category, as well as the fourth, which will constitute the servants 
and workers. They both resemble human beings in that knowing the universal aims of the 
All-Glorious  Maker,  they  conform  to  them  through  worship,  and  they  are  contrary  to 
them. For being beyond sensual pleasure and some partial wage, they consider sufficient 
the  pleasure,  perfection,  delight  and  bliss  they  experience  through  the  All-Glorious 
Maker’s  attention,  command,  favour,  consideration,  and  name,  through  their  perception 
of  Him,  connection  with  Him,  and  proximity  to  Him.  They  labour  with  the  purest 
sincerity, their duties of worship varying according to their different kinds, and according 
to the varieties of the creatures in the universe.  

Like in a government there are various officials in the various offices, so the duties 
of  worship  and  glorification  vary  in  the  spheres  of  the  realm  of  dominicality.  For 
example,  through  the  power,  strength,  reckoning  and  command  of  God  Almighty,  the 
Archangel Michael is like a general overseer of God’s creatures sown in the field of the 
face of the earth. If one may say so, he is the head of all the angels that resemble farmers. 
And, through the permission, command, power, and wisdom of the All-Glorious Creator, 
the  incorporeal shepherds of all the animals  have a  head, a supreme angel appointed to 
the task. 

Thus,  since  it  is  necessary  for  there  to  be  an  angel  appointed  over  each  of  these 
external creatures  in order to represent in the  World of the Inner Dimensions of Things 
the duties of worship and service of glorification which it performs, and to present them 
knowingly to the Divine Court, the way the angels are described in the narrations of the 
Bringer of Sure News (PBUH) is certainly most appropriate and rational. For example, he 
declared: “There are some angels which have either forty, or forty thousand, heads. In all 
the heads are forty thousand mouths, and with the forty thousand tongues in each of those 
mouths  they  glorify  God  in  forty  thousand  ways.”  This  Hadith  has  a  reality  and  both 
contains a meaning, and has a form, or manner of description. Its meaning is as follows: 

The  angels’  worship  is  both  extremely  orderly  and  perfect,  and  most  universal  and 

comprehensive. As for the form of the truth, it is this: 

There are certain mighty corporeal beings that perform their duties of  

 

532 

worship  with  forty  thousand  heads  in  forty  thousand  ways.  For  example,  the  heavens 
glorify God with the suns and the stars. While the earth, which is a single being, performs 
its duty of  worship,  its dominical glorification with a  hundred thousand  heads  and with 
the  hundreds  of  thousands  of  tongues  in  each  mouth.  Thus,  the  angel  appointed  to  the 
globe of the earth has to be seen in this way in order to display this meaning in the World 
of the Inner Dimensions of Things. 

I  myself,  even,  saw  a  medium-sized  almond  tree  which  had  close  on  forty  large 
branches  like  heads.  When  I  looked  at  one  branch,  I  saw  it  had  nearly  forty  smaller 
branches like tongues. Then I looked at one tongue of one of those small branches; forty 
flowers had opened on it. I studied the flowers considering the wisdom in them, and saw 
in  each  close  on  forty  exquisite  and  well-ordered  stamens,  colours,  and  arts,  each  of 
which  proclaimed  one  of  the  All-Glorious  Maker’s  Names  and  their  constantly  varying 
manifestations. Is it at all possible that the All-Wise and Beauteous One, Who is the All-
Glorious Maker of the almond tree, would impose this many duties on an inanimate tree, 
and not mount on it an appointed angel appropriate to it, to be like its spirit, to understand 
and express its meaning, proclaim it to the universe, and present it to the Divine Court? 

O  friend!  So  far,  our  explanation  has  been  an  introduction  to  bring  the  heart  to 
acceptance,  the  reason  to  submission,  and  to  compel  the  soul  to  surrender.  If  you  have 
understood  it  to  some  degree,  and  wish  to  meet  with  the  angels,  prepare  yourself. 
Moreover, purify yourself of wrongful prejudice. Now look, the doors of the world of the 
Qur’an are open! Look, the paradise of the Qur’an is with “wide-open gates”!5 Enter and 
Look! See the angels in beautiful form in the paradise of the Qur’an! Each of its revealed 
verses is a place to alight, so look from them: 

By the [winds] sent forth one after another [to man’s profit], * Which then blow 
violently  in  tempestuous  gusts  *  And  scatter  [things]  far  and  wide;  *  Then 
separate, one from another * Then spread abroad a message.6 

By the [angels] who tear out [the souls of the wicked] with violence, * By those 
who gently draw out [the souls of the blessed] ,* And by those who gently glide 
along  [on  errands  of  mercy],*  Then  press  forward  as  if  in  a  race,  *  Then 
arrange to do [the commands of their Lord].7 

Therein  come  down  the  angels  and  the  Spirit  by  God’s  permission  in  every 
errand.8 

                                                

5 Qur’an, 38:50. 
6 Qur’an, 77:1-5. 
7 Qur’an, 79:1-5. 
8 Qur’an, 97:4. 

 

533 

...over  which  are  [appointed]  angels  stern  [and]  severe,  who  flinch  not  [from 
executing]  the  commands  they  receive  from  God,  but  do  [precisely]  what  they 
are commanded.9 

Also listen to: 

...Glory  be  to  Him!  They  are  but  servants  raised  to  honour.  They  speak  not 
before He speaks and they act [in all things] by His command,10 

listen to its praises. And if you wish to meet with the jinn, enter this resounding Sura:  

Say, it has been revealed to me that a company of jinn listened [to the Qur’an].11 

See them and listen to what they say. Take a lesson from them. Look, they are saying: 

“We have really heard a wonderful recital * It gives guidance to the right, and 
we  have  believed  therein:  We  shall  not  join  [in  worship]  any  [gods]  with  our 
Lord.”12 

Second Aim 

The Second Aim is about the resurrection of the dead, the end of the world, and the 
life of the hereafter. It consists of four Fundamental Points, and an Introduction which is 
in the form of a comparison. 

INTRODUCTION 

If  someone  was  to  claim  about  a  palace  or  a  city:  “This  palace  or  city  will  be 
destroyed, and will then  be repaired and reconstructed so that it is intact,” six questions 
would surely arise in the face of his claim. 

The  First:    Why  should  they  be  destroyed?  Is  there  a  reason  or  something  to 

necessitate it? If the answer is “Yes,” he would have to prove it. 

The Second:  A question such as the following would arise: “Does the builder who 

would destroy and then reconstruct them possess the power to  

                                                

9 Qur’an, 66:6. 
10 Qur’an, 21:26-7. 
11 Qur’an, 72:1. 
12 Qur’an, 72:1-2. 

 

534 

do so? Would he be capable of it?” If the answer is “Yes,” he would have to prove it. 

The  Third:    The  following  such  question  would  arise:  “Are  their  destruction 
possible? And, are they going to be destroyed in the future?” If the answer is “Yes,” and 
if he proves both the possibility of the destruction and its occurrence, the following two 
further  questions  would  arise:  “Is  it  possible  for  this  strange  palace  or  city  to  be 
reconstructed from scratch, I wonder? If it is possible, will they be reconstructed?” If the 
answer is “Yes” and he proves these as well, then in no aspect or corner of this matter can 
a gap or chink remain through which any doubt, misgiving or suspicion might enter. 

Thus,  like  in  the  comparison,  there  are  facts  necessitating  the  destruction  and 
reconstruction of the palace of the earth and city of the universe. Its author and builder is 
powerful enough; its destruction is possible, and will occur. Its reconstruction is possible, 
and will occur. These matters will be proved after the First Fundamental Point. 

FIRST FUNDAMENTAL POINT 

Man’s spirit is definitely immortal. Almost all the indications in the First Aim which 
point  to  the  existence  of  the  angels  and  spirit  beings  also  point  to  the  immortality  of 
man’s spirit, which is our topic here. In my opinion, the matter is so certain that further 
explanation  would  be  profitless.  Indeed,  the  distance  between  us  and  the  caravans  of 
innumerable  immortal  spirits  who  are  waiting  to go to the  hereafter  in  the  Intermediate 
and Spirit Worlds is so fine and slight that there is no need to demonstrate it with proofs. 
Numberless saints and people of illumination getting in touch with them, and those who 
discern  the  secrets  of  the  grave  seeing  them,  and  even  a  number  of  ordinary  people 
communicating  with  them,  and  the  mass  of  people  forming  relations  with  them  in  true 
dreams, have formed a mass of unanimous reports, and quite simply become part of the 
commonly  accepted  knowledge  of  mankind.  However,  because  materialist  thought  has 
stupified  everyone  in  this  age,  it  has  been  able  to  implant  doubts  in  their  minds 
concerning even the most evident matters. In order to remove these doubts, therefore, we 
shall  set  forth  an  Introduction  and  four  Sources  from  the  numerous  sources  springing 
from the heart’s intuition and the intellect’s insight. 

Introduction 

As  is  proved  in  the  Fourth  Truth  of  the  Tenth  Word,  an  eternal,  everlasting,  and 
peerless  beauty  requires  the  eternity  and  permanence  of  mirror-bearing  enraptured 
admirers.  And  a  faultless,  eternal,  and  perfect  art  seeks  the  perpetuation  of  thoughtful 
heralds.  And  a  boundless  mercy  and  beneficence  require  the  continued  ease  and 
happiness of needy ones to thank it.  

 

535 

And the foremost of those mirror-bearing enraptured admirers, those heralding thoughtful 
ones, those needy thankful ones is the human spirit, in which case, it will accompany that 
beauty, that perfection, that mercy on the endless road to eternity; it will be immortal. 

As  is also proved  in the Tenth Word, in the Sixth Truth, not only the human  spirit, 
but  also  the  simplest  levels  of  existence  have  not  been  created  for  extinction;  they 
manifest a form of immortality. Even an insignificant flower, which has no spirit, when it 
ceases from external existence, manifests a sort of immortality in a thousand ways. For its 
form  is  made  permanent  in  countless  memories.  And  finding  perpetuation  in  all  its 
hundreds  of  seeds,  the  law  according  to  which  it  was  formed  continues.  Since  the 
flower’s  law  of  formation,  the  model  of  its  form,  which  resembles  a  tiny  fragment  of 
spirit, is made permanent by an All-Wise Preserver; and since it is preserved throughout 
turbulent transformations with perfect order in its tiny seeds and made permanent; if you 
do  not  understand  the  degree  to  which  the  human  spirit,  which  is  of  an  extremely 
comprehensive and elevated nature, and has been clothed with external existence, and is a 
conscious, living, and luminous commanding law, most certainly manifests immortality, 
and is tied and bound to eternity, if you do not understand this, how can you claim to be a 
conscious human being? Can it be asked of an All-Wise One of Glory, an Imperishable 
Preserver Who includes and preserves the programme and law of formation of a mighty 
tree in its tiny dot-like seed? For that law to some degree resembles a spirit,“How can He 
preserve the spirits of the dead?” .  

• FIRST SOURCE:  This is subjective. That is to say, if anyone studies his own life 
and self, he perceives an immortal spirit. Indeed, in the course of occupying its body for a 
number  of  years  the  spirit  causes  the  body  to  change  considerably,  yet  the  spirit  self-
evidently  remains  constant.  In  which  case,  although  the  body  is  ephemeral,  it  does  not 
affect the  spirit’s  permanence,  nor  spoil  its  nature,  even  though  the  spirit  is  completely 
naked  at  death.  However,  in  the  course  of  life,  the  spirit  gradually  changes  its  body-
clothes, and at the time of death, it is suddenly undressed. It has been established through 
certain conjecture, indeed, through observation, that the body  subsists though the  spirit; 
in which case, the spirit does not subsist through the body. Rather, since the spirit subsists 
and  is  dominant  of  itself,  the  body  may  be  dispersed  and  gathered  together  again  as  it 
wishes; it will not infringe the spirit’s independence. 

In fact, the body is the spirit’s house, it is its home; it is not its clothes. What clothes 
the spirit is a subtle, fine sheath, something which may be likened to a body, which is to 
some extent constant, and is ethereal and appropriate for the spirit. At the time of death, 
then, the spirit is not completely naked, it leaves its home dressed in its body-like sheath. 

 

536 

•  SECOND  SOURCE:    This  is  objective.  That  is  to  say,  it  is  a  sort  of  empirical 
judgement  which  has  been  formed  through  repeated  observations  and  numerous 
occurrences  of  events.  Indeed,  when  it  is  understood that  a  single  spirit  continues  after 
death, this necessitates the continuation of all spirits as a category of being. For according 
to  the  science  of  logic  it  is  certain  that  if  an  intrinsic  quality  is  observed  in  a  single 
individual, the existence of that quality may be assumed in all individuals. Because it is 
intrinsic.  If  it  is  intrinsic,  it  will  be  present  in  each  individual.  Whereas  the  indications 
based on not one but on innumerable observations beyond calculation and count, and the 
signs pointing to the immortality of spirits are so definite, that like for us there is a place 
called the New World, that is, America, and that human beings are found there, we can in 
no way doubt the existence of those people. In the same way, it is unacceptable to doubt 
that the spirits of those who have died are now present in great numbers in the World of 
the Inner Dimension of Things and in the Spirit World, and that they have relations with 
us. Our immaterial gifts go to them, and their luminous emanations come to us. 

Moreover,  with  certain  intuition,  one  may  perceive  with  one’s  conscience  that  a 
fundamental  aspect  of  man  continues  after  his  death.  And  that  fundamental  aspect  is 
spirit.  As  for  spirit,  it  is  not  subject  to  destruction  and  dissolution.  This  is  because  it  is 
simple  and  uncompounded, 
it  has  unity.  As  for  destruction,  dissolution,  and 
decomposition,  they  are  the  function  of  complex  and  compound  substances.  As  we 
explained  above,  life  ensures  a  form  of  unity  within  multiplicity;  it  causes  a  sort  of 
permanence. That is to say, unity and permanence are fundamental to spirit, from which 
they spread to multiplicity.  

The  mortality  of  man’s  spirit  would  be  either  through  destruction  and  dissolution, 
whereas  unity  provides  no  opportunity  for  these,  and  its  simple  nature  disallows 
decomposition; or it would  be through annihilation. But the  limitless compassion of the 
Absolutely Generous One would not permit annihilation, and His boundless munificence 
would not allow that He should take back from the human spirit the bounty of existence 
which He has bestowed on it, which it ardently desires, and of which it is worthy. 

•  THIRD  SOURCE:    Man’s  spirit,  which  has  been  clothed  in  a  living,  conscious, 
luminous  external  existence,  is  a  comprehensive  and  veracious  commanding  law 
disposed  to  acquiring  universality.  And  even  the  weakest  commanding  laws  manifest 
stability and permanence. For if it is considered carefully, it will be seen that present in 
all  species  which  are  subject  to  change,  is  a  constant  truth  that,  revolving  within  the 
changes, transformations, and  stages of  life, causes the outer forms of things to change, 
and living and not dying, is permanent. 

 

537 

Thus, while the human being is an individual, because of the comprehensiveness of 
his  nature,  his  universal  consciousness,  and  all-embracing  imagination,  he  is  like  a 
species.  A  law  that  governs  and  is  in  force  in  the  species  is  also  in  force  in  the  human 
individual.  Since  the  All-Glorious  Creator  has  created  man  as  a  comprehensive  mirror, 
for universal worship, and with an exalted nature, even if the spirit-truth which is present 
in each individual causes the individual’s outer form to change hundreds of thousands of 
times,  with  the  Sustainer’s  permission,  it  will  not  die  but  will  continue,  departing  as  it 
came.  In  which  case,  at  God’s  command  and  with  His  permission  and  through  His 
making  it permanent, the human  individual’s spirit, which  is the conscious element and 
living part of him, is immortal. 

• FOURTH SOURCE: Consider the laws that govern in species, which to a degree 
resemble the spirit, and since they both issue from the World of the Divine Command and 
Will, with regard to their source, are to a degree appropriate for the spirit, and only lack a 
perceptible existence. Study them and it will be seen that if those commanding laws were 
clothed  in external existence, each of them would become the spirit of the species.  And 
the  laws  are  always  permanent;  they  are  always  perpetual  and  constant.  No  change  or 
transformation affects the laws’ unity, or spoils them. 

For example, should a fig-tree die and be dispersed, the law of its formation, which is 
like its spirit, will continue in its tiny seeds; it will not die. And so, since even the most 
commonplace  and  weak  commanding  laws  are  thus  connected  to  permanence  and 
continuance,  the  human  spirit  must  be  connected  not  only  with  permanence  and 
immortality, but with all eternity. For according to the Qur’an’s glorious decree of: 

Say: The Spirit (comes) by command of my Sustainer,13 

spirit  too  is  a  conscious  and  living  law  which  has  come  from  the  World  of  the  Divine 
Command, and which Pre-Eternal power  has  clothed with  external existence. That  is to 
say, just as the unconscious laws which proceed from the Divine attribute of will and the 
World  of  the  Divine  Command  are  always,  or  mostly,  enduring,  so  is  it  even  more 
definite that the spirit, which is a sort of brother to them, and like them is a manifestation 
of  the  attribute  of  will  and  comes  from  the  World  of  the  Command,  manifests 
immortality. It is also more worthy of it, because it is existent, it has an external reality. 
And it is more potent, more elevated, because it possesses consciousness. It is also more 
enduring than them, and more valuable, because it is living.

SECOND FUNDAMENTAL POINT 

There  are  matters  necessitating  eternal  happiness,  and  the  All-Glorious  Agent  is 
capable  of  bestowing  that  happiness.  Also,  the  destruction  of  the  universe  and  death  of 
the world are possible, and they will occur. And the resurrection of the world and the Last 
Judgement are possible, and they will occur. We shall explain all these six matters briefly 
and  in  a  way  that  will  satisfy  the  reason.  In  fact,  in  the  Tenth  Word,  arguments  are  set 
forth which raise the heart to the level of perfect belief, while here, we shall discuss them 
in  the  manner  of  the  Old  Said’s  explanations  in  his  treatise  called  Nokta  (The  Point), 
which convince and silence the reason only. 

There are matters which necessitate eternal happiness. A decisive argument pointing 
to those matters consists of a supposition filtered through Ten Sources and Central Points. 
• FIRST POINT:  If observed carefully, it will be seen that a perfect and intentional 
order embraces the whole universe. Traces of choice and flashes of purpose are to be seen 
in every aspect of it. What strikes the eyes through the testimony of their fruits is that in 
every  thing  is  a  light of  intention;  in  every  function,  a  flash  of  will;  in  every  motion,  a 
gleam  of  choice;  in  every  composite  whole,  a  blaze  of  wisdom.  Thus,  if  there  was  no 
eternal happiness, this authentic order would merely consist of a weak and futile form. It 
would be a false order, not a true order. Connections and relations and immaterial things, 
which  are  the  spirit  of  order,  would  be  lost  and  come  to  nothing.  That  is  to  say,  what 
gives order to order is eternal happiness. In which case, the order of the universe points to 
eternal happiness. 

•  SECOND  POINT:    Total  wisdom  is  apparent  in  the  universe.  Indeed,  Divine 
wisdom,  which  is  the  representation  of  pre-eternal  favour,  proclaims  eternal  happiness 
through the tongue of the observance of benefits and following of purposes demonstrated 
by  the  universe  in  its  entirety.  Because,  if  there  was  no  eternal  happiness,  it  would  be 
necessary,  through  pride,  to  deny  the  wisdom  and  benefits  which  are  self-evidently 
constant in the universe. Since the Tenth Truth of the Tenth Word demonstrates this truth 
like the sun, we shall content ourselves with that and cut short the discussion here. 

•  THIRD  POINT:    Through  the  testimony  of  reason,  wisdom,  deduction,  and 
experience, the absence of futility and absence of waste in the creation of beings, which 
is constant, indicate eternal happiness. The sign of there being no waste and nothing vain 
in  creation  is  the  All-Glorious  Maker’s  choosing  and  preferring  the  shortest  way,  the 
closest point, the lightest form, and the best manner in the creation of everything, and His 
sometimes  imposing  a  hundred duties on one thing, and His attaching a thousand  fruits 
and aims to  

 

539 

a  slight  being.  Since  there  is  no  waste  and  nothing  in  vain,  there  will  surely  be  eternal 
happiness.  For  non-existence  and  no  return  would  make  everything  futile;  everything 
would be a waste. The absence of waste in all creation, and in man for instance, which is 
established by science, demonstrates that man’s limitless disposition, and infinite hopes, 
ideas, and desires will not be wasted either. In which case, man’s deep-rooted desire to be 
perfected points to the existence of a perfection,  and  his desire  for happiness proclaims 
that he  is definitely destined  for eternal  happiness. If  it was not so, contrary to all other 
beings,  which  are  made  wisely  and  with  purpose,  those  authentic  immaterial  faculties, 
those elevated hopes, would be waste and futile; they would wither up and be for nothing. 
Since this truth is proved in the Eleventh Truth of the Tenth Word, we cut the discussion 
short here. 

• FOURTH POINT:  In each of many different things, in night and day, and winter 
and  spring,  in  the  skies,  and  even  in  man’s  personalities  and  in  the  bodies  which  he 
changes throughout his lifetime, and in sleep, which resembles death, is a different sort of 
resurrection  resembling  the  resurrection  of  the  dead;  they  all  tell  of  and  allude  to  the 
reality  of  the  Day  of  Resurrection.  For  example,  the  day,  year,  lifetime  of  man,  and 
revolution of God’s great clock known as the earth resemble the dials of a weekly clock 
of  ours  that  tell  the  seconds,  minutes,  hours  and  days;  each  the  forerunner  of  the 
following,  they  give  news  of  one  another;  they  turn  and  function.  Like  they  show 
morning after night, and spring after winter, they intimate that after death the morning of 
the resurrection will appear from that instrument, that vast clock.  

There  are  many  varieties  of  resurrection  that  a  person  experiences  during  his 
lifetime. Just as he sees the signs of the resurrection through a sort of dying every night 
and rebirth every morning, so it is agreed that he undergoes what resembles a resurrection 
every  five  or  six  years  by  changing  all  the  particles  in  his  body,  and  even  undergoes  a 
gradual  resurrection  twice  a  year.  Also,  every  spring,  he  witnesses  more  than  three 
hundred  thousand  sorts  of  resurrection  and  rising  to  life  in  the  animal  and  plant 
kingdoms. 

Thus, so many signs and  indications and  marks of resurrection  most certainly point 
to  the  great  resurrection  of  the  dead  as  though  they  were  droplets  of  it.  An  All-Wise 
Maker causing a sort of resurrection  in that way  in the animal and plant worlds, that is, 
raising  to  life  exactly  the  same  all  plant  roots  and  certain  animals  in  the  spring,  and 
restoring other parts of them, such as leaves, flowers and fruits, not exactly the same but 
similar,  may  be  an  indication  of  a  personal  resurrection  in  the  human  individual  within 
the general resurrection. For the human individual is like a species in  

 

540 

comparison  with  the  other  animate  species,  and  the  light  of  the  mind  has  given  such  a 
breadth to human actions and thought that they encompass the past and the future. If he 
consumes  the  world  even,  he  is  not  satisfied.  In  the  other  species  the  nature  of  the 
individual is particular; its value is personal; its view, restricted; its qualities, limited; its 
pleasure and pain, instantaneous. Whereas man’s nature is exalted; his value, most high; 
his  view,  universal;  his  qualities,  limitless;  his  immaterial  pleasure  and  pain  in  part 
permanent.  In  which  case,  the  various  resurrections  which  are  repeated  in  the  other 
animate  species  self-evidently  tell  of  and  point  to  human  beings  being  resurrected  and 
restored to life exactly the same  in the great resurrection of the dead. Since  it is proved 
with the certainty of twice two equalling four in the Ninth Truth of the Tenth  Word, we 
cut short the discussion here. 

•  FIFTH  POINT:    Those  who  have  looked  closely  into  the  realities  of  creation 
consider that the unlimited potentialities included in the essence of man’s spirit, and the 
unlimited abilities contained  in those potentialities, and the  endless desires arising  from 
those  abilities,  and  the  infinite  hopes  resulting  from  those  endless  desires,  and  the 
limitless thoughts and ideas born of those infinite hopes are hands stretched out towards 
eternal  happiness, which  is  beyond this Manifest World, are eyes gazing at  it, that they 
are  turned  towards  it.  Thus,  man’s  nature,  which  cannot  lie,  and  the  definite,  intense, 
unwavering desire for eternal happiness in his nature inspire the conscience with certainty 
concerning  the  realization  of  eternal  happiness.  This  fact  is  demonstrated  as  clearly  as 
daylight in the Eleventh Truth of the Tenth Word, and so we cut this short here. 

• SIXTH  POINT: The  mercy of the  All-Beauteous Maker of these  beings, Who  is 
the  All-Merciful,  All-Compassionate  One,  points  to  eternal  happiness.  Yes,  it  is  of  the 
nature  of  that  mercy,  which  makes  bounty  bounty  and  saves  it  from  revenge,  not  to 
withhold from man eternal happiness, which delivers beings from the anguish of eternal 
separation. For if eternal happiness, the head, chief, aim, and result of all bounties, is not 
given,  and  if  after  dying,  the  world  is  not  resurrected  in  the  form  of  the  hereafter,  all 
bounties would be transformed into desire for revenge. And such a transformation would 
necessitate denying the  existence of  Divine  mercy, which  is self-evident and  necessary, 
and,  through  the  testimony  of  all  the  universe,  unquestionable  and  manifest.  It  is  a 
constant  truth  more  brilliant  than  the  sun.  Look  and  take  note  of  the  bounties  of  love, 
compassion, and reason, some of the manifestations and subtle traces of mercy. Suppose 
that  eternal  separation  and  unending  parting  are  going  to  drag out  human  life;  you  will 
see that tender love becomes a great calamity; sweet compassion, a great misfortune; that 
luminous reason, a great tribulation. That is to say, mercy  

 

541 

(because it is mercy) cannot confront true love with eternal separation. Since the Second 
Truth  of  the  Tenth  Word  has  demonstrated this  fact  most  beautifully,  we  cut  this  short 
here. 

• SEVENTH  POINT:  All the exquisiteness, all  the virtues, all the perfections, all 
the  attraction,  all  the  yearning,  all  the  compassion  known  and  seen  in  the  universe  are 
meanings, significations, immaterial words. They necessarily and self-evidently show to 
the  heart  and  thrust  in  the  mind’s  eye  the  manifestations  of  the  All-Glorious  Maker’s 
favour and kindness, benevolence and munificence. Since there is a truth, a reality, in this 
world,  most  certainly  there  is  true  mercy.  And  since  there  is  true  mercy,  there  will  be 
eternal happiness. The Fourth Truth of the Tenth Word, and also the Second Truth, have 
illuminated this fact as clearly as daylight. 

• EIGHTH POINT: Man’s conscience, which is his conscious nature, looks to and 
points  to  eternal  happiness.  Yes,  if  anyone  listens  to  his  own  awakened  conscience,  he 
will hear a voice crying: “Eternity! Eternity!” Should the whole universe be given to such 
a conscience, it could not satisfy its need for eternity. That is to say, the conscience being 
attracted and drawn in this way is possible only because it is attracted by a true aim and 
captivating truth. The conclusion of the Eleventh Truth of the Tenth Word demonstrates 
this fact. 

•  NINTH  POINT:    This  is  the  message  of  Muhammad  the  Arabian  (Peace  and 
blessings be upon him), who was truthful, veracious, and trustworthy. Indeed, his words 
opened  the  doors  of  eternal  happiness;  all  that  he  said  are  windows  opening  onto 
everlasting bliss. In fact, he held in his hand the consensus of all the prophets (Peace be 
upon them) and the unanimous agreement of all the saints, for after Divine unity, all their 
calls and efforts were concentrated on the resurrection of the dead and eternal happiness. 
Is there anything that could shake such a strength? The Twelfth Truth of the Tenth Word 
demonstrates this truth in the most obvious manner. 

• TENTH POINT:  This is the certain news of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, 
which has preserved its miraculousness in seven respects for thirteen centuries, and as is 
proved in the Twenty-Fifth Word, is a miracle through its forty sorts of miraculousness. 
Yes, this news of the Qur’an is the revealer of bodily resurrection, and the discloser of the 
enigmatic  talisman  of  the  world  and  the  key  to  the  wisdom  in  the  universe.  Also,  the 
certain  rational  proofs  contained  in  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition,  which  it  lays 
before  the  eyes,  commanding  that  they  be  pondered  over  are  thousands  in  number.  In 
short,  the  Qur’an  presents  for  man  to  study  a  great  many  verses  and  great  many 
telescopes revealing eternal bliss, like, 

542 

 

and, 

and,  

Say, “He will give them life Who created them in the first instance…,”14 

Seeing that He has created you in successive stages,15 

which comprise a comparison or analogy, and, 

Nor is your Sustainer ever unjust to His servants,16 

which  points  to  evidence  of  justice.  We  explained  in  our  treatise  entitled  Nokta  (The 
Point) the substance of the figurative analogy in,  

Seeing that He has created you in successive stages,17 

Say, ‘He will give them life Who created them in the first instance…’,18 

which the Qur’an makes clear through other verses. It was as follows: 

On  passing  from  stage  to  stage,  the  human  body  undergoes  wondrous  and  orderly 
transformations. From sperm to a blood-clot;  from a  blood-clot to flesh and  bone;  from 
flesh and bone to a new creation, that is, the transformation into human form; it follows 
extremely  precise  rules.  Each  of  these  stages  has  such  particular  laws,  such  determined 
order,  such  regular  development  that  it  displays  the  manifestations  of  a  purpose,  will, 
choice, and wisdom as though through glass. 

Thus, the All-Wise Maker, Who creates the body in this way, changes it every year 
as if it were clothes. For the body to be changed and for its continuance, a compound is 
necessary  so that new particles appear that will  work and  fill the place of the  parts that 
are  dissolved.  Since  the  body’s  cells  are  destroyed  through  an  orderly  Divine  law,  it 
requires  a  subtle  matter,  known  as  sustenance,  which  will  repair  it,  again  through  an 
orderly dominical law. The True Provider allots and distributes this sustenance through a 
particular law in relation to the different needs of the body’s members. 

Now, consider the behaviour of the subtle matter which the All-Wise Provider sends: 
you will see that while the matter’s particles are dispersed through the air, soil, and water 
like a caravan, they suddenly gather together in a way that suggests a deliberate action, as 
though they had suddenly received the order to move. They collect together in the most 
orderly  fashion  as  if  each  particle  of  them  was  entrusted  with  a  duty  and  ordered  to 
proceed to a specified place.  Also,  it  is  apparent from their conduct that they  are  being 
propelled through a particular law of one who acts and has choice, and  

                                                

14 Qur’an, 36:79. 
15 Qur’an, 71:14. 
16 Qur’an, 41:46. 
17 Qur’an, 71:14. 
18 Qur’an, 36:79. 

 

543 

from the realm of the inanimate are entering the animal kingdom. Then they enter a body 
as  sustenance  through  a  particular  rule,  and  with  a  determined  order  and  in  a  regular 
process,  and  after  being  cooked  in  the  four  kitchens  of  the  body,  undergoing  four 
amazing  transformations,  and  being  strained  through  four  filters,  they  are  apportioned 
through  regular  laws  and  the  beneficence  of  the  True  Provider  according  to  the  all-
different needs of the members, and are circulated to every part of the body. 

Thus, whichever of these particles you consider with the eye of wisdom, you will see 
that  blind  chance,  lawless  coincidence,  deaf  nature,  and  unconscious  causes  can  in  no 
way  interfere  with  it;  it  is  impelled  in  a  discerning,  orderly,  hearing,  and  knowing 
fashion.  For  whichever  stage  each  of  them  enters  from  the  surrounding  element  to  the 
body’s cell, it acts as though voluntarily through the specified laws of that stage. It enters 
it  in  an  orderly  fashion.  To  whichever  level  it  journeys,  it  steps  with  such  order  that  it 
appears  self-evidently to be proceeding at the command of an  All-Wise Mover. In this 
way, it gradually advances from stage to stage, and level to level until, at the command of 
its Sustainer, without deviating from its aim and object, it reaches its appropriate position, 
for example the pupil of Tevfik’s eye, where it establishes itself and works. 

This  situation,  that  is,  the  manifestation  of  dominicality  in  sustenance,  demontrates 
that  first  the  particles  were  determined;  they  were  appointed  to  the  task,  they  were 
designated to those positions. It  is as  if the  existence of an arrangement and order,  like 
“This will be the sustenance of so-and-so’s cells” being written on the forehead of each 
of them, points to each person’s sustenance being written on his forehead by the pen of 
Divine  Determining,  and  his  name  being  written  on  his  sustenance.  Is  it  at  all  possible 
that the  All-Glorious  Maker,  Who  nurtures  and  sustains  with  boundless  power  and  all-
encompassing wisdom, Who has absolute disposal over all beings from minute particles 
to  the  planets,  and  spins  them  with  order  and  balance,  should  not  bring  about  ‘the  last 
creation,’ or that he should be unable to do so? 

Thus, many verses of the Qur’an present to man’s view this wise last creation, which 
will take place at the resurrection of the dead and Great Gathering. It removes doubt and 
uncertainty. It says:  

Say, He will give them life Who created them in the first instance…19 

That is, the One Who created you from nothing in so wise a form is He Who will bring 
you to life again in the hereafter. And it says: 

And it is He Who begins [the process of] creation, then repeats it; and for Him it 
is most easy.20 

                                                

19 Qur’an, 36:79. 
20 Qur’an, 30:27. 

 

544 

That  is,  “Your  return  and  being  raised  to  life  at  the  resurrection  is  easier  and  more 
trouble-free than your creation in this world.” 

Just  as  it  is  easier  and  more  trouble-free  for  the  soldiers  of  a  regiment  who  have 
dispersed  to  rest  to  regather  under  the  regimental  flag  at  the  sound  of  a  bugle  than 
forming  a  new  regiment  from  scratch,  so  according  to  reason,  it  is  easier  and  more 
possible  than  the  first  creation  for  the  fundamental  particles  of  a  body,  which  are 
intermingled  and  familiar  and  connected  with  one  another,  to  regather  at  the  trumpet-
blast  of  the  angel  Israfil  (Peace  be  upon  him),  and  reply  to  the  All-Glorious  Creator’s 
command with, “Here we are, O Lord!” Anyway, perhaps  it  is  not necessary  for all the 
particles to regather. The fundamental parts and essential particles, which are like nuclei 
and  seeds,  and  are  called  “the  root  of  the  tail”  (the  coccyx)  in  a  Hadith,21  may  be 
sufficient  as  a  basis  of  the  second  creation.  The  All-Wise  Creator  may  construct  the 
human body on them. 

The  following  is a summary of the  judicial comparison  indicated by  verses  like the 

third one above: 

Nor is your Sustainer ever unjust to His servants. 

We often see  in this world that tyrannical, sinful  and cruel  men pass their  lives  in great 
ease and comfort, while the oppressed, upright and religious live under great difficulties 
and  in degradation. Then death comes and  makes the two equal. If this equality  had  no 
end  and  was  not  finite,  an  injustice  would  be  apparent.  However,  since  Divine  wisdom 
and justice are free of all inequity as is established by the testimony of the universe, they 
self-evidently require a  final assembly where the  former will  be punished and the  latter 
receive their reward. Then disorderly, wretched men may receive punishment and reward 
in  conformity  with  their  potentialities,  be  the  means  of  absolute  justice,  manifest 
dominical wisdom, and be the elder brother of all the beings in the world. 

For sure, the realm of this world does not allow for the blossoming of man’s limitless 
potentialities  contained  within  his  spirit.  This  means  he  will  be  sent  to  another  world. 
Man’s essence is indeed mighty, so he is designated for eternity. His nature is exalted, so 
his crimes are great. He does not resemble other beings. His order is important, too. He 
cannot live without order. He cannot live without meaning. He cannot be made  in  vain. 
He cannot be condemned to absolute extinction. He cannot escape to pure non-existence. 
Hell  has  opened  its  mouth,  and  awaits  him.  And  Paradise  has  opened  its  graceful 
embrace,  and  watches  him.  Since  the  Third  Truth  of  the  Tenth  Word  has  demonstrated 
these two examples most beautifully, we shall cut the discussion short here. 

                                                

21 Bukhari, Tafsir Sura al-Zumar, 3; Tafsir Sura al-Nabi, 1; Muslim, Fitan, 141-3. 

 

545 

By way of example, you may make analogies and study other verses from the Qur’an 

similar to the two above, which contain many subtle and rational proofs. 

Thus,  these  Ten  Sources  and  Central  Points  form  a  decisive  proof  and  certain 
supposition, and  just as this sound  hypothesis and powerful proof are decisive evidence 
for the cause and necessity of the resurrection and Day of Judgement, so —as is clearly 
proved  in the Tenth  Word— do most of the Most Beautiful Names,  like  All-Wise, All-
Compassionate,  Preserver,  and  All-Just,  require  the  coming  of  the  Last  Day  and 
resurrection, and the existence of everlasting bliss; they point clearly to the realization of 
eternal happiness. That is to say, the matters necessitating the resurrection of the dead and 
the  Day  of  Judgement  are  so  powerful  that  they  leave  no  room  at  all  for  any  doubt  or 
uncertainty. 

THIRD FUNDAMENTAL POINT 

The  Agent  possesses  the  power.  Without  doubt,  the  matters  necessitating  the 
resurrection of the dead exist. Also, the One  Who will  bring  it about  is powerful to the 
utmost degree. There is no deficiency in His power. The greatest things and the smallest 
are the same in relation to His power. It is as easy for Him to create the spring as to create 
a  flower.  Yes,  One  so  powerful  that  this  world  together  with  all  its  suns,  stars,  worlds, 
particles,  and  substance  bear  witness  to  His  sublimity  and  power  with  endless  tongues. 
Does any doubt or misgiving have the right to consider bodily resurrection remote from 
such a power? 

It  is  plain  to  see  that  every  age  within  this  world  an  All-Powerful  One  of  Glory 
creates a new, travelling, orderly universe. Indeed, He makes a new, well-ordered world 
each day. He perpetually creates and changes with perfect wisdom transient worlds and 
universes one after the other on the  face of the  heavens and the earth. He  hangs on the 
string  of  time  regular  worlds  to  the  number  of  the  centuries,  years,  indeed,  days,  and 
through them demonstrates the tremendousness of His power. He attaches to the head of 
the  globe  the  huge  flower  of  spring  which  he  adorns  with  a  hundred  thousand 
embroideries of resurrection as though it was a single flower, and through it displays the 
perfection of His wisdom and the beauty of His art. Can it be said of such a One, “How 
can  He  bring  about the  resurrection  of  the  dead,  and  how  can  He  transform  this  world 
into the hereafter?” The verse, 

Your creation and your resurrection is but like a single soul22 

proclaims the All-Powerful One’s perfect power, that nothing at all  is difficult for Him, 
that like the smallest thing, the greatest presents no  

                                                

22 Qur’an, 31:28. 

 

546 

difficulties  for  His  power,  and  that  it  is  as  easy  for  His  power  to  create  innumerable 
individuals as to create as a single one. We have explained the verse’s essential meaning 
briefly  in the  Conclusion to the Tenth  Word, and  in detail  in the treatise entitled Nokta 
(The Point), and in the Twentieth Letter. In connection with the discussion here, we shall 
elucidate a part of it in the form of three ‘Matters’, as follows: 

Divine Power is essential, in which case, impotence cannot intervene in it. Also, it is 
connected to the inner dimensions of things, so obstacles cannot become interpenetrated 
with it. Also, its relation is according to laws, so particulars are equal to universals, minor 
things are like comprehensive ones. We shall prove these three matters. 

FIRST MATTER: Pre-Eternal Power is the necessary inherent quality of the Most 
Pure and Holy Divine Essence. That is to say, it is of necessity intrinsic to the Essence, it 
can in no way be separated from It. Since this is so, the Essence which necessitates that 
power  clearly  cannot  be  affected  by  impotence,  the  opposite  to  power.  For  if  that  were 
the case, it would entail the combining of opposites. Since the Essence cannot be affected 
by impotence, self-evidently it cannot intervene in the power which is the inherent quality 
of  that Essence.  Since  impotence  cannot  intervene  in  that  essential  power,  clearly  there 
can be no degrees in it. For the degrees of existence of a thing are though the intervention 
of its opposites.  

For example, the degrees of heat are through the intervention of cold, and the degrees 
of beauty through the intervention of ugliness; further examples can be made in the same 
way.  Since  in  contingent  beings  these  qualities  are  not  true,  natural,  and  inherent, 
necessary  qualities,  their  opposites  may  enter  them.  With  the  existence  of  degrees, 
diversity, variance, and change arose in the world. Since there can be no degrees in Pre-
Eternal power, of necessity, those things decreed by it will be the same in relation to it. 
The  greatest  will  be  equal  to  the  smallest,  and  particles  the  same  as  the  stars.  The 
resurrection of all mankind will be as easy for that power as the raising to life of a single 
individual;  the  creation  of  spring  as  easy  as  the  giving  of  form  to  a  single  flower. 
Whereas if attributed to causes, the creation of a single flower would be as difficult as the 
spring. 

It has been proved in the footnote to the last section of the Fourth Degree of ‘God is 
Most Great’ in the Second Station of this Word, and in the Twenty-Second Word, and in 
the Twentieth Letter and in its Addendum, that when the creation of beings is attributed 
to the Single One of Unity, all things become as easy as one thing. If they are attributed 
to causes, the creation of a single thing becomes as difficult and problematical as that of 
all things.

SECOND MATTER: Divine power  is related to the  inner  face of things. Yes, the 
universe  has  two  faces  like  a  mirror.  One  is  its  external  face,  which  resembles  the 
coloured face of the mirror, the other is its face which looks to its Creator. This resembles 
the  mirror’s shining  face. Its external  face  is the  arena of opposites. It is  where  matters 
like  beautiful  and  ugly,  good  and  evil,  big  and  small,  difficult  and  easy  appear.  It  is 
because  of  this  that  the  All-Glorious  Maker  has  made  apparent  causes  a  veil  to  the 
disposal  of  His  power,  so  that  the  hand  of  power  should  not  appear  to  the  mind  to  be 
directly concerned  with  matters that on the  face  of  it are  insignificant or unworthy. For 
majesty and dignity require it to be thus. But He did not give a true effect to causes and 
intermediaries, because the unity of oneness requires that they have none.  

As for the face of beings which looks to its Creator, in everything it is shining, it is 
clean. The colours and distortions of individuality do not intervene in it. This aspect faces 
its  Creator  without  intermediary.  There  are  no  chains  and  disposition  of  causes  in  it. 
Cause and effect cannot intrude on it. It contains nothing contorted or askew. Obstacles 
cannot interfere in it. A particle becomes brother to the sun. 

In  Short:    Divine  power  is  both  simple,  and  infinite,  and  essential.  The  place 
connected  to  Divine  power  has  neither  intermediary,  nor  stain,  nor  is  it  the  scene  of 
rebellion. Therefore, within the sphere of Divine power great does not take pride of place 
over  small.  The  community  does  not  take  preference  over  the  individual.  Universals 
cannot expect more from Divine power than particulars. 

THIRD MATTER:  Divine power’s relation is according to laws. That is to say, it 
regards  many and  few, great and small as the same. We shall  make this abstruse  matter 
easier to understand with a number of comparisons. 

In  the  universe,  Transparency,  Reciprocity,  Balance,  Order,  Disengagedness,  and 

Obedience are all matters which render many equal to few, and great equal to small. 

First Comparison:  This explains the Mystery of Transparency. 
For  example,  the  sun’s  image  and  reflection,  which  are  its  radiance  and 
manifestation, display the same identity on the sea’s surface and in every drop of the sea. 
If the globe of the earth was composed of varying fragments of glass and exposed to the 
sun  without  veil,  the  sun’s  reflection  would  be  the  same  in  every  fragment  and  on  the 
whole  face  of  the  earth,  without  obstruction  or  being  divided  into  pieces  or  being 
diminished. If, let us suppose, the sun acted with will and through its will conferred the 
radiance of its light and image of its reflection, it would not be more difficult for it to  

 

548 

confer its radiance on the whole surface of the earth than to confer it on a single particle. 

Second Comparison:  This concerns the Mystery of Reciprocity. 
For example, let us suppose there is a vast ring composed of living beings, that is, of 
human beings, each holding a mirror. At its centre is an individual holding a candle. The 
radiance and manifestation reflected in all the mirrors surrounding the central point will 
be the same, and its relation will be without obstacle, fragmentation or being diminished. 

Third Comparison:  This concerns the Mystery of Balance. 
For example, there are an enormous set of scales  which are extremely accurate and 
sensitive.  Whichever  of  two  suns  or  two  stars  or  two  mountains  or  two  eggs  or  two 
particles are placed in its two pans, it will require the same force to raise one pan of those 
huge sensitive scales to the sky and lower the other to the ground. 

Fourth Comparison:  This concerns the Mystery of Order. 
For example, a huge ship can be turned as easily as a tiny toy boat. 
Fifth Comparison:  This concerns the Mystery of Disengagedness. 
For example, a nature disengaged from individuality regards all particulars from the 
smallest  to  the  greatest  as  the  same  and  enters  them  without  being  diminished  or 
fragmented. The qualities present  in the aspect of external  individuality do not interfere 
and cause confusion; they do not alter the view of a disengaged nature such as that. For 
example, a fish like a needle possesses such a disengaged nature the same as a whale. Or 
a microbe bears an animal nature the same as a rhinoceros. 

Sixth Comparison:  This demonstrates the Mystery of Obedience. 
For  example,  a  commander  causes  a  single  private  to  advance  with  the  command 
“Forward march!” the same as he causes an army to advance. The truth of the mystery of 
this comparison about obedience is as follows: 

As is proved by experience, everything in the universe has a point of perfection, and 
everything  has  an  inclination  towards  that  point.  Increased  inclination  becomes  need. 
Increased  need  becomes  desire.  Increased  desire  becomes  attraction,  and  attraction, 
desire, need, and inclination are each seeds and kernels which together with the essences 
of things conform to the creative commands of Almighty God. The absolute perfection of 
the true nature of contingent beings is absolute existence. Their particular perfections are 
an  existence  peculiar  to  each  which  makes  each  being’s  abilities  emerge  from  the 
potential to the actual. Thus, the obedience of the whole universe to the Divine command 
“Be!” is the same as that of a particle, which is like a  

 

549 

single  soldier.  Contained  all  together  in  the  obedience  and  conformity  of  contingent 
beings  to  the  pre-eternal  command  of  “Be!”  proceeding  from  the  Pre-Eternal  will  are 
inclination, need, desire, and attraction, which are also manifestations of Divine will. The 
fact that when subtle water receives the command to freeze, with a refined inclination it 
may split a piece of iron demontrates the strength of the mystery of obedience. 

If these six comparisons are observed in the potentialities and actions of contingent 
beings, which are both defective, and finite, and weak, and have no actual effect, without 
doubt  it  will  be  seen  that  everything  is  equal  in  relation  to  Pre-Eternal  power,  which  is 
both  pre-eternal,  and  post-eternal,  and  creates  the  whole  universe  out  of  pure  non-
existence, and being manifested through the works of its tremendousness leaves all minds 
in wonderment. Nothing at all can be difficult for it. Such a power cannot be weighed on 
the  small  scales  of  these  mysteries,  neither  are  they  proportionate.  They  have  been 
mentioned to bring the subject closer to the understanding and to dispel any doubts. 

Result and Summary of the Third Fundamental Point:  

Since  pre-eternal  power  is  infinite,  and  it  is  the  inherent,  necessary  quality  of  the 
Most Pure and Holy Essence; and since the stainless, veilless inner aspect of everything 
is turned to it and faces it, and is in balance with respect to contingency, which consists 
of the equal possibility of being and non-being; and since this inner face is obedient to the 
order of creation and the Divine laws of the universe which form the Greater Shari‘a, the 
Shari‘a  of  Creation,  and  it  is  disengaged  from  and  free  of  obstacles  and  different 
characteristics; certainly, like the smallest thing, the greatest cannot resist that power, nor 
expect more from it than the smallest. In which case, the raising to life of all beings with 
spirits at the resurrection is not more difficult for Divine power than raising a fly to life in 
the spring. Thus, the decree of: 

Your creation and your resurrection is but like a single soul,23 

is  no  exaggeration;  it  is  true  and  correct.  And  our  claim  that  “the  Agent  possesses  the 
power”  has  been  proved  true  in  decisive  fashion;  there  is  nothing  to  hinder  it  in  this 
respect. 

FOURTH FUNDAMENTAL POINT 

Just  as  there  are  things  necessitating  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  and  Great 
Gathering,  and  the  One  Who  will  bring  it  about  possesses  the  power  to  do  so,  so  the 
world possesses the potential for the resurrection of the dead  

                                                

23 Qur’an, 31:28. 

 

550 

and Great Gathering. There are four ‘Matters’ in this assertion of mine that ‘this place is 
possible.’ 

The First is the possibility of this world’s death. 
The Second is its actual death. 
The  Third  is  the  possibility  of  the  destroyed,  dead  world  being  reconstructed  and 

resurrected in the form of the hereafter. 

The Fourth is its actual reconstruction and resurrection, which are possible. 
FIRST MATTER:  The universe’s death is possible. For if something is included in 
the law of the process of perfection, there is bound to be growth and development in it. 
And  if there  is growth and development, that thing is bound to have a natural  life-span. 
And  if  it  has  a  natural  life-span,  there  is  bound  to  be  a  time  for  its  natural  death.  It  is 
established  by  inductive  reasoning  and  extensive  investigation  that  it  cannot  save  itself 
from the claws of death. Indeed,  just as  man  is the  microcosm, and  he cannot be saved 
from destruction, the world too is the  macroanthropos;  it neither can  be  saved  from the 
clutches of death. It too will die and will then be resurrected, or it will lie in repose and 
then open its eyes in the morning of the resurrection. 

Also, just as a living tree, which is a miniature copy of the universe, cannot save its 
life from destruction and dissolution, so the chain-like universe, which has branched out 
from the tree of creation, cannot save itself from destruction and dispersal in order to be 
repaired  and  renewed.  If,  with  the  permission  of  the  pre-eternal  will,  some  external 
disease or destructive event do not befall the world  before the time of  its  natural death, 
and its All-Wise Maker also does not demolish it before that time, for sure, according to 
scientific reckoning, a day will come when the meanings and mysteries of the verse: 

When the sun is rolled up; * When the stars tumble; * When the mountains are 
swept away; * When the she-camels, ten months with young, are left untended; * 
When the wild beasts are herded together; * When the oceans boil over;24 

will  become  manifest with the permission of the  Pre-Eternal  All-Powerful One, and the 
death agonies of the macroanthropos which is the world will begin; it will fill space and 
make it reverberate with an appalling death-rattle and devastating sound; roaring, it will 
die. Then, at the Divine command, it will return to life once more. 

                                                

24 Qur’an, 81:1-6. 

 

551 

A Subtle, Allusive Matter 

Just as water freezes to its own detriment, and ice melts to its own detriment, and a 
kernel  gains  strength  to  the  detriment  of  the  shell,  and  a  word  becomes  coarse  to  the 
detriment of the  meaning, and the spirit weakens on account of the  body, and the  body 
becomes  finer  on  account  of  the  spirit,  so  too  this  world,  the  dense  world,  becomes 
transparent  and  refined  with  the  functioning  of  the  machine  of  life  on  account  of  the 
hereafter, which is the subtle world. Creative power sprinkling the light of life on dense, 
lifeless, extinguished, dead objects with an astonishing activity is a sign that it dissolves, 
burns,  and  illuminates  this  dense  world  with  the  light  of  life  on  account  of  the  subtle 
world. 

No  matter  how  weak  reality  is,  it  does  not  die;  it  is  not  annihilated  like  a  form. 
Rather,  it  travels  in  individuals  and  forms.  Reality  grows,  develops,  and  gradually 
expands,  while  the  shell  and  the  form  wear  out,  become  finer,  and  break  up.  They  are 
renewed  in  a  better  form  so  as  to  become  suitable  to  the  stature  of  the  stable  and 
expanded  reality.  In  regard  to  increase  and  decrease,  reality  and  form  are  in  inverse 
proportion. That is to say, the more substantial form grows, the weaker reality becomes. 
The less substantial form becomes, to that degree the reality grows stronger. 

Thus,  this  law  encompasses  all  things  included  in  the  law  of  the  process  of 
perfection. This means that a time is certain to come when the Manifest World, which is 
the  shell  and  form  of  the  mighty  reality  of  the  universe,  will  break  up,  with  the 
permission  of  the  All-Glorious  Creator.  Then  it  will  be  renewed  in  a  better  form.  The 
meaning will be realized of the verse: 

That day the Earth will be changed into a different Earth.25 

In Short:  The death of the world is possible. Moreover, there can be no doubt that it 

is possible. 

SECOND MATTER:  This is the actual death of the world. The proof of this matter 
is  the  consensus  of  all  the  revealed  religions;  the  testimony  of  all  sound  natures;  the 
indication  of  all  the  changes,  transformations,  and  alterations  in  the  universe;  the 
testimony to the number of centuries and years through their deaths in this guesthouse of 
the world, of all living worlds and mobile worlds to the death of the world itself. 

If you want to imagine the death agonies of the world as the Qur’an points them out, 
think  of  how  the  parts  of  the  universe  are  bound  to  one  another  with  an  exact,  exalted 
order. They are held with such a hidden, delicate, subtle bond and are so bound within an 
order that on a single one  

                                                

25 Qur’an, 14:48. 

 

552 

of the  lofty  heavenly  bodies receiving the command:  “Be!” or, “Leave  your orbit!”, the 
world  will  go  into  its  death  agonies.  The  stars  will  collide,  the  heavenly  bodies  reel,  a 
great din will strike up in infinite space like the devastating sound of millions of cannon-
balls and great guns the size of globes. Clashing and colliding with one another, sending 
out showers of sparks, the mountains taking flight, the seas burning, the face of the earth 
will be flattened. 

Thus, through this death and those agonies the Pre-Eternal One of Power will shake 
up the universe. He will purify the universe, and Hell and the matters of Hell will draw to 
one side, and Paradise and the matters appropriate for Paradise draw to the other, and the 
world of the hereafter will become manifest. 

THIRD MATTER:  The return to life of the world, which will die, is possible. For, 
as  is  proved  in  the  Second  Fundamental  Point, there  is  no  deficiency  in  Divine  power, 
and the things necessitating it are extremely powerful. The matter is within the realm of 
the possible. And if a possible matter has something extremely powerful necessitating it, 
and there is no deficiency in the power of the agent, it may be regarded not as possible, 
but as actual. 

An Allusive Point 

If the universe is studied carefully, it will be seen that within it are two elements that 
have  spread  everywhere  and  become  rooted;  with  their  traces  and  fruits  like  good  and 
evil,  beauty  and  ugliness,  benefit  and  harm,  perfection  and  defect,  light  and  darkness, 
guidance  and  misguidance,  light  and  fire,  belief  and  unbelief,  obedience  and  rebellion, 
and fear and love, opposites clash with one another in the universe. They are constantly 
manifested  through  change  and  transformation.  Their  wheels  turn  like  the  workshop  of 
the crops of some other world. 

Of a certainty, the branches and results, which are opposites, of those two elements 
will continue into eternity; they will become concentrated and separate from one another. 
Then  they  will  be  manifested  in  the  form  of  Paradise  and  Hell.  Since  it  is  out  of  this 
transient  world  that  the  permanent  world  will  be  made,  its  fundamental  elements  will 
certainly go to eternity and permanence. 

Indeed,  Paradise  and  Hell  are  the  two  fruits  of  the  branch  of  the  tree  of  creation, 
which stretches, inclines, and goes towards eternity; they are the two results of the chain 
of  the  universe;  the  two  storehouses  of  this  flood  of  Divine  activity;  the  two  pools  of 
beings, which flow in waves towards eternity; and the place of manifestation, the one of 
Divine favour, the other of Divine wrath. When the hand of power shakes up the universe 
with a violent motion, those two pools will fill up with the appropriate matters. 

 

553 

The secret of this Allusive Point is as follows: 

As  eternal  benevolence  and  pre-eternal  wisdom  necessitated,  the  Pre-Eternally  All-
Wise One created this world to be a place of  trial, an arena of examination, a  mirror to 
His  Most  Beautiful  Names,  and  a  page  for  the  pen  of  Divine  Determining  and  power. 
Now, trial and examination are the cause of growth and development. And growth causes 
the disposition to unfold. And this unfolding causes the abilities to become apparent. And 
this  emergence  of  the  abilities  causes  the  relative  truths  to  become  evident.  And  the 
relative  truths’  becoming  evident  causes  the  embroideries  of  the  manifestations  of  the 
All-Glorious  Maker’s  Most  Beautiful  Names  to  be  displayed,  and  the  universe  to  be 
transformed  into a  missive of the Eternally  Besought One. It  is through this  mystery of 
examination  and  the  mystery  of  man’s  accountability  that  the  diamond-like  essences  of 
elevated spirits are purified of the coal-like matter of base spirits, and the two separated 
out from one another. 

Thus, since it was for mysteries such as these, and for other most subtle and elevated 
instances of wisdom  which we do not yet know  of that the Pre-Eternally  All-Wise One 
willed the world in this form, He also willed the change and transformation of this world 
for  those  instances  of  wisdom.  He  mixed  together  opposites  for  its  change  and 
transformation, and  brought them  face to face. Combining  harm with  benefit,  including 
evil with good, and mingling ugliness with beauty, He kneaded them together like dough, 
and  made  the  universe  subject  to the  law  of  change  and  mutation,  and  the  principle  of 
transformation and perfection. 

A day will come when this assembly of examination is closed, and the period of trial 
is  finished,  and  the  Divine  Names  have  carried  out their  decree,  and  the  pen  of  Divine 
Determining  has  completed  writing  its  missives,  and  Divine  power  completed  the 
embroideries of its art, and beings have fulfilled their duties, and creatures accomplished 
their acts of service, and everything has stated its meaning, and this world produced the 
seedlings  of  the  hereafter,  and  the  earth  has  displayed  and  exhibited  all  the  miracles  of 
power of the All-Powerful Maker, and all the wonders of His art, and this transient world 
has attached to the string of time the tableaux forming the panoramas of eternity. 

For  the  eternal  wisdom  and  pre-eternal  beneficence  of  the  All-Glorious  Maker 
necessitate truths like the results of the examination and trial, the truths of those Divine 
Names’ manifestations, the truths of the missives of the pen of Divine Determining, the 
originals of those sample-like embroideries of art, the aims and benefits of the duties of 
beings, the wages of the acts of service of creatures, the truths of the meanings the book 
of the universe stated, the sprouting of the seeds of innate disposition, the opening  

 

554 

of  a  Supreme  Court  of  Judgement,  the  displaying  of  the  sample-like  panoramas  taken 
from  this  world,  the  rending  of  the  veil  of  apparent  causes,  and  the  surrendering  of 
everything  directly  to  the  All-Glorious  Creator.  Since  the  All-Glorious  Maker’s  pre-
eternal wisdom and  beneficence  necessitate these truths, they require the purification of 
those oppoites  in order to deliver the world  from change and transience, transformation 
and extinction, and to separate out the causes of change and the matters of conflict. And 
most certainly they will bring about the resurrection and purify those opposites in order to 
obtain these results. 

Thus, as a result of this purification Hell will take on its eternal and dreadful  form, 

and its inmates will manifest the threat: 

And get you apart this day, O you sinners!26 

While  Paradise  will  assume  its  everlasting  and  majestic  form,  and  its  people  and 
companions will manifest the address of: 

Peace be upon you! Well have you done! Enter here to dwell for ever.27 

As is proved in the Second Question of the First Station of the Twenty-Eighth Word, 
through  His  perfect  power, the  Pre-Eternally  All-Wise  One  will  give  the  inhabitants  of 
these two houses eternal and permanent bodies which will not be subject to dissolution, 
change, old age, or decline. For there will be no causes of change, which are the cause of 
decline. 

FOURTH MATTER:  This is possible, it will occur. Indeed, after dying, the world 
will be resurrected as the hereafter. After being destroyed, the One Who made the world 
will  repair  and  reconstruct  it  in  an  even  better  form,  and  will  convert  it  into one  of  the 
mansions of the hereafter. Just as the proof of this is, foremost, the agreement of the Holy 
Qur’an  together  with  all  its  verses  comprising  thousands  of  rational  proofs  and  all  the 
revealed scriptures, so do the attributes of the All-Glorious One pertaining to His might 
and  those  pertaining  to  His  beauty,  and  all  His  Beautiful  Names,  clearly  indicate  its 
occurrence. So too did He promise He would create the resurrection and Great Gathering 
through  all  His  heavenly  decrees  which  He  sent  to  His  prophets.  And  since  He  has 
promised, most certainly shall He bring it about. You may refer to the Eighth Truth of the 
Tenth Word concerning this matter. 

Also,  just as  foremost Muhammad the  Arabian (Peace and  blessings  be upon  him), 
with  the  strength  of  his  thousand  miracles,  and  all  the  prophets  and  messengers,  saints 
and the righteous agreed on its occurrence and gave  

                                                

26 Qur’an, 36:59. 
27 Qur’an, 39:73. 

 

555 

news of it, so does the universe together with all its creational signs tell of its occurrence. 
In Short:  The Tenth Word with all its truths, and the Twenty-Eighth Word with all 
its proofs in the ‘Especially’s’ in its Second Station, have demonstrated with the certainty 
of the sun’s rising in the morning after setting the previous evening that after the setting 
of the life of this world, the sun of truth will appear once more in the form of the life of 
the hereafter. 

Thus, seeking assistance from the Divine Name of All-Wise and benefiting from the 
effulgence of the Qur’an, from the beginning up to here our explanations have taken the 
form of four ‘Fundamental Points’ in order to prepare the heart for acceptance, the soul 
for surrender, and to convince the reason. But who are we that we should  speak of this 
matter?  What  does  this  world’s  true  Owner,  the  universe’s  Creator,  these  beings’s 
Master, say? We should listen to Him. Can others dare to interfere officiously while the 
Owner of this domain speaks? 

We  must  listen  to  the  Pre-Eternal  Discourse  of  the  All-Wise  Maker  which  He 
delivers addressing all the ranks of those of each successive century in the mosque of the 
world and place of instruction which is the earth, with thousands of decrees like, 

When the Earth is rocked with a great convulsion, 
And the Earth casts out its burdens, 
And man cries out: “What is happening to it?” 
On that Day it will relate what all those upon it have done.  
For so your Sustainer will have commanded it. 
On that Day men will go forth in groups to the Judgement, to receive requital for 
their former deeds. 
Then anyone who has done an atom’s weight of good, shall see it. 
And anyone who has done an atom’s weight of evil, shall see it,28 

which causes the earth to tremble, and, 

But give glad tidings to those who believe and do good works that theirs shall be 
Paradises beneath  which flow  rivers. Whenever they are given fruits therefrom 
as  sustenance,  they  will  say:  “This  is  what  we  ate  before  as  sustenance,”  for 
they  shall  be  offered  it  in  a form  resembling  that  of  this  world.  And  they  shall 
have there women pure and good, and they shall dwell there for ever,29 

which  fills all  creatures with  joy and  eagerness. We  must give  heed to these decrees of 
the Possessor of All Dominion, the Owner of This World and the  

                                                

28 Qur’an, 99:1-8. 
29 Qur’an, 2:25. 

556

Next, and we must say, “We believe in it and we affirm it.” 

All glory be unto You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught
us; indeed You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.30 
O  our  Sustainer,  do  not  punish  us  if  we  forget  or  do  wrong.31  O  God,  grant

The Thirtieth Word 

 [This Word explains the talisman of creation by solving an important talisman 
of the All-Wise Qur’an. It is an explanation of ‘Ene’1 and ‘Zerre’2 to the extent 
of an ‘Alif’3 and a ‘Point’.4 It consists of two Aims. The first of these concerns 
the nature and result of the human ‘I’, and the second, the motion and duties of 
minute particles.] 

First Aim 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
We did indeed offer the Trust to the heavens, and the earth, and the mountains; 
but  they  refused  to  undertake  it  being  afraid  thereof.  But  man  assumed  it; 
indeed, he is most unjust, most foolish.5 

We shall indicate a single jewel from the great treasure of this verse, as follows. 
The ‘I’  is one component, one aspect, of the  numerous aspects of the ‘Trust’, from 
the  bearing  of  which  the  sky,  earth,  and  mountains  shrank,  and  of  which  they  were 
frightened.  Indeed,  from  the  time  of  Adam  until  now,  the  ‘I’  has  been  the  seed  of  a 
terrible tree of Zaqqum6 and at the same time, of a luminous tree of Tuba,7 which shoot 
out branches around the world of mankind. Before attempting to elucidate this vast truth, 
we  shall  give  an  explanation  by  way  of  an  introduction  which  will  facilitate  the 
understanding of it. 

                                                

1 The Turkish for ‘I’ or ‘ego’. To avoid confusion with other interpretations, ‘ene’ has been translated 

throughout as the ‘I’, and ‘enaniyet’ as ‘I-ness’. [Tr.] 
2 The Turkish for a mote, atom, or particle. [Tr.] 
3 The first letter of the Arabic alphabet consisting of a vertical stroke, (Ç). [Tr.] 
4 The equivalent of the dot in English, also indicating a small quantity. [Tr.]

Just as the ‘I’ is the key to the Divine Names, which are hidden treasures, so is it the 
key  to  the  locked  talisman  of  creation;  it  is  a  problem-solving  riddle,  a  wondrous 
talisman.  When  its  nature  is known,  both the  ‘I’  itself, that strange riddle, that amazing 
talisman, is disclosed, and it discloses the talisman of the universe and the treasures of the 
Necessary  World.  We  have  discussed  this  problem  as  follows  in  my  Arabic  treatise, 
Şemme (Intimations). 

The key to the world is in the hand of man and is attached to his self. For while being 
apparently open, the doors of the universe are in fact closed. God Almighty has given to 
man by way of a Trust, such a key, called the ‘I’, that it opens all the doors of the world; 
He has given him an enigmatic ‘I’ with which he may discover the hidden treasures of the 
Creator of the universe. But the ‘I’ is also an extremely complicated riddle and a talisman 
that is difficult to solve. When its true nature and the purpose of its creation are known, 
as it is itself solved, so will be the universe. 

The All-Wise Maker gave to man as a Trust an ‘I’ which comprises indications and 
samples that show and cause to recognize the truths of the attributes and functions of His 
dominicality,  so  that  the  ‘I’  might  be  a  unit  of  measurement  and  the  attributes  of 
dominicality and functions of Divinity might be known. However, it is not necessary for 
a unit of measurement to have actual existence; like hypothetical lines in geometry, a unit 
of measurement may be formed by hypothesis and supposition. It is not necessary for its 
actual existence to be established by concrete knowledge and proofs. 

Question:  Why  is  knowledge  of  the  attributes  and  Names  of  God  Almighty 

connected to the ‘I’? 

The  Answer:  Since  an  absolute  and  all-encompassing  thing  has  no  limits  or  end, 
neither  may  a  shape  be  given  to  it,  nor  may  a  form  be  conferred  on  it,  nor  may  it  be 
determined; what its quiddity is may not be comprehended. For example, an endless light 
without  darkness  may  not  be  known  or  perceived.  But  if  a  line  of  real  or  imaginary 
darkness  is  drawn,  then  it  becomes  known.  Thus,  since  God  Almighty’s  attributes  like 
knowledge  and  power,  and  Names  like  All-Wise  and  All-Compassionate  are  all-
encompassing, limitless, and without like, they may not be determined, and what they are 
may not be known or perceived. Therefore, since they do not have limits or an actual end, 
it is necessary to draw a hypothetical and imaginary limit. The ‘I’ does this. It imagines in 
itself  a  fictitious  dominicality,  ownership,  power,  and  knowledge:  it  draws  a  line.  By 
doing this it places an imaginary limit on the all-encompassing attributes, saying, “Up to 
here,  mine,  after  that,  His;”  it  makes  a  division.  With  the  tiny  units  of  measurement  in 
itself, it slowly understands the true nature of the attributes. 

For  example,  with  its  imagined  dominicality  over  what  it  owns,  the  ‘I’  may 

understand the dominicality of its Creator over contingent creation.  

 

559 

And  with  its  apparent  ownership,  it  may  understand  the  true  ownership  of  its  Creator, 
saying:  “Like  I  am  the  owner  of  this  house,  so  too  is  the  Creator  the  owner  of  the 
universe.” And with its partial knowledge, it may understand His knowledge, and with its 
small amount of acquired art, it may understand the originative art of the Glorious Maker. 
For example, the ‘I’ says: “As I made this house and arranged it, so someone must have 
made the universe and arranged it,” and so on. Thousands of mysterious states, attributes, 
and  perceptions  which  make  known  and  show  to  a  degree  all  the  Divine  attributes  and 
functions are contained within the ‘I’. That is to say, the ‘I’ is mirror-like, and, like a unit 
of measurement and tool for discovery, it has an indicative meaning; having no meaning 
in itself, it shows the meaning of others. It is a conscious strand from the thick rope of the 
human being, a fine thread from the raiment of the essence of humanity, it is an Alif from 
the book of the character of mankind, and it has two faces. 

The  first of  these  faces  looks  towards  good  and  existence.  With  this  face  it  is  only 
capable of receiving  favour;  it accepts what is given,  itself  it cannot create. This  face  is 
not active, it does not have the ability to create. Its other face looks towards evil and goes 
to non-existence. That face is active, it has the power to act. Furthermore, the real nature 
of the ‘I’ is indicative; it shows the meaning of things other than itself. Its dominicality is 
imaginary. Its existence is so weak and insubstantial that in itself it cannot bear or support 
anything at all. Rather, it is a sort of scale or measure, like a thermometer or barometer, 
that  indicates  the  degrees  and  amounts  of  things;  it  is  a  measure  that  makes  known  the 
absolute, all-encompassing and limitless attributes of the Necessary Being. 

Thus, he who knows his own self in this way, and realizes and acts according to it, is 

included in the good news of, 

Truly he succeeds who purifies it.8 

He  truly  carries  out  the  Trust,  and  through  the  telescope  of  his  ‘I’,  he  sees  what  the 
universe  is  and  what  duties  it  is  performing.  When  he  obtains  information  about  the 
universe, he sees that his ‘I’ confirms it. This knowledge will remain as light and wisdom 
for  him,  and  will  not  be  transformed  into  darkness  and  futility.  When  the  ‘I’  fulfils  its 
duty in this way, it abandons its imaginary dominicality and supposed ownership, which 
are the units of  measurement, and  it says:  “His  is the sovereignty and to Him  is due all 
praise; His  is the  judgement and to Him  will  you all  be  brought back.” It achieves true 
worship. It attains the rank of ‘the Most Excellent of Patterns.’9 

But  if,  forgetting  the  wisdom  of  its  creation  and  abandoning  the  duty  of  its  nature, 

the ‘I’ views itself solely in the light of its nominal and apparent  

                                                

8 Qur’an, 91:9. 
9 Qur’an, 95:4. 

 

560 

meaning, if it believes that it owns itself, then it betrays the Trust, and it comes under the 
category of, 

And he fails who corrupts its.10 

It was of this aspect of the Trust, therefore, which gives rise to all ascribing of partners to 
God,  evil,  and  misguidance,  that the  heavens,  earth,  and  mountains  were  terrified;  they 
were frightened of associating hypothetical partners with God. 

Indeed,  if  the  ‘I’  is  not  known  for  what  it  is,  an  insubstantial  Alif,  a  thread,  a 
hypothetical line, it may burgeon in concealment under the ground, gradually swelling. It 
will permeate all parts of a  human  being. Like a  gigantic dragon  it will  swallow up the 
human being; that entire person with all his faculties will, quite simply, become pure ‘I’. 
Then  too,  the  ‘I-ness’  of  the  human  race  gives  strength  to  the  individual  ‘I-ness’  by 
means of human racialism and national racialism, and the ‘I’, gaining support from the ‘I-
ness’ of the human race, contests the commands of the Glorious Maker, like Satan. Then, 
using  itself  as a  yardstick,  it compares  everyone, everything even, with  itself;  it divides 
God  Almighty’s  sovereignty  between  them  and  other  causes.  It  falls  into  ascribing 
partners to God on a vast scale, indicating the meaning of: 

To assign partners to God is verily a great transgression.11 

It is just like a man who steals a brass coin from the public treasury; he can only  justify 
his action by agreeing to take a silver coin for each of his friends who is present. So the 
man who says: “I own myself,” must believe and say: “Everything owns itself.” 

Thus,  while  in  this  treacherous  position,  the  ‘I’  is  in  absolute  ignorance.  Even  if  it 
knows thousands of branches of science, with compounded ignorance it is most ignorant. 
For  when  its  senses  and  thoughts  yield  the  lights  of  knowledge  of  the  universe,  those 
lights are extinguished  because such an  ‘I’ does not find any  material within  itself  with 
which to confirm,  illuminate, and perpetuate them.  Whatever  it encounters  is dyed with 
the  colours  that  are  within  it.  Even  if  it  encounters  pure  wisdom,  the  wisdom  takes  the 
form, within that ‘I’ , of absolute futility. For the colour of an ‘I’ that is in this condition 
is  atheism  and  ascribing  partners  to  God,  it  is  denial  of  God  Almighty.  If  the  whole 
universe is full of shining signs, a dark point in the  ‘I’ hides them from view, as though 
extinguished. 

The  nature of  man and the  ‘I’ within  his  nature have  been explained  clearly  and  in 
detail  in  the  Eleventh  Word,  as  indicating  something  other  than  themselves.  They  are 
shown to be a most sensitive scale and accurate

measure, an encompassing index and perfect map, a comprehensive mirror, and a fitting 
calendar and diary for the universe. Since we consider the explanation in that Word to be 
sufficient and it may be referred to, we curtail and conclude the introduction here. If you 
have understood the introduction, come, let us enter upon the truth. 

*  *  * 

Consider this: in the world of humanity, from the time of Adam up to now, two great 
currents, two lines of thought, have always  been  and will so continue. Like two mighty 
trees, they have spread out their branches in all directions and in every class of humanity. 
One of them is the line of prophethood and religion, the other the line of philosophy in its 
various  forms.  Whenever  those  two  lines  have  been  in  agreement  and  united,  that  is  to 
say, if the line of philosophy, having joined the line of religion, has been obedient and of 
service to it, the world of humanity has experienced a brilliant happiness and social life. 
Whereas, when they have become separated, goodness and light have been drawn to the 
side of the line of prophethood and religion, and evil and misguidance to the side of the 
line of philosophy. Now let us find the origin and foundations of those two lines.  

The  line of philosophy that does not obey the  line of religion, taking the  form of a 
tree of Zaqqum, scatters the darkness of ascribing partners to God and misguidance on all 
sides.  In  the  branch  of  the  power  of  intellect,  even,  it  produces  the  fruit  of  atheism, 
Materialism,  and  Naturalism  for  the  consumption  of  the  human  intellect.  And  in  the 
realm of the power of passion, it pours the tyrannies of Nimrod, Pharaoh, and Shaddad on 
mankind.12 And  in the realm of the power of animal appetites,  it nurtures and bears the 
fruit of goddesses, idols, and those who claim divinity.  

The origin of the tree of Zaqqum together with that of the line of prophethood, which 
is like the Tuba-tree of worship, are in the two faces of the ‘I’. The blessed branches of 
the  line of prophethood in the garden of the globe of the earth are the  following:  in the 
branch of the power of intellect, it has nurtured the fruits of the prophets, the messengers, 
and the saints. In the branch of the power of repulsion, it has resulted in angelic kings and 
just rulers. And in the branch of the power of attraction, it has resulted in people of good 
character  and  modest  and  beautiful  manner,  both  generous  and  gracious.  So the  line  of 
prophethood has shown how mankind is the most perfect fruit of  

                                                

12 It was the swamp of Naturalist philosophy that gave birth to idols and established goddesses in the 

heads of the ancient Greeks, that nourished and nurtured Nimrods and Pharaohs. It was again that same 
Naturalist philosophy that produced the philosophies of ancient Egypt and Babylon, which either reached 
the degree of magic or, since they were represented by the elite, were considered to be magic by the people 
generally. Most certainly, if man does not perceive the light of God Almighty because of the veil of Nature, 
he will attribute divinity to everything and will thus cause himself nothing but trouble. 

 

562 

the  universe.  We  shall  explain  the  two  faces  of  the  ‘I’  as  the  root  and  pivot  and  as  a 
principal seed of those two trees. That is to say, prophethood takes hold of one face of the 
‘I’, and philosophy takes hold of the other, causing them to diverge. 

The First Face, which is the face of prophethood:  It is the origin of sheer worship. 
That is to say, the ‘I’ knows  itself to be a bondsman. It realizes that  it serves one other 
than  itself.  Its  essence  has  only  an  indicative  meaning.  That  is,  it  understands  that  it 
carries  the  meaning  of  another.  Its  existence  is  dependent;  that  is,  it  believes  that  its 
existence is due only to the existence of another, and that the continuance of its existence 
is due solely to the creativity of that other. Its ownership is illusory; that is, it knows that 
with the permission of its owner it has an apparent and temporary ownership. Its reality is 
shadow-like; that is, a contingent and insignificant shadow that displays the manifestation 
of  a  true  and  necessary  reality.  As  to  its  function,  being  a  measure  and  balance  for  the 
attributes and functions of its Creator, it is conscious service. 

It is  in this  way that the prophets, and the pure ones and saints who were  from the 
line of the prophets, regarded the ‘I’, they saw it in this regard, and understood the truth. 
They handed over the sovereignty to the Lord of All Sovereignty and concluded that that 
Lord  of  All  Glory  has  no  partner  or  like,  neither  in  His  sovereignty,  nor  in  His 
dominicality,  nor  in His Divinity. He  has  no need of assistant or deputy. The key to all 
things  is  in  His  hand.  He  has  absolute  power  over  all  things.  They  also  concluded  that 
causes are but an apparent veil; nature is the set of rules of His creation, a collection of 
His laws, and the way in which He demonstrates His power. 

Thus, this shining, luminous, beautiful face is like a living and meaningful seed out 
of which the Glorious Creator has created a Tuba-tree of worship, the blessed branches of 
which have adorned with luminous fruits all parts of the world of humanity. By scattering 
the  darkness  of  all  the  past,  it  shows  that  that  long  past  time  is  not  a  place  of  non-
existence and a vast graveyard as philosophy would have it, but is a radiant garden and a 
place  of  light  for  the  luminous  souls  who  have  departed  this  world,  who  have  cast  off 
their heavy  loads and remain  free. It is a  luminous,  many-runged ascent and an orbit of 
lights for passing souls in order that they may jump to the future and eternal felicity. 

As for the second face, it is represented by philosophy.  And as for philosophy, it 
regards the ‘I’ as carrying no meaning other than its own. That is to say, it declares that 
the  ‘I’  points  only  to  itself,  that  its  meaning  is  in  itself.  It  considers  that  the  ‘I’  works 
purely  on  its  own  account.  It  regards  its  existence  as  necessary  and  essential,  that  is,  it 
says that it exists in itself and of itself. It falsely assumes that the ‘I’ owns its own life and 
is the real mas 

 

563 

ter in  its sphere of disposal. It supposes  it to be  a constant reality.  And  it considers the 
‘I’s’  duty  to  be  perfection  of  self,  which  originates  from  love  of  self,  and  likewise, 
philosophies have constructed their modes of thought on many such corrupt foundations. 
We  have  given  definite  proof  in  our  other  treatises,  especially  in  the  Words,  and  more 
particularly  in  the  Twelfth  and  Twenty-Fifth  Words,  of  how  baseless  and  rotten  these 
foundations are. 

Even  men  like  Plato  and  Aristotle,  Ibn-i  Sina  and  Farabi,  who  were  the  most 
illustrious representatives and authorities of the line of philosophy, said that the ultimate 
aim of humanity is to liken themselves to the Necessary Being, that is to say, to actually 
resemble  Him.  They  thus  delivered  judgement  in  the  manner  of  Pharaoh,  and,  by 
whipping up ‘I-ness’ and allowing polytheism to run free in the valleys, opened the way 
to  numerous  different  ways  of  associating  partners  with  God,  like  worship  of  causes, 
idols,  nature,  and  the  stars.  They  closed  the  doors  of  impotence  and  weakness,  poverty 
and  need,  deficiency  and  imperfection,  which  are  intrinsic  to  human  beings,  thus 
obstructing  the  road  to  worship.  Being  immersed  in  Naturalism  and  being  completely 
incapable of emerging from associating partners with God, they were unable to find the 
broad gate of thanks. 

On  the  other  hand,  the  line  of  prophethood  considered,  in  the  manner  of  a 
worshipper, that the aim of humanity and duty of human beings is to be moulded by God-
given  ethics  and  good  character,  and,  by  knowing  their  impotence  to  seek  refuge  with 
Divine  power,  by  seeing  their  weakness  to  rely  on  Divine  strength,  by  realizing  their 
poverty  to  trust  in  Divine  mercy,  by  perceiving  their  need  to  seek  help  from  Divine 
riches,  by  seeing  their  faults  to  ask  for  pardon  through  Divine  forgiveness,  and  by 
realizing their deficiency to be glorifiers of Divine perfection. 

So, it is because the philosophy which does not obey the line of religion thus lost its 
way, that the ‘I’ took the reins into its own hands and ran into all sorts of misguidance. 
And out of the ‘I’ that was in this position, a tree of Zaqqum sprang forth and engulfed 
more than half of mankind. 

Thus,  in  the  branch  of  power  of  animal  appetites  of  that  tree,  the  fruits  it  has 
presented  to  mankind  are  idols  and  goddesses.  Because,  according  to  the  principles  of 
philosophy, power is approved. “Might is right” is the norm, even. It says, “All power to 
the strongest.” “The winner takes all,” and, “In power there is right.”13 It has given moral 
support to tyranny, encouraged despots, and urged oppressors to claim divinity. 

Also, by appropriating the beauty in works of art and the fineness in the decoration 
and  attributing  them  to  the  works  of  art  themselves  and  their  decoration,  and  by  not 
relating them to the manifestation of the sacred and sheer  

                                                

and ensures justice. 

13 The principle of prophethood says: “Power is in right; right is not in power.” It thus halts tyranny 

 

564 

beauty  of  the  Maker  and  Fashioner,  it  says:  “How  beautiful  it  is,”  instead  of,  “How 
beautifully  made  it  is,”  thus  regarding  each  as  an  idol  worthy  of  worship.  Moreover, 
because  it  admires  a  fraudulent,  boasting,  ostentatious,  hypocritical  beauty  that  may  be 
sold  to  anyone,  it  has  acclaimed  the  hypocrites,  and  has  made  idol-like  people 
monuments  for  its own worshippers.14 In the  branch of power of passion of that tree, it 
has nurtured the fruits of greater and lesser Nimrods, Pharaohs, and Shaddads ruling over 
unfortunate  mankind.  In  the  branch  of  power  of  intellect,  it  has  produced  fruits  like 
atheism,  Materialism,  and  Naturalism  in  the  mind  of  humanity,  and  has  thrown  it  into 
confusion. 

Now, in order to illuminate this truth, we shall compare the results which are born of 
the sound  foundations of the  line of prophethood with those originating  from the rotten 
foundations of the way of philosophy, and shall mention three or four examples. 

First Example:  According to the rule of: Be moulded by God-given ethics, which is 
one  of  the  principles  of  the  line  of  prophethood  concerning  individual  life,  there  is  the 
instruction: “Be distinguished by God-given morals and turn towards God Almighty with 
humility recognizing your impotence, poverty, and defectiveness, and so be a slave in His 
presence.” Whereas, the self-seeking rule of philosophy,  “Try to imitate the Necessarily 
Existent One” is mankind’s aim for perfection. No, indeed, the essence of humanity has 
been kneaded with infinite impotence, weakness, poverty, and need, while the essence of 
the  Necessarily  Existent  One  is  infinitely  omnipotent,  powerful,  self-sufficient,  and 
without need. 

Second Example: Among the principles of the line of prophethood concerning social 
life  are  those  of  mutual  assistance,  magnanimity,  and  generosity.  These  have  been 
harnessed for the help and assistance of all things from the sun and moon down to even 
plants.  For  the  assistance  of  animals,  for  example,  and  the  help  of  animals  for  human 
beings, and even that of particles of food for the cells of the body. Whereas, among the 
principles  of  the  line  of  philosophy  concerning  social  life  is  that  of  conflict,  which 
springs from the misuse of their inborn dispositions by a number of tyrants, brutish men, 
and savage beasts. Indeed, they have accepted this principle at so fundamental a level and 
at such a general one that they have idiotically declared: “Life is a conflict.” 

Third  Example:    One  of  the  valuable  results  and  exalted  principles  of  the  line  of 
prophethood concerning Divine unity is: “If a thing has unity, it must proceed from only 
one.”  That  is,  “Since  each  thing  in  itself  and  all  things  collectively  have  unity,  they 
therefore must be the creation of one single being.”  

                                                

14 That is to say, in order to appear desirable to their worshippers and to gain their attention, those idol-

like people display, through hypocritical ostentation, a sort of worshipful attitude. 

 

565 

Whereas, one of the beliefs of ancient philosophy is: “From one, one proceeds.” That is, 
“From one person, only one single thing can proceed. Everything else proceeds from him 
by means of intermediaries.” 

This  misleading  principle  of  philosophy,  which  is  stained  by  associating  partners 
with God, presents the Absolutely Self-Sufficient and Omnipotent One as being in need 
of impotent intermediaries, and gives all causes and intermediaries a sort of partnership in 
His dominicality. It attributes to the Glorious Creator the title of ‘Prime Mover’, which in 
fact  indicates  the  status  of  creature.  Moreover,  it  allots  the  rest  of  His  sovereignty  to 
causes  and  intermediaries,  thus  opening  the  way  to  associating  partners  with  Him  in  a 
most  comprehensive  manner.  If  the  Illuminists  (Ishraqiyyun),  who  were  pre-eminent 
philosophers, uttered nonsense like this, you can imagine how much more absurd will be 
what inferior philosophers, like the Materialists and Naturalists, say. 

Fourth Example:  According to the meaning of, 

There is nothing but extols His limitless glory and praise,15 

which  is  one  of  the  wise  principles  of  prophethood,  “If  the  purpose  and  wisdom  of 
everything,  in  particular  every  living  being,  has  one  aspect  which  looks  to  the  being 
itself, then the purposes which concern its Maker and the instances of wisdom which look 
to  its  Creator  must  be  myriad.  Each  thing,  a  single  fruit,  for  example,  has  as  much 
wisdom  and  as  many  purposes  as  all  the  fruits  of  a  tree.”  This  principle,  which  is  pure 
truth,  results  from  the  joining  of  one  of  the  forms  of  philosophy  with  the  line  of 
prophethood.  

Whereas,  the  nonsensical  principles  of  a  deceiving  philosophy  that  has  not  joined 
this  line  says:  “The  purpose  of  every  living  being  looks  to  itself  or  is  connected  with 
benefits for mankind,” thus considering in it an extremely senseless futility and attaching 
a  purpose,  a  tiny  fruit,  to  a  tree  as  huge  as  a  mountain.  Because  this  truth  has  been 
explained to some extent in the Tenth Truth of the Tenth Word and some parts have been 
mentioned  in  the  treatise  called  Lemeat  (Gleams),  we  have  cut  it  short  here.  However, 
you can extend these four examples to thousands. 

It  is  because  of  these  rotten  foundations  and  disastrous  results  of  philosophy  that 
geniuses from among the Muslim philosophers like Ibn-i Sina and Farabi were charmed 
by its apparent glitter and were deceived into taking this way, and thus attained only the 
rank of an ordinary  believer. Hujjat al-Islam al-Ghazzali did  not accord them that rank, 
even. 

Also, the foremost of the Mu’tazilites, who were among the most learned scholars of 
Islamic theology, being fascinated by the apparent glamour of the way of philosophy and 
being closely involved with it, assumed intellect to be  

                                                

15 Qur’an, 17:44.

self-sufficient.  Because  of  this  they  could  attain  only  the  rank  of  deviating,  novice 
believers. Moreover, because those famous literary figures of Islam, like Abu al-’Ala al-
Ma’arri,  who  was  renowned  for  his  pessimism,  and  ‘Umar  Khayyam,  who  was 
characterized  by  his pitiful weeping, took pleasure at the  line of philosophy’s caressing 
their evil-commanding souls, they received contemptuous and condemnatory rebuffs and 
restraining and chastening slaps from the people of truth and perfection, who said: “You 
are being insolent, you are approaching heresy, and you are disseminating heresy.” 

A  further  result  of  the  rotten  foundations  of  the  line  of  philosophy  is  that  although 
the ‘I’ has, in itself, an essence as insubstantial as air, because the inauspicious attitude of 
philosophy  regards  it  as  relating  only  to  itself,  it  is  as  if  that  vapour-like  ‘I’  becomes 
liquid; and then, because of its familiarity and preoccupation with materialism, it hardens. 
Next,  through  neglect  and  denial,  that  ‘I-ness’  freezes.  Then,  through  rebelliousness  it 
becomes opaque, losing its transparency. Then, it gradually becomes denser and envelops 
its owner. It becomes distended with the thoughts of mankind. Next, supposing the rest of 
humanity, and even causes, to be like itself, although they do not accept this and disclaim 
it,  it  gives  to  each  of  them  the  status  of  a  Pharaoh.  Then  at  this  point  it  takes  up  its 
position contesting the commands of the Glorious Creator, it says: 
Who could give life to bones that have crumbled to dust?16 

and,  as  a  challenge,  accuses  the  Absolutely  Omnipotent  One  of  impotence.  It  even 
debases the attributes of the Glorious Creator. It either rejects or denies or distorts what 
does not suit its interests and does not please its Pharaoh-like evil-commanding soul.  

One  group  of  philosophers,  by  calling  Almighty  God  ‘Self-Necessitating’,  denied 
Him choice. They rejected the endless testimony of all creation, which proves that He has 
choice.  Glory  be  to  God!  Although  all  the  beings  in  the  universe  from  the  smallest 
particles  to  the  sun  show  that  the  Creator  has  choice,  each  with  its  own  appointed 
individuality,  order,  wisdom,  and  measure,  this  blind  philosophy  refused  to  see  it. 
Moreover, another group of philosophers said: “Divine knowledge is not concerned with 
insignificant matters,” and denied its awesome comprehensiveness, and thus rejected the 
veracious witnessing of all beings. 

Furthermore, by attributing effects to causes, philosophy has given nature the power 
to  create.  As  has  been  definitely  proved  in  the  Twenty-Second  Word,  since  philosophy 
does not see the evident stamp on everything as signifying the Creator of All Things, and 
assumes  nature  to  be  the  originator,  which  is  impotent,  inanimate,  unconscious,  and 
blind, and whose apparent power is in the hands of chance and force which are also blind, 
it attributes to  

                                                

16 Qur’an, 36:78. 

 

567 

nature certain beings, each of which expresses thousands of instances of exalted wisdom 
and is like a missive from the Eternally Besought One. 

In addition, the philosophers did not find the door to resurrection and the hereafter, 
which,  as  is  proved  in  the  Tenth  Word,  God  Almighty  with  all  of  His  Names,  and  the 
universe with all of its truths, and the line of prophethood with all of its verifications, and 
the  revealed  books  with  all  of  their  verses  demonstrate.  They  therefore  denied  the 
resurrection and ascribed pre-eternity to souls. You can deduce  from these superstitions 
what their views on other matters would be. Indeed, the powers of evil have raised up the 
minds of atheistic philosophers as though with the beaks and talons of their ‘I’s and have 
dropped them  in the  valleys of  misguidance. Thus, IN THE MICROCOSM, THE  ‘I’ IS 
THE IDOL, LIKE THOSE IN THE MACROCOSM SUCH AS NATURE. 

Hence,  he  who  rejects  idols  and  believes  in  God  has  indeed  taken  hold  of  a 
support most unfailing, which shall never give way: for God is All-Hearing, All-
Knowing.17 

It is appropriate to mention here the meaning of a fictitious event that I described in 
semi-verse in Lemeat as an imaginary journey, which will illuminate the aforementioned 
truth. 

Eight  years  before  writing  this  treatise,  in  Istanbul  during  the  month  of  Ramadan, 
when  the  Old  Said,  who  was  concerned  with  the  study  of  philosophy,  was  about to  be 
transformed into the New Said, while pondering over the three ways that are indicated at 
the end of Sura al-Fatiha, 

The  way  of  those  upon  whom  You  have  bestowed  Your  grace,  not  those  who 
have received Your wrath, nor those who go astray,18 

I saw something resembling a dream or vision, an imaginary event, which was as follows. 
I saw myself in a vast desert. A layer of murky, dispiriting, and suffocating cloud had 
covered the whole face of the earth. There was neither breeze, nor light, nor water, none 
of these was to be found. I imagined that everywhere was full of monsters, dangerous and 
dreadful  creatures.  It  occurred  to  me  that  through  on  the  other  side  of  this  land  there 
should  be  light,  breeze,  and  water.  It  was  necessary  to  get  there.  I  realized  that  I  was 
being driven on involuntarily. Under the earth I wormed my way into a tunnel-like cave 
and gradually travelled through the earth. I saw that  many people had passed along this 
subterranean way before me, on all sides they were submerged. I saw their footprints, and 
once I heard some of their voices, then later they ceased. 

                                                

17 Qur’an, 2:256. 
18 Qur’an, 1:7. 

 

568 

O my friend who is accompanying me on my imaginary journey! That land is nature 
and the philosophy of Naturalism.  And the tunnel is the way that the philosophers have 
opened up with their thought in order to reach the truth. The footprints I saw were those 
of famous philosophers like Plato and Aristotle,19 and the voices I heard those of geniuses 
like Ibn Sina and Farabi. Indeed, I saw in various books some of the things Ibn Sina had 
said and some of his principles, but he had become stuck, he could go no further, he was 
submerged  before  reaching  the  truth.  Anyhow,  in  order  to  save  you  from  anxiety,  I 
showed you a small part of truth. Now I return to my journey. 

Gradually  I  realized  that  I  had  been  given  two  things  to  use.  One  was  a  torch;  it 
would scatter the darkness of that subterranean nature. The other was a device which, by 
smashing mighty boulders and huge rocks, would open up a way for me. I was told: “This 
torch and device have been given to you from the treasury of the Qur’an.” So I carried on 
for  a  long  time  in  this  way.  Then  suddenly  I  realized  that  I  had  come  out on  the  other 
side.  I  saw  a  world  where  everywhere  there  was  rejoicing,  bright  sunshine  in  a  most 
beautiful  springtime  and  an  invigorating  breeze  and  delicious  life-giving  water.  I  said: 
“All praise be to God!” 

Then  I  realized  that I  did  not own  myself,  someone  was  testing  me.  As  in  the  first 
part of the  journey, I  found  myself  in that vast desert under the suffocating cloud. And, 
though now on another way, still someone was driving me on. This time it was not under 
the  earth;  I  was  making  this  long  journey  on  the  face  of  the  earth  in  order to  reach  the 
other side. I saw things in this part of my journey so strange and curious they cannot be 
described:  the  sea  was  raging,  storms  threatened  me,  everything  caused  difficulties  for 
me. But once again, with the means of travel that had been given to me from the Qur’an, 
I overcame them and passed on. On the way I saw that there were corpses of travellers 
everywhere. Those who had completed the journey were one in a thousand. At any rate, 
having been saved from the cloud I had reached the other side of the earth and had come 
out in full view of the dazzling sun. Breathing in the invigorating breeze, I declared: “All 
praise be to God!” 

I started  looking round that  heaven-like world. Then I saw that there was someone 

who would not let me stay there. In an instant he took me to that  

                                                

19 If you say: “Who do think you are to challenge these famous philosophers? You are like a mere fly 

and yet you meddle in the flight of eagles,” I would reply: “While having a pre-eternal teacher like the 
Qur’an, in matters concerning truth and the knowledge of God, I do not have to attach as much value as 
that of a fly’s wing to those eagles, who are the students of misguided philosophy and deluded intellect. 
However inferior I am to them, their teacher is a thousand times more inferior than mine. With the help of 
my teacher, whatever caused them to become submerged did not so much as dampen my toes. An 
insignificant private who acts in accordance with the laws and commands of a great king is able to achieve 
more than a great field marshal of an insignificant king...” 

 

569 

vast desert as though to show me another way. There I saw different sorts of things, some 
like aeroplanes, some like cars, some like hoists, which had descended exactly like lifts. 
Whoever, according to his power and capacity, jumped onto them, was taken up. I, too, 
jumped onto one of them, and in a trice it took me up above the cloud. I came out among 
the most beautiful green and spectacular mountain-tops. The layer of cloud came no more 
than  half-way  up  the  mountains.  Everywhere  was  the  gentlest  of  breezes,  the  most 
delicious  water,  and  the  softest  of  lights.  I  saw  that  on  all  sides  were  these  lift-like 
allegorical vehicles. Even though I had seen them in the first two parts of my journey and 
on the other face of the earth, I had not understood what they were. Now I realized that 
they were manifestations of verses of the All-Wise Qur’an. 

Thus, the first way, which is indicated by, Nor those who go astray, is that of those 
who  are  submerged  in  nature  and  those  who  are  followers  of  the  philosophy  of 
Naturalism. You have seen in this first way how many difficulties there are in passing to 
the  truth  and  the  light.  The  second  way,  which  is  indicated  by,  Nor  those  who  have 
received Your wrath, is that of those who worship causes and those who give the power 
to create and the effect to intermediaries, like the Peripatetic philosophers. These tried to 
open  the  way  to  the  ultimate  truth  and  knowledge  of  the  Necessarily  Existent  One  by 
means  of  the  intellect  and  reason  alone.  As  for  the  third  way,  which  is  indicated  by, 
Those  upon  whom  You  have  bestowed  Your  grace,  it  is  the  luminous  highway  of  the 
people of the Qur’an, who are the people of the straight path. This luminous highway is a 
brilliant  way  revealed  and  bestowed  by  the  Most  Merciful  One.  It  is  the  shortest,  the 
easiest, the safest way, and it is open to everyone.

Second Aim 

 [The  Second  Aim  points  out  a  single  gem  from  the  treasure  of  the  following 
verse, and concerns the transformation of minute particles.] 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
And  yet,  the  unbelievers  assert,  “Never  will  the  Hour  come  upon  us!”  Say, 
“Nay! But most  surely, by my Sustainer, it  will come upon you  – by Him  Who 
knows  the  Unseen,  –  from  Whom  is  not  hidden  the  least  little  atom  in  the 
heavens or on the earth, nor is there anything less than that, or greater, but it is 
in the Clear Book.20 

 [This Second Aim points out a mere atom’s weight from the great treasure of 
this  verse;  that  is,  some  jewels  from  the  caskets  that  are  particles,  and  it 
discusses  to  some  small  degree  their  motion  and  duty.  It  consists  of  an 
Introduction and three Points.] 

Introduction 

The  transformation  of  particles  are  the  vibrations  and  wanderings  that  occur  while 
the signs of creation are being written in the book of the universe by the pen of power of 
the Pre-Eternal Inscriber. They are not games of chance and jumbled meaningless motion 
like the Materialists and Naturalists fancy. For like all beings, every particle says “In the 
Name  of  God”  at  the  start  of  its  motion,  and  it  raises  loads  infinitely  exceeding  its 
strength. For example, a seed the size of a grain of wheat shoulders a load the size of a 
huge  pine-tree.  And  on  completion  of  its  duty,  it  says  “All  praise  be  to  God.”  For  by 
exhibiting an art that is beautiful and full of purpose and a decoration that is fine and full 
of benefits which astound all minds, it displays a work of art like an ode in praise of the 
Glorious Maker. Look carefully at pomegranates and ears of corn, for example. 

                                                

20 Qur’an, 34:3. 

 

571 

Indeed, the transformations of particles are the motion and meaningful vibrations that 
proceed according to the dictation and principles of the ‘Clear Record,’ which is a title of 
Divine  knowledge  and  command  and  is  the  arrangement  of  the  past  origin  and  future 
progeny  of  everything  in  the  World  of  the  Unseen.  They  proceed  by  means  of 
transcription  from  the  ‘Clear  Book,’  which  is  a  title  for  Divine  power  and  will  and  is 
formed of present time and the Manifest World and consists of the  free disposal of that 
power  and  will  in  the  creation  of  things.  Thus,  this  motion  and  meaningful  vibration 
proceed from the writing and drawing of the words of power in the ‘Tablet of Effacement 
and Reaffirmation,’ which is a metaphorical page, and the reality of the stream of time.21 
                                                

21 This footnote is an explanation of the long sentence [here, a paragraph] defining the transformations 

of minute particles, which is the subject of the Second Aim. 

The Clear Record and the Clear Book are repeated in several places in the All-Wise Qur’an. One group 
of commentators on the Qur’an maintained that they are the same, while others stated that they are different 
from one another. Their explanations as to their true meanings were diverse, but in short they agreed that 
they are both titles to describe Divine knowledge. However, through the effulgence of the Qur’an, I came 
to the conclusion that the Clear Record, which looks more to the World of the Unseen than to the Manifest 
World, was a title for one aspect of God’s knowledge and His command. That is to say, it looks more to the 
past and future than to present time. It looks more to the origin and progeny and to the roots and seeds of 
everything, rather than to them in their visible existence. It is a notebook for Divine Determining. The 
existence of this notebook has been proved in the Twenty-Sixth Word and also in the footnote of the Tenth 
Word. 

Yes, this Clear Record is a sort of title for the knowledge and commands of God. That is to say, the 
origins, sources and roots from which things are brought into existence with perfect order and art show that 
they must be arranged in accordance with a notebook of the principles of Divine knowledge. And because 
the results, progeny, and seeds of things contain the indexes and programmes of beings which will come 
into existence subsequently, they indicate that they must be a small register of Divine commands. 

For example, a seed may be seen as the programme and index that will give form to the structure of the 

whole tree, and, furthermore, as the tiny embodiment of the commands that cause the tree to come into 
existence and determine its programmes and indexes. In short, the Clear Record is like an index and 
programme of the tree of creation, which spreads its branches through every part of the past and the future, 
and of the World of the Unseen. In this sense, the Clear Record is a notebook and register of the principles 
of Divine Determining. Through the dictation and requirement of those principles, particles are employed 
in their duties and motion in things, as those things come into existence. 

As for the Clear Book, it looks more to the Manifest World than to the World of the Unseen. That is to 
say, it looks more to present time than to the past and the future. It is a title, a notebook, a book of the will 
and power of God, rather than of His knowledge and commands. If the Clear Record is the notebook for 
Divine Determining, the Clear Book is the notebook for Divine power. That is to say, the fact that 
everything in its existence, essence, attributes and functions displays perfect art and order proves that it has 
been given existence through the laws of an effective will and the principles of a flawless power. And, as 
well as its specified and individual form, everything has been given an appointed measure and particular 
shape. Therefore, the power and will have a universal and comprehensive register of laws, a great ledger, 
according to which the particular form and substance of everything is cut out, sewn and clothed. (Overleaf)   
(21 cont.) The existence of this ledger, like the Clear Record, has been proved among the questions of 

Divine Determining and man’s will in the Twenty-Sixth Word. 

Just look at the stupidity of the people of neglect, misguidance and philosophy, they have perceived 
that ‘Preserved Tablet’ of creative power, and the manifestation, reflection, and demonstration in things of 
that perspicaciously written book of dominical wisdom and will, and yet, God forbid, by naming it ‘nature,’ 
they have made it completely meaningless. Whereas, by means of the dictation of the Clear Record, that is, 
through the decree and instruction of Divine Determining, Divine Power is creating the chain of beings, 
each link of which is a sign in the creation of things. It is causing the motion of particles, it is writing on the 
metaphorical page of time, which is called the Tablet of Effacement and Reaffirmation.  

Thus, the motion of particles is the vibration and motion from that writing and transcription, which 

occurs while beings pass from the World of the Unseen to the Manifest World, as they pass from 

 

572 

FIRST POINT 

The First Point discusses two Matters. 
FIRST MATTER:  In every facet of the motion of all particles the light of Divine 
unity  shines  like  the  sun.  For  as  is  proved  briefly  in  the  First  Indication  of  the  Tenth 
Word and in detail in the Twenty-Second Word, if every particle is not an official of God 
acting  with  His  permission  and  under  His  authority,  and  if  it  is  not  undergoing  change 
within His knowledge and power, then every particle  must have  infinite knowledge and 
limitless power; it must have eyes that see everything, a face that looks to all things, and 
authority over all things. For every particle of the elements acts, or can act, in an orderly 
fashion  in  all  animate  beings.  But the  order  within  things  and  laws  according  to  which 
they  are  formed  differ  from  one  thing  to  the  next.  If  their  order  was  not  known  to  the 
particles, the particles could not act, or even if they could act, they could not act without 
error. In which case, the particles which are performing their duties  in  beings are either 
acting with the permission and at the command, and within the knowledge and at the will, 
of the owner of  an all-encompassing knowledge, or they themselves  must have such an 
all-encompassing knowledge and power. 

Yes,  all  particles  of  air  can  enter  the  bodies  of  all  animate  beings,  the  fruits  of  all 
flowers, and the structures of all leaves. They can act within them, although the way the 
beings are formed is all different and their order and systems quite distinct. As though the 
factory  of  a  fig  were  a  loom  for  weaving  cloth  and  the  factory  of  a  pomegranate,  a 
machine for producing sugar, and so on; the programmes of their structures and bodies all 
differ from each  

                                                                                                                                            
knowledge to power. And as for the Tablet of Effacement of Reaffirmation, it is a slate for writing and 
erasing, an ever-changing notebook of the Supreme Preserved Tablet, which is fixed and constant. It is its 
notebook in the sphere of contingency, where all things are unceasing manifestations of life and death, 
existence and ephemerality. And this is the reality of time. Indeed, what we call time, which is a mighty 
river flowing in creation, has a reality like everything else. Its reality is like the ink and the page of the 
writing of Power in the Tablet of Effacement and Reaffirmation. 

None knows the Unseen, save God. 
 

 

573 

other. A particle of air, then, enters or can enter all of them. It takes up its position and 
acts  in  a  wise  and  masterly  fashion  without  error.  And  on  completion  of  its  duty  it 
departs. A  mobile particle of  mobile  air, therefore, either  must know the  forms, shapes, 
measures, and formations with which plants and animals, and even fruits and flowers, are 
clothed, or else it must be an official acting under the command and will of one who does 
know. 

Similarly with a  stationary particle of stationary  earth: since  it  has the ability to be 
the  means  and  place  of  cultivation  for  all  the  seeds  of  all  flowering  plants  and  fruit-
bearing trees, either there must be in the particle itself or in the handful of soil that is its 
little house immaterial machinery and factories in good working order to the number of 
the varieties of the trees and plants, and  flowers and  fruits  –in  fact, it  is  in every single 
particle that there  must  be  a  factory peculiar to  it and all the equipment and  machinery 
necessary  for  the  running  of  the  factory–  or  else  it  must  have  a  miraculous  knowledge 
that  knows  all  things  about  all  things  and  a  miracle-working  power  that  creates 
everything  from  nothing;  or,  those  duties  are  performed  at  the  command  and  with  the 
permission of One Who is Knowing of All Things, and through the power and might of 
One Who is Absolutely Powerful over All Things. 

If  an  untrained  and  inexperienced,  common,  ordinary,  and  blind  man  was  to  go  to 
Europe  and  in  all  the  factories  there  to  work  at  all  the  trades  and  crafts  in  perfect  and 
masterly fashion, and if he was to display a wise and artistic skill to such a degree that it 
left  everyone  speechless  with  amazement,  anyone  with  a  grain  of  consciousness  would 
know that the man was not acting on his own initiative, but that a master of all trades was 
teaching him and causing him to work. 

And if there was a blind and impotent man who lived in a simple little house and was 
unable even to rise from his place, and if small fragments of stone, and bits and pieces of 
material like bone and cotton were to enter his little house and then sacks of sugar, bales 
of cloth, crates of jewelry, finely-made clothes encrusted with jewels, and delicious foods 
were  to  emerge,  would  anyone  with  a  grain  of  intelligence  not  say:  “That  man  is  a 
wretched doorkeeper or merely a latch on the door of the factory of a wondrous miracle-
working being, which is the source of his miracles”? 

In exactly the same way, the motion and duties of particles of air in plants and trees, 
and blossom and fruit, all of which are missives of the Eternally Besought One, antique 
dominical  works  of  art,  miracles  of  power,  and  wonders  of  wisdom,  indicate  that  the 
particles  are  acting  under  the  command  and  at  the  will  of  an  All-Wise  and  Glorious 
Maker, an All-Generous and Beauteous Creator. 

Particles of earth, also, since they are the source and means for the shoots  

 

574 

and  plants  produced  by  seeds,  each  of  which  is  a  different  factory  and  workbench,  a 
different  printing-press,  treasury,  and  antique,  a  different  manifesto  proclaiming  the 
Glorious Maker’s Names  and ode hymning His perfections,  it  is as definite as two plus 
two  equalling  four  that  the  particles  of  earth  are  acting  at  the  command,  with  the 
permission, and through the will and power of an All-Glorious Maker Who is Lord of the 
command of “Be!” and it is,22 and to Whose command everything is subjugated. In this 
we believe. 

SECOND MATTER:  The Second Matter indicates briefly the duties and instances 

of wisdom in the motion of particles. 

The  Materialists,  whose  use  of  their  reasons  is  limited  to  what  is  immediately 
apparent to them, have, in their nonsensical philosophies which are based on foundations 
of  futility,  taken  the  transformations  of  particles,  which  they  regard  as  the  results  of 
coincidence,  as  the  fundamental  basis  of  all  their  principles  and  shown  that  the  Divine 
works  and  creatures  result  from  those  transformations.  Anyone  with  a  grain  of 
intelligence  would  know  how  contrary  to  reason  is  their  attributing  creatures  adorned 
with  infinite  instances  of  wisdom  to  something  based  on  purposeless,  meaningless 
coincidence, which is quite without order. 

Whereas,  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  wisdom  of  the  All-Wise  Qur’an,  the 
transformations  of  particles  have  many  purposes  and  duties,  and  demonstrate  many 
instances  of  wisdom.  The  Qur’an  points  to  these  duties  and  instances  of  wisdom  with 
many of its verses, such as: 

And there is nothing but extols His limitless glory and praise.23  

We shall mention several of these by way of examples. 

The  First:  Renewing  and  refreshing  the  manifestations  of  His  act  of  creation,  the 
Necessarily  Existent  One  takes  all  spirits  as  models  and  in  order  to  every  year  clothe 
them  in  fresh  bodies  through  miracles  of  His  power,  and  through  His  wisdom  to 
transcribe  thousands  and  thousands  of  different  books  from  every  book,  and  to 
demonstrate  single  truths  in  constantly  differing  forms,  and  also  to  prepare  the  ground 
and make way for the beings, worlds and universes, which follow on one after the other, 
group by group, the Glorious Creator causes particles to move and employs them through 
His power. 

The Second: The Glorious Lord of All Dominion created this world, and especially 
the field of the face of the earth, in the form of a cultivated property. That is to say, He 
prepared  it  in  such  a  way  that  it  would  flourish  and  produce  ever-fresh  crops  and  He 
might sow and reap the numberless miracles of His power. Thus, by causing the motion 
of particles with wisdom and  

                                                

22 Qur’an, 36:82, etc. 
23 Qur’an, 17:44.

employing  them  in  an  orderly  fashion  in  His  field  of  the  earth,  He  displays  every  age, 
every  season,  every  month,  indeed  every  day,  and  every  hour,  endless  beings  through 
miracles  of  His  power,  each  of  which  is  a  cosmos,  and  causes  His  field  to  produce 
constantly  differing  crops.  He  demonstrates  through  the  motion  of  particles,  gifts  from 
the infinite treasury of His mercy and samples of His endless power. 

The  Third:  The  Pre-Eternal  Inscriber  caused  the  motion  of  particles  with  perfect 
wisdom  and  employed  them  with  perfect  order  so  that,  through  displaying  the 
embroideries  of  the  endless  manifestations  of  the  Divine  Names,  He  might  exhibit  the 
endless embroideries in a limited field, and set forth the manifestations of the Names, and 
He might write the infinite signs, which will point to infinite meanings, on a small page. 

Yes,  in  essence  this  year’s  crops  are  like  those  of  last  year,  but  their  meanings  are 
different.  Since  the  relative  determinations  are  changed,  their  meanings  change  and 
increase.  And  although  the  relative  determinations  and  transient  embodiments  are 
replaced  and  are  apparently  ephemeral,  their  beautiful  meanings  are  preserved  and  are 
constant and permanent. 

Since the leaves, flowers, and fruits of last spring’s tree do not have spirits, in reality 
they are the  same as those of this spring. But the relative embodiments differ.  And, the 
relative  embodiments  of  this  spring  replace  those  of  last  spring  with  different 
embodiments  in  order  to  set  forth  the  meanings  of  the  functions  of  the  Divine  Names, 
whose manifestations are being constantly renewed. 

The Fourth: The  All-Wise and Glorious One causes the  motion of particles  in the 
narrow  tillage  of  this  world,  in  the  workshop  and  field  of  the  face  of  the  earth,  thus 
making the cosmos as flowing and beings as travelling, in order to grow things like crops 
or  items  for  decoration  or  provision  suitable  for  the  most  broad  World  of  the  Inner 
Dimensions of Things, and endless other worlds of the hereafter, like the infinite World 
of Similitudes. He thus grows in this small world vast quantities of crops appropriate for 
those vast worlds. He causes an endless flood to flow through the world from the infinite 
treasury of His power and to pour into the World of the Unseen, and some of it into the 
worlds of the hereafter. 

The  Fifth:  By  causing  the  motion  of  particles  with  perfect  wisdom  through  His 
power  and  employing  them  with  perfect  order  in  order  to  display  infinite  Divine 
perfections,  endless  manifestations  of  beauty  and  glory,  and  countless  dominical 
glorifications in this narrow and limited field and finite and short time, He causes endless 
glorification  in  finite  time  and  in  a  limited  field.  He  displays  infinite  manifestations  of 
His  beauty  and  glory  and  perfection.  He  creates  many  truths  concerning  the  Unseen, 
many  fruits  for  the  hereafter,  and  a  great  many  embroideries  and  meaningful  weavings 
from  

 

576 

the  enduring  selfhood  and  forms  of  ephemeral  creatures  appropriate  for  the  World  of 
Similitudes and the Tablet. Therefore, the One Who causes the motion of particles is the 
One  Who  displays  these  grand  purposes  and  mighty  instances  of  wisdom.  If  it  were 
otherwise, there would have to be a brain as huge as the sun in every particle. 

Those  brainless  philosophers  suppose  to  be  purposeless  the  transformations  of 
particles,  which  occur  with  wisdom  not  limited  to  the  five  above  examples,  but  with 
infinite  wisdom.  They  fancy  the  particles,  which  revolve  like  Mevlevi  dervishes 
glorifying God and reciting His Names  in two ecstatic  movements, one turning on their 
own  axes,  the  other  describing  circles,  to  be  reeling  around  as  though  stunned  and 
aimless. It may be understood from this, then, that their knowledge is not knowledge, it is 
ignorance, and their philosophy, futility. 

(A sixth and lengthy example will be discussed in the Third Point.) 

SECOND POINT 

In  every  particle  there  are  two  truthful  evidences  to  the  existence  and  unity  of  the 
Necessarily Existent One. Indeed, by carrying out its important duties consciously and by 
raising mighty loads despite being powerless and lifeless, a particle bear decisive witness 
to  the  existence  of  the  Necessarily  Existent  One.  And  by  conforming  to  the  universal 
order  peculiar  to  each  place  it  enters,  and  by  settling  anywhere  as  though  it  was  its 
homeland,  it testifies to the unity of the Necessarily Existent One and to the oneness of 
that  Being  Who  is  the  Owner  of  all  things,  with  their  apparent  faces  and  their  inner 
aspects which look to Him. That is to say, whoever owns the particles must also own all 
the places it enters. 

Thus,  since  its  loads  are  extremely  heavy  and  its  duties  endless,  the  particle 
demonstrates  that  it  is  mobile  and  acting  at  the  command  of  One  Possessing  Absolute 
Power,  and  in  His  name.  And,  the  fact  that  it  conforms  as  though  knowingly  to  the 
universal  order of  the  cosmos  and  enters  each  place  without obstacle  shows  that  it  acts 
through the power and wisdom of a single Being Possessing Absolute Knowledge. 

A  private  soldier  has  relations  with  his  squad,  his  company,  his  battalion,  his 
regiment, and  his division, and so on, and  has duties  in connection with  each. Since  he 
knows  all  those  relations  and  duties,  he  will  act  in  conformity  with  them.  For,  having 
received training and instruction under military discipline, he complies with the rules and 
regulations of a single supreme commander who commands all those sections. 

In the same way, all particles are suitably placed within compounds, and with every 
facet  of  the  compounds  have  different  beneficial  relations  and  different  well-regulated 
duties that yield wise results that are all different. It  

 

577 

is therefore surely only One in the grasp of whose power is the whole universe who can 
place the particles in such a way as to preserve all their relations with and duties in all the 
facets of the compounds, and not spoil the wise results. 

For example, a particle located in Tevfik’s24 eye is suitably placed with regard to the 
blood-vessels  like  the  arteries  and  veins,  and  the  motor  and  sensory  nerves,  and  has  a 
wise  and  purposeful  relationship  with  the  face,  and  then  with  the  head,  the  trunk,  and 
with  the  entire  human  body,  and  has  beneficial  duties  in  relation  to  each.  This 
demonstrates that only one who creates all the members of the body will be able to place 
the particle in that position. 

Particles  entering  the  body  as  sustenance  in  the  caravan  of  food  in  particular  make 
their journey with astonishing order and wisdom. On their way, they pass through modes 
and stages in an orderly manner, and progressing consciously without confusion carry on 
till  they  are  strained  through  the  four  filters  in  the  bodies  of  animate  beings.  They  are 
then  loaded  onto  the  red  blood-corpuscles  in  order  to  come  to  the  assistance  of  the 
members and cells which are in need of sustenance, rendering this assistance according to 
a law of generosity. It may be clearly understood from this that the One Who drives these 
particles and causes them to pass through thousands of different states must of necessity 
be a Generous Sustainer, a Compassionate Creator, in relation to Whose power particles 
and stars are equal. 

Moreover, all particles act within embroideries of the greatest art and have relations 
with  all  the  other  particles  therein.  Since  each  is  in  a  position  of  both  dominance  and 
subjection to all the rest, both to each individually and to all of them generally, it either 
that  wonderfully  skilful  embroidery  and  wisdom-displaying 
knows  and  creates 
ornamented art, which is a thousand times impossible, or each of them is a point assigned 
to that motion, which proceeds from the law of Divine Determining and pen of power of 
the All-Wise Maker. 

For  example,  if  the  stones  of  the  dome  of  Aya  Sophia  are  not  dependent  on  the 
command and skill of its architect, all the stones must have skill in the art of building like 
that of the architect Sinan, and must be either subject to, or dominant over, the rest of the 
stones.  That  is,  they  must  have  the  power  to  say:  “Come,  we  shall  stand  shoulder  to 
shoulder in order not to fall and collapse.” 

In  the  same  way,  if  the  particles  in  creatures,  which  are  thousands  of  times  more 
skilfully fashioned, wonderful, and full of wisdom than the dome of Aya Sophia, are not 
dependent on the command of the master builder of the  

                                                

24 The first scribe of the Risale-i Nur. 

 

578 

universe, to each of them  must the ascribed as  many attributes of perfection as those of 
the universe’s Maker. 

Glory  be  to  God!  Since  the  unbelievers  do  not  accept  a  Necessarily  Existent  One, 
they  are  compelled  according  to their  beliefs  to  accept  as  many  false  gods  as  there  are 
particles. Thus, no matter how illustrious a philosopher or scholar an unbeliever may be, 
he is in profound ignorance to the utmost degree. 

THIRD POINT 

This Point is an indication to the sixth example of the mighty instances of wisdom in 

the motion of particles, which was promised at the end of the First Point. 

As was  stated in the  footnote of the answer to the Second Question  in the Twenty-
Eighth  Word,  a  further  instance  of  wisdom  of  the  thousands  contained  in  the 
transformations  of  particles  and  their  motion  in  the  bodies  of  animate  beings,  is  to 
illuminate the particles and to make them alive and meaningful in order to be fitting for 
the construction of the world of the hereafter. It is as if the bodies of animals and humans, 
and even plants, are like guest-houses, barracks, and schools for those who enter in order 
to take lessons and be trained; inanimate particles enter them and are illuminated. Simply, 
the particles receive training and instruction and acquire a fineness. By fulfilling different 
duties, they become worthy to be particles in the world of permanence and the realm of 
the hereafter, which is alive with all of its elements. 

Question: How is it known that there is this wisdom in the motion of particles? 
Answer:  Firstly: It is known through the wisdom of the Maker, which is proved by 
all  the  wise  benefits  and  purposes  and  the  order  in  all  creatures.  For  a  wisdom  that 
attaches universal wisdom to the  most particular thing would not leave without wisdom 
and purpose the motion of particles, which demonstrate the greatest activity in the flood 
of the universe and are the means for embroideries full of wisdom. Also, a wisdom and 
sovereignty which does not leave the smallest creature without a wage, recompense, and 
perfection in its duties, would not leave its most numerous officials and principal servants 
without light, without a wage. 

Secondly:  By causing the motion of the elements and employing them, the All-Wise 
Maker raises them to the degree of  minerals as though it was a wage of perfection, and 
instructs them  in the glorification peculiar to minerals.  And through causing the  motion 
of minerals and employing them, He  

 

579 

confers on them the rank of the degree of vegetable life. And by presenting vegetable life 
in the form of sustenance, He grants it, through its motion and employment, the degree of 
fineness of animal  life. And through employing the particles in animals, He raises them 
by way of being sustenance to the degree of human life. And by purifying the particles in 
a  human  body  through  repeated  filtering,  and  by  favouring  them,  He  promotes them  to 
the most delicate and subtle places, which are the brain and the heart. From all this it may 
be understood that the motion of particles is not without wisdom, but that the particles are 
made to hasten to a sort of perfection worthy of themselves.  

Thirdly: Among the particles in animate beings, some, like those in pips and seeds, 
receive such a light, fineness, and quality that they are like a spirit or a king to the rest of 
the particles, to a huge tree,  for example. Thus, since among all the particles of a  huge 
tree some rise to this rank through fulfilling their delicate duties and passing through the 
many stages in the life of the tree, it demonstrates that through the command of the All-
Wise Maker these particles receive a fineness, light, rank, and instruction on account of 
and  in  honour of the Divine Names  manifested on them  in accordance with the sorts of 
motion that are the functions of their natures, and in honour of them. 

To  Conclude:  Since25  the  All-Wise  Maker  has  specified  for  everything  a  suitable 
point  of  perfection  and  an  appropriate  level  of  the  effulgence  of  existence,  by  giving 
everything a disposition that will strive to reach that point of perfection, He drives them 
towards  it.  This  ‘Law  of  Dominicality’  is  in  force  in  all  plants  and  animals,  as  it  is  in 
inanimate  beings,  in  which  it  promotes  plain  earth  to  the  rank  of  diamonds  and  to  the 
level of priceless  jewels. Within this truth, the tip of a mighty ‘Law of Dominicality’  is 
apparent. 

And since the All-Generous Creator bestows as payment to the animals He employs 
in the  mighty  law of generation a particular pleasure as a sort of wage. And He gives a 
wage of perfection to the animals  employed  in other dominical  functions,  like  bees and 
nightingales,  for  example.  He  confers  on  them  a  level  whereat  they  feel  eagerness  and 
receive pleasure. And within this the tip of a mighty ‘Law of Generosity’ is apparent. 

And  since  the  reality  of  everything  looks  to  the  manifestation  of  one  of  God 
Almighty’s Names, and is bound to it, and is a mirror to it; whatever beauty is apparent in 
each, it is due to the Name; the Name requires it to be thus. Whether or not the thing is 
aware of it, in the view of reality the beauty is demanded. And from this truth, the tip of a 
most mighty ‘Law of Beauty and Making Beautiful’ is apparent. 

                                                

page 581. 

25 The sentence answering this ‘since’ and that at the beginning of the following six paragraphs is on 

 

580 

And since, as is necessitated by His law of generosity, when the life of a thing ends, 
the Generous Creator does not take back the rank and perfection He has bestowed on it, 
but  makes  permanent  the  fruits,  results,  and  real  meaning  and  identity  of  that  bearer  of 
perfection,  and,  if  it  has  a  spirit,  its  spirit.  For  example,  He  makes  permanent  the 
meanings  and  fruits  of  the  perfections  He  has  made  manifest  on  man  in  this  world.  He 
will  even  return to  a thankful  believer  the  embodiment of  the  thanks  and  praise  for the 
transient fruits that he has eaten in the form of a fruit of Paradise. And in this truth, the tip 
of a mighty ‘Law of Mercy’ is apparent. 

And  since  the  Peerless  Creator  wastes  nothing,  He  does  nothing  in  vain.  He  even 
utilizes in the creatures of springtime the material dŽbris of those of the previous autumn, 
who,  having  accomplished  their  duties,  have  died,  including  them  in  their  construction. 
For sure, according to the meaning of, 

On the Day the earth will be changed into another earth,26 

and the indication of, 

But, indeed, the life of the hereafter, that is the true life,27 

it is indeed a requirement of wisdom that the particles of the earth, which are inanimate 
and  unconscious  yet  perform  important  duties  in  this  world,  should  be  utilized  and 
included in some of the constructions of the hereafter, the stones, the trees, and all things 
of  which  will  most  certainly  be  animate  and  conscious.  For  to  leave  in  the  world  the 
particles  of  the  world  when  it  has  been  destroyed  or  to  cast  them  into  non-existence 
would  be  wasteful.  And  from  this  truth,  the  tip  of  truly  mighty  ‘Law  of  Wisdom’  is 
apparent. 

And since the many results, meanings, and fruits of this world, and the woven pages 
of the acts and deeds, and the spirits and bodies, of those like jinn and human beings who 
are  charged  with  the  Trust  are  sent  to  the  market  of  the  hereafter.  Certainly,  it  is  a 
requirement  of  justice  and  wisdom  that  after  receiving  their  particular  perfection  in 
accordance  with  the  performance  of  their  duties,  the  particles  of  the  earth,  which 
accompany and serve those  fruits  and  meanings,  will  be  included  in the construction of 
the hereafter. That  is, they will  be  included  in  it  together with the dŽbris of this world, 
which will be destroyed, after many times serving and receiving the light of life, and after 
being the means for the glorifications of animate creatures. And from this truth, the tip of 
a truly mighty ‘Law of Justice’ is apparent. 

And since, just as the spirit is dominant over the body, so the commands that bring 
things  into  existence,  which  are  written  by  Divine  Determining,  are  dominant  over 
inanimate  matter. Inanimate  matter is able to assume a position and an order due to the 
immaterial writing of Divine Determining.  

                                                

26 Qur’an, 14:48. 
27 Qur’an, 29:64. 

 

581 

For  example,  in  all  kinds  of  eggs  and  sperm,  and  varieties  of  seeds  and  grains,  matter 
acquires  different  ranks  and  lights  according  to  the  commands  that  bring  things  into 
existence, which are all written differently by Divine Determining. The inanimate matter 
of  seeds,  which  is  all  the  same  in  regard  to  its  substance,28  becomes  the  source  of 
innumerable  different  beings.  It  obtains  ranks  and  lights  which  are  all  different.  Most 
certainly, then, it is the requirement of an all-encompassing knowledge that if a particle 
has  been  repeatedly  in  the  service  of  life  and  of  the  dominical  glorifications  that  are  in 
life,  the  wisdom  of  those  meanings  will  be  recorded  on  the  immaterial  forehead  of  the 
particle by the pen of Divine Determining, which neglects nothing at all. And in this, the 
tip of a truly mighty ‘Law of All-Encompassing Knowledge’ is apparent. 

Since this is the case, particles are not without purpose.29 
IN  SHORT:    Beyond  the  visible  tips  of  each  of  the  seven  above-mentioned  laws, 
that  is,  the  ‘Law  of  Dominicality’,  the  ‘Law  of  Generosity’,  the  ‘Law  of  Beauty’,  the 
‘Law  of  Mercy’,  the  ‘Law  of  Wisdom’,  the  ‘Law  of  Justice’,  and  the  ‘Law  of  All-
Encompassing  Knowledge’,  and  of  a  great  many  other  vast  laws,  a  Greatest  Name  and 
the greatest manifestation of that Greatest Name is pointed to. It may be understood from 
that  manifestation  that,  like  the  rest  of  the  creatures,  the  transformations  of  particles  in 
this world are occurring with a sensitive balance measured with knowledge, according to 
the  commands  given  by  Divine  power  that  bring  things  into  existence,  on  the  limits 
drawn  by  Divine  Determining,  for  most  exalted  instances  of  wisdom.  Simply,  they  are 
being  prepared  to  go  to  another  higher  world.30  In  which  case,  the  bodies  of  animate 
beings  are  each  like  schools,  barracks,  and  guest-houses  for  the  instruction  of  those 
travelling particles. It may be stated with certainty that it is so. 

                                                

28 Indeed, the seeds are all compounds of the four elements; they are formed of matter like hydrogen, 
oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. Materially they may be considered to be the same; the difference between 
them lies only in the immaterial writing of Divine Determining. 

29 This sentence is the answer to the word ‘since’ at the beginning of the preceding seven paragraphs. 
30 For, as may be observed, the light of life is kindled and scattered most freely in this turbid and lowly 

world with an activity that is extremely extensive, and a fresh light of life is illuminated widely, even in 
insignificant material and rotten substances, and that dense and insignificant matter is refined and polished 
with the light of life. This indicates clearly that this turbid and lifeless world is being dissolved, polished 
and made beautiful through the motion of particles and the light of life for the sake of another most subtle, 
exalted, pure and living world. It is as if it is being adorned in order to go to some subtle world. If those 
people, therefore, whose minds are so straitened that they cannot squeeze into them the idea of bodily 
resurrection look with the light of the Qur’an, they will see a ‘Law of the Self-Subsistent One through 
which the universe subsists’ that is so comprehensive as to resurrect all particles as though they were an 
army. It may be clearly seen to be in force and prevailing over creation. 

 

582 

CONCLUSION 

As  is  stated  and  proved  in  the  First  Word,  all  things  say:  “In  the  Name  of  God.” 
Thus,  like all  beings, all particles and all groups and particular assemblages of particles 
say: “In the Name of God” with the tongue of disposition, and they are in motion. 

According  to  the  meaning  of  the  previous  three  Points,  at  the  beginning  of  their 
motion  all  particles  recite:  “In  the  Name  of  God,  the  Merciful,  the  Compassionate” 
through  the  tongue  of  disposition.  That  is,  “I  am  moving  in  the  name  of  God,  for  His 
sake, with His permission, and through His power.” Then, like all creatures, at the end of 
their  motion,  all  particles  and  all  groups  of  particles  declare  through  the  tongue  of 
disposition:  “All praise  be  God, Sustainer of  All  the Worlds.” Each particle thus shows 
itself  to  be  like  the  tip  of  a  tiny  pen  of  power tracing  the  embroideries  of  the  skilfully-
worked creatures, which are like odes of praise. Indeed, each of them is like the point of a 
needle  turning  on  creatures,  which  in  turn  are  like  the  records of  a  mighty,  immaterial, 
dominical gramophone with innumerable arms; they cause those creatures to recite odes 
glorifying their Sustainer and to hymn praises to God. 

They will cry out therein, “All Glory be unto You, O God!” And “Peace” will be 
their greeting therein. And their call  will close  with, “All praise is due to God, 
the Sustainer of All the Worlds!”31 

All glory be unto You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught 
us, indeed You are All-Knowing, All-Wise!32 

O our Sustainer! Let not our hearts swerve from the truth after You have guided 
us, and bestow upon us the gift of Your grace; for, indeed, You are the Giver of 
Gifts.33 

O God! Grant blessings to our master Muhammad that will be pleasing to You 
and fulfilment to his truth, and to his Family, his Companions, and his brothers, 
and  grant  them  peace.  And  protect  us  and  protect  our  religion.  Amen.  O 
Sustainer of All the Worlds!

The Thirty-First Word 

On the Ascension of the Prophet Muhammad 
(Peace and blessings be upon him) 

 [NOTE: The Ascension is a question that results from the essentials and pillars 
of belief, and follows on after them, a light that draws strength from the lights 
of the pillars of belief. For sure, the Ascension cannot be proved independently 
to irreligious atheists who do not accept the pillars of belief, because it cannot 
be discussed with those who neither know God, nor recognize the Prophet, nor 
accept  the  angels,  and  who  deny  the  existence  of  the  heavens.  Firstly  those 
pillars must be proved. Since this is the case, we shall address the discussion to 
a  believer  who,  since  he  considers  it  unlikely,  has  misgivings  about  the 
Ascension and we shall explain it to him. However, from time to time we shall 
take into account the atheist who is the position of listener and shall set forth the 
matter to him. Some flashes of the truth of the Ascension have been mentioned 
in others of the other Words. At the insistence of my brothers we seek the grace 
from  Almighty God to unite all those  different flashes with the  essence  of the 
truth, and with all of them to form a mirror to the beauty of the perfections of 
Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him).]  

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
Limitless  in  His  glory  is  He  Who  transported  His  servant  by  night  from  the 
Inviolable  House  of  Worship  to  the  Remote  House  of  Worship,  the  environs  of 
which  We  had  blessed,  so  that  We  might  show  him  some  of  Our  signs:  for, 
indeed, He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.1 

It is no less than inspiration sent down to him; * He was taught by one mighty in 
power, * Endued with wisdom: for he appeared in [stately form] * While he was 
in the horizon’s loftiest part. * Then he  

                                                

1 Qur’an, 17:1. 

 

584 

approached and came closer, * And was at a distance of but two bow-lengths or 
[even]  nearer;  *  And  thus  did  [God]  reveal  unto  His  servant  whatever  He 
revealed.  *  The  [servant’s]  heart  in  no  way  falsified  what  it  saw.  *  Will  you, 
then, dispute with him as to what he saw? * For, indeed, he saw him at a second 
descent, * Near the Lote-tree of the farthest limit, * Near it is to the Garden of 
Abode.  *  Behold,  the  Lote-tree  was  shrouded  in  mystery  unspeakable.  *  [His] 
eye  did  not  waver,  nor  yet  did  it  stray.  *  Truly  did  he  see  some  of  the  most 
profound of his Sustainer’s signs.2 

Since  it  is  related  to  our  question  here,  I  shall  expound  two  allusions  –based  on 
principles of the science of rhetoric– contained in the pronominal phrase for indeed He, 
which is part of the vast treasury of the first sublime verse mentioned above. It was also 
explained in the treatise about the Qur’an’s miraculousness. 

After mentioning the journey of God’s Most Noble Beloved (Upon whom be the best 
of  blessings  and  most  perfect  peace)  from  the  mosque  at  Mecca  to  the  mosque  in 
Jerusalem,  which  was  the  beginning  of  his  Ascension,  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  says:  He  is 
All-Hearing, All-Seeing. This phrase, together with the pronoun in the phrase, for indeed 
He, which alludes to the furthest point of the Ascension indicated to by the verses from 
Sura an-Najm, refers either to Almighty God or to the Prophet (PBUH). 

If  it  refers  to  the  Prophet  (PBUH),  the  rule  of  rhetoric  and  the  relationship  in  the 
sequence  of  the  words  states  the  following:  there  is,  within  this  particular  journey  a 
general one and a universal ascent during which the Prophet (PBUH) heard and saw the 
dominical signs and wonders of Divine art which his eyes and ears happened upon within 
the universal degrees of the Divine Names as far as the Lote-tree of the farthest limit and 
the distance of two bow-lengths. It indicates that his insignificant and particular journey 
was like the key to a journey that is both universal and an exhibition of marvels. 

If  the  pronoun  refers  to  Almighty  God,  it  is  thus:  in  order  to  invite  one  of  His 
servants on a  journey to His presence and to entrust him with a duty, after sending  him 
from the Mosque in Mecca to that in Jerusalem, which is where the prophets gather, and 
causing  him  to  meet  with  them  and  demonstrating  that  he  was  the  sole  heir  of  the 
principles of the religions of all the prophets, He took him on a journey through both the 
external face of the world of existence and the face that looks to its Creator as far as the 
Lote-tree of the farthest limit and the distance of two bow-lengths. 

Certainly, he was a servant and the journey was a particular Ascension,

but he had been accorded a Trust that was connected to the whole universe and had been 
given a light that would change the colour of the universe. Moreover, since he had with 
him  the  key  to open  the  door  leading  to  eternal  happiness,  God  Almighty  bestowed on 
him  the  attribute  of  “seeing  and  hearing  all  things”  so  that  he  might  demonstrate  the 
world-embracing  comprehensive  wisdom  of  the  Trust,  light,  and  key  –  wisdom  and 
purposes which encompassed the whole universe and embraced all creatures. 

This profound truth contains four Principles. 
The First: Why was the Ascension necessary? 
The Second: What was the reality of the Ascension? 
The Third: What was the wisdom and purpose of the Ascension? 
The Fourth: What are the fruits and benefits of the Ascension? 

First Principle 

The reason for the Ascension’s necessity 

It is said, for example, that Almighty God is closer to him than his jugular vein.3 He 
is  closer  to  everything  than  anything  else.  He  is  free  of  and  beyond  corporeality  and 
space. However, all the saints are able to converse with Him in their hearts, so why was 
the Saint, Muhammad (PBUH), successful  in  holding an  inward conversation with God 
that  any  saint  may  do  in  his  heart, only  after  and  as  a  result  of  a  long  journey  like  the 
Ascension? 

The Answer: We shall make this profound mystery easier to understand by means of 
two  comparisons.  Consider  these  two  comparisons  from  the  Twelfth  Word,  which  are 
about the mystery of the Qur’an’s miraculousness and the mystery of the Ascension. 

First  Comparison:  A  king  has  two  sorts  of  interviewing,  conversation,  and 
discussion at his disposal, and two modes of address and favour. The first is to converse 
with a common subject about a particular matter and special need by means of a private 
telephone.  The  second,  under  the  title  of  august  sovereignty,  in  the  name  of  supreme 
kingship,  with  the  dignity  of  universal  rule,  and  with  the  aim  of  publishing  and 
promulgating  his  commands,  is  to  converse  and  speak  through  an  envoy  connected  to 
those matters or by means of a high official related to those commands. It is also to speak 
through an illustrious edict that proclaims his majesty. 

Thus, And God’s is the highest similitude,4 like this comparison, the  

                                                

3 Qur’an, 50:16. 
4 Qur’an, 16:60. 

 

586 

Creator  of  the  universe,  the  Lord  of  all  things  with  their  apparent  and  inner  faces,  the 
Sovereign of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, has two modes of conversing, speaking, and 
favouring.  The  first  is  particular  and  private,  the  other  universal  and  general.  The 
Ascension, therefore, was a manifestation of the sainthood of Muhammad (PBUH) in the 
form  of  a  universality  and  exaltedness  superior  to  all  other  sainthood.  It  was  being 
honoured by God Almighty’s conversation and address through His Name of Sustainer of 
All the Universe and title of Creator of All Beings. 

Second Comparison: A man holds up the mirror he is holding to the sun. According 
to its capacity, the mirror receives light, which contains the seven colours, from the sun, 
and  a  reflection.  The  man  becomes  connected  with  the  sun  and  converses  with  it  in 
relation  to  these.  If  he  directs  the  luminous  mirror  towards  his  dark  house  or  his  tiny, 
private  garden,  which  is  covered  by  a  roof,  he  cannot  benefit  in  relation  to  the  sun’s 
value, but only in accordance with the capacity of the mirror. 

A  second  man,  however,  puts  down  the  mirror,  faces  the  sun  directly,  and  sees  its 
majesty  and  understands  its  grandeur.  Then  he  climbs  a  very  high  mountain,  sees  the 
brilliance of the sun’s broad dominion and converses with it in person and without veil. 
Then he returns and  makes  large windows  in  his  house and  in the roof over his garden, 
and opens up ways to the sun in the sky, and speaks and converses with the constant light 
of the actual sun. And he is able to speak to it gratefully as follows: 

“O amiable  sun, who  is the  beauty of the world and pet of the skies, who gilds the 
face of the earth with its light and makes it and the faces of all flowers smile! You have 
heated  and  illuminated  my  little  house  and  garden  in  the  same  way  that  you  have 
illuminated  the  whole  world  and  warmed  the  face  of  the  earth.”  The  first  man  with  the 
mirror,  however,  cannot  say  that,  for  the  sun’s  reflection  and  traces  are  limited  and 
restricted by the mirror, and are in accordance with the restriction. 

Thus,  the  manifestation  of  the  Single  and  Eternally  Besought  One,  the  Pre-Eternal 
Sun  and  Post-Eternal  Sovereign,  appears  in  the  human  essence  in  two  forms,  which 
comprise innumerable degrees. 

The  First  is  a  manifestation  through  a  dominical  relationship  which  is  extended  to 
the  mirror  of  the  heart.  Through  it,  everyone  may  receive  the  particular  and  universal 
manifestation of the Pre-Eternal Sun’s light, discourse, and conversation in relation to his 
capacity, and in the relation to the manifestation of the Divine Names and attributes in his 
traversing  the  degrees  in  his  spiritual  journeying.  The  degrees  of  sainthood,  which 
proceed under the shadow of most of the Names and attributes, arise from this sort. 

The  Second:  Since  man  possesses  comprehensiveness  and  is  the  most  enlightened 

fruit of the tree of the universe, and since he is able to display at  

 

587 

once in the mirror of his spirit all the Divine Names manifested in the universe, Almighty 
God displayed, through the manifestation of His Essence and at the greatest level of the 
Most  Beautiful  Names,  in  the  member  of  the  human  race  who  reflected  them  most 
comprehensively 
those  Names.  This  display  and 
manifestation  is  the  inner  meaning  of  the  Ascension  of  Muhammad  (PBUH),  by  which 
his sainthood became the source of his messengership. 

the  greatest  manifestation  of 

Sainthood  proceeds  through  shadow  and  resembles  the  first  man  in  the  Second 
Comparison. While in messengership there is no shadow, it looks directly to the oneness 
of the All-Glorious One and resembles the second man in the Second Comparison. As for 
the  Ascension,  since  it  was  the  greatest  wonder  of  Muhammad’s  sainthood  and  also  its 
highest degree, it was transformed into the degree of messengership. The inner face of the 
Ascension was sainthood, it went from creation to Creator. While  its apparent face was 
messengership, it came from Creator to creation. Sainthood is spiritual journeying in the 
levels  close  to  God;  it  needs  a  certain  amount  of  time  and  many  degrees  must  be 
traversed.  While  messengership,  whose  light  is  greatest,  looks  to  the  mystery  of 
uncovering Divine immediacy, for which the passing instant is sufficient. It was for this 
reason that it is said in the Hadith: “He went and returned in an instant.”5 

Now  we  say  to  the  atheist  who  is  in  the  position  of  listener:  “Since  the  universe 
resembles  a  most  orderly  country,  magnificent  city,  and  adorned  palace,  it  surely  must 
have  a  ruler,  owner,  and  builder.  And  since  there  is  such  a  magnificent,  All-Glorious 
Owner, All-Perfect Ruler, and All-Beauteous Maker; and since there was a human being 
whose  view  was  universal  and  who  demonstrated  a  relationship  with  the  entire  world, 
country,  city,  and  palace  and  was  connected  to  all  of  them  through  his  senses  and 
faculties  of  perception;  certainly,  the  Magnificent  Maker  would  have  an  elevated 
relationship to the  fullest degree with that  human being, whose  view  was universal and 
consciousness comprehensive, and would favour him with an exalted and sacred address. 
Among  those  who  manifested  this  relationship  from  the  time  of  Adam  (Peace  be 
upon  him)  up  to  now,  Muhammad  the  Arabian  (Peace  and  blessings  be  upon  him) 
demonstrated it at the very fullest degree according to the testimony of his achievements, 
that  is,  his  having  taken  half  the  globe  and  a  fifth  of  mankind  under  this  direction  and 
control and having transformed and illuminated the spiritual shape of the universe. This 
being so, the Ascension, which comprised the very fullest degree of that relationship, is 
most worthy and suitable for him.

588 

Second Principle 

What was the reality of the Ascension? 

The  Answer:  It  consisted  of  the  journeying  of  the  person  of  Muhammad  (PBUH) 
through the degrees of perfection. That is, through the various Names and titles He makes 
manifest in the disposition of creatures, and by showing that special servant of His all the 
works  of  His  dominicality  which  He  displays  in  the  spheres,  creation,  and  regulation 
within the sovereignty of His dominicality, and in the levels of the heavens within those 
spheres –each of which is the means to a seat of dominicality and centre for the disposal 
of  power–  God  Almighty  made  that  servant  both  embrace  all  human  perfections,  and 
display  all  the  Divine  manifestations,  and  view  all  the  levels  of  the  universe,  and  the 
herald of the  sovereignty of dominicality and the proclaimer of those things pleasing to 
God,  and  the  solver  of  the  talisman  of  the  universe.  And  so  that  he  could  do  this,  He 
mounted him on Buraq, caused him to flash through the heavens like lightning traversing 
all  its  levels, observe Divine dominicality  from  mansion to mansion  like the  moon, and 
from sphere to sphere, and showing him each of the prophets, his brothers, whose abodes 
are in the heavens of those spheres, He raised him to the station of a distance of two bow-
lengths and displayed to him His oneness and His Word and the vision of Himself. 
This exalted truth may be examined through the telescope of two comparisons. 
First Comparison: As is explained in the Twenty-Fourth Word, a king has different 
titles  in  the  different  spheres  and  offices  of  his  government,  different  qualities  and 
attributes in the classes of his subjects, and different names and marks in the degrees of 
his  sovereignty.  For  example,  he  is  Wise  Judge  in  the  judiciary,  Sovereign  in  the  civil 
service, Commander-in-Chief in the army, Caliph in the learned establishment, and so on; 
it is the same with the rest of his names and titles. In each sphere he has a seat or chair 
which  has  the  meaning  of  a  throne.  The  single  king  may  be  able  to  have  a  thousand 
names and titles in those spheres of sovereignty and levels of government; he may have a 
thousand thrones of sovereignty one within the other. It  is as  if the ruler  is present and 
knowing in every sphere through his corporate personality and through his telephone; and 
sees  and  is  seen  in  every  class  through  his  law,  regulation,  and  representatives;  and 
administers  and  observes  from  behind  the  veil  in  every  level  through  his  command, 
knowledge, and power; and has a different centre and headquarters in every sphere. His 
decrees  are  all  different  from  one  another,  and  his  levels  are  all  different  from  one 
another. 

 

589 

Thus, a king such as this may allow a person of his choosing to visit all his different 
spheres and offices and may show him the imperial dominion and sovereign commands 
special to each. He may cause him to travel from sphere to sphere and from level to level 
until he brings him to his presence. There he will entrust him with certain universal and 
general commands concerning all those spheres and will send him back. 

Similarly to this comparison, the Sustainer of All the Worlds, Who is the Sovereign 
of  Pre-Eternity  and  Post-Eternity,  has  functions  and  attributes  in  the  levels  of  His 
dominicality  which  are  all  different  but  that  look  to  one  another;  and  Names  and 
signatures  in  the  spheres  of  His  Divinity  which  are  all  different  but  which  appear  one 
within the other; and  manifestations and revelations  in the performance of  His  splendid 
deeds which are all different but which resemble each other; and titles in the disposal of 
His power which are all different, but which hint of one another; and sacred appearances 
in the  manifestation of His attributes which are all different but which all point to each 
other; and acts of disposal in the manifestation of His actions which are all different but 
complete  one  another;  and  He  has  a  majestic  dominicality  in  His  multicoloured  art  and 
creatures whose aspects are all different but which gaze on one another. 

As a consequence of this vast mystery, He ordered the universe and arranged it in an 
amazing  and  wonderful  fashion  with  different  formations  one  over  the  other  from 
particles, which are the tiniest level of creatures, to the heavens, and from the first level 
of the heavens to the Sublime Throne. Each heaven is like the roof of a different world, a 
throne for dominicality, a centre for Divine disposal. 

For sure, with regard to Divine oneness, all the Divine Names may be found in those 
spheres and levels; they are manifested together with the titles. But just as in the Ministry 
of Justice the title of Wise Judge was fundamental and dominant and there the rest of the 
king’s  titles  looked  to  its  command  and  were  dependent  on  it,  so  in  each  level  of 
creatures,  in  each  heaven,  one  Name,  one  Divine  title,  is  dominant,  and  the  other  titles 
look to it. 

For example, in whichever sphere of the heavens the Prophet Muhammad (Peace and 
blessings be upon him) met with Jesus (Peace be upon him), who manifested the Name of 
All-Powerful,  in  that  sphere  God  Almighty  Himself  was  manifested  with  title  of  All-
Powerful. And, for example, the most predominant in the sphere of the heavens which is 
Moses’ (Peace be upon him) seat is the title of Speaker, which he manifested.  And so on. 
Thus, since the person of Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him) manifested 
the Greatest Name, and all the Divine Names, and since his prophethood was universal, 
he was surely connected with all the spheres of  

 

590 

dominicality. And to meet with the prophets whose seats are in those spheres and to pass 
through all those levels, surely necessitates the fact of the Ascension. 

Second Comparison: The title of Commander-in-Chief, which is one of the titles of 
a king, is manifested and makes an appearance in every rank of the army from that of the 
commander-in-chief, which is a broad and universal rank, to that of a corporal, which is 
special and particular. For example, a private sees in the person of his corporal a sample 
of the imposing title of Commander-in-Chief, he looks to it and takes his orders from it. 
On  becoming  a  corporal,  the  manifestation  of  the  title  in  the  sergeant’s  rank  will 
command his attention and it will be to that that he will look. Then, if he is promoted to 
the  rank  of  sergeant,  he  will  see  a  sample  of  the  title  of  Commander-in-Chief  and  a 
manifestation of it in the lieutenant’s rank. It will be present together with a seat peculiar 
to it at that rank. And so on. He will see the title  in each of  its ranks of captain,  major, 
general, and field marshal in relation to its smallness or largeness. 

Now,  if  the  Commander-in-Chief  wishes  to  entrust  the  private  with  a  duty  which 
concerns all the ranks of the army,  if  he wishes to promote him to a rank where  he can 
observe each sphere like an inspector and himself be observed; he will cause him to make 
a  tour of  inspection  of  the  ranks,  from  that of  the  corporal  to the  highest,  and  will  also 
allow him to be seen. Then he will receive him into his presence and honouring him with 
conversation  and  conferring  on  him  a  decoration  and  a  decree,  will  send  him  back 
whence he came in an instant. 

The following point must be noted in this comparison: if the king is not in any way 
powerless and  if  he  has  spiritual power  in the same way that he  has  material power, he 
will  not  appoint  persons  like  the  general,  field  marshal  and  lieutenant  as  his 
representatives but will himself be present everywhere in person. He will give his orders 
directly,  merely  from  behind  certain  veils  and  individuals,  themselves  of  rank.  In  fact, 
there  are  narrations  relating  that  certain  kings  who  were  saints  of  the  highest  level 
executed their affairs in many spheres in the form of different individuals. 

As  far  as  the  truth  we  looked  at  in  this  comparison  is  concerned,  since  the 
Commander-in-Chief  was  in  no  way  impotent,  the  order  and  command  came  directly 
from him in every sphere. Affairs were executed through his command, will, and power. 

Like this comparison, the commands and authoritative functions of the Sovereign of 
Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, Who is the Ruler of the heavens and the earth, Owner of 
the  command  of  “Be!”  and  it  is,6  and  the  Absolute  Commander,  are  in  force  in  all  the 
levels of creatures and are conformed to  

                                                
6 See, Qur’an, 36:82, etc. 

 

591 

with  perfect  obedience  and  order.  Each  appears  as  a  sphere  of  dominicality,  a  level  of 
rulership in the levels of creatures and classes of beings, which stretch from particles to 
the  planets  and  from  flies  to  the  heavens,  and  which,  great  and  small,  particular  and 
universal, are all different but are such that they look one to the other. 

Now,  the  way  to  understand  the  exalted  aims  and  mighty  results  of  the  entire 
universe  and  to  see  all  the  different  duties  of  worship  of  all  its  levels;  and,  through 
observing the sovereignty of dominicality of the  One of Grandeur and the splendour of 
His rule, to understand what is pleasing to Him; and to be the herald of His sovereignty, 
is to make a journey through all those levels and spheres until the Sublime Throne, which 
is the title of the greatest sphere, is reached; until The distance of two bow-lengths. It is to 
meet  there  with  the  All-Glorious  and  Beauteous One.  And  this  journey  is  the  reality  of 
the Ascension. 

Like  ordinary  human  beings  travel  in  the  mind  with  the  speed  of  imagination,  and 
saints  journey  in  the  heart  with  the  speed  of  lightning,  like  angels,  which  are  luminous 
bodies, circulate with the speed of spirit from the Throne to the earth and from the earth 
to the Throne; and like the people of Paradise will rise to Paradise from the resurrection 
with the speed of Buraq through a distance greater than five hundred years;7 of a certainty 
the  body  of  Muhammad  (PBUH)  went  together  with  his  elevated  spirit  as  far  as  the 
Divine Throne. For the body of Muhammad (PBUH) was the treasury of the faculties of 
the spirit of Muhammad (PBUH), and the means for the performance of its duties, which 
is  light and  has the characteristics of  light, is subtler than the  hearts of the  saints,  more 
insubstantial than the spirits of the dead and the bodies of the angels, and more ethereal 
than the astral bodies and subtle bodies. 

Now we consider the atheist who is listening. It comes to mind that he would think 
of saying: “I do not recognize God and I do not know the Prophet (PBUH), how should I 
believe in the Ascension?” To which we would reply as follows. 

Since the universe and beings exist, and within them are acts and creation; and since 
an  orderly  act  cannot  occur  without  an  author,  a  meaningful  book  cannot  be  without  a 
scribe, and a skilful embroidery be without an embroiderer; the purposeful acts which fill 
the universe surely have an author, and the meaningful letters and amazing embroideries 
which cover the  face of the earth and are renewed  from season to season  have  a scribe 
and an embroiderer. 

And  since  two  governors  directing  the  same  matter  spoils  the  order  in  that  matter 

being spoilt; and since from a fly’s wing to the lamps in the heavens  

                                                

7 Bukhari, viii, 147; Ibn Mubarak, al-Zuhd, ii, 122. 

 

592 

there is perfect order, there must be only one governor, one ruler. For the art and wisdom 
in everything is so wonderful it necessitates that the Maker of one thing is powerful over 
all things, to the extent that He knows every matter. Since this is so, if He was not One, 
there would  have to be gods to the number of  beings. These would  be  both opposed to 
and  similar  to  one  another,  and  it  would  therefore  be  a  hundred  thousand  times 
impossible for this wonderful order not to be broken. 

Furthermore, since as is self-evidently apparent, at a command the classes of beings 
are  in  motion  in  a  fashion  a  thousand  times  more  well-ordered  than  an  army  –  each 
group,  from  the  stars,  sun  and  moon  and  their  motions  to  the  flowers  of  the  almond, 
displaying the decorations and uniforms the Pre-Eternal All-Powerful One has conferred 
on it, and the motion He has determined, a thousand times more regularly and perfectly 
than an army – since this is so, the universe has an Absolute Ruler behind the veil of the 
Unseen to Whose command its beings look and conform. 

And  since  according  to  the  testimony  of  all  the  wise  matters  He  carries  out  and 
splendid works He displays, the Ruler is an All-Glorious Sovereign; and since according 
to the bounties He demonstrates He is a most Compassionate Sustainer, and according to 
the beautiful examples of His art which  He exhibits, He  is a  Maker  Who  loves His art; 
and  since  He  is  an  All-Wise  Creator  Who  wishes  to  attract  to  His  works  of  art  the 
admiring gazes of conscious beings through the adornments and skills He demonstrates; 
and since  it  may  be understood that He wishes to  make known to conscious  beings the 
meaning of the adornments, which astound the mind, that He displays in the creation of 
the  world  and  to  inform  them  through  the  wisdom  of  His  dominicality  about  where 
creatures come  from and where they  are going;  most certainly, this  All-Wise  Ruler and 
All-Knowing Maker wishes to demonstrate His dominicality. 

And  since  he  wishes  to  make  Himself  known  and  loved  by  conscious  creatures 
through the great many works of benevolence and mercy and wonders of art He displays, 
He will  surely  make known to them by  means of a herald what He desires of them and 
what those things are that please Him, and concern them.  

Since this  is so, He will  appoint one of the conscious  beings and will proclaim His 
dominicality  through  him.  He  will  honour  a  herald  with  the  proximity  of  His  presence 
and  make  him  the  means  of  exhibiting  the  art  which  He  loves.  He  will  appoint  one  of 
them as a teacher in order to inform other conscious beings of those exalted aims and to 
display His perfections. He will certainly appoint a guide so that the talisman contained 
in  the  universe  and  the  riddle  of  dominicality  He  has  concealed  within  beings  will  not 
remain meaningless. And He will appoint a guide who will teach the purposes contained 
in the beauties of art He displays and publishes as a  

 

593 

spectacle  for  all  to  gaze  on  so  that  they  do  not  remain  useless  and  vain.  Moreover,  in 
order to  announce  the  things  that  please  Him  to conscious  beings,  He  will  raise  one  of 
them  to  a  rank  above  the  others,  and  will  inform  him  of  those  things  and  send  him  to 
them. 

Since reality and wisdom require  it to be thus and the one  most worthy to perform 
this duty was the Prophet Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him), for he actually 
performed those duties most perfectly, to which fact the world of Islam which he founded 
and the light of Islam which he showed are truthful and just witnesses; this necessitates 
that  he  should  have  risen  above  all  the  rest  of  the  universe,  surpassed  all  beings,  and 
attained to a rank at which he held a universal, elevated, and all-embracing conversation 
with the Creator of all beings. Thus, the Ascension expresses this truth as well. 

In Short: Since He has formed, arranged, and adorned the vast universe in this way 
for mighty purposes and sublime aims such as those mentioned above; and since among 
beings  mankind  exists  to  see  this  universal  dominicality  together  with  all  its  subtleties 
and  this  supreme  Divine  sovereignty  together  with  all  its  truths;  most  certainly  that 
Absolute Ruler will speak with man, He will inform him of His purposes. 

Since  everyone  cannot  free  themselves  from  particular,  insignificant,  and  lowly 
matters  and  rise  to  the  highest  and  universal  position,  and  therefore  cannot  themselves 
receive  the  Ruler’s  universal  address,  certain  special  individuals  from  among  human 
beings will be appointed to that duty so that it may be related to in two respects. First, in 
order to teach human beings, they must be human beings themselves. And in order to be 
able to receive the address directly, they must be extremely exalted spiritually. 

Thus, since among those human beings the one who made known the purposes of the 
universe’s  Maker  most  perfectly,  disclosed  the  talisman  of  the  universe  and  solved  the 
riddle of creation, and who heralded the sublimity of the  sovereignty of dominicality  in 
the best way was Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him), certainly, of all human 
beings  he  would  make  a  spiritual  journey  in  the  form  of  an  Ascension  touring  the 
corporeal world; he would traverse all the levels to beyond the intermediate world of the 
Divine  Names,  the  manifestation  of  the  Divine  attributes  and  acts,  and  the  levels  of 
beings,  all  of  which  are  known  as  the  seventy  thousand  veils.  And  the  Ascension  was 
this. 

Again the following comes to mind: O listener!  You are thinking of asking:  “How 
should I  believe  it?  What does it  mean to traverse a distance of thousands of  years to a 
Sustainer  Who  is  closer than  anything else and to meet with Him after passing through 
seventy thousand veils?” To which we reply as follows: 

 

594 

God Almighty is closer to everything than anything else, but everything is infinitely 
distant  from  Him.  For  example,  if  the  sun  possessed  consciousness  and  the  power  of 
speech, it would be able to converse with you by means of a mirror held in your hand. It 
would have power of disposal over you as it wished. Indeed, although it would be closer 
to  you  than  the  pupil  of  your  eye,  which  is  like  a  mirror,  you  would  be  approximately 
four  thousand  years’  distance  from  it  and  could  in  no  way  draw  closer  to  it.  If  you 
progressed and rose to the position of the  moon  and came to the point of  being  face to 
face with it, you would still only be able to be a sort of mirror to it. 

 Similarly, although the All-Glorious One, Who is the Sun of Pre-Eternity and Post-
Eternity,  is closer to everything than  anything else, everything  is  infinitely  distant  from 
Him.  Only  one  who  traverses  all  beings,  rises  above  particularity  and  gradually  passes 
through the thousands of veils in the degrees of universality till he approaches a Divine 
Name which encompasses all beings, and then traverses the many degrees beyond it, may 
be honoured by a sort of Divine proximity. 

For example, a private is far inferior in rank to the commander-in-chief. He looks to 
his  commander  through  the  small  sample  of  his  commander’s  rank  he  sees  in  his 
corporal, at a great distance and beyond many veils, as it were. To gain true proximity to 
his rank through his corporate personality, the private has to pass through many universal 
degrees or ranks, like that of lieutenant, captain, and major. Whereas the commander-in-
chief can be present with the private and seeing, in person as well as in meaning, through 
his  commands,  regulations,  view,  decree,  and  knowledge.  Since  this  truth  has  been 
proved  decisively  in  the  Sixteenth  Word,  we  deem  that  sufficient  and  cut  short  the 
discussion here. 

Again it comes to mind that you are thinking of asking: “I deny the existence of the 
heavens and I do not believe in the angels, so how can I believe in someone travelling in 
the heavens and meeting with the angels?” 

Yes,  of  course,  it  is  difficult  to  demonstrate  something  and  convince  someone  like 
you  over  whose  eyes  a  veil  has  been  drawn  and  who  sees  only  what  is  immediately 
apparent to them. But the truth is so brilliant that even the blind can see it, so we also say 
what  is  unanimously  agreed,  that  the  depths  of  space  are  full  of  matter  called  ‘ether’. 
Subtle energies like light, electricity, and heat point to the existence of some subtle matter 
which fills space. For just as fruits clearly demonstrate the existence of the tree that bore 
them,  flowers  their  flower-bed,  shoots  their  seed-bed,  and  fishes  the  sea,  the  stars  also 
thrust  before the  mind’s  eye  the  necessary  existence  of  their  source,  seed-bed,  sea,  and 
flower-bed. 

Since there are different formations in the world above us and different rules are seen 

to be in force under different conditions, the heavens, which  

 

595 

are the  source of  those  rules,  also  differ.  And  since  just  as  in  man  there  are  immaterial 
faculties  apart  from  his  body,  like  the  mind,  heart,  spirit,  imagination,  and  memory, 
certainly in the world, which is the macroanthropos, and in the universe, which is the tree 
of  which  man  is  the  fruit,  there  are  other  worlds  apart  from  the  corporeal  world. 
Moreover, there are heavens to each world,  from the world of the earth to the world of 
Paradise. 

As  far as the angels are concerned, we say this:  on the globe of the earth, which  is 
medium-sized  among  the  planets  and  insignificant  and  dense  among  the  stars,  animate 
and  conscious  beings,  the  most  valuable  and  luminous  among  beings,  are  found  in 
countless  numbers.  So  surely  the  stars,  which  are  like  embellished  castles  and  fine 
palaces compared to the earth, which  is  like a dark house, and the skies, which are  like 
the  seas  of  the  stars,  will  be  the  dwelling-places  of  angels  and  spirit  beings,  which  are 
conscious, animate, extremely numerous, and of various sorts. 

In  my  commentary  on  the  Holy  Qur’an  called  Isharat  al-I’jaz  (Signs  of 
Miraculousness),  both  the  existence  and  plurality  of  the  heavens  have  been  proved 
conclusively in the section on the verse, 

Then  He  applied  His  design  to  the  heavens  and  fashioned  them  into  seven 
heavens,8 

and in the Twenty-Ninth Word we have proved the existence of angels with the finality 
of  two  plus  two  equals  four,  so  considering  those  to  be  sufficient  we  cut  short  the 
discussion here. 

In  Short:  It  is  required  by  wisdom  and  by  reason  that  the  heavens  are  formed  of 
ether, that they are the source of subtle energies  like electricity,  light, heat, and gravity, 
and  that,  in  accordance  with  the  Hadith,  “The  heavens  are  waves  held  back,”9  they  are 
favourable for the motion of stars and planets. It is further required that from majarrat al-
sama’10  (the  Milky  Way)  to  the  closest  planet  they  should  consist  of  seven  levels  in 
different  states  and  formations,  and  that  each  level,  each  world,  from  the  world  of  the 
earth to the Intermediate Realm and World of Similitudes, to the World of the Hereafter, 
should have a heaven, like a roof. 

And the following comes to mind: O atheist! You say: “Man is only able to ascend 
to  a  height  of  one  or  two  kilometres  with  a  thousand  difficulties  by  means  of  the 
aeroplane.11 How then could someone come and go bodily within a few minutes covering 
a distance that would normally take thousands of years?” 

                                                

8 Qur’an, 2:29.

11 This treatise was written in 1928 or ‘29. [Tr.] 

 

596 

To which we reply:  According to your science,  in  its annual rotation a  heavy  body 
like the earth cuts a distance of approximately one hundred and eighty-eight hours in one 
minute.  In  one  year  it  covers  a  distance  of  approximately  twenty-five  thousand  years. 
Should  an  All-Powerful  and  Glorious  One,  then,  Who  causes  its  regular  motion  and 
revolves  it  like  a  stone  in  a  sling  be  unable  to  convey  a  human  being  to  His  Throne? 
Should a wisdom that causes the  body of the earth, which  is extremely  heavy, to travel 
around the sun through a dominical law known the sun’s gravity like a Mevlevi dervish 
be  unable  to  raise  a  human  body  to  the  Throne  of  the  All-Merciful  One  like  lightning 
through the gravity of that All-Merciful One’s mercy and the attraction of the Pre-Eternal 
Sun’s love? 

Again it comes to mind that you would say: “All right, so he could ascend there, but 
why  did  he  and  why  should  he?  Would  it  not  have  been  enough  if  he  had  gone  just  in 
heart and spirit like the saints?” 

To  which  we  would  reply:  Since  the  All-Glorious  Maker  wished  to  display  His 
wondrous signs which lie in both the outer aspects of things and in their aspects that look 
directly to Himself, and to make the workshops and sources of the universe spectacles to 
be  gazed  upon,  and  to  point  out  the  results  of  man’s  actions  in  the  hereafter,  it  was 
necessary  to  take  together  with  his  heart  and  spirit  as  far  as  His  Throne  Muhammad’s 
(PBUH) eyes, which were like the key to the world of visible objects, and his ears, which 
perceived  the  signs  in  the  world  of  sound.  Furthermore,  it  is  required  by  wisdom  and 
reason  that the  All-Glorious  Maker  should  have  taken  as  far  as  His  Throne  his  blessed 
body,  which  was  like  the  machine  of  his  spirit  comprising  different  members  and 
components, by means of which be performed his duties. 

Just as in Paradise Divine wisdom makes the body accompany the spirit, because it is 
the body that is the means by which the duties of worship are performed and the means of 
innumerable pleasures and pains, so did his blessed body accompany his spirit. Since the 
body  goes  to  Paradise  together  with  the  spirit,  it  is  pure  wisdom  that  He  should  have 
made  the  blessed  body  of  Muhammad  (PBUH)  accompany  his  self,  which  ascended  to 
the Lote-tree of the farthest limit, which is the trunk of the home of Paradise. 

Again it comes to mind that you would say: “According to rational criteria is it not 

impossible to traverse a distance of thousands of years in several minutes?” 

To  which  we  would  reply:  The  motion  in  the  different  works  of  the  All-Glorious 
Maker’s art varies to the utmost degree. For example, it is well-known how different are 
the  speeds  of  light,  electricity,  spirit,  and  imagination,  and  that  of  sound.  And,  as  has 
been established by science, the speeds of the motion of different planets are so different 
that it astounds the mind.  

 

597 

How then should the motion at the speed of spirit of his subtle body, which followed his 
exalted spirit during the Ascension, seem contrary to reason? 

Furthermore, it sometimes happens that on sleeping for ten minutes you are subject 
to a  year’s-worth of different states. And even,  if the words spoken and  heard during a 
dream lasting one minute were collected together, for them to be spoken and heard in the 
waking world, a day or even longer, would be necessary. That means a single period of 
time is relative; it may seem like one day to one person and like a year to another. 

Consider  the  meaning  of  this  by  means  of  a  comparison.  Let  us  imagine  a  clock 
which measures the speed of the movement displayed by man, cannon-balls, sound, light, 
electricity, spirit, and imagination. The clock has ten hands. One shows the hours while 
another  counts  the  minutes  in  a  sphere  sixty  times  greater.  Another  hand  counts  the 
seconds in a sphere sixty times greater than the previous one, and yet others each count 
regularly decreasing fractions to a tenth of a second in vast spheres that regularly increase 
sixty times. 

Let us suppose the circles described by the hand counting hours was the size of our 
clock,  so that of  the  hand  counting  tenths  of  a  second  would  have  to  be the  size  of  the 
annual orbit of the earth, or even larger. Now, let us suppose there are two people. One of 
them is as though mounted on the hour-hand and observes according to its motion while 
the  other  is  on  the  hand  counting  tenths  of  a  second.  There  will  be  an  enormous 
difference, as great as the relation between our clock and the annual orbit of the earth, as 
regards the things observed by these two individuals in the same period of time. 

Thus, since time  is  like a  hue, shade, or ribbon of  motion, a rule that  is  in  force  in 
motion is also in force in time. And so, although the things we observe in the period of 
one hour would be equalled in amount by the conscious individual mounted on the hour-
hand of the clock, like the one mounted on the hand counting tenths of a second, God’s 
Noble Messenger(Peace and blessings be upon him) mounted Buraq of Divine Assistance 
and  in the same space of time,  in that specified  hour, like  lightning traversed the entire 
sphere  of  contingency,  saw  the  wonders  of  the  outer  aspects  of  things  and  the  aspects 
which  look  to  their  Creator,  ascended  to  the  point  of  the  sphere  of  necessity,  was 
honoured  with  Divine  conversation  and  favoured  with  the  vision  of  Divine  beauty, 
received his decree, and returned to his duty. It was possible for this to happen, and it did 
happen. 

And  again  it  comes  to  mind  that  you  would  say:  “Yes,  so  it  could  happen,  it  is 
possible. But everything possible does not occur, does it? Is there anything else similar to 
this so that it can be accepted? How can the occurrence of something to which there are 
no similar cases be posited through only probability?” 

 

598 

To which we would reply: There are so many similar cases to it that they cannot be 
enumerated. For example, anyone who possesses sight can ascend with his eyes from the 
ground  to  the  planet  Neptune  in  a  second.  Anyone  who  has  knowledge  can  mount  the 
laws of astronomy with his intellect and travel beyond the stars in a minute. Anyone who 
has  belief  can,  by  mounting  his  thought  on  the  action  and  pillars  of  the  obligatory 
prayers,  through  a  sort  of  Ascension,  leave  the  universe  behind  and  go  as  far  as  the 
Divine presence. Anyone who sees with his heart and any saint of perfection can, through 
his  spiritual  journeying,  traverse  in  forty  days  the  Divine  Throne  and  the  sphere  of  the 
Divine Names and attributes. And certain persons, even, like Shaykh Geylani and Imam-i 
Rabbani, truthfully recorded their spiritual ascensions as far as the Throne, which lasted a 
minute. 

Furthermore, there is the coming and going of the angels, which are luminous bodies, 
from the Divine Throne to the earth and from the earth to the Throne in a short period of 
time.  And  the  people  of  Paradise  ascend  to  the  gardens  of  Paradise  from  the  plain  of 
resurrection in a short space of time. Of course, this many examples demonstrate that it is 
pure wisdom, completely rational, and an occurrence about which there can be no doubt 
that the person of Muhammad (PBUH), who is the Lord of all the saints, the leader of all 
the believers, the head of the people of Paradise, and is accepted by all the angels, should 
have  had  an  ascension  which  was  the  means  of  spiritual  journeying,  and  that  it  should 
have been in a form appropriate to his rank. 

Third Principle 

What was the wisdom and purpose of the Ascension? 

The Answer: The wisdom of the Ascension is so exalted that human thought cannot 
comprehend  it.  It  is  so  profound  that  human  thought  cannot reach  it,  and  so  subtle  and 
fine  that  the  intellect  cannot  see  it  by  itself.  But  even  if  the  reality  of  the  instances  of 
wisdom in the Ascension cannot be comprehended, their existence may be made known 
through certain indications. For example, as follows: 

In order to demonstrate the light of His unity and the manifestation of His oneness in 
these  levels  of  multiplicity,  the  Creator  of  the  universe  chose  an  eminent  individual  to 
represent all creatures, and took him by means of an Ascension that was like a link from 
the  furthest  levels  of  multiplicity  to  the  source  of  unity.  There,  addressing  him  as 
representing  all  conscious  beings,  He  explained  to  him  the  Divine  purposes  and  made 
them  known  through  him,  and  observed  through  his  gaze  the  beauty  of  His  art  and 
perfection of His dominicality in the mirrors of His creatures, and caused him to observe 
them.  

 

599 

Moreover,  according  to  the  testimony  of  His  works,  the  Maker  of  the  world 
possesses infinite beauty and perfection. The two of them, both beauty and perfection, are 
loved for themselves. Since this is so, the Possessor of that beauty and perfection has an 
infinite love for them, and His infinite love is manifested in many different ways in His 
works of art. He loves His works of art because He sees His beauty and perfection within 
them. 

The most lovable and elevated among the works of art are animate beings. The most 
lovable and elevated among animate beings are conscious beings. And by reason of their 
comprehensiveness,  the  most  lovable  among  conscious  beings  are  to  be  found  among 
human beings. The most lovable individual among human beings is the one who has most 
fully  developed  his  potentiality  and  displayed  the  samples  within  it  of  the  perfections 
manifested in all creatures and spread among them. 

Thus,  in  order  to  see  at  one  point  and  in  one  mirror  all  the  varieties  of  His  love 
spread through all  creatures and to display, through the  mystery of His oneness, all the 
varieties  of  His  beauty,  the  Maker  of  beings  will  take  a  person  who  is  at the  degree  of 
being a luminous fruit of the tree of creation and whose heart is like a seed containing the 
essential truths of that tree, and will demonstrate the belovedness of that individual, who 
represents the universe, through an Ascension that is like a thread linking the seed, which 
is  the  origin,  with  the  fruit,  which  is  the  end.  He  will  draw  him  to  His  presence  and 
honour him with the beauty of the vision of Himself. And, in order to cause him to spread 
that sacred state to others, He will  favour him with His  Word and entrust him with His 
Decree. 

In order to look at this exalted wisdom, we shall observe it through the telescope of 

two comparisons. 

First Comparison: As is explained in detail in the story-comparison in the Eleventh 
Word, there was an illustrious king who had vast treasuries and in those treasuries many 
varieties of jewels were to be found. He had much skill in strange crafts, comprehensive 
knowledge  of  innumerable  curious  arts,  and  erudition  and  learning  in  numberless 
wondrous  sciences.  In  accordance  with  the  mystery  that  every  possessor  of  beauty  and 
perfection wants both to see and display his beauty and perfection, of course that skilful 
king wished to open an exhibition and to set up displays within it in order to reveal to the 
people the splendour of his sovereignty so they might gaze on it, and to manifest both the 
glitter of his wealth and the wonders of his art and the marvels of his knowledge. In this 
way  he  might observe  his own transcendent  beauty  and perfection  in two respects. The 
first was so that he himself might see with his own eyes, which were cognizant of reality, 
while the other was so that he might look through the gaze of others. 

As a consequence of this wisdom, he began to build a huge and splendid  

 

600 

palace.  It  was  magnificently  divided  into  apartments  and  mansions.  He  adorned  it  with 
every  sort  of  bejewelled  treasure  from  his  coffers,  and  decorated  it  with  the  finest  and 
most gorgeous arts of his own handiwork. He ordered it with the greatest refinements of 
his knowledge and science, and decked it out and completed it with the miraculous works 
of his learning. Next, he spread tables with varieties of bounties and the most delicious of 
foods worthy for each group and prepared a general banquet. Then, in order to display his 
perfections to his subjects, he invited them to the banquet and to behold the perfections. 

Then he appointed one of them as the highest ranking general, invited him up from 
the lower levels and mansions to tour sphere after sphere in the levels rising one after the 
other. Showing him the successive machinery and workshops of his wonderful art and the 
storehouses  for  the  produce  coming  from  below,  he  brought  him  to  his  own  particular 
sphere and private apartment. There, he honoured him through showing him the blessed 
person who was the source of all those perfections and taking him into his presence. He 
informed  him of the true nature of the palace and of  his own perfections. He appointed 
him as guide to the other spectators and sent him back. He was to describe to the people 
the palace’s maker by means of its contents, inscriptions, and wonders, and inform those 
who  entered  the  palace  of  the  allusive  meanings  of  the  inscriptions  within  it,  what  the 
works of art signified, and what the  harmonious  and well-proportioned  inscriptions  and 
works of art in its interior were, and how they pointed to the perfections and skills of the 
palace’s  owner.  He  was  also  to  teach  them  the  correct  behaviour  and  formalities  in 
viewing  the  exhibition  and  describe  the  protocol  and  ceremonies  which  were  in 
accordance  with  the  pleasure  and  desires  of  the  learned  and  skilful  king,  who  did  not 
appear. 

In  exactly  the  same  way,  And  God’s  is  the  highest  similitude,  the  All-Glorious 
Maker,  Who  is  the  Monarch  of  Pre-Eternity  and  Post-Eternity,  desired  to  behold  and 
display  His  infinite perfections and  boundless  beauty. So He  made this world  in such a 
fashion that every being utters His perfections with numerous tongues and points to His 
beauty  with  many  signs.  The  universe  shows  through  all  its  beings  the  many  hidden 
immaterial treasures in all of His Most Beautiful Names and the many veiled subtleties in 
all of His sacred titles. And  it shows this  in such  a way that, although since the time of 
Adam, all sciences together with all of their laws have studied this book of the universe, 
only  a  tiny  proportion  of  the  book’s  meanings  and  signs,  which  state  and  point  to  the 
Divine Names and perfections, have been read. 

Thus,  the  wisdom  of  the  All-Glorious  One  of  Beauty,  the  All-Beauteous  One  of 
Glory, the Maker possessing Perfection, Who opens the palace of the world as though it 
was  an  exhibition  in  order  to  see  and  display  His  own  transcendent  beauty  and 
perfections, requires that He should inform  

 

601 

someone of the meaning of the palace’s signs so that they do not remain vain and without 
benefit for conscious beings on the earth. His wisdom requires that He should cause one 
of them to travel in the higher worlds, which are the sources of the wonders in the palace 
and are the treasuries of their results; that He should elevate him above all others, honour 
him with His close presence and cause him to tour the worlds of the hereafter, and entrust 
him with numerous duties, such as teacher to all His servants, herald of the sovereignty of 
His  dominicality,  announcer  of  those  things  pleasing  to  Himself,  and  expounder  of  the 
signs of creation in the palace of the world; that He should mark out his pre-eminence by 
conferring on him the decorations of miracles, and should make known through a decree 
like  the  Qur’an  that  that  person  is  the  truthful  personal  interpreter  of  the  All-Glorious 
One. 

Thus,  by  way  of  example,  we  have  demonstrated  through  the  telescope  of  this 
comparison one or two of the many instances of wisdom in the Ascension. Others may be 
thought of in the same way. 

Second  Comparison:  If  a  knowledgeable  and  skilful  person  were  to  compose  and 
write a miraculous book, and on all the book’s pages were as many truths as would fill a 
hundred books, and in all its lines as many subtle meanings as would fill a hundred pages, 
and in all its words as many truths as would fill a hundred lines, and in all  its letters as 
many meanings as would fill a hundred words, and if all the meanings and truths of the 
book were to look to and point to the transcendent perfections of  its  miracle-displaying 
writer, he most certainly would not leave such an inexhaustible treasury closed and thus 
worthless.  He  would  surely  teach  it  to  others  so  that  such  a  valuable  book  would  not 
remain  meaningless  and  vain,  and  his  own  hidden  perfections  would  become  apparent 
and find their perfection, and his transcendent beauty be seen; and so that he too should 
be pleased, and that he should make himself loved. Moreover, he would cause someone 
to  go  through  that  wonderful  book  from  the  first  page  to  the  last  and  teach  him  all  its 
meanings and truths so that the person would then teach them to others. 

In  exactly  the  same  way,  in  order  to  display  His  perfections,  His  beauty,  and  the 
truths of His Names, the Pre-Eternal Inscriber has written the universe in such a way that 
all beings set forth and state His infinite perfections, Names, and attributes together with 
their  innumerable  facets and aspects. Of course, if a  book’s  meaning remains unknown, 
its value is reduced to nothing. However, a book like the universe, every word of which 
contains thousands of meanings, cannot lose its value or be made to do so. 

Since this is so, the book’s Writer will certainly make it known and explain a part of 
it to each group according to their capacity. He will instruct in all the contents of the book 
the individual who has the most extensive and  

 

602 

comprehensive view, the most universal consciousness, and the greatest ability. Wisdom 
requires that He should take the individual on a lofty journey in order to teach him all the 
contents of such a  book and  its universal truths.  That  is, He should cause  him to travel 
from  the  furthest  extreme  of  the  levels  of  multiplicity,  which  is  the  first  page,  to  the 
sphere of Divine oneness, which is the final page. Thus, through this comparison, you can 
look to an extent at the exalted instances of wisdom in the Ascension. 

Now,  we  shall  consider  the  atheist  who  is  listening,  and,  listening  to  his  heart,  we 
shall learn what state it is in. And so it comes to mind that his heart would say:  “I have 
begun to believe in it now, but I still do not have a clear understanding of it. I have three 
more important difficulties. 

“The  First:  Why  was  this  mighty  Ascension  special  to  Muhammad  the  Arabian 

(Peace and blessings be upon him)? 

“The Second: How is he the seed of the universe? And you say that the universe was 
created from  his  Light, and also that he was  its  farthest and  most  illumined  fruit.  What 
does that mean? 

“The Third: In your explanations above you say that he made his Ascension in order 
to rise to the celestial realm and to see the machinery and workshops of the works of art 
found in the realm of the earth, and the treasuries of their results. What does this mean?” 

The Answer 

Your First Difficulty: It has been analysed in detail in the first thirty Words, so here 
we shall set out a concise  list briefly  indicating the perfections of Muhammad (PBUH), 
the  signs  of  his  prophethood,  and  the  fact  that  he  was  the  most  worthy  to  make  the 
Ascension. It is as follows. 

Firstly:  Despite numerous corruptions in the texts of Holy Scriptures like the Torah, 
Gospels, and Psalms, in recent times even, an exacting scholar like Husayn Jisri extracted 
one hundred and fourteen good tidings of Muhammad’s prophethood (PBUH), which he 
set forth in his Risale-i Hamidiye.12 

Secondly:    It  has  been  proved  historically  that  there  were  many  predictions 
accurately  forecasting  the  prophethood  of  Muhammad  (PBUH),  like  those  of  the  two 
soothsayers Shiqq and Satih, which, a while previously to his prophethood, gave news of 
it and the fact that he was to be the final prophet.13 

Thirdly:    There  were  hundreds  of  extraordinary  happenings,  famous  in  history, 
called irhasat, that is, signs forewarning men of a coming prophet, like, for example, on 
the night of Muhammad’s (PBUH) birth, the idols in the

Ka’ba  fell  from  their  places  and  the  famous  palace  of  Khosroes  the  Persian  was  rent 
asunder.14 

Fourthly:  History and the Prophet’s biographies show that he satisfied the thirst of 
an army with water flowing from his fingers, that in the presence of a large congregation 
in the  mosque, the dry wooden support against which Muhammad (PBUH) was  leaning 
moaned like a camel and wept on being separated from him when he ascended the pulpit, 
and that he was distinguished by close on a thousand miracles attested to by the verses of 
the Qur’an, such as, 

And the moon split,15 

referring to the splitting of the moon, and verified by those who investigated them. 

Fifthly:  Anyone who considers the facts and is fair and just cannot hesitate to agree 
that, as  is unanimously  agreed  by  friend  and  foe  alike, good moral qualities were to be 
found at the highest degree in his personality, and that, in accordance with the testimony 
of  all  his  dealings  and  actions,  attributes  and  character  of  the  greatest  excellence  were 
apparent  in  the  way  he  performed  his  duties  and  proclaimed  Islam,  and,  in  accordance 
with the fine qualities and conduct enjoined by the religion of Islam, laudable virtues of 
the highest order were to be found in the law he brought. 

Sixthly:    As  is  alluded  to  in  the  Second  Indication  of  the  Tenth  Word,  it  is  a 
requirement  of  wisdom  that  Divinity  be  manifested.  And  this  desire  of  Divinity  to  be 
manifested is met at the highest level and most brilliantly by the comprehensive worship 
performed by Muhammad (PBUH) in the practice of his religion. Also, wisdom and truth 
require  that the  Creator of  the  world  displays  His  beauty  in  its  utter  perfection  through 
some  means.  And  the  one  who  met  that  wish,  and  displayed  and  described  His  beauty 
most perfectly was self-evidently the person of Muhammad (PBUH). 

It was also clearly Muhammad (PBUH) who, in response to the desire of the world’s 
Maker to exhibit and attract attentive gazes towards His perfect art within infinite beauty, 
heralded that art with the loudest voice. 

Again  it was  necessarily Muhammad (PBUH) who, in response to the desire of the 
Sustainer of All the Worlds to proclaim His unity in the levels of multiplicity, announced 
all the degrees of unity, each at the greatest level of unity. 

And,  as  is  indicated  by  the  utter  beauty  in  beings  and  as  is  required  by  truth  and 
wisdom,  the  world’s  Owner  desires  to  see  and  display  in  mirrors,  His  infinite  essential 
beauty and the subtleties and qualities of His exquisite 

                                                

14 Qadi Iyad, al-Shifa’, i, 366-8; Bayhaqi, Dala’il al-Nubuwwa, i, 126. 
15 Qur’an, 54:1. 

 

604 

ness.  And  again  it  was  self-evidently  Muhammad  (PBUH)  who,  in  response  to  that 
desire, acted as a mirror and displayed His beauty in the most radiant fashion, and loved 
it and made others love it. 

Also, in response to the desire of the Maker of the palace of this world to exhibit His 
hidden treasuries, which are filled with the most wonderful miracles and priceless jewels, 
and  through  them  to  describe  and  make  known  His  perfections,  it  was  again  self-
evidently Muhammad (PBUH) who exhibited, described, and displayed them in the most 
comprehensive fashion. 

Also,  since  the  Maker  of  the  universe  has  made  it  in  such  a  way  that  He  adorns  it 
with  different  varieties  of  wonders  and  embellishments  and  has  included  conscious 
creatures in it so that they might make tours and excursions and ponder over it and take 
lessons, wisdom requires that He should desire to make known the meanings and value of 
the  works  of  art  to  those  who  observe  and  ponder  over  them.  And  it  was  again  self-
evidently  Muhammad  (PBUH)  who,  in  response  to this  desire  of  the  universe’s  Maker, 
by  means of the  All-Wise Qur’an, acted as guide  in the  most comprehensive  fashion to 
jinn and man, indeed, to spirit beings and angels. 

Also, the All-Wise Ruler of the universe wishes, by means of an envoy, to cause all 
conscious beings to unravel the obscure talisman containing the aims and purposes of the 
change and transformations in the universe and to solve the riddle of the three perplexing 
questions: “Where do beings come form?”, “What is their destination?”, and, “What are 
they?” And again it was self-evidently Muhammad (PBUH) who, in response to this wish 
of the All-Wise Ruler, by means of the truths of the Qur’an, unravelled the talisman and 
solved the riddle in the clearest and most comprehensive fashion. 

Also,  the  All-Glorious  Maker  of  the  universe  desires  to  make  Himself  known  to 
conscious beings by means of all His fine artefacts and to make them love Him through 
all  His  precious  bounties,  and,  most  certainly,  to make  known  to them  by  means  of  an 
envoy His wishes and what will please Him in return for those bounties. And again it was 
self-evidently  Muhammad  (PBUH)  who,  in  response  to  this  desire  of  the  All-Glorious 
Maker, by  means of the Qur’an, expounded those wishes and things that please Him  in 
the most exalted and perfect fashion. 

Also, since the Sustainer of All the Worlds has given to man, who is the fruit of the 
universe, a comprehensive disposition which encompasses the universe and has prepared 
him for universal worship, and since, because of his faculties and senses, multiplicity and 
the world afflict man, the Sustainer desires to turn man’s face from multiplicity to unity, 
from  transience  to  permanence.  And  again  it  was  self-evidently  Muhammad  (PBUH) 
who,  in  response  to  this  desire,  by  means  of  the  Qur’an,  acted  as  guide  in  the  most 
comprehensive  and  complete  fashion,  and  in  the  best  way,  and  carried  out  the  duty  of 
prophethood in the most perfect manner. 

 

605 

Among beings the most superior are animate beings, and among animate beings the 
most  superior  are  conscious  beings,  and  among  conscious  beings  the  most  superior  are 
true  human  beings.  So  the  one  among  true  human  beings  who  carried  out  the  above-
mentioned duties at the most comprehensive level and in the most perfect manner would 
rise through an all-embracing Ascension to the distance of two bow-lengths, knock at the 
door of eternal happiness, open the treasury of Mercy, and see the hidden truths of belief. 
Again it would be him. 

Seventhly:  As  is plain to see, beings are  made beautiful  with the utmost degree of 
fine  embellishment  and  adornment.  Such  an  embellishment  and  adornment  clearly 
demonstrate  that their  Maker  possesses  an  extremely  strong  will  to  make  beautiful  and 
intention  to  adorn.  The  will  to  make  beautiful  and  adorn  demonstrates  that  the  Maker 
necessarily  possesses  a  strong  desire  for  and  holy  love  towards  His  art.  And  among 
beings  the  one  who  displayed  altogether  in  himself  the  most  comprehensive  and  subtle 
wonders  of  art,  and  knew  them  and  made  them  known  and  himself  loved,  and  who 
appreciated the beauties to be found in other beings, declaring:  “What wonders God has 
willed!”, and was most beloved in the sight of his Maker, Who nurtures and loves His art, 
would most certainly be him. 

Thus, the one who, declaring: “Glory be to God! What wonders God has willed! God 
is most Great!” in the face of the exquisiteness that gilds beings and the subtle perfections 
that illuminate them, causes the heavens to ring out, and who, through the strains of the 
Qur’an, causes the universe to reverberate, and through his admiration and appreciation, 
his contemplation and display, and his mentioning of the Divine Names and affirmation 
of Divine unity, brings land and sea to ecstasy, is again self-evidently that one (PBUH). 

And so, according to the meaning of ‘the cause is like the doer,’ it is pure truth and 
sheer wisdom that the one in whose scales shall  be found the equivalent of all the good 
deeds performed  by his community, and whose spiritual perfections draw strength  from 
the benedictions of all his community, and who, as a result of the duties he discharged in 
his messengership, received immaterial recompense and boundless emanations of Divine 
mercy and love, should advance by the stairway of the Ascension as far as Paradise, the 
Lote-tree of the farthest limit, the Divine Throne, and the distance of two bow-lengths. 

Your  Second  Difficulty:  O  you  who  is  listening!  This  second  truth  that  you  make 
difficult is so profound and exalted that the mind can neither rise to it nor draw close to it. 
It may be seen only with the light of belief. However, the fact that this truth exists may be 
brought close to the understanding by means of allegory and comparison. In which case, 
we shall attempt to do that to some small degree. 

Thus, when the universe is considered from the point of view of wisdom,  

 

606 

it  is  seen  to  bear  the  meaning  of  a  mighty  tree. For  just  as  a  tree  has  branches,  leaves, 
blossom and fruit, so in this lower world, which is one part of the tree of creation, there 
are  elements,  which  are  like  its  branches;  plants  and  trees,  which  are  like  its  leaves; 
animals, which are like its flowers; and man, which is like the fruit. 

Furthermore, the Divine Name of  All-Wise requires that a  law of that All-Glorious 
Maker  which  is  in  force  in  trees  generally  will  also  be  in  force  in  the  mighty  tree  of 
creation. Since this is so, wisdom requires that the tree of creation also be formed from a 
seed, and such a seed that contains the essentials  and principles of other worlds  besides 
the  corporeal  world.  For  the  fundamental  and  original  seed  of  the  universe,  which 
comprises thousands of different worlds, cannot be a scrap of desiccated matter. 

Since before the tree of the universe there was no tree of the same kind, it is also a 
requirement of the Name of All-Wise that meaning and light, which are like a source and 
seed to it, should be clothed with the garment of a fruit on the tree of the universe. For a 
seed cannot remain permanently unclothed. And since at the beginning of creation it was 
not clothed in the garment of a fruit, it would surely be clothed in it at the end. And since 
that fruit is mankind; and since, as was proved above, the most famous fruit and sublime 
result from among mankind, who attracted the attention of all and confined to himself the 
gaze of a fifth of mankind, and with his moral and spiritual qualities caused the world to 
consider  him  with  either  feelings  of  love  or  of  wonder,  is  the  Person  of  Muhammad 
(Peace and blessings be upon him), most certainly, light, which was the seed from which 
the universe was formed, would become clothed in corporeality in his person and would 
appear in the form of an ultimate fruit. 

O  listener!  Do  not  consider  it  improbable  that  this  strange  and  mighty  universe  is 
created from the particular essence of a human being! Why should the All-Powerful One 
of Glory, Who creates a huge pine-tree –a sort of world– from a seed the size of a grain 
of wheat, not create the universe from ‘the Light of Muhammad’ (Peace and blessings be 
upon him)?16 Why should He not be able to do so? 

Since,  like  the  Tree  of  Tuba,  the  tree of  the  universe  has  its  roots  and  trunk  above 
and branches below, there is a luminous connecting line from the level of the fruit below 
to that of the original seed. Thus, the Ascension is the sheath and form of that connecting 
line,  the  way  of  which  Muhammad  (Peace  and  blessings  by  upon  him)  opened  up.  He 
went through his sainthood, returned through his messengership, and left the door open. 
The saints of his community following after him, travel that luminous highway with the 
heart and spirit in the shadow of the Prophet’s Ascension, and according to their abilities, 
rise to elevated ranks.

607 

Also,  as  was  proved  above,  the  universe’s  Maker  made  it  and  decked  it  out  in  the 
form  of  a  palace  for  the  aims  demonstrated  in  the  answer  to the  First  Difficulty.  Since 
Muhammad (PBUH) was the means of all those aims being realized, he must have been 
regarded with  favour by the universe’s Maker before the universe was created, he  must 
have  been  the  first  recipient  of  His  manifestation.  For  the  result  and  fruit  of  a  thing  is 
considered  first.  That  is  to  say,  material  existence  comes  last  and  meaning  comes  first. 
However, since Muhammad (PBUH) was both the most perfect fruit, and the means of all 
other fruits acquiring value, and the means of all the aims becoming manifest, his Light 
must have received the first manifestation of creativity. 

Your Third Difficulty: This is so extensive that those like us with straitened minds 

cannot contain and comprehend it. However, we can look at it from afar. 

Yes,  the  immaterial  workshops  and  universal  laws  of  the  lower  world  are  in  the 
higher worlds. And the fruits of the actions of jinn and men and the results of the actions 
of all the innumerable creatures on the earth, which is an exhibition of works of art, are 
also represented in the higher worlds. Moreover, a great many signs and the testimony of 
many narrations show that good deeds will take on the form of the fruits of Paradise and 
bad  deeds  the  form  of  the  bitter  food  of  Hell.  The  wisdom  in  creation  and  the  Divine 
Name of All-Wise necessitate this and the All-Wise Qur’an indicates it. 

For sure, the multiplicity on the face of the earth is so widespread and the creation so 
ramified that its species of creatures and classes of beings are far more numerous than all 
the beings dispersed throughout the universe. In a state of constant change, they ever fill 
the  earth  and  are  emptied  from  it.  Thus,  the  sources  and  mines  of  this  multiplicity  and 
these particulars are universal laws and universal manifestations of the Divine Names. 

Those  universal  laws  and  universal,  all-encompassing  manifestations  of  the  Names 
are to some extent sheer and undifferentiated and each forms a heaven which is like the 
Throne and ceiling of a world and its centre of direction. One of those worlds is Paradise, 
the Garden of the Abode at the Lote-tree of the farthest limit. It is established by accounts 
given by the Bringer of Sure News (PBUH) that the praise and glorification on the earth 
takes on the form of the fruits of that Paradise.17 Thus, these three points demonstrate that 
the treasuries of the results and fruits produced on the earth are there, in the heavens, and 
that the crops and produce of those results and fruits also return there. 

Do not say: “How can it be that my words ‘All praise be to God!’, which are formed 

only of air, should become a corporeal fruit of Paradise?”,  

                                                

17 Kanz al-‘Ummal, i, 459-60; Manzari, al-Targhib wa’l-Tarhib, ii, 422-3. 

 

608 

because, sometimes while dreaming you eat in the form of a delicious apple a good word 
you uttered during the day while awake. And sometimes you eat at night in the form of 
something  bitter, an ugly word  you uttered during the day. If  you slander and  backbite, 
you are made to eat it in the form of putrid flesh. In which case, the good words and ugly 
words you say in the sleep of this world, you will eat in the form of fruits in the world of 
the  hereafter,  which  is  the  world  of  consciousness.  You  should  not  consider  it  unlikely 
that you will eat them. 

Fourth Principle 

What are the fruits and benefits of the Ascension? 

The Answer: We shall mention only five, by way of example, of the more than five 

hundred fruits of the Ascension, which has the meaning of the Tree of Tuba. 

FIRST FRUIT 

This  fruit  has  brought to the  universe  and  mankind  a  treasury,  a  gift  of  pre-eternal 
and post-eternal Light, which is to see with the eyes the truths of the pillars of belief and 
to behold the angels, Paradise, the hereafter, and even the All-Glorious One. It raises the 
universe  from  an  imaginary  state  of  wretchedness,  transitoriness,  and  disorder  and, 
through that Light and fruit, shows its reality, which is its consisting of sacred missives of 
the Eternally Besought One and being a beautiful mirror to the beauty of Divine oneness. 
It has made happy and pleased the universe and all conscious beings. 

Furthermore,  through  this  Light  and  sacred  fruit,  it  shows  that  man  is  not  merely 
bewildered,  wretched,  impotent,  impoverished,  with  endless  needs  and  innumerable 
enemies,  ephemeral  and  impermanent,  which  is  like  the  state  of  misguidance;  it  shows 
man  in  his true form of  being a  miracle of the Eternally Besought One’s power on ‘the 
most  excellent  of  patterns,’  a  comprehensive  copy  of  the  Eternally  Besought  One’s 
missives,  an  addressee  of  the  Pre-Eternal  and  Post-Eternal  Monarch,  the  special 
bondsman, the admirer and friend of His perfections, the lover bewildered at His beauty, 
and a beloved guest appointed to eternal Paradise. It has filled all human beings who are 
true human beings with infinite joy and infinite longing. 

SECOND FRUIT 

This fruit has brought to jinn and man as a gift the fundamentals of Islam, and first 
and  foremost  the  prescribed  prayers,18  which  constitute  those  things  pleasing  to  the 
Sustainer, the Ruler of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, Who is  

                                                

18 Bayhaqi, Dala’il al-Nubuwwa, iii, 406; al-Sunna al-Kubra, iv, 362. 

 

609 

the Maker of beings, Owner of the universe, and Sustainer of all the worlds. To discover 
the things that please Him brings such happiness it cannot be described. For how eager is 
everyone  to  find  out,  from  a  distance,  the  desires  of  a  powerful  benefactor or  generous 
king, and if they find out, how delighted they are. They say longingly: “If only there was 
some means by which I could communicate with that personage directly. If only I could 
learn what he wants of me. If only I knew what would please him that I could do.” 

Man,  then,  should  understand  just  how  necessary  it  is  to  be  desirous  and  eager  to 
discover the wishes and pleasure of the  Ruler of  Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity.  For all 
beings  are  in  the  grasp  of  His  power,  and  the  beauty  and  perfections  to  be  found  in  all 
beings are but pale shadows in relation to His beauty and perfection, and being needy for 
Him in innumerable ways, man constantly receives countless numbers of His bounties. 

Thus,  as  a  direct  fruit  of  the  Ascension,  Muhammad  (PBUH)  heard  with  utter 
certainty  what  it  is  that  pleases  the  Monarch  of  Pre-Eternity  and  Post-Eternity,  behind 
seventy thousand veils, and returning, brought it as a gift to mankind. 

Indeed, how curious is man to learn the conditions on the moon. If someone was to 
go there and return bringing news of it, both what self-sacrifice he would display, and, if 
he  was  to  understand  the  conditions  there,  how  he  would  be  overcome  by  wonder  and 
curiosity. But the moon is merely touring in the domain of a Lord of such dominion that 
it encircles the globe of the earth like a fly, and the globe flies round the sun like a moth, 
while the sun is one lamp among thousands and is just a candle in a guest-house of that 
Glorious Lord of All Dominion. 

Thus, Muhammad (PBUH) saw the works and wonders of art and treasuries of mercy 
in the everlasting realm of this All-Glorious One, and he returned and informed mankind. 
And so, if mankind does not listen to him with complete wonder, curiosity, and love, you 
can understand how contrary to reason and wisdom is their attitude. 

THIRD FRUIT 

Muhammad  (PBUH)  saw  the  treasury  of  eternal  happiness,  obtained  the  key,  and 
brought it as a gift to jinn and men. Yes, through the Ascension, he saw Paradise with his 
own  eyes  and  witnessed  the  eternal  manifestations  of  the  All-Glorious  and  Merciful 
One’s  mercy;  he  understood  eternal  happiness  with  absolute  and  utter  certainty  and 
brought as a gift to jinn and men the good news of its existence. 

If wretched jinn and men imagine themselves and all beings to be in the soul-searing 
situation  of  an  unstable  world  amid  the  upheavals  of  decease  and  separation,  being 
poured with the flood of time and motion of particles  

 

610 

into  the  oceans  of  non-existence  and  eternal  separation,  it  cannot  be  described  how 
precious and enheartening such good news is in the ears of ephemeral jinn and men, who 
thus supposed themselves to be condemned to eternal annihilation. If, at the moment he is 
to  be  executed  and  sent  to  non-existence,  a  man  is  pardoned  and  given  a  palace  in 
proximity to the king, what great joy this would cause him. So, gather up all such joy and 
happiness to the number of jinn and men and then evaluate this good news. 

FOURTH FRUIT 

Just as he himself sampled the fruit of the vision of Divine beauty, so did he bring to 
jinn and men the gift of this fruit being attainable by all believers. You may understand 
from the following how delightful, pleasing, and exquisite a fruit this is. 

Everyone  of  fine  perception  loves  one  who  possesses  beauty  and  perfection  and  is 
benevolent, and his love increases proportionately to their degrees; it reaches the degree 
of  worship  and  a  pitch  whereat  he  would  sacrifice  his  very  life.  On  seeing  that  person 
only once, his  love becomes  such he would  sacrifice the world. However,  in relation to 
the  beauty,  perfection,  and  benevolence  of  God  Almighty,  the  beauty,  perfection  and 
benevolence of all  beings are not the equivalent of even a few tiny sparks  in relation to 
the sun. That is to say, if you are a true human being, you may understand how delightful 
and fine a fruit it is and what happiness and joy it brings to receive in eternal happiness 
the  vision  of  the  All-Glorious  One  of  Perfection,  Who  is  worthy  of  boundless  love, 
infinite longing, and being gazed upon eternally. 

FIFTH FRUIT 

Man’s being the precious fruit of the universe and the petted beloved of the Maker of 
the universe was understood through the Ascension, and he brought this fruit to jinn and 
men.  This  fruit  raises  man,  an  insignificant  creature,  a  weak  animal,  an  impotent 
conscious being, to an elevated rank of pride above all the beings in the universe. It gives 
man indescribable pleasure and joyful happiness. For if it  is said to an ordinary private: 
“You  have  been  promoted to the  rank  of  field  marshal,”  how  delighted  he  will  be.  But 
wretched  man  is  an  ephemeral,  impotent  ‘rational  animal’  who  constantly  suffers  the 
blows of decease and separation. If then he is told that not only will he make excursions 
and  tours  with  the  speed  of  imagination  and  breadth  of  the  spirit  in  an  eternal  never-
ending Paradise within the mercy of an All-Compassionate and Generous Merciful One, 
and journey  in the mind in accordance with all the desires of his heart in both the outer 
dimensions of things and those dimensions that look directly to their Creator, but that he 
will also behold the vision of Divine beauty in eternal happiness, you can imagine what a 
profound  joy  and  true  happiness  a  human  being  who  has  not  fallen  from  the  level  of 
humanity would feel in his heart. 

 

611 

Now we say to our listener: Tear off the shirt of atheism and throw it away! Listen 
with  believing  ears!  Look  with  Muslim  eyes!  We  shall  show  you  through  two  short 
comparisons the great value in one or two further fruits. 

For example,  you and I are together  in a certain  country. We  see that everything  is 
hostile to us and to each other, and is strange to us. Everywhere is full of ghastly corpses. 
The sounds to be heard are the weeping of orphans and the lamentations of the oppressed. 
So if someone appears when we are in that situation bringing good news from the king of 
the  country  by  which  those  of  his  subjects  who  were  strange  to  us  assume  the  form  of 
friends  and  the  enemies  turn  into  brothers,  and  the  ghastly  corpses  are  seen  to  be 
worshipping  and  praising  and  glorifying  in  deep  humility  and  submission;  and  if  the 
piteous weeping becomes praise and exaltation and cries of “Long live the king!”, and the 
deaths  and  plunder  and  pillage  are  transformed  into  demobilizations  and  release  from 
duty;  and  if  we  join  the  general  joy  to our own  joy,  you  will  certainly  understand  how 
joyful and happy that news is. 

Thus, when the beings in the universe are considered with the eye of misguidance, as 
they  were  before the  light of  belief, which  is one  fruit of the  Ascension of Muhammad 
(PBUH), they are seen to be strange, menacing, troublesome, dreadful, terrifying corpses 
the  size  of  mountains,  while  the  appointed  hour  is  severing  people’s  heads  and  casting 
them  into the pit of eternal,  never-ending  nothingness.  Although  misguidance  interprets 
all the  voices as  being  lamentations occasioned  by separation and decease, the truths of 
the pillars of  belief, which  are  fruits of the  Ascension, show  you that just as beings are 
brothers  and  friends  to  you  and  praisers  and  glorifiers  of  the  All-Glorious  One,  so  are 
death and decease a demobilization and discharge from duties; in reality those voices are 
all glorifications of God. If  you wish to study this truth in  its entirety,  you may refer to 
the Second and Eighth Words. 

The Second Comparison:  You and I are in a place resembling a vast desert. There 
is a sand-storm in the sea of sand and the night is so black we cannot see even our hands. 
If suddenly, without without friend or protector, hungry and thirsty, we were despairing 
and giving up hope, a person was to pass through the curtain of blackness and approach 
us bringing a car as a gift; and if he was to seat us in it, and then instantly install us in a 
place  like  Paradise  where  our  future  was  secure,  food  and  drink  ready  prepared,  and 
where we had a most kindly and sympathetic protector, you can understand how pleased 
we would be. 

Thus, that great desert is the  face of this world.  The  sea of  sand  consists of  beings 

and wretched man, who are tossed around by the force of the flood  

 

612 

of time and the  motion of particles within  events. All  human  beings see the  future with 
the eye of  misguidance, enveloped  in terrifying darkness, and their  hearts are  harrowed 
with  anxiety.  They  know  no  one  they  can  make  hear  their  cries  for  help.  They  are 
infinitely hungry, infinitely thirsty. 

However, when this world is seen in terms of things pleasing to God, which is a fruit 
of  the  Ascension;  that  is,  it  is  seen  to  be  the  guest-house  of  Someone  exceedingly 
generous, and human beings are seen to His guests and officials, and the future to be as 
delightful  as  Paradise,  as  sweet  as  mercy,  as  shining  as  eternal  happiness,  you  will 
understand what a delightful, exquisitely sweet fruit it is. 

At this point, the one who  is  listening  says:  “Never-ending praise and thanks  be to 
Almighty God, for I have been saved from atheism and now affirm Divine unity. I have 
attained a complete belief, I have gained perfect belief.” 

And  we  say:  “Brother!  We  congratulate  you.  May  Almighty  God  allow  us  the 

intercession of His Most Noble Messenger (Peace and blessings be upon him). AMEN.” 

O  God!  Grant  blessings  to  him  at  whose  sign  the  moon  split,  and  from  whose 
fingers  water  flowed  forth  like  the  spring  of  Kawthar,  the  one  who  made  the 
Ascension and whose eye did not waver, our master Muhammad, and to all his 
Family and Companions, from the beginning of the world to the end of the Great 
Gathering. 

All  glory  be  unto  to  You!  We  have  no  knowledge  save  that  which  You  have 
taught us; indeed, You are All-Knowing, All-Wise!19 

O  our  Sustainer!  Accept  this  from  us;  for,  indeed,  You  are  All-Hearing,  All-
Knowing!20 * O our Sustainer! Do not take us to task if we forget or unwittingly 
do  wrong!21  *  O  our  Sustainer!  Let  not  our  hearts  swerve  from  the  truth  after 
You have guided us!22 * O our Sustainer! Perfect our light for us and grant us 
forgiveness; for, indeed, You are Powerful over all things!23 * And their call will 
close with, ‘All praise is due to God, the Sustainer of all the worlds.’24

Addendum to the 
Nineteenth Letter and Thirty-First Word 

About the Miracle of 
the Splitting of the Moon 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
The Hour is nigh, and the moon is split. * But if they see a sign, they turn away, 
and say: “This is evident magic.”1 

Philosophers and their unreasoning imitators, who want to eclipse with their vicious 
delusions  the  Splitting  of  the  Moon,  which  is  a  miracle  of  Muhammad  (PBUH)  that 
shines like the moon, say: “If the Splitting of the Moon had occurred, it would have been 
known  to  the  whole  world  and  would  have  been  related  throughout  the  subsequent 
history of man.” 

The  Answer:  Since  the  Splitting  of  the  Moon  was  demonstrated  as  an  evidence  of 
prophethood,  and  happened  instantaneously,  at  night  when  people  were  asleep,  and 
before a gathering who, although they witnessed  such an evidence, denied  it; and  since 
there  were  obstacles  hindering  the  sighting  of  it  such  as  mist,  clouds,  and  time-
differences  between  different  parts  of  the  world;  and  since  at  that  time  science  and 
civilization were not widespread, and observation of the skies was very limited, and the 
event  itself  was  exceptional,  there  was,  therefore,  nothing  to  necessitate  that  it  should 
have been seen all over the world and passed into the general histories. For now, listen to 
Five Points out of many that will scatter those clouds of delusion concerning the Splitting 
of the Moon.  

                                                

1 Qur’an, 54:1-2. 

 

614 

FIRST POINT 

The extreme stubbornness of the unbelievers there at that time is well-known and is 
recorded  in  history.  And  yet,  when  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  announced  this  event  to  the 
whole world through saying: 

And the moon is split, 

not  one  of  those  unbelievers,  who  denied  the  Qur’an,  spoke  up  to  give  the  lie  to  this 
verse; that  is, not one of them denied the  event  it was announcing. If the event had  not 
been considered as a definite fact by the unbelievers at that time, they would have taken 
the  verse  as  a  pretext,  denied  it  in  a  most  fearsome  manner,  and  tried  to  attack  and 
overthrow Muhammad’s (PBUH) claim to prophethood. However, the biographies of the 
Prophet and histories mentioning the event relate nothing to suggest that the unbelievers 
denied it. The only thing that history relates is, as the verse: 

And [they] say, “This is evident magic,” 

points out, the unbelievers who saw the event declared it to be magic, and said that if the 
caravans  in other places  had seen  it,  it was true, otherwise  he  had  bewitched them. The 
caravans  arriving  the  following  morning  from  the  Yemen  and  other  places  announced 
that they had seen such a happening. So the unbelievers then said of the Pride of All the 
Worlds  (PBUH)  that,  God  forbid,  the  magic  of  Abu  Talib’s  orphan  had  affected  the 
heavens.2 

SECOND POINT 

The  majority  of  the  most  illustrious  scholars,  like  Sa’d  al-Din  Taftazani,  declared 
that like the Prophet had satisfied the thirst of a whole army with water flowing from his 
fingers,  and  the  whole  congregation  had  heard  a  dry  wooden  post  against  which 
Muhammad  (PBUH)  had  leant  while  delivering  the  sermon  weep  on  being  separated 
from him, the Splitting of the Moon, too, was mutawatir,3 that is, had been transmitted by 
numerous authorities. That  is to say, these  events had  been passed down  from group to 
group  forming  such  a  vast  congregation  that  a  conspiracy  to  lie  would  have  been 
impossible. Like the appearance of the famous Haley’s Comet a thousand years ago had 
been unanimously reported, and the existence of the island of Ceylon was certain due to 
unanimous reports, although we had not seen it. 

And so, it is unreasonable to foster baseless doubts in such certain,  

                                                

2 Ibn Hajar, Fath al-Bari, vii, 145; Bayhaqi, Dala’il al-Nubuwwa, ii, 266, 268. 
3 Bukhari, ii, 251; v, 62; vi, 178; al-Hakim, al-Mustadrak, ii, 472; Suyuti, Nazm al-Mutanathir fi’l-

Hadith al-Mutawatir, 135; Bayhaqi, Dala’il, i, 279-81. 

 

615 

witnessed  matters. It is enough that they are  not impossible. And  as  for the Splitting of 
the Moon, it is quite as possible as a mountain’s splitting with a volcanic eruption. 

THIRD POINT 

Miracles are for proving claims to prophethood and for convincing those who deny 
those claims, they  are not for compelling people to believe. Therefore, miracles have to 
be  manifested  to  those  who  hear  claims  to  prophethood  at  a  degree  that  will  persuade 
them. Just as it would be contrary to the All-Wise and Glorious One’s wisdom to display 
them  all  over  the  world  or  in  so  self-evident  a  manner  that  all  would  be  compelled  to 
believe,  so  would  it  also  be  contrary  to  the  mystery  of  man’s  accountability.  For  this 
accountability  requires  “opening  the  door to the  reason  and  not removing  the  power of 
choice.” If the All-Wise Creator had left the moon split for one or two hours in order to 
show it to the whole world as the philosophers wished, and it had been recorded in all the 
general histories of man, then it would have been like all other occurrences in the heavens 
and would not have been an evidence to Muhammad’s (PBUH) claim to prophethood nor 
been special to his messengership. Or else it would have been such a self-evident miracle 
that it would have negated the power of choice, a part of man’s reason, compelling it to 
accept  it;  willy-nilly,  it  would  have  had  to  assent  to  his  prophethood.  Someone  with  a 
coal-like spirit  like Abu Jahl would have remained at the same  level as someone with a 
diamond-like  spirit  like  Abu  Bakr  the  Veracious;  the  mystery  of  man’s  accountability 
would  have  been  lost.  It  was  due  to this  mystery  that,  being  both  instantaneous,  and  at 
nighttime,  and  at  a  time  of  sleep,  and  time  differences,  mist,  and  cloud  and  other 
obstacles  concealing  it,  it  was  not  shown  to  the  whole  world  and  did  not  pass  into  the 
histories. 

FOURTH POINT 

Since  this  event  occurred  instantaneously  at  night  while  everyone  was  sleeping,  of 
course it was not seen all over the world. Even if some people had seen it, they would not 
have believed their eyes. And even if it had made them believe, such a significant event 
would  not  have  become  a  permanent  source  for  future  histories  through  isolated 
individual reports. 

In some books it is written that after the moon split into two halves, it fell to earth, 
but veracious scholars have rejected such additions, saying that they were perhaps added 
by dissemblers with the intention of reducing to nothing the value of this evident miracle.  

 

616 

And,  for  example,  just  as  the  same  time  in  England  and  Spain,  which  were  then 
enveloped in mists of ignorance, would have been just after sunset, in America daytime, 
and  in  China  and  Japan  morning,  so  too  in  other  places  there  would  have  been  other 
obstacles  preventing  it  being  seen.  Now  consider  these  unreasoning  objectors  who  say 
that the  histories  of  peoples  like  the  English,  Chinese,  Japanese,  and  Americans  do  not 
mention it, and that therefore it did not occur. A thousand curses be on the heads of those 
who toady to Europe and repeat such things. 

FIFTH POINT 

The  Splitting  of  the  Moon  happened  neither  of  its  own  accord  in  consequence  of 
certain causes, nor as a result of chance, nor was it a natural event that occurred through 
the ordinary laws of nature. Rather, the All-Wise Creator of the Sun and the Moon caused 
it  to  happen  as  something  out  of  the  ordinary  in  order  to  confirm  His  Messenger’s 
messengership and to illuminate his claim. 

As the mystery of guidance, the mystery of human accountability, and the wisdom of 
messengership  required,  it  was  demonstrated  as  a  convincing  proof  to  certain  people 
specified by dominical wisdom. The mystery of wisdom required that it was not shown to 
people  in  every  region  of  the  world,  who  had  not  yet  heard  of  Muhammad’s  (PBUH) 
claim  to  prophethood.  Numerous  obstacles  prevented  them,  therefore,  such  as  mist, 
cloud, and time-differences, and the  fact that in some countries the  moon had not risen, 
and in others the sun had risen, while in others it was morning, and in yet others the sun 
had just set. 

If it had been shown to all and sundry, it would have been shown as a result of the 
Sign  of  Muhammad  (PBUH),  and  a  miracle  of  prophethood,  in  which  case  his 
messengership would have been so manifest that everyone would have been compelled to 
affirm it. No choice would have remained for the reason. And belief is attained through 
man’s power of choice and his reason. The mystery of human accountability would have 
gone  for nothing. And  if  it had been shown  merely as an occurrence  in the  heavens,  its 
connection with Muhammad’s (PBUH)  messengership would  have  been  severed, and  it 
would have retained no peculiarity to him. 

To  Conclude:    There  is  no  longer  any  doubt  concerning  the  possibility  that  the 
Splitting of the Moon occurred; it has been proved decisively. And now we shall mention 
six4  of the many evidences pointing to its occurrence. 

                                                

4 That is to say, there are six proofs concerning the event in the form of a sixfold consensus. 

Unfortunately, the explanation of them is brief, although they deserve more. 

 

617 

The concurrence of the Companions of the Prophet, who were all men of justice, on 

Their  agreement  in  expounding  the  verse,  And  the  moon  is  split  of  all  exacting

commentators on the Qur’an. 

The  fact  that,  relying  on  numerous  different  chains  of  authorities  and  lines  of 
transmission,  all  the  scholars  of  the  Prophetic  Hadiths  and  transmitters  of  the  sound 
narrations narrated the event.5 

The testimony of all the saints and the veracious, those who receive inspiration, and

The  confirmation  of  learned  scholars  and  theologians,  whose  ways  differ  greatly

on an established principle, never agrees upon error.6 

These six evidences prove the Splitting of the Moon as clearly as the sun. 

from one another. 

CONCLUSION 

Up to here this Addendum has been in the name of establishing the truth, and for the 
sake of silencing those enemies who deny it. Its concluding sentences will now be in the 
name of the truth and for the sake of belief. Indeed, establishing the truth spoke as above, 
now the truth speaks. 

The Seal of the Office of Prophethood, who was  the  luminous  moon of  its  heaven, 
proved his sainthood through his Ascension. This was the greatest wonder and supreme 
miracle  of  sainthood,  achieved  through  his  worship,  which  was  so  elevated  as  to  make 
him  God’s  beloved.  That  is  to  say,  by  travelling  with  his  earthly  body  through  the 
heavens, his superiority and his being God’s beloved were demonstrated to the dwellers 
of  the  heavens  and  inhabitants  of  the  lofty  worlds.  So too, through  the  moon,  which  is 
bound to the earth and suspended in the heavens, being split into two halves at the sign of 
an inhabitant of the earth, a miracle indicating to that earth-dweller’s messengership was 
displayed to the other inhabitants of the earth. Thus, the person of Muhammad (PBUH) 
flew to the very summit of perfections on the two luminous wings of messengership and 
sainthood  –  like  the  two  luminous  unfolded  wings  of  the  moon;  he  ascended  to  the 
distance of two bow-lengths; he became the cause of pride of both the inhabitants of the 
heavens and the inhabitants of the earth....

The Thirty-Second Word 

 [This Word consists of three Stopping-Places. It is an addendum explaining the 
Eighth Flash of the Twenty-Second Word, and is also a commentary on the first 
of  the  fifty-five  tongues  with  which  all  the  beings  in  the  universe  testify  to 
Divine unity. These tongues have been alluded to in my treatise called Katre (A 
Droplet). It is one truth, which has been clothed in the garment of comparison, 
of  many  truths  pertaining  to  the  verse:  Had  there  been  in  heaven  or  on  earth 
any deities other than God, there surely would have been confusion in both.1] 

First Stopping-Place 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
Had there been in heaven or on earth any deities other than God, there surely 
would have been confusion in both. 
There is no god but God, He is One, He has no partner; His is the dominion and 
His is the praise; He grants life and deals death, and is living and dies not; all 
good  is  in  His  hand;  He  is  powerful  over  all  things;  and  with  Him  all  things 
have their end. 

One night in Ramadan, I said that the above sentence affirming Divine unity consists 
of  eleven  phrases,  and  that  in  each  of  them  is  a  degree  expressing  that  unity  and  some 
good news. But of those degrees I only discussed the meaning and significance of He has 
no  partner,  and  that  was  in  the  manner  of  an  allegorical  conversation  and  imaginary 
debate  that  would  be  accessible  to  ordinary  people.  I  am  now  writing  down  that 
conversation at the request and desire of my much-valued brothers who assist me and my 
friends from the mosque. It is as follows. 

Let us suppose one person represents all those things set up as partners to God that 

all the different varieties of idolators imagine to exist. These  

                                                

1 Qur’an, 21:22. 

 

620 

idolators are the people of unbelief and misguidance, who worship nature and causes, for 
example,  and  assign  partners  to  God.  The  fictitious  person  wants  to  have  mastery  over 
one of the beings in the universe, and so claims to be its true owner. 

Firstly,  that  maker  of  false  claims  encountered  a  particle,  which  is  the  smallest  of 
those beings, and he spoke to it in the language of Naturalism and philosophy saying that 
he was to be its master and true owner. But the particle replied to him with the tongue of 
truth and dominical wisdom, saying: 

“I perform innumerable duties. Entering many creatures which are all different I do 
my work in them. And there are, from among countless particles like me, those that move 
from place to place2 and work with me. If you have the knowledge and power to employ 
me in all those duties, and the authority and ability to employ and have at your command 
all  those  others  as  well,  and  if  you  are  able  to  be  the  true  owner  of  and  to  have  total 
control over the beings of which I become a part in complete order, for example, over red 
blood-corpuscles, then you can claim to be master over me and ascribe me to something 
other than God Almighty. But if you cannot do all these things, be silent! 

“And in the same way that you cannot have mastery over me, you cannot interfere in 
any  way.  For there  is  such  complete orderliness  in  our  duties  and  motion  that one  who 
does not have infinite wisdom and all-encompassing knowledge cannot meddle with us. 
If he did, it would cause chaos. However, a person like you who is thick, impotent, and 
unseeing,  and  is  in  the  clutches  of  blind  chance  and  nature,  could  not  even  begin  to 
stretch out a finger to interfere.” 

So,  just  like  the  Materialists,  the  one  making  these  claims  said:  “In  that  case,  own 
yourself.  Why  do  you  say  you  are  working  on  someone  else’s  account?”  To  which  the 
particle replied:  

“If  I  had  a  brain  like  the  sun,  and  all-embracing  knowledge  like  its  light,  and  all-
encompassing power like its heat, and comprehensive senses like the seven colours in its 
light, and if I had a face that looked to all the places in which I travel and all the beings in 
which I work, and an eye that looked to them and words that carried authority with them, 
then perhaps I would  

                                                

2 Indeed, every object which is in motion, from minute particles to the planets, displays on itself the 

stamp of ‘eternal besoughtedness’ and unity. Also, by reason of its movement, each of them takes 
possession of all the places in which it travels in the name of unity, thus including them in the property of 
its owner. As for those creatures that are not in motion, they are each of them, from plants to the fixed stars, 
like a seal of unity showing the place in which it is situated to be the missive of its Maker. That is to say, all 
flowers and fruits are stamps and seals of unity which demonstrate, in the name of unity, that their habitats 
and native places are the missives of their Maker. In short, through their motion all things take possession 
of all things in the name of unity. That is, one who does not have all the stars within his grasp cannot have 
mastery over a single particle. 

 

621 

indulge in foolishness like you and claim to own myself. Get out! Go away! You won’t 
get anything out of me!” 

So, when the representative of those things held to be God’s partners despaired of the 
particle,  he  hoped  to  pursue  the  matter  with  a  red  blood-corpuscle.  And  coming  across 
one he said to it on behalf of causes and in the language of nature and philosophy: “I am 
your master and owner.” And the red corpuscle replied to him through the tongue of truth 
and Divine wisdom: 

“I am  not alone. If  you are able to own all  my  fellows  in the army of  blood whose 
stamp,  nature  as  officials,  and  order  is  the  same,  and  if  you  have  subtle  wisdom  and 
mighty  power  enough  to  own  all  the  cells  of  the  body  in  which  we  travel  and  are 
employed  with  perfect  wisdom,  and  if  you  can  demonstrate  this  to  be  the  case,  then 
perhaps some meaning might be found in your claim. 

“But someone stupified like yourself cannot be owner with your only support being 
deaf  nature and  blind  force;  indeed,  you are unable to  interfere  in  so  much as an atom. 
For the order with which we function is so perfect that only one who sees, hears, knows, 
and does everything can have authority over us.” And saying: “So, be silent! My duty is 
so important and the order so perfect that I have no time to answer garbled rubbish such 
as yours,” it repelled him.  

Then, since he was unable to mislead it, the representative left and next came across 
the little house known as a cell of the body. He said to it in the language of philosophy 
and nature: “I could not persuade the particle and red corpuscle but perhaps you will be 
reasonable. Since  you  have  been  made of several substances  just  like  a  minute  house, I 
am able to make you. You will be my artefact and true property.” The cell responded to 
him through the tongue of wisdom and truth, saying: 

“I am only  a  minute  little thing but I have  very  important duties and  very  sensitive 
relations; I am connected to the body as a whole as well as to all its cells. For example, I 
perform  complex  and  faultless  duties  in  the  veins,  and  in  regard  to  the  arteries,  the 
sensory and motor nerves, the powers of attraction and repulsion and procreation, and the 
imaginative faculty. If you have the knowledge and power to form, arrange, and employ 
the  whole  body  and  all  its  blood-vessels,  nerves  and  faculties,  and  if  you  have 
comprehensive wisdom and penetrating power with which to control all the body’s cells, 
which are like me, as regards qualities and artistry we are brothers, demonstrate it. Only 
then can you claim to be able to make me. If you cannot, then off with you! 

“The  red  corpuscles  bring  my  food,  while  the  white  ones  combat  illnesses  which 
attack me. I have work to do, do not distract me! Anyway, an impotent, lifeless, deaf and 
blind thing like you cannot in any way interfere with  

 

622 

us.  For  we  have  such  an  exact,  subtle  and  faultless  order3  that  if  the  one  who  has 
authority  over  us  was  not  Absolutely  Wise,  Absolutely  Powerful  and  Absolutely 
Knowing, our order would be broken and our regularity spoilt.” 

Then the one  making the  claims despaired of  it, too. He encountered the body of a 
human  being  and  said  to  it,  once  again  as  the  Naturalists  say,  in  the  language  of  blind 
nature and aimless philosophy: “You are mine, it is I who made you; or anyway I have a 
share  in  you.”  The  human  body  answered  with  the  tongue  of  reality  and  wisdom  and 
through the eloquence of its order: 

“If  you possess the power and knowledge to have actual  control over the  bodies of 
all  human  beings, who are the same as  me and on  whose  faces are the stamp of power 
and  seal  of  creation  which  are  the  same,  and  if  you  have  the  wealth  and  jurisdiction  to 
own, from water and air to plants and animals, the treasuries of my sustenance, and if you 
have  infinite  power  and  boundless  wisdom  with  which  to  employ  me  with  perfect 
wisdom and cause me to perform my worship, and the power and wisdom to lodge in a 
narrow, lowly  

                                                

3 The All-Wise Maker has created the human body as though it was a well-arranged city. A number of 
the blood-vessels perform the duties of telephones and telegraphs, while others of them are like pipes from 
a fountain through which blood, which is the water of life, flows. As for blood, created within it are two 
sorts of corpuscles. One of them, known as red corpuscles, distributes nutrients to the cells of the body; it 
conveys sustenance to the cells according to a Divine law. (Like merchants and food officials.) The other 
sort are white corpuscles, which are fewer in number than the former. Their duty, like soldiers, is defence 
against enemies, such as illness. Whenever they undertake that defence, with their two revolutions like 
Mevlevi dervishes, they take on a swift and wonderful state. As for blood as a whole, it has two general 
duties; the first is to repair damage done to the body’s cells and the second is to collect any waste-matter 
from the cells and to clean the body. There are two sorts of blood-vessels, veins and arteries. One of these 
carry purified blood, they are the channels through which clean blood is conveyed. The others are the 
channels for the turbid blood which collects the waste-matter; these convey the blood to where breathing 
occurs; that is, the lungs. 

The All-Wise Maker created in the air two elements, nitrogen and oxygen. As for oxygen, when it 
comes into contact with the blood in breathing, it draws to itself, like amber, the impure element, carbon, 
which is polluting the blood. The two combine and are transformed into matter called carbonic acid gas. 
Oxygen also maintains the body temperature, and purifies the blood. This is because, in the science of 
chemistry, the All-Wise Maker bestowed on oxygen and carbon an intense relationship, which might be 
described as ‘chemical passion’, whereby, according to this Divine law, when those two elements come 
close to each other, they combine. It has been established by science that heat is produced by combining, 
because it is a sort of combustion. 

The wisdom in this is as follows: the motion of the particles of those two elements is different. On 
combining, the particles of one element unite with those of the other, each two particles thereafter moving 
with a single motion. One motion remains suspended, because before combining there were two motions; 
now two particles have become one. Each pair of particles has acquired a motion like a single particle. The 
other motion is transformed into heat according to a law of the All-Wise Maker. As a matter of a fact, 
‘motion produces heat’ is an established principle.  

Thus, as a consequence of this fact, by this chemical combination, as carbon is removed from the blood 

the body temperature of human beings is maintained and at the same time the blood is purified. On 
inhaling, oxygen both cleanses the body’s water of life and kindles the fire of life. On exhaling, it yields, in 
the mouth, the fruit of words, which are miracles of Divine Power. 

GLORY BE UNTO HIM AT WHOSE ART THE MIND IS BEWILDERED.

vessel  like  me  immaterial  and  subtle  faculties  like  the  spirit,  heart,  and  intellect,  which 
are extremely vast and exalted and for which I am merely the sheath, then demonstrate all 
these and afterwards say that you made me. Otherwise, be silent! 

“Moreover,  according  to  the  testimony  of  the  perfect  order  in  my  body  and  the 
indication of the stamp of unity on my face, my Maker is One Who is powerful over all 
things,  knows  all  things,  and  sees  and  hears  all  things.  Someone  aimless  and  impotent 
like you cannot meddle in His art. You cannot interfere in so much as an atom.” 

The representative of the things imagined to be God’s partners could find no way in 
which to interfere in the body so he went off. Next, he encountered the human race and 
said to himself “This is a disorganized and unruly group. Perhaps, like Satan interferes in 
their individual and social actions which they perform through the exercise of their wills, 
I’ll  be able to find some way to interfere  in the  functioning of their bodies and  natures. 
And then, finding some way, I’ll be able to exercise control over the body and the body’s 
cell which sent me packing.” 

So, he said to the human race, once again in the language of deaf nature and aimless 
philosophy: “You seem to be to be in great confusion. I am your master and owner, or at 
least I partly own you.” To which the human race answered through the tongue of truth 
and reality, wisdom and order:  

“If you possess the power and wisdom to make the shirt that clothes the whole globe 
of the earth and is woven and sewn with perfect wisdom from the multicoloured threads 
of all the hundreds of thousands of animal and plant species, of which we are one, and to 
make  the  carpet  which  is  spread  over  the  face  of  the  earth  and  is  woven  from  the 
hundreds of thousands of species of animate  beings and  is  created  in an  extremely  fine 
and ornamented  fashion, and to continuously renew and refurbish  it, and  if  you possess 
comprehensive power and  all-embracing wisdom  with which to have  free disposal over 
the globe of the earth of which we are the fruit, and over the universe of which we are the 
seed,  and  to  send  us  our  vital  necessities  from  all  the  regions  of  the  cosmos  with  the 
balance of wisdom, and if you have the ability to create all those like us who have gone 
before  us  and  those  who  will  come  after  us,  on  whose  faces  the  stamp  of  power  is  the 
same, then, perhaps, you can claim to have mastery over me. 

“But if  you cannot, be silent! Do not say that, seeing confusion  in  my species,  you 
will be able to interfere in some way, because the order is faultless. The conditions you 
imagine to be confused and disorderly are transcribed with perfect order according to the 
book  of  power  and  Divine  Determining.  For  the  perfect  order  in  animals  and  plants, 
which are far inferior to us and are under our supervision, demonstrates that this seeming 
disorder in us is but a sort of writing. 

 

624 

“Is it at all possible that the one who artistically positions one thread running through 
a whole carpet should be other than the master designer of the carpet; or that the one who 
creates a fruit should be other than the creator of the tree that bore it; or that the one who 
creates the seed should be other than the fashioner of the being that produced the seed? 

“Also  your  eyes  are  blind:  you  do  not  see  the  miracles  of  power  on  my  face,  the 
wonders  of  creation  in  my  being.  If  you  did  see  them,  you  would  understand  that  my 
Maker is such that nothing at all can withstand Him or be difficult for Him. The stars are 
as easy for Him as particles. He creates the spring with as much ease as a flower. He is 
One Who includes the index of the vast universe in my being with perfect order. Could a 
lifeless, impotent, blind and deaf thing like you interfere in any way in the art of such a 
Being? So, be silent!” And saying: “Off with you! Go away!”, he drove him away. 

Next the one making these claims went and addressed the broad carpet covering the 
face of the earth and the lavishly decorated and embroidered shirt clothing it on behalf of 
causes and in the language of nature and philosophy, claiming: “I can have control over 
you and be your owner, or at least have a share in you.” So the shirt, the carpet,4 said to 
him on behalf of truth and reality and through the tongue of wisdom: 

“If  you  have  the  power  and  art  to  weave  and  create  all  the  well-ordered  and 
purposeful  shirts  and  carpets,  whose  embroideries  are  all  different,  which  have  clothed 
the  earth  to  the  number  of  years  and  centuries,  then  have  been  removed  in  an  orderly 
fashion and  strung on the  line of past time,  and  will clothe the earth again, carpets and 
shirts  whose  programmes  and  forms  have  been  drawn  and  specified  in  the  sphere  of 
Divine Determining, and which will be attached to the ribbon of future time, and if you 
have two wise and powerful hands with which to reach from the creation of the world to 
its destruction, indeed, from pre-eternity to post-eternity, and if you have the wisdom and 
ability  to  create  every  one  of  all  my  threads  and  to  repair  and  renew  them  with  perfect 
order and wisdom, and if you are able to hold in your hand and create the globe, which is 
our model and is wearing us, making us its veil and outer garment, then you can claim to 
have mastery over me. If you cannot, then away with you! There is no place for you here! 
“Moreover,  there  is  on  us  such  a  stamp  of  unity  and  seal  of  oneness  that  one  who 
does not have the whole universe within the grasp of  his power, and who cannot see at 
one time all things with all their functions, and cannot do innumerable things at the same 
time, who is not all-present and all-seeing everywhere, who is not unconfined by space, 
and  who  does  not  possess  infinite  wisdom,  knowledge,  and  power,  such  a  one  cannot 
own us, neither could he interfere.” 

                                                

4 In fact, the carpet is both living and vibrates in a regular fashion. Its embroideries are being 

continuously replaced with perfect wisdom and order in order to display the ever-differing manifestations 
of the Weaver’s Names. 

 

625 

So the representative went off, saying: “Perhaps I will be able to persuade the globe 
of the earth and find something going for me there.” So he went and said to the globe,5 
once again on behalf of causes and in the language of nature: “Since you travel in such an 
aimless  manner,  you  demonstrate  that  you  have  no  owner.  In  which  case,  you  can  be 
mine.” To which the earth replied in a thunderous voice, in the name of truth and with the 
tongue of reality:  

“Do not talk such utter nonsense! How could I be just aimless and without an owner? 
Have you found my garments or even the tiniest point or thread in them to be in disarray, 
without order, and have  you seen them to be without wisdom, purpose and  art that you 
tell me I am ownerless and aimless? 

“If you can really own my vast orbit round which I travel in one year, a distance that 
should  take  approximately  twenty-five  thousand  years,6  where  I  perform  my  duty  of 
service with perfect balance and wisdom, and own the ten planets, which are my brothers 
and  are  charged  with  duties  like  myself,  together  with  the  space  through  which  they 
travel, and if you have infinite wisdom and power with which to create and position the 
sun,  which  is  our  leader  and  to  which  we  are  bound  and  attached  by  a  compassionate 
attraction, and to fasten me and the other planets to it like stones in a sling, and to employ 
us  and  cause  us  to  revolve  with  perfect  order  and  wisdom,  then  you  can  claim  to  have 
mastery over me. But if you cannot, get out! Go to Hell! I’ve got work to do, my duty to 
perform. 

“Moreover, our magnificent order, awesome movement, and purposeful subjugation 
demonstrate that our Master is such that all beings from minute particles to the stars and 
galaxies are obedient and subjugated to him like soldiers under orders. He is an All-Wise 
Possessor of Glory, a Possessor of Absolute Sovereignty Who arrays the sun with planets 
as easily as He arrays and ornaments a tree with its fruit.” 

Since the claimer could find nothing for himself on the earth, he went off and said to 
himself about the sun:  “This a  huge great thing. Perhaps I’ll  be able to find a  hole  in  it 
and open up a way in; then maybe I’ll be able to subjugate it as well as the earth.” So he 
said to the sun, as the fire-worshippers  

                                                

5 In short, the particle referred the claimer to the red corpuscle. The red corpuscle referred him to the 
cell and the cell referred him to the human body; the human body to the human race and the human race to 
the earth’s shirt, which is woven from all the species of animate creatures. The earth’s shirt referred him to 
the globe of the earth, which in turn referred him to the sun. And the sun referred him to all the stars. Each 
one of them said; “Go away! If you are able to take possession of the next one up from me, do so, then 
come and try to be my master. If you are unable to defeat it, then you are unable to get possession of me.” 
That is to say, one whose authority does not extend to all the stars cannot make a single particle heed his 
claim to mastery. 

6 If half the diameter of a circle is approximately one hundred and eighty million kilometres, the circle 

covers approximately a twenty-five thousand year distance. 

 

626 

speak,  in  the  name  of  idolatry  and  in  the  language  of  the  philosophy  that  is  the 
mouthpiece  of  the  Devil:  “You  are  a  ruler,  you  own  yourself;  you  dispose  of  matters 
freely,  as  you  wish.”  But  the  sun  replied  to  him  in  the  name  of  truth  and  through  the 
tongue of reality and Divine wisdom, saying:  

“God forbid! A hundred thousand times, God forbid! I am a subservient official. I am 
a candelabrum in my Lord’s guest-house. I am not the true owner of a fly, or even of a 
fly’s  wing.  For  in  the  fly’s  being  there  are  immaterial  jewels  and  antique  works  of  art, 
like eyes and ears, such as are not in my shop. They are outside the sphere of my power,” 
thus reprimanding him. 

So  the  one  making  the  claims  changed  his  approach  and  said  with  the  tongue  of 
devilish philosophy:  “Since  you do not own  yourself,  you are a servant; I claim  you on 
behalf of causes.” To which the sun replied, speaking  for truth and reality and with the 
tongue of worship:  

“I  can  only  belong  to  one  who  is  able  to  create  all  the  lofty  stars,  which  are  my 
fellows,  to  place  them  in  the  heavens  with  faultless  wisdom,  make  them  revolve  with 
utter magnificence and to adorn them with exquisite finery.” 

Next the claimer said to himself: “The stars are a great multitude, and they seem to 
be all scattered and in disorder. Perhaps I will be able to gain something out of them on 
behalf of  my clients.” So he went  in among them and said to them on  behalf of causes 
and those things ascribed to God as partners, in the language of rebellious philosophy and 
as  the  Sabean  star-worshippers  said:  “Since  you  are  so  scattered,  you  are  all  under  the 
jurisdiction of different rulers.” To which one star replied, speaking for all the others: 

“Just how stunned, brainless, stupid and blind you are not to see and understand the 
stamp  of  unity  and  seal  of  oneness  on  us,  and  not  to  recognize  our  lofty  order  and 
regularity and the laws of our worship. You imagine us to be without order. But we are 
the works of art and servants of a Single and Unique One Who holds in the grasp of His 
power the heavens, which are our seas, the cosmos, which is our tree, and infinite space, 
which is where we make our excursions. 

“We  are  like  electric  illuminations  and  resplendent  witnesses  displaying  the 
perfection of His dominicality. We are radiant proofs proclaiming the sovereignty of His 
dominicality. With all our different sorts, we are luminous servants in the domain of His 
sovereignty  which  give  light  and  display  the  majesty  of  that  sovereignty  in  the  lofty 
dwellings and  in the  lowly ones,  in the dwellings of this world, the Intermediate World 
and the hereafter. 

“Indeed,  each  of  us  is  a  miracle  of  the  Single  and  Unique  One’s  power,  a  well-
ordered fruit of the tree of creation, an illuminated proof of unity; each of us is a dwelling 
place, aeroplane and mosque for the angels, and a lamp and sun for the lofty worlds, and 
a witness to the sovereignty of dominicality; and each of us is an ornament, palace, and 
flower of space, and a shining  

 

627 

fish in the heavenly seas, and a beautiful eye in the face of the sky.7 

“Furthermore,  throughout  us  as  a  whole  there  is  a  silence  within  tranquillity,  a 
motion within wisdom, an adornment within  majesty, a beauty of creation within order, 
and a perfection of art within symmetry. 

“And although we are thus and proclaim our Glorious Maker and His unity, oneness, 
eternal  besoughtedness,  and  His  attributes  of  beauty,  glory  and  perfection  to the  whole 
universe with  innumerable tongues,  you still accuse us utterly pure, clean, obedient and 
subservient servants of being confused, disorderly, and without duties, and even of being 
without an owner. You therefore deserve a truly punishing slap.” 

And  one  star,  like  the  stone  hurled  at  Satan,  delivered  such  a  mighty  slap  at  the 
claimer’s face that it flung him from the stars to the very pit of Hell. And it cast nature,8 
which was together with him, into the valleys of delusion, and chance into the chasm of 
non-existence,  and  those  things  ascribed  to  God  as  partners  into  the  darkness  of 
impossibility, and the philosophy that is hostile to religion down to the lowest of the low. 
All the stars recited this sacred decree together with that star: 

Had  there  been  in  heaven  or  earth  any  deities  other  than  God,  there  surely 
would have been confusion in both.9 

And they proclaimed:  “There  is  nothing,  from a  fly’s wing to the  lamps  in the  heavens, 
nothing, even the size of a fly’s wing, in which those things ascribed to God as partners 
could interfere.” 

Glory be unto You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught us; 
indeed, You are All-Knowing, All-Wise!10 

O God! Grant blessings and peace to our master Muhammad, the Lamp of Your 
Unity in the multiplicity of Your  creatures, and the Herald of Your Oneness in 
the exhibition of Your creation, and to all his Family and Companions. 

                                                

7 This means, we are indications observing and contemplating the wonders of God Almighty’s creation 
and causing others to contemplate them. That is, just as the heavens are seen to be observing the wonders of 
Divine art on the earth with countless eyes, so like the angels in the skies, the stars watch the earth, which 
is an exhibition of wonders and marvels, and they cause conscious creatures to observe it with attention. 

8 But after its fall, nature repented. It understood that its true duty was not to act and to have an effect, 
but to accept and be passive. And it recognized that it was a sort of notebook of Divine Determining, but a 
notebook capable of change and transformation; that it was a sort of programme of dominical power, was 
similar to the body of the rules of creation laid down by the All-Powerful One of Glory, and was a 
collection of His laws. It assumed its duty of worship with perfect submission acknowledging its utter 
impotence, and thus acquired the title of Divine creation and dominical art.

628 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
Look, then, to the signs of God’s mercy, how He 
restores to life the earth after its death.11 

The  following  section12  alludes  to  one  flower  from  the  pre-eternal  garden  of  the 

above verse. 

It is as if all the blossoming trees are beautifully composed odes speaking poetically 

through the tongue of disposition reciting the manifest praises of the Glorious Creator. 

Or, it is as if all the blossoming trees have opened thousands of gazing eyes and have 
caused thousands of others to open in order to behold, not with one or two eyes but with 
thousands,  the  Glorious  Fashioner’s  wonders  of  art  which  are  being  broadcast  and 
exhibited, and so that attentive people will gaze on them, too. 

Or,  it  is  as  if  all  the  blossoming  trees  have  beautified  their  verdant  limbs  with  the 
finest adornment for the moment of their parade and for their own particular festivals in 
the general festival of spring, so that their Glorious Monarch will contemplate the gifts, 
subtle wonders, and resplendent works of art He has bestowed upon them; and so that He 
will present to creation’s gaze the bejewelled instances of His mercy, in springtime, and 
on  the  face  of  the  earth,  which  is  the  exhibition  of  Divine  art;  and  so  that  He  will 
proclaim to mankind the wisdom in the creation of the tree. 

He  demonstrates  the  perfection  of  Divine  power  through  showing  what  important 
treasure hangs on their delicate branches and what significant wealth there is in the fruits 
of His merciful bounties.  

The imagination sees heavenly angels embodied from these trees 

With thousands of flutes. 

From these flutes the consciousness hears 
The praises of the Ever-Living One. 

Their leaves have tongues, each reciting the word: It is He! It is He! 

Meaning, 

O Ever-Living One! O Ever-Living One! 
Since all things chant in unison: There is no god but He, 
And they are seeking Truth, 
From beginning to end they recite: O Ever-Living One! 
They are chanting in unison: O God! 
And We send down from the skies water rich in blessings.13

A Short Addendum 
to the First Stopping-Place 

Listen to the verse: 

Do they not look at the sky above them? How We have made it and adorned  it, 
and there are no flaws in it?14 

Then look at the face of the heavens, you see how it is silent in its tranquillity; 
how  it  is  in  motion  with  wisdom,  how  it  is  radiant  with  majesty,  how  it  smiles 
with its adornment. An unending and infinite sovereignty is proclaimed to those 
who think by the order in its creation, by the symmetry in its art, by its shining 
lamps, its brilliant lanterns, its glittering stars. 

Do they not look at the sky above them? How We have made it and adorned it, 
and there are no flaws in it? 

The following explains the above passage, Then look at the face of the heavens, etc., 

which in turn is an explanation of the verse quoted. 

Firstly, the phrase: How it is silent in its tranquillity. 

The verse directs an attentive gaze to the beautifully adorned face of the heavens so 
that the one  beholding  it  may  become aware of the  silence there which  is within  a  vast 
tranquillity,  and  so  that  he  may  understand  that  it  is  thus  through  the  command  and 
subjugation of One Possessing Absolute Power. 

For  if  they  had  been  independent  and  unrestrained,  those  huge  globes,  all  in  close 
proximity  to  each  other,  those  infinite,  awesome  heavenly  bodies,  would  have  caused 
such an uproar with their enormously swift revolutions that they would have deafened the 
cosmos. And there would have been such confusion in that tumultuous commotion that it 
would  have  scattered  the  universe.  It  is  well-known  what  a  commotion  and  uproar  it 
causes  if twenty water-buffalo work on top of each other. Whereas, we know that there 
are among the stars some which are thousands of times  larger than the earth and which 
revolve at a speed seventy times faster than that of a cannon-ball. So the degree of power 
and  subjugation  of  the  Glorious  Maker  and  All-Powerful  One  of  Perfection  may  be 
understood from this, together with the degree of obedience and submission to Him of the 
stars. 

                                                

14 Qur’an, 50:6. 

 

630 

Secondly, the phrase: How it is in motion with wisdom. 

The  verse  commands us to look at the  motion on the  face of the  heavens, which  is 
with wisdom and purpose. Indeed, that mighty, wondrous motion occurs within a precise 
and comprehensive wisdom. 

For  example,  a  craftsman  who  operates  a  factory’s  machinery  with  wisdom  and 
purpose demonstrates the degree of his skill and craftsmanship in proportion to the order 
and  grandeur  of  the  factory.  Similarly,  when  we  look  at  it  in  this  way,  the  degree  of 
power and wisdom of the All-Powerful One of Glory become apparent to us through His 
making the mighty sun as a factory, and its planets, those awesome, immense globes, like 
the factory’s machinery, and His spinning and revolving them like stones in a sling. 

Thirdly, How it is radiant with majesty, how it smiles with its adornment. 

It  has  this  meaning:  the  radiant  majesty  and  smiling  adornment  on  the  face  of  the 
heavens are such that they demonstrate the sublimity of the Glorious Maker’s sovereignty 
and  exquisiteness  of  His  artistry.  As  the  myriad  electric  lamps  hung  about  on  festival 
days demonstrate the degree of the king’s majesty and achievement in material progress, 
the vast heavens, too, with their majestic and adorned stars demonstrate to attentive gazes 
the sublime sovereignty and exquisite artistry of the Glorious Maker. 

Fourthly, By the order in its creation, by the symmetry in its art. 

This phrase says the  following:  look at the order of the creatures on the face of the 
heavens and see their symmetry and precise balance, then understand just how powerful 
and wise is their Maker. 

Indeed,  the  vast  heavens  demonstrate the  degree  of  power  and  wisdom  of  the  One 
Who  transforms  various  and  tiny  creatures  or  animals,  thus  preparing  them  for  their 
duties,  and  Who  impels  each  of  them  on  a  determined  way  by  means  of  its  particular 
balance,  and  the  degree  of  their  obedience  and  subjugation  to  Him.  Similarly,  the  vast 
heavens demonstrate to attentive gazes through their awesome vastness and innumerable 
stars, and the stars, through their imposing hugeness and speedy revolutions and the fact 
that they do not exceed their bounds by an iota, even for a second, or neglect their duties 
for  a  tenth  of  a  second,  the  exceedingly  fine  and  particular  balance  with  which  the 
Glorious Maker carries out His dominicality. 

Fifthly, An unending and infinite sovereignty is proclaimed to those who think by its 
shining lamps, its brilliant lanterns, its glittering stars. 

This phrase states clearly what is alluded to in the above verse, and in many similar 
to it, which mention the subjugation of the sun, moon, and stars. That is to say, to attach 
the heat and  light-giving  lamp of the sun to the embellished  ceiling of the skies, and to 
make it the ink-pot for writing the missives of the Eternally Besought One in lines of day 
and night on the  

 

631 

pages of summer and winter; and to make the moon, like the hour-hands which shines on 
the  large  clocks  on  minarets  and  towers,  an  hour-hand  of  time’s  mighty  clock  on  the 
dome of the heavens, and to make it move through its mansions with precise balance and 
perfect measure in the form of many varying crescents so that it leaves one crescent one 
night and then  later returns to collect  it; and to adorn the beautiful  face of the  sky with 
stars  that  twinkle  and  smile  in  the  dome  of  the  heavens,  all  these  are  signs  of  the 
unlimited  sovereignty  of  a  sustaining  dominicality.  They  are  indications  of  a  majestic 
Divinity which makes Itself known to conscious creatures. They invite those who think to 
believe and to affirm Divine unity. 

Look upon the coloured page of the book of the universe; 
See what forms the golden pen of power has traced. 
No dark point remains for the gaze of the heart’s eye; 
It is as if God as inscribed His signs with light. 
Look! What a miracle of wisdom is the amazing universe! 
Look! What a wondrous spectacle is the vastness of space! 
Then listen to the stars, listen to their harmonious address! 
See what wisdom has emblazed on the decree of its light. 
Altogether they start to speak with the tongue of truth, 
They address the majesty of the All-Powerful, All-Glorious One’s sovereignty: 
We are each of us light-scattering proofs of the existence of our Maker, 
We are witnesses both to His unity and His power, 
We are subtle miracles 
gilding the face of the skies for the angels to gaze upon. 
We are the innumerable attentive eyes of the heavens 
which watch the earth, which study Paradise. 
We are the innumerable exquisite fruits 
which the hand of wisdom of the All-Glorious and Beauteous One 
has fastened 
To the celestial portion of the tree of creation, 
to all the branches of the Milky Way. 
For the inhabitants of the heavens, 
we are each of us a travelling mosque, a spinning house, a lofty home, 
Each is an illumining lamp, a mighty ship, an aeroplane. 
We are each of us a miracle of power, a wonder of creative art 
Created by the Powerful One of Perfection, the All-Wise One of Glory; 
A rarity of His wisdom, a marvel of His creation, a world of light. 
We demonstrated to mankind innumerable proofs, 

 

632 

We made them hear with these innumerable tongues of ours; 
But their accursed unseeing, unbelieving eyes did not see our faces, 
They did not hear our words. 
And we are signs that speak the truth: 
Our stamp is one, our seal is one, 

We are mastered by our Sustainer; 
We glorify Him through our subjugation; 
We recite His Names; 
We are each of us in ecstasy, 
A member of the mighty circle of the Milky Way. 

 

633 

Second Stopping-Place 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
Say: He is God, the One and Only. God, the Eternally Besought One.15 

This Stopping-Place consists of three Aims. 

THE FIRST AIM 

The  representative  of  the  people  of  misguidance  and  those  who  assign  partners  to 
God fell to earth at the slap  he received  from a  star, as was described at the end of the 
First Stopping-Place. So, because he could find nothing going for him anywhere from the 
particles  to the  stars,  he  gave  up  laying  claim  to them  in  that  way  and  instead  tried  by 
means  of  three  important  questions  to  induce  doubts  in  believers’  minds  about  Divine 
unity and oneness. 

The  First  Question:  He  said  in  the  manner  of  the  atheists:  “O  you  who  believe  in 
One God! Looking on behalf of my clients, I could find nothing, nor get anything at all 
out of the  beings  in the universe; I could  not substantiate  my claims. But then,  how do 
you prove the existence of One Who is Single and Unique and possesses infinite power? 
Why do you not think it possible for others to interfere and to share in His power?” 

The Answer: It is decisively proved in the Twenty-Second Word that every creature, 
every  particle,  every  star,  is  an  illuminating  argument  for  the  Necessarily  Existent  and 
Absolutely  Powerful  One.  Every  link  in  the  chains  of  beings  in  the  universe  is  a  clear 
evidence for His unity. The All-Wise Qur’an proves this with its innumerable proofs, and 
mentions  most frequently those proofs that are clearest in the  view of people generally. 
For example: 

If  you  ask  them,  who  is  it  that  created  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  they  will 
certainly say, “God.”16 

And  among  His  signs  is  the  creation  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  and  the 
variations in your languages and colours.17 

With these and many verses like them, the All-Wise Qur’an presents the  

                                                

15 Qur’an, 112:1-2. 
16 Qur’an, 31:25; 39:38. 
17 Qur’an, 30:22.

creation of the heavens and earth as self-evident proofs of Divine unity. And so, whether 
they  like  it or not, because of the way the heavens and earth have been created, anyone 
who is conscious and intelligent will be compelled to affirm the Glorious Creator. As the 
Qur’an says: They will certainly say, “God.”  

In the First Stopping-Place we started with a particle and demonstrated the stamp of 
unity  on  beings  as  far  as  the  stars  and  the  heavens.  With  verses  like  these  the  Qur’an 
repels  the  ascribing  of  partners  to  God  from  the  stars  and  heavens  down  to  particles.  It 
indicates this in the following way. 

The Possessor of Absolute Power Who creates the heavens and earth with such order 
and balance, of course creates the solar system, which is a region of it. The solar system 
is self-evidently within His controlling and directing grasp. 

Since that Absolutely Powerful One  holds the  sun and  its planets within His grasp, 
and  orders,  subjugates,  and  directs  them,  certainly  the  earth,  which  is  a  member  of  the 
solar  system  and  is  tied  to the  sun,  is  also  within  His  regulating  and  controlling  grasp. 
Since this  is so, the beings which are created and  inscribed on the face of the earth and 
are like its aims and fruits are also within His sustaining and perfecting grasp. 

And since all the creatures spread and scattered over the earth, which gild and adorn 
its face, are continuously renewed, coming and going, filling the earth and being emptied 
from it, they are all of them within the grasp of His knowledge and power; and since they 
are measured and ordered on the scales of justice and wisdom; and since all the species of 
animate  beings  are  within  the  grasp  of  His  power;  certainly,  all  the  well-ordered  and 
faultless  members  of  those  species,  which  are  like  miniature  specimens  of  the  cosmos, 
balance-sheets of  its species, and tiny  indexes of  the book of the universe,  must also be 
within His creating, sustaining, directing, and perfecting grasp. 

And since this is so, the cells, blood-corpuscles, limbs and muscles which comprise 
those animate creatures’ bodies are also self-evidently within the grasp of His knowledge 
and power. 

And since every cell and corpuscle is under His command and within His grasp, and 
since they are in motion according to His laws, surely the particles out of which they are 
formed  and  which  are  like  shuttles  weaving  the  embroideries  of  art  which  clothe  them, 
are also necessarily within the grasp of His power and the sphere of His knowledge. For 
they are in motion in orderly fashion faultlessly performing duties at His command, with 
His permission, and through His power. 

And since this is so, the identifying features and distinguishing marks to be found on 
everyone,  all  the  differences  in  faces,  voices  and  languages,  of  necessity  also  occur 
through His knowledge and wisdom. 

 

635 

So now look again at the verse which mentions and points out the beginning and end 

of this chain: 

And  among  His  signs  is  the  creation  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  and  the 
variations  in  your  languages  and  your  colours:  indeed,  in  that  are  signs  for 
those who know. 

We  therefore  now  say:  O  representative  of  the  unbelievers!  You  can  see,  these 
arguments  as  strong  as  the  chains  of  the  universe  prove  the  path  of  affirming  Divine 
unity,  and  they  demonstrate  a  Possessor  of  Absolute  Power.  Since  the  creation  of  the 
heavens and the earth demonstrates an All-Powerful Maker, and the infinite power of that 
All-Powerful  Maker,  and  that  His  infinite  power  is  at  the  point  of  infinite  perfection, 
there is an absolute lack of need for any partners. That is to say, He in no way needs any 
associates. 

Since He has no need, why do you take that dark path? Why is it you feel constrained 
to take it? Moreover, since both He, and beings, are in absolutely no need of partners, just 
as it is impossible for there to be any partners in His Divinity, so it is impossible for there 
to  be  any  in  His  creation  and  sustaining  of  beings.  Their  existence  is  impossible.  The 
reason for this is as follows: 

We proved that the power of the Maker of the heavens and the earth is both infinite 
and  at  the  point  of  infinite  perfection.  If  there  was  any  partner,  it  would  mean  that, 
although  His  power  is  infinite,  another  finite  power  would  threaten  and  overcome  His 
infinite  and  perfect  power  and  would  take  possession  of  a  certain  areas  of  it.  It  would 
then  be  necessary,  without  there  being  any  compulsion,  for  something  finite  to  make 
something infinite finite and limited, and for itself to become infinite for a time. This is a 
manifold and most irrational impossibility. 

Also, since there is no need for partners, and, since their existence is impossible, to 
claim otherwise is purely arbitrary. That is, since there is no cause that could induce such 
a  claim,  rationally  or  logically,  it  would  be  meaningless.  According  to  the  science  of 
jurisprudence, such a claim is designated ‘arbitrary’. That is, it is a meaningless ‘abstract 
claim’. 

A  principle  of  the  sciences  of  theology  and  jurisprudence  is  this,  that  a  probability 
not originating from any indication or sign has no importance; it cannot induce doubt in a 
matter that is definite. It cannot shake the certainty that is based on sound judgement. 

For example, it is possible that Barla or EÛridir Lake consists of grape-molasses or 
that it has been transformed into oil. But since that possibility does not originate from any 
indication,  it  does  not  affect  our  certain  knowledge,  or  induce  doubt  in  the  fact,  that  it 
consists of water. 

 

636 

Therefore, we questioned every sort of creature from every corner of the cosmos and 
whatever was questioned, from the particles to the stars in the First Stopping-Place, and 
from  the  creation  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth to the  individual  features  in  faces  in  the 
Second Stopping-Place, everything demonstrated through the tongue of its being the seal 
of unity; everything testified that God is One. 

You  saw  this  for  yourself.  There  is,  then,  nothing  in  any  of  the  creatures  in  the 
universe on which the possibility of God having any partners could be constructed. That 
is to say, since to claim that God does have partners is purely arbitrary and meaningless 
and is an ‘abstract claim’, it is pure ignorance and unqualified stupidity. 

Thus, nothing remained for the representative of the people of misguidance to say in 
the face of this. The only thing he could say was: “What indicates that God has partners is 
the configuration of causes in the cosmos. It is that everything is tied to a cause. So that 
means that causes have an actual effect, and if they have an effect, are not they able to be 
God’s partners?” 

The  Answer:  Effects  have  been  tied  to  causes  because  Divine  will  and  wisdom 
require them to be so, and so that great numbers of the Divine Names may be manifested. 
Everything has been tied to a cause, but we have decisively proved in numerous places, 
including  many  of  the  Words,  that  “causes  have  no  actual  power  with  which  to  create 
their effects.” So, for now we shall just say this: 

Among  causes  human  beings  are  self-evidently  the  most  superior,  and  have  the 
greatest power of choice and the most extensive ability to control and direct other causes. 
And among the most obvious of man’s actions over which he exercises choice are eating 
and  the  powers  of  speech  and  thought.  Furthermore,  all  these  faculties  are  extremely 
well-ordered, wonderful, and purposeful chains. But of the hundred links in these chains 
only one is subject to man’s power of choice. 

For  example,  in  the  chain  of  actions  concerning  food,  which  stretches  from  the 
nourishment of the body’s cells to the forming of fruit, only moving the jaw and chewing 
the  food  is  subject  to  man’s  choice.  And  in  the  chain  of  speech,  only  exhaling  air  and 
blowing it into the mould of articulated letters. And while a word in the mouth is a seed, 
it becomes like a tree; in the air it yields the fruits of millions of the same word and enters 
the  ears  of  listeners  along  with  millions  of  others.  Man’s  imagination  can  barely  reach 
this metaphorical shoot, so how should the short arm of choice reach it? 

Since among  causes  man  is the  most superior and has the greatest power of choice 
and  yet  his  hands  are  thus  tied  from  real  creation,  how  should  other  causes,  such  as 
inanimate  creatures,  animals,  the  elements,  and  nature  have  any  real  power  of  disposal 
over other causes? Each of those causes is  

 

637 

only  a  container;  a  cover  for  the  dominical  works;  a  tray-bearer  for  the  gifts  of  the 
Compassionate One.  

Of course, the receptable for a king’s gift, or the handkerchief in which it is wrapped, 
or  the  individual  who  brings  the  gift,  which  is  placed  in  his  hand,  can  in  no  way  be 
partners  in  the  king’s  sovereignty.  Anyone  who  supposes  that  they  are  partners  is 
imagining  nonsensical  absurdities. In the  same way, apparent causes and  intermediaries 
can  have  absolutely  no  share  in  God’s  sustaining  of  His  creatures.  Their  lot  is  only  to 
perform a service of worship. 

THE SECOND AIM 

The  representative  of  those  who  ascribe  partners  to  God  could  in  no  respect  prove 
that way, and so, although despairing, since he wanted to destroy the way of those who 
affirm  Divine  unity,  he  tried  to  sow  doubts  in  their  minds  by  asking  the  following 
question: 

The Second Question: “O you who affirm Divine unity! You say, ‘Say: He is God, 
the One and Only. God, the Eternally Besought One;’18 that the Creator of the universe is 
one,  He  is  single,  He  is  eternally  besought  by  all  creatures;  and  that  the  Creator  of 
everything is He. That He is one in essence and at the same time the reins of everything 
are  directly  in  His  hand,  the  key  to  everything  is  in  His  grasp;  one  thing  cannot  be  an 
obstacle  to  another.  And  you  say  that  at the  same  instant  He  has  total  disposal  over  all 
things and all their states. How can such a far-fetched fact be believed? How can a single 
individual be in innumerable places and do innumerable things at the same time with no 
difficulty?” 

The  Answer:  This  question  may  be  answered  through  explaining  an  extremely 
profound,  subtle,  elevated,  and  comprehensive  mystery  concerning  Divine  oneness  and 
eternal besoughtedness. Man’s mind can only look at this mystery through the telescope 
and observatory of comparison and allegory. While there is nothing similar or analogous 
to God Almighty’s Essence and attributes, the functions of His attributes may be looked 
at to an extent by  means of comparison and allegory. So we shall point to that mystery 
through comparisons of a material nature. 

First  Comparison:    As  is  proved  in  the  Sixteenth  Word,  a  single  individual  may 
attain  universality  or  comprehensiveness  through  the  means  of  different  mirrors.  While 
actually  being  a  particular  or  part  of  something  greater  than  itself,  it  is  as  though  it 
becomes a universal with numerous qualities and functions. 

Indeed, matter like glass and water may be a mirror to physical objects,  

                                                

18 Qur’an, 112:1-2. 

 

638 

and one such object may attain universality in such a mirror. In the same way, air, ether, 
and some creatures from the World of Similitudes are like mirrors to lucent objects and 
spirit beings. Those mirror-like creatures pass with the speed of lightning or imagination 
to being means of travel and spectating, so that the lucent and spirit beings travel with the 
speed of  imagination  in those spotless  mirrors, those subtle dwellings. In the space of  a 
single instant the spirit beings can enter thousands of places. And because they are lucent 
and because their reflections are the same as them and possess their qualities, they are as 
though  present  in  person  in  every  mirror,  everywhere,  as  is  contrary  to  the  case  with 
physical beings. 

The  reflections  and  likenesses  of  dense  corporeal  beings  are  not  identical  to  the 
corporeality of those beings; they do not possess their qualities and may be thought of as 
dead.  For  example,  although  the  sun  is  a  particular  and  a  single  individual,  it  becomes 
like a universal by means of shining objects. It reflects its image, a sun like itself, in all 
shining objects, drops of water, and fragments of glass on the face of the earth, according 
to their capacity. The sun’s heat, light, and the seven colours in its light, a sort of likeness 
of the essential sun, is found in all shining physical objects. 

Let us suppose the sun  had knowledge and consciousness, then every  mirror would 
be  like  a  sort  of  dwelling-place  or  seat  or  chair  for  it,  it  would  be  in  contact  with 
everything  in  person.  It  would  be  able  to  communicate  with  all  conscious  creatures  by 
means  of  mirrors,  with  the  pupil  of  every  eye,  even,  each  of  which  would  be  like  a 
telephone. One thing would not be an obstacle to another. Communicating with one thing 
would not be a barrier to communicating with another. While being present everywhere, 
it would be present nowhere. 

If the sun, which is like a material, partial, and inanimate mirror to only the Divine 
Name of LIGHT out of innumerable Names, can therefore display universal activity in an 
unlimited number of places while being a single individual, should the All-Glorious One, 
with the oneness of His Essence,  be unable to perform  innumerable actions at the same 
time? 

Second Comparison:  Since the cosmos is like a tree, all trees may be likened to the 
truths  of  the  universe.  So  we  shall  take  the  mighty  and  majestic  plane-tree  facing  this 
room as a miniature example of the universe and demonstrate with it the manifestation of 
Divine oneness in the universe. 

This tree has at least ten thousand fruits and each fruit has at least a hundred winged 
seeds. At one instant of time the ten thousand fruits and million seeds display altogether 
one art and creativity. While the centre of the laws of the tree’s formation is present in its 
roots and trunk, through a manifestation of Divine will and a condensing of the dominical 
command, which  may  be described as particular,  individuated, and a ‘knot’ of  life,  it  is 
also  

 

639 

present at the ends of all its branches, within every fruit and every seed. No part of any 
member of the tree is lacking the laws, they are not obstacles to one another; the tree is 
formed through them. 

And  that  single  manifestation  of  will  and  law  issuing  from  a  command  are  not 
transmitted and radiated like light, heat, and air. For they leave no trace nor may any hint 
of them be perceived in the long distances and various beings between the places they go. 
If their  being present  in all the  fruits and  seeds  had occurred through being transmitted 
and radiated, some trace or hint of them would be perceived. Rather, they are present in 
all those places without being fragmented or radiated. 

The  universal  and  general  actions  are  not  incompatible  with  His  oneness  and 
individuality.  It  may  even  be  said  that  while  the  manifestation  of  will,  and  the  law  and 
life-source are present in all the places, they are present in none of them. 

It  is  as  if  the  law  has  as  many  eyes  and  ears  as  there  are  fruits  and  seeds  of  the 
majestic tree. Yes, each part of the tree is  like a  centre of the senses of the  law, so that 
their long intermediaries are not a veil and do not form a barrier, but like telephone wires, 
are a means of facilitating and bringing things closer. The farthest is like the nearest. 

Since,  as  is  clear  from  observation,  through  a  single  partial  manifestation  of  an 
attribute of the Single and Eternally Besought One like will, millions of events occur in 
millions of places without intermediary, one has to be certain, completely certain, that the 
All-Glorious One can  have total disposal over the tree of the universe, together with all 
its parts and particles, through the manifestation of His power and will.  

As  is  proved  and  explained  in  the  Sixteenth  Word,  while  being  in  one  place  and 
being particulars identifiable as single, through the mystery of luminosity, impotent and 
subjugated  creatures  like  the  sun,  and  semi-luminous  creatures  like  spirit-beings,  which 
are restricted by matter, and the laws issuing from a command and the manifestations of 
will which are the life-source and centre of direction of this plane-tree, which in turn are 
like  its  light  and  spirit,  are  clearly  present  in  numerous  places  and  in  numerous  events. 
While  being  particulars  restricted  by  matter,  it  is  as  though  they  acquire  an  absolute 
universality,  and  through  the  exercise  of  will,  in  the  space  of  one  second  may 
demonstrably perform a great number of works. You see for yourself and you will not be 
able to deny it.  

The  Single  and  Most  Pure  and  Holy  Essence,  Whose  attributes  are  all-
comprehending and  functions, universal,  is  far  beyond and exalted above  matter, and  is 
utterly remote and free from any restriction and the darkness of density. All these  lights 
and luminous beings are but obscure shadows of His Sacred Names; and all existence and 
life and the World of Spirits, the  

 

640 

Intermediate  Realm,  and  the  World  of  Similitudes,  semi-transparent  mirrors  reflecting 
His beauty. 

What  being  can  be  hidden  in  the  face  of  His  oneness,  which  is  within  the 
manifestation  of  His  attributes  and  actions,  which  in  turn  are  evident  through  His 
universal  will,  absolute  power,  and  all-embracing  knowledge?  What  matter  can  be 
difficult  for  Him?  What  place  can  be  concealed  from  Him?  What  object  can  remain 
distant  from  Him?  What  individual  can  draw  close  to  Him  without  acquiring 
universality?  Can  anything  at  all  be  hidden  from  Him?  Can  any  matter  at  all  be  an 
obstacle to another? Can any place at all be empty of His presence? 

Ibn al-‘Abbas (May God be pleased with him) said: “In all beings are an immaterial 
eye that sees and ear that hears.” Is this not so? Are the chains of beings not each like a 
wire  or  vein  for  the  swift  conveyance  of  His  commands  and  laws?  Are  obstacles  and 
difficulties  not  means  and  intermediaries  in  His  disposal  of  beings?  Are  causes  and 
intermediaries not merely an apparent veil? 

While He is present nowhere, is He not present everywhere? Does He have any need 
to be located in a place or situation? Can the veils of distance, smallness, and the degrees 
of existence be obstacles to His proximity, power of disposal, and witnessing? 

Moreover,  could  the  qualities  pertaining  to  material,  contingent,  dense,  numerous, 
restricted,  and  limited  beings,  and  the  states  of  change,  transformation,  division,  and 
occupying space, which are their particular and confined necessary consequences, in any 
way  touch  the  Most  Pure  and  Holy  Essence,  Who  is  far  beyond  matter,  is  Necessarily 
Existent,  the  Light  of  Lights,  and  is  Single,  One,  and  free  from  any  restriction  or 
limitation and exalted above and pure of any fault or deficiency? Could impotence in any 
way be fitting for Him? Could any defect approach the skirt of His splendour and glory? 

Conclusion of the Second Aim 

Once, when I was reflecting on Divine oneness, I  looked at the  fruits on the plane-
tree outside my room. A chain of thought came to me as inspiration, and I write it here in 
Arabic exactly as it came to me.19 

All  these  fruits  and  the  seeds  within  them  are  miracles  of  dominical  wisdom, 
wonders of Divine art, gifts of Divine mercy, material proofs of Divine unity, bearers of 
the  good  news  that  Divine  favours  will  be  granted  in  the  hereafter.  Just  as  they  are  all 
truthful  witnesses to His all-embracing power and knowledge, each of them  is a  mirror 
confirming His unity in all the  

                                                

basis of the translation here. [Tr.] 

19 In the original text the author follows the section in Arabic with a Turkish rendering of  which is the 

 

641 

corners of the world of multiplicity and in all the parts of the world of this tree, a world 
that has become multiple. 

They turn the gaze from multiplicity to unity. Each of them says through the tongue 
of its being: “Do not let your glance wander over all this mighty spreading tree lest you 
become distracted, for the whole tree is within us. Its multiplicity is contained within our 
unity.” 

Even,  just  as  every  seed,  which  is  like  the  heart  of  the  fruit,  is  a  physical  mirror 
confirming  Divine  unity,  so  it  mentions  and  recites  in  the  silent  prayer  of  its  heart  the 
Divine Names the mighty tree recites in its audible prayer. 

Furthermore, just as the fruits and seeds are mirrors professing Divine unity, so they 
are  the  visible  signs  of  Divine  Determining  and  embodied  tokens  of  Divine  power. 
Through these words, Divine Determining and power intimate the following:  

“The  many  branches  and  twigs  of  this  tree  appeared  from  a  single  seed  and 
demonstrate  the  unity  of  the  tree’s  Artist  in  creating  it  and  giving  it  form.  Then,  after 
growing and spreading its branches, it gathered together all its truths in a single fruit. It 
encapsulated its entire meaning in a single seed, thereby demonstrating the wisdom in the 
Glorious Creator’s creation and planning.” 

Similarly,  the  tree of  the  universe  takes  its  existence  from  a  source  of  unity  and  is 
sustained  by  it.  And  man,  the  fruit  of  the  universe,  demonstrates  unity  within  this 
multiplicity  of  beings,  while  with  the  eye  of  faith  his  heart  sees  the  mystery  of  unity 
within multiplicity. 

Moreover, the fruits and seeds are allusions of dominical wisdom. Wisdom says the 
following  with  them  to  those  who  are  aware:  “The  comprehensive  regard  towards  this 
tree and its planning look with their comprehensiveness and universality to a single fruit. 
For the fruit is a miniature specimen of the tree. It is what is aimed at by the tree. Also, 
the comprehensive regard and planning  look to every seed within the  fruit,  for the seed 
bears the meaning or index of the whole tree. That is to say, since the fruit is the aim the 
tree’s existence and the purpose of its creation, the One Who plans the tree regards each 
fruit  with  all  His  Names  connected  to  the  planning.  Moreover,  the  mighty  tree  is 
sometimes  pruned  and  trimmed  for  the  sake  of  the  tiny  fruit;  some  parts  of  it  are 
destroyed so that it may make new growth. It is grafted in order to produce even better, 
permanent fruit.” 

In the same way, man, who is the fruit of the tree of the universe, is the purpose of its 
creation and existence and the aim of the creation of beings. While his heart, which is the 
seed of the fruit, is a most brilliant and comprehensive mirror to the universe’s Maker. It 
follows on from this wisdom,  

 

642 

therefore,  that  tiny  man  will  be  the  cause  of  the  destruction  and  transformation  of  the 
universe. He will be the point of momentous revolutions like the Day of Resurrection. It 
will  be  for  his  judgement  that  the  door  of  this  world  will  be  closed  and  that  of  the 
hereafter opened. 

Since we have arrived at a discussion of resurrection, it is appropriate to explain one 
point  concerning  its  reality  which  demonstrates  the  clarity  and  strength  with  which  the 
Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition illuminates and proves resurrection. 

The result yielded by this sequence of thought shows that if it is necessary for man’s 
judgement  and  his  gaining  eternal  happiness,  the  whole  universe  will  be  destroyed  and 
that a power capable of destroying and transforming the universe shows itself and exists. 
But resurrection has many degrees. It is obligatory to believe in some of them; they must 
be  acknowledged.  Whereas  others  become  apparent  according  to  levels  in  spiritual  and 
intellectual development, and for these knowledge pertaining to both are necessary. 

In  order  to  present  cogent  and  strong  proofs  for  the  simplest  and  easiest  level,  the 
All-Wise  Qur’an  points  out  a  power  capable  of  opening  up  a  truly  vast  realm  of 
resurrection. The degree of resurrection in which it is necessary for all to believe is this:  

After  human  beings  die,  their  spirits  depart  for  another  realm.  And  their  bodies  rot 
except for a  minute cell  from the  base of the  spine  which will act as a seed. It remains 
intact, and on the Day of Resurrection God Almighty will create the human body out of it 
and  return  its  spirit  to  it.20  This  degree  is  so  simple,  then,  it  may  be  seen  every  spring 
through millions of examples. 

Sometimes  in  order  to  prove  this  degree,  the  verses  of  the  Qur’an  point  out  the 
unlimited  activity  of  a  power  capable  of  raising  to  life  all  particles,  and  sometimes  the 
traces  of  a  power  and  wisdom  capable  of  sending  all  creatures  to  extinction  and  then 
recalling them. Then they point to the activity and traces of a power and wisdom able to 
scatter the stars and shatter the heavens, and sometimes to the activity and manifestations 
of a power and wisdom capable of causing all animate creatures to die and then raising 
them to life again all at once at a single trumpet-blast. 

Sometimes  the  verses  demonstrate  the  manifestations  of  a  power  and  wisdom  that 
will raise to life the face of the earth and animate creatures all separately. And sometimes 
they demonstrate the traces of a power and wisdom that, lopping off its mountains, will 
cause  the  globe  of  the  earth  to  disintegrate  completely,  and  then  restoring  it  will 
transform it into an even more excellent form. 

That  is  to  say,  apart  from  the  Day  of  Resurrection,  in  which  it  is  obligatory  for 

everyone to believe and to acknowledge, with that power and wisdom,

God Almighty can create numerous other degrees and resurrections. And what  is  more, 
dominical wisdom requires that besides certainly bringing about mankind’s resurrection, 
He shall bring about all those other degrees or create certain other important matters. 

A Question: You say: “You make much use of analogies in the form of comparisons 
or parables in the Words. Whereas according to the science of logic, this form of analogy 
does  not  afford  certainty.  A  logical  proof  is  required  for  matters of  certain  knowledge. 
Analogy  in  the  form  of  comparison  and  parable  is  utilized  by  scholars  of  canon  law  in 
matters  in  which  the  prevailing  opinion  is  sufficient.  Also,  you  present  comparisons  in 
the  form  of  certain  stories;  the  stories  are  imaginary  and  cannot  be  true.  Is  this  not 
contrary to reality?”  

The  Answer:  It  has  often  been  stated  in  the  science  of  logic  that  analogies  in  the 
form of comparisons and parables do not afford certain knowledge. However, there is a 
certain type of this form of analogy that forms a proof more powerful than those proofs 
consisting  of  certain  knowledge  used  in  logic.  Also,  it  is  more  certain  than  that  sort of 
deduction. This type of analogy is as follows. 

It  demonstrates  the  tip  of  a  universal  truth  by  means  of  a  partial  comparison  and 
constructs  its  judgement  on  that  truth.  It  demonstrates  the  truth’s  law  in  a  particular 
matter, so that the vast truth may be known and particular matters may be ascribed to it. 

For example, although the sun is a single being, by means of luminosity it is present 
in  every  shining  object.  A  law  of  a  truth  is  demonstrated  by  means  of  this  comparison 
which  states  that  light  and  luminosity  cannot  be  restricted:  for  them,  distance  and 
proximity are the same, many and few are equal, and space cannot conquer them. 

This  is  another example: a tree’s  fruits and  leaves are all shaped and  formed  at the 
same time, in the same fashion, easily and perfectly, in a single centre and through a law 
issuing  from  a  command.  This  is  a  comparison  or  parable  demonstrating  the  tip  of  a 
mighty truth and universal law. It proves the truth and the truth’s law in a truly decisive 
form, so that, like the tree, the mighty universe displays and  is the  field of operation of 
that law of truth and mystery of Divine oneness. 

Thus, the analogies, comparisons, and parables employed in all the Words are in this 
form  and  are  more  powerful  and  afford  more  certainty  than  the  categorical  proofs  of 
logic. 

Answer to the second part of the question:  It is a well-known fact that in the art of 
composition, when the true meaning of a word or phrase  is used solely as the  means to 
perceive another meaning, it is called an ‘allusive  

 

644 

expression.’ The essential  meaning of a phrase defined as  ‘allusive’  is  not the  means of 
either truth or falsehood; it is its allusive meaning that is such. If the allusive meaning is 
correct then the phrase is true. Even if its essential meaning is false, it does not damage 
its veracity. If the allusive meaning is not correct while its essential meaning is, then the 
phrase is false. 

For example,  “So-and-so’s  salvation  is of great  length.” That  is,  “His sword-belt  is 
very long.” This phrase alludes to the man’s tall stature. If he was tall but did not have a 
sword and belt, the phrase would still be correct and true. If he was not tall but had a long 
sword and belt, then the phrase would be false, since it is not its essential meaning that is 
intended. 

So,  the  stories  or  parables  in  the  Words,  like  for  example,  those  in  the  Tenth  and 
Twenty-Second  Words,  are  sorts  of  allusions.  The  truths  at  the  end  of  the  stories  are 
extremely  correct,  extremely  true  and  conformable  to  reality;  they  are  the  allusive 
meanings  of  the  stories.  Their  essential  meanings  are  comparisons  that  bring  distant 
objects close like a telescope and however they may be it does not damage their veracity 
and  truthfulness.  Moreover,  all  those  stories  are  comparisons  or  parables.  Purely  to 
enable people in general to understand, what is properly communicated without words is 
put into words, and immaterial and abstract matters are represented in material form. 

THIRD AIM 

After  receiving  this  decisive  and  convincing  answer  to  his  second  question,21  the 
representative of all the people of misguidance was reduced to silence, but then asked the 
following third question. 

“Phrases in the Qur’an like The Best of Creators,22 and The Most Compassionate of 
the Compassionate,23 suggest that there are other creators and compassionate ones. And 
you also say, ‘the Creator of all the worlds possesses endless perfections. United in Him 
are the utmost levels of every kind of perfection.’ Whereas, the perfections of beings are 
known  through  their  opposites:  if  there  was  no  pain,  pleasure  would  not  be  a  sort  of 
perfection;  if there was  no darkness,  light could  not be proved to exist;  if there was  no 
separation, there would be no pleasure in union, and so on, would there?” 

The Answer: We shall answer the first part of the question in five Indications. 
FIRST  INDICATION:    From  beginning  to  end,  the  Qur’an  demonstrates  Divine 

unity; this is a clear indication that those sort of phrases in the Qur’an  

21 That is, the question at the beginning of the Second Aim, not the small questions at the end of the 

                                                

Conclusion. 

22 Qur’an, 23:14, etc. 
23 Qur’an, 7:151, etc. 

 

645 

are  not  as  you  understand  them.  Rather,  The  Best  of  Creators  is  to  say,  “He  is  at  the 
highest  and  best  rank  of  creativity,”  which  in  no  way  indicates  that  there  is  another 
creator.  Like  the  other  attributes,  creativity  has  many  degrees  or  ranks.  The  Best  of 
Creators  means,  “He  is  a  Glorious  Creator  at the  furthest  and  most  excellent  degree  of 
creativity.” 

SECOND  INDICATION:    Terms  like,  The  Best  of  Creators    do  not  look  to  a 
plurality of creators, but to the varieties of the  state of  being creature. That is,  “He  is a 
Creator  Who  creates  everything  in  an  appropriate  form,  at  the  most  faultless  degree.” 
Verses like, Who makes most excellent everything He creates,24 express this meaning. 

THIRD  INDICATION:    The  comparison  suggested  by  terms  like,  The  Best  of 
Creators,  God  is  Most  Great,  The  Best  Judge  between  truth  and  falsehood,25  and  The 
Most  Bountiful  are  not  comparative  and  superlative  adjectives  comparing  God 
Almighty’s attributes and actions, which are actual, with others who possess samples of 
those attributes and actions. For all the perfections in the universe, and in jinn, men, and 
angels, are but pale shadows in relation to His perfection. How should any comparison be 
possible?  It  is  rather  human  beings,  and  particularly  the  people  of  neglect,  who  see 
perfection in terms of comparison. 

For  example,  a  private  shows  complete  obedience  and  respect  to  his  corporal.  It 
seems to him that all benefits come from him and he thinks little of the king. Even if he 
does think of him, it is still to the corporal that he shows his gratitude. So it is said to the 
private: “See here! The king  is  much greater than  your corporal,  it  is only  him that you 
should thank.” Now this sentence does not compare the king’s imperial commandership, 
which is actual, with that of the corporal, which is partial and only apparent; because to 
do so would be meaningless. It is a result of what the private considers to be important, of 
how he sees his relations with the corporal, that he prefers him and loves and thanks only 
him. 

Similarly,  when  apparent  causes  are  imagined  to  be  the  creator  and  bestower  of 
bounties in the view of the people of neglect, they become a veil to the True Bestower of 
Bounties. These neglectful people cling onto causes and think that bounties and favours 
are  from  them;  they  praise  and  acclaim  them.  The  Qur’an  says:  “God  Almighty  is  a 
greater, more excellent Creator, a far  better Bestower of Bounties. So look to Him, and 
thank Him.” 

FOURTH INDICATION:  Just as there may be comparison between actual beings 
and preference  for some over others, so there  may  be comparisons  between possible or 
even hypothetical things and preference. Numerous  

                                                

24 Qur’an, 32:7. 
25 Qur’an, 6:57. 

 

646 

degrees or levels are present in the true natures of most things. So too, in the view of the 
intellect,  innumerable  degrees  may  be  present  in  the  true  natures  of  the  Divine  Names 
and  sacred attributes.  Whereas God Almighty  is  at the  most perfect and  excellent of all 
the  possible  and  imagined  degrees  of  those  attributes  and  Names.  The  whole  universe 
witnesses  to  this  truth  through  all  its  perfections.  His  are  the  Most  Beautiful  Names,26 
“describing all His Names as the most excellent,” expresses this meaning. 

FIFTH  INDICATION:    This  use  of  the  comparative  and  superlative  is  not  to  be 
understood in terms of creatures, but in terms of the fact that God Almighty has two sorts 
of manifestations and attributes. 

The First Sort: Through the mystery of His unity, this consists of His disposal over 

creatures under the veil of causes and intermediaries and in the form of a universal law. 

The  Second  Sort:  Through  the  mystery  of  His  oneness,  it  is  His  disposal  over 
creatures  directly,  without  veil,  regarding  each  in  a  particular  way.  This  means  that 
through the mystery of oneness, His bestowal, creation, and grandeur which are direct are 
greater  and  more  elevated  and  excellent  than  the  works  of  His  bestowal,  creation,  and 
grandeur which are apparent through the manifestations of causes and intermediaries. 

For  example,  let  us  suppose  there  is  a  king,  but  he  is  a  saint-king.  He  has  great 
numbers  of  officials  and  commanders  but  they  are  only  veils,  for  the  authority  and 
execution  of  all  matters  are  directly  in  his  hand.  The  king’s  power  of  disposal  and 
execution of affairs are of two kinds: 

The First Kind: The execution of affairs he demonstrates and the commands he gives 
through  a  universal  law  in  the  form  of  visible  officials  and  commanders  in  accordance 
with their abilities and ranks. 

The  Second  Kind:    This  is  not  through  a  universal  law.  He  does  not  make  visible 
officials a veil; his execution of affairs and royal favours are direct and may be described 
as more elevated and excellent. 

In the same way, the Creator of the universe, the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-
Eternity, has made numerous causes and intermediaries a veil to His execution of affairs 
and has demonstrated the majesty of His dominicality. But He left private telephones in 
His servants’ hearts so that they might leave causes behind and turn directly to Him, and 
might say: You alone do we worship and You alone do we ask for help!27 

Thus,  the  meanings  of  The  Best  of  Creators,  Most  Compassionate  of  the 

Compassionate, and, God is Most Great look to this meaning, too.

We shall answer the second part of the representative’s question with five Signs. 
The First Sign:  In his question, he said: “If something has no opposite, how can it 

be perfection?” 

The Answer: The questioner does not know what true perfection is. What he has in 
mind is only relative perfection. For merits, virtues, and qualities that look to something 
and are acquired relatively to something else are not real, they are relative and weak. If 
what they look to disappears, then they too will disappear. 

For example, the relative pleasure and merits of heat occur through the effect of cold, 
and the relative pleasure of food, through the effect of the pain of hunger. If the cold and 
hunger disappear, then the pleasure diminishes. Whereas true pleasure,  love, perfection, 
and virtue are such that they are not constructed on imagining something else. They are 
present of themselves. They are essential, inherent truths. 

Qualities  such  as  the  following  are  like  this:  the  pleasures  of  existence,  life,  love, 
knowledge,  mercy,  and  compassion;  and  the  beauty  of  light,  sight,  speech,  noble-
heartedness,  fine  character,  and  form;  the  perfection  of  essence  and  of  attribute  and 
perfection  in  actions.  Whether  or  not  there  is  something  else,  these  qualities  will  not 
change.  Thus,  all  the  perfections  of  the  Glorious  Fashioner,  the  Beauteous  Maker,  the 
Perfect Creator are true perfections; they are essential and what is other than Him cannot 
affect Him. They can only be recipients. 

The Second Sign: Sayyid Sharif al-Jurjani wrote  in Sharh al-Mawaqif: “The cause 
of  love  is  either  pleasure,  benefit,  resemblance  (that  is,  inclination  towards  creatures of 
same kind), or perfection.  For perfection  is  loved  for  itself.” That  is to say,  if  you  love 
something, you love it either because of the pleasure it affords, or the benefits it brings, 
or  because  it  is  similar  in  kind,  like  the  inclination  towards  children,  or  because  it 
possesses some perfection. If it is for perfection, no other cause or purpose is necessary; 
it is loved purely for itself. For example, in the olden days everybody loved people who 
possessed  perfection;  even  if  they  had  no  connection  with  them  they  would  still  love 
them admiringly. 

Thus, since all God Almighty’s perfections and qualities and all the degrees  in  His 
Beautiful Names are true perfections, they are  loved  for themselves. The Glorious One, 
Who  is  the  true  beloved,  loves  His  perfections,  which  are  true  perfections,  and  the 
beauties of His attributes and Names in a manner appropriate to Himself. And He loves 
the good qualities of His art and creatures, which are mirrors reflecting those perfections. 

He loves His prophets and saints, especially the Most Noble Beloved,  

 

648 

who  is the Lord of the Prophets and Prince of the Saints. That is, with His  love  for His 
own beauty, He loves His Beloved One, who is the mirror to that beauty. With His love 
for His own Names, He loves His Beloved One and his brothers who are comprehensive 
and aware loci of those Names’ manifestations. 

With  His  love  for  His  art,  He  loves  His  Beloved  One  and  those  like  him  who  are 
heralds and exhibitors of that art. With His love for His artefacts, He loves His Beloved 
One and those who follow him who appreciate and admire those artefacts and respond to 
them  saying:  “What  wonders  God  has  willed!  How  beautifully  they  have  been  made.” 
And  with  His  love  for  the  good  qualities  of  His  creatures,  He  loves  His  Most  Noble 
Beloved  One  and  his  followers  and  brothers  in  whom  are  united  the  finest  of  moral 
qualities. 

The Third Sign: All the perfections in all the universe are signs and indications of a 
Glorious Being’s perfection and beauty. Indeed, all the goodness, perfection, and beauty 
in the universe is but a pale shadow in relation to His true perfection. We shall  indicate 
briefly five proofs of this truth. 

First Proof: A perfect and splendidly adorned and decorated palace plainly points to 
perfect  skill  and  craftsmanship.  And  that  craftsmanship  and  art,  which  is  a  perfect  act, 
plainly points to a perfect author, master, and craftsman together with his titles and names 
like  Fashioner  and  Adorner.  And  those  perfect  names  doubtlessly  point  to the  master’s 
perfect  and  skilful  attributes.  And  that  perfect  skill  and  those  attributes  self-evidently 
point  to  his  perfect  ability  and  faculty.  And  that  perfect  ability  and  faculty  necessarily 
point to the perfection of his essence and the exaltedness of his nature. 

In exactly the same way, this palace of the universe, this perfect and adorned work of 
art, self-evidently points to actions of the utmost perfection. For perfections in works of 
art  result  from  perfection  of  action  and  they  demonstrate  it.  And  perfection  of  actions 
point to a Perfect Author and the perfect Names of that Author. That is, in relation to the 
works  of  art,  they  point  to  the  perfection  of  Names  like,  Planner,  Fashioner,  All-Wise, 
All-Compassionate, and Adorner. 

Moreover,  the  perfection  of  the  Names  and  titles,  without  any  doubt,  point  to  the 
Author’s  perfect  attributes.  For  if  the  attributes  were  not  perfect,  the  Names  and  titles 
which  originate  from  the  attributes  would  not  be  perfect.  And  the  perfection  of  the 
attributes self-evidently points to the perfection of His functioning essence, because it is 
from the  functioning essence that the attributes proceed. And the perfection of essential 
functions  point  at  the  degree  of  ‘knowledge  of  certainty’  to  the  perfection  of  the 
functioning essence. They  point to a perfection so worthy that although the  light of the 
perfection passes through the veils of functions, attributes, Names, actions,  

 

649 

and works of art, it still demonstrates the goodness, beauty, and perfection to be seen to 
this great extent in the universe, 

Thus,  after  the  existence  of  this  degree  of  true,  essential  perfection  has  been 
established  with  cogent  proofs  what  importance  remains  for  relative  perfections,  which 
look to other things and which exist only in so far as they gain superiority over their likes 
and opposites? You may understand, then, just how paltry they become. 

Second Proof: When the universe is studied as something from which lessons are to 
be  taken,  the  conscience  and  heart  may  conjecture  and  perceive  the  following:  the  one 
who  has  so  beautified  and  adorned  the  universe  with  all  manner  of  fine  things,  himself 
possesses an infinite degree of beauty and perfection so that he might make it thus. 

Third Proof:  It is a well-known fact that works of art which are well-proportioned, 
symmetrical, perfect, and beautiful are based on an exceedingly well-drawn-up plan. And 
a perfectly drawn plan points to a perfectly sound knowledge, fine intellect, and refined 
faculty of spirit. That is to say, it is the spirit’s immaterial beauty which is manifested in 
art  by  means  of  knowledge.  Thus,  the  universe,  with  its  innumerable  material  fine 
qualities,  is  formed  of  the  distillations  of  immaterial  fine  qualities  pertaining  to 
knowledge. And those immaterial qualities pertaining to knowledge and those perfections 
are certainly the manifestations of an infinite, eternal loveliness, beauty, and perfection. 

Fourth Proof:  It is obvious that that which gives light must possess light, and that 
which  illuminates  must  be  luminous,  that  bounty  comes  from  riches,  and  kindness 
proceeds from one who is kind. Since this so, since all this loveliness and beauty is given 
to the universe and perfection  is  bestowed on beings, they point to an eternal  beauty as 
light points to the sun. 

Beings  pass  over  the  face  of  the  earth  like  a  vast  river  sparkling  with  flashes  of 
perfection. In the same way that a river sparkles with manifestations of the sun, the flood 
of  beings  momentarily  sparkles  with  flashes  of  loveliness,  beauty,  and  perfection,  and 
then is gone. And the beings following after them display the same flashes and sparkling. 
It may be understood from this that just as the manifestations and instances of beauty on 
the  flowing  bubbles  of  water  are  not  from  themselves,  but  are  manifestations  and 
instances of beauty from the light of a sun, so the qualities and perfections which glisten 
briefly  on  the  flood  of  the  universe  are  the  flashes  of  the  beauty  of  an  Eternal  Sun’s 
Names. 

Yes,  the  annihilation  of  the  mirrors  and  the  vanishing  of  beings  is  together  with 
perpetual  manifestation  and  constant  effulgence.  It  is  clear  from  the  manifestations 
appearing  that  their  apparent  beauty  is  not  theirs;  they  are  rather  eloquent  manifestos 
and clear proofs of a Transcendent  

 

650 

Beauty  and  Renewed  Munificence;  of  the  Necessarily  Existent,  the  Loving  One,  the 
Undying One. 

Fifth Proof: If four people who have arrived via four different routes all speak of the 
same  event,  it  suggests  with  a  certainty  born  of  unanimity  that  the  event  definitely 
occurred. Thus, although their ways, dispositions, abilities, and times were all different, 
all  the  scholars  of  religion  with  their  different  ranks,  the  saints  and  purified  ones  with 
their different paths and ways, and the true philosophers with their different creeds are in 
agreement.  They  are  the  people  of  illumination  and  experiential  knowledge,  who  have 
unveiled  the  secrets  of  the  cosmos  and  have  observed  and  borne  witness  to  the  truth  –
through  their  unveilings,  illuminations,  and  witnessings,  they  have  unanimously  agreed 
that the  qualities  and  perfections  to  be  seen  in  the  mirrors  and  displays  of  the  universe 
and  its  beings,  are  the  manifestations  of  a  Single  Necessarily  Existent  One’s  perfection 
and the manifestations of the beauty of His Names. 

Their consensus and accord, then, constitutes an unshakeable proof. 
Let us suppose that in order not to hear this Sign, the representative of the people of 
misguidance was compelled to stop up his ears and flee. For certainly, like bats, heads so 
plunged  into darkness cannot endure these  lights. In which case,  from  here on we  shall 
consider them little, if at all. 

The  Fourth  Sign:  Rather  than  looking  to  its  likes  and  opposites,  the  pleasure, 
loveliness,  and  beauty  of  a  thing  look  to  where  those  qualities  are  manifested.  For 
example,  generosity  is  a  fine  and  pleasing  attribute.  The  pleasure  a  generous  person 
obtains  from  the  joy  and  pleasure  of  those  he  has  favoured  is  thousands  of  times  more 
gratifying  than  the  relative  pleasure  obtained  from  feeling  superior  to  other  generous 
people. 

Also,  a  kind  and  compassionate  person  receives  true  pleasure  proportionately  to 
those towards whom he has been compassionate find ease and comfort. For example, the 
pleasure  a  mother  receives  from  the  happiness  and  comfort  of  her  children,  because  of 
her  compassion,  is  so  strong  she  would  sacrifice  her  very  soul  for  their  comfort.  The 
pleasure  of  such  compassion  will  even  make  a  hen  attack  a  lion  in  order to  protect  her 
chicks. 

Thus, the true pleasure, goodness, happiness and perfection in elevated attributes do 
not  look  to  peers  and  opposites,  but  to  their  dependants  and  the  places  they  are 
manifested.  The  beauty,  therefore,  of  the  Glorious  and  Perfect  One’s  mercy,  Who  is 
Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent, Clement and Benevolent, Compassionate and Merciful, 
looks to those who receive His mercy. 

There  are  endless  degrees  in  the  happiness,  ease  and  joy  of  those  who  receive  the 
manifestation of His mercy and compassion, and especially those who receive its endless 
varieties in everlasting Paradise. We may  

 

651 

understand  that,  according  to  the  degrees  of  their  happiness  and  joy,  the  Merciful  and 
Compassionate  One  experiences  exalted,  pure,  holy,  and  beautiful  meanings,  like 
fondness  and  love,  in  a  manner  appropriate  to  Him,  that  may  be  described  through 
qualities which are proper to Him. He possesses utterly pure and holy qualities which we 
may not mention because the Shari’a does not permit it, but which may be described as 
‘sacred  pleasure,’  ‘holy  love,’  ‘pure  joy’  and  ‘sacred  happiness.’  We  have  proved  in 
many places that they are infinitely more exalted, elevated, holy, and pure than the love, 
joy, and happiness that we see in the universe and may perceive among creatures. If you 
wish to take a look at a flash of those  meanings, then  look through the telescope of the 
following comparisons. 

For example, a noble-hearted and magnanimous personage laid out a fine banquet on 
his magnificent voyaging ship in order to feed the poor, the needy, and hungry. Then he 
himself watched from on deck. You can understand how pleased and happy the thankful 
pleasure  and  appreciative  gratitude  of  the  poor,  hungry  and  needy  made  that  generous 
personage; how much it gratified him. 

Man  is  not  the  true  owner  of  even  the  humblest  repast  and  is  merely  like  a 
distributor.  Therefore,  if  his  joy  is  thus,  you  can  draw  an  analogy  with  the  sacred 
meanings  of  love  and  results  of  mercy  that  pertain  to  the  Merciful  and  Compassionate 
One  and  which  we  are  powerless  to  express.  For  He  causes  men,  jinn,  and  animals  to 
journey  in  the  seas  of  space,  and  to  board the  mighty  earth,  which  is  a  dominical  ship. 
Then,  loading the table of the  face of the earth with  innumerable  varieties of  foods, He 
invites  all  living  creatures  to  the  feast,  which  is  a  sort  of  light  snack  or  appetizer.  For 
besides  this,  He  will  make  each  of  every  sort  of  perfect  delight  a  table  laden  with 
bounties  in  a  permanent  and  everlasting  realm.  He  will  inaugurate  an  unending  and 
comprehensive banquet of innumerable pleasures and subtle wonders, which will be true 
food for His countless and endlessly needy and yearning slaves. 

And,  for  example,  a  skilful  and  practised  craftsman  who  likes  to  display  his 
ingenuity, after inventing an object like a gramophone which plays without records, will 
set  it  up,  try  it  out  and  then  show  it  off.  If  it  gives  the  desired  and  expected  results 
perfectly, how proud will its inventor feel, how pleased and gratified will he be. He will 
say to himself: “May God bless this!” 

And  so,  if  an  insignificant  man  is  so  pleased  with  the  smooth  working  of  a 
gramophone and with his craftsmanship which is only superficial, for in reality he creates 
nothing, then how should the All-Glorious Maker be? For He created the mighty universe 
as an orchestra and gramophone, and He made the earth, and all the animate creatures on 
it,  and  among  animate  creatures  especially  man.  And  man’s  head  He  created  in  such  a 
fashion that it is a  

 

652 

dominical  gramophone  and  Divine  orchestra  so  that  science  and  philosophy  are  struck 
with wonderment at the art and craftsmanship displayed in it. 

Thus, all these beings show all the results desired of them to the utmost degree and in 
the  best  possible  way.  They  are  completely  obedient  to  the  commands  that  give  them 
existence, which are described by the creatures’ particular worship and glorification and 
their appointed salutations to God. The pride, pleasure and  joy together with the  sacred 
meanings  and  pure  qualities,  which  we  are  unable  to  describe,  that  are  obtained  from 
these  and  from  the  attainment  of  the  dominical  aims  sought  from  the  beings,  are  so 
exalted and holy that if all the minds of mankind were to unite and become one mind, it 
would still be unable to reach or comprehend their substance. 

And another example. What pleasure and enjoyment a just ruler who loves to enforce 
justice and right receives from giving the oppressed their rights and receiving their thanks 
and from punishing the wrongdoers and taking revenge for the oppressed. You can draw 
an  analogy  with  the  sacred  meanings  pertaining  to the  Absolutely  Wise  One,  the  Truly 
Just  One,  the  All-Compelling  and  Glorious  One,  which  arise  from  establishing  justice, 
and not only for men and jinn, but for all creatures. 

That is to say, the sacred meanings arising from bestowing the right of existence and 
the  right  of  life  on  everything,  from  protecting  existence  and  life  from  aggressors,  and 
from arresting and restraining those ghastly creatures from their aggression; and that arise 
especially from the judgement of men and jinn at the Great Gathering in the realm of the 
hereafter. And  besides this, the  sacred  meanings  arising  from the greatest  manifestation 
of justice and wisdom that is apparent in animate creatures. 

Thus,  as  may  be  seen  from  these  three  examples,  just  as  a  great  many  degrees  of 
loveliness,  beauty,  grace,  and  perfection  are  present  in  all  the  thousand  and  one  Divine 
Names, so there are a great many degrees of love, pride, glory, and grandeur.  

It  is  because  of  this  that  the  elevated  and  authoritative  saints  who  manifested  the 
Name of Loving One said: “Love is the very leaven of the universe. It is through love that 
all  beings  are  in  motion. It is  from  love that the  laws of attraction, affinity, and ecstasy 
present in all beings spring.” One of them wrote the following: 

The firmament is intoxicated, the angels and the stars are intoxicated, 
The heavens are intoxicated, the moon and the earth are intoxicated, 
The elements are intoxicated, the plants, the trees and mankind are intoxicated, 
Animate creatures are all intoxicated, 
All  the  particles  of  all  beings  are  altogether  intoxicated,  and  yet  more 

intoxicated. 

That is to say, everyone receives the manifestation of Divine love and is  

 

653 

intoxicated  in  accordance  with  his  capacity.  It  is  well-known  that  every  heart  has 
affection for someone who bestows kindnesses on it, and that it loves true perfection and 
is  enamoured  of  noble  beauty.  And  the  heart  loves  even  more  one  who  bestows 
kindnesses, not only on itself, but also on those it loves and feels compassion for.  

And  so,  as  we  explained  before,  may  it  not  be  understood  from  the  following  just 
how  deserving  of  love  and  passion  is  the  All-Beauteous  and  Glorious  One,  the  All-
Perfect Beloved One, and how intoxicated and giddy is the whole universe with love of 
Him? For He is named with a thousand Names each of which is the source of thousands 
of  perfections  and  the  means  for  thousands  of  degrees  of  beauty.  And  through  His 
bounties, in all the Names are thousands of treasuries containing bounties, and He makes 
all those beings we love happy. 

It is because of this mystery that the saints who manifested the Name of Loving One 
declared:  “We  do  not  want  Paradise.  One  flash  of  the  Divine  love  will  suffice  us  for 
ever.” 

It is also because of this that as is recorded in the Hadith: “A minute’s vision of the 

Divine beauteousness in Paradise will far surpass all its other delights.”28 

Thus,  these  endless  perfections  of  love  only  occur  through  the  All-Glorious  One’s 
Names and His creatures within the sphere of His unity and oneness. That is to say, those 
perfections that are imagined to exist outside that sphere are not perfections at all. 

The Fifth Sign: The Fifth Sign consists of five Points. 
First Point: The representative of the people of misguidance said next: “The world is 
execrated in  your Hadiths and called  ‘carrion.’29 Also, all the saints  and people of truth 
have  contempt  for  the  world,  they  say  that  it  is  pernicious  and  unclean.  Whereas,  you 
show it to be the means and proof of all Divine perfections and speak of it rapturously.” 

The Answer: The world has three faces. 
Its  First  Face  looks  to  God  Almighty’s  Names;  it  displays  their  impress.  It  is  a 
mirror to them, reflecting their meanings. This face of the world consists of innumerable 
letters or missives describing the Eternally Besought One. This  face  is utterly  beautiful, 
and is worthy of love, not loathing. 

Its Second Face looks to the hereafter. It is the seed-bed of the hereafter and arable 
field  for Paradise. It is the  flower-bed of  mercy.  This  face  is also beautiful  like the  first 
one and is deserving of love not contempt. 

                                                

28 Tirmidhi, Zuhd, 14; Ibn Maja, Zuhd, 3; Darimi, Muqaddima, 32; Suyuti, al-Durr al-Manthur, iii, 

305-6. 

29 Ibn Maja, No: 4112; al-Manawi, Fayd al-Qadir, No: 4281. 

 

654 

Its Third Face looks to man’s base appetites. It is a veil of neglect and a plaything for 
satisfying the desires of the worldly. This face is ugly because it is transient and mortal; it 
is full of pain and it deceives. The contempt described in the Hadith and the loathing of 
the people of truth, then, is for this face. 

The  importance  and  approbation  which  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  demonstrates  towards 
the universe and all  beings  is towards the  first two faces. It is the  first two faces of the 
world that the Companions of the Prophet (Peace and blessings be upon him) and other 
people of God seek. 

There are four classes of people who have contempt for the world. 
The First: Those who seek knowledge of God. They have contempt for it because it 

is a barrier to knowledge, love, and worship of God. 

The  Second:  Those  who  look  to  the  hereafter.  They  see  the  world  as  ugly  either 
because  unavoidable  worldly  matters  prevent  them  from  doing  works  pertaining  to  the 
hereafter. Or, due to their elevated degree of belief, they see it as ugly in relation to the 
perfections and beauties of Paradise. 

Indeed,  in  the  same  way  that  a  handsome  man  will  appear  ugly  when  compared  to 
the  Prophet  Joseph  (Peace  be  upon  him),  however  valuable  the  qualities  of  this  world, 
when compared to those of Paradise, they become as nothing.  

The  Third:  These  have  contempt  for this  world  because  they  cannot obtain  it.  This 

contempt arises not from loathing but from love. 

The  Fourth:  These  have  contempt  for  the  world  because  although  they  obtain  it,  it 
does  not  stay,  it  leaves  them.  And  this  vexes  them.  They  insult  it  in  order  to  console 
themselves and say it is foul. But this arises from love of the world, whereas acceptable 
contempt arises  from  love of the  hereafter and the  love that springs  from knowledge of 
God. 

That  is  to  say,  acceptable  contempt  is  of  the  first  two  kinds.  May  God  Almighty 

make us like those people. Amen. 

IN VENERATION OF THE LORD OF THE PROPHETS 

 

655 

Third Stopping-Place 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
And there is nothing but it glorifies Him with praise.30 

FIRST TOPIC 

According  to the  meaning  of  And  there  is  nothing  but  it  glorifies  Him  with  praise, 

everything has numerous aspects that give onto God Almighty like windows. 

The realities of all beings and of the universe are based on the Divine Names. Each 
being’s  reality  is  based  on  one  Name  or on  many.  The  attributes  of  things  and  the  arts 
they display are also based on and rely upon a Name. True natural science is based on the 
Name of All-Wise, true medicine on the Name of Healer, and geometry on the Name of 
Determiner, and so on. In the same way that all the sciences are based on and come to an 
end  in  a  Name,  the  realities  of  all  arts  and  sciences,  and  of  all  human  attainments,  are 
based  on  the  Divine  Names.  Indeed,  one  group  of  the  most  learned  of  the  saints  stated 
that the Divine Names  constitute the true reality  of things, while the essences of things 
are  only  shadows  of  that  reality.  They  said  too  that  even  only  apparently  as  many  as 
twenty manifestations and impresses of the Divine Names may be seen on a single living 
creature. We shall try to make this subtle yet vast truth easier to understand by means of a 
comparison,  and  shall  analyze  it  by  passing  it  through  a  sieve  two  or  three  times  as  it 
were.  However  long  our  discussion,  it  would  still  be  short,  but one  should  not  become 
bored. 

When a skilful portraitist or sculptor wishes to paint a picture of a beautiful flower or 
to sculpt a great beauty belonging to mankind’s fair sex, firstly he determines the general 
shapes  of  those  two  objects  with  a  few  lines.  He  determines  these  by  ordering  and 
adjusting them,  by estimating  and  measuring them.  And this  he does according to rules 
and limits defined by geometry. 

It is clear that this ordering and measuring is carried out with knowledge and wisdom 
or  purpose.  That  is  to  say,  the  acts  of  ordering  and  limiting  turn  on  the  compasses  of 
knowledge and wisdom. In which case, the meanings of knowledge and wisdom govern 
behind the ordering and limiting. The compasses of knowledge and wisdom, then, point 
to themselves and they demon 

                                                

30 Qur’an, 17:44. 

 

656 

strate that, within those limits, they have begun the portrayal of small particulars like the 
eyes, ears, nose, leaves, and stamens. 

Now  we  see  that the  members  determined  by  the  motion  of  those  inner  compasses 
are  taking  shape  artistically  and  carefully.  Since  this  is  so,  the  one  who  turns  these 
knowledge  and  wisdom  compasses  possesses  meanings  of  craftsmanship  and  care;  it  is 
they who command and then display themselves. 

Thus,  it  may  be understood from this that they point to inherent qualities of beauty 
and adornment. Since this  is so, what  makes the  craftsmanship and care  function  is the 
will to beautify and the  intention to decorate. In which case,  it is at their command that 
the artist begins to adorn and illuminate. He gives a smiling and living form to the statue 
and  flower.  And  what  makes  this  meaning  of  beautifying  and  illuminating  function  is 
surely the meaning of favouring and munificence. 

Yes, these two meanings govern him to such a degree that, quite simply, the flower is 
an embodied favour, and the statue, embodied munificence. So now it is the meanings of 
making  loved  and  known  that  impel  the  meanings  of  favouring  and  munificence  and 
make  them  work.  That  is,  behind  the  latter  two  meanings,  the  meanings  of  making 
himself known through his art and making people love him govern. 

This  making  loved  and  known,  without  a  doubt  arise  from  an  inclination  toward 
being  merciful and the will to bestow bounties. So, since  mercy  and the will to bestow 
bounties  are  governing  behind  them,  he  will  adorn  the  statue  with  all  sorts  of  bounties 
and also bestow the form of the flower as a present. Thus, he fills the statue’s hands and 
pockets with precious  bounties and  bestows the  form of the  flower as  jewels. That is to 
say, what makes his mercy and will to bestow function is a feeling of gentleness and pity. 
That is, the meaning of pity and gentleness impels the mercy and bounty. 

Furthermore,  what  impels  and  makes  manifest  the  meaning  of  pity  and  gentleness 
within that person, who  is  self-sufficient and  needs  no one, are the  meanings of  beauty 
and perfection. These desire to be manifested. And as for love and mercy, which are the 
sweetest and most delightful parts of that beauty, they desire to be seen in the mirror of 
art and to see themselves through the eyes of yearning admirers. 

That  is  to  say,  since  beauty  and  perfection  are  loved  for  themselves,  they  love 
themselves  above  everything.  They  are  also  both  loveliness  and  love.  The  union  of 
beauty and love stems from this point. Since beauty loves itself, it desires to see itself in 
mirrors.  Thus  all  the  lovable  bounties  and  beautiful  fruits  which  were  set  on  the  statue 
and  on  the  picture  bear  the  flashes,  each  according  to  its  capacity,  of  that  meaning  of 
beauty. They display those flashes both to the owner of the beauty and to others. 

 

657 

In exactly the same way, the All-Wise Maker delimits, orders and gives determined 
proportions and shapes to all things, particular and universal, through the manifestation of 
His  Names;  to  Paradise  and  this  world,  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  plants  and  animals, 
men and jinn, angels and spirit beings. By doing this, He causes them to recite His Names 
of Determiner, Orderer, and Giver of Form. 

He  determines  the  limits  of  their  general  shapes  in  such  a  manner  that  He  displays 
His Names of All-Knowing and All-Wise. Then, through the definition of knowledge and 
wisdom, He begins to form them within those limits. He does this in such a way that He 
displays  the  meanings  of  craftsmanship  and  care  and  His  Names  of  Maker  and 
Munificent. 

Next,  with  the  miraculous  hand  of  art  and  the  brush  of  munificence  He  gives  the 
colours of  beauty and adornment to the  members of that form, whether a single  human 
being  or  a  single  flower,  like  the  eyes,  ears,  leaves,  and  stamens.  If  it  is  the  earth,  He 
gives  the  colours  of  beauty  and  adornment  to  its  minerals,  plants  and  animals.  If  it  is 
Paradise,  He  gives  the  colours  of  beauty  and  adornment  to  its  gardens,  palaces,  and 
houris. And so on. You can make analogies for the rest, too. 

Furthermore,  He  adorns  and  illuminates  in  such  a  fashion  that  the  meanings  of 
favouring  and  munificence  are  predominant  in  those  objects.  They  govern  to  a  degree 
where  those  adorned  beings,  those  illuminated  artefacts,  become  like  embodied  favours 
and incarnate munificence. They mention the Names of Gracious and Munificent. 

Next, what impels the favouring and munificence to manifest are clearly the actions 
of  making  loved  and known. That is, the qualities of  making Himself  loved  by  animate 
creatures  and  known  by  conscious  ones.  They  cause  animate  and  conscious  beings  to 
recite  the  Names  of  Loving  and  Known  One  behind  the  Names  of  Gracious  and 
Munificent, and for this recitation, which is performed by the very mode of their beings, 
to be heard. 

Then,  embellishing  those  adorned  and  beautiful  creatures  with  delicious  fruits  and 
lovable  results,  He  turns  from  adorning  to  bestowing  bounties,  from  graciousness  to 
compassionateness. He causes them to recite the Names of Bestower and Compassionate 
and displays the manifestation of those two Names behind the outer veils. 

Next,  what  impels  that  One,  Who  is  absolutely  without  need,  to  manifest  these 
Names  of  Compassionate  and  Munificent  are  the  qualities  of  mercy  and  gentleness, 
which display the Names of Gentle and Merciful and cause them to be recited. 

And  what  impels  the  meanings  of  mercifulness  and  gentleness  to  manifest  are 
doubtless, an essential beauty and perfection which desire to become evident; they cause 
the Name of Beautiful, and the Names of Loving and  

 

658 

Compassionate,  which  are  within  the  Name  of  Beautiful,  to  be  recited.  For  beauty  is 
loved for itself. Beauty and one possessing beauty love themselves. Moreover, it is both 
loveliness and love. 

Perfection, also, is  loved  for  itself;  no other cause  is  necessary. It is  both  lover and 
beloved. Since a beauty that is at the utmost degree of perfection and a perfection that is 
at  the  utmost  degree  of  beauty  are  loved  and  are  worthy  of  love  to  the  utmost  degree, 
most certainly will they desire to see and to exhibit themselves through displaying their 
flashes and manifestations in mirrors, in accordance with the capacity of the mirrors. 

That is to say, the beauty and perfection essential to the All-Glorious Maker, the All-
Wise One of Beauty, the All-Powerful One of Perfection, require the qualities of  mercy 
and gentleness, and impel the Names of Merciful and Gentle to be manifested. 

As for mercy and gentleness, through displaying compassion and bounty, they impel 

the manifestation of the Names of Compassionate and Bestower. 

And  compassionateness  and  bestowal  require  the  qualities  of  making  known  and 

loved and impel the Names of Loving and Known One to be manifested. 

Making  known  and  loved  impel  the  meanings  of  favouring  and  munificence  and 
display them on some of the facets of those artefacts; they cause the Names of Gracious 
and Munificent to be recited amongst them. 

As for the qualities of graciousness and munificence, they impel the acts of adorning 
and  illuminating.  They  cause  the  Names  of  Adorner  and  Illuminer  to  be  recited  by  the 
tongues of the artefacts’ beauty and luminosity. 

And the qualities of adorning and beautifying require the meanings of craftsmanship 
and  care.  They  cause  the  Names  of  Maker  and  Bountiful  to  be  recited  by  the  beautiful 
features of the artefacts. 

As for craftsmanship and care, they require knowledge and wisdom, and they cause 
the  Names  of  All-Wise  and  All-Knowing  to  be  recited  by  their  well-ordered,  wise,  and 
purposeful members. 

And knowledge and wisdom require the acts of ordering, forming, and shaping. They 
display the Names of Determiner and Giver of Form, causing them to be recited by the 
artefact in its entirety, through its form. 

Thus, the All-Glorious Maker has made all His creatures or artefacts in such a way 
that  He  causes  most of  them,  and  especially  animate  beings,  to recite  numerous  Divine 
Names. It is as  if  He  has dressed  each creature  in twenty different shirts, one on top of 
another or has enfolded them in twenty veils, and on each shirt or veil He has inscribed 
different Names. 

For example, as was demonstrated in the comparison, there are many  

 

659 

pages in what is only apparent in the creation of a beautiful member of mankind’s fair sex 
or  of  a  beautiful  flower.  From  these  two  small  and  particular  examples  you  can  draw 
analogies with other large and universal creatures. 

The First Page: It is the state which demonstrates the general shape and proportion. 

It mentions the Names of O Giver of Form! O Determiner! O Orderer! 

The  Second  Page:  This  is  the  plain  and  unadorned  state  of  the  human  being  and 
flower  in  the  comparison,  which  occurs  with  the  disclosure  of  the  forms  of  all  the 
different members of those two creatures. Many Names, like All-Knowing and All-Wise, 
for example, are written on this page. 

The  Third  Page:  Through  bestowing  a  different  beauty  and  adornment  on  all  the 
different  members  of  those  two  creatures,  many  Names  like  Maker  and  Designer,  for 
example, are written on this page. 

The Fourth Page: Such a beauty and adornment are given to those two artefacts it is 
as though they have become embodied favours and munificence. This page mentions and 
recites numerous Names, like for example, O Gracious One! O Munificent One! 

The Fifth Page: Through attaching delicious fruits to the flower and lovable children 
and a fine character to the beautiful woman, this page recites Names like O Loving One! 
O Compassionate One! O Bestower of Bounties! 

The Sixth Page: On this page of bestowal and bounties, Names like O Merciful One! 

O Gentle One! are recited.  

The Seventh Page: Flashes of such beauty are apparent in these bounties and results 
that they are worthy of a sincere gratitude and pure love which have been kneaded with 
true desire and compassion. On this page, the Names of O Beauteous One of Perfection! 
O Perfect One of Beauty! are inscribed and recited. 

Thus,  if  the  beautiful  flower  and  human  being  display  this  number  of  Names,  and 
that  only  in  material  and  apparent  form,  you  can  conclude  what  exalted  and  universal 
Names  all  flowers  and  animate  creatures,  as  well  as  vast,  universal  beings,  cause  to  be 
recited. 

You  can  also  conclude  how  many  luminous,  sacred  Names,  like  Ever-Living  and 
Self-Subsistent One, and Giver of Life, man recites and causes to be recited by reason of 
his spirit, heart, mind, and through the pages of life and other subtle qualities. 

Thus, Paradise is a flower. The company of houris is also a flower. The face of the 
earth  is  a  flower.  The  spring  is  a  flower.  The  heavens  are  a  flower,  while  the  stars  are 
their gilded embroideries. And the sun is a flower, while the seven colours in its light are 
the flower’s embroidered colours. 

 

660 

The universe is a beautiful and huge human being, in the same way that each human 
being is a miniature universe. The company of houris, the assembly of spirit beings, the 
realm of angels, the congregation of jinn, and human kind, have all been formed, ordered, 
and  created  as  if  they  were  beautiful  individuals.  Just  as they  all  display  the  Beauteous 
Maker’s Names through their universality, as does each individual singly, so are they all 
different mirrors to His beauty and perfection, mercy and love. All are truthful witnesses 
to  His  infinite  beauty  and  perfection,  mercy  and  love.  All  are  signs  and  tokens  of  that 
beauty and perfection, mercy and love. 

Thus, this infinite number of different sorts of perfections occurs within the sphere of 
Divine unity and oneness. That is to say, what are imagined to be perfections outside that 
sphere are not perfections at all.  

Understand therefore that the reality of  beings  is  based on and relies on the Divine 
Names;  rather,  that  their  true  realities  are  the  manifestations  of  those  Names;  and  that 
everything mentions and glorifies its Maker with numerous tongues in numerous ways. 

And understand one meaning of the verse: 

And there is not a single thing but extols His glory and praise.31 

Say,  “Glory  be  to  Him  Who  is  hidden  in  the  intensity  of  His  manifestation.”  And 
understand  one  reason  why  phrases  like  the  following  are  repeatedly  mentioned  at  the 
end of the Qur’an’s verses: 

And  He  is  the  Mighty,  the  Wise.32  *  And  He  is  the  Oft-Forgiving,  Most 
Merciful.33 * And He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.34 

If you are unable to read the Names in a flower and cannot see them clearly, look at 
Paradise, study the spring, watch the face of the earth. You will be able to read clearly the 
Names written there, for they are the huge flowers of mercy. You will be able to see and 
understand their impresses and manifestations.

The Second Point 
of the Second Topic 

When the representative of the people of misguidance could find no support or basis 
on  which  to  build  his  misguidance  and  was  thus  defeated  in  argument,  he  said  the 
following: 

“I  consider  happiness  in  this  world  and  life’s  pleasures,  and  the  progress  of 
civilization  and  perfection  of  arts  as  all  lying  in  refusal  to think  of  the  hereafter  and  to 
know  God,  in  love  of  this  world,  in  absolute  freedom  and  licence  and  in  relying 
exclusively on  myself.  And  in  so doing I  have drawn  most men onto this path, through 
the assistance of Satan, and continue to do so.” 

The  Answer:  We  say,  in  the  name  of  the  Qur’an:  O  wretched  man!  Come  to  your 
senses! Do not listen to the representative of the people of misguidance. If you do listen 
to him, your loss will be so great that your intelligence, spirit, and heart will shudder even 
to imagine it. There are two paths in front of you. 

The First:  The path of wretchedness laid out in front of you by the representative of 

the people of misguidance. 

The Second:  The path of happiness defined for you by the All-Wise Qur’an. 
You will have noted and understood numerous comparisons between these two paths 
in  the  Words,  particularly  the  Short  Words.  So,  note  and  understand  now  one  of  those 
thousands of comparisons which is suitable to this discussion. 

The path of assigning partners to God, misguidance, dissipation and vice causes man 
to fall to the lowest degree. Afflicted with infinite pains, he is forced to bear an infinitely 
heavy load on his weak and powerless shoulders. For if man does not recognize God and 
place  his  trust  in  Him,  he  becomes  extremely  weak  and  impotent,  needy  and 
impoverished,  a  suffering,  grieving  and  ephemeral  animal,  exposed  to  endless 
misfortunes.  Suffering  continuously  the  pain  of  separation  from  all  the  objects  of  love 
and  attachment,  he  will  ultimately  abandon  all  of  his  loved  ones  and  go  alone  to  the 
darkness of the grave. 

Throughout his life, he struggles vainly, with an extremely limited will,  

 

662 

slight power, a short lifespan and dull mind, against infinite pains and hopes. To no avail, 
he strives to attain innumerable desires and goals. 

Even though he  is unable to bear the burden of  his own  being, he takes the  load of 
the  vast  world  onto  his  wretched  shoulders  and  mind.  He  suffers  the  torment  of  Hell 
before even arriving there. 

Indeed, in order to avoid feeling this grievous pain, this awesome spiritual torment, 
the  people  of  misguidance  have  recourse  to  a  drunkenness  that  is  like  a  form  of  stupor 
and thus are temporarily able to avoid  feeling their pain. But when they do  feel  it, they 
suddenly  feel  the  proximity  of  the  grave.  For  whoever  is  not  a  true  bondsman  of  God 
Almighty will imagine that he owns himself. But with his partial and limited will and his 
petty  power  and  strength,  he  is  unable  to  administer  and  control  his  being  in  this 
tempestuous world. He sees thousands of different sorts of enemy attacking his life, from 
harmful  microbes to earthquakes. In an awesome state of painful  fear  he  looks towards 
the door of the grave, that at all times appears dreadful to him. 

While  in  this  state,  man  will  also  be  troubled  by  the  state  of  the  world  and  of 
mankind, for as a human being he is attached to both. But, he does not imagine them to 
be  in the control of One  All-Wise, All-Knowing, All-Powerful, Merciful and Generous, 
and  has attributed them  instead to chance and to nature. And  so, together with  his own 
pains,  he  suffers  also  the  pains  of  the  world  and  of  mankind.  Earthquakes,  plagues, 
storms, famine and scarcity, separation and decease; all of this torments him in the most 
painful and sombre fashion. 

But such a man is not worthy of pity and sympathy, for he himself is responsible for 

it. 

In the Eighth Word is a comparison between two brothers who entered a well. One 
was not content with a refreshing, sweet, reputable, pleasant and licit drink at a splendid 
feast with pleasant friends in a beautiful garden and so drank some ugly and unclean wine 
in  order  to  obtain  illicit  and  impure  pleasure.  He  became  drunk  and  then  imagined 
himself to be in some foul place in the middle of winter surrounded by wild beasts, and 
trembling cried out. 

But  such  a  man  is  not  worthy  of  pity,  for  he  imagined  his  honourable  and  blessed 
companions to be monsters, and thus insulted them. He also imagined the delicious foods 
and  clean  dishes  at  the  feast  to  be  impure  and  filthy  stones  and  began  smashing  them. 
And  the  respected  books  and  profound  writings  there  to  be  meaningless  and  banal 
designs, and so ripped them up and trod on them. 

Such  a  person  is  not  merely  unworthy  of  sympathy,  rather,  he  deserves  a  good 

beating. 

 

663 

In exactly the  same way, a person who, through  incorrect choice  and the  lunacy of 
misguidance,  is  intoxicated  with  unbelief,  imagines  this  hospice  of  the  world,  which 
belongs  to  the  All-Wise  Maker,  to  be  the  plaything  of  chance  and  natural  forces.  He 
fancies the passage of creatures into the World of the Unseen, that is in fact renewing the 
manifestation  of  the  Divine  Names,  to  be  execution  and  annihilation.  He  supposes  the 
echoes of those creatures’ glorification of God, who are accomplishing their duties with 
the passing of time, to be the lamentations of death and eternal separation. He deems the 
pages  of  created  beings,  which  are  inscriptions  of  the  Eternally  Besought  One,  to  be 
meaningless  and  confused.  He  imagines  the  door  of  the  grave,  which  opens  onto  the 
world of  mercy, to be the  entrance to the darkness of  non-existence.  And  he deems the 
appointed hour, which is in reality an invitation to join his true friends, to be the onset of 
separation from all of them. 

Such a person  both brings upon  himself grievous and ghastly torments, and denies, 
denigrates and insults all beings and God’s Names and His inscriptions. He is, therefore, 
not only unworthy of compassion and sympathy but also deserving of severe punishment. 
He is not in any way worthy of pity. 

And so, O wretched people of misguidance and dissipation! What accomplishment of 
yours,  what  art,  what  perfection,  what  civilization,  what  progress,  can  confront  this 
awesome  silence  of  the  grave,  this  crushing  despair?  Where  can  you  find  that  true 
consolation that is the most urgent need of the human spirit? 

What nature, what causality, what partner ascribed by  you to God, what discovery, 
what nationality, what false object of worship, in each of which you place so much trust 
and to which you attribute God’s works and His sustaining bounties, which of them can 
deliver you from the darkness of death that you imagine to be eternal annihilation? Which 
of  them  can  enable  you  to  cross  the  frontiers  of  the  grave,  the  boundaries  of  the 
intermediate realm, the marches of the plain of resurrection, the Bridge of Sirat? Or can 
bring about your eternal happiness? 

But know that most definitely  you will travel on  this path  for  you cannot close the 
door of the grave. And a traveller on such a path ought to rely on one whose control and 
command embraces all this vast sphere and its extensive boundaries. 

O  wretched  people  of  misguidance  and  neglect!  In  accordance  with  the  principles 
that ‘the consequence of an illicit love is suffering a merciless torment,’ you are suffering 
a  fully  justified  punishment,  for  you  are  unlawfully  employing  your  innate  capacity  for 
love,  knowledge,  thanks  and  worship  that  relate  properly  to  the  essence,  attributes  and 
Names of God Almighty, on your own soul and the life of this world. 

 

664 

You  have  lavished  the  love  that  belongs  to  God  Almighty  on  yourself.  Your  own 
soul  has  become  your beloved and will cause  you endless  suffering:  you are  not giving 
true peace to that beloved. You are suffering constantly because you do not hand it over 
to the  Possessor  of  Absolute  Power  Who  is  the  only  true  beloved  and  you  do  not trust 
wholly in Him. 

You suffer further misfortunes because you give to the world the love that belongs to 
God Almighty’s Names and attributes and divide up the works of His art among causes in 
the world. One group of those innumerable beloveds of yours will turn their backs on you 
and leave you without even saying good-bye. Another group will not even recognize you, 
or if they do, they will not love you. Or if they love you, their love will be of no use. You 
will constantly suffer from innumerable separations and farewells without hope of return. 
This,  then,  is  the  essence  and  true  nature  of  what  the  people  of  misguidance  call 
life’s  happiness,  human  perfection,  the  advantages  of  civilization  and  the  pleasure  of 
freedom.  And  dissipation  and  intoxication  are  but  a  veil;  they  temporarily  block  all 
feeling. So, say, “I spit on the intelligence of those who follow such a path.” 

But as for the luminous highway of the Qur’an, it cures with the truths of faith all the 
wounds of the people of misguidance. It disperses all the gloom and darkness of that first 
path. It closes the door on all misguidance and perdition. 

It  cures  man’s  weakness,  powerlessness,  poverty  and  need  with  trust  in  One  All-
Powerful and  Compassionate. For, handing over the  burden of  his  life and  being to His 
power  and  mercy  instead  of  loading  it  on  himself,  man  finds  ease  and  comfort  as  if  he 
were riding on his own life and soul. The Qur’an states that he is not a ‘rational animal’, 
but rather a true man and a well-accepted guest of the All-Merciful One. 

It gently cures man of the wounds inflicted on him by the transience of the world, the 
ephemeral nature of things and the love of them, and delivers him from the darkness of 
delusion  and  fancy.  It  does  this  by  showing  the  world  to  be  a  guest-house  of  the  All-
Merciful  One,  and  the  beings  in  it  to  be  mirrors  to  the  Divine  Names  and  ever-fresh 
inscriptions of the Eternally Besought One. 

It shows death and the appointed hour to be the bridge to the intermediate realm and 
the prelude to joining and meeting beloved ones already in the world of eternity. It thus 
cures  the  wounds  inflicted  by  the  notion  of  death  as  eternal  separation,  as  held  by  the 
people  of  misguidance.  It  demonstrates  that  separation  is  in  fact  the  truest  form  of 
meeting. 

Further, by establishing that the grave is a door opening onto the world of  

 

665 

mercy,  an  abode  of  happiness,  a  garden  of  Paradise,  the  luminous  realm  of  the  All-
Merciful One, it dispels man’s most terrifying fear and shows that the apparently painful, 
troublesome  and  unpleasant  journey  to  the  intermediate  realm  is  in  fact  the  most 
pleasurable, enjoyable and joyous of journeys. With the grave, it shows that the grave is 
not a dragon’s mouth but is, rather, a door opening onto the garden of mercy. 

The  Qur’an  also  says  to  the  believer,  “Since  you  have  only  partial  and  restricted 
choice, hand over your affairs to your Owner’s universal will. Since your power is slight, 
rely on that of the Possessor of Absolute Power. Since your life is brief, think of eternal 
life. Do not fret! There is an unending life. If your mind is dull, let the sun of the Qur’an 
shine on you. Look with the light of belief, and instead of the fire-fly of your own mind, 
each verse of the Qur’an will illumine you like a star. 

“Since  you  have  innumerable  hopes  and  pains,  know  that  infinite  reward  and 
limitless mercy await you. Since you have innumerable desires and aims, do not think of 
them and become disturbed. This world cannot contain them; the proper place for them is 
another realm, and the one who will grant them is one other than yourself.” 

The  Qur’an  also  says,  “O  man!  You  do  not  own  yourself.  Rather,  you  are  totally 
owned  by  One  Whose  power  is  infinite,  an  All-Compassionate  One  of  Glory  Whose 
mercy  is  infinite.  Therefore,  do  not trouble  yourself  by  shouldering  the  burden  of  your 
life, for it is He Who grants you life and administers it. 

“Also, the world is not without an owner. So do not be anxious thinking of the state 
of  it  and  load  that  burden  onto  your  mind,  for  the  world’s  Owner  is  All-Wise  and  All-
Knowing. You are a guest so do not be officious and meddlesome. 

“Furthermore,  creatures  such  as  men  and  animals  have  not  been  left  to  their  own 
devices,  rather,  they  are  all  officials  with  specific  duties.  They  are  watched  over  by  an 
All-Wise and Compassionate One. Do not distress your spirit thinking of their pains and 
afflictions.  Do  not  try  to  be  more  sympathetic  and  kind-hearted  than  their  All-
Compassionate Creator. 

“Also, the reins of all those things that are hostile to you, from microbes to plagues, 
storms,  famine  and  earthquakes,  are  in  the  hands  of  that  All-Compassionate  All-Wise 
One. Being  All-Wise, He does nothing  in  vain. Being  All-Compassionate, His  mercy  is 
superabundant. There is a form of grace and favour contained in everything He does.” 

The Qur’an also says, “This world is indeed ephemeral, nevertheless, it produces the 
necessities for an everlasting world. It is transient and fleeting, but it yields eternal fruits, 
and displays the manifestations of an Eternal  

 

666 

Being’s eternal Names. Its pleasures are indeed few and its pains many, but the favours 
of the All-Merciful and Compassionate One are everlasting and true pleasures. And as for 
the pains of this world, they too yield a sort of pleasure by reason of the reward to be had 
for enduring them. 

“Since the sphere of the  licit  is  sufficient  for all the pleasures, delights and  joys of 
the spirit, heart and soul, do not approach the sphere of the illicit. For one pleasure within 
that  sphere  sometimes  leads  to  a  thousand  pains.  It  will  also  cause  the  loss  of  the  All-
Merciful One’s favours, which are true and lasting pleasures. 

“Furthermore, as described above, illicit pleasure on the path of misguidance causes 
man  to  fall  to the  lowest of  the  low.  Then  no  civilization,  no  philosophy  can  provide  a 
remedy for him, and no human progress and scientific advances can deliver him from that 
deep,  dark  pit.  Whereas,  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  elevates  man,  through  belief  and  good 
deeds, from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high, and demonstrates that it does 
this with  clear proofs.  And  it  fills  in that deep pit with rungs of  inner development and 
spiritual progress. 

“Moreover,  it  facilitates  man’s  long,  stormy  and  troublesome  journey  towards 
eternity. It shows him the means for traversing a distance of a thousand years, or rather of 
fifty thousand years, in a single day. 

“Also,  through  making  known  the  All-Glorious  One,  Who  is  the  Monarch  of  Pre-
Eternity  and  Post-Eternity,  it  confers  on  man  the  position  of  a  bondsman,  guest  and 
official entrusted with specific duties. And it ensures that he travels with the greatest ease 
both  in  the  guest-house  of  this  world  and  in  the  stages  and  stopping-places  of  the 
intermediate realm and the hereafter. 

“A loyal official will travel in his monarch’s kingdom and pass through the frontiers 
of each province with ease, journeying by the fastest means, such as by aeroplane, ship or 
train. So too one who forms a relation with the Pre-Eternal Monarch through belief and 
obeys Him through good works will pass with the speed of lightning or of Buraq through 
the stages of this guest-house of the world, the spheres of the intermediate realm and the 
world  of  resurrection  and  the  extensive  frontiers  of  all  the  realms  that  are  beyond  the 
grave,  until  he  attains  eternal  happiness.”  The  Qur’an  proves  this  truth  decisively  and 
points it out to those who are purified and to the saints. 

The truth of the Qur’an also says, “O believer! Do not give your infinite capacity for 
love to your ugly, defective, evil, and for you, harmful instinctual soul. Do not take it as 
your object of  love and  its whims  as  your object  of worship. Take rather the One  Who 
has  bestowed  on  you  that  infinite  capacity  for  love.  He  will  also  make  you  infinitely 
happy  in the  future, and, through His  bounties, all those to whom  you are  attached and 
whose happiness makes you happy. 

 

667 

“Take for your object of love and worship One Who possesses infinite perfection and 
a beauty that  is  infinitely  sacred, exalted, transcendent, faultless,  flawless and unfading. 
The  beauty  of  His  mercy  and  the  mercy  of  His  beauty  are  demonstrated  by  all  the 
beauties and bounties of Paradise. All of His Names are infinitely beautiful and in each of 
them are abundant lights of fairness and beauty. His beauty and perfection are indicated 
and pointed to by all the  fairness, beauty, virtue and perfection of all  lovable and  loved 
objects in the cosmos.” 

The Qur’an also says, “O man! Do not squander your infinite capacity to love, which 
properly belongs to His Names and attributes, on other transient creatures. For the works 
and  creatures  of  God  are  ephemeral,  but  the  Beautiful  Names,  whose  impress  and 
manifestation  may  be  seen  on  them,  are  eternal  and  permanent.  And  in  each  of  His 
Names and attributes there are thousands of degrees of bounty and beauty, perfection and 
love.  Look  only  at  the  Name  of  All-Merciful:  Paradise  is  a  manifestation  of  it,  eternal 
happiness, a flash of it, and all the sustenance and bounty in the world, a mere drop of it.” 
Consider carefully, then, this  verse which  indicates the true nature of the people of 

misguidance and that of the people of belief, with regard to their lives and duties: 

Verily  We  have  created  man  in  the fairest  of forms,  then  sent  him  down  to  the 
lowest of the low, except for those who believe and do good deeds.35 

And this verse that indicates their final result and outcome: 

The heavens and the earth wept not over them.36 

How sublimely and miraculously they express the comparison we have made. Since the 
truth expressed miraculously and concisely in the first verse is explained in detail in the 
Eleventh Word, we refer our readers to that part of the Risale-i Nur for a discussion of it. 
As  for  the  second  verse,  we  shall  show, through  a  brief  indication,  how  sublime  a 

truth it expresses. It is as follows. 

The explicit meaning of the verse is that the heavens and the earth do not weep when 
the people of misguidance die. The implied meaning is that the heavens and the earth do 
weep when the people of belief depart this world. For the people of misguidance, through 
their denial of the duties and functions of the heavens and earth, their ignorance of their 
meaning, their rejection of their value, their refusal to recognize their Maker, are in fact 
acting insultingly and with hostility toward them. So, of course, the heavens  

                                                

35 Qur’an, 95:4-6. 
36 Qur’an, 44:29. 

 

668 

and earth will not weep over them, but in fact curse them and rejoice at their death. 

As  for the  implied  meaning,  that the  heavens  and  earth  weep  over the  death  of  the 
people  of  belief,  this  is  because  they  know the  duties  and  functions  of  the  heavens  and 
earth,  assent  to  their  true  realities,  and  understand,  through  belief,  the  meanings  they 
express. They say, “How beautifully they have been made, how finely they are carrying 
out their duties.” They respect them and assign them their true worth. They love them and 
the Names they mirror for the sake of God Almighty. And so it is for this reason that the 
heavens and earth grieve over the death of the people of belief as if weeping. 

An Important Question 

You  say,  “Love  is  not  voluntary.  And,  as  a  consequence  of  innate  need,  I  love 
delicious foods and fruits. I love my father, mother and children, my wife, and my friends 
and companions. I love the prophets and the saints. And I love my life and my youth, the 
spring, beautiful things and the world. How may I not love these things? So how should I 
rather give all this love to God Almighty’s essence, attributes and Names? What does this 
mean? 

The Answer:  Listen to four ‘Points’. 

FIRST POINT 

Indeed, love is not voluntary, but by means of the will love’s face may turn from one 
object of love to another. For example, when a beloved displays some ugliness or shows 
that he is a veil or mirror to another beloved, who is truly worthy of love, then love’s face 
may be turned from the metaphorical to the true beloved. 

SECOND POINT 

We do not tell you not to love the things you enumerated, but rather to love them for 
God Almighty’s sake and in the name of His love. For example, to love delicious foods 
and  luscious  fruits  as  being  the  bounty  of  God  Almighty,  the  All-Merciful  and 
Compassionate  One,  is  to  love  His  Names  of  All-Merciful  and  Bestower  of  Bounties, 
and,  moreover,  takes  on  the  meaning  of  thanks.  This  love  is  to  seek  gain  contentedly 
within the sphere of the licit, which shows that it is not only for the sake of the instinctual 
soul  but  is  in  the  name  of  the  All-Merciful  One.  It  is  to  eat  thoughtfully  and  with 
gratitude. 

Furthermore,  love  and  respect  for  parents,  when  for  the  sake  of  the  wisdom  and 
mercy that compassionately fitted you out and caused them to bring you up with tender 
care, pertain to God Almighty’s love. The sign that this love, respect and compassion are 
for God’s sake is that when they are old  

 

669 

and  are  of  no  more  use  to  you  and  bring  you  only  trouble  and  difficulty,  you  are  even 
more loving, kind and compassionate towards them. The verse, 

Should one of them, or both, attain to old age in your care, never say to them a 
word of contempt,37 

summons  children  to  respect  and  be  kind  to  their  parents  in  five  degrees,  and 
demonstrates how important are the rights of parents in the eyes of the Qur’an, and how 
ugly ingratitude towards them. 

A  father  desires  only  his  son,  and  no  one  else,  to  be  much  better  than  himself, 
however, the son cannot claim any rights over his father in return for this. That is to say, 
there is no inherent cause for dispute between parents and child. This is because dispute 
arises from envy and jealousy and there is nothing of this in the father towards his son. Or 
it arises from abuse of rights and the son has no rights that he can claim against his father. 
If he considers his father to be unjust, he may not rebel against him. That is to say, one 
who  does  rebel  against  his  father  and  cause  him  pain  is  a  monster,  a  corrupted  human 
being. 

And,  to  love  and  protect  children  with  perfect  compassion  and  tenderness  because 
they  are  gifts  of  the  All-Compassionate  and  Generous  One  once  again  pertains  to  God. 
The sign indicating that that love is for Almighty God’s sake is patience and thankfulness 
should  they  die,  rather  than  crying  out  in  despair.  It  is  to  say,  “He  was  a  lovable  little 
being created and owned by my Creator, Who entrusted him to my supervision. Now that 
His wisdom requires it to be thus, He has taken him from me, taken him to a better place. 
If I had one apparent share in that little creature, a thousand true shares belonged to his 
Creator.” It is to submit saying, “All authority is with God.” 

As  for friends and acquaintances,  if they are  friends of God Almighty  by reason of 
their belief and good works, according to the meaning of ‘love for God’s sake,’ that love, 
too, pertains to God. 

Furthermore,  love  and  cherish  your  wife  as  a  companionable  and  gracious  gift  of 
divine  mercy.  But  do  not  fasten  your  love  to  her  physical  beauty,  which  swiftly  fades. 
Rather,  woman’s  most  attractive  and  agreeable  beauty  is  the  fineness  of  character  that 
accompanies  the  delicacy  and  refinement  peculiar to  her.  As  for  her  most  precious  and 
sweet beauty, it is her earnest, sincere, sublime and luminous compassion. This beautiful 
tenderness  and  fineness  of  character  continues  and  increases  until  the  end  of  her  days. 
Moreover,  that  weak  and  delicate  creature’s  rights  of  respect  will  be  protected  by  that 
love. Otherwise, when her superficial beauty fades the poor woman will lose her rights, 
even when she most needs them. 

                                                

37 Qur’an, 17:23. 

 

670 

And to love the prophets and saints as God Almighty’s most esteemed bondsmen is 
to do so for the  sake  and  in the  name of God  Almighty, and  from that point of  view  it 
pertains to Him. 

And  to  love  and  preserve  life  as  most  precious  wealth  and  capital  that  will  gain 
eternal  life,  and  a  comprehensive  treasury  yielding  eternal  perfections  which  Almighty 
God has given to you and to all humanity, and to employ it in His service, is, once again, 
in one respect, love that pertains to the True Object of Worship. 

Also, to admire, love and put to proper use the grace and beauty of youth as being a 

fine, sweet and beautiful bounty of Almighty God is a sort of licit and thankful love. 

And  to  love  the  spring  thoughtfully  as  being  the  page  of  the  subtlest  and  most 
beautiful  inscriptions  of  Almighty  God’s  luminous  Names  and  the  most  finely  adorned 
and glittering exhibition of the All-Wise Maker’s antique art is to love His Names. 

And to love this world as being the tillage for the hereafter, as a mirror of the Divine 
Names and a missive of God Almighty, and as a temporary guest-house, on condition that 
the evil-commanding soul does not interfere, is to do so for God Almighty’s sake. 

In  short:  Love  this  world  and  the  creatures  in  it  as  pointing  to  a  meaning  beyond 
themselves,  like  a  word.  Do  not  love  them  just  for  themselves.  Say,  “How  beautifully 
they  have  been  made.”  Do  not  say,  “How  beautiful  they  are.”  Do  not  give  any 
opportunity  to  other  loves  to  enter  into  your  inner  heart  because  the  inner  heart  is  the 
mirror of  the  Eternally  Besought  One  and  pertains  only  to  Him.  Say,  “O  God,  grant  us 
love for You, and love for that which will draw us closer to You.”38 

Thus,  if  in  this  form,  all  the  loves  that  you  have  enumerated  will  give  a  pain-free 
pleasure,  and,  in  one  respect,  an  unending  union.  Moreover,  they  will  increase  love  of 
God. They are licit loves. And are, furthermore a sort of gratitude which is pure pleasure, 
and thought, which is pure love. 

For example, if a mighty king39 were to bestow an apple on you, there would be two 
loves for that apple and two pleasures in it. The first of these is that the apple would be 
loved because it is an apple, and there would be a pleasure peculiar to and to the extent of 
the  apple.  This  love  does  not  concern  the  king.  On  the  contrary,  the  man  who  puts  the 
apple  to  his  mouth  and  eats  it  in  the  king’s  presence  loves  the  apple  itself  and  his  own 
soul rather than the king. It sometimes happens that the king is not pleased with that  

                                                

38 Kanz al-‘Ummal, i, 195; Waliuddin Tabrizi, Mishkat al-Masabih,i, 762. 
39 Once two tribal chiefs entered the presence of a king. They were in exactly the same situation as is 

described here. 

 

671 

love  which  nourishes  the  instinctual  soul;  in  fact,  he  detests  it.  Moreover,  the  pleasure 
that the apple gives is very limited and passes quickly. After the apple is eaten it is gone, 
only regret remains. 

As for the second love, it is for the royal favour that is demonstrated by means of the 
apple. One who holds the apple precious as  if  it  were the sample and embodiment of  a 
royal favour shows that he loves his king. Moreover, the pleasure in that fruit, which is a 
sort of  container  for  the  favour,  is  such  that  it  is  far  greater  than  the  pleasure  obtained 
from a thousand apples. This pleasure, then, is the essence of thankfulness. This love is a 
respectful love for the king. 

In exactly the  same way,  if  all  bounties and  fruits are  loved  for themselves,  if they 
are thoughtlessly delighted in only for the material pleasures that they yield, that love is 
merely  love  of  self.  Also,  those  pleasures  are  transient  and  bring  pain.  But,  if  they  are 
loved  as  favours  proceeding  from  Almighty  God’s  mercy  and  as  fruits  of  His 
munificence, and if pleasure is obtained from them with good appetite by appreciating the 
degree  of  kindness  in  that  munificence  and  favour,  then  it  has  both  the  meaning  of 
gratitude and is a pain-free pleasure. 

THIRD POINT 

There  are  levels  in  the  love  for  God  Almighty’s  Names.  As  we  explained  above, 
sometimes the Names are loved with a love for finely made objects. Sometimes they are 
loved as being titles of the Divine perfections. Sometimes, man is needy and desirous of 
the Names by reason of the comprehensiveness of his true nature together with his having 
endless needs. It is through those needs that he loves. 

For  example,  if  someone  were  to  come  forward  and  do  a  kindness  to  all  your 
relations,  and  the  poor,  the  weak  and  the  needy,  for  all  of  whom  you  feel  sympathy 
although you are powerless to meet their need for help, how that person’s favour-granting 
title and generous name would please you, how you would love that person through that 
title. 

So  too,  think  only  of  God  Almighty’s  Names  of  All-Merciful  and  Compassionate. 
They  make  happy  all  the  believing  fathers  and  forefathers,  relations  and  friends  whom 
you  love and  feel sympathy  for, in this world  by  means of all kinds of  bounties, and  in 
Paradise  by  means  of  all  kinds  of  delights.  They  cause  happiness  by  showing  you  in 
eternal bliss to them, and them in eternal bliss to you. So how deserving of being loved is 
the  Name  of  All-Merciful  and  the  title  of  All-Compassionate.  And  you  can  see  for 
yourself  just  how  needy  for  those  two  Names  is  the  human  spirit.  And  you  can 
understand just how appropriate is the phrase, ‘Praise be to God for His mercifulness and 
His compassionateness.’ 

 

672 

You are connected to the world and as a result are afflicted by its wretchedness, so if 
you consider carefully, you may understand just how needy and desirous is your spirit for 
the Name of All-Wise and for the title of Nurturer. For the Owner of those Names orders, 
regulates  and  sustains  with  perfect  wisdom  the  world,  which  is  like  a  sort of  house  for 
you, and the creatures within it, which are its familiar furniture and lovable decorations. 

And you are altogether connected to other human beings and grieve when they die. 
So,  if  you  consider  carefully,  you  may  understand  just  how  needy  is  your  spirit  for  the 
Names  of  Inheritor  and  Resurrector,  and  for  the  titles  Eternal,  All-Generous,  Giver  of 
Life, and Munificent. For the Owner of these Names saves human beings at the time of 
their death  from the darkness of  non-existence  and establishes them  in  a  far  finer place 
than this world. 

Thus, since man’s nature is exalted and his disposition comprehensive, he is, by his 
very nature, needy with thousands of different sorts of needs for the innumerable Divine 
Names, each of which has many degrees. Intensified need is longing. Intensified longing 
is  love.  And  intensified  love  is  passion.  As  the  spirit  is  perfected,  the  degrees  of  love 
unfold according to the degrees of the Names. Furthermore, since the Names are the titles 
and manifestations of the One of Glory, love of them will be transformed into love of the 
Divine Essence. 

Now,  just  as  an  example,  we  shall  explain  one  of  the  innumerable  degrees  of  the 
Names of  All-Just, All-Wise, Truth, and  All-Merciful. If  you wish to see the Names of 
All-Merciful  and  Compassionate,  and  Truth  within  wisdom  and  justice  to  the  utmost 
extent, consider the following comparison. 

Let us suppose there  is  an army  in which there  are  four hundred different sections. 
And the uniforms that each section prefers are different, the provisions that please them, 
the weapons they will carry with ease and the medicines to cure their particular ills are all 
different. Furthermore, rather than  being  separated  into squads and  companies, they  are 
all intermingled. 

If  the  peerless  and  single  king,  then,  out  of  perfect  compassion  and  solicitude, 
wonderful  power,  miraculous  all-embracing  knowledge  and  extraordinary  justice  and 
wisdom,  without  confusing  or  forgetting  any  of  them  were  himself,  in  person,  without 
helper,  to  give  all  of  them  their  completely  different  though  appropriate  uniforms, 
provisions,  medicines and weapons, would  you not see what a powerful, solicitous, just 
and generous personage that king was.  For if there were individuals from ten nations in 
one  battalion,  it  would  be  extremely  difficult  to  clothe  and  equip  them  all  differently. 
Whatever people they were from they would of necessity have to be fitted out in the same 
way. 

 

673 

Similarly,  if  you  wish  to  see  the  manifestation  of  the  Names  of  Truth  and  All-
Merciful and Compassionate within the justice and wisdom of God Almighty, look at the 
plant and animal armies comprising four hundred thousand magnificent nations with their 
tents pitched on the face of the earth in springtime. For those groups and sections are all 
one  within  the  other.  And  the  uniform  of  each  one  is  different,  and  the  provisions, 
weapons, way of life, drill and demobilization are all different. Furthermore, they do not 
have the power to provide  for those needs and the tongues to ask  for those wishes. So, 
watch  and  see  the  titles  of  Truth,  All-Merciful,  Provider,  Compassionate  and  Generous 
together  with  order  and  equilibrium  within  the  sphere  of  wisdom  and  justice.  See  how, 
without  confusing,  obscuring  or  forgetting  any  of  them,  He  sustains,  regulates  and 
administers them all. 

Could  another  hand,  therefore,  interfere  in  a  matter  performed  with  such  amazing 
and  all-encompassing  order  and  balance?  What,  apart  from  the  One  Who  is  Single  and 
Unique,  Absolutely  Wise,  and  Powerful  over  all  things,  could  even  stretch  out  its  hand 
towards  this  art,  this  organizing,  this  sustaining,  this  administering?  What  cause  could 
interfere? 

FOURTH POINT 

You ask: “So long as they are  in the  form that the Qur’an commands, what are the 
results  and  benefits  of  all  my  different  and  various  loves?  That  is,  my  love  for  food, 
myself,  my  wife,  parents  and  children,  my  friends,  the  saints,  the  prophets,  beautiful 
things, the spring and this world?” 

The Answer: It would be necessary to write a thick book in order to explain all the 
results. For now only one or two results will be briefly alluded to. Firstly, the immediate 
results  in  this  world  will  be  explained,  then  those  that  will  become  apparent  in  the 
hereafter will be mentioned. 

As  was  explained  above,  loves  such  as  those  of  the  people  of  neglect  and  those 
attached  to  this  world,  that  are  for  the  sake  of  the  evil-commanding  soul,  bring  many 
tribulations,  and  much  pain  and  suffering  in  this  world.  While  the  ease,  pleasures  and 
enjoyment they bring are little and few. 

For example, compassion becomes a painful calamity on account of impotence. Love 
becomes a calamitous misfortune on account of separation. Pleasure becomes a poisoned 
cup  on  account  of  its  transience.  And  in  the  hereafter,  because  they  were  not  for  God 
Almighty’s  sake,  they  will  either  be  without  benefit  or  will  be  torment.  (If  they  were 
illicit.) 

Question: How might love for the prophets and saints be without benefit? 
The  Answer:  In  the  same  way  that  the  love  of  the  Christians  for  Jesus  (Peace  be 
upon  him),  and  the  heretics  for  ‘Ali  (May  God  be  pleased  with  him)  remain  without 
benefit. If that love is in the form that the Qur’an  

 

674 

directs, for God Almighty’s sake and in the name of the All-Merciful One’s love, then it 
has favourable results both in this world and in the hereafter. 

Now,  to  return  to  our  subject,  the  results  in  this  world  of  your  love  for  delicious 
foods and luscious fruits will be that they are a pain-free bounty and a pleasure that is the 
essence of gratitude. 

Your  love  of  your  instinctual  soul.  The  result  will  be  pity  it,  to  train  it,  and  to 
prevent harmful desires. Then the soul will not ride you, it will not make you a prisoner 
of its desires, rather, you will ride it. You will drive your soul, not to whims and fancies, 
but to right-guidance. 

Your love for your wife. Since it will be built on her being a mine of tenderness, a 
gift of compassion and on her fineness of character, if you have sincere love and affection 
for her, she too will  have earnest  love and respect for you. As the two of  you approach 
old  age  these  sentiments  will  increase,  you  will  pass  your  life  happily.  But  if  it  is 
otherwise,  if  it  is  love of a pretty  face and  for the sake of the  instinctual  soul, then that 
love will be quickly destroyed and so too will be good relations. 

Your love for your father and mother. Since it will be for God Almighty’s sake, it 
will  be  both  worship  and  the  older  they  grow  the  more  your  love  and  respect  for  them 
will  increase. If  you earnestly desire and pray, with the  noblest of sentiments and  most 
manly  zeal,  that  they  will  live  far  into  old  age,  and  even  kiss  their  hands  with  sincere 
respect and say, “Let me gain even more reward on their account”, it will obtain for you a 
most elevated pleasure of the spirit. But if it is otherwise, and for the sake of the soul and 
this world, when they grow old and approach the time of becoming a burden for you, if 
you show them, with the most base and despicable sentiment, that they are a nuisance and 
then wish for the deaths of those respected people, who were the cause of your life, it will 
be savage and grievous pain for the spirit. 

Your love for your children. As for love for those lovable, friendly creatures whom 
God Almighty entrusts to your supervision and upbringing, it will be a most happy love, 
a  most  happy  bounty.  Neither  shall  you  suffer  too  much  pain  at  their  misfortunes,  nor 
shall  you cry out with despair at their deaths.  As  was stated above  you will say,  “Since 
their Creator is both All-Wise and Compassionate, as far as they are concerned, that death 
is  happiness.”  Moreover,  concerning  yourself,  you  will  think  of  the  mercifulness  of  the 
One Who gave them to you and you will be saved from the pain of separation. 

Your  love  for  your  friends.  Since  it  is  for  God’s  sake,  because  separation  from 
those friends, and even their deaths, will not be an obstacle to your conversing and your 
brotherhood, you will benefit from that immaterial love and relation of the spirit. And the 
pleasure of meeting will be permanent. If it is not for the sake of God, the pleasure of one 
day’s meeting will result in  

 

675 

the pain of a hundred days’ separation.40 

Your love for the prophets and saints. Since the intermediate realm, which seems 
to  the  people  of  neglect  to  be  a  dark,  lonely  and  desolate  place,  appears  to  you  as  a 
stopping-place  illuminated  by  the  presence  of  those  luminous  beings,  the  fact  that  you 
will go there will not induce terror and fright, but, on the contrary, an inclination towards 
it and a feeling of longing; it will not drive away the pleasure of worldly life. 

But if it is otherwise, if love for the prophets and saints is of the same sort as the love 
of the subscribers to modern culture for their  idols and  heroes, on thinking of the death 
and disappearance of those perfect human beings and of their rotting in that mighty grave 
known as the past, it will add one more sorrow to lives that are already painful. That is to 
say, each will say to himself, “I too will end up in the grave, which rots even such perfect 
men.” 

Whereas, when they are seen  from the  first point of  view, they are thought of with 
complete ease of mind, for they have discarded the clothes of their bodies in the past and 
now  their  dwelling-place  is  the  intermediate  realm,  which  is  the  waiting-room  for  the 
future. And the graveyard will be seen as having a familiarity and friendliness. 

Your  love  for beautiful things. Since  it  is  for the sake of the One  Who  fashioned 
them,  it will  be  in the  manner of,  “How beautifully they  have  been  made.” This  love  is 
pleasurable thought and it causes the gaze of beauty-worshipping delight to see the more 
elevated  and  holy  and  thousand  times  more  beautiful  treasures  of  the  degrees  of  God’s 
beauty.  This  love  opens  up  a  way  to  these  treasures  because  it  transfers  the  eye  from 
those beautiful works to the beauty of the Divine actions. And it opens a way from them 
to the beauty of the Names, and from them to the beauty of the attributes, and from them 
to the One of Glory’s peerless beauty; it opens a way to the heart. Thus, if this love is in 
this form, it is both pleasurable, and it is worship, and it is thought. 

Your love of youth. Since you have loved it as a beautiful bounty of God Almighty, 
you  have,  of  course,  done  so  in  worship,  you  have  not  drowned  it  in  dissipation  and 
destroyed it. Since this is the case, the worship you have gained during your youth is the 
undying fruit of that transient state. As you grow older, because you will have obtained 
the enduring fruits that are the positive aspect of youth, you will have been saved from its 
harm and excesses. 

Also,  in  old  age  you  will  see  that  you  have  achieved  success  in  performing  more 
worship,  and  so  will  be  more  worthy  to  receive  Divine  mercy.  Unlike  the  people  of 
neglect, you will not feel sadness for the pleasures of  

                                                

second. 

40 One second’s meeting for God’s sake is a year. Whereas, if it is for the sake of this world, a year is a 

 

676 

youth that  lasted five or ten  years, then wail  for  fifty  years,  “Alas,  my  youth  has  fled!” 
Neither will you be like one of them who said, “If only my youth would return one day, I 
would tell it of the woes old age has brought me.” 

Your love for finely adorned exhibitions like the spring. Since it is in the form of 
contemplating Divine artistry, when the spring ends the pleasure of the spectacle does not 
fade.  For  the  meanings  that  the  spring  delivers,  like  a  gilded  missive,  may  be 
contemplated all the time. Both your  imagination and time are  like  films  in the cinema, 
they  both  cause  the  pleasure  of  that  contemplation  to  continue  for  you,  and they  renew 
the spring’s meanings and beauties. Your love, therefore, cannot be temporary and full of 
regret and pain. Rather, it will be full of pleasure and enjoyment. 

Your  love  of  this  world.  Since  it  is  in  the  name  of  God  Almighty,  the  formidable 
creatures of this world will be like familiar friends for you. Since you love it as the tillage 
for the hereafter, you will be able to find in everything capital or a fruit that will produce 
benefits in the hereafter. Neither will its disasters frighten you, nor will its transience and 
ephemerality trouble you. You will pass your sojourn in this guest-house with the greatest 
of ease. But should  you  love  it as the people of  neglect do, then as we  have told  you a 
hundred times, you will drown and perish in a fruitless love, condemned to a depressing, 
crushing and suffocating transitoriness. 

Thus we  have  shown only one subtle point out of  hundreds  from each of the  loves 
you enumerated, when they are in the form that the Qur’an directs. We indicated too one 
hundredth of the  harm they cause  if they are  not in this  way. Now,  if  you want to hear 
and  understand  the  results  of  these  loves  in  the  eternal  realm,  in  the  world  of  the 
hereafter,  the  results  to  which  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  points  with  its  clear  and  distinct 
verses, then we shall show briefly by  means of an Introduction and nine Indications the 
results and one hundredth of the benefits of those various licit loves in the hereafter. 

AN INTRODUCTION 

God  Almighty,  with  His  glorious  Divinity,  His  beautiful  mercy,  His  mighty 
dominicality,  His  generous  benevolence,  His  immense  power,  and  His  subtle  wisdom, 
has  equipped  and  adorned  tiny  man  with  many  senses  and  feelings,  limbs  and  systems, 
members and faculties, and subtle and immaterial aspects so that through them He might 
cause man to perceive, know, taste and recognize the limitless varieties and levels of His 
bounty, munificence and mercy; and so that, through these tools, He might cause man to 
ponder over, know and love the endless kinds of manifestations of His thousand and one 
Names. Just as each of man’s great many members and faculties performs a completely 
different  service  and  worship,  so  too  does  each  of  them  have  completely  different 
pleasures, pains, duties and rewards. 

For example, the eye beholds the beauty of forms and the varieties of the  

 

677 

beautiful  miracles of power  in the world of things seen. Its duty, taking  its  lesson  from 
these, is gratitude to its Maker. The pleasures and pains peculiar to sight are known, there 
is no need to enlarge upon them. 

And, for example, the ear perceives the various sorts of sounds and their melodious 
songs, and the subtle instances of God Almighty’s mercy in the world of things heard. Its 
worship, pleasures and rewards are all different. 

And, for example, the sense of smell perceives the subtle instances of mercy within 
the  realm  of  scents.  It  has  a  duty  of  gratitude  and  pleasure  peculiar  to  itself.  And,  of 
course, it has a reward, too. 

And, for example, the sense of taste, in the tongue; through appreciating all the tastes 
of  foods,  it  performs  its  duty  with  a  truly  diverse  thankfulness;  and  so  on.  All  man’s 
faculties, including his important subtle aspects such as the heart, intellect and spirit, have 
quite distinct duties, pleasures and pains. 

Thus, God Almighty, the Possessor of Absolute Wisdom, will certainly give suitable 
recompense to each one of those faculties, which He employs in human beings. Everyone 
may perceive with his conscience the immediate results in this world of those numerous 
varieties of love, as was explained above, and they may be confirmed through experience. 
As for the results in the hereafter, their existence and reality have been conclusively, 
through briefly, proved by the decisively clear Twelve Truths of the Tenth Word, and by 
the six self-evident Fundamental Points of the Twenty-Ninth Word. They are also clearly 
demonstrated in detail by the distinct verses and the explanations, allusions, symbols and 
indications  of  the  All-Wise  Qur’an,  which  is,  ‘The  most  truthful  of  all  words,  most 
eloquent  in  its  order,  the  Word  of  God  –  The  Lord,  The  Mighty,  The  All-Knowing.’ 
There is no need to present more extensive proofs. In any case, there are further proofs in 
other Words: in the Second Station of the Twenty-Eighth Word, which is about Paradise 
and is in Arabic, and in the Twenty-Ninth Word. 

First  Indication:  According  to  the  Qur’an,  the  result  in  the  hereafter  of  licit  and 
thankful love for delicious foods and fruits is again delicious food and fruit, but in a form 
appropriate for Paradise. This licit love desires those foods and fruits of the hereafter. So 
much so that when you utter the phrase  ‘Praise be to God’ over the fruit you eat in this 
world, it will be embodied as a fruit of Paradise and presented to you there. Here you eat 
fruit, while there you will eat ‘Praise be to God’. 

Since you see Divine munificence and the All-Merciful One’s favours in bounty and 
food, as is established by Hadith, the indications of the Qur’an, and the requirements of 
wisdom and mercy that that pleasurable  

 

678 

gratitude will be given to you in Paradise in the form of a truly delicious food.41 

Second  Indication:  Licit  love  for  your  instinctual  soul  in  this  world  is  not  a  love 
built on its good qualities, but rather one that sees its short-comings and trains it with a 
compassion that seeks to perfect it, and that impels it towards good. This love results in 
giving to the soul objects of love worthy of it in Paradise. 

As  is explicitly  stated and proved by a great number of  verses  in the Qur’an, when 
the soul utilises  its desires and wishes correctly and  employs  its  faculties and senses  in 
the best way in this world, that is, in the way of God Almighty, as a result of this licit and 
worshipful  love  the  Absolutely  Generous  One  will  bestow on  it  houris  in  Paradise,  the 
everlasting  realm.  He  will  clothe  these  houris  in  seventy  varieties  of  the  finery  of 
Paradise.  He  will  adorn  their  beings  with  seventy  kinds  of  beauty  that  will  carress  and 
gratify all the senses of the soul. Each houri will be like a miniature animated Paradise. 

Furthermore,  your  love  of  youth  in  this  world,  that  is,  the  result  of  expending  the 

power of youth in worship, will be eternal youth in the realm of bliss. 

Third  Indication:  Licit  love  for  your  wife  in  this  world  is  sincere  love  in 
consequence  of  her  delicate  tenderness,  fine  virtues  and  good  character,  together  with 
your  protecting  her  from  disobeying  God  obstinately  and  sinning.  The  Absolutely 
Merciful One  has promised that as a result of this  licit  love  your wife shall  be given to 
you  as  an  eternal  wife  in  the  hereafter,  the  realm  of  bliss.  She  will  be  in  a  form  more 
beautifully  adorned  and  attractive  than  the  Houris.  You  will  relate  to  one  another  in 
delight your former adventures in the world, bringing to mind old memories. She will be 
an  intimate, gracious and eternal  friend, who loves and  is  beloved. And,  most certainly, 
that which He promises shall definitely be given. 

Fourth Indication: The result of licit love for parents and children is this. According 
to the Qur’an, the Most Merciful of the Merciful will bestow on that happy family, even 
though their stations may be quite different, the pure pleasure of each other’s company in 
the everlasting realm. 

He will return children who die before reaching the age of fifteen years, that is, the 
age  of  puberty,  once  more  to  the  embrace  of  their  fathers  and  mothers,  in  a  manner 
appropriate to Paradise. They will be most beautifully adorned and lovable, in the form of 
the children of Paradise, who are known  

                                                

41 Baghawi, Masabih al-Sunna, iii, 197;  Musnad, iii, 439;  Ibn Maja, ii, 1093, No: 3285. 

 

679 

as immortal youths.42 He will gratify their child-cherishing sentiments and will give them 
that  pleasure  and  delight  eternally.  Since  those  children  had  not  reached  the  age  of 
responsibility, they will remain eternally as lovable and sweet children. 

Every pleasurable thing  in this world will  be  found  in  its  highest  form  in Paradise. 
Some people surmise that since Paradise is not appropriate for reproduction, there will be 
none of this cherishing of children, which is so sweet, that is, the pleasure of loving and 
carressing them. But it will be there too and in the most delightful and sweet form. This 
then is good news for those whose children die before puberty. 

Fifth Indication: The result of love for righteous friends in this world, according to 
the  decree  of,  ‘Love  for  God’s  sake’  is,  as  the  Qur’an  states,  Facing  one  another  on 
thrones of happiness.43 God Almighty will seat them on the chairs of Heaven facing one 
another. He will cause them to meet with their friends, pleasantly, agreeably and sweetly. 
They will enjoy themselves recounting their old memories and adventures in this world, 
with a pure love and companionship that will not be subject to separation. 

Sixth  Indication:  The  result  of  love  for  the  prophets  and  saints  is  as  the  Qur’an 
explains.  That  is,  it  will  be  both  to  benefit  in  the  intermediate  world  and  at  the 
resurrection  from  the  intercession  of  the  prophets  and  saints,  and  also  to  profit 
abundantly, through that love, from the station and blessings that befit them. 

Indeed,  according  to  the  meaning  of  ‘a  person  will  be  together  with  whom  he 
loves,’44  an  ordinary  man  may  approach  the  highest  station  by  following  an  exalted 
person whom he loves. 

Seventh Indication: The result of licit love for beautiful things and the spring. That 
is, to see with the eye of, ‘how beautifully they have been made,’ and to love the beauty 
and order of the acts, which lie behind those works of art. To love the manifestations of 
the Beautiful Names, which lie behind the order and harmony of the actions, and to love 
the manifestations of the attributes behind those Beautiful Names. And so on. 

The result will  be to see in Paradise, the everlasting realm, the  manifestation of the 
Names, and the beauty and attributes within the Names, in a form a thousand times more 
beautiful than the beautiful creatures to be seen here.  

                                                

42 Qur’an, 76:19, 56:17. 
43 Qur’an, 15:47, 37:44. 
44 See, page 515, footnote 4. 

 

680 

More than  this  even,  Imam  Rabbani  (May  God  be  pleased  with  him)  said,  “The  subtle 
exquisiteness of Paradise will be the similitude of the manifestation of God’s Names.”45  
Just think of it! 

Eighth Indication: The result in the hereafter of thoughtful love in this world for the 
two beautiful faces of the world, which are the tillage for the hereafter and the mirror of 
the Divine Names. An everlasting Paradise will be given that is as large as the world but 
is  not  ephemeral  and  transient  like  this  world.  And  the  Names,  only  pale  shadows  of 
which  are  shown  in  this  world,  will  be  displayed  in  the  mirror  of  Paradise  in  a  most 
brilliant form. 

Moreover,  the  result  of  loving  the  world  as  being  the  tillage  of  the  hereafter  is  as 
follows. When the world is seen thus, that is, as a seed-bed or small place of cultivation 
that  produces  only  shoots,  it  results  in  a  Paradise  where  those  shoots  burgeon  and 
blossom. For in this world man’s senses and faculties are tiny shoots and in Paradise they 
will unfold in the most perfect form. And his abilities, which are here like tiny seeds, will 
be  given  to  him  there  in  a  form  that  will  blossom  with  all  sorts  of  delights  and 
perfections.  This  is  proved  by  the  indications  of  the  Qur’an  and  by  Hadith,  and  is 
necessitated by mercy and wisdom. 

For it  is  not blameworthy  love of the world, which  is the source of every  fault, but 
love of its two faces that look to God’s Names and to the hereafter, and is for the sake of 
the Names and the  hereafter. It is to cultivate those  faces with thoughtful worship, as  if 
taking  the  whole  world  as  the  means  for  worship.  It  is,  therefore,  most  definitely 
necessitated  by  mercy and wisdom that a reward should  be given that  is as  large as the 
world. And, one who through  love of the hereafter, has  loved  its seed-bed, and through 
love of  Almighty God, has  loved the  mirror of His Names, will  most certainly  desire  a 
beloved like the world, and that too will be a Paradise as great as the world. 

Question: What is the use of such a vast and empty Paradise? 
Answer: If it was possible for you to travel with speed of imagination round all the 
regions of the earth and most of the stars, you would be able to say, “The whole universe 
is  mine.” The  fact that the angels, other human  beings and the animals share the  world 
with you would not quash your claim. In the same way, if Paradise is thus full, you would 
be  able  to  say,  “Paradise  is  mine.”  The  meaning  of  the  Hadith,  A  five  hundred  year 
Paradise will  be given to some of those  in Paradise, has  been explained  in the Twenty-
Eighth Word and the Twentieth Flash, the Treatise on Sincerity. 

Ninth Indication: The result of faith and love of God. It is proved by the consensus 

of the

681 

people  of  unveiling  and  verification,  by  certain  Hadith,46  and  by  the  Qur’an  that  a 
thousand years of happy life in this world is not worth one hour of life in Paradise, and 
that a thousand years of heavenly life is not worth one hour’s vision and contemplation of 
the All-Glorious One, Who possesses incomparable beauty and perfection.  

Everyone  may  perceive  in  his  conscience  a  great  longing  for  the  vision  of  a 
personage famous for his magnificence and perfection, like the Prophet Solomon (Peace 
be  upon  him),  and  a  great  yearning  to  behold  a  personage  distinguished  by  his  beauty, 
like the Prophet Joseph (Peace be upon him). And so, if you can, compare how longed-
for,  sought  after,  and  desire-arousing  is  the  vision  of  One,  one  manifestation  of  Whose 
beauty and perfection are all the virtues and perfections of Paradise, which are thousands 
of times more elevated than all the virtues and perfections of this world. 

O God, bestow upon us in this  world love for You and love for that  which  will 
draw us closer to You, and the right-guidedness that You have commanded, and, 
in the next world Your mercy and the vision of You. 

Glory be unto You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught us; 
You are indeed All-Knowing, All-Wise.47 

O God, grant blessings and peace to the one  whom You sent as a mercy to all 
the worlds, and to all his Family and Companions. Amen. 

Reminder 

Do  not  consider  over-lengthy  the  detailed  explanations  in  the  last  section  of  this 

Word; they are short in relation to their importance and require further explanation. 

It  is  not  I  who  speaks  in  any  of  the  Words;  it  is  reality  in  the  name  of 
‘INDICATIONS FROM THE QUR’AN.’  As  for reality,  it speaks the truth. Should  you 
see anything incorrect, then you can be certain that without my being aware of it my own 
ideas interfered and caused the error. 

                                                

46 Included in the Hadith is the following: “That vision far surpasses all the other delights of Paradise, 
so much so that it causes them to be forgotten. And after the vision the loveliness and beauty of those who 
experience it will have increased to such a degree that when they return, it will be only with difficulty and 
scrutiny that their families in their mansions will recognize them.”*

Supplication 

O God!  When a  man knocks on the door of a grand palace and  it  is  not opened to 
him, he knocks on it and calls out in the voice of someone who is familiar to the palace, 
so that it may be opened. Thus this wretched one knocks on the door of the Court of Your 
Mercy crying out in the  voice of Your well-loved servant Uvays al-Qarani and with  his 
supplication. Open that Court of Yours to  me, as  you opened  it to him! I cry out as  he 
did: 

O  God!  You  are  our  Sustainer,  for  we  are  mere  slaves;  we  are  powerless  to 
sustain and raise ourselves. That is to say, the One Who sustains us is You! It is 
You Who is the Creator, for we are creatures, we are being made! It is You Who 
is the  Provider, for  we are in need of provision,  we have no power! That is to 
say, the One One Who creates us and bestows on us our provisions is You! It is 
You Who is the Owner, because  we are totally owned property; someone other 
than  us  has  power  of  disposal  over  us.  That  is  to  say,  it  is  You  Who  is  our 
Owner! And You, You are Mighty! You possess grandeur and sublimity! As for 
us we look to our baseness and see that there are manifestations of a mightiness 
on us. That is to say, we are mirrors to Your mightiness! And it is You Who is the 
Possessor  of  Absolute  Riches,  because  we  are  utterly  wanting,  and  riches  are 
bestowed on us that our indigent hands could not obtain. That is to say, it is You 
Who is rich, the One Who gives is You! And You, You are the Ever-Living, Ever-
Enduring  One,  because  we,  we  are  dying,  and  in  our  dying  and  in  our  being 
resurrected we see the manifestation of a perpetual giver of life! And You, You 
are Ever-Enduring, because we see Your continuation and perpetualness in our 
demise  and  transience!  And  the  One  Who  responds  to  us  and  answers  us,  the 
Granter  of  Gifts,  is  You.  For  all  of  us  beings,  we  are  ever  crying  out  and 
requesting,  entreating,  imploring  by  tongue  and  by  state.  And  our  desires  are 
brought about, our aims are achieved.  In other words, the One Who answers us 
is You!... 

So  forgive  me  my  sins  and  bear  with  me  and  heal  my  ills,  O  my  God!    O  All-
Sufficing One!  O Sustainer!  O Faithful One!  O Most Compassionate One! O 
Healer!  O Munificent One!  O Forgiving One!  Pardon all my sins, and grant 
me health from all sicknesses, and be pleased with me for all eternity! Through 
Your Mercy, O Most Merciful of the Merciful! 

And the close of their prayer will be: All praise be to God, the Sustainer of All 
the Worlds!

The Thirty-Third Word 

This Word consists of 
Thirty-Three Windows 

While being the Thirty-Third Letter, 
this is also the Thirty-Third Word. 

In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
We shall show them Our signs in the furthest horizons and in themselves, so that 
it  will  become  clear  to  them  that  this  [Qur’an]  is  indeed  the  Truth.  Is  it  not 
enough that your Sustainer witnesses all things?1 

Question: We would  like a concise explanation  of the ways  man  and the universe, 
that is, the microcosm and the macrocosm, point to the necessary existence and unity of 
God and His dominical attributes and  functions,  which the two parts of the above  verse 
denote. For the unbelievers  have gone too far, they  are saying:  “For how  long shall  we 
say: ‘And He is powerful over all things,’ and have to raise our hands?” 

Answer: The thirty-three Words that have been written form thirty-three drops from 
the ocean of this verse and from the seas of truth which flow from it. If you look at them, 
you will find your answer. What we say now is only a sort of hint to the sprinkling of a 
single drop from the ocean. 

For example, if a wonder-worker wants to build a splendid palace, he first of all sets 
the  foundations  in  a wise and regular  fashion, and plans them  in  a way suitable to their 
future purpose and results. Then  he  skilfully divides them  into sections and apartments. 
Next,  he  orders  and  arranges  the  apartments,  and  decorates  them  with  tapestries,  then 
illuminates  them  with  electric  lights.  Then,  in  order  to  renew  his  ingenious  works  and 
favours in that  

                                                

1 Qur’an, 41:53. 

 

684 

magnificent  and  adorned  palace,  he  makes  fresh  creations  and  new  changes  and 
transformations in every level of it. And then he installs a telephone in every apartment 
connected to his own abode, and opens up a window from each, so that his may be seen. 

In just the same way, And God’s is the highest similitude,2 the Peerless Creator, Who 
is  named with a thousand and one sacred Names such as  All-Glorious Maker, All-Wise 
Sovereign, All-Just Arbiter, willed the creation of the palace of the universe and tree of 
the cosmos, which forms the macrocosm. He set the foundations of the palace, the tree, in 
six days through the principles of wisdom and laws of His pre-eternal knowledge. Then 
He  divided  and  formed  it  into  the  higher  and  lower  levels  and  branches  through  the 
principles of Divine Determining and Decree. Next, He adorned everything, each world, 
in an appropriate manner, like the heavens with the stars and the earth with flowers. Then 
He  manifested  and  made  luminous  His  Names  within  the  arena  of  those  universal  laws 
and  general  principles.  And  then  in  a  special  way  sent  to  the  assistance  of  individuals 
crying out at the constraint of those universal laws His Names of Most Merciful and All-
Compassionate.  That  is  to  say,  within  those  universal  and  general  principles  He  has 
special favours, special succour, special manifestations, so that everything may seek help 
from Him and look to Him at all times for every need. Then from every apartment, every 
level, every world, every realm of  being, every  individual,  from everything, He opened 
up windows which would show Himself, that is, make known His existence and unity. He 
left a telephone in every heart. 

For  now  we  shall  not  attempt  to  discuss  those  innumerable  windows,  which  is 
anyway  beyond our power. Referring them to the all-encompassing knowledge of God, 
we  shall  only  point  out  in  a  concise  and  brief  manner  thirty-three  Windows  –  since  it 
corresponds to the blessed  number of the  tesbihat following the prescribed prayers, and 
for a more detailed explanation of this, which forms the Thirty-Third Letter and Thirty-
Third Word and consists of gleams from verses of the Qur’an, we refer readers to the rest 
of the Words. 

                                                

2 Qur’an, 16:60. 

 

685 

First Window 

If  we  look,  we  see  that  all  things  and  especially  living  creatures  have  numerous 
different  needs  and  numerous  different  wants.  And those  wants  and  needs  are  provided 
for them at the appropriate time, in unexpected ways, from places they do not know and 
their hands cannot reach; succour comes to them. But the power of these needy beings is 
insufficient for even the smallest of those endless things they wish for; they cannot meet 
their  needs.  Consider  yourself:  of  how  many  things  are  you  in  need  that  your  hands 
cannot  reach,  like  your  external  and  inner  senses  and  their  needs?  Compare  all  other 
living creatures with yourself. See, just as singly they testify to the Necessary Existence 
and point to His unity, so in their totality they show to the rea 

son a Necessarily Existent One behind the veil of the Unseen, a Single One of Unity, 

among titles of Most Generous, All-Compassionate, Nurturer, and Disposer. 

O  ignorant  unbeliever  and  dissolute  heedless  one!  With  what  can  you  explain  this 
wise,  percipient,  compassionate  activity?  Deaf  nature?  Blind  force?  Senseless  chance? 
Can you explain it through impotent, lifeless causes? 

Second Window 

While  in  their  existence  and  individuality,  things  are  in  a  hesitant,  bewildered,  and 
shapeless form among innumerable possible ways, they are suddenly given a most well-
ordered and wise aspect of individuality. For example, every human being has on his face 
characteristics which differentiate him from all his fellow humans, and it is equipped with 
utter wisdom with external and inner senses. This proves that the face is a most brilliant 
stamp of Divine oneness. And just as each face testifies to the existence of an All-Wise 
Maker  and  points  to  His  existence,  so  too  the  stamp  which  all  faces  display  in  their 
totality shows to the mind’s eye that all things are a seal peculiar to their Creator. 

O  denier!  To  what  workshop  can  you  refer  these  stamps  which  can  in  no  way  be 

imitated, and the stamp of Eternal Besoughtedness which is on the totality? 

 

686 

Third Window 

The  army  of  all  the  various  species  of  animals  and  plants  on  the  face  of  the  earth 
consists of four hundred thousand different groups.3 Their being managed and raised with 
perfect  balance  and  order  through  their  sustenance,  papers,  weapons,  uniforms, 
instructions,  and  demobilizations,  which  are  all  different  with  nothing  being  forgotten 
and none of them being confused, is a stamp of the Single One of Unity as brilliant as the 
sun which can in no way be doubted. Who other than One possessing boundless power, 
all-encompassing  knowledge,  and  infinite  wisdom  could  have  any  part  in  this 
administration,  which  is  wondrous  to  the  utmost  degree.  For  if  one  who  cannot 
administer  and  raise  all  together  these  species  and  nations,  which  are  one  within  the 
other, interferes with one of them, he will throw the lot into disorder. Whereas according 
to the meaning of, 

So turn your vision again, do you see any flaw?4 

there is no sign of confusion. That means not so much as a finger can interfere. 

Fourth Window 

This  is  the  acceptability  of  the  supplications  offered  through  the  tongue  of  latent 
ability by all seeds, and through the tongue of innate need by all animals, and through the 
tongue of exigency by the desperate. 

Yes,  just  as  all  these  innumerable  supplications  are  observedly  accepted  and 
responded  to,  so  in  a  large  measure  do they  in  their  entirety  self-evidently  indicate  and 
point to an All-Compassionate and Generous Creator, the Answerer of Prayer. 

Fifth Window 

We  see  that  things  and  particularly  living  beings  come  into  existence  of  a  sudden, 
instantaneously.  But,  while  things  which  appear  suddenly  out  of  a  simple  substance 
should  be  simple,  formless,  and  without  art,  they  are  created  with  an  art  and  beauty 
requiring much skill, they are decorated with  

3 The members of some of those groups, even, are more numerous than all the members of the human 

                                                

race from the time of Adam up to the Last Day. 

4 Qur’an, 67:3. 

 

687 

painstaking embroideries requiring much time, and adorned with wonderful arts requiring 
many  tools.  Thus,  just  as  each  of  these  instantaneous,  wondrous  arts  and  beautiful 
combinations  indicates  the  necessary  existence  of  an  All-Wise  Creator  and  the  unity  of 
His dominicality,  so in their totality do they show  in  most brilliant fashion an  infinitely 
Powerful, infinitely Wise Necessarily Existent One. 

So  now,  O  stupefied  denier!  How  can  you  explain  this?  With  ‘nature’,  which  is 
unconscious,  impotent,  and  ignorant  like  you?  Or  do  you  want  to  make  an  infinite 
mistake  and  call  that  All-Holy  Maker  ‘nature’,  and  on  the  pretext  of  naming  Him  that, 
attribute  the  miracles  of  His  power  to  it  and  perpetrate  an  impossibility  compounded  a 
thousand times over? 

Sixth Window 

In the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day 
and the boats which travel through the seas for the benefit of men, and in what 
God sends down from the sky as rain and with it raises to life the earth after its 
death  and  raises  in  it  every  sort  of  living  being,  and  in  the  circulating  of  the 
winds  and  the  clouds  subjugated  between  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  are  signs 
for a people who thinks.5 

This  verse  both  points  out  the  Divine  existence  and  unity,  and  forms  a  truly  large 

window displaying a Greatest Name. 

The  gist  of  the  verse  is  this:  all  the  worlds  in  the  higher  and  lower  levels  of  the 
universe  show  with  all-different  tongues  a  single  result,  that  is,  the  dominicality  of  a 
single  All-Wise  Maker.  It  is  as  follows:  just  as  in  the  heavens  –  and  astronomy  even 
admits  to  it  –  extremely  well-ordered  movements  for  extremely  extensive  results  show 
the existence, unity, and perfect dominicality of an All-Powerful One of Glory, so too on 
the earth – and geography even testifies to it and acknowledges it – most orderly changes, 
like in the seasons, for most extensive benefits show the existence and unity and perfect 
dominicality of the same All-Powerful One of Glory. 

Also, just as, being given their sustenance with perfect mercy, and being clothed in 
different  forms  with  perfect  wisdom,  and  being  decked  out  with  all  sorts  of  senses 
through  perfect  dominicality,  each  of  all  the  animals  on  the  land  and  in  the  sea  again 
testifies to the existence of the All-Powerful One of Glory and indicates His unity, so in 
their  totality  do  they  show  on  a  vast  scale  the  tremendousness  of  His  Godhead  and  the 
perfection of His  

                                                

5 Qur’an, 2:164. 

 

688 

dominicality.  So  too,  just  as  each  of  the  well-ordered  plants  in  gardens,  and  the  finely 
adorned  flowers  which  the  plants  display,  and  the  well-proportioned  fruits  which  the 
flowers display, and the embellished embroideries which the fruits display, testifies to the 
existence of the All-Wise Maker and points to His unity, so too in their totality do they 
show most brilliantly the beauty of His mercy and the perfection of His dominicality. 

Also, just as the drops of rain sent from the clouds in the sky charged with duties for 
important  instances  of  wisdom  and  aims  and  necessary  benefits  and  results  again 
demonstrate  to  the  number  of  their  drops  the  the  necessary  existence  and  unity  and 
perfect dominicality of the All-Wise Maker, so too do all the mountains on the earth and 
the  storing-up  in  them  of  minerals  with  all  their  different  properties  for  numerous 
different  benefits  show  with  the  strength  and  firmness  of  a  mountain  the  existence  and 
unity of the All-Wise Maker and the perfection of His dominicality. 

Also,  just  as,  being  adorned  with  numerous  varieties  of  well-ordered  flowers,  the 
small hills in the plains and among the mountains each testifies to the necessary existence 
of an All-Wise Maker and points to His unity, and all together show the majesty of His 
sovereignty  and  the  perfection  of  His  dominicality,  so  the  great  variety  of  the  orderly 
shapes of all the  leaves of the grasses and trees, and all their different stages and states 
and well-balanced and ecstatic movements again show the necessary existence and unity 
and perfect dominicality of the All-Wise Maker. 

Also, just as the regular development at the time of their growth of all living bodies, 
and  each  being  equipped  with  all  sorts  of  organs  and  their  being  directed  consciously 
towards numerous different fruits again testify to the necessary existence of the All-Wise 
Maker  and  indicate  His  unity,  and  in  their  totality  show  on  a  truly  vast  scale  His  all-
encompassing  power,  and  all-embracing  wisdom,  and  the  beauty  of  His  art,  and  the 
perfection of His dominicality, so too souls and spirits being situated in all animal bodies, 
and  their  being  armed  in  most  orderly  fashion  with  numerous  sorts  of  systems  and 
faculties, and their being sent on numerous different errands with perfect wisdom testify 
to  the  number  of  animals,  indeed  to  the  number  of  their  faculties,  to  the  necessary 
existence of the  All-Wise Maker and point to His unity.  And  in their totality they show 
most brilliantly the beauty of His mercy and the perfection of His dominicality. 

Also,  just  as  the  inspirations  from  the  Unseen  imparted  to  all  hearts,  which  make 
known to man every sort of science and knowledge and truth and teach the animals how 
to procure their needs, make known the existence of an All-Compassionate Sustainer and 
point  to  His  dominicality,  so  their  external  and  inner  senses,  which  like  rays  gathering 
immaterial  flowers  from  the  garden  of  the  universe,  are  all  keys  to  different  worlds, 
demonstrate  as  clearly  as  the  sun  the  necessary  existence,  unity,  oneness,  and  perfect 
domin 

 

689 

icality  of  the  All-Wise  Maker,  the  All-Knowing  Creator,  the  Most  Compassionate 
Creator, the All-Generous Provider. 

Thus,  from the twelve windows, the twelve aspects, mentioned  here a vast window 
opens which displays with a twelve-coloured light of truth the oneness, unity, and perfect 
dominicality of God Almighty . 

O unhappy denier! With what can you block up this window which is as broad as the 
globe  of  the  earth,  indeed,  as  its  yearly  orbit?  And  with  what  can  you  extinguish  this 
source of light which shines like the sun? Behind which veil of heedlessness can you hide 
it? 

Seventh Window 

The perfect order of the works of art scattered over the face of the universe, and their 
perfect  proportion  and  balance,  and  the  perfection  of  their  adornment,  and  the  ease  in 
their  creation,  and  their  resembling  one  another,  and  their  exhibiting  a  single  nature 
demonstrate  on  a  vast  scale  the  necessary  existence  and  perfect  power  and  unity  of  an 
All-Wise Maker.  

Moreover,  just  as  the  creation  of  innumerable,  different,  well-ordered  complex 
beings  from  inanimate  and  simple  elements  again  testifies,  to  the  number  of  those 
composite beings, to the All-Wise  Maker’s  necessary existence and points to His unity, 
so in their totality do those beings demonstrate in truly brilliant fashion His unity and the 
perfection of His power.  

Then  the  utmost  distinguishing  and  differentiating  of  beings  as  they  are  renewed 
while  being  assembled  and  dissolved  –that  is,  during  what  is  called  the  composition  of 
beings–  amid  the  utmost  degree  of  intermingling  and  confusion,  for  example  the 
distinguishing of the shoots and growth of seeds and roots without confusing them in any 
way  although  they  are  all  mixed  up,  and  the  mixed-up  substances  entering  trees  being 
divided between the leaves, flowers, and fruits, and the nutrients which enter the body in 
mixed-up  form  being  differentiated  and  separated  out  with  perfect  wisdom  and  perfect 
balance for the cells of the body, – again demonstrate the necessary existence and perfect 
power  and  unity  of  the  Absolutely  Wise  One,  the  Absolutely  Knowing  One,  the 
Absolutely Powerful One.  

Then too the making of the world of minute particles into a boundless, broad arable 
field and every instant sowing and harvesting it and obtaining the fresh crops of different 
universes  from  it,  and  those  inanimate,  impotent,  ignorant  particles  being  made  to 
perform  innumerable  orderly  duties  most  consciously,  wisely,  and  capably  –  this  also 
shows the necessary existence of the All-Powerful One of Glory and Maker of Perfection, 
and His perfect  

 

690 

Power  and  the  grandeur  of  His  sovereignty  and  His  unity  and  the  perfection  of  His 
dominicality. 

Thus  through  these  four  ways  a  large  window  is  opened  onto  knowledge  of  God; 

addressing the reason, it displays the All-Wise Maker on a large scale. 

Now, you unhappy heedless one! If you do not want to see Him and learn of Him in 

this way, divest yourself of your reason; become an animal, and thus be saved! 

Eighth Window 

The  testimony  of  all  the  prophets  (Peace  be  upon  them),  who  among  mankind 
possessed  luminous  spirits,  relying  on  their  manifest  and  evident  miracles;  and  the 
testimony  of  all  the  saints,  who  with  their  luminous  hearts  are  the  spiritual  poles  of 
mankind,  relying  on  their  illuminations  and  wonder-working;  and  testimony  of  all  the 
purified  scholars,  who  possess  luminous  minds,  relying  on  their  researches  and 
verifications;  –the  testimony  of  all  these  to  the  necessary  existence,  unity,  and  perfect 
dominicality  of  the  Single  One  of  Unity,  the  Necessary  Existent,  the  Creator  of  All 
Things, forms a truly vast and light-filled window. 

O you unfortunate denier! In whom do you place your trust so that you do not heed 
these? Or  by closing  your eyes  in the daytime do  you  imagine the world to be plunged 
into night? 

Ninth Window 

The universal worship in the cosmos self-evidently demonstrates an Absolute Object 
of  Worship.  Yes,  the  perfect  obedience  and  worship  of  all  angels  and  spirit  beings,  –
which  is  established  by  the  testimony  of  those  who  have  penetrated  to the  spirit  world 
and the inner dimension of things and have met with the angels and spirit beings– and of 
all  living  beings  self-evidently  performing  their  duties  in  perfect  order  and  in  a 
worshipful  manner,  and  of  all  inanimate  things  self-evidently  carrying  out  their  duties 
with  perfect  submission  and  in  a  worshipful  manner,  all  demonstrate  the  necessary 
existence and unity of a True Object of Worship.  

So too the true knowledge of the knowing, which has the strength of consensus, and 
the fruitful thanks of all those who offer thanks, and the radiant glorification of all those 
who  recite  God’s  Names,  and  the  bounty-increasing  praises  of  all  those  recite  God’s 
praises, and all the demonstrative proofs and  

 

691 

descriptions  of  Divine  unity  of  all  those  who  acknowledge  it,  and  the  true  love  and 
passion of all lovers of God, and the true will and desire of those who seek Him, and the 
earnest searching and penitence of all those who turn to Him, –all these demonstrate the 
necessary  existence  and  perfect  dominicality  and  unity  of  that  Pre-Eternal  All-
Worshipped One, the One Who is Known, Mentioned, Thanked, Praised, One, Beloved, 
Desired, and Sought.  

So  too  all  the  acceptable  worship  of  perfected  human  beings  and  the  spiritual 
radiance  and  supplications,  visions  and  illuminations  resulting  from  their  acceptable 
worship again demonstrate the necessary existence and unity and perfect dominicality of 
that Eternal Being, the Enduring Object of Worship. Thus, these three aspects open up a 
broad, light-giving window onto Divine unity. 

Tenth Window 

And He sends down  water from the sky and brings forth  with it fruits for your 
sustenance; and He has made subject to you the ships, that they sail through the 
sea by His command; and He has made the rivers subject to you; * And He has 
made  subject  to  you  the  sun  and  the  moon,  both  diligently  pursuing  their 
courses; and He has made subject to you the night and the day. * And He gives 
you of all that you ask Him. But if you count God’s bounties, you will never be 
able to number them.6 

The  mutual  assistance  and  co-operation  of  beings  in  the  universe  and  the  fact  that 
they  respond  to one  another  show  that  all  creatures  are  raised  by  a  single  Nurturer,  are 
organized  by  a  single  Director,  are  under  the  jurisdiction  of  a  single  Disposer,  are  the 
servants of a single Lord. For through an all-embracing law of mutual assistance, the sun 
cooks  the  necessities  for  the  lives  of  living  beings  on  the  earth  through  a  dominical 
command, and the moon acts as a calendar, and light, air, water, and sustenance hasten to 
the assistance of living beings, and plants hasten to the assistance of animals, and animals 
hasten to the assistance of  human  beings, and the  members of the  body  hasten to assist 
one another, and particles of food even hasten to the assistance of the cells of the body. 
This  most wise and generous  mutual assistance of these  beings, and their responding to 
one  another’s  needs  and  their  supporting  and  strengthening  one  another  in  accordance

O  wretched  bankrupt  philosophy!  What  have  you  say  in  the  face  of  this  mighty 

window? Can your chance interfere in this?

For indeed in the remembrance of God do hearts find rest.7 

Through  knowing  a  single  Creator,  all  spirits  and  hearts  are  delivered  from  the 
distress  and  confusion  arising  from  misguidance,  and  from  the  spiritual  pains  arising 
from  distress.  They  are  saved  by  attributing  all  beings  to  a  single  Maker.  They  find 
assurance through the remembrance of a  single  God. For, as  is proved decisively  in the 
Twenty-Second  Word,  if  all  beings  are  not  attributed  to  a  single  being,  it  becomes 
necessary  to  ascribe  a  single  thing  to  innumerable  causes,  and  then  the  existence  of  a 
single  thing  becomes  as  difficult  as  all  beings.  For  if  attributed  to  God,  innumerable 
things  are  ascribed  to  a  single  being,  and  if  they  are  not  attributed  to  Him,  it  becomes 
necessary to attribute everything to innumerable  causes. Then a single  fruit  becomes as 
difficult  as  the  universe,  indeed,  more  difficult.  For  just  as  if  the  management  of  one 
soldier  is  given  to  a  hundred  different  people,  a  hundred  difficulties  arise,  and  if  a 
hundred soldiers are given to the direction of one officer, they are as easy to manage as a 
single  soldier,  so  too  the  coinciding  of  numerous  different  causes  in  the  creation  of  a 
single thing is difficult to the hundredth degree. And if the creation of numerous things is 
given to a single being, it becomes easy to the hundredth degree. 

Thus,  it is only  by recognizing the Creator’s unity and knowledge of God that man 
may  be  delivered  from  the  boundless  distress  arising  from  the  desire  to  search  for  the 
truth inherent in his nature. Since there are endless difficulties and pains in unbelief and 
associating partners with God, that way is certainly impossible and devoid of truth. While 
since  suitably  to  the  ease,  abundance,  and  fine  art  in  the  creation  of  beings,  there  is  a 
boundless ease in affirming Divine unity, that way is surely necessary and the truth. 

O you miserable people of misguidance! See how dark and full of pain is the way of 
misguidance!  What  is  it  that  makes  you  take  it?  And  see  how  easy  and  pleasant  is  the 
way of belief and affirming Divine unity! Take that way and be delivered!

Glorify  the  Name  of  your  Sustainer,  the  All-Highest,  *  Who  has  created,  and 
given order and proportion, * And Who has determined [the nature of all things] 
and guided [them towards their fulfilment].8 

According  to  the  meaning  of  this  verse,  all  things,  and  especially  living  creatures, 
have  been  given  a  form  and  regular  proportions  in  accordance  with  wisdom  as  though 
they  have  emerged  from  a  purposeful  mould.  Contained  in  those  measured  proportions 
are intricate extremities for various benefits and uses. And the form of their clothes and 
their  proportions,  which  they  change  throughout  the  periods  of  their  lives,  are  each 
immaterial and well-ordered and measured, and are composed of the appointed events of 
their  lives  again  in  a  fashion  suitable  to  wisdom  and  benefits.  This  shows  clearly  that 
those  innumerable  creatures,  whose  forms  and  proportions  have  been  planned  in  the 
sphere of determining of an All-Powerful One of Glory, an All-Wise One of Perfection, 
and who have been given forms fashioned in the workshop of Divine power, point to that 
Being’s  necessary  existence  and  testify  to  His  unity  and  perfect  power  with  endless 
tongues.  Look  at  your  own  body  and  its  members  and  the  fruits  of  its  intricate  and 
complex places! See the perfect power within the perfect wisdom! 

Thirteenth Window 

According to the meaning of: 

And there is nothing but extols His limitless glory and praise,9 

everything  recalls  its  Creator  through  its  own  particular  tongue  and  declares  to  His 
holiness. Yes, the glorifications all beings utter audibly and through the tongues of their 
beings demonstrate the existence of a single  Most Holy Being. The testimony of  innate 
disposition may not be rejected. Especially if the evidence comes from all sides, it cannot 
be  doubted.  Look!  The  well-ordered  forms  of  beings,  which  through  their  manner  of 
creation comprise endless testimony, and offer evidence in innumerable ways through the 
tongue  of  disposition  and  look  to  a  single  centre  like  concentric  circles  –  all  these  are 
tongues.  Similarly,  their  well-proportioned  and  balanced  assemblages  are  all  testifying 
tongues.  And  their  perfect  lives  are  all  glorifying  tongues.  Thus,  as  is  proved  in  the 
Twenty-Fourth Word, their glorifying,

extolling,  and  testifying  to  a  single  Most  Holy  Being  through  all  these  tongues 
demonstrate  a  Necessarily  Existent  One  as  light  shows  the  sun,  and  point  to  the

Say:  who is it in  whose hands is the governance of all things?10 * And there is 
nothing but its treasuries are with Us.11 * There is not a moving creature but He 
has grasp of its forelock.12 * Indeed my Sustainer watches over and records all 
things.13 

According  to  the  meaning  of  these  verses,  all  things  are  in  need  of  a  single  All-
Glorious Creator in everything, in all matters and circumstances. Indeed, we look at the 
beings  in  the  universe  and  we  see  that  there  is  the  manifestation  of  an  absolute  force 
within an absolute weakness, and the traces of an absolute power are apparent within an 
absolute  impotence;  like,  for  example,  the  wonderful  states  and  stages  plants  display 
when the life-force awakens in their seeds and roots. There is the manifestation too of an 
absolute wealth within an absolute poverty and dryness; like the poverty of trees and the 
soil  in  winter  and  their  glittering  wealth  and  riches  in  the  spring.  The  sprinklings  of  an 
absolute life are also apparent within an absolute lifelessness; like the transformation of 
the  elements  into  living  matter.  There  is,  moreover,  the  manifestation  of  an  all-
encompassing consciousness within an absolute ignorance; like everything, from minute 
particles to the stars, acting consciously and conforming to the order of the universe and 
to the demands of wisdom and requirements of life.  

Thus,  this  power  within  impotence,  and  strength  within  weakness,  and  wealth  and 
riches  within  poverty,  and  life  and  consciousness  within  lifelessness  and  ignorance 
necessarily  and  self-evidently  open  up  windows  on  every  side  onto  the  necessary 
existence and unity of a Possessor of Absolute Power and Absolute Strength, a Possessor 
of Absolute Riches, an Absolutely Knowing, All-Living and Self-Sufficient One. In their 
totality they point to a luminous highway on a vast scale. 

And so, O you heedless one who has fallen into the swamp of nature! If you do not 
quit nature and recognize  Divine power, you have to accept that in everything,  in every 
minute  particle  even,  reside  an  infinite  force  and  power,  a  boundless  wisdom  and  skill, 
and the ability to see, know, and administer most other beings.

According to the meaning of the verse: 

Who has created everything in the best way,14 

everything is cut out according to its innate abilities with perfect measure and order, and 
put together with the finest art, in the shortest way, the best form, the lightest manner, and 
most practicable shape. Look at the clothes of birds, for example, and the easy way they 
ruffle  up  their  feathers  and  continuously  use  them.  Also,  things  are  given  bodies  and 
dressed in forms in a wise manner with no waste and nothing in vain; they testify to their 
number to the necessary  existence of an  All-Wise Maker and point to that Possessor of 
Absolute Power and Knowledge. 

Sixteenth Window 

The order and ordering in the creation and disposal of creatures, which are renewed 
season by season on the earth, show clearly a universal wisdom. Since an attribute cannot 
be without the one it qualifies, this universal wisdom necessarily shows an All-Wise One. 
The  wonderful  adornment  within  the  veil  of  wisdom,  self-evidently  shows  a  perfect 
beneficence, and that perfect beneficence necessarily points to a gracious, All-Generous 
Creator. The all-encompassing  benevolence and  bestowal within the veil of beneficence 
show  self-evidently  an  all-embracing  mercy,  and  that  all-embracing  mercy  shows 
necessarily an All-Merciful and All-Compassionate One. The sustenance and foods of all 
living  creatures  above  the  veil  of  mercy,  all  perfectly  appropriate  for their  needs,  show 
clearly a sustaining Providence and a compassionate dominicality, and that sustaining and 
administering necessarily point to an All-Generous Provider.  

Yes,  all  the  creatures  on  the  face  of  the  earth,  thus  raised  with  perfect  wisdom, 
adorned with perfect beneficence, bestowed upon with perfect mercy, and nurtured with 
perfect  compassion,  testify  to  the  necessary  existence  of  an  All-Wise,  Munificent, 
Compassionate, Providing Maker, and points to His unity. 

Look at and consider also the universal wisdom which is apparent on the face of the 
earth as a whole and is to be seen in its totality and shows clearly purpose and will; and 
the perfect beneficence embracing all creatures, which

comprises  the  wisdom;  and  the  all-encompassing  mercy,  which  comprises  the 
beneficence and wisdom and includes all the beings of the earth; and the most generous 
sustaining  and  nurturing,  which  comprises  the  mercy  and  wisdom  and  beneficence  and 
embraces  all  living  creatures.  Just  as the  seven  colours  form  light,  and  the  light,  which 
illuminates  the  face  of  the  earth,  undoubtedly  shows  the  sun,  so  too  that  beneficence 
within wisdom, and mercy within beneficence, and sustaining and nurturing within mercy 
show brilliantly on a large scale and at a high degree the unity and perfect dominicality of 
an utterly Wise, Generous, Compassionate, Providing Necessarily Existent One. 

O you stupefied and heedless denier! With what can you explain this wise, generous, 
compassionate,  providential  sustaining,  this  strange,  wonderful,  miraculous  state  of 
affairs which  is  before  your eyes?  With chance and coincidence, which are aimless  like 
you?  With  force,  which  is  blind  like  your  heart?  With  nature,  which  is  deaf  like  your 
head? With causes which are impotent, lifeless, and ignorant like you? Or do you want to 
give the name of ‘nature,’ which is utterly impotent, ignorant, deaf, blind, contingent, and 
wretched,  to  the  All-Glorious  One,  Who  is  utterly  holy,  pure,  exalted,  and  free  of  all 
defect  and  absolutely  Powerful,  Knowing,  Hearing,  and  Seeing,  and  thus  perpetrate  an 
infinite error? So with what force can you extinguish this truth brilliant as the sun? Under 
which veil of heedlessness can you conceal it?

Indeed in the heavens and earth are signs for those who believe.15 

If  we  observe  the  face  of  the  earth  in  the  summer,  we  see  that  an  absolute 
munificence and liberality, which necessitate confusion and disarrangement, is to be seen 
within a total harmony and order. Look at all the plants which adorn the face of the earth! 
And  the  utter  speed  in  the  creation  of  things,  which  necessitates  imbalance  and 
disorder,  is  apparent  within  a  perfect  equilibrium.  Look  at  all  the  fruits  which  decorate 
the face of the earth! 

And  an  absolute  multiplicity,  which  necessitates  unimportance,  indeed,  ugliness,  is 
apparent within a perfect beauty of art. Look at all the flowers which gild the face of the 
earth! 

And the absolute ease in the creation of things, which necessitates lack of

art  and  simplicity,  is  to  be  seen  within  an  infinite  art  and  skill  and  attention.  Look 
carefully at all seeds, which are like the tiny containers and programmes of the members 
of plants and trees and the small cases containing their life-histories! 

And the great distances, which necessitate difference and diversity, appear within an 
correspondence and conformity. Look at all the  varieties of cereal grains sown  in every 
part of the earth! 

And  the  total  intermingling,  which  necessitates  confusion  and  muddle,  is  on  the 
contrary  to  be  seen  within  a  perfect  differentiation  and  separation.  Consider  the  perfect 
differentiation of seeds when they  sprout, despite being cast  into the earth all  mixed-up 
together  and  all  resembling  one  another  with  regard  to their  substance,  and  the  various 
substances  which  enter  trees  being  separated  out  perfectly  for  the  leaves,  flowers,  and 
fruits, and the  foods which enter the stomach all  mixed-up together being separated out 
perfectly  according  to the  various  members  and  cells.  See  the  perfect  power  within  the 
perfect wisdom! 

And the great abundance and infinite profusion, which necessitate unimportance and 
worthlessness,  are to  be  seen  as  most  valuable  and  expensive  in  regard  to the  creatures 
and art on the face of the earth. Within these innumerable wonders of art, consider only 
the  varieties  of  mulberry,  those  confections  of  Divine  power,  on  the  table  of  the  All-
Merciful One on the face of the earth! See them within the perfect mercy, the perfect art! 
Thus, just as the day shows the light, and the light the sun, the great value together 
with the utter profusion; and the  boundless  intermingling and  intermixing together with 
the utmost differentiation and separation within the utter profusion; and the great distance 
together with the utmost conformity and resemblance within the limitless differentiation 
and  separation;  and  the  infinite  ease  and  facility  together  with  the  infinite  care  in  the 
making within the utmost resemblance; and the absolute speed and rapidity together with 
the total equilibrium and balance and lack of waste within the most beautiful making; and 
the infinite abundance and multiplicity together with the highest degree of beauty of art 
within  utter  lack  of  waste;  and  the  utmost  munificence  together  with  absolute  order 
within  the  highest  degree of  beauty  of  art,  all  testify  to the  necessary  existence,  perfect 
power, beautiful  dominicality, and unity and oneness of an  All-Powerful One of Glory, 
an  All-Wise  One  of  Perfection,  an  All-Compassionate  and  Beauteous  One.  They 
demonstrate the meaning of the verse: 

His are the Most Beautiful Names.16 

So now, O you ignorant, heedless, obstinate wretch! With what can you

interpret  this  mighty  truth?  With  what  can  you  explain  this  infinitely  miraculous  and 
wonderful state of affairs? To what can you attribute these truly extraordinary arts? What 
veil of heedlessness can you draw across this window as broad as the earth and so close 
it?  Where  is  your  chance  and  coincidence,  your  unconscious  companion  on  which  you 
rely and call ‘nature,’ your friend and support in misguidance? It is totally impossible for 
chance and coincidence to interfere in these matters, isn’t it? And to attribute to ‘nature’ 
one thousandth of them is impossible a thousand times over, isn’t it?  

Or  does  lifeless,  impotent  nature  have  immaterial  machines  and  printing  presses 

within each single thing, made from each, and to the number of each? 

Eighteenth Window 

Do they not consider the government of the heavens and the earth?17 

Consider  this  comparison  which  is  explained  in  the  Twenty-Second  Word:  a  fine, 
well-ordered, well-crafted work like a palace self-evidently points to a well-ordered act. 
That  is  to  say,  a  building  indicates  the  act  of  building.  And  a  fine,  well-ordered  act 
necessarily  points  to  a  proficient  agent,  a  skilful  master,  a  builder.  And  the  titles  of 
proficient master and builder point self-evidently to a perfect attribute, that is, to a faculty 
for the craft. And that perfect attribute and that perfect faculty for the craft self-evidently 
indicate the existence of a perfect innate ability. And a perfect innate ability indicate the 
existence of an exalted spirit and elevated essence. 

In  just  the  same  way,  the  constantly  renewed  works  filling  the  face  of  the  earth, 
indeed the universe, show clearly acts of the utmost perfection. And these acts, which are 
encompassed by total order and wisdom, point clearly to an agent whose titles and Names 
are  perfect.  For  it  is  clearly  obvious  that  well-ordered,  wise  acts  cannot  be  without the 
one  who  performs  them.  And  titles  of  the  utmost  perfection  point  to the  utterly  perfect 
attributes  of  that  agent.  For  according  to  the  rules  of  grammar,  the  active  particle  is 
formed  from the  infinitive [that is, what  is called ‘the root’ in  Arabic grammar]; so too 
the source and roots of nouns, names and titles are attributes. And attributes at the utmost 
degree  of  perfection  point  indubitably  to  utterly  perfect  essential  qualities.  And  those 
perfect  essential  qualities  –which  we  are  unable  to  describe–  point  most  certainly  to  an 
essence which is at the utmost peak of perfection.  

Thus, since in every part of the world all the works of art and creatures  

                                                

17 Qur’an, 7:185. 

 

699 

are perfect works, each of them testifies to an act, and the act testifies to a Name, and the 
Name to an attribute, and the attribute to a quality, and the quality to the Essence. Thus, 
just  as  singly  they  testify  to  the  necessary  existence  of  the  All-Glorious  Maker  to  the 
number  of  creatures  and  indicate  His  oneness,  so  altogether  they  form  an  ascension  in 
Divine  knowledge  as  strong  as  the  chains  of  beings.  They  form  a  proof  of  reality  in 
continuous sequence which no doubt can pierce or penetrate. 

So now, O wretched, heedless denier! With what can you smash this proof which is 
as powerful as the chain of the universe?  With what can  you close this  latticed window 
with  its  innumerable  spaces  through  which  shine  rays  of  truth  to  the  number  of  these 
creatures? Which veil of heedlessness can you draw over it? 

Nineteenth Window 

According to the meaning of the verse: 

The  seven  heavens  and  the  earth  and  all  within  them  extol  His  limitless  glory, 
and there is nothing but it extols His limitless glory and praise,18 

the All-Glorious Maker has attached  innumerable  meanings and  instances of wisdom to 
the heavenly  bodies so that  it  is as  if,  in order to express His glory and  beauty, He  has 
adorned  the  heavens  with  the  words  of  the  suns,  moons  and  stars.  To the  beings  in  the 
atmosphere  also  He  has  attached  instances  of  wisdom  and  meanings  and  aims,  as  if  to 
make  it  speak  through  the  words  of  the  thunder,  lightning,  and  drops  of  rain,  and  give 
instruction in the perfection of His wisdom and beauty of His mercy. 

He  causes  the  head  of  the  earth  to  speak  too  with  its  meaningful  words  known  as 
animals and plants and displays the perfections of His art to the universe. Then He makes 
the  plants  and  trees  speak,  all  words  of  that  head,  through  the  words  of  their  leaves, 
flowers, and fruits and again proclaims the perfection of His art and beauty of His mercy. 
Their flowers and fruits, too, He makes speak, through the words of their seeds, and gives 
instruction  to the  aware  and  conscious  in  the  subtleties  of  His  art  and  the  perfection  of 
His dominicality. And so, out of these innumerable words of glorification, we shall lend 
our ears and listen to a single shoot and a single flower and their manner of expression, 
and learn the way in which they testify. 

Yes,  all  plants  and  all  trees  describe  their  Maker  with  numerous  tongues  in  such  a 

way that they leave those who study them in amazement,  

                                                

18 Qur’an, 17:44. 

 

700 

causing them to exclaim: “Glory be to God! How wonderfully they bear witness to Him!” 
Yes, the glorification of plants at the time their  flowers open, and the moment they 
produce new shoots, and when they offer their smiling words is as beautiful and clear as 
themselves. For through the beautiful mouth of each flower and the tongues of its orderly 
shoots and the words of  its well-measured seeds,  the order demonstrates wisdom and  is 
observedly within a balance which demonstrates knowledge. And the balance is within an 
embroidery of art which demonstrates skill and craft. And the embroidery of art is within 
an adornment which demonstrates favour and munificence. And the adornment is within 
subtle scents which demonstrate mercy and bestowal. And these meaningful qualities one 
within the other form such a tongue of testimony that it both describes the All-Beauteous 
Maker  through  His  Names,  and  portrays  Him  through  His  attributes,  and  expounds  the 
manifestation of His Names, and expresses His making Himself loved and known. 

If you hear such testimony from a single flower, will your doubts and suspicions and 
heedlessness  persist  when  you  listen  to  all  the  flowers  in  the  dominical  gardens  on  the 
face  of  the  earth  and  hear  with  what  elevated  strength  they  proclaim  the  necessary 
existence and unity of the  All-Glorious Maker? If they do persist, can  it  be said of  you 
that you are a conscious human being? 

Come,  now  look  carefully  at  a  tree!  See  its  delicate  mouth  within  the  orderly 
emergence of the leaves in spring, and the blossoms opening in a measured manner, and 
the  fruits swelling with wisdom and  mercy and dancing  at the  blowing of the  breeze  in 
the  hands  of  the  branches  like  innocent  children.  See  the  just  balance  within  the  wise 
order  expressed  through  the  tongue  of  the  leaves  becoming  green  at  a  generous  hand, 
through  that  of  the  flowers  smiling  with  the  joy  of  a  favour  received,  and  through  the 
words of  the  fruits  laughing  through  a  manifestation  of  mercy.  See  the  careful  arts  and 
embroideries  within the  balance demonstrating  justice; and the  mercy  within the  skilful 
embroideries  and  adornment;  and  the  various  sweet  tastes  and  delightful  scents,  which 
indicate mercy and bestowal; and the seeds, each of which is a miracle of power within 
the agreeable tastes: all these point in  most clear  fashion to the necessary existence and 
unity  of  an  All-Wise,  Generous,  Compassionate,  Beneficent,  Bountiful  Maker,  a 
Bestower  of  Beauty  and  Favours,  to  the  beauty  of  His  mercy  and  perfection  of  His 
dominicality. Thus, if you can listen at the same time to the tongues of disposition of all 
the trees on the earth, you will see and understand what exquisite jewels are to be found 
in the treasury of the verse: 

All that is in the heavens and on the earth extols God’s limitless glory.19

O  you  unhappy  heedless  one  who  supposes  himself  to  be  free  through  his 
ingratitude! If the All-Generous One of Beauty, Who makes Himself known to you and 
loved  by  you through these  innumerable tongues had  not wanted you to know Him, He 
would  have  silenced  them.  Since  they  have  not  been  silenced,  they  should  be  heeded. 
You cannot be saved by closing your ears in heedlessness. For the universe does not fall 
silent at you stopping up your ears, the beings within it will not be silent, the witnesses to 
Divine unity will not hold their tongues. And for sure, they will condemn you...

So glory be to Him in Whose hands is the dominion of all things.21 * And there is 
nothing but its treasuries are  with Us;  but We only send it down in a measure

down  rain  from  the  skies  providing  you  with  water  therewith,  and  you  are  not

Just as perfect wisdom and beauty of art are apparent in particulars and results and in 
details,  so  do  the  universal  elements  and  large  creatures  take  up  their  positions  in 
accordance  with  wisdom  and  art,  despite  their  apparently  being  mixed  up  together  by 
chance  without  order.  Thus,  as  its  other  wise  duties  show,  light  shines  in  order  to

20 The true meaning of this Twentieth Window occurred to my heart at one time in Arabic in this way: 
The sparkling of the light is through Your illuminating and making it known; 
The rolling on of the ages is through Your despatching and employing them; 
Glory be unto You, how mighty is Your rule! 
The flowing forth of the rivers is through Your storing them up and subjugating them; 
The decorations of stones is through Your designing and fashioning them; 
Glory be unto You, how sublime is Your wisdom! 
The smiling of the flowers is through Your adorning and beautifying them; 
The embellishing of fruits is through Your bestowal and munificence; 
Glory be unto You, how beautiful is Your art! 
The carolling of the birds is through Your making them speak and Your avail; 
The singing of the rain is through Your causing it to fall, Your bestowal;

Divine creatures on the face of the earth, with the permission of its Sustainer. This means 
that light is employed by a Wise Maker; by means of it, He makes manifest His antique 
works of art in the exhibitions of the market of this world. 

Now  consider  the  winds!  According  to the  testimony  of  their  other  wise,  generous 
benefits  and  duties,  they  are  hastening  to  extremely  numerous  and  important  tasks.  It 
means  that  their  movement  in  waves  is  a  being  employed,  a  being  despatched,  a  being 
utilized  by  an  All-Wise  Maker;  it  is  a  working  expeditiously  to  speedily  carry  out  the 
commands of their Sustainer. 

Now  consider  the  springs,  the  streams,  and  the  rivers!  Their  welling-up  out  of  the 
ground and out of mountains is not by chance. For it is demonstrated by the testimony of 
their benefits and fruits, the works of Divine mercy, and by the statement of their being 
stored up  in  mountains with the  balance of wisdom  in proportion to need, that they are 
subjugated and stored up by an  All-Wise Sustainer, and that their  flowing  forth  is their 
conforming exuberantly to His command. 

Now consider all the varieties of stones and jewels and minerals in the earth! Their 
decorations  and  beneficial  properties,  the  wise  benefits  connected  to  them,  and  their 
being prepared in a manner appropriate to human and animal needs and vital necessities 
all  show that they  are  made  in that way through  the decoration, arrangement, planning, 
and forming of an All-Wise Maker. 

Now consider the flowers and fruits! Their smiles, tastes, beauties, embroideries, and 
scents are all like invitations to and menus for the table of a Most Munificent Maker, an 
All-Compassionate  Bestower  of  Bounties;  they  are  given  as  various  menus  and 
invitations to each species of beings through their different colours, scents, and tastes. 

Now consider the birds! A certain indication that their twittering and chirruping is an 
All-Wise  Maker’s  causing  them  to  speak  is  the  astonishing  way  in  which  they  express 
their feelings to one another with those sounds, and state their intentions. 

Now consider the clouds! A definite indication that the pattering of the rain is not a 
meaningless sound and that the crashing of thunder and lightning is not a futile din is that 
those strange beings are created in empty space. Also drops of rain like the water of life 
are  milked  from  the  clouds,  suckling  the  living  creatures  on  the  earth  so  needy  and 
longing  for them. These  facts show that the pattering and crashing are  most meaningful 
and full of wisdom. For at the command of a Most Generous Sustainer, the rain calls out 
to those longing for it: “Good news! We are coming!” They express this meaning.

Now look at the sky and consider carefully only the moon out of all the innumerable 
bodies within it! That its motion is at the command of an All-Powerful and Wise One is 
demonstrated  by  the  important  instances  of  wisdom  connected  to  it  and  concerning  the 
earth. Since we have explained these in other places in the Risale-i Nur, we cut this short 
here. 

Thus,  the  universal  elements  we  have  enumerated  from  light  to  the  moon  open  in 
large  measure  a  truly  extensive  window.  They  proclaim  and  show  the  unity  of  a 
Necessarily  Existent  One,  and  the  perfection  of  His  power,  and  grandeur  of  His 
sovereignty. 

And  so  O  heedless  one!  If  you  are  able  to  silence  this  voice,  crashing  like  thunder 
and extinguish this light brilliant as the sun, forget God! Otherwise come to your senses! 
Say, All Glory be unto You! And, 

The seven heavens and the earth and all within them extol His limitless glory!23

And the sun runs its course to a place appointed, that is the determining of the 
Almighty, the All-Knowing.24 

The  universe’s  lamp,  the  sun,  forms  a  window  onto  the  existence  and  unity  of  the 
universe’s Maker that is as brilliant and luminous as the sun itself. Indeed, despite their 
great differences with regard to size, position, and speed, the twelve planets including our 
globe  known  as  the  solar  system  are  in  motion  and  revolve  with  perfect  order  and 
wisdom  and  perfect  balance  without  a  second’s  confusion,  and  are  bound  to  the  sun 
through  a  Divine  law  known  as  gravity,  that  is,  they  follow  their  leader  as  though  in 
prayer.  This  demonstrates  on  a  vast  scale  the  tremendousness  of  Divine  power  and  the 
unity of their Sustainer. Those lifeless bodies, those vast unconscious masses, are rotated 
and  employed  within  the  utmost  order  and  wise  balance,  in  various  forms  and  over 
varying  distances  and  in  varying  motions,  proving  the  degree  of  the  power  and  the 
wisdom;  you compare  for  yourself. If chance was to interfere the tiniest amount  in this 
vast  and  complex  matter,  it  would  cause  an  explosion  so  great  it  would  scatter  the 
universe. If it was to arrest the motion of one of them for a minute, it would cause it to 
leave its orbit and would open the possibility of its colliding with another planet. You

can understand how awesome would be the collision of bodies thousands of times larger 
than the earth. 

Now  we  shall  refer  to the  all-encompassing  knowledge  of  God  the  wonders  of  the 
solar  system,  that  is,  the  twelve  planets  which  are  the  sun’s  followers  and  fruits,  and 
consider only our own planet, the earth, which  is here  before our eyes.  We see that our 
planet is made to travel on a long journey around the sun by a dominical command as its 
most important duty –as is described in the Third Letter– in a way that demonstrates the 
grandeur  of  dominical  majesty  and  the  loftiness  of  the  sovereignty  of  the  Godhead  and 
the perfection of His  mercy  and wisdom. It has  been  made a dominical  ship  filled with 
the  wonders  of  Divine  art,  and  a  travelling  dwelling  like  an  exhibition,  for  God’s 
conscious  servants  to  gaze  on.  And  the  moon  has  been  attached  to  it  with  precise 
reckoning  for mighty  instances of wisdom,  like being an  hour-hand  for telling the time. 
The  moon  too  has  been  given  various  mansions  through  which  to  journey.  Thus,  these 
aspects  of  this  blessed  planet  of  ours  prove  the  necessary  existence  and  unity  of  a 
Possessor of Absolute Power with a testimony as powerful as the globe of the earth itself. 
You can make an analogy with the rest of the solar system from this. 

Furthermore, the sun is made to turn on its own axis like a spinning-wheel, in order 
to wind into a ball the immaterial threads called gravity and tie the planets with them and 
set them in order. So too is it impelled together with its planets at a speed that cuts five 
hours’  distance  a  second  towards,  according  to  one  estimate,  the  Constellation  of 
Hercules, or towards the ‘Sun of Suns’. This most certainly occurs through the power and 
at the command of the All-Glorious One, the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity. 
It  is  as  though  He  makes  the  solar  system  perform  these  manoeuvres  like  a  platoon  of 
soldiers under orders, and so demonstrates the majesty of His dominicality. 

O you astronomers! What chance can interfere in these matters? The hands of what 
causes can reach them? What force can draw close to this? Come on, you say! Would an 
All-Glorious Monarch such as this display impotence and permit others to have a role in 
his sovereignty?  Would He give to other hands  living creatures  in particular, which are 
the fruit, result, aim, and essence of the universe? Would He permit another to interfere? 
Especially  man,  would  He  leave  him  to  his  own  devices,  the  most  comprehensive  of 
those  fruits,  the  most  perfect  of  the  results,  vicegerent  of  the  earth,  and  His  mirror-like 
guest?  Would  He  refer  him  to  nature  and  chance  and  reduce  the  majesty  of  His 
sovereignty to nothing; reduce to nothing His perfect wisdom?

Have  We  not  made  the  earth  a  cradle,  *  And  the  mountains  as  pegs,  *  And 
created you as pairs?25 * So behold the signs of God’s Mercy, how He raises to 
life the earth after its death.26 

The globe of the earth is a head with a hundred thousand mouths. In each mouth are 
a hundred thousand tongues. On each tongue are a hundred thousand proofs, each one of 
which testifies in numerous ways to the necessary existence, unity, sacred attributes, and 
Most Beautiful Names of an All-Glorious One.  

Yes, we consider the first creation of the earth and we see that rock was created from 
matter in a fluid state, and that soil was created from rock. If that substance had remained 
fluid, it would not have been habitable, and if after becoming rock, the fluid had become 
hard as  iron,  it would  not have suitable  for use. So what gave it  its state was surely the 
wisdom  of  an  All-Wise  Maker  Who  saw  the  needs  of  the  earth’s  inhabitants.  Then  the 
layer of soil was thrown over the pegs of mountains so that the earthquakes arising from 
internal  upheavals  could  breathe  through  the  mountains  and  they  would  not  cause  the 
earth to be shaken out of its motion and duties, and so that the mountains would preserve 
the  earth  from  the  encroachment  of  the  sea,  and  all  would  be  storehouses  for  the  vital 
necessities  of  living  beings,  and  would  purify  the  air  from  noxious  gases  so  allowing 
living beings to breathe, and so that they would accumulate and hold water reserves, and 
would be a source and mine for the minerals necessary for living creatures. 

Thus,  this  situation  testifies  most  clearly  and  powerfully  to the  necessary  existence 

and unity of a Possessor of Absolute Power, an All-Wise and Compassionate One. 

O  geographers!  With  what  can  you  explain  this?  What  chance  could  make  this 
dominical ship full of these wonderful creatures into an exhibition of marvels, and spin it 
at  a  speed  whereby  it  covers  a  distance  of  twenty-four thousand  years  a  year  while  not 
allowing a single of the objects arranged on its face to fall off? 

Consider also the strange arts on the face of the earth. How wisely the elements are 
employed in their functions! How well they attend to the guests of the Most Merciful One 
on  the  earth  through  the  command  of  that  All-Wise  and  Powerful  One,  and  hasten  to 
serve them!

26 Qur’an, 30:50.

Also look at these embroidered lines within strange and wondrous arts on face of the 
earth, multicolored and full of strange wisdom! See how the brooks and streams, seas and 
rivers, mountains and hills have all been made dwellings and means of transport suitable 
for  His  various  creatures  and  servants.  See  how with  perfect  wisdom  and  order  He  has 
then filled them with hundreds of thousands of varieties of plants and animals, and given 
them life and made them rejoice, and how regularly minute by minute He discharges the 
creatures and empties those dwellings with death, and then once again in orderly fashion 
refills  them  in  the  form  of  ‘resurrection  after  death.’  This  testifies  with  hundreds  of 
thousands  of  tongues  to  the  necessary  existence  and  unity  of  an  All-Powerful  One  of 
Glory, an All-Wise One of Perfection. 

In Short: The earth, the face of which is an exhibition of marvels of art, a display of 
wonders  of  creation,  a  place  of  passage  for  the  caravans  of  beings,  and  a  mosque  and 
dwelling for the ranks of worshippers, is like the heart of all the universe; it thus displays 
the light of Divine unity to the same degree as the universe.  

O geographer! If the head of the earth has a hundred thousand mouths and with the 
hundred  thousand  tongues  in  each  it  makes  known  God,  and  still  you  do  not  recognize 
Him and plunge your head in the swamp of nature, then ponder over the greatness of your 
fault! Know what a grievous punishment it makes you deserve! Come to your senses and 
extract  your  head  from  the  swamp!  Say,  I  believe  in  God  in  Whose  hand  is  the 
sovereignty of all things.

Who creates death and life.27 

Life is the most luminous, the most beautiful of the miracles of dominical power. It 
is  the  most  powerful  and  most  brilliant  of  the  proofs  of  Divine  unity.  It  is  the  most 
comprehensive  and  most  shining  of  the  mirrors  displaying  the  manifestations  of  the 
Eternally Besought One. Yes, on its own, life makes known a Living and Self-Subsistent 
One together with all his Names and acts. For life is a light, a medicament, like a potion 
blended  from  numerous  attributes.  Just  as  the  seven  colours  are  combined  in  light,  and 
various drugs are blended together in a medicament, so life is a reality made of  

                                                

27 Qur’an, 67:2. 

 

707 

numerous attributes. Some of the attributes in its reality expand by means of the senses; 
they unfold and are differentiated. However the greater part make themselves perceived 
in the form of the emotions; they make themselves known by welling up out of life. 

Furthermore,  life  comprises  provision,  mercy,  grace,  and  wisdom,  which  are 
dominant in the regulation, and administration of the universe. It is as if life fastens them 
on  behind  it  and  draws  them  into  the  place  it  enters.  For  example,  when  life  enters  a 
body, the Name of All-Wise is also manifested; it makes its home well and orders it with 
wisdom. In the same way, the Name of All-Generous is manifested, and it organizes and 
decorates its dwelling according to its needs. At the same time, the manifestation of the 
Name  of  All-Compassionate  is  apparent;  it  bestows  all  sorts  of  bounties  for  the 
continuance and perfection of life. Again at the same time, the manifestation of the Name 
of  Provider  appears;  it  produces  the  sustenance,  material  and  immaterial,  necessary  for 
the perpetuation and unfolding of the life, and in part stores them up within its body. That 
is  to  say,  life  is  like  a  point  of  focus;  various  attributes  enter  one  another,  indeed,  they 
become one and the same. It is as if in its entirety life is both knowledge, and at the same 
time power, and at the same time  wisdom and  mercy, and so on... Thus, with regard to 
this comprehensive essence, life is a mirror of the Eternally Besought One reflecting the 
essential dominical attributes. It is due to this mystery that the Necessarily Existent One, 
Who  is  the  Ever-Living  and  Self-Subsistent  One,  creates  life  in  great  abundance  and 
plenitude,  and  scatters  it  far  and  wide  and  broadcasts  it,  and  gathers  everything  around 
life and makes it serve it. For life’s duty is great. Yes, it is not easy to be the mirror of the 
Eternally Besought One, it is not some petty duty. 

Thus, the instantaneous and continuous coming into existence from nothing of these 
countless,  numberless  lives  which  we  all  the  time  see  before  our  eyes,  –and  of  spirits, 
which are the origins and essences of  lives– their being sent, demonstrate the necessary 
existence,  sacred  attributes,  and  Most  Beautiful  Names  of  a  Necessarily  Existent  and 
Ever-Living  and  Self-Subsistent  One  as  clearly  as  sunbeams  show  the  existence  of  the 
sun.  Just  as  someone  who  does  not  recognize  and  accept  the  existence  of  the  sun  is 
compelled to deny the light which fills the day, so one who does not recognize the Sun of 
Divine  Oneness,  Who  is  Ever-Living  and  Self-Subsistent  and  the  Giver  of  Life  and 
Death, has to deny the existence of the living creatures which fill the earth and even the 
past and the future; he has to fall a hundred times lower than an animal, to fall from the 
level of life to become something utterly ignorant and lifeless.

There is no God but He, everything will perish save His countenance, His is the 
command and to Him shall you return.28 

Death is a proof of dominicality as much as life is a proof of it; it is a most powerful 

proof of Divine unity. As the verse, 

Who creates death and life29 

indicates,  death  is  not  non-existence,  annihilation,  non-being,  an  authorless  extinction; 
rather,  as  is  shown  in  the  First  Letter,  it  is  a  being  discharged  from  service  by  an  All-
Wise  Author,  a  change  of  residence,  an  exchange  of  bodies,  a  rest  from  duty,  a  being 
freed from the prison of the body; it is a wise and orderly work of wisdom. Indeed, just as 
the living face of the earth and the well-fashioned and living creatures upon it testify to 
the necessary existence and unity of an All-Wise Maker, so too with their deaths do those 
living beings bear witness to the eternity and unity of an Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent 
One.  Since  it  is  proved  and  elucidated  in  the  Twenty-Second  Word  that  death  is  an 
extremely  powerful  proof  of  Divine  unity  and  eternity,  we  refer  the  discussion  to  that 
Word and here only explain one important point. It is as follows: 

Both  with  their  existences  do  living  beings  point  to  the  existence  of  a  Necessarily 
Existent One, and with their deaths do those living beings testify to the eternity and unity 
of an Ever-Living Eternal One. For example, the face of the earth, which is a single living 
creature,  points  to  its  Maker  with  its  order  and  circumstances;  so  too  it  points  to  Him 
when it dies. That is, when winter conceals the earth’s face with its white shroud, it turns 
the gazes of men away from itself –their gaze moves to the past behind the corpse of that 
departing spring– and it shows them a far wider scene. That is to say, all the past springs 
of the  earth, which  were all  miracles of power, inform them that new  living springtime 
creatures of the earth will come, and since they all testify to the existence of those future 
wonders of Divine power, each a living earth, they testify brilliantly and powerfully and 
on a vast scale to the necessary existence, unity, everlastingness, and eternity of an All-
Glorious  Maker,  an  All-Powerful  One  of  Perfection,  an  Ever-Living  Eternal  One;  they 
demonstrate such brilliant proofs that whether one wants to or not they make one declare: 
“I believe in God, the One, the Unique!” 

                                                

28 Qur’an, 28:88. 
29 Qur’an, 67:2. 

 

709 

In Short: According to the meaning of the verse, 
And gives life to the earth after its death,30 

just  as  this  living  earth  testifies  to the  Maker  with  the  spring,  so  with  its  death  it  turns 
man’s gaze to the miracles of Divine power lined up on the two wings of time, the past 
and the future; it alludes to thousands of miracles of power in place of one miracle. And 
each  of  those  springs  testifies  more  certainly  than  this  present  spring,  for  those  which 
have departed towards the past have gone together with their apparent causes, and after 
them  others  like  them  have  come  in  their  places.  This  means  that  apparent  causes  are 
nothing:  only  that  an  All-Powerful  One  of  Glory  creates the  springs,  and  tying  them  to 
causes with His wisdom shows that He has sent them. As for the faces of the earth lined 
up  in  future  time,  they  testify  still  more  brilliantly.  For  they  will  be  made  anew  from 
nothing,  from  non-being, and sent; they  will  be put on the earth, made to do their  duty, 
and then sent away. 

And  so, O heedless one deviated  into nature and  drowning  in  its swamp! How can 
something which does not possess hands wise and powerful enough to reach all the past 
and  all  the  future  interfere  in  the  life  of  the  earth?  Can  your  total  nonentity  of  nature 
interfere  in  it? If  you want to be saved, say:  “At the very  most, nature is a  notebook of 
Divine power. And as for chance, it is a veil to hidden Divine wisdom which conceals our 
ignorance.” Approach the truth!

Like one struck points to the striker, and a finely fashioned work of art necessitates 
the artist, and an offspring requires a parent, and an under surface demands a top surface, 
and so on... like all these qualities known as relative matters which are not absolute and 
cannot  exist  without  each  other,  contingency,  which  is  apparent  in  particulars  in  the 
universe as well as in it as a whole, points to necessity. And the state of being acted upon 
which is to be seen in all of them points to an act, and the createdness apparent in all of 
them points to creativity, and the multiplicity and composition to be seen in all demand 
unity. And necessity, an act, creativity, and unity clearly and necessarily require one who 
is  not  contingent,  acted  upon,  numerous,  compounded,  and  created,  but  bears  the 
attributes of being necessary, an agent, one, and a creator. In which case, all contingency, 
states  of  being  acted  upon,  createdness,  multiplicity  and  composition  testify  to  the 
Necessarily Existent One, the One Who acts as He wills, the Creator of  All Things, the 
Single One of Unity.

In  Short:  Just  as  necessity  is  apparent  from  contingency,  the  act  from  the  state  of
being acted upon, and unity from multiplicity, and the existence of the former indicate the
latter with certainty, in the same way, qualities like createdness and having all their needs
provided  for, which  are to be seen  in  beings, clearly point to the existence of attributes
like Making and Providing. In turn the existence of these attributes point necessarily and
self-evidently  to the  existence  of  an  All-Compassionate  Maker  Who  is  a  Creator  and  a
Provider. That is to say, with the tongues of the hundreds of attributes of this sort which
they  bear,  every  being  testifies  to  hundreds  of  the  Necessarily  Existent  One’s  Most
Beautiful Names. If this testimony is not admitted, it becomes necessary to deny all the
attributes of this sort pertaining to beings...

The  ever-renewed  instances  of  beauty  and  fairness  passing  over  the  faces  of  the 
beings  in  the  universe  show  that  they  are  shadows  of  the  manifestations  of  an  Eternal
Beauteous One. Yes,  bubbles sparkling on the surface of a river and then disappearing,
and other bubbles coming after them and sparkling like those that preceded them shows
that they are mirrors to the rays of a perpetual sun. In the same way, the flashes of beauty
which  sparkle  on  the  travelling  beings  in  the  river  of  flowing  time  point  to  an  Eternal
Beauteous One and are signs of Him. 

Also, the ardent love in the heart of the universe points to an Undying Beloved. As is
indicated  by  the  fact  that  something  which  is  not  found  in  the  tree  itself  will  not  be
present  in authentic  form  in  its  fruit, the ardent  love of God present  in human kind, the
responsive  fruit  of  the  tree  of  the  universe,  shows  that  a  true  love  and  passion  is  to  be
found in all the universe, but in other forms. In which case, this true love and passion in
the heart of the universe points to a Pre-Eternal Beloved. Moreover, all the attractions and
magnetic  forces  which  appear  in  numerous  different  forms  in  the  heart of  the  universe,
show to aware hearts that they are thus through the attraction of a drawing truth. 

Also, according to the consensus of the saints and those who uncover the mysteries
of  creation,  who  are  the  most  sensitive  and  luminous  of  creatures,  relying  on  their
illuminations and witnessing, they have received the manifestation of a Beauteous One of
Glory  and  through  their  illuminations  have  perceived  that  All-Glorious  One  of  Beauty

Necessarily  Existent  One,  to  the  existence  of  a  Beauteous  One  of  Glory,  and  to  His
making Himself known to man. 

Also, the pen of beautifying and adorning which works on beings and on the face of
the  universe  points  clearly  to  the  beauty  of  the  Names  of  the  pen’s  Owner.  Thus,  the
beauty on the face of the universe, and the love in its heart, and the attraction in its breast,
and  the  uncovering  and  witnessing  in  its  eye,  and  the  beauty  and  adornment  on  it  as  a
whole,  open  up  a  truly  subtle  and  luminous  window.  It  displays  to  aware  minds  and
hearts a Beauteous One of Glory, an Undying Beloved, an Eternal Worshipped One all of
Whose Names are beautiful. 

O heedless one who flounders amid suffocating doubts in the darkness of matter and

God  is  the  Creator  of  all  things,  and  of  all  things  He  is  the  Guardian  and
Disposer.32 

We look at things which appear to be causes and effects in the universe and we see
that  the  most  elevated  cause  possesses  insufficient  power  for  the  most  ordinary  effect.
This  means that causes are a veil, and something  else  makes the effects. To take only a
small example out of innumerable creatures let us consider the faculty of memory, which
is situated in man’s head in a space as tiny as a mustard seed: we see that it is like a book
so comprehensive –indeed, like a library– that within it is written without confusion the
entire story of a person’s life. 

What cause can  be shown  for this  miracle of power? The grey  matter of the  brain?
The simple unconscious particles of its cells? The winds of chance and coincidence? But
that miracle of art can only be the work of an All-Wise Maker Who, in order to inform
man that all the actions he has performed have been recorded and will be recalled at the
time of accounting, writes out a small  ledger  from the great book of  man’s deeds to be
published at the resurrection, and gives  it to the  hand of  his  mind. Thus, since they  are
comparable  to  man’s  faculty  of  memory,  make  an  analogy  with  all  eggs,  seeds,  and
grains, and then compare other effects to these small and

comprehensive  miracles.  Because  whichever  effect  and  work  of  art  you  look  at,  it 
contains such wonderful art that not only its common, simple cause, but if all causes were 
to gather, they would declare their impotence before it.  

For example, suppose the sun, which is imagined to be a large cause, to possess will 
and  consciousness;  if  it  is  said  to  it:  “Are  you  able  to  make  a  fly?”,  of  course  it  would 
reply:  “Through  my  Creator’s  bounty,  there  is  plenty  of  light,  heat,  and  colours  in  my 
shop, but such things in the fly’s being as eyes, ears, and life are neither in my shop, nor 
are they within my power.” 

Furthermore,  the  wonderful  art  and  adornment  in  effects  dismiss  causes,  and 
indicating  the  Necessarily  Existent  One,  the  Causer  of  Causes,  in  accordance  with  the 
verse, 

And to Him goes back every affair,33 

hand over matters to Him. In the same way, the results, purposes, and benefits attached to 
effects demonstrate self-evidently that they are the works of an  All-Generous Sustainer, 
an All-Wise and Compassionate One, beyond the veil of causes. For unconscious causes 
certainly  cannot  think  of  some  aim  and  work  for  it.  And  yet  we  see  that  each  creature 
which  comes  into  existence  does  so  following  not  one,  but  many  aims,  benefits,  and 
instances  of  wisdom.  That  means  an  All-Wise  and  Generous  Sustainer  makes  those 
things and sends them. He makes those benefits the aim of their existence. 

For example, it is going to rain. It is obvious how distant the causes that apparently 
result in rain are from thinking of animals and having pity and compassion on them. That 
means it is sent to their assistance through the wisdom of a Compassionate Creator Who 
creates  the  animals  and  guarantees  their  sustenance.  Rain  is  even  called  ‘mercy’. 
Because, since it comprises numerous works of mercy and benefits, it is as if mercy has 
become embodied as rain, has been formed into drops, and arrives in that way. 

Furthermore,  all  the  finely  adorned  plants  which  smile  at  creatures  and  the 
embellishments  and  displays  in  animals  self-evidently  point  to  the  necessary  existence 
and unity of an All-Glorious One behind the veil of the Unseen; One Who wants to make 
Himself known and loved through these beautifully adorned fine arts. That is to say, this 
adornment  in  things  and  these  displays  and  embellishment  indicate  of  a  certainty  the 
attributes of making known and making loved. While the attributes of making known and 
making  loved  self-evidently  testify  to  the  necessary  existence  and  unity  of  an  All-
Powerful Maker Who is Loving and Known. 

In  Short:  Since  causes  are  extremely  commonplace  and  impotent  and  the  effects 
attributed to them are most valuable and full of art, this dismisses causes. The aims and 
benefits of effects also discharge ignorant and lifeless  

                                                

33 Qur’an, 11:123. 

713

causes, and hand them over to an All-Wise Maker. Also, the adornment and skill on the
face  of  effects  indicates  a  Wise  Maker  Who  wants  to  make  His  power  known  to
conscious beings and desires to make Himself loved.  

O wretched worshipper of causes! With what can you explain these important truths?
How  can  you  deceive  yourself?  If  you  have  sense,  rend  the  veil  of  causes  and  declare:
“He is One, He has no partners!” Be saved from innumerable delusions! 

Twenty-Eighth Window 

And  among  His  signs  is  the  creation  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth  and  the
variations in your tongues and in your colours; verily in that are signs for those
who know.34 

We look at the universe, and we see that a wisdom and ordering embrace everything

from the cells of the body to the totality of the world.  

We  look  at  the  cells  of  the  body,  and  we  see  that  through  the  command  and
according to the law of one who considers what is beneficial for the body and administers
it, there is a significant management in those miniscule cells. One the one hand a sort of
sustenance  is  stored  up  in  the  stomach  in  the  form  of  fat  and  expended  at  the  time  of
need, and on the other in those tiny cells there is a regulation and storing up. 
We look at plants, and a most wise planning and nurturing are apparent. 
We  look  at  animals,  and  we  see  a  rearing  and  nurturing  which  are  generous  to the 

utmost degree. 

We look at the mighty elements of the universe, and we see a majestic government

and illumination following momentous aims. 

We  look  at  the  universe  as  a  whole,  and  we  see  a  perfect  ordering  for  exalted

instances of wisdom and elevated aims, as though it was a country, a city, or a palace. 

As  is described and proved  in the  First Stopping-Place of the Thirty-Second  Word,
from minute particles to the stars, not the tiniest place is left for associating partners with
God. All  beings are  in  effect so interrelated that one who cannot subjugate all the  stars
and  hold  them  in  his  hand,  cannot  make  a  particle  heed  his  claims  to  be  its  lord  and
sustainer. It is necessary to own all the stars in order to be the true sustainer of a single
particle.  

Furthermore, as is described and proved in the Second Stopping-Place of the Thirty-

Second Word, one not capable of creating and arranging the  

                                                 

34 Qur’an, 30:22. 

714

heavens cannot make the individual features on the human face. That is to say, one who
is  not  Sustainer  of  all  the  heavens  cannot  make  the  distinguishing  features  on  a  single
human face. 

Thus,  this  is  a  window  as  large  as  the  universe,  which,  if  looked  through,  the
following verses will also appear to the mind’s eye, written on the pages of the universe
in large letters: 

God  is  the  Creator  of  all  things,  and  of  all  things  He  is  the  Guardian  and
Disposer * His are the keys of the heavens and the earth.35 

One  who  does  not  see  these  has  either  no  mind  or  no  heart.  Or  he  is  an  animal  in

human form! 

Twenty-Ninth Window 

And there is not a thing but extols His limitless glory and praise.36 

One  spring  I  was  setting  out  on  a  journey,  a  stranger,  and  deep  in  contemplation.
While skirting a hill, a brilliant yellow buttercup struck my eye. It immediately brought to
mind the same species of buttercup I had seen long before in my native land and in other
countries. This meaning was imparted to my heart: whoever this flower is the seal of, the
stamp of, the signature of, the  impress of, all the flowers of that species throughout the
earth are surely His seals, His stamps. After this notion of the seal, the following thought
occurred to me: just as a seal stamped on a letter denotes the letter’s author, in the same
way,  this  flower  is  a  seal  signifying  the  Most  Merciful  One.  And  this  hillock  which  is
inscribed with the impresses of these species and written with the lines of these plants so
full of meaning, is the missive of the flower’s Maker. This hill too is a seal. This plateau
and plain have taken on the form of a missive of the Most Merciful One. 

After this thought, the following fact came to mind: like a seal, everything ascribes
all things to its own Creator; it proves each is the letter of its own Scribe. Thus, all things
are windows onto Divine unity in such a way that each ascribes all things to a Single One
of Unity. That  is to say, there  is  an  impress so wonderful, an art so miraculous  in each
thing, and especially  in each  living  being, that the one who  makes  it and  inscribes  it so
meaningfully  can  make  all  things,  and  the  one  who  makes  all  things  is  certainly  Him.
That is to say, one who cannot make all things cannot create a single thing. 

                                                 

35 Qur’an, 39:62-3. 
36 Qur’an, 17:44. 

715

O heedless one! Look at the face of the universe! See the pages of beings one within
the other like letters of the Eternally Besought One, each letter stamped with innumerable
seals  of  Divine  unity!  Who  can  deny  the  testimony  of  all  these  seals?  What  power  can
silence them? Whichever of them you listen to with the ear of the heart, you will hear it
declaring: “I testify that there is no god but God!” 

Thirtieth Window 

If there were in the heavens and the earth other gods besides God, there surely
would  have  been  confusion  in  both.37  *  Everything  will  perish  save  His
countenance; His is the command, and to Him shall you return.38 

This  is the  Window of the scholars of theology (kalam), based on contingency  and
createdness,  and  their  highway  for  proving  the  Necessarily  Existent  One.  For  all  the
details,  we  refer  you  to the  scholars’  great  books  like  Sharh  al-Mawaqif  and  Sharh  al-
Maqasid,  and  here  only  demonstrate one  or two rays  which  spill  on  the  spirit  from  the
effulgence of the Qur’an and this Window. It is as follows:  

It  is  the  requirement  of  dominion  and  rulership  not  to  accept  rivals;  they  reject
partnership; they repudiate interference. It is because of this that if there are two headmen
in a village, they will destroy its tranquillity and order. Or if there are two chief officials
in  a  district, or two  governors  in  a  province,  they  will  cause  chaos.  Or  if  there  are  two
kings in a country, they will cause complete and stormy confusion. Since a pale shadow
and  petty  example  of  dominion  and  rulership  in  impotent  human  beings  needy  for
assistance does  not accept the  interference of rivals, opponents, or peers, then  you  may
compare  how  fully  a  rulership  which  is  in  the  form  of  absolute  sovereignty  and  a
dominion  at  the  degree  of  dominicality  will  enforce  that  law  of  the  rejection  of
interference  in  One  Possessing  Absolute  Power.  That  is  to  say,  the  most  definite  and
constant necessity of Godhead and dominicality are unity and singleness. The clear proof
and certain testimony to this are the perfect order and beautiful harmony in the universe.
There is such an order from the wing of a fly to the lamps in the heavens that the intellect
prostrates  before  it  in  wonder  and  appreciation,  declaring:  “Glory  be  to  God!  What
wonders  God  has  willed!  How  great  are  God’s  blessings!”  Had  there  been  an  iota  of
space for partners to God, and had there been interference, as the verse, 

                                                 

37 Qur’an, 21:22. 
38 Qur’an, 28:88. 

 

716 

If there were in the heavens and the earth other gods besides God, there would 
have been confusion in both39 

indicates, the order would have been destroyed, the form changed, and signs of disorder 
would have appeared. But as the verses, 

So  turn  your  vision  again:  do  you  see  any  flaw?  *  Then  turn  your  vision  a 
second  time;  your  vision  will  come  back  to  you  in  a  state  dazzled  and  truly 
defeated40 

state  and  point out,  however  much  the  human  gaze  tries  to  find  faults,  it  can  find  none 
anywhere,  and  returns  worn  out  to  its  dwelling,  the  eye,  and  says  to  the  fault-finding 
mind who sent  it: “I am worn out for nothing; there are no  faults.” This  shows that the 
order  and  regularity  are  most  perfect.  That  is  to  say,  the  order  in  the  universe  is  a 
definitive witness to Divine unity. 

Come now, let us consider ‘createdness’. The scholars of theology stated:  
“The  world  is  subject  to  change.  And  everything  which  is  subject  to  change  is 
created. Every created thing has a creator, a maker. In which case, the universe has a pre-
eternal creator.” 

And we say, yes, the universe is created. For we see that every century, indeed, every 
year and every season one universe, one world, goes and another comes. This means that 
there  is  an  All-Powerful  One  of  Glory  Who,  creating  the  universe  anew,  creates  a 
universe every year, indeed, every season, and every day, and shows it to the aware and 
conscious. Then He takes it back and puts another in its place. He attaches one universe 
after the other like the links of a chain, and hangs them on the string of time. For sure, the 
universes which appear from nothing and disappear before our eyes every spring, each a 
new universe the  same as this world, are  miracles of the power of the Omnipotent One 
Who creates them. The One Who continuously creates and changes the worlds within the 
world most definitely created the world too. And He made the world and the face of the 
earth a guest-house for those great visitors. 

Now let us come to the discussion of ‘contingency’. The scholars of theology said: 
“Contingency  is  equal  in  regard  to  both  existence  and  non-existence.”  That  is,  if 
existence and non-existence are both equally possible, one who will specify, prefer, and 
create is necessary. For contingent beings cannot create one another in uninterrupted and 
never-ending chains of cause and effect. Neither can one create another, and that the next, 
in the form of causation. In which case there is a Necessarily Existent One Who creates 
them. They rendered null and void the never-ending causal sequences with the  

                                                

39 Qur’an, 21:22. 
40 Qur’an, 67:3-4. 

 

717 

famous  twelve  categorical  proofs  called  ‘the  ladder  argument,’  and  demonstrated 
causality to be impossible. They cut the chains of causes and proved the existence of the 
Necessarily Existent One. 

And we say this: it is more certain and easier to demonstrate a stamp peculiar to the 
Creator of All Things on everything than causes being cut at the extremities of the world 
with the proofs refuting causality. Through the effulgence of the Qur’an, all the Windows 
and  all  the  Words  are  based  on  this  principle.  Nevertheless,  the  point  of  contingency 
possesses  an  infinite  breadth.  It  demonstrates  the  existence  of  the  Necessarily  Existent 
One in innumerable respects. It is not restricted to the way of the scholars of theology – 
cutting  the  chains  of  causes,  which  in  truth  is  a  mighty  and  broad  highway;  it  opens  a 
path  to  knowledge  of  the  Necessarily  Existent  One  by  ways  beyond  count.  It  is  as 
follows: 

We  see  that  in  its  existence,  its  attributes,  and  its  lifetime,  while  hesitant  among 
innumerable  possibilities,  that  is,  among  truly  numerous  ways  and  aspects,  each  thing 
follows  a well-ordered way  in regard to its  being  in  innumerable respects. Its attributes 
also  are  given  it  in  a  particular  way.  All  the  attributes  and  states  which  it  changes 
throughout its life are specified in the same fashion. This means it is impelled on a wise 
way amid innumerable ways through the will of one who specifies, the choice of one who 
chooses, and the creation of a wise creator. He clothes it with well-ordered attributes and 
states.  Then  it  is  taken  out  of  isolation  and  made  part  of  a  compound  body,  and  the 
possibilities increase, for they may be found in that body in thousands of ways. Whereas 
among  those  fruitless  possibilities,  it  is  given  a  particular,  fruitful  state,  whereby 
important  results  and  benefits  are  obtained  from  that  body,  and  it  is  made  to  carry  out 
important  functions.  Then  the  body  is  made  a  component  of  another  body.  Again  the 
possibilities  increase,  for it could exist  in thousands of ways. Thus,  it is given one state 
among those thousands of ways. And through that state it is made to perform important 
functions; and so on. It progressively demonstrates more certainly the necessary existence 
of an All-Wise Planner. It makes known that it is being impelled by the command of an 
All-Knowing Commander. Body  within  body, each  has a  function, a well-ordered duty, 
in all the compounds that one within the other themselves become components of larger 
compounds, and has relationships particular to each, in the same way that a soldier has a 
function and well-ordered duty in his squad, his company, his battalion, his regiment, his 
division, and his army, and a relationship particular to each of these sections, one within 
the other. A cell from the pupil of your eye has a duty in your eye and a relationship with 
it, and has wise functions and duties in your head as a whole and a relationship with it. If 
it confuses these the tiniest jot, the health and organization of the body will be spoilt. It 
has particular functions with regard to each of the veins, the sensory and motor  

718

nerves, and even the body as a whole, and wise relations with them. That specified state
has  been  given  it  within  thousands  of  possibilities  through  the  wisdom  of  an  All-Wise
Maker. 

In just the same way, each of the creatures in the universe testifies to the Necessarily
Existent One through the particular being, the wise form, the beneficial attributes given it
among  numerous  possibilities.  So  too  when  they  enter  compounds,  those  creatures
proclaim  their  Maker  with  a  different  tongue  in  each  compound.  Step  by  step  till  the
greatest  compound,  through  their  relations,  functions,  and  duties,  they  testify  to  the
necessary  existence,  choice,  and  will  of  their  All-Wise  Maker.  Because  the  one  who
situates  a  thing  in  all  the  compounds  while  preserving  its  wise  relations,  must  be  the
Creator of all the compounds. That is to say,  it is as though one single thing testifies to
Him  with  thousands  of  tongues.  Thus,  from  the  point  of  view  of  contingency,  the
testimony  to  the  existence  of  the  Necessarily  Existent  One  is  as  numerous,  not  as  the
number of beings in the universe, but as the attributes of beings and the compounds they
form. 

O  heedless  one!  One  who  does  not  hear  this  testimony,  these  voices  which  fill  the

universe, must be dead and unreasoning, is that not so? Come on, you say... 

Thirty-First Window 

We have created man in the best of forms.41 * And in the earth there are signs
for those who are certain * And in your own selves; will you not then not see?42 

This Window is the Window of man, and it is concerned with man’s self. For more
elaborate  discussions  of  it  in  this  respect,  we  refer  you  to  the  detailed  books  of  the
thousands  of  learned  and  scholarly  saints,  and  here  only  point  out  a  few  principles  we
have received from the effulgence of the Qur’an. It is like this: 

As  is  explained  in  the  Eleventh  Word,  “Man  is  a  missive  so  comprehensive  that
through his self, Almighty God makes perceived to him all His Names.” For the details
we refer you to the other Words, and here only explain three Points. 

                                                 

41 Qur’an, 95:4. 
42 Qur’an, 51:20-1. 

 

719 

FIRST POINT 

Man is a mirror to the Divine Names in three aspects. 
The  First  Aspect:  Like  the  darkness  of  the  night  shows  up  light,  so  through  his 
weakness and impotence, his poverty and need, his defects and faults, man makes known 
the power, strength, riches, and mercy of an All-Powerful One of Glory, and so on... he 
acts as a mirror to numerous Divine attributes in this way. Even, through searching for a 
point  of  support  in  his  infinite  impotence  and  boundless  weakness  in  the  face  of  his 
innumerable enemies, his  conscience perpetually  looks to the Necessarily Existent One. 
And  since  he  is  compelled  in  his  utter  poverty  and  endless  need  to  seek  for  a  point  of 
assistance in the face of his innumerable aims, his conscience in that respect all the time 
leans  on  the  Court  of  an  All-Compassionate  One  of  Riches  and  opens  its  hands  in 
supplication  to  Him.  That  is  to  say,  in  regard  to  this  point  of  support  and  point  of 
assistance in the conscience, two small windows are opened onto the Court of Mercy of 
the All-Powerful and All-Compassionate One, which may all the time be looked through. 
The  Second  Aspect  of  being  mirror-like  is  this:  through  particulars  like  his  partial 
knowledge,  power,  senses  of  sight  and  hearing,  ownership  and  sovereignty,  which  are 
sorts  of  samples  given  to  him,  man  acts  as  a  mirror  to  the  knowledge,  power,  sight, 
hearing,  and  sovereignty  of  dominicality  of  the  Master  of  the  Universe;  he  understands 
them and makes them known. For example, he says: “Just as I make this house and know 
how  to  make  it,  and  I  see  it  and  own  it  and  administer  it,  so  the  mighty  palace  of  the 
universe has a Maker. Its Maker knows it, sees it, makes it, administers it.” And so on.. 

The Third Aspect of being mirror-like: man acts as a mirror to the Divine Names, the 
imprint  of  which  are  upon  him.  There  are  more  than  seventy  Names  the  impresses  of 
which  are  apparent  in  man’s  comprehensive  nature.  These  have  been  described  to  a 
degree at the start of the Third Stopping- Place of the Thirty-Second Word. For example, 
through his creation, man shows the Names of Maker and Creator; through his being on 
the  ‘Most  Excellent  of  Patterns,’  the  Names  of  Most  Merciful  and  All-Compassionate, 
and  through  the  fine  way  he  is  nurtured  and  raised,  the  Names  of  All-Generous  and 
Granter  of  Favours,  and  so  on;  he  shows  the  differing  impresses  of  different  Names 
through all his members and faculties, all his organs and limbs, all his subtle senses and 
faculties, all his feelings and emotions. That is to say, just as among the Names there is a 
Greatest Name, so among the impresses of those Names there is a greatest impress, and 
that is man. 

O you who considers himself to be a true man! Read yourself! You may otherwise be 

either animal-like or inanimate! 

 

720 

SECOND POINT 

This points to an important mystery of Divine oneness. It is like this:  
The  relationship  between  man’s  spirit  and  his  body  is  such  that  it  causes  all  his 
members and parts to assist one another. That is, man’s spirit is a commanding law from 
among the laws pertaining to creation –the manifestation of Divine will– which has been 
clothed in external existence, and is a subtle dominical faculty. Thus, in administering the 
parts of the body, and hearing their immaterial voices, and seeing their needs, they do not 
form obstacles to one another, nor do they confuse the spirit. Near and far are the same in 
relation to the spirit. They  do not veil one  another. If the spirit wishes,  it can  bring the 
majority  to  the  assistance  of  one.  If  it  wishes,  it  can  know,  perceive,  and  administer 
through each part of the body. Even, if it acquires great luminosity, it may see and hear 
through all the parts. 

In the  same way, And God’s is highest similitude,43 since the spirit, a commanding 
law of Almighty God, displays this ability in the body and members of man, who is the 
microcosm, surely, the boundless acts, the innumerable voices, the endless supplications, 
the  uncountable  matters  in  the  universe,  which  is  the  macrocosm,  will  present  no 
difficulty to the all-embracing will  and absolute power of the Necessarily Existent One. 
They  will  not  form  obstacles  to  one  another.  They  will  not  occupy  that  All-Glorious 
Creator,  nor  confuse  Him.  He  sees  them  all  simultaneously,  and  hears  all  the  voices 
simultaneously. Close and distant are the same for Him. If He wishes, He sends all to the 
assistance  of  one.  He  can  see  everything  and  hear  their  voices  through  everything.  He 
knows everything through everything, and so on... 

THIRD POINT 

Life  has  a  most  important  nature  and  significant  function,  but  since  it  has  been 
discussed in detail in the Window on Life [the Twenty-Third Window] and in the Eighth 
Phrase of the Twentieth Letter, we refer you to those, and here only make the following 
reminder. 

The impresses in life, which, intermingled, boil up in the form of emotions, point to 
numerous  Names  and  essential  Divine  qualities.  They  act  as  mirrors  reflecting  the 
essential  qualities  of  the  Ever-Living  and  Self-Subsistent  One  in  most  brilliant  fashion. 
But this is not the time to explain this mystery to those who do not recognize God or do 
not yet fully affirm Him, and so we here close this door... 

                                                

43 Qur’an, 16:60. 

 

721 

Thirty-Second Window 

It is He Who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the Religion of Truth to 
make  it  prevail  over  all  religion,  and  God  is  sufficient  as  witness.44  *  Say:  O 
men!  I  am  sent  unto  you  all  as  the  Messenger  of  God,  to  Whom  belongs  the 
dominion  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  there  is  no  God  but  He;  it  is  He  Who 
gives life and death.45  

This is the Window of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him), 
the Sun of the skies of messengership, indeed, the Sun of Suns. Since it has been proved 
in  the  Thirty-First  Word,  the  Treatise  on  the  Ascension,  in  the  Nineteenth  Word,  the 
Treatise  on  the  prophethood of  Muhammad  (Peace  and  blessings  be  upon  him),  and  in 
Nineteen Signs of the Nineteenth Letter, how luminous and evident is this most brilliant, 
large, and light-giving window, we shall think of those two Words, and that Letter and its 
Nineteenth Sign, and refer the word to them. For now we just say this: 

Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him), the living, articulate proof of Divine 
unity, demonstrated and proclaimed Divine unity throughout his life with the two wings 
of messengership and sainthood, that is, with a strength that comprised the consensus of 
all  the  prophets  who  had  preceded  him  and  the  unanimity  of  the  saints  and  purified 
scholars who came after him. He opened up a window onto knowledge of God as broad 
and  brilliant  and  luminous  as  the  World  of  Islam.  Millions  of  purified  and  veracious 
scholars  like Imam Ghazzali, Imam-i Rabbani, Muhyiddin al-’Arabi, and  ‘Abd al-Qadir 
Geylani look through that Window, and show it also to others. Is there any veil that can 
obscure  a  Window  such  as  this?  Can  the  person  who  accusingly  does  not  look through 
this Window be said to possess reason? Come on, you say!

Thirty-Third Window 

Praise be to God, Who has revealed to His servant the Book, and has allowed no 
crookedness therein.46 * Alif. Lam. Ra. A Book which We have revealed to you, 
in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness into light.47 

Think of all the Windows we have mentioned as being a few drops from the ocean of 
the Qur’an, then  you will  be able to compare  how  many  lights of Divine unity  like the 
water  of  life  the  Qur’an  contains.  But  even  if  the  Qur’an,  the  source  and  origin  and 
fountain of all those Windows, is considered in an extremely brief and simple manner, it 
still  forms  a  most  brilliant,  luminous,  comprehensive  Window.  To  see  how  certain  and 
shining and luminous this Window is, we refer you to the Treatise on the Miraculousness 
of  the  Qur’an,  the  Twenty-Fifth  Word,  and  to  the  Eighteenth  Sign  of  the  Nineteenth 
Letter.  And  beseeching  the  Merciful  Throne  of  the  All-Glorious  One,  Who  sent  us  the 
Qur’an, we say: 

Oh our Sustainer! Do not take us to task if we forget or unwittingly do wrong!48 
* Oh our Sustainer! Let not our hearts deviate now after You have guided us!49 * 
Oh our Sustainer! Accept this from us; indeed You are the All-Hearing, the All-
Seeing!50  *  And  turn  unto  us;  for  You  are  the  Oft-Returning,  Most 
Compassionate.51

Note 

God  willing,  this  Thirty-Third  Letter of  Thirty-Three  Windows  will  bring  to  belief 
those without belief, strengthen the belief of those whose belief is weak, make certain the 
belief of those whose  belief  is strong but imitative, give greater breadth to the belief of 
those whose belief is certain, lead to progress in knowledge of God –the basis and means 
of  all  true  perfection–  for  those  whose  belief  has  breadth,  and  open  up  more  brilliant 
vistas for them. You cannot say, therefore, that “One window is enough for me,” because 
if your reason is satisfied, your heart wants its share as well, and so will your spirit want 
its share. Your imagination will also want its share of the light. The other Windows are 
also necessary, therefore, for each contains different benefits. 

In  the  Treatise  on  the  Ascension  of  the  Prophet  Muhammad  (PBUH),  it  was 
primarily the believer who was addressed, while the atheist was in the position of listener. 
But in this treatise, it is the denier who is addressed, while it is the believer who is in the 
position of listener. This should be taken into consideration when looking at it. 

Unfortunately, due to an important reason, this letter was written with extreme speed. 
It has also remained in the state of the first draft. There will certainly therefore be some 
irregularities and defects in the way it is expressed, which are due to me. I request of my 
brothers then that they look at it with tolerance, and correct it if they are able, and pray 
for my forgiveness. 

Peace  be  on  those  who  follow  Guidance,  and  may  those  who  follow  their  own 
desires be censured.  

Glory be unto You! We have no knowledge save that which You have taught us; 
indeed You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.52 

O God, grant blessings and peace to the one  whom You sent as a Mercy to All 
the Worlds, and to his Family and Companions, and grant them peace. Amen.

Gleams 

From between the Crescents of Ramadan and the Festival 

Flowers from the Seeds of Reality 
A short ‘Mathnawi’ and collection on the subject of belief 
for the Risale-i Nur students 

Bediuzzaman

725 

N O T E 

The reason this work entitled Lemeat (Gleams) is not about only one or two subjects 
like  other  collections  (diwan),  is  that  it  was  written  in  order  to  expound  to  a  degree 
Bediuzzaman  Said  Nursi’s  previous  work,  Hakikat  Çekirdekleri  (Seeds  of  Reality),  and 
in prose form; and it does not indulge in fancies and imaginings like other collections of 
poetry or in unbalanced emotion. It was written as scholarly  instruction  for some of  his 
students, including his nephew who was assisting him, about the truths of the Qur’an and 
belief entirely in accordance with logic; it was a lesson about the Qur’an and belief. As 
Ustad himself said, and we understood the same thing, he had no propensity for verse and 
poetry, and did not occupy himself with them, portraying the meaning of And We did not 
teach him poetry.1 

Working  every  day  for  two  or  two  and  a  half  hours,  this  work  was  written  in 
versified form in twenty days during Ramadan while Bediuzzaman was a member of the 
Darü’l-Hikmet and had numerous preoccupations. Although to write one page of verse is 
as difficult as writing ten of prose, and it was written in this short period of time, it was 
dictated  ‘extempore’,  without  study,  and  was  published  without  being  changed  or 
corrected. In our opinion it is a marvel on account of the Risale-i Nur. There has been no 
other versified collection of poetry that can be read in straighforward manner, as though 
it  was  prose,  like  this  one.2  God  willing,  this  work  will  at  some  time  be  a  sort  of 
Mathnawi  for  the  Risale-i  Nur  students.  It  is  also  a  sort  of  index  of  the  Risale-i  Nur, 
which appeared ten  years subsequently and was completed  in twenty-three  years; a sort 
of forerunner of the Risale-i Nur, giving the good tidings of its major parts.

2 NOTE ON THE TRANSLATION: While attempting to convey the meaning as faithfully as 
possible, the present translation has not attempted to reflect the versified aspects of the original. It is hoped 
that since, as was stated above, the work was written primarily to convey the author’s ideas, the readers will 
benefit, despite the loss of many of the subtleties. [Tr.]

W A R N I N G 

In  accordance  with  the  rule  ‘A  man  is  hostile  to  what  he  does  not  know,’  I  have 
attached no importance to the rules of versification and rhyme, since I do not know them. 
I at no time wanted to transform reality to comply with the demands of versification, as 
though sacrificing lucidity to rhyme. I have clothed the most exalted truths in a rumpled 
dress in this unversified, unrhymed piece. Firstly, I did not know any better and was only 
thinking of the meaning. Secondly, I wanted to demonstrate my criticism of those poets 
who chip away and file the body to suit the clothes. Thirdly, a childish style such as this 
was preferred in order to busy the instinctual soul as well as the heart during Ramadan. 
But,  my  reader,  I  confess  I  made  a  mistake.  Beware,  do  not  do  likewise!  Don’t  be 
distracted by the torn style and so be disrespectful towards its exalted truths! 

S T A T E M E N T   O F   I N T E N T I O N 

O Reader! I confess in advance that I have many complaints about my abilities in the 
art of writing and versification. Even now I cannot write my name properly. Nor have I 
made versification and metre a chapter of my life. But suddenly my mind was beset by a 
persistent  desire  for  verse.  There  is  an  epic  about  the  expeditions  of  the  Companions 
called Qawl-i Nawala Sisaban. Its natural verse, like a hymn, was pleasing to my spirit. 
So I chose its form of verse, but in a way particular to myself. I wrote some poetry which 
resembled verse, but I took absolutely no pains with the metre. Anyone who wishes may 
read it easily as prose without thinking of the versification. Also it should be thought of 
as prose so that the meaning may be understood. In every section there is a pointer to the 
meaning. It should not depend on rhyme. A hat may be without a tassel, and metre may 
be  without  rhyme,  and  verse  without  rules.  I  think  that  if  the  words  and  versification 
attract the attention to themselves through their art, they busy the mind with themselves. 
It is better to be at odds and ends in order not to distract attention from the meaning. 

My  master  in  this  work  was  the  Qur’an;  my  book  was  life;  the  one  I  addressed, 

myself. And you, my reader, are my listener. The listener has no  

 

727 

right to criticize; he takes what pleases him, and ignores what he does not like. This work 
of mine proceeded from the effulgence of blessed Ramadan,3 so it is my hope that it will 
have  an  effect  on  the  hearts  of  my  brothers  in  religion,  and  their  tongues  will  utter  a 
prayer of forgiveness for me, or recite a Fatiha, God willing. 

The Supplicant 

My demolished grave in which are piled up4 
Seventy-nine dead Said’s5 with his sins and sorrows. 
The eightieth is a gravestone to a grave; 
Altogether they weep at Islam’s decline.6 
Together with my gravestone and moaning grave of dead Said’s 
I go forward to the field of tomorrow’s future. 
I am certain that the skies of the future and Asia 
Will together surrender to Islam’s clean, shining hand. 
For it promises the prosperity of belief; 
It affords peace and security to mankind. 

                                                

3 In fact, the date it was written is signified by the line, “Najm adabin wulida li-hilalay Ramadan;” 
that is, “A literary star born of the two crescents of Ramadan.” It makes 1337. [1337 according to the Rumi 
calendar. According to the Hijri calendar, it was 1339. 1st Ramadan, 1339 fell on 8th May, 1921. –Tr.] 

4 This line is his signature. 
5 Since the body is renewed twice every year, it means that [each year] two Said’s have died. Also, 
this year Said is in his seventy-ninth year. It means one Said has died every year, so that he will live to this 
date. [Bediuzzaman died in 1379 according to the Hijri calendar, and his grave was demolished and moved 
in 1380. –Tr.]

Two Sublime Proofs of the Affirmation of Divine Unity 

In its entirety the universe is a supreme proof; it declares God’s glory and unity with 
both its manifest and its unseen tongues. Yes, it recites the unity of the Most Merciful in 
resounding voice, saying: 

THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE! 
All  its  particles  and  cells,  all  its  parts  and  members,  are  tongues  mentioning  God. 

Together they declare in that resounding voice: 

THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE! 
The  tongues  are  various,  the  voices  of  differing  pitch,  but  they  are  united  on  one 

point: the mentioning of Him, saying: 

THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE! 
It is the macroanthropos; it mentions God in high-sounding voice, while all its parts 

and particles join their tiny voices to its mighty voice. In unison they declare:  

THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE! 
The  world  recites  the  Qur’an’s  verses  within  its  circle  for  God’s  remembrance,  the 

Qur’anic dawn spills forth its light. All beings with spirits express this idea: 

THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE! 
The Glorious Criterion of Truth and Falsehood, articulate proof of Divine unity, all 
of  whose  verses  are  truthful  tongues,  all  its  rays  are  flashes  of  belief.  All  together they 
declare: 

THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE!  

 

729 

If you lay your ear on the breast of that Criterion, in its profoundest depths you will 

hear clearly a heavenly voice which recites: 

THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE!  
Its  voice  is  utterly  exalted,  utterly  serious,  truly  sincere,  most  familiar;  it  is  utterly 

convincing, decked out with proofs. Repeatedly it declares: 

THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE! 
All six aspects are transparent in this enlightened proof: upon it is the shining stamp 

of miraculousness; in this shines the light of guidance, which says: 

THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE! 
Yes, beneath  it  is  interwoven  logic and elegant proof; on  its right  is  its questioning 

the intelligence; the mind affirms it on its every side, saying: 

THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE! 
On its left is its calling on the conscience to testify; before it is pure good; its aim is 

happiness and prosperity. Its key is every instant: 

THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE! 
Its  support  beyond  it  is  heavenly:  unadulterated  Divine  revelation.  All  these  six 

aspects are luminous, manifested in its constellations, 

THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE! 
Can  any  thieving  suspicion,  any  stealthy  doubt,  any  renegade  delusion  steal  in  on 
that  resplendent  castle  with  its  walls  of  lofty  Suras,  every  word  of  which  is  an  angel 
uttering: 

THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE!? 
The Qur’an of  Mighty Stature  is an ocean affirming Divine unity. To take a single 
drop  as  an  example,  a  single  Sura:  Sura  al-Ikhlas.7  Only  a  single,  slight  allusion  out of 
innumerable  allusions:  its  six  phrases,  three  negative,  three  positive,  refute  all  kinds  of 
ascription of partners to God, and prove seven aspects of the affirmation of Divine unity: 
The First  Phrase: Say, He is  is unassociated. That is,  it  is defined as absolute. But 

within that definition is a specification: 
THERE IS NO ‘HE’ BUT HE 
This  is  an  allusion  to  the  experiential  (shuhud)  affirmation  of  Divine  unity.  If  the 

reality-perceiving gaze becomes immersed in the affirmation of Divine unity, it says: 

THERE IS NOTHING OBSERVED SAVE HE! 
The  Second  Phrase:  God,  The  One  is  an  explicit  affirmation  of  the  unity  of  the 

Godhead. Reality declares in the tongue of truth:  

                                                

7 Sura 112. 

 

730 

THERE IS NOTHING FIT TO BE WORSHIPPED SAVE HE! 
The Third Phrase: God, the Eternally Besought One. This is the shell of two pearls 
of  the  affirmation  of  Divine  unity.  The  first  is  the  affirmation  of  the  unity  of  Divine 
dominicality. Yes, it declares with the tongue of the order of the universe: 

THERE IS NO CREATOR SAVE HE! 
The second pearl is the affirmation of the unity of Divine Self-Subsistence. Yes, the 
universe  in  its entirety declares through the tongue of need  for an effectual  power, both 
for its coming into being and its continued existence: 
THERE IS NO SELF-SUBSISTENT SAVE HE! 
The  Fourth  Phrase:  He  begets  not.  This  conceals  the  affirmation  of  the  unity  of 
Divine  Glory, rejecting every  sort of ascription of partners to God. It  decisively refutes 
disbelief.  That  is,  one  who  is  subject  to  change  or  division,  or  who  reproduces,  can  be 
neither God, nor Creator, nor Self-Subsistent.  

The negation, lam (not), refutes the idea of offspring, or the blasphemy of paternity, 

and rejects them. 

The  greater  part of  man’s  misguidance  has  arisen  from  this  association  of  partners 
with  God  at  various  times,  in  the  form  of  ‘the  ten  intellects,’  or  the  angels,  or  Jesus 
(PUH) or Uzayr being Divine offspring. 

The  Fifth  Phrase:  And  neither  is  He  begotten  indicates  the  affirmation  of  Divine 
pre-eternity and unity. Thus: one whose existence is not necessary or pre-eternal cannot 
be  God.  That  is,  one  created  in  time,  or  born  of  physical  matter,  or  descended  from  a 
progenitor, cannot be the universe’s protector. 

Causality, the worship of stars, idolatry, and Naturalism: these are all varieties of the 

association of partners with God, all stages of misguidance. 

The Sixth: And there is none like unto Him. This is a comprehensive affirmation of 
Divine unity. That is, the negating lam infers that He has no like, partner, or peer either in 
His essence, or in His attributes, or in His actions.  

In meaning, each of these six phrases is the result of the others, and the proof of the 

others; proofs in sequence, set in order in the fortress of this Sura. 

That is to say, included in Sura al-Ikhlas appropriately to its stature are thirty suras in 

sequence and order, a source of their effulgent dawn. 

None knows the Unseen save God

not contain them;

Nothing Can Exist Without Everything Else

needs.

The Sun’s Motion Is For Gravity, 
And Gravity Makes Stable the Solar System 

The sun is a fruit-bearing tree; it shakes itself so that the planets fall not, its fruits.  
If it rested in silence, the attraction would cease; and they would weep through space, its 

ecstatics. 

Small Things Are Tied To Big Things 

Certainly, the one who created the mosquito created both the sun and the Milky Way; 
And the one who ordered the flea’s stomach clearly set in order the solar system; 
While the one who gave sight to the eye and need to the stomach, definitely painted the 

sky’s eye with light and spread a table of foods over the face of the earth. 

There is a  Miraculousness in the Order of the Universe 

See, there is a miraculousness in the writing of the universe; if to suppose the impossible 

all natural causes were effective agents possessing will, 

In utter impotence they would prostrate before its miraculousness, conforming to it and 

declaring: 

“Glory be to You! We have no power! It is You Who is the All-Glorious Pre-Eternal 

Possessor of Power, O our Sustainer!” 

Everything is Equal Before Divine Power 
Your creation and your resurrection are but as a single soul.9 

Divine power is essential, inherent; impotence cannot impinge on it. 
There can be no degrees in it, obstacles cannot intervene in it. For power, there is no 

difference between universal and particular; 

For everything is tied to everything else; one who cannot make everything can make 

nothing.

One Cannot Create a Particle

And to place them on the head and chest of endless space – no one’s hand has the

strength for this. 

There is nothing in the world that can claim to create anything. 

Raising a Species to Life Is The Same as Raising to Life an Individual 

Just as raising to life a fly drowsy with death-tainted sleep presents no difficulty to 

Divine power, 

So will neither the death of the earth nor its resurrection present any difficulty.  
Nor will raising to life all beings with spirits present much problem. 

Nature Is Divine Art 

Nature is not the printer, it is the press;  
It is not the inscriber, but the inscription; it is not the doer, it is the recipient; It is not the 

source, but the pattern. It is not the orderer, it is the order; 

It is not the power, but the law; it is a code of laws proceeding from the attribute of will; 

it has no external reality. 

The Conscience Recognizes God Through Attraction 

In the conscience is an attraction, a being drawn; it is permanently drawn through the 

attraction of an attractive force. 

If the All-Beauteous One were to appear, if He were to be manifested permanently in 
refulgent fashion without veil, conscious beings would be overcome by ecstasy. 
Man’s conscious nature testifies decisively to a Necessarily Existent, One of Glory and 

Beauty; 

It testifies through the ecstasy, and the attraction. 

 

734 

Innate Disposition Speaks the Truth 

The innate disposition of things does not lie, whatever it says is the truth. The inclination 
to grow, the tongue of the seed, says: “I shall sprout and produce fruit..”, and what it 
says is proved true. 

The desire for life murmurs in the depths of the egg: “With Divine permission I shall be a 

chick.” What it says is true.

Prophethood Is Essential For Mankind 

Divine power does not leave the ant without leader, or bees without a queen; 
It surely would not leave mankind without prophet or code of laws. In any case, the order 

of the world demands this. 

The Ascension Was for the Angels 
What the Splitting of the Moon Was for Mankind 

In truth, as a wonder, the angels saw an Ascension, a supreme sainthood within 

incontestable prophethood.

cause. 

Life is a Manifestation of Unity 

Life is a light of unity; it manifests unity in this realm of multiplicity. Yes, it manifests 

unity, unifying multiplicity and making it one. 

Life appropriates all things to everything. While for a lifeless thing all things are non-

existent. 

Spirit is a Law Clothed in External Existence 

Spirit is a luminous law clothed in external existence, endowed with consciousness. 
Existent spirit is the brother, the companion, of intelligent law. 
Like fixed and constant natural laws, spirit comes from the world of the Divine command 

and attribute of will. 

Power clothes it in a being decked out with senses, attaches consciousness to its head, 

makes a subtle inner faculty the shell for that pearl. 

If the Creator’s power were to clothe the laws of species in external existence, each 

would become a spirit; 

If it were to remove the spirit from the being and take the intelligence from its head, it 

would again become an undying law. 

Existence Without Life Resembles Non-Existence 

Both light and life disclose beings. See, if there is no light of life, 
Existence is stained with non-existence; indeed, it is non-existence. Yes, a stranger, an 

orphan; if it is the moon, it is without life...

Thanks to Life, the Ant Is Greater than the Earth 

If you were to weigh the ant on the scales of existence, the universe emerging from it 

could not be contained in our globe. 

In my view, the globe is living. But if according to what others suppose, you were to take 

the dead globe and place it in the opposite pan to the ant,  

It would not weigh even half its conscious head.

In this lies a mighty mystery to which the Glory of the Messengers alluded when he said:

The Impossible May Appear Possible When Seen Indirectly 

It is well-known, a large group of people looked for the crescent moon of the ‘Id, but no 

one could see anything. 

Then an old man swore he had seen it. But what he had seen was a curved white eyelash. 
The eyelash had been his moon. But can one compare a curved eyelash and the crescent 

moon? If you have understood our parable: 

The motion of particles has become the eyelash over the reason; each particle, a dark 

eyelash blinding the materialist eye. 

It cannot see the One Who fashioned all these beings, so has been engulfed in 

misguidance. 

But can there be any comparison between that motion and the universe’s Orderer? It is a 

compounded impossibility that the former be the latter! 

                                                

12 This alludes to the situation which resulted from the Great War. Indeed, it is an accurate prediction 

foretelling the Second World War.

The Qur’an Requires Mirrors, Not Someone to Act on Its Behalf 

Rather than proofs it is the sacredness of the source that drives the mass of the Umma and 

the ordinary people to conform to it and encourages them to obey it. 

Ninety per cent of the Shari’a consists of the incontestable matters and essentials of 

religion, each of which is a diamond pillar. 

Only ten per cent are matters open to interpretation, controversial, and secondary. Ninety 
diamond pillars may not be put in the purse of someone with ten gold pieces, nor be 
made to follow him.  

The source of the diamond pillars is the Qur’an and Hadith. They are their property and 

should always be sought from them. 

Books and interpretations of the Shari’a should be mirrors of the Qur’an, or telescopes. 

That Sun of Miraculous Exposition is not in need of shadows or anyone to act on its 
behalf! 

The Falsifier of the Truth Looks On the False as True 

Since by nature man is noble, he intentionally seeks the truth. 
Sometimes he encounters falsehood, and supposing it to be the truth, stores it away in his 

heart... 

Then when digging out the truth he involuntarily falls into misguidance; supposing it to 

be the truth, he commits it to his head. 

The Mirrors of Divine Power Are Numerous 

The power of the All-Glorious One has numerous mirrors. They open up windows each 

more transparent and subtle than the other, onto the World of Similitudes. 

Various mirrors from water to air, air to ether, ether to similitudes, similitudes to spirits, 

spirits to time, time to imagination, and from imagination to thought, all represent the 
manifesting attributes. Turn your ear to the mirror of the air: a single word becomes 
millions! 

The Pen of Power writes it out in extraordinary fashion, this mystery of reproduction... 

 

738 

Representation Is of Various Sorts 

The image in a mirror may be of four sorts: either the identity alone; or the identity 

together with its particularities; or both the identity and the rays of the thing’s nature; 
or both its true nature and its identity. 

The images in the mirrors of luminous spirits are living and connected; expansive lights 

which even if not the same as the spirits, are not other than them. 

If the sun had been living and its heat light, and its colours consciousness, it would have 

possessed the above qualities of the image in the mirror. 

The key to this mystery is this: Gabriel is both at “the Lote-tree,” and in the form of 

Dihya, and in the Prophet’s company, and who knows in how many other places!  
While God knows how many places Azra’il is present simultaneously, seizing the spirits 

At the same time, the Prophet appears to his community both in the visions of the saints, 

And at the resurrection of the dead he will meet with all through his intercession.  
The ‘substitutes’ (abdal) of saints appear and are seen in numerous places at the same 

of the dying.  

and in true dreams,  

time. 

All Those Qualified May Interpret the Law, 
But They May Not Be Lawgivers 

Everyone capable who is qualified to practise ijtihad, may interpret matters for himself 
which are not incontestable; and they are binding on himself, but not on others. 
He cannot make laws and call on the Umma to conform to them. His ideas are from the 
Shari’a, but they are not the Shari’a. He may be a mujtahid, but he cannot be the 
Lawmaker. 

The Shari’a is ratified through the consensus of the majority of scholars. The first 

condition for calling on others to accept an idea is the surmised acceptance of the 
majority.14 

Such a call is otherwise innovation; it gets stuck in the gullet, never again to emerge! 

                                                

14 Zann-ı kabul-u cumhur: “The surmised acceptance of the majority of mujtahids and learned 

authorities of the correctness of a judgement, that is, the strong possibility of their accepting it.” [See, 
Abdullah Yeğin, Yeni Lugat (Istanbul: 1975), 782]. [Tr.] 

 

739 

The Light of Reason Comes From the Heart 

Unenlightened illuminati should know that ideas cannot be enlightened without the light 

of the heart. 

So long as the light of the mind and of the heart are not combined, there is darkness, 

producing oppression and ignorance. Darkness garbed in sham light. 

If the white of the eye, which resembles daytime, is not combined with the black pupil, 

which resembles night, it is not an eye, it will see nothing. Unseeing sight is also 
worth nothing. 

So, if the black depths of the heart are not present in the white of thought, the 

miscellaneous information in the mind will produce no knowledge or insight. There 
can be no reason without the heart. 

Undigested Knowledge Should Not Be Imparted To Others 

The truly learned guide is a sheep, not a bird; he gives his knowledge altruistically. 
For the sheep gives its lamb digested, pure milk; 
Whereas the bird gives its chick regurgitated vomit. 

Destruction Is Easy; The Weak Person Is Destructive 

The condition of the existence of the whole is the existence of all the parts; while its non-
existence may be through the non-existence of one of its parts; so destruction is easy. 

It is because of this that the impotent man never approaches anything positively and 

constructively; he always acts negatively, and is always destructive. 

Force Should Always Serve Right 

If the principles of wisdom, codes of government, laws of right, and rules of force do not 

aid and support one another,  

They will be neither fruitful nor effective among the mass of the people. The marks of the 

Shari’a will be neglected and remain in abeyance.  

The people will not rely on them in their affairs, nor have confidence in them. 

 

740 

Sometimes Opposites Comprise Their Opposites 

Sometimes opposites conceal their opposites. In the language of politics, the word 

becomes the opposite of its meaning.  

Tyranny has donned the cap of justice.15 Treachery has found a cheap dress in patriotism. 
Jihad and war in God’s way have been called revolt. Enslavement to the animal 
passions, the despotism of Satan, have been called freedom.  

Things have become their opposites, forms have been transposed, names have been 

swapped, places have been exchanged. 

Politics Based On Self-Interest Is Savagery 

The politics of the present, which is founded on self-interest, is a rapacious beast. 
If you feign affection for a ravenous beast, you will not attract its compassion but will 

whet its appetite. 

Then it will turn on you, and both its claws and fangs will want their rent from you. 

No Limit Has Been Placed On Man’s Powers, So His Crimes Are Great 

Unlike the animals, there is no natural limit on man’s powers; the good and evil that 

proceed from them are infinite. 

If the selfishness of this power and the egotism of that one are combined with pride and 

obstinacy, man commits such sins16 that up to the present mankind 

Has found no name for them. Just as they indicate Hell’s necessity, so their penalty can 

only be Hell.

And, for example, in order to justify just one of his lies, a man sincerely desires the 

The present has shown that neither is Hell unnecessary, nor is Paradise won easily. 

                                                

15 This speaks of the present as though seeing it. 
16 This is a prediction about the future. 

 

741 

Sometimes Good Leads To Evil 

While in reality the qualities of the upper classes should be the cause of humility and self-

effacement, regretably they have led to arrogance and oppression.  

And while the helplessness of the poor and poverty of the common people should have 
led to the upper classes being gracious and compassionate, unfortunately it has 
resulted in the common people’s abasement and servitude.  

If honour and good result from something, it is offered to the leaders and upper classes. 

But any evils and bad results are divided among the common people and ordinary 
soldiers.  

The honour won by a victorious tribe is expressed as adulation for “Hasan Agha,” but any 

evils are poured on his soldiers as vituperation. A sorry evil among mankind! 

The Absence of an Objective Strengthens Egotism 

If people have no aim in mind, or they are overcome by forgetfulness or they feign 
forgetfulness, their minds turn in on themselves and revolve around them. 

The ego strengthens, sometimes growing angry; it is not deflated, that it might become 

“we.” Those who love themselves, love no one else. 

The Life of  Revolution Sprang From the Death of Zakat 
and the Life of Usury 

The origin of all revolutions, all anarchy and corruption; the inciter and source of evils, 

depravity and abomination, are two phrases, or one or two words:  

The first is this: “I’m full, so what is it to me if others die of hunger?” And the second: 

“You suffer so I can be comfortable. You work so that I can eat. The food’s for me, 
labouring’s for you.” 

There is one single cure for the fatal poison of the first phrase, that will cut it at the root 

That is the Zakat of the Shari’a, a pillar of Islam. In the second phrase is a tree of 
Zaqqum; what will extirpate it is the prohibition on usury and interest.  

If mankind wants what’s best and it loves life, it must impose Zakat and abolish usury 

and heal it: 

and interest. 

 

742 

If Mankind Wants Life, It Must Put to Death Usury of Every Sort 

Relations between the upper and lower classes have been severed. From below arise cries 

of revolution, shouts of revenge, screams of hatred and envy.  

From above descend fires of tyranny and scorn, the burden of arrogance, the inciter of 

oppression.  

What should arise from below are love, obedience, respect, and conformity. And from 

above should descend compassion and bounty, kindness and education.  
If mankind wants these, it should embrace Zakat and drive out usury and interest. 
Qur’anic justice stands at the door of the world telling usury and interest: “No entry! You 

have no right to enter! Return whence you came!” 

Mankind did not heed this command, and received a blow;17 it should heed it now before 

receiving one more severe. 

Mankind Smashed Slavery, So Will It Smash Wage-Earning 

In a dream I said: the skirmishing between nations and states is making way for fierce 

battle between the social classes. 

For in the era of slavery, man did not want slavery and smashed it, spilling his blood. 
Now he has become a wage-earner; he bears that burden and will smash it too. 
Mankind has grown old, having passed through five stages: primitive nomadism, slavery, 

captivity;18 now the wage-earning age has begun and is passing. 

An Unlawful Way Leads to the Opposite of What Was Intended 
The murderer may not inherit19 is an important principle: “Someone who pursues his goal 
by unlawful paths, generally pays the penalty of achieving the opposite of what he 
intended.” 

                                                

Second World War. 

17 This is a powerful prediction. Mankind did not listen, and received an awesome blow with this 

18 See, Nursi, Mektubat (Ottoman ed.) (Istanbul n.p., n.d.), 455. Here, Bediuzzaman, ascribing it to 

“the materialist view of history,” lists five main stages that mankind has passed through: i) primitive 
nomadism; ii) slavery; iii) captivity; iv) wage-earning; v) ownership and free enterprise. Concerning the 
third stage, he writes: “... (men) were saved from slavery, but in accordance with the tyrannical principle 
‘Might is right,’ the powerful treated the weak as captives. Then as a result of numerous revolutions such as 
the French Revolution, that stage was transformed into the wage-earning stage...” [Tr.]

Love of Europe was illicit, as well as blind imitation and familiarity. Its consequences 

and recompense were the tyrannical animosity of the beloved, and crimes. 

The loser and sinner will find neither pleasure nor salvation. 

A Grain of Truth Is To Be Found in the Jabriyya and Mu’tazila 

O seeker after truth! The Shari’a differentiates between the past and disasters, and the 

Divine Determining20 is looked to in connection with the past and calamities, and the 

future and sins.  

word is the Jabriyya’s.  

Man’s accountability is considered concerning the future and sins; then the word is the 

Mu’tazila’s. The Mu’tazila and Jabriyya are reconciled here. 

Both these false schools contain a grain of truth; it has a particular place; it is false when 

made general. 

Impotence and Anxiety Are For the Inadequate 

If you want life, don’t cling onto impotence in things for which there are solutions; 
If you want ease of mind, don’t become needlessly anxious about things for which there 

is no solution. 

Sometimes Little Things Do Big Works 

Under some conditions a small point21 raises its owner to the highest of the high... 
Then there are circumstances when a slight movement sends down the doer to the lowest 

of the low... 

For Some People A Moment Is A Year 

Some people’s innate capacities blossom in a instant, while others are gradual, unfolding 

little by little. Human nature contains both of these. 

They look to conditions, and change accordingly. Sometimes they develop slowly. 

Sometimes they are dark like gunpowder, then suddenly explode into luminous fire.

Compare the two: a seed, a tree. It instantaneously produced fruit, that look of

Of a sudden he changed the coal-like natures of the Arabian people into diamonds, with 

their morals as black as gunpowder, they all became luminous lights. 

Falsehoods Are Blasphemies 

One grain of truth wipes out a million lies. O grain of reality razes a castle of dreams. 

Honesty is a grand principle, a lustrous jewel. 

If for the truth to be uttered it is damaging, it resigns its place to silence; lies have no 

Everything you say should be true, all your pronouncements right, but you have no right 

place, even if they have some use.  

to say all that is true.  

One should be well aware of this, and take as one’s principle: ‘Take what is clear and 

untroubled, leave what is turbid and distressing.’ 

See the good side of things; you will have good thoughts. Know things to be good and 

think of them as good; you will find the pleasure in life. 

In life, hope and thinking favourably of things are life itself. While to think the worst is 

despair, the destroyer of happiness and slayer of life. 

A Dream Assembly 

Comparisons between the Shari’a and modern civilization, 
and the genius of modern science and guidance of the Shari’a 

In a true dream on a Friday night at the beginning of the Armistice Period following the 

First War, I was asked by a vast assembly in a World of Similitudes: 

“What will the Islamic world’s situation be following its defeat?” I replied as the deputy 

for the present age, and they listened to me: 

This State, which  through undertaking from early times the religious obligation of jihad 
to maintain Islam’s independence and uphold the Word of God, considered itself 
bound to sacrifice itself for the undivided unity of the Islamic world and saw itself as 
the standard-bearer of the Caliphate –  

 

745 

this State’s, this Muslim nation’s, past calamity will certainly bring about Islam’s 
prosperity and freedom.  

The disaster of the past will be made up for in the future. One who loses three and gains 
three hundred makes no loss. The zealous will transform its past into the future. 

For wondrously this calamity has made unfold compassion, Islamic solidarity and 

brotherhood, the leaven of our lives, and has expedited the shaking, the destruction, 
of civilization.  

Present-day low civilization will change form, its system will fall apart, then Islamic 

civilization will emerge.  

Muslims will certainly be the first to enter it voluntarily. If you want a comparison, look 
closely at the principles of the civilization of the Shari’a and those of present-day 
civilization, and consider their results: 

The principles of present-day civilization are negative. Its foundations and values are five 

negative principles. Its machinery is based on these.  

Its point of support is force instead of right, and the mark of force is aggression and 

Its goal is mean self-interest instead of virtue, and the mark of self-interest is rivalry and 

hostility, and their result is treachery. 

dispute, and their result, crime. 

Its law of life is conflict instead of co-operation, and the mark of conflict is this: 

contention and mutual repulsion, and their result, poverty. 

Its principle for relations between peoples is racialism, which flourishes through harming 

others and is nourished through devouring others. 

The mark of negative nationalism and racialism is ghastly clashes, disastrous collisions, 

and their result, annihilation. 

The fifth is this: its alluring service is to excite lust and the appetites of the soul and 

facilitate the gratification of whims, and their result is vice. 

The mark of lust and passion is always this: they transform man into a beast, changing his 

character; they deform him, perverting his humanity. 

If most of these civilized people were turned inside out, you would see their characters in 

the form of apes and foxes, snakes, bears, and swine. 

They appear to the imagination in their pelts and skins! Examples of its products are 

these. The Shari’a, however, is the balance and equilibrium of the earth. 

The mercy in the Shari’a comes from the skies of the Qur’an. The principles of Qur’anic 
civilization are positive. Its wheel of happiness turns on five positive principles: 
Its point of support is truth instead of force, and the constant mark of truth is justice and 

balance. Security and well-being result from these, and villainy disappears. 

Its aim is virtue instead of self-interest, and the mark of virtue is love and mutual 

attraction. Happiness results from these, and enmity disappears. 

 

746 

Its principle in life is co-operation instead of conflict and killing, and its mark is unity 

and solidarity, and the community is strengthened. 

Its service takes the form of guidance and direction instead of lust and passion. And the 

mark of guidance is progress and prosperity in way befitting humanity; 

The spirit is illumined and perfected in the way it requires. The way it unifies the masses 

repulses racialism and negative nationalism; 

It establishes in place of them the bonds of religion, patriotic relations, ties of class, and 

the brotherhood of belief.  

The mark of these bonds are sincere brotherhood, general well-being; defence in the case 
of external aggression. You have understood now the reason Islam was affronted, 
and did not embrace civilization. 

Up to the present, Muslims have not entered this present civilization voluntarily, it has 

not suited them, moreover it has clamped on them fetters of bondage. 

While it should be the cure for mankind, it has become poison. It has cast eighty per cent 

into penury and misery, and produced a false happiness for ten per cent. 

The remaining ten per cent it has left uneasily between the two. Commercial profits have 

been the tyrannical minority’s. But true happiness is happiness for all; 

Or at least salvation for the majority. The Qur’an, revealed as a mercy for mankind, only 

accepts civilization of this kind, 

Happiness for all, or at least for the majority. In its present form the passions are 

unrestricted, caprice too is free; it is an animal freedom. 

The passions dominate, caprice too is despotic; they have made unessential needs 

essential, and banished comfort and ease. 

In primitive life, a man was in need of four things, civilization has put him in need of a 

hundred, and impoverished him.  

Lawful labours are insufficient to meet the cost. This has driven mankind to trickery and 

the unlawful. It is on this point that it corrupted morality.  

It bestowed wealth and glitter on society and mankind, but made the individual immoral 

and indigent. There are numerous witnesses to this.  

This malignant civilization vomited all at once the combined savagery and crimes, all the 

cruelty and treachery, of former centuries, and its stomach is still queasy.22 

The Islamic world’s holding back from it is both meaningful and noteworthy. It has been 

loath to accept it, and has acted coldly.  

Yes, the distinguishing quality of the Divine light of the Illustrious Shari’a is 

independence and self-sufficiency. 

                                                

22 This means it will vomit in even more violent fashion. Yes, it vomited so terribly in the two World 

Wars that it filthied the faces of the land, sea, and air, staining them with its blood. 

 

747 

It will not give up that quality, that light of guidance, so that the genius of Rome, the 

spirit of civilization, should dominate it.  

The guidance of the former cannot combine with the philosophy of the latter, nor be 

grafted onto it, nor follow it.  

The Shari’a has nourished the compassion and dignity of belief in the spirit of Islam. The 
Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition has taken the truths of the Shari’a in its shining 
hand;  

Each is a Staff of Moses in that shining hand. In the future that sorcerer civilization will 

Now, note this: Ancient Rome and Greece were two geniuses; twins from a single stock. 

prostrate in wonderment before it. 

One fanciful, the other materialist. 

Like oil and water, they never combined. It needed time, civilization worked at it too, and 

so did Christianity, but none was successful at combining them. 

Both preserved their independence. And now it is as though those two spirits have 

changed their bodies; one has become German, the other, French. 

They experienced a sort of metempsychosis. O my dream-brother! This is what time has 
shown. Like two genius oxen those twins rejected any moves to combine them; 

They still are not reconciled. Since they are twins, they are brothers and friends, 

companions in progress; but they fought and never made peace. 

How could it be that with its different source, origin, and place of appearance, the light of 
the Qur’an and guidance of the Shari’a should be reconciled with the genius of 
Rome, the spirit of modern civilization, and should join and combine with it? 
Their origins are different: guidance descended from the heavens, genius emerged from 

the earth. Guidance works in the heart, and works the mind. 

Genius works in the mind and confuses the heart. Guidance illumines the spirit, making it 

seeds sprout and flourish; dark Nature is illumined by it. 

Its potentiality for perfection suddenly advances; it makes the carnal soul a docile 

servant; it gives aspiring man an angelic countenance. 

As for genius, it looks primarily to the soul and physical being, it plunges into Nature, 
making the soul an arable field; the animal potentialities develop and flourish; 
It subjugates the spirit, dessicating its seeds; it shows up satanic features in mankind. But 
guidance gives happiness to life, it spreads light in this life and the next; it exalts 
mankind. 

Antichrist-like23 genius, blind in one eye, sees only the domain of this life; it is 

materialist and worships this world. It turns men into beasts. 

Yes, deaf genius worships Nature, it empowers blind force. But guidance  

                                                

23 There is a subtle indication in this. 

 

748 

recognizes conscious art and looks to purposeful power. Genius draws a curtain of 
ingratitude over the earth; guidance scatters the light of thanks. 

It is because of this that genius is deaf and blind, while guidance is hearing and seeing. In 

the view of genius, the bounties of the earth are ownerless booty; 

It provokes the desire to seize and steal them thanklessly, to savagely snap them off from 

Nature. 

In the view of guidance, the bounties scattered over the breast of the earth and face of the 
universe are the fruits of mercy; it sees a gracious hand beneath every bounty, and 
has it kissed in gratitude. 

I cannot deny that there are numerous virtues in civilization, but they are neither the 

property of Christianity, nor the invention of Europe. 

Nor are they the product of this century; they are common property, produced by the 

conjunction of minds and ideas, from the laws of the revealed religions, out of innate 
need,  

And particularly from the Islamic revolution brought about by the Shari’a of Muhammad. 

No one can claim ownership of them.  

The leader of the Dream Assembly asked another question: 
“Man of the present century! Calamities are always the result of treachery and the cause 

of reward. Divine Determining dealt a blow and issued its decree. 

“With which of your actions did you issue the fatwa to both Divine Decree and 
Determining so that they decreed this calamity and gave you a beating?” 

I replied: The error of the majority is always the cause of general disasters. Mankind’s 

misguided ideas, Nimrod-like obduracy, Pharaoh-like pride,  

Swelled and swelled on the earth till it reached the skies. It upset too the sensitive 

mystery of creation.  

It caused to descend from the heavens the plague and storm of the last war’s quakes; it 

caused a heavenly blow to be visited on the infidel. That is, the calamity was the 
calamity of all mankind. 

The joint cause, inclusive of all mankind, were the misguided ideas arising from 

Materialism. Bestial freedom, the despotism of the appetites. 

The reason for our share was our neglect and giving up of the pillars of Islam. For the 

Exalted Creator wanted one hour out of the twenty-four. 

He demanded of us, and for us, only one hour for the five daily prayers, and commanded 
this. But out of laziness we gave them up, neglected them due to heedlessness. 
So we received the following punishment: He made us perform prayers of a sort these 

last five years by constant twenty-four hour drill and hardship, being driven on and 
made to strive. 

He also wanted of us one month’s fasting a year, but we pitied ourselves, so in atonement 

He compelled us to fast for five years. 

 

749 

As Zakat, He wanted either a fortieth or a tenth of the property He had given us, but out 

of stinginess we did wrong: we mixed the illicit with our property, and did not give it 
voluntarily. 

So He had our accumulated Zakat taken from us, and saved us from what was unlawful. 

The deed fitted the punishment. The punishment fitted the deed.  

Righteous acts are of two sorts: one positive and voluntary, the other negative and 

enforced. All pains and calamities are good works; but negative and enforced. The 
Hadith offered consolation.24 

This sinful nation took its ablutions with its blood; it repented actively. As an immediate 
reward, four million, a fifth of this nation, were raised to the degree of sainthood. It 
gave them the ranks of martyrdom and ghazis; it obliterated the sin.  

The lofty dream assembly appreciated these words. 
I awoke suddenly; rather, with awakening I went to sleep. I think the waking state is a 

dream and the dream state a sort of wakefulness.  
There was this age’s deputy, and here is Said-i Nursi! 

The Ignorant Suppose Metaphors To Be Fact 

If figures of speech fall from the hand of knowledge to that of ignorance, they are 

transformed into fact, opening the door to superstition. 

When small I saw an eclipse of the moon. I asked my mother, and she said: “A snake has 
swallowed it.” I asked her: “Why is it visible, then?” She said: “The snakes there are 
semi-transparent.” She thought a metaphor was reality. At a Divine command, on the 
earth interposing between “the head” and “the tail”, which are the points of 
intersection of the moon and  circuit of the sun, the moon is eclipsed. The two 
hypothetical arcs were called “Tinnin”, it was named with a fanciful simile. Tinnin 
means the Serpent.25 

Exaggeration Is Implied Disparagement 

Whatever you describe, describe it as it is. In my opinion, exaggerated praise is implied 

disparagement. 

Favour greater than Divine favour is not favour...

Fame Is Tyrannical 

Fame is a despot; it ascribes to its owner the property of others. 
As in the famous Nasreddin Hoja joke, his Zakat, that is, one tenth, is his true property... 
The imaginary renown of Rustam-i Sistani plundered an age of the glories of Iran. 
That famous fancy swelled with plunder and pillage, it was mixed with superstition, and 

threw down mankind. 

Those Who Suppose Religion and Life Can Be Separated 
Are the Cause of Disaster 

The mistake of the Young Turks: they did not know our religion is the basis of life; they 

thought nation and Islam were different. 

They imagined civilization would endure and always be dominant, and saw happiness 

Now time has shown civilization’s system to be corrupt and harmful;26 incontrovertible 

and prosperity to lie within it.  

experience has taught us this. 

Religion is the very life of life, its light and its basis. This nation will be revived only 

through the revival of religion. Islam understood this. 

Contrary to other religions, our nation has progressed to the extent we adhered to our 

religion. And it has declined to the degree we neglected it.  

This is an historical fact which occurred due to our feigned forgetfulness. 

Death Is Not Terrifying As Is Imagined 

Misguidance is misleading, it makes death terrifying. Death is a change of clothes, or a 

change of abode. It removes man from dungeon to garden. 

Whoever wants life should want martyrdom. The Qur’an describes the martyr’s life. 

Martyrs, who do not experience the pangs of death, all know themselves to be alive 
and see themselves thus.  

But they find their new lives to be purer. They do not suppose they have died. Note 

carefully what their relation to the dead is, it is like this:  

In a dream two men are walking in a beautiful garden holding every sort of delight. One 

knows it is only a dream and receives no pleasure. 

It does not delight him; its fills him with regret. The other one thinks it is the waking 

world, and receives true pleasure; it is real to him. 

                                                

26 This is an accurate prediction; it looks to irreligious, tyrannical civilization, in the throes of death 

 

751 

The dream is the shadow of the similitude, and the similitude is the shadow of the 
Intermediate Realm. It is due to this that their principles resemble each other. 

Politics Are a Satan in the World of Ideas; 
One Should Seek Refuge With God From Them 

The politics of civilization sacrifice the minority for the comfort of the majority. Indeed, 

the despotic minority sacrifices the majority of people for themselves. 

Qur’anic justice would not take the life of a single innocent, spill their blood, or sacrifice 

him even for all mankind, let alone the majority. 

The verse, If anyone slew a person –unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in 
the land– it would be as if he slew the whole people27 lays two mighty mysteries 
before the eyes.  

One is pure justice. This sublime principle deems equal the individual and the 

community, the person and mankind; Divine justice sees no difference between 
them; this is a constant Sunna. 

An individual may sacrifice his rights himself, but they cannot be sacrificed otherwise, 

even for all mankind.  

The cancelling of his rights, or the spilling of his blood, or the smearing of his name is 
equal to the cancelling of the rights of all humanity, or the besmirching of it, and is 
its equivalent.  

The second mystery is this: if a selfish man murders an innocent out of greed or passion, 
he will lay waste the whole world if he can, should it be an obstacle to his desires, 
and wipe out all humanity. 

Weakness Emboldens the Enemy; 
God May Try His Servants, but They May Not Try Him 

O fearful, weak one! Your fear and weakness are in vain and cause you harm; they 

embolden outside influences and attract them. 

O you who suffers from doubts and delusions! Definite benefits may not be sacrificed for 

imaginary harms. What you need is action; the result is with God. 

One may not interfere in God’s concerns. He draws His servant to the arena of trial and 

says: “If you do that, I’ll do this.” 

                                                

27 Qur’an, 5:32. 

 

752 

But the servant can never try God. If he says: “God should help, so I’ll do this,” he is 

overstepping his mark. 

Satan said to Jesus: “Since it is He Who does everything; His determining does not 

change. Throw yourself down off the mountain and let’s see what happens to you.” 

Jesus replied: “Confound you! God’s servants cannot put Him to the test!” 

Don’t Overdo It In Things You Like 

The cure for one ailment merely exacerbates another; the antidote becomes poison. If the 

cure is taken to excess, it is the cause of ill, and is fatal. 

The Eye of Obstinacy Supposes an Angel To Be Satan 

Obstinacy is this: if Satan helps someone, he calls him “an angel” and calls down 

blessings on him. 

But if he sees an angel on the opposing side, he supposes it to be Satan in a different 

guise, and calls down curses on the angel. 

After Finding What’s Right, 
Don’t Cause Dispute for the Sake of Something Better 

O seeker after truth! If there is consensus concerning what is right and dispute concerning 
what is better, sometimes what is right is better than what is better. And sometimes 
what is good is better than what is better. 

Islam Is Peace and Reconciliation, 
It Wants No Dispute or Hostility Within 

O World of Islam! Your life lies in unity, and if you want unity, your guiding principle 

It should be “This is true,” rather than “This alone is true.” And “This is the best,” rather 

should be this: 

than “This is the only good way.” 

All Muslims should say about his own school and way: “This is true, I don’t interfere 

with others. If others are good, mine is the best.” 

They should not say: “This is the only true way, the others are all false. Only  

 

753 

mine is good, the others are all wrong and unpleasant.” 

The exclusivist mentality arises from love of self. It later becomes a sickness and leads to 

dispute. 

The multiplication of ills and cures is right, and right too multiplies. The increase in the 

varieties of needs and foods is right, and right becomes various. 

The increase in capacities and education is right, and right too multiplies. A single 

substance is both poison and the antidote. 

The truth is not fixed in secondary matters; it is relative and compound in accordance 

with different temperaments.28  

The temperaments of the authoritative scholars imparted a share to it, and it was realized 
and compounded accordingly; the founders of the schools made judgements in 
absolute, unspecific terms. 

They left it to the various temperaments and their leanings to specify the limits of their 

schools; but bigoted attachment to them was the cause of generalization. 

The partisanship arising from this led to dispute. The profound rifts between the social 

classes before Islam,  

And their extraordinary distance from each other, demanded a great many prophets at any 

one time, and a variety of sacred laws, and numerous schools. 

Islam caused a revolution among mankind, and men drew closer to each other. It reduced 

to one the sacred law, and there was one Prophet. 

But the levels of men were not the same, so the schools of law multiplied. When a single 

training and instruction is sufficient, the schools will unite. 

There is Great Wisdom in the Creation and Combining of Opposites: 
The Sun and a Minute Particle Are Equal in the Hand of Power 

O Brother with an alert heart! Power is manifested in the combining of opposites. Do you 
know why there is pain in pleasure, evil within good, ugliness within beauty, harm 
within benefit, revenge within beneficence, fire within light? 

It is so that the relative truths may be established; that there may be many things within 

one thing, and that they may find existence and become apparent.  

Swift motion makes a point into a line. Its being spun at speed makes a flash of light, a 

luminous circle.

The function of relative truths is that seeds should sprout in this world. They form the 

mud of the universe, the links in its order, the connections betweens its inscriptions.  
In the hereafter these relative matters will be truths. The degrees of heat are caused by the

If there was no Paradise, perhaps Hell would not be torment. It cannot be without

Since Divine power is a necessary inherent quality, and necessarily essential to that Pre-

Eternal One, it can comprise no opposites, impotence cannot intervene in it, there can 
be no degrees in it, nothing can be difficult for it. 

The sun became a niche for the light of His power. The surface of the sea became a 

mirror to the light of the niche, the dewdrops’ eyes all became mirrors. 

The sun the broad surface of the sea reflects is reflected also by the droplets in the creases 

of its frowns; the tiny eye of the dewdrop also shines like a star. 

They hold the same identity: in the view of the sun, the dewdrop and the sea are the same, 

its power makes them equal; the pupil of the dewdrop’s eye is a tiny sun. 

The magnificent sun also is a tiny dewdrop; the pupil of its eye is a light received from 

the Sun of Power; it is the moon to that power. 

The heavens are an ocean; at the breath of the Most Merciful, droplets undulate in the 

creases of its frowns, which are the stars and suns. 

Power was manifested, it scattered coruscating gleams on those droplets. Every sun a 

droplet, every star a dewdrop, each the likeness of a flash. 

The drop-like sun is a tiny reflection of that manifestation’s effulgence. It makes its 

burnished soul pearl-like to that glass gleam. The dewdrop stars shine 

In its delicate eye, it gives a place to the flash, the flash becomes a lamp, its eye becomes 

glass, its lamp is lit up.

If You Have Any Qualities, They Should Remain in the 
Dust of Concealment,  So They May Flourish 

O man of famous quality! Don’t be oppressive by displaying your qualities; if they 

remain in concealment, you’ll be a source of bounty and blessing for your brothers. 

If you appear beneath all your brothers, and there is the possibility of its being you, it will 

attract respect to each of them. 

But if you emerge from concealment and display yourself, although when beneath them 
you were revered, above, you become a tyrant. There you were a sun, here you cast 
shadows. 

You belittle your brothers, and lose them their respect. That means, to display one’s 

qualities and one’s individuality is doubly tyrannical. If it is thus, that is how you 
will appear. 

So what place remains for lying artificiality and hypocrisy, the ‘personality,’ and fame? 
This is a profound mystery, springing from Divine wisdom and perfect order. 
An exceptional individual draws the veil of concealment over himself within his species 
or group, thus affording it value in the view of others, and making it appreciated. 

Examples for you: saints among mankind, the appointed hour within a lifetime are 
unknown, indefinite. Concealed within Friday is the hour prayers are accepted. 
Hidden in Ramadan is the Night of Power. Concealed in the Most Beautiful Names 
is the elixir of the Greatest Name.  

It is their indefiniteness that makes these examples awesome, this mystery, beautiful; they 

For example, there is a balance in the appointed hour being vague; it holds true, whatever 

are proved through concealment.  

your circumstances. 

The two pans of fear and hope, working for the next world or for this; imagined 

permanent existence imparts a pleasure to life.  

Twenty years of uncertain life are preferable to a thousand-year lifetime the end of which 

is specified. For after half of it had passed, every passing hour you would be taking 
another step towards the gallows. 

Your suffering would increase proportionately; it would afford you no solace; you would 

find no peace. 

It Is Mistaken To Feel Mercy and Anger Greater Than God’s 

Greater mercy than God’s may not be bestowed. Greater wrath than God’s may not be 

visited on something. 

So leave matters to the All-Just and Compassionate One, for to be more compassionate 

causes you pain, and to be more wrathful is wrongful.

Wastefulness Leads To Squandering, Squandering Leads To Poverty 

My wasteful brother! Two morsels which are the same as regards nutrition, one costing 

one kurush, the other, costing ten,  

Are equal both before they enter the mouth, and after they have passed down the gullet. 

Only for a few seconds in the mouth do they give pleasure to the heedless. 

They have different tastes, which always deceives it, that sense of taste; it is a doorkeeper 

and inspector for the body and stomach. 

The taste’s effect is negative, not positive; its function, only to tip the doorkeeper and 

gratify it; to give pleasure to that senseless one! 

To confuse it in its true duty, to give it eleven kurush rather than one, is a satanic habit. 
The most prodigal of wastefulness, the worst form of extravagance, is one sort, one way: 

so don’t seek it. 

The Sense of Taste Is a Telegraphist; Don’t Seduce It By Gratifying It29 

Divine dominicality, wisdom, and grace, made two centres with the mouth and nose, 

placing within them a frontier post, and correspondents.  

In the microcosm, God made the blood-vessels telephones, and the nerves, telegraphs.  
That True Provider made the sense of smell a telephone, and posted the sense of taste to 
the telegraph. Out of His mercy, he put an instruction sheet on the food: flavour, and 
colour, and smell. 

Thus, these three attributes are proclamations, invitations, permits, and heralds on the part 

of the food; with them it invites the needy and its customers. 

He gave taste, sight, and smell to the feeding animals as tools. He adorned the foods with 
various decorations, then soothed their flighty breasts, and attracted the indifferent 
by exciting them.  

When the food enters the mouth, the sense of taste immediately sends telegraphs to every 

part of the body. The sense of smell telephones, giving information about the types 
of foods. 

These senses act according to all the different needs of the different animals receiving 

food; the necessary preparations are made, or it receives a refusal. 

Then they throw it out, and spit it in your face! Since they have been charged with this by 
wisdom, don’t seduce them with pleasure. Don’t deceive them by gratifying them.  

                                                

29 This piece forms the seed of İktisad Risalesi [The Nineteenth Flash]. Indeed, he expressed in ten 

lines the ten-page Treatise On Frugality before it came into existence. 

 

757 

For then they will forget what true appetite is; false appetite will be born; it will strike 

your head, bringing illness and disease as penalties.  

True pleasure springs from true appetite, true appetite from true need; this pleasure is 

ample for king and beggar alike.  

Moreover, a dinar and a dirhem are equal; the pleasure jumbles them together, soothing 

the pain. 

Like Intention, Point of View May Transform 
Habitual Actions Into Worship 

Note this point! Just as through intention, permissible habitual actions may become 
worship, so according to the point of view, the physical sciences may become 
knowledge of God. 

If you study and reflect, that is, if you look at things as signifying one other than 

themselves,30 and in respect to art: “How beautifully the Maker made these, how 
well He did it!” instead of: “How beautiful it is;” 

If you look from this point of view at the universe, the inscriptions of the Pre-Eternal 

Inscriber, His order and wisdom, and flashes of purpose and art will illuminate your 
doubts; 

The sciences of the universe will become knowledge of God. But if you look at things as 
signifying themselves from the point of view of Nature, saying: “The thing looks to 
itself alone,” 

If you look thus at the universe, whatever the extent of your scientific knowledge, it will 
be ignorance. Wretched truths become worthless in worthless hands. The witnesses 
to this are many. 

At This Time the Shari’a Does Not Permit Us Affluence 

When tasty foods call one, one should say: “It’s as though I ate it.” For someone who 

made this his rule, did not eat a mosque!31 

Formerly, most Muslims did not go hungry; they enjoyed comfortable living to an extent. 
Now, however, most have declined into penury, and the Shari’a no longer permits the 

taking of pleasure. 

                                                

30 ‘Mana-yı Harfi:’ the Qur’anic view that things bear the meaning of one other than themselves, that 
is, point to their Maker, and His Names and attributes, like a letter or word signifies its writer, as opposed 
to ‘Mana-yı İsmi,’ the view that things signify themselves alone. [Tr.] 

31 There is a mosque in Istanbul called ‘Sanki Yedim’ (It is as though I ate it). The man who said “It is 

as though I ate it” saved himself from his appetites and built the mosque with the proceeds.

The subsistence of the mass of Muslims, and most innocents, is simple. It is a thousand 

times preferable to follow them in their simple sustenance

preferable. 

Sometimes the Absence of Bounty Is Bounty 

Memory is a bounty, but for an immoral person at times of misfortune, forgetfulness is 

Forgetfulness is also a bounty; it allows one to suffer the pains of only one day; it makes 

one forget the accumulated sorrows. 

All Misfortunes Have Sides Which Are Bounty 

O you smitten by misfortune! Within the misfortune is a bounty. Look closely and you 

will see it!  

Just as in everything is a degree of heat, so in every calamity a degree of bounty is to be 
found. Think of a worse calamity, then see the extent of the bounty in the lesser one, 
And offer abundant thanks to God. For if you’re scared by exaggerating it, and whine and

will turn into fact. 

It will learn from reality, then turn on you and start striking your heart... 

Don’t Appear Important, Or You’ll Be Put Down 

O you with an inflated ego and conceited head! You should understand this rule: in the 
social building of the human community, everyone has a window, called a rank, in 
which to see and be seen. 

 If the window is larger than a person’s stature and worth, he will stretch and lengthen 
through pride. But if the window is smaller than his stature and aspiration, he will 
bend and bow down out of modesty. 

In the mature and perfected, the measure of greatness is smallness. While in the faulty, 

the measure of littleness is bigness. 

 

759 

If Qualities Change Places, Their Natures Change 

One quality... different places, one face. It is sometimes a demon, sometimes an angel, 

sometimes upright, sometimes wicked; some examples are these: 

If an attribute which for the weak in the face of the strong is considered to be dignity, is 

found in the strong, it is pride and arrogance. 

If an attribute which for the strong before the weak is considered to be humility, is found 

in the weak, it is abasement and hypocrisy. 

In his office, a person of authority’s gravity is dignity, and his humility abasement. But in 

his house, his humility is modesty, and his gravity, arrogance. 

Tolerance in someone speaking on his own account is patriotism, and self-sacrifice, a 

But if the person is speaking on account of others, his tolerance is treachery, and self-

quality, a good deed. 

sacrifice, an attribute, a wicked act. 

In setting up the preliminaries reliance on God is laziness. But handing over to Him in the 

reaping the consequences is the reliance taught by the Shari’a. 

Contentment with one’s lot in respect of the fruits of one’s labour is praiseworthy 

contentment, and strengthens the desire to work. 

But sufficing with existent goods is not desirable contentment, but lack of aspiration. 

There are numerous other examples. 

The Qur’an mentions absolute good works and taqwa. By its indefiniteness, it hints at the 

existence of degrees; its conciseness is a detailed explanation; its silence, an 
expansive word. 

Both ‘Truth Will Prevail,’ and Its Consequences, Are Intended 

Friend! One time, a questioner asked: “Since ‘truth will prevail’ is the truth, why have the 

infidel prevailed over the Muslim, and force over right?” 

I replied: Consider these four points and your difficulty will be resolved. The first point is 

this. It is not necessary that every means of every truth is true. 

Similarly, not every means of every falsehood has to be false. This result emerges: a 

means which is false prevails over a true means. In which case, a truth is overcome 
by a falsehood. It occurs temporarily and indirectly; not essentially or permanently. 

However, finally, it is always still the truth’s. Force possesses a truth, there is an 

underlying meaning in its creation. The second point is this: 

While it is obligatory that all attributes of all Muslims are Muslim, outwardly it is not 

always thus. 

 

760 

Similarly, not all the attributes of all infidels have to be infidel and to arise from their 

So too, all the attributes of all sinners do not always have to sinful and have arisen from 

unbelief. 

their sinfulness. 

This means an infidel’s Muslim attribute prevails over a Muslim’s unlawful attribute. 

Indirectly, the infidel prevails over him. 

Furthermore, in this world the right of life is general and all-embracing. It is a universal 
mercy that has a meaningful manifestation, a wise inner purpose, which unbelief 
does not impede. 

The third point is this: two of the All-Glorious One’s attributes of perfection, two 

‘legislative’ manifestations: the determining through His choice, which proceeds 
from the attribute of Will, and that is the Shari’a of Creation;  

And the well-known Shari’a, which proceeds from the attribute of Speech.  
Just as there is compliance and rebellion in the face of the commands of the latter, so 

there is compliance and rebellion before the creational commands.  

The reward and punishment for the former is received mostly in the hereafter, while the 
penalties and rewards of the latter are suffered mostly in the realm of this world.  
For example, the reward of patience is victory. The penalty for laziness is poverty; and 

The reward of constancy is victory. The penalty of poison is illness, the reward of its 

Sometimes the injunctions of both Shari’as are included in a single thing; it has faces 

the reward of toil is wealth. 

antidote is health. 

looking to both.  

That means obedience to the creational command is a truth. Obedience prevails; rebellion 

in the face of the injunction is a false stand.  

If a truth has been the means to a falsehood, when it prevails, it will have been the means 
to a falsehood. Indirectly, a truth is defeated by a falsehood, but not essentially. 
This means that “the truth prevails” means “essentially.” Also, the end is intended, and 

the restriction of viewpoint is meant.  

The fourth point is this: a truth remained unexpressed, or powerless, or adulterated, or 
convoluted. It needed to be expressed and opened up, or given fresh strength. 

In order to improve and gild it, falsehood had to be temporarily imposed on it, in order to 

to assay that ingot of truth. 

Then it could emerge pure and unadulterated from its origins. Even if falsehood prevails 

in this world, it cannot win the war. “The future belongs to the God-conscious”32 will 
strike them a blow!  

So falsehood is defeated. The mystery of “truth prevails” inflicts punishment on it; see, 

truth prevails!

A Few Social Principles 

If you want some principles for society: unequal justice is not justice.  
Resemblance is an important reason for contrariety. Mutual proportion is the basis of 

solidarity.  

Small-mindedness is the source of pride. Pusillanimity is the mine of arrogance. 

Impotence is the source of opposition.  

Curiosity is the teacher of knowledge. Need is the master of progress. Distress is the

the body. 

Women Left Their Homes and Led Mankind Astray 

When men become amiable through following their fancies, women become masculine 

by being impudent.33 

Low civilization took womankind out of their homes, and turning them into common 

goods, destroyed the respect in which they were held.  

The Shari’a of Islam mercifully invites them back to their homes. It is there they are 

respected, in their homes they are comfortable, in family life.  

Cleanliness is their adornment; their good character is their splendour; their gracious 
beauty is their chastity; their compassion, their perfection; their children, their 
relaxation.  

With so many tools of corruption, one has to be as strong and unyielding as steel to 

withstand them.  

A beautiful woman entering a gathering of brothers, arouses veins of hypocrisy, rivalry, 

envy, and selfishness. Slumbering desires suddenly awaken.  

Increased freedom for women led to a sudden unfolding of bad morality in mankind. The 
represented forms of little smiling corpses have played a large role in making the 
evil-polluted perverse spirit of modern man what it is.34 

The prohibited statue is either petrified tyranny, or embodied lust, or personified 

hypocrisy. Or it is a talisman, attracting those evil spirits. 

                                                

33 This is the basis of Tesettür Risalesi [The Twenty-Fourth Flash, Treatise On Islamic Dress for 
Women]. Twenty years later, a court of law forever shamed itself and its judges by making it the pretext for 
the author’s conviction. 

34 Just as to look lustfully at a dead woman shows an awesomely degenerate soul, so to look at a 

beautiful picture of an unfortunate female corpse needy for compassion, extinguishes the elevated 
sentiments of the spirit. 

 

762 

The Scope of Divine Power Rejects Intermediaries and Helpers 

From the point of view of the comprehensive effectiveness of the disposals of the All-

Glorious and Powerful One’s power, our sun is like a particle. 

There are vast disposals of power in a single realm of beings. Take the gravity between 

two particles, 

Then go and put it beside the gravity between the Sun of Suns and the Milky Way. 
Bring an angel whose load is a snowflake to the radiant angel who holds the sun; put a 

needle-fish beside a whale;  

Conceive at once of the vast manifestation of the Pre-Eternal All-Powerful One of Glory, 

His perfect art in things from the smallest to the greatest;  

Customary matters like gravity and laws, fluid intermediaries, are only names for the 

manifestation of His power and the disposal of His wisdom; 

They signify Him alone; they can have no other meaning; think of them together, you 

will necessarily understand the true cause.  

In the view of that power, apparent intermediaries, helpers, and partners are all false, all 

imaginary and impossible.  

Life is the perfection of existence, its rank is high and important. Consequently, I say: 
why should the globe, our world, not be obedient and subjugated to it, like an 
animal? 

Living birds of the Pre-Eternal Sovereign of this sort are numerous, spread through the 

arena of space, majestic, beautiful. 

Dispersed through the garden of creation, they spin; their refrains, their motion, are words 
of glorification, modes of worship, of the Pre-Eternal Undying One, the Eternal All-
Wise One.  

The globe resembles a living being, it displays signs of life. If to suppose the impossible 

it was reduced to the size of an egg, 

There is a strong possibility it would become a tiny animal. If a micro-organism was 

expanded to the size of the earth, most probably it would be just like it. 

If the world was reduced to the size of a man, and the stars transformed into particles, it is 

possible it would become a conscious animal, as well as intelligent. 

This means the world with all its parts is a glorifying servant of the Undying Creator, the 

Eternal All-Powerful One, obedient, subjugated. 

To be large quantitatively does not always infer being great qualitatively, for a clock the 
size of a mustard-seed is more eloquent than a clock the size of Aya Sophia.  
A fly’s creation is more wondrous than that of an elephant, that undiscriminating 

creature. 

If a Qur’an was to be written by the Pen of Power in atoms of ether on the  

 

763 

minutest particle, the art being in inverse proportion to the size of the page, 

Its eloquence would be equal to a Qur’an written in stars on the face of the heavens. The 
Pre-Eternal Inscriber’s art is everywhere of the utmost beauty and perfection. 
Everywhere it is thus. The pen proclaims Divine unity since it always works with utter 

perfection. Study carefully this most meaningful piece! 

The Angels Are a Community, Charged With the Shari’a of Creation 

There are two Divine Shari’as: proceeding from two attributes, man is addressed by both, 

and bound to comply with both.  

The Shari’a of Creation, which proceeds from the attribute of Will, orders the 

circumstances and motions of the world, the macrocosm, which are not voluntary. It 
is dominical will, and is also wrongly termed ‘Nature.’  

The Shari’a proceeding from the attribute of Speech is the code of laws which orders the 

actions of man, the microcosm, which are voluntary.  

The two Shari’as sometimes come together in the same place. The Divine angels are a 

vast community, a Divine army. 

They are obedient bearers of the first Shari’a, workers and representatives. Some of them 

are worshipping slaves of God, others throng the Divine Throne in ecstasy. 

As Matter Is Refined, Life Is Intensified 

Life is fundamental, basic; matter is dependent on it, and subsists through it. If you 

compare a microscopic organism with its five senses, and man’s senses, you will see 
that however much larger man is than the organism, his senses are inferior to the 
same degree.  

The organism hears its brother’s voice. It sees its food. If it was enlarged to the size of a 
man, its senses would be wondrous, its life dazzling, and the sight of it like a 
lightning flash lighting up the skies. 

Man is not a living being composed of dead beings, but a living human cell composed of 

thousands of millions of living cells. 

Man is like the Sura Ya. Sin., in which is inscribed Sura Ya. Sin. Blessed be God, the 

Best of Creators!35

Materialism Is an Immaterial Plague 

Materialism is an immaterial plague; mankind caught this fearsome fever.36 Its 

inculcation and imitation caused mankind to be visited suddenly by Divine wrath. 

This plague spreads to the extent the ability to criticize spreads. It was inculcated by 

science, and learnt blind imitation from modern civilization. 

Freedom led to criticism; misguidance sprang from its pride. 

There Is Nothing Idle In Existence; 
The Unemployed Man Works On Account of Non-Existence 

The most miserable, wretched, and distressed person, is the unemployed. For idleness is 
non-existence within existence, death within life. Whereas exertion is the life of 
existence, and the waking state of life! 

Usury and Interest Cause Absolute Harm to Islam 

Usury is the cause of idleness, it extinguishes enthusiasm for work.  
The profit of the doors of usury and their containers, the banks, is always for the worst 

group of mankind, the infidels.  

The infidels’ profits go to the worst of them, that is, the oppressors. 
The profit of the oppressors always goes to the worst of them; that is, the dissolute; it 

causes the World of Islam absolute harm.  

In the view of the Shari’a all mankind cannot always be prosperous. For a belligerent 
infidel is disrespectful, unchaste, and his blood is spilt for nothing, always. 

The Qur’an Will Defend Itself and Perpetuate Its Sovereignty37 

I saw someone who was stricken by despair, he was sick with pessimism. He said: “The 

‘ulama have decreased in number, quantity has replaced quality.  

“I’m frightened our religion will die out one day.” I replied: So long as the universe is not 

extinguished, Islamic belief will not die.  

Also, so long as the marks of Islam, the minarets of religion, the places of  

                                                

36 This alludes to the First World War. 
37 This piece, which was written thirty-five years ago, is in a style that could have been written this 

year. That is, it was a sort of prediction inspired by the effulgence of Ramadan. 

 

765 

Divine worship, the works of the Shari’a, all like nails struck in the face of the earth, 
–so long as they are not extinguished, Islam will ever shine. 

All the mosques are instructors, teaching their frequenters; and all the instructors have 
become masters; through the tongue of disposition, without error or forgetfulness, 
they instil in them the religion. 

All the marks are learned teachers, constantly teaching the spirit of Islam to those who 
look on them. With the centuries, they have become the cause of continuity. 

The lights of Islam are as though embodied in its marks; and the pure water of Islam has 

solidified in its places of worship, embodying them – each a pillar of belief. 
The injunctions of Islam are as though embodied within its works; the pillars of Islam 

have become petrified in its worlds – each a diamond pillar; through them the earth 
and sky are bound together . 

Especially the orator of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, a constantly repeated pre-
eternal discourse; no village, no place at all has remained within the Islamic lands 

That does not listen to its address, does not hear its teaching. According to the inner 

meaning of Indeed We preserve it,38 to be a hafiz is a very high station. To recite it is 
worship for men and jinn. 

It is for this reason it should be taught, and its incontestable matters mentioned. With 

constant repetition, theoretical matters become incontestable, and turn into self-
evident facts, not requiring further expounding. 

The essentials of religion ceased being theoretical matters and became essentials. To 

mention them is sufficient. To remind is enough. The Qur’an is always a healer.39 
The Islamic revival and social awakening provides evidence for everyone and a balance, 

for reminders and mentioning. 

Since social life began in Islam, the belief of an individual is not restricted to proofs 

particular to himself; it is based on the conscience. Indeed, it is based on innumerable 
matters in the common heart.  

It is worthy of note, it is difficult to abolish even a weak school of thought as time passes. 
So what about Islam, which is based on the two firm foundations of revelation and 
innate disposition, and has ruled so effectively for so many centuries! 

With its firmly rooted principles, its profound works, it has cohered to half the globe, 
becoming a natural spirit. If it is now eclipsed, it will immediately emerge! 

But regretably certain giddy infidels with their false arguments attack the firm 

foundations of this lofty palace whenever they find the chance. 

                                                

38 Qur’an, 15:9. 
39 For further explanation, see, The Twenty-Seventh Word, pp. 498-9 in the present work. [Tr.] 

 

766 

They try to shake them. But those principles cannot be interfered with, or tampered with; 

fall silent now, irreligion! That scoundrel is bankrupt. Enough now, the experiment 
of disbelief and lies! 

The Islamic world’s advance-post against the world of unbelief was the Darülfunun.40 

But due to indifference and heedlessness, the reptilian foe of Nature 

Opened up a breach behind the front; irreligion assaulted, the nation was well shaken. 
The advance-post should be a paradise illuminated with the spirit of Islam. 

It should be the firmest, and truly awakened, or it should not be that institution. It must 

not deceive Islam. The heart is the seat of belief; the mind is where the light of belief 
is reflected.41 

Sometimes it is a mujahid, sometimes it is a sweep; if the doubts of the mind do not enter 

the heart, the likelihood is belief and the conscience will not be shaken. 

For if as some people suppose belief is in the mind, numerous possibilities, all pitiless 

enemies, oppose ‘absolute certainty,’ which is the spirit of belief. 

The heart and conscience are the seat of belief. Intuition and inspiration are the evidence 

for belief. A sixth sense, the way of belief. Thought and intellect, the watchmen of 
belief. 

Reminding About Incontestable Matters Is Needed, 
Rather Than Instruction In Theoretical Ones 

The essentials of religion, the incontestable matters of the Shari’a, are present in people’s 

hearts; they are made conscious of them by being reminded. 

The desired result is obtained. Arabic42 performs this reminder in more lofty fashion. 
The Arabic Khutba in the Friday prayers is sufficient for recalling the essentials and 

incontestable matters. 

There, instruction in theoretical matters is not required. Moreover, those Arabic words 
stamp an imprint of unity on the face of Islam’s conscience; to multiply [their 
language] is unacceptable.

Hadiths Say To The Qur’an’s Verses: It’s Impossible To Reach You! 

If you compare verses and Hadiths, you will see clearly that the most eloquent of men 
was the conveyer of revelation, yet not even his eloquence was equal to the 
eloquence of the Qur’an’s verses.  

Not even he could emulate it. That means that all the words issuing from Muhammad’s 

tongue were not his. 

Expound The Qur’an’s Miraculousness Concisely 

One time I had a dream: I was at the foot of Mount Ararat. The mountain suddenly 
exploded, scattering rocks the size of mountains all over the world, shaking it.  
Then a man appeared at my side. He told me: “Expound the aspects of the Qur’an’s 

miraculousness you know, concisely and succinctly!” 

I thought of the dream’s meaning while still dreaming, telling myself: the explosion here 

symbolizes a revolution in mankind.  

As a result of it the guidance of the Criterion of Truth and Falsehood will be exalted 

everywhere, and will rule. And the time will come to expound its miraculousness!  
I said to the questioner in reply: The Qur’an’s miraculousness is manifested from seven 

sources, it is also composed of seven elements: 

F i r s t   S o u r c e : This is the fluency of its wording, arising from the purity of its 
language; and its brilliant manner of exposition, born of the beauty of the word-
order; the eloquence of the meanings, the originality of the concepts, the excellence 
of the inferences, and the singularity of its styles. 

Combined with these, in its miraculousness are a wondrous embroidery and exposition, 

and an original art and language, so its repetition never wearies or bores. 

S e c o n d   E l e m e n t :  A treasury of occult sciences containing the hidden principles 
of cosmic events, the obscure mysteries of the Divine truths, the unseen matters of 
revelation, events concealed in the past, and matters hidden in the future. 

The tongue of the worlds of the Unseen speaks with the Manifest World; it discloses its 
matters symbolically; its aim is mankind, a luminous flash of miraculousness. 
T h i r d   S o u r c e : It has a wondrous comprehensiveness in five aspects. In its words, 

meanings, injunctions, and its knowledge, and the balance of its aims. 
Its words contain truly vast possibilities and numerous aspects, yet each is  

 

768 

the one preferred by eloquence, the most correct in its Arabic and apt in the view of 
the Shari’a. 

Its meaning: The miraculousness of its exposition at once comprehends and comprises 

the ways of all the saints, the illuminations of those versed in knowledge of God, the 
schools of those on the sufi way, the ways of the scholars of kala\m, and the paths of 
the philosophers. The breadth of its evidence, the expanse of its meanings. If you 
look through this window, what a broad arena you will see! 

The scope of its injunctions: The wondrous Shari’a has deduced from it all the principles 

for the happiness of this world and the next, all the means of salvation. 
Its pronouncements at once embrace all the relations of social life, all methods of 

education, the realities of all conditions. 

The profundity of its knowledge: It has brought together in its paradise, in the fortresses of 
its Suras, both the physical sciences and the Divine sciences, and all signs, allusions, 
and indications to them. 

Its aims and purposes: It has applied perfect balance and regular sequence; conformed 
with the principles of the innate nature of things and unity, and has preserved the 
balance. 

So see the marvellous encompassment in the comprehensiveness of its words, the breadth 
of its meanings, the scope of its injunctions, the profundity of its knowledge, and the 
balance of its aims. 

F o u r t h   E l e m e n t :  It bestows a luminous effulgence on every age in accordance 
with its understanding and degree of literacy, and on all the classes of men in 
accordance with their capacities and abilities. 

Its door is open to every era and every class within each. It is as though this Speech of the 

Most Merciful is freshly revealed every instant, everywhere. 

The Qur’an grows younger as it grows older; its signs become apparent; it rends the veil 

of Nature and causes, that Divine address. 

It sheds the light of Divine unity continuously from every verse. It raises the veil of the 

Manifest World, cast over the Unseen.  

The loftiness of its address invites man’s attentive gaze, for it is the tongue of the 

Unseen; it speaks with the Manifest World. Its wondrous freshness proceeds from 
this element, an all-encompassing ocean! 

Divine condescension to the mind’s of men, to make it familiar. The variety of the styles 

of its revelation makes it familiar to men and jinn. 

F i f t h   S o u r c e :  It relates in an original style laden with meaning, as though itself 
had witnessed them, of its stories and narrations, and truthful accounts, making their 
essential points ;  

With them it warns mankind. What it relates is these: it tells of former events, and future 

events, the secrets of Hell and of Heaven; 

 

769 

Truths of the Unseen, and mysteries of the Manifest World, Divine mysteries, stories 

about cosmic relations; 

Clear stories that neither fact has refuted, nor logic. Even if logic does not accept them, it 

cannot refute them – the revealed books, which are revered by all the world. 
It relates faithfully the points on which they agree, and mentions in correct form the 

subjects on which they differ. These matters issuing from one “unlettered” was a 
wonder of the time! 

S i x t h   E l e m e n t : It was the founder of the religion of Islam, and comprises it. If 

you investigate time and place, neither the past was capable of producing the like of 
Islam, nor is the future. 

This heavenly thread holds the globe in its annual and daily rotations, and spins it. It 

weighed down heavily on the earth and mounted it, but the earth still does not give 
up its rebellion. 

S e v e n t h   S o u r c e :  The six lights pouring forth from these six sources blend 

together; from this a beauty becomes apparent, and from this an intuition, a luminous 
means of understanding. 

This produces a pleasure: the pleasure of miraculousness may be known, but our 

language is inadequate to describe it. The mind too is defective; that celestial star 
may be seen, but not held. 

For thirteen centuries the Qur’an’s enemies have desired to challenge it, while it has 

aroused in its friends a desire to imitate it. This too is a proof of its miraculousness. 
Millions of Arabic books have been written in consequence of these two intense desires, 

coming into the library of existence.  

If they are compared with revelation, if they are weighed up, relying on the evidence of 

their eyes and ears not only the learned scholar, even the common man, will declare: 
“This is heavenly, those are human!” 

They will also say: “It doesn’t resemble them, it is not of the same class. It is therefore 

lower than all of them, and this is self-evidently not true. 

“In which case, it is superior to all of them.” Its meanings in all that time. The door is 

open, dedicated to mankind; it has summoned to itself spirits and minds! 

Man had power over it, and laid claim to it, but his meanings still could not oppose the 

Qur’an; he never could; now the time of testing has passed. 

It does not resemble other books, it cannot be compared to them. For it was dominical 
wisdom its being revealed bit by bit over twenty years in relation to need, in 
miscellaneous parts. 

The immediate causes of revelation were various and distinct. The questions about any 
one matter were repeated and various. The events related to injunctions were 
numerous and changed. The times of revelation were distinct and different. 

 

770 

The conditions it was considering were various and different; the groups of those it was 

addressing were numerous and remote from each other; the aims of its guidance were 
graded and various.  

Its structure, and expositions, and replies, and addresses were based on these foundations. 
Yet despite this, its smoothness of style and lack of defect, its mutual proportion and 
harmony, demonstrated its perfection.  

Witness to this is that according to the science of rhetoric, the Qur’an has a characteristic 
not present in other speech: if you listen to other speech, you will see the speaker (or 
writer) behind it, or you will find him within it. Style is the mirror of man. 
O dream-questioner! You asked for conciseness, so I have made an indication. If you 

want a detailed exposition, that is beyond my capabilities! A fly cannot behold the 
sky. For of the forty sorts of miraculousness, only one is the eloquence of the word-
order; and an exposition of it did not fit in Isharat al-I’jaz.  

My hundred-page commentary was insufficient for it. Rather, I want a detailed exposition 

from spirit-inspirations like yourself! 

The Fanciful, Lust-Exciting Genius-Style Hand of Western Literature 
Cannot Reach Up To the Healing, Light-Scattering, Guidance-Laden, 
Eternal Literature of the Qur’an 

A state of mind pleasing to the mature and perfected with their appreciation of meaning, 

does not gratify the childish, whimsical, and dissolute, 

It does not entertain them. In consequence, those raised amid base, dissolute, carnal and 

lusty pleasures will not experience spiritual pleasure. 

 Looking with the ‘novel-based’ view of modern literature, which issued from Europe, 
they will neither see nor experience the elevated subtleties, the majestic virtues, of 
the Qur’an. 

Their touchstone cannot assay those virtues. There are three areas in which literature 

promenades; it roams within their bounds: 

Either love and sorrow, or heroism and valour, or depiction of reality. In foreign 

literature, it does not seek the truth in heroism; it rather instils a desire for power by 
applauding mankind’s cruelties.  

As regards sorrow and love, it does not know true love; it injects into the soul a lust-

exciting thrill.  

In the question of depicting reality, it does not look on the universe as Divine art; it does 

not see it with its hue of the Most Merciful.  

It rather approaches it from the point of view of ‘Nature,’ and depicts it thus; and it 

cannot be freed from this. 

For this reason, what it inculcates is love of ‘Nature.’ It instils in the heart a  

 

771 

feeling of materialism, from which it cannot easily be saved. 

Again, that unmannerly literature, both sedative and narcotic, can provide no beneficial 
salve for the distress of the spirit which arises from the misguidance resulting from 
the above. 

It has found a single remedy, and that is its novels and fiction. Books with their dead 
living, the cinema with its animated corpses. The dead cannot bestow life! 

And the theatre with its reincarnations and ghosts from the vast grave known as the past. 

– It is completely unashamed at these three sorts of its fiction. 

It has put a mendacious tongue in mankind’s mouth, attached a lustful eye to its face, 
dressed the world in a scarlet petticoat, and does not recognize sheer beauty. 

If it points to the sun, it puts in the reader’s mind a beautiful blonde actress. It apparently 

says: “Vice is bad, it is not fitting for man.” 

It points out its harmful consequences. But its depictions so incite vice that they make the 

mouth water and the reason cannot remain in control. 

They whet the appetite, excite desire, so the emotions no longer heed anything. The 

literature of the Qur’an, however, does not stir up desire; 

It imparts a sense of love of the truth, a passion for sheer loveliness, an appreciation and 

taste for beauty, a desire for reality. And it does not deceive. 

It does not look at the universe from the point of view of Nature; it speaks of it from the 
point of view of Divine art, with the colouring of the Most Merciful. It does not 
confuse the mind. 

It instils the light of knowledge of the Maker. It points out His signs in all things. Both 

produce a touching sorrow, but they do not resemble each other. 

The literature born of Europe excites a pathetic sorrow arising from the lack of friends, 

from being ownerless; not an elevated sorrow. 

For it is a woebegone sadness inspired by deaf Nature and blind force. It shows the world 

It depicts it in this way, holds the sorrowing man there, places him ownerless among 

as desolate, not in any other way. 

strangers, leaving him without hope. 

Due to this feeling of consternation it has given him, he gradually sinks into misguidance; 
it opens up the way to atheism, from whence it is difficult to return. Perhaps he never 
will return. 

Qur’anic literature produces a sorrow, but it is the sorrow of love, not of orphans. It arises 

from separation from friends, not from the lack of them. 

Its view of the universe, in place of blind Nature, is as conscious, merciful Divine art; it 

does not speak of Nature. 

Instead of blind force, it describes wise and purposeful Divine power. The universe, 

therefore, does not take on the form of a desolate wasteland. 

 

772 

Indeed, in the view of the grieving one it addresses, it becomes a gathering of friends. On 

every side mutual love and response, which cause no distress. 

The friendliness at every corner draws the melancholy person into society, giving him a 

yearning sorrow, an elevated feeling; not a dejected mournfulness. 

Both give rise to eagerness. But through the eagerness provoked by the foreign literature, 
the soul becomes excited, the desires are stimulated; its gives no joy to the spirit. 
The Qur’an’s eagerness, however, fires the spirit, gives rise to a lofty eagerness. It is for 

this reason that the Shari’a of Muhammad (PBUH) wants no amusements or 
diversion. 

It has forbidden some musical instruments, for amusement, and permitted others. That is 
to say, instruments producing Qur’anic sorrow or revelational eagerness are not 
harmful. 

But if it produces the woebegone grief of the orphan or carnal thrills, the instrument is 

prohibited. It changes from person to person, not everyone is the same. 

Branches Offer Fruits In the Name of Mercy 

On every side the branches of the tree of creation apparently extend the fruits of bounties 

to the hands of beings with spirits. 

But in reality it is a hand of mercy, a hand of power, which holds out to us those branches 

You should kiss that hand of mercy in gratitude; you should proclaim the holiness of that 

and fruits. 

hand of power thankfully. 

An Explanation of the Three Ways Indicated at the End of Sura al-Fatiha 

O brother full of hope! Take your imagination and come with me. See, we are in a land, 

we look around. There is no one to see us. 

A layer of black cloud has settled on the high mountains, like tent-posts. The cloud has 

It forms a solid ceiling, but its six sides are open, so the sun is visible. We are under the 

covered too the whole face of the earth. 

cloud, the darkness oppresses us. 

The distress is suffocating, the airlessness is killing us. Now three ways are open to us. 

One is a luminous world, I beheld it once, that metaphorical land. 

 

773 

Yes, I came here once before, I have passed down these three ways. The first way is this: 

most people take it; it is the way of the world, it invites us to travel it. 

See, we are on our way, we are going on foot. See how the sea-sands of the desert scorch 

us with their anger, threatening us! 

See the mountainous waves; they are threatening us too. Now thanks be to God we have 

emerged on the other side, we can see the face of the sun. 

But only we know the difficulties we have suffered. Oh! we have returned to the 

wasteland, the ceiling of cloud with its lowering darkness. What we need is the eye 
of the heart to illumine things. 

A wondrous light-filled world; if you have the courage, we shall enter it together, this 

way so fraught with dangers. Our second way: 

We shall plunge through Nature-earth, and pass to the other side. Or trembling, we shall 

pass through a natural tunnel.  

I travelled this way one time, fearlessly and full of prayer. But on that occasion I had with 

me a substance to smelt and rend the Nature-earth.  

The third way: The Qur’an had given me that miraculous evidence. Brother, stick close 

behind me, and have no fear!  

See, here await us tunnel-like caves and underground torrents. They will let us pass. 
Don’t let these awesome lifeless beings of Nature scare you in the slightest!  
For behind its sour face is the smiling countenance of its compassionate Owner. I 

perceived that radium-like substance of the Qur’an through its light.  

There, you see! We have come out in the light-filled world, see this delicate earth, this 
soft and gentle air. Raise your head! See, it has drawn its head to the skies, rent the 
clouds, leaving them far below. This Tuba-tree invites us –  

It is the Qur’an. It has spread its branches everywhere. We must hang onto this branch 

which is trailing down, so that it can raise us up. 

That heavenly tree – on earth, one of its personifications is the Illustrious Shari’a. That is 
to say, we ascended to this world of light in that way without difficulty; we were 
shaken by no distress. 

Since we went wrong, we’ll return to our former place and find the right way. See, our 

third way! Over the mountains hovers a Royal Falcon;  

He is reciting the ezan to the whole world. See, the supreme muezzin, Muhammad al-

Hashimi (PBUH), is summoning mankind to the luminous world of light. He enjoins 
supplication and obligatory prayers. 

Look at the mountains! See, the guidance has rent the clouds! The mountain of the 

Shari’a has raised its head to the skies. How it has adorned the face and eye of the 
earth! 

Now we must depart from here in the aircraft of endeavour. The light and  

 

774 

breeze are there; the light of beauty is there. Ah, now here is the Uhud of Divine 
unity, that mighty mountain. 

Here is the Judi of Islam, that wholesome mountain. Here is the Mountain of the Moon, 
the Qur’an of al-Azhar, the pure water of the Nile flows from that sublime source. 
Take a drink of its sweet water! 

So blessed be God, the Best of Creators.43 * And their call shall close with “All praise be 

to God, Sustainer of All the Worlds!”44 

Friend! Now cast away your imagination and don your reason! The first two ways are 

those of “those who have received Your anger” and “those who have gone astray.”45  

Their perils are numerous. On them is perpetual winter, their autumn and summer. Only 

one out of a hundred is saved, like Plato and Socrates.  

The third way is easy, and direct and straight. Weak and strong are equal. Everyone may 

take it. The most comfortable is this: to be either martyr or ‘ghazi’. 

Now we come to the conclusion: Yes, the first two ways are the path and school of the 
genius of science. As for the guidance of the Qur’an, the third way is its straight 
path; it will take us there. 

O God! Guide us to the straight path. * The path of those whom You have 
blessed, not those who have received Your anger, nor those who have gone 
astray. 

All True Pain Is In Misguidance, and All True Pleasure In Belief; 
A Mighty Truth Robed In Imagination 

Prudent fellow-traveller! My friend! If you want to see clearly the differences beween the 

luminous way of the “straight path” and the gloomy path of “those who have 
received Your anger” and “those who have gone astray,” 

Come, take your fancy and mount your imagination, together we shall go to the darkness 

of non-existence. We shall visit that vast grave, that city of the dead. 

A Pre-Eternal All-Powerful One took us out of that place of darkness with His hand of 
power, mounted us on existence, and sent us to this world, this city without 
pleasures. 

Now we have come to the world of existence, this fearful desert. Our eyes have opened, 

we’ve looked in the six directions.  

                                                

43 Qur’an, 23:14. 
44 Qur’an, 10:10. 
45 Qur’an, 1:7. 

 

775 

Firstly we look before us seeking favours, but tribulations and pains assault us like 

enemies. We take fright at that and draw back.  

We look to left and right to the natural elements, seeking assistance. But we see their 

hearts are hard and merciless. They grind their teeth, glowering at us angrily. They 
heed neither plea nor plaint. 

Like creatures beleaguered, we despairingly lift our gazes upwards. Seeking help, we 

look to the heavenly bodies, but they threaten us awesomely. 

As though each was a bomb; having shot out of their cases they are speeding through 

space. But somehow or other they do not obstruct each other. 

If by chance one confused its way, this Manifest World would be blown to pieces, God 

forbid! It is tied to coincidence; no good can come of that. 

In despair we turn back our gaze from that direction, overcome by grievous 

bewilderment. We bow our heads and  look to ourselves; we consider and study 
ourselves.  

Now we hear the shouts of myriad needs coming from our wretched selves. The cries of 

thousands of wants issue forth. While expecting solace, we take fright. 

No good comes from that either. Seeking refuge, we consult our consciences, we look 
within seeking a solution. Alas, again we can find none; we have to help the 
conscience. 

For in it are thousands of hopes, turbulent emotions, wild desires, spread throughout the 

universe. We tremble with all of them, and cannot offer help. 

Compressed in the world of existence, those hopes stretch out to pre-eternity on one side 
and post-eternity on the other. They have such breadth, if they swallowed the world, 
the conscience still would not be satisfied. 

Wherever we have recourse on this grievous road, we encounter misfortune. For the ways 
of “those who have received Your anger” and “those who have gone astray” are thus. 
Chance and misguidance beset that road. 

We follow it and fall into our present state. Even now we temporarily forget its beginning 

and end, the Maker and resurrection of the dead. 

It is worse than Hell, it scorches more terribly, it crushes our spirits. For we had recourse 

to those six directions, but this state resulted. 

It fills us with awesome terror, making us shudder with impotence, disquiet and 
apprehension, orphanhood and despair, so that it racks our conscience. 

Now we shall form a front opposite each of the directions and try to repulse them. Firstly 

we have recourse to our own strength, but alas! we are powerless, weak.  

Secondly, we address ourselves to silencing the needs of the soul. But alas! we see that 

they cry out unceasingly. 

Thirdly, we cry out for help seeking a saviour, but no one hears or responds.  

 

776 

We suppose everything to be hostile, everything strange. Nothing consoles our 
hearts, nothing gives a sense of security, or true pleasure. 

Fourthly, the more we looked at the celestial bodies, the more they filled us with fright 
and awe. Vexing the conscience, alienating it; tormenting the mind, filling it with 
delusions. 

Brother! That is the way of misguidance! On it we experienced all the darkness of 

unbelief. Come, now, my brother, we’ll turn again to that non-being. 

Again we shall come. This time our way is the Straight Path, and the way of belief. Our 
guide and leader are wisdom and the Qur’an, the Falcon that overflies the centuries. 

At one time, the Pre-Eternal Sovereign’s mercy and grace willed our existence, His 

power brought us forth, graciously mounting us on the law of His will, completing us 
stage after stage. 

Then it compassionately clothed us in the garment of existence, bestowed on us the Trust 

and its rank; the mark of this is supplication and the obligatory prayers. 

All the stages are stopping-places on our long road. To make our road easy, Divine 

Determining issued a decree and pasted it on the page of our foreheads; 
Wherever we go, with whichever group we are guests, we are welcomed in truly 
brotherly fashion. We give of our belongings, and we receive from theirs. 
Love born of commerce, they nourish us, adorn us with gifts, then they see us on our 
way. Now at last we have come to the door of the world. We hear a noise. 
See, we have arrived at the earth. We have stepped foot in the Manifest World. The 

festival of the Most Merciful, the clamorous habitation of man.  

We know nothing at all, our guide and leader is the will of the Merciful One. Our guide’s 

deputy, our delicate eyes. We open our eyes and look around. Do we recall the first 
time we came? 

We were strangers, orphans. Our enemies were many. We did not know our protector. 

Now, with the light of belief, we have a strong pillar, a point of support, a protector, 
who repulses those enemies.  

And that is belief in God, which is the light of our spirits, and light of our lives, and spirit 

of our spirits. Now our hearts are easy, we disregard the enemies, not even 
recognizing them.  

When on our first journey we consulted our consciences, we heard innumerable cries and 

laments, and complaints. 

It was due to them that we were overcome by misfortune. For our hopes and desires, 
capacity and senses always desire eternity. But we did not know how to obtain it, 
hence their lamentations and cries. 

 

777 

However, all praise be to God, this time we have found a point of succour which always 
gives life to our innate disposition and hopes; it makes them take flight for eternity. 
Our innate disposition shows them the way from that point, and seeks help; drinks down 
the water of life, and races to its perfection through that point of succour, that 
encouraging, elusive symbol. 

The second pole of belief is affirmation of the resurrection of the dead. Everlasting 

happiness is that shell’s pearl. The proof of belief, the Qur’an; the conscience, a 
human mystery. 

Now raise your head, and take a look at the universe. Speak a word with it. It appeared 
formidable on our former way. Now it is smiling, laughing on every side, coyly 
winking and blinking. 

Do you not see, our eyes have become bees? They fly everywhere in the garden of the 

universe, around the profusion of flowers; each flower profers them a delectable 
draft. 

Each also offers solace, love, and a feeling of familiarity. They too give and take, and 
offer testimony, they make honey flow forth from honey, that mysterious falcon. 
As our gaze alights on the motions of the heavenly bodies, or the stars, or suns, they show 
up the Creator’s wisdom, and the manner of His instruction, and the manifestation of 
His mercy, making them take flight. 

It is as though the sun is speaking with us, saying: “My brothers! Don’t feel frightened or 
dismayed. You are welcome, how good you have come! This dwelling-place is 
yours, I am but a candle-holder. 

“I am like you, but a pure, obedient, unrebellious servant. Out of His utter mercy, the 

Single and Eternally Besought One subjected me so that I would serve you with my 
light. Light and heat are from me, supplication and prayer from you!” 
Now look at the moon! And the stars and the seas; each says in its own tongue: 

“Welcome! It’s good you’ve come! Don’t you recognize us?” 

Look through the mystery of co-operation, through the signs of the order. Each says: “We 
are all servants, mirrors of the All-Glorious One’s mercy; don’t worry, don’t be 
dismayed! 

“Don’t feel frightened or sceptical at the crashing of the thunder and cries of events, for 
within them are the rolling of recitations, the clamour of glorifications, the tumult of 
supplication and entreaty. 

“The All-Glorious One Who sent us to you holds their reins in His hands. The eye of 

faith reads on their faces the signs of mercy; each proclaims them.” 

O believer with a wakeful heart! Let our eyes rest a little; we shall hand over our 

sensitive ears to the blessed hand of belief in their place. We shall send them to the 
world to listen to its delightful refrains. 

 

778 

The universal mourning and lamentations of death imagined on our first way are now all 

supplications and orisons, cries of glorification. 

Listen to the murmuring of the air, the twittering of chicks, the pattering of the rain, the 

plashing of the seas, the crashing of thunder, the crackling of stones; all are 
meaningful refrains. 

The humming of the air, the intoning of the thunder, the strains of the waves are all 
recitations of Grandeur. The chanting of the rains, the warbling of birds are all 
glorifications of Mercy, allusions to reality. 

The sounds of things are all sounds of existence: “I too exist,” they say. The silent 

universe suddenly finds voice: “Don’t suppose us to be lifeless, O chattering man!” 

A tasty morsel or droplet of rain; the birds break into song. 
With their different voices, their tiny songs, they applaud mercy, alight on bounties, 

Implicitly they say: “Beings of the universe, my brothers! How fine are our 

We are tenderly nourished, we are happy at our lot.” With beaks upstretched they scatter 

In its entirety the universe is a lofty orchestra; through the light of belief its recitations, its 

proclaiming their thanks. 

circumstances; 

their songs on the air. 

glorifications, are heard. 

doubt. 

For its wisdom rejects the existence of chance, its order repulses it; in unison they banish 

Fellow-traveller! We are leaving now this world of similitudes, stepping down from 

imagination and fancy. We shall alight in the arena of reason, take stock, and close 
down those ways. 

Our first way, full of pain, that of “those who have received Your anger” and “those who 
have gone astray,” inflicts suffering on the innermost conscience, and severe pain. 
Consciousness showed this; we became the reverse of conscious. 

We have to be saved from it, we need to be, so the pain can be pacified, or numbed, we 

can’t endure it otherwise; no one heeds the cries for help. 

Guidance is healing, but fancies block out the feelings. This requires solace, it requires 

feigned unmindfulness, it requires occupation, it requires entertainment. Enchanting 
desires. 

Then it can deceive the conscience and put the spirit to sleep so they feel no pain. 

Otherwise that grievous suffering scorches the conscience; the pain is unendurable, 
the despair cannot be borne. 

This means, however far one deviates from the Straight Path, to that extent one is 

affected in that way, causing the conscience to cry out. Within every pleasure is a 
pain, a taint. 

That means glittering civilization, which is a mixture of fancy, lust, amusement, and 
licentiousness, is a deceptive panacea for the ghastly distress arising from 
misguidance, a poisonous narcotic. 

 

779 

My dear friend! On our second way, that light-filled road, we perceived a state of mind in 

which life became a source of pleasure, pains became joys. 

We understood that it imparts a state to the spirit varying in degree according the strength 
of belief. The body receives pleasure through the spirit, the spirit receives pleasure 
through the conscience. 

An immediate pleasure is felt in the conscience; a spiritual paradise is present in the 

heart. To think of it is to open it up; while consciousness is marked by its secrets. 

Now, however much the heart is aroused, the conscience stimulated, the spirit stirred, it 

increases the pleasure, transforming fire into light, and winter into spring. 

The doors of paradises open up in the conscience, the world becomes a paradise. Within 

it our spirits take flight, soaring like kites, entreating, praying. 

Worthy fellow-traveller! Farewell for now. Let us offer a prayer together, then we shall 

part, to meet again! 

O God! Lead us to the Straight Path. Amen.

Reply to the Anglican Church 

One time, as a artifice, a pitiless enemy of Islam, a cunning politician, a suspicious 
parson who wanted to swagger and show off, asked us four things, –in the form of denial, 
at a terrible time he had his claws at our throat, in his glee at our misfortune; he wanted 
six hundred words. A reply was needed like a slap in the face of his glee, and his wiles, 
and  his  denial,  like  spitting  in  his  face,  to  silence  him.  I  won’t  address  him.  I  have  the 
following answer for a lover of truth.  

He asked first: “What is the religion of Muhammad (PBUH)?”  
I replied: It is the Qur’an. The basic aims of the  Qur’an are the six pillars of belief 

and the five pillars of Islam.  

In the second he asked: “What has it given to life and thought?”  
I  replied:  To  thought,  the  affirmation  of  Divine  unity;  to  life,  moderation  and  the 

middle way. My witnesses for this are  

Say: He is God, the One.46 * Therefore stand firm [in the Straight Way] as you 
are commanded.47 

In the third, he said: “What remedies has it for the present discord and turmoil?”  
I  replied:  The  prohibition  of  usury  and  interest  and  the  payment  of  Zakat.  My 

witnesses for this are these:  

God  will  deprive  usury  of  all  blessing.48  *  God  has  permitted  trade  and 
forbidden  usury.49  *  And  be  steadfast  in  prayer,  and  practise  regular  charity 
[Zakat].50  

In the fourth, he asked: “How does it look on man’s revolutions?”  
I replied: Labour, striving, are fundamental. Wealth should not be accumulated in the 

hands of tyrants, and held on to. My witnesses for this:  

Man  has  nothing  save  that  which  he  strives.51  *  Those  who  store  up  gold  and 
silver  and  do  not  spend  it  in  God’s  way,  announce  to  them  a  most  grievous 
penalty.52

About the Risale-i Nur, The Words, 
and their Author 

The Words forms the first part of the Risale-i Nur Collection, a Qur’anic commentary 
exceeding  five  thousand  pages  which  was  written  in  Turkish  by  one  of  the  most 
important Islamic scholars this century, Bediuzzaman Said Nursi,  in order to prove and 
explain the truths of belief to contemporary Muslims and modern man. In Bediuzzaman’s 
view, in the face of the assaults of materialist philosophy at the present time, the question 
which takes priority over all else  for Muslims  is  the saving and strengthening of belief. 
For it is only in belief in God that man’s true happiness and progress, and the cure for the 
wounds  caused  him  by  materialism  and  misguidance,  are  to  be  found.  Bediuzzaman 
devoted his life and learning to the achievement of these. 

Bediuzzaman  Said  Nursi  was  born  in  1877  in  eastern  Turkey  and  died  in  1960  in 
Urfa in Turkey. Readers may refer to his biography for details of his long and exemplary 
life,  which  spanned  the  last  decades  of  the  Ottoman  Empire,  its  collapse  after  the  First 
World War and the setting up of the Republic, then the twenty-five years of Republican 
Peoples’ Party rule, well-known for the measures taken against Islam, followed by the ten 
years  of  Democrat  rule,  when  conditions  eased  a  little  for  Bediuzzaman.  Here  we  shall 
mention  just  a  few  points  which  are  relevant  to  the  Risale-i  Nur  and  will  assist  in 
understanding The Words. With this same aim some general points about the Risale-i Nur 
are  included,  and  the  method,  which  is  particular  to  Bediuzzaman,  that  it  employs  for 
teaching the Qur’anic truths. 

Bediuzzaman  displayed  an  extraordinary  intelligence  and  ability  to  learn  from  an 
early  age,  completing  the  normal  course  of  medrese  (religious  school)  education  at  the 
early  age  of  fourteen,  when  he  obtained  his  diploma.  He  became  famous  for  both  his 
prodigious  memory  and  his  unbeaten  record  in  debating  with  other  religious  scholars. 
Another  characteristic  Bediuzzaman  displayed  from  an  early  age  was  an  instinctive 
dissatisfaction with the existing education system, which when older he  formulated  into 
comprehensive  proposals  for  its  reform.  The  heart  of  these  proposals  was  the  bringing 
together and joint teaching of the traditional religious sciences and the modern sciences, 
together  with  the  founding  of  a  university  in  the  Eastern  Provinces  of  the  Empire,  the 
Medresetü’z-Zehra,  where  this  and  his  other  proposals  would  be  put  into  practice.  In 
1907 his endeavours in this field took him to Istanbul where he presented a petition at the 
court  of  Sultan  Abdulhamid.  Although  subsequently  he  twice  received  funds  for  the 
construction  of  his  university,  and  its  foundations  were  laid  in  1913,  it  was  never 
completed due to war and the vicissitudes of the times. 

 

804 

Contrary  to  the  practice  of  religious  scholars  at  that  time,  Bediuzzaman  himself 
studied and mastered almost all the physical and mathematical sciences, and later studied 
philosophy,  for  he  believed  that  it  was  only  in  this  way  that  Islamic  theology  (kalam) 
could  be  renewed  and  successfully  answer  the  attacks  to  which  the  Qur’an  and  Islam 
were then subject. 

In  the  course  of  time,  the  physical  sciences  had  been  dropped  from  medrese 
education, which had contributed directly to the Ottoman decline relative to the advance 
of  the  West.  Now,  in  the  19th  and  early  20th  centuries,  Europe  had  gained  dominance 
over the Islamic world, and in efforts to extend its dominance, was attacking the Qur’an 
and Islam in the name of science and progress in particular, falsely claiming them to be 
incompatible.  Within  the  Empire  too  were  a  small  minority  who  favoured  adopting 
Western  philosophy  and  civilization.  Thus,  all  Bediuzzaman’s  endeavour  was  to  prove 
and demonstrate the falseness of these accusations, and that far from being incompatible 
with  science  and  progress,  the  Qur’an  was  the  source  of  true  progress  and  civilization, 
and  in  addition,  since  this  was  the  case,  Islam  would  dominate  the  future,  despite  its 
relative decline and regression at that time. 

The  years  up  to  the  end  of  the  First  World  War  were  the  final  decades  of  the 
Ottoman Empire and were, in the words of Bediuzzaman, the period of the ‘Old Said’. He 
strove  to  serve  the  cause  of  the  Empire  and  Islam  through  active  involvement  in  social 
life and the public domain. In the War, he commanded the militia forces on the Caucasian 
Front  against  the  invading  Russians,  for  which  he  as  later  awarded  a  War  Medal.  To 
maintain the  morale of his  men  he  himself disdained to enter the trenches  inspite of the 
constant shelling, and it was while withstanding the overwhelming assaults of the enemy 
that he wrote his celebrated Qur’anic commentary, Signs of Miraculousness (Isharat al-
I’jaz), dictating to a scribe while on horseback. Stating that the Qur’an encompasses the 
sciences  which  make  known  the  physical  world,  the  commentary  is  an  original  and 
important work which, in Bediuzzaman’s words, forms a model for the commentaries he 
hoped  would  be  written  in  the  future,  which  would  bring  together  the  religious  and 
modern sciences in the way he proposed. Bediuzzaman was taken prisoner in March 1916 
and held in Russia for two years before escaping in early 1918, and returning to Istanbul 
via Warsaw, Berlin, and Vienna.  

The defeat of the Ottomans saw the end of the Empire and its dismemberment, and 
the occupation of Istanbul and parts of Turkey by foreign forces. These bitter years saw 
also  the  transformation  of  the  Old  Said  into  the  New  Said,  the  second  main  period  of 
Bediuzzaman’s  life.  Despite  the  acclaim  he  received  and  services  he  performed  as  a 
member  of  the  Darü’l-Hikmeti’l-İslamiye,  and  combatting  the  British,  Bediuzzaman 
underwent a profound mental and spiritual change in the process of which he turned his 
back on the world, and realizing the  inadequacy  of the ‘human’ science and philosophy 
he  had  studied  as  a  means  of  reaching  the  truth,  took  the  revealed  Qur’an  as  his  “sole 
guide”.  In  recognition  of  his  services  to  the  Independence  Struggle,  Bediuzzaman  was 
invited to Ankara by Mustafa Kemal, but on arrival there, found that at the very time of 
the victory  

 

805 

of  the  Turks  and  Islam,  atheistic  ideas  were  being  propagated  among  the  Deputies  and 
officials,  and  many  were  lax  in  performing  their  religious  duties.  He  published  various 
works which successfully countered this. 

Remaining some eight months in Ankara, Bediuzzaman understood the way the new 
leaders were going to take, and that on the one hand he could not work alongside them, 
and on the other they were not to be combated in the realm of politics. So when offered 
various posts and benefits, he declined them and left Ankara for Van, where he withdrew 
into a life of worship and contemplation; he was seeking the best way to proceed. 

Within a short time, Bediuzzaman’s fears about the new regime began to be realized: 
the first steps were taken towards secularization and reducing the power of Islam within 
the state, and even its eradication from Turkish life. In early 1925 there was a rebellion in 
the east in which Bediuzzaman played  no part, but as a consequence of which was sent 
into exile in western Anatolia along with many hundreds of others. Thus unjustly began 
twenty-five years of exile, imprisonment, and unlawful oppression for Bediuzzaman. He 
was  sent  to  Barla,  a  tiny  village  in  the  mountains  of  Isparta  Province.  However,  the 
attempt to entirely  isolate and silence  him  had the reverse  effect,  for Bediuzzaman  was 
both  prepared  and  uniquely  qualified  to  face  the  new  challenge:  these  years  saw  the 
writing of the Risale-i Nur, which silently  spread and took root, combating  in the  most 
constructive way the attempt to uproot Islam, and the unbelief and materialist philosophy 
it was hoped to instil in the Muslim people of Turkey. 

Thus,  it  may  be  seen  from  this  that  the  Risale-i  Nur  was  written  to  expound  and 
explain  the  truths  of  the  Qur’an  and  belief  to  modern  man,  bewildered  as  he  is  by  the 
assaults of materialist philosophy, so that he may attain true and certain belief which will 
not be shaken by those assaults. In explaining these truths, the Risale-i Nur demonstrates 
the Qur’an’s superiority in every respect, and, although “in order not to cause aversion” 
philosophy’s  ideas  are  rarely  openly  stated,  is  in  one  respect  a  refutation  of  materialist 
Western philosophy. It should be stated here that Bediuzzaman was not anti-Western as 
such, -- indeed, he differentiated between harmful and beneficial philosophy, and hoped 
for  the  salvation  of  all  mankind  --  but  was  uncompromising  against  the  unbelief  and 
atheism which is opposed to religion; in recent times the weapon of this has mostly been 
materialist philosophies such as Positivism and Naturalism, which use science to justify 
their ideas. 

As the New Said, Bediuzzaman had immersed himself in the Qur’an, searching for a 
way to relate its truths to modern man. In Barla in his isolation he began to write treatises 
explaining and proving these truths, for now the  Qur’an  itself and  its truths were under 
direct attack. The first of these was on the Resurrection of the Dead, which  in a unique 
style, proves bodily Resurrection rationally, where even the greatest scholars previously 
had confessed their impotence. He described the method employed in this as consisting of 
three  stages:  first  God’s  existence  is  proved,  and  His  Names  and  attributes,  then  the 
Resurrection  of  the  Dead  is  “constructed”  on  these  and  proved.  Bediuzzaman  did  not 
ascribe  

 

806 

these  writings  to  himself,  but  said  they  proceeded  from  the  Qur’an  itself,  were  “rays 
shining out of from [its] truths.”  

Thus, rather than being a Qur’anic commentary which expounds all its verses giving 
the  immediate  reasons  for  their  revelation  and  the  apparent  meanings  of  the  words  and 
sentences,  the  Risale-i  Nur  is  what  is  known  as  a  manevi  tefsir,  or  commentary  which 
expounds the truths of the Qur’an, that is, explains and proves the verses containing the 
Qur’anic  teachings  about  the  essential  truths  of  belief.  For  there  are  various  sorts  of 
commentaries. The verses mostly expounded in the Risale-i Nur are those concerned with 
truths  of  belief  such  as  the  Divine  Names  and  attributes  and  the  Divine  activity  in  the 
universe, the Divine existence and Unity, resurrection, prophethood, Divine Determining 
or destiny, and man’s duties of worship. Bediuzzaman explains how the Qur’an addresses 
all  men  in  every  age  in  accordance  with  the  degree  of  their  understanding  and 
development;  it  has  a  face  that  looks to  each  age.  The  Risale-i  Nur,  then,  explains  that 
face of the Qur’an which  looks to this age.  We  shall  now  look at further aspects of the 
Risale-i Nur related to this point. 

In numerous of its verses, the Holy Qur’an invites man to observe the universe and 
reflect on the Divine activity within it; following just this method, Bediuzzaman provides 
proofs  and  explanations  for  the  truths  of  belief.  He  likens  the  universe  to  a  book,  and 
looking at it in the way shown by the Qur’an, that is, ‘reading’ it for its meaning, learns 
of  the  Divine  Names  and  attributes  and  other truths  of  belief.  The  book’s  purpose  is  to 
describe its Author and Maker; beings become evidences and signs to their Creator. Thus, 
an  important  element  in  the  way  of  the  Risale-i  Nur  is  reflection  or  contemplation 
(tefekkür), ‘reading’ the Book of the Universe in order to increase in knowledge of God 
and to obtain ‘certain, verified belief’ in all the truths of belief. 

Bediuzzaman demonstrates that the  irrefutable truths, such as Divine Unity, arrived 
at in this way are the only rational  and  logical explanation of the universe, and  making 
comparisons  with  Naturalist  and  Materialist  philosophy,  which  have  used  science’s 
findings  about  the  universe  to  deny  those  truths,  show  the  concepts  on  which  they  are 
based, such as causality and Nature, to be irrational and logically absurd. 

Indeed,  far  from  contradicting  them,  in  uncovering  the  order  and  working  of  the 
universe, science broadens and deepens knowledge of the truths of belief. In the Risale-i 
Nur  many  descriptions  of  the  Divine  activity  in  the  universe  are  looked  at  through  the 
eyes of science, and reflect Bediuzzaman’s knowledge of it. The Risale-i Nur shows that 
there is no contradiction or conflict between religion and science. 

In  addition,  all  these  matters  discussed  in  the  Risale-i  Nur  are  set  out  as  reasoned 
arguments and proved  according to logic.  All the  most  important of the truths of  belief 
are proved so clearly that even unbelievers can see their necessity. So too, inspired by the 
Qur’an, even the most profound and inaccessible truths are made accessible by means of 
comparisons, which bring them close to  

 

807 

the  understanding  like  telescopes,  so  that  they  are  readily  understandable  by  ordinary 
people and those with no previous knowledge of these questions. 

Another aspect of the Risale-i Nur related to the face of the Qur’an which  looks to 
this  age,  is  that  it  explains  everything  from  the  point  of  view  of  wisdom;  that  is,  as  is 
mentioned again below, it explains the purpose of everything. It considers things from the 
point of view of the Divine Name of All-Wise. 

Also,  following  this  method,  in  the  Risale-i  Nur  Bediuzzaman  solved  many 
mysteries of religion, such as bodily resurrection and Divine Determining and man’s will, 
and the riddle of the constant activity in the universe and the motion of particles, before 
which man, relying on his own intellect and philosophy, had been impotent. 

While  in  Barla,  Bediuzzaman  put  the  treatise  on  Resurrection  and  the  pieces  that 
followed  it  together  in  the  form  of  a  collection  and  gave  it  the  name  of  The  Words 
(Sözler).  The  pieces  were  thirty-two  in  number,  the  thirty-third  was  added  later.  The 
treatise on Resurrection  became the Tenth  Word. The  first nine are short, simple pieces 
describing  through  the  use  of  comparisons  the  virtues  and  benefits  of  belief  and  of 
worship  --  in  the  Risale-i  Nur  are  many  analyses  and  comparisons  of  guidance  and 
misguidance,  belief  and  unbelief,  which  point  out  the  grievous  pains  of  unbelief  and 
demonstrate that man’s true happiness and progress are only to be found in recognition of 
the world’s Owner and submission to Him.  

The  Words  that  follow  the  Tenth  comprise  numerous  subjects,  all  of  great 
importance;  among  them  are  the  Twelfth  and  Thirteenth  Words  and  their  comparisons 
between  the  Qur’an  and  philosophy;  the  explanations  of  Divine  Unity,  Oneness,  and 
God’s  closeness  to  us  and  our  distance  from  Him  in  the  Sixteenth  and  Thirty-Second 
Words;  the  proofs  of  the  Qur’an’s  miraculousness  in  the  Twenty-Fifth  Word,  which 
answers  in  particular  criticisms  made  by  atheists  and  scientists;  the  Twenty-Sixth  on 
Divine Determining and man’s faculty of will; the immortality of man’s spirit, the angels 
and  resurrection  in  the  Twenty-Ninth  Word;  and  the  nature  of  man’s  ego  and  the 
transformation of minute particles of the Thirtieth. Readers may refer to the Contents at 
the  beginning  of  the  book  for  details.  The  Words  was  followed  by  Mektubat,  Letters,  a 
collection  of  thirty-three  letters  of  varying  lengths  from  Bediuzzaman  to  his  students. 
And  this  was  followed  by  Lem’alar,  The  Flashes  Collection,  and  Şualar,  The  Rays 
Collection, which was completed in 1949. Included in these last two are Bediuzzaman’s 
defence  speeches  from  the  trials  at  Eskişehir  in  1935,  and  Afyon  in  1948-9.  Together 
with these are three collections of letters, one for each of Bediuzzaman’s main places of 
exile: Barla Lahikası, Kastamonu Lahikası, and Emirdağ Lahikası. 

The  way  the  Risale-i  Nur  was  written  and  disseminated  was  unique,  like  the  work 
itself. Bediuzzaman would dictate at speed to a scribe, who would write down the piece 
in  question  with  equal  speed;  the  actual  writing  was  very  quick.  Bediuzzaman  had  no 
books for reference and the writing of religious works was

of  course  forbidden.  They  were  all  written  therefore  in  the  mountains  and  out  in  the 
countryside.  Handwritten  copies  were  then  made,  these  were  secretly  copied  out  in  the 
houses  of  the  Risale-i  Nur  ‘Students’,  as  they  were  called,  and  passed  from  village  to 
village,  and  then  from  town  to town,  till  they  spread  throughout  Turkey.  Only  in  1946 
were Risale-i Nur Students able to obtain duplicating machines, while it was not till 1956 
that The Words and other collections were printed on modern presses in the new, Latin, 
script. The figure given for hand-written copies is 600,000. 

It may be seen from the above figure how the Risale-i Nur movement spread within 
Turkey, despite all efforts to stop it. After 1950, the period of what Bediuzzaman called 
‘the Third Said’, there was a great increase in the number of Students, particularly among 
the young and those who had been through the secular education system of the Republic. 
At the same time the number of Students outside Turkey increased. It is no exaggeration 
to say that with its conveying the Qur’anic message in a way that addresses and answers 
modern  man’s  needs,  the  Risale-i  Nur  played  a  major  role  in  keeping  alive  the  Islamic 
faith  in  Turkey  in  those  dark  days,  and  in  the  resurgence  of  Islam  that  has  occurred 
subsequently. 

Above all, the people of this age want reasonable answers to everything, they want to 
know “why?”  And although science has opened  up the universe  from the  minutest sub-
atomic particles to the obscurest, most distant reaches of space, it has remained impotent 
before  this  question;  it  has  been  unable  to  provide  the  answer  to  the  question  “why?” 
Whereas, taking its inspiration from the Divine Revelation of the Qur’an, the Risale-i Nur 
looks at things from the point of view of wisdom; it explains the wisdom, purposes and 
aims of all the various matters it discusses. It points out the purposes of everything, from 
the  universe  and  all  the  beings  in  it  and  all  the  realms  of  creation  to  man  and  his 
comprehensive disposition and his duties of worship; it answers the question “why?” In 
addition  it  provides  reasonable,  satisfying  answers  to  all  sorts  of  questions  to  do  with 
belief,  life,  man,  and existence; parts of  it  are even written  in the  form of question  and 
answer. One of the Risale-i Nur’s most important characteristics is this, which accounts 
for  its  unparalleled  success  in  saving  and  strengthening  the  belief  of  many  hundreds  of 
thousands,  and  probably  millions,  of  people  throughout  the  world.  Philosophy,  and 
science when in the service of philosophy, cast the world into ultimate meaninglessness 
and  man  into  a  mire  of  doubts,  fears,  and  ultimate  hopelessness.  In  explaining  the 
Qur’anic message for man in this modern age, the Risale-i Nur raises man out that dark 
hopelessness by illuminating with meaning both himself and the world in which he finds 
himself.
