VIRTUALLY ALL THOSE who have studied the circumstances of the 
Muslims in recent centuries agree that Ustad Bediuzzaman Said Nursi was 
an Islamic ﬁgure of great stature, of strong faith and complete sincerity; a 
person of great dignity who was cognizant of divine unity and its truths; one 
of  the  most  distinguished  men  of  his  time,  vastly  knowledgeable,  of  pen-
etrating thought, and a steadfast and perceptive caller to the way of Allah 
the Most High. From his youth he took it on himself to ﬁnd solutions for the 
afﬂictions suffered by the Muslims, and passed his life tirelessly striving to 
expound the teachings of Islam and explain its beliefs and doctrines. Sim-
ilarly,  he  refuted  invalid  thought  and  those  inconsistent  philosophies  that 
denied Islam and schemed against it due to the inability of Muslims to with-
stand the stormy intellectual onslaughts to which it had been exposed since 
the beginning of the 14th century of the Hijra; indeed, since before that. 

Nursi indeed undertook a difﬁcult task and his reward is with Allah the 
Most High alone, Who sees His righteous servants and faithful friends and 
the scholars who strive in His way and are true to His covenant, and fear not 
the criticisms of their accusers. 

This  present  book  is  truly  of  high  worth,  ﬁrmly  founded  and  contain-
ing unshakeable proofs. It demonstrates clearly the extraordinary power and 
effectiveness of Ustad Nursi and contains many examples of the precise and 
subtle meanings to be found in all his writings, and of his specialist knowl-
edge. His genius and talent were given to him by the Most High so that by 
means  of  them  and  his  knowledge,  and  profound  intuitive  understanding, 
and appropriate rational method he might penetrate His Word and discover 
the  truth,  and  assist  others  in  gaining  complete  certainty  concerning  the 
Qur’an’s miraculousness. Just as before him the learned scholars and men of 
eloquence had understood the importance of belief and that the Qur’an is the 
True Scripture revealed by the One All-Knowing of the Unseen to His Noble 
Messenger Muhammad, Upon whom be the best of peace and blessings, to 
set humanity on the path of truth and to illumine men’s vision with the light

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

of belief and the understanding and certainty to become sincere bondsmen 
of the Lord and Sustainer of all the worlds.

Ustad Nursi wanted to develop his unique gifts by studying the Islamic 
sciences, and ancient philosophy, and the humanities and modern sciences, 
as well as learning Arabic literature and rhetoric from the works of such mas-
ters as al-Jāḥiẓ, al-Zamakhsharī, al-Sakkākī, and especially the outstanding 
works on grammar and rhetoric of Imam ‘Abd al-Qāhir al-Jurjānī. For Nursi 
believed in his famous theory concerning the Qur’an’s composition ( n a ẓ m  ) 
and indicated his admiration for it in this work. 

The theory of its composition was not new; al-Jurjānī did not invent it 
and it was not without precedents. For al-Jāḥiẓ had turned his attention to 
it in his work N a ẓ m   a l - Q u r ’ ā n , and so had al-Wāsiṭī, in his I ‘ j ā z   a l - Q u r ’ ā n  
ﬁ   N a ẓ m i h i , and al-Bāqillānī, in I ‘ j ā z   a l - Q u r ’ ā n ; it was that al-Jurjānī, clari-
ﬁed it fully in respect of grammar and rhetoric and formulated a complete 
theory based on the absence of any disjunction between the words and their 
meaning and the form and its purport, and he established that the eloquence 
of the composition lay neither in individual words nor in detached meanings, 
but in what the words and phrases depicted. In consequence, he deﬁned the 
composition as “ some words being afﬁxed to others and some being placed 
because of others; that is, words being positioned as required by the science 
of grammar, in accordance with its rules and principles, and methods, with-
out deviation from them. ”

It seems to me that Ustad Nursi studied this theory of the Qur’an’s com-
position  thoroughly  and  then  it  became  clear  to  him  that  the  earlier  com-
mentators like al-Zamakhsharī, al-Rāzī, and Abū Su‘ūd had not attempted 
to apply it as a complete system treating all the suras, verses, and words one 
after the other, in all its details. So he wanted to emulate these great com-
mentators, but to compose a commentary in which the theory was applied in 
detail and comprehensively in respect of the structures and meanings, and 
the wording and its related sciences, both rational and intuitive, universal 
and particular. He relied on all these while disclosing the Qur’an’s system-
atic  ordering,  through  which  its  miraculousness  and  inimitability  become 
apparent. He disclosed too and elucidated the subtle qualities of the literary 
styles and devices of the Qur’an, which when it ﬁrst appeared opposed some 
current usages of Arabic, and astounded the Arab orators and silenced their 
eloquent masters. It confronted them with the challenge of its miraculous-
ness, and so it will till the Last Day.

It was not only to prove the Qur’an’s miraculousness in respect of elo-
quence and rhetoric that Nursi directed his efforts towards explicating the 

INTRODUCTION

theory of its composition; it was to penetrate into the meanings of the verses, 
for he wanted to expound them in detail in the light of reason in order to set 
forth the main beliefs of Islam and demonstrate their relations with the truths 
of existence. 

It is quite obvious to anyone who studies this book and its arrangement 
that  Nursi  wanted  to  write  a  complete  commentary  of  this  sort.  If  he  had 
been destined to do this, he would have produced a comprehensive commen-
tary treating both rhetoric and eloquence and laying emphasis on reason, and 
this would have been ﬁt to be his lifework. Certainly, it would have run to 
many volumes if he had continued to follow a method similar to that which 
we see here. 

Allah the Most High, however, appointed for him something better than 
that; something higher and greater: to present the Qur’an to Muslims with-
out distracting them with questions of rhetoric and the aspect of its miracu-
lousness that pertains to its words, for the difﬁculties of the times prevented 
investigation  of  its  ﬁner  questions,  which  could  be  understood  only  by  a 
very few scholars. If it had been otherwise, the great majority of Muslims 
would  have  been  unable  to  beneﬁt  from  his  unique  talents  and  unrivalled 
zeal  and  faith.  And  then  they  would  have  been  unequal  to  the  awesome 
ongoing  struggle  of  civilization  and  ideas,  despite  the  attacks  of  atheistic 
materialism, which was bit by bit inﬁltrating the life of Islam, and in many 
Muslim countries the politics, economics, society, culture, and science, and 
their proponents.

Consequently, Nursi did not continue after this volume; the circumstances 
of the time and place thrust him into the thick of the ﬁght, but with a new 
persona, called the New Said, the mark of which was calmness, gradualness, 
and holding out a constructive approach, and affecting the minds and hearts 
of Muslims without emotionalism, noisy agitation, confusion, confrontation, 
or striving for dominance. For the situation of Islam at the present time does 
not  support  such  things;  it  does  not  have  the  power  to  face  its  powerful 
enemies, both external and internal.

With its decisive clarity, brilliant learned sedateness, highly pleasurable 
manner of expression, and cogent rational proofs, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  replaces 
the former works the purpose of which was to prove aspects of the Qur’an’s 
miraculousness pertaining to its words, rhetoric, and reason in the light of 
its  composition.  For  now  the  Qur’an’s  enemies  are  not  qualiﬁed  to  chal-
lenge  its  eloquence  or  dispute  its  properties  related  to  its  inimitability,  or 
suras, verses, and words. So they have concentrated on launching a general 
assault  on  the  foundations  of  belief  and  the  principles  of  the  Shari‘a  and 
have attempted to shatter the moral order that the Qur’an brought.

10

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

Ustad Nursi perceived the tremendous changes brought about by the new 
struggle and he faced them with the truths of the Qur’an which he presented 
in the light of natural, rational logic and the sciences of his time.

Nursi was able to prove the Qur’an’s miraculous nature on the basis of 
the completed section of his commentary comprising this present work, and 
to  demonstrate  to  his  readers  and  students  that  it  is  easy  to  adhere  to  his 
rational, learned, pleasurable way. He saw that it was appropriate and suf-
ﬁcient, so he dedicated the rest of his life to the most pressing question, that 
of saving the belief of Muslims at the time of an awesome worldwide strug-
gle. As a result he wrote more than ten books and numerous treatises, which 
represented a new way, in order to inﬂict intellectual defeat on the atheistic 
enemies of Islam and those pursuing Westernization.

It would be an injustice to the present work to suggest that it contains 
nothing of the method Ustad Nursi developed for the new struggle; indeed, 
I can claim here from what I have learnt about his thought through reading 
his works of the later period, that there is no idea that he expounds, explains, 
and expands in those works but it is found in concise and essential form, or 
is elaborated, in this learned and substantial book, especially his presenting 
the fundamental Islamic beliefs in a contemporary scientiﬁc style. However 
in this book he was addressing his select students, combining the terminol-
ogy of classical k a l ā m  and the beginnings of his new method, which found 
its deﬁnitive form in the R i s a l e - i   N u r .

Perhaps it was because it is a true commentary on the Qur’an that the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  was given this name, and in truth Nursi persisted in expound-
ing the Qur’an and teaching its verses to Muslims until the ﬁnal moments 
of his life, so full of tribulations and sorrows, and knowledge and learning 
and calling others to adhere to Allah’s Book and the Sunna of His Prophet 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ).

The publication of this book in new form offers a fresh analysis of rheto-
ric and eloquence to those concerned with the critical study of contemporary 
works on the Qur’an’s miraculousness, inimitability, and eloquence - espe-
cially scholarly circles. They will ﬁnd expositions of the beliefs of Islam that 
utilize logical reasoning, augmented by the profound rational and scholarly 
discussions that Ustad Nursi appends to his analyses of the ﬁrst part of Sura 
al-Baqara. ( ... )

Reminder 

THE QUR’ANIC commentary S i g n s  o f  M i r a c u l o u s n e s s  ( I s h ā r ā t  a l - I ‘ j ā z  ) 
was written on the front in the ﬁrst year of the Great War when no books or 
sources were available. Apart from the War, there were four reasons for its 
being written extremely concisely. Sūra al-Fātiḥa and the ﬁrst half are more 
concise and succinct.

F i r s t l y :  The time did not permit elucidation; the Old Said expressed what 

he intended succinctly and brieﬂy.

S e c o n d l y :  He had in mind his students’ level of comprehension, and they 

were highly intelligent; he did not give thought to others understanding it.

T h i r d l y :  Because he was expounding the miraculousness of the Qur’an’s 
composition, which is of the greatest conciseness and subtlety, the Old Said 
wrote brieﬂy and to the point. But I have reread it now with the New Said’s 
eyes:  in  truth,  notwithstanding  all  the  Old  Said’s  faults,  with  its  elevated 
discussions this work is a masterpiece. Since when he wrote it he was in a 
constant state of readiness to fall in battle; and since his intention was pure 
and he wrote it in conformity with the rules of rhetoric and the sciences of 
Arabic, I [ now ] have been unable to refute any part of it. If Allah so wishes, 
He will accept the work as atonement for the Old Said’s sins and will raise 
up people who will understand it completely.

If obstacles had not arisen such as the First War, and other fascicles and 
letters  had  included  other  exegetical  truths  similar  to  the  miraculousness 
of the Qur’an’s composition – one aspect of its miraculousness – which is 
expounded  in  this  ﬁrst  volume,  a  ﬁne  comprehensive  commentary  would 
have been produced on the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition. Perhaps in the 
future, taking this partial commentary and the sixty-six, rather, one hundred 
and thirty parts of T h e   Wo r d s  ( S ö z l e r  ) and L e t t e r s  ( M e k t û b a t  ) as its source, 
a fortunate committee will write such a commentary, Allah willing.

The Author’s Note
to the Turkish Edition ( 1955 )

EXPLAINED below in three points are the reasons many minor points 
about the relations [ between the words in the light of the science ] of rheto-
ric, which will not be comprehensible and proﬁtable for many people, are 
mentioned  in  this  commentary  interspersed  among  the  detailed  explana-
tions of the twelve verses about dissemblers and two verses about unbe-
lievers, while in the rest of the verses the nature of disbelief and the doubts 
clung on to by the dissemblers are touched on only brieﬂy; and why the 
elucidation of the subtle indications and allusions of the Qur’an’s words 
is emphasized.

F i r s t   P o i n t :  Inspired by the Qur’anic teachings, the Old Said perceived 
that something would emerge at this time similar to the obdurate, unlet-
tered unbelievers of the early years of Islam and the dissembling members 
of  former  religions,  and  he  expounded  the  verses  about  the  dissemblers 
in  explanatory  and  detailed  fashion.  But  so  as  not  to  cloud  the  readers’ 
minds,  he  mentioned  only  brieﬂy  without  explaining  them  the  nature  of 
their  way  and  its  bases.  In  any  event,  contrary  to  other  ‘ulama,  it  is  the 
way of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  not to mention the doubts of opponents lest they 
taint the readers’ minds, and to give such answers that no place remains 
for suspicion or doubts. Like in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , so as not to confuse the 
readers’ minds, the Old Said only gave importance in this commentary to 
the indications and allusions of the words in respect of eloquence. 

S e c o n d   P o i n t :  Since the Qur’an’s letters are so valuable that the read-
ing of a single letter may yield ten, a hundred, a thousand, or thousands 
of merits and everlasting fruits of the hereafter, certainly the Old Said’s 
expounding in this commentary points as ﬁne as a hair or an atom related 
to the Qur’an’s words, is not wastefulness or irrelevant, but as valuable as 
the lashes are to the eye and atoms are to the eye’s pupil. He must have felt 
this, for the enemy’s bullets in the skirmishing lines in that terrible war did 
not confuse him or make him abandon his writing and thinking.

AUTHOR’S NOTE TO THE TURKISH EDITION

13

T h i r d  P o i n t :  The Turkish translation [ of the author’s brother, Abdülme-
cid ] 1 has not preserved the ﬂuency, eloquence, and extraordinary value of 
the Arabic, and it is also sometimes abbreviated. I had therefore intended 
not  to  publish  part  of  the  lengthy  discussion  about  the  dissemblers.  But 
since it is about the Qur’an, and even an atom about the Qur’an has high 
value, it will perhaps be useful for some people. Allah willing, if no obsta-
cles arise, the Arabic commentary will be published following this transla-
tion and will complete its deﬁciencies. Moreover, there are some wonder-
ful  instances  of  ‘coincidences’  2  in  the  Arabic  in  which  human  will  has 
not intervened. So as far as it is possible the attempt should be made to 
produce it similarly to that printed copy, so that those wonders, a sign of 
its acceptance, are not lost.

S a i d   N u r s i

1.  Abdülmecid ( ‘Abd al-Majīd ) was Said Nursi’s younger brother. He was a teacher 
of the religious sciences, then a mufti, and translated parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  in Arabic, 
and I s h ā r ā t   a l - I ‘ j ā z  and a l - M a t h n a w ī   a l - ‘ A r a b ī   a l - N ū r ī  ( M e s n e v î - i   N û r i y e  ) from Arabic 
into Turkish. He died in 1967. ( Tr. )

letters or words in lines or patterns on one or several pages. ( Tr. )

Statement of Purpose 

THE  QUR’AN  OF  MIGHTY  STATURE  is  an  all-embracing  divine 
speech and universal dominical address delivered from the Sublime Throne 
that addresses all the classes, nations, and members of mankind in every age. 
So also, and especially at this time, does it encompass many sciences and 
branches of learning related to the physical aspects of the world, knowledge 
of which is beyond the capacity of a single person or small group. There-
fore, a commentary issuing from the understanding and imaginative power 
of one person the scope of whose comprehension is very narrow with regard 
to time, place, and specialization, cannot truly expound the Qur’an, for he 
cannot be acquainted with and be an expert in all the exact sciences and the 
branches of knowledge concerned with the spiritual and material states of 
nations and peoples, all of whom the Qur’an addresses. And he cannot be 
free of bias towards his own profession and discipline that he might expli-
cate  the  truths  of  the  Qur’an  impartially.  Also,  a  person’s  understanding 
is peculiar to him and he may not call on others to accept it – unless it is 
afﬁrmed by a consensus of some sort. And his ﬁndings [ and judgements ] 
related to actions are binding only on himself and no one else, again unless 
approved by a consensus.

In consequence of this, a commentary should be written after minute 
studies and researches by an elevated committee of authoritative scholars 
each of whom is a specialist in a number of sciences, proving the Qur’an’s 
subtle  meanings  and  its  ﬁne  points  to  be  found  scattered  through  other 
commentaries,  and  its  truths,  which  become  manifest  in  time  due  to  the 
discoveries of science. Just as its legal ordinances have to be ordered and 
regulated, not according to the thought of a single person, but by such a 
committee after being scrutinized and studied minutely by it. Thus, gain-
ing the trust and conﬁdence of the mass of the people, the committee will 
implicitly  assume  responsibility  for  them  and  be  an  authoritative  source 
for the Muslim community.

Indeed, one who expounds the Qur’an should possess high intelligence, 
penetrating independent judgement, and a high degree of sainthood. But in 
these times in particular, such conditions can be met only by the brilliant  
collective  personality  born  of  the  co-operation  of  an  elevated,  esteemed 

14

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

15

committee and the uniting of the minds of its members, of their assistance 
for one another and harmony of spirit, and of their freedom of thought, and, 
being free of bias, of their complete sincerity. Only a collective personality 
such as this can expound the Qur’an. For in accordance with the rule, “ What 
is not found in the parts is present in the whole, ” these qualities which are 
not to be found in any one person are present in the group.

While awaiting, as I had for many years, the appearance of such a com-
mittee, I had a premonition that we were on the eve of a terrible earthquake 
that would lay waste the country. 1 And so, in accordance with the rule, “ It 
is  not  permissible  to  abandon  a  thing  completely  even  if  it  is  not  wholly 
obtained,  ”  despite  my  impotence,  faults,  and  difﬁcult  style  of  writing,  I 
started to set down on my own some of the Qur’an’s truths and some indica-
tions of the miraculous inimitability of its composition. Then, on the Great 
War breaking out I found myself in the mountains and valleys of Erzurum 
and Pasinler. Whenever the opportunity arose while I was performing the 
duty of jihad in the midst of those tumultuous conditions, I used to write 
what occurred to my heart in phrases that did not always match one another. 
Since it was not possible to have any books or commentaries to refer to, what 
I wrote consisted only of what occurred to my heart. If these inspirations 
of  mine  are  appropriate  for  a  commentary,  light  of  lights;  if  they  contain 
contradictory aspects, these can be referred to my own defects. Certainly, 
there are places in need of correction, but since it was written with complete 
sincerity in the front lines of war among the slain, like it is not permissible 
to change the clothes and wash off blood of martyrs, I could not permit the 
ripped phrases in which it was clothed to be changed; my heart would not 
consent to it. And now it does not consent to it, for now at this time, I cannot 
ﬁnd that utter sincerity and purity of heart.

Furthermore, I did not write this work of mine, called S i g n s   o f   M i r a c u -
l o u s n e s s  ( I s h ā r ā t   a l - I ‘ j ā z  ), with the intention of its being a true commen-
tary;  only,  in  the  event  of  its  being  well  received,  I  wrote  it  as  a  model 
and source for a commentary to be written in the future, that treated a few 
aspects of Qur’anic exegesis. My eagerness drove me to what was beyond 
my power; if it is found acceptable it will give me the courage to continue. 2

What is the Qur’an? How is it deﬁned? 

THE QUR’AN is the pre-eternal translation of the mighty book of the 
universe;  the  post-eternal  interpreter  of  the  various  tongues  reciting  the 
verses of creation; the commentator of the book of the Worlds of the Seen 
and the Unseen; the revealer of the treasuries of the divine names hidden in 
the heavens and on the earth; the key to the truths concealed beneath the lines 
of events; the tongue of the Unseen World in the Manifest World; the treas-
ury of the post-eternal favours of the Most Merciful and of the pre-eternal 
addresses of that Most Holy One, that come from the World of the Unseen 
beyond the veil of this Manifest World; it is the sun, foundation, and plan of 
the spiritual world of Islam; the sacred map of the worlds of the hereafter; 
the expounding word, lucid exposition, decisive proof, and clear interpreter 
of the divine essence, attributes, names, and functions; it is the instructor of 
the world of humanity; the light and water of Islam, the macroanthropos; the 
true wisdom of humankind; and the true guide and leader urging humanity 
to prosperity and happiness; it is both a book of law, and a book of prayer, 
and a book of wisdom, and a book of worship, and a book of command and 
summons, and a book of invocation, and a book of thought; it is a unique, 
comprehensive sacred book comprising many books to which recourse may 
be had for the needs of all humankind; it is a revealed scripture resembling a 
sacred library that offers treatises suitable for the various ways and different 
paths of all the saints and the veracious ones and the wise and the learned, 
which is appropriate for the illuminations of each way and enlightens it, and 
is suitable for the course of each path and depicts it.

Since  the  Qur’an  has  come  from  the  Sublime  Throne  and  the  greatest 
name, and from the highest degree of each name, it is Allah’s Word in regard 
to  His  being  Lord  and  Sustainer  ( R a b b  )  of  all  the  worlds;  it  is  a  divine 
decree through His title of Allah of All Beings; it is an address in the name 
of the Creator of the Heavens and the Earth; it is a conversation in respect of 
absolute dominicality ( r u b û b i y e t  ); it is a pre-eternal discourse on account 
of universal divine sovereignty; it is a notebook of the favours of the Most 
Merciful from the point of view of all-embracing, all-encompassing divine 
mercy; it is a collection of addresses at the start of which are certain ciphers 
related  to  the  tremendousness  of  divine  majesty;  and  through  its  descent 
from the comprehensiveness of the greatest name, it is a holy scripture full 
of wisdom that looks to and inspects all sides of the Sublime Throne.

WHAT IS THE QUR’AN? HOW IS IT DEFINED?

17

It  is  because  of  this  mystery  that  with  complete  ﬁtness  the  title  of  the 
Word of Allah has been given to the Qur’an, and is always given. After the 
Qur’an comes the level of the books and scriptures of the other prophets. 
However,  those  other  innumerable  divine  words  are  each  in  the  form  of 
inspiration  made  manifest  through  a  special  regard,  a  partial  title,  a  par-
ticular  manifestation,  a  speciﬁc  name,  a  special  dominicality,  a  particular 
sovereignty, a special mercy. The inspirations of the angels and man and the 
animals vary greatly with regard to universality and particularity.

The Qur’an is a revealed scripture which contains in summary the books 
of  all  the  prophets,  whose  times  were  all  different,  the  writings  of  all  the 
saints, whose paths are all different, and the works of all the puriﬁed schol-
ars, whose ways are all different. Its six aspects are all brilliant and free of 
the darkness of doubts and scepticism; its point of support is certain heav-
enly revelation and the pre-eternal Word; its aim and goal is self-evidently 
eternal happiness; its inner aspect is clearly pure guidance; its upper aspect 
is necessarily the lights of belief; its lower aspect is undeniably evidence and 
proof; its right aspect is evidently the surrender of the heart and conscience; 
its left aspect is manifestly the subjugation of the reason and intellect; its 
fruit is indisputably the mercy of the Most Merciful and the realm of Para-
dise; and its rank and desirability are assuredly accepted by the angels and 
man and the jinn.

SO  KNOW  ﬁ r s t l y   that  our  aim  from  these  indications,  is  a  commen-
tary on a number of the symbols of the Qur’an’s ordering and composition 
( n a ẓ m  ), for [ one aspect of ] its miraculousness is manifested in its composi-
tion. Indeed, the embroidery of its composition is its most brilliant [ form of ] 
miraculousness. 

And  know  s e c o n d l y   that  the  fundamental  aims  of  the  Qur’an  and  its 
essential  elements  are  fourfold:  divine  unity  ( a l - t a w ḥ ī d  ),  propheth-
ood  ( a l - n u b ū w w a  ),  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  ( a l - ḥ a s h r  ),  and  justice 
( a l - ‘ a d ā l a  ).  1 For when mankind, like a successive caravan and proces-
sion, departs from the valleys of the past and its lands, travels in the deserts 
of existence and life and proceeds towards the heights of the future, fac-
ing towards its  gardens, events shake men and the universe turns its face 
towards  them.  It  is  as  though  the  government  of  creation  sends  natural 
philosophy [ or science ] ( f a n n   a l - ḥ i k m a  ) to interrogate and question them, 
saying: “ O mankind! Where are you from? Where are you going? What 
are you doing? Who is your ruler? And who is your spokesman? ” At one 
time  during  this  conversation  there  stood  up  one  from  among  mankind 
– as did those like him of the prophets with authority – the lord of mankind 

1.    In  the Turkish  translation  ( 1955 ),  the  author  added  “ worship  ( i b â d e t  ) ”  to  the 

fourth aim, making it “ justice and worship. ”

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

Muhammad  al-Hashimi  ( UWBP ),  and  said  through  the  tongue  of  the 
Qur’an: “ O philosophy! All of us beings we come forth emerging by the 
power of the Pre-Eternal Ruler from the darkness of non-existence to the 
light of existence, and all of us, we sons of Adam, are sent as ofﬁcials priv-
ileged above our brother creatures in bearing the Trust; we are on our way, 
journeying on the road of the resurrection towards eternal felicity; and we 
are busy in this world in preparation of that felicity and the development 
of  the  potentialities  that  are  our  capital;  and  I  am  their  master  and  their 
spokesman. Here it is before you, my manifesto, which is the word of the 
Pre-Eternal Ruler on which sparkles the stamp of miraculousness. ” Thus, 
the answerer of these questions, the correct answer, is none other than the 
Qur’an, that book – the answer is those four fundamental principles.

Just as the four aims are seen in the whole of the Qur’an, so they are man-
ifested in every sura; indeed, they are hinted at in every phrase or alluded to 
in every word; because each part is like a mirror to the whole ascending, just 
as the whole is seen in each part successively. And by this point I mean that 
by this participation of the part ( a l - j u z ’  ) in the whole ( a l - k u l l  ), the Qur’an 
is made known as a totality ( a l - k u l l ī  ) with constituent parts ( a l - j u z ’ i y y ā t  ). 1
• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Show me these four aims in   " !    and ' &
Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Since " !  was revealed in order to instruct [ the 
Most High’s ] servants, ‘Say!’  ْلُ(cid:162) is implicit in it and essentially it is implied 
by [ all ] the words of the Qur’an. So according to this, there is in ‘Say!’  ْلُ(cid:162) 
an indication to prophethood; and in " ! a sign to the Godhead; and in 
the preﬁxing of [ the preposition ] “ b i -  ” of " ! a sign to divine unity; 
2 and in + an allusion to the order [ of the universe, and therefore to ] 
justice and beneﬁcence; and in , a hint at the resurrection of the dead. 
Likewise, in ' & is a pointer to the Godhead; and in the ل of speci-
ﬁcation ( the “ l i -  ” of '  ) a sign to divine unity. And in ) ( 
is an allusion to justice, and also to prophethood, for the prophets are the 
educators of humankind. And in 0 / . is an explicit statement of 

1.   That  is,  every  part  of  the  Qur’an  is  a  whole  Qur’an.  See,  Nursi,  İ ş â r â t ü ’ l - İ ’ c a z

resurrection.  Likewise,  the  shell  of X W V  1  contains  these 
pearls [ of the Qur’an’s four main aims ]. This is an example, so carry on in 
the same way.

" !  is like the sun, which illumines itself as well as others and is 
self-sufﬁcient. Thus, the “ I n  ( b i -  ) ” is related to the verb that is implicit in 
its meaning; that is,  ُن(cid:193) ِ(cid:151)َ(cid:99) ْ(cid:126)َا or the meaning usually associated with it; that 
ّ(cid:175)َ(cid:193)َ(cid:98)َا Or it is related to the implicit  ْلُ(cid:162) , which necessitates a subsequent 
is,  ُن َ
‘recite!’ or ْاَرْ(cid:162)ِا to denote sincerity and divine unity. 2

As for   مـ ْ(cid:126)ِا  know that Allah has names pertaining to His essence, and 
names  pertaining  to  various  sorts  of  action,  such  as  Forgiving,  Provider, 
Giver of Life, and Dealer of Death, and so on. They are various and numer-
ous because of the multiplicity of the relations of His pre-eternal power with 
the different kinds of beings. Therefore, " ! is an invocation, seeking 
the agency and connection of divine power, that its connection might be a 
spirit for man and a help for him in his actions.

ّ(cid:195)َا  the  proper  name  of  Allah  is  a  comprehensive  summary  of  all  the 
attributes of perfection, for it implies the Essence, unlike other proper nouns, 
in which there is no necessary implication of attributes.
“ T h e   M o s t   M e r c i f u l ,   t h e   A l l - C o m p a s s i o n a t e   , +  ” 

The positioning ( n a ẓ m  ): just as divine glory ( j a l ā l  ) and its concomi-
ّ(cid:195)َا so too divine beauty 
tants are manifested in sequence from the name of  ُ
( j a m ā l  ) and its concomitants appear in sequence from , + . Since 
Glory and Beauty are two sources, there appear in sequence from them by 
virtue of their being manifest in every world, branches like command and 
prohibition,  reward  and  punishment,  inducement  and  threat,  gloriﬁcation 
and praise, and fear and hope, and so on.

Also, just as the name of   ُ

ّ(cid:195)َا indicates the attributes that are identical 
with His Essence and indicate His freedom from defect ( a l - ṣ i f ā t   a l - ‘ a y n i y y a  
w a ’ l - t a n z ī h i y y a  ),  so ,  hints  at  the  attributes  that  are  other  than  His 

1.  Sura 108, Sūra al-Kawthar, one of the shortest of the Qur’an’s suras.
2.  Related to and following the genitive construction, these implied verbs denote re-
striction, which in turn denotes sincerity and divine unity. See, Nursi, İ ş â r â t ü ’ l - İ ’ c a z  [ Ab-
dülmecid ], 24.

Essence  and  pertain  to  action  ( a l - ṣ i f ā t   a l - g h a y r i y y a   a l - ﬁ ‘ l i y y a  ).  As  for 
+  it  indicates  the  seven  attributes  that  are  neither  identical  with  nor 
other than His Essence ( l ā   ‘ a y n   w a   l ā   g h a y r  ), since it has the meaning of 
the Provider ( a l - R a z z ā q  ) and consists of the bestowal of continuance. For 
continuance is the repetition of existence; and existence necessitates a dis-
tinguishing  attribute,  a  specifying  attribute,  and  an  effectuating  attribute, 
and these are Knowledge, Will, and Power. Continuance, which is the result 
of the bestowal of sustenance, entails the certainty of Sight, Hearing, and 
Speech, for necessarily the Provider has sight in order to see the need of the 
recipient of providence if he does not seek it; and He has hearing in order to 
hear the recipient’s word when he asks; and He has speech in order to speak 
through intermediaries, when there are some. And these six necessitate the 
seventh, which is Life.

•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :   The  precedence  of   +  which  indicates  great 
bounties, over  , which indicates minute bounties, is the art of descend-
ing from great to small ( ṣ a n ‘ a t   a l - t a d a l l ī  ). While eloquence ( a l - b a l ā g h a  ) 
requires an ascent from lowest to highest ( ṣ a n ‘ a t   a l - t a r a q q ī  )?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  The latter is appended to the former in order to com-
plete it, like eyebrows complete the eyes and the bridle the horse. Similarly, 
when the great depends on the minute the minute gains the superiority, like 
the key to the lock and the tongue to the spirit. Furthermore, this context ( lit. 
station – a l - m a q ā m  ) being one of drawing attention to the bounties [ rather 
than enumerating them or evoking gratitude for them ], to alert [ the reader to 
this fact since it is ] less obvious is more appropriate. So the art of descend-
ing from great to small when ( lit. in the context of ) enumerating bounties 
and evoking gratitude for them becomes the art of ascending from small to 
great when alerting [ the mind to them ] and pointing them out. 

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Like such concepts as tender-heartedness, Merciful 
and Compassionate cannot be used in reference to the Most High. If what is 
meant by these is their results, which here would be the bestowal of bounty, 
what is the reason for such ﬁgures of speech ( a l - m a j ā z  )? 

Yo u   w o u l d   b e  

t o l d :   The  reason  is  that  of  the  allegorical  verses 
( a l - m u t a s h ā b i h ā t  ):  1  it  is  divine  condescension  to  human  intellects;  mak-
ing something familiar to the mind and inducing it to understand, like one

speaks to a child in terms he is accustomed to and familiar with. The mass of 
the people gather their information from their senses and they do not look at 
sheer truths except in the mirror of what they imagine them to be and from 
the point of view of that to which they are accustomed. Moreover, the aim 
of the phrase is to convey the meaning, and this is not achieved except by 
affecting the heart and emotions, and by clothing the truth in a style familiar 
to the one addressed; in this way his heart is prepared to accept it.
“ [ A l l  ] p r a i s e  &  ” 
Its positioning as regards what precedes it

Since + and , indicate the [ divine ] bounties and favours, they 
necessitate  praise.  Furthermore, ' &  is  repeated  in  four  suras  in  the 
Qur’an,  1 each repetition referring to one of the principal bounties, which 
are the ﬁrst creation and the continuation of it, and the last creation and its 
ensuing continuation. 

Its positioning here

' &  being  put  at  the  opening  of  the  Fātiḥa  of  the  Qur’an  is  like 
putting the conception of the Qur’an’s ultimate purpose in the forefront of 
the brain, for praise is a concise form of worship, which is the result of crea-
tion, and of knowledge of Allah, which is the purpose and aim of the uni-
verse. So to mention praise is to conceive of the Qur’an’s ultimate purpose. 
Indeed, Allah ( May He be exalted and gloriﬁed ) says: 

( 51:56 )  H G F E D C
Furthermore, there is the well-known meaning of praise: the display of 

the attributes of perfection. 

H o w   t h i s   i s   a c h i e v e d :  Allah created man and made him a comprehen-
sive summary of the universe and an index of the book of the world, which 
comprises  eighteen  thousand  worlds,  and  lodged  in  his  essence  a  sample 
from each, in which is manifested one of His names. If man spends all of 
what is bestowed on him in the way of that for which he was created, for  the 
purpose of offering thanks, a sort of praise, and obeying the Shari‘a, which 
removes the rust of nature, each of those samples becomes a map [ illuminat-
ing ] his world, and a mirror reﬂecting it and the attribute manifested in it and 
the name it displays. In this way, with both spirit and body, man becomes 
a  summary  of  the  worlds  of  the  seen  and  unseen,  and  manifests  what  is 

1.  Suras al-An‘ām, al-Kahf, Sabā’, al-Fāṭir.

24

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

manifested  in  them.  Through  offering  praise  he  becomes  both  a  place  of 
demonstration  and  a  demonstrator  of  the  attributes  of  perfection.  This  is 
implied by what M u ḥ y ī   a l - D ī n   a l - ‘ A r a b ī  1 said in explanation of the Hadith: 
ىِ(cid:178)وُ(cid:158)ِرْ(cid:151)َ(cid:193)ِ(cid:170)  َقْ(cid:171)َ(cid:115)ْ(cid:170)ا  ُتْ(cid:163)َ(cid:171)َ(cid:115)َ(cid:158) اً
ّ(cid:193)ِ(cid:159)ْ(cid:115)َ(cid:174) اًزْ(cid:179)ﯬﯦ  ُتْ(cid:179)ـُ(cid:166) 2 That is, I created creation to be a 
mirror in which I might observe My beauty.

'That is, praise ( ḥ a m d  ) is particular to and ﬁtting only for the Most Pure 

and Holy Essence, who although speciﬁed is described by the concept of the 
Necessarily Existent One. For sometimes something speciﬁc may be thought 
of in general terms. The letter ل ( the l i -  of '     ) here is dependent on the verb 
implied by its meaning, as though it had absorbed the verb’s meaning.3 In 
the l ā m  is also a sign to sincerity and divine unity.

(That is, He who raises and sustains the universe with all its component 

parts, each of which is a world like the greater world, with all its atoms, like 
its stars dispersed, in motion, in order.

Know that Allah ( May His glory be exalted ) appointed for everything a 
point of perfection and deposited in each an inclination towards it, as though 
commanding  it  through  this  inclination  to  set  out  for  the  point  of  perfec-
tion. In its journey each thing stands in need of what will help it and what 
will repulse the things that hinder it, and this is the sustaining of Allah. If 
you  study  the  universe,  you  will  see  that  it  resembles  human  groups  and 
nations, with each thing individually and collectively employed in the duties 
its  Maker  has  appointed  for  it,  striving  diligently,  obeying  the  laws  of  its 
Creator. How surprising therefore is man, in his being an exception!

all the components of the world as living and rational, speaking through the 
tongue of disposition. For the world ( ‘ ā l a m  ) is so-called because through 
it the Maker is known ( y u ‘ l a m  ), and it bears witness to Him and points to 
Him.  Thus,  the  raising  and  sustaining  of  beings  and  their  making  known 
their Maker indicate, like the prostration, that they are as though conscious.

That is, the day of resurrection and requital. 
The positioning: it is as though it is the result of what precedes it, for 
mercy ( r a ḥ m a  ) is one of the proofs of resurrection and eternal felicity. For 
mercy can only be mercy, and bounty can only be bounty when the Resur-
rection arrives and eternal felicity comes about. Otherwise, on thinking of 
eternal separation, intelligence, which is one of the greatest bounties, would 
be  a  calamity  for  mankind,  and  affection  and  compassion,  which  are  the 
most reﬁned kinds of mercy, would be transformed into severe pain.

be manifested clearly and transparently. Then all things will see and know 
their Lord and Maker without intermediary.

And in the term / is an allusion to one of the conjectural signs of the 
resurrection, related to the evident correspondence between a day and a year, 
and the life of man and the cycle of the earth. So it is between the hands of a 
clock that count the seconds, the minutes, the hours, and the days. Thus, the 
person who sees that one hand has completed its revolution will surmise that 
the others will complete their revolutions too, even if with delay. Similarly, 
the person who sees the repeated resurrections of the species in the examples 
of the day and the year will surmise that the spring of eternal felicity will be 
born on the morning of the Day of Resurrection for mankind, one individual 
of which is like a species.

What is meant by 0 is either requital, that is, the day of requital for 
good deeds and bad, or of the truths of religion; that is, the day they will 
rise and be totally manifested, and the sphere of belief will prevail over the 
sphere of causes. For by relating causes to effects, Allah has deposited an 
order in the universe through His will, and obliged man through his nature, 
illusions,  and  imagination,  to  comply  with  the  order  and  be  bound  to  it. 
Moreover, He directed all things towards Himself and is far above the effect 
of the causes in His dominions ( m u l k  ). He charged man in belief and faith, 
to comply with this sphere with his conscience and his spirit, and be bound 
to it. For in this world, the sphere of causes predominates over the sphere 
of belief, while in the next world the truths of belief will be manifested as 
supreme over the sphere of causes.

Know  too  that  each  of  the  two  spheres  has  its  appointed  position  and 
particular rules, so each should be given its due. Thus, the person who looks 
from the position of the causal world with his nature, delusions, and imagi-
nation and the criteria of causes towards the sphere of belief is forced to be 
Mu‘tazilite,  while  a  person  who  looks  from  the  position  of  belief  and  its 
criteria with his spirit and conscience towards the sphere of causes will end 
up displaying a lazy sort of trust and obstinate opposition to the will of the 
Orderer. 1

Two points may be made concerning the letter k ā f  [ in the detached accu-

sative pronoun 2     ]:

1.  This refers to the Jabriyya ( Predestinationists ).

VERSE 5 – CONCERNING WORSHIP

T h e   ﬁ r s t  of them is that by reason of the direct form of address [ that is, 
the change to the second person after the use of the third ], 1 the pronominal 
sufﬁx “ - k a   –   y o u  ” implies the attributes of perfection mentioned previously. 
For the previous mention [ of the attributes ] one after the other stimulates 
the brain, preparing it, ﬁlling it with enthusiasm, and directing the attention 
to the One described. Thus, “ Yo u   a l o n e  2  ” means “ O You Who is quali-
ﬁed by these attributes! ”
T h e   s e c o n d   p o i n t :  the use of the second person indicates that according 
to the science of rhetoric the meanings should be dwelt on, for then it will 
be read as it was revealed, and this will lead the person to make the address 
naturally  and  enthusiastically.  Hence,  2  implies  compliance  with  [ the 
Hadith ]  ُهاَرَ(cid:98)

The use of the ﬁrst person plural in 3 has three aspects:  ﬁ r s t l y , we 
worship, all of us members and atoms of the microcosm that is myself, by 
offering the thanks expressed by all these members and atoms complying 
with that which they have been commanded. S e c o n d l y , all of us monothe-
ists, we worship You through obedience to your Shari‘a. And t h i r d l y , all of 
us beings, we submit totally to your Supreme Shari‘a of Creation, and we 
prostrate in bewilderment and love at the throne of your awesomeness and 
power.

Know too that the precedence of  2 infers sincerity, the essence of wor-
ship, while the use of the second person indicates the  reason for worship, for 
the One qualiﬁed by these attributes, which call for direct address, is worthy 
of worship.

the  most  important  of  which  is  worship.  The 2  is  repeated  to  increase 
the pleasure of the address and sense of presence; and because the station 
( m a q ā m  ) of meeting face to face is higher and more exalted than the station 
of proof [ in the absence of the one addressed ]; and because presence calls 
for truthfulness and not for lying; and because worship and the seeking of 
help are two different, independent aims.

The positioning of 5 and  3 you should understand that the 
relationship between them resembles the relationship of wages with service. 
For worship is Allah’s right over His bondsman [ worship is a form of serv-
ice ], and the help is His bountiful bestowal [ or reward ].

In the exclusivity implied by the precedence of  2 is an indication to 
the  fact  that  through  the  noble  relation  that  is  worship  and  the  service  of 
Allah, the bondsman is raised up from subjection to causes and intermediar-
ies; indeed, the causes become his servants, and since he recognizes the One 
alone, [ for him ] the sphere of belief and conscience will come to dominate, 
as mentioned. The person who is not truly Allah’s servant becomes a slave 
to causes and is abased by intermediaries. However, while in the sphere of 
causes the bondsman should not neglect causes altogether lest he comes to 
rebel against the order established by divine wisdom and will, for misplaced 
reliance on Allah while in the sphere of causes is laziness, as discussed. This 
is like the relationship of the antecedent and the aim, for help and grace are 
the preliminaries of worship.

7
The positioning: it is the bondsman’s reply to Allah’s question, as if He 
asks: “ What aim is closest to your heart? ” and the bondsman replies:  7 
Know that because of its several levels of meaning, it is as if  7 is 
derived from the four sources [ or verbal nouns – m a ṣ d a r  ] of the act of guid-
ance. For its recipients may be divided into those who are guided, those who 
seek guidance, and those who seek increase in guidance. So  7 means: 
make us ﬁrm in guidance if we are a society; increase us in guidance if we 
are a community; make us successful in guidance if we are a tribe; give us 
guidance if we are a group.

Also, according to the “ W h o   g i v e s   u n t o   e v e r y   t h i n g   [   t h a t   e x i s t s   ]   i t s   t r u e

Know that the Straight Path is justice, consisting of the blending and sum-
mary of wisdom ( ḥ i k m a  ), chastity ( ‘ i f f a  ), and courage ( s h a j ā ‘ a  ), which are 
the mean or middle way of the three degrees of man’s three powers.

To explain: when Allah ( May He be exalted and gloriﬁed! ) housed spirit 
( r ū ḥ  ) in man’s body, which is changing, needy, and exposed to dangers, He 
deposited three powers in it to ensure its continued existence.

T h e   F i r s t :  The power of animal appetites to attract beneﬁts.
T h e  S e c o n d :  The power of savage passion to repulse harmful and destruc-

T h e   T h i r d :  The power of angelic intellect to distinguish between beneﬁt 

tive things.

and harm.

However, since His wisdom necessitated that humanity should achieve 
perfection through the mystery of competition, Allah placed no innate limi-
tation on these powers, as He did on those of other living beings. He did 
however limit them through the Shari‘a, for it prohibits excess ( i f r ā ṭ  ) and 
deﬁciency  ( t a f r ī ṭ  )  and  enjoins  the  middle  way  ( w a s a ṭ  ).  This  is  what  is 
inferred by the verse ( 11:112 ) [ Z Y In the absence of any innate 
limitation, three degrees arise in the three powers: the degree of deﬁciency, 
which is negligence; the degree of superabundance, which is excess; and the 
middle way, which is justice. 

Thus, deﬁciency in the power of intellect is stupidity and foolishness, and 
its excess, perﬁdious deception and over-meticulousness in trivialities, and 
its middle way is wisdom. 

  ( 2:269 )Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ »

Know  that  just  as  the  power  varies  in  these  degrees,  so  does  each  of 
its branches vary. For example, in the question of the creation of actions, 
the  middle  way  is  that  of  the  Sunni  School  between  the  Jabriyya  and  the 
Mu‘tazila, and in the question of doctrine, the school of divine unity is the 
middle way between the denial of the divine attributes ( t a ‘ ṭ ī l  ) and anthro-
pomorphism ( t a s h b ī h  ). You can make further examples in the same way.

30

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

Deﬁciency in the power of animal appetites is apathy and want of appe-
tite, while its excess is proﬂigacy, which is to desire whatever is encountered 
whether lawful or unlawful. Its middle way is uprightness, which is desiring 
what is licit and shunning what is illicit. You may apply the principle applied 
to this power to any of its branches, such as eating, drinking, dressing, and 
so on.

Deﬁciency in the power of savage passion is cowardice, that is, fear of 
what is not to be feared and delusive imagining. Its excess is uncontrolled 
anger, which is the progenitor of despotism, domination, and tyranny. And 
its middle way is courage, which is giving freely of oneself with love and 
eagerness for the defence of the laws of Islam and the upholding of the word 
of divine unity. Apply this same principle to each of its branches.

The six extremes are thus tyranny and the three middle ways are justice, 

which is the Straight Path and is to act in act in accordance with 
( 11:112 ) [ Z Y  Whoever  passes  along  this  way  will  cross  the 
bridge suspended over the Fire.

> = < ;
Consider this: The positioning of the Qur’an’s words like pearls is not on 
one string, but in a multiplicity of embroideries resulting from the interweav-
ing of lines of different relationships, close and distant, apparent and hidden. 
For the basis of the miraculousness after the conciseness is this embroidery.
For  example, > = < ;  has  a  relationship  with  ' &

• and with 9 8  because clearly the straight path is conﬁned to 

their way. This is an example, so carry on in the same way. 

In the word 8 is an indication that their way is passable, and has 

restricted sides so that those who travel down it will not stray from it.

In < – since it is a relative pronoun and it is the function of the rela-
tive pronoun to describe things known to the listener – is an indication to 
the exaltedness of their rank, and their refulgent shining in the darkness of 
mankind, as if they are obvious to all listeners even if they do not search or 
enquire.  While  its  being  plural  indicates  the  possibility  of  following  their 
way, and corroborated by the constant consensus concerning it, its rightness, 
since “ Allah’s power is with the community. ” 1

In the use of the perfect tense for = is a hint to the means of requesting 
further bounty. And its use of the second person, addressing Allah directly, 
indicates that it is an intercessor, as though one is saying: “ O my Allah! You 
are the bestower of bounty and in Your grace have bestowed it before; so 
bestow it on me again, even though I am not worthy. ” 

And in > is an indication to the heavy burden that is divine messen-
gership and the bearing of the Trust, and a sign that the Messengers are like 
high mountains on which pour down torrents of rain so that the plains may 
be  ﬂooded.  As  one  part  of  the  Qur’an  expounds  another,  how  beautifully

belief and fundamental rules, for these are constant and ﬁxed; unlike second-
ary matters, the nature of which is to change in the course of time. Just as the 
four seasons and the stages in a person’s life warrant different remedies and 
clothing – what is a cure at one time may cause illness at another – so the 
stages of the life of humanity necessitate differences in rules of secondary 
importance, which are healing for spirits and nourishment for hearts.

The positioning: Know that in being a station of fear and ﬂight, this sta-
tion has a relationship with those preceding it. For a person looks in bewil-
derment  and  terror  towards  the  station  of  dominicality  signiﬁed  by  Glory 
and Beauty; he looks seeking refuge towards the station of worship in 3 
in his impotence he looks towards the station of reliance in 5 and 
seeking  consolation  he  looks  towards  its  constant  companion;  that  is,  the 
station of hope and relief. For what occurs ﬁrst to the heart of one who sees 
something terrifying is a sense of bewilderment, then he wants to ﬂee, then 
having realized his impotence it occurs to him to rely on Allah, and then he 
receives solace.

•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Allah ( May He be exalted ) is All-Wise and Self-
Sufﬁcient, so what is the wisdom in the creation of evil, ugliness, and mis-
guidance in the world?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Know that perfection, good, and beauty are essen-
tially what are intended in the universe, and are in the majority. Relatively, 
defects, evil, and ugliness are in the minority, and are insigniﬁcant, sec-
ondary, and trivial. Their Creator created them interspersed among good 
and perfection not for their own sakes, but as preliminaries and units of 
measurement  for  the  appearance,  or  existence,  of  the  relative  truths  of 
good and perfection.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  So what is the importance of the relative truths for 

the sake of which partial evil is approved?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Relative truths are the ties between beings and the 
threads with which their order is woven. They are the rays from which is 
reﬂected each unique being of the species in the universe. Relative truths are 
thousands of times more numerous than real truths, for if the real attributes 
of a person were sevenfold, the relative truths would be seven hundred. A 
lesser  evil  may  therefore  be  forgiven,  approved  even,  for  the  sake  of  the 
greater good. For to abandon the greater good because it contains some lesser 
evil, is a greater evil. And in the view of wisdom, if the lesser evil encoun-
ters  the  greater  evil,  the  lesser  evil  becomes  a  relative  good,  as  has  been 
established in principle in z a k ā t  and j i h ā d , for example. As is well known,

site causes the manifestation and existence of its relative truths. For exam-
ple, if there were no ugliness and it did not permeate beauty, the existence of 
beauty with its inﬁnite degrees would not be apparent.

•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :   What  is  the  reason  for  the  different  forms  of  the 
following three words: = being a verb, @ being a passive par-
ticiple, and C being an active participle? Also, what is the reason for 
the following differences being mentioned: the attribute of the third group, 
the outcome of the second, which is the result of its attributes, and the exact 
terms of the ﬁrst?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :   The  term  bounty  ( or  blessings )  is  chosen  because 
bounty  is  a  delight  to  which  the  spirit  inclines,  and  it  is  in  the  past  tense 
because this intimates that it is the mark of the Absolutely Generous One 
not to take back what He gives. By drawing attention to this practice of the 
Bestower of Bounty, it also suggests a way of reaching what is requested, 
as if one was saying: “ Since it is Your practice to bestow bounties and You 
have bestowed them previously, bestow them on me too. ”

As for  @ ?  by it is meant those who exceed the limits of the 
power of passion, and have committed injustice and depravity by abandon-
ing the rules. Since there is in the essence of depravity and injustice an evil 
pleasure and vicious pride that do not sicken the soul, the Qur’an mentions a 
consequence that does sicken it, and that is the descent of divine wrath. The 
fact that a passive participle has been chosen implies continuation and this 
is an indication that rebelliousness and evil become ineradicable character-
istics if they are not halted by repentance and forgiveness.

C B
This  refers  to  those  who  have  strayed  from  the  path  because  delu-
sion  and  passion  have  overridden  the  intellect  and  conscience,  and  they 
have fallen into hypocrisy through false belief. The Qur’an has chosen to 
describe  it  thus  because  misguidance  is  itself  pain;  the  soul  is  sickened 
by it, and the spirit avoids it even it has not seen its result. And the active 
participle  has  been  chosen  because  misguidance  will  be  misguidance  so 
long as it is not halted.

Know too that all pain lies in misguidance and all pleasure is found in 
belief. If you wish, consider the state of a person whom the Hand of Power 
has taken out of the darkness of non-existence and ﬂung into the world, that 
vast and frightening desert. When he opens his eyes seeking compassion, he 
sees afﬂictions and calamities besetting him like enemies. Seeking mercy,

34

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

the  celestial  bodies  and  sees  them  awesome  and  bewildering;  threatening 
him as though they were projectiles of ﬁre issuing from huge mouths and 
encircling him. In bewilderment he lowers his head, and shielding it, starts 
to ponder. Then he hears the thousand screams of his needs and the moaning 
of his wants. Fearfully, he looks to his conscience seeking relief, and is met 
with thousands of vast and overwhelming hopes which cannot be satisﬁed 
in this world. For Allah’s sake, what is the state of this person if he does not 
believe in the ﬁrst creation and the resurrection of the dead, and in the Crea-
tor and Last Judgement? Do you imagine the sufferings of Hell would be 
severer for him, searing his soul more terribly? For his state is one of com-
pounded anxiety, terror, impotence, trembling, fearfulness, orphanhood, and 
despair. If he considers his power, he will see himself to be impotent and 
weak. If he tries to quieten his needs, he will realize that they cannot be qui-
etened. If he shouts and calls for help, he will not be heard and he will not 
be helped. He supposes everything to be hostile. He imagines everything to 
be strange, so feels no familiarity. He does not look to the revolutions of the 
celestial bodies except with fear, bewilderment, and fright, which disturbs 
his conscience.

Now consider the state of this person if he is on the Straight Path and his 
conscience and spirit are illuminated with the light of belief: you will see 
that when he enters this world, opens his eyes, and beholds the assaults of all 
the things around him, he discerns a support on which to lean in the face of 
these onslaughts, and this is recognition of the Creator, so he will ﬁnd rest. 
Then  if  he  examines  his  innate  disposition,  potentialities,  and  hopes, 
which extend to eternity, he will perceive a source of assistance. He seeks 
help from it for his hopes, for from it is drawn the water of life, which is 
knowledge  of  eternal  felicity.  And  if  he  raises  his  head  and  looks  at  the 
universe, he will feel a familiarity with everything; he will sense familiarity 
and affection coming from every ﬂower. He will see in the motions of the 
heavenly bodies the wisdom of their Creator, and he will receive pleasure 
from their progress. Gazing on them, he will take a lesson and reﬂect. It is as 
if the sun is beckoning to him, saying: “ My brother! Don’t be frightened of 
me, I welcome your arrival. Both of us are servants of the One Being, obedi-
ent to His command. ” The moon, the stars, the sea, and their sisters will call 
each with her particular tongue. Waving to him, they will say: “ Welcome! 
Don’t you know us? We are all busy in the service of your Owner. Do not 
feel dismay or fright, nor be distressed by the threat of the calamities with 
their bared teeth, for the reins of all things are in your Creator’s hand. ”

VERSE 7 – GUIDANCE AND MISGUIDANCE

Thus,  in  the  ﬁrst  situation,  the  person  feels  a  terrible  distress  in  the 
depths of his conscience. He will be compelled to rid himself of it and to 
soothe  and  deaden  his  senses  through  diversions,  feigning  unawareness 
and busying himself with trivia, so to deceive his conscience and numb his 
spirit. He will otherwise feel an acute pain in the depths of his conscience, 
and its effect will be apparent to the degree he is distant from the true path. 
As for the second situation, there the person feels in the depths of his spirit 
a great delight and immediate happiness. Whenever his heart awakens and 
his  conscience  stirs  and  his  spirit  is  moved,  his  happiness  will  increase 
and he will receive the good news that the doors of a spiritual paradise are 
being ﬂung open to him.

IF YOU WERE TO ASK: The Qur’an is both miraculous and concise,

yet in it some things are apparently frequently repeated, such as the

and ( 77:15, 19, 24 etc. )  ¹ ¸ and the story of Moses. Aren’t such repetitions 
tedious and contrary to eloquence? 2 

ّر(cid:170)ا ِ

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Everything that shines does not scorch. Yes, repeti-
tions are sometimes tedious, but not always. Sometimes they are boring, and 
sometimes appreciated and admired. The food man eats includes both basic 
sustenance and fruit. The more the former is repeated, the greater the pleas-
ure it affords; it gives strength and the body becomes accustomed to it. But 
the latter gives rise to boredom when repeated and provides pleasure when 
replaced with something new. 

In just the same way, some words and speech are reality ( ḥ a q ī q a  ) and 
basic sustenance; they strengthen the mind and feed the spirit. The more they 
are repeated, the better they seem and the more familiar they become, like 
sunlight. Then others are like fruits and embellishments; they give pleasure 
on being varied in respect of sort and appearance ( lit. apparel ).

Having understood this, you should know that as a whole the Qur’an is 
sustenance for hearts and strength and its repetition causes not boredom, but 

1.  In is narrated from Abū Umāma al-Bāhilī: “ I heard Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) 
say: ‘Read the Qur’an for on the Last Day it will be an intercessor for its adherents. Read

for the most part delight and pleasure. Similarly, in the Qur’an are parts that 
are  the  spirit  of  that  sustenance  and  strength;  the  more  they  are  repeated, 
the more brilliantly they shine, scattering lights of truth and reality. Among 
these latter are some like the ِمـ(cid:193) ِ(cid:110)َ
ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) that are essential princi-
ّر(cid:170)ا  ِن ٰ(cid:175)ْ(cid:110)َ
ples, sources of life, and embodied eternal lights. Savour them, if you have 
any taste! But this is dependent on acceptance of the repetitions. The story of 
Moses may be taken as an example: in each place ( m a q ā m  ) [ it is found, it is 
repeated ] for one of the aspects it comprises. It is more useful than the parts 
of his staff; the Qur’an takes it as silver in its white, shining hand and pours 
it out as gold so that the sorcerers of rhetoric prostrated before its eloquence.

ّر(cid:170)ا ِ

Similarly, in the ِ

ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) there are different facets, some expressing the 
seeking of help and blessings; some looking to the subject [ of the sura in 
question ], indeed, its aim; others indicating that it is an index of the funda-
mental points of the Qur’an.

Also contained in the ِ

ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) are different levels [ of meaning ], those of 
divine unity ( t a w ḥ ī d  ), and declaring Allah free of human attributes ( t a n z ī h  ), 
and praise, and divine glory ( j a l ā l  ) and beauty ( j a m ā l  ), and that of working 
righteousness ( i ḥ s ā n  ), and so on.

The  ِ

ّ(cid:195)ا  ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92)  also  infers  various  ordinances:  for  instance,  it  indicates 
divine unity, prophethood, the resurrection of the dead, and justice; that is, 
the Qur’an’s well-known four [ main ] aims. Most suras have [ only ] one of 
them as its primary aim, while the rest are secondary. So why shouldn’t one 
of the B i s m i l l ā h ’s facets or ordinances or levels [ of meaning ] have a par-
ticular relation with the spirit of the sura [ in question ], and be the topic of 
that context, indeed, a concise index of all those aspects and levels?

Verse 1

( The Disjointed Letters )

! There are four topics related to these.

First Topic

!

The Qur’an’s miraculousness and inimitability rise from the horizon of 
the Disjointed Letters, for it is a light manifested from the blending of the 
corruscating subtleties of eloquence ( or rhetoric – a l - b a l ā g h a  ). This topic 
contains many ﬁne points, but whatever their tenuousness a true dawn breaks 
from their totality. 

F i r s t l y :  ! together with the other Disjointed Letters at the start of some 
suras, their sisters, consist of half the letters in the alphabet, the basic ele-
ments of all words. That is, the Qur’an uses half the twenty-eight letters and 
disregards half. Ponder over this!

S e c o n d l y :  The half it takes are more commonly used than those it leaves.
T h i r d l y :   Of  the  letters  it  takes,  the  Qur’an  repeats  those  easiest  on  the 

tongue, like A l i f  and L ā m .

F o u r t h l y :  It mentions the Disjointed Letters at the start of twenty-nine 

suras, which corresponds to the number of letters of the alphabet. 1

F i f t h l y :  It takes half of those letters that have pairs, like the concealed 
( m a h m ū s a  ),  the  emphatic  ( m a j h ū r a  ),  the  stressed  ( s h a d ī d a  ),  the  soft 
( r a k h w a  ), and the m u s t a ‘ l i y a , m u n ḥ a ﬁ ḍ a , and m u n f a t i ḥ a  letters, and the rest 
of them. Of those that have no pairs ( a w t ā r  ), it takes fewer of the ‘heavy’ 
like  the  tremolo  ( q a l q a l a  ),  and  more  of  the  ‘light,’  like  the  labiolinguals 
( d h a l l ā q a  ).

S i x t h l y :  Those it uses of these are ﬁner in character. 
S e v e n t h l y :  The way the Qur’an has chosen for [ selecting ] the Disjointed 
Letters is one out of ﬁve hundred and four possibilities, and this is the only 
possible  way  of  halving  the  letters  [ of  the  alphabet ]  with  their  particular 

1.  If H a m z a  is counted, there are twenty-nine letters in the Arabic alphabet.

characters. For the divisions [ into different groups of letters ] are interwoven 
and one within the other, as well as being dissimilar. Each of these divisions 
is truly remarkable and singular. So if a person fails to appreciate the light of 
miraculousness born of the blending of these rays, he has only his own lack 
of discernment to blame.

Second Topic

! are each like the rap of a knocker; they rouse the listener, alerting him 
through their singularity that they are the harbingers of something strange 
and remarkable. This topic also contains a number of subtleties.

F i r s t l y :  The disjointing of the letters and their being spelled out by name 

indicates that what they signify is of the same kind as themselves. 

S e c o n d l y :  These letters being disjointed indicates that what they signify 

is assumedly one and not compound.

T h i r d l y :  The spelling out of the letters by disjoining them is an indica-
tion that it is alluding to the material of the art, as though providing pen and 
paper for those wanting to dispute them by writing. It is as if the Qur’an is 
saying: “ Hey you obstinate rivals, you’re the masters of ﬁne speech! You 
have at your disposal the materials I had when I devised these. You do like-
wise if you can! ” 

F o u r t h l y :   Being  devoid  of  meaning,  the  disjointing  of  the  letters  indi-
cates that [ the Qur’an’s ] opponents have been left without proof. For they 
say: “ We don’t know the facts, stories, and ordinances that we might dis-
pute you. ” So it appears the Qur’an is saying: “ I only want you to produce 
[ something similar to ] the eloquent composition ( n a ẓ m   a l - b a l ā g h a  ) [ of the 
letters ], even if it’s made up. ”

F i f t h l y :  Calling the letters by their names is the custom of scholars and 
writers.  But  both  the  one  uttering  this  speech  and  those  listening  to  him 
were unlettered. Considering its character, therefore, the letters being in this 
unexpected form infers that “ this speech is not his but was imparted to him. ”
S i x t h l y :  Spelling out letters syllable-by-syllable is characteristic of those 
learning to read and write. It is understood from this that the Qur’an was 
establishing a new way and was teaching illiterate people.

Those who cannot see the elevated art in the interweaving of these lines 
– though admittedly some are very ﬁne – are novices to the art of eloquence, 
so should apply to its adepts!

Third Topic

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

!  indicate  the  ultimate  conciseness,  which  is  the  second  of  the  two 
principles of [ the Qur’an’s ] miraculousness. This topic comprises a number 
of ﬁne points.

F i r s t :  ! indicate, allude to, hint, intimate, and suggest the [ following ] 

successive parabolic analogy ( a l - q ī y ā s   a l - t a m t h ī l ī   a l - m u t a s a l s i l  ):

For sometimes the ordinances laid down in the whole Qur’an are set out in 
summary  in  a  single  long  sura;  and  sometimes  a  long  sura  is  represented 
allusively in a short one; and sometimes a short sura is included symboli-
cally in a single verse; and sometimes a verse is indicated in a single sen-
tence; and sometimes a sentence is hinted at in a single word; and some-
times  too  such  a  comprehensive  word  may  be  discerned  in  the  disjointed 
letters,  like  in  S ī n .   L ā m .   M ī m .  Similarly,  the  whole  Qur’an  may  be  dis-
cerned in Sūra al-Baqara; and al-Baqara in Sūra al-Fātiḥa; and al-Fātiḥa in

" !  The same goes for ! On the strength of this successive parabolic 
comparison, and as indicated by $ # manifested from ! [ is the 
meaning ]: “ This is Allah’s pre-eternal speech, which Gabriel brought down 
to Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). ”

Most High ] to His Messenger, who holds the key, to which the human mind 
has not yet attained.

T h i r d :  !  show  the  acute  intelligence  of  the  one  to  whom  they  were 
revealed, for he understood what was only allusive, symbolic, and obscure 
as though it were explicit and clear.

F o u r t h :  The disjointing of these letters indicates that the value of the let-
ters lies not in their meanings but in their natural mutual relationships, like 
the relationships between numbers. The science of the hidden properties of 
letters ( ‘ i l m   a s r ā r   a l - ḥ u r ū f  ) has discovered these relationships.

F i f t h :  In particular, ! indicate by their being disjointed the three main 
points of articulating sound: the throat, the mouth, and the lips. And this in 
turn infers that the attention will be caught and the veil of familiarity rent,

to their reciting to you: ِ
Fourth Topic

ّ(cid:195)ا ُم َ(cid:203)ﯬﯦ اَذ ٰ(cid:182)

It is as though when ! and their sisters appear in this form that they are 
declaring: “ We are leaders; we imitate no one and follow none. Our style 
is original and our manner, singular. ” This topic too contains a number of 
subtleties.

F i r s t :  It is the custom of orators and eloquent speakers to always adhere 
to patterns and embroider examples and to follow well-trodden paths. But 
these letters are virginal, untouched by man or jinn.

S e c o n d :  From beginning to end, the Qur’an is as it was at ﬁrst. Although 
out of their longing, its friends have wanted to imitate it, and likewise its 
enemies out of their desire to challenge it, it has never been imitated nor has 
anything similar been achieved. If you want proof of this, take a look at the 
millions of Arabic books! Are any equal to the Qur’an, or even close to it? 
No! Even an ignorant illiterate would exclaim if he were to compare them to 
it: “ The Qur’an is not of their level! ” It is either inferior to all of them, and 
this is impossible; or it is superior, and this is as it should be. It would fall to 
his lot to perceive this much of its miraculousness.

T h i r d :  It is the mark of human art that at ﬁrst it emerges crude and deﬁ-
cient in many respects. It is dry and lacking in grace. Only later is it per-
fected and made pleasing. The Qur’an’s style, however, was graceful, fresh, 
and young when it ﬁrst appeared, and it still challenges the human mind, 
which has grown old through the combining of ideas and plagiarizing them. 
It has triumphed over all of them, proclaiming through its victory that it is 
the art of the Creator of all powers and destiny. 

O  you  who  sniffs  at  the  breeze  of  eloquence!  Doesn’t  the  bee  of  your 

mind gather from the blossoms of these four topics the honey of

Introduction
Consider this: One of the principles of eloquence that beautiﬁes speech 
making it sparkle is that all the sentences and words respond to each other 
and  evoke  each  other  while  looking  to  the  underlying  aim.  Thus,  to  the 
extent of its power each strengthens the aim, which is like the conﬂuence 
of rivers or a pool fed from all sides, conﬁrming and illustrating the saying:
ّلُ(cid:166)َو      ٌد ِ(cid:110)اَو 
Consider, for example, the verse ( 21:46 ) 3 2 1 0 / . it 
frightens by alluding to a small amount of punishment, like two negatives 
making a positive. It points out the terribleness of the punishment by show-
ing the severity of the least amount.

ُر(cid:193) ِ(cid:131)ُ(cid:192) لا َ(cid:175)َ(cid:107)ْ(cid:170)ا   َكاَذ ى(cid:170)إ  ٌ

ّ(cid:99)َ(cid:130) اَ(cid:179)ُ(cid:98)اَراَ(cid:93)ِ(cid:150) 

Don’t you see how the word  ْنِإ signiﬁes doubt, and doubt looks to lit-
tleness or fewness; and the word  َ
ّسَ(cid:174) means to touch lightly and expresses 
a small amount; and the word 0 is merely a whiff and is in the singu-
lar form, which express littleness or fewness, as does the t a n w ī n  indicating 
indeﬁnitenes; and the partitive 1 signiﬁes division or a part; it means a bit 
and indicates paucity; and the word 2 points to a light sort of punish-
ment  rather  than  chastisement  ْلاَ(cid:167)َ(cid:178)  and  suggests  a  small  amount;  and  by 
alluding to compassion, the word  ّ

ِبَر indicates littleness or fewness? 

Now compare the others with this and see how each in its particular way 
assists the main aim. Make analogies with this verse for its brothers. Espe-
cially, + * (  & % $ # *! – for its purpose is to praise the 
Qur’an and prove its perfections. The parts of the verse all point harmoni-
ously  to  this  aim:  in  one  respect,  the  oath  [ expressed  by ] !  and #  1 

1.  The demonstrative pronoun ﭓ is usually translated “ that. ”

being a demonstrative pronoun and denoting tangible things and distance; 
the deﬁnite article  ْلَا in $ and the proof [ indicated by ] (  & % Each 
of these phrases assists the main aim, adding its own share, revealing from 
beneath it the evidences that rest upon it, even if they are slight.

If you wish, consider ! in so far as it is an oath, it is both corroborative, 
and it imparts the idea of [ the Qur’an’s ] greatness. So too, as proof of what 
it is alluding to, it draws attention to the subtleties underlying [ the letters ], 
mentioned in the four Topics above.

Now  consider  the  demonstrative  pronoun  #  It  is  used  to  refer  to 
the  essence  and  attributes  [ of  tangible  things ],  and  so  both  denotes  [ the 
Qur’an’s ] greatness – because it indicates either what ! are alluding to, 
or what is foretold in the Torah and Gospels – and it points to the evidences 
underlying it. So how great, how perfect is the thing sworn by [ that is, the 
Qur’an ], that is foretold in the Torah and Gospels!

Next  scrutinize  carefully  this  demonstrative  pronoun,  which  although 
properly used for tangible things, here alludes to something mental ( a l - a m r  
a l - m a ‘ q ū l  ), and you will see that just as it infers greatness and importance, 
so  it  indicates  that  the  Qur’an  attracts  minds  like  a  magnet,  drawing  eve-
ryone’s gaze upon itself and preoccupying their imaginations. [ The ‘men-
tal’  Qur’an ]  is  therefore  shown  to  be  at  such  a  level  that  if  one  consults 
one’s imagination even it will appear behind it. Thus, by its very nature [ this 
demonstrative pronoun ] infers that [ the Qur’an ] is veracious and trustwor-
thy and free of weakness and trickery, since these should be concealed. 

Then ponder over the distance suggested by the ‘l i k a ’ of “ d h ā l i k a  –  t h i s : ” 
It indicates both the Qur’an’s elevated rank, which points to its perfection, 
and that it is far above any attempts to imitate it. For it is either inferior to 
all of these [ attempts ], and this is impossible as is unanimously agreed, or 
it is superior to all.

Next study the deﬁnite article  ْلَا of $ : Since it expresses restric-
tion,  it  indicates  the  Qur’an’s  sublimity  and  opens  the  door  to  compari-
son, and hints that it not only gathers together in itself the virtues of all the 
[ revealed ] scriptures, but adds to them and is therefore the most complete 
of them. Then dwell on the expression $ and see how it hints that it 
could not be the fabrication of someone unlettered who knew neither read-
ing nor writing.

It indicates too that the Qur’an cannot give rise to doubts, for within it are 
such signs and indications that from all sides they mass together and repulse 
the assaulting doubts.

And in the adverbiality ( or ‘containing’ – ẓ a r ﬁ y y a  ) of “ c o n c e r n i n g  w h i c h

that one’s gaze should penetrate to the Qur’an’s interior and that its truths

to a superﬁcial view.

Friend! Now that you have discerned the value of [ this ] compound [ sen-
tence ] through analyzing it, and perceived the difference between the whole 
and its parts, take a glance at its words and phrases and see how each con-
tributes its share to the joint aim with its own particular evidence, and how 
the light of eloquence ﬂares up on every side.
Consider this: The reason the phrases 

+ *  ..(  & %  ..$ #  ..!
are not linked by conjunctions is their intense union and mutual embrace; 
each  seizes  the  hand  of  the  one  preceding  it  and  the  coat-tails  of  the  one

following it. For in one way each is proof of all of them and in another it is 
their result. 

[ The Qur’an’s ] miraculousness is inscribed on this verse [ as though it 
were ] an embroidery woven of twelve intricately interwoven lines of rela-
tions. If you would like to see it in detail, [ ﬁrstly ] study ! for they imply 
this meaning: “ These [ letters ] are issuing a challenge; is there anyone to 
answer it? ” Then consider  $ # for it states clearly that it surpasses 
all its fellows and has superseded them, thus inferring that it is exceptional 
and without peer. Then ponder over (  & % for it states explicitly that there 
is no room for doubt, thus proclaiming that [ the Qur’an ] is illumined with 
the light of certainty. Then consider + * for it is informing you that 
it points out the straight path and is an embodied light of guidance. Thus, 
in respect of the ﬁrst meaning each phrase is a proof of its fellows, and in 
regard to the second meaning all are the result of each of them.

Now, by way of example, we shall mention three of the twelve relations, 

and you can make analogies with them for the rest. 

! That is, this book challenges all who oppose it; it must therefore be 
the best of books; it therefore expresses certainty; for the best book is one 
that is certain; so it must be embodied guidance for mankind.

Then $ # That is, this book is superior to anything resembling 
it so it must be miraculous. Or, it is exceptional and distinguished; for there 
is no doubt concerning it; because it points out the level path to those who 
fear Allah.

Then, + * That is, it guides to the straight path; so it must be cer-
tain; so it is exceptional; so it is miraculous.
You can now deduce the rest for yourself.

+ *You should be aware that the beauty of this phrase wells up from four 

points:

T h e   F i r s t :  The omission of the subject, which indicates that the subject 
and predicate have united and that the statement [ expressed ] is accepted. As 
though in essence the subject is within the predicate, and they are not dif-
ferentiated between in the mind even.

T h e   S e c o n d :   The  substitution  of  the  active  participle  by  the  verbal 
noun,  in which is an allusion to the fact that the light of guidance has been 

46

embodied and become the very substance of the Qur’an. Like if the colour 
red is embodied, it becomes carmine. 1

T h e   T h i r d :  The use of the indeﬁnite for * which alludes to the inﬁnite 
subtlety  of  the  Qur’an’s  guidance,  the  essence  of  which  is  unfathomable, 
and  to  its  utmost  breadth,  which  is  unencompassable  by  knowledge.  For 
the  indeﬁnite  infers  either  subtlety  and  concealment,  or  unencompassable 
breadth. It is because of this that it is used sometimes to disparage and some-
times to exalt.

T h e   F o u r t h :  The conciseness ( ī j ā z  ) of  + which is used instead of a 
longer phrase like “ the people who have become pious through the Qur’an, ” 
indicates the result rather than what precedes it ( a l - m a j ā z   a l - a w w a l  ), and 
points to the fruits of guidance and its effects. This hints at the argument 
from effect to cause ( a l - b u r h ā n   a l - i n n ī  ) for the existence of guidance. So 
the listener in one century has the evidence of preceding centuries, just as he 
will be evidence for those that succeed him.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  How can eloquence that is beyond human power be 

born of these few points?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  A great mystery lies in mutual assistance and union. 
For by virtue of the mystery of reﬂection, when three beautiful things come 
together, they become ﬁve; and ﬁve become ten; and ten become forty. For 
in each is a sort of reﬂection and it represents [ the beauty ] to a degree. Like 
there appear to be many mirrors when two mirrors are put face to face; or 
if you shine a lamp at them, the reﬂection of its rays will increase the light. 
Similar to this is the combining of a number of points. It is also due to this 
mystery that you will see that the beautiful and the accomplished all have a 
natural inclination to join with others similar to them so as to increase their 
beauty. Stones even, despite their being only stones, incline towards their 
brothers on leaving the builder’s hand for their places in a domed roof, and 
bow  their  heads  to  touch  those  of  their  brothers  and  holding  all  together, 
they do not fall. The human being then who fails to perceive this mystery of 
mutual assistance is more lifeless than a stone, for some stones are such they 
bend over backwards to co-operate with their brothers!

•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :   It  is  the  mark  of  guidance  and  eloquence  to  elu-
cidate,  provide  clear  explanations,  and  to  save  minds  from  confusion. 

1.  A topical allusion in so far as this commentary was written immediately before and 
during the early part of the First World War, for carmine was the colour adopted by and 
symbolic of the Armenians. It was obtained from cochineal, the pressed dried bodies of 
insects. See, Nursi, I s h ā r ā t   a l - I ‘ j ā z  [ Iḥsan Qāṣim ], 48.

VERSE 2 – IN PRAISE OF THE QUR’AN

But the Qur’anic commentators have been at variance over verses like this 
and have suggested different possibilities, and have propounded conﬂicting 
aspects of the phrases. So how can the truth be recognized among all these?
Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  All are right, for the listeners vary greatly. For the 
Qur’an  was  not  revealed  for  the  people  of  only  one  century,  but  for  the 
people of all the centuries; nor for only one class, but for all the classes of 
mankind; and each of these has its own share and part in understanding the 
Qur’an. Between people there are vast differences of understanding, and 
their tastes vary greatly, and they incline to different sides of the Qur’an, 
and appreciate different aspects of it, and their pleasures are diverse, and 
their temperaments are all different. How many things there are that one 
nation deems beautiful which another does not even notice, and which one 
enjoys greatly while another does not even recognize their existence. You 
can draw further analogies in the same way.

It is because of this mystery and instance of wisdom that in most places 
the Qur’an is not speciﬁc and makes its statements general so that every-
one can appraise them according to their own taste and appreciation. The 
Qur’an has ordered its sentences and positioned them in such a way that 
numerous different possibilities unfold from its various aspects, and [ dif-
ferent people with ] their diverse understandings may reﬂect on them and 
each  may  receive  his  share.  You  can  make  further  analogies.  That  is  to 
say, all these different aspects are permissible on condition they are not 
opposed to the sciences of Arabic, are approved by rhetoric ( eloquence ) 
( a l - b a l ā g h a  ), and are acceptable to the science of the principles and aims 
of the Shari‘a. Thus, it emerges from this point that one of the aspects of 
the Qur’an’s miraculous inimitability is its ordering and composition and 
its arrangement in a style that conforms to the understandings of the people 
of all ages and all classes.

Verse 3

Consider  this:  The  positioning  of  this  verse  and  the  previous  one  in 
respect of their essential meanings is this, that the praise of the Qur’an in the 
previous verse has a bearing on the praise of believers in this one, and the 
one ﬂows into the other. For the praise of believers is a result of the former; 
it is a proof from effect to cause ( al-burhān al-innī ); a fruit of the Qur’an’s 
guidance and a witness to it; and by [ the praise in this verse ] being encour-
agement it shows that it has a share of that guidance and is an example of it. 

As for the positioning of - and  َن(cid:193) ۪(cid:163)ـَ

ّ(cid:99)ُ(cid:174) [ and the relationship between 
them ], it [ denotes ] emptying or clearing (  ةـَ(cid:193)ِ(cid:171)ْ(cid:115)َ(cid:98)   ), and adorning (  ةـَ(cid:193)ِ(cid:171)ْ(cid:111)َ(cid:98)   ), 
which is the eternal companion of the former. That is, adornment after puri-
ﬁcation ( t a n z ī h  ). Do you not see that t a q w ā  is the renunciation of evils and 
that the Qur’an mentions it as having three stages: the giving up of associat-
ing partners with Allah ( s h i r k  ), the giving up of sin, and the giving up of all 
things other than Allah? Adornment is to perform good acts, either inwardly 
with the heart, or physically, or with property. Now, the sun of interior acts 
is belief ( ī m ā n  ), and the index of physical acts is the ṣ a l ā t  or ritual prayers, 
which are “ the pillar of religion, ” 1 and the pivot of acts related to property 
is the puriﬁcation tax ( zakāt ), which is “ the bridge of Islam. ” 2

Consider  this:  Were  you  to  consider  [ the  phrase ] / . -  in 
respect of its position, you would see that it should be concise ( ī j ā z  ), yet if 
you compare it to its synonym َنوُ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174)ْؤُ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)َا , it will strike you as prolix. For the 
deﬁnite article  ْلَا has been exchanged for - whose function as a relative 
pronoun  is  to  qualify  through  the  relative  clause  the  noun  it  governs.  [ It 
is the relative clause then – not the relative pronoun – that has importance

since  it  qualiﬁes  the  subject.  The  construction  here  then  draws  attention ] 
to belief, encouraging it and exalting it. This is a sign too that belief illu-
minates  the  one  professing  it  like  a  lighthouse  so  that  his  other  attributes 
wane and fade away. And . has been substituted for َنوُ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174)ْؤُ(cid:174) in order to 
depict this praiseworthy situation for the imagination. It is also a sign that 
belief is renewed through its continued existence and is manifested through 
the succession of evidences, both exterior and interior. Yes, the clearer the 
evidences are, the ﬁrmer is belief. 

By / is meant that they believe with the heart, that is, sincerely with-
out prevarication, even when alone. And they believe in what is unseen and 
in the World of the Unseen. 

So  know  that  belief  is  a  light  produced  by  afﬁrming  in  detail  all  the 
essentials of religion brought by the Prophet ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ) and the rest in general.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Only one out of a hundred ordinary people are able 

to express the truths of belief clearly?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  The inability to state something clearly does not indi-
cate  its  non-existence.  Mostly,  the  tongue  is  incapable  of  interpreting  the 
subtleties of what the mind conceives of. Similarly, the intellect cannot con-
template the hidden secrets of the conscience, so how should it interpret all 
of them? Don’t you see that for all his intelligence, a genius and master of 
rhetoric like al-Sakkākī failed to harvest the ﬁne points produced spontane-
ously by a nomad like Imru’ al-Qays, 1 or someone similar. In consequence, 
one can establish whether or not an ordinary person believes by questioning 
him and seeking an explanation. You can question him both positively and 
negatively, saying: “ O you common man! Is it possible according to your 
way  of  thinking  that  the  Maker  in  the  grasp  of  Whose  power  are  all  six 
aspects of the world, should be present in just one place of it? ” If he replies 
negatively,  then  the  fact  that  Allah  is  beyond  the  restrictions  of  space  is 
ﬁrmly established in his conscience, and that is sufﬁcient for him. You can 
think of further examples in the same way.

Know too that as expounded by Sa‘d, 2 belief is a light that Allah ( May 
He be exalted ) instils instantaneously in the hearts of those of His servants

that He wishes – that is, after they have used their will power. Yes, belief 
is  a  light  for  the  human  conscience,  a  ray  from  the  Pre-Eternal  Sun  that 
suddenly bathes in light the conscience’s inner face. It affords it a feeling 
of familiarity with the whole universe and establishes relations between it 
and all things. It imparts such moral strength to a person’s heart that he can 
overcome all the events and misfortunes that beset him. It affords him such 
breadth he can endure the past and the future. Yes, as belief is a ray from the 
Pre-Eternal Sun, so it is a ﬂash of eternal happiness, that is, of the resurrec-
tion of the dead. Through the light it emits, the seeds of man’s hopes sprout, 
and the potentialities lodged in his conscience start to grow and to stretch 
out towards eternity, and the seeds of his abilities are transformed into a Tree 
of Tuba.

Consider this: The positioning [ of this phrase and its relationship with 
the  previous  one ]  is  as  clear  as  daylight.  For  the  ṣ a l ā t   being  speciﬁed 
rather than other physical good works indicates that they are an index of 
all meritorious acts and a sample of them, and that they reﬂect them – like 
the Fātiḥa is an index of the Qur’an and man is an index of the world. For 
in one sense the ṣ a l ā t  include fasting, the Hajj, z a k ā t , and the other forms 
of worship; and they include the worship of all creatures, both innate and 
voluntary;  some  of  the  angels  bow  in  worship,  others  prostrate,  and  yet 
others stand, and some stones prostrate in worship, and some trees stand, 
and some animals bow down. 

The verbal form “ ( lit. they perform ) ¾  ” is used instead of َنوُ(cid:175)(cid:193)ِ(cid:163)ُ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)َا 
( the  active  participle )  in  order  to  thrust  before  the  mind’s  eye  of  the  lis-
tener this extensive vital action, this heedfulness of the spirit, in the world 
of Islam, and to alert his imagination to this admirable and orderly situation 
in all the regions of humanity, and to arouse in him the desire to do like-
wise. For if someone observes the effect of a bugle call on soldiers dispersed 
and lost among the people, how it arouses them, summoning them to gather 
together and take up pleasing, orderly positions, he himself will feel inclined 
to  join  them.  Just  the  same  is  the  call  to  prayer  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP ) 
among the people in this bleak world. 16:60 )  j  i  h )

The  use  here,  the  place  for  conciseness,  of  the  prolix ¿ ¾  in

regularly, and seriously, and preserving oneself [ from distractions etc. ], and 
increasing demand for them in the market of the world. Ponder over this, 
and  understand  too  that  the  ṣalāt  are  an  elevated  link,  a  lofty  relationship 
between the bondsman and the Pre-Eternal Monarch, and an honourable act 
of service. It is characteristic of this relationship that it captivates the spirit. 
The  ‘pillars’  of  the  ṣ a l ā t   comprise  numerous  mysteries  which  have  been 
expounded in works like a l - F u t ū ḥ ā t   a l - M a k k i y a .  1 One of these is that the 
conscience loves them. They are a summons of the Pre-Eternal Maker to the 
pavilion of His presence ﬁve times a day and night to commune with Him, 
as a sort of Ascension. This is such that everyone’s heart should yearn for 
it. The ṣalāt perpetuates in the heart the idea of the Maker’s sublimity and 
makes the mind conscious of it so as to induce obedience to the divine laws 
of justice and compliance with the dominical order of things. Man is in need 
of this because he is human and because he is by nature civilized. So alas for 
those who give up the ṣalāt! What a loss the lazy suffer! And O, the igno-
rance of those who do not know their value! And those who do not deem 
them worthwhile, they should go elsewhere, the targets of general disgust!

means  enjoined  [ by  religion ]  whereby  [ people ]  may  assist  one  another; 
indeed, it is a highway in the ordering of human society, and a link or artery 
by which the substance of life may ﬂow between its members. Indeed, it is 
the antidote to the very real poisons impeding human progress. Yes, there is 
vast wisdom in the obligation of z a k ā t  and prohibition of usury and interest, 
and lofty beneﬁts and extensive mercy. For if you take a historical look at 
the page of the world and study the evils of human society, you will see that 
the underlying reasons for all revolutions and corruption, and the source of 
immorality are only two sayings: 

T h e   F i r s t :  “ Once I’m full, what is it to me if others die of hunger? ”

imperiled human progress, taking it tottering to the verge of the conﬂagra-
tion of anarchy. And the only way to eradicate it, the only remedy for it, is 
the prohibition of usury and interest. So reﬂect on this!

Consider this: The order of society is dependent on there being no vac-
uum between the classes of people. The upper classes should not grow dis-
tant from the lower classes, nor the rich from the poor, to the extent that the 
lines of communication are broken between them. But because the obliga-
tory payment of  z a k ā t  and the prohibition of usury and interest have been 
neglected, a yawning gap has opened up between the classes, and the upper 
classes have grown so distant from the lower classes that no links between 
them remain. It is because of this that instead of respect, obedience, and love 
ascending from the lower classes to the upper classes, shouts of revolution 
arise, and shrieks of envy and cries of hatred and revenge. Similarly, instead 
of kindness, generosity, and favours descending from the upper to the lower 
classes, the ﬁres of tyranny and oppression, and volleys of insult rain down 
on them. Alas! While the qualities of the elite should be the cause of mod-
esty and compassion, unfortunately they give rise to pride and arrogance. 
And while the powerlessness and poverty of the poor necessitate kindness 
and benevolence, they lead to slavery and degradation. If you want a witness 
for what I say, take a look at the civilized world; there you will ﬁnd as many 
witnesses as you could wish for. The only means of reconciliation between 
the classes, which will bring them closer together, is the payment of z a k ā t , 
one of the pillars of Islam, and an elevated, far-reaching rule in the admin-
istration of society.

Consider this: The Qur’an has let its composition ﬂow. That is to say, in 
most verses similar to this one, it has not speciﬁed any aspect of the phrases 
and sentences by placing a sign in them. This is for a subtle reason, and this 
reason is the source of its conciseness ( a l - ī j ā z  ), which in turn is the source 
of its miraculousness. The reason is this: eloquence consists of speaking in 
conformity with the demands of any situation. The Qur’an addresses peo-
ple belonging to different classes in different centuries. So taking all these 
classes and centuries into consideration so that all those different types of 
people may receive their share, it makes omissions ( ḥ a d h f  ) in many places 
in  order  to  make  general  what  it  says  and  apportion  it  out,  and  speaks  in 
absolute terms so as to make it comprehensive and distribute it. Moreover 
it leaves the composition free in many places to multiply its facets and to 
increase the possibilities agreeable to eloquence and acceptable to the sci-
ences of Arabic. Thus all minds receive the Qur’an’s effusions to the extent 
they can appreciate them. Consider this carefully!

Now the positioning of this verse in relation to the previous one

Here it is being speciﬁc after being general, to proclaim over the heads 
of witnesses the distinction of those People of the Book who believe, and to 
silence those of them who hold back from it, and to take those like ‘Abdul-
lah ibn Salam  1 by the hand so as to encourage others to follow his exam-
ple. Moreover, it states unequivocally that there are two sorts of Godfearing 
people ( m u t t a q ī  ), thus stating openly that the Qur’an’s guidance embraces 
all peoples, and inferring that Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ) was sent as Messenger to all nations without exception. Also, by elu-
cidating the pillars of belief contained in the shell of  / . it supplies 
details after its previous succinct statements, for it makes explicit mention 
of the revealed books and resurrection of the dead, and implicit reference to 
the prophets and angels.

VERSE 4 – BELIEF IN THE QUR’AN

55

The  Qur’an  did  not  opt  for  conciseness  by  saying  something  like 
ِنٰاْرُ(cid:163)ْ(cid:170)اِ(cid:92) َنوُ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174)ْؤُ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)اَو  rather,  in  order  to  stud  the  meaning  with  subtleties  and 
decorate its appendices with ﬁne points, it preferred  : 9 8 7 6 
For in - is a sign that the attribute of belief is what is intended, and that a 
person’s other attributes are dependent on it and concealed beneath it. 
In the use of the imperfect tense for 7 instead of َنوُ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174)ْؤُ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)َا [ the active 

participle ] which infers [ something ] being ﬁxed and unchanging, is an indi-
cation that belief is constantly renewed on the repeated coming of revelation.
Then with the vagueness of اَ(cid:174) it indicates that abbreviated belief is suf-
ﬁcient,  and  that  belief  includes  exoteric  revelation  [ like  the  Qur’an ]  and 
esoteric revelation like Hadiths.

Concerning 9 in regard to its matter ( m ā d d a  ) it indicates that belief in 
the Qur’an is belief in its revelation by Allah the Most High. Likewise, it 
means belief in Allah is belief in Allah’s existence, and belief in the hereaf-
ter is belief in the coming of the hereafter.

The  use  of  the  perfect  tense  although  the  revelation  had  not  yet  been 
completed, is an indication that its completion was as certain as that which 
had been revealed. Moreover, 7 being in the imperfect tense infers the 
future, thus compensating for the deﬁciency inferred by the use of the per-
fect. Because the Qur’an was revealed in this way [ that is, by degrees ], you 
see in its styles that the past very often swallows the future and the imperfect 
tense dons the attire of the perfect. The eloquence of this is a very subtle:

If a person hears something referred to in the past although it has not yet 
occurred, it arouses his mind and he is alerted to the fact that he is not alone, 
but behind him are row upon row at various distances, as though the  cen-
turies and their peoples are sitting in tiers rising up behind him. This makes 
him aware that the address and call directed towards him is being heard by 
all of them according to its volume. Yes, it is a divine address from which 
all the rows of men in all the centuries receive their share. Thus, the past is 
real for most people most of the time, while for a few a little of the time it is 
ﬁgurative ( m a j ā z  ). So to take the majority into consideration serves better 
the purposes of eloquence.

And in the use of : rather than ‘on you’ 

َكـْ(cid:193)َ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) is a sign that the 
divine messengership was a duty with which the Prophet ( Upon whom 
be  blessings  and  peace )  was  charged,  that  he  undertook  voluntarily. 

56

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

Also, [ on the one hand ] it indicates his loftiness since Gabriel served him 
by presenting [ the Qur’an ] to him, for ‘on’ ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) hints of compulsion and that 
the means of revelation was higher. While [ on the other ] the use of the sec-
ond person : rather than [ the third person ] ‘to Muhammad’ implies that 
Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) was only an addressee 
and  that  the  speech  is  Allah’s  Word.  Moreover,  in  meaning,  the  direct 
address of the vocative conﬁrms and illustrates the meaning of that which 
is sent down or revealed ( a l - n u z ū l  ), and this is the Revelation ( a l - w a ḥ y  ), 
and the Revelation is the Qur’an, which is a divine address [ to the Prophet ] 
the character of which is to permeate all these [ points ]. And this reveals his 
share of this characteristic. Thus, it becomes clear by reason of its encom-
passing all these subtle points, that this passage is of the utmost conciseness.

> = < ;
Consider this: The purpose of descriptions like these is to arouse eager-
ness, and this implies [ certain new ] injunctions: “ Believe in such-and-such 
and make no distinction [ between the prophets ]. ” The phrase’s positioning 
and its ties [ with what precedes it ] comprise four subtle points:

F i r s t l y :  The argument from what is adduced to the evidence. It is like 

this:

“ O men! If you believe in the Qur’an, believe also in the previous scrip-
tures, for the Qur’an conﬁrms their veracity and testiﬁes to them. ” This is 
indicated by ( 2:97 )  h g f e

S e c o n d l y :  The argument from the evidence to what is adduced, like this:
“ O People of the Book! If you believe in the past prophets and scriptures, 
you  should  also  believe  in  the  Qur’an  and  Muhammad  ( UWBP ),  for  the 
scriptures  gave  the  good  news  of  his  coming.  Moreover,  conﬁrmation  of 
them, and their revelation and evidences of the messengers’ prophethoods 
are  found  in  reality  and  in  spirit  more  perfectly  in  the  Qur’an  and  more 
clearly in Muhammad ( UWBP ). Thus, according to this excellent reason-
ing, the Qur’an is the Word of Allah and Muhammad ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ) is His Messenger.

T h i r d l y :  In this is a sign that the outcome ( a l - m a ’ ā l  ) of the Qur’an, that 
is, Islam, which emerged from it in the Era of Bliss, is like a tree whose ori-
gin is fastened in the depths of the past. Its spreading roots are fed from the 
water-sources of that time yielding life and strength. And with its trunk in 
the skies of the future, its spreading branches are laden with fruit. That is to 
say, Islam embraces the past and the future.

VERSE 4 – BELIEF IN THE QUR’AN

57

F o u r t h l y :   In  this  is  a  sign  that  it  is  urging  the  People  of  the  Book  to 
believe [ in Islam ], for it is making it appear familiar to them, and easy. It 
is as though [ the Qur’an ] is saying: ‘O People of the Book! You should not 
experience any difﬁculty in entering this [ new ] way, for you are not casting 
away your outer shell altogether, but only completing your beliefs and build-
ing on the fundamentals you already possess.’ For the Qur’an does not bring 
any new fundamentals or principal beliefs; it modiﬁes and perfects existent 
ones; and it combines in itself the virtues of all the previous books and the 
essentials of all the previous laws. It only establishes new ordinances in sec-
ondary matters, which are subject to change due to differences in time and 
place. For just as with the change of seasons, food and dress and many other 
things are changed; so too the stages of a person’s life warrant changes in the 
manner of their education and upbringing. Similarly, as necessitated by wis-
dom and need, religious ordinances concerning secondary matters change 
in  accordance  with  the  stages  of  mankind’s  development.  For  very  many 
of these are beneﬁcial at one time yet harmful at another, and very many 
medicines were efﬁcacious in mankind’s infancy yet ceased being remedies 
in its youth. This is the reason the Qur’an abrogated some of its secondary 
pronouncements. That is, it decreed that their time had ﬁnished and that the 
turn had come for other decrees.

[ The words ] > = [ also indicate ] a number of subtle points: 
Consider this: There is no word of revelation that is disdainful of its place, 
or is not content with it, or thinks that another place would be better. No, 
there is no word of revelation but it is like an embossed pearl, held ﬁrmly in 
its setting by the bonds of the relationships between it and its brothers. If you 
wish, study > = you will see how the subtleties ﬂy out from every side 
of the verse and alight on this unique phrase. The verse of which > = is 
a part deals with the question of prophethood and the ﬁve aims it comprises. 
The phrase has absorbed these aims and been coloured by them. Signifying 
ﬁve  subtle  points,  it  exudes  the  ﬁve  aims,  which  are  reﬂected  from  these 
relationships. 

The aims included [ in prophethood ] are these: Muhammad ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ) is a prophet; he is the most perfect of the prophets; 
he is the Seal of the Prophets; he was sent to all peoples; his Shari‘a abro-
gated all preceding ones and contains their virtues.

The manner the ﬁrst aim is reﬂected in the phrase: [ The words ] > = 
are used only when ways are united and the road is one, as though the phrase 

58

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

is suggesting that by comparison all the proofs of the previous prophets and 
of the veracity of their scriptures form a decisive proof of the prophethood of 
Muhammad ( UWBP ) and the revelation of his Book. For all the causes and 
reasons conﬁrming their prophethoods, prove his prophethood more explic-
itly  and  more  powerfully.  It  is  as  though  all  their  miracles  form  a  single 
miracle proving his veracity.

The  way  in  which  the  second  aim,  the  perfection  of  Muhammad’s 
( UWBP ) prophethood, is reﬂected in the phrase > = In view of the facts 
that  it  is  the  custom  for  the  king  to  appear  before  the  people  at  the  end 
of a ceremony, and in accordance with the law of human progress a later 
teacher is better than an earlier one, and generally those who come later are 
more proﬁcient than those who preceded them, Muhammad ( Upon whom 
be peace ) was the Sovereign of the Prophets, and the best and most perfect 
of them, just as the Qur’an is more comprehensive and universal than their 
scriptures.

The way the phrase > = absorbs the third aim, which is Muhammad’s 
being the Seal of the Prophets: In accordance with the rule, “ if one is mul-
tiplied it goes to inﬁnity, stopping nowhere; but if a multiplicity of things 
are united, they acquire stability and come to a halt, ” and as is inferred by 
the opposite idea, > = hints that “ there will be no prophets after you, ” 
and that Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) is the Seal of the 
Prophets.

The way the phrase > = is coloured by the fourth aim, the universal-
ity of his mission: It expresses this meaning: “ You are their successor and 
they are all your predecessors. ” Hence, according to the rule, “ the successor 
shoulders the duties of his predecessor and takes his seat, ” all of them were 
your predecessors and you are their deputy and the Messenger to all peo-
ples. Yes indeed, it could only be thus! For the innate disposition of things 
demands it and wisdom requires it. Before the Era of Bliss all the nations of 
the world of humanity were extremely distant from one another and hostile 
to each other, both physically and emotionally, and by instinct and upbring-
ing. A single sort of education was insufﬁcient for them and all could not 
be drawn to a single cause. Then, when humanity was awakened in the Era 
of Bliss and subsequently, and people felt a desire to come together due to 
the exchange of ideas and swapping of characters, and the intermingling of 
peoples, and some of them investigating the conditions of others, and time 
was churned up by the many means of communication and transportation; 
– then the globe of the earth became like a single country, or a province, 

VERSE 4 – BELIEF IN THE QUR’AN

59

or a town, and the people of the world came together; and then a single mis-
sion, a single prophethood was sufﬁcient for all of them.

The  way  the  phrase  intimates  the  ﬁfth  aim:  Since  the  =  of > = 
infers a beginning, it infers ‘to’ ىَ(cid:170)ِإ which indicates the end. That is, “ prophet-
hood came to an end with your coming, for your Shari‘a is sufﬁcient. ” This 
infers that his Shari‘a abrogated all previous ones, signalling their end, and 
through its sufﬁciency, included them all.

The evidence that from the point of view of eloquence this phrase has 
absorbed these subtle points is that the ﬁve aims resemble a river ﬂowing 
beneath these verses; one of them gushes out completely in one verse, then 
another ﬂows forth in another, and another is manifested entirely in a torrent 
in yet another. Even the least trickle on the surface indicates that the veins 
of this phrase touch it. Moreover, the above meanings sprout forth in many 
different verses.

A @ ?
Consider  this:  This  phrase  refers  to  the  fourth  of  the  four  well-known 
aims of the Qur’an: the resurrection of the dead. I have deduced ten proofs 
of it from the Qur’an’s composition and have set them out in another book. 1 
It will be useful to summarize them here. They are as follows:

The resurrection of the dead is a reality, for there is perfect, intentional 
order  in  the  universe.  There  is  total  wisdom  in  creation.  There  is  nothing 
futile in the world. There is no waste in creation ( a l - ﬁ ṭ r a  ). This testimony 
is vouched for by the inductive reasoning of all the sciences, each of which 
is  a  faithful  witness  to  the  order  in  its  ﬁeld  of  study.  Also,  there  being  
repeated  resurrections  in  most  things,  such  as  the  days  and  the  years  and 
so  on  [ testiﬁes  to  the  resurrection  of  the  dead ].  Man’s  innate  disposition 
also  points  to  it.  It  is  indicated  too  by  his  inﬁnite  hopes  and  desires.  The 
All-Wise Maker’s mercy also alludes to the resurrection, while the truthful 
tongue of Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) states 
it  explicitly.  And  the  Inimitable  Qur’an  testiﬁes  to  it  with  such  verses  as  
( 71:14 ) 9 8 7 and  ( 41:46 ) ì ë ê é These ten genuine 
proofs are keys to eternal happpiness and to the doors of Paradise.

A n   E x p l a n a t i o n   o f  

t h e   F i r s t   P r o o f :   If  the  universe  did  not  result  in 
everlasting happiness, the order in it, which its Maker has laid down with 
the  greatest  skill  and  precision,  leaving  minds  in  amazement,  would  be  a 
ﬂimsy, deceptive form, and all non-material matters and connections, and 
relationships and links in the order would go for nothing. The order is order 
only because it leads to eternal happiness. That is, the ﬁne points and non-
material aspects of the order only sprout in the next world. Otherwise, all 
those non-material aspects would be extinguished, all the bonds be broken, 
all the relationships severed, and the order would cease to be. But the power 
inherent in the order declares in resounding voice that it would not let it be 
broken and dissolved. 

S e c o n d   P r o o f :   The  faultless  wisdom  [ in  the  universe ],  which  is  the 
exempliﬁcation of pre-eternal providence ( a l - ‘ i n ā y a t   a l - a z a l i y y a  ) and con-
sists of following uses and instances of wisdom in all the realms ( lit. spe-
cies – n a w ‘  ) of beings, indeed in every part of each – as is testiﬁed to by the 
sciences, gives the glad tidings of eternal happiness. We would otherwise 
have to deny these purposes and beneﬁts the certainty of which compels us 
to acknowledge them. For then the beneﬁts would not be beneﬁts, and the 
wisdom would not be wisdom, and the uses would not be useful. And this is 
pure sophistry.

T h e   T h i r d   P r o o f ,   w h i c h   e x p o u n d s   t h e   S e c o n d :  Science testiﬁes also that 
the Maker chooses the shortest path in everything, and the closest side, and 
the lightest and most beautiful form. This indicates the absence of futility. 
And this suggests that the Maker is truly serious. And this could only be with 
the coming of eternal happiness. Otherwise existence would descend to the 
level of absolute non-existence and everything would be transformed into 
pure futility. اً(cid:103)ـَ(cid:93)َ(cid:150) اَذـٰ(cid:182)  َتْ(cid:163)َ(cid:171)َ(cid:114)اَ(cid:174) 

َكَ(cid:178)اَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93)ـ ُ(cid:126)

T h e   F o u r t h   P r o o f ,   w h i c h   e l u c i d a t e s   t h e   T h i r d :  The sciences show that 
there  is  no  waste  in  creation.  If  your  mind  is  incapable  of  perceiving  the 
instances  of  wisdom  in  the  macrocosm,  that  is,  the  world,  scrutinize  the 
microcosm,  which  is  man,  for  the  science  of  anatomy  has  described  and 
proved them. In the human body are approximately six hundred bones each 
of  which  has  a  particular  function.  And  there  are  six  thousand  veins  and 
arteries for the circulation of the blood, each with its own use. And there 
are twenty-four thousand pores and ducts in the cells. And in each cell func-
tion  the  ﬁve  powers  of  attraction,  repulsion,  holding  ( m u m s i k a  ),  forming 
( m u ṣ a w w i r a  ), and reproduction, which all have their own purposes. 

VERSE 4 – BELIEF IN THE QUR’AN

61

If the microcosm is thus, would the macrocosm be defective in compari-
son? If there is this absence of waste in the body, which has no importance 
compared with its essence ( l u b b  ), is it conceivable that the spirit ( j a w h a r  
a l - r ū ḥ  ) would be neglected, or that spiritual matters ( a l - m a ‘ n a w i y ā t  ) and 
hopes and ideas, which are the works of the spirit, would be wasted? If it 
were  not  for  eternal  happiness,  all  spiritual  matters  would  shrivel  up  and 
be wasted. For Allah’s sake, is it reasonably possible that you should have 
a jewel worth the world and look after its shell and case, not even letting it 
become dusty, then take it and smash it to smithereens and destroy all trace 
of it? Absolutely not! You only look after the case for what it contains. Fur-
thermore, if a person’s sound constitution and healthy members and facul-
ties give you to understand that he will continue to live and develop, do not 
the constant reality permeating the spirit of the universe, and the total force 
indicating the continued existence of its order, and the perfection causing 
the  evolution  ( t a k a m m u l  )  of  its  overall  system  all  show  you  that  eternal 
happiness will arrive through the door of bodily resurrection, because it is 
only resurrection that saves the order from disturbance and is the means of 
its evolution, and for the unfolding of that perpetual force?

F i f t h   P r o o f   ,   a n d   S u r m i s e ,   w h i c h   i n d i c a t e s   i n t e n t i o n :  The existence of 
repeated resurrections in most of the realms of beings points to the supreme 
resurrection. If you like, this can be illustrated with an example: take a look 
at your weekly clock. It contains various cogs and ﬂywheels that turn and 
work  the  hands.  One  of  them  counts  the  seconds;  it  is  a  forerunner,  giv-
ing  news  of  the  motion  of  the  minute  hand.  This  paves  the  way  for  and 
announces the motion of the hour hand, and it results in and proclaims the 
motion  of  the  hand  that  counts  the  days  of  the  week.  The  preceding  one 
completing its circuit indicates that its sister following it will complete its 
circuit. Similarly, Allah the Most High, be He exalted, has a vast clock the 
machinery of which are the heavenly spheres; its hands count the days, and 
the years, and the life of mankind, and term of the world. They are the equiv-
alent of the seconds, minutes, hours, and days of your clock. The morning 
comes after every night, and the summer comes after every spring – result-
ing from the motion of that clock – which is a concealed sign and subtle hint 
that the morning of the spring of the resurrection will come, breaking forth 
from the vast clock of the universe.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Things are not resurrected identically in the repeated 
resurrections in the universe, so how does this show that they will be restored 
to life identically at the supreme resurrection?

62

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

Yo u  w o u l d  b e  t o l d :  A human individual is like a species of other creatures. 
For the light of thought affords such breadth and expansion to man’s hopes 
and his spirit that they encompass the past, present, and future. If he were to 
swallow the past and the future together with the present, it would not satisfy 
his hopes. For the light of thought renders his nature lofty, his value general, 
his view universal, his perfection unlimited, his pleasures continuous, and 
his sufferings constant. As for the members of other species, their natures 
are particular, their value individual, their views limited, their perfections 
restricted, their pleasures instantaneous, and their suffering ﬂeeting. So why 
should the existence of a sort of resurrection in the [ other ] species not point 
to a general resurrection of the human individual?

T h e   S i x t h   P r o o f ,   w h i c h   i s   a l l u s i v e :  This is the unlimited nature of man’s 
potentialities. Man’s unbounded conceptions and thoughts are born of his 
inﬁnite hopes. These arise from his unrestricted desires, which in turn arise 
from his unlimited abilities. These are concealed in his boundless potentiali-
ties, planted in the substance of his spirit, which Allah the Most High has 
ennobled. All of these point testifying to eternal happiness beyond the bod-
ily resurrection of the dead, ﬁxing their gaze on it from afar. Reﬂect on this!
T h e   S e v e n t h   P r o o f ,   c o n v e y i n g   t h e   g o o d   n e w s  that the mercy of the Most 
Merciful and Compassionate One tells of the coming of the supreme mercy, 
by which I mean eternal felicity. For it is through eternal felicity that mercy 
becomes mercy and bounty becomes bounty, and the universe is delivered 
from the lamentations and general mourning arising from eternal separation, 
which transforms bounty into an afﬂiction. If the spirit of bounty, that is, 
eternal felicity, were not to come, all bounties would be transformed into 
misfortunes, and it would necessitate obstinate denial of the mercy that is 
self-evidently testiﬁed to by the whole universe. O Habib and Shaﬁq, 1 both 
lovers! Consider the ﬁnest works of divine mercy: affection, compassion, 
and  love.  Then  consult  your  consciences,  but  after  supposing  them  to  be 
subject to eternal separation and unending parting; how they appeal for help! 
How your imaginations cry out, and your spirits are tormented at the trans-
formation of affection and kindnesss, the most beautiful and exquisite sorts 
of mercy and bounty, into a terrible calamity and afﬂiction. Is it at all pos-
sible that such necessary mercy would assist eternal separation in assaulting 
affection  and  kindness?  No!  That  mercy  is  such  that  it  would  set  eternal 
separation to attack unending parting, and beset unending parting with eter-
nal separation, and annihilate both of them!

T h e  E i g h t h  P r o o f ,  w h i c h  i s  e x p l i c i t :  This is the veracious, veriﬁed tongue 
of Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). His word ﬂung open 
the doors of eternal felicity. The consensus of all the prophets from Adam to 
their Seal ( UWBP ) concerning this truth, forms a decisive proof of it. There 
must be such a truth, since they were in agreement concerning it.

N i n t h   P r o o f :  This is the miraculous Qur’an’s announcement of eternal 
felicity. The seven aspects of its miraculousness have been conﬁrmed for 
thirteen centuries furnishing proof of what it claims. For it discloses bodily 
resurrection with its message and is the key to it. 1

T h e   T e n t h   P r o o f :   This  consists  of  thousands  of  proofs  supplied  by 
numerous verses. For example, the verse, ( 71:14 ) 9 8 7 indicates a 
parabolic analogy ( q i y ā s   t a m t h ī l ī  ); and ( 41:46 ) ì ë ê é points 
to a proof of justice. Indeed, in most of its verses the Qur’an has opened up 
windows looking onto the resurrection of the dead.

The parablic analogy ( a l - q i y ā s   a l - t a m t h ī l ī  ) in the ﬁrst verse above is as 
follows: consider the human body, how it passes from stage to stage, from 
sperm to a blood-clot, and from that to an embryo, and from that to ﬂesh and 
bone, and from that to a new creation. Each of these stages has such particu-
lar  laws,  such  determined  order,  such  regular  development  that  it  reveals 
transparently an intention, will, and choice. Next study its continued exist-
ence,  for  the  body  renews  its  clothes  every  year,  and  this  occurs  through 
dissolution and reassembling. That is to say, the cells are broken down and 
repaired with a subtle substance prepared by their Maker in accordance with 
a particular law, and distributed in appropriate amounts to all the organs.

Now study the stages of the subtle matter that bears the members’ suste-
nance, how it is spread to all the parts of the body in a way that astonishes 
the mind, and how it is apportioned according to a speciﬁc law of division 
appropriately to the needs of the members. This is after it has been distilled 
by passing in accordance with a ﬁxed order and speciﬁc rules and extraor-
dinary process through the body’s four ﬁlters, and being cooked in its four 
kitchens, and undergoing four wondrous transformations; and the sustenance 
having been obtained according to a regular law, and particular system, and 
speciﬁc rule from substances dispersed through the world of the elements. 

All the laws and systems in these stages show transparently a driving 
force, an intention, and wisdom. How could it not be thus? If you study

an atom from the caravan of the subtle matter [ known as sustenance ], for 
example  one  concealed  in  the  element  of  the  air  which  ﬁnally  becomes 
part of the pupil of Habib’s eye, you will see that its path has been deter-
mined  in  the  air,  as  though  charged  and  commanded  to  proceed  to  the 
place appointed for it. And if you consider it with a scientiﬁc eye, you will 
be certain that it is not in motion through blind chance and aimless coinci-
dence, for whatever level it enters upon it conforms to its particular order, 
and whatever stage it rises to it knows its speciﬁc laws, and to what level 
it travels to it is driven with a wondrous, orderly motion. It passes through 
all these stages till it reaches its destination. And it never deviates even an 
iota from its intended goal.

I n   S h o r t :  Whoever ponders over the ﬁrst creation will cease to have any 
doubts concerning the second. Indeed, the Prophet ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ) said: “ How strange the person who sees the ﬁrst creation 
yet denies the second! ”

For the soldiers of a regiment to gather together at the sound of the bugle 
after having dispersed to rest, emerging from every nook and cranny, and to 
form ranks under their ﬂag, is far easier than calling them up the ﬁrst time 
and taking them under discipline and arms. Similarly, it is easier for parti-
cles that are closely acquainted having been intermingled in a single body to 
regather at sound of Israﬁl’s trumpet, and for them all to come from every 
side in response to their Creator’s command; this is easier and reasonably 
more possible than their original creation and composition. For in relation to 
divine power, the greatest thing is equal to the smallest.

It  seems  that  at  the  resurrection,  the  original  parts  of  the  body  will  be 
restored  to  it,  as  well  as  those  that  were  discarded.  This  is  alluded  to  by 
the  vast  bodies  of  the  resurrected,  1  and  the  fact  that  it  is  disapproved  of 
( m a k r ū h  ) to cut the hair or nails when canonically unclean, and that it is 
Sunna to bury them.  2 But according to investigations, [ a few cells from ] 
the coccyx ( ‘ a j b   a l - d h a n a b  ) will be sufﬁcient as a seed and substance for 
the body’s re-formation. 3

Mount Uhud, and his skin will be of the thickness of three days’ journeying. ” M u s l i m , iv, 
2189. See, Nursi, I s h ā r ā t   a l - I ‘ j ā z  [ Iḥsan Qāṣim ], 66, for this and following two Hadiths.

by the earth except for [ a few cells from ] the coccyx. They were created out of that [ in

VERSE 4 – BELIEF IN THE QUR’AN

65

Now for the proof indicated by the verse,  ( 41:46 ) ì ë ê é we 
very often see tyrannical, sinful, and cruel men living in the greatest luxury, 
passing their lives in afﬂuence and ease. Then we see that poor, oppressed, 
righteous men of good character live lives of great hardship, degraded and 
oppressed. Then death comes and makes them equal and this appears to be 
the ultimate tyranny. Whereas divine justice and wisdom, which are testiﬁed 
to by all the universe, are exempt from such tyranny. There must therefore 
be a ﬁnal gathering at which the former will receive his punishment and the 
latter his reward, so that divine justice may be fully manifested. You can 
compare other verses of the Qur’an with these two.

The positioning of the parts of the phrase: A @ ?
The main points [ that this phrase consists of ]: The و the precedence of 
ِةَر ِ(cid:114)ٰ
ْ(cid:202)اِ(cid:92) ; ” the use of the deﬁnite article for “ t h e   h e r e a f t e r ; ” the term “ h e r e -
a f t e r ; ” the use of the personal pronoun @ and the use of A rather than 
َنوُ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174)ْؤُ(cid:192)

The  [ conjunction ]  و  :  After  the  general  statements  of  the  previous 
phrases, [ the purpose of ] this is to denote the speciﬁcity [ of this one ] with 
its explicit mention of this pillar of belief, for [ this pillar ] is one of the two 
pivots on which the revealed scriptures turn.

The  precedence  of  ِةَر ِ(cid:114)ٰ

ْ(cid:202)اِ(cid:92)  denotes  restriction,  and  this  suggests  that 

because [ some of ] the People of the Book say: 
( 2:80 ) W V U T S R and [ others of them ] deny bodily 
pleasures,  the  hereafter  will  be  metaphorical  for  them  and  only  in  name; 
what they will experience will not be the true hereafter.

The  use  of  the  deﬁnite  article  ْلَا  is  to  express  its  known  nature.  That 
is, it indicates that [ the hereafter ] is well known by reason of its constant 
mention by the revealed scriptures. Its being well known is also a hint that 
it is true, and a sign that in consequence of the proofs based on the nature 
of things mentioned above it is a fact almost visible to the mind. Its being 
well known is therefore a sign that it is a reality. And the use of the term 
“ t h e   h e r e a f t e r   ِةَر ِ(cid:114)ٰ
ْ(cid:202)َا   ”  that  is,  making  it  an  adjective  qualifying  creation 
ةَأ ْ(cid:131)َ
ّ(cid:179)(cid:170)َا  is to direct attention towards the ﬁrst creation, so that the mind 
will grasp the possibility of the second.

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

The  personal  pronoun  @  infers  restriction,  and  this  suggests  that  the 
belief of those People of the Book who do not believe in Muhammad ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) is not certain belief. Indeed, it is only a sup-
position they suppose is certain.

A is used instead of  َنوُ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174)ْؤُ(cid:192) although belief is certain afﬁrmation, in 
order to intentionally point the ﬁnger at the objective so to dispel any doubts. 
For the resurrection of the dead is a thronging mass of doubts [ and complete 
certainty ( y a q ī n  ) concerning it is more important than afﬁrmation ( t a ṣ d ī q  ) 
of it ]. Also this deﬁnite statement blocks up the path of such excuses of the 
People  of  the  Book  as  “ We’re  believers  anyway,  so  let  those  who  don’t 
believe, believe. ”

Verse 5 

K J I H G F E D C
Consider this: The surmised places ( a l - m a ẓ ā n n  ) in which the subtleties 
sparkle [ in this verse ] are the following: the positions of the words in rela-
tion to those that precede them; the perceptibility of  C and the distance 
it expresses; the elevatedness denoted by D the use of the indeﬁnite in E 
the preposition F the raising and sustaining inferred by G
The positioning

This verse is tied to what precedes it with a number of threads of relation-
ships. One of these is picking up the threads, that is, it is the answer to three 
implied questions:

T h e   ﬁ r s t  is a question seeking an example, as though having listened to 
the Qur’an and heard that it is marked by giving guidance to people who as 
a result acquire ﬁne qualities, the listener wants to see them actually clothed 
in these qualities seated on the throne of guidance. So it replies by depicting 
them for him, saying: G F E D C

T h e   s e c o n d   is  a  question  about  the  reason  for  guidance,  as  though  the 
questioner is asking: “ What are they like that they have deserved guidance 
and are distinguished by it? ” And it replies: “ They possess all these quali-
ties in combined form. If you study them carefully, you will see that they are 
worthy of the light of guidance. ”

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Doesn’t the more detailed mention of the qualities 
in  previous  verses  explain  the  reason  for  guidance  more  clearly  than  the 
concise C ?
Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Conciseness ( i j m ā l  ) is usually clearer than detailed  
explanation, especially if the answer sought arises from a combination of 
things. For [ here ] the limited nature of the listener’s mind, and the extended 
nature of the discussion, and the intervention of forgetfulness, and the rea-
son for guidance emerging from the combination of all the elements of the 
discussion [ hinder ] understanding of it. So because C combines these 
things, its conciseness explains the reason more clearly.

67

68

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

T h e   t h i r d  is a question about the results and fruits of guidance, and its 
being a bounty and pleasure, as though the listener asks: “ What is its pleas-
ure  and  [ how  is  it  a ]  bounty? ”  And  it  replies  saying  that  it  is  [ only ]  in 
guidance that happiness is to be found in this world and the next; that is, the 
result of guidance is itself and its fruits are the same as itself. For of itself it 
is the greatest bounty, and rapture of the conscience; it is the paradise of the 
spirit, just as misguidance is its hell. Later it will produce the fruits of hap-
piness and salvation in the hereafter.

When it comes to the perceptibility ( a l - m a ḥ s ū s i y y a  ) of C it is a sign 
that the frequent mention of the qualities leads to their being embodied in the 
listener’s brain, made present in his mind, and perceptible to his imagina-
tion. So from their [ qualities ] being known by [ mere ] mention they become 
( lit. a door opens onto ) known actually ( lit. externally ), and from this he 
understands  the  believers’  distinction  and  gazes  on  their  shining  radiance 
among mankind. It is as though nothing else will appear to whoever raises 
his head and opens his eyes to look.

The  distance  expressed  by C  although  on  the  whole  they  are  near, 
indicates the loftiness of their rank, for when seen from afar only the tall in 
stature are visible. Nevertheless, if distance of time and space is real, it is 
the best judge of the imperatives of eloquence. For the Era of Bliss [ may be 
thought of as ] a tongue reciting this verse as it was revealed, and all subse-
quent centuries tongues reciting it also, making it young and fresh as though 
newly revealed, not [ something that ] was revealed long ago that has been 
related. For the front rows, referred to by C appear from afar. So their 
being visible despite the distance proclaims their great stature and lofty rank.
Now  for  [ the  preposition ] D  Consider  this:  The  mystery  of  the  rela-
tionships [ or associations ] between things makes most of them like mirrors 
reﬂecting each other. This one reﬂects that, and that one this. Just as a frag-
ment of glass can show you a vast desert; so sometimes a single word may 
provoke endless imaginings, and one sentence may conjure up a strange tale 
before your eyes, and one phrase may take your mind on a jaunt through the 

World of Similitudes. Similarly, the word َزَراَ(cid:92) to meet in combat, reveals to 
you a battleﬁeld, and the word  ٌةَر َ(cid:175)َ(cid:102) in the verse pushes open for you the 
door of Paradise. You can carry on in the same way! Just the same is the 
word D it opens a window for the mind, [ revealing ] the following com-
parison: the Qur’an’s guidance is a divine mount which it gives to believers 

VERSE 5 – THE RIGHT-GUIDANCE OF REVELATION

to travel on. When mounted on it, they are on the Straight Path, journeying 
to the throne of perfections.

The use of the indeﬁnite for E indicates that it is different to + * 
For generally speaking, the repetition of the indeﬁnite shows that the second 
is not the same as the ﬁrst. Here, the previous one is a maṣdar or verbal noun, 
while this one is ‘the product’ of the verbal noun (ḥ ā ṣ i l   b i ’ l - m a ṣ d a r ). That 
is, it is a constant ‘perceptible’ attribute or quality (ṣ i f a   m a ḥ s ū s a q ā r a ) and 
the fruit of the ﬁrst.

The  word   F  indicates  that  [ guidance ]  is  both  created  by  Allah  and 

granted to them by Him.

The word  ِ

ّبَر indicates that to give guidance is the mark of dominicality 
( r u b ū b i y y a  ), so just as He provides them with sustenance, so He sustains 
them with guidance. 

K J I
Know that the places the subtle points should be sought are these: The 
conjunction و the repetition of C the detached pronoun مُ(cid:182) the deﬁnite 
article  ْلَا ; ” َنوُ(cid:111)ِ(cid:171)ْ(cid:159)ُ(cid:174) being absolute, and the form of their prosperity or good 
fortune not being speciﬁed.

The conjunction is used owing to the relationship between the two clauses. 
For  just  as  the  ﬁrst C  signiﬁes  happiness  in  this  world  ( a l - s a ‘ ā d a t  
a l - ‘ ā j i l a  ), which is a fruit of guidance; so the second points to the happiness 
of  the  hereafter  ( a l - s a ‘ ā d a t   a l - ā j i l a  ).  Yes,  although  both  of  them  are  the 
fruit [ or summary ] of what precedes them, the best [ view ] is that the roots 
of the ﬁrst C are fastened on the ﬁrst - and it seems to refer to unlet-
tered believers who [ are not People of the Book and ] receive their strength 
from the pillars of Islam [ that is, they perform the ṣ a l ā t  and pay z a k ā t  ]; this 
looks to what precedes A @ ? The second C glances secretly, 
alluding to the second - which it seems, refers to believing People of the 
Book. Its point of reference is the pillars of belief and certainty about the  
hereafter. Now reﬂect on this!

As for the repetition of C it indicates that in respect of the ultimate 
cause  of  guidance  and  the  reason  for  their  being  praised  and  privileged, 
these two fruits [ of guidance and salvation ( prosperity ) ] are independent 
of and different to each other. Nevertheless, the best [ interpretation ] is that 

70

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

the second C points to the ﬁrst in addition to [ the predicate of which it 
is the subject ] as though it is saying: “ This one is learned and that one has 
been honoured. ”

To come to the detached pronoun ْمـُ(cid:182) : Besides corroborating the restric-
tion that hints at the People of the Book who do not believe in the Prophet 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), it contains a subtle point which is 
this:  the  ْمـُ(cid:182)  being  placed  between  the  subject  and  predicate  changes  the 
subject into one with numerous predicates. One is mentioned and the rest 
are referred to the imagination. For the ْمـُ(cid:182) alerts the imagination to the fact 
that the predicates are not restricted and urges it to search for suitable ones. 
Just  as  you  could  plant  Zayd  before  the  listener  and  reel  off  many  of  his 
attributes, saying “ Zayd is learned, Zayd is clever, he is this, he is that; ” so 
too by saying: C then putting the [ pronoun ]  ْمـُ(cid:182) the Qur’an excites the 
imagination so that it comes up with things consonant with their attributes. 
For  example,  “ They  are  on  guidance, ”  “ they  shall  prosper, ”  “ they  shall 
escape Hell-ﬁre, ” “ they shall win Paradise, ” “ they shall succeed in attain-
ing to the vision of Allah’s beauty ( May He be exalted ), ” and so on. 

The deﬁnite article “ t h e  ( a l  ) ” portrays reality, as though saying: “ If you 
want to see the truth about those who shall prosper, look in the mirror of 
C and it will depict it for you. ” Or [ its purpose ] is to specify them, as 
though saying: “ If you have heard who it is that shall prosper and attain to 
happiness and you want to learn what they’re like, look at C for that is 
[ how they are ]. ” Or [ its purpose is ] to clarify what is being stated and make 
it evident, like  w ā l i d u h u   a l - ‘ a b d  ( his father is [ a ] slave ); that is, the fact 
that his father is a slave is known and obvious. [ For although the predicate 
should have been indeﬁnite, it was made deﬁnite. ]

َنوُ(cid:111)ِ(cid:171)ْ(cid:159)ُ(cid:174) is absolute to make it general. For the Qur’an addresses all classes 
of people with their different aspirations: some of them want to be saved 
from Hell-ﬁre; others aspire only to Paradise; and others seek only divine 
pleasure; yet others yearn for the vision of divine beauty; and so forth. The 
Qur’an has put it in absolute form to make the table of its favours general so 
that everyone may pick what they fancy.

Verse 6 

+ * ) ( ' & % $ # " !
This verse’s positioning [ and relationship with what precedes it ]

Consider this: In the world of His pre-eternal attributes, the Unique Being 
has two manifestations, those pertaining to His glory ( j a l ā l ī  ) and those per-
taining  to  His  beauty  ( j a m ā l ī  ).  Through  their  manifestation  in  the  world 
of the attributes of actions, they appear as grace and wrath, and goodness 
and majesty. Then inclining to the world of actions, adornment and embel-
lishment ( t a ḥ l i y a ,   t a z y ī n  ) arise, and demonstrate that the Creator is exempt 
from  the  attributes  of  creatures  ( t a k h l ī y a ,   t a n z ī h  ).  Then,  being  imprinted 
on the world of the hereafter, which is one of the worlds of works ( ‘ ā l a m  
a l - ā t h ā r  ), grace is manifested as Paradise and light, and wrath is manifested 
as Hell and ﬁre. And being reﬂected in the world of remembrance, recol-
lection is divided into praise ( a l - ḥ a m d  ) and gloriﬁcation ( a l - t a s b ī ḥ  ). And 
being represented in the world of speech, they diversify into command and 
prohibition. And being depicted in the world of guidance, they divide into 
encouragement  and  restraint,  and  reassurance  and  warning.  And  through 
their  manifestation  in  the  conscience,  hope  and  fear  are  born.  And  so  on. 
Moreover, it is the mark of guidance to preserve the balance between hope 
and  fear,  in  order  that  hope  may  induce  striving  and  work,  and  fear  may 
restrain from transgression, and a person will not despair of divine mercy 
and  opt  out  in  blameworthy  fashion,  or  feel  sure  he  will  not  be  punished 
so  unconcernedly  go  astray.  It  is  because  of  this  successive  wisdom  that 
the Qur’an does not encourage without restraining, nor praise the righteous 
without censuring sinners.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Why is there no conjunction here, between this and  

the previous verse, as there is in the verse, 

( 82:13-14 ) b a ` _  *   ] \ [ Z

Yo u   w o u l d   b e  

t o l d :   A  conjunction  is  apt  in  so  far  as  the  relationship 
[ between  the  two  parts  of  speech  it  is  joining ]  is  apt,  and  the  aptness  of 
the relationship depends on [ both parts being congruent and ] following the 
same aim. But because different aims are being followed here [ in this verse 
and the previous one ], the conjunction was not deemed ﬁtting. For the praise 

71

72

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

of the believers leads to and is preliminary to praise of the Qur’an, and it is 
its result and is driven to it. While the censure of the unbelievers is in order 
to restrain and frighten, and is not the prelude to praise of the Qur’an.

Now consider the subtleties in the positioning of the parts of this 
verse

Firstly familiarize yourself with [ the intensive particle ] Z and [ the rela-
tive pronoun ] - for they are the most itinerant and roaming of whatever 
you will encounter in the Qur’an in the way stations of revelation. For some 
reason or other, the Qur’an mentions them frequently, for besides the ﬁne 
points they express particular to the places they are used, they comprise two 
general subtleties from the jewels of eloquence:

It is characteristic of  Z to pierce the surface and delve into the truth, and 
fasten the purport of its sentence to it, as though it is itself the root and sinks 
into the truth. For example, “ Indeed, it is thus: ” that is, what is being stated 
is not imaginary, or contrived, or subjective, or newly invented; it is a con-
stant truth. [ The grammarians ] say that [ the purpose of ] Z is to establish or 
conﬁrm facts ( l i ’ l - t a ḥ q ī q  ) and therefore denotes this fact and characteristic. 
The particular point here is that Z repels doubt and denial, although these 
were completely lacking in the Prophet ( UWBP ), who was being addressed; 
it  alludes  therefore  to  his  overwhelming  desire  that  [ the  deniers ]  should 
come to believe.

Now  for  -  know  that  it  is  characteristic  of  [ the  relative  pronoun ] 
“ a l l a d h ī  ”  to  indicate  something  new  and  strange  that  the  mind  perceives 
before the eyes, which is not emphatic but born of a combination of things. 
For this reason you will see that among the particles and pronouns of dem-
onstration ي ِذَ
ّ(cid:170)َا the relative pronoun, is the easiest on the tongue and the one 
most used in denoting the change and renewal of subjects. For when that 
which was to establish truth and reality, that is the Qur’an, appeared, some 
things ( a n w ā ‘  pl. of  n a w ‘  ) were cancelled and vanished, and others were 
formed and new truths were born. 

Consider the Era of Ignorance, how social relations ( a n w ā ‘  ) were based 
on national ties, and social mores ( lit. truths – ḥ a q ā ’ i q  ) were based on tribal-
ism. Then when the Qur’an came, it severed those ties and destroyed those 
mores, and established other relations ( anwā‘ ) in their place: the bonds of 
religion. Now reﬂect on this! When the Qur’an rose shining over humankind, 

VERSE 6 – ABOUT UNBELIEF

73

hearts bloomed and became fruitful through its light, and a luminous truth 
was  produced,  which  was  the  class  ( n a w ‘  )  of  believers.  Then  because  of 
their  iniquity,  some  souls  putriﬁed  in  the  face  of  that  light  and  a  venom-
ous truth was born, the particular characteristic of the class of unbelievers. 
Between the - in this verse and that [ in verse 3 ] there is also reciprocity, 
[ because they both point to a truth which is the reverse of the other ].

Know that like the deﬁnite article, the relative pronoun is used to express 
ﬁve meanings, the best known of which is its denoting something known 
( a l - ‘ a h d  ).  The  -  here  alludes  to  notable  unbelievers  like  Abu  Jahl, 
Abu  Lahab,  and  Umayya  ibn  Khalaf,  who  died  in  a  state  of  unbelief.  In 
this respect therefore, the verse gives news about the unseen realm [ it is a 
prophecy of the future ]. Born of these ﬂashes, and others like them, is a sort 
of miraculousness, there being four sorts of miraculousness or inimitability 
pertaining to the Qur’an’s meanings ( a l - i ‘ j ā z   a l - m a ‘ n a w ī  ).

The word #   Unbelief is darkness, consisting of the denial of some-
thing brought by the Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), after 
having had certain knowledge of it.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  The Qur’an is one of the essentials of religion, yet 

there has been dispute over its meanings?

Yo u  w o u l d  b e  t o l d :  In every passage of the Qur’an there are three proposi-

tions:

T h e   F i r s t :  This is the Word of Allah the Most High.
T h e   S e c o n d :  Its intended meaning is the truth.
It is unbelief to deny these two.
T h e   T h i r d :  Its intended meaning is this. 
If  this  last  proposition  is  incontestable  or  expounded,  it  is  compulsory 
to believe in it once one is informed about it and to deny it is unbelief. If it 
is clear or is a verse that has another possible meaning, it is not unbelief to 
deny it since it is open to interpretation. Interpretation however should not 
be based on personal whims. Unanimously reported Hadiths are the same 
as Qur’anic verses in this regard. However, where there is denial of the ﬁrst 
proposition  in  connection  with  Hadiths,  these  should  be  considered  care-
fully.  [ That  is,  the  Hadith’s  authenticity  and  the  unanimity  concerning  it 
should be considered carefully. ]

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Unbelief is ignorance yet in the Qur’an it says:  
( 2:146 ) ' & % $  How can these two statements be reconciled?

74

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :   There  are  two  sorts  of  unbelief.  The  ﬁrst  is  due  to 
ignorance; a person denies because he does not know. The second is obsti-
nate rejection; a person knows but does not accept; he is certain but does 
not believe; he afﬁrms but his conscience does not submit. Think carefully 
about this! 

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Does Satan know Allah in his heart?
Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  No, because due to his innate disposition his heart is 
continuously preoccupied with leading people astray, and his mind continu-
ously thinks of unbelief and inculcating it in others. He never ceases doing 
this. The idea of unbelief never quits his head so that knowledge of Allah 
might become established in it.

• I f  y o u  w e r e  t o  a s k :  Unbelief is an attribute of the heart, so how can wear-

ing the ‘zunnar’ 1 and the hat, which has been compared to it, be unbelief?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  The Shari‘a acknowledges the outward signs of hid-
den matters. It even recognizes apparent causes that have no reason ( ‘ i l l a  ) 
as the reason. So since some girdles hinder bowing in prayer and some hats 
prevent full prostration, it deems the wearing of them a reason for unbelief. 
For they both infer the renouncing of worship and imitation of unbelievers, 
betokening appreciation of their outlook and nationality. Thus, so long as 
the hidden matter is not decisively disproved, judgement is made according 
to its outward signs.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  If they have no warning, why should people be held 

accountable?

Yo u  w o u l d  b e  t o l d :  To rebut their arguments and excuses. [ For they could 
say: We weren’t told that we would be held to account, and did not know 
about it. And this could save them from punishment. ] 2

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Since their obstinate rejection is foretold, it means 
they are prevented from believing. Isn’t it therefore impossible to hold them 
responsible?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Neither the prediction, nor divine knowledge or will 
are connected to their unbelief independently of the cause. They are con-
nected to it only through their wills ( i k h t i y ā r  ). There is detailed discussion 
of this below. It is because of this that it is said: “ An obligation [ imposed 
by ] will is not inconsistent with [ or opposed to ] will. ”

verse that states they will not believe? So isn’t this a contradiction in terms?
Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  They are not being ordered to believe in every detail 
of  the  Qur’an,  that  it  should  be  impossible.  Also,  the  verb  “ ( w h o  )  r e j e c t  
f a i t h  ( lit. disbelieved ) #     ” being in the perfect tense infers that they 
chose unbelief after the truth had become clear, so the warning was futile. 
[ As the word s a w ā ’ u n  – i t   i s   t h e   s a m e  – indicates. ] 1

Now for $ it is a ﬁgure of speech meaning: whether it is futile or has 
the  desired  result,  it  makes  no  difference  whether  or  not  you  warn  them. 
That is, there’s no reason for you either to warn them or to not warn them. 
“ To  ( lit. on ) t h e m   > :  ” in this is a sign that they shall remain on the 
earth but not raise their heads and heed their leaders. It also implies: “ But it 
is not the same for you, [ O Muhammad!, whether you warn them or not ], 
for it is meritorious for you to convey the message; indeed, 

( 5:99 ) d  c  b  a  `
) ( ' & : the “ w h e t h e r  (  َء – hamza ) ” and “ o r  '  ” here are 
like letters signifying $ and corroborate “ the same ” in the ﬁrst [ phrase 
of the verse ]. Or [ their purpose ] is to direct attention to the two meanings 
of it mentioned above. 

•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Why is this ‘sameness’ expressed in interrogative 

form ( ṣ ū r a   a l - i s t i f h ā m  )? [ That is, the َء of  &  ]

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :   If  you  want  to  alert  the  person  you  are  addressing 
subtly yet convincingly to the fact that what he is doing is futile, you have to 
question him so as to draw his attention to it. [ Then ] he can switch mentally 
from the act to its result and feel certain. There is also a connection between 
the  interrogative  form  and  the  sameness,  because  the  question  comprises 
it.  For  as  far  as  the  questioner  knows,  it  is  the  same  whether  or  not  the 
thing about which he is asking exists. Moreover, very often the answer also 
implies this sameness.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Why is the warning expressed by  & in the 

perfect tense?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  So that it might proclaim: “ You’ve tried it before, O 

Muhammad! So you know what’ll happen! ”

•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :   Why  does  it  say ) ( '     although  it  is  clearly 

pointless not to warn them?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :   Warning  a  person  may  increase  his  obstinacy,  but 

remaining silent may induce him to think fairly. 

• I f  y o u  w e r e  t o  a s k :  Why, although the Prophet ( UWBP ) is both a bringer 

of glad tidings and a warner, does this verse only warn and intimidate?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e  

t o l d :   Because  intimidation  is  ﬁtting  for  unbelief;  and 
because repelling harm is preferable to attracting beneﬁts and more effec-
tive; and because the intimidation here causes the imagination to tremble and 
makes it realize that after the words + * it will be faced with “ whether 
or not you give them glad tidings [ it is the same for them ]. ”

Know that all speech has a literal meaning and a hidden purpose. This 
too  has  subtle  hovering  meanings,  and  a  purpose  that  unfolds,  which  is 
to  alleviate  the  Prophet’s  difﬁculties  and  relieve  his  stress,  and  to  con-
sole him and advise him to follow the earlier prophets. For most of them 
were addressed similarly. Noah, even, said after receiving such an address: 
( 71:26 )  Æ Å Ä Ã Â Á À  Also,  because  the  Qur’an’s  verses 
resemble mutually reﬂecting mirrors, and the stories of the prophets are like 
a halo around the moon, they look to the Prophet’s ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ) situation. It is as though this passage is saying: “ This is a 
natural divine law that has to be obeyed. ”

Having made this analysis, know that with all their parts this verse and 
the  next  one  up  to : 9 8  are  so  delivered  that  they  infer  the 
abomination of unbelief and scorn of it, and cause aversion to it and implic-
itly  deter  from  it,  and  humiliate  the  unbelievers  and  mark  them  out,  and 
scare others away from it and threaten them. With their words these verses 
proclaim that unbelief is a terrible calamity, the loss of vast bounties, the 
onset of severe suffering, and the cessation of elevated pleasures. They state 
explicitly that unbelief is the most repulsive of things, and the most harmful. 
As follows:

The replacement of + * with # indicates that due to their lack 
of belief they have fallen into the darkness of disbelief, which is a calam-
ity that corrupts the very substance of man’s spirit, and implies that it is a 
source of suffering. And the replacement of ‘they do not give up unbelief’ 
( l ā   y a t r u k ū n a   a l - k u f r  ) with + * indicates that due to this loss they have 
lost their belief, the source of all happiness. 

VERSE 6 – ABOUT UNBELIEF

77

With the phrase 0 / . - it indicates that having come to dis-
believe,  their  hearts  and  consciences,  which  receive  life,  joy,  happiness, 
and attain to perfection only through the manifestation of the divine truths 
through the light of belief, become like ruined buildings desolate and swarm-
ing with vermin and noxious things. So their doors are locked and sealed up, 
and  they  are  shunned.  They  are  abandoned  and  left  to  the  scorpions  and 
monsters. 

With  the  phrase 2 1  it  indicates  that  due  to  their  unbelief  they 
have lost the immense bounty of hearing, for when the light of belief con-
stantly [ shines ] behind and informs his ear, it is affected by the cries of all 
the  world  and  understands  the  invocations  of  its  beings.  It  hears  the  uni-
verse’s  vociferations  and  understands  its  gloriﬁcations.  Indeed,  when  the 
ear hears the dominical speech in the sighing of the blowing wind, the peals 
of the rolling thunder-clouds, the refrains of the billowing sea, the clamour 
of the throbbing stones, the pattering of the falling rain, and the songs of 
the twittering birds, and understands their lofty gloriﬁcations, the universe 
becomes a vast orchestra for him. It arouses in his heart an elevated sorrow 
and excites passion in his spirit. He feels sad on recalling his friends and 
companions, but it is a pleasurable sadness at their absence. It is not that he 
has no friends, so is distraught. But when the ear is blocked up by disbelief, 
it becomes deaf to these delightful sounds and it hears nothing from the uni-
verse except cries of mourning and the lamentations of death. This arouses 
in the heart the pathetic sorrow of the orphan; that is, the lack of friends; and 
the desolation of alienation; that is, being without owner or guardian. It is for 
this reason that the Shari‘a deems lawful such sounds as excite an elevated 
love and the sorrow of love, and it declares unlawful any that inﬂame the 
carnal appetites and produce the sorrow of the orphan. Any the Shari‘a does 
not specify for you, judge for yourself according to the effect they have on 
your spirit and conscience.

The phrase 6 5 4 alludes to the loss of a huge bounty in con-
sequence of their unbelief. For when the eye is illuminated with the light 
of belief dwelling behind its pupil, the light assists and impels it, and the 
whole universe becomes a garden for it bedecked with ﬂowers and houris. 
The eye’s pupil becomes a bee, ﬂying hither and thither gathering from the 
blooms the juices of reﬂection, thought, familiarity, friendliness, love, and 
felicitation. It takes up its load, which in the conscience is transformed into 
the honey of perfections.

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

But  if,  Allah  forbid!,  the  eye  becomes  dimmed  and  lustreless  through 
disbelief, the world becomes a prison in its view, its truths are hidden from 
it, and the universe becomes a wasteland, causing such pain to the heart that 
it overwhelms the conscience completely.

Moreover, with the phrase : 9 8 it indicates a fruit of the 
Zaqqum tree of unbelief in the next world, which is the torment of Hell and 
the terrible punishment of divine wrath. 

While + * corroborates $ explicating the manner of the same-

ness.

Verse 7 

: 9 8  7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 / . -
Consider this: At this point we have to stop to listen to what the scholars 
of  k a l ā m   have  to  say,  for  a  ﬁerce  war  has  been  waged  around  this  verse, 
between  the  Mu‘tazila,  the  Jabriyya,  and  the  Sunnis.  Wars  like  this  have 
caught the attention of observers. It is appropriate therefore to mention the 
main arguments so they may be beneﬁted from. [ It will be seen then that ] 
the Sunni School is the Straight Path, and the others either go to excess or 
are deﬁcient.

T h e   F i r s t :  It has been established that “ there is no effective agent in the 
universe other than Allah the Most High. ” Hence, there is no delegation of 
power, [ as the Mu‘tazila asserted, that man creates his own actions ]. 1

T h e   S e c o n d :   “ Allah  is  All-Wise, ”  so  reward  and  punishment  are  not 
futile or without wisdom. Hence, there is no compulsion. Just as divine unity 
( t a w ḥ ī d  ) strikes the Mu‘tazila on the chest, so Allah being free of anthropo-
morphic elements ( t a n z ī h  ) deals the Jabriyya a slap in the mouth. 

T h e   T h i r d :   Everything  has  two  aspects:  the  outer  ( m u l k i y y a  )  aspect, 
which  is  sometimes  good  and  sometimes  bad.  Different  forms  intrude  on 
it in succession, like the back of a mirror. The inner aspect ( m a l a k ū t i y y a  ) 
looks to the Creator. It is transparent in every respect, like the front of a mir-
ror. Thus, the creation of bad is not bad, because its creation in respect of the 
inner face is good. The creation of bad is to complete the good, so is indi-
rectly good. So pay no attention to the specious arguments of the Mu‘tazila!
T h e   F o u r t h :  The a l - ḥ ā ṣ i l   b i ’ l - m a ṣ d a r  is the outcome of the verbal noun 
( m a ṣ d a r  ), like death is the outcome ( a l - ḥ ā ṣ i l   b i ’ l - m a ṣ d a r  ) of murder ( q a t l  
–  verbal  noun )  and  pain  is  the  outcome  ( a l - ḥ ā ṣ i l   b i ’ l - m a ṣ d a r  )  of  a  blow 
( ḍ a r b  – verbal noun ). The outcome of the verbal noun is something ﬁxed, 
created, and lifeless, and attributes cannot be derived from it. [ That is, the 
active  particle  cannot  be  derived  from  something  lifeless  ( j ā m i d  ),  as  is 
well known in grammar ( ‘ i l m   a l - ṣ a r f . ] The verbal noun ( a l - m a ṣ d a r  ), how-
ever, is acquired ( m a k s ū b  ), relative ( n i s b ī  ), and hypothetical ( i ‘ t i b ā r ī  ) and 
attributes can be derived from it. Thus, the Creator of murder ( q a t l  ) cannot 

1.  Nursi, İ ş â r â t ü ’ l - İ ’ c a z  [ Abdülmecid ], 83.

79

80

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

be the murderer ( q ā t i l  ). So leave the Mu‘tazila “ t o   p l u n g e   i n   v a i n   d i s c o u r s e  
a n d   t r i ﬂ i n g . ”( See, 6:91 )

T h e   F i f t h :   Apparent  actions  are  generally  the  result  of  a  succession  of 
acts  that  end  in  a  person’s  ‘inclination’  ( m a y a l ā n  ),  called  will  ( a l - j u z ’ 
a l - i k h t i y ā r ī  ). It is around this point that the arguments have revolved. 

T h e   S i x t h :  It is the Most High’s practice that His universal will looks to 
the particular will of His servant, [ That is, it is manifested in accordance 
with the servant’s will ] so there is no compulsion.

T h e   S e v e n t h :   Knowledge  is  dependent  on  the  thing  known;  the  thing 
known is not dependent on knowledge, otherwise it would be a circular argu-
ment. So a person cannot make excuses concerning, [ or disclaim responsi-
bility for ], his actions by ascribing their magnitude and measure to divine 
determining ( q a d a r  ) [ by claiming they are determined ].

T h e   E i g h t h :   The  creation  of  the  ḥ ā ṣ i l   b i ’ l - m a ṣ d a r   is  dependent  on  the 
‘acquisition’  of  the  verbal  noun  ( m a ṣ d a r  )  through  the  functioning  of  the 
divine laws in the universe ( ‘ ā d ā t   A l l ā h   t a ‘ ā l a  ) in accordance with the con-
ditions  He  has  laid  down  for  them.  And  the  nucleus  and  life  force  in  the 
acquisition  of  the  verbal  noun  is  inclination  ( m a y a l ā n  ),  and  when  this  is 
solved, the nub of the question is solved.

T h e   N i n t h :  Preference [ something being preferable ] without a cause or 
attribute to cause it is impossible, but choice without a cause or attribute to 
cause it is not impossible. Thus, no aim ( g h a r a ḍ  ) or cause ( ‘ i l l a  ) is neces-
sary in Allah’s actions; the only agent of choice ( m u r a j j i ḥ  ) is His will.

T h e   Te n t h :  An existent matter must necessarily have an effective agent 
( m u ’ a t h t h i r  )  [ to  bring  it  into  existence ],  otherwise  preference  without  a 
cause or attribute to cause it would be necessary, and this is impossible as 
shown above. However, a theoretical matter ( i ‘ t i b ā r ī  ) [ like human will and 
inclination ] can be speciﬁed ( t a k h a ṣ ṣ u ṣ  ) without a speciﬁer ( m u k h a ṣ ṣ i ṣ  ); 
this is not necessarily impossible. [ That is, since man’s inclinations do not 
have external existence, they do not require a cause. ]

T h e   E l e v e n t h :  A being has to be necessary for it to come in to existence; 
that is, a thing cannot come into existence if its existence is not necessary; its 
existence becomes necessary only on the conjunction of two wills, universal 
will and particular will; it then has existence instantaneously. But theoreti-
cal things can be preferable ( t a r a j j u h  ) and speciﬁed without reaching the 
degree of necessity, so this does not necessitate a contingent being coming 
into existence without an effective agent ( m u ’ a t h t h i r  ).

VERSE 7 – FREE WILL AND THE CREATION OF ACTIONS

81

T h e   Tw e l f t h :   The  knowledge  that  a  thing  exists  does  not  necessitate 
knowing its nature; and the absence of such knowledge does not necessitate 
its non-existence. So the inability to deﬁne the true nature of will does not 
contradict its certain existence.

If you have comprehended these principles, listen now to what shall be 
said: we Sunnis say: O Mu‘tazila! The bondsman [ of Allah ] is not creator 
of  the  ḥ ā ṣ i l   b i ’ l - m a ṣ d a r ;  that  is,  the  results  of  his  actions.  He  is  only  the 
masdar or source of his actions. For “ there is no effective agent in existence 
other than Allah. ” Divine unity ( t a w ḥ ī d  ) necessitates this. Now we say to 
the Jabriyya: man is not under compulsion for he has ( particular ) will ( j u z ’ 
i k h t i y ā r ī  ), for Allah is All-Wise. Moreover, Allah’s being exempt from all 
defect necessitates it.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Whenever man’s will is dissected, the only thing to 

appear is predestination ( a l - j a b r  )?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :
F i r s t l y :  The conscience and innate disposition both testify to something 
elusive that distinguishes between a voluntary matter and a compulsory one, 
and the existence of which is certain. But we are not at fault if we cannot 
deﬁne it.

S e c o n d l y :  We say that if inclination ( m a y a l ā n  ) is something existent, as 
the Ash‘ari’s claim, then the disposal of it is a theoretical matter and per-
tains to man. [ That is, switching the inclination from one act to another. ] 
1  But  if  inclination  is  a  theoretical  matter,  as  the  Maturidis  say,  its  exist-
ence ( t h u b ū t  ) and being speciﬁed ( t a k h a ṣ ṣ u ṣ  ) do not require a necessitating 
cause ( a l - ‘ i l l a   a l - t a m m a  ), so an inclination does not necessarily have to be 
acted upon. [ That is, very often no action occurs on the occurrence of an 
inclination. Thus, there is no compulsion. ] Think about this carefully!

I n  S h o r t :  The ḥ ā ṣ i l  b i ’ l - m a ṣ d a r  is dependent, in accordance with the laws 
of divine practice in the universe, on the maṣdar or source, the basis of which 
is inclination ( m a y a l ā n  ). And neither inclination itself, nor the disposal of 
it, has [ external ] existence so that being applied this way or that it should 
be a contingent being and need an effective agent, or that there should have 
been preference without something to cause it. Also, neither inclination nor 
the disposal of it is non-existent that it should not be amenable to being a 
condition for the creation of the ḥ ā ṣ i l   b i ’ l - m a ṣ d a r , or a cause of reward or 
punishment.

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Don’t pre-eternal knowledge and pre-eternal will 

pluck out free will and remove it?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e  

t o l d :   Knowledge  of  a  voluntary  action  does  not  negate 
the  will.  [ Because  the  effective  agent  is  power,  not  knowledge,  which  is 
dependent on what is known. ] 1

Also, pre-eternal knowledge is all-encompassing like the sky, it is not the 
beginning of a chain or the starting-point of past time so that effects should 
be erroneously ascribed to it in disregard of their causes. 

Also, knowledge is dependent on the thing known – that is, on how the 
thing is. Knowledge also encompasses it – so the measure and criteria of the 
thing known are not based on the principles of divine determining ( q a d a r  ).
Also, divine will does not look to the cause once and separately to the 
effect once, rendering the will and the cause ineffective. Indeed, it looks at 
once to cause and effect. In consequence, if for example one person kills 
another with a riﬂe and we posit the absence of any cause, would the person 
have died that instant or not? The Jabriyya say: he would have died even 
if he had not been killed. For they assert that divine will deals with cause 
and effect separately, and that there is a disjunction between them. And the 
Mu‘tazila say: he would not have died. For according to them, it is permissi-
ble that the effect ( lit. what is intended ) may ‘lag behind’ divine will. As for 
the Sunnis, they say: We discontinue [ the argument and ] are silent. For to 
assume the absence of any cause necessitates assuming that divine will and 
knowledge  are  unconnected  with  the  effect,  whereas  will  and  knowledge 
look to both together. This false assumption necessitates an impossibility. 
Think about this carefully!

A Second Introduction

A Second Introduction
Consider this: the Naturalists say that causes have an actual effect, the 
Zoroastrians say that evil has another creator, and the Mu‘tazila assert that 
living beings create their [ own ] voluntary actions. The three are based on a 
false, deluded idea, are pure error, exceed the mark, and are false analogies 
that have duped [ those people ] and led them astray. For proceeding from 
these assertions they have declared Allah free of anthropomorphic elements 
( t a n z ī h  ), or so they supposed, and have fallen into the trap of associating 
partners with Him ( s h i r k  ). If you want to learn the details, listen to the fol-
lowing matters, which also dispel their delusions.

VERSE 7 – FREE WILL AND THE CREATION OF ACTIONS

83

T h e   F i r s t :  Man’s hearing, speech, observation, and thought are all par-
ticular; he can attend to things only one at a time in succession. Similarly, 
his aspiration is particular; he can busy himself with things only in turn.

T h e   S e c o n d :  Man’s worth is proportionate to what he is. And what he 
is has value to the extent of his aspiration. And his aspirations are valuable 
relatively to the importance of the aims to which he devotes himself. 

T h e   T h i r d :  Man loses himself in whatever he turns his attention to and 
gets caught up in it. It is due to this that you see that in their daily lives, 
people  do  not  ascribe  lowly  things  and  insigniﬁcant  matters  to  great  and 
lofty persons, but to causes and intermediaries. They suppose that it would 
be unﬁtting for their dignity for them to be preoccupied with petty matters 
and that they would not condescend to such things, or expend their efforts 
on  things  of  no  consequence.  Such  trivia  would  be  unequal  to  their  vast 
ambitions.

T h e   F o u r t h :  It is characteristic of man that when he reﬂects on something 
in order to weigh it up, he ﬁrst of all seeks criteria for it and its relations and 
principles, in his own self; then in his fellow humans; and if he cannot ﬁnd 
them there, in other contingent beings around him. When he ponders over 
the Necessarily Existent, even, Who in no way resembles contingent beings, 
his surmising faculty ( a l - q u w w a   a l - w ā h i m a  ) forces him to take the above-
mentioned evil delusion as his principle, and use that deceptive analogy as 
a  telescope.  However,  the  Maker  ( May  His  glory  be  exalted )  cannot  be 
observed from this point, for His power cannot be restricted.

T h e   F i f t h :  ( 16:60 )  j  i  h His power, knowledge, and will ( May 
His glory be exalted ) are like the light of the sun; they embrace everything 
and  encompass  all  matters.  They  cannot  be  restricted  or  be  compared  with 
anything.  Just  as  they  look  to  ( t a ‘ a l l u q  )  the  vastest  things,  like  the  divine 
throne, so they look to the smallest, like an atom. And just as they create the 
sun and moon, so they create the eyes of the ﬂea and gnat. And just as they 
lay down the elevated order of the universe, so they place a ﬁne order in the 
guts of microscopic organisms. And just as they bind together the celestial 
bodies and stars, suspended [ in space ] by that law of His known as gravity, so 
they order minute particles through a similar law, as inﬁnitesimal samples of 
them. It is through the intervention of impotence that different degrees occur 
in power. So all things are equal in the face of the power of the One for whom 
impotence is impossible. For impotence is the opposite of essential power. 1

84

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

T h e   S i x t h :   Divine  power  looks  first  ( t a ‘ a l l u q  )  to  the  inner  face 
( m a l a k ū t i y y a  ) of things, and this in all things is transparent and beautiful, as 
discussed. Yes, just as the Most High made the face of the sun burnished and 
shining and the moon incandescent, so He made the inner face of the night 
and clouds luminous and beautiful. 

T h e   S e v e n t h :  The human mind does not have the breadth and scope to 
measure divine grandeur ( May He be exalted ), weigh up [ the Most High’s ] 
perfections,  or  to  judge  His  attributes.  This  is  not  possible  except  in  one 
respect 1 – they may be gauged only from the sum total of His artefacts, and 
from what is manifested of all His works, and from what may be epitomized 
from all His acts. Yes, an atom can only be a mirror, not the measure.

If  you  have  understood  these  matters,  know  that  the  Necessary  Being 
( Be He exalted ) cannot be compared with contingent beings, for they are 
as different from one another as are the ground and the Pleiades. Surely you 
can see that it was because of this false comparison, that with the Natural-
ists,  the  Mu‘tazila,  and  Zoroastrians  their  powers  of  delusive  imagination 
overpowered their reasons, and they ascribed an actual effect to causes, and 
the creation of acts to living creatures, and the creation of evil to one other 
than Allah ( May He be exalted! ). With their delusions and imaginings they 
asked how with His grandeur, sublimity, and freedom from defect ( tanaz-
zuh ) Allah ( May He be exalted! ) would condescend to [ create ] these base 
matters  and  ugly  things.  To  hell  with  them!  How  could  they  shackle  the 
intellect  with  such  a  feeble  delusion?  But  alas!  As  a  whispering  doubt,  it 
afﬂicts believers also. So be careful to avoid it!

Now to analyze the words of this verse and their positioning

The fact that - is tied to + * and follows [ immediately ] after it 
is just like making the punishment the consequence of the act, as though it is 
saying, “ Since they have corrupted their wills and not come to believe, they 
have been punished by having their hearts sealed and blocked up. ”

The word( s ) - also indicate a compound metaphor ( i s t i ‘ ā r a   m u r a k -
k a b a  ), which alludes to parabolic comparisons as a [ literary ] device ( u s l ū b  
t a m t h ī l ī  ), which [ in turn ] signiﬁes an allegory ( ḍ a r b  m a t h a l  ) depicting their 
misguidance, for what it means is the truth being prevented from penetrat-
ing to the heart. The term ‘seal or sealing’ ( a l - k h a t m  ) portrays the heart as

can attain knowledge of them through observation of the divine works.

a house built by Allah ( May He be exalted! ) to be a treasury full of jewels.

ﬁed, and what it contains has turned poisonous so it has been locked up and

The word ُ

sons. This comprises a subtle point pertaining to the intended ( b i ’ n - n i y y a  ) 
ّ(cid:195)اِ(cid:92) indi-
relationship of the word  ُ
cates  the  following  subtle  meaning:  when  the  light  of  the  knowledge  of 
Allah came to them, they did not open the door of their hearts to it, so He 
turned away from them angrily and locked the door on them.

ّ(cid:195)َا with + * I mean that the implied ِ

The use of  / with the transitive verb - suggests that the verb includes 
the meaning of branding, as though it is saying: Allah has set a seal on their 
hearts, branding and marking them so the angels see them. / also suggests 
that it is the heart’s lofty door that is blocked up, not its lowly door that looks 
onto this world.

The  word 0  precedes  hearing  and  sight  because  it  is  the  seat  of 
belief;  and  because  the  ﬁrst  evidences  of  the  Maker  are  manifested  from 
the heart’s consultation with itself, and from the conscience referring to the 
innate  disposition.  For  when  a  person  consults  himself,  he  feels  an  acute 
sense of powerlessness that drives him to seek out a point of support, and he 
perceives his clamouring need to fulﬁl his hopes and is compelled to ﬁnd a 
source of assistance. But there is no support to be found and no help except 
in belief.

What is meant by the heart is the dominical subtle faculty – not the piece 
of  ﬂesh  shaped  like  a  pine-cone  –  the  emotions  of  which  are  manifested 
in  the conscience and the thoughts of which are reﬂected in the mind. The 
term heart indicates that the dominical subtle faculty is to man’s spiritual 
dimensions what the cone-shaped piece of ﬂesh is to the body. For just as 
the physical heart is a life-machine that pumps the water of life to all the 
parts of the body, and if it is obstructed or ceases from activity, [ life departs 
and ] the body stiffens; so the subtle inner faculty dispenses the light of true 
life to all the parts of the corpus composed of man’s spiritual aspects, and 
his [ mental ] states, and hopes. And if, Allah forbid, the light of belief fades 
away, his being, with which he contends with the universe, becomes like a 
motionless spectre, dark in its entirety.

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

2 1  The  repetition  of  /  indicates  that  the  evidences  of  each 
[ faculty ] are independent, for the heart [ points to Allah ] with the evidences 
of the intellect and conscience, and the hearing [ points to Him ] with evi-
dences from the Qur’an and Hadith ( n a q l ī  ) and from the outside world. Its 
repetition also hints that the sealing up of the hearing is not of the same kind 
as the sealing up of the heart.

Moreover,  the  singular  case  of  “ hearing ”  despite  having  a  plural  on 
either side of it [ that is, the heart and the eyes ] is an instance of concise-
ness, and also contains several signs: it hints that as a verbal noun, [ the act 
of ] hearing ( s a m ‘  ) [ is performed with the ear, which ] has no cover [ like 
an  eyelid ];  and  that  the  one  making  hear  ( m u s m i ‘  )  is  singular;  and  that 
what is heard ( m a s m ū ‘  ) by each person is singular; and that a person hears 
one thing at a time. And it hints at the partnership of all who hear, as though 
their ears are united becoming one; and at the union of the community and 
its personiﬁcation, which makes one imagine that its faculty of hearing is 
singular; and that one person hearing something sufﬁces the community. 
It was on account of these points that eloquence required “ h e a r i n g  ” to be 
in the singular. However, the things pertaining to the heart and eyes are 
different, and their ways are diverse, and their evidences differ, and they 
receive instruction from different things, and the things that prompt them 
are various. For these reasons the singular intervenes between two plurals. 
The heart is followed by hearing because hearing forms the heart’s char-
acter [ that is, mostly information reaches the heart through the channel of 
the ear ], and it is closer to it. Also, the hearing resembles the heart in that 
it receives information from the six directions, [ from all sides, while the 
eyes only look to the front ]. 

6 5 4 Know that the change of style, that is, the choice of a 
nominal sentence, indicates that in distinction to the gardens of the hearing 
and heart, which are continuously renewed, the gardens of the eyes, from 
which they gather up evidences, are ﬁxed and constant. 

By ascribing the sealing up of the heart to Allah ( May He be exalted! ) 
and not the veiling of the eyes, it suggests that the sealing up is punishment 
for what they have earned, while the veiling is of their own doing. 

It is also a sign that initially in respect of the heart and hearing there is 
choice,  while  in  respect  of  the  sight  there  is  compulsion;  that  is,  there  is 
choice only to the extent of shutting one’s eyes.

VERSE 7 – THE SEALING-UP OF THE UNBELIEVERS’ FACULTIES

87

The term 6 indicates that the eyes look in only one direction. And 
the use of the indeﬁnite is to show this; that is, the cause of blindness is not 
known that it might be avoided.

The precedence of  5 4 is to direct attention to their eyes, for the 

eyes mirror the secrets of the heart.

: 9 8 : Know that just as the verse alludes with this phrase 
to the bitter fruits in this world of the accursed tree of unbelief; so it indicates 
the bitter fruit of that side of it that extends to the hereafter, which is the 
Zaqqum tree of Hell. 

Also, the style here requires a phrase like  ٌد(cid:192) ِدَ(cid:130)  ٌباَ(cid:163)ِ(cid:150) ْمِ(cid:183)ـْ(cid:193)َ(cid:171)َ(cid:150)َو . For in 
substituting words ﬁtting for bounties, that is, 8 for  ْمِ(cid:183)ـْ(cid:193)َ(cid:171)َ(cid:150)  and 9 
for  ٌباَ(cid:163)ِ(cid:150) and 9 for shadīd is a sign that it is a sort of insinuating, con-
demnatory mockery as though [ the Qur’an ] is saying: “ Their beneﬁt, their 
delight, their supreme bounty will be nothing but torment. ” This resembles 
the saying: “ Greetings between them will be a painful blow, ” and the verse 
( 3:21 ) È Ç Æ For the “ la-” of “la-hum – ( lit. ) t o   t h e m  ” denotes 
the consequences of the action and its beneﬁts, as though it is reading out to 
them [ mockingly ]: “ Receive the wages for what you have done! ” 

In  the  word 9  [ the  root  of  which  also  bears  meanings  of  sweet, 
pleasant, etc. ] is an obscure allusion reminding them that they sought pleas-
ure and delight in this world through sinful acts, as though announcing to 
them: “ Now taste the bitter [ fruits ] of your sweet life! ” 

And  in  the  word :  is  a  hidden  sign  reminding  them  of  the  state 
of [ the people of ] Paradise who receive stupendous bounties, as though it 
is whispering to them: “ See the vast bounties you have forfeited and how 
you have fallen into grievous suffering. : also strengthens the tanwīn 
( indeﬁniteness ) of  9

t o   a s k :   The  sin  of  unbelief  persists  a  short  time  but  its 
punishment  is  eternal  and  unending;  how  is  this  conformable  with  divine 
justice?  And  if  one  does  accept  this,  how  is  it  consistent  with  pre-eternal 
wisdom? And if one accepts this even, how does dominical compassion per-
mit it?

•  I f   y o u   w e r e  

88

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  If one accepts that the penalty is inﬁnite, it is estab-
lished  that  unbelief  perpetrated  in ﬁnite  time  is  in  six  respects  a  crime  of 
inﬁnite proportions:

F i r s t l y :  The person who dies an unbeliever will remain as such even if he 
lives to all eternity, for he has corrupted the very substance of his spirit. And 
his corrupted heart has the propensity to commit inﬁnite crimes.

S e c o n d l y :  Even if unbelief occurs in ﬁnite time, it is an inﬁnite crime and 
gives the lie to inﬁnity, I mean, it denies the whole universe, which testiﬁes 
to divine unity.

T h i r d l y :  Unbelief is ingratitude for inﬁnite bounties.
F o u r t h l y :  Unbelief is a crime against inﬁnity; that is, the divine essence 

and attributes.

F i f t h l y :  As [ indicated by ] the Hadith: “ The heavens and earth contain 
me not, yet I am contained in the heart of the believer, ”  1 the human con-
science is in regard to its outer face limited and ﬁnite, but by virtue of its 
reality the roots of its inner face spread and extend to eternity. In this respect 
therefore it is inﬁnite. Unbelief however sullies it and it dwindles away.

S i x t h l y :  Although opposites stubbornly resist each other, they are simi-
lar in many instances. Thus, on the one hand belief yields the fruits of the 
delights of Paradise, and on the other unbelief produces everlasting suffer-
ing and pain.

It may be concluded therefore if one puts these six aspects together that 

inﬁnite punishment ﬁts the inﬁnite crime and is pure justice.

•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  So it is conformable with justice, but what about 

wisdom, which is exempt from creating evils that result in punishment?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  As you have heard before, a greater good should not 
be  abandoned  due  to  the  interspersion  of  lesser  evil,  for  that  would  be  a 
greater  evil.  This  is  because  divine  wisdom  necessitates  the  existence  of 
relative  truths,  which  are  far  more  numerous  that  actual  truths;  and  their 
appearance is possible only through the existence of evil; and evil can be 
held within its limits and prevented from its aggression only through intimi-
dation; and intimidation only truly affects the conscience if it [ can be ] veri-
ﬁed and actualized by the existence of external torment; for like the intellect 
and imagination, the conscience is truly affected by intimidation only if it 

1.  Although reputed to be a Hadith Qudsi, this has no known ascription to the Prophet

VERSE 7 – THE PUNISHMENT FOR UNBELIEF

perceives from various indications the eternal, external reality of torment. 
It is pure wisdom therefore after ﬁlling people with fear at Hell-ﬁre in this 
world, for it to exist in the next.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  So it is consistent with divine wisdom also, but how 

does compassion permit it?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  The unbelievers can be thought of only in terms of 
non-existence or existence in torment. If you think it over in your conscience 
[ you will understand that ] existence, even if in Hell, is a mercy and better 
than non-existence. For if you analyze it carefully [ you will see that ] non-
existence is pure evil; indeed, non-existence is the source of all misfortunes 
and sins, whereas existence is pure good, even if in Hell. Furthermore, it is 
in the nature of man’s spirit, if it knows that the torment eliminates its crimes 
and sins, to be content with it, to alleviate the burden of shame. It will then 
acknowledge that the punishment is fair and that it deserves it. Out of its 
love of justice, it receives pleasure from it even. There are many honourable 
people in this world who long for the execution of justice so as to be saved 
from the shame of their crimes. 

[ The  unbelievers ]  go  to  Hell  and  abide  there  forever  as  their  per-
petual  abode,  but  after  some  time  paying  the  penalty  for  their  actions 
they grow accustomed to it in a way, even if they do not deserve this, and 
adapt to it. Also, their punishments are reduced and mitigated in many 
ways in recompense for their good deeds in this world, as is indicated in 
some Hadiths. These are instances of mercy for them, although they are 
not worthy of them.

The verse’s positioning in regard to what precedes it

Just as two parts of a sentence are joined by a conjunction because they 
both  contribute  to  what  is  being  stated,  and  two  clauses  or  sentences  are 
joined by a conjunction since they serve the same aim; so two stories are 
joined since they are both consistent with the same goal. The conjunction of 
the story of the dissemblers and that of the unbelievers is of this latter sort; 
that is, the summary of the following twelve verses is joined by a conjunc-
tion with the substance ( m a ’ ā l  ) of the previous two verses. For since the 
Revelation ( a l - t a n z ī l  ) opens with praise [ of itself ]: $ # it entails 
praise of the believers as the fruits of that book ( lit. praise ); and this in turn 
requires disparagement of their opposites, since “ things are known by their 
opposites. ” Then, to fulﬁl the purpose of guidance, it is ﬁtting to follow this 
with the dissemblers, so that all types of people should be included.

•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :   Why  does  it  deal  concisely  with  the  disbelievers 
and pure unbelief in two verses, and then deal at length with dissembling in 
twelve?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  For several subtle reasons:
F i r s t l y :  If unknown, an enemy is more harmful; and if he is elusive, he 
is more pernicious; and if he is mendacious, he causes more corruption; and 
if he is on the inside, he is more injurious. For an internal enemy saps one’s 
strength and crumbles one’s forces, contrarily to external enemies, for they 
strengthen resolve and solidarity. Alas! The harm dissembling has caused 
Islam is truly immense. It is the cause of the present confusion. For this rea-
son the Qur’an frequently condemns it. 

S e c o n d l y :  The dissembler mixes with the believers and becomes famil-
iar  with  them  to  an  extent,  and  grows  accustomed  to  belief  a  little.  He 
starts to feel repelled at his condition because his actions are reviled and 

90

VERSE 8 – THE DISSEMBLERS

91

condemned. Little by little the confession of divine unity trickles from his 
tongue to his heart.

T h i r d l y :  The dissembler surpasses the unbeliever in such crimes as mock-

ery, trickery, fraudulence, cunning, lying, and hypocrisy. 

F o u r t h l y :  The dissembler is usually one of the People of the Book, and 
a  diabolically  clever  scheming  swindler.  To  be  prolix  about  dissembling 
therefore is perfect eloquence.

Now to analyze the verse’s words: 
Consider this: In one respect = 
•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :   Isn’t  it  obvious  that  the  dissembler  is  one  of  the 

َﻦِﻣ is the preﬁxed predicate of   ْنَ(cid:174)

people?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  When a statement is obvious, what is intended is one 
of its necessary consequences, and here it is to cause astonishment. It is as 
though it is saying: It is extraordinary that the contemptible dissembler is a 
human being, for man is noble; it is not characteristic of him to stoop to such 
baseness.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Why is the predicate put ﬁrst?
Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Precedence is more apt for producing astonishment, 
and for concentrating attention on the subject, for that is where the aim [ of 
the sentence ] is found. Otherwise one might expectantly pass [ from the sub-
ject ] to the predicate [ and partially overlook the subject and aim ].
Several subtle points may be distilled from the expression =  :
F i r s t l y :  The Qur’an did not specify [ the dissemblers ] and expose them, 
indeed, it concealed them under the term = This indicates that shielding 
them and not lifting the veil from their repugnant faces was more consist-
ent with the Prophet’s policies ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). For 
if it had exposed them, the believers would have wavered, for no one is safe 
from the tricks of the soul, and doubts would have led to fear, and fear to 
hypocrisy, and hypocrisy to dissembling. Also, if attention had been drawn 
to their ugliness it might have been said that the Prophet ( UWBP ) was hesi-
tant and did not trust his followers. And sometimes, if corruption remains 
concealed it subsides by degrees and the one perpetrating it endeavours to 
hide  it.  But  if  the  veil  is  raised,  in  consequence  of  the  saying:  “ If  you’re 

92

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

shameless you can do as you like! ”, 1 he would exclaim, “ It doesn’t matter 
what happens!, ” and unconcernedly spread depravity. 

S e c o n d l y :  The term = indicates that quite apart from other attributes 
opposed to dissembling, the most general of attributes, I mean humanity, is 
contrary to it. For man is noble and such degradation is not characteristic 
of him. 

T h i r d l y :  It also infers that dissembling is not particular to any group or 

class, but is found in mankind generally, whatever the people.

F o u r t h l y :  The word hints that dissembling offends the honour of every-
one human and inevitably arouses their anger against the person, and drives 
them to restrict [ his activities ] to prevent the poison spreading. Similarly, it 
wounds the honour of the group, and the disgrace of its member excites [ its 
members’ ] rage against him.

@ ? >
• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Why although they both refer to the same person, is 

?  in the singular case, and @ in the plural?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  This indicates an exquisitely subtle point, which is 
that the ﬁrst person plural is singular [ to say: اَ(cid:178) is to speak as one ], and ? 
is singular because one person is speaking. But @ is plural because he is 
not alone in his belief.

Then  is  the  quotation  of  their  assertions:  this  form  of  literal  quotation 
indicates the rebuttal in two respects of what is quoted, in the same way that 
it indicates its forcefulness in two respects. For ? hints by its form that 
they  do  not  speak  out  of  conviction  or  [ in  consequence  of  their ]  actions, 
but  utter  with  their  mouths  what  is  not  in  their  hearts.  Also,  its  being  in 
the imperfect tense suggests that the reason for their continuing to defend 
themselves and make this claim is hypocrisy and not prompted by the con-
science. While their assertion @ being in the perfect tense suggests: “ All 
of us People of the Book, we have long since believed so why shouldn’t we 
believe now? ” And the pronominal sufﬁx “ -nā – we ” hints that they say: 

1.    This  is  based  on  a  Hadith  related  from Abū  Mas‘ūd  ‘Uqba  ibn  ‘Amr  al-Ansārī 
and cited by al-Bukhārī: “ One thing people have understood from the words of earlier 
prophethood is: ‘You can do you what you like so long as you feel no shame.’ ” al-Bukhārī, 
Ṣ a ḥ ī ḥ , iv, 215; al-Suyūṭī, a l - D u r a r   a l - M u n t a t h i r a , 35. See, Nursi, I s h ā r ā t   a l - I ‘ j ā z  [ Iḥsan 
Qāṣim ], 89; Badıllı, K u d s î   K a y n a k l a r ı , 812.

VERSE 8 – THE DISSEMBLERS

93

“ We are a community and have é s p r i t   d e   c o r p s ; we aren’t like an individual 
who may lie or be deceived. ”

C B A
Consider this: The Revelation either takes exactly what others have said, 
or taking its substance, puts in another form, or summarizes it. According to 
the ﬁrst of these, by mentioning the ﬁrst and last of the pillars of belief [ the 
dissemblers ] are demonstrating their ﬁrmness [ of belief ]. For in their view, 
these  pillars  are  the  most  acceptable.  And  by  repeating  [ the  preposition ] 
“ i n  ( b ā ’  ) ” despite the proximity [ of the two words ], they are alluding to 
the other pillars. Then according to the second [ possibility ], if it is the Most 
High’s word, by mentioning only these two poles of belief, it is indicating 
that what they claim to believe in most powerfully even is not belief. For 
their belief in them is not as it should be. And the repetition of the prepo-
sition  “ i n   ( b ā ’  ) ”  indicates  difference.  For  belief  in  Allah  is  belief  in  His 
existence and unity, and belief in the Last Day is belief in its reality and that 
it will come, as was discussed above. [ That is, belief in both is multifaceted 
and not only in one respect. ]

F E D
• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Why does the verse not say ‘and they do ( lit. did ) 
not believe اوُ(cid:179)َ(cid:174)ٰا اَ(cid:174)َو which would be similar [ in tense and form ] to @ ?
Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Lest it should be supposed that there is any incon-
sistency, if only in form. And so that the negation should not refer to @ 
which [ despite being a verb in the perfect tense ] is an exclamatory clause 
( j u m l a  i n s h ā ’ i y y a  ). Thus, its explicitness disallows its denial. Rather, 
the  negation  and  denial  refer  to  the  sentence  implicit  in @  which  is  
َنوُ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174)ْؤُ(cid:174) ُنْ(cid:111)َ(cid:179)َ(cid:158) . Furthermore, because this negative sentence is a nominal one, 
it infers that their unbelief is continuous. 

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Why doesn’t it indicate its non-continuance, since 

the negating particle mā comes at the beginning of the clause?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Negation is what is signiﬁed by the dense [ visible ] 
letter ( a l - ḥ a r f   a l - k a t h ī f  ), whereas continuance is signiﬁed by the light struc-
ture ( a l - h a i ’ a t   a l - k h a f ī f a  ) [ of the nominal clause ]. So the negation is closer 
to what is being expressed.

94

•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :   What  is  the  subtlety  in  [ the  preposition ] ( ب )  of 

“ F being used in the predicate of the negating particle اَ(cid:174) ?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e  

t o l d :   It  indicates  their  lack  of  ability  to  believe  even  if 
they [ appear to ] believe outwardly. It is the difference between اً

ّي ِ(cid:115)َ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) ٌدْ(cid:192)َز اَ(cid:174)  the  ﬁrst  refers  to  his  capricious 
( Zayd  is  not  generous )  and  ٍ
character, its meaning is Zayd is not actually being generous although he has 
the ability and is a generous person. While the second means, Zayd does not 
have the capacity to be magnanimous and is not a generous person, although 
he does good works.

The positioning [ of this verse and its relationship

Consider ﬁrst what the phrases indicate: Censure of dissembling; then 
condemnation of it; then denunciation of dissemblers as repugnant; then 
the  threatening  of  them;  then  intimidation  of  them;  then  amazement  at 
them; then an exposition of their aims as expressed above; then an expla-
nation of what made them say what they did; then a description of the ﬁrst 
of the four misdeeds arising from their dissembling, which are deception, 
corruption,  their  calling  the  believers  feeble-minded,  and  their  deriding 
them. Then a portrayal of their crimes and artiﬁces by means of a parabolic 
metaphor ( i s t i ‘ ā r a   t a m t h ī l i y y a  ). It is like this: it depicts their conduct in 
the face of Allah ( the Most High )’s injunctions and towards the Prophet 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) and the believers – their display-
ing belief for worldly ends despite inwardly disbelieving. It depicts how 
Allah, the Prophet and the believers act towards them, gradually enacting 
the precepts of the believers against them, although in Allah’s sight they 
are the most abominable disbelievers. Just like two people tricking each 
other,  or  a  hunter  and  his  prey:  the  prey  senses  the  hunter  on  emerging

may be illustrated as follows:

The  sequence  of  these  seven  phrases,  and  how  each  bears  on  the  next 

If you want to hold someone back from doing something and advise him 
against it, you say to him ﬁrstly: “ Hey you! You’re an intelligent person, 
you can see that this is impossible! And you’re fond of yourself, so you can 
understand how harmful it is! And you’re sensible too, so why can’t you tell 
the difference between what’s harmful and what’s beneﬁcial? Maybe you 
have no will, but at least admit that your character is corrupted. It is sick 
and distorts the truth and makes you think that what’s sweet is bitter. You’re 
searching for a cure, but it only increases your sickness and is no remedy. 
What you’re afﬂicted with resembles insomnia; you try to sleep, but it only 
upsets you and banishes your sleepiness. Or you resemble someone whose 
heart is assailed by worries and this excessive anxiety only compounds his 
ailment. Then you seek pleasure but it yields severe pain and leads to more 
terrible suffering, and that contains no pleasure at all. If you don’t come to 
your senses immediately and give up all this, nothing remains but to brand 
you on the snout with an ugly mark! Then everyone will know you and your 
corruption won’t spread among them!

In just the same way, in order to restrain the dissemblers, Allah the Most 
High says: “ F a i n   w o u l d   t h e y   d e c e i v e   A l l a h  ” I H rather than ‘Fain 
would they deceive the Prophet,’ [ also ] pointing out their stupidity. That is, 
how could they deceive the Prophet ( Upon whom be peace ) seeing that he 
is a Messenger from Allah the Most High? So their trickery reverts to Allah 
Himself, and it is impossible to trick Allah the Most High. To attempt the 
impossible is stupidity and such stupidity is only to be wondered at.

This is followed by O N M L to point out their foolishness. 
That is, “ There is no beneﬁt in what you are doing, only harm; and its harm 
will turn back on you, as though you were deceiving yourselves. ”

VERSE 9-10 – CONDEMNATION OF THE DISSEMBLERS

97

Following this is Q P to demonstrate their ignorance. That is, “ You 
ignorant people! You’re further astray than beasts or solid stones, for you 
can’t see the difference between beneﬁt and harm! ”

This is succeeded by U T S to show how contemptible they are, 
for their natures are corrupted. That is, if you don’t have wills, at least you 
should know the sickness for what it is, and that you are depraved. Indeed, 
dissembling and envy are sicknesses of the spirit, the mark of which is to 
distort the truth and change it so that you suppose sweetness to be bitter and 
bitterness to be sweet, and black to be white and white to be black; so don’t 
follow such a path! 

Then  it  adds: X W V  to  show  their  debasement.  That  is,  you 
want a remedy to be cured of your anger and envy, but they are ailments 
that will only increase your sickness. You are like a person who breaks one 
of his hands, and seeking revenge on someone strikes him with it, causing it 
multiple fractures. 

Next it says \ [ Z in order to threaten them. That is, if you are 
seeking pleasure through this dissembling of yours, it will give you nothing 
but ghastly suffering now, and result in more terrible suffering in the hereaf-
ter. It is not like other sins, which afford a sort of immediate paltry pleasure. 
Finally, it completes the section with _ ^ ] to brand them with 
the most repulsive stamp. That is, if you don’t come to your senses, and you 
haven’t come to your senses, the only solution will be for you to be paraded 
before the people for lying so that they do not put their trust in you and your 
sickness does not spread.

Now the positioning of the parts of the phrases relatively to each 
other

The  ﬁrst  phrase:  that  is, K J I H  The  use  of  the  term 
deception  to  describe  their  act,  and  of  the  imperfect  tense,  and  especially 
the third form of the verb, and particularly using the name of Allah in place 
of  the  Prophet,  and ? >  in  place  of    َنوُ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174)ْؤُ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)َا  all  point  explicitly  to 
the impossibility of their aim to deceive. It thrusts this impossibility before 
the  eyes,  making  people  abominate  it  and  shudder  at  it,  for  the  parabolic 
metaphor  ( a l - i s t i ‘ ā r a   a l - t a m t h ī l ī y y a  )  contained  in  the  word  ‘deception’ 
( a l - k h u d ā ‘  ) arouses revulsion. The heart too recoils at the descriptiveness 
of the imperfect tense and the continuance it infers. 

98

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

As in the verse,  ( 42:40 ) ﮯ ~ } | the reciprocity expressed 
by the use of the third form of the verb suggests that their deception will be 
fruitless. For in the third form of the verb, the act of the doer is a cause of the 
act of the one acted upon, and here the latter is a cause of the doer’s decep-
tion being fruitless and without effect; indeed, it shows their deception to be 
feeble and without substance, like turning the tables on someone. For exam-
ple, you mock someone supposing him to be unaware of it, but inwardly he 
knows and is secretly mocking you.

The name ُ

ّ(cid:195)َا states explicitly the impossibility of what they intend, for 
to deceive the Prophet ( Upon whom be peace ) entails deceiving Allah the 
Most High, and the reasoning faculty cannot accept such deception.

In the choice of  K J  rather than ‘the believers,’ that is, in the 
choice of the relative clause and the attribute of belief, is a sign that the dis-
semblers try to ingratiate themselves with the believers through the attribute 
of belief, exciting that vein of the believers in order to win their love so that 
they  can  insinuate  themselves  among  them.  It  suggests  too  that  since  the 
minds of the community of believers are illuminated with belief, the dissem-
blers’ deceptions are not hidden from them, which leads to those deceptions 
being fruitless.

The  second  phrase:  that  is,   O N M L  In  the  restriction 
expressed  by  “ o n l y  ”  is  a  sign  of  their  total  foolishness,  since  their  act 
rebounds on them. Like a person who throws a stone at a wall and it bounces 
back  and  cracks  his  skull.  For  they  let  ﬂy  arrows  at  the  believers  but  hit 
themselves, as though it were only themselves they had deceived.

And the replacement of  َنوُ

ّر ُ(cid:139)َ(cid:192) by M implies their utter foolish-
ness,  for  among  reasonable  people  one  may  be  found  who  intentionally 
harms  himself,  but  none  that  deliberately  deceives  himself,  unless  he  is  a 
complete donkey. 

And in the word O is a concealed sign that since their dissembling 
and artiﬁce are to gratify their instinctual souls and for selﬁsh reasons, they 
result in the reverse of what is being sought.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  The restriction [ to the dissemblers ] here implies that 
their deceptions cause no harm to Islam and the Muslims, but Islam has been 
harmed by nothing to the extent it has been harmed by the various sorts of 

ٰ
VERSE 9-10 – CONDEMNATION OF THE DISSEMBLERS

99

dissembling and their offshoots, which have spread like poison among the 
peoples of the Islamic world?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e  

t o l d :   The  aggressive  harm  you  see  and  that  contagious 
poison have spread like an infectious disease from their prurient characters, 
corrupted natures, and putrid consciences; it is not the result of the decep-
tions and tricks they have perpetrated through their wills. For they want to 
deceive Allah and the Prophet and the community of believers, but Allah has 
knowledge of all things and the Prophet is the recipient of revelation, and it 
is not possible for the deception to be hidden from the community of believ-
ers for any length of time, and they are not deceived. So it is established that 
it is only themselves that they deceive.

The  third  phrase: Q P   that  is,  they  do  not  perceive  or  are  not 
sensible  of:  This  succinct  phrase  ascribes  ignorance  to  them,  for  it  gives 
to understand that if they are intelligent beings, this is not characteristic of 
intelligence, and if they are animals and act on the impulses of the instinctual 
soul, they should sense and be aware of this palpable harm. Hence it is estab-
lished that they have come to resemble inanimate beings, devoid of will.

The  fourth  phrase: U T S  this  phrase  being  positioned  here 
states that since they do not act as required by the reasoning of the intellect 
and awareness of the senses, it is clear that they are suffering from a sick-
ness of the spirit. For at least they should know it is a sickness and avoid 
its attendant problems and not judge according to them. For such sickness 
alters the truth, distorts beauty, and shows what is bitter to be sweet, as has 
been described. 

The preposition S hints that their envy and hatred are sicknesses afﬂict-
ing the inward dimensions of their hearts, the heart being a subtle dominical 
faculty, as discussed.

And in the term ‘heart’ ( q a l b  ) is an indication that just as a disease of 
the physical heart disturbs the functioning of all the body, so when what the 
heart signiﬁes is sick with deception and dissembling, all the functions of 
the spirit are deﬂected from the straight path, for the heart in this sense is the 
source of life and its machine. 

And T S  preceding  ٌضَرَ(cid:174)  bears  the  meaning  of  restriction  in  two 
respects:  by  way  of  allusion  it  indicates  that  belief  is  a  light  which  gives 
health and right direction to all man’s actions and works. Secondly, it infers 
that their corruption is fundamental so it is of no avail to repair minor matters. 

100

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

The word  ٌضَرَ(cid:174) allusively confutes their excuses and rams them down 
their throats. For man’s innate disposition inclines naturally to the truth; cor-
ruption and destruction are sicknesses and accidental ( ‘ ā r i ḍ  ).

And in the use of the indeﬁnite is a sign that the disease is so deep-seated 

that it is not possible to either see it or cure it.

The ﬁfth phrase: that is, X W V : When they do not recognize 
the disease or avoid it, but chase after it applauding it, Allah increases it, for 
“ whoever seeks will ﬁnd. ”

In the ف [ of   َداَزَ(cid:158)   ], which expresses purpose, – although the existence 
of the sickness is not a reason for its increase – is a sign that since they do 
not identify the disease, nor seek a means of curing it, indeed, take steps to 
aggravate it like someone who strikes a superior enemy with a broken hand, 
it seems they are seeking its increase. So Allah increases it by transform-
ing their hopes into oppressive despair, due to the triumph of the believers, 
and transforms their enmity into burning hatred in their hearts, because the 
believers prevail. So there arise from the diseases of hatred and despair, the 
sickness of fear and ailment of weakness and illness of degradation, all of 
which overwhelm their hearts.

Allah the Most High did not say ْمُ(cid:183)َ(cid:138)َرَ(cid:174) ُ

ّ(cid:195)ا َداَزَ(cid:158) but X W V  and 
made the pronominal sufﬁx the object and “ d i s e a s e  ” speciﬁcatory ( t a m y ī z  ) 
in  order  to  indicate  that  the  inner  sickness  of  the  heart  has  spread  to  the 
outside, contaminating all they do. It is as if this malignant disease has cov-
ered all their bodies, which have become the disease itself. The suppurating 
blisters of the illness become an additional body for them. Like the saying 
اًراَ(cid:178)  ُتْ(cid:193)َ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا  َلَ(cid:151)َ(cid:99) ْ(cid:130)ِا which infers that ﬁre has enveloped the whole house and it 
is all ablaze; as opposed to  ِتْ(cid:193)َ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا ُراَ(cid:178)  ْتَ(cid:171)َ(cid:151)َ(cid:99) ْ(cid:130)ِا which states that a part of it has 
caught ﬁre.

The sixth phrase: that is, \ [ Z The ل ( of “  

ْمُ(cid:183)َ(cid:170)  –   t h e i r s  ” ), 
which denotes beneﬁt, indicates that if they are to receive beneﬁt, it would 
deﬁnitely be [ in the form of ] grievous suffering in this world or painful tor-
ment in the next. Now it is impossible that these should be beneﬁts, so it is 
impossible they should receive them. While the word [ being qualiﬁed 
by \ meaning ‘in pain, suffering’ ( m u t a ’ a l l i m  ), which usually refers to 
people, hints that the torment has overwhelmed their bodies and enveloped 

ٰ
VERSE 9-10 – CONDEMNATION OF THE DISSEMBLERS

101

their persons and suffused their inner beings, so that they have become tor-
ment and the torment has become identical with them, like red-hot coals turn 
into burning embers when consumed by ﬁre. If one beholds the torment with 
one’s  imagination  and  hears  the  agonized  wailing  and  moaning  on  every 
side arising from the perpetually renewed life of torture, it seems as though 
it is the torment itself that is wailing and groaning. What a terrible warning 
for those who think!

The seventh phrase: that is, _ ^ ] By attributing the above-
mentioned  penalty  for  their  crimes  to  lying  alone,  it  is  indicating  the  atro-
ciousness  of  lying,  and  its  ugliness  and  loathsomeness.  This  indication  tes-
tiﬁes  truthfully  to  the  severe  effects  of  the  poison  of  lying,  for  lying  is  the 
basis  of  unbelief;  indeed,  unbelief  is  a  falsehood  and  the  worst  sort  of  lying, 
and  it  is  the  chief  sign  of  dissembling.  Lying  is  to  slander  divine  power  and 
it  is  the  opposite  of  dominical  wisdom.  Lying  destroys  high  morals.  It  trans-
forms  great  enterprises  into  putrifying  corpses.  Its  poison  has  spread  through 
the Islamic world. It has overturned the affairs of mankind, and held back the 
world  of  humanity  from  attaining  its  perfections,  and  prevented  its  advance 
and  progress.  It  has  cast  down  the  likes  of  Musaylima  the  Liar  to  the  lowest 
of the low. It is a heavy burden on man’s back hindering him from achieving 
his  aims.  It  is  the  progenitor  of  hypocrisy  and  artiﬁciality.  These  are  the  rea-
sons it has been speciﬁed by that which was revealed from above the Sublime 
Throne,  and  why  it  is  execrated  and  made  the  object  of  threats.  So  you  peo-
ple, and especially you Muslims! This verse calls on you to note it carefully.
• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Isn’t lying excusable if for some good purpose?
Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  – If to lie is imperative and its advantages are certain. 
But what they call good reason is [ generally ] a false excuse. For it is stipu-
lated by the science of the principles of the Shari‘a that because a matter that 
is not determinable or quantiﬁable is open to exploitation, it cannot be made 
the basis of rulings. For example, since the hardship involved in performing 
the ṣ a l ā t  while on a journey is undeterminable, it is not the reason for their 
being shortened; the reason is the journey. And if we accept that the harm of 
a thing outweighs its beneﬁts, a ruling is given to abrogate it and its beneﬁt 
lies  in  its  non-existence.  The  anarchy  and  disorder  in  the  world  testify  to 
the overwhelming harm of the pretext of beneﬁt. But hinting and allusions 
are not lying. The way is twofold: either silence, for truthfulness does not 
demand that one says everything that is true; or honesty, for truthfulness is 
the basis of Islam and a characteristic of belief; indeed, belief is truthfulness 

102

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

and its main sort. [ Truthfulness ] is the bond of all perfections; and the life 
of high morals; and the root binding things to reality; and the manifestation 
of truth on the tongue. It is the pivot of man’s development and the order of 
the Islamic world; and it is what conveys man with the speed of lightning 
down the road of progress to the k a ‘ b a  of perfections; and it raises the poor-
est and dullest person higher than a sultan; and it made the Companions of 
the Prophet ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) superior to all others; and 
it raised up our Master Muhammad al-Hāshimī ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ) to the loftiest peak of humanity.

Verses 11-12 

l k j i h g f e d c b a

s r q p o n m
Consider the positioning of these verses in regard to the preceding 
ones

Allah the Most High mentions the ﬁrst of the crimes arising from their 
dissembling: their wronging themselves and transgressing His rights ( ḥ u q ū q  
A l l ā h  ),  together  with  the  successive  consequences  mentioned  above,  and 
then  He  follows  this  with  the  second  of  their  crimes:  their  trampling  the 
rights of His servants and their spreading corruption, and its results.
[ The phrase ] b B is linked by virtue of the story to ?  in 

? > = < and by reason of its meaning to ( 2:9 ) H  so too, by 
virtue of itself it is linked to ( 2:10 ) _

The  change  from  a  categorical  to  a  conditional  clause  is  an  indication 
and concealed sign of the clause implicit between them. It is as though it is 
saying: “ Theirs is a grievous penalty for what they give the lie to; for when 
they lie they cause dissension, and when they cause dissension they cause 
corruption; and if they are admonished they do not accept it, and if they are 
told: don’t spread corruption... and so on. ”

The positioning of the verses’ phrases, both explicit and implicit

It is exactly the same as the order and linkages in the example that I shall 

now give you: 

If you see someone who has taken a road leading to perdition, you ﬁrst of 
all warn him, saying: “ This way will be the ruin of you; don’t take it! ” If he 
does not avoid it using his own intelligence, you will renew your efforts to 
restrain him by forbidding and upbraiding him, and you will reinforce this 
and instil it in his brain either by scaring him with the threat of universal 
condemnation,  or  by  softening  his  heart  by  inculcating  fellow  feeling,  as 
will be explained to you below. 

103

104

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

If the person is obstinate, persistent, recalcitrant, and mounted on com-
pounded ignorance, he will not be silent but will defend himself. For it is 
characteristic of corrupters to look on their corruption as good and useful. 
For by nature, man does not perpetrate iniquitous acts thinking they are iniq-
uitous.  He  will  offer  evidence  that  his  way  is  right,  claiming  that  this  is 
well known and that you have no right to admonish him and that he has no 
need for your advice. Rather, you need to learn about his way. For the only 
smooth path is his and you should not attack the better way. 

And  if  that  obdurate  person  is  two-faced,  he  will  also  have  a  forked 
tongue. On the one hand, he will try to divert the person admonishing him 
and silence him, and on the other he will defend his way saying: “ Outwardly 
I put things to rights as you wish, and inwardly as I believe. ” Then to cor-
roborate what he claims, he says: “ Putting things to rights is something I’ve 
always  done;  it  isn’t  that  I  now  do  good  works  having  previously  spread 
corruption. ” 

And if that obdurate, Nimrod-like person persists in spreading his way 
and declaring the admonisher a liar and making insinuations against the peo-
ple of truth to this extent, it is clear that the medicine has no effect on him. 
Only one remedy remains and that is to put him into quarantine. This treat-
ment consists of warning people and informing them that he is a corrupter, 
not a doer of good, for he does not use his head or employ his intelligence 
that he might grasp this matter, which is so obvious and palpable.

If you have understood the links enumerated in the above example [ that 
is, the progression of the argument ], you will have grasped the links between 
the phrases, both stated and alluded to, in this verse from c b a to the 
end. For their order is so natural and succinct ( ī j ā z  ) that the miraculousness 
glows from beneath it [ like live coals ].

The order and positioning of the parts of the phrases
Consider this: the deﬁniteness expressed by B in 

g f e d c b a  denotes  the  necessary  obligation  of  ‘forbid-
ding what is unlawful.’ 

The passive form of b indicates that such prohibition is encumbent on 

all ( f a r ḍ   k i f ā y a   ‘ a l ā   a l - u m ū m  ). 

In the ل of c  is a sign that the prohibition must be in the form of 

advice, not coercion; and through persuasion rather than by force. 

VERSE 11-12 – THE DISSEMBLERS’ SPREADING OF CORRUPTION

105

e d is a summary in the form of a conditional syllogism; that is, 
“ do not do that, for it will lead to anarchy. Relations [ requiring ] obedience 
will be severed, justice and its system will be thrown into disorder, the bonds 
of unity will be broken, and this will lead to corruption. So don’t do it lest 
you cause corruption. ”

The  phrase g f  corroborates  and  perpetuates  the  prohibition,  for 
[ its effect ] is temporary. The admonition therefore has to ﬁx it permanently 
in  the  brain  of  the  one  addressed  by  appointing  his  conscience  to  always 
restrain him from beneath. This is either by exciting his vein of fellow feel-
ing, or by arousing his desire to ﬂee from public disgust. g f arouses 
these two veins, for the phrase addresses [ the dissemblers ] saying: “ This 
depravity of yours spreads through mankind. Why do you feel such hatred 
and anger at all the people, some of whom are innocent, or poor, or unknown 
by you? Why don’t you feel sorry for them and pity them? We can see you 
have no sympathy for your fellow men, but at least you should realize that 
this action of yours attracts their loathing. ”

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Which of [ the dissemblers’ ] objectives looks to the 

people at large? How can their depravity spread to everyone? 

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :   Just  as  everything  appears  dark  and  ugly  to  a  per-
son who looks through a dark lens, so everything appears hateful and odi-
ous to the person whose sight is veiled by dissembling and whose heart is 
corrupted by unbelief. His heart is full of malice towards all men, indeed, 
all beings, and he stubbornly opposes them. Furthermore, if one tooth of a 
ﬂywheel in the workings of a clock is damaged, the clock is affected either 
wholly or partially. Similarly, mankind’s order is affected by one person’s 
dissembling, for it is set in order through justice, Islam, and obedience. Alas! 
[ The  dissemblers’ ]  continuously  scattered  poisons  have  accumulated  and 
resulted in the present ignominy. 
k j i h 
In the substitution of “ t h e y   a n s w e r  ( lit. say ) h  for ‘they do not accept 
ّ(cid:179)(cid:170)ا َنوُ(cid:171)َ(cid:93)ْ(cid:163)َ(cid:192)  َ(cid:202) which would have been appropriate in the context, 
advice’ َةَ(cid:111)(cid:193) ِ(cid:135)َ
is an indication that they are making presumptuous claims and calling others 
to their way. 

i   [ the restrictive particle, meaning only or but ], possesses two char-

acteristics:

106

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

T h e   F i r s t :  The phrase in which it is included has necessarily to signify 
something known, either in reality or allegedly. Thus, it infers depreciation 
of the one offering advice, as well as their [ the dissemblers’ ] persisting in 
their compounded ignorance.

T h e   S e c o n d :   The  restriction  of  “ but ”  indicates  that  in  their  view  their 
improving things is unadulterated by corruption. And this is an insinuation 
against the believers [ who say the opposite ].

The  use  of  the  active  participle  in  “ ( lit. )  i m p r o v e r s  

t h i n g s   ]  
k  ” rather than the verbal form ‘we are making improvements, set-
ting in order, etc.’ indicates that [ they allege that ] this attribute of theirs is 
constant and continual and that what they are doing is total betterment. But 
they are dissimulating in saying this also, for what they profess inwardly is 
the opposite of what they profess outwardly: inwardly they claim their cor-
ruption to be improving things, and outwardly they hypocritically claim that 
what they do is for the betterment of the believers and in their interests. 

[   o f  

s r q p o n m
Consider this: The previous verse inferred a number of things about the 
dissemblers:  for  example,  their  spreading  their  ideas,  and  claiming  that 
they consistently put things to rights and that this is a constant attribute of 
theirs, and is conﬁned to them; and that their bettering things is untouched 
by corruption; that this is clear and well known; and their casting asper-
sions  on  the  believers  and  imputing  ignorance  to  those  who  offer  them 
advice. Here, the Qur’an replies to them with the present sentence, which 
comprises  elements  proving  their  corruption  and  that  they  have  become 
one with it; that corruption is restricted to them, and that this is an estab-
lished fact, and warning the people against them, and showing them to be 
ignorant by disallowing them any senses, as though they were inanimate. 
If you wish, consider the following: 

The [ intensifying interjection ] m is for alerting or warning: See how 
with its warning it declares false all their propaganda, which is alluded to by 
the word( s ) h 

The [ intensifying particle ] [ which is for veriﬁcation: See how it refutes 
their well-known claims, indicated by i   It is as though the [ is saying 
that in reality their inner state is one of corruption, so their outwardly being 
righteous will not proﬁt them.

The restrictive meaning of the personal pronoun ﻢ ﹸﻫ counters the insinu-

ations implicit in j and k i

The deﬁnite article in p which signiﬁes that you see in them the 
quintessence  of  those  who  cause  corruption  and  that  they  are  in  essence 
depravity – see how this contradicts the restriction expressed by i 

And s r q    how  it  contradicts  their  declaring  false  the  one 
admonishing them and their claim that they are not in need of advice, since 
their assertions [ about what they are ] are known.

Verse 13 

 ¢ ¡ ﮯ ~ } | { z y x w v u

The positioning of this verse and its relationship
with the previous one

Consider this: In so far as these two verses ( 2:11, 2:13 ) consist of advice 
and guidance; the enjoining of what is lawful, adornment ( a l - t a ḥ l ī y y a  ), and 
encouragement [ in the present verse ] are linked to the prohibiting of what is 
unlawful, puriﬁcation ( a l - t a k h l ī y y a  ), and intimidation in the previous one. 
And in so far as they both describe [ the dissemblers’ ] crimes, their decrying 
the believers and pride [ in the present verse ] are linked to their mischief-
making ( i f s ā d  ) in the previous one. Just as their mischief-making is tied to 
their depravity ( f a s ā d  ), every sort of which is a branch of the Zaqqum tree 
of dissembling.

The relationships between the verse’s phrases

Consider  this:  With  the  sentence  { z y x w v u  [ the 
verse ] ﬁrst suggests with its parts the obligation of calling to sincere belief 
in  emulation  of  the  mass  of  the  people,  who  are  genuine  [ believers ],  for 
indeed the conscience perpetually urges them to do this. It then quotes [ the 
dissemblers’ retort ]: ¡ ﮯ ~ } | indicating their [ pique, ] obdu-
racy  and  pride,  and  their  insistence  on  their  rightness.  Yes,  all  liars  look 
on  the  false  as  true  and  think  their  ignorance  is  knowledge.  For  [ the  dis-
semblers’ ]  hearts  have  been  corrupted  by  dissembling,  and  pride  and  the 
tendency  to  corrupt  spring  from  depravity,  and  because  of  this  they  have 
grown obdurate. Due to their corruption, they secretly confabulate and plan 
to lead others astray. And in their pride, they consider fervent religiosity and 
perfect belief, the cause of independence and contentment, to be ignominy, 
foolishness, and indigence. 

Moreover, because of their duplicity, they dissemble when saying this, 
also. For outwardly they say: “ How should we be like the weak-minded, for 
we aren’t mad? We are as superior as you could wish. ” While inwardly they 

108

VERSE 13 – THE DISSEMBLERS’ CONTEMPT FOR THE BELIEVERS

109

say: “ How could we be like the believers, for most of them are paupers? In 
our eyes they are the dim-witted rabble of different nations. ” 

You can now supply the ﬁne points to the two parts of this conditional 

sentence.

The Qur’an then hurls back at them the stone they ﬂung at the believers, 
ramming  it  down  their  throats: ¦ ¥ ¤ £    For  whoever  is  obsti-
nate to this degree and ignorant without realizing it, deserves to be paraded 
among  the  people  and  proclaimed  the  feeble-minded  one,  for  this  is  an 
established fact, and their calling the believers weak-minded is due to their 
own feeble-mindedness. 

Then by saying: © ¨ § it is pointing out that their ignorance is 
compounded because they are unaware of it. It is therefore useless to offer 
them advice; they should be shunned entirely. For it is only those who real-
ize that they are ignorant that may beneﬁt from advice.

The positioning of [ and relationships between ] the phrases’ parts

{ z y x w v u
In this phrase, the certainty expressed by the word B indicates the neces-

sity of offering guidance [ to the people ] by ‘enjoining what is lawful.’

v The passive mood infers that offering advice is an obligation [ that 
may  be  performed  by  a  number  of  people  in  the  name  of  the  community 
( ‘ a l ā   s a b ī l   a l - k i f ā y a  ) ], as has been mentioned.

The use of the verb x rather than ْمـﯭﯧِ(cid:178)ا َ(cid:175)(cid:192)ِا ىِ(cid:158) او ُ(cid:135)ِ(cid:171)ْ(cid:114)َا indicates that 

insincere belief is not belief.

The phrase z y is an allusion to the ﬁne  examples of admirable men, 

suggesting that sincerity may be attained by following them.

The  word {  contains  two  points,  which  induce  the  conscience  to 
always enjoin the good. For ¡ ﮯ ~  intimates: “ Follow the mass of 
the people, for to oppose them is an error that the heart is not so bold as to 
commit. ” 

Secondly, it infers that those who do not believe should not be counted 
as true men; only believers are true human beings, as though the others are 
human  only  in  form.  For  the  believers  have  advanced  in  perfections  and 
true humanity is particular to them, and the rest have fallen from the level 
of humanity.

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

The phrase: ¡ ﮯ ~ } | has this meaning: “ We don’t accept 
advice. How could we be like those lowly wretches? How can we people of 
standing be put on a par with them? We look on them as dim-wits? ” 

Thus, the word | hints at their self-justiﬁcation, their spreading their 

views, their disdain for advice, and their arrogance and presumption.

The rhetorical question } indicates their obstinately sticking to their 
ignorant views. As though, using the interrogative form, they are saying to 
the one advising them: “ Consult your conscience! Can you in all fairness 
accept that we reject [ religion ]? ”

Moreover, |  contains three consecutive aspects; that is: ﬁrst of all they 
address themselves, then their fellows, then the one offering them guidance, 
for it is usual when offered advice for a person ﬁrst of all consult himself, 
then  his  fellows,  then  to  refer  back  to  you  with  the  results  of  his  reason-
ing. Hence, when they are told what was said, they examine their corrupted 
hearts and rotten consciences and are shown the way of denial. What they 
say is an interpretation of what is in their hearts. Then with a view to mak-
ing  mischief  they  refer  to  their  brothers,  and  are  again  shown  the  way  of 
denial, and they begin holding secret confabulations. Then by way of mak-
ing  excuses  and  to  mislead  they  turn  back  to  the  one  giving  them  advice 
and say provocatively: “ The difference between us is so great we can’t be 
compared with them. They are poor and have to be strong in religion and 
Suﬁsm; they simply have to be like that. But we are people of high rank and 
standing. ” In their arrogance they call on the one offering them advice to be 
fair, and as a ruse and stratagem say deceitfully: “ Don’t  suppose us to be 
feeble-minded; you shouldn’t imagine we’re people like that! No, we act as 
sincere believers act. ” However, inwardly they say: “ We aren’t like those 
impoverished, worthless believers, ” which is an oblique hint at their deprav-
ity and spreading of corruption and their arrogance and duplicity. 

¡ ﮯ ~  that is, “ You suppose the believers to be the people of per-
fection, but in our view they are contemptible mendicants. They’re forced to 
turn to religion. They’re worthless for all their numbers. They’re the riff-raff 
of other nations. ”

Their claiming that there can be no comparison between them indicates 
that Islam is the refuge of the downtrodden, the recourse of the poor, the 
defender of truth, and the preserver of right, the preventer of arrogance, and 
the restrainer of pride; it is the only measure of perfection and distinction.

VERSE 13 – THE DISSEMBLERS’ CONTEMPT FOR THE BELIEVERS

111

The  dissemblers’  claim  to  be  different  also  points  to  the  cause  of  dis-
sembling, which for the most part is self-interest, pride, and arrogance, as is 
explained by the verse, 

( 11:27 ) º ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´ ³ ² ±
 º ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´ ³ ² ±
It is also a concealed sign that Islam cannot be made an instrument of 
domination and oppression in the hands of the worldly and high-ranking; it 
is rather a means of upholding right at the disposal of the poor and needy, 
contrarily to other religions. History testiﬁes to this. 

¦ ¥ ¤ £ 
Consider this: The sole reason for the Qur’an’s vigorous assaults on dis-
sembling and its condemnation of it is that its various kinds have been the 
cause of most of the calamities visited on the Islamic world.

The interjection £ is to attract attention and publicize their folly and call 
on public opinion to testify to it. The real meaning of £ is “ Don’t you know 
that they’re weak-minded? That is, you ought to know! ” 

The intensifying particle [ acts as a mirror to the truth and is a means 
to it, as though it were saying: “ Refer to the truth and understand that their 
outward sophistries are baseless. ”

The pronoun 

ﹾﻢ ﹸﻫ infers restriction [ to themselves ] and [ its purpose ] is to 
reject their self-justiﬁcation and repulse their imputation of feeble-minded-
ness to the believers, indicated by ¡ ﮯ ~ That is, the weak-minded 
are those people who give up [ working for ] the hereafter at the behest of 
their  pride  and  self-interest  and  ﬂeeting  pleasures,  unlike  those  who  earn 
eternal life by giving up their ephemeral desires. 

The deﬁnite article  ْلا of  ¦ indicates that it is a known fact that they 
are weak-minded. It also denotes completeness; that is, theirs is complete 
weak-mindedness. 

© ¨ §
This contains three indications:
T h e   F i r s t :   Knowledge  and  consideration  ( n a ẓ a r  )  are  necessary  to  dis-
tinguish between truth and falsehood and differentiate between the way of 
the believers and that of the dissemblers, unlike [ the dissemblers’ ] corrup-
tion and dissension, which can be perceived by those of least intelligence.

For this reason, [ as this verse is concluded with the phrase, s r q  ], 
the previous verse has appended to it the phrase, s r q

T h e   S e c o n d :  © 3 like similar phrases at the ends of verses such as

reason,  wisdom,  and  knowledge.  It  is  characterized  by  being  acceptable 
by all sound minds, unlike other religions, which are based on blind imita-
tion and bigotry. This indication presages well [ for Islam ], as is discussed 
elsewhere.1

َ(cid:202)  and  َنوُرَ

T h e   T h i r d :  One should avoid [ the dissemblers ] and not concern oneself

of it.

The relationship of these verses’ meaning with that 
of the previous one

This consists of the linking [ by means of the conjunction “ and ” ] of the 
dissemblers’ fourth crime; that is, their mockery and scorn, with their previ-
ous crimes; that is, their accusing the believers of weak-mindedness, their 
spreading corruption, and their depravity. 

The positioning of the phrases constituting these verses
[ and the relationships between them ]

Belief,  as  a  prop  and  support  in  the  face  of  suffering  and  a  source  of 

assistance for realizing one’s hopes, possesses three essential properties:

T h e   F i r s t :  Self-respect, which arises from having such a support, and the 

mark of which is not to lower oneself by being abject and servile.

T h e   S e c o n d :  Compassion, the mark of which is not to abase others or be 

contemptuous of them.

T h e   T h i r d :   Respect  for  the  truth  and  knowledge  of  its  worth.  For  the 
person who possesses something of high value possesses the truth; he owns 
a unique jewel and will not be scornful of the truth. For he is also digniﬁed.
Similarly, the opposite of belief, that is, dissembling, has three character-
istics, the reverse of those of belief: obsequiousness, the desire to corrupt, 
and arrogance leading to contempt of others.

If you have recognized these, then know that dissembling causes a person 
to be obsequious, which results in his abasement; in this he is hypocritical, 
which means he is sycophantic, which is lying. This is indicated by 

 ± ° ¯ ® ¬ «

Moreover, dissembling corrupts the heart, and this makes the spirit feel 
orphanlike; that is, its being without owner, protector, or lord; and this gives 

113

114

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

rise to fear, which makes such people resort to hiding themselves away. This 
is indicated by ³ ²

Also, dissembling causes a person to sever relations with his relatives, 
and this extinguishes his compassion, and its extinction leads the person to 
mischief-making, which leads to dissension, and this to treachery, and this 
to weakness, which compels him to seek a supporter and helper. And this is 
indicated by the phrase μ ´

Then, because dissembling is wavering ignorance, it causes [ the dissem-
blers ] to vacillate, which leads to their instability, and then to their having 
no  outlook,  and  then  to  their  not  being  trusted,  and  this  compels  them  to 
continually renew their agreements. This sequence of events is indicated by  

¹ ¸ ¶
Then,  feeling  the  need  to  make  excuses,  out  of  their  ﬁckleness  they 
attach no importance to the truth. Because of their own worthlessness, they 
depreciate its high value. Due to their own abasement, they disdain elevated 
things. And in their weakness, they are carried away by pride. The Qur’an 
alludes to this with the words: ¼ » º ¹ ¸ ¶

While expecting from this line of reasoning that the believers will reply to 
[ the dissemblers ], the listener sees that Allah the Most High replies to them 
in their stead. This indicates Allah’s honouring the believers and implies that 
their mocking the believers is nothing compared with Allah the Most High’s 
punishment of them. It indicates too their stupidity and that they deserve to 
be rejected and turned away, for how can the person who has Allah as his 
protector be mocked? So the Most High says: À ¿ ¾ That is, He will 
punish them severely for their mockery by causing them to be continously 
derided and scorned in this world and the next.

And  the  phrase Ä Ã Â Á  speciﬁes  what  form  [ Allah’s ] 

mocking [ will take ], the punishment for their mockery.

sycophancy. 

Consider  this:  The  phrase  ± ° ¯ ® ¬ «  denotes  their 

The  certainty  expressed  by  B  infers  deﬁniteness,  deliberateness,  and 

intention. That is, they deliberately intended to meet the believers. 

VERSE 14-15 – ABOUT THE DISSEMBLERS 

115

The verb ¬ indicates that they intended to encounter the believers on 

thoroughfares in the midst of the people.

The use of the phrase ¯ ® in place of َنوُ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174)ْؤُ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)َا indicates that [ the 
dissemblers ] have direct contact with them and that they are in touch with 
each other, and that the reason for their relations is belief, and that belief is 
the most outstanding of the believers’ attributes. 

The word ° hints that they say with their mouths what is not in their 
hearts, and that what they say demonstrates their artiﬁciality, hypocrisy, and 
sycophancy, and that they say it to rebuff accusations and avidly attract [ to 
themselves ] the believers’ advantages and so that they might pry into their 
secrets.

The word ± not being in the intensive [ or corroborative – b i l ā   t a ’ k ī d  ) 
form although the sense requires it, and its being a verbal clause, indicate that 
there is no passion or incentive in their hearts driving them to be steadfast 
in what they say. The non-use of the intensive also indicates their strenuous 
rebuttals of the accusations against them, as though they are saying: “ Your 
denying [ our belief ] is uncalled for, in fact it’s futile, for we’re not the sort 
of people who can be accused. ” It is also a sign that such vehemence will 
not give currency to what they say. It also hints that the veil covering their 
lies and dissembling is so ﬂimsy, if force were applied to it, it would be torn 
apart. Also, in its being a verbal clause is a sign that they cannot claim to 
be constant and persistent [ in their belief ]; their aim in dissimulating while 
claiming that they have recently come to believe is to share in the believers’ 
beneﬁts and to discover their secrets.

¹ ¸ ¶μ ´³ ²
The  comprehensive  “ w ā w   –   a n d  ”  in  “ b u t   ( lit.  and ) ²  denotes  that 
these words are so placed to make it clear that the dissemblers adhere to no 
particular way, and to describe their vacillation, [ as set forth ] in detail in the 
two conditional clauses [ this phrase and the last one ].

The deﬁniteness expressed by B indicates that driven by their deprav-
ity  and  spreading  of  corruption,  they  deem  it  their  bounden  duty  to  have 
recourse [ to their evil ones ].

The  verb ³  infers  that  because  of  their  perﬁdy  they  are  scared,  and 

because of their fear they conceal themselves.

116

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

The use of ´ instead of  َعَ(cid:174) which is [ properly ] used with the verb k h a -
l a w , indicates that because of their weakness and impotence they [ have to ] 
seek  refuge  [ with  others ],  and  because  of  their  corruption  and  intrigues, 
they hand over the believers’ secrets to the unbelievers. 

The term  ُن(cid:193) ِ(cid:142)اَ(cid:193) َ

ّ(cid:131)(cid:170)َا indicates that their chiefs are like satans, hidden and 
making diabolical suggestions, and that they cause harm like satans, and that 
they are on a satanic path, and can conceive of nothing but evil.

The phrase ¹ ¸ ¶ “ they say: we are really with you ” is to express 
their meeting their obligations and renewing their agreements, and their con-
stancy in their way. For here, it is conﬁrmative although no denial is made, 
while in the previous phrase it is not conﬁrmative although there is denial, 
which is evidence for the lack of compelling eagerness in the speaker’s heart 
in the previous phrase, and its being found in this one. Moreover, the fact 
that this phrase is a nominal clause and the previous one is a verbal clause, 
indicates that the purpose here is to demonstrate their constancy in dissem-
bling and their inconstancy in belief. 

¼ » º 
This phrase is not joined to the preceding one with a conjunction, for con-
junctions are not used to join sentences that are either so similar as to be one 
with each other or are totally unconnected, but only [ with sentences that ] 
are between the two. This phrase in one respect is a substitute ( b a d a l  ) for 
the previous one, and in another respect corroborates it; the two are there-
fore closely interlinked. Then in another way it is the answer to an implicit 
question and so is totally unconnected. For usually, replies are declarative 
( i k h b ā r i y y a  ) sentences or clauses, and questions express wishes, requests, 
or conditions ( i n s h ā ’ i y y a  ). 

With regard to this clause corroborating the previous one, and its being a 
substitute for it, which is closer to it, it signiﬁes contempt for the truth and 
the people of truth, so exalts falsehood and its followers; this is the meaning 
of: ¹ ¸

And with regard to its being the answer to an implied question, it is as 
though their satans are saying to them: “ If you are with us and on our way, 
why are you in agreement with the believers? Either you subscribe to their 
beliefs, or you have no belief. ” Apologetically they reply: ¼ » º 

VERSE 14-15 – ABOUT THE DISSEMBLERS 

117

thus stating explicitly that they are not in any way Muslims. By using the 
restrictive º they also infer that they are not hesitant or without beliefs or 
convictions,  and  by  using  the  active  participle ¼  they  hint  that  to 
mock is one of their permanent characteristics. Thus, they are not serious in 
this action of theirs [ their belief ]. 

À ¿ ¾
This clause is not joined to those preceding it; indeed, it is disjoined and 

separate from them. For if it had been attached by a conjunction to 
¼ » º it would also have had to corroborate ¹ ¸  And if it had 
been attached to ¶ it would also have had to have been conﬁned to when 
they were alone, whereas Allah mocks them continually. And if it had been 
attached to ³ ² it would have had to be the complement of their vacil-
lation. And if it had been attached to ¬ B both clauses would have had 
to have been intending the same thing, whereas the ﬁrst describes what they 
have done and the second, their punishment. Thus, since all the possibilities 
demanding a conjunction are invalid, it would not be correct for this clause 
to be attached to those preceding it. So it can only be unconnected to the 
previous phrase ( m u s t a ’ n i f a  ), and in reply to an implied question. This hints 
and implies that their wickedness and loathsomeness have reached such a 
degree that they induce the spirits of all those aware of them to ask: “ How 
will people who behave like that be punished? ”

The clause’s beginning with the word ¾ although the listener expects to 
see the believers facing up to them, indicates that He is honouring the believ-
ers and being beneﬁcent to them, for He confronts the dissemblers in their 
stead. It is also a hint restraining the dissemblers, for those supported by the 
One All-Knowing of the Unseen cannot be mocked. Also, the fact that this 
clause is detached and unconcerned with their mockery indicates that their 
mockery is nothing compared with its punishment. Moreover, the use of the 
term “ mocking ” to describe Allah the Most High’s chastisement of them, 
which  is  unﬁtting  for  His  exaltedness,  is  to  give  the  idea  of  the  similar-
ity between the holders of a conversation, and to indicate that the chastise-
ment is the punishment for their mockery and its inevitable result, although 
its purpose is to humiliate and scorn them. Furthermore, it hints that their 
mockery  of  the  believers  does  not  proﬁt  them,  indeed,  it  harms  them,  as 
though Allah the Most High is mocking them [ for it ]. Like someone who 
thinks he is making fun of you, but you look on him as crazy and want him 

118

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

to talk to you even if he abuses you, for his making fun of you is part of your 
making a fool of him.

Here,  the  derisory ¿  is  a  verb  in  the  imperfect  tense,  although  in 
the previous verse ¼ it is an active participle, which indicates that 
Allah the Most High’s chastisement and His debasing them are continually 
renewed so that they suffer the pain and are affected by it. For the effects of 
something continuous and regular diminish, or disappear altogether. This is 
the reason it is said that variation is necessary to make things felt. 

Ä Ã Â Á
That is, they make use of the means of misguidance and seek it, so Allah 
the  Most  High  gives  it  to  them.  Thus,  the  word  ُ
ّدـُ(cid:175)َ(cid:192)  implies  rebuttal  of 
the Mu‘tazilites, [ who asserted man creates his own actions ], and since it 
includes the meaning of ‘seeking help’ ( i s t i m d ā d  ) it infers rejection of the 
Jabriyya;  that  is,  misusing  their  wills  the  dissemblers  chose  this  path  and 
sought help to follow it, so Allah the Most High helped them, and loosened 
their halters.

The addition of the pronominal sufﬁx  ْمـُ(cid:182) to “ t r e s p a s s e s  ( lit. rebellion ) 
ٌناَ(cid:193)ْ(cid:155)ُ(cid:142)  ” that is, they chose it voluntarily, signiﬁes that they were not coerced 
so that they might be excused, while ٌناَ(cid:193)ْ(cid:155)ُ(cid:142) [ which has the meaning of over-
ﬂowing and exceeding all bounds ] indicates that their harm has inundated 
everything good like a ﬂood, destroying the foundations of perfection, and 
that nothing remains but black scum. 

Ä that is, they are bewildered and hesitant. This indicates that they 

have no beliefs and no ﬁxed goal.

Verse 16 

Ð Ï Î Í Ì Ë  Ê É È Ç Æ

The verse’s positioning with regard to what precedes it

Consider this: This verse is a summary of the preceding detailed descrip-
tions, illustrating them in elevated and effective fashion. Commerce is cho-
sen as the parable’s [ subject ] because the ﬁrst people it was addressing had 
experienced the pleasures and hardships of trade on their journeys of winter 
and summer.

T h e   v e r s e ’ s   p e r t i n e n c e   i s   t h i s :  Human beings were not sent to this world 
to make it their homeland, but to trade using the capital of their innate facul-
ties and powers; to cultivate them and then dispose freely of their produce.

The positioning of the verse’s phrases

This is a ﬂuent, natural arrangement, reﬂecting the ordering of the par-
able. It is like this: there was a cheated failed merchant. He had been given 
rich capital but he had used it only to buy poison and things harmful to him-
self. He worked his capital, but it brought him no proﬁt and was of no avail 
to him; indeed, it plunged him into ever greater loss. Finally he lost all of it, 
and then strayed from the path until there was no return.

The positioning of the parts of the phrases

The  demonstrative  pronoun Æ  brings  near  what  is  tangible  and 
distant. This suggests that on hearing the crimes enumerated in the above 
verses, the listener feels in his heart a gradually increasing anger and dis-
gust, so wants to see the dissemblers in order to vent his anger and confront 
them with his loathing and contempt. The palpability hints that their  being 
qualiﬁed by these extraordinary attributes embodies them in the [ listener’s ] 
mind, making them [ almost ] tangible to [ his ] imagination. It also indicates 
the reason for the statement, since sin leads to further sin. [ For certainly a 
reason  is  necessary  if  one  exchanges  misguidance  for  guidance,  and  this 
is  their  above-mentioned  crimes  and  attributes.  Thus,  the  Qur’an  alludes 
to them with Æ that is, those qualiﬁed by those attributes, so that the 
listener will know the reason for the condemnation of them in this verse. ] 1

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

As  for  the  distance  signiﬁed  by Æ  it  indicates  their  great  distance 
from the right path; they have reached the point of no return; they departed 
of their own accord, but they cannot return.

The relative pronoun Ç indicates that this sort of commerce is strange 
and  injurious.  Only  recently  had  it  appeared  and  become  a  principle  and 
course  of  action  adopted  by  people.  For  as  mentioned  above,  the  relative 
pronoun indicates new facts that are just being established. 

The verb È alludes to the rejection of their excuse [ when they say ] 
“ it is in our natures to do this. ” It is as though the Qur’an is saying to them: 
“ No!  Allah  has  given  you  your  lifespan  as  capital,  and  deposited  in  your 
spirits the potentiality to mature and be perfected, and planted in your con-
sciences  the  seeds  of  truth,  which  constitute  innate  guidance,  so  that  you 
might buy happiness. But rather than buying it, indeed renouncing it, you 
procured immediate pleasures and worldly beneﬁts, and misusing your wills 
you chose the way of misguidance rather than the path of guidance, and you 
spoiled that innate guidance and lost your capital.

The  phrase Ê É  hints  that  they  incur  loss  upon  loss,  for  just 
as they lose by acquiring misguidance, so they lose through giving up the 
supreme bounty of guidance.

Í Ì Ë     The  use  of  the  negative  –  for  not  only  have  they 
incurred a loss but have lost all their capital – suggests that it would have 
been intelligent not to attempt unproﬁtable trade, and particularly trade that 
causes loss and even the loss of one’s capital.

Also,  by  ascribing  the  verb  to  their  commerce  –  although  rightly  it 
should have been ascribed to themselves; that is ‘but they gained no proﬁt 
in their trade’  ْمِ(cid:183)ِ(cid:98)َراَ(cid:107)ِ(cid:98) يِ(cid:158) اوُ(cid:111)ِ(cid:92)َر ا َ(cid:175)َ(cid:158)  – is a sign that in no respect, in none 
of  its  particulars  or  conditions  or  means,  does  their  commerce  yield  any 
beneﬁt, unlike in some businesses where no proﬁt is made on the products 
but  some  beneﬁts  may  accrue  in  other  particulars  or  their  services.  The 
dissemblers’  trade  is  pure  evil  and  undiluted  harm.  Ascribing  the  verb  to 
the trade here resembles the saying: “  ُهُ(cid:171)ْ(cid:193)َ(cid:170) َماَ(cid:178) ( his night slept ) ” instead of 
“   ِلْ(cid:193)َ
ّ(cid:171)(cid:170)ا يِ(cid:158) َماَ(cid:178) ( he slept in the night ). ” The former means that besides himself 
sleeping, the night was hushed and silent as though sleeping, and nothing 
disturbed him.

Consider this: The Qur’an’s miraculous inimitability is founded on the 
eloquence of its composition ( n a ẓ m  ), and the eloquence of its composition 
is of two sorts: the ﬁrst is like decoration and the second like a garment. 

The First Sort resembles strung pearls, ﬁnely worked decoration, and 
embroidery studded with gems. It is derived from following the grammati-
cal and verbal meanings of a speech, like molten gold running among lumps 
of silver. The exposition of the subtle points that are the fruits of this sort of 
eloquence has been undertaken by f a n n  [ ‘ i l m  ] a l - m a ‘ ā n ī .

The Second Sort is like a costly gown or robe of honour, cut out accord-
ing to the stature of the meanings, sewn from different pieces with regular 
stitches, and clothed altogether on the meaning, or on the story, or the aim. 
This sort’s craftsman and master is f a n n  [ ‘ i l m  ] a l - b a y ā n .  

One of the most important questions of this [ latter ] sort is that of para-
bolic comparisons ( t a m t h ī l  ). 1 The Qur’an contains as many as a thousand, 
for such comparisons contain a subtle mystery and are elevated wisdom. Yes, 
through them delusion is overcome by reason, imagination is compelled to 
submit to thought, the hidden is made present, the abstract made tangible, and 
the meaning made palpable, the disparate are brought together, the various 
are blended, the diverse united, the sundered connected, and the defenceless

armed. If you want to hear a detailed discussion, then listen along with me 
to what the author of D a l ā ’ i l   a l - I ‘ j ā z  chants in A s r ā r   a l - B a l ā g h a , 1 when he 
says:

On the Appropriate and Effective Use
of Parabolic Comparisons

The  intelligent  ( ‘ u q a l ā ’  )  agree  that  when  comparisons  come  after  the 
meanings, or when the meanings emerge on being summarized by compari-
sons, and are transposed from their original forms to that of the comparisons, 
the comparison clothes them in splendour, makes them glorious, raises their 
value, kindles their ﬁre, augments their power by rousing souls, summons 
hearts towards them, stirs up breasts with fervent longing and love, and sub-
jugates dispositions through ardent passion and zeal. 

For  if  [ what  is  intended ]  is  praise,  [ the  allegorical  comparison  makes 
it ] more splendid and magniﬁcent; and more sublime and august; it excites 
the emotions more, familiarizing the meanings more swiftly, causing more 
joy; [ it is ] more effective on the praised, a more powerful intercessor for 
the praiser; more judicious will be his gifts and presentations, easier on the 
tongue and pleasanter to mention; more efﬁcacious at causing the heart to 
cleave to the meaning, and worthier.

And if [ what is intended ] is censure, the [ comparison’s ] touch is more 

biting, its branding more caustic, its impact severer, its sharpness keener.

And  if  it  is  argument  and  disputation,  the  [ comparison’s ]  proofs  are 

more illuminating, its power is more cogent, its exposition more dazzling.

And if [ what is intended ] is pride and vainglory, its aspiration is farther 

reaching, its honour more serious, its tongue more vehement.

And  if  [ what  is  intended ]  is  apology  or  excuse,  [ the  comparison ]  is 
closer to hearts and better at cajoling them, dispelling hatreds more gently, 
extinguishing anger more effectively, more captivating in its spells, leading 
to a better return

And if [ what is intended ] is admonishment, [ the comparison ] is better 
healing  for  the  breast,  more  conducive  to  thought,  more  eloquent  in  cau-
tioning and restraining, better at disclosing the aim, revealing the purpose, 
absolving the ailing, healing rancour.

then  electrify  it  making  it  shine  and  sparkle,  you  will  behold  in  it  many 
levels of beauty and varieties of adornment. Similarly, in all these verses, 
allusions and indications extend [ by means of ] the comparisons from their 
main aims to the [ above-mentioned ] stations, as though the underlying aim 
rolls along all these levels gathering tints and a share from each, making the 
words comprehensive summaries [ of the Qur’an ], or epitomes even. 

An Introduction

An Introduction
[ on Eloquence ( or Rhetoric ) ]

Consider this: One who speaks expresses a meaning, then offering evi-
dence convinces the intellect. Then too, employing comparisons, he excites 
feelings in the conscience, so arousing either desire or distaste in the heart 
and  preparing  it  to  accept  [ his  words ].  Thus,  eloquent  speech  is  speech 
which  the  intellect  and  conscience  proﬁt  from  together;  it  both  enters  the 
intellect,  and  trickles  into  the  conscience.  The  parabolic  comparison  pro-
vides for these two aspects, for it comprises a sort of analogy ( q i y ā s  ), and 
through it the law included in the comparison is reﬂected in the mirror of 
the thing represented. As though the speech is a proposition supported by 
evidence. For example, you might say about a ruler who suffers hardship for 
the sake of his subjects: “ The lofty mountain endures the burden of ice and 
snow, while the valleys below grow green and ﬂourish. ”

Similes ( a l - t a s h b ī h  ) form the basis of comparisons ( a l - t a m t h ī l  ), and the 
function of similes is to arouse feelings of disgust or longing or sympathy or 
aversion or wonder or awe. Thus, the purpose of the comparison is to exalt 
or to denigrate or to arouse longing or aversion, or to defame or embroider 
or show kindness, and so on. The conscience is aroused by the form of the 
comparison and feelings of desire or aversion are provoked.

The need for comparisons arises from the profundity and subtlety of mean-
ings, comparisons make these apparent; or [ it arises ] from the aim [ what is 
intended by the speech ] being disparate and scattered, then the comparison 
binds it together. The allegorical verses of the Qur’an ( a l - m u t a s h ā b i h ā t  ) are 
of the former kind, for according to the authoritative scholars ( a h l  a l - t a ḥ q ī q  ) 
they  are  a  sort  of  elevated  comparison  and  a  means  of  expressing  sheer 
truths and abstract ideas. One reason for this is that for the most part ordi-
nary people can be taught truths only in imaginary form – they can compre-
hend abstract ideas only by means of comparisons, and this necessitates the 

128

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

use of such allegorical expressions ( m u t a s h ā b i h ā t  ) as ( 7:54 ) b a ` 
In  this  way,  taking  their  understanding  into  consideration,  such  ideas  are 
made familiar to them. 

Over the course of time I have deduced from the essentials of eloquence 
( rhetoric ) twelve matters preliminary to expounding the Qur’an’s miracu-
lous inimitability. Each is the thread of ( khayṭ ) [ means to ] many truths.  1 
Set out above are the verses containing comparisons and parables; now it is 
appropriate  to  summarize  those  [ twelve ]  matters.  So  saying,  “ Success  is 
only from Allah the Most High, ” we begin:

The First Matter

The  source  of  the  embroideries  of  eloquence  is  none  other  than  the 
arrangement of the meanings; it is not the ordering of the words, which 
was  the  domain  of  the  grandiloquent  word-worshippers  ( Ar.  a l - l a f ẓ i y y ū n ; 
T. l a f ı z p e r e s t  ). Their passion for words developed into a chronic illness so 
that ﬁnally ‘Abd al-Qāhir al-Jurjānī refuted them in his D a l ā ’ i l   a l - I ‘ j ā z  and 
A s r ā r   a l - B a l ā g h a , devoting more than a hundred pages to disputing them. 
The  arrangement  of  the  meanings  consists  of  the  grammatical  mean-
ings being placed systematically among the words; that is, the literal ( ḥarfī ) 
meanings being dissolved among the words to obtain the novel embroider-
ies. If you look into it closely, you will see that the natural channel for ideas 
and emotions is the ordering of the meanings. 

The  arrangement  of  the  meanings  is  constructed  through  the  rules  of 
logic, for it is only by means of logic that thought progresses towards truths. 
And thought reaches truths when it penetrates the subtleties of the natures of 
things and their relations. And the relations between the essences of things 
are the bonds of [ the universe’s ] perfect order. And the perfect order is the 
shell of sheer beauty, which is the source of all beauty. And sheer beauty 
is the garden of the elegant and reﬁned sayings that are the ﬂowers of elo-
quence. This ﬂower-ﬁlled garden is where the nightingales wander who are 
known as the men of eloquence and lovers of creation. And the sweet, soft 
songs of those nightingales arise from the harmonious spiritual echoes waft-
ing from the pipes of the meanings’ arrangement.

I n   S h o r t :  The universe is of the utmost eloquence; its Maker composed it 
ﬂawlessly, eloquently. All the forms and species it contains, because of the

Nursi’s  work,  M u h â k e m a t ,  77-102.  Eng.  tr:  R a t i o n a l   A r g u m e n t s .   A   P r e s c r i p t i o n   f o r   t h e  
U l e m a , 85-108.

order included in them, are miracles of power. Thus, when speech emulates 
the real, material world, and its arrangement is in conformity with the latter’s 
order, it possesses purity of style ( a l - j a z ā l a  ) in its entirety. But if it turns to 
the ordering of the words, it descends into artiﬁciality and hypocrisy, and as 
though degenerates into dry earth or a delusive mirage.

The  underlying  reason  the  word-worshippers  deviated  from  true  elo-
quence  was  that  when  the  non-Arabs  became  Arabicized  on  being  drawn 
by  the  attractions  of  Arab  rule,  the  art  of  words  came  to  have  paramount 
importance for them. With their intermingling with the Arabs, the speech 
of  the  Mudari,  which  forms  the  basis  of  the  Qur’an’s  eloquence,  became 
corrupted; that mirror of the Qur’an’s styles became tarnished – although it 
sprang from the emotions and temperament of the Mudar people. So a large 
number of later scholars were carried away by love of the words.

NOTE: Embellishing words enhances them only if it is necessitated by 
the meanings. And decorating the forms of the meanings only elevates them 
if the meanings permit it. And burnishing the literary devices employed aug-
ments  the  purity  of  style  only  if  permitted  by  what  is  intended.  And  the 
subtlety of the comparisons becomes eloquence only when suitable to the 
aim and approved by what is intended. And the power and roaming of the 
imagination is eloquence only when it does not mar the truth, nor preponder-
ate over it, and the imagination exempliﬁes the truth, springing from it. If 
you wish for some comprehensive examples of these conditions, you should 
consult the above-mentioned parabolic verses.

The Second Matter

If rhetorical magic ( a l - s i ḥ r   a l - b a y ā n ī  ) is manifested in speech accidents 
become substance, meanings are embodied, inanimate beings acquire spir-
its,  and  plants  are  endowed  with  intelligence.  Conversation  then  starts  up 
between  them  that  leads  sometimes  to  dispute,  and  sometimes  to  banter. 
Lifeless beings start to dance before the imagination. If you want an exam-
ple, consider these lines:
 1 يِرْدَ(cid:134) يِ(cid:158) 

ْ(cid:202)ا ُم ِ(cid:135)َ(cid:99)ْ(cid:115)َ(cid:99)َ(cid:158)      ِهِ(cid:171)ْ(cid:143)َ(cid:174)  ِتْ(cid:111)َ(cid:98)  ْنِ(cid:174)  ُف َ(cid:203)ْ(cid:114)ِ

Or take note of the love between the earth and the rain in the lines:

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

This depicts the crackling and sprouting of the parched earth on the arrival 
of the belated rains. There must therefore be a grain of truth in every imagin-
ing, like in these examples, and in the lamp of every rhetorical ﬁgure ( m a j ā z  ) 
the ﬂame of truth. Otherwise the imaginary eloquence is mere fable, good 
only for exciting wonder.

The Third Matter

Know that the beauty and perfection of speech, and the rhetorical gar-
ment with which it is clothed, lie in its manner of expression ( u s l ū b  ). And 
its manner of expression consists of the form of the truths and the model of 
meanings obtained from the pieces of the parabolic metaphors ( a l - i s t i ‘ ā r ā t  
a l - t a m t h ī l i y y a  ). As though those pieces were an imaginary cinema, like the 
word ‘fruit’ points to its orchard, and the word ‘combat’ to the battleﬁeld. 
Moreover, parabolic comparisons ( a l - t a m t h ī l ā t  ) are founded on the mys-
tery of the relations between things, and their reﬂection in the order of the 
universe, and some things recalling others. For example, for the sons of the 
date-palm [ the Arabs ], the sight of the crescent moon in the constellation 
of the Pleaides calls to mind a bunch of grapes [ a cluster of dates ] hanging 
from a curved whitened stalk. As the Revelation says: 

( 36:39 ) Ä Ã Â Á
The usefulness of comparisons ( u s l ū b   a l - t a m t h ī l  ), as shown in the verses 
given previously, is that by means of them the speaker brings to light [ raises 
to  the  surface ]  deep  roots  and  unites  scattered  meanings.  When  he  hands 
one side to his listener, it is possible for the listener to draw the remainder 
towards himself; since they have been brought together, he can transfer to 
them mentally. Since he sees some, though they may be in the dark, he can 
progress step by step towards all of them.

For instance, a jeweller deﬁnes eloquent speech as “ an idea that bores 
[ a pearl like a drill ]. ” While a taverner would say that it is “ what is cooked 
in the cauldrons of knowledge. ” And a camel driver would say of eloquent 
speech: it is “ what you take by the halter and cause to recline in the hollow 
of  the  meaning. ”  Observing  the  art  in  these  deﬁnitions,  someone  hearing 
them would comprehend all they intended.

The wisdom in the formation of the literary device ( u s l ū b  ) [ of compari-
sons ] is that voluntarily the speaker hails and arouses the meanings reposing 
in the nooks and crannies of his heart, stark and bare. They emerge and enter 
the imagination, and don the garments of whatever form they ﬁnd, that are 

VERSE 17-20 – ABOUT ELOQUENCE

131

found  there  by  reason  of  the  speaker’s  art  or  occupation  or  familiarity  or 
need. Or at least they tie a kerchief of his art around their heads, or are tinted 
with its hues. The exordia you ﬁnd in the prefaces of books form the best 
examples of this matter.

However, the style of speech may also be in accordance with the imagi-
nation of the one addressed, like the styles of [ the literary devices used in ] 
the Qur’an. Don’t forget this! Moreover, the degrees of the styles are vari-
ous. Some are softer than the breeze; when it blows, it is signiﬁed by the 
speech as a whole. And some are more covert than the subterfuges of war; 
they can be divined only by masters of the art of warfare. Like al-Zamakhsharī 
divined  from  the  verse  ( 36:78 ) o n m l k    “ Are  there  any 
contenders  for  the  ﬁght? ”  If  you  like,  study  the  verses  mentioned  previ-
ously;  you  will  ﬁnd  in  them  things  verifying  the  subtlest  aspects  of  these 
matters. And if you wish, visit Imam al-Būṣayrī, and see how he writes his 
prescription in the style of a physician with his words:

 1 ِمَدَ

ّ(cid:179)(cid:170)ا َةَ(cid:193) ْ(cid:175) ِ(cid:110) ْمَزْ(cid:170)اَو ِمِراَ(cid:111) َ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)ا  َنِ(cid:174)       ْت(cid:199)َ(cid:99)ْ(cid:174)ا  ِدَ(cid:162)  ٍنْ(cid:193)َ(cid:150)  ْنِ(cid:174) َعْ(cid:174)َ

ّد(cid:170)ا  ِغرْ(cid:159)َ(cid:99) ْ(cid:126)اَو 

The physician’s style is alluded to with the word diet. And listen to Sulay-
man’s Hoopoe; how it refers to its engineering 2 with the words: 

( 27:25 ) G F E D C B A @ ?

lines:

Know that speech possesses power and strength only if it conﬁrms the

ُر(cid:193) ِ(cid:131)ُ(cid:192)  ِلا َ(cid:175)َ(cid:107)ْ(cid:170)ا   َكاَذ ىٰ(cid:170)إ  ٌ

[ it should conﬁrm them ] with all its words, order, and phrases responding to 
each other; and each taking the hand of the other and supporting it, and apart 
from its particular fruits each assisting to its own extent the general purport. 
This shared aim resembles a pool fed from all sides by rivulets. The mutual 
response  gives  rise  to  mutual  assistance,  which  gives  rise  to  order,  from 
which harmony proceeds, from which fairness is born, and essential beauty.

vining.

132

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

This secret of eloquence sparkles on every part of the Qur’an, especially on 

( 2:2 ) + * ) ( ' & % $ # * ! and others like it, as you saw 
in ( 21:46 )  3 2 1 0 / .
The Fifth Matter

Know that the richness of [ any part of ] speech and its scope lie in its 
serving the main aim, and its manner and overall form and allusive mean-
ings all indicating and pointing to the main aim together with its subsidiary 
and secondary meanings. Then levels of meaning appear one after the other, 
and  stations  appear  one  behind  the  next.  If  you  want  an  example  of  this, 
study g f e d c b a ( to the end of the verse, 2:11 ), and 
¯ ® ¬ « ( to the end of the verse, 2:14 ), as expounded above.
The Sixth Matter

Know  that  the  meanings  garnered  from  the  chart  of  speech  are  taken 
and inscribed by the camera of the wording according to their various sorts 
and degrees. Some are like air; they can be felt but not seen. Others are like 
steam; they can be seen but not held. Yet others are like water; they can be 
held but not grasped. Others are like molten metal; they can be contained 
but not determined as to shape. And others are like strung pearls or beaten 
gold; they can be given speciﬁc shapes and forms. Then, under the effect of 
the aim and station, the insubstantial meaning acquires ﬁrmness and body. 
Three conditions mould a single meaning: have you not observed that when 
some external matter affects your conscience, your heart is agitated? Your 
emotions are excited, insubstantial meanings take ﬂight and desires are born. 
Some of these are attained. Then some of these take form. And some of these 
latter are inhibited. In each of these levels, some of the meanings become 
established and some contract and yet others are suspended, like part of the 
voice is suspended when forming certain letters, and like part of an ear of 
corn becomes the husk as the grains are formed. Thus, the mark of the elo-
quent speaker is his expressing clearly those things intended by his speech 
and  required  by  its  station,  and  demanded  by  those  he  is  addressing.  The 
other levels of meaning he refers – in relation to their proximity to the main 
aim – to what the sense infers and the words indicate and the particular cir-
cumstances evince and the exordium betokens and the style implies and his 
own attitude suggests.

VERSE 17-20 – ABOUT ELOQUENCE

133

Then there are the suspended meanings; they are ephemeral signiﬁcative 
( ḥ a r ﬁ y y a  ) meanings, not expressed by particular words. They are itinerant 
travellers  with  no  ﬁxed  abode.  Sometimes  they  are  concealed  in  a  word, 
sometimes they are absorbed by a phrase, and sometimes they take refuge in 
a story; you can distil them if you press where they are found. Like the dis-
appointment expressed by Mary’s mother in the verse, ( 3:36 ) ¬ « ª 
and the regret in the lines, “ Were my youth to return one day, I would tell it 
of the woes of old age. ” And such meanings as longing, self-praise, address-
ing others, allusion, suffering, bewilderment, wonder, and boasting.

The relations between all these competing meanings are good on condi-
tion attention and care are allotted to them proportionately to their serving 
the main aim. If you want examples of this matter, the clearest are provided 
by this sura, from the beginning up to here, and by the manner in which it is 
expounded.

The Seventh Matter

Know that if imagination has a place in a style or literary device ( u s l ū b  ), 
it deﬁnitely has to sprout from a seed of truth, and to be like a mirror reﬂect-
ing onto non-material matters ( m a ‘ n a w i y ā t  ) the physical laws and causes 
and  effects  in  the  chains  of  external  beings.  The  philosophy  of  grammar 
( a l - n a ḥ w  ), the works of which contain the above-mentioned relationships, 
is also of this sort – just as it is said that the nominative is the right of the 
doer, for the powerful takes the powerful. You can make further examples 
in the same way. 

The Eighth Matter

Know that Sibawayh 1 stated categorically that particles that express 
numerous meanings like ‘from’  ْنِ(cid:174) ‘to’ ىٰ(cid:170)ِا and ‘by’ ( a l - b ā ’  ), and others, 
in  fact  express  only  a  single,  unchanging,  meaning.  It  is  rather  that  they 
absorb a suspended meaning related to the context ( lit. station –  m a q ā m  ) 
and  aim,  drawing  it  into  themselves,  and  their  original  meanings  become 
forms  or  modes  of  expression  ( u s l ū b  )  for  their  guests.  Similarly,  when 
someone  well  versed  in  the  science  of  language  studies  these  closely,  he 
knows that a shared word [ bearing several meanings ] mostly has a single 
meaning.  Then,  because  of  the  relationships  between  them,  the  meanings 
have become similies and some have become tropes ( m a j ā z ā t  ), and others, 
becoming part of the common language, have lost their original meanings

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

( ḥ a q ā ’ i q   ‘ u r ﬁ y y a  ). In this way single words have come to have numerous 
meanings. The word a l - ‘ a y n , which means ‘eye’ or ‘spring,’ was applied to 
the sun also, ﬁguratively, for by means of it the celestial world looks down 
on  the  lower  world,  or  because  the  water  of  life  which  is  its  light,  ﬂoods 
down from that source onto lofty white peaks. You can make analogies with 
this for the rest.

The Ninth Matter

Know that the highest degree of eloquence, which confounds the faculty 
of will, personal thought and simple conceptions, is the speaker observing 
and  preserving  all  together  the  relationships  of  the  parts  of  his  speech  as 
well as the relations of the words and the balance of the sentences. Each of 
these  with  its  fellows  should  display  an  embroidery,  and  interlinking  [ in 
their totality, form ] a vast tapestry. It is as though the speaker employs other 
brains as well as his own, like the builder of a palace placing multicoloured 
stones  in  such  a  way  as  to  obtain  a  wondrous  design  out  of  their  balance 
and proportion, or like some calligraphic designs featuring the letter  ‘ a y n , 
shared by the four Rightly-Guided Caliphs. 1 One of the clearest examples 
of this matter is the verse, ( 2:1-2 ) + *  (  & % $ # * ! as 
you heard above.
Another reason for speech being elevated is its resembling a family tree, 
with the branches and twigs of its generations all denoting aims that point to 
the main aim and station ( m a q ā m  ). A further reason is the speech assuming 
such a form that many aspects and branches can be deduced from it, like the 
story of Moses ( UWP ).

The Tenth Matter

Know  that  speech  acquires  smoothness  and  ﬂuency,  the  source  of  its 
subtlety and agreeableness, when the meanings and feelings it evinces are 
blended  and  combined,  or  are  various  yet  ordered,  for  then  the  surround-
ings do not attract the power of its expression and aim, but the centre draws 
strength from the surroundings. Speech also acquires ﬂuency when the aim 
is  well  deﬁned,  and  when  the  point  at  which  all  the  intended  aims  come 
together, is clear.

The Eleventh Matter

Know that the integrity of speech, which is the reason for its correctness 
and power, lies in the following: just as speech should indicate ﬁrst princi-
ples and proofs, and allude to primary and secondary meanings; so too with 

1.  Their names all begin with the letter ‘ayn: ‘Umar, ‘Uthmān, ‘Alī. ‘Atīq was the title 

of Abu Bakr, the ﬁrst Caliph.

the elements of the subject and predicate and their modes of expression, it 
should infer the repulsion of doubts and delusions – as though each part of 
it is the answer to an implicit question. If you want an example, study the 
Opening Sura of the Qur’an!

The Twelfth Matter

Know that there are three sorts of style or modes of expression ( uslūb ):
T h e  F i r s t  is a sheer or abstract style ( a l - u s l ū b  a l - m u j a r r a d  ); it is of a sin-
gle colour and is characterized by its conciseness, naturalness, correctness, 
and  integrity.  It  is  smooth  and  even,  and  used  for  business,  discussions, 
and the instrumental sciences. If you want a ﬂuent example of it, study the 
works of Sayyid al-Jurjānī. 1

T h e   S e c o n d  is the embellished style ( a l - u s l ū b   a l - m u z a y y a n  ); it is charac-
terized by embellishment and illumination, and by its arousing the heart with 
either longing or disgust. It is suitable for addresses [ intended to ] praise or 
censure and so on, and for persuasion and similar things. If you are looking 
for an embellished example, enter D a l ā ’ i l   a l - I ‘ j ā z  and A s r ā r   a l - B a l ā g h a , for 
in them you will happen upon many an ornamented garden. 

T h e   T h i r d   is  the  high  style  ( a l - u s l ū b   a l - ‘ ā l ī  ),  which  is  characterized 
by its intensity, power, grandeur, and spiritual loftiness. It is suitable for 
discourses on divine matters, the principles of religion, and philosophy. If 
you want a perspicuous and inimitable example, study the Qur’an, for in 
it are found eloquent truths that have been seen by no eye nor occurred to 
any heart.

This section is concluded here in summary form.

∗ ∗ ∗

Consider this: The noteworthy points in the verse we were discussing, 
% $ # " !  ( to the end of the verse, 2:17 ), are as follows: 

F i r s t l y :  Its positioning in regard to what precedes it.
S e c o n d l y :  The positioning of [ and relationships between ] its phrases.
T h i r d l y :  The positioning of [ and relationships between ] the constituents 

of its phrases.

Bearing in mind the above [ discussion on eloquence ], know that having 
given a clear description of the dissemblers’ circumstances and their crimes, 
the Qur’an cites the following comparison ( t a m t h ī l  ) for three reasons:

1.  al-Sayyid al-Sharīf al-Jurjānī ( d. 816/1413 ) was a polymath who wrote on numer-

ous subjects including the Arabic sciences, logic, and k a l ā m .

136

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

T h e   F i r s t   o f   t h e s e :  To make [ the new or unfamiliar ] appear familiar to 
the  imagination  ( a l - k h a y ā l  ),  which  accepts  the  products  of  imagination 
more  readily  than  rational  ideas;  and  to  make  the  surmising  faculty  ( a l -
w a h m  ), which is given to doubts and questioning and opposing the reason, 
submit by showing the strange in a familiar form, and by depicting the hid-
den as visible.

T h e   S e c o n d :   To  arouse  the  conscience  and  excite  disgust  in  it,  so  by 
representing  what  is  mental  ( abstract )  as  tangible  to  unite  the  mind  and 
emotions.

T h e   T h i r d :  To bind together scattered meanings by means of the compar-
ison, and point out the true bonds between them. Also, to plant [ the desired 
facts ]  before  the  eye  of  the  imagination  so  that  it  may  garner  the  subtle 
points that the tongue fails [ to express ].

Consider this: The meaning of this verse’s phrases corresponds both to 
the meaning of the whole story of the dissemblers, and to all the verses that 
[ relate ] it. Don’t you see that they believed outwardly for worldly advan-
tages then inwardly they disbelieved. They were then confused and discon-
certed. They then did not search out the truth so were unable to return [ to 
it ] that they might recognize it. How this resembles the situation of people 
who light a ﬁre or a lamp but cannot keep it alight and it goes out. They 
are  plunged  in  darkness.  They  can  see  nothing  and  it  seems  to  them  that 
everything has ceased to exist. Due to the silence of the night it is as though 
they are deaf; and because the night seems blind and their lights have been 
extinguished,  it  is  as  though  they  are  blind;  and  because  there  is  no  one 
they can turn to for help and they receive no assistance, it is as though they 
are dumb; and because they cannot return, it is as though they are lifeless 
spectres, devoid of spirits. The main points in the comparison look to the 
main particulars of their subject [ that is, the dissemblers ]. For instance, the 
darkness looks to [ their ] disbelief, and the bewildered confusion to [ their ] 
vacillation, and the ﬁre to dissension. You can make further analogies in the 
same way.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Light [ is mentioned ] in the comparison, but how can 

the dissembler have light, that the comparison be applied to him?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  If a person has no light, it may be found in his sur-
roundings,  from  where  he  may  seek  it.  If  there  is  none  there,  it  may  be 
found  among  his  people,  from  whom  he  may  take  it.  If  there  is  no  light 
among his people, there may be some among the human race from which he 

VERSE 17-20 – THE FIRST PARABLE ABOUT THE DISSEMBLERS

137

may beneﬁt. And if not, there may be [ a spark that ] emanates from his own 
inborn nature, from which he may receive effulgence, as has been discussed. 
If you’re not convinced by this, there may, in the view of others, be [ light ] 
on his tongue, or according to himself, in order to obtain worldly beneﬁts. If 
you’re still not persuaded, [ the dissemblers may have had a light ] because 
some of them believed at ﬁrst, then apostatized. If this doesn’t convince you, 
it may be that the light here alludes to what they beneﬁted from, while the 
ﬁre indicates the dissension [ they caused ]. And if you’re not satisﬁed with 
this either, the fact that guidance was possible through the revelation [ of the 
Qur’an ] [ meant ] it was existent, as is indicated by the [ preceding ] verse, 
Ê É È  For this is the close neighbour of the comparison.
Now for the positioning of [ and relationships between ] the phrases 
of the verse

Consider this: The positioning of the phrase % $ # " !  
is absolutely ﬁtting. For the lighting of ﬁre in this way was entirely consistent 
with the situation of the ﬁrst people the Qur’an was addressing. They were 
the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula and without exception had experi-
enced such a situation, or had heard about it, and had suffered its upsetting 
effects. They had taken refuge in the night from the sun’s tyranny, travelling 
in darkness. Very often the skies would press down on them and they would 
feel the weariness of travel, and sometimes their road would lead them to 
the abyss. They would also roam in the gloom of caves ﬁlled with noxious 
creatures. Then they would lose their way and need to kindle a ﬁre or light 
a lamp to see their companions or feel close to them even, and to see their 
possessions and protect them, and make out the path they should take, and 
so that ferocious beasts and other perils would be visible to them and they 
could avoid them. Then, when they were well lit up with the light it would 
be suddenly extinguished at a blow from the heavens. Filled with hope and 
about to accomplish their goals, they would be cast into the deepest despair. 
[ The Qur’an ] states this clearly with the words: 

, + * ) ( ' &

The “ b u t   ف  ” at the beginning of the phrase indicates that they kindled 
the ﬁre for light and it lit up [ all round them ] and they felt conﬁdent at this. 
But  they  were  immediately  overcome  by  frustration  and  disappointment. 
How powerfully effective is this being thwarted at the very moment of suc-
cess! The light being taken away in the [ consequence – that is, second half – 

138

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

of the ] conditional sentence is apparently necessitated by the illumination 
[ but the necessity of this is not obvious ]. The necessity being hidden indi-
cates the existence of implied [ sentences ], as follows:

When all was lit up around them they busied themselves with the light 
yet did not preserve it. They did not give it due importance and were not 
aware of its value. They did not keep [ the ﬁre ] alight and it went out. For 
being preoccupied with the result, they neglected the means. As inferred by 
the verse ( 96:6-7 ) k j i  *  g f e  [ their preoccupation with the 
light ]  was  the  cause  of  its  ceasing  and  being  extinguished,  as  though  the 
very illumination caused the light to vanish. 

As  for  the  phrase / . -    having  pointed  out  how  they  lost 
the bounty of the light, [ the Qur’an ] describes their disappointment at the 
calamity of being plunged into darkness.

The phrase 1 3 : Know that when darkness falls and a person loses 
his way, he may stop and be consoled by the sight of his companions and 
possessions. But if he does not see them, stopping may be as bad for him as 
moving on, or even worse. 

The  phrase 8 7 6 5 4 3  :  When  a  person  is  overcome  by 
such a calamity, he ﬁnds solace by hoping for salvation and seeking it from 
four successive directions:

F i r s t l y  he hopes to hear the cries of nearby villagers or other travellers 
and [ anticipates ] that if he calls for help they will save him. But since the 
night is soundless and silent, he is no different to a deaf man, so [ the Qur’an ] 
calls him  3 and that hope is lost.

S e c o n d l y  he hopes that if he shouts or calls out for help there is the possi-
bility that someone will hear and come to his aid. But when the night is deaf 
and dumb, there is no difference between the speaker and someone dumb, 
so [ the Qur’an ] calls [ him ]  4 silencing him and destroying that hope too.
T h i r d l y  he hopes to be saved by espying some sign or a ﬁre or light that 
will show him the way to his destination. But when the night is overwhelm-
ingly ashen-black, frowning and blind, the seeing and the blind are the same, 
so [ the Qur’an ] calls [ him ] 5 extinguishing that hope too.

F o u r t h l y : Nothing now remains to him but to try to return. But the dark-
ness has descended on him and he is like someone who has got stuck in a 

VERSE 17-20 – THE FIRST PARABLE ABOUT THE DISSEMBLERS

139

quagmire  of  his  own  accord  and  can  ﬁnd  no  way  out.  Indeed,  how  many 
matters there are that you get involved in willingly then against your will 
you cannot turn back; you desist from them but they do not let you go. So 
the Most High says: 8 7 6  to shut this door on them too, severing 
this last cord that they were clinging on to. So they fall into the darkness of 
despair, desolation, wretchedness, and fear.

Now for the third aspect, I mean the positioning of
[ and relationships between ] the constituents of the phrases

Consider  % $ # " !  and  see  how  the  sparks  of  ﬁne 

points ﬂy off in all directions from its words.

The word  ُلـَ(cid:103)َ(cid:174) indicates the strangeness of the dissemblers’ situation and 
that their story is remarkable. For a parable is something that is on every 
tongue and people recount it to each other because it is odd and unusual; its 
most salient characteristic is its curiousness. It is because fundamental prin-
ciples are included in parables and proverbs that they are called “ common 
wisdom ” and “ popular philosophy. ” What is intended here by the parable 
is [ to describe ] this characteristic strangeness and their curious story and 
abhorrent state. In other words, the ﬁgurative ( m a j ā z  ) use of the term “ p a r -
a b l e  ” to describe their situation indicates their being unusual and odd. And 
this indication implies that characteristically, this attribute of theirs is met 
with disgust and condemnation by everyone, as with a proverb.

As for the ك of “  "    –   i s   t h a t   [   t h e   p a r a b l e   ]   o f : ”
• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  If this had been omitted ( ḥ a d h f  ) it would have been 

an elegant simile. Wouldn’t that have been more eloquent?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :   It  is  of  greater  eloquence  in  this  context  ( m a q ā m  ) 
to mention it, for its explicitness alerts the mind, causing it to look on the 
parable in second place and to transfer from the main points [ the parable is 
making ] to what it is alluding to. For if [ the reader’s mind ] were to become 
intentionally  absorbed  in  [ the  parable  itself ],  its  subtleties  that  should  be 
applied [ to what it is alluding to ] would elude it. 

The second [ instance of the word ] “ p a r a b l e   ُلـَ(cid:103)َ(cid:174)  ” indicates that with 
its strangeness and existence in the common mind, the situation of the one 
kindling the ﬁre is as though proverbial.

140

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

Now for # :
• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Why is this [ relative pronoun ] singular when [ the 
dissemblers ] are plural?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  If the part and the whole, and the individual and the 
collectivity are equal and membership [ of the collectivity ] neither increases 
nor diminishes the individual’s attributes, it is permissible [ to use it for both 
the singular and plural ] in two respects, as in “ [ their similitude  ُلـَ(cid:103)َ(cid:174) is ] that 
ُلـَ(cid:103)َ(cid:174)  of  a  donkey. ”  The  use  of  the  singular  indicates  that  each  individual 
independently represents the consternation and abhorrence of all of them. Or 

it may be that # is an abbreviated form of   َن(cid:192) ِذَ

ّ(cid:170)َا [ the plural form ].

The  s ī n  of $  [ that is, the verb being in the Xth form ] alludes to 
[ their ] seeking and taking trouble, while its being in the singular although 
the subsequent  ْمـِ(cid:182)ِروُ(cid:178) has the plural pronominal sufﬁx is a subtle sign that 
the person kindles it for the group. It is indeed subtle that the singular is used 
for the kindling and the plural is used for the being illumined. 

The use of % instead of ‘the lamp’ or something else alludes to the hard-
ship [ involved ] in the light of Allah’s commands [ and trials ], and indicates 
that they were kindling the ﬁre of dissension under the guise of a light. ٌراَ(cid:178) 
being indeﬁnite indicates that their need for ﬁre was so intense they did not 
mind what form it took. 

Now  cast  an  eye  over  the  phrase , + * ) ( ' & 
and see how its words light up the darkness of their bewilderment, which is 
their main aim. You heard [ read ] in the Fourth Matter above that the power 
of speech lies in the mutual response of its parts.

The “ b u t  ” (  ف in &  ) hints at the immediate onset of absolute despair 

after being full of hope.

ّ(cid:175)َ(cid:170)  comprises  a  proportionate  conditional  syllogism  which,  by  demon-
ا َ
strating the certainty of the ﬁrst [ proposition ], infers the certainty and reali-
zation of the subsequent one; [ that is, their being overwhelmed by darkness ] 
and losing their source of consolation.

' indicates that they kindled the ﬁre for light, not for warmth. And 
this hints at their terrible dismay, for its illumination only served to see the 
perils [ besetting them ] and to learn of their existence. Had it not been for 
[ the light ], they could have deceived themselves and felt reassured.

VERSE 17-20 – THE FIRST PARABLE ABOUT THE DISSEMBLERS

141

While ) (  indicates that they were encompassed by terror on all four 
sides, and that they had to preserve themselves with the light from the harms 
beleaguering them from all six directions.

As for * it is the consequence of the condition and therefore neces-
sitated by [ the ﬁrst part of the conditional sentence ] '   but as dis-
cussed above, this necessity is [ not clear, it is ] hidden and implies [ these 
sentences ]: they did not attend to and maintain the ﬁre and did not know its 
value as a bounty, and the light made them get above themselves and their 
glee and cockiness made them forget to tend it, so Allah took it from them.
The ascription of + * indicates the frustration of two hopes: hope of 
rectifying [ their situation ] and hope of divine mercy. For it infers that the 
heavenly visitation does not allow their situation to be put to rights and sug-
gests that it is the punishment for human faults. This is the reason Allah the 
Most High chastises them. Thus, what they were cleaving to was torn away 
from them when the causes were suspended, and this was the hope of mercy. 
For help cannot be sought from the truth in order to nullify it.

The [ preposition ] ب of , signiﬁes [ their ] despairing of [ the light ] 
returning, for what Allah has taken cannot be sought. For there is a clear 
difference between  ِهـِ(cid:92)  َبَ(cid:182)َذ which means “ he laid claim to it and took it, ” 
and ه(cid:93)َ(cid:182)ذأ [ IVth form ], which means “ h e   r e m o v e d   i t   o r   t o o k   i t   a w a y , ” while 
َبَ(cid:182)َذ  [ Ist form ] means “ he went on his way. ” In the latter two there is the 
possibility of return, but in the former there is none.

In ٌروُ(cid:178) is a slight hint about [ the dissemblers’ ] situation on the Bridge 
of Sirat. The possessive pronominal sufﬁx  ْمـُ(cid:182) which denotes particularity, 
infers their terrible grief. For a person suffers greater sorrow if his ﬁre goes 
out while other people’s ﬁres are burning brightly. See how the very subtlest 
pearls of eloquence are Allah’s in the Qur’an! Do you not see how all the 
parts [ of the sentence ] are turned towards the general aim; I mean, the [ dis-
semblers’ ] alarm and despair is like a pool at the conﬂuence of rivers?

Now  consider  carefully 1 0 / . -  The  [ conjunction ]  و 
indicates  that  they  combine  two  losses:  they  are  stripped  of  the  light  and 
clothed in darkness.

The use of   َكَرَ(cid:98) instead of ‘he made stay’ ىَ(cid:163)ْ(cid:92)َأ or something similar sug-
gests that they have become like lifeless corpses and kernelless shells. It is 
ﬁtting therefore that they should be abandoned as worthless and discarded.

142

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

The . infers that in their view everything has ceased to exist and that 
nothing  remains  but  the  darkness,  which  seems  to  be  non-existence  and 
encases them like the grave.

The plural of  / indicates that the blackness of the night and ten-
ebrous  clouds  have  given  rise  to  the  darkness  of  despair  and  fear  in  their 
spirits, and that where they are found is ﬁlled with the darkness of desolation 
and despondency. For them time too is ﬁlled with the darkness of silence 
and motionlessness. It suggests that they are entirely swathed in multifarious 
darknesses. The use of the indeﬁnite signiﬁes that the darkness is unknown 
to  them,  their  never  before  having  experienced  it,  and  this  increases  its 
impact on them.

As for 1 0  it states clearly the worst calamities. For the person who 
cannot see suffers more tribulations, and because he lacks sight he experi-
ences [ to a greater degree ] the slightest misfortunes. The imperfect tense is 
used to depict their condition [ vividly ] in the eye of the imagination so the 
listener  [ actually ]  sees  their  consternation  and  his  conscience  is  affected. 
The  verb  is  without  object  to  generalize  [ the  meaning ];  they  cannot  see 
anything  that  would  be  of  use  to  them  and  might  protect  them,  and  they 
cannot see the dangers that they might avoid them; and they cannot see their 
companions to avail themselves of their intimacy. It is as though each is on 
his own and alone.

Next  consider  the  phrases 8 7 6 5 4 3  and  listen  to  how 
they conﬁde in one another, for these four [ phrases ] are a deﬁnition shared 
( ḥ a d d   m u s h t a r a k  ) by both the parable or comparison ( m u m a t h t h a l  ) and 
the  thing  portrayed  ( m u m a t h t h a l   b i h i  ).  They  are  intermediate  between 
them and are turned to both. They tell of both sides’ conditions and are a 
mirror to both showing you their characters. They result from both and tell 
you their stories.

The aspect looking to the comparison: Know that a person who is struck 
by such a calamity clings onto the hope of being saved by listening closely 
for the voice of someone who might save him, but the night is so silent and 
soundless it deafens him. Still he hopes to make someone hear, but the deaf-
ness of the night makes him dumb. Then he hopes to be guided by the sight 
of a ﬁre or light, but the unseeing night makes him blind. Then [ he hopes ] 
to return to the start [ of his journey ] but the door is blocked up against him 
like someone who falls into a bog and the more he struggles the more he 
sinks into it.

VERSE 17-20 – THE FIRST PARABLE ABOUT THE DISSEMBLERS

143

The aspect looking to those depicted in the comparison: Know that when 
they get caught up in the darkness of disbelief and dissembling they could 
be saved from it in four successive ways:

F i r s t l y :  They could raise their heads to listen to the truth and heed the 
Qur’an’s guidance, but when the rush of desire prevents the sound of the 
Qur’an entering their ears, and their frenzy takes them by the ears and holds 
them back from this path, the Qur’an reproaches them with the epithet 3 
This indicates that this door is blocked up and suggests that their ears have 
been cut off.

S e c o n d l y :  They should lower their heads and consult their consciences, 
and ask about the truth and the path. But when obstinacy seizes their tongues 
and hatred tugs them back into the hollow of their mouths, the Qur’an deals 
a blow at them with the word: 4 This indicates that that door too is shut in 
their faces and alludes to their failing to endorse the truth.

T h i r d l y :   They  should  make  the  effort  to  extract  lessons  from  the  evi-
dences in the world around them, but heedlessness places its hand over their 
eyes  and  feigned  blindness  draws  down  their  eyelids,  so  the  Qur’an  calls 
them 5 a sign that they have strayed from this path too. The omission of 
the particle ‘k a ’ indicates that their eyes – the lights of the head – have as 
though been plucked out.

F o u r t h l y :  They should recognize the ignominy of their situation and feel 
disgusted and regret it and repent and return, but because, due to the corrup-
tion of their natures caused by their insisting on their way and the dominance 
of lust and Satan, their souls make these abominations seem appealing to 
them, so the Qur’an says: 8 7 6  This is a sign that the ﬁnal paths 
have been closed up for them and indicates that although they have got into 
this situation voluntarily they do not have the will to extricate themselves 
and are ﬂoundering like a man caught in quicksands.

The  noteworthy  points  in  these  verses  may  also  [ be  subsumed  under ] 
three  [ headings ]:  their  positioning  in  regard  to  the  preceding  verses;  the 
postioning of the verses’ phrases [ and the relationships between them ]; and 
the relationships between the constituents of the phrases. These resemble the 
relationships between the hour, minute, and second hands of a clock.

That aspect of the composition [ that looks to the positioning ] of 
these verses and those that preceded it

The Qur’an repeats the parables ( t a m t h ī l  ) thus extending its descriptions 
and indicating the need to describe [ at length ] the dissemblers in their alarm 
and confusion, which are of two sorts, [ as is shown in the following sum-
maries ]: 

A   S u m m a r y   o f  

t h e   F i r s t   P a r a b l e :   The  dissembler  sees  himself  in  the 
desert of existence apart from his fellows, ostracized from the assembly of 
beings and outside the jurisdiction of the true sun. In his view everything 
is  non-existent,  all  creatures  are  alien;  silent  and  motionless  they  are  for-
lorn and [ doomed to ] extinction. Can this compare with the believer, who 
through the light of belief looks on beings as friendly and is familiar with 
the whole universe?

A   S u m m a r y   o f   t h e   S e c o n d   P a r a b l e :  The dissembler supposes that in its 
entirety the world is announcing his death with its calamities, and menac-
ing him with its disasters, and screaming at him with its events, and rain-
ing down blows on him from all sides, as though all its beings have united 
in enmity to him and everything beneﬁcial has become harmful. The only 

144

VERSE 19-20 – THE SECOND PARABLE ABOUT THE DISSEMBLERS

145

reason for this however, is his having no support and no source of help, as 
has been discussed. Can this compare with the believer, who by virtue of his 
belief hears the gloriﬁcations of all beings and their joyous utterances? 

Moreover, the fact there is a second parable indicates that the dissemblers 
are divided into a common low class, conformable with the ﬁrst parable, and 
an arrogant, overweening class, corresponding to the second.

t h i s  

l a t t e r   p a r a b l e   w i t h  

t h e   c o n t e x t   (   m a q ā m   ) ,  

T h e   r e l a t i o n s h i p   o f  
t h e  

i n  
r e s p e c t   o f  
l i s t e n e r :   The  ﬁrst  people  the  Qur’an  was  addressing  were 
the desert-dwellers whose bed was the ﬂoor of the desert and roof the tent 
of the heavens. They had all experienced these things or heard about them 
from their fellows, and were therefore familiar with them and found them 
as  effective  as  proverbs.  The  relationship  of  this  second  parable  with  the 
ﬁrst one is abundantly clear, for it completes  and  perfects it  and  in  many 
instances even makes the same points. The relationship between the parable 
and those depicted by it [ the dissemblers ] has six aspects:

T h e   F i r s t :   They  are  both  totally  overcome  by  bewilderment  when  all 
ways of escape are blocked up and all means of deliverance [ are suspended ].
T h e   S e c o n d :   They  are  both  overwhelmed  by  terrible  fear  and  they  all 
imagine that beings are united in hostility to them and that they cannot live 
in safety even for a minute.

T h e   T h i r d :   They  are  both  struck  by  alarm  so  fearsome  they  become 
insane and lose their minds. It is like someone who sees a ﬂashing sword 
and tries to defend himself by closing his eyes, or hears the roar of guns and 
tries to avoid being hit by stopping up his ears, or like someone who does not 
want the sun to set and impedes the workings of his watch so that the wheel 
of fate will cease to turn. How crazy they are! For the thunderbolts will not 
turn back when they stop up their ears, nor will the ﬁery lightning pity them 
when they close their eyes. From this it is understood that they have nothing 
left to cling on to.

T h e   F o u r t h :   The  sun  and  rain,  and  light  and  water  are  apparently  the 
source of the life of ﬂowers and plants and for the raising of them, but they 
also cause dead things to putrefy and ﬁlthy things to rot. Similarly, if mercy 
and bounty do not encounter places that are ready and prepared for them and 
know their value, they are transformed into trouble and revenge.

T h e   F i f t h :   Just  as,  if  one  disregards  the  words,  there  is  a  correspond-
ence between the meanings [ of the second parable and of the story of the 

146

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

dissemblers  it  portrays ],  which  form  the  basis  of  the  parabolic  metaphor 
( a l - i s t i ‘ ā r a   a l - t a m t h ī l i y y a  ); so too there are relationships between the parts 
[ of both of these ]. For a cloudburst is the life of plants, as Islam is the life 
of spirits. The thunder and lightning indicate promise and threat, while the 
darknesses show you the doubts of disbelief and scepticism of dissembling.

The positioning of [ and relationships between ]
the verses’ phrases

With the phrase = < ; : the Qur’an infers that [ the dissem-
blers ] resemble people forced to travel through a wild desert on a dark night 
in a violent rainstorm, the calamitous rain pelting down on them like bullets 
from the brimming sky. In this way it is alerting the listener’s mind, for he 
is waiting for an explanation of why the rain clouds, which are essentially 
much desired mercy, are such a ghastly calamity. So to illustrate their awe-
someness,  it  says: ? >  suggesting  that  the  rain  contains  the  clouds’ 
darkness and denseness. Similarly, because of its abundance and being so 
widespread  and  general,  it  is  as  though  with  its  black  droplets  [ the  rain ] 
contains  the  fragmenting  night.  As  soon  as  the  listener  hears ? >  he 
expects an explanation, as though the speaker hears the sound of thunder in 
his brain so says: @ This suggests its menacing threats, for the skies, the 
commander of beings, are intent on wiping out [ the dissemblers ] and they 
rumble and roar at them with their thunder. In the face of this, the terriﬁed 
calamity-stricken [ dissemblers ] imagine that the universe, whose beings co-
operate and assist each other, is bent on harming them despite its tranquil-
lity, and despite its silence is howling at them horribly. When they hear the 
thunder they imagine it is uttering threats at them, for out of fear they think 
it is roaring at them. 

Then as soon as the listener hears the thunder, its constant companion 
strikes his mind, and for this reason [ the Qur’an ] says: A which indi-
cates through the use of the indeﬁnite that it is strange and wondrous. Yes, 
it is indeed wondrous. For when it is born, a world of darkness dies and 
is wrapped up and cast into nothingness. But on its death another world 
of darkness is resurrected and raised to life. It is as though it is ﬁre that 
when extinguished leaves as its legacy a world full of smoke. The person 
struck  by  it  therefore  should  examine  it  attentively  and  not  glance  at  it 

VERSE 19-20 – THE SECOND PARABLE ABOUT THE DISSEMBLERS

superﬁcially due to familiarity, for in this way he may discover the subtle 
art of divine power.

Having heard these descriptions the listener is moved to ask: “ What did 

they do? Did they attempt anything? ” So the Qur’an says: 
I H G F E D C B  indicating that [ the dissemblers ] 
have no refuge and no place of recourse, and are like drowning men who 
clutch at what cannot be clutched at. In their terror, they use their ﬁngers 
instead of just the ﬁngertips, as though their alarm is beating them on the 
hands so they stuff their hands in their ears out of pain, and in their stupid-
ity they block up their ears so the thunderbolts do not strike them. Follow-
ing this, the listener’s mind [ continues to ] investigate and he asks: “ Is this 
calamity general, or is it particular, that [ escape is still ] hoped for? ” And 
[ the Qur’an ] replies: M L K inferring that the disaster is a pen-
alty for their ingratitude for bounties. Allah the Most High punishes them 
through  it  for  their  remaining  exceptions  to  the  divine  laws  deposited  in 
general run of beings ( al-jumhūr ).

When [ the listener ] hears the violent peals of thunder, he asks himself: 
“ Won’t the lightning be useful for them by lighting up their way? ” So [ the 
Qur’an ]  says: R Q P O  indicating  that  just  as  the  thunder  is 
inimical  to  them  and  they  are  unable  to  hear,  so  the  lightning  is  hostile 
towards them with its light, blinding their eyes. Then hearing that the uni-
verse  is  united  in  its  hostility  towards  them,  the  listener’s  mind  calls  out: 
“ What  will  happen  to  them?  What  can  they  do?  What  are  they  trying  to 
do? ” So [ the Qur’an ] says: \ [ Z Y X W V U T indicat-
ing that they are confused, hesitant, and bewildered, watching for the slight-
est opportunity and the smallest glimpse of the road. Whenever it appears 
to  them  they  move  forward,  but  with  their  anguished  spirits,  jerkily  like 
decapitated hens, and then become frozen to the spot. 

So by way of enquiry the listener’s mind asks: “ Why don’t they die, or 
become completely blind and deaf, and be saved from their anguish? ” And 
[ the  Qur’an ]  says: c b a ` _ ^  that  is,  they  do  not 
deserve to be delivered from their plight. For this reason, [ divine ] will does 
not cause them to die. If it were to act, it would take away their hearing and 
sight. It is more ﬁtting for those who are recalcitrant and deviate from the 

148

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

laws of the Most High that they retain their ears to hear their punishment and 
their sight to see it.

Containing  all  these  points,  from  beneath  its  exterior  the  story  hints 
at  divine  sublimity  and  power,  and  the  disposals  of  the  Most  High  in  the 
universe, especially the marvels of the thunder, lightning, and clouds. On 
recalling this, with his conscience aroused the listener declares: “ Glory be 
to Him! How great the power of the One whose awesomeness the universe 
manifests, and whose wrath these calamities display! ” So [ the Qur’an ] said:  
j i h g f e
Now for the relationships between the constituents of the phrases
Know  that  the :  of ; :  indicates  that  [ the  dissemblers ]  repre-
sented in the comparison are divided into two sorts, and is a sign that there is 
a true correspondence both between the two parables, and between them and 
[ the condition of ] the dissemblers, and that there is an indisputable similarity 
between them. Moreover, the : comprises the [ intensifying conjunction ] 
ْلَ(cid:92)  a l - t a r q i y y a  ” [ meaning, but rather, no on the contrary, but, indeed ], for 
“  
the second parable is more terrifying. The lack of correspondence between 
; and the dissemblers [ that is, the dissimilarity between them, because 
the  dissemblers  are  being  likened  to  the  rainstorm ]  necessitates  that  the 
thing [ the rain ] does resemble is implied ( m u q a d d a r  ). This implied thing is 
not stated for conciseness and the words are made concise [ that is, the pur-
pose of the ellipsis is ] to make the meaning prolix, and the prolix meaning is 
referred to the listener’s imagination so he may seek further meanings from 
the context. Thus by reason of this lack of correspondence [ the Qur’an ] is 
as though saying: “ or they resemble people who journey through the empty 
desert  and  dark  night  and  are  struck  by  many  calamities  resulting  from  a 
violent rainstorm. ” The replacement of the familiar friendly word ‘rain’ ٌرَ(cid:143)َ(cid:174) 
with “ r a i n   c l o u d ;   d o w n p o u r   ٌبّ
ِ(cid:193)َ(cid:134)  ” infers that the droplets of the rain are 
each calamities ( m a ṣ ā ’ i b  ) pelting down on them like bullets ﬁnding their 
mark ( t u ṣ ī b a h u m  ), and that [ the dissemblers ] have nowhere to shelter.

The  explicit  mention  of  “ ( lit.  from )  i n  

t h e   s k y  = <   ”  [ stating ] 
speciﬁcally that the rain comes from the sky alone, is to express general-
ity. That is, the sky is speciﬁed to make it absolute ( i ṭ l ā q  ), as in the verse 

VERSE 19-20 – THE SECOND PARABLE ABOUT THE DISSEMBLERS

149

( 6:38 ) K J I H G F E D C that is, the rain has taken posses-
sion of the whole face of the sky. Some Qur’anic commentators concluded 
from = < here and from the verse 
( 24:43 ) Þ Ý Ü Û Ú Ù Ø ×  that the rain falls from the body ( j i r m  ) 
of  the  sky,  and  some  of  them  even  imagined  the  existence  of  an  ocean 
beneath the sky, but [ the science of ] rhetoric ( a l - b a l ā g h a  ) does not endorse 
this. No, the meaning is “ from the direction of the sky, ” and the sky is speci-
ﬁed for the above-mentioned reason. Moreover, [ since ] the word “ s k y  ” is 
used [ generally ] for everything above you, the clouds and atmosphere [ may 
also be said to be ] the sky.

Veriﬁcation of the Subject ( t a ḥ q ī q  a l - m a q ā m  ): If you consider [ divine ] 
power, [ you will see that ] all sides are equal [ before it ]; that is, the rain may 
fall from any direction. 

And  if  you  consider  divine  wisdom,  [ you  will  see  that  it ]  establishes 
the optimum order in things, necessitating the preservation of the general 
balance,  and  that  it  chooses  the  most  direct  means.  As  for  the  rain,  it  is 
[ formed ] through the condensation of the water vapour dispersed through 
the  globe  of  the  atmosphere,  one  of  the  ten  constituents  of  which  is  this 
vapour in its depths.

An Elucidation of This: When divine will commands the [ water ] mol-
ecules, they comply and steal away from all around. They join forces and 
become  rain-laden  clouds.  Then  on  the  orders  of  their  commander  they 
condense and become raindrops. The angels, who are the representatives 
of the laws [ in force in the universe ] and reﬂect its order, take them by 
the hand so they do not crowd together [ in masses ] and strike each other, 
and they take them down to the ground. In order to preserve the balance 
of the atmosphere, the seas and earth vaporize to replace what has been 
lost through distillation. The reason some people imagined the existence 
of a heavenly ocean was their conceiving of ﬁgures of speech as facts. For 
to  portray  the  green  of  the  atmosphere  as  the  colour  of  the  sea,  and  the 
atmosphere as containing more water than the Paciﬁc Ocean, is a simile 
( t a s h b ī h  ) not distant from the reality.

Consider the verse: ( 24:43 ) Þ Ý Ü Û Ú Ù Ø ×  and understand 
that to dwell on its apparent meaning although it has kindled a light with 

150

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

its metaphor ( i s t i ‘ ā r a  ) is to be coldly insensible and literalist. For just as 
the verse ( 76:16 ) y x w  contains a ﬁne metaphor, so does Ý Ü Û Ú 
Þ consist of one that is singularly strange and beautiful. The food dishes 
of paradise are made neither of crystal nor of silver, but have the transpar-
ency of crystal and the shining whiteness of silver. This is indicated by the 
fact that crystal is not made of silver and that they are different materials, 
and  also  by  the  use  of  [the  partitive]  “of x  ”.  Similarly, Þ Ý Ü Û Ú 
contains two metaphors which in the listener’s view are founded on poetical 
imagining.  This  imagining  is  based  on  observing  an  analogy  and  like-
ness between the representation of the higher world and formation of the 
lower one. And this observation is based on the idea of a beauty contest 
between the earth and the sky and a competition in the garments clothed 
on  them  by  the  hand  of  power.  It  is  as  though  when  the  earth  appears 
with its mountains clothed in the white garments of snow and ice in the 
winter,  and  is  turbaned  with  them  in  the  spring;  and  when  in  the  sum-
mer  it  is  adorned  with  its  colourful  gardens,  presenting  to  the  view  of 
wisdom  through  its  transformations  the  miracles  of  divine  power;  the 
atmosphere responds by imitating it and competing with it in displaying 
the miracles of divine sublimity. It appears veiled, attired in the broken 
clouds like towering mountains, hills, and valleys. Tinted with various 
colours, it depicts the earth’s gardens, intimating with the most shining 
of evidences divine splendour and majesty. 

In consequence of this vision and mutual resemblance and imaginary 
vista, the simile of the clouds was greeted favourably in Arabic styles of 
speech, especially the summer clouds being likened to mountains, ships, 
gardens, valleys, and caravans of camels, as may be heard in the oratory of 
the Arabs. Thus, in the view of [ the science of ] rhetoric [ or eloquence ] it 
seems that the summer clouds are travelling ﬂoating in the skies, with the 
thunder [ as a shepherd ] tending them [ like a ﬂock ] and spurring them on 
[ with its shouts ], whenever it shakes the staff of its lightning at them in 
the oceans of the skies, the clouds quiver and are convulsed. They appear 
like mountains crumbling on doomsday, or ships tossed about in a storm, 
or gardens quaking with earth tremors, or a caravan ﬂeeing from the attack 
of bandits. Nevertheless, [ the clouds ] do travel and are swept along; it is 
even as if all the molecules of water vapour lie hidden and silent in their 
places awaiting the orders of their Creator. Then when the thunder booms 

VERSE 19-20 – THE USE OF METAPHOR

151

out like a military bugle: “ Gather together and form ranks! ”, vying with 
each other they leap up from their places and run with all speed to the one 
summoning them, and are resurrected as clouds. Then having performed 
their duties and received the order to retire, they all ﬂy off to their eyries. 
It is because of this imaginary relationship and the proximity and neigh-
bourliness between the clouds and the mountains – for in order to draw up 
moisture the cloud forms on the mountain in accordance with its size and 
it wears its dress; and because the cloud has the colour of the snow and 
ice and is fashioned through their moisture and coldness; and because of 
the brotherhood between the mountain and the cloud, and their exchang-
ing forms and dress in many places in the Qur’an, and their shaking hands 
in the Revelation as they converse and embrace each other on many lines 
of the page of the earth in the book of the world; and as you see the cloud 
resting on the mountain so that the mountain is like a dock or anchorage 
for the ships of the clouds, or a place where they take counsel, or a nest 
on  which  they  alight  –  it  is  because  of  all  these  things  that  in  the  view 
of  eloquence  they  deserve  to  be  neighbours,  exchanging  and  borrowing 
things. Thus, it calls the clouds mountains without the use of the particle 
[ of likening ka- ]. 

If  you  have  understood  all  you  have  heard  about  these  relationships, 
[ you  will  have  understood  that ] Ù Ø ×  means  from  the  direction 
of the sky, and Û Ú  means clouds like mountains, and Þ Ý means in 
respect of their colour, moisture, and frigidity. So since there is an interpre-
tation acceptable to the science of rhetoric, what makes you believe that the 
rain [ which ] falls in two minutes [ comes ] from a distance of ﬁve hundred 
years in opposition to Allah’s wisdom, who makes everything with the ﬁnest 
art and precision? 

The relationships and positioning of the phrase: ? > 
The aim of this is to intimidate. The precedence of > is a sign that with 
their  imaginations,  both  the  terriﬁed  calamity-struck  [ dissemblers ]  and 
the listener fancy that the darkness of many dark nights has been emptied 
entirely into this night. Then its being said that the darknesses are within the 
rain [ the cloudburst ] although it is vice-versa, suggests that the frightened 
men suppose space to be a pool ﬁlled with rain, and the night to be contained 
within it, interspersed between its molecules. 

152

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

?  being  plural  alludes  to  their  variety:  the  darkness  of  the  black 
clouds and their denseness and covering the whole sky, the heaviness of 
the rain and the largeness of its drops, and the compounded darkness of 
the night. 

And the word ? is indeﬁnite because [ the darknesses ] are unknown 
and  particularly  because  those  addressed  are  ignorant  of  them.  And  [ its 
being indeﬁnite ] is also corroborative [ for not knowing is a sort of dark-
ness ].

As for the phrases “ a n d   t h u n d e r   a n d   l i g h t n i n g  ” A @ their aim is 
to portray the bewilderment and alarm [ of the dissemblers ], and [ to indicate 
that ] disaster-struck and bafﬂed, they focus all their attention on the least 
signiﬁcant event. For scrutiny leads a person to understand the wondrously 
strange  revolutions  and  changes  in  the  thunder  and  lightning.  But  when 
[ the  dissemblers ]  see  the  darkness  invading  the  universe  and  swallowing 
up beings – like nothingness – their bewilderment is turned into orphanlike 
grief  and  they  fall  silent  as  the  dead.  For  they  see  the  clearest  evidences 
of  existence,  the  utterance  of  those  lofty  beings  [ the  thunder ],  then  their 
appearance when the veil is lifted [ on the ﬂashing of the lightning ], and they 
are ﬁlled with consternation, bewilderment and fear. For when they see the 
boundless darkness in inﬁnite space, which they can in no way overcome, 
they look in despair. But then, when those darknesses are suddenly emptied 
out of space and vanish and everywhere is ﬁlled with light, their absolute 
despair is transformed into hope.

Know that thunder and lightning are two clear signs from the World of 
the Unseen. They are in the hands of the angels appointed to the world of 
the clouds to oversee the ordering of its laws. Divine wisdom ties causes and 
their effects, and when clouds are formed from water vapour dispersed in 
the atmosphere, some of them are charged with negative electrons and oth-
ers with positive electrons. When two come close to each other, they collide 
suddenly and lightning is produced. Then on one cloud staging an assault 
and being suddenly uprooted, and its place being ﬁlled by another so there 
should be no vacuum, the layers oscillate and undulate which produces the 
sound of thunder. However, these atmospheric conditions occur within the 
order and laws represented by the angel of thunder and lightning.

The rain ( cloudburst ) being shown to contain [ the thunder and lightning ] 
although [ in reality ] it is the clouds that contain them is because the terriﬁed 

VERSE 19-20 – THE SECOND PARABLE ABOUT THE DISSEMBLERS

153

[ dissemblers ], and the listener who is alarmed at their terror, look on the 
pelting rain as encompassing everything since it is encompassing them. 

The use of the singular for the thunder and lightning although darknesses 
is plural indicates that the source of the calamity-stricken dissemblers’ fright 
is their imagining the sky to be speaking and menacing them with its thun-
der,  and  the  ﬂashing  lighting  revealing  [ their  dreadful  situation ].  These 
are the verbal meanings [ m a ‘ n ā   m a ṣ d a r ī  – and such meanings are singu-
lar ] 1 and [ resemble ] “ t h e   s h i n i n g   h a n d . ” 2 Also, each is a different sort of 
being ( n a w ‘  ), although there are numerous instances of each, [ and what is 
intended is the sort, not the individual instances of them ].

“ T h u n d e r  ”  and  “ l i g h t n i n g  ”  are  indeﬁnite  since  they  are  not  qualiﬁed 
by  adjectives;  that  is,  [ the  ‘nunation’  signiﬁes  implied  adjectives  such 
as ] crashing thunder and dazzling lightning. It indicates too that [ the dis-
semblers ]  are  unfamiliar  [ with  their  reality ]  because  all  their  attention  is 
focussed on the curious aspects of them. It also hints that they do not recog-
nize the thunder and lightning because they have stopped up their ears and 
shut fast their eyes.

The parts of the phrases: I H G F E D C B 
This sentence is the reply to an implied question and a ﬁne commence-
ment  [ i s t i ’ n ā f   –  that  is,  it  is  not  tied  to  what  precedes  it ].  For  when  the 
listener  addresses  himself  to  this  emotional,  parabolic  story  ( a l - q i ṣ ṣ a  
a l - ḥ i s s i y y a   a l - t a m t h ī l i y y a  ),  he  feels  an  intense  desire  to  discover  the  cir-
cumstances  of  the  calamity.  Once  this  is  depicted  perfectly,  his  curiosity 
is satisﬁed and he then desires to learn the condition of the calamity-struck 
men. He as though asks: “ What state are they in now? What are they doing 
to save themselves? ” And the Qur’an replies saying: 
I H G F E D C B  That  is,  there  is  no  escape  for 
them; they are like drowning men clutching at straws, for they try to protect 
themselves from the heavenly projectiles by blocking up their ears. But that 
is impossible and they cannot be saved.

The word B  is used instead of ‘they put into’ َنوُ(cid:171) ِ(cid:114)ْدُ(cid:192) as a sign that 
they  searched  for  some  means  [ of  escape ]  but  the  only  thing  they  could

such bewildering circumstances the listener conjures up in his imagination

and perpetual renewal [ of the calamity ], and in this continuance is a sign

The use of C instead of ‘ﬁngertips’ indicates their complete confu-
And E D  alludes to their awful fright at the sound of the thunder, 
making them imagine that the thunder is going to enter their ears and their 
spirits will ﬂy out of the doors of their mouths. In this is a subtle sign that 
they did not open their ears to the call of truth and good advice so are being 
punished in this way by the crash of thunder; that is, as they blocked them 
up [ voluntarily ] in the ﬁrst instance, so they are [ forcibly ] blocked up in the 
second. Like someone who says something disgraceful is hit in the mouth, 
and he puts his penitent right hand over his mouth and covers his eyes with 
his ashamed left hand.

G F  indicates that the thunder and lightning united to harm them, 
for the thunder( bolt ) comprised both a terrible noise and scorching ﬁre, fell-
ing whomever it encountered. 

As for I H it hints that the calamity has reached its ﬁnal point and 
the knife has hit the bone. Everything is ﬁnished except life, and now they 
are concerned with nothing except fear of death and the wish to save their

Consider this: The conjunction و necessitates a relationship between two 
clauses, and here it is between the implied outcome of the previous [ phrase ] 
and  this  one.  It  is  as  though  the  conjunction  is  denouncing  them,  saying: 
“ These  are  people  who  ﬂed  from  town  life  and  loathe  civilization.  They 
rebelled against the law that makes the night the time of rest, and did not 
comply  with  the  advice  they  were  given.  Now  they  suppose  they  can  be

encompassed by Allah’s tribulations. ”

The  word  ُ

recourse and solace for those smitten by disaster is Allah’s mercy, and when 
they come to earn His wrath that hope is extinguished.

The  word  L  infers  that  those  all-encompassing  calamities  are  the 
works of the Most High’s wrath. Just as the sky, clouds, thunder, and night 
are assaulting them from all six directions, so the Most High’s wrath and 
His tribulations surround them. Moreover, the Most High’s knowledge and 
power encompass all beings, and His command embraces all particles. So 
it is as though L is declaiming at them: “ T h e y   c a n n o t   p a s s   b e y o n d   t h e  
r e g i o n s   o f   t h e   h e a v e n s   a n d   e a r t h , ”( see, 55:33 ) and 

( 2:115 ) l k j i h  
M The [ preposition ] ب preﬁxing this suggests that [ the dissem-
blers ] have happened upon the very thing they were ﬂeeing from and have 
become the target for its arrows.

This latter phrase indicates that the image of those represented, that is, 
the dissemblers, is portrayed in the mirror of the parable. This is so that the 
listener’s mind should not be diverted by the parable and he does not forget 
the  aim.  It  also  indicates  that  the  parable  and  those  portrayed  in  it  are  so 
similar they are virtually the same; the difference between them has almost 
faded away so they seem identical and reality and imagination have merged. 
The phrase also signiﬁes the gloominess of their hearts, for their consciences 
torment them too with their faults and crimes. Those who receive requital 
for their crimes are not easy in their consciences.

Now the parts of the phrase: R Q P O
This  is  apparently  unconnected  [ to  the  previous  phrase  and  therefore ] 
implies that the listener is asking: “ Why don’t they take advantage of the 
lightning to reduce the calamity of the darkness for themselves? ” And he 
is told: “ They are scared of its harm more than [ wanting ] its advantages. ”
By  reason  of  its  well-known  property O  points  to  the  loss  of  their 

sight, but for some reason they did not lose it completely. 1

Q  Since this word is usually used with ghouls  and eagles it denotes 
here a subtle instance of eloquence that ﬂashes in the brain and indicates that 
the lightning races with the eye’s beam to see which can reach things ﬁrst 
to capture their images. It overtakes it and cuts it short, and strikes it on the 
eyelid, extinguishing its light. It is as though when the eye’s light speedily 

1.  ُداَ(cid:167)َ(cid:192) ،َداَ(cid:166)     means on the point of, almost, hardly.

156

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

quits its home to capture the images of things, the lightning, which is the 
beam of the sky’s eye, races against it and seizes the image from it before it 
can get it home. That is, the lightning swipes the image from the eye.

And by virtue of [ the eyes ] being the mirror of the heart, R alludes 

to the dissemblers’ eyes being blind to the decisive proofs of the Qur’an.

Now for the parts of the phrases: \ [ Z Y X W V U T 
The fact that this is a fresh start [ and not apparently related to what pre-
cedes it ] ( i s t i ’ n ā f  ) indicates that it is the answer to the questions the listener 
asks when he sees all these different calamities and asks about [ the dissem-
blers’ ] circumstances in both situations. 

The fact that T precedes V U and the ﺍﹶﺫﹺﺇ precedes Z indicates 
[ the  dissemblers’ ]  intense  desire  for  light,  seizing  on  the  least  light  they 
can. [ For the former means ‘whenever’ denoting numerous occasions, and 
the latter means ‘when and if.’ ] “ Whenever ” also comprises an analogous 
conditional syllogism. 

The [ preposition ] “ t o  ( ل )  ” in V U signiﬁes causation ( a l - a j l i y y a  ) 
and beneﬁt, and is a sign that the terriﬁed calamity-stricken [ dissemblers ] 
are plunged in [ concern for ] their own needs so that they suppose the light 
that the hand of power is spreading through the world for thousands of gen-
eral instances of wisdom is meant for them alone, and that the hand of power 
is sending it for their sake.

Although [ the dissemblers ] should seize the opportunity [ of the light ] 
to travel on quickly, [ the word ] “ t h e y   a d v a n c e  ( lit. walk ) W  ” [ is used ], 
indicating that the calamity has held them back and they can only move for-
ward slowly at walking pace. 

The [ pronominal sufﬁx -h i  ] in X [ referring to the light ] indicates that 
the distance they move forward is [ that permitted by the brief instant of ] the 
light, which is the colour of time. Thus it as though limits them as to space.
The  [ conjunction ]  ( و )  in   Y  indicates  that  the  calamity  is  continu-
ous, which increases its severity. And since contrarily to T “ w h e n  ﺍﹶﺫﹺﺇ  ” 
expresses particularity and neglect [ since the generalizing sufﬁx -mā has not 
been added ], it points to their extreme revulsion [ at the darkness ] and their 
blindness, and that it seizes them when they are lost in the instant of [ light ], 
[ which affords them ] an opportunity.

VERSE 19-20 – THE SECOND PARABLE ABOUT THE DISSEMBLERS

157

The  ascription  of Z  to  the  lightning  alludes  to  darkness  after  light 
being more intense, and indicates that when in their imaginations the calam-
ity-struck [ dissemblers ] see the lightning [ ﬁrst ] banishing the darkness but 
then ﬁlling where they are found with it, they fancy that [ the light ] has been 
extinguished, leaving only smoke behind.

“ A r o u n d   ( lit.  on,  against )  t h e m   [   ”  infers  harm  and  indicates  that 
the darkness is not imposed by chance but is a punishment for their actions. 
It indicates too that the terriﬁed [ dissembler ] imagines the darkness to be 
ﬁlling the sky and is directed at him among all beings, despite his insigniﬁ-
cance and contemptibility, and that its assaults and harm are aimed at him 
in particular.

The use of “ t h e y   s t a n d  [ up ]  s t i l l  \  ” instead of ‘they become still, 
stop’ اوُ(cid:179)َ(cid:167)َ(cid:126) is a sign that due to the calamity and their strenuous efforts [ to 
combat it ] they had become bent at the waist as though bowing in prayer, 
which is characteristic of a person who works earnestly at something, [ and 
had straightened up when the darkness struck them ].

Now for the parts of the phrase c b a ` _ ^ :
Being a conjunction, the و hints that the hand of power acts under the veil 

of causes and that wisdom superintends from above all causes. 

ْوَ(cid:170)  comprises  a  non-analogous  conditional  syllogism  ( q i y ā s   i s t i t h n ā ’ ī  ); 
that is, its not having been willed is the reason ( ‘ i l l a  ) for their [ hearing and 
sight ] not being lost; similarly, their not being lost is evidence that divine 
will has not caused them to be lost. It is also a sign that the conditions for 
their being lost have been virtually fulﬁlled.

_ indicates that the only thing binding cause and effect is divine will 
and wish, and it is divine power that executes [ the act ]. Causes are merely 
a veil to divine dignity and grandeur so that the hand of power is not seen 
by the mind’s eye [ , which sees only the apparent, ] to be in contact with 
lowly things.

The explicit use of the name f is an indication [ warning ] people against 
their addiction to causes and restraining them from becoming immersed in 
them. It also invites minds to see the hand of power behind all causes.

The omission of the object of the verb _ although such an object is nec-
essary according to the usual rules, is permissible here due to the associated 

158

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

meanings ( q a r ī n a  ) of other words. The omission infers that divine wish and 
will are not affected by the events of the universe, and that things have no 
effect on the divine attributes, whereas human will is affected by things and 
their beauty and ugliness, and greatness and smallness. 

 a  indicates  that  causes  do  not  have  control  and  supremacy  over 
effects so that if they were to be raised, the effects would remain in a vac-
uum, the playthings of coincidence and tossed around by chance; rather, the 
hand of power is present behind causes. When it plucks things out [ of non-
existence ] the hand of divine wisdom takes them through the law of balance 
and order, and sends them to other places; it does not neglect them. [ For 
example, ] when heat breaks down the structure of water, through the order 
[ laws ]  included  in  the  air  the  steam  follows  a  determined  course  and  its 
Maker sends it to a speciﬁed place. Similarly, in ¡ is a sign that [ man’s ] 
ﬁve external senses are not produced by nature and that there is nothing to 
necessitate the cavities of the eyes and ears; they are the gifts and bounties 
of the Most High. Cavities and causes are merely the usual conditions [ for 
their existence ].

The verb ¡ is made transitive by the following [ preposition ] ب in 
b a instead of with ‘h a m z a ’; [ that is, the IVth form of the verb ]. 
This is a sign that the hand of power does not take things by the reins of 
causes,  nor  are  they  free  to  wander  with  their  halters  hanging  from  their 
necks; rather their halters are [ ﬁrmly ] in the hands of [ the laws and ] order. 

Since “ h e a r i n g  ” is in the singular and “ s i g h t  ” is in the plural, 

c b indicates that one thing is audible, while numerous things 
may be seen, for a thousand men may hear the same thing at the same time, 
but what they see will be different.

The parts of the phrase  j i h g f e 
Consider this: This phrase is a summary of the study of horrors in the 
parable and [ the people ] portrayed in it. It indicates that just as the details of 
the calamity-stricken [ travellers’ ] circumstances, which represent faithfully 
the dissemblers’ circumstances, are not neglected [ by divine power ]; so the 
disposals of divine power are to be seen in every minute particle. 

Together with indicating that this statement is an unshakeable truth, the 
particle e alludes to the vast breadth and delicateness of the matter, and 
to human impotence, weakness, and faultiness concerning it, arising from 

VERSE 19-20 – THE SECOND PARABLE ABOUT THE DISSEMBLERS

159

[ man’s ]  delusions,  which  are  the  consequence  of  his  doubts  concerning 
matters of certainty. [ That is, with its certainty, e dispels the doubts. ]

The explicit use of the name f alludes to proof of the statement [ of His 
omnipotence ], for total, all-embracing power is the necessary inherent qual-
ity of the Godhead.

As for g it indicates that divine power, which brings things out of non-
existence,  will  not  let  them  go  for  nothing,  futile  and  vain;  rather,  divine 
wisdom will oversee them and supervise their being raised and reared.

h  suggests that the works of causes, as well as the results ( a l - ḥ ā ṣ i l   b i ’ l -
m a ṣ d a r  )  of  [ man’s ]  voluntary  actions,  are  [ brought  about ]  through  the 
power of the Most High.

i having the meaning of “ t h i n g   w i l l e d   b y   A l l a h  ءي(cid:131)َ(cid:174)  ” indicates that 
after coming into existence, beings cannot be independent of their Maker; 
indeed, they are in need of His efﬁcacy for their continuance – which is the 
repetition of existence. 

As for the use of the word j rather than j [ the active participle ], 
is a sign that divine power cannot be measured like determined things, for 
it  is  an  unchanging  necessary  inherent  quality  that  accepts  no  increase  or 
decrease. It is impossible for its opposite, impotence, to encroach on it, or 
for any [ degrees of ] intensity or weakness [ to intervene in it ]. It is a sign 
too that power is like the basic verbal pattern in [ Arabic ] grammar, that is, 
َلَ(cid:151)َ(cid:158) for all the attributes of action ( a l - a w ṣ ā f   a l - ﬁ ‘ l ī y y a  ), such as Provider 
( a l - R a z z ā q  ), Forgiving ( a l - G h a f f ā r  ), Giver of Life ( a l - M u ḥ y ī  ), Dealer of 
Death ( a l - M u m ī t  ), and so on. [ That is, power is their basis. ]

Now reﬂect well and long on what you have heard!

Introduction
You should know that it is worship that instils the tenets of belief [ in the 
believers ] making them a very part of their character. For if matters pertain-
ing to the conscience and reason are not nurtured and strengthened by wor-
ship, which consists of carrying out Allah’s commands and abstaining from 
His prohibitions, they remain ineffectual and weak. The present state of the 
Islamic world testiﬁes to this.

Know too that worship is the cause of happiness in this world and the 
next, and is a means of ordering life here and there, and a cause of attainment 
and  perfection,  both  individual  and  collective.  It  is  an  exalted,  esteemed 
relation between Creator and bondsman.

There are several reasons worship is the cause of happiness and prosper-

ity in this world, which is the tillage of the hereafter: 

F i r s t l y :  Man has been created with a strange, subtle nature distinguishing 
him from all other living beings and making him an exception to them. By 
virtue of this there have arisen in him the desire to choose, and the wish for 
the most beautiful things and for ﬁne decoration, and a natural desire to have 
a livelihood and position beﬁtting humanity.

For his food, dress, and accommodation – the need for which arises due 
to the above-mentioned desires – to be prepared proﬁciently man has need 
of multiple arts and crafts, but he is incapable of practising all of these on 
his own. He needs therefore to mix with his fellow men and to co-operate 
with them, and for all of them to assist each other and exchange the fruits 
of their labour. However, since so as to allow men’s progress by means of 
the mainspring of the will the All-Wise Maker placed no innate limits on the 
[ three ] human powers of appetite, anger, and intellect – as with the animals 

160

VERSE 21-22 – ABOUT WORSHIP

161

and their limited powers – tyranny and aggression have arisen. And since 
no limit has been placed on them, the powers [ tend to ] aggression and the 
[ human ] community is in need of justice when exchanging the fruits of its 
labour. But because the intellects of single members of society are incapable 
of  comprehending  justice,  the  human  race  as  a  whole  needs  a  general  or 
universal  intellect  [ to  establish ]  justice  from  which  all  may  beneﬁt.  And 
that intellect is the universal law, and that law is the Shari‘a. Then in order 
to preserve the effectiveness of the Shari‘a and its enforcement, a lawmaker 
is necessary, someone to lay claim to it and promulgate it, an authority, and 
that is the Prophet ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). 

Then  in  order  to  perpetuate  his  outward  and  inward  domination  over 
[ people’s ]  minds  and  hearts  the  Prophet  needs  to  be  eminently  superior 
both physically and spiritually and morally, and in conduct and appearance, 
and by nature and in character. He is in need too of proof of the strength 
of his relations with the Lord of All Sovereignty, the Master of the World, 
and such a proof is his miracles. Then in order to secure obedience to [ its ] 
commands and avoidance of [ its ] prohibitions he is in need of perpetuating 
the idea of the Maker’s grandeur, the Master of all Sovereignty, and that is 
[ possible ] through the manifestation of the tenets of belief. Then in order to 
perpetuate this idea and ﬁx the tenets of belief ﬁrmly in [people’s] minds, he 
needs a constantly repeated reminder and renewed act, and that reminder is 
nothing but worship.

S e c o n d l y :  The purpose of worship is to turn minds towards the All-Wise  
Maker.  And  this  turning  towards  induces  obedience  and  submission,  and 
this includes [ the worshippers ] under the perfect order [ in the universe ] and 
binds them to it. To follow this order leads to the realization of the mystery 
of wisdom, and the wisdom is testiﬁed to by the perfect art in the universe.

T h i r d l y :   Man  resembles  a  pole  to  the  top  of  which  are  joined  electric 
cables, for attached to his head are the tips of all the laws of creation; the 
natural laws extend to him, and the rays of the divine laws and principles in 
the universe are reﬂected and centred on him. So man has to complete them 
and adhere to them and cling on to them to facilitate the general current lest 
his foot slips and he falls and is crushed under the wheels of the machinery 
turning in the levels [ of the world ]. And this is achieved through worship, 
which consists of conforming to the commands and prohibitions.

F o u r t h l y :  By complying with the commands and prohibitions, numerous 
connections are formed for a person with the many levels of society, and the 
individual becomes like a species. For many of the commands, especially 

162

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

those  that  touch  on  the  marks  [ of  Islam ]  and  the  general  good,  resemble 
threads to which are tied [ people’s ] honour and through which their rights 
are set in order. If it were not for them, all those rights and duties would be 
torn up and scattered to the wind.

F i f t h l y :  The Muslim has ﬁrm relations with all other Muslims and there 
are strong bonds between them. By reason of the tenets of belief and [ the 
Muslims’ ] Islamic traits, these relations give rise to unshakeable brother-
hood and true love. And it is worship that makes manifest the tenets of belief 
and renders them effective, and roots them ﬁrmly in the pysche.

How worship is the cause of personal attainment and perfection

Consider this: Together with being physically small, weak, and powerless, 
and being one of the animals, man bears within him an exalted spirit, and has 
vast potentiality, unrestricted desires, inﬁnite hopes, uncountable ideas, and 
unlimited powers, and he has a nature so strange he is as though an index of 
all the species and all the worlds. As for worship, it expands his spirit and 
raises his value; it causes his abilities to unfold and develop, allowing him to 
become worthy of eternal happiness. Worship is also a means of rectifying 
and purifying his inclinations, and of realizing his hopes and making them 
fruitful, and of marshalling his ideas and setting them in order, and also of 
reining in and limiting his [ three ] powers [ of appetite, anger, and intellect ]. 
Worship  also  removes  the  rust  of  nature  from  his  members,  physical  and 
spiritual, each of which when transparent is like a window onto his private 
world and that of humankind. Also, when performed with both conscience 
and mind and heart and body, worship raises man to the dignity of which he 
is worthy and to his appointed perfection. It is a subtle, elevated relation, an 
illustrious lofty connection between the bondsman and the One Worshipped. 
This relation constitutes the utmost degree of human perfection.

Sincerity in worship is this, that it is performed only because it is com-
manded,  although  it  comprises  numerous  instances  of  wisdom  [ and  ben-
eﬁts ].  Each  of  these  may  be  a  reason  ( ‘ i l l a  )  for  performing  worship,  but 
sincerity makes it imperative that the [ true ] reason be the command to per-
form it. If the wisdom or beneﬁt is made the reason, the worship is null and 
void,  but  if  it  merely  encourages  the  person  to  perform  the  worship,  it  is 
permissible.

When  those  addressed  hear  the  words  n m l   they  ask 
through the tongue of disposition: “ Why and for what reason? What is the 
wisdom in it? Why should we? And what for? ” You learnt the wisdom in the

Introduction

...¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´ ³ it proves prophethood.

An Introduction
Explaining Certain Points [ arising from ] This Verse

Consider this: A proof ( b u r h ā n  ) is [ in the form of ] either the argument 
from material cause to material effect ( l i m m ī  ), or the argument from effect 
to cause ( i n n ī  ). This latter is sounder and it is either based on contingency 
( i m k ā n ī  ),  that  is,  the  argument  that  since  contingent  beings  are  equal  in 
respect of being and non-being there must be [ a Necessary Being ] to choose 
this ( a l - m u r a j j i ḥ  ); or it is based on createdness ( ḥ u d ū t h ī  ); that is, the argu-
ment that since there is constant change and renewal in beings, there must be 
One to give them existence ( a l - m ū j i d  ). Each of the above proofs is in respect 
of either the essences of things or their attributes, and in respect of either the 
giving of existence or the continuation of it. And all of them are either the 
proof that things are given existence out of nothing ( d a l ī l   i k h t i r ā ‘ ī  ) or the 
proof of divine providence ( d a l ī l   ‘ i n ā y a t ī  ). The present verse alludes to all 
these  types  of  proof.  Included  here  is  [ only ]  a  summary  of  them,  for  we 
have explained them in detail in another book. 1

The proof of divine providence ( d a l ī l   ‘ i n ā y a t ī  ) is the proof of the Maker 
indicated by this verse and consists of the order included in the universe. 
For the order is a thread to which is attached all beneﬁts and instances of 
wisdom. All the Qur’anic verses that enumerate the beneﬁts of things and 
mention  their  purposes  are  ‘the  weaver’  of  this  proof  and  are  where  this 
argument is manifested. For just as the order, with which all the instances 
of wisdom and beneﬁts comply, proves the existence of the Orderer, so it 
demonstrates the Maker’s intention and wisdom, and repulses the delusion 
of blind chance and unseeing coincidence. 

Now see! If you cannot encompass this elevated order, adorned with bez-
els of wisdom, with your sight, and you are incapable of understanding it 
through inductive reasoning, look through the prying eyes of the sciences 
– which are the senses of your species and are formed through the meeting 
of minds and conjunction of ideas, and are like the ideas of the human race – 
for you will see an order that dazzles the mind. You will know too that each 
of the physical sciences discloses through the universality of its principles, 

1.  Nursi, M u h â k e m a t , 107 ff. ; Eng. tr: R a t i o n a l   A r g u m e n t s , 113-26.

164

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

the order and harmony, the more perfect than which cannot be conceived of. 
For there is a science [ to study ] every area ( n a w ‘  ) of the universe, or there 
will be [ that is, each could sustain a science ]. 

Science  consists  of  universal  principles,  and  this  universality  demon-
strates the beauty of the order. For there can be no universality in something 
without  order.  Don’t  you  see  that  if  we  say:  “ All  religious  scholars  wear 
white turbans, ” it is conﬁrming the universality, for there is order among 
that group ( n a w ‘  )? It leads on from this that by reason of the universality 
of their principles, all the sciences demonstrate through inductive reasoning 
a total, all-embracing order; each is a shining proof pointing to the beneﬁts 
and fruits hanging in bunches from the links of the chains of beings, indicat-
ing too the instances of wisdom and advantages concealed in their chang-
ing states. The sciences raise the banner of divine unity and testify to the 
Maker’s purpose and wisdom. Each of them is a shining star piercing the 
darkness and repulsing the devils of delusion and doubt.

If you like, now disregard the general [ order ] and consider the follow-
ing example: a microscopic organism so small it is invisible to the naked 
eye comprises an extremely ﬁne and wonderful divine machine. Necessarily 
and self-evidently, this machine, which is contingent in both its essence and 
attributes and states, did not come into existence of itself without a cause. 
Like the pans of some scales, contingent beings are equal in respect of both 
existence and non-existence; if one preponderates, they remain in non-exist-
ence. Thus, as all reasonable people agree, there has to be a cause to make 
the choice. It is impossible that this should a natural cause. For the exquisite 
order of [ the machine ] necessitates inﬁnite knowledge and perfect intelli-
gence, and it is impossible to conceive of these in such causes, about which 
[ the Naturalists ] deceive themselves. The causes are simple, few, and life-
less and cannot specify their course or restrict their motions, hesitant as they 
are between thousands of possibilities, some of which have no primacy. So 
how does [ a cause ] follow a speciﬁc course and travel a deﬁned path, and 
how can it choose certain aspects of the possibilities so that it produces this 
marvellous, well-ordered machine the subtlety of the instances of wisdom 
of which leave minds in astonishment? You could only convince yourself 
and feel happy at it if you ascribed to every single particle the intelligence 
of Plato  1 and wisdom of Galen  2 and you believed that all these particles 

1.  Plato ( c. 428-348 BC ), the great Athenian philosopher and pupil of Socrates and 

teacher of Aristotle. His most famous work is T h e   R e p u b l i c .

2.  Galen, the Greek physician and philosopher of the 2nd century AD who for centuries 

was the supreme authority in medicine.

VERSE 21-22 – PROOFS OF THE MAKER AND HIS ATTRIBUTES

communicated with each other. And this is a sophistry that would put even 
the Sophists to shame.

Although the forces of attraction and repulsion form the basis of physical 
matter in the smallest indivisible atoms, this appears to be the combining of 
opposites. Yes, the law of attraction and that of repulsion and others are the 
names of the laws of divine practice and the Most High’s Shari‘a of Creation 
( a l - s h a r ī ‘ a t   a l - ﬁ ṭ r i y y a  ), which is called nature. Such laws are acceptable on 
condition they do not cease being principles and become nature, and exist 
only in the mind and are not ascribed external existence, and do not cease 
being merely theoretical and become real, and do not cease to be seen as 
means and are considered effectual. 

Now if you have understood this example [ of the microscopic organism ] 
and you have seen its vastness despite its inﬁnitesimal size, and its breadth 
despite its narrowness, raise your head and observe the universe: you will 
see the clarity of the proof of divine providence ( d a l ī l   a l - ‘ i n ā y a  ) and that it 
is as clear and obvious as the universe. All the Qur’anic verses that recount 
the bounties of things and recall their beneﬁts manifest this proof. When the 
Qur’an enjoins reﬂective thought, it generally directs the one it addresses to 
the method of this [ deductive ] reasoning ( i s t i d l ā l  ): 
( 67:3 ) K J I H G F As for this verse, how [ clearly ] it points to 
this proof:

( 2:22 ) © ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤
The  proof  that  things  are  given  existence  out  of  nothing  ( a l - d a l ī l  
a l - i k h t i r ā ‘ ī  ), which is alluded to by the verse t s r q p is 
this: Allah the Most High gave every species and all the members of each, 
a particular being which is the source of its particular works and the perfec-
tions of which it is worthy. Since all species [ and realms of beings ] are con-
tingent, as are the never ending chains of causes, none can go back in unbro-
ken succession to pre-eternity. Also, since there is [ constant ] change in the 
world, it proves [ the world’s ] createdness, sometimes through observation 
and sometimes through rational necessity. It has also been demonstrated by 
biology and botany that there are more than two hundred thousand sorts of 
species and that each has a progenitor and forefather. Contingency and cre-
atedness prove therefore that necessarily these progenitors and forefathers

emerged  without  intermediary  from  the  hand  of  divine  power.  Moreover, 
[ causes ] cannot be imagined [ at the ﬁrst creation ] as they are imagined in 
the chains of causes. Furthermore, the delusion of the splitting off of some 
species from others is invalid. For [ since either the offspring are barren or 
the line becomes extinct, ] an intervening species mostly does not become 
the  start  of  new  chains  through  reproduction.  It  is  most  likely  therefore 
that since the origins and beginnings are thus, the successive members will 
also  be  thus.  How  can  it  be  imagined  that  simple,  lifeless  natural  causes, 
which are devoid of intelligence and will, should be capable of bringing into 
existence these chains [ of beings ] which astound the mind, and of creating 
( i k h t i r ā ‘  ) the individual beings, each of which is a marvel of art and miracle 
of divine power? Hence, all beings and the chains of which they are parts 
testify decisively through the tongues of their createdness and contingency 
to the necessary existence of their Creator, may His glory be exalted.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Why when there is this decisive testimony do peo-
ple believe in such misguided [ ideas ] as the pre-eternity of matter and its 
motion?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  If a person looks at something indirectly he may con-
sider the impossible to be possible, like the old man searching the sky for 
the  crescent  moon  of  the  festival  ( ‘ ī d  )  saw  the  white  hair  resting  on  his 
eyelid [ and thought it was ] the moon. For by virtue of his lofty essence and 
noble nature, man pursues truth and right. And if the false and invalid fall 
into his hand, then involuntarily – so long as he has not sought or searched 
for it – but because of his superﬁcial, indirect view, he is forced to accept it. 
Because when he ignores the order [ of the universe ], which is the thread [ to 
which is tied ] all the instances of wisdom, and fails to see the contrariness of 
the motion [ of particles as the source of matter ] and the pre-eternity of mat-
ter, it becomes possible in his indirect view to ascribe the unique embroider-
ies and wondrous art to blind chance and unseeing coincidence. As al-Jisrī 1 
has said, if someone who enters a palace ﬁlled with the embellished works 
of civilization does not see its owner, he will believe that it has none and will 
be forced to ascribe the building and its decorations to chance, coincidence, 
and the laws of natural selection. Moreover, when he ignores the testimony 
to  a  total  will,  all-encompassing  knowledge,  and  perfect  power  of  all  the 
instances of wisdom and uses and beneﬁts in the order of the world and is

heedless of them, it will appear possible to him – since he sees them by the 
way – to prove the actual effect of lifeless causes. 

Now how about this! Disregard the subtleties of the Most High’s art and 
study the most obvious of the works called “ nature ” and that is the visible 
manifestation ( i r t i s ā m  ) and reﬂection [ of things ], on condition you rend the 
veil of familiarity: how can your soul be convinced and your reason accept 
that the properties of the face of a mirror can constitute an effective cause 
conducive to revealing the face of the skies and attracting [ and reﬂecting ] 
in its glass its image with its altitude and inscribed with stars? And how can 
your reason be persuaded that in reality the imaginary thing called gravity 
is an effective cause holding the earth and stars with their motions and rota-
tions in ﬁrm order?

I n   S h o r t :  If a person looks at something impossible and invalid super-
ﬁcially and by the way and does not see the true cause, he may deem it to 
be possible and valid. But if he considers such a thing intentionally and for 
itself, and studies it as his own, it is impossible that he should accept any 
of those matters that they drone on about in natural philosophy, unless he is 
so foolish as to suppose all minute particles possess the intelligence of the 
philosophers and the wisdom of the politicians!

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  What are nature and the laws and forces that they 

mutter about and try to console themselves with?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Nature is a pattern, not a source; it is a printing press,  
and  not  the  printer;  it  is  a  code  of  laws,  and  not  a  power;  it  is  the  divine 
Shari‘a of Creation, which imposes an order on the acts of the limbs of the 
Manifest World’s body. Just as the Shari‘a is the product and summary of 
the rules governing voluntary acts, and the system of government is the sum 
of political principles; so the Shari‘a and order are two theoretical matters 
that exist only in the mind; and so too nature is a theoretical matter that is the 
summary of Allah’s external practices in creation. The delusion of its exter-
nal  existence  is  like  a  savage  imagining  when  he  sees  a  military  division 
performing disciplined drill that the soldiers are tied together with [ physical 
strings  that  have ]  external  existence.  It  is  people  with  the  consciences  of 
savages, therefore, who imagine that because of its continuance nature has 
effective external existence.

In Short: Nature is the art of Allah the Most High and the code of His 
creational laws. Its laws are the articles of the code, and its forces, the mat-
ters of the articles.

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

Now for the proof of divine unity ( d a l ī l   a l - t a w ḥ ī d  ), indicated by n 
that is, ‘profess Allah’s unity’ اود ِ
ّ(cid:110)و . According to the commentary of Ibn 
‘Abbas  it  is  as  follows:  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  has  omitted 
nothing  from  its  proofs  of  divine  unity.  Sufﬁcient  evidence  is  the  proof 
[ called ] b u r h ā n   a l - t a m ā n u ‘  contained in the verse 
( 21:22 ) ¶ μ ´ ³ ² ± °  it  is  a  shining  beacon  [ proving ]  that 
independence is a necessary essential and inherent quality of the Godhead. 
This verse [ also ] alludes to a subtle proof of divine unity which is [ indi-
cated by the following: ] the co-operation of the heavens and earth and their 
relations in producing the products [ to support ] the livelihoods of mankind 
and the animals; the similarity of the works in the world, and all sides of it 
embracing each other, each taking the other by the hand so to complete the 
order; the mutual response of its different parts to each other’s needs; all of 
it looking to a single point; and all being in regular motion on the axis of 
a single order. All this implies, indeed states clearly that the Maker of this 
single machine is One. So too it recites the lines: 

ّ(cid:178)َا ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) ُ

 1 ٌد ِ(cid:110)اَو ُهَ

ِلﯭﯦ ىِ(cid:158)َو

ّل ُدَ(cid:98) ٌةَ(cid:192)ٰا ُهَ(cid:170)  ٍء ْي َ(cid:130)  ّ
Now consider this: the Maker is necessarily existent and one, so too He 
is qualiﬁed by all the attributes of perfection. For whatever the traces of per-
fection found in an artefact, they are derived from the shadow of the mani-
festation  of  its  Maker’s  perfection.  So  necessarily,  the  beauty,  perfection, 
and goodness of the Maker ( May His glory be exalted ) must be of a degree 
inﬁnitely higher than all the beauty, perfection, and goodness found in the 
universe. For beneﬁcence ( i ḥ s ā n  ) is derived from the wealth of the Beneﬁ-
cent ( a l - M u ḥ s i n  ) and is evidence for it, and the giving of existence ( ī j ā d  ) 
proves the existence ( v u j ū d  ) of the Giver of existence ( a l - m ū j i d  ), and mak-
ing necessary proves the existence of one who makes necessary, and mak-
ing beautiful points to the beauty of one who makes beautiful. Moreover, 
the  Maker  is  exempt  from  all  defects,  for  defects  arise  from  the  essential 
inability of material beings and the Most High is free of materiality. So too is 
He free of the attributes necessarily arising from the contingent essences of 
beings. Glory be unto Him! There is none like unto Him, May His glory be 
exalted! He alludes to these two truths with His words: ¯ ® ¬ «

VERSE 21-22 – PROOFS OF THE MAKER AND HIS ATTRIBUTES

169

Now for the proof of contingency ( a l - d a l ī l   a l - i m k ā n ī  ), which is alluded 
to by the verse, ( 47:38 ) Æ Å Ä Ã you see that in respect of its 
essence  and  all  its  attributes  and  every  one  of  its  states  and  all  its  facets, 
every single atom in the universe [ exists ] hesitant and wavering amid end-
less possibilities. Then suddenly one springs to life, stands, and follows a 
speciﬁc  path;  it  is  clothed  in  particular  attributes  and  assumes  an  orderly 
state  and  mounts  an  apposite  law;  it  is  turned  to  a  ﬁxed  destination;  then 
it yields wise results and beneﬁts that could be obtained only in that deter-
mined way. Does it not proclaim in its particular tongue its Maker’s inten-
tion and wisdom, enunciating them clearly? 

Just  as  each  particle  singly  is  a  proof,  so  its  evidence  multiplies  as  it 
becomes a part of ever-growing compounds one within the other. For it has 
a  position  in  each  compound,  and  it  has  relations  in  each  position,  and  it 
has functions resulting from each of the relations, and each of its functions 
bears the fruit of beneﬁts and uses. At each degree it recites with its tongue 
proofs of the necessary existence of its Maker. It resembles a soldier, [ who 
has relations and duties ] in his platoon, his regiment, his division, and so on.
∗ ∗ ∗

Now  we  commence  with  the  positioning  and  ordering  ( naẓm )  of  the 
above-mentioned  verse  in  respect  of  [ ﬁrstly ]  the  relationship  ( naẓm )  of 
the verse as a whole with what preceded it, [ secondly ] the relationships of 
some of its phrases, and [ thirdly ] the relationships between the parts of the 
phrases. 

The positioning of this verse and its relationship
with what preceded it

Having spelled out the categories of human beings; the pious believers 
charged with worship, the obdurate disbelievers, and the wavering dissem-
blers, the Qur’an now addresses all of them with the words: 
n m l It makes this the consequence of what preceded it in the 
same way that a building follows the plan, and commands and prohibitions 
pertaining to actions proceed from laws [ that exist as ] knowledge, and the 
divine decree ( a l - q a ḍ ā ’  ) is executed in accordance with divine determin-
ing ( a l - q a d a r  ), and composition and creation follow on after the story and 
quotation.  For  when  [ the  Qur’an ]  mentions  the  three  different  [ groups ] 
and  describes  their  characteristics  and  outcomes,  it  is  paving  the  way  for 
the  [ main ]  subject  and  alerting  the  listener[ s ].  Then  it  addresses  [ them ] 

170

directly. This regard, I mean its referring to them ﬁrstly in the third person, 
then here addressing them directly, is a device ( lit. point ) generally [ accept-
able to the literary science of ] a l - b a y ā n . It is this: when either the virtues or 
vices of a person are mentioned by degrees, it alerts and excites [ the listen-
ers ] and increases in [ them ] feelings of either admiration or disgust. These 
gradually grow stronger until they drive [ the listeners ] to speak in person to 
the person concerned. Here, as required by the context ( m a q ā m  ) and to sat-
isfy those wishes of the listeners, the speaker ( a l - m u t a k a l l i m  – the Qur’an ) 
fetches the person, brings him to their presence and addresses him directly. 
This contains a point particular to this context, which is to alleviate the 
burdens of the obligation [ of worship ] with the pleasure of being addressed 
directly.

It  indicates  furthermore  that  in  worship  there  are  no  intermediaries 

between the Creator and His bondsman.
The relationships between the phrases

The phrase n m l addresses all the people of every class of 
the three groups, of the past, present, and future: O genuine believers who 
worship  surely  and  regularly!  O  middling  [ worshippers ],  try  to  increase 
your worship! O disbelievers, perform your worship and all it entails con-
nected  to  belief  and  the  afﬁrmation  of  divine  unity!  And  O  dissemblers, 
worship with true sincerity! Thus, the word n here is like a shared word 
expressing many meanings. So ponder over this!

o that is, worship Him for He is the lord who raises and sustains you! 

It is encumbent on you to be a bondsman who worships and serves Him.

A  Short  Note:  In o  is  a  subtle  allusion  to  the  contingency  of  the 
essences [ of those addressed ]; and in | { z y is a sign indicat-
ing the contingency of their attributes, and t s r q p hints 
at the createdness of their essences and attributes. Also, the following verses 
offer clear evidence that the essences of those addressed are contingent: 

  ( 53:42 )  è ç æ  ( 47:38 )  Æ Å Ä Ã
 ( 6:91 ) Q P O N M L K J  ( 26:77 )   μ ´ ³ ² ± °
 ( 13:28 ) å ä ã â á  ( 51:50 ) × Ö Õ

Now think of further examples in the same way!

VERSE 21-22 – ABOUT WORSHIP

171

As for the phrase q p Know that when Allah the Most High com-
mands worship, which necessitates three things: ﬁrstly, the existence of the 
object  of  worship  ( m a ‘ b ū d  );  secondly,  His  unity;  and  thirdly,  His  ﬁtness 
to be worshipped, He replies to these three implied questions by indicating 
three evidences of them: the evidences of [ His ] existence, which are of two 
sorts: those in the outer world ( ā f ā q ī  ) and those in man’s self ( a n f u s ī  ). The 
latter are also of two kinds: evidences in the self ( n a f s ī  ) and those pertain-
ing to origins ( u ṣ ū l ī  ). [ The Qur’an ] alludes to evidences in the self ( n a f s ī  ), 
which are the nearest and most evident, with the phrase  q p and to 
those pertaining to man’s origins with t s r

As for the positioning of  v u  know that since the Qur’an relates 
worship to [ men’s ] creation and that of their forefathers, it necessitates two 
points: 

T h e   F i r s t :  [ Human beings ] being created with a propensity to worship 
and their having the ability to be conscious of and fear Allah ( al-taqwā ), so 
[ much so ] that anyone who observes such an ability would expect worship 
from them. Like someone who sees [ an animal’s ] claws understands that 
they are for tearing at or grasping things. 

T h e   S e c o n d :   That  the  purpose  of  their  creation,  and  the  function  with 
which they are charged and the perfection to which they are turned, is the 
fear of Allah. This is the most complete and perfect worship.

That is to say, v u that is, the aim of your creation, and your 
perfection, and that for which your innate disposition has been made, is the 
consciousness of Allah and fear of Him.

Now for the phrase | { z y This points out the most likely 
evidences of the Most High’s existence furnished by the outer world. It is 
also an allusive rebuttal of the actual effectiveness of causes, which is the 
source of a sort of associating partners with Allah ( s h i r k  ); that is, its ascrib-
ing the spreading-out of the earth, or its preparation as man’s cradle, to the 
Most High and not to nature.

The phrase ~ } indicates by mentioning the sky, which is con-
tiguous with the earth, the most elevated of the simple proofs in the outer 
world.

172

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

Then with the phrase £ 5  4 ﮯ [ it indicates ] the evidence of 
their Maker’s existence [ offered by ] compound beings and things animal, 
vegetable, and mineral.

Moreover, all the previous phrases point to proof of [ the Maker’s ] exist-
ence. Similarly, as a whole they indicate His unity. And the way they are set 
out indicates the order [ of the universe ] and alludes to the bounties. With 
the evidence [ offered by ] © ¨ it establishes the ﬁtness of the Most High 
to be worshipped, for it is compulsory to thank the bestower of bounties. 
© ¨  also  indicates  that  just  as  the  earth  and  things  animal,  vegetable 
and mineral have been made to serve you, so you should serve the One who 
subjugated them to you.

Now the positioning [ and relationships ] of  ¯ ® ¬ « : Know 
that extending from its position are lines to o n m l and to 
q p  and  to z y x  and  to ﮯ  That  is,  when  you  worship 
your Lord, associate no partners with Him, for it is He who is the Lord and 
Sustainer,  and  is  your  Creator  and  the  Creator  of  the  human  race;  do  not 
set up lords and masters in derogation of Allah; and because it was He who 
created the heavens and made them the roof to your dwelling-place, so do 
not believe that natural causes have an actual effect, which is the source of 
idolatry; and because it is He who sends down rain to the earth for your food 
and livelihoods. There is no bounty but His, so thanks and worship are due 
to Him alone.

The positioning and relationships of the parts of the phrases

Consider  this:  The  interjection  [ introductory  to  the  vocative ] l  in 
the phrase n m l appears frequently in the Qur’an since it con-
tains [ a number of ] ﬁne points. Here the address is corroborated in three 
respects: by the ﺎﹶﻳ which is to arouse; by the  ُ
ّيَا [ the purpose of ] which is to 
distinguish; and by the اَ(cid:182) [ the purpose of ] which is to alert. For the address 
here alludes to three beneﬁts: the replacing of the hardship of the obliga-
tion [ of worship ] with the pleasure of [ being ] address[ ed ], and [ informing 
that ] the only means of man’s progress from the depths of absence to the 
[ high ] station of presence is worship. It indicates too that those addressed 

VERSE 21-22 – ABOUT WORSHIP

173

are  charged  in  three  respects:  in  respect  of  their  hearts,  with  submission 
and obedience; in respect of their intellects, with belief and afﬁrming divine 
unity; and physically, through action and worship. 

[ The  address ]  infers  too  that  those  addressed  consist  of  three  groups 
[ the believers, the unbelievers, and the dissemblers ]. It hints too at the three 
classes of the elite, the middle class, and the mass of the people. It betokens 
too the familiar manner and order of things, which is that a person ﬁrst of all 
calls out to a person to stop him, then he recognizes his features and turns to 
him, then he addresses him and gets him to do something.

I n   S h o r t :  The above subtle points [ in the use of the vocative case ] cor-
roborate and reinforce the address [ by ] establishing the mentioned aspects 
[ and meanings ]. 

Concerning the interjection ﺎﹶﻳ since it is addressing the people and they 

consist  of  various  classes  including  the  heedless,  the  absent,  the  idle,  the 
ignorant, and so forth, it both arouses the heedless, and summons the absent, 
and calls the idle to action, and informs the ignorant, and arrests the busy, 
and  gives  direction  to  those  who  turn  away,  and  excites  the  lovers,  and 
encourages the seekers, and urges the perfected to increase [ their worship ], 
and it also gives people a jolt.

The distance [ inferred ] by the ﺎﹶﻳ although the context ( m a q ā m  ) is one 

of propinquity [ and worship ], indicates the grandeur and sublimity of the 
obligation and its trust ( a m ā n a   a l - t a k l ī f  ).

It alludes too to the distance from when and where the address appeared, 

of the times and places of those on whom the obligation has been laid.
So too it is an allusion to the depths of mankind’s heedlessness.

As for the  ُ

ّيَا it is used to single out [ a person or a group ] from the mass 
and  infers  that  the  whole  universe  is  being  addressed,  and  humankind  is 
speciﬁed since men bear the trust in the form of “ f a r ḍ   k i f ā y a  ” [ that is, it is 
human beings that are charged with performing worship ]. So if they are lax 
[ in doing this ], they transgress against the rights of all [ other ] beings. 

Also, in  ُ

ّيَا is an eloquent subtlety in that its conciseness is followed by 
the descriptive m  Then the اَ(cid:182) being a substitute for the second part of 
the genitive construction indicates that [ its purpose ] is to alert those sum-
moned with the vocative interjection ﺎﹶﻳ

174

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

m : Being an active participle derived from [ the verbal noun ] n i s y ā n , 
meaning forgetfulness, it indicates censure or reproof. That is, “ O you peo-
ple! How can you forget the pre-eternal covenant ( a l - m i t h ā q   a l - a z a l ī  )? It 
indicates too an excuse; that is: “ O you people! Your neglect can be due 
only to a mistake or forgetfulness; it can’t be deliberate or serious! ”

As for n since it is the conclusion ( or apodosis ) of the general sum-
mons to all the classes [ of people ] mentioned above, it points to obedience, 
and indicates sincerity, and hints at continuance, and alludes to divine unity. 
That is, obey! Be sincere and constant [ in worship ]! Increase [ your wor-
ship ]! Profess the divine unity!

o indicates that just as worship should be desired and sought since 
it is an elevated relation, an illustrious connection; it should be sought too 
since it is [ a way of ] serving and offering thanks to the One who nurtures 
and raises you, of whom you are in need.

Now for the parts of the phrase: t s r q p
As a relative pronoun, p is known only in so far as it is qualiﬁed by the 
relative clause. [ For instance, all that is known about “ the one who went ” 
is that he has gone. ] Thus, [ here  َ
ّبَر being governed by p  ] it infers that 
knowledge of Allah the Most High can only be in respect of His actions and 
works, and not His essence. 1

Then by virtue of its signifying determined, regular creation rather than 
the [ mere ] giving of existence ( ī j ā d  ) or giving rise to ( i n s h ā ’  ), “ c r e a t e d  
َقَ(cid:171)َ(cid:114)  ” indicates that by nature the human being is turned toward the obliga-
tion [ of worship ]. It infers too that worship is a duty, for it is the result and 
‘wage’ of creation. But [ this wage is not the reward for worship; ] the reward 
is purely a favour of Allah the Most High.

Because of the uncertainty of [ who or what is governed by ]  َن(cid:192) ۪ذَ

ّ(cid:170)َا it is as 
though hinting: “ Nothing is now known of those who came before you and 
have died and departed. You are tottering on the brink of the grave, so take 
a lesson and don’t be deceived by this world. Be steadfast in worship, the 
means to everlasting happiness. ”

Concerning v u  ,  َ

ّلـَ(cid:151)َ(cid:170)  signiﬁes  hope,  and  when  it  precedes 
something desirable it is used to increase eagerness, and when it precedes 

1.  See, Nursi, İ ş â r â t ü ’ l - İ ’ c a z  [ Abdülmecid ], 169.

VERSE 21-22 – ABOUT WORSHIP

175

something  repugnant,  its  function  is  to  put  [ the  listener ]  on  his  guard. 
Here, the hope cannot refer literally to the Speaker [ that is, to Allah ], so it 
is either ﬁgurative ( m a j ā z  ), or refers either to the addressee or to observers 
or listeners.

If if refers to the Speaker, it is a parabolic metaphor ( i s t i ‘ ā r a  t a m t h ī l i y y a  ). 
[ For instance, ] if one equips a person with the gear for a job, one hopes and 
expects that he will do it. In the same way, Allah has decked out humanity 
with the potentiality to be perfected, and the capacity [ to perform the reli-
gious ] obligations, and the means of will. 

The metaphor indicates too that the purpose ( ḥ i k m a  ) of man’s creation is 
fear of Allah and consciousness of Him ( t a q w ā  ). It also infers that worship 
results in the degree ( a l - m a r t a b a  ) of fear of Allah. So too it is a sign that the 
fear of Allah is the highest degree.

Moreover, in the style of kings, the metaphor suggests encouragement 

and the holding out of hopes and [ the making of ] certain promises.

If [ the hope signiﬁed by  َ

ّلـَ(cid:151)َ(cid:170)   ] refers to those addressed, it is as though 
saying: “ Worship seeking [ to aspire to ] the fear of Allah, between fear and 
hope. ” This implies that man should not feel conﬁdent about his worship. It 
suggests too that he should not sufﬁce with his [ present degree of worship ], 
but should conﬁrm the saying “ it is incumbent on you to act without cease ” 
and look beyond the degree at which he is found [ and aspire to more ].

And if [ the hope signiﬁed by  َ

ّلـَ(cid:151)َ(cid:170)   ] refers to observers and listeners, it 
is as though whoever observes human beings equipped with such abilities 
and potentialities will hope and expect worship from them – just as a person 
who sees the claws and fangs of a predator will expect it to be rapacious. It 
indicates too that worship is required by man’s inborn nature.

Since  the  fear  of  Allah  results  from  the  worship  of  all  the  classes  [ of 
men ] mentioned previously, the words v allude to all [ types and ] lev-
els of t a q w ā . That is, t a q w ā  [ preventing ] the  association of partners with 
Allah ( s h i r k  ), t a q w ā  [ preventing the committing of ] grievous sins, t a q w ā  
[ causing one ] to preserve one’s heart from [ attachment to ] things other than 
Allah the Most High, and t a q w ā  [ causing one ] to avoid [ things leading to ] 
punishment, and  t a q w ā  [ causing one ] to restrain oneself from anger. It is 
also a hint that [ true ] worship is that which is [ performed ] with sincerity. 
And it indicates that worship should be the sole aim, and not a means, and 
suggests too that worship should not be [ performed in the hope of ] reward 
or [ to avoid ] punishment.

176

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

Now the elements of the phrase ~ } | { z y x
Consider this: By describing the vastness of the Maker’s power, this indi-
cates that it is spurring [ the people ] on to worship, and by mentioning His 
favours encouraging [ them ]. It is as though saying: “ O man! The One who 
subjugates the earth and heavens to you deserves your worship. ” 

It  also  indicates  man’s  virtue  and  his  high  worth  and  his  nobility  in 
Allah’s  sight,  as  though  saying:  “ You  should  show  through  worshipping 
the One who has ennobled you by making the heavenly and lowly bodies 
[ in such a way ] that you might beneﬁt from them despite their vastness, that 
you are worthy of His favour. ” 

Moreover,  it  is  a  hint  rebutting  chance,  coincidence,  and  the  [ actual ] 
effect of nature. That is: “ All the attributes you see [ in nature exist ] through 
the making of a Maker, the intention of an Intender, the speciﬁcation of a 
Speciﬁer, and the order of an Orderer. How sublime is His wisdom! ”

So too it infers rebuttal of the Naturalists’ school, and that of the Sabeans, 

which gave rise to the school of idolators ( a l - w a t h a n i y y ī n  ).

Furthermore,  it  draws  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  attributes  of  bodies 
point through their contingency to the Maker. For their atoms are equal in 
that they can assume [ an inﬁnite number of ] general states and modes, and 
all contingent attributes are hesitant amid a great many possibilities. So in 
respect  of  their  attributes  and  states  all  [ physical ]  bodies  are  in  need  of 
intention, purpose or wisdom, and the specifying of one to specify [ these ]. 
As for the precedence of  z it indicates that the earth has been spread 
out for man; as though it is only man who beneﬁts from it, and the rest [ in 
this respect ] are superﬂuous. Ponder over this carefully!

|  indicates  a  ﬁne  point  of  eloquence  which  is  the  strange  fact  that 
although the earth’s nature requires that it should have been submerged in 
water, [ it was not ] and this implies that it was spread out contrarily to its 
nature.  For  according  to  this,  the  water  should  have  overrun  the  [ whole ] 
globe. But in His wisdom and mercy, the Maker drew out a part of it and 
spread it out and laid on it the table of His bounties. 

Similarly, in accordance with the rule “ If a thing is proved, it is proven 
together with the things it necessitates, ” the word | [ derived from the 
verb f a r a s h a  to spread out ] indicates that the earth is like the carpeted ﬂoor 
of a house, and the species of plants and animals it contains like its furniture, 
placed in it intentionally and purposively. 

VERSE 21-22 – ABOUT WORSHIP

177

It suggests also that intentionally and purposively [ the state of ] the earth 
is a middling one; it is neither so liquid that it cannot be walked upon, nor is 
it so hard that it cannot be utilized or tilled. For if it had been thus it would 
have been useless even if made of gold. Its intermediate [ state ] therefore 
indicates that it has been speciﬁed, made, and intended by one [ who acts ] 
with wisdom and purpose.

~ } indicates this, that when the Most High made the heavens a 
canopy and roof for you, its stars became your lamps, so don’t imagine that 
chance [ has any part ] in their dispersal, as you might imagine it does if you 
scatter some jewels on the ground.

In this verse is the hint, the suggestion, the intimation of a wondrously 

subtle and precious mystery, which is as follows:

•   I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Man is a mere atom in relation to the earth, and the 
earth is an atom in relation to the universe. Similarly, a human individual is 
an atom relatively to the human race, and the human race is an atom com-
pared  with  its  partners  in  beneﬁting  from  this  lofty  home.  Moreover,  the 
extent to which mankind utilizes the house’s advantages and aims is [ only ] 
an atom’s [ worth ]. And its aims that the human intellect can perceive are 
a [ mere ] atom in relation to the uses [ existent ] in pre-eternal wisdom and 
divine knowledge. So how is it that [ the Most High ] created the earth for 
humankind and made man’s utilizing it its ultimate aim?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Yes, that’s right, but despite all that, on account of 
the breadth of man’s spirit and the expanse of his intellect and extent of his 
abilities, and the many, far-ﬂung ways in which he utilizes the universe; and 
because of the absence of overcrowding and fragmentation and resistance 
in respect of its utilization, like the relation of the whole with its parts – for 
the whole is present in its entirety in all its parts and there is therefore no 
crowding and no fragmentation; the Qur’an made man’s utilization the ulti-
mate aim although it is only one out of the myriad aims of the heavens  and 
earth, and that is how it appears to man. That is, man beneﬁts from the earth 
as though it were the courtyard of his house and the heavens were his roof. 
The stars are lamps for him and the plants, his food, so each [ person ] has the 
right to say: “ My sun, my skies, my earth. ” Now think about this together 
with your reasoning faculty!

Now for the particulars of  © ¨ § ¦ ¥   ¤ £ 5  4 ﮯ
Consider this: The [ implied ] pronoun in  َلَزْ(cid:178)َا [ referring to Allah ] indi-
cates that the raindrops are sent down with an intentional balance and with 

178

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

wisdom [ and purpose ]. In fact, each droplet is encompassed by a particular 
order, as is suggested by none of them ever colliding with its brothers dur-
ing its long descent despite the buffeting of the air. This announces that the 
raindrops are not left to their own devices, but that the reins of each are held 
by an angel representing the order and reﬂecting it.

The use of the noun in 5  4 although a pronoun would have been in 
place [ since it is repetition ], infers that what is intended is the direction of 
the sky, not from the sky itself (  ا(cid:183)ُ(cid:174)ْر ِ(cid:106)   ).

The use of the word £ although what falls is snow, hail, and rain, indi-

cates that water is the source nearest and most useful. Indeed, 
( 21:30 ) s r q p o n While its being indeﬁnite suggests that it 
has wondrous properties and a strange structure and that its chemical com-
pound is unknown to you.

The  conjunction  ف  in ¤  is  so  positioned  as  to  follow  on  without 
break, but there is a [ considerable ] delay between the falling of the rain and 
the  bringing  forth  of  the  fruits.  This  implies  such  [ missing ]  sentences  as 
“ ... the earth trembled and swelled, then grew green and produced every sort 
of plant in pairs, and q   ” As for the [ implied ] pronoun of q [ which 
refers  to  Allah ],  it  indicates  that  the  fruits  are  not  brought  forth  through 
mere reproduction or compounded substances, but that the All-Wise Maker 
creates and raises them through attributes and characteristics not present in 
their physical matter.

¥ : Since the true meaning of [ this preposition of instrument qualifying 
“ w a t e r  ” ], that is, to afﬁx or bring close ( i l ṣ ā q  ), has absorbed [ the meaning 
of ] causality, it indicates the luscious freshness of the fruits. For contrary 
to its nature, the water rises to them and ﬁlls their goblets at close quarters.
 § ¦  :  According  to  Sibawayh,  since  [ the  partitive ]  ْنِ(cid:174)  does  not 
entirely lack the meaning of a subject [ it cannot be the object of   َجَرْ(cid:114)َا  ] and 
this indicates that the object will vary according to the understanding of the 
listener[ s ]; that is, “ such various fruits as you feel appetite for. ”

As for the ‘nunation’ ( indeﬁniteness ) of  ¨ it indicates that the causes 
by which you obtain this sustenance are unknown to you, for it comes to you 
from where you would not expect.

VERSE 21-22 – ABOUT WORSHIP

179

And ©  is  a  hint  strengthening  the  meaning  of  gracious  bestowal.  It 
infers too that the sustenance is for you, but there is no harm if others proﬁt 
from it after you. Also it implies that the Most High has singled you out for 
His bounties, so you should offer thanks to Him alone. 

The positioning [ and relationships ] of the parts of  ¯ ® ¬ « 
The “  ف  - ( t h e n  or s o  ) ” [ of «  ] looks to the four sections [ above ]: 
that is, He is the true Object of Worship, so associate none other with Him; 
He is absolutely Omnipotent and the heavens and earth are in the grasp of 
His power, so don’t believe that He has any partners; He is the Bestower of 
[ all ] bounties so offer your thanks to none but He; and He is your Creator, 
so don’t imagine that He has any partners.

The use of  ¬ instead of اوُدِ(cid:163)ـَ(cid:99)ْ(cid:151)َ(cid:98) indicates the meaning of the verse  
( 53:23 ) μ ´ ³ ² ± That is, meaningless names you imagine exist 
and are of your own making.

The precedence of ® : By drawing immediate attention to [ Allah ] shows 
on the one hand the necessity of [ remembering Him ]; while on the other it 
infers that the reason for the prohibition is the fact that partners are associ-
ated with Him.

¯ : [ The singular ]  ْدِ(cid:178) has the meaning of like, equal, or peer, and 
anything  ‘like’  the  Most  High  will  be  His  exact  opposite;  between  them 
will be contrariety. In this is a subtle hint that the [ term ] rival or equal is 
essentially futile. Then the use of the plural indicates the utter ignorance of 
those who associate partners with Allah ( a l - m u s h r i k ī n  ), and infers derision 
of  them:  “ How  can  you  ascribe  to  Allah,  who  is  without  like,  hordes  of 
equals and opposites? ” 

It also infers the rejection of all sorts of partners; partners in His essence, 
in His attributes, and His actions. It intimates too rebuttal of every type of  
associator of partners with Allah: the pagans ( a l - w a t h a n i y y ū n  ), the Sabeans, 
the Christians ( a h l   a l - t a t h l ī t h  ), and the Naturalists, all of whom believe that 
causes have an actual effect.

Note: The source of paganism or idolatry is either the deiﬁcation of the 

stars or the indwelling or incarnation of Allah.

± °  :  Like  similar  concluding  phrases  of  verses  ( f a w ā ṣ i l  ), 
this indicates that the source of Islam is knowledge ( a l - ‘ i l m  ) and its basis 

180

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

is reason ( a l - ‘ a q l  ), and that it accepts the truth and rejects sophistry and 
delusion.

Moreover,  through  its  conciseness  in  attaching  no  object  to  the  verb 
± [ the Qur’an ] prolongs the speech. That is, “ You know now that 
other than Him there is no true object of worship and no creator or possessor 
of absolute power or bestower of bounties. And you know too that all gods 
and idols are nothing and are incapable of doing anything. They are all cre-
ated, mere inventions you have fancied. ” You should give this due thought!

An Introduction Verifying Prophethood

Ö Õ Ô Ó Ò
An Introduction Verifying Prophethood
Consider this: Just as the previous verse proves the ﬁrst of the four main 
aims of the Qur’an, and that is divine unity ( a l - t a w ḥ ī d  ), so this one ( 2:23 ) 
proves the second, the prophethood of Muhammad ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ), 1 through the most consummate of his miracles, which was 
his challenging [ opponents ] with the Qur’an’s miraculousness and inimi-
tability ( i ‘ j ā z  ). We have set out evidences of his prophethood in detail in 
another book 2 and a part of them is summarized here in six topics.3

The First Matter

It  may  be  concluded  from  the  circumstances  of  the  prophets,  through 
inductive reasoning ( a l - i s t i q r ā ’  a l - t ā m m  ) and the analogy known as ‘hid-
den’ ( a l - q i y ā s   a l - k h a f ī  ), [ based on ] the unvarying order [ in similar things ], 
that the pivot and basis of the prophets’ missions, and their dealings with 
their  communities  were  found  most  perfectly  and  completely  in  Muham-
mad, Upon whom be blessings and peace, who was the master of mankind at 
the time of its maturity. This furnishes the best possible argument and proof 
that he was also the Messenger of Allah. For through the tongues of their 
miracles  all  the  prophets  as  though  testiﬁed  to  Muhammad’s  truthfulness 
( Upon whom be peace ), who was a luminous proof of the Maker’s existence 
and unity. Now reﬂect on this!

1.  In fact, the second aim of the Qur’an is prophethood generally. But Muhammad’s 
( UWBP ) prophethood may be said to be thus since it was universal and included the es-
sence of the previous prophets’ teachings. See, Nursi, İ ş â r â t ü ’ l - İ ’ c a z  [ Abdülmecid ], 177.
2.  M u h â k e m a t , 129-48; R a t i o n a l   A r g u m e n t s , 135-54. See also, L e t t e r s , 236-46; 257-

63.

3.  In fact, there are seven Topics.

181

182

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

The Second Matter

ّنِا 

ّ(cid:195)ا َ

Consider  this,  that  although  they  were  not  necessarily  wondrous,  all 
Muhammad’s ( Upon whom be peace ) conduct and actions pointed initially 
to his truthfulness and ﬁnally to his justice and fairness. Do you not see how 
he acted in situations similar to the incident of the cave when there was no 
hope of aid: he declared with complete certainty, conﬁdence, and earnest-
ْفَ(cid:115)َ(cid:98)  َ(cid:202) Thus, his conduct at the start [ of his mission ] – his 
ness: اَ(cid:179)َ(cid:151)َ(cid:174) َ
unconcern in the face of opponents, and his lack of fear and hesitation, and 
complete conﬁdence – indicates that he adhered to the truth. Then his estab-
lishing at the end – the rules essential for attaining happiness in this world 
and the next – and the rightness of his actions and his adhering to the truth 
are all evidence for his justice and fairness. This was true for each of his 
actions. But if you take a look at all he did and all his conduct there will 
appear before your eyes a proof of his prophethood as brilliant as lightning. 
So reﬂect on this!

The Third Matter

Understand that the past and the present – that is, the Era of Bliss [ the 
time of the Prophet ] – and the future are united in afﬁrming his prophet-
hood, just as his own self was evidence for it. We should now study the fol-
lowing four pages. Firstly we seek blessings by studying his self, ﬁrst of all 
by calling to mind four points:
ّ(cid:111)ﯬﯧَ

ّ(cid:99)(cid:170)اَ(cid:166)  ُلَ(cid:111)ﯬﯧْ(cid:170)ا  َسْ(cid:193)َ(cid:170)  Even if they are of the highest stand-
ard, artiﬁcial and man-made things can never be equal to what is natural and 
‘real’ or take their place. The slips and blunders of artiﬁciality will surely 
show up the imposture.

F i r s t l y :   ِلُ

S e c o n d l y :  The only thing that ﬁxes high morals in the ground of reality 
is seriousness, and the only thing that perpetuates them in their totality is 
truthfulness ( ṣ i d q  ). If truthfulness departs from their midst they become as 
straw winnowed by the wind.

T h i r d l y :  Just as attraction and [ mutual ] inclination are present in things 
that  are  harmonious  and  congruent;  so  contradictory  and  opposing  things 
give rise to repulsion and mutual disgust.

F o u r t h l y  is [ the rule ] “ there is in the whole what is not present in the 

parts, ” like a rope being strong though its strands are weak.

ٰ
VERSE 23-24 – EVIDENCES OF PROPHETHOOD

183

If you have grasped these points, understand now that as was acknowl-
edged by his enemies, Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) works, and the course and 
story of his life, all testify that he had the ﬁnest character and that combined 
in him were all the highest moral qualities. Such a combination is marked by 
personal dignity, gravity, and self-respect, and these do not permit a person 
to stoop to trivial inanities. Just as the angels do not permit devils to mix 
with them, so in no way when they come together do these elevated morals 
permit trickery and falsehood to enter amongst them. Have you not observed 
that  someone  famous  only  for  bravery  does  not  stoop  to  lying,  except  if 
forced? So how could a person in whom all [ those qualities are present ]? 
Thus, it is established that [ the Prophet’s ] own person ( UWBP ) furnished 
evidence for himself as clear as the sun.

Moreover,  if  you  study  his  conduct  ( Upon  whom  be  peace )  from  the 
age of four till forty, you will see that although this is the period of youth 
when the natural passions are rampant and hidden traits and any latent sly-
ness or trickery in a person’s character come to light, he lived these years in 
complete righteousness, constancy, and chastity, and in regular and orderly 
fashion. There was no hint of trickery in any of his conduct; not even the 
obdurate and clever [ enemies ] he was faced with [ observed any wiles in 
him ]. And then you see him when he is forty years old, when the charac-
ter  becomes  ﬁxed  and  habits  ingrained,  and  he  emerges  as  a  marvel  who 
brings  about  a  mighty  unprecedented  revolution  in  the  world.  This  could 
have occurred only through Allah’s [ will ].

The Fourth Matter

Know that the page of the past, which contains the stories of the prophets, 
recounted [ by the Prophet ] ( Upon whom be peace ) in the Qur’an, is a proof 
of his prophethood. This [ page comprises ] four points:

T h e   F i r s t :  If a person grasps the basic principles of a science and recog-
nizes its essential usefulness and employs its proﬁciently where he should, 
and constructs his cause on it, this is evidence of his skill and expertise in 
that science.

T h e   S e c o n d   P o i n t :   If  you  are  cognizant  of  human  nature  [ you  know 
that ] you will never see a person being so bold as to oppose [ the majority ] 
without hesitation or concern or constraint, or to lie even if insigniﬁcantly, 
among a people even if they are few, for a cause even if lowly, with dignity 
even if small. So how could someone – with the utmost dignity, for a cause 

184

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

of the utmost gravity, among people who were extremely numerous, in the 
face of extreme obstinacy despite his being unlettered – how could he speak 
of matters unattainable by reason alone and disclose them with the greatest 
seriousness and proclaim them over the heads of witnesses? Does this not 
point to his truthfulness, and that [ what he proclaimed ] was not from him 
but from Allah?

T h e   T h i r d :  There are many sciences that for the civilized are axiomatic 
and  teach  customs,  events,  situations,  and  actions,  but  that  are  unknown 
and theoretical to [ primitive ] nomads. So if someone wants to interrogate 
[ them ] and investigate their circumstances, especially in past centuries, he 
has to imagine himself among them in those deserts. 

T h e   F o u r t h :   This  is  that  if  a  person  debates  with  experts  in  a  science, 
even if it is only grammar, and propounds his views concerning the matters 
it entails, corroborating what is agreed upon and correcting points of dis-
pute, would this not demonstrate to you his superiority and that his knowl-
edge is Allah-given ( w a h b ī  )?

If  you  have  understood  these  points,  understand  now  that  despite  his 
being unlettered, Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom be peace ) recounts 
to us through the tongue of the Qur’an the stories of the prophets and early 
times as though he had been present and witnessed them. He describes their 
exploits and divulges their secrets to the whole world in the way of a mighty 
cause that has attracted the attention of intelligent men. He recounts these 
without concern. For he took their vital points and fundamental principles 
as the basis of his own cause, conﬁrming matters unanimously endorsed by 
the previous scriptures and correcting matters of difference. As though with 
a  ﬂeet  spirit  reﬂecting  divine  revelation  he  traversed  time  and  space  and 
entered the depths of the past, then proclaimed [ what was there ] as though 
he had witnessed it. Thus, his doing this is a proof of his prophethood and 
one of his miracles. All the evidences of the prophethoods of the previous 
prophets are in effect evidence for his prophethood, and all their miracles are 
in effect a miracle of his.

The Fifth Matter

This elucidates the page of the Age of Bliss, especially the question of the 

Arabian Peninsula. It also consists of four points:

T h e   F i r s t :   If  you  study  the  world  you  will  see  that  to  extirpate  cus-
toms  and  habits  is  difﬁcult  in  the  extreme  even  if  they  are  unimportant, 

VERSE 23-24 – EVIDENCES OF PROPHETHOOD

185

or characteristics even if they are insigniﬁcant, among people even if few, or 
a group even if wretched, for a king even if he is powerful with resolution 
even if great, over a long time and expending much effort. So how about 
a person who is not a ruler yet succeeded in a short time with little effort 
proportionately  to  what  was  achieved,  in  extirpating  customs  and  morals 
that were totally ingrained and had been practised since time immemorial, 
and in their place planting morals and habits in the hearts of a people who 
were exceedingly numerous and were utterly attached to and bigoted in their 
customs? Wouldn’t you look on him as a wonder and marvel?

T h e   S e c o n d   P o i n t :   A  state  or  government  is  a  corporate  body  ( s h a k h ṣ  
m a ‘ n a w ī  ); it takes form gradually like a growing child. And its conquest of 
former states, whose laws have become a very part of their people’s natures, 
takes  time.  So  wasn’t  it  extraordinary  that  Muhammad  ( Upon  whom  be 
peace )  founded  a  mighty  state  [ almost ]  instantaneously,  equipped  to 
progress to the highest degree, comprising eternal, lofty fundamental princi-
ples, and which conquered powerful states at once, and perpetuated its rule 
not only outwardly and physically but also inwardly and spiritually?

T h e   T h i r d   P o i n t :  It is possible to dominate outwardly and superﬁcially 
through compulsion and force, but to conquer minds and affect spirits by 
instilling  in  them  one’s  reﬁnement,  and  to  hold  sway  over  people’s  dis-
positions while perpetuating one’s domination of their consciences must 
surely  be  extraordinary;  it  can  only  be  the  outstanding  characteristic  of 
prophethood.

T h e   F o u r t h   P o i n t :  To direct and guide public opinion by means of the 
subterfuges of intimidation and enticement, and fear and threat, has only a 
partial, superﬁcial, and temporary effect and in time blocks up the path to 
rational thinking. So if a person penetrates to the very depths of people’s 
hearts with his guidance, excites their ﬁnest emotions, reveals their potenti-
alities, awakens their highest morals, discloses their hidden talents, makes 
the essence of their humanity well forth, and makes manifest their value as  
rational beings, all these acts of his can only be the very rays of reality, and 
indeed extraordinary. You see a person so hard-hearted he buries his daugh-
ter alive without compunction or sorrow, then when you see him again one 
day later, having become a Muslim, he [ refrains from stepping on ] an ant 
since he pities it and feels the creature’s pain. Can you ascribe such a revolu-
tion of the emotions to any law? Tell me, for Allah’s sake!

If you have understood these points, reﬂect on another. It is this:

186

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

The history of the world testiﬁes that unique geniuses are those men who 
are capable of developing the innate talents of all the people, and revealing 
their particular traits, and arousing their emotions, for if he does not arouse 
those dormant emotions, his efforts will all be in vain, or temporary, no mat-
ter how illustrious he is in himself.

History  also  shows  us  that  even  the  greatest  people  are  successful  at 
arousing only a few of those general emotions, like the feeling of patriotism, 
and the sense of brotherhood, and feelings of love, and the desire for free-
dom,  and  so  on.  Is  it  therefore  not  a  wonder  and  extraordinary  to  arouse 
thousands of such emotions, latent and elevated, and make them burst forth 
and unfold in a nomadic people scattered through the endless deserts of Ara-
bia? Indeed it is so! It is a light from the sun of reality. Anyone who has 
not got this point into his head, we shall thrust the Arabian Peninsula into 
his mind’s eye! And now it is after thirteen centuries and after mankind has 
climbed the rungs of civilization and progress. So, O obdurate one! Pick a 
hundred eminent philosophers and let them strive for a hundred years and 
see if they can do one hundredth of what Muhammad the Arabian ( UWBP ) 
did in his time. And if they cannot, and they will not be able to, you should 
beware of what happens to the obdurate! For his achievement was indeed 
extraordinary  and  was  only  one  of  his  [ many ]  miracles  ( Upon  whom  be 
blessings and peace ).

You  should  understand  too  that  a  person  who  wants  to  succeed  has  to 
[ act ] in accordance with the divine laws ( ‘ ā d ā t   A l l ā h  ), be knowledgeable 
of  the  natural  laws,  and  conform  to  social  relations,  otherwise  the  innate 
disposition of things ( a l - ﬁ ṭ r a  ) will respond to him by denying him success 
and will confound him. Also, a person who follows a [ particular ] way in 
society should not oppose the general current, otherwise it will work against 
him rather than for him. Consequently, if a person is aided by success within 
the general current, as was Muhammad ( Upon whom be peace ), it is proved 
that he adhered to the truth.

If you have understood this, consider the truths of the Shari‘a: you will 
see that despite all the momentous clashes and revolutions down the long 
centuries,  they  have  preserved  the  balance  of  the  natural  laws  and  social 
relations,  which  because  of  their  minuteness  are  not  apparent  to  people’s 
minds ( a l - ‘ u q ū l  ) although they are completely in conformity and harmony 
with them. The more time passes, the more their interconnection becomes 
clear. It is plain from this that Islam is the natural religion for humankind 

VERSE 23-24 – EVIDENCES OF PROPHETHOOD

187

and that it is truth ( ḥ a q q  ). For this reason, it can never cease or diminish. 
Don’t you see that the healing antidote for the fatal poison in society is the 
proscription of interest and usury ( r i b ā  ) and the obligatory payment of the 
puriﬁcation tax ( z a k ā t  )? And these are only two of the thousands of matters 
of the Shari‘a.

Now,  if  you  have  grasped  the  above  four  points  and  three  points  that 
follow them, know too that although Muhammad al-Hashimi ( UWBP ) was 
unlettered and could neither read nor write, and had no outward power and 
no sovereignty, and neither did his forefathers, and although he had no desire 
for domination and rule, with all his heart and conﬁdence and assurance in 
a position of the gravest danger and importance, he undertook a matter of 
supreme  gravity  and  conquered  minds  and  became  the  beloved  of  spirits, 
and  dominated  dispositions,  and  uprooted  from  the  depths  of  their  hearts 
their many habitual entrenched familiar savage practices and customs. He 
then planted in their place with the utmost ﬁrmness, as though fusing with 
their very ﬂesh and blood, elevated morals and ﬁne customs. He replaced the 
hard-heartedness of a people degenerated in the far-ﬂung corners of barbar-
ity, with ﬁne sensitivities and he disclosed the jewel of their humanity. He 
took them out of their barbarity and raised them to the peak of civilization 
and made them teachers of the world of their time. For them he founded a 
state that swallowed up [ other ] states like Moses’ staff. It appeared like a 
brilliant ﬂaming light that burnt up the [ social ] ties of tyranny and corrup-
tion, and in a short time established the seat of that state [ which extended 
over ] East and West. Doesn’t this situation prove that his way was truth and 
reality, and that he was truthful in what he was claiming?

The Sixth Matter

This is about the page of the future, and especially the question of the 

Shari‘a. Four points have to be considered in this matter:

T h e   F i r s t :  Even if he is exceptional, one person can become expert and 

proﬁcient in only four or ﬁve sciences.

T h e   S e c o n d   P o i n t :  The same speech differs according to who says it, so 
just as it may point to the superﬁciality and ignorance of one person, it may 
indicate  the  skill  and  proﬁciency  of  another  –  although  the  words  are  the 
same. For one of them looks to the source and conclusion of what he says, 
and its context and what precedes it; he thinks of it in relation to its brothers 
[ the other things said ] and places it appropriately. He employs it most aptly 
and seeks out fertile ground in which to sow it. It is clear from this that he is 

188

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

a singular [ speaker ] and has mastered the subject about which he is speak-
ing. All the concluding phrases of Qur’anic verses related to the sciences 
and what they have gleaned, are of the above sort.

T h e   T h i r d   P o i n t :  Due to the perfecting of ways and means, many things 
that  are  now  commonplace  and  even  toys  for  children,  two  centuries  ago 
were  considered  marvels.  So  whatever  preserves  its  youth,  freshness,  and 
novelty over these long centuries must surely be extraordinary and unique.

T h e   F o u r t h   P o i n t :  Guidance is beneﬁcial only when commensurate with 
the intellectual capacity of the majority of the people. And the great majority 
are common people, and the common people are not capable of contemplat-
ing the sheer truth; they are accustoming to seeing it clothed only in the dress 
of their familiar imaginings. Because of this, the Qur’an depicts such truths 
in allegorical form ( m u t a s h ā b i h ā t  ), with metaphors ( i s t i ‘ ā r a  ) and similes 
( t a s h b ī h  ), and it protects the mass of people, who have not advanced, from 
falling into the abyss of error. Thus, it is vague and obscure in matters that 
they necessarily believe to be contrary to actuality [ since they conceive of 
them ] as they appear to their external senses ( b i ’ l - ḥ i s s   a l - ẓ ā h i r ī  ), yet it still 
makes allusion to and indicates the truth.

If you have grasped these points, now consider this: The Islamic religion 
and Shari‘a are founded on rational proof, and are the sum and substance of 
the branches of knowledge that comprise the vital essence of all the basic 
sciences: the science of reﬁning the spirit, and of training the heart, and of 
educating the conscience, and the science of physical training, and domestic 
science, and the science of local government, and that of international rela-
tions, and the legal sciences, and the science of human relations, and that 
of social behaviour, and so on and so forth. Moreover, the Shari‘a explains 
and elucidates where is necessary or needed, and is concise where this is not 
necessary or [ people’s ] minds are not ready or the times do not allow, and 
lays down principles that can be elaborated, deduced, and expanded through 
consultation and the exercise of reason. 

At the present time, all these sciences or even a third of them after one 
thousand three hundred years – having grown through the meeting of minds 
and the expansion of their results – could not be found in a single person 
even  in  civilized  places  and  among  clever  people,  so  whoever  decks  out 
his conscience with fairness will conﬁrm that the Shari‘a is always beyond 
human power, and was particularly so at that time. And he will endorse the 
statement Í Ì Ë Ê

Virtue is [ true virtue when it ] is acknowledged even by enemies. For the 
American philosopher Carlyle 1 quoted the famous German literary ﬁgure, 
Goethe, who asked after close study of the truths of the Qur’an: “ Could the 
civilized world be further advanced within the bounds of Islam? ” And he 
told himself: “ Yes, indeed! For in one respect scholars now beneﬁt from it. ” 
Carlyle said too that Islam appeared like a ﬂaming light and devoured the 
religions of the time. And it had the right to do so, for it contained nothing 
of the “ vain janglings ” of some of the Christian sects or the “ rumours ... 
and idle wiredrawings ” of the Jews. He conﬁrmed the meaning of the verse: 

( 2:23-4 ) Ï Î Í Ì Ë Ê É ... ¿ ¾ ½ ¼
•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  The Qur’an, and likewise its expounder – I mean 
Hadiths – have only taken summaries from all the sciences, but isn’t it pos-
sible for a single individual to comprehend numerous summaries?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Through their apt positioning and ﬁtting use in fertile 
ground, in matters that are only hinted at – as we indicated in the second 
point above – such summaries reveal like glass a full cognizance of the sci-
ence [ in question ] and complete proﬁciency in it. So the summary becomes 
like the science and it would not be possible for such a person [ as you men-
tion to comprehend it ].

Now understand that the conclusion of the above arguments is that ﬁrstly 
you should bear in mind the following rules: one person cannot be a special-
ist in a plethora of sciences; the same speech or words differ [ when uttered 
by ] two [ different ] people; [ when uttered by ] one they will be gold, and 
[ when spoken by ] the other they will be coal; the sciences result from  the 
meeting of minds and are perfected with the passage of time; many matters 
that were theoretical in the past are now commonplace; to compare the past 
and present is a false comparison [ the difference between them is too great ]; 
due  to  their  simplicity  and  candour,  desert-dwellers  cannot  hide  trickery 

1.  The famous historian and philosopher Thomas Carlyle ( 1795-1881 ) was actually 
Scottish. He was born in Scotland and died in London. The two passages cited here are tak-
en from his work O n   H e r o e s ,   H e r o - Wo r s h i p   a n d   t h e   H e r o i c   i n   H i s t o r y  ( London: 1841 ), 
the chapter entitled: The Hero as Prophet. Mahomet: Islam. It is not known what Nursi’s 
source was, for the ﬁrst is rather a loose translation ( See, pp. 74-5 ). Carlyle was actually 
praising the moral discipline and direction that Islam, and its Prophet, gives its adherents 
while at the same time not denying the pleasant things of life. It is not clear which remarks 
are his and which are Goethe’s. The second ( pp. 64-5 ), is closer to the original, though 
there it is Islam that swallowed up the existing religions, not the Qur’an.

and  deception,  as  they  may  be  concealed  beneath  the  veil  of  civilization; 
many  of  the  sciences  result  only  from  instilling  customs  in  human  nature 
and teaching it events and circumstances, when the time and environment 
are favourable; the light of man’s vision cannot penetrate the future and he 
cannot perceive its particular circumstances; just as human life has a natural 
span which will come to an end, so too laws have a natural lifespan which 
comes to an end, of course; in terms of both time and place, the environment 
is vastly inﬂuential on people’s circumstances; very many wonders of the 
past  have  become  commonplace  through  the  perfecting  of  means;  human 
intelligence,  even  if  exceptional,  is  not  capable  of  creating  a  science  and 
perfecting it all at once; the science is rather like a child; [ its development ] 
is gradual. 

Now  that  you  have  settled  these  matters  in  your  head  and  can  picture 
them, free yourself from the fancies of the present and the delusions of its 
environment, and plunge into the sea of time from the shore of this century. 
Then pass under the sea till you emerge at the Age of Bliss and behold the 
Arabian Peninsula. Raise your head and dress yourself with the ideas that 
that time sews for you, and take a look at the boundless desert. What appears 
to you ﬁrst is a single person who although without helper or power is chal-
lenging the whole world on his own. He is disputing everyone. He is bearing 
on his shoulders a truth more glorious than the globe. He is holding in his 
hand a Shari‘a that guarantees the happiness of all men. This Shari‘a of his 
is as though the sum and substance of all the divine sciences and the sciences 
of reality. It is living like a skin rather than like clothes, and expands as the 
human potentialities unfold, producing the fruits of happiness in this world 
and the next. It orders the affairs of humankind as if all men were the mem-
bers of a single gathering. If its laws were to be asked from where they had 
come and where they were headed, they would reply through the tongue of 
their miraculousness: “ We come from pre-eternal [ divine ] speech and we 
shall accompany human thought through all eternity. When the world ends 
we shall apparently part from men in respect of the religious obligations, but 
we shall always accompany them through the mystery of our meanings and 
shall nourish their spirits and assist and guide them. ” 

So now, doesn’t what you have witnessed up to here recite to you the 

verse with its taunting command:

VERSE 23-24 – EVIDENCES OF PROPHETHOOD

Now  consider  this:  The  verse ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´ ³  indicates  that 
because some people are heedless of what the Lawgiver ( a l - S h ā r i ‘  ) intends 
in guiding the mass of people and are ignorant of the necessity of offering 
guidance commensurate with their mental capacity, they fall into doubt, the 
source of which is three matters:

T h e   F i r s t :  They say: “ The existence of allegorical verses and obscurities 
in the Qur’an is contrary to it miraculousness, which is based on eloquence 
( a l - b a l ā g h a  ), and eloquence is based on clarity of expression.

T h e   S e c o n d :  They say: “ The Qur’an is vague and general concerning the 
truths of creation and the physical sciences ( f u n ū n   a l - k ā ’ i n ā t  ), but this is 
contrary to its way and method ( maslak ), which is to teach and guide.

T h e   T h i r d :  They say: “ Some of the Qur’an’s literal meanings tend to be 
contrary to rational proof so may be opposed to reality, and this is contrary 
to its veraciousness.

T h e   A n s w e r :  Success is from Allah alone. O you doubters, listen to this! 
What you suppose to be causes of defect, in reality are truthful witnesses to 
the mystery of the Qur’an’s miraculousness.

A n s w e r   t o   t h e   ﬁ r s t   d o u b t ,  which is the existence of allegories and obscu-

rities:

The Qur’an’s guidance is for all people, and most of them are common 
people.  In  [ matters ]  of  guidance,  the  minority  follows  the  majority,  for 
when  the  common  people  are  addressed,  the  educated  classes  can  beneﬁt 
from it and receive their share. But if the reverse is true, the common people 
are deprived [ of their share ]. The mass of people cannot free their minds 
from what they are accustomed to and imaginary things, and are therefore 
unable to apprehend sheer truths and abstract ideas except through the tel-
escope of their imaginations and by depicting things familiar to them. How-
ever, [ when doing this ] they should not ﬁx their attention on the apparent 
forms [ of those things ] lest it necessitates something impossible like their 
embodiment or having ‘sides;’ they should look beyond [ the form ] to the 
truths [ behind them ]. 

For example, the masses can conceive of the reality of divine disposal 
over the universe in the form of a king seated on the throne of his power hold-
ing sway over his dominions. It is for this reason that [ the Qur’an ] chooses 
[ to use ] a metonymy in the verse:  ( 20:5 ) \ [ Z Y Since the 

192

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

feelings  of  the  mass  of  people  are  thus,  it  is  imperative  according  to  elo-
quence and guidance that their understanding is taken into account, and their 
feelings are respected, and their intellects are deferred to, and allowance is 
made for their ideas. Like someone who speaks with a child has to come 
down to his level so that he can get the child to understand in a friendly man-
ner. The literary devices and styles of the Qur’an ( a l - a s ā l ī b   a l - Q u r ’ ā n i y y a  ) 
in  such  places,  that  show  regard  for  the  mass  of  people  are  called 
“ divine  condescension  to  human  minds  ِرَ(cid:131)َ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا  ِلوُ(cid:163)ُ(cid:150) ىٰ(cid:170)ِا ُةـَ
ّ(cid:99)(cid:170)َا   ” 
It  is  to  put  [ people’s ]  minds  at  ease.  For  this  reason  it  sets  the  forms 
[ depicted  by ]  the  allegorical  verses  before  the  people’s  eyes  like  tele-
scopes. Haven’t you seen how most of the eloquent literati use metaphors 
( a l - i s t i ‘ ā r ā t  ) to depict subtle meanings or to portray disparate ideas. Thus, 
the allegorical verses are metaphors of an abstruse ( g h ā m i ḍ  ) kind for they 
depict abstruse truths.

ّزَ(cid:179)َ

ّ(cid:193)ِ(cid:183)ٰ(cid:170)ِ

As for there being obscure ( m u s h k i l  ) expressions, this is due either to 
the subtlety and profundity of what they signify, and the conciseness and 
loftiness of the style, and the obscurities of the Qur’an are of this sort; or 
to the ambiguity of the words and tangled expressions, which is contrary to 
eloquence and the Qur’an is exempt from this. So now, you sceptic! Isn’t it 
pure eloquence to so easily bring close to the common people’s understand-
ing these profound truths which are so distant from everyone? For eloquence 
is to speak conformably to any given situation. Dwell on this!

T h e   A n s w e r   t o   t h e   S e c o n d   D o u b t ,  which is the Qur’an’s vagueness con-

cerning the shaping of creation, although the modern sciences are explicit.

Understand that included in the tree of the world is the desire to be per-
fected ( m a y l   a l - i s t i k m ā l  ), out of which branches the inclination to progress 
found in man. The inclination to progress resembles a seed that sprouts and 
grows  as  a  result  of  numerous  experiences,  and  takes  form  and  expands 
through  the  meeting  of  minds  [ and  exchange  of  ideas ]  and  produces  the 
fruits of successive sciences, whereby the following can arise only after the 
previous one has come into being, and the previous one can only be pre-
liminary to the subsequent one after it has been universally accepted. Con-
sequently, if ten centuries ago a person wanted to teach science – remember-
ing that sciences are born only as the result of numerous experiments – and 
call people to it, all he would have done would have been to confuse their 
minds and caused them to fall into error. For instance, if the Qur’an had said: 

VERSE 23-24 – EVIDENCES OF PROPHETHOOD

193

“ O people! Behold the stationary sun 1 and rotating earth and the swarming 
millions  of  living  beings  in  creation,  then  conceive  of  the  Maker’s  gran-
deur! ”, it would have driven the people either to denial, or to deceive them-
selves  or  to  compete  with  it.  For  because  of  their  superﬁcial  view,  rather 
their false view, they look on the earth as self-evidently ﬂat and the sun as 
rotating. So indeed, to confuse people’s minds, especially over the period of 
a thousand years just to satisfy a few people of our times would have been 
contrary to wise guidance and opposed to the spirit of eloquence. 

Friend! Don’t assume that you can draw an analogy between theoretical 
future matters and the conditions of the hereafter. [ That is, don’t suppose that 
the matters of the hereafter and its conditions, which are unknown to us, are 
similar to theoretical matters that will be discovered in the future. ] For since 
the external senses cannot perceive any aspect of [ the matters of the hereaf-
ter ], they remain within the bounds of the possible and may be believed in 
conﬁdently. What they clearly require is to be elucidated. However, when 
it comes to our subject [ the discoveries of science ], since in the view [ of 
the people of those times ] they were outside the bounds of possibility and 
probability, and due to their erroneous perceptions [ what they thought to be 
true ] was self-evident, what was required in the view of eloquence was for 
those  discoveries  [ to  be  mentioned ]  in  vague  and  general  [ terms ]  out  of 
respect for the people’s feelings and so as not to confuse their minds. Nev-
ertheless, the Qur’an indicates, hints at, and makes allusion to the truth, and 
opens the door to minds and bids them enter by planting signs and associ-
ated meanings ( q a r ā ’ i n  ). Friend! If you are fair-minded, reﬂect on the rule

of science ], which were [ later ] born of the meeting of minds and conjunc-
tion of ideas, and concede that the Qur’an’s choosing to be vague and gen-
eral is pure eloquence and evidence of its miraculousness.

T h e   A n s w e r   t o   t h e   T h i r d   D o u b t ,  which is some of the literal meanings 
of  verses  tending  to  be  contrary  to  rational  evidences  and  the  ﬁndings  of 
science. 

Consider this: The Qur’an’s main aim is to instruct the mass of people 
( a l - j u m h ū r  ) about its four basic principles, which are proof of the Single 
Maker, prophethood, the resurrection of the dead, and justice. Thus, its men-
tion of the universe is secondary and digressive, for purposes of deduction 
( a l - i s t i d l ā l  ),  for  it  was  not  revealed  to  teach  geography  or  cosmography 
( astronomy ). It mentions the universe in order to conclude from the divine 
art in it and its unique order [ the existence of ] the True Orderer ( May His 
glory be exalted ). It is a fact that traces of art, purpose, and order are to be 
seen in all things, but however they were formed does not concern us since 
it is unconnected with the main aim. For seeing that the Qur’an speaks of 
beings for purposes of deduction, and seeing that their existence has to be 
known before the proposition, and seeing that the evidence has to be clear, 
how could guidance and eloquence not make it imperative that [ the Qur’an ] 
should  incline  with  some  of  its  apparent  or  literal  meanings  ( ẓ a w ā h i r  
a l - n u ṣ ū ṣ  )  towards  their  emotional  views  and  literary  knowledge,  making 
concessions to them? Such literal meanings are not for afﬁrming or indicat-
ing their knowledge, but are allusive ( m i n   q a b ī l   a l - k i n ā y ā t  ) or associative 
expressions ( m u s t a t b a ‘ ā t   a l - t a r ā k ī b  ). In any event, [ the Qur’an ] includes 
signs and indications for investigators of the truth ( a h l   a l - t a ḥ q ī q  ) that point 
to the truth.

For  example,  suppose  when  presenting  its  argument  ( f ī   m a q ā m  
a l - i s t i d l ā l  )  the  Qur’an  had  said:  “ O  people!  Ponder  over  the  sun’s  being 
stationary  although  it  apparently  moves,  and  the  earth’s  daily  and  annual 
rotations  although  it  is  apparently  stationary.  Reﬂect  on  the  extraordinary 
gravity holding the stars [ in place ]. Behold the marvels of electricity, and 
the inﬁnite combinations of the seventy elements, and the massing together 
of uncountable organisms in a droplet of water, and know that Allah is pow-
erful  over  all  things! ”  Had  it  spoken  thus,  the  evidence  would  have  been 
more  obscure  and  far  less  clear  than  what  was  being  claimed,  and  that  is 
opposed to the rules of deduction. 

Moreover, since [ the literal meanings of verses that apparently tend to 
contradict science ] are allusive, their meanings are not either true or false 
[ that is, their meanings should not be taken literally ]. Don’t you see that the 

VERSE 23-24 – EVIDENCES OF PROPHETHOOD

195

( ا ) in the word  َلاَ(cid:162) denotes lightness, so it makes no difference whether its 
root was ( ى ) or ( و )  , ( ق )  or ( ك )  ?

I n   S h o r t :   Since  the  Qur’an  was  revealed  for  all  people  of  all  times, 
these three points [ which are thought to raise doubts ] are evidence of its 
miraculousness.  I  swear  [ by  Allah ]  Who  taught  the  miraculous  Qur’an, 
that  the  view  of  the  Bringer  of  Good  News  and  Warner  and  his  critical 
insight were too ﬁne, brilliant and penetrating to confuse truth and illusion, 
and his way of truth was too elevated, pure and exalted to deceive people 
or mislead them.

The Seventh Matter

The  books  of  [ the  Prophet’s ]  biography  and  works  of  history  have 
described numerous of his perceptible miracles ( m u ‘ j i z ā t   m a ḥ s ū s a  ), and the 
famous wonders he performed in the presence of the people, and these have 
been  commented  on  by  authoritative  scholars.  To  teach  what  is  already 
known would be superﬂuous, so we refer detailed discussion to their books 
and here we shall summarize [ the miracles ] by mentioning [ only ] their 
categories.

This  strange  shape  did  not  appear  by 
chance  in  the  middle  of  this  discussion 
of  strange  things,  for  just  as  I  was  writ-
ing out a [fair] copy in Diyarbekir in Cev-
det  Bey’s  house  on  19th  Şubat  [3  March 
1916] on the night [before] Friday, Bitlis 
fell  and  the  author  (B e d i u z z a m a n )  was 
taken captive. The strange shape [of spilt 
ink] on this page on that night was a sign 
– but Allah knows best – of the spilt blood 
of  those  of  Bediuzzaman’s  students  who 
were with him and their being taken pris-
oner that night in Bitlis. 

(   A b d ü l m e c i d   )
Moreover,  [ this  spilt  ink ]  took  the 
shape  of  a  serpent  whose  tail  encircled 
the author and whose head had been seve-
red. This [ signified ] the Russians. It also 
depicts  the  water  conduit  into  which  the 
author  fell  wounded,  where  he  remai-
ned for thirty hours awaiting death every 
moment. (   H a m z a   )

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

Concerning  [ the  Prophet’s ]  manifest  wonders:  although  each  of  them 
has been transmitted from only one source ( ā ḥ ā d ī y a n  ) and there is no con-
sensus concerning them ( g h a i r   m u t a w ā t i r  ), as a type and there being many 
in these categories they may be considered as being unanimously reported 
in respect of their meanings ( m u t a w ā t i r   b i ’ l - m a ‘ n ā  ). They consist of three 
categories:

T h e   F i r s t :   [ The  various  paranormal  events  that  took  place  before  the 
prophetic mission but which were related to it, called ] “ i r h ā ṣ ā t . ” [ These 
included ] the Zoroastrians’ ﬁre being extinguished, the drying up of Lake 
Sava, the breaking into two of Chrosroes’ portico, and the prognostications 
of hidden voices. A person might even fancy that the century in which the 
Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  was  born  was  a  highly 
sensitive wonderworker that had premonitions of his coming.

T h e   S e c o n d   C a t e g o r y :  The many predictions of the future, including the 
conquest of the treasuries of the Persian and Byzantine rulers, the defeat of 
the Byzantines, the conquest of Mecca, and so on. As if [ the Messenger’s ] 
ethereal, winged spirit rent the bonds of ﬁxed time and space, roamed in the 
climes of the future, then told us what it had witnessed.

T h e   T h i r d   C a t e g o r y :   Wonders  that  could  be  perceived  by  the  physical 
senses and were performed during [ the period of ] his challenging [ the exist-
ing order ] and calling [ to Islam ]. [ These included ] stones speaking, trees 
moving,  the  splitting  of  the  moon,  and  water  ﬂowing  [ from  his  ﬁngers ]. 
Al-Zamakhsharī  stated  that  there  were  as  many  as  a  thousand  [ miracles ] 
of  this  category.  Some  of  these  have  been  reported  unanimously  but  not 
literally ( m u t a w ā t i r   b i ’ l - m a ‘ n ā  ). In fact, even those who denied the Qur’an 
could not tamper with the verse  ( 54:1 ) ﮯ ~

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Something like the splitting of the moon should have 

become world famous and known by everyone?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  [ Factors like ] differences in the time of its rising, and 
the existence of cloud, and there being little observation of the skies at that 
time, and its occurrence at an hour [ people are ] inattentive, during the night, 
and its occurring instantaneously, all meant that it was not seen by everyone 
or most people. Nevertheless, it has been established in narrations that it was 
witnessed by many caravans for which the moon’s position was similar to 
that [ of Mecca ].

However, the chief of these miracles is the Perspicuous Qur’an whose 

proven miraculousness in seven aspects is indicated by this verse. ( 2:23 )

VERSE 23-24 – EVIDENCES OF PROPHETHOOD

197

Friend!  If  you  have  understood  these  matters  listen  now  to  what  you 
will be told about the three aspects of the verses’ positioning and ordering 
( n a ẓ m  ): the verse’s positioning in relation to what preceded it; the position-
ing [ and relationships ] of some of its phrases; the positioning [ and relation-
ships ] of the parts of the phrases.

Concerning the ﬁrst: there are two aspects to the relationship of 
this verse and the preceding ones

T h e  F i r s t :  According to Ibn ‘Abbas’ commentary, when in order to prove 
divine unity [ the Qur’an ] says: m l it also proves the prophethood 
of Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), who was the clear-
est proof of divine unity. Now, prophethood is proven by miracles. And the 
greatest of miracles is the Qur’an. And the most subtle facet of the Qur’an’s 
miraculousness lies in the eloquence of its composition ( n a ẓ m  ). 

Muslims agree that the Qur’an is miraculous and inimitable. The authori-
tative  scholars  however  differ  as  to  the  ways  in  which  this  is  so.  Never-
theless,  these  ways  do  not  conﬂict,  for  some  prefer  one  aspect  [ and  oth-
ers another aspect ]. Some say that its inimitability lies in its relating facts 
about  the  unseen  realms  ( i k h b ā r u h u   b i ’ l - g h u y ū b  );  according  to  others,  it 
is its bringing together [ all ] truths and sciences; others assert it is its free-
dom from contradictions and inconsistencies; according to others, it is the 
originality of its styles and the singularity of the beginnings and ends of its 
verses and suras; others say it was its appearance from someone illiterate 
who could neither read nor write; according to others it was its composi-
tion being so extraordinarily eloquent as to be beyond human power; and so 
on and so forth. Detailed knowledge of this [ latter ] sort of miraculousness 
may  be  obtained  by  studying  Qur’anic  commentaries  such  as  the  present 
work, or it may be learnt summarily in [ the following ] three ways, as it was 
ascertained by ‘Abd al-Qāhir al-Jurjānī, the Master of Eloquence ( a l - S h a y k h  
a l - B a l ā g h a  ), and al-Zamakhsharī, and al-Sakkākī, and al-Jāḥiẓ:

T h e   F i r s t   W a y :  The Arab people were illiterate nomads [ who lived ] in 
an unusual environment that suited them. They were awaked by the mighty 
revolutions [ occurring ] in the world. Their [ only ] books ( d ī w ā n u h u m  ) [ of 
their proud exploits consisted of ] poetry and their [ only ] science was rheto-
ric ( a l - b a l ā g h a  ), and [ the source ] of their pride and vainglory was eloquent 
speech ( a l - f a ṣ ā ḥ a  ) in such fairs as ‘Ukāẓ. They were the cleverest of peoples 
and therefore the most needy for mental exercise and activity, and mentally 
they were experiencing a period of burgeoning youth. Then the Holy Qur’an 

198

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

rose upon them with its majesterial eloquence and outshone their eloquence, 
represented by the Seven Hanging Odes ( a l - m u ‘ a l l a q ā t   a l - s a b ‘ a  ), inscribed 
in gold [ hanging ] on the walls of the Ka‘ba. Despite their being eloquent 
orators  –  the  commanders  of  rhetoric  and  eloquence  and  rulers  of  correct 
Arabic – they could not dispute the Qur’an nor utter a single word in argu-
ment, despite the severe taunts of the Messenger ( UWBP ) and his rebuking 
and chiding them, and discrediting their intelligence, and provoking them 
over a long period, and his humiliating them although some of their orators’ 
heads touched the skies in their pride and others reached the stars. So if they 
had not wanted to dispute [ the Qur’an ] and put it to the test and if they had 
not  been  aware  of  their  impotence,  they  surely  would  not  have  remained 
silent. Their total inability [ to dispute the Qur’an ] was therefore proof of its 
miraculousness and inimitability. 

T h e   S e c o n d   W a y :   Punctillious  scholars  and  critics  with  knowledge  of 
all the parts of speech and their properties and ﬁne points, have studied the 
Qur’an sura by sura, passage by passage, verse by verse, and word by word, 
and  they  have  testiﬁed  that  it  brings  together  truths,  qualities,  and  subtle-
ties  not  found  all  together  in  human  speech.  There  are  thousands  of  such 
[ scholars ]. Evidence for the veracity of their testimony are the momentous 
changes that the Qur’an wrought in the world of humanity, and the wide-
spread religion it founded, and its perpetuating down the ages what it con-
tains of the sciences, and its growing younger as time grows older, and its 
becoming sweeter the more it is repeated. Hence  ( 53:4 ) 4 3 2 1 0

T h e   T h i r d   W a y :  As is pointed out by al-Jāḥiẓ, despite the intense need 
of the masters of oratory and rhetoric to invalidate and frustrate the Mes-
senger’s ( Upon whom be peace ) cause, and in spite of their hatred of him 
and obduracy, they gave up disputing him verbally, which was the safest, 
easiest,  and  most  direct  way,  and  they  took  up  arms  against  him,  despite 
this  being  the  most  difﬁcult  and  lengthy  way,  beset  with  dangers  and  of 
uncertain  end.  Moreover,  their  political  acumen  was  such  that  the  differ-
ences between these two ways could not have escaped them. So the person 
who avoided the ﬁrst way although it was possible [ to attempt it ] and would 
have been more effective at thwarting the [ Messenger’s ] cause, and took 
the way that threw his property and life into peril, must have been either stu-
pid – and this could not be ascribed to those who ruled the world after they 
were rightly-guided – or he felt powerless to take the former way and was 
compelled to take the latter.

VERSE 23-24 – EVIDENCES OF PROPHETHOOD

199

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  It was possible to dispute [ the Qur’an ], but perhaps 

for some reason or other it was not attempted?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e  

t o l d :   If  it  had  been  possible  some  people  would  have 
striven  to  do  so  since  the  provocations  were  [ severe ]  and  the  need  was 
intense. And if they had disputed it, it would have been known, for it was 
much sought after and there were many reasons for its being known. And 
if it had become known, there would have been many who supported [ such 
an attempt to dispute it ], and to defend it, and they would have said that it 
had been disputed, particularly at that time. And had there been opposers 
and defenders, even if only out of bigotry, it would have become famous, 
for it was a matter of great import. And if it had been famous, it would 
have been reported in the chronicles, just as they reported the ravings of 
Musaylima  [ the  Liar ]  when  he  said  [ in  imitation  of  the  Qur’an ]:  “ An 
elephant, what is an elephant? How can you recognize an elephant? It has 
a short tail and long trunk. ”

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Musaylima was an eloquent orator, so how is it that 

his words have been so mocked and scorned by people?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :   Because  he  was  [ his  words  were ]  compared  with 
something far higher than himself. Haven’t you noticed that if someone is 
compared  with  Yūsuf  ( Joseph )  ( Upon  whom  be  peace ),  he  appears  ugly 
even though he may be good looking? It is therefore not possible to dispute 
the Qur’an, so it must be miraculous.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  The sceptics have voiced many objections and doubts 

on grammatical grounds about the Qur’an’s phrases and words, such as, 
 Á À ( 20:63 ) ® ( 5:69 ) and % $ # ( 2:17 ) ?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :   You  should  consult  the  conclusion  of  al-Sakkākī’s 
M i f t ā ḥ ,  for  he  effectively  silences  [ such  objectors ]  saying:  “ Don’t  they 
understand that a person whose eloquently correct speech is unanimously 
acknowledged  would  know  whether  or  not  what  he  had  repeatedly  stated 
over a long period of time contained the errors noticed by unthinking people 
like them? ”
The second aspect of the verse’s positioning [ and relationship with 
the previous verses ]

When  the  previous  verse  commands  worship,  the  listener  asks  in  his 
mind:  “ How  should  we  worship? ”  And  it  as  though  answers:  “ As  the 
Qur’an teaches you! ” So then the person asks: “ How can we know that it’s 
the word of Allah the Most High? ” And it replies saying: 

200

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

( 2:23 ) ... » º ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´ ³

The positioning of the verse’s phrases

The  sentence    » º ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´ ³  has  fallen  into  place 
most  aptly,  for  when  the  Qur’an  commands  worship,  it  is  as  though  it  is 
asked: “ How can we know that it’s Allah’s command, that we have to com-
ply  with  it? ”  And  it  replies:  “ If  you  doubt  it,  try  [ to  produce  something 
similar ] yourself; then you’ll be certain that it’s Allah’s command. ”

Another  aspect  of  the  verse’s  positioning  is  this:  the  Qur’an,  having 
praised itself with the sentence ( 2:2 ) + *  (  & % $ # and 
followed this with praise of the believers, and having gone on from this to 
censure the disbelievers and dissemblers and then proceeded to command 
worship and the afﬁrmation of divine unity, it now returns to the beginning 
and directs attention to (  & %  That is, no doubts can be levelled at the 
Qur’an; if you have doubts, they arise from your diseased hearts and sickly 
characters.

ٍمَ(cid:163)َ(cid:126)  ْنِ(cid:174)  ِءا(cid:175)(cid:170)ْا ُمْ(cid:151)َ(cid:142) ُرَ(cid:159)ْ(cid:179)ُ(cid:192)َو         ٍدَ(cid:174)َر  ْنِ(cid:174) 

ِس ْ(cid:175) َ

ّ(cid:131)(cid:170)ا ُءْوَ(cid:138) ُرَ(cid:167)ْ(cid:179)ُ(cid:192) ْدَ(cid:162) 

The  positioning  of  the  phrase: ¿ ¾ ½ ¼  This  is  the  apodo-
sis [ of the protasis ( condition ) ¶ μ ´ ³  ], and the apodosis has 
to  be  the  consequence  of  the  conditional  verb.  And  since  the  command  
½ ¼  is  provocative  ( t a ‘ j ī z ī  ),  it  necessitates  the  implied  command 
“ make  the  attempt  to! اوُ(cid:103)َ
ّ(cid:93)َ(cid:131)َ(cid:98)   ”  And  since  the  command  expresses  some-
thing  new  ( i n s h ā ’  ),  and  this  cannot  be  a  consequence,  the  consequence 
of the command has to be something other than the apodosis. And this is 
the necessity that is one of the basic meanings of the command. Now, the 
necessity of attempting also does not appear to be the consequence of their 
doubting,  so  this  requires  implied  sentences  concealed  beneath  the  verse. 
The  implied  sentences  are  these:  “ If  you  doubt  that  this  is  Allah’s  word, 
you should study its miraculous nature, for something miraculous cannot be 
human and Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) is human. If 
you want its miraculousness to be evident, try yourself [ to produce some-
thing similar ] and that you’re incapable will become clear. That means you 
are obliged to attempt to produce a sura similar to it. ” 

VERSE 23-24 – EVIDENCES OF PROPHETHOOD

201

How excellent is Allah’s Revelation! How concise! How miraculous!
Now  for  the  positioning  of  Ä Ã Â Á À  it  has  three 

aspects:

T h e   F i r s t :  They say: “ Just because we are incapable [ of producing its 
like ]  it  does  not  prove  that  all  mankind  is  incapable. ”  So  it  dumbfounds 
them with the words: Ä Ã Â Á À  that is, your elders and 
leaders.
T h e   S e c o n d :  They declare: “ If we dispute [ the Qur’an ], who would sup-
port us and defend us? ” So it silences them saying: “ Whatever the outlook, 
it  has  its  adherents.  Were  you  to  dispute  it,  supporters  would  emerge  to 
defend you. ”

T h e   T h i r d :  It is as though the Qur’an is saying: “ The Messenger ( Upon 
whom be peace ) calls on Allah the Most High as witness, and Allah testiﬁes 
to his truthfulness by placing the stamp of miraculousness on his cause. So 
if your gods and witnesses are any use to you at all, call on them! ” In this 
way, [ the Qur’an ] pours scorn on them.

The positioning and relationship of Ë Ê É is clear. For it implies 
the  following  phrases:  “ So  attempt  it,  but  look!  [ You  can’t! ]  And  if  you 
can’t, it’s clear you’re incapable of doing it! ”

The positioning of Í Ì : It is as if when it says Í Ì one of 
them says in reply: “ Just because we haven’t been able to do it, it doesn’t 
mean mankind will be incapable of doing it in the future. ” So it replies: “ of 
a surety you cannot ( lit. will not ). ” This signiﬁes its miraculousness in three 
respects:

T h e   F i r s t :  Its foretelling the future, and as it predicted so it was. As you 
know, millions of Arabic books have attempted to imitate the style of Rev-
elation, as well as numerous obdurate [ deniers ], yet none of them has been 
successful, as you will see if you scrutinize them. It is as though it is the 
single one of its kind. So it is either inferior to all of them, and this is unani-
mously agreed to be impossible, or it is superior.

T h e   S e c o n d   R e s p e c t :   Its  silencing  and  snubbing  them,  and  censuring 
them for not doing it, and provoking them, while [ the Messenger ] was in 
that precarious situation [ furthering ] his great cause. This is a sure sign that 
he was reliable, trustworthy, and conﬁdent in his message.

T h e   T h i r d   R e s p e c t :   It  is  as  though  the  Qur’an  is  saying:  “ You’re  the 
leaders in eloquent speech and the ones most needy [ to produce the like of 

202

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

the Qur’an ], yet you haven’t been able to, so no one else will! ” Moreover, 
it infers that just as the past could not produce anything similar to Islam, the 
result of the Qur’an, so will the future will incapable of producing anything 
similar.

Now the positioning of  Ó Ò Ñ Ð Ï Î : Consider 
this: Ë Ê É  being  followed  by Î    necessitates  according  to  the 
tastes  of  eloquence  the  following  implied  sentences:  “ Since  you  haven’t 
been able to do it and you won’t be able to, it’s obvious it’s miraculous, so 
it [ must be ] Allah’s word. Hence it is incumbent on you to believe in it and 
comply with its commands. And one of its commands is n m l 
that you may fear Hell-ﬁre, so fear the Fire! ” See how concise it is, how 
miraculous!

The positioning of  Ó Ò Ñ Ð : The purpose of  Î is to 
frighten, and [ here, being followed by Ï  ] it has a strengthened, intensi-
ﬁed meaning, in order to terrify them with Ò Ñ  For a ﬁre fuelled 
by human beings is more appalling and horrifying. Then it further intensiﬁes 
it by adding stones. For [ the ﬁre ] that burns stones is even ﬁercer. It also 
infers that it is restraining them from idolatry. That is, if you don’t comply 
with Allah’s command and you worship stone idols, you will enter the Fire 
that consumes both worshippers and their objects of worship.

The  positioning  of   Ö Õ  :  This  elucidates  and  establishes  the 
consequence ( l u z ū m  ) between the conditional verb Ë Ê É [ the prota-
sis ] and its apodosis Î That is, this calamity is not like storm and tem-
pest and other [ natural ] disasters which do not strike wrongdoers alone but 
encompass the righteous and elect; it is particular to offenders and caused 
by disbelief, and the only means of salvation from it is to comply with the 
Qur’an. 

Moreover, Õ indicates that Hell is created and existent at the present 
moment,  contrarily  to  what  the  Mu‘tazilites  asserted.  The  following  will 
show you, and allow you to surmise, that Hell is eternal: if you reﬂect on 
the world from the point of view of wisdom ( a l - ḥ i k m a  ), you will see ﬁre 
to  be  a  vast  creature,  prevailing  and  overwhelming,  a  primordial  element 
of the lofty and lower worlds. And you will understand that it consists of a 
huge head and strange fruits that hang over into eternity. Don’t you see that 

VERSE 23-24 – EVIDENCES OF PROPHETHOOD

203

someone who espies a long stalk trailing along [ the ground ] will understand 
there to be a melon at the end of it; similarly whoever sees the creatures of 
ﬁre will understand that at their extremity are the bitter fruits of Hell. Like-
wise, whoever sees bounties and good things and pleasures will surmise that 
their extracts and the place they are poured out and their garden is Paradise.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  If Hell exists now, where is it located?
Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  We Sunnis believe that it exists now, but we cannot 

specify where.

• A n d   i f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  The literal meanings of some Hadiths indicate 
that it is under the earth, 1 and in one it says that its ﬁre is two hundred times 
ﬁercer and hotter than worldly ﬁre, 2 and that the sun also will enter Hell?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  The expression “ under the earth ” means its core, for 
the centre is under the globe. It has been established by scientiﬁc theories 
that the heat ( lit. ﬁre ) at the [ earth’s ] centre reaches two hundred thousand 
degrees. For every thirty-three commercial cubits ( d h i r ā ’  a l - t u j j ā r  ) one digs 
down into the earth, the temperature increases one degree, and at the centre 
it  is  approximately  two  hundred  thousand  degrees.  This  theory  is  in  con-
formity  with  the  Hadith  that  says  that  it  is  two  hundred  times  hotter  than 
worldly ﬁre. 

Moreover, in another Hadith it says that a part of this ﬁre [ of Hell ] is 
freezing ( z a m h a r ī r  ) 3 and that it burns with its coldness. This corresponds 
to the theory, for the ﬁre at the centre – [ from the centre ] to the surface – 
comprises all degrees of ﬁre [ heat ]. And it has been established by natural 
science [ a l - ḥ i k m a t   a l - ṭ a b ī ‘ i y y a  ] that there is a degree of heat ( lit. ﬁre ) that 
spontaneously attracts surrounding heat and burns it with its coldness and 
freezes water.

•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :   The  ﬁre  inside  the  earth,  that  it  contains,  is  very 
small,  so  how  will  it  encompass  Hell,  which  will  encompass  the  heavens 
and earth?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Even if in respect of this manifest world ( a l - m u l k  ) 
and  [ Hell ]  being  ‘rolled  up’  ( a l - m a ṭ w ī y y a  ),  it  is  contained  by  the  earth, 
but  in  respect  of  the  hereafter,  it  will  become  so  vast  it  will  encompass 
thousands [ of globes ] similar to the earth. Yes, the Manifest World ( ‘ ā l a m  
a l - s h a h ā d a  ) is like a screen preventing contact between this [ present ] ﬁre

and its branches. Also, its being under the earth does not necessitate its being 
conjoined with it, for the branches of the tree of creation have produced such 
fruits as the sun, the moon, and the stars, and our earth, and other earths. So 
what lies beneath the fruits includes the area between the branches where it 
is found. The dominions ( m u l k  ) of Allah the Most High are indeed wide and 
the tree of creation is spread [ throughout them ], so wherever Hell travels it 
cannot be repulsed.

It says in a Hadith: “ Hell is folded up. ” This possibly means that Hell 
is an egg of the bird of our ﬂying earth, and when the veil of the Manifest 
World is rent, [ the earth ] will lay its egg and [ Hell ] will emerge, baring its 
teeth at the people of rebellion. It is also possible that it was this [ question of 
Hell ] being ‘folded up’ that caused the Mu‘tazilites to fall into the error [ of 
believing ] that Hell is not now existent, and to cling onto it.

Now for the positioning [ and relationships of ]
the parts of the phrases

The [ conjunction ] و in » º ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´ ³ is [ so placed ] 
because of the relationship between [ this verse and  n m l but no 
such relationship is apparent. It becomes apparent only through two implied 
questions and their answers: ﬁrstly is the implied answer to the question aris-
ing from the ﬁrst verse: “ How should we worship? ”, that is, ] “ as the Qur’an 
has taught you. ” [ In reply to the second implied question: “ How can we 
know the Qur’an is Allah’s word? ”, it says: ¶ μ ´ ³  ] 1

The use of  N which expresses hesitation, instead of اَذِا which infers cer-
tainty and resolve, [ although it is certain that they are in a state of doubt, ] 
indicates  that  because  means  had  arisen  to  dispel  their  doubts,  their  very 
existence should be doubtful or impossible even; they could only be hypo-
thetical. 

Also, the doubt expressed by N looks to the [ literary ] style and not to the 

Speaker ( May He be exalted ).

The  substitution  of  ¶ μ ´  for  [ the  verbal  form ]  ‘you  doubt’ 
although the latter is more concise, indicates that the source of their doubt is 
their sick natures and characters. 

1.  Nursi, İ ş â r â t ü ’ l - İ ’ c a z  [ Abdülmecid ], 203-4.

VERSE 23-24 – EVIDENCES OF PROPHETHOOD

205

And  the  doubt  encompassing  ( ẓ a r f ī y y a  )  them  although  it  is  contained 
( m a ẓ r ū f  ) by their hearts hints that the darkness of doubt has spread from 
their  hearts  and  overwhelmed  their  whole  physical  beings,  enveloping  in 
darkness all ways [ of possible illumination ].

The use of the indeﬁnite for ¶ is to make it general. That is, which-
ever of the sorts of doubt you feel, the answer is the same, and that is: [ the 
Qur’an ] is miraculous and true! Thus, your accusing [ the Qur’an ] of error 
due  to  your  superﬁcial  view  is  an  error  and  it  is  not  necessary  to  answer 
every  doubt  speciﬁcally.  You  can  surely  see  that  a  person  who  [ happens 
upon ] a spring and tastes its pure, sweet water does not need to taste all its 
subsidiary streams and branches.

The [ partitive ]  ْنِ(cid:174) in ¹ ¸ infers the implied words اـَ(cid:179)ْ(cid:170)َ
ّ(cid:175)ِ(cid:174)  ٍء ْيَ(cid:130) ىِ(cid:158)
The word( s ) ¹  indicates that the source of their doubt is [ the Qur’an’s ] 

revelation ( lit. descent ). And the decisive reply proves its revelation.

ّزَ(cid:178) ا َ

The  choice  of  [ the  IInd  form ] ¹  which  denotes  gradual  revelation, 
instead of [ the IVth form ] اـَ(cid:179)ْ(cid:170)َزْ(cid:178)َا which suggests that it was sudden, alludes 
to  the  excuses  they  advanced  saying:  “ Why  isn’t  it  revealed  to  him  all 
at  once? ”  Indeed,  the  Qur’an  was  revealed  gradually  as  events  required, 
according to circumstances, verse-by-verse, sura-by-sura.

The choice of the word  » rather than ‘the Messenger’ or ‘Muham-
mad’ indicates exaltation of the Messenger, and hints at the elevated nature 
of worship, and corroborates the command n and infers the repulsion of 
delusions, for the Messenger ( Upon whom be peace ) performed more wor-
ship than anyone and recited more of the Qur’an. So reﬂect on this!

The phrase ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ : [ The purpose of ] the command ¼ 
is to display their impotence, and it comprises a challenge, and censure, and 
calls on them to try to dispute it, making clear their inability to do this.

While  the  word ½  indicates  [ the  Qur’an’s ]  silencing  and  dumb-

founding them utterly, as follows:

T h e   F i r s t   L e v e l   o f   C h a l l e n g e :   It  says:  “ Produce  the  like  of  the  whole 
Qur’an together with its truths, sciences, predictions, and elevated composi-
tion, all from someone illiterate.

T h e   S e c o n d   L e v e l :  It says: “ If you can’t do that, fabricate something, but 

its composition must be similarly eloquent.

T h e   T h i r d   L e v e l :  It says: “ If you can’t do that either, produce around ten

T h e   F o u r t h   L e v e l :  If you’re not capable of doing that either, just produce 

[ the equivalent of ] a long sura.

T h e   F i f t h   L e v e l :  If that’s too difﬁcult for you as well, just bring one sura  
even if it’s very short like ( 108:1 ) W    V   and from someone illiterate 
like him.
T h e   S i x t h   L e v e l :  If it isn’t possible for you to have it produced by some-

one illiterate, get an adept scholar or skilful writer to do it.

T h e   S e v e n t h   L e v e l :  If that’s too hard for you too, a number of you co-

operate to produce it.

T h e   E i g h t h   L e v e l :  And if you can’t do that, seek the help of all men and 
jinn,  and  the  assistance  of  all  the  results  of  their  shared  knowledge  from 
the time of Adam till the end of the world, as well as those ideas found in 
the books available to you about the Arabic language and its styles, written 
with the desire to imitate [ the Qur’an ] or out of obstinacy by those wanting 
to dispute it. To say nothing of authoritative scholars, if a person of scant 
intelligence or an ignorant one even were to study them, he would declare 
that none of them was similar to [ the Qur’an ]. So it is either inferior to all 
of them, and this is impossible as is unanimously agreed, or it is superior to 
all. And this is what was wanted, as was mentioned above. Indeed, it has not 
been [ successfully ] disputed in thirteen centuries. And as that was true in 
the past, so it will be in the future, till the end of time.

T h e   N i n t h   L e v e l :  It says: Don’t remonstrate saying you don’t have any 
witnesses and we don’t testify for you either. Go and call your witnesses and 
your partisans and let them consult their consciences; will they be so bold as 
to uphold what you claim disputing [ the Qur’an ]?

If  you  have  understood  these  levels,  consider  now  how  the  Qur’an  is 
miraculous in its conciseness, indicating these levels, silencing them effec-
tively and loosening their bridles [ giving them the opportunity to reply ]. 

Understand too that human incapability to dispute even the shortest sura 
is a clear argument from effect to cause ( i n n ī y a t u h u   b a d ī h ī y y a  ). As for its 
being argued from cause to effect ( l i m m ī y y a t u h u  ), it is said “ Allah the Most 
High prevented men from disputing it. ” The most correct school in the lat-
ter question [ the argument from cause to effect ] is that followed by ‘Abd 
al-Qāhir al-Jurjānī, al-Zamakhsharī, and al-Sakkākī. This states that “ it is 
beyond  human  power  [ to  emulate  the  Qur’an’s ]  elevated  composition. ” 
Moreover, al-Sakkākī preferred [ the view ] that its miraculous inimitability 

VERSE 23-24 – EVIDENCES OF PROPHETHOOD

can only be sensed ( d h a w q ī  ) and cannot be expressed or explicated. It can 
only  be  experienced.  ِرْدَ(cid:192) ْمَ(cid:170)  ْقُذَ(cid:192) ْمَ(cid:170)  ْنَ(cid:174)    But  the  author  of  D a l ā ’ i l   a l - I ‘ j ā z  
[ al-Jurjānī ] preferred [ the view ] that it is possible to express it [ in words ], 
and we subscribe to his school in this question.

The choice of “ s ū r a  ” rather than such words as n a j m , ṭ ā ’ i f a , or n a w b a , 
indicates [ the Qur’an’s ] silencing them [ by answering ] the source of their 
doubts, namely, “ Why wasn’t it revealed to him all at once? ” That is, [ the 
Qur’an told them: ] “ You produce some and let’s see it, even if only a single 
short piece! ” 

The  choice  of  the  word    ﺓ ﹶﺭﻮ ﹸﺳ  signiﬁes  too  that  there  are  numerous 

beneﬁts in the Qur’an being divided into suras, as has been elucidated by 
al-Zamakhsharī, and that this unusual method contains many subtle points.
The phrase ¿ ¾ signiﬁes two [ possible ] things: That is, [ the sufﬁxed 
pronoun “ h i  ” refers ] either to the thing revealed ( a l - m u n z a l  ) [ the Qur’an 
– that is, “ produce a sura like one of the Qur‘an’s ” ], or to the one to whom 
it was revealed ( a l - m u n z a l   ‘ a l a y h i  ) [ the Messenger – that is, “ get someone 
unlettered like him to produce it ” ]. If it is the former, it should be phrased 
ُهْ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174) ٍةَرو ُ(cid:126)  ِلـْ(cid:103)ِ(cid:174) but it is expressed as ¿ ¾  indicating that the second pos-
sibility is taken into account. That is, “ You can invalidate his case with your 
disputing only if someone unlettered like him [ the Messenger ] does it. ” It 
indicates too that [ the Qur’an’s ] miraculousness could be invalidated only 
if disputed by a collection [ a literary work,  m a j m ū ‘ a  – that is, if the sura 
produced was part of a complete work ] like [ the Qur’an ]. 

The  phrase  also  allusively  directs  attention  to  the  other  scriptures  that 
were revealed like the Qur’an, so that the listener may weigh them up in his 
mind and understand the Qur’an’s elevated nature.

The sentence Ä Ã Â Á À The choice of  ﺍﻮﹸﻋﹾﺩﺍ instead of 
‘seek the help or assistance of’ indicates that those who might respond to 
them and defend them are not non-existent but are there [ with them ] and do 
not need to be called. 

The word 

bic language, those who observe [ witness ] you, and your gods.

I n   r e s p e c t   o f   t h e   ﬁ r s t   it  silences  them  by  rebutting  their  argument  that 
their own inability does not prove that their literary leaders lack the power 
[ to imitate the Qur’an ].

208

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

I n   r e s p e c t   o f   t h e   s e c o n d  it dumbfounds them by cutting short their excuse 
that  they  had  no  witnesses,  for  every  outlook  and  way  has  defenders  and 
witnesses.

I n   r e s p e c t   o f   t h e   t h i r d  it rebukes and derides them, asking why their gods, 
which they look to for beneﬁts and to repel harm, do not help them in this 
matter that is troubling them.

The  genitive  construction  of 

ﹶﺀﺍ ﹶﺪ ﹶﻬ ﹸﺷ  and  the  pronominal  suffix    ْمُ(cid:166) 

denotes  particularity  and  strengthens  the  ﬁrst  meaning  [ above ]:  “ Your 
great ones are present with you and there are special [ bonds ] between you; 
if they had been capable of helping you, surely [ they would have done ]. ” 
It  expresses  the  second  meaning  like  this:  “ We  accept  the  testimony  of 
those who support you and are your partisans, for they won’t venture to 
testify  for  something  whose  invalidity  is  self-evident. ”  And  it  takes  the 
third meaning by the arm and mocks it, saying: “ Why don’t the gods you 
worship help you? ”

With respect to the ﬁrst, the phrase Ä Ã Â   indicates generality; that 
is, [ call ] all the eloquent masters of language in the world other than Allah 
the Most High. It indicates too that [ the Qur’an’s ] miraculousness is only 
[ miraculousness ] because it is from Allah.

With  respect  to  the  second,  it  indicates  their  impotence  and  confusion 
when they say: “ Allah is our witness. Allah knows that we can do it. ” For it 
is the habit of those defeated in argument and reduced to impotence to swear 
by Allah and call on Him to witness what they are incapable of proving. 

And with respect to the third it indicates that their disputing the Messen-
ger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) was exactly the response of asso-
ciating partners with Allah ( s h i r k  ) to divine unity ( t a w ḥ ī d  ), and of lifeless, 
unconscious beings to the Creator of the heavens and the earth.

The  phrase Ç Æ Å   alludes  to  their  saying:  “ If  we  wanted,  we 
could say something similar. ” It also insinuates: “ You aren’t truthful. Your 
truthfulness is only hypothetical; indeed, you only utter sophistries. And you 
haven’t fallen into doubt because you were seeking the truth, but because 
you  were  seeking  the  false,  and  you  fell  into  it.  Furthermore,  the  conse-
quence ( apodosis ) [ of the conditional verb “ if what you say ” ] is the sum 
and substance of the previous phrases; that is, “ do it! ” That is, “ If what you 
say is true, then try to produce something similar. ” 

VERSE 23-24 – EVIDENCES OF PROPHETHOOD

209

The sentence: Ï  Î Í Ì Ë Ê É With the phrase 

Ç Æ Å the Qur’an is confuting them with a conditional syllogism, 
excepting the opposite of the following phrase to occasion the opposite of 
the preceding one.

A summary of it: “ If you were truthful, you would have disputed it and 
produced a sura, but you didn’t [ coundn’t ] and you won’t [ be able to ]. One 
concludes from this that you weren’t truthful, while your enemy, the Mes-
senger ( Upon whom be peace ), is truthful and that the Qur’an is miracu-
lous. So this obliges you to believe in him so that you may fear [ avoid ] the 
punishment [ of the Fire ]! ” See how miraculous is this conciseness of the 
Revelation! 

Then, saying: Ë Ê É instead of ‘but you haven’t [ done it ]’ 

َنوُ(cid:171)َ(cid:151)ْ(cid:159)َ(cid:98) اَ(cid:174)  ْنِ(cid:167)ٰ(cid:170) it indicates through the doubt denoted by L conformity with 
their  suspicions  ( ẓ a n n  ),  and  through  its  denoting  a  condition  that  is  the 
opposite of the following sentence, necessitates the opposite of the previous 
one. Then, in place of the result, that is, the opposite of the previous one, I 
mean “ but you weren’t truthful, ” it mentions the third of three successive 
consequences ( l ā z i m  ) of the cause ( ‘ i l l a  ), which is Ï Î to frighten, 
intimidate, and threaten them. 

As  for   

ﺍﻮﹸﻠﹶﻌﹾﻔﹶﺗ  ﹾﻢﹶﻟ  ﹾﻥﹺﺇ
ﹾﻥﹺﺇ

  :  Its  signifying  the  past  by  virtue  of  the Ê  and  the 
future  through  the 
  is  in  order  to  direct  attention  towards  their  past,  as 
though  it  is  saying  to  them:  “ Look  at  your  decorated  orations  and  gilded 
Seven Hanging Odes: are any of them equal to [ the Qur’an ] or close to it 
even, or in the same class? ”

The choice of  Í rather than اوُ(cid:98)ْاَ(cid:98) suggests two points: 
T h e   F i r s t :  It infers that the source of the [ Qur’an’s ] miraculousness and 
inimitability ( i ‘ j ā z  ) is their impotence ( ‘ a j z  ), and the source of their impo-
tence is [ related to ] action ( ﬁ ‘ l  ) not to the work ( a t h a r  ). [ That is, the source 
of their impotence is their inability to ‘do’ or produce something similar to 
the Qur’an, not the work itself ]. 

T h e   S e c o n d :   It  is  for  conciseness.  For  just  as  in  grammar  [ the  verbal 
root ]  f a ‘ a l a  is used to depict the patterns and forms of the verb, so in the 
literary styles it is used as the summary of actions and stories, as though it 
were a pronoun expressing whole sentences and a metonymy ( k i n ā y a  ) for 
them.

210

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

Í Ì : The future and emphasis expressed by  3 infer deﬁniteness, 
and this indicates that the speaker is conﬁdent and serious and that he has 
no doubts concerning what he is saying. And this is a sign that there is no 
trickery or deception [ in what he says and does ]. 

The use of  Î instead of  اوُ(cid:93)َ

ّ(cid:179)َ(cid:107)َ(cid:98) [ both express the same meaning, but 
a l - i t t i q ā ’   follows  on  after  belief,  while  avoidance  does  not  have  this  sec-
ondary meaning ] implies as a substitute for the consequence [ of the above 
conditional sentence ] the sentence: “ Believe  and avoid associating partners 
with Allah ( s h i r k  ), which is a cause of entering Hell-ﬁre. ” 

The deﬁnite article is used in Ï because it is well known and ﬁrmly 
ﬁxed in people’s minds, having been heard about from [ all ] the prophets 
from  Adam  up  till  now.  Its  being  governed  by  the  relative  pronoun  Ð 
although [ such pronouns ] generally refer to something previously known, 
is in consequence of the earlier revelation of ( 66:6 ) μ ´ ³ ² 
before this verse, and those addressed had heard this. Thus, the relative pro-
noun is in place.

μ ´ ³  As mentioned above, the purpose of this is to intim-
idate, and intimidation is made severer by threatening. Thus it threatens with 
the word ´ as though striking them and reinforces this with ُةَراَ(cid:107) ِ(cid:110) as 
though  castigating  them:  “ What  proﬁt  or  salvation  do  you  hope  for  from 
these idols that are now the instruments of your torture? ”

As for the phrase: Ö Õ Know that the position [ here required ] 
ْمـُ(cid:167)َ(cid:170)  ْتَ
ّدِ(cid:150)ُا however, generally the Qur’an mentions summaries and general 
rules at the ends of verses to indicate the most powerful evidences for the 
statements [ made in the verse in question ]. Thus, what is basically [ implied 
here ] is َن(cid:192)ِرِ(cid:158)اَ(cid:167)ْ(cid:171)ِ(cid:170)  ْتَ
ّدِ(cid:150)ُا “ prepared for you 
if you disbelieve, since it is prepared for the disbelievers. ” For this reason 
the noun is used in place of the pronoun.

ّ(cid:179)(cid:170)اَو  َن(cid:192)ِرِ(cid:158)اَ(cid:167)ْ(cid:170)ا  َنِ(cid:174) ْمـُ(cid:167)َ

ِ(cid:202) ْمـُ(cid:167)َ(cid:170)  ْتَ
ّ(cid:178)َ

ّدِ(cid:150)ُا ُراـَ

Then Õ  being  in  the  perfect  tense  indicates  that  Hell  exists  at  the 

present time, as was discussed above.

Consider this: The composition and positioning ( n a ẓ m  ) of this verse, like 
its sisters, has three aspects: the positioning of the verse as a whole [ and its 
relationship ] with what precedes it; the positioning [ and relationships ] of 
the verse’s phrases; and positioning [ and relationships ] of the constituents 
of the phrases.

T h e   F i r s t :  Between this verse’s meaning and the previous verses are var-
ious relations, and different lines stretch out from it to those verses’ phrases. 
Surely you see how at the start of the sura the Qur’an praises itself and the 
believers for [ their ] belief and good works, then with this verse indicates the 
result of belief and fruit of good works. And similarly, how it censures the 
disbelievers and condemns the dissemblers and describes their way, which 
leads to eternal perdition, then alludes with this verse to the  light of everlast-
ing happiness, pointing it out to them to increase their sense of loss at having 
missed that supreme bounty.

And having charged [ the people ] n m l although this means 
hardship and difﬁculty and giving up immediate pleasures, it ﬂings open to 
them the doors of postponed [ future pleasures ]. With this verse it satisﬁes 
and assures their souls.

And having proved divine unity, the principal pillar of belief and chief 
[ religious ] obligation, with this verse it announces the fruits of divine unity, 
the title-page of mercy and preface of divine pleasure by pointing out Para-
dise and eternal happiness. 

And having proved prophethood, the second pillar of belief, through the 
miraculousness  of  the  verse  ( 2:23 ) ¶ μ ´ ³  with  this  verse  and 

211

212

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

indirectly with the previous one, it alludes to the duties and obligations of 
prophethood, which are to warn and deliver good news through the tongue 
of the Qur’an.

And having threatened, intimidated, and warned in the previous verse, in 
accordance with the mystery of the relation between opposites, in this one it 
promises, excites desire, and gives good tidings.

Also, if a person is to make the souls [ of others ] submit and persist in 
obedience  and  make  [ their ]  consciences  obey  the  dictates  of  reason,  he 
will have to excite both the sense of fear and sense of longing by bringing 
together  [ the  obligations ]  of  frightening  [ away  from  wrong ]  and  attract-
ing [ to right ] ( t a r h ī b   w a   t a r g h ī b  ). For the dictates of the intellect are only 
temporarily [ effective ], and there has to be in the conscience a permanent 
motivation and compelling incentive.

Moreover, having indicated one part of the hereafter with the previous 
verse, so with this one it indicates the other, which is the spring of eternal 
happiness. Similarly, there it alludes with ﬁre to Hell, and here it explicitly 
mentions Paradise.

Now understand that Paradise and Hell are two fruits which point to eter-
nity  from  the  tree  of  creation,  and  are  the  two  results  of  the  chain  of  the 
universe. They are two storage tanks into which the universe is poured, and 
two pools for it as it ﬂows into eternity. Yes, the universe will be convulsed 
and shaken up with a violent motion, and Paradise and Hell will appear and 
will ﬁll up [ with the appropriate matters ]. 

A n   E l u c i d a t i o n   o f   T h i s :  When Allah ( May His glory be exalted ) willed 
the creation of a world for examination and trial, for numerous instances of 
wisdom  too  ﬁne  [ to  be  apprehended  by ]  the  mind,  He  willed  the  change 
and  transformation  of  this  world  for  [ many ]  reasons.  He  combined  good 
and evil, and mixed in harm with beneﬁt, and included ugliness in beauty. 
He joined [ evil, harm, and ugliness ] to Hell and sent them assistance from 
it. And He despatched good things and virtues to be manifested in Paradise.
Furthermore,  when  He  willed  trial  and  competition  in  [ the  world  of ] 
human  beings  and  [ for  there  to  be ]  differences  and  change  among  them, 
he mixed in bad people with good. Then when the period of testing closes 
and divine will [ commands ] that they should be eternal, He will make the 
bad  people  manifest  the  verse:  ( 36:59 ) A @ ? >  while  the 
good will be honoured and graced with the address: ( 39:73 ) º ¹ 

VERSE 25 – EVIDENCES OF THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD

213

Then when the two categories are separated out the universe will be puri-
ﬁed, and evil and harmful matters will be withdrawn from the good and the 
beneﬁcial and perfected, and they will collect on one side.

I n   S h o r t :   If  you  study  the  universe  carefully,  you  will  encounter  two 
basic elements, two long crawling stems [ like melons ], that when [ the fruits 
of which are ] collected together and made immortal, will become Hell and 
Paradise.

An Introduction

An Introduction 

This verse and the preceding ones betoken the resurrection of the dead 

and great gathering. There are four noteworthy points in this matter:
F i r s t l y :  The possibility of the world’s destruction and its death.
S e c o n d l y :  Their occurrence.
T h i r d l y :  Its repair and being raised to life.
F o u r t h l y :  Their occurrence.
T h e   P o s s i b i l i t y   o f   t h e   U n i v e r s e ’ s   D e a t h :  If a thing is subject to the law 
of evolution ( q ā n ū n   a l - t a k ā m u l  ), it undergoes growth and development. It 
has therefore a natural lifespan and allotted time of death; it cannot escape 
death’s call. According to inductive reasoning, [ this goes for ] most mem-
bers of the species ( a f r ā d   a l - a n w ā ‘  ). So just as man, the microcosm, cannot 
be saved from destruction; so too there is no refuge from death for the world, 
the macroanthropos. Similarly, a tree is a miniature copy of the universe and 
is pursued by demolition and dissolution; so too the chain of the universe is 
a part of the tree of creation and cannot be saved from the hand of destruc-
tion  and  reconstruction.  So  if  not  struck  by  a  violent  wind  or  an  external 
illness [ ordained by ] pre-eternal divine will before [ the end of ] its natural 
lifespan, and if its Maker does not annihilate it earlier, there will necessarily 
and certainly and even according to scientiﬁc reckoning come a day when 
the verses ( 81:1-2 ) ' & % *# " ! and ( 82:1 ) . - , 
will be realized. Then the macroanthropos will suffer its death agonies and 
utter a horrible growl, an appalling roar that will resound through space.

I t s   o c c u r r e n c e :  As is agreed by all the revealed religions, and testiﬁed 
to  by  all  sound  natures,  and  indicated  by  the  change,  transformation,  and 
renewal of the universe, – and if you wish, imagine the world’s death ago-
nies and its roar – the universe is bound together with a delicate, elevated 

214

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

order and clings to those wondrous bonds. So when one of the heavenly bod-
ies receives the order: “ Be! ” or “ Quit your orbit! ” you will see the world 
[ suddenly ] smitten by its death agonies and the stars and heavenly bodies 
beginning to clash and collide. Inﬁnite space will thunder and roar. On one 
part striking another sparks will ﬂy off as big as the earth or bigger. Can you 
imagine the awful sound of millions of ﬁring cannons the smallest shells of 
which are larger than the earth? For that will be the sound of its death. With 
the onset of its demise, the creation will be convulsed and beings will sepa-
rate out, and Hell will emerge together with its inhabitants and matters, and 
Paradise will become manifest, bringing together all the subtleties derived 
from its elements.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Why is the universe subject to change and time and 
[ so ]  will  be  destroyed,  then  at  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  will  be  made 
eternal, ﬁxed, and unchanging?

Yo u  w o u l d  b e  t o l d :  Since pre-eternal wisdom and providence necessitated 
trial and examination, and the development of potentialities and unfolding 
of abilities, and the disclosure of the relative truths ( a l - ḥ a q ā ’ i q   a l - n i s b i y y a  ), 
which  in  the  hereafter  will  be  total  truths  ( a l - ḥ a q ā ’ i q   a l - ḥ a q ī q i y y a  ),  and 
the existence of relative degrees and many instances of wisdom the human 
mind is powerless to perceive; the Maker ( May His glory be exalted ) made 
the  natures  and  dispositions  of  things  different,  and  combined  harmful 
things with useful ones, and interspersed evils among good, and He brought 
together  ugly  things  and  beautiful.  The  Hand  of  Power  kneaded  together 
opposites and the universe became subject to the law of change, alternation, 
variation, and development ( a l - t a k ā m u l  ).

Thus, the Maker ( May His glory be exalted ) willed through His grace 
that when the arena of examination is closed, and the time of trial ﬁnished, 
and the harvest-time has come, He will purify the various opposites to make 
them eternal, and separate out the causes of change, and distinguish the mat-
ters of difference. Then Hell will be formed with its solid body, receiving the 
address of > And Paradise will be manifested with its eternal, stable 
body and foundations. [ This will be ] in accordance with [ the rule ] “ rela-
tions are essential for order, ” [ That is, there is no contrariety between the 
elements and parts forming Paradise and Hell; there are only relations and 
bonds between them ] 1 and order is the cause of continuity.

VERSE 25 – EVIDENCES OF THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD

215

Moreover, through His perfect power, the Most High will give the dwell-
ers of those two eternal abodes stable existences that will not be subject to 
dissolution or change, for change here, which leads to extinction, arises from 
the relative differences [ that is, the imbalance ] between what is formed and 
what dissolves. But the relative stability there [ that is, the balance ] will per-
mit change that will not lead to disintegration.

T h e   T h i r d   a n d   F o u r t h   P o i n t s ,  I mean the possibility of the repair and 
raising to life of the earth, and their occurrence: since proofs of divine unity 
and  prophethood  taken  from  the  Qur’an  and  Hadiths  ( a l - d a l ī l   a l - n a q l ī  ) 
alone are not valid as it would necessitate a circular argument, 1 the Qur’an 
alludes to rational proofs of them [ as well ]. It is permissible however for 
the resurrection of the dead to be proven by both reason and the Qur’an and 
Hadiths  ( b i ’ l - ‘ a q l   w a ’ l - n a q l  ).  For  rational  proofs,  you  may  consult  what 
we explained to our utmost when expounding  ( 2:4 ) A @ ?  Brieﬂy, 
order, mercy, and grace only become order, mercy and grace with the com-
ing of the resurrection. The transmitted ( n a q l ī  ) evidences consist of what 
everyone has said [ all the prophets ],2 and what the miraculous Qur’an states 
about its occurrence. For these evidences as well as indications of the rational 
ones, you may refer to this subject in Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī’s commentary, 3 
for he enumerates the verses that prove the resurrection of the dead.

I n   S h o r t :  A person has only to peruse the samples, examples, and simili-
tudes of the resurrection in very many realms ( lit. species – a l - a n w ā ‘ ) [ of 
beings ] to surmise from their diverse signs the existence of bodily resurrec-
tion and eternal happiness.

The positioning and relationships of the phrases

You should be aware that the string on which the pearls of this verse are 

threaded in successive order is this: eternal happiness is of two sorts:

T h e   F i r s t   a n d   F o r e m o s t :  Allah the Most High’s pleasure, and His grace, 

manifestation, and nearness.

1.  This is because the validity of evidences taken from Qur’an and Hadiths is tied to 
the authenticity and veraciousness of prophethood; to prove prophethood by such evidenc-
es  therefore  would  entail  an  impossibility  and  circular  argument.  See,  Nursi,  İ ş â r â t ü ’ l -
İ ’ c a z  [ Abdülmecid ], 218.

2.  Nursi, İ ş â r â t ü ’ l - İ ’ c a z  [ Abdülmecid ], 218.

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

T h e   S e c o n d :  Physical bliss, which is attained through one’s house, food, 
and marriage, and their continuing for all eternity, which completes and per-
fects them.

The ﬁrst sorts are not in need of detailed explanation, or anyway such 
explanation is not possible. As for the second, the most agreeable of dwell-
ings is that set among plants and ﬂowing water. You surely know that the 
plashing, gurgling waters of rivers, whispering beneath pavilions and gar-
dens,  inspire  poetry  and  breathe  love  into  hearts.  As  for  food,  it  is  suste-
nance,  and  while  the  most  delicious  of  basic  sustenance  is  that  which  is 
familiar, fruits are best in one respect when varied, for familiarity [ allows ] 
one to recognize the high degree of the bounty and its superiority over simi-
lar things. Moreover, one of its highest pleasures is knowing that [ the sus-
tenance ]  is  the  reward  for  one’s  actions.  Another  is  its  source  and  store 
being right before one’s eyes, yielding the pleasure of conﬁdent assurance. 
Concerning marriage, one of man’s most intense needs is to have someone 
respond to him with heartfelt love and to share with [ his partner ] pleasure 
and  intimacy,  and  for  them  to  together  feel  wonder  [ at  the  divine  boun-
ties ]  and  to  ponder  over  them.  You  must  have  observed  that  if  someone 
sees something unusual that perplexes him and makes him think, he calls on 
someone, if only mentally, to share his perplexity. And the gentlest of hearts, 
and the kindest and warmest, are those of the second sex. And those whose 
spirits will blend fully and hearts will achieve complete intimacy, and whose 
outward union will be pure and chaste are those of the second sex who have 
been puriﬁed and cleansed of bad morals and unpleasant traits.

•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  [ The purpose of ] food is to perpetuate a person’s 
[ life ] for by means of it those parts of the body that dissolve are re-formed, 
and marriage is to perpetuate the human race, but in the hereafter people will 
be immortal and not subject to change and dissolution. Anyway, there will 
be no reproduction in the hereafter, will there?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  The beneﬁts of food and marriage are not restricted to 
perpetuating life and reproduction; they are a source of great pleasure in this 
painful world. So why shouldn’t there be pleasure of a pure, elevated kind 
in the realm of bliss?

•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Pleasure here [ in this world is obtained ] through 

dispelling pain and suffering, [ but in the hereafter, there will be none ]?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Dispelling pain is only one cause of pleasure. Also, 
it is not possible to compare the eternal realm and this world. Indeed, the 

VERSE 25 – EVERLASTING LIFE AND HAPPINESS

217

garden of Horhor 1 here is to the lofty gardens of Paradise, what the [ pain-
tainted ] pleasures of this world are to the pleasures of the hereafter. How-
ever superior Paradise is to the garden here, its pleasures are superior to the 
same extent. Ibn ‘Abbas ( May Allah be pleased with him ) alluded to this 
vast  difference  when  he  said: اَ(cid:183)ُ(cid:86)ا َ(cid:175) ْ(cid:126)َا  َ
ّ(cid:179)َ(cid:107)ْ(cid:170)ا ىِ(cid:158)  َسْ(cid:193)َ(cid:170)  “ The  only  thing  in 
Paradise will be their names. ” 2 That is, the fruits of this world.

ّ(cid:202)ِا ِةَ

Regarding eternal life and perpetual pleasure, consider this: pleasure is 
only true pleasure if it is untouched by evanescence, for just as the dispelling 
of pain is pleasure or a cause of it, so the passing of pleasure is pain; indeed, 
even  to  imagine  its  passing  is  painful.  In  fact,  the  poetry  of  metaphorical 
( m a j ā z ī  )  lovers  all  consists  of  lamentations  at  such  pain.  The  d ī w ā n s   of 
these purveyors of a love that is not ‘true’ are nothing but their weeping and 
wailing at this pain, which arises from the imagined passing of the beloved.
Indeed, most temporary pleasures produce lasting pains when they disap-
pear, and every time a person recalls them, regret surges up in him and he 
exclaims: “ Alas! Alack! ”, cursing this pain of the spirit. Then most suffer-
ing yields lasting pleasure when it subsides, and every time the person thinks 
of his being saved from it, he exclaims: “ Praise and thanks be to Allah! ”, 
alluding to this immaterial bounty.

Yes, man was created for eternity and he can obtain true pleasure only 
from  eternal  things  such  as  knowledge  of  Allah,  love,  perfection,  knowl-
edge, and so on.

I n   S h o r t :  Pleasure and bounty are only pleasure and bounty if they are 

eternal.

Now that you have seen the string, thread the phrases of the verses on it. 
The  phrase % $ # " !  When  the  Most  High 
charged the people [ with worship ], and proved [ the Messenger’s ] prophet-
hood, and charged the Messenger with conveying His commands – so that 
by  giving  the  glad  tidings  [ of  Paradise ]  he  would  ensure  they  complied 
with the obligations, which entailed difﬁculties and the giving up of worldly 
pleasures – he was commanded both to warn and to convey the good news 
of Allah the Most High’s pleasure, and His grace, and nearness, and of ever-
lasting happiness.

1.  Nursi’s medrese in Van, at the foot of the citadel. The onomatopoeic name recalls 

the bubbling stream that ran through its garden.

2.  “ The only thing in this world from Paradise is the Names. ” ( Or something simi-

lar. ) See, Nursi, I s h ā r ā t   a l - I ‘ j ā z  [ Iḥsān Qāsim ], 196.

And the phrase ) ( ' & : As was mentioned above, man’s most 
essential need, since he has a body, is a place and a dwelling. The most beau-
tiful places are those with plants and trees, and the most pleasant are those 
with pools among their verdant gardens, and the most splendid are those that 
have abundant streams ﬂowing among their trees and under their pavilions. 
This is why it says , + * ) 

After  somewhere  [ to  live ]  man’s  greatest  need,  the  ﬁnest  of  physical 
pleasures,  is  food  and  drink.  These  are  indicated  by  [ the  words ]  gardens 
and  rivers.  And  the  ﬁnest  of  sustenance  is  that  which  is  familiar,  so  one 
may appraise the degree of its superiority over similar foods. And the most 
delicious are fruits, as long as they are varied. And the purest pleasure is 
from [ fruits ] that are known and picked from close by. But most delicious 
of all is knowing that they are the fruits of one’s labours. This is why it says 

: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 / .  That  is,  in  this 
world or before now.

The phrase > = <   It says in a Hadith that they will be similar 
in form but different in taste. 1 Hence, the verse indicates that the pleasure of 
fruits lies in their change and variation, and that perfect pleasure is when the 
person is served and [ the fruit ] is given to him.

The phrase  C B A @ : As you saw above [ when describing ] 
the string [ for the verse’s pearls ], a person needs a wife, a companion, to 
dwell with, through whose eyes he may look and who may see through his 
eyes, and whose love he may beneﬁt from, this being the gentlest of the rays 
of divine mercy. Complete intimacy too is with her.

And the phrase G F E : When a person encounters a bounty 
or delight, the ﬁrst thing that occurs to him is “ Is it going to continue or will 
it be spoiled by ceasing? ” For this reason, [ the Qur’an ] indicates with the 
words G F E the completion of the bounty through its endur-
ing in Paradise, and it and his wives being perpetual there, and the continu-
ation of the pleasures and his beneﬁting from them for ever.

The positioning and relationships of the parts of the verse’s phrases

The phrase  % $ # " !
The [ conjunction ] و points to the warning that drips from the previous 

[ verse ]. 

~ is a sign that Paradise is [ purely ] a favour of the Most High and not 
incumbent on Him, and moreover, that actions should not be on account of 
Paradise [ that is, in the hope of it ]. And [ the verb ] being in the imperative 
suggests:  “ Convey  it  as  though  you’re  conveying  good  news! ”  For  [ the 
Prophet ] was charged with communicating the message.

Then the use of # " instead of the more succinct ‘the believers’ 
َن(cid:193)ِ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174)ْؤُ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)َا alludes to the " at the beginning of the sura so that the details 
given there may elucidate the brevity here.

The use of the perfect tense here in $ # although there [ at the 
start of the sura ] the imperfect is used for + and É  indicates that 
the imperfect is appropriate [ in connection with ] praise and encouragement, 
but that the perfect is suitable [ in reference to ] recompense and requital, for 
reward follows on after service. 

The و of $  indicates, due the mystery of dissimilarity, that contrary 
to [ the assertions of ] the Mu‘tazilites, actions are not included in belief, and 
that belief without action is insufﬁcient. While the word  ْل َ(cid:175)َ(cid:150) signiﬁes that 
the thing about which good tidings are given resembles recompense [ though 
it is not ].

As  for  ﯗﮔاَ(cid:111)ِ(cid:170)ا َ

ّ(cid:135)(cid:170)َا  it  is  vague  and  concise.  According  to  Shaykh 
Muhammad ‘Abduh of Egypt, 1 it has a general meaning here because peo-
ple know perfectly well what good works are. But I say that in addition, it is 
thus since it looks to [ the details given ] at the start of the sura. 

1.  Muḥammad ‘Abduh ibn Ḥasan Khayrullāh ( 1849-1905 ). Graduated from al-Azhar 
University, and after coming under the inﬂuence of Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī began to work 
in the ﬁelds of k a l ā m , philosophy, and politics. Together they brought out the journal a l -
‘ U r w a   a l - Wu t h q ā  in Paris. In 1899 he was appointed Mufti of Egypt and he applied him-
self to reforming al-Azhar, notably by founding a faculty of modern science and updating 
the curricula. His works included Ta f s ī r   a l - Q u r ’ ā n   a l - Ḥ a k ī m  and R i s ā l a   a l - Ta w ḥ ī d .

220

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

The phrase , + * ) ( ' & 
Consider all the parts of this phrase: the conﬁrmative  & the specifying 
ل  of '  the  precedence  of   '  the  plural  “ g a r d e n s  (   ”  and  its  being 
indeﬁnite and the mention of the ﬂowing waters, the mention of *  and “  
+   – b e n e a t h , ” the specifying [ the plural ] of “ r i v e r s  ,  ” and its 
being deﬁnite; – like moisture trickling from all sides of the dry earth into a 
central pool, all these parts assist and respond to each other reinforcing the 
main aim, which is joy, pleasure, and requital. 

[ To explain: ] & indicates that since the mind might be hesitant about the 
stupendousness of the thing about which the good news is given, it needs to 
be corroborated. Also, it is characteristic of a context ( m a q ā m  ) [ inducing ] 
joy that it repels ungrounded fears, for the least anxiety shatters the imagin-
ing and chases away the joy. It is also a sign that this is not a mere promise 
but an actual reality.

The ل of  ' indicates particularity, ownership, and entitlement, [ mean-
ing  that  the  thing  about  which  good  news  is  given ]  is  exclusive  [ to  the 
believers ],  and  is  theirs,  and  that  they  are  deserving  of  it,  which  perfects 
[ their ] pleasure and augments [ their ] joy. Otherwise it would be like a king 
entertaining a pauper.

The precedence of ' indicates that among the people it is [ the believers ] 
who are singled out for Paradise. [ As a result ], they observe the situation 
of  the  people  of  Hell,  which  will  make  apparent  the  value  of  paradisical 
pleasure.

The plural of ( indicates the [ great ] number of gardens or paradises 
and  their  various  degrees  proportionate  to  the  [ many ]  various  degrees  of 
actions. It is a sign too that every part of Paradise is a paradise, and infers 
also that whatever portion is allotted to a person, with its great extent it will 
seem like the whole of Paradise; [ individuals ] will not be herded together 
with their group [ or community ] to a [ particular ] place. 

( being indeﬁnite reads out to the minds of listeners: “ [ The gardens ] 
contain  what  no  eye  has  seen,  nor  any  ear  heard,  nor  has  occurred  to  the 
heart of man. ” 1 It also refers it to the listeners’ minds so that they may all

conceive of it in a manner they ﬁnd pleasing. Furthermore, it is as though the 
indeﬁnite is a substitute for ( 43:71 ) μ ´ ³ ²

) : As is known, the most beautiful of gardens are those which have 
water; and the most beautiful of these are those in which the water is ﬂow-
ing; and the most beautiful of these are those in which the ﬂow of water is 
perpetual. Thus, the word ) conjures up the picture of continuously run-
ning water.

As for  + * you know that the most beautiful of running water is that 
which  ﬂows  through  plants  and  shrubs,  gushing  out  pure  and  clear  from 
the garden, and ﬂowing gurgling beneath its pavilions and in many rivulets 
among the trees. + * indicates these three [ that is, the waters ﬂowing 
beneath the gardens, the pavilions, and the trees ].

, : Running water in gardens is most beautiful if plentiful, and it 
is most pleasing if in the form of rivulets chasing each other, and if these are 
symmetrical they increase the charm and beauty of that part. But most beau-
tiful of all is when the water is deliciously sweet and cold, as in the verse: 
( 47:15 ) a ` _ The plural form and use of the deﬁnite indicate the above.
The sentence : 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 / . 
You  should  be  aware  that  the  parts  of  [ this  sentence ]  include  many 
implied  sentences  [ or  phrases ].  Since  it  is  not  tied  to  the  preceding  sen-
tence ( i s t ī n ā f  ), it is the answer to an implied question, and this question is 
a mixture of eight successive questions. For when given the good news of 
such  a  lofty  dwelling-place,  it  occurs  to  the  listener:  “ Will  there  be  food 
there or not? ” And if there is food, where will it come from and how will it 
be obtained? And if it is to be obtained from the garden, what does it con-
sist of? And if it is its fruits, do they resemble the fruit of this world? And 
if they do resemble it, do they resemble each other? And if those fruits do 
resemble each other, are their tastes different? And if they are different, will 
they diminish [ in number ] when picked or will they be replaced [ with new 
fruits ]? And if they are replaced by others, will these [ new fruits ] still be 
food? And if they are still food, will those who eat them feel delight? And if 
they do feel delight, what will they say? 

If  you  have  understood  these  questions,  consider  now  how  the  Qur’an 
replies to them with the parts of the [ above-mentioned ] section of the verse:

222

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

The word . indicates continuity and corroboration.
/  being  in  the  perfect  tense  indicates  its  realization.  Also,  it  infers 
their being reminded by something similar, of the food of this world. And its 
being in the passive mood indicates the absence of any difﬁculty [ in obtain-
ing it ] and their being served and its being given to them.

The choice of  2 1 0 rather than اَ(cid:183)ِ(cid:98)اَر َ(cid:175)َ(cid:102)  ْنِ(cid:174) is in order to give cer-

tain answers to two of the above-mentioned questions.

The indeﬁniteness of  2  makes it general and indicates that which-

ever of the fruits it is, it is sustenance.

And 3 being indeﬁnite indicates that it is not the sort of food that they 

know, which assuages hunger.

The word 5 has the meaning of “ they say to each other ” [ that is, the 
VIth form of the verb ], which signiﬁes their delight, wonder, and happiness.
The phrase : 9 8 7 6 : This being general [ and unspeciﬁc ] 

it comprises four meanings:

T h e  F i r s t :  “ What we are fed with here is the good works [ we performed ] 
in  the  [ last ]  world. ”  The  strong  tie  between  actions  and  requital  will  as 
though cause the [ good ] actions [ to be transformed ] in the hereafter into 
embodied rewards. And they rejoice at this.

T h e   S e c o n d :  “ We are fed here with the foods of the last world, but there 

is a vast difference between their tastes. ” And they feel wonder at this.

T h e   T h i r d :   “ This  resembles  what  we  ate  previously,  but  though  it  is 
similar in form it is different in meaning since it combines the pleasures of 
familiarity [ on the one hand ] and variation and change [ on the other ]. ” And 
they delight in this.

T h e   F o u r t h :   “ Whatever  we  eat  from  the  tree’s  branches  is  replaced 
instantaneously, as though with the one we had eaten. ” It is known from this 
that the [ fruits ] will never decrease.

Now the phrase > = < : This is a parenthetical clause conﬁrm-
ing and explaining the previous one, and is a summary and appendix of it.
The use of the passive mood in اوُ(cid:98)ُا indicates that they are served.
While > alludes to the combining of two pleasures as you already 

know.

VERSE 25 – EVERLASTING LIFE AND HAPPINESS

223

The phrase C B A @ : By virtue of the relationship between 
two sentences joined by a conjunction, the َو [ here ] indicates that just as they 
are in need of dwellings for their bodies, so are they need a means of rest and 
tranquillity for their spirits.

ْمـُ(cid:183)َ(cid:170) indicates particularity and possession, and specifying and restriction, 
and  infers  that  besides  their  wives  of  this  world  they  shall  have  ٌن(cid:193)ِ(cid:150) ٌروُ(cid:110) 
houris, created specially for them.

And A indicates that these wives will be worthy of Paradise and that 
their beauty will be proportionate to their elevated degree. Moreover, in this 
is a concealed sign that Paradise is adorned and decked out with them.

The  word C  indicates  that  someone  has  cleansed  and  puriﬁed 
them,  but  don’t  suppose  that  anyone  cleansed  by  the  hand  of  power  [ can 
be described ]! Its being a transitive verb [ the IInd form ] suggests that the 
women of this world are cleansed and puriﬁed so they become as beautiful 
as houris, who are of themselves pure.

And the phrase  G F E indicates that both themselves, and 

their wives, and the delights of Paradise, and all of Paradise, are eternal.

Consider this: There are three aspects to these verses also, that look to the 
composition [ and positioning and relationships ] ( n a ẓ m i y y a  ), and the mean-
ing of all them looks to both the preceding verses and the succeeding ones, 
and to the Qur’an as a whole.

Their positioning in respect of what follows them

You should be aware that when the Qur’an gives examples of gnats and 
spiders and speaks of ants and date-palms, the Jews, dissemblers, and idola-
tors see it as an opportunity to oppose [ it ], and ask foolishly: “ Does Allah 
the Most High – despite His sublimity – condescend to speak of such lowly 
matters, which the people of excellence disdain even to mention? ” So the 
Qur’an deals them a blow in the mouth with this verse.

Their positioning with regard to with what precedes them

With  its  miraculousness  and  inimitability  the  Qur’an  proves  [ Muham-
mad’s ( UWBP ) ] prophethood; and by challenging [ its opponents ] it proves 
its miraculousness and inimitability; and by their silence it proves [ the suc-
cess of ] its challenges; and it proves at the start of the sura that it possesses 
elevated  qualities  not  found  together  in  other  speech.  [ Thus  it  defeats  its 
opponents who ] remain silent in the face of its challenges, with not even 
their feelings of tribal solidarity being aroused. However, using false argu-
ments  they  object  to  one  [ aspect ]  of  the  Qur’an’s  perfection,  saying  that 
such parables as ( 2:17 ) % $ # " and ( 2:19 ) = < ; : are 

224

VERSE 26-27 – THE QUR’AN’S CHALLENGING ITS OPPONENTS

225

about commonplace matters and lower the level of the language putting it on 
a par with the conversation of ordinary people. So the Qur’an raps them on 
the head with this verse, dazing them.

An explanation of this: Their frail doubts arise from a string of delu-

sions, the source of which are a number of fallacies:

T h e   F i r s t  is a false analogy the source of which is their seeing everything 
in the mirror of what they are familiar with. For they see a person whose 
mind  is  partial,  whose  thought  is  partial,  whose  speech  is  partial,  whose 
hearing is partial, and who cannot attend to two matters at once, and they 
know that the criterion for his aspirations is the thing he is preoccupied with 
and attaches importance to. They consider that worth and greatness are pro-
portionate to ambition and cannot ascribe lowly, inferior matters to a lofty, 
august person, for they assume that he would not stoop to bothering himself 
with such things nor go to great lengths concerning paltry matters. With this 
false view they look to the Necessary One ( May He be exalted ) and say: 
“ How in His sublimity and glory does He condescend to speak with men 
and  converse  in  their  way  and  to  talk  of  triﬂing  matters,  especially  these 
contemptible things? ”

Do  these  foolish  people  not  understand  that  the  will,  knowledge,  and 
power  of  Allah  the  Most  High  are  universal,  general,  all-embracing,  and 
comprehensive, and that the only measure for His sublimity is His works 
in their totality, and that the only scale for His manifestations is His words 
which,  if  all  the  seas  were  ink  for  them,  would  never  be  exhausted.  For 
example, ( 16:60 )  j  i  h if the light of the sun – assuming it pos-
sessed will and intelligence – were to fall on a dusty atom, could you ask it: 
“ How with all your glory can you stoop to busy yourself with this atom? ”

Yes, just as Allah the Most High created the world and made it with the 
utmost art and perfection, going to great lengths with it, so too He creates 
the minutest particle and fashions it with the greatest precision and art. In the 
view of [ divine ] power, there is no difference between a minute particle and 
the planets, for the power, knowledge, will, and speech of the Most High are 
necessary inherent qualities. They are unchanging, and can neither increase 
nor decrease, nor have degrees, which would cause them to vary. For being 
the opposite [ of power ], impotence cannot intervene in it. There is therefore 
no difference [ for it ] between an atom and the sun. For contingent beings 
are equal in regard to existence and non-existence like some scales with two 
pans: if they hold two suns or two atoms, it takes no more power to raise one 

226

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

and lower the other. In just the same way, creatures are equal in the face of 
[ divine ] power, which is necessary and essential. So there can be no com-
parison between it and the power of contingent beings, which is accidental 
and varies on the intervention of impotence.

I n   S h o r t :  Minute particles and lowly matters are creatures of the Most 
High, and necessarily known by Him, so indisputably and self-evidently He 
will speak about them. It is due to this mystery that He says: 
( 67:14 ) 2 1 0 / . - , How should the One who knows [ them ] 
not mention them or speak of them, since He is the Mighty, the Wise?

The Second Fallacy

They claim that they see in the Qur’an’s style an efﬁgy of man behind 
the Speaker, by reason of its mentioning insigniﬁcant things and common-
place matters in the manner of human discussions. But do these people who 
close their eyes [ to the truth ] not know that speech looks to the speaker in 
[ only ] one respect, and to the one addressed in several, as is required by elo-
quence, which is [ to speak ] in accordance with [ the understanding ] of the 
one addressed. Thus, since the one addressed is man, and what is discussed 
is  his  circumstances,  and  the  aim  is  to  ensure  that  he  understands  it,  the 
Qur’an assumes the garb of human style, blended with human emotions and 
called ِرَ(cid:131)َ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا  ِلوُ(cid:163)ُ(cid:150) ىٰ(cid:170)ِإ ُةَ
ّ(cid:99)(cid:170)َا “ divine condescension to the minds of 
men, ” to put man’s mind at rest. You surely know that when you speak with 
a child, you have to speak in childish language.

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :   Their  insigniﬁcance,  lowliness,  ugliness  and  so  on 
are only in regard to their outer face ( m u l k  ) and the face that looks to us

However, the inner face of things ( m a l a k ū t i y y a t   a l - a s h y ā ’  ) is entirely trans-
lucent and exalted. This aspect is the locus of [ divine ] power, and there is 
nothing outside it. Thus, on the one hand, [ divine ] sublimity necessitates 
the placing of causes outwardly, and on the other unity and dignity demand 
that power and speech encompass all things. However, a Qur’an written in 
minute particles on an atom is no less eloquent than a Qur’an written in the 
ink of the stars on the page of the heavens. And the creation of a gnat is of 

VERSE 26-27 – THE QUR’AN’S CHALLENGING ITS OPPONENTS

227

no lesser art than the creation of an elephant. Thus, [ divine ] speech is the 
same as [ divine ] power.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  What then does the apparent insigniﬁcance refer to 

in these parables?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  It refers not to the one relating the parables but to the 
ones portrayed, and the closer the parables are to the things portrayed the 
better they are and the higher the level of speech and the more elevated the 
order of the eloquence. Surely you know that if a king gives his shepherd 
some  suitable  clothes  and  throws  a  dog  an  appetizing  bone,  and  so  on,  it 
cannot be said that what he has done is an innovation ( b i d ‘ a  ) [ that is, out of 
place ]; it would be said rather that he had done the best [ possible ] by giving 
each  what  was  appropriate.  So  however  insigniﬁcant  the  thing  portrayed, 
its representation is similarly insigniﬁcant, and however great it is, its rep-
resentation is thus. Since idols are the very least of things, Allah sets gnats 
to pester them. And since worship of them is the most worthless of things, 
Allah portrays it as a spider’s web.

The Third Fallacy

T h e y   a s k :  “ What need is there for such parables, which infer that [ the 

Qur’an ] is incapable of setting forth reality? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  Since the purpose of the Qur’an’s revelation is to guide the 
masses and they are ordinary people, and ordinary people cannot understand 
sheer truths and abstract ideas stripped of their imaginings, in His grace and 
beneﬁcence Allah the Most High clothed the truths in the garments of things 
familiar to them, to make them more palatable. You have seen this in the 
discussion about the allegorical verses [ in verse 23 ].

The positioning [ and relationships ] of the verses’ phrases

The  phrase T S R Q P O N M L K J  refutes 

and rejects [ their ] string of objections. It is as though they are asking: 

“ What is the reason ( ḥ i k m a  ) Allah the Most High speaks with men, and 
reproaches them and complains about them, for it is a sign that they too have 
the power to act in the world? – Especially if [ His speech ] resembles the 
conversations  people  hold  among  themselves,  doesn’t  it  infer  it  is  human 
speech?  And  especially  if  man’s  image  is  apparent  behind  the  speech? 
And  especially  if  [ He  speaks  in  the  form  of ]  allegories  and  parables,  for 
this infers the inability to depict reality? And especially if the parables are 

228

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

commonplace, for this is a sign that the speaker’s mind is limited? And espe-
cially if they [ depict ] triﬂing things, for this indicates the speaker’s frivol-
ity? And especially if they are things that do not have to be mentioned and it 
would be better to avoid? And especially if some are things self-respecting 
people would not stoop to speak of? And especially if the speaker is some-
one grand and important? So the Qur’an replies and demolishes this chain 
from beginning to end with a single blow. It declares: 
...M L K J 
For  the  inner  face  [ of  things ]  ( m a l a k ū t i y y a  )  is  not  contrary  to  His  gran-
deur and glory, and He neglects or omits nothing. Godhead necessitates this. 
Hence He portrays insigniﬁcant things [ to express ] insigniﬁcant meanings, 
for wisdom and true ( lit. the mystery of ) eloquence necessitate this. And 
hence  He  propounds  commonplace  parables  since  they  are  conducive  to 
education and guidance. And hence He depicts truths by means of parables 
since this is necessitated by divine grace and condescension. And hence He 
chooses to speak in the manner of human conversation since this is neces-
sitated by dominicality ( r u b ū b i y y a  ) and instruction. And hence He speaks 
with the people since this is demanded by wisdom and the order [ of things ].
I n   S h o r t :  When Allah the Most High deposited the faculty of will ( j u z ’ 
i k h t i y ā r ī  ) in man and made him the source ( m a ṣ d a r  – lit. verbal noun, inﬁni-
tive ) of the world of actions, He sent His word ( k a l ā m  ) in order to set that 
world in order.

The  positioning  [ with  respect  to  the  preceding  phrase ]  of  the  phrase 

] \ [ Z Y X W V 

With this phrase [ the Qur’an ] points out the way to prove the statement 
made by the previous one. It alludes too to the way to repulse ungrounded 
fears. That is, whoever looks with the light of belief, and from the point of 
view of Allah the Most High and His power, bearing in mind His wisdom, 
grace, and dominicality, will know that this is [ the parables are ] true and [ in 
conformity with ] eloquence. But the person who looks from the depths of 
his soul and from the point of view of contingent beings is bound to attract 
delusions. This resembles two people who went up hill and down dale till 
they encountered a number of streams. One of them continued uphill and 
came to the spring. He tasted the water and found it clear and fresh. [ He 
then descended and ] whenever he came across a small piece of water from 
the  tributaries  of  the  streams,  he  knew  it  to  be  good,  though  this  was  on 
the slightest evidence, and no delusions could mislead him however power-
ful. The other man, however, went downhill and sought the water from the 

VERSE 26-27 – THE QUR’AN’S CHALLENGING ITS OPPONENTS

229

tributaries.  He  did  not  [ climb  to  or ]  see  the  spring  and  therefore  needed 
strong evidence so as to know from the small amounts of water he encoun-
tered whether or not each bit was good. The least suspicion cast him into 
doubt. Or it resembles two people between whom is a mirror: one of them 
looks at the transparent glass, and the other at its coloured back. 

I n   S h o r t :  When observing the art of the Most High one has to look from 
His point of view ( m i n   j ā n i b i h i  ) and noticing His grace and dominicality. 
This  is  to  look  with  the  light  of  belief,  while  delusions  –  even  the  most 
powerful of them – become ﬂimsier than a spider’s web. But if one looks 
at [ divine art ] from the point of view of contingent beings, with the narrow 
view of a customer, frail delusions will grow powerful in his sight and the 
truth will be hidden from him, just like a gnat’s wing may prevent the eye 
seeing Mount Judi.

 
The positioning of the phrase a ` _ 
Having pointed out the way to understand the wisdom in the parables, 
( t a m t h ī l ā t  ) which is to look with the light of belief from the point of view 
of the Necessary Existent, it explains here the opposite way, which is the 
source of delusions and distractions. This is because it looks from the side 
of the soul, through the darkness of unbelief, which imagines everything to 
be dark, and with a sickness of the heart that causes even the slightest delu-
sion to become oppressive. Then [ such a person ] strays from the path of 
truth, then he vacillates, then he starts to ask questions, and then he denies. 
So concisely and allusively, indicating [ the disbelievers’ ] questioning that 
smacks  of  denial,  the  Qur’an  says, g f e d c  instead  of  ‘they 
do not know,’ although clearly this would have corresponded to [ the “ t h e y  
k n o w  ” in ] the previous phrase.

The positioning of the phrase n m l k j i 
This is the answer to [ the unbelievers’ ] question [ in the previous phrase ]. 
For to be exceedingly concise, it makes the result [ of the parable; that is, 
guidance and misguidance ] the ultimate reason for it ( a l - ‘ i l l a   a l - g h ā ’ i y y a  ), 
[ that is, guidance and misguidance are not the underlying reason for the par-
able; its purpose is to admonish and offer guidance to the people ] and they 
are asking: “ Why is it like that? Why isn’t its miraculousness obvious? Why 
doesn’t it have to be Allah’s word? Why does it provide the opportunity for 
doubts  and  delusion  through  these  parables? ”  So  the  Qur’an  [ dispels  all 
these questions ] saying: n m l k j i 

230

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

This is because [ the Qur’an ] increases in light those who ponder over 
[ the  parables ]  in  the  light  of  belief,  while  it  increases  in  darkness  those 
who ponder over them in the darkness of disbelief [ with a view to ] criti-
cizing them. And this is because [ the Qur’an ] is speculative ( n a ẓ a r ī  ) and 
not obvious ( b a d ī h ī  ). And this is so that elevated pure spirits may be dis-
tinguished from lowly turbid ones. And this is so that eminent dispositions 
may be differentiated through their progress from wicked ones. And this is 
so that sound natures may be picked out through their development, striving, 
and exertion from among corrupted rotten ones. And this necessitates man’s 
examination. And this requires his being tested and tried. And this demands 
his accountability due to the obligations laid on him ( a l - t a k l ī f  ), to perfect 
him and his happiness. How concisely the Qur’an replies! 

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  You say that the obligations laid on human beings 
and their accountability are to secure their happiness, but they are the reason 
for  most  of  them  being  wretched.  If  it  hadn’t  been  for  this  accountability 
there wouldn’t have been such an enormous difference between people?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Just as Allah the Most High entrusted man with the 
faculty of will ( a l - j u z ’  a l - i k h t i y ā r ī  ) and charged him ( al-taklīf ) through it 
( lit.  through  its  acquisition  –  b i - k a s b i h i  )  to  form  the  world  of  voluntary 
actions; so too He made this obligation the means of watering the unlimited 
seeds planted in the human spirit and their germination. If it were not for that 
obligation, those seeds would not sprout. If you study the history ( a ḥ w ā l  ) 
of  mankind  deeply,  you  will  see  that  all  advances  of  the  [ human ]  spirit, 
and divine perfecting of the conscience, and progress of the intellect, and 
the productive advances in thought which are so great as to be astounding, 
have occurred only due to man’s accountability, and [ those faculties ] being 
awakened by the sending of prophets, and the fecundation of religious laws, 
and the inspiration of the religions. Had it not been for them human beings 
would  have  remained  as  animals  and  those  perfections  of  the  conscience 
and moral virtues would have been non-existent. A minority accepted the 
responsibility  [ and  undertook  the  obligations ]  voluntarily  and  they  both 
won happiness for themselves and were the means of the happiness of the 
human race. As for the majority, quantitatively, even though they may have 
disbelieved in their hearts and in those areas in which they were free, since 
not every attitude and attribute of every disbeliever arises from his disbelief, 
because the prophets aroused the sensibilities of the human conscience and 
awakened its moral sense, the sacred laws [ they brought ] have been heeded 
and their works are known, [ and the majority ] has willy-nilly accepted some 
of the obligations [ with which man is charged ]. 

VERSE 26-27 – THE QUR’AN’S CHALLENGING ITS OPPONENTS

231

•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   s a y :  How can happiness for the few and wretchedness 
for the majority be happiness for the human race, that the Shari‘a may be 
a  mercy?  For  the  happiness  of  the  human  race  could  be  [ attained ]  only 
through [ the happiness ] of all or [ at least ] the majority.

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  If you have a hundred eggs and you put them under 
a hen, and twenty hatch and eighty do not, wouldn’t you say that you had 
brought the species up to full-strength? For twenty living chicks are equal 
to thousands of eggs. Or if you have a hundred date stones and you [ plant 
and ] water them, and twenty become towering date palms while eighty rot, 
wouldn’t you say that the water was happiness for the species? Or if you 
have some metal ore and you smelt it and one ﬁfth becomes gold and the rest 
turns to dross and ashes, isn’t the ﬁre the means of its perfection and excel-
lence  ( lit.  happiness )?  You  can  make  further  examples  in  the  same  way. 
Consequently,  it  is  only  through  striving  that  elevated  sensibilities  unfold 
and [ high ] morals develop, and it is only through the confrontation of oppo-
sites and competition that things are perfected. You surely know that if a 
government or state exerts itself its courage grows, but if it gives up striving 
its courage expires. [ That is, if it abandons  j i h ā d , it loses its courage and 
enterprise. ] Reﬂect on this! 

Now the positioning of the phrase t s r q p
Because  of  the  vagueness  of  the  [ previous ]  phrase, k j i 
this one alerts the listener’s mind, and perturbed, he asks: “ Who are these 
people  who  go  astray?  What  is  the  reason?  And  how  can  darkness  come 
from the light of the Qur’an? ” So [ the Qur’an ] answers: “ [ They go astray ] 
because they are depraved and have deviated from the right path ( a l - f ā s i q ū n  ). 
Misguidance is the penalty for their depravity. And because of it the light 
becomes ﬁre for them, and the brightness, darkness. ” You surely know that 
sunlight putreﬁes ﬁlth. 

[ Various ] aspects [ of sinfulness, depravity ( ﬁ s q  ) ] are described in [ the 

following verse ]: 

 ¢ ¡ ﮯ ~ } | { z y x w v
 § ¦ ¥ ¤ £

This  elucidates  and  spells  out  [ what ]  depravity  [ consists  of ],  for  it  is 
a renunciation of truth and to exceed the limits and quit the hard shell [ of 
right-guidance ]. It is either excess ( a l - i f r ā ṭ  ) or deﬁciency ( a l - t a f r ī ṭ  ) in the 

232

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

three powers of intellect, anger, and animal appetites. And excess and deﬁ-
ciency lead to rebellion in the face of the evidences that are like the divine 
covenants  ( a l - ‘ u h ū d  )  in  creation  ( a l - ﬁ ṭ r a  ).  They  also  lead  to  sickness  in 
personal life; the ﬁrst attribute [ in the above verse ] indicates this. So too 
they incite rebellion in the face of social life and break the bonds and laws 
of society. The second attribute indicates this. They also cause corruption 
and revolution, which spoil the order of the earth, as indicated by the third 
attribute.  Yes,  when  his  intellect  exceeds  the  bounds  of  moderation  the 
depraved person breaks the bonds of the tenets of belief and smashes their 
strong shell, that is, eternal life. And when his power of anger oversteps the 
mark  he  smashes  the  shell  of  social  life.  And  when  his  power  of  animal 
appetites exceeds the limits and he follows his desires, compassion for his 
fellow humans vanishes from his heart and he corrupts the people and makes 
difﬁculties for them in whatever he becomes involved in, and causes harm to 
the human race and spoils the order of the earth. 

The positioning of the phrase: « ª © 
Having  mentioned  the  crimes  of  the  depraved  and  scared  them,  [ the 
Qur’an ]  reinforces  its  threat  [ by  mentioning ]  their  ends  and  punishment, 
so  as  to  scare  them  more  effectively.  And  it  says:  “ They  make  a  loss  by 
trading the hereafter for this world and exchanging guidance for their own 
caprices. ”

Now let’s begin [ analyzing ] the positioning [ and relationships ] of 
the phrases’ parts

Consider this: The verses and their phrases and parts resemble the hands 
of a clock that show the seconds, the minutes, and the hours. If one proves 
one thing, another corroborates it to its own extent, and the other assists it as 
far as it can. Similarly, if this one wants something, that one helps, and the 
other aids it in such a way that it recalls the following lines:

 ُر(cid:193) ِ(cid:131)ُ(cid:192)  ِلا َ(cid:175)َ(cid:107)ْ(cid:170)ا  َكاَذ ىٰ(cid:170)ِا  ٌ

ّلﯭﯦَو  *  ٌد ِ(cid:110)اَو 
It is by virtue of this mystery that the Qur’an’s ﬂuency and its pre-eminent 
level and the ﬁneness of its embroideries reach the degree of miraculous-
ness.

َكُ(cid:179) ْ(cid:127)ُ(cid:110)َو ىَ

ّ(cid:99)َ(cid:130) اَ(cid:179)ُ(cid:98)اَراَ(cid:93)ِ(cid:150)

The parts of the phrase: 

T S R Q P O N M L K J

VERSE 26-27 – THE QUR’AN’S CHALLENGING ITS OPPONENTS

233

Consider this: The [ particle ] J is intensifying and [ its purpose is ] to 
dispel hesitation and rebut denial. It also indicates the succession of vacillat-
ing [ doubts ] mentioned previously.

The word K is [ used ] to alert [ the listener’s ] mind against the error of 

[ making the ] comparison mentioned above.

The  choice  of M L  rather  than  ‘does  not  desist  or  refrain  from,’ 
– although shame ( a l - ḥ a y ā ’  ), which is a retraction of the self, is impossible 
in reference to the Most High and it is futile to negate the impossible – indi-
cates that since such things as wisdom, eloquence and so on necessitate a 
ﬁne parable, there is no reason to refrain [ from propounding one ] except 
shame, and since shame is impossible for the Most High, there is absolutely 
no reason to refrain [ from propounding one ]. Thus, it silences [ the unbe-
lievers ] most effectively and subtly. Moreover, it alludes by means of [ the 
literary device by which similar forms express different meanings, called ] 
ِةَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:111) ُ
ِتاَرَ
ّبَر  ىِ(cid:193)ْ(cid:111)َ(cid:99) ْ(cid:127)َ(cid:192)  اَ(cid:174)َا  “ Isn’t  Muhammad’s  lord 
ashamed by these parables about triﬂing matters? ” [ That is, the Qur’an uses 
the expression they used in order to refute what they were saying. ] 

ّ(cid:135)(cid:170)ا ىِ(cid:158) ًةَ(cid:171)َ(cid:166)اَ(cid:131)ُ(cid:174) to the foolish words they were saying:
ّ(cid:163)َ(cid:111)ُ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)ا  ِه ِذٰ(cid:183)ِ(cid:92)   َلّ
ّ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ُ(cid:174)   ُ

ِ(cid:103) َ(cid:175)ُ(cid:192)  ْنَا   ٍد َ

The choice of O N rather than  ِر(cid:193)ِ(cid:163)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)ا  ِلـَ(cid:103) َ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)ا َنِ(cid:174) although the latter 
would have been more appropriate, indicates a stylistic subtlety which is that 
a parable resembles striking a seal in order to afﬁrm and authenticate [ some-
thing ], or minting a coin to set the value and credibility [ of money ]. And 
this suggests that ﬁne parables and comparisons repel doubts and suspicions. 
Similarly, it indicates that parables are a well-known and valued device, for 
propounding examples is an acknowledged method.

Furthermore, the choice of O N [ which is in the imperfect tense ] 
rather than [ the verbal noun ]  ٌبْرَ(cid:138) although this is more concise, is to indi-
cate that the source of [ the unbelievers’ ] objections is the triviality [ of the 
thing  represented  in  the  parables,  not  the  parables  themselves,  which  are 
useful. ] For being a verb, O N is not independent [ self-sufﬁcient ]; it 
seems  insubstantial,  so  the  mind  ( lit.  aim,  intention,  goal ]  passes  lightly 
onto the object. However, because [ the verbal noun ]  ٌبْرَ(cid:138) is independent, 
it is dense and impedes the mind. 

234

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

[ The  word ] P  alludes  to  the  particular  attribute  of  parabolic  com-
parisons ( a l - t a m t h ī l  ), which is to depict abstract things with concrete ones, 
and represent the imaginary with the real, and portray the hidden with the 
manifest. And this is a sign that they repel doubts and suspicions. 

The indeﬁniteness of P indicates that what is noteworthy is the par-
able itself, not the character [ it assumes through the thing it portrays ], which 
is related to what is demanded by the context ( a l - m a q ā m  ) or the situation of 
the thing it depicts. 

The generality of  Q   indicates that the rule [ of parables ] is a general one, 
so that the reply should not be [ considered ] particular to their objections; 
[ and  it  should  be  understood  that ]  the  thing  depicted  will  take  whatever 
form necessitated and deemed appropriate by [ the science of ] rhetoric ( elo-
quence – a l - b a l ā g h a  ). 

The  speciﬁc  [ mention  of ] R  looks  to  the  frequent  parabolic  use 
of them by the masters of eloquence ( a l - b u l a g h ā ’  ) in such expressions as: 
“ Smaller than a gnat. ” “ Stubborner than a gnat. ” “ He asked me for a gnat’s 
brain. ” “ Rarer than a gnat’s brain. ” “ The gnat told the bee: Hold on tight 
and I’ll ﬂy off! ” “ In Allah’s sight the world is not equal to a gnat’s wing. ” 
And so on. It also suggests the ﬂimsiness of their doubts.

The meaning of “ s o m e t h i n g   [   e v e n   ]   l e s s   t h a n   t h a t  ( lit. what is above, 
over, or more than ) T L  ” is what is smaller than it in size or what is of 
higher value according to eloquence, or what is lower in both value and size. 
Also, the phrase infers that small things are more remarkable in the view of 
eloquence, and more exquisite in [ their ] creation.

Consider this: The parts of these phrases are like silken threads which 

being brought together display a ﬁne embroidery.

Now the parts of the sentence 

 a ` _ ^ ] \ [ Z Y X W V
 g f e d c b
Consider this: The [ conjunction ] “ F a - – N o w  ” [ expresses ] the branch-
ing or ramiﬁcation ( a l - t a f r ī ‘  ) [ of this sentence from the previous one ], and 
this indicates an implied proof which yields this sentence with its two parts. 
That is, [ Allah ] does not refrain from [ propounding ] parables because elo-
quence requires them, and people who are fair-minded know that they are 
eloquent, true, and Allah’s word. While those who obstinately resist them 

VERSE 26-27 – THE QUR’AN’S CHALLENGING ITS OPPONENTS

235

do not know the wisdom [ in them ], so are hesitant and ask [ about them ], 
then deny [ them ], then they look on them as triﬂing. Consequently, since 
the believer is fair-minded he afﬁrms that the parable is Allah’s word, while 
because the disbeliever is obdurate, he asks: “ What’s the use of this? ” 

Since c expresses condition and consequence, [ here ] it indicates that 
the predicate [ Z Y is the necessary consequence of the sub-
ject X W that is, the predicate [ to know the truth ] is characteristic 
of the subject [ t h o s e   w h o   b e l i e v e  ]. 

The use of X W instead of ‘the believers’ is a clear indication 
that belief is the reason they know it is the truth, just as knowing it to be the 
truth is belief.

And the use of [ Z rather than ُغ(cid:193)ِ(cid:171)َ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا ُهَ

ّ(cid:178)َا although it would have been 
more apt in this context, alludes to the [ logical ] conclusion of their objec-
tions, for their purpose is to deny that [ the Qur’an ] is Allah’s word.

The restriction expressed by [ Z  [ that is, that being right is restricted 
to that parable ], is a sign that contrary to what they claim, it is [ only ] this 
[ parable of the gnat ] that is approved [ by the science of rhetoric ] and not 
found disagreeable. [ Accordingly, another metaphor would not be accept-
able  even  if  free  of  defect ],  for  freedom  from  defect  does  not  prove  the 
perfection [ of a thing ].

The phrase ] \ indicates that their aim and purpose is to deny [ that 

the parable ] is revealed [ by their Sustainer ].

The  [ conjunction ] c  in a ` _   signiﬁes  emphasis,  cor-

roboration, and particularization.

The substitution of a ` for ‘the disbelievers,’ although the lat-
ter is more concise, infers that their denial arises from disbelief and leads to 
it, as has been mentioned.

And b is used rather than ‘but they do not know,’ although as 
has been mentioned the latter is clearer, because to make allusion is more 
succinct;  that  is:  the  person  who  disbelieves  does  not  know  the  truth  and 
this causes him to waver, and this leads [ ﬁrstly ] to denial and then to asking 
disparaging questions.

236

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

Moreover, V  infers that just as they are themselves misguided, so 

with their words they lead others astray.

Now  [ the  positioning  and  relationships  of ]  the  parts  of  the  phrases 

n m l k j i 

Consider  this:  Here,  the  arrangement  ( a l - t a r t ī b  )  requires  that  the  sec-
ond [ phrase ] comes ﬁrst [ to correspond to the precedence of X W 
previously in the verse ], but since the aim is to refute the [ disbelievers’ ] 
vacillating, questioning, repugnant objections that smack of denial, i is 
of greater importance. 

The non-use of the verbal nouns ‘guidance’ and ‘misguidance’ and use of 
the imperfect tense of the verbs indicates that the darkness of their disbelief 
intensiﬁes proportionately to the gradual revelation [ of the Qur’an ], just as 
the believers’ faith increases proportionately in luminosity.

Moreover,  as  the  reply  [ to  their  question:  g f e d c  the 
verbal form suggests it is elucidating the situations of the two groups, and 
explaining [ the choice of ] the reasons [ for them ]. 

As for k  the ﬁrst, [ those who have gone astray ], expresses quan-
tity and number, while the second, [ the rightly-guided ], expresses quality 
and value. Yes, the generous and noble are numerous [ due to their high 
worth ] even if few [ in number ]. The second k is also an allusion 
to the mystery of the Qur’an’s being a mercy for humankind. Now dwell 
on this!

The phrase  t s r q p 
Consider  this:  By  explaining  here  who  the  misguided  are,  [ the  Qur’an ] 
allays the doubts, fear, and hesitation [ given rise to by ] the “ m a n y  ” above 
[ “ H e   c a u s e s   m a n y   t o   g o   a s t r a y  ” ], and rejects the accusation that the Qur’an 
is defective. [ It explains ] that the source of their misguidance is their deprav-
ity, and that the cause of it is what they have done ( k a s b u h u m  ), and that the 
faults are theirs not the Qur’an’s, and that the creation of misguidance is pun-
ishment for their actions. Understand too that each of these phrases elucidates 
the one preceding it, and is expounded by the one following it, as though each 
is proof of the preceding and the consequence of the succeeding.

This may be clariﬁed with two lines of reasoning:

VERSE 26-27 – THE QUR’AN’S CHALLENGING ITS OPPONENTS

237

T h e   ﬁ r s t   i s   t h i s :  [ Allah ] does not disdain ( lit. is not ashamed ) [ to pro-
pound the parable ], because He does not refrain [ from doing this ], because 
[ the parable ] is eloquent, because it is the truth, because it is the word of 
Allah, because the believer knows this.

T h e   s e c o n d   i s   t h i s :  [ Allah ] does not disdain [ to propound the parable ], 
as  the  deniers  say,  because  they  say  He  should  refrain  from  it,  because 
they do not know the wisdom in it, because they ask what use it is, because 
they deny it, because they deem it triﬂing, because they have fallen into 
misguidance through hearing it, because the Qur’an has led them astray, 
because in their wickedness they have exceeded the bounds, because they 
have broken Allah’s covenant, because they have sundered what He joined 
through His commands both in creation and in the Shari‘a, because they 
spoil the divine order of the earth, consequently they are the losers both 
in this world by reason of their pangs of conscience, anxious hearts, and 
desolate  spirits,  and  in  the  hereafter  due  to  the  everlasting  torments  and 
divine wrath that shall be visited on them. Ponder now over the ﬂuency of 
these two sequences!

Now the parts of the sentence

 ¢ ¡ ﮯ ~ } | { z y x w v

§ ¦ ¥ ¤ £
Consider  this:  There  is  an  elevated  subtlety  in  this  manner  of  describ-
ing here the depraved, who are doubtful about [ the Qur’an’s ] miraculous 
inimitability and composition. It is as though the Qur’an is saying: “ It’s not 
at all unlikely that the depraved should be doubtful and ignorant about the 
miraculousness  and  inimitability  of  the  Qur’an’s  order,  for  they  can’t  see 
the miraculousness of divine power in the order of the universe, which is the 
greater Qur’an. For they look on the the universe’s order as [ occurring ] by 
chance, and its fruitful changes as purposeless, so the instances of wisdom in 
it are concealed from them – since their spirits are corrupted. So too, because 
of their dissolute natures and their rotten folly, they consider the Qur’an’s 
miraculousness to be a confused muddle and its preliminaries sterile and its 
fruits bitter. ”

The phrase y x w  A high style is indicated here with the use of 
the word ‘a l - n a q ḍ ’, which means undoing the strands of a rope and break-
ing them, as though the covenant with the Most High were a luminous rope 

238

twisted with [ divine ] wisdom, grace, and will and stretching all the way 
from pre-eternity to post-eternity. It is manifested in the universe in the 
form of [ its ] general order, and has sent out chains to all the species and 
realms [ of beings ] and extended the tips of them to the human race. In 
the human spirit it has bequeathed the legacy of the seeds of [ its ] poten-
tialities and abilities, which are watered and made to thrive through the 
faculty of will, [ when ] regulated by the commands of the Shari‘a; that 
is, the evidences of the Qur’an and Sunna ( a l - d a l ā ’ i l   a l - n a q l i y y a  ). Thus, 
the covenant is fulﬁlled by employing those abilities as they should be, 
and it is broken by doing the opposite and undoing [ the rope and spoil-
ing the order ], like believing in some of the prophets and denying others, 
and accepting some precepts and rejecting others, and approving some 
verses and disapproving others. And this violates the order, arrangement, 
and regularity.

Now  the  phrase  ¤ £ ¢ ¡ ﮯ ~ }  :  Consider  this:  The 
command  here  embraces  legislative  ( t a s h r ī ‘ ī  )  commands  and  crea-
tional ( t a k w ī n ī  ) commands both of which are included within the natural 
laws  ( a l - q a w ā n ī n   a l - ﬁ ṭ r i y y a  )  and  the  laws  of  divine  practice  ( a l - ‘ ā d ā t  
a l - i l ā h i y y a  ). So sundering what the Shari‘a commands to be joined means 
breaking off family relations and severing the bonds between the hearts of 
believers. You can make further examples. And [ sundering what is joined 
by creational commands ] means cutting off actions from knowledge, and 
separating knowledge from intelligence, severing intelligence from innate 
abilities, and knowledge of Allah from reason, and labour from strength, 
and  j i h a d   from  courage,  and  so  on.  For  the  giving  of  strength  is  a  non-
material creational command ( a m r   m a ‘ n a w ī   t a k w ī n ī  ) to work, and the giv-
ing of intelligence is non-material creational command to learn. And so on.
The phrase § ¦ ¥ : Consider this: In accordance with [ the 
saying ]  “ the  more  general  the  calamities  the  pleasanter  they  become, ”  a 
person who becomes depraved and gets embroiled in the morass wants com-
panions  who  are  similarly  embroiled  so  as  to  alleviate  his  terrible  plight. 
Likewise, if [ the idea of ] revolution settles in someone’s heart, it will lead 
to  the  ruin  of  its  perfections  and  attainments  and  its  high  sentiments  will 
gradually decline, and the desire to destroy will born in it. This will make 
him feel a pleasure at destruction, and he will seek the pleasure by spreading 
corruption and fomenting revolution.

VERSE 26-27 – THE QUR’AN’S CHALLENGING ITS OPPONENTS

239

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  How can the whole earth, indicated by the word “ on 

earth, ” be affected by the corruption of one depraved person?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  That which has order has balance; in fact, the order 
is based on balance. If even an insigniﬁcant thing disturbs the workings of 
a machine, the machine is affected by it. And a pair of scales holding two 
mountains in its pans is affected if only a walnut is placed on one of them.

Now the phrase « ª © 
Consider this: This phrase should have been: “ they are the losers since 
[ they did not accept ] right-guidance through [ the Qur’an ]. ” [ It is expressed 

the way it is to make the following points, concerning: ] © and ª and 
the deﬁnite article of « and its generality:

The purpose of © is to conjure up the idea of something palpable 
or perceptible ( l i - i ḥ ḍ ā r   a l - m a ḥ s ū s  ) and this indicates that when the listener 
hears of their vile situation, it arouses his disgust and makes him angry at 
them. So he wants to picture them in his imagination in order to vent his 
anger and express his loathing, and to observe them as their terrible end is 
described.

The perceptibility indicates that their shameful attributes multiply to the 
extent they are embodied palpably in the disgusted person’s view. This also 
alludes to the reason for their loss.

The distance [ expressed by ©  ] indicates that they are too far from 
the way of truth to turn back, and therefore deserve to be censured and exe-
crated, contrarily to those who repent and are within easy reach of return. 

ª indicates that the loss is restricted to them, and that if the believers 
suffer the loss of some worldly pleasures it is not loss, and that compared 
with their loss, the loss of some worldly people in their businesses is not loss 
[ either ].

The deﬁnite article denotes [ speciﬁc ] facts and [ classes of things ]; that 
is, anyone who wants to see the truth about the losers should look at them. It 
is a sign too that their way [ results in ] pure loss, unlike other sorts of losses, 
which may contain aspects of gain; the harm is greater. For the deﬁnite arti-
cle is [ used ] for [ things that are ] either total or self-evident, or to depict a 
[ speciﬁc ] fact. 

240

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

The generality of the loss [ that is, its not being deﬁned ] indicates [ its 
comprehensiveness ];  that  is,  they  have  lost  by  not  remaining  faithful  to 
the covenant and breaching it; they have lost in [ connection with ] family 
relations by severing them, and in [ connection with ] reform by spreading 
corruption, and in [ connection with ] belief through disbelief, and in their 
wretchedness they have lost eternal happiness.

Verse 28 

 ´ ³ ² ± ° ¯ ® 

¼ » º ¹ ¸ ¶ μ

As in the previous verses, the positioning and composition of this verse 

has three aspects:

The positioning of this verse’s meaning in relation to
what precedes it

Consider this: Allah the Most High, having called on the people to wor-
ship Him and believe in Him, and having indicated the fundamental beliefs 
and the injunctions [ pertaining to action ] and having mentioned their evi-
dences summarily, resumes [ the discussion ] in this verse and the three sub-
sequent ones by setting out evidences for them and enumerating the bounties 
that the evidences comprise. The greatest of these bounties is life, indicated 
by this verse. The continuance of life ( a l - b a q ā ’  ), that is, life made perfect 
and complete through the ordering of the heavens and the earth, is indicated 
by the second verse. Man’s superiority and ennoblement over all beings is 
indicated by the third verse, and his being taught knowledge [ is stated ] by 
the fourth.

In respect of their form, these bounties are a proof of [ divine ] providence 
and purpose ( d a l ī l   a l - ‘ i n ā y a   w a ’ l - g h ā y a  ), so too they are proof of [ the obli-
gation of ] worship. For it is obligatory to thank the Bestower of Bounties, 
while  reasonably  ingratitude  is  proscribed  ( ḥ a r ā m  ).  In  respect  of  reality, 
[ these bounties ] are a proof that things are given existence out of nothing  
( d a l ī l   i k h t i r ā ‘ ī  ) [ and thus ] of the ﬁrst creation and the resurrection of the 
dead ( a l - m a b d a ’  w a ’ l - m a ‘ ā d  ). Furthermore, just as this verse looks to the 
preceding ones, so it looks to the earlier ones that discuss the disbelievers 
and dissemblers. It infers with its amazed rhetorical question that it is hitting 
them over the head, and condemning, threatening, and intimidating them.

241

242

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

The positioning [ and relationships ] of the verse’s phrases

Know that here, [ the Qur’an ] turns from the use of the third person [ in 
the  previous  verses ]  to  the  second  person,  for  previously  it  was  quoting 
[ the disbelievers ], now it is addressing them. This is to make a point well-
known in eloquence, which is that if one describes a person’s iniquities bit 
by bit, a feeling of anger mounts in [ the listener ] till if [ truly ] human he 
feels compels to speak with the person face to face. Similarly, if one men-
tions someone’s virtues little by little, the desire to speak with him grows 
[ gradually ] stronger till one turns to him and addresses him directly. 1 Thus, 
since the Qur’an was revealed in the styles and modes [ of speech ] of the 
Arabs, it turns to [ the disbelievers ] and addresses [ them directly ] saying: 
¯ ® ( lit. how can you disbelieve in Allah? ).

Know  too  that  since  the  aim  here  is  to  set  out  the  proofs  of  the  fun-
damental  matters  mentioned  above,  including  belief  and  worship,  and  to 
refute disbelief and prevent ingratitude for bounties; and since the clearest 
evidences are those derived from the chain of human circumstances, and the 
greatest bounties are those hanging on the stem of that sequence and found 
in its nodes; it says: 

¼ » º ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´ ³ ² ±
This  indicates  the  wondrous  interlinked  sequence,  which  has  ﬁve  nodes, 
from the stem of which hang the bunches of bounties. We shall now set out 
ﬁve matters to decipher those nodes.

T h e   F i r s t   M a t t e r  is about ² ± While physically man consists 
of  lifeless  particles  [ once ]  scattered  through  the  world,  you  see  that  they 
are brought under a particular law and speciﬁc order. Then, while they are 
hidden and silent in the world of the elements you notice that they are trans-
posed to the world of animate beings through a speciﬁc rule and order which 
betoken purpose and wisdom. Then, while scattered through that world, you 
observe that they group together in extraordinary fashion and become sperm. 
Then through a series of revolutions they become clinging blood-clots, then 
lumps of ﬂesh, then ﬂesh and bone, and so on and so forth. Although in each 
of these stages [ the particles ] are more perfect than in the previous one, they 
are relatively dead and lifeless compared to the subsequent one.

1.  This device called i l t i f ā t  is widely used in Arabic. See, page 27 fn 1 above.

VERSE 28 – THE GIVING OF LIFE AND DEATH

243

•  I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Death is the absence of life and its cessation, and 

[ the particles ] had no life that it should cease?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Death here is metaphorical, to prepare the mind to 

accept the third and fourth ‘nodes’.

T h e   S e c o n d   M a t t e r ,   concerning ³  Consider  this:  Life  is  the 
most wondrous and subtle miracle of [ divine ] power. It is also the greatest 
of all bounties and the clearest of all proofs of the ﬁrst creation and the resur-
rection of the dead ( a l - m a b d a ’  w a ’ l - m a ‘ ā d  ). 

[   L i f e ’s   ]   ﬁ n e s t   a n d   m o s t   o b s c u r e   a s p e c t   i s   t h i s :  The lowest form of life is 
plant life, and its ﬁrst level is the awakening of the embryo or vital cells ( a l -
‘ u q d a t   a l - ḥ a y ā t i y y a  )  in  the  seeds.  Despite  being  so  obvious,  widespread, 
and familiar, this awakening has remained a mystery to human science from 
the time of Adam till the present.

T h e   a s p e c t   o f   [   l i f e ’s   ]   b e i n g   t h e   s u p r e m e   b o u n t y :  The only relations a 
lifeless body has are with the place it is located and the things that befall 
it; it is single, alone, even if a mountain. But you see that the moment life 
enters a tiny body like a bee, the bee can form relations with the whole 
universe and may do trade with all species [ of beings ]. It may then say: 
“ The universe is my home and it’s just like my property. ” For on pass-
ing to the level of animal life, you see that it roams with its senses and by 
means of them has disposal over [ other beings ] in all parts of the universe. 
Particular  relations,  commerce,  and  love  are  established  between  it  and 
other species [ of beings ]. Especially if it rises to the level of human life, 
you see that it travels through the worlds through the light of intellect. It 
has disposal over the corporeal world and roams in the spiritual world and 
makes peregrinations through the World of Similitudes. And as it journeys 
to those worlds, so they travel to him by being reﬂected in the mirror of his 
spirit. He then has the right to say: “ The world was created for me through 
the grace of Allah the Most High! ” Thus, his life becomes multiform and 
expands [ to include ] physical life, and moral life, corporeal life, and spir-
itual life, each of which embraces many levels. In fact, it might well be 
said  that  just  as  light  makes  colours  and  bodies  visible,  so  life  reveals 
beings and makes them evident. It is life that makes an atom a world. And 
it is life that is the means of all the world being bestowed on every liv-
ing being individually, and this without confusion or division except for a 
small minority of human beings.

T h e   a s p e c t   o f   l i f e   t h a t   i s   t h e   c l e a r e s t   p r o o f   o f   b o t h   t h e   M a k e r   a n d   t h e  
r e s u r r e c t i o n   o f   t h e   d e a d . Consider this: The transference and spontaneous 
change of a number of lifeless particles from one situation and grouping to 
another opposing one without the intervention of any reasonable cause, is a 
decisive proof. Indeed, by its nature life is the purest and most sublime truth. 
In neither its outer ( a l - m u l k  ) aspect nor its inner ( a l - m a l a k ū t  ) aspect is there 
any soil or blemish, for both are subtle. In fact, the lowest most insigniﬁcant 
animate being is also exalted. It is due to this mystery that no apparent cause 
intervenes between life and the hand of power, for [ the latter’s ] contact is 
not contrary to its dignity, although as has been stated previously, apparent 
causes are [ otherwise ] placed to preserve the dignity of divine power from 
contact with things that to the superﬁcial view are inferior.

Yo u   h a v e   a l r e a d y   h e a r d   a b o u t   t h a t   a s p e c t   o f   l i f e   w h i c h   f o r m s   t h e   c l e a r e s t

j u s t   s u m m a r i z e   i t   f o r   y o u :   Whoever  studies  life  and  follows  the  progres-
sive elementary stages of the body, will see the parts dispersed through the 
world of atoms. Then he will observe that they have been clothed in another 
form in the world of the elements. Then he will encounter them in the world 
of animate beings in another situation. Then he will meet them in sperm, 
then  in  a  blood  clot,  then  as  a  lump  of  ﬂesh.  Then  he  will  see  that  they 
have  suddenly  assumed  a  form  in  the  midst  of  these  transformations.  He 
will observe that throughout these revolutions [ they follow ] regular motions 
according to speciﬁc laws, from which it is apparent that each particle was 
programmed at the ﬁrst stage and as though charged with the duty of travel-
ling to a suitable position in a living body. The person grasps with his mind 
that it is intentionally driven and purposively sent. Now the second life will 
appear to him far easier, simpler, and more possible [ than the ﬁrst ], and he 
will feel convinced in his heart. 

Thus, this phrase, ³ is a proof of the following one, ¶ μ 
and both together they form a proof in the face of the denial implied by ® 
[ in this verse, 2:28 ].

T h e   T h i r d   M a t t e r ,  regarding ¶ μ
Consider this: The verse ( 67:2 ) . - , shows that death is not 
annihilation  and  absolute  non-existence;  it  is  rather  an  act,  a  change  of 
abode,  and  the  spirit’s  liberation  from  its  place  of  conﬁnement.  Moreo-
ver,  the  innumerable  signs  and  tokens  human  beings  have  witnessed  up 

VERSE 28 – THE GIVING OF LIFE AND DEATH

245

to the present have planted in their minds the conviction and surmise that 
after death man is immortal in one respect, and what has immortality is 
his  spirit.  Thus,  the  existence  of  this  inherent  property  in  an  individual 
is evidence of its existence in the race as a whole, because it is essential. 
Consequently [ in accordance with the rule of logic ], the particular propo-
sition necessitates the universal one. Hence, death is a miracle of [ divine ] 
power the same as life is; it is not non-existence caused by the absence of 
the conditions of life. 

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  How can death be a bounty, threaded [ with others ] 

on the string of bounties?
You would be told: 
F i r s t l y :  Because it is the introduction to everlasting happiness, and the 
introduction to something is like the thing itself, whether good or bad, for 
whatever the obligatory depends on is obligatory, and whatever leads to the 
proscribed is proscribed.

S e c o n d l y :   And  because  according  to  investigative  scholars  among  the 
Suﬁs, for the individual person it means being saved from what seems to be 
a prison ﬁlled with vicious animals and [ being taken to ] a broad plain.

T h i r d l y :  And because for human beings it is the supreme bounty, for they 

would otherwise suffer appalling wretchedness.

F o u r t h l y :   And  because  according  to  some  people  it  is  a  sought-after 
bounty, for due to his weakness and impotence [ man ] cannot bear the bur-
densome responsibilities of life and the pressures of its tribulations and the 
pitilessness of the elements. Death for such people is a door [ through which 
they may ] escape.

T h e   F o u r t h   M a t t e r ,  regarding ¹ ¸
Consider this: As indicated by the verse ( 40:11 ) W V U T 
and as is indicated by [ the above phrase ] being followed by ¼ » º 
bearing in mind the Qur’an’s conciseness, [ it may be said that these ] point 
to both the life of the grave, and [ the resurrected ] life at the resurrection of 
the dead. 

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  If a person is incinerated and his ashes are thrown to 

the wind, how could he be thought to experience the life of the grave?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  According to the Sunnis, the body is not a condition 

of life, so the spirit may be attached to a few particles.

246

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

• A n d   i f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  How can one conceive of the torments of the 
grave, for if one placed an egg on the chest of a corpse and left it there for 
days, not the slightest movement would be felt in it. So how could there be 
life and torment?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  The World of Similitudes ( a l - ‘ ā l a m   a l - m i t h ā l ī  ) has 
proved it, in the relevant places; indeed, its existence is certain according 
to  the  punctilious  divine  scholars.  That  world  [ of  Similitudes ]  is  charac-
terized by its embodying meanings, transforming accidents into substance, 
and  making  mutable  things  immutable.  The  eyes  that  look  to  it  from  this 
manifest world are true dreams, true illuminations ( k a s h f  ), and wraith-like 
bodies, for these all intimate its existence. The Intermediate Realm ( ‘ ā l a m  
a l - b a r z a k h  ) is a ﬁrmer reality than the World of Similitudes, which is its 
image or exempliﬁcation. While the World of Dreams is the shadow of the 
latter [ intermediate ] world, and the World of Imagination is the shadow of 
the World of Dreams. These bodies are as transparent as mirrors.

Now, if you have understood this, consider the World of Dreams and 
think of a person who is sleeping near you. He is resting peacefully and 
silently, but in his world he is ﬁghting and being wounded by the blows he 
receives, or is bitten by a snake and he suffers pain at this. If it were pos-
sible for you to enter his dream, you would say to him: “ Hey! Don’t feel 
hopeless and angry! This isn’t real [ it’s a dream ]! ” You would swear it a 
thousand times but he would not believe you, and would say: “ Can’t you 
see that I’ve been wounded and the pain I’m suffering? Can’t you see the 
man and his sword and the snake that’s hissing at me? ” For the signiﬁca-
tions of his painful shoulder or cold in his head had been embodied as a 
cutting sword, for the result was the same. Or he imagined in the form of a 
snake what a betrayal that had wounded his heart had signiﬁed for him, for 
the pain was the same. Friend! Now that you have seen this in the shadow 
of the World of Similitudes, [ the World of Dreams, ] wouldn’t you accept 
it in the Intermediate Realm, the reality of which is far ﬁrmer and more 
distant from us? 

¹ in regard to the life of the hereafter: the life of the hereafter is the 
outcome of all the world. If it were not for that life, there would be no ﬁxed 
and constant reality, and all truths – such as bounties – would be transformed 
into  calamities.  You  can  think  of  further  examples  in  the  same  way.  We 
summarized its proofs when expounding ( 2:5 ) A @ ?

VERSE 28 – THE GIVING OF LIFE AND DEATH

247

T h e  F i f t h  M a t t e r ,  regarding ¼ » º This is the ﬁnal node in this 

sequence, so consider the following: 

The Creator manifested His power, combining opposites in this world of 
change ( ‘ ā l a m   a l - k a w n   w a ’ l - f a s ā d  ) for [ many ] subtle instances of wisdom, 
and  He  placed  apparent  causes  and  intermediaries  to  display  His  dignity, 
and determined the chains of cause and effect. Then, at the resurrection of 
the dead when the universe is puriﬁed and [ opposites ] are separated out and 
join forces, causes will be removed and intermediaries will fall away and the 
veil shall be raised, and each person will see his Maker and recognize his 
true Owner.

An Appendix Summarizing the Positioning of the Phrases

Consider  this:  Having  rebutted  the  disbelief  implied  by  the  rhetorical 
question ®  and  having  prompted  the  peoples’s  amazement  at  it,  the 
Most High offers [ them ] proof with what follows the circumstantial “ a n d  ” 
( a l - w ā w   a l - ḥ ā l i y y a  ); that is, the four mighty transformations, all of which 
and  each  of  which  testify  to  the  necessity  of  belief.  Each  transformation 
comprises  numerous  stages  and  degrees,  and  each  is  the  preliminary  and 
‘stomach’ of the one that follows it. From the ﬁrst stage of the ﬁrst transfor-
mation till the last stage of the last transformation the fundament of the liv-
ing body is constantly renewed. It casts away one shell and is clothed in one 
more perfect, then it discards that and is dressed in one ﬁner, then it throws 
that away and puts on a better form, and so on and so forth. It continuously 
swaps its form for one more perfect till it reaches the acme of perfection and 
there it comes to rest on the establishment of eternal happiness. And all this 
is in accordance with a speciﬁed order and regular laws.

With ² ±  it  indicates  the  ﬁrst  transformation,  which  com-
prises [ numerous ] stages the last of which leads to ³ which points 
to the second transformation, which is the most wondrous of the truths of the 
world. It too comprises many stages the last of which concludes in the trans-

formation of ¶ μ which also has many stages pertaining to the Inter-
mediate  Realm.  This  ﬁnishes  in  the  transformation  of ¹ ¸  which 
comprises many stages pertaining to the grave and then to the resurrection 
of the dead, and is concluded with [ the truth of ] ¼ » º How can 

248

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

anyone who studies these transformations attentively be so audacious as to 
deny [ them ]?

Now we commence with the positioning [ and relationships ] of the 
constituents of the phrases

The ﬁrst phrase, that is, ² ± ° ¯ ®
The interrogative form is [ used ] here to call attention to [ the disbeliev-
ers’ ] error so that they might see it themselves and come to think fairly and 
acknowledge [ Allah ].

®  infers  through  the  denial  of  the  circumstantial  sentence  necessi-

tated by ® that their disbelief is [ in reality ] non-existence. 

The use of the second person in ¯ indicates, as was discussed 
above,  [ Allah’s ]  intense  anger  [ at  them ],  and  the  non-use  of  َنوُ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174)ْؤُ(cid:98)   َ(cid:202) 
instead of ¯ indicates their extreme obduracy, for they hold back 
from belief, for which there are evidences, and accept disbelief for the futil-
ity of which there are manifold proofs.

The circumstantial [ conjunction ] ( و ) ( a l - w ā w   a l - ḥ ā l ī y y a  ) in ±  
implies an unstated phrase. [ The conjunction indicates that ² ±

Whereas there are four phrases here, two of which refer to the past ( are in

the circumstantial “ a n d  ” implies an unstated sentence or phrase ], which is: 
“ seeing that ( lit. and ) you know that you were lifeless ( lit. dead ). ” [ In this

that they will return to Allah the Most High?

Yo u  w o u l d  b e  t o l d :  It is a rule of eloquence to accord the ignorant man the

stages of the ﬁrst death and ﬁrst life compels one to acknowledge the Maker 
and knowledge of them convinces one intellectually about the second life, 
[ the disbelievers ] as though had knowledge of that sequence [ of events ]. 

The use of the second person in  ْمـُ(cid:99)ْ(cid:179)ُ(cid:166) indicates that they had a speciﬁc 
existence in the world of minute particles too. The particles did not come 
together haphazardly and become a particular body by chance.

And  the  choice  of ²  rather  than  ‘lifeless,  inanimate  ( j a m ā d ā t  )’  or 

‘particles’ alludes to the meaning of the verse 

( 76:1 ) ¸  ¶  μ  ´

Now the phrase:  ³
• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  The conjunction ( ف ) denotes succession and contact 
[ that is, there should be no ‘distance’ between what precedes and succeeds 
it ], but doesn’t it interrupt the stages and isn’t there a long interval between 
death or lifeless beings and life?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e  

t o l d :   The  ( ف )  indicates  the  source  of  the  proof  of  the 
Maker,  and  that  is  the  transformation  of  particles  spontaneously  from  an 
inanimate to an animate state without the intervention of a reasonable cause, 
which compels the mind to acknowledge the Maker. Moreover, the stages 
in the conditions of inanimate beings are defective and inconstant, and are 
characterized by [ swift ] succession.

And the choice of   ْمُ(cid:166)اَ(cid:193)ْ(cid:110)َأ rather than ‘( lit. ) you became alive’ ًءاَ(cid:193)ْ(cid:110)َا ْمُ(cid:98)ْر ِ(cid:134) 
is  for  clariﬁcation;  that  is,  “ you  became  alive  and  this  was  possible  only 
through the Maker’s power. It has to be concluded therefore that it is Allah 
the Most High who gives life. ” 

Then the substitution of  ¶ μ for ‘you will die’ َنوُ(cid:98)وُ(cid:175)َ(cid:98) indicates, 
as has been mentioned, that death is a vast act of [ divine ] power in accord-
ance with the measuring of divine determining ( q a d a r  ). You have surely 
noticed that it is only a tiny minority who live out their full natural span. 
This makes one realize that death is not a natural consequence. It is the dis-
solution of the body, not the extinction of the spirit; it is indeed, the libera-
tion of the spirit. 

In the phrase ¹ ¸ , ¸  indicates the intervention of the Interme-

diate Realm with its strange wonders.

out  intermediary,  but  [ its ]  continuance  is  encompassed  by  composition 
and  decomposition,  and  the  disposal  of  power  and  change,  and  for  the 
instances of wisdom mentioned above causes intervene [ in it ]. But in the 
hereafter both existence and [ its ] continuance will appear [ directly ] from 
the hand of power with all their necessities and compositions, and every-
thing will know its True Owner. If you think about this, you will under-
stand the meaning of “ r e t u r n . ”

This verse too has three important facets. 

The positioning of the verse as a whole in relation to the previous 
verse

In the previous verse disbelief and ingratitude were disproved by means 
of evidences pertaining to man’s self ( a l - d a l ā ’ i l   a l - a n f u s i y y a  ) and these 
were the stages of human [ development ], and now this verse points out 
evidences in the outside world ( a l - d a l ā ’ i l   a l - ā f ā q i y y a  ). Similarly, the pre-
vious verse indicated the bounties of existence and life, while this verse 
indicates  the  bounty  of  permanent  existence  ( a l - b a q ā ’  ).  Again,  in  the 
previous  one  there  was  proof  of  the  Maker  and  matters  preliminary  to 
the resurrection of the dead, while this verse indicates the realization of 
the resurrection and the dispelling of doubts, as though [ the disbelievers ] 
were asking: “ Where does it come from, this value man has? Why does he 
have such importance? And what is his position in Allah’s sight that He 
should bring about the resurrection of the dead on account of him? ” So the 
Qur’an replies through the indications of this verse: “ Man has high value 
as  is  evidenced  by  the  heavens  and  earth  being  subjugated  [ to  him ]  for 
his use. He also has vast importance as is evidenced by the fact that Allah 
did not create him for creation, but created creation for him. He also has a 
[ high ] place in Allah’s sight as is evidenced by the fact that Allah did not 
give existence to the world for itself, but for man, and He gave man exist-
ence that he might worship Him. It is to be concluded from this that man 
is superior and pre-eminent and not like the animals, and that he is worthy 
of receiving the jewel of  ¼ » º

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

The positioning of the verse’s phrases

Consider this: The word Å in the ﬁrst phrase, the word Æ in the 
second, and Ë in the third all require investigation. We shall discuss them 
in three matters:

The First Matter

I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  This verse indicates that everything on the earth is 
for man’s use, but how can one conceive of Zayd for example making use 
of every part of the earth? And how could Habib and ‘Ali derive beneﬁt 
from  a  stone  at  the  foot  of  a  mountain  in  the  middle  of  an  island  in  the 
Paciﬁc Ocean? And how can ‘Amr utilize Zayd’s property? But this verse 
and  others  like  it  suggest  that  all  of  it  is  for  each  person  without  being 
divided up. Moreover, how with their vastness can the sun and moon and 
so on be for Zayd and ‘Amr and their main purpose be their tiny beneﬁts? 
And how can harmful things be useful for human beings? For there is noth-
ing vague or inaccurate in the Qur’an and exaggeration is not in keeping 
with true eloquence?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Consider the following six points, which will put such 

doubts to ﬂight:

The First: As has been mentioned, it is characteristic of life that it makes 
the particular universal, and the part into a whole, the single into a collectiv-
ity, and the restricted absolute, and the individual into a world. Thus, each 
member of all the species becomes like a living race or people and the world 
becomes its house, and it comes to have relations with all things.

The  Second:  As  you  know,  there  are  in  the  world  a  ﬁxed  order,  and 
ﬁrm arrangement, and elevated principles, and constant fundamental laws, 
making it like a clock or machine. And just as each cog-wheel, indeed each 
tooth of each cog, and even every part of each tooth, plays a part however 
minor in the working order of the machine, so too through the workings of 
the machine it has an effect on the machine’s utility and its production. In 
the same way, through its existence [ every being ] is in some way useful for 
living beings, the chief and leader of which is the human race.

The Third: As has reached your ears in previous discussions, no [ being ] 
obstructs [ other beings ] in regard to beneﬁting [ from things ]. For just as the  
sun in its entirety is Zayd’s and its light is his place of relaxation and prom-
enading, so in its entirety is it ‘Amr’s and a garden for him. If for example 
Zayd were all alone in the world, he would beneﬁt from it no more than if 

VERSE 29 – THE EARTH’S CREATION FOR HUMANKIND

253

he were together with all the world’s people – with the exception of that part 
that looks to ‘the two caves,’ [ like food, for these might be the object of 
scrummaging and obstruction ].

The  Fourth:  The  universe  does  not  have  only  one  ﬁne  facet;  it  has 
layer upon layer of different, general facets the beneﬁts of which [ also ] 
have numerous general and interconnected facets. And the ways of utiliz-
ing them are numerous and various. For example, if you have a garden, 
you beneﬁt from it in one way and the people beneﬁt in another, by receiv-
ing pleasure from it through the faculty of sight for instance. For of course 
man  derives  beneﬁt  through  his  ﬁve  external  senses,  his  inner  faculties, 
and his body and spirit, and also by means of his intellect and heart, in his 
life both in this world and in the hereafter, and from the point of view of 
taking lessons; you can think of further examples in the same way. There 
is nothing preventing him utilizing any of these facets of anything on the 
earth, or even in the world.

The Fifth:
• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  The verses here and others in other places indicate 
that this vast world was created for human beings and that their utilization 
of it is the ultimate aim of its creation. However, the planet Saturn, which is 
larger than the earth, is not proportionately more beneﬁcial for man; it is just 
a sort of adornment and pale light. So how could this be an ultimate reason 
[ for its creation ]?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  A person who proﬁts [ from a thing ] loses himself in 
the facet of it that he utilizes, he focuses his mind on it and forgets everything 
else, and he looks at everything else from his own point of view. Also, [ in 
his view ] the aims and purpose of a thing are conﬁned to the facet that looks 
to himself. Hence there is nothing exaggerated or inaccurate if in the context 
of  gracious  bestowal  it  is  said  in  connection  with  that  person:  “ Although 
Saturn’s  Creator  gave  it  existence  for  thousands  of  instances  of  wisdom, 
each of which has thousands of facets, and every facet can be beneﬁted from 
in thousands of ways, He created it for that person to beneﬁt from. ”

The Sixth: 

ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَ

ْ(cid:202)ا ُمَ(cid:170)اَ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)ا ىَوَ(cid:143)ْ(cid:178)ا 

َك(cid:193)ِ(cid:158)َو  *  ٌر(cid:193)ِ(cid:155) َ(cid:134) ٌمْر ِ(cid:106) 

َكَ

ّ(cid:178)َا ُمُ(cid:150)ْزَ(cid:98)َو

As you noted earlier, for sure man is small but [ in meaning ] he is great, 
hence for him some minor, particular beneﬁt becomes universal and great. 
So there is nothing futile and useless.

254

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

The Second Matter concerns Æ

This verse indicates that the earth was created before the heavens, while 
the verse  ( 79:30 ) n m l k shows that the heavens were created 
before the earth. Then the verse ( 21:30 ) l k j indicates that 
they were created together and then split apart as ( lit. from ) the same matter. 
Understand secondly that the teachings ( n a q l i y ā t  ) of the Shari‘a suggest 
that Allah the Most High created ﬁrstly a substance, that is, matter, then He 
manifested [ His power ] on it and made a part of it steam and a part ﬂuid. 
Then through his manifestation the ﬂuid part thickened and became froth. 
Out of this He created the earth or the seven globes of the earths. Then a sky 
was  formed  for  each  of  these  earths  out  of  the  wafting  atmosphere.  Then 
He expanded the steamy matter and arranged the [ seven ] heavens out of it, 
planting the stars in them. So the heavens took form containing the nuclei 
of the stars. 

According to the assumptions and theories of modern science, the solar 
system, together with the heavens in which it ﬂoats, were a simple substance 
which was transformed into a sort of steam. Out of this, some ﬁery liques-
cent matter was formed, part of which cooled down and solidiﬁed. Then due 
to its motion the liquescent matter threw off [ into space ] sparks and pieces 
which broke up. These became compressed and turned into the planets, one 
of which is our earth. 

If you have understood this, you may correlate these two explanations, 
for it is possible that the verse  ( 21:30 ) l k j indicates that 
the  earth  and  the  solar  system  were  a  sort  of  dough  kneaded  by  the  hand 
of  power  out  of  a  simple  substance;  I  mean  ether,  which  compared  with 
beings is a ﬂuid substance that passes through and among them. The verse 
( 11:7 ) ? > = <  alludes  to  this  matter,  which  resembles 
water.

After its creation, the ether received the Maker’s ﬁrst manifestation giv-
ing existence; that is, He created the ether, then He made it into the funda-
mental atoms ( j a w ā h i r   f a r d a  ), then some of these He made dense and out 
of them created the seven globes, of which our earth is inhabited. Then the 
earth solidiﬁed before all the rest, speedily forming a crust, and over a long 
period  of  time  became  the  source  of  life  while  up  to  the  present  most  of 
the heavenly bodies remained in a ﬁery ﬂuid state. In so far as this was the 
case its creation and formation was before that of the heavens. And since its 

VERSE 29 – THE EARTH’S CREATION FOR HUMANKIND

255

uses and beneﬁts and its being “ spread out ” – that is, arranged and set in 
order – were completed after the arrangement and ordering of the heavens, 
the heavens were previous in this respect, although [ the heavens and earth ] 
were together at the beginning. Thus, the three verses look to the three points 
[ solving the apparent contradictions ]. 

A   s e c o n d   a n s w e r :  The Qur’an’s aim is not to teach the history of crea-
tion; it was revealed to teach knowledge of the Maker, and so contains dif-
ferent levels ( m a q ā m ā t  ). When describing the [ divine ] bounties, favours, 
and mercy and the clarity of the evidences, the earth comes ﬁrst. But on the 
level of the proofs of [ divine ] grandeur, sublimity, and power, the heavens 
precede. 

Æ : this may refer to ‘a being protracted’ or procrastination ( t a r ā k h ī  ). 
This may be essential ( d h ā t ī  ), and may also pertain to degree ( r u t b ī  ) [ or to 
reﬂection ( t a f a k k u r ī  ) ]. Thus Ç Æ  implies the unstated words “ Then  
اوُرَ
ّ(cid:167) َ(cid:159)َ(cid:98)َو اوُ(cid:175)َ(cid:171)ْ(cid:150)ِا  [ how ]  He  applied  His  design  to  the  heavens  ... ”  [ That  is, 
the creation of the heavens was ﬁrst in time but in respect of reﬂection and 
thought it is in second place; and the creation of the earth was after that of 
the heavens but in regard to reﬂective thought it comes ﬁrst. ] 1
The Third Matter, regarding Ë

Consider this: Ancient philosophy asserted that the heavens were nine-
fold, and its proponents conceived of it in an extraordinary form. Their ideas 
dominated mankind for centuries. In fact, very many Qur’anic commentators 
were forced to bend the literal meanings of verses to [ conform with ] with 
their school. Modern science, however, asserts that the stars are suspended 
in space or in the void, as though it denies the existence of the heavens. That 
is to say, one went to one extreme and the other went to the other. As for the 
Shari‘a, it states that the Maker ( May His glory be exalted ) created seven 
heavens and placed the stars in them like ﬁsh swimming [ in the sea ]. The 
Hadith  ٌفوُ(cid:159)ْ(cid:167)َ(cid:174)  ٌجْوَ(cid:174) “ The heavens are a wave held back ”  2 alludes to this. 
This school [ of thought ] may be veriﬁed on six levels:

T h e   F i r s t :  It has been established by science and philosophy that endless 

space is ﬁlled with ether.

1.  See, İ ş â r â t ü ’ l - İ ’ c a z  [ Abdülmecid ], 265.
2.  M u s n a d , ii, 370; al-Ti r m i d h ī , Sūra al-Ḥadīd, 1 ( no: 3298 ). For further details see, 

I s h ā r ā t   a l - I ‘ j ā z  [ Iḥsān Qāsim ], 226.

256

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

T h e   S e c o n d :  What binds the laws of the lofty bodies and transmits and 
spreads such forces as light and heat is a matter that is existent in space and 
ﬁlls it.

T h e  T h i r d :  Although the matter [ called ] ether remains as ether, like other 
matter it has various different changeable states, like steam, water, and ice 
are formed of water. 

T h e   F o u r t h :  If the heavenly bodies are observed carefully, there appear 
to be different levels. You have surely seen the river of the heavens known 
as the Milky Way, which appears as a great splash of clouds; it consists of 
millions  of  stars  that  are  being  newly  formed  and  are  clustering  together. 
And the ether, in which those stars are clustering, is of course different to the 
level of the ﬁxed stars, and one surmises correctly that this too is different to 
the levels of the solar system, and so on, till there are seven levels.

T h e   F i f t h :  It is established by both induction and intuition that when mat-
ter is subject to both formation, ordering, and arrangement, it gives rise to 
different  states  ( lit.  levels ).  From  carbon  ( lit.  mineral  –  m a ‘ d a n  )  is  pro-
duced  ashes,  coal,  and  diamonds;  and  ﬁre  may  be  separated  into  embers, 
ﬂames, and smoke; and from the combining of oxygen and hydrogen water, 
ice, and steam are produced.

T h e   S i x t h :  The above are all indications that the heavens are manifold. 
And  the  truthful  lawgiver  ( a l - s h ā r i ‘   a l - ṣ ā d i q  )  said  they  were  seven.  And 
they are seven in the sense that in the Arabic language, seven, seventy, and 
seven hundred all denote multiplicity.

I n   S h o r t :  The Maker ( May His glory be exalted ) created from the matter 
[ called ] ether seven heavens and arranged them giving them a wondrously 
ﬁne order, and He planted the stars in them, and their layers are various.

Now  consider  this:  If  you  ponder  over  the  Qur’an’s  addresses  and  its 
meanings and its taking into consideration the understanding of all classes 
[ of people ] from the lowest to the highest of the elite, you will observe an 
extraordinary matter. For example, from Ì Ë some people under-
stand the levels of the atmosphere ( a l - h a w ā ’  a l - n a s ī m ī  ); and some under-
stand the wafting spheres that encircle our earth and its fellows which sus-
tain living beings; others understand the seven planets visible to everyone; 
others  understand  the  seven  etherial  layers  in  the  solar  system;  yet  others 
understand  seven  solar  systems  the  ﬁrst  of  which  is  our’s;  others  under-
stand the ether giving rise to the formation of seven levels [ or states ] as was 
discussed above; then some consider that all that is visible of the adorning 

VERSE 29 – THE EARTH’S CREATION FOR HUMANKIND

257

lamps  of  the  suns  and  ﬁxed  stars  is  a  single  heaven.  They  form  the  skies 
of this world, above which are six more invisible heavens. And yet others 
surmise that the seven heavens are not restricted to the Manifest World, and 
they conceive of them as levels of creation in this world, the hereafter, and 
the Unseen and their worlds. All of these [ classes of people ] proﬁt from the 
Qur’an’s abundant blessings in accordance with their capacities and receive 
their shares from its table, which encompasses all these understandings.

Now consider the ﬁve aspects of the positioning of the verse’s ﬁrst sen-

tence; that is, Å Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾

T h e   F i r s t :  The previous verse pointed out the bounty of life and exist-
ence, while this one indicates the bounty of permanent existence ( al-baqā& ) 
and its causes.

T h e   S e c o n d :  When the previous verse proves that man is at the highest 
degree, that is, he will return to the Most High, it arouses the listener’s mind 
and he asks: “ How could lowly man have had the capacity [ to sustain ] this 
high rank if it hadn’t been for the Most High’s grace and His drawing him to 
it? ” So this phrase as though replies to the question, saying that man has a 
truly elevated place in his Creator’s sight since He has subjugated the whole 
world to him.

T h e   T h i r d :  On the previous verse indicating the occurrence of the res-
urrection of the dead and Great Gathering for mankind, the listener starts 
to ask: “ What is man’s importance that the resurrection should be brought 
about for him and the world destroyed for his happiness? ” And this phrase 
as though replies: “ Seeing that all that the earth contains has been prepared 
for his use and all its species [ of beings ] have been subjugated to him, he 
must have supreme importance since this shows he is the fruit of creation. ”
T h e   F o u r t h :   With  the  words ¼ »  the  previous  verse  implies 
that [ in the hereafter ] intermediaries will be removed and all recourse and 
authority will be conﬁned to the Most High. In this world however man has 
numerous  things  and  authorities  to  which  he  has  recourse,  so  this  phrase 
states that causes and intermediaries disclose the hand of power and that the 
true place of recourse [ in this world too ] is Allah the Most High, and that 
causes only intervene for certain instances of wisdom. For the Most High 
creates everything man needs.

T h e   F i f t h :  The preceding verse having alluded to eternal happiness, this 
one  points  out  the  previous  grace  and  favours  that  necessitate  it.  That  is, 

258

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

one who has been graced with all that is on the earth must be worthy of being 
granted everlasting happiness.

The phrase: É È Ç Æ : Its positioning has four aspects:
T h e   F i r s t :  The heavens are the earth’s companion. The earth cannot be 

conceived of as alone; mention of it always recalls the heavens.

T h e   S e c o n d :  The skies are ordered perfectly, [ in such a way that ] man 

may utilize what is on the earth.

T h e   T h i r d :  The preceding phrase points out evidences of [ divine ] beneﬁ-
cence and grace, while this one points to evidences of [ divine ] grandeur and 
power.

T h e   F o u r t h :  This phrase indicates that man’s beneﬁts are not conﬁned to 

the earth, but that the heavens too are subjugated to his use.

The positioning of the phrase Ì Ë Ê This has ﬁve aspects:
T h e   F i r s t :  This phrase is tied to the previous one in the way that [ the ﬁat ]  

¥  is tied to  ¦

T h e   S e c o n d :  [ It is tied to the previous one ] in the way that the function-

ing ( ta‘lluq ) of [ divine ] power and that of [ divine ] will are tied.

T h e   T h i r d :  [ It is tied to the previous phrase ] in the way that the conclu-

sion [ of a piece ] is tied to the introduction.

The positioning of the phrase Ñ Ð Ï Î  has two aspects:
O n e   o f   t h e m :  [ This phrase ] is an argument from cause to effect ( d a l ī l  
l i m m ī  ) proving the ordering [ described in the previous phrase ], just as that 
ordering is an argument from effect to cause ( d a l ī l   i n n ī  ) proving this phrase. 
For  order  and  harmony  prove  the  existence  of  perfect  knowledge,  just  as 
knowledge informs order.

T h e   o t h e r :  The previous phrase points to perfect power, while this one 

indicates all-embracing knowledge. 

The positioning of the parts of the verse’s phrases

[ The verse contains these points: ] the ﬁrst phrase is not tied to the previ-
ous one; the ﬁrst two parts are deﬁnite, as is the predicate; the preposition 
( ل ) of Á  and the phrase’s precedence; the preposition Ã and the word 
Å

VERSE 29 – THE EARTH’S CREATION FOR HUMANKIND

259

Being  unconnected  to  what  preceded  it  ( a l - i s t i ’ n ā f  )  the  ﬁrst  phrase 
implies the unstated questions the answers to which were noted in the ‘ﬁve 
aspects’ of the positioning of the ﬁrst phrase above.

In the phrase ¿ ¾ , ¾ is the subject and ¾ is the predicate, and 
both are deﬁnite, which indicates divine unity and restriction. [ That is, the 
creation of all in the earth is conﬁned to Allah; Allah is the sole Creator. ] 
And this restriction alludes to the restriction expressed by the precedence of 
»  in ¼ » º  in the previous verse. [ The relative pronoun ¾ 
and relative clause are the predicate and of right should be indeﬁnite. ] It’s 
being deﬁnite here indicates that the statement is obvious. [ That is, it is clear 
and obvious that Allah is the Creator of all on the earth. ]

The  [ preposition ]  “   ( ل )  -  of  beneﬁt ”  in Á  indicates  that  essentially 
things  are  permissible  and  become  forbidden  only  under  certain  circum-
stances; for instance, other people’s property is proscribed since it is pro-
tected  by  the  Shari‘a;  human  ﬂesh  is  proscribed  out  of  respect;  poison 
because of its harm; or carrion because it is unclean. 

Furthermore, it suggests the existence of beneﬁt for man in everything, 
even if he beneﬁts from only one of the many ways a thing may be ben-
eﬁted from, or in only one of many ways; [ there is beneﬁt for man ] even in 
the least of things; or at least a thing may be utilized with a view to taking 
lessons. Moreover, the Most Merciful has many treasuries stored up in the

In the second phrase, Æ indicates a chain of the Most High’s actions and 
works after creating the earth, [ His turning ] to the ordering of the heavens. 
It is also a sign that in regard to human beneﬁts, their ordering is of a lower 
degree than the earth’s creation. It also infers its occurring later than [ the 
earth’s creation ]. 

Ç is a concise usage, meaning  ىّ

meaning, denoting someone who aims at something intently without swerv-
ing to left or right.

É È : that is, to the [ physical ] matter of the heavens, and towards 

them.

The particle ( ف ) of  Ê  in so far that this is the particle of diver-
gence or branching ( t a f r ī ‘  ), [ the tie between this phrase and the previous 
one; that is, between a s t a w ā  and t a s w ī y y a  ] resembles ¦ being the con-
sequence of [ the creative command ]  ¥ and an act of power being the result 
of an act of will, and the execution of an act ( a l - q a ḍ ā ’  ) being the result of

The meaning of يٰ

An Introduction

> = < ; : 9 

An Introduction
Consider this: Conﬁrmatory belief in the existence of the angels is one of 
the pillars of faith. We may discuss it here in several stations ( m a q ā m ā t  ): 1

The First Station

Whoever  observes  the  earth,  [ will  see  that ]  despite  its  lowliness  it  is 
ﬁlled with beings with spirits ( d h a w ī  a l - a r w ā ḥ  ), and if he studies the precise 
order  of  the  world,  he  will  surmise  that  the  lofty  constellations  also  have 
inhabitants.

A person who does not believe in the existence of the angels resembles a 
man who travels to a great city and there comes across a little house which 
is old, littered with refuse, and overﬂowing with people. He notices that its 
yard is full of beings with spirits all of which have particular vital needs: 
some are herbivorous and some pisciverous. Then thousands of lofty man-
sions strike his eye, new and interspersed among wide squares and avenues, 
but  due  to  the  absence  of  the  conditions  to  support  life,  he  believes  this 
abode to be devoid of inhabitants.

A person who does believe in the angels is like someone who when he 
sees the small house which is full of beings with spirits and notes the well 
laid-out  city,  is  absolutely  certain  that  the  decorated  mansions  also  have 
inhabitants, appropriate to them and with their own particular conditions of 
life. Their being invisible, due to either the distance or the loftiness of the

262

VERSE 30 – PROOF OF THE ANGELS

263

mansions, does not prove that they do not exist. Thus, by means of a primary 
analogy based on a ‘hidden’ syllogism and based too on the regular order, it 
may be concluded from the earth being full of animate beings that endless 
space with its constellations, stars, and heavens is full of beings with spirits. 
And these beings, which are of various sorts, the Shari‘a calls the angels. 
Now, reﬂect on this!

The Second Station

You  know,  as  has  been  discussed,  that  life  is  the  discloser  of  beings; 
indeed, it is its result. So how could endless space be devoid of inhabitants 
and the heavens lack their populace? All the intelligent have in effect agreed 
on the concept of the angels and their reality, even if their interpretations 
have differed. In fact, the Peripatetic philosophers called them “ the disem-
bodied spiritual essences of species; ” and the Illuminists called them “ the 
[ ten ] intellects and masters ( a r b ā b  ) of the species; ” and the followers of 
the religions have called the Mountain Angel, the Sea Angel, and the Rain 
Angel, for example. For the Materialists even, who believe only what they 
see, it has not been easy to deny the concept of the angels and they have 
associated them with the pervasive forces or power ( a l - q ū w w ā t   a l - s ā r i y y a  ) 
in the laws of creation.

• I f   y o u   w e r e   t o   a s k :  Aren’t the laws and principles in force in creation 

sufﬁcient to hold the universe together and [ sustain ] its vitality?

Yo u   w o u l d   b e   t o l d :  Those laws and principles are only theoretical or sub-
jective ( i ‘ t i b ā r i y y a  ) or imaginary even; they can be accorded speciﬁc exist-
ence and identity only through that which represents and reﬂects them and 
holds their reins. And this is nothing other than the angels. 

Furthermore, the philosophers ( a l - ḥ u k a m ā ’  ), reason, and the transmitted 
religious texts are united in [ their belief that ] existence is not restricted to 
the visible Manifest World, which is lifeless and unsuitable for the forma-
tion  ( t a s h a k k u l  )  of  spirits.  The  World  of  the  Unseen  however  comprises 
numerous worlds that are appropriate for spirits, like water is for ﬁshes, and 
is full of them and it imparts ( m u ẓ h i r  ) life to the Manifest World. 

Thus,  since  these  four  matters  testify  for  you  to  the  existence  of  the 
angels as a concept, the most satisfactory forms ascribed to them are those 
set out by the Shari‘a, as is agreed by all people of sound intelligence: they 
are honoured worshipful servants [ of Allah ] who never fail to do what they 
are commanded. They are subtle luminous bodies and are of various sorts.

264

The Third Station

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

Consider this: The angels is one of those matters in which [ the existence 
of ] the universal can be veriﬁed by establishing [ the existence of ] a single 
particular and the species can be known through the sighting of one of its 
members. For if one is denied, all are denied. 

It  would  surely  be  impossible  in  your  opinion  –  otherwise  may  Allah 
awaken you [ to the truth ]! – for the followers of all the religions down the 
ages  from  the  time  of  Adam  to  the  present  to  have  agreed  on  the  angels’ 
existence, and on the certain occurrence of conversations with them and the 
deﬁnite  sightings  of  them  and  the  narrations  about  them  and  what  people 
have reported about their various sorts – if one single angel, or several, had 
not been seen and if the existence of one or more of them was not certain or 
if their existence had not been perceived. 

Similarly, it is impossible that a such a delusion would have become 
established in the beliefs of mankind and persisted in this way through all 
the upheavals [ of time ] if there had been no truth that gave rise to those 
general beliefs or to the necessary principles on which they were based. 
In which case, the basis of the consensus is a conjecture born of various 
different signs, provided by sightings, arising from necessary principles. 
And  the  reason  for  the  general  belief  is  the  necessary  principles  arising 
from [ the angels ] having been seen and observed on numerous occasions, 
forming  what  is  in  effect  a  consensus  concerning  them.  Otherwise  none 
of the certain, well-known beliefs of mankind [ concerning other things ] 
would be reliable.

Thus,  if  the  existence  of  any  one  spirit  being  ( a l - r ū ḥ ā n i y y a  )  has  been 
veriﬁed at any time, the existence of the species has been veriﬁed. And since 
the existence of the species has been veriﬁed, it will surely be as described 
by the Shari‘a and expounded by the Qur’an.

The positioning of this verse’s meaning in relation to the 
preceding one

It has four aspects:
T h e   F i r s t :   The  [ earlier ]  verses  enumerate  the  immense  bounties 
[ bestowed  on  man ],  and  the  previous  one  indicates  the  greatest  of  them 
– man’s being the fruit of creation and all on the earth being subjugated to 
him for him to dispose of as he wishes. Now this verse points out that man 
is vicegerent of the earth and is its ruler.

VERSE 30 – PROOF OF THE ANGELS

265

T h e   S e c o n d :  This verse expounds, explains, elucidates, veriﬁes, proves, 
and  corrroborates  what  the  previous  verse  [ states ],  that  the  reins  of  the 
chains of all on the earth are in man’s hands.

T h e   T h i r d :  The previous verse having explained the building of the two 
dwellings of the earth and the heavens, this one indicates their inhabitants, 
mankind and the angels. And while the former alludes to the chain of crea-
tion, this one hints at the chain of beings with spirits ( d h a w ī   a l - a r w ā ḥ  ).

T h e   F o u r t h :   On  the  previous  verse  making  it  clear  that  humankind  is 
the aim of creation and that man has a high place in his Creator’s sight, the 
listener is moved to ask: “ How can man be worthy when he perpetrates so 
much evil and corruption? Does wisdom necessitate his existence, to wor-
ship and hallow the Most High? ” So this verse implies that on account of 
( lit. besides ) the mystery [ the Trust ] being deposited in him, his evils and 
iniquities are forgiven, and that Allah stands in no need of man’s worship, 
for  some  of  the  angels  hallow  Him  and  glorify  Him  with  praises  beyond 
number. [ Man’s creation therefore ] is for some purpose known only to the 
One All-Knowing of the Unseen.

Now the positioning of the verse’s phrases

This verse ﬂows on smoothly [ from the previous one ] because of [ the 
second,  implied ]  w  necessitated  by  the  ﬁrst,  and  its  looking  to  ( ‘ a ṭ f  ) 
Ñ Ð Ï Î  [ although  it  is  apparently  unrelated.  This  implies ]  the 
ّ(cid:92)َر َلاَ(cid:162) ْذِا َو اً(cid:175)َ(cid:147)َ(cid:99)ْ(cid:179)ُ(cid:174) َقَ(cid:171)َ(cid:114) اَ(cid:174) َقَ(cid:171)َ(cid:114) ْذِا “ Then (  w  ) He created 
unstated sentence:  ... َكُ
...$ # " !   ” 
what  He  created  in  perfect  systematic  order 
[ Thus, the second w looks to the ﬁrst and a relationship is formed between 
the two sentences. ] When, to get them to ask the reason for [ man’s crea-
tion ] and to teach them consultation as a method, the Most High addresses 
the angels saying: ) ( ' & % it prompts the listener’s mind 
to ask [ three things ]: “ What did they say? ” in connection with the mystery 
of conversation; and to ask the reason for [ man’s creation ] and out of sur-
prise: - , and to learn the wisdom in man’s vicegerency rather than 
the mischief-making jinns and his having been entrusted with the powers of 
anger and animal appetites: 0 / . [ While this latter is ] due to the 
excesses of the power of appetite, 2 1 is due to the aggression 
of  the  power  of  anger.  Having  completed    its  questions  and  expressed  its 

266

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

surprise, the listener’s mind awaits the Most High’s reply. And He says: 
> = < ; : 9 That is, everything is not limited to what you know, 
and your not knowing does not infer a thing doesn’t exist. I am All-Wise, 
I have good reason for [ their creation ], and I shall forgive their corruption 
and bloodshed on account of the wisdom in it. 

Now the positioning of the parts of the phrases

As  shown  above,  by  reason  of  the  necessary  relationship  between  two 
sentences joined by a conjunction, the [ conjunction ] ( و ) [ at the beginning 
of ]  ) ( ' & % $ # " !  implies  an  unstated 
sentence. An implied sentence is similarly required before the verse 

( 15:28 ) ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´ ³ ² ± °
Also, since [ by its very nature ] Revelation summons attention and calls 

to mind, the conjuction ( و ) implies اً(cid:175)َ(cid:147)َ(cid:99)ْ(cid:179)ُ(cid:174)  َقَ(cid:171)َ(cid:114) اَ(cid:174)  َقَ(cid:171)َ(cid:114) ْذِا 

The [ particle ] w denotes past time, and so sends the minds [ of listeners ] 
down the rungs of the past, there raises [ the veil ] and attracts to the present 
its events so they may behold them and gather them up.

The [ words ] # is a proof for the angels; that is, the One who has 
raised and perfected you [ Muhammad ], and made you the guide of human-
kind  that  you  might  put  a  stop  to  their  corruption.  That  is,  you  are  the 
supreme good deed [ of mankind ] that preponderates over all its iniquities 
and covers its faults.

$  Through  their  conversation  in  the  form  of  consultation  this 
indicates that the dwellers of the heavens, that is, the angels, have very many 
relations and connections with the dwellers of the earth, that is, humankind. 
For some of them are charged with overseeing [ human beings ] ( m u w a k k a l  ), 
some are guardian angels, some are recording angels, so they have to con-
cern themselves with their affairs. 

Since it is the nature of the [ intensifying particle ] % to repulse doubts, 
here  expressed  [ by  the  angels’  question ] ,  it  indicates  the  immense 
importance of the question.

The use of the ﬁrst person pronominal sufﬁx ي of % although the ﬁrst 
person plural is used in w in the following verses, indicates that there are 

VERSE 30 – MAN’S VICEGERENCY

267

no  intermediaries  in  His  creation  and  giving  of  existence  as  there  are  in 
His speech and address. These ﬁne points are illustrated also in the verse 
( 4:105 ) Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ » º ¹ ¸ Here, the ﬁrst 
person plural in ¹ indicates the existence of an intermediary in [ the send-
ing down of ] Revelation and infers its splendour. [ That is, it indicates the 
angel( s ) of Revelation, who manifest the splendour of the One who sends 
them. ] While the third person singular in Â Á À indicates that there are 
no intermediaries in the inspiration of meanings. 

The choice of & rather than ٌقِ(cid:170)اَ(cid:114) indicates that what causes the doubts 
and  questioning  is  mankind  being  ‘placed’  on  the  earth  and  appointed  to 
cultivate it, not [ man’s ] creation and being given existence. For existence 
is pure good and creation is an essential act ( ﬁ ‘ l   d h ā t ī  ) [ of Allah ] and [ as 
such ] cannot be questioned. 

And  the  choice  of   '  in  the  phrase   ( '  rather  than  ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150)  despite 
mankind being on the earth, intimates that humankind resembles the spirit 
breathed into the earth, and if it ever quits the earth, the earth will fall apart 
and expire. 

)  suggests  that  before  conditions  on  the  earth  were  readied  for 
human life, there were intelligent creatures for whose lives, conditions dur-
ing the earth’s early epochs were suitable. This [ view ] is in conformity with 
the questions of science ( q a ḍ ī y y a   a l - ḥ i k m a  ). The most widely held [ view ] 
is that these creatures were a species of jinn, but they spread corruption [ on 
the earth ] so were succeeded by mankind.

The parts of the sentence:  2 1 0 / . - , +
Consider  this: +  being  apparently  unconnected  to  what  precedes  it 
( i s t i ’ n ā f  ) suggests that the Most High’s turning to and addressing the angels 
drives the listener to ask: “ What will [ the angels’ ] attitude be towards their 
neighbours, seeing that their houses are side by side? Will they be happy to 
have them as fellows? What is their opinion of them? ” So the Qur’an says: 

, +

This last phrase, , +  is the consequence of the conditional par-
ticle w [ in the phrase ± °  ] [ but the necessary consequence ( l u z ū m  ) is 
unstated, implying the words: ] “ Allah the Most High ruled that man should 

268

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

be  made  vicegerent  of  the  earth,  which  was  under  the  supervision  of  the 
angels, although He was in no need of ofﬁcers or ministers. This meant that 
the angels had to declare how they would meet [ human beings ]. ” 

The speech [ in these two phrases ] is a conversation in the form of con-
sultation, [ and its purpose is ] to teach [ these to ] the people, for the Most 
High is far above [ any need of ] them.

[ The angels ] ask: , in order to learn the reason, for the Most High 
had informed [ them ] about it but had withheld the reason. This was the cause 
of their surprise and it led to their question. That is, their asking: “ What is 
the wisdom in [ men ] being placed [ on the earth ]? ” Thus, they wanted to 
learn the result or effect rather than the cause, not to deny or object to it, for 
they are without sin. 

And “ the placing ” [ of mankind on the earth ] hints that man’s charac-
teristics, and theoretical origins and descent, and circumstances are not the 
imperatives of nature, but have all been ‘placed’ by One who places. 

The repetition of 0 despite their proximity is for clarity and implies: 
What is the reason for placing mankind [ on the earth ] as a spirit breathed 
into the earth’s body to quicken it, when on the other hand men will be the 
cause of its corruption and death? 

The use of the [ relative pronoun ] . indicates that rather than the human 
character, it is the rebellion of creatures against the Most High that troubles 
[ the angels ].

And the use of /  rather than ‘rebel’ indicates that rebellion eventu-
ally spoils the order of the world. And the use of the imperfect tense indi-
cates that what is detestable about it is its constant repetition. [ The angels ] 
had knowledge of this either through the Most High informing [ them ], or 
through studying the Preserved Tablet, or because they had knowledge of 
human nature and the unrestricted powers lodged in it. Corruption is caused 
through the unrestrained use of the power of animal appetites, while blood-
shed and tyranny result from the aggression of the power of anger.

0  that is, [ they cause corruption in the earth ] despite it being a mosque 

founded on consciousness of Allah and fear of Him ( t a q w ā  ).

The [ conjunction ] ( و ) joins two despicable acts [ causing corruption and 

shedding blood ], for corruption leads to the spilling of blood. 

 rather than  ُلُ(cid:99)ْ(cid:163)َ(cid:192) is because to shed blood is to 
kill unjustly. And murder is not j i h ā d  in Allah’s way. Also, the [ just ] killing 

And the choice of  ﹸﻚﹺﻔ ﹾﺴﹶﻳ

VERSE 30 – MAN’S VICEGERENCY

269

of one person for the good of the community is like killing a wolf to save 
the ﬂock.

The  [ use  of ]  the  word 2  with  “ s h e d   b l o o d  ”  is  to  emphasize  the 

repugnance of murder.

The positioning of the parts of the phrase: 7 6 5 4 3 
The  [ circumstantial  conjunction ] ( و )  ( w ā w   a l - ḥ ā l  )  indicates  that  [ the 
angels ] were aware that they would meet with [ such ] a counter-objection 
as: “ Aren’t mankind’s worship and hallowing of the Most High sufﬁcient 
wisdom in your view [ for human beings being placed on the earth ]? ”

ُنْ(cid:111)َ(cid:178)  that  is,  the  whole  host  of  angels  untainted  by  sin.  And  this  being 
a nominal sentence infers that gloriﬁcation of Allah is a part of their very 
natures and intrinsic to them and necessitated by their natures.

5 4  is a very comprehensive phrase: “ We proclaim You in the 
universe through all the varieties of worship. We believe that with Your glo-
rious attributes You are far above anything unworthy [ of Your Godhead ] – 
[ Your glorious attributes ] that are [ the source ] of Your praiseworthy boun-
ّ(cid:195)ا َناَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126) that is, we laud and extol You with Your 

ties. We declare: ِه ِد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ِ(cid:92)ِو ِ
attributes of glory and beauty ( a l - j a l ā l   w a ’ l - j a m ā l  )! ” 

And 7 6 that is, “ we hallow You; ” or, “ we purify ourselves and 
our action from sins and our hearts of desire for anything other than You. ”

And  contrarily  to  the  previous  conjunction  [ joining  the  two  vices  of 
corruption  and  spilling  blood ],  the  [ conjunction ]  ( و )  here  joins  the  two 
virtues of compliance with the divine commands and avoidance of things 
proscribed.

Now  the  parts  of  the  phrase:   > = < ; : 9  The  apparent 
unconnectedness  of  this  phrase  ( a l - i s t i ’ n ā f  )  implies  the  [ unstated ]  ques-
tions:  “ What  did  Allah  the  Most  High  say  in  reply  to  their  questioning? 
How did His explanation of the reason [ for mankind’s creation ] dispel their 
astonishment? What is the wisdom in human beings’ preference to them? ” 
So it says: 9 alluding to its brief reply and to the detailed explanation in 
the following verse. 

The : of  ; : is conﬁrmative ( l i ’ l - t a ḥ q ī q  ) and rebuts doubts and 
hesitation.  It  is  used  only  in  speculative  matters  not  incontestable  ones, 

ٰ
270

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

whereas  the  Most  High  self-evidently  and  indisputably  knows  what  crea-
tures  do  not  know,  and  Allah  forbid,  the  angels  have  no  doubts  concern-
ing  this.  In  which  case,  the :  throws  light  on  a  sequence  of  [ unstated ] 
phrases  which,  conformably  with  the  well-trodden  path  of  rhetoric  ( ṭ a r ī q  
a l - b a y ā n ī  ), the Qur’an summarizes succinctly. That is, there is much good 
and many advantages in mankind, and there is sinfulness but this is minor. 
It  would  be  opposed  to  wisdom  to  abandon  the  former  due  to  the  latter. 
Humanity also holds a mystery, and this qualiﬁes man for the vicegerency. 
The angels were heedless of it, but man’s Creator had knowledge of it. There 
is also an instance of wisdom in the [ creation ] of human beings that renders 
them superior to [ the angels ]; the angels did not know this, but the One who 
created it did. 

The : ‘s [ conﬁrmatory ] meaning may also refer to a statement implied 
by any one of the sentence’s words rather than to one speciﬁc word. Here it 
looks to a phrase implied by > = that is, ‘you have no certain knowl-
edge of it.’

Also, > = < ;  is by way of mentioning something necessary and 
willing its natural consequence. That is, something exists that you have no 
knowledge of. For the Most High’s knowledge is necessary for everything. 
The  absence  of  [ His ]  knowledge  indicates  the  non-existence  of  the  thing 
known. As the Most High says: ( 10:18 ) § ¦ ¥ That is, it is not possible 
[ for something unknown by Allah ] to exist. And the existence of knowledge 
is evidence for the existence of the thing known. 

[ In another place the Qur’an ] veriﬁes and conﬁrms this succinct reply, 

ّنِا His actions lack nothing as regards wisdom and 
saying: ٌمـ(cid:193)ﯮﯧَ(cid:110) ٌمـ(cid:193)ِ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) َ
beneﬁt. Hence, beings are not restricted to the knowledge of creatures, and 
the absence of knowledge does not indicate their non-existence. 

ّ(cid:195)ا َ

When  Allah  the  Most  High  created  pure  good,  that  is,  the  angels,  and 
pure evil, that is, the devils, and that which was neither good nor evil, that is, 
the animals, being the Muniﬁcent Bestower of Bounties, His wisdom neces-
sitated the existence of a fourth category that embraced both good and evil. 
[ That is, human beings. ] Thus, if the [ human ] powers of anger and animal 
appetites submit to the power of intellect, through effort and striving man 
rises higher than the angels. But if the reverse is the case, he falls lower than 
the beasts, for he has no excuse.

An Introduction

An Introduction 

Consider this: This miracle of Adam [ the teaching of the names ] chal-
lenged the angels [ and their doubts ]; indeed, it was a miracle of mankind  
related  to  the  question  of  the  vicegerency.  There  are  many  lessons  to  be 
learnt from the story.

Bearing in mind the verse: ( 6:59 )  Þ Ý Ü Û Ú Ù Ø × and sup-
ported by the facts that the Qur’an both offers you clear statements and evi-
dences, and teaches you through signs and indications, I understand from the 
masterly signs and indications1 of the Qur’an’s miraculousness in the stories 
of the prophets and their miracles, that it is encouraging mankind to attain 
similar achievements. It is as though with these stories, the Qur’an is point-
ing the ﬁnger at the main lines and ﬁnal results in the future of mankind’s 
efforts  to  progress,  for  the  future  is  built  on  the  foundations  of  the  past, 
while the past is the mirror of the future. And it is as though the Qur’an is 

1. If you are in doubt concerning what the author discovered about the subtleties of 
the Qur’an’s composition, I can tell you that we consulted Ibn al-Fāriḍ’s book of poetry, 
opening it at random, and these lines came up:

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

slapping humanity on the back urging and encouraging men, saying: “ Exert 
yourselves to the utmost [ and discover ] the means to achieve some of these 
wonders! ” You surely know that it was the hand of miracles that ﬁrst gave 
mankind the clock and the ship.

If you wish, consider now the verses: 

( 2:31 ) C B A @
( 34:10 ) a ` _ ^ ] \ [ Z Y X W V U T
( 34:12 ) | { z y x w v u t s r
( 2:60 ) X W V U T  R Q P
(  ( 5:110` _ ^ ]
Now dwell on what combined human thought has produced and the thou-
sands of rational sciences it has deduced: each of them [ is related to ] one 
of the species [ realms of being ] in the universe, so that mankind has come 
to manifest 

( 2:31 ) C B A @
Now  ponder  over  the  railway  and  telegraph  and  other  wonders  of  art 
deduced by human thought and by means of smelting iron and forging cop-
per, so that man came to manifest  ( 34:10 ) a ` _ and this became the 
basis of his industries

Think also about the aeroplanes that human minds incubated and hatched, 
which travel a month’s journey in a day, so that humankind would come to 
manifest:  ( 34:12 ) w v u t

And  reﬂect  on  the  progress  achieved  in  tools  invented  through  human 
enterprise, staffs to strike arid deserts, causing copious springs to gush forth 
and transforming the sandy wastes into gardens, so that man is on the point 
of manifesting ( 2:60 ) R Q P

Now ponder over the wonders of medicine yielded by man’s experiments 
that are beginning to heal those born blind and the lepers and the chronically 
sick, by Allah’s leave – you will see that [ between the above verses and the 
future scientiﬁc discoveries ] is a full correspondence and you will be right 
to  say  that  [ those  miracles ]  are  the  criteria  and  measure  [ of  those  future 

VERSE 31-33 – THE TEACHING OF THE NAMES

273

discoveries ], and that the miracles point to them and urge [ mankind to work 
to achieve ] them.

Similarly, consider such verses as: ( 21:69 ) « ª © ¨
( 12:24 ) F E D C B That is, according to one narration, had he 

not had a vision of Jacob biting his ﬁnger.

( 34:10 ) \ [ Z       ( 12:94 ) Ä Ã Â Á

( 27:40 ) j i h g f e d c   ( 27:16 ) H G F
Now consider mankind’s discovery of the degree of heat that does not 
burn and non-inﬂammable materials; and the invention of means of attract-
ing images and sounds from far off and bringing them to you before you 
can blink your eye; and ‘speaking’ machines [ such as the radio ]; and the 
employment of some species of birds like the pigeon and so on. You may 
see  the  agreement  and  congruity  between  these  two  sorts  [ of  wonders ], 
and  may  rightly  say  that  [ the  verses ]  signify  and  allude  to  [ the  future 
discoveries ]. 

Similarly, reﬂect on the particular attribute of the Supreme Miracle [ the 
Qur’an ], articulate speech and thought, the peculiarity of humanity, and 
literature and eloquence. Now think about the highest means of training the 
human spirit, and the subtlest means of purifying the conscience, and the 
ﬁnest way of adorning human thought, and the best at expanding the heart:  
this is none other than a sort of literature. For some unknown reason, this 
literature is the most extensive of sciences, it has the widest scope, is the 
most penetrating and effective, and the closest to the human heart. Indeed, 
it is the sultan of the sciences. Think over this carefully!

[ Like the previous verses ] these verses have three aspects
related to their positioning and composition

The positioning of the [ ﬁrst ] verse in relation to the preceding one has 

four aspects:

T h e   F i r s t :  When the Qur’an explains the wisdom in man’s vicegerency 
in the previous verse it is the ﬁrst part of the answer, and is more general 
[ addressing ] everyone, and the easiest and most convincing, and the most 
brief  and  concise.  Then  with  this  verse  it  gives  an  explanatory,  detailed 
answer satisfying to both ordinary people and the elite.

274

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

T h e  S e c o n d :  Having made an explicit statement about man’s vicegerency 
in the previous verse, with this one it proves the question with the miracle of 
mankind in the face of the angels.

T h e   T h i r d :   The  previous  verse  having  indicated  mankind’s  superiority 

over the angels, this verse alludes to the cause of its superiority.

T h e  F o u r t h :  Having hinted with the previous verse at humankind’s receiv-
ing the supreme vicegerency of the earth, with this one it allusively advances 
arguments to support it. For by virtue of the diversity of man’s abilities and 
the multiplicity of ways in which he can utilize things and the many sides 
to his knowledge, and his encompassing the universe with his ﬁve senses, 
external  and  inner,  and  especially  with  his  boundless  conscience,  he  is  a 
comprehensive copy [ of the world ] and locus of all the manifestations [ of 
the divine names ]. You can see that contrary to the angels, he can relish the 
taste of things like honey in two ways or even more! So ponder over this!

The positioning of the verses’ phrases is naturally
smooth and ﬂuent to the utmost degree

The ﬁrst [ phrase  C B A @ ] veriﬁes ( t a ḥ q ī q  ) the meaning 
of [ the last phrase of the previous verse ]: > = < ; : and elabo-
rates what it states summarily and expounds its obscurities. Moreover, [ the 
function of ] the Most High’s vicegerent on the earth is to execute His ordi-
nances and apply His laws, and this is dependent on full knowledge. So too, 
the thread and drift of the previous verse implies these [ unstated words ]: 
“ So He created him and ordered his being, and breathed His spirit into him 
and  raised  him,  then  He  taught  him  the  names  and  prepared  him  for  the 
vicegerency. ”

Then,  since  [ the  Most  High ]  had  chosen  [ Adam ]  over  and  above  the 
angels  and  distinguished  him  [ by  conferring  on  him ]  knowledge  of  the 
names, [ and had made clear ] in this question of his superiority his worthi-
ness of the vicegerency, the context being one of challenge, He presented 
the things to [ the angels ] seeking their objections. So perceiving their impo-
tence,  they  afﬁrmed  the  Most  High’s  wisdom  and  were  assured.  For  this 
reason the Qur’an says: 

N M L K J I H G F E D
P : that is, they declared themselves innocent of what in his egotism 

Iblis had insinuated into their questioning, saying: 

VERSE 31-33 – THE TEACHING OF THE NAMES

275

\ [ Z Y  W V U T S R Q

Then,  once  their  impotence,  arising  from  their  lack  of  comprehensive 
abilities, had become clear, the context necessitated a statement of Adam’s 
competence, in order to complete the challenge. So it says: 

a ` _

Then, when the underlying reason and wisdom had become exempliﬁed 
and apparent in Adam, the context ( a l - m a q ā m  ) necessitated the former con-
cise reply, making it a sort of consequence of the detailed explanation here. 
So [ the Qur’an ] says: 

t s r q p o n m l k j i h g
This use of conversation divulges and intimates that Iblis’ egotism had 
spread among the angels, and that the objections of one group [ of devils ] 
intervened in their questioning.

The positioning of the parts of the phrases

The phrase C B A @ : That is, [ the Most High ] fashioned 
[ Adam ] with a nature in which were contained the fundamental principles 
of all types of attainment and perfection, and He created him with a disposi-
tion in which were planted the seeds of all elevated qualities, and He decked 
him out with ten senses, and a conscience that would hold the similitudes 
of all beings. He prepared him [ by giving him ] these three faculties that He 
might teach him the realities of things in all their variety. Then He taught 
him all the names.

The [ conjunction ] ( َو ) implies the above phrases, ‘rolled up’ beneath the 

conciseness ( ī j ā z  ).

ﻢﱠﻠﹶﻋ

 allusively praises knowledge and indicates its high degree and that 
it is the pivot of the vicegerency. It is a sign too that the names [ of things ] 
are made known by Allah. This is corroborated by the relationships mostly 
obtaining  between  names  and  the  things  they  signify.  It  suggests  too  that 
miracles are an act of Allah without intermediary, contrarily to [ the claim ] 
of the philosophers that wonders are the acts of wondrous spirits.

A that is, the earthling whose vicegerency was willed by Allah the 
Most High and who was given the name of Adam by Him. The speciﬁc 

276

SIGNS OF MIRACULOUSNESS

mention of the name is to applaud and proclaim it and to associate it with 
him.

B  :  The  attributes,  characteristics,  and  appellations  that  signify 
things, or the [ myriad ] languages [ or words and terms – a l - l u g h ā t  ] that the 
sons of Adam use ( lit. have divided among themselves ). Also, as indicated 
by E it suggests that the names are identical to what they signify, as is 
claimed by the Sunnis.

C : is a clear statement of the source of [ Adam’s ] distinction [ vis-à-
vis the angels ] and of the miracle [ of the names ]. [ That is, while man may 
acquire complete knowledge of the names, the angels’ knowledge is partial. ]

The phrases: 

 N M L K J I H G F E D
 D : By reason of the interval ( a l - t a r ā k h ī  ) indicated here, and as neces-
sitated by the context ( a l - m a q ā m  ), this implies [ the unstated words ]: “ And 
[ Allah ] said: He is nobler than you and more worthy of the vicegerency. ”
E  :  that  is,  as  though  offered  for  sale.  He  set  out  for  their  inspec-
tion things of all sorts, as though presenting wares to customers or parading 
the ranks before the commander. In this is an indication that for intelligent 
beings  things  are  goods  they  may  buy  through  knowledge,  and  take  pos-
session of through naming them ( lit. their names ), and appropriate through 
representing their forms. 

The  [ pronominal  sufﬁx ]  ْمُ(cid:182)  is  used  for  masculine  rational  beings  so 
expounds the two things that render beings superior to others ( t a g h l ī b  ) [ that 
is,  masculinity  and  reason ]  and  the  trope  ( m a j ā z  )  hinted  at  by  the  word 
َضَرَ(cid:150)  For  one  imagines  from  [ Allah ]  despatching  the  varieties  of  beings 
which  parade  rank  upon  rank  for  inspection,  that  they  are  regiments  ( lit. 
tribes ) of [ masculine ] intelligent beings advancing towards [ the angels ].

F hints that what is presented to [ the angels ] are the forms [ of things ] 

inscribed on the Sublime Tablet.

[ In a manner entirely outside my will, this verse occurred to me when I 
came to the end of most of the Wo r d s  ( S ö z l e r  ) and L e t t e r s  ( M e k t û b a t  ). 
Now I realize that this commentary was concluded with the same verse, 
and that all the Words are a sort of true commentary on it and a sparkling 
stream issuing from its ocean, and at their conclusions pour [ back ] into 
it. It is as though all the Wo r d s  gush forth [ and begin ] from the verse 
here at the end of this commentary. Hence, ever since that time [ when 
the commentary was written ] I have been unable to ﬁnish expounding 
the verse that I might begin its second volume. S a i d   N u r s i   ]

INDEX OF ADDITIONAL
QUR’ANIC VERSES

In the Name of Allah, the Merciful the Compassionate. * All praise be to Allah, the Lord 
and Sustainer of All the Worlds; * The Merciful, the Compassionate; * Master of the 
Day of Judgement; * You alone do we worship and from You alone do we seek help; 
* Guide us to the Straight Path; * The path of those whom You have blessed, not of 
those who earn Your anger, nor of those who go astray.

1:1-7

Alif. Lām. Mīm. * This is the Book concerning which is no doubt, guidance sure for those 
who fear Allah * Who believe in the Unseen, are steadfast in prayer, and spend out 
of what We have provided for them * And who believe in that which is revealed to 
you, and that which was revealed before you, and have certain belief in the hereafter 
* They are on [true] guidance from their Lord, and it is these who will prosper * As to 
those who reject faith, it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn 
them; they will not believe * Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing 
* And on their eyes is a veil; and great is the penalty they incur * Of the people there 
are some who say: we believe in Allah and in the Last Day; but they do not really 
believe * Fain would they deceive Allah and those who believe, but they only deceive 
themselves, and realize [it] not!  *  In their hearts is a disease; and Allah has increased 
their disease; and theirs is a grievous penalty, because they are false [to themselves] 
* When it is said to them: ‘Do not spread corruption on the earth,’ they answer: ‘We 
are but improving things!’ *  Oh, verily, it is they, they who are who are spreading 
corruption, but they perceive it not * And when they are told, ‘Believe as other people 
believe,’ they answer, ‘Shall we believe as the weak-minded believe?’ Oh, verily, it is 
they, they who are weak-minded, but they know it not! * When they meet those who 
believe,  they  say:  “We  believe;”  but  when  they  are  alone  with  their  evil  ones,  they 
say: “We are really with you; we [were] only jesting. * Allah will throw back their 
mockery  on  them,  and  give  them  rope  in  their  trespasses;  so  they  will  wander  like 
blind ones [to and fro]. * These are the people who have purchased error at the price of 
guidance, but their trade is proﬁtless, and they are not rightly-guided * Their parable is 
that of people who kindle a ﬁre: but as soon as it has illumined all around them, Allah 
takes away their light and leaves them in utter darkness, wherein they cannot see: * 
Deaf, dumb, blind – and they cannot turn back. * Or [the parable] of a violent cloud-
burst in the sky, with utter darkness, thunder and lightning: they put their ﬁngers into 
their ears to keep out the peals of thunder, in terror of death; but Allah encompasses 
[with His might] all who deny the truth. * The lightning well-nigh takes away their 
sight; whenever it gives them light, they advance therein, and whenever darkness falls 
around them, they stand still. And if Allah so willed, He could indeed take away their 
hearing and sight: for verily Allah is powerful over all things * Or [the parable] of a 
violent cloudburst in the sky, with utter darkness, thunder and lightning: they put their 
ﬁngers into their ears to keep out the peals of thunder, in terror of death; but Allah 
encompasses [with His might] all who deny the truth. * The lightning well-nigh takes

away their sight; whenever it gives them light, they advance therein, and whenever 
darkness falls around them, they stand still. And if Allah so willed, He could indeed 
take away their hearing and sight: for verily Allah is powerful over all things. * O you 
people! Worship your Lord and Sustainer, Who has created you and those [who lived] 
before you, so that you might remain conscious of Him; * Who has made the earth a 
resting-place for you and the sky a canopy, and has sent down water from the sky and 
thereby brought forth fruits for your sustenance: then set not up rivals to Allah, when 
you know [the truth]. * And if you are in doubt as to what We have revealed, step by 
step, to Our servant, then produce a Sura like thereunto; and call your witnesses [and 
helpers if there are any] besides Allah, if what you say is true. * But if you cannot, 
and of a surety you cannot, then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, which is 
prepared for those who reject faith. * But give glad tidings to those who believe and 
work righteousness, that theirs are gardens beneath which rivers ﬂow. Every time they 
are fed with fruits therefrom, they say: “Why, this is what we were fed with before,” 
for they are given things in similitude; and they have therein companions pure [and 
holy]; and they abide therein [for ever]. * Behold, Allah does not disdain to propound a 
parable of a gnat, or of something [even] less than that. Now, as for those who believe, 
they know that it is the truth from their Lord and Sustainer – whereas those who reject 
faith say, ‘What means Allah by this parable?’ By it He causes many to go astray, and 
many He guides aright; but none does he cause thereby to go astray save those who 
forsake [the path] – * Who break  Allah’s covenant after it has been ratiﬁed, and cut 
asunder what Allah has bidden to be joined, and spread corruption on earth; these it is 
that shall be the losers. * How can you refuse to acknowledge Allah seeing that you 
were lifeless and He gave you life; then will He cause you to die, and then will bring 
you again to life; and again to Him will you return. * It is He who has created for you 
all that is on earth, and has applied His design to the heavens, and has fashioned them 
into seven heavens; and of all things He has full knowledge. * Behold, your Lord and 
Sustainer said to the angels: ‘I will create a vicegerent on earth.’ They said: ‘Will You 
place therein one who will make mischief therein and shed blood? Whilst we do cel-
ebrate Your praises and glorify Your holy [name]?’ He said: ‘I know what you know 
not.’ * And He taught Adam the names of all things; then He presented them to the 
angels and said: ‘Declare unto Me the names of these [things], if what you say is true.’ 
* They replied: ‘Limitless You are in Your glory! No knowledge have we save that 
which You have taught us. Verily, You alone are all-knowing, truly wise.’  * Said He: 
‘O Adam, convey unto them the names of these [things].’ And as soon as [Adam] had 
conveyed unto them their names, [Allah] said: ‘Did I not say unto you: Verily, I alone 
know the hidden reality of the heavens and the earth, and know all that you bring into 
the open and all that you would conceal?’

2:1-33

Glory be unto to You, we have no knowledge save that which You have taught us; 

indeed You are All-Knowing, All-Wise.
