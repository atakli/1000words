#7 Introduction 

Anbâr, 1989.) 

 (to the first edition edited by Ihsan Qâsim al-Sâlihî, published in Baghdad: Dâr al-

 All praise be to Allâh, the Lord and Sustainer of all the worlds, and blessings and 

peace be upon Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah, to whom the Qur'an was revealed, the Seal of 

the Prophets and Messengers, and upon his family and companions and those who came 

after them, till the end of time. 

 Virtually  all  those  who  have  studied  the  circumstances  of  the  Muslims  in  recent 

centuries agree that Ustad Bediuzzaman Said Nursi was an Islamic figure of great stature, 

of  strong  faith  and  complete  sincerity;  a  person  of  great  dignity  who  was  cognizant  of 

divine  unity  and  its  truths;  one  of  the  most  distinguished  men  of  his  time,  vastly 

knowledgeable,  of  penetrating  thought,  and  a  steadfast  and  perceptive  caller  to  Allâh's 

way. From his youth he took it on himself to find solutions for the afflictions suffered by 

the Muslims, and passed his life tirelessly striving to expound the teachings of Islam and 

explain  its  beliefs  and  doctrines.  Similarly,  he  refuted  invalid  thought  and  those 

inconsistent philosophies that denied Islam and schemed against it due to the inability of 

Muslims to withstand the stormy intellectual onslaughts to which it had been exposed since 

the beginning of the 14th century of the Hijra; indeed, since before that. 

 Nursi indeed undertook a difficult task and his reward is with Allâh the Most High 

alone, Who sees His righteous servants and faithful friends and the scholars who strive in 

His way and are true to His covenant, and fear not the criticisms of their accusers. 

 This present book is truly of high worth, firmly founded and containing unshakeable 

proofs. It demonstrates clearly the extraordinary power and effectiveness of Ustad Nursi 

and  contains  many  examples  of  the  precise  and  subtle  meanings  to  be  found  in  all  his 

writings, and of his specialist knowledge. This genius and talent were given to him by the 

Most  High  so  that  by  means  of  them  and  his  knowledge,  and  profound  intuitive 

understanding, and appropriate rational method he might penetrate His Word and discover 

the  truth,  and  assist  others  in  gaining  complete  certainty  concerning  the  Qur'an's 

miraculousness.  Just  as  before  him  the  learned  scholars  and  men  of  eloquence  had 

understood the importance of belief and that the Qur'an is the True Scripture revealed by 

the One All-Knowing of the 

 

#8  

Unseen to His Noble Messenger Muhammad, Upon whom be the best of peace and blessings, 

to set humanity on the path of truth and to illumine men's vision with the light of belief 
 
7 

and the understanding and certainty to become sincere bondsmen of the Lord and Sustainer 

of all the worlds. 

 Ustad Nursi wanted to develop his unique gifts by studying the Islamic sciences, and 

ancient philosophy, and the humanities and modern sciences, as well as learning Arabic 

literature  and  rhetoric  from  the  works  of  such  masters  as  al-Jâhiz,  al-Zamakhsharî,  al-

Sakkâkî, and especially the outstanding works on grammar and rhetoric of Imam 'Abd al-

Qâhir al-Jurjanî. For Nursi believed in his famous theory concerning the Qur'an's wordorder 

and indicated his admiration for it in this work. 

 The theory of the word-order was not new; al-Jurjânî did not invent it and it was 

not without precedents. For al-Jâhîz had turned his attention to it in his work Nazm al-

Qur'ân, and so had al-Wasîtî in his I'jâz al-Qur'ân fi Nazmihi, and al-Bâqillânî in I'jâz al-

Qur'ân  it  was  that  al-Jurjanî  clarified  it  fully  in  respect  of  grammar  and  rhetoric  and 

formulated a complete theory based on the absence of any disjunction between the words 

and their meaning and the form and its purport, and he established that the eloquence of 

the word-order lay neither in individual words nor in detached meanings, but in what the 

words and phrases depicted. In consequence, he defined the word-order as "some words 

being  affixed  to  others  and  some  being  placed  because  of  others;  that  is,  words  being 

positioned  as  required  by  the  science  of  grammar,  in  accordance  with  its  rules  and 

principles, and methods, without deviation from them." 

 It seems to me that Ustad Nursi studied this theory of the word-order thoroughly 

and then it became clear to him that the earlier commentators like al-Zamakhsharî and al-

Râzî and Abu Su'ûd had not attempted to apply it as a complete system treating all the 

suras, verses, and words one after the other, in all its details. So he wanted to emulate 

these great commentators but to compose a commentary in which the theory was applied 

in detail and comprehensively in respect of the structures and meanings, and the wording 

and its related sciences both intellectual and intuitive, universal and particular. He relied 

on  all  these  while  disclosing  the  Qur'an's  systematic  ordering,  through  which  its 

miraculousness  and  inimitability  become  apparent.  He  disclosed  too  and  elucidated  the 

subtle  qualities  of  the  literary  styles  and  devices  of  the  Qur'an,  which  when  it  first 

appeared  opposed  some  current  usages  of  Arabic,  and  astounded  the  Arab  orators  and 

silenced  their  eloquent  masters.  It  confronted  them  with  the  challenge  of  its 

miraculousness, and so it will till the Last Day. 

 It  was  not  only  to  prove  the  Qur'an's  miraculousness  in  respect  of  eloquence  and 

rhetoric that Nursi directed his efforts towards explicating the 

 

 

8 

#9 

theory of its word-order; it was to penetrate into the meanings of the verses. For he wanted 

to expound them in detail in the light of reason in order to set forth the main beliefs of 

Islam and demonstrate their relations with the truths of existence. 

 It is quite obvious to anyone who studies this book and its arrangement that Nursi 

wanted to write a complete commentary of this sort. If he had been destined to do this, 

he  would  have  produced  a  comprehensive  commentary  treating  both  rhetoric  and 

eloquence and laying emphasis on reason, and this would have been fit to be his life-work. 

Certainly,  it  would  have  run  to  many  volumes  if  he  had  continued  to  follow  a  method 

similar to that which we see here. 

 Allâh  the  Most  High,  however,  appointed  for  him  something  better  than  that; 

something higher and greater: to present the Qur'an to Muslims without distracting them 

with questions of rhetoric and the aspect of its miraculousness that pertains to its words. 

For the difficulties of the times prevented investigation of its finer questions, which could 

be understood only by a very few scholars. If it had been otherwise, the great majority of 

Muslims would have been unable to benefit from his unique talents and unrivalled zeal and 

faith.  And  then  they  would  have  been  unequal  to  the  awesome  ongoing  struggle  of 

civilization and ideas, despite the attacks of atheistic materialism, which was bit by bit 

infiltrating the life of Islam, and in many Muslim countries the politics, economics, society, 

culture, and science, and their proponents. 

 Consequently,  Nursi  did  not  continue  after  this  volume;  the  circumstances  of  the 

time and place thrust him into the thick of the fight, but with a new persona, called the 

New  Said,  the  mark  of  which  calmness,  gradual-ness,  and  holding  out  a  constructive 

approach,  and  affecting  the  minds  and  hearts  of  Muslims  without  emotionalism,  noisy 

agitation, confusion, confrontation, or striving for dominance. For the situation of Islam at 

the  present  time  does  not  support  such  things;  it  does  not  have  the  power  to  face  its 

powerful enemies, both external and internal. 

 With its decisive clarity, brilliant learned sedateness, highly pleasurable manner of 

expression,  and  cogent  rational  proofs,  the  Risale-i  Nur  replaces  the  former  works  the 

purpose  of  which  was  to  prove  aspects  of  the  Qur'an's  miraculousness  pertaining  to  its 

words, rhetoric, and reason in the light of its word-order. For now the Qur'an's enemies are 

not qualified to challenge its eloquence or dispute its properties related to its inimitability, 

or suras, verses, and words. So they have concentrated on launching a general assault on 

the foundations of belief and the principles of the Shari'a, and have attempted to shatter 

the moral order that the Qur'an brought. 

 

9 

 Ustad Nursi perceived the tremendous changes brought about by the new 

 

#10 

struggle and he faced them with the truths of the Qur'an, which he presented in the light 

of natural, rational logic and the sciences of his time. 

 Nursi was able to prove the Qur'an's miraculous nature on the basis of the completed 

section of his commentary comprising this present work, and to demonstrate to his readers 

and students that it is easy to adhere to his rational, learned, pleasurable way. He saw 

that  it  was  appropriate  and  sufficient,  so  he  dedicated  the  rest  of  his  life  to  the  most 

pressing question, that of saving the belief of Muslims at the time of an awesome worldwide 

struggle.  As  a  result  he  wrote  more  than  ten  books  and  numerous  treatises,  which 

represented a new way, in order to inflict intellectual defeat on the atheistic enemies of 

Islam and those pursuing Westernization. 

 It would be an injustice to the present work to suggest that it contains nothing of 

the  method  Ustad  Nursi  developed  for  the  new  struggle;  indeed,  I  can  claim  here  from 

what I have learnt about his thought through reading his works of the later period, that 

there is no idea that he expounds, explains, and expands in those works but it is found in 

concise and essential form, or is elaborated, in this learned and substantial book, especially 

his presenting the fundamental Islamic beliefs in a contemporary scientific style. However 

in this book he was addressing his select students, combining the terminology of classical 

kalam and the beginnings of his new method, which found its definitive form in the Risale-

i Nur. 

 Perhaps it was because it is a true commentary on the Qur'an that the Risale-i Nur 

was given this name, and in truth Nursi persisted in expounding the Qur'an and teaching its 

verses to Muslims until the final moments of his life, so full of tribulations and sorrows, 

and knowledge and learning and calling others to adhere to Allâh's Book and the Sunna of 

His Prophet (Upon whom be blessings and peace). 

 The  publication  of  this  book  in  new  form  offers  a  fresh  analysis  of  rhetoric  and 

eloquence to those concerned with the critical study of contemporary works on the Qur'an's 

miraculousness,  inimitability,  and  eloquence  especially  scholarly  circles.  They  will  find 

expositions of the beliefs of Islam that utilize logical reasoning, augmented by the profound 

rational and scholarly discussions that Ustad Nursi appends to his analyses of the first part

Reminder	
 THE QUR'ANIC commentary Signs of Miraculousness (Ishârât al-l'jâz) was written on 

the front in the first year of the Great War when no books or sources were available. Apart 

from the War, there were four reasons for its being written extremely concisely. Sûra al-

Fâtiha and the first half are more concise and succinct. 

 Firstly:  The  time  did  not  permit  elucidation;  the  Old  Said  expressed  what  he 

intended succinctly and briefly. 

 Secondly: He had in mind his students' level of comprehension, and they were highly 

intelligent; he did not give thought to others understanding it. 

 Thirdly: Because he was expounding the miraculousness of the Qur'an's word-order, 

which is of the greatest conciseness and subtlety, the Old Said wrote briefly and to the 

point. But I have reread it now with the New Said's eyes: in truth, notwithstanding all the 

Old Said's faults, with its elevated discussions this work is a masterpiece. Since when he 

wrote it he was in a constant state of readiness to fall in battle; and since his intention 

was pure and he wrote it in conformity with the rules of rhetoric and the sciences of Arabic, 

I [now] have been unable to refute any part of it. If Allâh so wishes, He will accept the 

work as atonement for the Old Said's sins and will raise up people who will understand it 

completely. 

 If obstacles had not arisen such as the First War, and other fascicles and letters had 

included other exegetical truths similar to the miraculousness of the Qur'an's word-order - 

one  aspect  of  its  miraculousness  -  which  is  expounded  in  this  first  volume,  a  fine 

comprehensive  commentary  would  have  been  produced  on  the  Qur'an  of  Miraculous 

Exposition. Perhaps in the future, taking this partial commentary and the sixty-six, rather, 

one hundred and thirty parts of The Words (Sözler) and Letters (Mektûbat) as its source, 

a fortunate committee will write such a commentary, God willing.

The	Author's	Note	to	the	Turkish	Edition	(1955)		

 
 EXPLAINED  below  in  three  points  are  the  reasons  many  minor  points  about  the 

relations  [between  the  words  in  the  light  of  the  science]  of  rhetoric,  which  will  not  be 

comprehensible  and  profitable  for  many  people,  are  mentioned  in  this  commentary 

interspersed among the detailed explanations of the twelve verses about dissemblers and 

two verses about unbelievers, while in the rest of the verses the nature of disbelief and 

the  doubts  clung  on  to  by  the  dissemblers  are  touched  on  only  briefly;  and  why  the 

elucidation of the subtle indications and allusions of the Qur'an's words is emphasized. 

  

  

  

First Point: Inspired by the Qur'anic teachings, the Old Said perceived that something 

would  emerge  at  this  time  similar  to  the  obdurate,  unlettered  unbelievers  of  the  early 

years  of  Islam  and  the  dissembling  members  of  former  religions,  and  he  expounded  the 

verses about the dissemblers in explanatory and detailed fashion. But so as not to cloud 

the readers' minds, he mentioned only briefly without explaining them the nature of their 

way and its bases. In any event, contrary to other 'ulama, it is the way of the Risale-i Nur 

not to mention the doubts of opponents lest they taint the readers' minds, and to give such 

answers that no place remains for suspicion or doubts. Like in the Risale-i Nur, so as not 

to confuse the readers' minds, the Old Said only gave importance in this commentary to 

the indications and allusions of the words in respect of eloquence. 

Second Point: Since the Qur'an's letters are so valuable that the reading of a single 

letter may yield ten, a hundred, a thousand, or thousands of merits and everlasting fruits 

of the hereafter, certainly the Old Said's expounding in this commentary points as fine as 

a hair or an atom related to the Qur'an's words, is not wastefulness or irrelevant, but as 

valuable as the lashes are to the eye and atoms are to the eye's pupil. He must have felt 

this, for the enemy's bullets in the skirmishing lines in that terrible war did not confuse 

him or make him abandon his writing and thinking. 

Third Point: The Turkish translation [of the author's brother, Abdûlmecid] has not 

preserved the fluency, eloquence, and extraordinary value 

12 

#13 

of the Arabic, and it is also sometimes abbreviated. I had therefore intended not to 

publish  part  of  the  lengthy  discussion  about  the  dissemblers.  But  since  it  is  about  the 

Qur'an, and even an atom about the Qur'an has high value, it will perhaps be useful for 

some people. God willing, if no obstacles arise, the Arabic commentary will be published 

following  this  translation  and  will  complete  its  deficiencies.  Moreover,  there  are  some 

wonderful instances of 'coincidences' in the Arabic, in which human will has not intervened. 

So as far as it is possible the attempt should be made to produce it similarly to that printed 

copy, so that those wonders, a sign of its acceptance, are not lost.

Statement	of	Purpose	

 THE  QUR'AN  OF  MIGHTY  STATURE  is  an  all-embracing  divine  speech  and  universal 

dominical  address  delivered  from  the  Sublime  Throne  that  addresses  all  the  classes, 

nations, and individuals of mankind in every age. So also, and especially at this time, does 

it encompass many sciences and branches of learning related to the physical aspects of the 

world, knowledge of which is beyond the capacity of a single individual or small group. 

Therefore, a commentary issuing from the understanding and imaginative power of a single 

individual, the scope of whose comprehension is very narrow with regard to time, place, 

and  specialization,  cannot  truly  expound  the  Qur'an.  For  an  individual  cannot  be 

acquainted with and be an expert in all the exact sciences and the branches of knowledge 

concerned with the spiritual and material states of nations and peoples, all of whom the 

Qur'an addresses. And he cannot be free of bias towards his own profession and discipline 

that he might explicate the truths of the Qur'an impartially. Also, a person's understanding 

is peculiar to him and he may not call on others to accept it - unless it be affirmed by a 

consensus of some sort. And his findings [and judgements] related to actions are binding 

only on himself and no one else, again unless approved by a consensus. 

 In consequence of this, a commentary should be written after minute studies and 

researches by an elevated committee of authoritative scholars each of whom is a specialist 

in  a  number  of  sciences,  proving  the  Qur'an's  subtle  meanings  and  its  fine  points  to  be 

found  scattered  through  other  commentaries,  and  its  truths,  which  become  manifest  in 

time due to the discoveries of science. Just as its legal ordinances have to be ordered and 

regulated, not according to the thought of a single individual, but by such a committee 

after being scrutinized and studied minutely by it. Thus, gaining the trust and confidence 

of the mass of the people, the committee will implicitly assume responsibility for them 

and be an authoritative source for the Muslim community. 

 Indeed, one who expounds the Qur'an should possess high intelligence, penetrating 

independent judgement, and a high degree of sainthood. But in these times in particular, 

such conditions can be met only by the brilliant 

collective personality born of the co-operation of an elevated, esteemed committee and 

the uniting of the minds of its members, of their assistance for one another and harmony 

of  spirit,  and  of  their  freedom  of  thought,  and,  being  free  of  bias,  of  their  complete 

14 

sincerity.  Only  a  collective  personality  such  as  this  can  expound  the  Qur'an.  For  in 

accordance with the rule, 'What is not found in the parts is present in the whole,' conditions 

like these which are not to be found in every individual are present in the group. 

 While awaiting, as I had for many years, the appearance of such a committee, I had 

a premonition that we were on the eve of a terrible earthquake that would lay waste the 

country. {(*): Yes, our master said while teaching us on the roof of the Horhor Medrese in 

Van that there was going to be a terrible earthquake, and exactly as he predicted, a short 

time  later  the  Great  War  broke  out.(His  students  of  the  time)  Hamza,  Mehmed  sefik, 

Mehmed Mihri} And so, in accordance with the rule, 'It is not permissible to abandon a thing 

completely even if it is not wholly obtained,' despite my impotence, faults, and difficult 

style of writing, I started to set down on my own some of the Qur'an's truths and some 

indications of the miraculousness of its word-order. Then, on the Great War breaking out I 

found  myself  in  the  mountains  and  valleys  of  Erzurum  and  Pasinler.  Whenever  the 

opportunity arose while I was performing the duty of jihad in the midst of those tumultuous 

conditions, I used to write what occurred to my heart in phrases that did not always match 

one another. Since it was not possible to have any books or commentaries to refer to, what 

I  wrote  consisted  only  of  what  occurred  to  my  heart.  If  these  inspirations  of  mine  are 

appropriate for a commentary, light of lights; if they contain contradictory aspects, these 

can be referred to my own defects. Certainly, there are places in need of correction, but 

since it was written with complete sincerity in the front lines of war among the slain, like 

it is not permissible to change the clothes and wash off blood of martyrs, I could not permit 

the ripped phrases in which it was clothed to be changed; my heart would not consent to 

it. And now it does not consent to it, for now at this time, I cannot find that utter sincerity 

and purity of heart. 

 Furthermore,  I  did  not  write  this  work  of  mine,  called  Signs  of  Miraculousness 

(Ishârat al-I'jâz), with the intention of its being a true commentary; only, in the event of 

its being well received, I wrote it as a model and source for a commentary to be written 

in the future, that treated a few aspects of Qur'anic exegesis. My eagerness drove me to 

what  was  beyond  my  power;  if  it  is  found  acceptable  it  will  give  me  the  courage  to 

continue.

What	is	the	Qur'an?	How	is	it	defined?	
 THE  QUR'AN  is  the  pre-eternal  translator  of  the  mighty  book  of  the  universe;  the 

post-eternal  interpreter  of  the  various  tongues  reciting  the  verses  of  creation;  the 

commentator of the book of the Worlds of the Seen and the Unseen; the revealer of the 

treasuries  of  the  divine  names  hidden  in  the  heavens  and  on  the  earth;  the  key  to  the 

truths  concealed  beneath  the  lines  of  events;  the  tongue  of  the  Unseen  World  in  the 

Manifest World; the treasury of the post-eternal favours of the Most Merciful and of the 

preeternal  addresses  of  that  Most  Holy  One,  that  come  from  the  World  of  the  Unseen 

beyond the veil of this Manifest World; it is the sun, foundation, and plan of the spiritual 

world of Islam; the sacred map of the worlds of the hereafter; the expounding word, lucid 

exposition, decisive proof, and clear interpreter of the divine essence, attributes, names, 

and functions; it is the instructor of the world of humanity; the light and water of Islam, 

the macroanthropos; the true wisdom of mankind; and the true guide and leader urging 

humanity to prosperity and happiness; it is both a book of law, and a book of prayer, and 

a book of wisdom, and a book of worship, and a book of command and summons, and a 

book  of  invocation,  and  a  book  of  thought;  it  is  a  unique,  comprehensive  sacred  book 

comprising many books to which recourse may be had for the needs of all mankind; it is a 

revealed  scripture  resembling  a  sacred  library  that  offers  treatises  suitable  for  all  the 

various ways and different paths of the all the saints and the veracious ones and the wise 

and the learned, which is appropriate for the illuminations of each way and enlightens it, 

and is suitable for the course of each path and depicts it. 

 Since  the  Qur'an  has  come  from  the  Sublime  Throne  and  the  greatest  name,  and 

from the highest degree of each name, it is Allâh's Word in regard to His being Lord and 

Sustainer (Rabb) of all the worlds; it is a divine decree through His title of God of All Beings; 

it is an address in the name of the Creator of the Heavens and the Earth; it is a conversation 

in respect of absolute dominicality (rubûbiyet) it is a pre-eternal discourse on account of 

universal divine sovereignty; it is a notebook of the favours of the Most Merciful from the 

point of view of all-embracing, all- 

encompassing divine mercy; it is a collection of addresses at the start of which are certain 

ciphers related to the tremendousness of divine majesty; and through its descent from the 

 

#17 

 

16 

comprehensiveness of the greatest name, it is a holy scripture full of wisdom that looks to 

and inspects all sides of the Sublime Throne. 

 It is because of this mystery that with complete fitness the title of the Word of Allâh 

has been given to the Qur'an, and is always given. After the Qur'an comes the level of the 

books and scriptures of the other prophets. However, those other innumerable divine words 

are each in the form of inspiration made manifest through a special regard, a partial title, 

a  particular  manifestation,  a  specific  name,  a  special  dominicality,  a  particular 

sovereignty, a special mercy. The inspirations of the angels and man and the animals vary 

greatly with regard to universality and particularity. 

 The Qur'an is a revealed scripture which contains in summary the books of all the 

prophets, whose times were all different, the writings of all the saints, whose paths are 

all different, and the works of all the purified scholars, whose ways are all different. Its 

six aspects are all brilliant and free of the darkness of doubts and scepticism; its point of 

support is certain heavenly revelation and the pre-eternal Word; its aim and goal is self-

evidently eternal happiness; its inner aspect is clearly pure guidance; its upper aspect is 

necessarily the lights of belief; its lower aspect is undeniably evidence and proof; its right 

aspect is evidently the surrender of the heart and conscience; its left aspect is manifestly 

the subjugation of the reason and intellect; its fruit is indisputably the mercy of the Most 

Merciful and the realm of Paradise; and its rank and desirability are assuredly accepted by 

the angels and man and the jinn.

 In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 

 The Most Merciful. * It is He who has taught the Qur'an. * He has created man. * He 

has taught him [articulate thought and] speech. (55:1-4) 

 We offer Him praise and thanks, and seek His blessings for His Prophet, whom He 

sent as a mercy to all the worlds, and through its signs and indications made his greatest 

miracle encompass the universe's truths, so to remain permanently through the passage 

of time till the Day of Requital, and for all his Family and Companions. 

So know firstly that our aim from these indications, is a commentary on a number of 

the symbols of the Qur'an's word-order, for [one aspect of] its miraculousness is manifested 

in its word-order. Indeed, the embroidery of its word-order is its most brilliant [form of] 

miraculousness. {[*]: See, Nursi, İsârâtû'l-İ'caz [Turk, trans. Abdûlmecid Nursî]} 

And  know  secondly  that  the  fundamental  aims  of  the  Qur'an  and  its  essential 

elements  are  fourfold:  divine  unity  (al-tawhîd),  prophethood  (alnubûwwa),  the 

resurrection  of  the  dead  (al-hashr),  and  justice  (al-'adâla).  For  when  mankind,  like  a 

successive  caravan  and  procession,  departs  from  the  valleys  of  the  past  and  its  lands, 

travels in the deserts of existence and life and proceeds towards the heights of the future, 

facing towards its 

 

#20 

gardens, events shake men and the universe turns its face towards them. It is as though 

the  government  of  creation  sends  natural  philosophy  [or  science]  (fann  al-hikma)  to 

interrogate and question them, saying: "O mankind! Where are you from? Where are you 

going? What are you doing? Who is your ruler? And who is your spokesman?" At one time 

during this conversation there stood up one from among mankind - as did those like him of 

the prophets with authority - the lord of mankind Muhammad alHashimi (UWBP), and said 

through the tongue of the Qur'an: "O philosophy! All of us beings we come forth emerging 

by the power of the PreEternal Ruler from the darkness of non-existence to the light of 

existence,  and  all  of  us,  we  sons  of  Adam,  were  sent  as  officials  privileged  above  our 

brother creatures in bearing the Trust; we are on our way, journeying on the road of the 

 

19 

ٰ
resurrection towards eternal felicity; and we are busy in this world in preparation of that 

felicity  and  the  development  of  the  potentialities  that  are  our  capital;  and  I  am  their 

master and their spokesman. Here it is before you, my manifesto, which is the word of the 

Pre-Eternal Ruler, on which sparkles the stamp of miraculousness." Thus, the answerer of 

these questions, the correct answer, is none other than the Qur'an, that book - the answer 

is those four fundamental principles. 

 Just as the four aims are seen in the whole of the Qur'an, so they are manifested in 

every sura; indeed, they are hinted at in every phrase or alluded to in every word; because 

each part is like a mirror to the whole ascending, just as the whole is seen in each part 

successively. And by this point I mean that by this participation of the part (al-juz') in the 

whole (alkull), the Qur'an is made known as a totality (al-kul li) with constituent parts (al-

juz'iyyât). {[*]: That is, every part of the Qur'an is a whole Qur'an. See, Nursi, Ishârât al-

I'jâz [Abdûlmecid], 327.} 

  

If you were to ask: Show me these four aims in "Bismillâh - In the Name of Allâh" 

and "al-hamdulillâh - all praise be to Allâh." 

 You  would  be  told:  Since  "Bismillâh"  was  revealed  in  order  to  instruct  [the  Most 

High's] servants, 'Say!' (Qul) is implicit in it and essentially it is implied by [all] the words 

of the Qur'an. So according to this, there is in 'Say!' (Qul) an indication to prophethood; 

and in "Bismillâh" a sign to the Godhead; and in the prefixing of [the preposition] "bi-" of 

"Bismillâh"  a  sign  to  divine  unity;  {[*]:  The  genitive  construction  here  (Jârr  wa  majrûr) 

expresses  restriction.  See,  Nursi.  Ishârât  al-I'jâz  [Abdûlmecid],  23.}  and  in  "the  Most 

Merciful (al-Rahmân)" an allusion 

 

#21 

to the order [of the universe, and therefore to] justice and beneficence; and in "the Most 

Compassionate (al-Rahîm)" a hint to the resurrection of the dead. Likewise, in "all praise 

be  to  Allâh  (al-hamdulillâh)"  is  an  indication  to  the  Godhead;  and  in  the  lâm  of 

specification (the "li-" of "li-llah") a sign to divine unity. And in "Lord and Sustainer of all 

the worlds (Rabb al'âlamîn)" is a hint to justice, and also to prophethood, for the education 

of mankind is given by the prophets. And in "Master of the Day of Judgement (Malik yawm 

al-dîn)"  is  an  explicit  statement  of  resurrection.  Likewise,  the  shell  of  Innâ  a'taynaka'l-

kawthar {[*]: Sura 108, Sûrat al-Kawthar, one of the shortest of the Qur'an's suras.} contains 

these pearls [of the Qur'an's four main aims]. This is an example, so carry on in the same 

way. 

 

20 

 

  

 

 "In	the	name	of	Allâh	(Bismillâh)" is like the sun, which illumines itself as well 

as others and is self-sufficient. Thus, the "In (bi-)" is related to the verb that is implicit in 

its meaning; that is, "I seek help from it;" or the meaning usually associated with it; that 

is,  "I  swear  by  it."  Or  it  is  related  to  the  implicit  'Say!'  (Qul),  which  necessitates  a 

subsequent 'recite!' or 'read!' (iqrâ') to denote sincerity and divine unity. {[*]: Related to 

and following the genitive construction, these implied verbs denote restriction, which in 

turn denotes sincerity and divine unity. See, Nursi, lsârâtû'1-l'caz [Abdûlmecid], 24.} 

 As  for  "name  (al-ism)"  know  that  Allâh  has  names  pertaining  to  His  essence,  and 

names pertaining to various sorts of action, such as Forgiving, Provider, Giver of Life, and 

Dealer of Death, and so on. They are various and numerous because of the multiplicity of 

the  relations  of  His  pre-eternal  power  with  the  different  kinds  of  beings.  Therefore, 

"Bismillâh" is an invocation, seeking the agency and connection of divine power, that its 

connection might be a spirit for man and a help for him in his actions. 

"Allâh:" the proper name of Allâh is a comprehensive summary of all the attributes 

of perfection, for it implies the Essence, unlike other proper nouns, in which there is no 

necessary implication of attributes. 

	"The	Most	Merciful,	the	All-Compassionate	(al-Rahmân	al-Rahîm)"	
 
 The positioning: just as divine glory (jalâl) and its concomitants are manifested in 

sequence from the name of Allâh, so too divine beauty (jamâl) and its concomitants appear 

in sequence from the Most Merciful, the All-Compassionate (al-Rahmân al-Rahîm). Since 

Glory and Beauty are two sources, there appear in sequence from them by virtue of their 

being manifest in every world, branches like command and prohibition, reward 

 

#22 

so on. 

 

and punishment, inducement and threat, glorification and praise, and fear and hope, and 

 Also, just as the name of Allâh indicates the attributes that are identical with His 

Essence and indicate His freedom from defect (al-sifât al-'ayniyya wa'l-tanzihiyya), so "All-

Compassionate  (al-Rahîm)"  hints  at  the  attributes  that  are  other  than  His  Essence  and 

pertain to action (al-sifât al-ghayriyya al-fi'liyya). As for "Most Merciful (al-Rahmân)," it 

21 

indicates the seven attributes that are neither identical with nor other than His Essence 

(lâ 'ayn wa lâ ghayr), since it has the meaning of the Provider (al-Razzâq) and consists of 

the bestowal of continuance. For continuance is the repetition of existence; and existence 

necessitates  a  distinguishing  attribute,  a  specifying  attribute,  and  an  effectuating 

attribute, and these are Knowledge, Will, and Power. Continuance, which is the result of 

the  bestowal  of  sustenance,  entails  the  certainty  of  Sight,  Hearing,  and  Speech,  for 

necessarily the Provider has sight in order to see the need of the recipient of providence 

if he does not seek it; and He has hearing in order to hear the recipient's word when he 

asks; and He has speech in order to speak through intermediaries, when there are some. 

And these six necessitate the seventh, which is Life. 

-If you were to ask: The precedence of "Most Merciful (al-Rahmân)" which indicates 

great bounties, over "All-Compassionate (al-Rahîm)," which indicates minute bounties, is 

the art of descending from great to small (san'at al-tadalli). While eloquence requires an 

ascent from lowest to highest (san'at al-taraqqi)! 

 You would he told: The latter is appended to the former in order to complete it, 

like  eyebrows  complete  the  eyes  and  the  bridle  the  horse.  Similarly,  when  the  great 

depends on the minute the minute gains the superiority, like the key to the lock and the 

tongue  to  the  spirit.  Furthermore,  this  context  (lit.  station  -  al-maqâm)  being  one  of 

drawing attention to the bounties [rather than enumerating them or evoking gratitude for 

them], to alert [the reader to this fact since it is] less obvious is more appropriate. So the 

art of descending from great to small when (lit. in the context of) enumerating bounties 

and evoking gratitude for them becomes the art of ascending from small to great when 

alerting [the mind to them] and pointing them out. 

-If  you  were  to  ask:  Like  such  concepts  as  tender-heartedness,  Merciful  and 

Compassionate  cannot  be  used  in  reference  to  Allâh.  If  what  is  meant  by  these  is  their 

results, which here would be the bestowal of bounty, what is the reason for the metaphor? 

#23 

 

You would be told: The reason is that of the allegorical verses (mutashâbihât): {[*]: 

Meanings that cannot be applied literally to God Almighty, such as "the hand" in the verse, 

"The hand of Allâh is over their hands." 48: 10) See, Nursi, İsârâtul-I'caz [Abdûlmecid], 26.} 

it is divine condescension to human intellects; making something familiar to the mind and 

inducing  it  to  understand,  like  one  speaks  to  a  child  in  terms  he  is  accustomed  to  and 

22 

  

  

 

familiar with. The mass of the people gather their information from their senses and they 

do not look at sheer truths except in the mirror of what they imagine them to be and from 

the point of view of that to which they are accustomed. Moreover, the aim of the phrase 

is  to  convey  the  meaning,  and  this  is  not  achieved  except  by  affecting  the  heart  and 

emotions, and by clothing the truth in a style familiar to the one addressed; in this way his 

heart is prepared to accept it. 

"[All]	praise	(al-Hamd)"	
 Its positioning as regards what precedes it: 

 Since  "the  Most  Merciful  (al-Rahmân)"  and  "the  All-Compassionate  (alRahim)" 

indicate  the  [divine]  bounties  and  favours,  they  necessitate  praise.  Furthermore,  "All 

praise be to Allâh (al-hamduli'llâh)" is repeated in four suras in the Qur'an, {[*]: Suras al-

An'âm, al-Kahf, Sabâ', al-Fâtir.} each repetition referring to one of the principal bounties, 

which are the first creation and the continuation of it, and the last creation and its ensuing 

continuation. 

 

 

 

 Its positioning here: 

 ["All praise be to Allâh (al-hamduli'llâh)"] being put at the opening of the Fatiha of 

the Qur'an is like putting the conception of the Qur'an's ultimate purpose in the forefront 

of the brain. For praise is a concise form of worship, which is the result of creation, and 

of knowledge of Allâh, which is the purpose and aim of the universe. So to mention praise 

is  to  conceive  of  the  Qur'an's  ultimate  purpose.  Indeed,  Allâh  (May  He  be  exalted  and 

glorified) says: "I created not the jinn and men except that they might worship." (51:57) 

 Furthermore,  there  is  the  well-known  meaning  of  praise:  the  display  of  the 

attributes of perfection. 

 How this is achieved: Allâh created man and made him a comprehensive summary 

of the universe and an index of the book of the world, which comprises eighteen thousand 

worlds, and lodged in his essence a sample from each, in which is manifested one of His 

names. If man spends all of what is bestowed on him in the way of that for which he was 

created, for 

 

 

 

 

23 

#24 

the purpose of offering thanks, a sort of praise, and obeying the Shari'a, which removes 

the rust of nature, each of those samples becomes a map [illuminating] his world, and a 

mirror reflecting it and the attribute manifested in it and the name it displays. In this way, 

with both spirit and body, man becomes a summary of the worlds of the seen and unseen, 

and  manifests  what  is  manifested  in  them.  Through  offering  praise  he  becomes  both  a 

place of demonstration and a demonstrator of the attributes of perfection. This is implied 

by what Muhyi al-Din al-'Arabi said in explanation of the Hadith: "I was a hidden treasure, 

so I created creation that they might know Me." That is, I created creation to be a mirror 

in which I might observe My beauty. 

	"[Be]	to	Allâh	(li'	llâh)"	
 That is, praise (hamd) is particular to and fitting only for the Most Pure and Holy 

Essence, who although specified is described by the concept of the Necessarily Existent 

One. For sometimes something specific may be thought of in general terms. The letter lâm 

(the li- of li-llah) here is dependent on the verb implied by its meaning, as though it had 

absorbed the verb's meaning. In the lâm is also a sign to sincerity and divine unity. 

	"Lord	and	Sustainer	(Rabb)"	
 That is, He who raises and sustains the universe with all its component parts, each 

of which is a world like the greater world, with all its atoms, like its stars dispersed, in 

motion, in order. 

 Know  that  Allâh  (May  His  glory  be  exalted)  appointed  for  everything  a  point  of 

perfection  and  deposited  in  each  an  inclination  towards  it,  as  though  commanding  it 

through  this  inclination  to  set  out  for  the  point  of  perfection.  In  its  journey  each  thing 

stands in need of what will help it and what will repulse the things that hinder it, and this 

is the sustaining of Allâh. If you study the universe, you will see that it resembles human 

groups and nations, with each individually and collectively employed in the duties its Maker 

has  appointed  for  it,  striving  diligently,  obeying  the  laws  of  its  Creator.  How  surprising 

therefore is man, in his being an exception! 

#25 

 

 

 

24 

	"Of	all	the	worlds	(al-'âlâmîn)"	
 The yâ and nûn [that is, the two final letters] denote either a grammatical ending 

as  in  the  numbers  twenty  ('ishrîn)  and  thirty  (thalâthîn),  or  the  [sound]  plural.  For  the 

components of the worlds are worlds, or the world is not limited to the solar system. As 

the poet says: 

 Praise he to Allâh, how numerous are His celestial spheres! µ 

Among 

them 

circulate the stars, and the sun and the moon. 

 The sound plural, [properly used] for rational beings, as in the verse "Ra'aytuhum li 

sâjidîn (I saw them prostrate themselves before me)," (12:4) indicates that [the science 

of] rhetoric conceives of all the components of the world as living and rational, speaking 

through the tongue of disposition. For the world ('âlam) is so-called because through it the 

Maker is known (yu'lam), and it bears witness to Him and points to Him. Thus, the raising 

and sustaining of beings and their making known their Maker indicate, like the prostration, 

that they are as though conscious. 

 

 

	"The	Most	Merciful,	the	All-Compassionate	(al-Rahmân	al-Rahîm)"	
 
 Their positioning: they point to the two fundamentals in raising and nurturing. For 

in its meaning of Provider (al-Razzâq), Most Merciful infers the attraction of benefits, while 

in  its  meaning  of  Oft-Forgiving  (alGhaffâr),  All-Compassionate  is  conformable  with  the 

repulsion of harm, and these are the two basic principles of raising and sustaining. 

 "Master of the Day [of Judgement] (Mâlik Yawm al-Din)" 

 That is, the day of resurrection and requital. 

 The positioning: 

 it is as though it is the result of what precedes it, for mercy (rahma) is one of the 

proofs of resurrection and eternal felicity. For mercy can only be mercy, and bounty can 

only be bounty when the Resurrection arrives and eternal felicity comes about. Otherwise, 

on thinking of eternal separation, intelligence, which is one of the greatest bounties, would 

be a calamity for mankind, and affection and compassion, which are the most refined kinds 

of mercy, would be transformed into severe pain. 

 -If you were to ask: Allâh is always the owner of everything, so why is the Day of 

Requital specified? 

 

 

 

25 

#26 

 You would be told: It is specified in order to indicate that apparent causes, which 

Allâh  has  put  in  the  world  of  change  to  demonstrate  His  sublimity  -  lest  the  direct 

functioning of the Hand of Power be seen by the mind's eye in matters that appear to be 

lowly in their outward (mulk) aspect, will be raised on that day, and their inner aspect 

(malakûtiyya) will be manifested clearly and transparently. Then all things will see and 

know their Lord and Maker without intermediary. 

 And in the term "the Day (al-yawm)" is an allusion to one of the conjectural signs of 

the resurrection, related to the evident correspondence between a day and a year, and 

the life of man and the cycle of the earth. So it is between the hands of a clock that count 

the seconds, the minutes, the hours, and the days. Thus, the person who sees that one 

hand  has  completed  its  revolution  will  surmise  that  the  others  will  complete  their 

revolutions  too,  even  if  with  delay.  Similarly,  the  person  who  sees  the  repeated 

resurrections of the species in the examples of the day and the year will surmise that the 

spring  of  eternal  felicity  will  be  born  on  the  morning  of  the  Day  of  Resurrection  for 

mankind, one individual of which is like a species. 

 What  is  meant  by  "al-Din"  is  either  requital,  that  is,  the  day  of  requital  for  good 

deeds and bad, or of the truths of religion; that is, the day they will rise and be totally 

manifested, and the sphere of belief will prevail over the sphere of causes. For by relating 

causes to effects, Allâh has deposited an order in the universe through His will, and obliged 

man through his nature, illusions, and imagination, to comply with the order and be bound 

to it. Moreover, He directed all things towards Himself and is far above the effect of the 

causes in His dominions (mulk). He charged man in belief and faith, to comply with this 

sphere with his conscience and his spirit, and be bound to it. For in this world, the sphere 

of causes predominates over the sphere of belief, while in the next world the truths of 

belief will be manifested as supreme over the sphere of causes. 

 Know  too  that  each  of  the  two  spheres  has  its  appointed  position  and  particular 

rules, so each should be given its due. Thus, the person who looks from the position of the 

causal world with his nature, delusions, and imagination, and the criteria of causes towards 

the sphere of belief is forced to be Mu'tazilite, while a person who looks from the position 

of belief and its criteria with his spirit and conscience towards the sphere of causes will 

end up displaying a lazy sort of trust and obstinate opposition to the will of the Orderer.

pronoun iyyâka]: 

	"You	alone	do	we	worship	(Iyyâka	na'budu)"	
 Two  points  may  be  made  concerning  the  letter  kâf  [  in  the  detached  accusative 

 The first of them is that by reason of the direct form of address [that is, the change 

to the second person after the use of the third], the pronominal suffix "-ka - you" implies 

the  attributes  of  perfection  mentioned  previously.  For  the  previous  mention  [of  the 

attributes] one after the other stimulates the brain, preparing it, filling it with enthusiasm, 

and directing the attention to the One described. Thus, "You alone (iyyâka)" means "O You 

Who is qualified by these attributes!" 

 The  second  point:  the  use  of  the  second  person  indicates  that  according  to  the 

science  of  rhetoric  the  meanings  should  be  dwelt  on,  for  then  it  will  be  read  as  it  was 

revealed, and this will lead the person to make the address naturally and enthusiastically. 

Hence, "You alone (iyyâka)" implies compliance with [the Hadith] "Worship your Lord as if 

you were seeing Him." {[*]: See, al-Tabarânı, Sahih al-Jâmi' al-saghîr, 1049. It's complete 

form is narrated by alBukhari and Muslim. See, Nursî, Ishârât al-I'jâz [Ihsân Qasim], 30.} 

 The use of the first person plural in "do we worship (na'budu)" has three aspects: 

firstly,  we  worship,  all  of  us  members  and  atoms  of  the  microcosm  that  is  myself,  by 

offering the thanks expressed by all these members and atoms complying with that which 

they  have  been  commanded.  Secondly,  all  of  us  monotheists,  we  worship  You  through 

obedience to your Shari'a. And thirdly, all of us beings, we submit totally to your Supreme 

Shari'a  of  Creation,  and  we  prostrate  in  bewilderment  and  love  at  the  throne  of  your 

 "Do we worship (na'budu)" elucidates and expounds "praise" (alhamd). [That is, it 

explains the form praise should take.] It is the result of "Master of the Day of Judgement 

(mâlik al-yawm ad-din)" and necessitates it. [That is, "We worship Him alone because He 

is the Owner of all things."] {[*]: See, Nursi, İsârâtû'l-İ'caz [Sağlam], 31.} 

 Know too that the precedence of "You alone (iyyâka)" infers sincerity, the essence 

of worship, while the use of the second person indicates the reason for worship, for the 

One qualified by these attributes, which call for direct address, is worthy of worship. 

awesomeness and power. 

The positioning: 

  

 

 

 

27 

#28 

 

 

	"And	from	You	alone	do	we	seek	help	(wa	iyyâka	nasta'în)"	
 In respect of the three groups mentioned above, this is the same as "You alone do 

we worship:" all of us members of man the microcosm, and us monotheists, and us beings, 

we seek help and assistance from You for all our needs and aims, the most important of 

which  is  worship.  The  "You  alone  (iyyâka)"  is  repeated  to  increase  the  pleasure  of  the 

address and sense of presence; and because the station (maqâm) of meeting face to face 

is higher and more exalted than the station of proof [in the absence of the one addressed]; 

and because presence calls for truthfulness and not for lying; and because worship and the 

seeking of help are two different, independent aims. 

  

The positioning of "do we seek help" and "do we worship:" you should understand 

that the relationship between them resembles the relationship of wages with service. For 

worship is Allâh's right over His bondsman [worship is a form of service], and the help is 

His bountiful bestowal [or reward]. {[*]: . See, Nursi, İsârâtû'l-İ'caz [Abdûlmecid], 31.} 

 In the exclusivity implied by the precedence of You alone is an indication to the fact 

that through the noble relation that is worship and the service of Allâh, the bondsman is 

raised  up  from  subjection  to  causes  and  intermediaries;  indeed,  the  causes  become  his 

servants,  and  since  he  recognizes  the  One  alone,  [for  him]  the  sphere  of  belief  and 

conscience  will  come  to  dominate,  as  mentioned.  The  person  who  is  not  truly  Allâh's 

servant becomes a slave to causes and is abased by intermediaries. However, while in the 

sphere of causes the bondsman should not neglect causes altogether lest he comes to rebel 

against the order established by divine wisdom and will. For misplaced reliance on Allâh 

while in the sphere of causes is laziness, as discussed. This is like the relationship of the 

antecedent and the aim, for help and grace are the preliminaries of worship. 

	"Guide	us	(Ihdinâ)"	
 The positioning: it is the bondsman's reply to Allâh's question, as if He asks: "What 

aim is closest to your heart?" and the bondsman replies: "Guide us!" 

 Know that because of its several levels of meaning, it is as if "Guide us" is derived 

from the four sources [or verbal nouns - masdar] of the act of guidance. For its recipients 

may be divided into those who are guided, those who seek guidance, and those who seek 

increase in guidance. 

 

28 

#29 

So "Guide us" means: make us firm in guidance if we are a society; increase us in 

guidance if we are a community; make us successful in guidance if we are a tribe; give us 

guidance if we are a group. 

 Also, according to the verse, "Who gives unto every thing [that exists] its true nature 

and form, and thereupon guides it," (20:50) Allâh guided us by giving us external and inner 

senses; then He guided us by placing evidences in the outside world and in ourselves; then 

He guided us by sending prophets and revealing books. And then He guided us with the 

greatest guidance, which was that by removing the veils from the truth, it appeared as 

truth and falsehood appeared as falsehood. 

 O Lord! Show us what is indeed the truth and empower us to follow it, and show us 

the false for what it is, and enable us to avoid it. 

	"The	Straight	Path	(al-sirât	al-mustaqîm)"	
 Know that the Straight Path is justice, consisting of the blending and summary of 

wisdom (hikma), chastity (iffa), and courage (shajâ'a), which are the mean or middle way 

of the three degrees of man's three powers. 

 To explain: when Allâh (May He be exalted and glorified!) housed spirit (ruh) in man's 

body, which is changing, needy, and exposed to dangers, He deposited three powers in it 

to ensure its continued existence. 

 The First: the power of animal appetites to attract benefits. 

 The Second: the power of savage passion to repulse harmful and destructive things. 

 The Third: the power of angelic intellect to distinguish between benefit and harm. 

 However,  since  His  wisdom  necessitated  that  humanity  should  achieve  perfection 

through the mystery of competition, Allâh placed no innate limitation on these powers, as 

He did on those of other living beings. He did however limit them through the Shari'a, for 

it prohibits excess (ifrât) and deficiency (tafrît) and enjoins the middle way (wasat). This 

is what is inferred by the verse "Pursue then the right course as you have been bidden." 

(11:112) In the absence of any innate limitation, three degrees arise in the three powers: 

the  degree  of  deficiency,  which  is  negligence;  the  degree  of  superabundance,  which  is 

excess; and the middle way, which is justice. 

 Thus, deficiency in the power of intellect is stupidity and foolishness, and its excess, 

perfidious deception and over-meticulousness in trivialities, and its middle way is wisdom. 

"He who has been given wisdom, has been given great good." (2:269) 

 

 

29 

#30 

 Know that just as the power varies in these degrees, so does each of its branches 

vary. For example, in the question of the creation of actions, the middle way is that of the 

Sunni School between the Jabriyya and the Mu'tazila, and in the question of doctrine, the 

school of divine unity is the middle way between the denial of the divine attributes (ta'til) 

and anthropomorphism (tashbîh). You can make further examples in the same way. 

 Deficiency in the power of animal appetites is apathy and want of appetite, while 

its  excess  is  profligacy,  which  is  to  desire  whatever  is  encountered  whether  lawful  or 

unlawful. Its middle way is uprightness, which is desiring what is licit and shunning what is 

illicit. You may apply the principle applied to this power to any of its branches, such as 

eating, drinking, dressing, and so on. 

 Deficiency in the power of savage passion is cowardice, that is, fear of what is not 

to  be  feared  and  delusive  imagining.  Its  excess  is  uncontrolled  anger,  which  is  the 

progenitor of despotism, domination, and tyranny. And its middle way is courage, which is 

giving freely of oneself with love and eagerness for the defence of the laws of Islam and 

the upholding of the Word of divine unity. Apply this same principle to each of its branches. 

 The six extremes are thus tyranny and the three middle ways are justice, which is 

the Straight Path and is to act in act in accordance with "Pursue then the right course as 

you  have  been  bidden."  (11:112)  Whoever  passes  along  this  way  will  cross  the  bridge 

suspended over the Fire. 

 

'alayhim)"	

	The	 path	 of	 those	 whom	 You	 have	 blessed	 (Sirât	 alladhîna	 an'amta	

 Consider this: the positioning of the Qur'an's words like pearls is not on one string, 

but in a multiplicity of embroideries resulting from the interweaving of lines of different 

relationships, close and distant, apparent and hidden. For the basis of the miraculousness 

after the conciseness is this embroidery. 

 For example, "The way of those whom You have blessed (Sirât alladhîna an'amta 

'alayhim)" has a relationship with "All praise be to God" because bounty (al-ni'ma) is the 

corollary of "praise;" 

 -and  with  "Lord  and  Sustainer  of  all  the  worlds"  because  perfect  sustaining  and 

raising is through the continual bestowal of bounties (alni'am); 

 -and with "the Most Merciful, All-Compassionate," because the recipients of bounty 

- I mean the prophets, the martyrs who witness to the 

 

30 

#31 

(din) is the perfect bounty; 

to their request for help; 

truth, and the righteous - are a mercy to the worlds and evident exemplars of mercy; 

 -and with "Owner of the Day of Judgement (mâlik al-yawm ad-din)," because religion 

 -and with "do we worship," because they are foremost in worship; 

 -and with "do we seek help," because they have been graced with success in response 

 -and  with  "Guide  us,"  because  according  to  the  meaning  of  "Follow  then  their 

guidance," (6:90) they are the finest models; 

 -and with "the Straight Path," because clearly the straight path is confined to their 

way. This is an example, so carry on in the same way. 

 In  the  word  "path  (al-sirât)"  is  an  indication  that  their  way  is  passable,  and  has 

restricted sides so that those who travel down it will not stray from it. 

 In "those whom (alladhîna)" -since it is a relative pronoun and it is the function of 

the  relative  pronoun  to  describe  things  known  to  the  listener-  is  an  indication  to  the 

exaltedness of their rank, and their refulgent shining in the darkness of mankind, as if they 

are obvious to all listeners even if they do not search or enquire. While its being plural 

indicates the possibility of following their way, and corroborated by the constant consensus 

concerning  it,  its  Tightness,  since  "Allâh's  power  is  with  the  community."  {[*]:  This  is  a 

Hadith  the  original  of  which  is  given  by  al-Tirmidhi  as  "The  hand  of  Allâh  is  over  the 

community," al-'Ajlûnî, Kashf al-Khafâ', ii, 391. For more details, see, Nursi, Ishârât al-I'jâz 

[Ihsân Qasim], 34.} 

 In the use of the perfect tense for "You have blessed (an'amta)" is a hint to the means 

of requesting further bounty. And its use of the second person, addressing Allâh directly, 

indicates that it is an intercessor, as though one is saying: "O my God! You are the bestower 

of bounty and in Your grace have bestowed it before; so bestow it on me again, even though 

I am not worthy." 

 And  in  "on  them  ('alayhim)"  is  an  indication  to  the  heavy  burden  that  is  divine 

messengership and the bearing of the Trust, and a sign that the Messengers are like high 

mountains on which pour down torrents of rain so that the plains may be flooded. As one 

part of the Qur'an expounds another, how beautifully "Those whom You have blessed" is 

expounded by "[they] are in the company of those on whom is the grace of Allâh - of the 

prophets, the veracious, the witnesses, and the righteous" (4:69)! 

 

 

31 

 -If you were to ask: The outlooks of the prophets are all different and their ways of 

worship are diverse. What is the reason for this? 

 

#32 

 You  would  be  told:  The  prophets  are  all  followed  in  the  principles  of  faith  and 

fundamental rules, for these are constant and fixed; unlike secondary matters, the nature 

of which is to change in the course of time. Just as the four seasons and the stages in a 

person's life warrant different remedies and clothing - what is a cure at one time may cause 

illness at another - so the stages of the life of humanity necessitate differences in rules of 

secondary importance, which are healing for spirits and nourishment for hearts. 

	"Not	of	those	who	earn	Your	anger	(ghayri'	l-maghdûbi	'alayhim)"	
  

The positioning: know that in being a 'station' of fear and flight, this station has a 

relationship with those preceding it. For a person looks in bewilderment and terror towards 

the station of dominicality signified by Glory and Beauty; he looks seeking refuge towards 

the station of worship in "do we worship;" in his impotence he looks towards the station of 

reliance  in  "do  we  seek  help,"  and  seeking  consolation  he  looks  towards  its  constant 

companion; that is, the station of hope and relief. For what occurs first to the heart of one 

who  sees  something  terrifying  is  a  sense  of  bewilderment,  then  he  wants  to  flee,  then 

having realized his impotence it occurs to him to rely on Allâh, and then he receives solace. 

 

 

 -If you were to ask: Allâh (May He be exalted) is All-Wise and SelfSufficient, so what 

is the wisdom in the creation of evil, ugliness, and misguidance in the world? 

 You would be told: Know that perfection, good, and beauty are essentially what are 

intended in the universe, and are in the majority. Relatively, defects, evil, and ugliness 

are  in  the  minority,  and  are  insignificant,  secondary,  and  trivial.  Their  Creator  created 

them interspersed among good and perfection not for their own sakes, but as preliminaries 

and units of measurement for the appearance, or existence, of the relative truths of good 

and perfection. 

 -If you were to ask: So what is the importance of the relative truths for the sake of 

which partial evil is approved? 

 You would be told: Relative truths are the ties between beings and the threads with 

which their order is woven. They are the rays from which is reflected each unique being of 

 

32 

the species in the universe. Relative truths are thousands of times more numerous than 

real truths, for if the real attributes of a person were sevenfold, the relative truths would 

be seven hundred. A lesser evil may therefore be forgiven, approved even, for the sake of 

the greater good. For to abandon the greater good because it contains 

#33 

some lesser evil, is a greater evil. And in the view of wisdom, if the lesser evil encounters 

the  greater  evil,  the  lesser  evil  becomes  a  relative  good,  as  has  been  established  in 

principle  in  zakât  and  jihâd,  for  example.  As  is  well-known,  "things  are  known  through 

their  opposites,"  which  means  that  the  existence  of  a  thing's  opposite  causes  the 

manifestation and existence of its relative truths. For example, if there were no ugliness 

and it did not permeate beauty, the existence of beauty with its infinite degrees would 

not be apparent. 

 -If you were to ask: What is the reason for the different forms of the following three 

words: "an'amta - You have blessed" being a verb, "almaghdûb - earn [Your] anger" being a 

passive participle, and "ad-dâllin - those who go astray" being an active participle? Also, 

what is the reason for the following differences being mentioned: the attribute of the third 

group, the outcome of the second, which is the result of its attributes, and the exact terms 

of the first? 

 You  would  be  told:  The  term  bounty  (or  blessings)  is  chosen  because  bounty  is  a 

delight to which the spirit inclines, and it is in the past tense because this intimates that 

it is the mark of the Absolutely Generous One not to take back what He gives. By drawing 

attention to this practice of the Bestower of Bounty, it also suggests a way of reaching 

what is requested, as if one was saying: "Since it is Your practice to bestow bounties and 

You have bestowed them previously, bestow them on me too." 

 As  for  "Not  of  those  who  earn  Your  anger,"  by  it  is  meant  those  who  exceed  the 

limits of the power of passion, and have committed injustice and depravity by abandoning 

the  rules.  Since  there  is  in  the  essence  of  depravity  and  injustice  an  evil  pleasure  and 

vicious  pride  that  do  not  sicken  the  soul,  the  Qur'an  mentions  a,consequence  that  does 

sicken it, and that is the descent of divine wrath. The fact that a passive participle has 

been  chosen  implies  continuation  and  this  is  an  indication  that  rebelliousness  and  evil 

become ineradicable characteristics if they are not halted by repentance and forgiveness. 

 

 

 

 

33 

	"Nor	of	those	who	go	astray	(wa	lâ	dâllin)"	
 This refers to those who have strayed from the path because delusion and passion 

have overridden the intellect and conscience, and they have fallen into hypocrisy through 

false belief. The Qur'an has chosen to describe it thus because misguidance is itself pain; 

the soul is sickened by it, and the spirit avoids it even it has not seen its result. And the 

active participle has 

 

#34 

been chosen because misguidance will be misguidance so long as it is not halted. 

 Know too that all pain lies in misguidance and all pleasure is found in belief. If you 

wish, consider the state of a person whom the Hand of Power has taken out of the darkness 

of non-existence and flung into the world, that vast and frightening desert. When he opens 

his eyes seeking compassion, he sees afflictions and calamities besetting him like enemies. 

Seeking mercy, he looks to the elements and natural causes, and finds them stonyhearted 

and relentless, baring their teeth at him. Seeking help he raises his gaze to the celestial 

bodies  and  sees  them  awesome  and  bewildering;  threatening  him  as  though  they  were 

projectiles of fire issuing from huge mouths and encircling him. In bewilderment he lowers 

his  head,  and  shielding  it,  starts  to  ponder.  Then  he  hears  the  thousand  screams  of  his 

needs and the moaning of his wants. Fearfully, he looks to his conscience seeking relief, 

and is met with thousands of vast and overwhelming hopes which cannot be satisfied in 

this world. For God's sake, what is the state of this person if he does not believe in the 

first creation and the resurrection of the dead, and in the Creator and Last Judgement? Do 

you imagine the sufferings of Hell would be severer for him, searing his soul more terribly? 

For  his  state  is  one  of  compounded  anxiety,  terror,  impotence,  trembling,  fearfulness, 

orphanhood, and despair. If he considers his power, he will see himself to be impotent and 

weak. If he tries to quieten his needs, he will realize that they cannot be quietened. If he 

shouts  and  calls  for  help,  he  will  not  be  heard  and  he  will  not  be  helped.  He  supposes 

everything to be hostile. He imagines everything to be strange, so feels no familiarity. He 

does not look to the revolutions of the celestial bodies except with fear, bewilderment, 

and fright, which disturbs his conscience. 

 Now consider the state of this person if he is on the Straight Path and his conscience 

and spirit are illuminated with the light of belief: you will see that when he enters this 

world, opens his eyes, and beholds the assaults of all the things around him, he discerns a 

support  on  which  to  lean  in  the  face  of  these  onslaughts,  and  this  is  recognition  of  the 

Creator, so he will find rest. 

 

34 

 Then if he examines his innate disposition, potentialities, and hopes, which extend 

to eternity, he will perceive a source of assistance. He seeks help from it for his hopes, for 

from it is drawn the water of life, which is knowledge of eternal felicity. And if he raises 

his head and looks at the universe, he will feel a familiarity with everything; he will sense 

familiarity 

 

#35 

and affection coming from every flower. He will see in the motions of the heavenly bodies 

the wisdom of their Creator, and he will receive pleasure from their progress. Gazing on 

them, he will take a lesson and reflect. It is as if the sun is beckoning to him, saying: "My 

brother! Don't be frightened of me, I welcome your arrival. Both of us are servants of the 

One Being, obedient to His command." The moon, the stars, the sea, and their sisters will 

call each with her particular tongue. Waving to him, they will say: "Welcome! Don't you 

know us? We are all busy in the service of your Owner. Do not feel dismay or fright, nor be 

distressed by the threat of the calamities with their bared teeth, for the reins of all things 

are in your Creator's hand." 

 Thus, in the first situation, the person feels a terrible distress in the depths of his 

conscience. He will be compelled to rid himself of it and to soothe and deaden his senses 

through diversions, feigning unawareness and busying himself with trivia, so to deceive his 

conscience and numb his spirit. He will otherwise feel an acute pain in the depths of his 

conscience, and its effect will be apparent to the degree he is distant from the true path. 

As for the second situation, there the person feels in the depths of his spirit a great delight 

and  immediate  happiness.  Whenever  his  heart  awakens  and  his  conscience  stirs  and  his 

spirit is moved, his happiness will increase and he will receive the good news that the doors 

of a spiritual paradise are being flung open to him.

Sura	al-Baqara	

(The first of the two Radiant Suras) 

{[*]: In is narrated from Abû Umâma al-Bâhilî: "I heard Allâh's Messenger (UWBP) say: 

'Read the Qur'an for on the Last Day (the resurrection of the dead) it will be an intercessor 

for  its  adherents.  Read  the  two  Radiant  Suras  (al-Zahrawayn),  al-Baqara  and  Sura  Âl-i 

'Imrân...'" al-Hâkim, al-Mustadrak (Beirut, n.d.), i, 553, 554; ii, 287. For other sources see, 

Abdûlkadir Badıllı, Risale-i Nur'un Kudsî Kaynakları (Istanbul: Envar Nesriyat, 1994), 810.} 

If you were to ask: The Qur'an is both miraculous and concise, yet in it some things 

are  apparently  frequently  repeated,  such  as  the  Bismillâh  (In  the  Name  of  Allâh,  the 

Merciful, the Compassionate), and the verses "Then which of the favours of your Lord and 

Sustainer will you deny?" (55:13, 16, 18 etc.) and "Ah woe that Day to the rejecters of 

truth!  (77:15,  19,  24  etc.)  and  the  story  of  Moses.  Aren't  such  repetitions  tedious  and 

contrary  to  eloquence?  {[*]:  For  a  discussion  on  repetition  in  the  Qur'an,  see  the  Tenth 

Topic of the Eleventh Ray (written 1944). Nursi, The Rays Collection [Eng. trans.] (Istanbul: 

Sözler Publications, 1998), 262-72.} 

 You  would  be  told:  Everything  that  shines  does  not  scorch.  Yes,  repetitions  are 

sometimes  tedious,  but  not  always.  Sometimes  they  are  boring,  and  sometimes 

appreciated and admired. The food man eats includes both basic sustenance and fruit. The 

more the former is repeated, the greater the pleasure it affords; it gives strength and the 

body becomes accustomed to it. But the latter gives rise to boredom when repeated and 

provides pleasure when replaced with something new. 

 In  just  the  same  way,  some  words  and  speech  are  reality  (haqîqa)  and  basic 

sustenance; they strengthen the mind and feed the spirit. The more they are repeated, 

the better they seem and the more familiar they become, like sunlight. Then others are 

like fruits and embellishments; they give pleasure on being varied in respect of sort and 

appearance (lit. apparel). 

#36 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

#37 

on. 

 Having understood this, you should know that as a whole the Qur'an is sustenance 

for  hearts  and  strength,  and  its  repetition  causes  not  boredom,  but  for  the  most  part 

delight and pleasure. Similarly, in the Qur'an are parts that are the spirit of that sustenance 

and strength; the more they are repeated, the more brilliantly they shine, scattering lights 

of truth and reality. Among these latter are some like the "Bismillâh (In the Name of Allâh, 

the  Merciful,  the  Compassionate)"  that  are  essential  principles,  sources  of  life,  and 

embodied  eternal  lights.  Savour  them,  if  you  have  any  taste!  But  this  is  dependent  on 

acceptance of the repetitions. The story of Moses may be taken as an example: in each 

place (maqâm) [it is found, it is repeated] for one of the aspects it comprises. It is more 

useful than the parts of his staff; the Qur'an takes it as silver in its white, shining hand and 

pours it out as gold so that the sorcerers of rhetoric prostrated before its eloquence. 

 Similarly, in the "Bismillâh" there are different facets, some expressing the seeking 

of help and blessings; some looking to the subject [of the sura in question], indeed, its 

aim; others indicating that it is an index of the fundamental points of the Qur'an. 

 Also contained in the "Bismillâh" are different levels [of meaning], those of divine 

unity  (tawhîd),  and  declaring  Allâh  free  of  human  attributes  (tanzîh),  and  praise,  and 

divine glory (jalâl) and beauty (jamâl), and that of working righteousness (ihsan), and so 

 The "Bismillâh" also infers various ordinances: for instance it indicates divine unity, 

prophethood, the resurrection of the dead, and justice; that is, the Qur'an's well-known 

four [main] aims. Most suras have [only] one of them as its primary aim, while the rest are 

secondary.  So  why  shouldn't  one  of  the  Bismillâh's  facets  or  ordinances  or  levels  [of 

meaning] have a particular relation with the spirit of the sura [in question], and be the 

topic of that context, indeed, a concise index of all those aspects and levels?

(The Disjointed Letters) 

Verse	1	

 ٓﻟا ٓﻢ  

 "Alif. Lam. Mîm." There are four topics related to these. 

First Topic 

 The Qur'an's miraculousness and inimitability rise from the horizon of the Disjointed 

Letters,  for  it  is  a  light  manifested  from  the  blending  of  the  corruscating  subtleties  of 

eloquence (or rhetoric - al-balâgha). This topic contains many fine points, but whatever 

their tenuousness a true dawn breaks from their totality. 

 Firstly: "Alif'. Lâm. Mîm." together with the other Disjointed Letters at the start of 

some suras, their sisters, consist of half the letters in the alphabet, the basic elements of 

all words. That is, the Qur'an uses half the twenty-eight letters and disregards half. Ponder 

over this! 

Alif. and Lâm. 

 Secondly: The half its takes are more commonly used than those it leaves. 

 Thirdly: Of the letters it takes, the Qur'an repeats those easiest on the tongue, like 

 Fourthly: It mentions the Disjointed Letters at the start of twenty-nine suras, which 

corresponds to the number of letters of the alphabet. {[*]: If Hamza is counted, there are 

twenty-nine letters in the Arabic alphabet.} 

 Fifthly: It takes half of those letters that have pairs, like the concealed (mahmûsa), 

the  emphatic  (majhûra),  the  stressed  (shadîda),  the  soft  (rakhwa),  and  the  musta'liya, 

munhafida,  and  munfatiha  letters,  and  the  rest  of  them.  Of  those  that  have  no  pairs 

(awtâr), it takes fewer of the 'heavy' like the tremolo (qalqala), and more of the 'light,' 

like the labiolinguals (dhallâqa). 

 Sixthly: Those it uses of these are finer in character. 

 Seventhly: The way the Qur'an has chosen for [selecting] the Disjointed Letters is 

one out of five hundred and four possibilities, and this is the only possible way of halving 

the letters [of the alphabet] with their particular 

38 

#39 

 

characters.  For  the  divisions  [into  different  groups  of  letters]  are  interwoven  and  one 

within the other, as well as being dissimilar. Each of these divisions is truly remarkable 

and  singular.  So  if  a  person  fails  to  appreciate  the  light  of  miraculousness  born  of  the 

blending of these rays, he has only his own lack of discernment to blame. 

Second Topic 

 "Alif'. Lam. Mîm." are each like the rap of a knocker; they rouse the listener, alerting 

him  through  their  singularity  that  they  are  the  harbingers  of  something  strange  and 

remarkable. This topic also contains a number of subtleties. 

 Firstly: The disjointing of the letters and their being spelled out by name indicates 

that what they signify is of the same kind as themselves. 

 Secondly:  These  letters  being  disjointed  indicates  that  what  they  signify  is 

assumedly one and not compound. 

 Thirdly: The spelling out of the letters by disjoining them is an indication that it is 

alluding to the material of the art, as though providing pen and paper for those wanting to 

dispute them by writing. It is as if the Qur'an is saying: "Hey you obstinate rivals, you're the 

masters of fine speech! You have at your disposal the materials I had when I devised these. 

You do likewise if you can!" 

 Fourthly: Being devoid of meaning, the disjointing of the letters indicates that [the 

Qur'an's] opponents have been left without proof. For they say: "We don't know the facts, 

stories, and ordinances that we might dispute you." So it appears the Qur'an is saying: "I 

only want you to produce [something similar to] the eloquent ordering (nazm al-balâgha) 

[of the letters], even if it's made up." 

 Fifthly: Calling the letters by their names is the custom of scholars and writers. But 

both the one uttering this speech and those listening to him were unlettered. Considering 

its character, therefore, the letters being in this unexpected form infers that "this speech 

is not his but was imparted to him." 

 Sixthly: Spelling out letters syllable by syllable is particular to learners of reading 

and writing. It is understood from this then that the Qur'an was establishing a new way and 

was teaching illiterate people. 

Those who cannot see the elevated art in the interweaving of these lines - though 

admittedly some are very fine - are novices to the art of eloquence, so should apply to its 

  

adepts! 

 

39 

#40 

Third Topic 

 "Alif. Lâm. Mîm." indicate the ultimate conciseness, which is the second of the two 

principles of [the Qur'an's] miraculousness. This topic comprises a number of fine points. 

 Firstly:  "Alif.  Lâm.  Mîm."  indicate,  allude  to,  hint,  intimate,  and  suggest  the 

[following]  successive  allegorical  comparison  (al-qîyâs  al-tamthîlî  almutasalsîl):  "This  is 

the  pre-eternal  speech  of  Allâh,  which  Gabriel  brought  down  to  Muhammad  (Peace  and 

blessings be upon them both)." For sometimes the ordinances laid down in the whole Qur'an 

are  set  out  in  summary  in  a  single  long  sura;  and  sometimes  a  long  sura  is  represented 

allusively in a short one; and sometimes a short sura is included symbolically in a single 

verse; and sometimes a verse is indicated in a single sentence; and sometimes a sentence 

is  hinted  at  in  a  single  word;  and  sometimes  too  such  a  comprehensive  word  may  be 

discerned in the disjointed letters, like in Sin. Lâm. Mîm. Similarly, the whole Qur'an may 

be discerned in Surat alBaqara; and al-Baqara in Surat al-Fatiha; and al-Fatiha in "Bismillâh 

alRahmân  al-Rahîm;"  and  "Bismillâh  al-Rahmân  al-Rahîm"  in  a  chiselled  or  sculpted 

"Bismillâh."  The  same  goes  for  "Alif.  Lâm.  Mîm."  On  the  strength  of  this  successive 

allegorical comparison, and as indicated by "That is the Book," manifested from "Alif. Lâm. 

Mîm." [is the meaning]: "This is Allâh's pre-eternal speech, which Gabriel brought down to 

Muhammad (Upon whom be blessings and peace)." 

 Secondly:  The  Disjointed  Letters  are  divine  cyphers  communicated  by  [the  Most 

High]  to  His  Messenger,  with  whom  is  the  key,  to  which  the  human  mind  has  not  yet 

attained. 

were explicit and clear. 

 Thirdly: "Alif. Lâm. Mîm." show the acute intelligence of the one to whom they were 

revealed,  for  he  understood  what  was  only  allusive,  symbolic,  and  obscure  as  though  it 

 Fourthly: The disjointing of these letters indicates that the value of the letters lies 

not  in  their  meanings  but  in  their  natural  mutual  relationships,  like  the  relationships 

between numbers. The science of the hidden properties of letters ('ilm asrâr al-hurûf) has 

discovered these relationships. 

 Fifthly: In particular, "Alif. Lâm. Mîm." indicate by their being disjointed the three 

main  points  of  articulating  sound:  the  throat,  the  mouth,  and  the  lips.  And  this  in  turn 

infers that the attention will be caught and the veil of familiarity rent, driving one to study 

the wondrous colours of the embroidery of the letters' creation. 

 You who is washed in the colours of the art of eloquence! Assemble the 

 

 

40 

various pieces of these fine points and gaze on them as a whole, then listen to their reciting 

#41 

 

to you: "This is Allâh's Word!" 

Fourth Topic 

 It is as though when "Alif. Lâm. Mîm." and their sisters appear in this form that they 

are declaring: "We are leaders; we imitate no one and follow none. Our style is original 

and our manner, singular." This topic too contains a number of subtleties. 

 Firstly:  It  is  the  custom  of  orators  and  eloquent  speakers  to  always  adhere  to 

patterns and embroider examples and to follow well-trodden paths. But these letters are 

virginal, untouched by man or jinn. 

 Secondly: From beginning to end, the Qur'an is as it was at first. Although out of 

their longing, its friends have wanted to imitate it, and likewise its enemies out of their 

desire to challenge it, it has never been imitated nor has anything similar been achieved. 

If you want proof of this, take a look at the millions of Arabic books! Are any equal to the 

Qur'an,  or  even  close  to  it?  No!  Even  an  ignorant  illiterate  would  exclaim  if  he  were  to 

compare them to it: "The Qur'an is not of their level!" It is either inferior to all of them, 

and this is impossible; or it is superior, and this is as it should be. It would fall to his lot to 

perceive this much of its miraculousness. 

 Thirdly: It is the mark of human art that at first it emerges crude and deficient in 

many respects. It is dry and lacking in grace. Only later is it perfected and made pleasing. 

The Qur'an's style, however, was graceful, fresh, and young when it first appeared, and it 

still challenges the human mind, which has grown old through the combining of ideas and 

plagiarizing them. It has triumphed over all of them, proclaiming through its victory that 

it is the art of the Creator of all powers and destiny. 

 O you who sniffs at the breeze of eloquence! Doesn't the bee of your mind gather 

from the blossoms of these four topics the honey of "I testify that this is the Word of Allâh!"?

Verse	2	
 ِﻘﱠﺘُﻤْﻠِﻟ ىًﺪُھ ِﮫﯿِﻓ  َﺐْﯾَر َﻻ  ُبﺎَﺘِﻜْﻟا َﻚِﻟ ٰذ

 

 َﻦﯿ

 That is the Book concerning which is no doubt, guidance sure for those who fear 

Allah. (Dhâlize al-kitâb lâ rayba fi-hi hudan li'l-muttaqîn.) 

Introduction 

 Consider this: one of the principles of eloquence that beautifies speech making it 

sparkle is that all the sentences and words respond to each other and evoke each other 

while looking to the underlying aim. Thus, to the extent of its power each strengthens the 

aim,  which  is  like  the  confluence  of  rivers  or  a  pool  fed  from  all  sides,  confirming  and 

illustrating the saying: 

loveliness. 

 Our  phrases  are  diverse  but  your  beauty  is  one  And  each  of  us  points  to  that 

 Consider,  for  example,  the  verse  "But  if  a  breath  of  your  Sustainer's  punishment 

touches them" (21:46) it frightens by alluding to a small amount of punishment, like two 

negatives making a positive. It points out the terribleness of the punishment by showing 

the severity of the least amount. 

 Don't  you  see  how  the  word  "if  (wa  la'in)"  signifies  doubt,  and  doubt  looks  to 

littleness or fewness; and the word "touches (massa)" means to touch lightly and expresses 

a small amount; and the word "a breath (nafha)" is merely a whiff and is in the singular 

form, which express littleness or fewness, as does the tanwin indicating indefinitenes; and 

the partitive "of (min)" signifies division or a part; it means a bit and indicates paucity; and 

the  word  "punishment  (adhâb)"  points  to  a  light  sort  of  punishment  rather  than 

chastisement  (nakâl),  and  suggests  a  small  amount;  and  by  alluding  to  compassion,  the 

word "Lord and Sustainer (Rabb)" indicates littleness or fewness?

slight. 

 Now compare the others with this and see how each in its particular way assists the 

main  aim.  Make  analogies  with  this  verse  for  its  brothers.  Especially,  "Alif  Lâm.  Mîm.  * 

That is the Book concerning which is no doubt, guidance sure for those who fear Allâh" - 

for its purpose is to praise the Qur'an and prove its perfections. The parts of the verse all 

point harmoniously to this aim: in one respect, the oath [expressed by] "Alif. Lâm. Mîm.-" 

and  "that  (dhâlika)"  being  a  demonstrative  pronoun  and  denoting  tangible  things  and 

distance; the definite article 'al' in "the Book (al-kitâb)" and the proof [indicated by] "in 

which there is no doubt (lâ rayba fih)." Each of these phrases assists the main aim, adding 

its own share, revealing from beneath it the evidences that rest upon it, even if they are 

 If  you  wish,  consider  "Alif.  Lâm.  Mîm.:"  in  so  far  as  it  is  an  oath,  it  is  both 

corroborative, and it imparts the idea of [the Qur'an's] greatness. So too, as proof of what 

it is alluding to, it draws attention to the subtleties underlying [the letters], mentioned in 

the four Topics above. 

 Now consider the demonstrative pronoun "that (dhâlika)-." it is used to refer to the 

essence and attributes [of tangible things], and so both denotes [the Qur'an's] greatness - 

because it indicates either what "Alif. Lâm. Mîm." are alluding to, or what is foretold in 

the Torah and Gospels - and it points to the evidences underlying it. So how great, how 

perfect is the thing sworn by [that is, the Qur'an], that is foretold in the Torah and Gospels! 

 Next scrutinize carefully this demonstrative pronoun, which although properly used 

for tangible things, here alludes to something mental (al-amr al-ma'qul), and you will see 

that  just  as  it  infers  greatness  and  importance,  so  it  indicates  that  the  Qur'an  attracts 

minds  like  a  magnet,  drawing  everyone's  gaze  upon  itself  and  preoccupying  their 

imaginations.  [The  'mental'  Qur'an]  is  therefore  shown  to  be  at  such  a  level  that  if  one 

consults  one's  imagination  even  it  will  appear  behind  it.  Thus,  by  its  very  nature  [this 

demonstrative pronoun] infers that [the Qur'an] is veracious and trustworthy and free of 

weakness and trickery, since these should be concealed. 

 Then ponder over the distance suggested by the 'lika' of "dhâlika that:" it indicates 

both the Qur'an's elevated rank, which points to its perfection, and that it is far above any 

attempts  to  imitate  it.  For  it  is  either  inferior  to  all  of  these  [attempts],  and  this  is 

impossible as is unanimously agreed, or it is superior to all. 

 Next  study  the  definite  article  "al"  of  "the  Book  (al-kitâb):"  since  it  expresses 

restriction, it indicates the Qur'an's sublimity and opens the door to comparison, and hints 

that it not only gathers together in itself the 

 

43 

#44 

virtues  of  all  the  [revealed]  scriptures,  but  adds  to  them  and  is  therefore  the  most 

complete of them. Then dwell on the expression "the Book" and see how it hints that it 

could not be the fabrication of someone unlettered who knew neither reading nor writing. 

 "Concerning which is no doubt (la rayba fih)" 

 There are two aspects to "concerning which (lit. in) (fihi):" [the pronominal suffix -

hi] refers either to [this] statement or to "the Book." According to the first, [as asserted 

by] al-Miftâh, {[*]: Miftâh al-'Ulûm by Sirâj al-Dîn al-Sakkâkî (d. 626/1228), about language, 

literature, and poetry. It was the most comprehensive work of his time on 'ilm al-bayân. 

See, Kashf alZunun. See, Nursi, lsharât al-l'jâz [Ihsan Qasim], 58.} it means "certainly and 

without doubt," so is further indirect proof of [the Qur'an's] perfection. According to the 

second, as stated by al-Kashshâf {[*]: al-Kashshâf'an Haqaiq al-Tanzil by Mahmtid ibn 'Umar 

al-Zamakhshari (d. 538 H.)} it confirms the existence of the Qur'an's perfections. And both 

say that from beneath "concerning which is no doubt (lâ rayba fîh)" whispers the verse, 

"And if you are in doubt as to what We have revealed step by step to our servant, then 

produce a Sura like thereunto," (2:23) pointing to its specific evidence. And because the 

[negating particle] "la" of "concerning which is no doubt (lâ rayba fih)" is absolute, it dispels 

all possible doubts, and also recites the lines: 

 How many correct words are thought to be faulty, While their only fault lies in the 

hearer's understanding, {[*]: al-Mutanabi, Diwan. See, Nursi, Ishârât al-I'jâz [Ihsan Qasim], 

It indicates too that the Qur'an cannot give rise to doubts, for within it are such signs 

and indications that from all sides they mass together and repulse the assaulting doubts. 

 And in the adverbiality (or 'containing' - zarfiyya) of "concerning which (lit. in) (fihi)" 

and  the  choice  of  "fi"  in  place  of  other  prepositions  is  a  sign  that  one's  gaze  should 

penetrate  to  the  Qur'an's  interior  and  that  its  truths  will  chase  away  any  unfounded 

suspicions that may alight on its exterior due to a superficial view. 

 Friend!  Now  that  you  have  discerned  the  value  of  [this]  compound  [sentence] 

through analyzing it, and perceived the difference between the whole and its parts, take 

a glance at its words and phrases and see how each contributes its share to the joint aim 

with its own particular evidence, and how the light of eloquence flares up on every side. 

47.} 

 

 

 

 

 

44 

#45 

Consider  this:  the  reason  the  phrases  "Alif.  Lâm.  Mîm.  *  That  is  the  Book  ... 

concerning which is no doubt... guidance sure for those who fear Allâh" are not linked by 

conjunctions is their intense union and mutual embrace; each seizes the hand of the one 

preceding it and the coat tails of the one following it. For in one way each is proof of all 

of them and in another it is their result. 

 [The  Qur'an's]  miraculousness  is  inscribed  on  this  verse  [as  though  it  were]  an 

embroidery woven of twelve intricately interwoven lines of relations. If you would like to 

see it in detail, [firstly] study "Alif. Lâm. Mim," for they imply this meaning: "These [letters] 

are issuing a challenge; is there anyone to answer it?" Then consider "That is the Book" for 

it states clearly that it surpasses all its fellows and has superseded them, thus inferring 

that it is exceptional and without peer. Then ponder over "concerning which is no doubt," 

for it states explicitly that there is no room for doubt, thus proclaiming that [the Qur'an] 

is illumined with the light of certainty. Then consider "guidance sure for those who fear 

Allâh;" for it is informing you that it points out the straight path and is an embodied light 

of guidance. Thus, in respect of the first meaning each phrase is a proof of its fellows, and 

in regard to the second meaning all are the result of each of them. 

 Now, by way of example, we shall mention three of the twelve relations, and you 

can make analogies with them for the rest. 

 "Alif. Lâm. Mîm.:" that is, this book challenges all who oppose it; it must therefore 

be  the  best  of  books;  it  therefore  expresses  certainty;  for  the  best  book  is  one  that  is 

certain; so it must be embodied guidance for mankind. 

 Then "That is the Book:" that is, this book is superior to anything resembling it so it 

must  be  miraculous.  Or,  it  is  exceptional  and  distinguished;  for  there  is  no  doubt 

concerning it; because it points out the level path to those who fear Allâh. 

 Then,  "Guidance  sure  for  those  who  fear  Allâh:"  that  is,  it  guides  to  the  straight 

path; so it must be certain; so it is exceptional; so it is miraculous. 

 You can now deduce the rest for yourself. 

  

"Guidance sure for those who fear Allâh (hudan li'l-muttaqîn)" 

 You should be aware that the beauty of this phrase wells up from four points: 

 The  First:  The  omission  of  the  subject,  which  indicates  that  the  subject  and 

predicate  have  united  and  that  the  statement  [expressed]  is  accepted.  As  though  in 

essence the subject is within the predicate, and they are not differentiated between in 

the mind even. 

 

45 

 The Second: The substitution of the active participle by the verbal noun. 

#46 

in which is an allusion to the fact that the light of guidance has been embodied and become 

the very substance of the Qur'an. Like if the colour red is embodied, it becomes carmine. 

{[*]: A topical allusion in so far as this commentary was written immediately before and 

during the early part of the First World War, for carmine was the colour adopted by and 

symbolic of the Armenians. It was obtained from cochineal, the pressed dried bodies of 

insects. See, Nursi, Ishârât al-I'jâz [Ihsan Qasim], 48.} 

 The Third: The use of the indefinite for "guidance (hudan)," which alludes to the 

infinite subtlety of the Qur'an's guidance, the essence of which is unfathomable, and to its 

utmost breadth, which is unencompassable by knowledge. For the indefinite infers either 

subtlety and concealment, or unencompassable breadth. It is because of this that it is used 

sometimes to disparage and sometimes to exalt. 

 The  Fourth:  The  conciseness  of  "for  those  who  fear  Allâh  (li'lmuttaqîn)"  which  is 

used  instead  of  a  longer  phrase  like  "the  people  who  have  become  pious  through  the 

Qur'an," indicates the result rather than what precedes it (al-majâz al-awwal), and points 

to the fruits of guidance and its effects. This hints at the argument from effect to cause 

(al-burhân al-innî) for the existence of guidance. So the listener in one century has the 

evidence of preceding centuries, just as he will be evidence for those that succeed him. 

-If you were to ask: How can eloquence that is beyond human power be born of these 

  

few points? 

 You would be told: A great mystery lies in mutual assistance and union. For by virtue 

of the mystery of reflection, when three beautiful things come together, they become five; 

and  five  become  ten;  and  ten  become  forty.  For  in  each  is  a  sort  of  reflection  and  it 

represents  [the  beauty]  to  a  degree.  Like  there  appear  to  be  many  mirrors  when  two 

mirrors are put face to face; or if you shine a lamp at them, the reflection of its rays will 

increase the light. Similar to this is the combining of a number of points. It is also due to 

this mystery that you will see that the beautiful and the accomplished all have a natural 

inclination to join with others similar to them so as to increase their beauty. Stones even, 

despite their being only stones, incline towards their brothers on leaving the builder's hand 

for their places in a domed roof, and bow their heads to touch those of their brothers and 

holding  all  together,  they  do  not  fall.  The  human  being  then  who  fails  to  perceive  this 

mystery of mutual assistance is more lifeless than a stone, for some stones are such they 

bend over backwards to co-operate with their brothers! 

 

46 

#47 

all these? 

 -If you were to ask: It is the mark of guidance and eloquence to elucidate, provide 

clear explanations, and to save minds from confusion. But the Qur'anic commentators have 

been at variance over verses like this and have suggested different possibilities, and have 

propounded conflicting aspects of the phrases. So how can the truth be recognized among 

 You would be told: All are right, for the listeners vary greatly. For the Qur'an was 

not revealed for the people of only one century, but for the people of all the centuries; 

nor for only one class, but for all the classes of mankind; and each of these has its own 

share and part in understanding the Qur'an. Between people there are vast differences of 

understanding,  and  their  tastes  vary  greatly,  and  they  incline  to  different  sides  of  the 

Qur'an, and appreciate different aspects of it, and their pleasures are diverse, and their 

temperaments  are  all  different.  How  many  things  there  are  that  one  nation  deems 

beautiful which another does not even notice, and which one enjoys greatly while another 

does not even recognize their existence. You can draw further analogies in the same way. 

 It is because of this mystery and instance of wisdom that in most places the Qur'an 

is  not  specific  and  makes  its  statements  general  so  that  everyone  can  appraise  them 

according to their own taste and appreciation. The Qur'an has ordered its sentences and 

positioned them in such a way that numerous different possibilities unfold from its various 

aspects, and [different people with] their diverse understandings may reflect on them and 

each  may  receive  his  share.  You  can  make  further  analogies.  That  is  to  say,  all  these 

different  aspects  are  permissible  on  condition  they  are  not  opposed  to  the  sciences  of 

Arabic, are approved by the science of rhetoric (eloquence), and are acceptable to the 

science of the principles and aims of the Shari'a. Thus, it emerges from this point that one 

of  the  aspects  of  the  Qur'an's  miraculousness  is  its  word-order  and  its  arrangement  in  a 

style that conforms to the understandings of the people of all ages and all classes.

Verse	3	
 ِﺐْﯿَﻐْﻟﺎِﺑ  َنﻮُﻨِﻣ ْﺆُﯾ  َﻦﯾِﺬﱠﻟَا 

 Who believe in the Unseen, are steadfast in prayer, and spend out of what We have 

provided  for  them.  (Alladhîna  yu'minûna  bi'l-ghayb  wa  yuqîmûna  al-salât  wa  mimma 

razaqnâhum yunfiqûn.) 

 "Who believe in the Unseen (alladhîna yu'minûna bi'l-ghayb)" 

 Consider this: the positioning of this verse and the previous one in respect of their 

essential meanings is this, that the praise of the Qur'an in the previous verse has a bearing 

on the praise of believers in this one, and the one flows into the other. For the praise of 

believers is a result of the former; it is a proof from effect to cause (al-burhân al-innî); a 

fruit of the Qur'an's guidance and a witness to it; and by [the praise in this verse] being 

encouragement it shows that it has a share of that guidance and is an example of it. 

 As for the positioning of "who (alladhîna)" and "those who fear Allâh (,al-muttaqin)" 

[and the relationship between them], it [denotes] emptying or clearing (takliliyya), and 

adorning  (tahliyya),  which  is  the  eternal  companion  of  the  former.  That  is,  adornment 

after purification (tanzîh). Do you not see that taqwâ is the renunciation of evils and that 

the Qur'an mentions it as having three stages: the giving up of associating partners with 

Allâh (shirk), the giving up of sin, and the giving up of all things other than Allâh? While 

adornment is to perform good acts, either inwardly with the heart, or physically, or with 

property. Now, the sun of interior acts is belief (îmân), and the index of physical acts is 

the salât or ritual prayers, which are "the pillar of religion," {[*]: Tirmidhî, îmân, 8; Ibn 

Mâja,  Fitan,  12;  Musnad,  v,  231;  al-Hâkim,  al-Mustadrak,  ii,  76.}  and  the  pivot  of  acts 

related to property is the purification tax (zakât), which is "the bridge of Islam." {[*]: al-

Mundhiri, al-Targhib wa'l-Tarhib, i, 517.}

(alladhîna yu'minûna bi'l-ghayb)" in respect of its position, you would see that it should be 

concise, yet if you compare it to its synonym 'the believers' (al-mu'minûn), it will strike 

you as prolix. For the definite article "al" has been exchanged for "alladhîna - who," whose 

function as a relative pronoun is to qualify through the relative clause the noun it governs. 

[It  is  the  relative  clause  then  -  not  the  relative  pronoun  -  that  has  importance  since  it 

qualifies the subject. The construction here then draws attention] to belief, encouraging 

it  and  exalting  it.  This  is  a  sign  too  that  belief  illuminates  the  one  professing  it  like  a 

lighthouse  so  that  his  other  attributes  wane  and  fade  away.  And  "[they]  believe 

(yu'minûna)"  has  been  substituted  for  'believers'  (mu'minûn)  in  order  to  depict  this 

praiseworthy situation for the imagination. It is also a sign that belief is renewed through 

its  continued  existence  and  is  manifested  through  the  succession  of  evidences,  both 

exterior and interior. Yes, the clearer the evidences, the firmer is belief. 

 By "in the Unseen (bi'l-ghayb)" is meant that they believe with the heart, that is, 

sincerely without prevarication, even when alone. And they believe in what is unseen and 

 So know that belief is a light produced by affirming in detail all the essentials of 

religion  brought  by  the  Prophet  (Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace)  and  the  rest  in 

in the World of the Unseen. 

general. 

 

the truths of belief clearly? 

 -If you were to ask: Only one out of a hundred ordinary people are able to express 

 You would be told: The inability to state something clearly does not indicate its non-

existence. Mostly, the tongue is incapable of interpreting the subtleties of what the mind 

conceives  of.  Similarly,  the  intellect  cannot  contemplate  the  hidden  secrets  ûf  the 

conscience, so how should it interpret all of them? Don't you see that for all his intelligence, 

a genius and master of rhetoric like al-Sakkâkî failed to harvest the fine points produced 

spontaneously by a nomad like Imri' al-Qays, {[*]: Imri' al-Qays (?497-545 A.D.), the most 

famous of all Arab poets of the Jâhiliyya. He was the author of one of the Seven Hanging 

Odes, in the Ka'ba.} or someone similar. In consequence, one can establish whether or not 

an  ordinary  person  believes  by  questioning  him  and  seeking  an  explanation.  You  can 

question  him  both  positively  and  negatively,  saying:  "O  you  common  man!  Is  it  possible 

according to your way of thinking that the Maker in the grasp of Whose power are all six 

aspects of the world, should be present in just one place of

#50 

it?" If he replies negatively, then the fact that Allâh is beyond the restrictions of space is 

firmly established in his conscience, and that is sufficient for him. You can think of further 

examples in the same way. 

 Know too that as expounded by Sa'd, {[*]: Sa'd al-Din al-Taftâzâni, born in Taftazan 

in Khurasan in 712 H (or 727 H) and died in Samarqand in 793 H. He was an authority in the 

sciences of Arabic, logic, and fiqh. He strove to revive the Islamic sciences after the Mongol 

invasion. Among his works are Tahzib alMantiq, Sharh al-Maqasid and Sharh al-'Aqaid al-

Nasafiya.}  belief  is  a  light  that  Allâh  (May  He  be  exalted)  instils  instantaneously  in  the 

hearts  of  those  of  His  servants  that  He  wishes  -  that  is,  after  they  have  used  their  will 

power. Yes, belief is a light for the human conscience, a ray from the Pre-Eternal Sun, that 

suddenly bathes in light the conscience's inner face. It affords it a feeling of familiarity 

with all the universe and establishes relations between it and all things. It imparts such 

moral strength to a person's heart that he can overcome all the events and misfortunes 

that beset him. It affords him such breadth he can endure the past and the future. Yes, as 

belief is a ray from the Pre-Eternal Sun, so it is a flash of eternal happiness, that is, of the 

resurrection of the dead. Through the light it emits, the seeds of man's hopes sprout, and 

the  potentialities  lodged  in  his  conscience  start  to  grow  and  to  stretch  out  towards 

eternity, and the seeds of his abilities are transformed into a Tree of Tuba. 

  

"Are steadfast in prayer (Wa yuqîmûna al-salât): 

 Consider this: the positioning [of this phrase and its relationship with the previous 

one] is as clear as daylight. For the salât being specified rather than other physical good 

works indicates that they are an index of all meritorious acts and a sample of them, and 

that they reflect them - like the Fatiha is an index of the Qur'an and man is an index of 

the world. For in one sense the salât include fasting, the Hajj, zakât, and the other forms 

of worship; and they include the worship of all creatures, both innate and voluntary; some 

of  the  angels  bow  in  worship,  others  prostrate,  and  yet  others  stand,  and  some  stones 

prostrate in worship, and some trees stand, and some animals bow down. 

 The verbal form "(lit. they perform) yuqîmûna" is used instead of 'almuqîmûn ' (the 

active participle) in order to thrust before the mind's eye of the listener this extensive vital 

action, this heedfulness of the spirit, in the world of Islam, and to alert his imagination to 

this admirable and orderly situation in all the regions of humanity, and to arouse in him 

the desire to do likewise. For if someone observes the effect of a bugle call on soldiers 

 

 

50 

#51 

dispersed  and  lost  among  the  people,  how  it  arouses  them,  summoning  them  to  gather 

together and take up pleasing, orderly positions, he himself will feel inclined to join them. 

Just the same is the call to prayer of Muhammad (UWBP) among the people in this bleak 

world. "And God's is the highest similitude." 

 The  use  here,  the  place  for  conciseness,  of  the  prolix  "are  steadfast  in  prayer 

(yuqîmûna al-salât)" in place of 'yusallûn,' indicates the importance of complying with the 

meaning  of  'performing'  (al-iqâma)  the  salât,  such  as  performing  them  correctly,  and 

regularly,  and  seriously,  and  preserving  oneself  [from  distractions  etc.],  and  increasing 

demand for them in the market of the world. Ponder over this, and understand too that 

the  salât  are  an  elevated  link,  a  lofty  relationship  between  the  bondsman  and  the  Pre-

Eternal Monarch, and an honourable act of service. It is characteristic of this relationship 

that it captivates the spirit. The 'pillars' of the salât comprise numerous mysteries which 

have  been  expounded  in  works  like  al-Futûhât  al-Makkiya.  {[*]:  By  Muhyiddîn  al-'Arabi 

(1165-1240 A.D.). See note 7 in preceding chapter.} One of these is that the conscience 

loves them. They are a summons of the Pre-Eternal Maker to the pavilion of His presence 

five times a day and night to commune with Him, as a sort of Ascension. This is such that 

everyone's heart should yearn for it. The salât perpetuates in the heart the idea of the 

Maker's  sublimity  and  makes  the  mind  conscious  of  it  so  as  to  induce  obedience  to  the 

divine laws of justice and compliance with the dominical order of things. Man is in need of 

this because he is human and because he is by nature civilized. So alas for those who give 

up the salât! What a loss the lazy suffer! And O, the ignorance of those who do not know 

their value! And those who do not deem them worthwhile, they should go elsewhere, the 

targets of general disgust! 

 

yunfiqûn)" 

 "And  spend  out  of  what  We  have  provided  for  them  (Wa  mimmâ  razqnâhum 

 The  positioning  [and  relationship  with  the  preceding  phrase]:  just  as  the  salât 

are  "the  pillar  of  religion"  and  uphold  religion;  so  zakât  is  "the  bridge  of  Islam"  and  the 

means  by  which  its  people  assist  one  another.  There  are  certain  conditions  making 

almsgiving acceptable and not misplaced: 

 -One should not be wasteful [go to excess], which is reprehensible. 

 -One should not take from one person and give to another, but should give out of 

one's own property.

#52 

 -One should not give in the hope of gain. 

 -One should not fear poverty. 

 -Almsgiving should not be restricted to property; knowledge, ideas, and actions may

be avoided; 

donor's property; 

 The Qur'an preferred "And spend out of what We have provided for them (Wa mimmâ 

razqnâhum  yunfiqûn)"  to  'they  give  alms'  (yatasaddaqûn)  or  'they  give  the  alms-tax' 

(yazakkûn) and so on in order to make the following points and infer these conditions: 

 With "out of (min)" it indicates that wastefulness [in the giving of almsgiving] should 

 By putting "out of what (mimmâ)" first it infers that it should be given out of the 

 And by "We have provided (razzaqnâ)," it disallows it being a favour; that is, "it is 

Allâh who is the Giver and you are merely the means." 

 And by the "We (-nâ)," it alludes to the meaning of the Hadith: "Never fear scarcity 

from the Lord of the divine throne." {[*]: al-Jâmi' al-Sagir, no: 1508; al-Mundhiri, al-Targhib 

wa'l-Tarhib, no: 912. See, Nursi, Ishârât al-I'jâz [Ihsan Qasim], 53.} 

 And  because  rizq  [the  noun  'sustenance,'  derived  from  the  verbal  root]  here  is 

absolute and not specific, it infers that almsgiving includes the giving of knowledge, ideas, 

and other things. 

 And by "spend (yunfiqûn)" it infers the condition that the recipient should spend the 

alms on his livelihood and essential needs. 

 It is stated by a sound Hadith: "Zakât is the bridge of Islam." {[*]: See, note 9 above.} 

That is, zakât is a bridge; the Muslim helps his brother Muslim to pass over it. For it is the 

means  enjoined  [by  religion]  whereby  [people]  may  assist  one  another;  indeed,  it  is  a 

highway in the ordering of human society, and a link or artery by which the substance of 

life  may  flow  between  its  members.  Indeed,  it  is  the  antidote  to  the  very  real  poisons 

impeding  human  progress.  Yes,  there  is  vast  wisdom  in  the  obligation  of  zakât  and 

prohibition of usury and interest, and lofty benefits and extensive mercy. For if you take a 

historical look at the page of the world and study the evils of human society, you will see 

that the underlying reasons for all revolutions and corruption, and the source of immorality 

are only two sayings: 

  

 

52 

The First: "Once I'm full, what is to me if others die of hunger?" 

 

#53 

 The Second: "You work so that I can eat, and you toil so that I can rest." 

 As for the cruel, rapacious, vile, first saying, it has shaken the world of humanity 

and brought it to the brink of ruin. It is only zakât that will cut it at the root. While the 

tyrannical,  greedy,  perverted  second  saying  has  imperiled  human  progress,  taking  it 

tottering to the verge of the conflagration of anarchy. And the only way to eradicate it, 

the only remedy for it, is the prohibition of usury and interest. So reflect on this! 

 Consider this: the order of society is dependent on there being no vacuum between 

the classes of people. The upper classes should not grow distant from the lower classes, 

nor  the  rich  from  the  poor,  to  the  extent  that  the  lines  of  communication  are  broken 

between them. But because the obligatory payment of zakât and the prohibition of usury 

and interest have been neglected, a yawning gap has opened up between the classes, and 

the upper classes have grown so distant from the lower classes that no links between them 

remain. It is because of this that instead of respect, obedience, and love ascending from 

the lower classes to the upper classes, shouts of revolution arise, and shrieks of envy and 

cries  of  hatred  and  revenge.  Similarly,  instead  of  kindness,  generosity,  and  favours 

descending from the upper to the lower classes, the fires of tyranny and oppression, and 

volleys of insult rain down on them. Alas! While the qualities of the elite should be the 

cause of modesty and compassion, unfortunately they give rise to pride and arrogance. And 

while the powerlessness and poverty of the poor necessitate kindness and benevolence, 

they lead to slavery and degradation. If you want a witness for what I say, take a look at 

the civilized world; there you will find as many witnesses as you could wish for. The only 

means of reconciliation between the classes, which will bring them closer together, is the 

payment  of  zakât,  one  of  the  pillars  of  Islam,  and  an  elevated,  farreaching  rule  in  the 

administration of society.

Verse	4	

 َنﻮُﻨِﻗﻮ

 ُﯾ ْﻢُھ ِةَﺮ ِﺧ

 ٰﻻْﺎِﺑَو َﻚِﻠْﺒَﻗ  ْﻦِﻣ َلِﺰْﻧُا ﺎَﻣَو َﻚْﯿَﻟِا َلِﺰْﻧُا ﺎَﻤِﺑ  َنﻮُﻨِﻣ ْﺆُﯾ  َﻦﯾِﺬﱠﻟاَو

 

 And  who  believe  in  that  which  is  revealed  to  you,  and  that  which  was  revealed 

before you, and have certain belief in the hereafter. (Wa alladhîna yu'minûna bi-mâ unzila 

ilayka wa mâ unzila min qablika wa bi'1-âkhirati hum yûqinûn.) 

 Consider this: the Qur'an has not restrained or restricted its word-order. That is to 

say, in most verses similar to this one, it has not specified any aspect of the phrases and 

sentences by placing a sign in them. This is for a subtle reason, and this reason is the source 

of its conciseness [or ellipsis al-ijâz], which in turn is the source of its miraculousness. The 

reason  is  this:  eloquence  consists  of  speaking  in  conformity  with  the  demands  of  any 

situation. Those the Qur'an addresses belong to different classes in different centuries. So 

taking  all  these  classes  and  centuries  into  consideration,  in  order  that  all  the  different 

types  of  people  may  receive  their  share,  the  Qur'an  makes  omissions  in  many  places  in 

order to make general what it says and apportion it out, and speaks in absolute terms in 

order to make it comprehensive and distribute it. Moreover it leaves the word-order free 

in  many  places  to  multiply  its  facets  and  to  increase  the  possibilities  agreeable  to 

eloquence and acceptable to the sciences of Arabic. Thus all minds receive the Qur'an's 

effusions to the extent they can appreciate them. Consider this carefully! 

Now the positioning of this verse in relation to the previous one: here it is being 

specific  after  being  general,  to  proclaim  over  the  heads  of  witnesses  the  distinction  of 

those People of the Book who believe, and to silence those of them who hold back from it, 

and to take those like 'Abdullah ibn Salam {[*]: Abû Yusuf 'Abdullah ibn al-Salâm al-Hârith 

(d. 43/663). He was a learned Jew who accepted Islam and became one of the Prophet's 

(UWBP) Companions.} by the hand so as to encourage others to follow his example. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54 

#55 

Moreover,  it  states  unequivocally  that  there  are  two  sorts  of  Godfearing  people 

(muttaqî),  thus  stating  openly  that  the  Qur'an's  guidance  embraces  all  peoples,  and 

inferring that Muhammad (Upon whom be blessings and peace) was sent as Messenger to 

all nations without exception. Also, by elucidating the pillars of belief contained in the 

shell  of  "who  believe  in  the  Unseen  (yu'minûna  bi'l-ghayb),"  it  supplies  details  after  its 

previous  succinct  statements,  for  it  makes  explicit  mention  of  the  revealed  books  and 

resurrection of the dead, and implicit reference to the prophets and angels. 

 The Qur'an did not opt for conciseness by saying something like 'the believers in the 

Qur'an' (al-mu'minûna bi'l-Qur'ân) rather, in order to stud the meaning with subtleties and 

decorate its appendices with fine points, it preferred "And who believe in that which is 

revealed to you (wa alladhîna yu'minûna bi-mâ unzila ilayka)." For in "who (alladhîna)" is 

a sign that the attribute of belief is what is intended, and that a person's other attributes 

are dependent on it and concealed beneath it. 

 In  the  use  of  the  imperfect  tense  for  "(they)  believe  (yu'minûna)"  instead  of  'the 

believers' (al-mu'minûn) [the active participle] which infers [something] being fixed and 

unchanging, is an indication that belief is constantly renewed on the repeated coming of 

revelation. 

revelation like Hadiths. 

 Then  with  the  vagueness  of  "what  (mâ),"  it  indicates  that  abbreviated  belief  is 

sufficient,  and  that  belief  includes  exoteric  revelation  [like  the  Qur'an]  and  esoteric 

 Concerning  "revealed  (unzila),"  in  regard  to  its  matter  (mâdda)  it  indicates  that 

belief in the Qur'an is belief in its revelation by Allâh. Likewise, it means belief in Allâh is 

belief  in  Allâh's  existence,  and  belief  in  the  hereafter  is  belief  in  the  coming  of  the 

hereafter. 

 The use of the perfect tense although the revelation had not yet been completed, 

is  an  indication  that  its  completion  was  as  certain  as  that  which  had  been  revealed. 

Moreover, "(they) believe (yu'minûna)" being in the imperfect tense infers the future, thus 

compensating for the deficiency inferred by the use of the perfect. Because the Qur'an was 

revealed in this way [that is, by degrees], you see in its styles that the past very often 

swallows the future and the imperfect tense dons the attire of the perfect. The eloquence 

of this is a very subtle: 

 If a person hears something referred to in the past although it has not yet occurred, 

it arouses his mind and he is alerted to the fact that he is not alone, but behind him are 

row upon row at various distances, as though the 

 

55 

#56 

centuries and their peoples are sitting in tiers rising up behind him. This makes him aware 

that the address and call directed towards him is being heard by all of them according to 

its volume. Yes, it is a divine address from which all the rows of men in all the centuries 

receive their share. Thus, the past is real for most people most of the time, while for a 

few a little of the time it is metaphorical. So to take the majority into consideration serves 

better the purposes of eloquence. 

 And in the use of "to you (ilayka)" rather than 'on you' ('alayka) is a sign that the 

divine  messengership  was  a  duty  with  which  the  Prophet  (Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 

peace) was charged, that he undertook voluntarily. Also [on the one hand] it indicates his 

loftiness since Gabriel served him by presenting [the Qur'an] to him, for 'on' ('alâ) hints of 

compulsion and that the means of revelation was higher. While [on the other] the use of 

the  second  person  "to  you"  rather  than  [the  third  person]  'to  Muhammad'  implies  that 

Muhammad (Upon whom be blessings and peace) was only an addressee and that the speech 

is  Allâh's  Word.  Moreover,  in  meaning,  the  direct  address  of  the  vocative  confirms  and 

illustrates the meaning of that which is sent down or revealed (al-nuzûl), and this is the 

Revelation (al-wahy), and the Revelation is the Qur'an, which is a divine address [to the 

Prophet] the character of which is to permeate all these [points]. And this reveals his share 

of this characteristic. Thus, it becomes clear by reason of its encompassing all these subtle 

points, that this passage is of the utmost conciseness. 

 "And that which was revealed before you (wa mâ unzila min qablika)" 

 Consider this: the purpose of descriptions like these is to arouse eagerness, and this 

implies  [certain  new]  injunctions:  "Believe  in  such-and-such,  and  make  no  distinction 

[between  the  prophets]."  The  phrase's  positioning  and  its  ties  [with  what  precedes  it] 

comprise four subtle points: 

 Firstly: The argument from what is adduced to the evidence. It is like this: 

 "O men! If you believe in the Qur'an, believe also in the previous scriptures, for the 

Qur'an confirms their veracity and testifies to them." This is indicated by "a confirmation 

of what went before." (2:97) 

 Secondly: The argument from the evidence to what is adduced, like this: "O People 

of the Book! If you believe in the past prophets and scriptures, you should also believe in 

the Qur'an and Muhammad (UWBP), for the scriptures gave the good news of his coming. 

Moreover,  confirmation  of  them,  and  their  revelation  and  evidences  of  the  messengers' 

prophethoods 

 

 

56 

#57 

are  found  in  reality  and  in  spirit  more  perfectly  in  the  Qur'an  and  more  clearly  in 

Muhammad (UWBP). Thus, according to this excellent reasoning, the Qur'an is the Word of 

Allâh and Muhammad (Upon whom be blessings and peace) is His Messenger. 

 Thirdly: In this is a sign that the outcome (al-ma'âl) of the Qur'an, that is, Islam, 

which  emerged  from  it  in  the  Era  of  Bliss,  is  like  a  tree  whose  origin  is  fastened  in  the 

depths of the past. Its spreading roots are fed from the water-sources of that time yielding 

life and strength. And with its trunk in the skies of the future, its spreading branches are 

laden with fruit. That is to say, Islam embraces the past and the future. 

 Fourthly: In this is a sign that it is urging the People of the Book to believe [in Islam], 

for it is making it appear familiar to them, and easy. It is as though [the Qur'an] is saying: 

'O People of the Book! You should not experience any difficulty in entering this [new] way, 

for you are not casting away your outer shell altogether, but only completing your beliefs 

and building on the fundamentals you already possess.' For the Qur'an does not bring any 

new  fundamentals  or  principal  beliefs;  it  modifies  and  perfects  existent  ones;  and  it 

combines in itself the virtues of all the previous books and the essentials of all the previous 

laws. It only establishes new ordinances in secondary matters, which are subject to change 

due to differences in time and place. For just as with the change of seasons, food and dress 

and many other things are changed; so too the stages of a person's life warrant changes in 

the manner of their education and upbringing. Similarly, as necessitated by wisdom and 

need, religious ordinances concerning secondary matters change in accordance with the 

stages of mankind's development. For very many of these are beneficial at one time yet 

harmful  at  another,  and  very  many  medicines  were  efficacious  in  mankind's  infancy  yet 

ceased being remedies in its youth. This is the reason the Qur'an abrogated some of its 

secondary pronouncements. That is, it decreed that their time had finished and that the 

turn had come for other decrees. 

  

 

[The words] "before you (min qablika)" [also indicate] a number of subtle points: 

 Consider this: there is no word of revelation that is disdainful of its place, or is not 

content  with  it,  or  thinks  that  another  place  would  be  better.  No,  there  is  no  word  of 

revelation but it is like an embossed pearl, held firmly in its setting by the bonds of the 

relationships between it and its brothers. If you wish, study "before you;" you will see how 

the subtleties fly out from every side of the verse and alight on this unique phrase. The 

 

 

57 

#58 

relationships. 

their virtues. 

verse of which "before you" is a part deals with the question of prophethood and the five 

aims  it  comprises.  The  phrase  has  absorbed  these  aims  and  been  coloured  by  them. 

Signifying  five  subtle  points,  it  exudes  the  five  aims,  which  are  reflected  from  these 

 The aims included [in prophethood] are these: Muhammad (Upon whom be blessings 

and  peace)  is  a  prophet;  he  is  the  most  perfect  of  the  prophets;  he  is  the  Seal  of  the 

Prophets; he was sent to all peoples; his Shari'a abrogated all preceding ones and contains 

 The manner the first aim is reflected in the phrase: [the words] "before you (min 

qablika)" are used only when ways are united and the road is one, as though the phrase is 

suggesting that by comparison all the proofs of the previous prophets and of the veracity 

of their scriptures form a decisive proof of the prophethood of Muhammad (UWBP) and the 

revelation of his Book. For all the causes and reasons confirming their prophethoods, prove 

his prophethood more explicitly and more powerfully. It is as though all their miracles form 

a single miracle proving his veracity. 

 The  way  in  which  the  second  aim,  the  perfection  of  Muhammad's  (UWBP) 

prophethood,  is  reflected  in  the  phrase  "before  you."  in  view  of  the  facts  that  it  is  the 

custom  for  the  king  to  appear  before  the  people  at  the  end  of  a  ceremony,  and  in 

accordance with the law of human progress a later teacher is better than an earlier one, 

and generally those who come later are more proficient than those who preceded them, 

Muhammad (Upon whom be peace) was the Sovereign of the Prophets, and the best and 

most perfect of them, just as the Qur'an is more comprehensive and universal than their 

scriptures. 

 The way the phrase "before you" absorbs the third aim, which is Muhammad's being 

the Seal of the Prophets: in accordance with the rule, "if one is multiplied it goes to infinity, 

stopping nowhere; but if a multiplicity of things are united, they acquire stability and come 

to a halt," and as is inferred by the opposite idea, "before you" hints that "there will be no 

prophets after you," and that Muhammad (Upon whom be blessings and peace) is the Seal 

of the Prophets. 

 The way the phrase "before you" is coloured by the fourth aim, the universality of 

his  mission:  it  expresses  this  meaning:  "You  are  their  successor  and  they  are  all  your 

predecessors."  Hence,  according  to  the  rule,  "the  successor  shoulders  the  duties  of  his 

predecessor  and  takes  his  seat,"  all  of  them  were  your  predecessors  and  you  are  their 

 

58 

deputy and the Messenger to all peoples. Yes indeed, it could only be thus! For the innate 

disposition 

 

#59 

of things demands it and wisdom requires it. Before the Era of Bliss all the nations of the 

world  of  humanity  were  extremely  distant  from  one  another  and  hostile  to  each  other, 

both physically and emotionally, and by instinct and upbringing. A single sort of education 

was  insufficient  for  them  and  all  could  not  be  drawn  to  a  single  cause.  Then,  when 

humanity was awakened in the Era of Bliss and subsequently, and people felt a desire to 

come  together  due  to  the  exchange  of  ideas  and  swapping  of  characters,  and  the 

intermingling of peoples, and some of them investigating the conditions of others, and time 

was churned up by the many means of communication and transportation; - then the globe 

of the earth became like a single country, or a province, or a town, and the people of the 

world came together; and then a single mission, a single prophethood was sufficient for all 

of them. 

 The way the phrase intimates the fifth aim: since the "from (min)" of "before you 

(min  qablika)"  infers  a  beginning,  it  infers  'to'  (ilâ),"  which  indicates  the  end.  That  is, 

"prophethood came to an end with your coming, for your Shari'a is sufficient." This infers 

that  his  Shari'a  abrogated  all  previous  ones,  signalling  their  end,  and  through  its 

sufficiency, included them all. 

 The  evidence  that  from  the  point  of  view  of  eloquence  this  phrase  has  absorbed 

these subtle points is that the five aims resemble a river flowing beneath these verses; one 

of  them  gushes  out  completely  in  one  verse,  then  another  flows  forth  in  another,  and 

another is manifested entirely in a torrent in yet another. Even the least trickle on the 

surface  indicates  that  the  veins  of  this  phrase  touch  it.  Moreover,  the  above  meanings 

sprout forth in many different verses. 

  

"And have certain belief in the hereafter (wa bi'1-âklhirati hum yûqinûn)" 

 Consider this: this phrase refers to the fourth of the four well-known aims of the 

Qur'an:  the  resurrection  of  the  dead.  I  have  deduced  ten  proofs  of  it  from  the  Qur'an's 

word-order and have set them out in another book. {[*]: Nursi, Muhâkemat [first published 

1911] (Istanbul: Sözler Yayınevi, 1977), 151-153. As the New Said, he later included the 

same proofs in the Twenty-Ninth Word, The Words (Istanbul: Sözler Publications, 2002), 

538-545.} It will be useful to summarize them here. They are as follows: 

 

59 

 The resurrection of the dead is a reality, for there is perfect, intentional order in 

the universe. There is total wisdom in creation. There is nothing futile in the world. There 

is no waste in creation (al-fitra). This testimony is vouched for by the inductive reasoning 

of all the sciences, each of which is a faithful witness to the order in its field of study. 

Also, there being 

 

#60 

repeated resurrections in most things, such as the days and the years and so on, [testifies 

to the resurrection of the dead], Man's innate disposition also points to it. It is indicated 

too  by  his  infinite  hopes  and  desires.  The  All-Wise  Maker's  mercy  also  alludes  to  the 

resurrection, while the truthful tongue of Allâh's Messenger (Upon whom be blessings and 

peace)  states  it  explicitly.  And  the  Inimitable  Qur'an  testifies  to  it  with  such  verses  as 

"Seeing that He has created you in successive stages," (71:14) and "Nor is your Sustainer 

ever  unjust  to  His  servants."  (41:46)  These  ten  genuine  proofs  are  keys  to  eternal 

happpiness and to the doors of Paradise. 

An  Explanation  of  the  First  Proof:  If  the  universe  did  not  result  in  everlasting 

happiness,  the  order  in  it,  which  its  Maker  has  laid  down  with  the  greatest  skill  and 

precision, leaving minds in amazement, would be a flimsy, deceptive form, and all non-

material matters and connections, and relationships and links in the order would go for 

nothing. The order is order only because it leads to eternal happiness. That is, the fine 

points and non-material aspects of the order only sprout in the next world. Otherwise, all 

those  non-material  aspects  would  be  extinguished,  all  the  bonds  be  broken,  all  the 

relationships  severed,  and  the  order  would  cease  to  be.  But  the  power  inherent  in  the 

order declares in resounding voice that it would not let it be broken and dissolved. 

Second Proof: The faultless wisdom [in the universe], which is the exemplification 

of  pre-eternal  providence  (al-'inâyat  al-azaliyya)  and  consists  of  following  uses  and 

instances of wisdom in all the realms (lit. species - naw') of beings, indeed in every part of 

each - as is testified to by the sciences, gives the glad tidings of eternal happiness. We 

would otherwise have to deny these purposes and benefits the certainty of which compels 

us  to  acknowledge  them.  For  then  the  benefits  would  not  be  benefits,  and  the  wisdom 

would not be wisdom, and the uses would not be useful. And this is pure sophistry. 

  

  

  

 

60 

The Third Proof, which expounds the Second: Science testifies also that the Maker 

chooses the shortest path in everything, and the closest side, and the lightest and most 

beautiful form. This indicates the absence of futility. And this suggests that the Maker is 

truly  serious.  And  this  could  only  be  with  the  coming  of  eternal  happiness.  Otherwise 

existence would descend to the level of absolute non-existence and everything would be 

transformed into pure futility. Glory be unto to You! You did not create this in vain! 

  

#61 

The Fourth Proof, which elucidates the Third: The sciences 

show that there is no waste in creation. If your mind is incapable of perceiving the instances 

of wisdom in the macrocosm, that is, the world, scrutinize the microcosm, which is man. 

For  the  science  of  anatomy  has  described  and  proved  them.  In  the  human  body  are 

approximately six hundred bones each of which has a particular function. And there are six 

thousand veins and arteries for the circulation of the blood, each with its own use. And 

there are twenty-four thousand pores and ducts in the cells. And in each cell function the 

five  powers  of  attraction,  repulsion,  holding  (mumsika),  forming  (musawwira),  and 

reproduction, which all have their own purposes. 

 If the microcosm is thus, would the macrocosm be defective in comparison? If there 

is this absence of waste in the body, which has no importance compared with its essence, 

is it conceivable that the spirit would be neglected? Or that spiritual matters and hopes 

and ideas, which are the works of the spirit, should be wasted? If it were not for eternal 

happiness,  all  spiritual  matters  would  shrivel  up  and  be  wasted.  For  God's  sake,  is  it 

reasonably possible that you should have a jewel worth the world and look after its shell 

and case, not even letting it become dusty, then take it and smash it to smithereens and 

destroy all trace of it? Absolutely not! You only look after the case for what it contains. 

Furthermore, if a person's sound constitution and healthy members and faculties give you 

to  understand  that  he  will  continue  to  live  and  develop,  do  not  the  constant  reality 

permeating  the  spirit  of  the  universe,  and  the  total  force  indicating  the  continued 

existence of its order, and the perfection causing the maturation (takammul) of its overall 

system  all  show  you  that  eternal  happiness  will  arrive  through  the  door  of  bodily 

resurrection? For it is only resurrection that saves the order from disturbance, and is the 

means of its maturation, and for the unfolding of that perpetual force. 

  

 

Fifth  Proof,  and  Surmise,  which  indicates  intention:  The  existence  of  repeated 

resurrections in most of the realms of beings points to the supreme resurrection. If you 

61 

like, this can be illustrated with an example: take a look at your weekly clock. It contains 

various cogs and flywheels that turn and work the hands. One of them counts the seconds; 

it is a forerunner, giving news of the motion of the minute hand. This paves the way for 

and announces the motion of the hour hand, and it results in and proclaims the motion of 

the  hand  that  counts  the  days  of  the  week.  The  preceding  one  completing  its  circuit 

indicates that its sister following it will complete its circuit. Similarly, Allâh the Most High, 

be He exalted, has a vast 

 

#62 

clock the machinery of which are the heavenly spheres; its hands count the days, and the 

years,  and  the  life  of  mankind,  and  term  of  the  world.  They  are  the  equivalent  of  the 

seconds, minutes, hours, and days of your clock. The morning comes after every night, and 

the summer comes after every spring - resulting from the motion of that clock - which is a 

concealed sign and subtle hint that the morning of the spring of the resurrection will come, 

breaking forth from the vast clock of the universe. 

 -If  you  were  to  ask:  Things  are  not  resurrected  identically  in  the  repeated 

resurrections  in  the  universe,  so  how  does  this  show  that  they  will  be  restored  to  life 

identically at the supreme resurrection? 

 You would be told: A human individual is like a species of other creatures. For the 

light of thought affords such breadth and expansion to man's hopes and his spirit that they 

encompass the past, present, and future. If he were to swallow the past and the future 

together with the present, it would not satisfy his hopes. For the light of thought renders 

his  nature  lofty,  his  value  general,  his  view  universal,  his  perfection  unlimited,  his 

pleasures  continuous,  and  his  sufferings  constant.  As  for  the  members  of  other  species, 

their natures are particular, their value individual, their views limited, their perfections 

restricted, their pleasures instantaneous, and their suffering fleeting. So why should the 

existence of a sort of resurrection in the [other] species not point to a general resurrection 

of the human individual? 

  

The  Sixth  Proof,  which  is  allusive:  This  is  the  unlimited  nature  of  man's 

potentialities. Man's unbounded conceptions and thoughts are born of his infinite hopes. 

These arise from his unrestricted desires, which in turn arise from his unlimited abilities. 

These are concealed in his boundless potentialities, planted in the substance of his spirit, 

which Allâh the Most High has ennobled. All of these point testifying to eternal happiness 

 

62 

beyond the bodily resurrection of the dead, fixing their gaze on it from afar. Reflect on 

this! 

  

The Seventh Proof, conveying the good news that the mercy of the Most Merciful 

and Compassionate One tells of the coming of the supreme mercy, by which I mean eternal 

felicity. For it is through eternal felicity that mercy becomes mercy and bounty becomes 

bounty, and the universe is delivered from the lamentations and general mourning arising 

from eternal separation, which transforms bounty into an affliction. If the spirit of bounty, 

that  is,  eternal  felicity,  were  not  to  come,  all  bounties  would  be  transformed  into 

misfortunes, and it would necessitate obstinate denial of the mercy that is self-evidently 

testified to by all the universe. O 

 

#63 

Habib and Shafiq, {[*]: The names of two of Nursi's students, which mean affectionate and 

compassionate,  respectively.  The  former  acted  as  the  author's  scribe.}  both  lovers! 

Consider the finest works of divine mercy: affection, compassion, and love. Then consult 

your  consciences,  but  after  supposing  them  to  be  subject  to  eternal  separation  and 

unending parting; how they appeal for help! How your imaginations cry out, and your spirits 

are tormented at the transformation of affection and kindnesss, the most beautiful and 

exquisite  sorts  of  mercy  and  bounty,  into  a  terrible  calamity  and  affliction.  Is  it  at  all 

possible that such necessary mercy would assist eternal separation in assaulting affection 

and  kindness?  No!  That  mercy  is  such  that  it  would  set  eternal  separation  to  attack 

unending parting, and beset unending parting with eternal separation, and annihilate both 

of them! 

  

  

The  Eighth  Proof,  which  is  explicit:  This  is  the  veracious,  verified  tongue  of 

Muhammad (Upon whom be blessings and peace). His word flung open the doors of eternal 

felicity. The consensus of all the prophets from Adam to their Seal (UWBP) concerning this 

truth,  forms  a  decisive  proof  of  it.  There  must  be  such  a  truth,  since  they  were  in 

agreement concerning it. 

Ninth Proof: This is the miraculous Qur'an's announcement of eternal felicity. The 

seven aspects of its miraculousness have been confirmed for thirteen centuries furnishing 

proof of what it claims. For it discloses bodily resurrection with its message and is the key 

 

63 

to it. {[*]: An allusion to the commentaries al-Kashshâf by al-Zamakhshari and al-Miftdh by 

alSakkâkı. See, notes 4 and 5 above.} 

  

The Tenth Proof: This consists of thousands of proofs supplied by numerous verses. 

For  example,  the  verse,  "Seeing  that  He  has  created  you  in  successive  stages"  (71:14) 

indicates an allegorical comparison (qiyâs tamthîlî); and "Nor is your Sustainer ever unjust 

to His servants" (A 1:46) points to a proof of justice. Indeed, in most of its verses the Qur'an 

has opened up windows looking onto the resurrection of the dead. 

 The allegorical comparison in the first verse above is as follows: consider the human 

body, how it passes from stage to stage, from sperm to a blood-clot, and from that to an 

embryo, and from that to flesh and bone, and from that to a new creation. Each of these 

stages has such particular laws, such determined order, such regular development that it 

reveals transparently an intention, will, and choice. Next study its continued existence, 

for the body renews its clothes every year, and this occurs through 

 

#64 

dissolution and reassembling. That is to say, the cells are broken down and repaired with 

a  subtle  substance  prepared  by  their  Maker  in  accordance  with  a  particular  law,  and 

distributed in appropriate amounts to all the organs. 

 Now study the gages of the subtle matter that bears the members' sustenance, how 

it is spread to all the parts of the body in a way that astonishes the mind, and how it is 

apportioned  according  to  a  specific  law  of  division  appropriately  to  the  needs  of  the 

members. This is after it has been distilled by passing in accordance with a fixed order and 

specific rules and extraordinary process through the body's four filters, and being cooked 

in  its  four  kitchens,  and  undergoing  four  wondrous  transformations;  and  the  sustenance 

having been obtained according to a regular law, and particular system, and specific rule 

from substances dispersed through the world of the elements. 

 All  the  laws  and  systems  in  these  stages  show  transparently  a  driving  force,  an 

intention, and wisdom. How could it not be thus? If you study an atom from the caravan of 

the subtle matter [known as sustenance], for example one concealed in the element of the 

air which finally becomes part of the pupil of Habib's eye, you will see that its path has 

been determined in the air, as though charged and commanded to proceed to the place 

appointed for it. And if you consider it with a scientific eye, you will be certain that it is 

not in motion through blind chance and aimless coincidence, for whatever level it enters 

upon it conforms to its particular order, and whatever stage it rises to it knows its specific 

 

64 

laws, and to what level it travels to it is driven with a wondrous, orderly motion. It passes 

through all these stages till it reaches its destination. And it never deviates even an iota 

from its intended goal. 

  

In  Short:  Whoever  ponders  over  the  first  creation  will  cease  to  have  any  doubts 

concerning  the  second.  Indeed,  the  Prophet  (Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace)  said: 

"How strange the person who sees the first creation yet denies the second!" 

 For the soldiers of a regiment to gather together at the sound of the bugle after 

having dispersed to rest, emerging from every nook and cranny, and to form ranks under 

their flag, is far easier than calling them up the first time and taking them under discipline 

and  arms.  Similarly,  it  is  easier  for  particles  that  are  closely  acquainted  having  been 

intermingled in a single body to regather at sound of israfil's trumpet, and for them all to 

come from every side in response to their Creator's command; this is easier and 

 

#65 

reasonably more possible than their original creation and composition. For in relation to 

divine power, the greatest thing is equal to the smallest. 

 It seems that at the resurrection, the original parts of the body will be restored to 

it,  as  well  as  those  that  were  discarded.  This  is  alluded  to  by  the  vast  bodies  of  the 

resurrected, {[*]: A Hadith narrated by Abu Huraira says: "The kafir's tooth will be [as huge 

as] Mount Uhud, and his skin will be of the thickness of three days' journeying." Muslim, iv, 

2189. See, Nursi, Ishârât al-I'jâz [Ihsan Qasim], 66, for this and following two Hadiths.} and 

the  fact  that  it  is  'disapproved  of'  (makrûh)  to  cut  the  hair  or  nails  when  canonically 

unclean, and that it is 'Sunna' to bury them. {[*]: al-Suyûti, Kanz al-'Ummâl, vi, 656; al-

Suyûti, al-Fath al-Kabir, ii, 375; and others.} But according to investigations, [a few cells 

from] the coccyx ('ajb al-dhanab) will be sufficient as a seed and substance for the body's 

re-formation. {[*]: A Hadith narrated by Abu Huraira says: "All the sons of Adam will be 

consumed by the earth except for [a few cells from] the coccyx. They were created out of 

that [in the first place] and will be recreated out of it." Muslim, Fitan, 28; Ibni Mâja, Zuhd, 

32; and others.} 

 Now for the proof indicated by the verse, "Nor is your Sustainer ever unjust to His 

servants:" (41:46) we very often see tyrannical, sinful, and cruel men living in the greatest 

luxury,  passing  their  lives  in  affluence  and  ease.  Then  we  see  that  poor,  oppressed, 

righteous men of good character live lives of great hardship, degraded and oppressed. Then 

death comes and makes them equal and this appears to be the ultimate tyranny. Whereas 

 

65 

divine justice and wisdom, which are testified to by all the universe, are exempt from such 

tyranny. There must therefore be a final gathering at which the former will receive his 

punishment and the latter his reward, so that divine justice may be fully manifested. You 

can compare other verses of the Qur'an with these two. 

  

The  positioning  of  the  parts  of  the  phrase:  "and  have  certain  belief  in  the 

hereafter (wa bi'1-âkhirati hum yûqinûn):" 

 The main points [that this phrase consists of]: the "and (wâw)" the precedence of "in 

the hereafter (bi'1-âkhira);" the use of the definite article for "the hereafter;" the term 

"hereafter," the use of the personal pronoun "hum (they);" and the use of "have certain 

belief in (yûqinûn)" rather than 'they believe' (yu'minûn). 

 The [conjunction] "and (wâw):" after the general statements of the previous phrases, 

[the purpose of] this is to denote the specificity [of this one] with its explicit mention of 

this pillar of belief. For [this pillar] is one of the two pivots on which the revealed scriptures 

 The precedence of "in the hereafter (bi'1-âkhira)" denotes restriction. 

turn. 

#66 

and this suggests that because [some of] the People of the Book say: "The Fire shall not 

touch us but for a few numbered days," (2:80) and [others of them] deny bodily pleasures, 

the hereafter will be metaphorical for them and only in name; what they will experience 

will not be the true hereafter. 

 The use of the definite article "al" is to express its known nature. That is, it indicates 

that  [the  hereafter]  is  well-known  by  reason  of  its  constant  mention  by  the  revealed 

scriptures. Its being well-known is also a hint that it is true, and a sign that in consequence 

of the proofs based on the nature of things mentioned above it is a fact almost visible to 

the mind. Its being well-known is therefore a sign that it is a reality. And the use of the 

term  "the  hereafter  (al-âkhira),"  that  is,  making  it  an  adjective  qualifying  creation  (al-

na'ita li'l-nasha'), is to direct attention towards the first creation, so that the mind will 

grasp the possibility of the second. 

 The  personal  pronoun  "they  (hum)"  infers  restriction,  and  this  suggests  that  the 

belief  of  those  People  of  the  Book  who  do  not  believe  in  Muhammad  (Upon  whom  be 

blessings  and  peace)  is  not  certain  belief.  Indeed,  it  is  only  a  supposition  which  they 

suppose is certain. 

 "Have  certain  belief  in  (yûqinun)"  is  used  instead  of  'they  believe'  (yu'minûn), 

although  belief  is  certain  affirmation,  in  order  to  intentionally  point  the  finger  at  the 

 

66 

objective so to dispel any doubts. For the resurrection of the dead is a thronging mass of 

doubts [and complete certainty (yaqîn) concerning it is more important than affirmation 

(tasdîq) of it]. Also this definite statement blocks up the path of such excuses of the People 

of the Book as "We're believers anyway, so let those who don't believe, believe." 

Verse	5	

 َنﻮُﺤِﻠْﻔُﻤْﻟا ُﻢُھ َﻚِﺌ

 They  are  on  [true]  guidance  from  their  Lord,  and  it  is  these  who  will  prosper. 

(Ûlâ'ika 'alâ hudan min Rabbihim wa ûlâ'ika humu'l-muflihûn.) 

 Consider this: the surmised places (al-mazânn) in which the subtleties sparkle [in 

this verse] are the following: the positions of the words in relation to those that precede 

them; the perceptibility of "They (ûla' ika)" and the distance it expresses; the elevatedness 

denoted by "on ('alâ)" the use of the indefinite in "guidance (hudan);" the preposition "from 

(min);" the raising and sustaining inferred by "their Lord and Sustainer (Rabbihim)." 

 The positioning: this verse is tied to what precedes it with a number of threads of 

relationships.  One  of  these  is  picking  up  the  threads,  that  is,  it  is  the  answer  to  three 

implied questions: 

 The first is a question seeking an example, as though having listened to the Qur'an 

and  heard  that  it  is  marked  by  giving  guidance  to  people  who  as  a  result  acquire  fine 

qualities, the listener wants to see them actually clothed in these qualities seated on the 

throne of guidance. So it replies by depicting them for him, saying: "They are on [true] 

guidance from their Lord and Sustainer." 

 The second is a question about the reason for guidance, as though the questioner is 

asking: "What are they like that they have deserved guidance and are distinguished by it?" 

And  it  replies:  "They  possess  all  these  qualities  in  combined  form.  If  you  study  them 

carefully, you will see that they are worthy of the light of guidance." 

 -If you were to ask: Doesn't the more detailed mention of the qualities in previous 

verses explain the reason for guidance more clearly than the concise "ûlâ'ika (they)"? 

 You would be told: Conciseness is usually clearer than detailed explanation, 

 

#67 

 

 

 

 

 

67 

#68 

especially if the answer sought arises from a combination of things. For [here] the limited 

nature  of  the  listener's  mind,  and  the  extended  nature  of  the  discussion,  and  the 

intervention of forgetfulness, and the reason for guidance emerging from the combination 

of all the elements of the discussion [hinder] understanding of it. So because "they (ûlâ'ika)" 

combines these things, its conciseness explains the reason more clearly. 

 The  third  is  a  question  about  the  results  and  fruits  of  guidance,  and  its  being  a 

bounty and pleasure, as though the listener asks: "What is its pleasure and [how is it a] 

bounty?" And it replies saying that it is [only] in guidance that happiness is to be found in 

this world and the next; that is, the result of guidance is itself and its fruits are the same 

as itself. For of itself it is the greatest bounty, and rapture of the conscience; it is the 

paradise  of  the  spirit.  Just  as  misguidance  is  its  hell.  Later  it  will  produce  the  fruits  of 

happiness and salvation in the hereafter. 

 When it comes to the perceptibility (al-mahsûsiyya) of "they (ûlâ'ika)," it is a sign 

that the frequent mention of the qualities leads to their being embodied in the listener's 

brain, made present in his mind, and perceptible to his imagination. So from their being 

known  by  [mere]  mention  they  become  (lit.  a  door  opens  onto)  known  actually  (lit. 

externally),  and  from  this  he  understands  the  believers'  distinction  and  gazes  on  their 

shining radiance among mankind. It is as though nothing else will appear to whoever raises 

his head and opens his eyes to look. 

 The  distance  expressed  by  "they  (ûlâ'ika),"  although  on  the  whole  they  are  near, 

indicates the loftiness of their rank, for when seen from afar only the tall in stature are 

visible.  Nevertheless  if  distance  of  time  and  space  is  real,  it  is  the  best  judge  of  the 

imperatives of eloquence. For the Era of Bliss [may be thought of as] a tongue reciting this 

verse as it was revealed, and all subsequent centuries tongues reciting it also, making it 

young and fresh as though newly revealed, not [something that] was revealed long ago that 

has been related. For the front rows, referred to by "they (ûlâ'ika)," appear from afar. So 

their being visible despite the distance proclaims their great stature and lofty rank. 

 Now for [the preposition] "on (alâ)." Consider this: the mystery of the relationships 

[or associations] between things makes most of them like mirrors reflecting each other. 

This one reflects that, and that one this. Just as a fragment of glass can show you a vast 

desert; so sometimes a single word may provoke endless imaginings, and one sentence may 

conjure up a strange tale before your eyes, and one phrase may take your mind on a 

 

 

 

68 

#69 

jaunt through the World of Similitudes. Similarly, the word bâraza, to meet in combat, 

reveals to you a battlefield, and the word "fruit" in the verse pushes open for you the door 

of Paradise. You can carry on in the same way! Just the same is the word "on ('alâ):" it 

opens a window for the mind, [revealing] the following comparison: the Qur'an's guidance 

is a divine mount which it gives to believers to travel on. When mounted on it, they are on 

the Straight Path, journeying to the throne of perfections. 

 The  use  of  the  indefinite  for  "guidance  (hudan)"  indicates  that  it  is  different  to 

"guidance to those who fear Allâh (hudan li'l-muttaqin)." (2:2) For generally speaking, the 

repetition of the indefinite shows that the second is not the same as the first. Here, the 

previous one is a masdar or verbal noun, while this one is 'the product' of the verbal noun 

(hâsil bi'1-masdar). That is, it is a constant 'perceptible' attribute or quality (sifa mahsûsa 

qâra) and the fruit of the first. 

 The word "from (min)" indicates that [guidance] is both created by Allâh and granted 

 The word "Sustainer and Lord (Rabb)" indicates that to give guidance is the mark of 

dominicality (rubûbiyya), so just as He provides them with sustenance, so He sustains them 

to them by Him. 

with guidance. 

 "And it is these who will prosper (wa ûlâ'ika humu'l-muflihûn)" 

 Know that the places the subtle points should be sought are these: the conjunction 

"and  (wâw);"  the  repetition  of  "they  (ûlâ'ika);"  the  detached  pronoun  "they  (hum);"  the 

definite article "the (al);" "those who will prosper (muflihûn)" being absolute, and the form 

of their prosperity or good fortune not being specified. 

 The conjunction is used owing to the relationship between the two clauses. For just 

as the first "they (ûlâ'ika)" signifies happiness in this world (al-sa'âdat al-âjila), which is a 

fruit  of  guidance;  so  the  second  points  to  the  happiness  of  the  hereafter  (al-sa'âdat  al-

âjila). Yes, although both of them are the fruit [or summary] of what precedes them, the 

best  [view]  is  that  the  roots  of  the  first  "they  (ûlâ'ika)"  are  fastened  on  the  first  "who 

(alladhîna), (2:3) and it seems to refer to unlettered believers who [are not People of the 

Book and] receive their strength from the pillars of Islam [that is, they perform the salât 

and pay zakât] this looks to what precedes "and have certain belief in the hereafter (wa 

bi'1-âkhirati hum yûqinûn)." The second "they (ûlâ'ika)" glances secretly, alluding to the 

second "who (alladhîna), (2:4) which it seems, refers to believing People of the Book. Its 

point of reference is the pillars of belief and certainty about the

hereafter. Now reflect on this! 

 As for the repetition of "they (ûlâ'ika)," it indicates that in respect of the ultimate 

cause of guidance and the reason for their being praised and privileged, these two fruits 

[of guidance and salvation (prosperity)] are independent of and different to each other. 

Nevertheless, the best [interpretation] is that the second "they (ûlâ'ika)" points to the first 

in addition to [the predicate of which it is the subject] as though it is saying: "This one is 

learned and that one has been honoured." 

 To come to the detached pronoun "they (hum):" besides corroborating the restriction 

that hints at the People of the Book who do not believe in the Prophet (Upon whom be 

blessings and peace), it contains a subtle point which is this: the "they (hum)" being placed 

between the subject and predicate changes the subject into one with numerous predicates. 

One is mentioned and the rest are referred to the imagination. For the "they (hum)" alerts 

the imagination to the fact that the predicates are not restricted and urges it to search for 

suitable ones. Just as you could plant Zayd before the listener and reel off many of his 

attributes, saying "Zayd is learned, Zayd is clever, he is this, he is that;" so too by saying: 

"they (ûlâ'ika)" then putting the [pronoun] "they (hum)," the Qur'an excites the imagination 

so that it comes up with things consonant with their attributes. For example, "They are on 

guidance," "they shall prosper," "they shall escape Hell-fire," "they shall win Paradise," "they 

shall succeed in attaining to the vision of Allâh's beauty (May He be exalted)," and so on. 

 The definite article "the (al)" portrays reality, as though saying: "If you want to see 

the truth about those who shall prosper, look in the mirror of "they (ûlâ'ika)" and it will 

depict it for you." Or [its purpose] is to specify them, as though saying: "If you have heard 

who it is that shall prosper and attain to happiness and you want to learn what they're like, 

look at 'they (ûlâ'ika),' for that is [how they are]." Or [its purpose is] to clarify what is being 

stated and make it evident, like wâliduhu al-'abd (his father is [a] slave); that is, the fact 

that his father is a slave is known and obvious. [For although the predicate should have 

been indefinite, it was made definite.] 

 "Who  shall  prosper  (muflihûn)"  is  absolute  to  make  it  general.  For  the  Qur'an 

addresses all classes of people with their different aspirations: some of them want to be 

saved from Hell-fire; others aspire only to Paradise; and others seek only divine pleasure; 

yet  others  yearn  for  the  vision  of  divine  beauty;  and  so  forth.  The  Qur'an  has  put  it  in 

absolute form to make the table of its favours general so that everyone may pick what they 

fancy.

Verse	6	

 َنﻮُﻨِﻣ ْﺆُﯾ َﻻ ْﻢُھ ْرِﺬْﻨُﺗ ْﻢَﻟ ْمَا ْﻢُﮭَﺗ ْرَﺬْﻧَاَء ْﻢِﮭْﯿَﻠَﻋ ٌءاَﻮَﺳ اوُﺮَﻔَﻛ  َﻦﯾِﺬﱠﻟا  ﱠنِا 

 As to those who reject faith, it is the same to them whether you warn them or do 

not  warn  them;  they  will  not  believe  (Inna  alladhîna  kafarû  sawâun  'alayhim  a' 

andhartahum am lam tundhirhum lâ yu'minûn) 

 Its positioning [and relationship with what precedes it]: 

 Consider this: in the world of His pre-eternal attributes, the Unique Being has two 

manifestations, those pertaining to His Glory and those pertaining to His Beauty. Through 

their  manifestation  in  the  world  of  the  attributes  of  actions,  they  appear  as  grace  and 

wrath, and goodness and majesty. Then inclining to the world of actions, adornment and 

embellishment (tahliya, tazyin) arise, and demonstrate that the Creator is exempt from 

the attributes of creatures (takhlîya, tanzîh). Then, being imprinted on the world of the 

hereafter,  which  is  one  of  the  worlds  of  works  ('âlam  alâthâr),  grace  is  manifested  as 

Paradise and light, and wrath is manifested as Hell and fire. And being reflected in the 

world of remembrance, recollection is divided into praise (al-hamd) and glorification (al-

tasbîh). And being represented in the world of speech, they diversify into command and 

prohibition. And being depicted in the world of guidance, they divide into encouragement 

and  restraint,  and  reassurance  and  warning.  And  through  their  manifestation  in  the 

conscience, hope and fear are born. And so on. Moreover, it is the mark of guidance to 

preserve the balance between hope and fear, in order that hope may induce striving and 

work,  and  fear  may  restrain  from  transgression,  and  a  person  will  not  despair  of  divine 

mercy  and  opt  out  in  blameworthy  fashion,  or  feel  sure  he  will  not  be  punished  so 

unconcernedly go astray. It is because of this successive wisdom that the Qur'an does not 

encourage without restraining, nor praise the righteous without censuring sinners. 

-If you were to ask: Why is there no conjunction here, between this and 

the previous verse, as there is in the verse, "As for the righteous, they will be in bliss * 

And the wicked, they will be in the Fire." (82: 13-14)? 

 You would be told: A conjunction is apt in so far as the relationship [between the 

two parts of speech it is joining] is apt, and the aptness of the relationship depends on 

71 

 

 

#72 

 

[both parts being congruent and] following the same aim. But because different aims are 

being followed here [in this verse and the previous one], the conjunction was not deemed 

fitting. For the praise of the believers leads to and is preliminary to praise of the Qur'an, 

and it is its result and is driven to it. While the censure of the unbelievers is in order to 

restrain and frighten, and is not the prelude to praise of the Qur'an. 

  

eloquence: 

Now consider the subtleties in the positioning of the parts of this verse: 

 Firstly  familiarize  yourself  with  [the  intensive  particle]  "inna"  and  [the  relative 

pronoun] "those who (alladhîna)," for they are the most itinerant and roaming of whatever 

you will encounter in the Qur'an in the waystations of revelation. For some reason or other, 

the Qur'an mentions them frequently, for besides the fine points they express particular to 

the  places  they  are  used,  they  comprise  two  general  subtleties  from  the  jewels  of 

 It is characteristic of "inna" to pierce the surface and delve into the truth, and fasten 

the purport of its sentence to it. As though it is itself the root and sinks into the truth. For 

example, "Indeed, it is thus:" that is, what is being stated is not imaginary, or contrived, 

or subjective, or newly invented; it is a constant truth. [The grammarians] say that [the 

purpose of] "inna" is to establish or confirm facts (li'l-tahqîq), and therefore denotes this 

fact and characteristic. The particular point here is that "inna" repels doubt and denial, 

although these were completely lacking in the Prophet (UWBP), who was being addressed; 

it alludes therefore to his overwhelming desire that [the deniers] should come to believe. 

 Now  for  "those  who  (alladhîna);"  know  that  it  is  characteristic  of  [the  relative 

pronoun] "alladhî" to indicate something new and strange that the mind perceives before 

the eyes, which is not emphatic but born of a combination of things. For this reason you 

will  see  that  among  the  particles  and  pronouns  of  demonstration  "alladhî,"  the  relative 

pronoun, is the easiest on the tongue and the one most used in denoting the change and 

renewal of subjects. For when that which was to establish truth and reality, that is the 

Qur'an, appeared, some things (anwâ pl. of naw') were cancelled and vanished, and others 

were formed and new truths were born. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

72 

#73 

Consider the Era of Ignorance, how social relations (anwâ) were based on national 

ties, and social mores (lit. truths - haqâ'iq) were based on tribalism. Then when the Qur'an 

came,  it  severed  those  ties  and  destroyed  those  mores,  and  established  other  relations 

(anwâ') in their place, the bonds of religion. Now reflect on this! When the Qur'an rose 

shining  over  humankind,  hearts  bloomed  and  became  fruitful  through  its  light,  and  a 

luminous  truth  was  produced,  which  was  the  class  (naw')  of  believers.  Then  because  of 

their iniquity, some souls putrified in the face of that light and a venomous truth was born, 

the particular characteristic of the class of unbelievers. Between the "who (alladhîna)" in 

this verse and that [in verse 3] there is also a reciprocity, [because they both point to a 

truth which is the reverse of the other]. 

 Know  that  like  the  definite  article,  the  relative  pronoun  is  used  to  express  five 

meanings, the best known of which is its denoting something known (al-'ahd). The "who 

(alladhîna)" here alludes to notable unbelievers like Abu Jahl, Abu Lahab, and Umayya ibn 

Khalaf,  who  died  in  a  state  of  unbelief.  In  this  respect  therefore,  the  verse  gives  news 

about the unseen realm [it is a prophecy of the future]. Born of these flashes, and others 

like  them,  is  a  sort  of  miraculousness,  there  being  four  sorts  of  miraculousness  or 

inimitability pertaining to the Qur'an's meanings (al-i'jâz al-ma'nawi). 

 The word "[Those who] reject faith (kafarû):" unbelief is darkness, consisting of 

the denial of something brought by the Messenger (Upon whom be blessings and peace), 

after having had certain knowledge of it. 

been dispute over its meanings? 

 -If you were to ask: The Qur'an is one of the essentials of religion, yet there has 

 You would be told: In every passage of the Qur'an there are three propositions: 

 The First: This is Allâh's Word. 

 The Second: Its intended meaning is the truth. 

 It is unbelief to deny these two. 

 The Third: Its intended meaning is this. 

 If this last proposition is incontestible or expounded, it is compulsory to believe in 

it once one is informed about it and to deny it is unbelief. If it is clear or is a verse that 

has another possible meaning, it is not unbelief to deny it since it is open to interpretation. 

Interpretation  however  should  not  be  based  on  personal  whims.  Unanimously  reported 

Hadiths are the same as Qur'anic verses in this regard. However, where there is denial of 

the first proposition in connection with Hadiths, these should be considered carefully. 

 

 

73 

[That  is,  the  Hadith's  authenticity  and  the  unanimity  concerning  it  should  be 

#74 

considered carefully.] 

be reconciled? 

 -If you were to ask: Unbelief is ignorance yet in the Qur'an it says: "The People of 

the Book know this as they know their own sons." (2:146) How can these two statements 

 You would be told: There are two sorts of unbelief. The first is due to ignorance; a 

person denies because he does not know. The second is obstinate rejection; a person knows 

but does not accept; he is certain but does not believe; he affirms but his conscience does 

not submit. Think carefully about this! 

- If you were to ask: Does Satan know Allâh in his heart? 

 You would be told: No, because due to his innate disposition his heart is continuously 

preoccupied with leading people astray, and his mind continuously thinks of unbelief and 

inculcating it in others. He never ceases doing this. The idea of unbelief never quits his 

head so that knowledge of Allâh might become established in it. 

- If you were to ask: Unbelief is an attribute of the heart, so how can wearing the 

'zunnar' {[*]: al-Zunnâr - a rope girdle worn by Eastern Christians, Jews, and Magi.} and the 

hat, which has been compared to it, be unbelief? 

 You would be told: The Shari'a acknowledges the outward signs of hidden matters. 

It even recognizes apparent causes that have no reason ('illa) as the reason. So since some 

girdles  hinder  bowing  in  prayer  and  some  hats  prevent  full  prostration,  it  deems  the 

wearing of them a reason for unbelief. For they both infer the renouncing of worship and 

imitation of unbelievers, betokening appreciation of their outlook and nationality. Thus, 

so long as the hidden matter is not decisively disproved, judgement is made according to 

its outward signs. 

- If you were to ask: If they have no warning, why should people be held accountable? 

 You would be told: To rebut their arguments and excuses. [For they could say: We 

weren't told that we would be held to account, and did not know about it. And this could 

save them from punishment.] {[*]: Nursi, İsârâtû'l-İ'caz [Abdûlmecid], 85.} 

 

  

  

  

  

 

74 

- If you were to ask: Since their obstinate rejection is foretold, it means they are 

prevented from believing. Isn't it therefore impossible to hold them responsible? 

 You would be told: Neither the prediction, nor divine knowledge or will 

are connected to their unbelief independently of the cause. They are connected to it only 

through their wills (ikhtiyâr). There is detailed discussion of this below. It is because of 

this that it is said: "An obligation [imposed by] will is not inconsistent with [or opposed to] 

#75 

will." 

  

- If you were to ask: Isn't it reasonably possible for them to believe in the verse that 

states they will not believe? So isn't this a contradiction in terms? 

 You  would  be  told:  They  are  not  being  ordered  to  believe  in  every  detail  of  the 

Qur'an, that it should be impossible. Also, the verb "(who) reject faith (lit. disbelieved) 

(kafarû)"  being  in  the  perfect  tense  infers  that  they  chose  unbelief  after  the  truth  had 

become clear, so the warning was futile. [As the word sawâ'un - it is the same - indicates.] 

{[*]: Nursi, İşârâtû'l-İ'caz [Abdûlmecid], 79.} 

 

  

 

 Now for "the same (sawâ'un);" it is a figure of speech meaning: whether it is futile 

or has the desired result, it makes no difference whether or not you warn them. That is, 

there's no reason for you either to warn them or to not warn them. 

 "To (lit. on) them ('alayhim):" in this is a sign that they shall remain on the earth but 

not raise their heads and heed their leaders. It also implies: "But it is not the same for you, 

[O Muhammad!, whether you warn them or not], for it is meritorious for you to convey the 

message; indeed, 'The Messenger's duty is but to proclaim [the Message]."' (5:99) 

"Whether  you  warn  them  or  do  not  warn  them  (a'  andhartahum  am  lam 

tundhirhum):" the "whether (a' - hamza)" and "or (am)" here are like letters signifying "the 

same  (sawâ'un)"  and  corroborate  "the  same"  in  the  first  [phrase  of  the  verse].  Or  [their 

purpose] is to direct attention to the two meanings of it mentioned above. 

 - If you were to ask: Why is this 'sameness' expressed in interrogative form (sûrat al-

istifhâm)? [That is, the "a'" of "a' andhartahum."] 

 You would be told: If you want to alert the person you are addressing subtly yet 

convincingly to the fact that what he is doing is futile, you have to question him so as to 

draw his attention to it. [Then] he can switch mentally from the act to its result and feel 

 

75 

certain.  There  is  also  a  connection  between  the  interrogative  form  and  the  sameness, 

because  the  question  comprises  it.  For  as  far  as  the  questioner  knows,  it  is  the  same 

whether or not the thing about which he is asking exists. Moreover, very often the answer 

also implies this sameness. 

 

#76 

(andhartahum)" in the perfect tense? 

So you know what'll happen!" 

 - If you were to ask: Why is the warning expressed by "you warn (lit. warned) them 

 You would be told: So that it might proclaim: "You've tried it before, O Muhammad! 

 - If you were to ask: Why does it say "or whether you do not warn them (am lam 

tundhirhum)" although it is clearly pointless not to warn them? 

 You  would  be  told:  Warning  a  person  may  increase  his  obstinacy,  but  remaining 

silent may induce him to think fairly. 

 

 

 - If you were to ask: Why, although the Prophet (UWBP) is both a bringer of glad 

tidings and a warner, does this verse only warn and intimidate? 

 You would be told: Because intimidation is fitting for unbelief; and because repelling 

harm is preferable to attracting benefits and more effective; and because the intimidation 

here causes the imagination to tremble and makes it realize that after the words "they will 

not believe (Iâ yu'minûn)," it will be faced with "whether or not you give them glad tidings 

[it is the same for them]." 

 Know that all speech has a literal meaning and a hidden purpose. This too has subtle 

hovering  meanings,  and  a  purpose  that  unfolds,  which  is  to  alleviate  the  Prophet's 

difficulties and relieve his stress, and to console him and advise him to follow the earlier 

prophets. For most of them were addressed similarly. Noah, even, said after receiving such 

an  address:  "...  Leave  not  of  the  unbelievers  a  single  one  on  the  earth!"  (71:26)  Also, 

because the Qur'an's verses resemble mutually reflecting mirrors, and the stories of the 

prophets  are  like  a  halo  around  the  moon,  they  look  to  the  Prophet's  (Upon  whom  be 

blessings and peace) situation. It is as though this passage is saying: "This is a natural divine 

law that has to be obeyed." 

  

 

 

76 

Having made this analysis, know that with all their parts this verse and the next one 

up to "great is the penalty they incur (wa la-hum 'adhâbun 'azîm)" are so delivered that 

they  infer  the  abomination  of  unbelief  and  scorn  of  it,  and  cause  aversion  to  it  and 

implicitly deter from it, and humiliate the unbelievers and mark them out, and scare others 

away from it and threaten them. With their words these verses proclaim that unbelief is a 

terrible calamity, the loss of vast bounties, the onset of severe suffering, and the cessation 

of elevated pleasures. They state explicitly that unbelief is the most repulsive of things, 

and the most harmful. As follows: 

 The  replacement  of  'they  do  not  believe'  (lam  yu'minû)  with  "they  disbelieve  or 

reject faith (kafarû)" indicates that due to their lack of belief they 

 

#77 

happiness. 

have  fallen  into  the  darkness  of  disbelief,  which  is  a  calamity  that  corrupts  the  very 

substance of man's spirit, and impl ies that it is a source of suffering. And the replacement 

of  'they  do  not  give  up  unbelief  (lâ  yatrukûna  al-kufr)  with  "they  will  not  believe  (lâ 

yu'minûn)"  indicates  that  due  to  this  loss  they  have  lost  their  belief,  the  source  of  all 

 With  the  phrase  "Allâh  has  set  a  seal  on  their  hearts  (Khatama  Allâhu  'alâ 

qulûbihim)"  it  indicates  that  having  come  to  disbelieve,  their  hearts  and  consciences, 

which receive life, joy, happiness, and attain to perfection only through the manifestation 

of the divine truths through the light of belief, become like ruined buildings desolate and 

swarming with vermin and noxious things. So their doors are locked and sealed up, and 

they are shunned. They are abandoned and left to the scorpions and monsters. 

 With the phrase "and on their hearing (wa 'alâ sam'ihim)" it indicates that due to 

their unbelief they have lost the immense bounty of hearing, for when the light of belief 

constantly [shines] behind and informs his ear, it is affected by the cries of all the world 

and  understands  the  invocations  of  its  beings.  It  hears  the  universe's  vociferations  and 

understands  its  glorifications.  Indeed,  when  the  ear  hears  the  dominical  speech  in  the 

sighing of the blowing wind, the peals of the rolling thunder-clouds, the refrains of the 

billowing sea, the clamour of the throbbing stones, the pattering of the fAll-ing rain, and 

the songs of the twittering birds, and understands their lofty glorifications, the universe 

becomes a vast orchestra for him. It arouses in his heart an elevated sorrow and excites 

passion  in  his  spirit.  He  feels  sad  on  recalling  his  friends  and  companions,  but  it  is  a 

pleasurable sadness at their absence. It is not that he has no friends, so is distraught. But 

when the ear is blocked up by disbelief, it becomes deaf to these delightful sounds and it 

 

77 

hears nothing from the universe except cries of mourning and the lamentations of death. 

This arouses in the heart the pathetic sorrow of the orphan; that is, the lack of friends; 

and the desolation of alienation; that is, being without owner or guardian. It is for this 

reason that the Shari'a deems lawful such sounds as excite an elevated love and the sorrow 

of love, and it declares unlawful any that inflame the carnal appetites and produce the 

sorrow of the orphan. Any the Shari'a does not specify for you, judge for yourself according 

to the effect they have on your spirit and conscience. 

 The phrase "and on their eyes is a veil (wa 'alâ absârihim ghishâwatun)" alludes to 

the loss of a huge bounty in consequence of their unbelief. For when the eye is illuminated 

with the light of belief dwelling behind its pupil, the light assists and impels it, and the 

whole universe becomes a 

 

#78 

garden for it bedecked with flowers and houris. The eye's pupil becomes a bee, flying hither 

and  thither  gathering  from  the  blooms  the  juices  of  reflection,  thought,  familiarity, 

friendliness,  love,  and  felicitation.  It  takes  up  its  load,  which  in  the  conscience  is 

transformed into the honey of perfections. 

 But if, God forbid!, the eye becomes dimmed and lustreless through disbelief, the 

world becomes a prison in its view, its truths are hidden from it, and the universe becomes 

a wasteland, causing such pain to the heart that it overwhelms the conscience completely. 

 Moreover,  with  the  phrase  "great  is  the  penalty  they  incur  (wa  la-hum  'adhâbun 

'azîm)" it indicates a fruit of the Zaqqum-tree of unbelief in the next world, which is the 

torment of Hell and the terrible punishment of divine wrath. 

 While  "they  will  not  believe  (lâ  yu'minûn)"  corroborates  "the  same  (sawâ'un)," 

explicating the manner of the sameness.

 Allâh has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing. And on their eyes is a veil; 

and great is the penalty they incur. (Khatama Allâh 'alâ qulûbihim wa 'alâ sam'ihim, wa 

'alâ absârihim ghishâwatun wa la-hum 'adhâbun 'azîm.) 

 Consider this: at this point we have to stop to listen to what the scholars of kalâm 

have to say, for a fierce war has been waged around this verse, between the Mu'tazilites, 

the Jabriyya, and the Sunnis. Wars like this have caught the attention of observers. It is 

appropriate therefore to mention the main arguments so they may be benefited from. [It 

will be seen then that] the Sunni School is the Straight Path, and the others either go to 

excess or are deficient. 

The First: It has been established that "there is no effective agent in the universe 

other than Allâh." Hence, there is no delegation of power, [as the Mu'tazilites asserted, 

that man creates his own actions]. {[*]: Nursi, İşârâtû'l-İ'caz [Abdûlmecid], 83.} 

The Second: "Allâh is All-Wise," so reward and punishment are not futile or without 

wisdom. Hence there is no compulsion. Just as divine unity (tawhîd) strikes the Mu'tazilites 

on the chest, so Allâh being free of anthropomorphic elements (tanzîh) deals the Jabriyya 

a slap in the mouth. 

 The  Third:  Everything  has  two  aspects:  the  outer  (mulkiyya)  aspect,  which  is 

sometimes good and sometimes bad. Different forms intrude on it in succession, like the 

back of a mirror. The inner aspect (malakûtiyya) looks to the Creator. It is transparent in 

every respect, like the front of a mirror. Thus, the creation of bad is not bad, because its 

creation  in  respect  of  the  inner  face  (malakûtiyya)  is  good.  The  creation  of  bad  is  to 

complete the good, so is indirectly good. So pay no attention to the specious arguments of 

the Mu'tazilites! 

  

 

 

79 

ٰ
#80 

 The Fourth: The al-hâsil bi'l-masdar is the outcome of the verbal noun (masdar), 

like death (al-hâsil bi'l-masdar) is the outcome of murder (qatl verbal noun) and pain is 

the  outcome  (al-hâsil  bi'l-masdar)  of  a  blow  (darb  -  verbal  noun).  The  outcome  of  the 

verbal  noun  is  something  fixed,  created,  and  lifeless,  and  attributes  cannot  be  derived 

from it. [that is, the active particle cannot be derived from something lifeless (jâmid), as 

is well-known in grammar ('ilm al-sarf.) The verbal noun (al-masdar), however, is acquired 

(maksûb), relative (nisbî), and hypothetical (i'tibârî) and attributes can be derived from 

it.  Thus,  the  Creator  of  murder  (qatl)  cannot  be  the  murderer  (qâtil).  So  leave  the 

Mu'tazilites "to plunge in vain discourse and trifling." (See, 6:91) 

  

 

 

 

 

The Fifth: Apparent actions are generally the result of a succession of acts that end 

in a person's 'inclination' (mayalân), called will (al-juz' alikhtiyârî). It is around this point 

that the arguments have revolved. 

 The Sixth: It is Allâh's practice that His universal will looks to the particular will of 

His servant, [That is, it is manifested in accordance with the servant's will] so there is no 

compulsion. 

 The Seventh: Knowledge is dependent on the thing known; the thing known is not 

dependent on knowledge, otherwise it would be a circular argument. So a person cannot 

make  excuses  concerning,  [or  disclaim  responsibility  for],  his  actions  by  ascribing  their 

magnitude and measure to divine determining (qadar) [by claiming they are determined]. 

 The Eighth: The creation of the hâsil bi'l-masdar is dependent on the 'acquisition' of 

the verbal noun (masdar) through the functioning of the divine laws in the universe (âdât 

Allâh ta'âla) in accordance with the conditions He has laid down for them. And the nucleus 

and life-force in the acquisition of the verbal noun is inclination (mayalân), and when this 

is solved, the nub of the question is solved. 

 The Ninth: Preference [something being preferable] without a cause or attribute to 

cause it is impossible, but choice without a cause or attribute to cause it is not impossible. 

Thus, no aim (gharad) or cause ('illa) is necessary in Allâh's actions; the only agent of choice 

(murajjih) is His will. 

 

80 

 The Tenth: An existent matter must necessarily have an effective agent (mu'aththir) 

[to bring it into existence], otherwise preference without a cause or attribute to cause it 

would be necessary, and this is impossible as shown above. However, a theoretical matter 

(i'tibârî) [like human will and inclination] can be specified (takhassus) without a specifier 

(mukhassis); 

 

#81 

this is not necessarily impossible. [That is, since man's inclinations do not have external 

existence, they do not require a cause.] 

 The Eleventh: A being has to be necessary for it to come in to existence; that is, a 

thing cannot come into existence if its existence is not necessary; its existence becomes 

necessary only on the conjunction of two wills, universal will and particular will; it then 

has  existence  instantaneously.  But  theoretical  things  can  be  preferable  (tarajjuh)  and 

specified  without  reaching  the  degree  of  necessity,  so  this  does  not  necessitate  a 

contingent being coming into existence without an effective agent (mu'aththir). 

 The  Twelfth:  The  knowledge  that  a  thing  exists  does  not  necessitate  knowing  its 

nature; and the absence of such knowledge does not necessitate its non-existence. So the 

inability to define the true nature of will does not contradict its certain existence. 

 If  you  have  comprehended  these  principles,  listen  now  to  what  shall  be  said:  we 

Sunnis say: O Mu'tazilites! the bondsman [of Allâh] is not creator of the hâsil bi'l-masdar, 

that is, the results of his actions. He is only the masdar or source of his actions. For "there 

is no effective agent in existence other than Allâh." Divine unity (tawhid) necessitates this. 

Now we say to the Jabriyya: man is not under compulsion for he has (particular) will (juz' 

ikhtiyâri), for Allâh is All-Wise. Moreover, Allâh's being exempt from all defect necessitates 

 -If you were to ask: Whenever man's will is dissected, the only thing to appear is 

it. 

 

predestination (al-jabr)? 

 You would be told: 

 Firstly: The conscience and innate disposition both testify to something elusive that 

distinguishes between a voluntary matter and a compulsory one, and the existence of which 

is certain. But we are not at fault if we cannot define it. 

 Secondly: We say that if inclination (mayalân) is something existent, as the Ash'ari's 

claim,  then  the  disposal  of  it  is  a  theoretical  matter  and  pertains  to  man.  [That  is, 

switching the inclination from one act to another.] {[*]: Nursi, İsârâtû' 1-İ'caz [Abdûlmecid], 

 

81 

85. See also, İsârâtû'l-İ'caz [Sağlam], 100.} But if inclination is a theoretical matter, as the 

Maturidis  say,  its  existence  (thubût)  and  being  specified  (takhassus)  do  not  require  a 

necessitating cause (al-'illa al-tamma), so an inclination does not necessarily have to be 

acted upon. [That is, very often no action occurs on the occurrence of an inclination. Thus, 

there is no compulsion.] Think about this carefully! 

 

#82 

 In Short: The hâsil bi'l-masdar is dependent, in accordance with the laws of divine 

practice  in  the  universe,  on  the  masdar  or  source,  the  basis  of  which  is  inclination 

(mayalân). And neither inclination itself, nor the disposal of it, has [external] existence so 

that being applied this way or that it should be a contingent being and need an effective 

agent,  or  that  there  should  have  been  preference  without  something  to  cause  it.  Also, 

neither inclination nor the disposal of it is non-existent that it should not be amenable to 

being  a  condition  for  the  creation  of  the  hâsil  bi'l-masdar,  or  a  cause  of  reward  or 

punishment. 

  

will and remove it? 

-If you were to ask: Don't pre-eternal knowledge and pre-eternal will pluck out free 

 You  would  be  told:  Knowledge  of  a  voluntary  action  does  not  negate  the  will. 

[Because  the  effective  agent  is  power,  not  knowledge,  which  is  dependent  on  what  is 

known.] {[*]: Nursi, İşârâtû'l-İ'caz [Abdûlmecid], 85.} 

 Also, pre-eternal knowledge is all-encompassing like the sky, it is not the beginning 

of a chain or the starting-point of past time so that effects should be erroneously ascribed 

to it in disregard of their causes. 

 Also,  knowledge  is  dependent  on  the  thing  known  -  that  is,  on  how  the  thing  is. 

Knowledge also encompasses it - so the measure and criteria of the thing known are not 

based on the principles of divine determining (qadar). 

 Also, divine will does not look to the cause once and separately to the effect once, 

rendering the will and the cause ineffective. Indeed, it looks at once to cause and effect. 

In  consequence,  if  for  example  one  person  kills  another  with  a  rifle  and  we  posit  the 

absence of any cause, would the person have died that instant or not? The Jabriyya say: 

he would have died even if he had not been killed. For they assert that divine will deals 

with cause and effect separately, and that there is a disjunction between them. And the 

Mu'tazilites say: he would not have died. For according to them, it is permissible that the 

effect (lit. what is intended) may 'lag behind' divine will. As for the Sunnis, they say: We 

 

82 

discontinue  [the  argument  and]  are  silent.  For  to  assume  the  absence  of  any  cause 

necessitates  assuming  that  divine  will  and  knowledge  are  unconnected  with  the  effect. 

Whereas will and knowledge look to both together. This false assumption necessitates an 

impossibility. Think about this carefully! 

 

#83 

A Second Introduction 

 Consider this: the Naturalists say that causes have an actual effect, the Zoroastrians 

say that evil has another creator, and the Mu'tazilites assert that living beings create their 

[own]  voluntary  actions.  The  three  are  based  on  a  false,  deluded  idea,  are  pure  error, 

exceed the mark, and are false analogies that have duped [those people] and led them 

astray.  For  proceeding  from  these  assertions  they  have  declared  Allâh  free  of 

anthropomorphic elements (tanzîh), or so they supposed, and have fallen into the trap of 

associating  partners  with  Him  (shirk).  If  you  want  to  learn  the  details,  listen  to  the 

following matters, which also dispel their delusions. 

 The First: Man's hearing, speech, observation, and thought are all particular; he can 

attend to things only one at a time in succession. Similarly, his aspiration is particular; he 

can busy himself with things only in turn. 

 The Second: Man's worth is proportionate to what he is. And what he is has value to 

the extent of his aspiration. And his aspirations are valuable relatively to the importance 

of the aims to which he devotes himself. 

 The Third: Man loses himself in whatever he turns his attention to and gets caught 

up in it. It is due to this that you see that in their daily lives, people do not ascribe lowly 

things  and  insignificant  matters  to  great  and  lofty  persons,  but  to  causes  and 

intermediaries. They suppose that it would be unfitting for their dignity for them to be 

preoccupied  with  petty  matters  and  that  they  would  not  condescend  to  such  things,  or 

expend their efforts on things of no consequence. Such trivia would be unequal to their 

vast ambitions. 

 The Fourth: It is characteristic of man that when he reflects on something in order 

to weigh it up, he first of all seeks criteria for it and its relations and principles, in his own, 

self;  then  in  his  fellow  humans;  and  if  he  cannot  find  them  there,  in  other  contingent 

beings around him. When he ponders over the Necessarily Existent, even, Who in no way 

resembles contingent beings, his surmising faculty (al-quwwat al-wâhima) forces him to 

take the above-mentioned evil delusion as his principle, and use that deceptive analogy as 

 

83 

a telescope. However, the Maker (May His glory be exalted) cannot be observed from this 

point, for His power cannot be restricted. 

 The Fifth: "And Allâh's is the highest similitude," (16:60) His power, knowledge, and 

will (May His glory be exalted) are like the light of the sun, they embrace everything and 

encompass all matters. They cannot be restricted or be compared with anything. Just as 

they look to (ta'alluq) the 

 

#84 

vastest things, like the divine throne, so they look to the smallest, like an atom. And just 

as they create the sun and moon, so they create the eyes of the flea and gnat. And just as 

they lay down the elevated order of the universe, so they place a fine order in the guts of 

microscopic  organisms.  And  just  as  they  bind  together  the  celestial  bodies  and  stars, 

suspended [in space] by that law of His known as gravity, so they order minute particles 

through a similar law, as infinitesimal samples of them. It is through the intervention of 

impotence that different degrees occur in power. So all things are equal in the face of the 

power  of  the  One  for  whom  impotence  is  impossible.  For  impotence  is  the  opposite  of 

essential power. {[*]: For the New Said's cogent proofs of divine power, see the Twentieth 

Letter, Nursi, Letters 1928-1932 (Istanbul: Sözler Publications, 2001), 291-99.} 

 The  Sixth:  Divine  power  looks  first  (ta'alluq)  to  the  inner  face  (malakûtiyya)  of 

things, and this in all things is transparent and beautiful, as discussed. Yes, just as the Most 

High made the face of the sun burnished and shining and the moon incandescent, so He 

made the inner face of the night and clouds luminous and beautiful. 

 The  Seventh:  The  human  mind  does  not  have  the  breadth  and  scope  to  measure 

divine grandeur (May He be exalted), weigh up [the Most High's] perfections, or to judge 

His attributes. This is not possible except in one respect {[*]: That is, the human mind can 

comprehend the divine attributes only to the extent a person can attain knowledge of them 

through observation of the divine works.} - they may be gauged only from the sum total of 

His  artefacts,  and  from  what  is  manifested  of  all  His  works,  and  from  what  may  be 

epitomized from all His acts. Yes, an atom can only be a mirror, not the measure. 

 

 

 If  you  have  understood  these  matters,  know  that  the  Necessary  Being  (Be  He 

exalted) cannot be compared with contingent beings, for they are as different from one 

another as are the ground and the Pleiades. Surely you can see that it was because of this 

false comparison, that with the Naturalists, the Mu'tazilites, and Zoroastrians their powers 

of delusive imagination overpowered their reasons, and they ascribed an actual effect to 

84 

causes, and the creation of acts to living creatures, and the creation of evil to one other 

than Allâh (May He be exalted!). With their delusions and imaginings they asked how with 

His grandeur, sublimity, and freedom from defect (tanazzuh) Allâh (May He be exalted!) 

would condescend to [create] these base matters and ugly things. To hell with them! How 

could  they  shackle  the  intellect  with  such  a  feeble  delusion?  But  alas!  As  a  whispering 

doubt it afflicts believers also. So be careful to avoid it! 

 

#85 

up." 

 Now to analyze the words of this verse and their positioning: 

 The  fact  that  "has  set  a  seal  (khatama)"  is  tied  to  "they  will  not  believe  (lâ 

yu'minûna)"  and  follows  [immediately]  after  it  is  just  like  making  the  punishment  the 

consequence of the act, as though it is saying, "Since they have corrupted their wills and 

not come to believe, they have been punished by having their hearts sealed and blocked 

 The word(s) "has set a seal (khatama)" also indicate a compound metaphor, which 

alludes  to  parabolic  comparisons  as  a  [literary]  device  (uslûb  tamthîlî),  which  [in  turn] 

signifies  a  proverb  depicting  their  misguidance,  for  what  it  means  is  the  truth  being 

prevented from penetrating to the heart. The term 'seal or sealing' (al-khatm) portrays the 

heart as a house built by Allâh (May He be exalted!) to be a treasury full of jewels. But due 

to the misuse of the will, it has become corrupted and has putrified, and what it contains 

has turned poisonous so it has been locked up and sealed, to make it shunned. 

 The word "Allâh." know that the use of [the proper noun instead of the first person 

pronoun] signifies a turning (iltifat) from the first to the third persons. This comprises a 

subtle  point  pertaining  to  the  intended  (bi'nniyya)  relationship  of  the  word  "Allâh"  with 

"they  will  not  believe  (lâ  yu'minûna);"  I  mean  that  the  implied  "in  Allâh"  indicates  the 

following subtle meaning: when the light of the knowledge of Allâh came to them, they 

did not open the door of their hearts to it, so He turned away from them angrily and locked 

the door on them. 

 The  use  of  "on  ('alâ)"  with  the  transitive  verb  "khatama"  suggests  that  the  verb 

includes the meaning of branding, as though it is saying: Allâh has set a seal on their hearts, 

branding and marking them so the angels see them. "On ('alâ)" also suggests that it is the 

heart's lofty door that is blocked up, not its lowly door that looks onto this world. 

 The word "their hearts (qulûbihim)" precedes hearing and sight because it is the 

seat of belief; and because the first evidences of the Maker are manifested from the heart's 

consultation with itself, and from the conscience referring to the innate disposition. For 

 

85 

when a person consults himself, he feels an acute sense of powerlessness that drives him 

to seek out a point of support, and he perceives his clamouring need to fulfil his hopes and 

is compelled to find a source of assistance. But there is no support to be found and no help 

 What is meant by the heart is the dominical subtle faculty - not the piece of flesh 

shaped like a pine-cone - the emotions of which are manifested in 

except in belief. 

 

#86 

the  conscience  and  the  thoughts  of  which  are  reflected  in  the  mind.  The  term  heart 

indicates that the dominical subtle faculty is to man's spiritual dimensions what the cone-

shaped piece of flesh is to the body. For just as the physical heart is a life-machine that 

pumps the water of life to all the parts of the body, and if it is obstructed or ceases from 

activity, [life departs and] the body stiffens; so the subtle inner faculty dispenses the light 

of  true  life  to  all  the  parts  of  the  corpus  composed  of  man's  spiritual  aspects,  and  his 

[mental] states, and hopes. And if, God forbid, the light of belief fades away, his being, 

with which he contends with the universe, becomes like a motionless spectre, dark in its 

entirety. 

  

"And on their hearing (wa 'alâ sam'ilim):" the repetition of "on ('alâ)" indicates that 

the evidences of each [faculty] are independent. For the heart [points to Allâh] with the 

evidences of the intellect and conscience, and the hearing [points to Him] with evidences 

from the Qur'an and Hadith (naqlî) and from the outside world. Its repetition also hints 

that the sealing up of the hearing is not of the same kind as the sealing up of the heart. 

 Moreover, the singular case of "hearing" despite having a plural on either side of it 

[that is, the heart and the eyes] is an instance of conciseness, and also contains several 

signs: it hints that as a verbal noun, [the act of] hearing (sam') [is performed with the ear, 

which] has no cover [like an eyelid]; and that the one making hear (musmi') is singular; and 

that what is heard (masmû') by each person is singular; and that a person hears one thing 

at a time. And it hints at the partnership of all who hear, as though their ears are united 

becoming one; and at the union of the community and its personification, which makes 

one imagine that its faculty of hearing is singular; and that one person hearing something 

suffices  the  community.  It  was  on  account  of  these  points  that  eloquence  required 

"hearing" to be in the singular. However, the things pertaining to the heart and eyes are 

different,  and  their  ways  are  diverse,  and  their  evidences  differ,  and  they  receive 

instruction from different things, and the things that prompt them are various. For these 

 

86 

reasons the singular intervenes between two plurals. The heart is followed by the hearing 

because the hearing forms the heart's character [that is, mostly information reaches the 

heart through the channel of the ear], and it is closer to it. Also, the hearing resembles 

the heart in that it receives information from the six directions, [from all sides, while the 

eyes only look to the front]. 

 "And on their eyes is a veil (wa 'alâ absârihim ghishâwatun)." know that the change 

of style, that is, the choice of a nominal sentence, indicates 

 

#87 

constant. 

that  in  distinction  to  the  gardens  of  the  hearing  and  heart,  which  are  continuously 

renewed,  the  gardens  of  the  eyes,  from  which  they  gather  up  evidences,  are  fixed  and 

 By ascribing the sealing up of the heart to Allâh (May He be exalted!) and not the 

veiling of the eyes, it suggests that the sealing up is punishment for what they have earned, 

while the veiling is of their own doing. 

 It  is  also  a  sign  that  initially  in  respect  of  the  heart  and  hearing  there  is  choice, 

while in respect of the sight there is compulsion; that is, there is choice only to the extent 

of shutting one's eyes. 

it might be avoided. 

 The term "veil (ghishâwatun)" indicates that the eyes look in only one direction. And 

the use of the indefinite is to show this; that is, the cause of blindness is not known that 

 The precedence of "and on their eyes (wa 'alâ absârihim)" is to direct attention to 

their eyes, for the eyes mirror the secrets of the heart. 

 "Great is the penalty they incur (wa la-hum 'adhâbun 'azîm):" know that just as 

the verse alludes with this phrase to the bitter fruits in this world of the accursed tree of 

unbelief; so it indicates the bitter fruit of that side of it that extends to the hereafter, 

which is the Zaqqum-tree of Hell. 

 Also,  the  style  here  requires  such  phraseology  as  'theirs  will  be  a  terrible 

chastisement' (wa 'alayhim 'iqâbun shadîd). For in substituting words fitting for bounties, 

that is, "la-hum" for 'alayhim, and "'adhâbun" for 'iqâbun, and "'azîm" for shadîd is a sign 

that  it  is  a  sort  of  insinuating,  condemnatory  mockery  as  though  [the  Qur'an]  is  saying: 

"Their  benefit,  their  delight,  their  supreme  bounty  will  be  nothing  but  torment."  This 

resembles  the  saying:  "Greetings  between  them  will  be  a  painful  blow,"  and  the  verse 

"announce to them (lit. the glad tidings of - fa-bashshirhim) a grievous penalty." (3:21) 

For the "la-" of "la-hum - (lit.) to them" denotes the consequences of the action and its 

 

87 

benefits, as though it is reading out to them [mockingly]: "Receive the wages for what you 

have done!" 

 In the word "penalty ('adhâbun)" [the root of which also bears meanings of sweet, 

pleasant, etc.] is an obscure allusion reminding them that they sought pleasure and delight 

in  this  world  through  sinful  acts,  as  though  announcing  to  them:  "Now  taste  the  bitter 

[fruits] of your sweet life!" 

 And in the word "great ('azîm)" is a hidden sign reminding them of the state of [the 

people of] Paradise who receive stupendous bounties, as though it is whispering to them: 

"See the vast bounties you have forfeited and how you have fallen into grievous suffering. 

"Great ('azîm)" also strengthens the tanwîn (indefiniteness) of "penalty ('adhâbun)." 

 

#88 

 - If you were to ask: The sin of unbelief persists a short time but its punishment is 

eternal and unending; how is this conformable with divine justice? And if one does accept 

this, how is it consistent with pre-eternal wisdom? And if one accepts this even, how does 

dominical compassion permit it? 

 You would be told: If one accepts that the penalty is infinite, it is established that 

unbelief perpetrated in finite time is in six respects a crime of infinite proportions: 

 Firstly: The person who dies an unbeliever will remain as such even if he lives to all 

eternity, for he has corrupted the very substance of his spirit. And his corrupted heart has 

the propensity to commit infinite crimes. 

 Secondly: Even if unbelief occurs in finite time, it is an infinite crime and gives the 

lie to infinity, I mean, it denies the whole universe, which testifies to divine unity. 

 Thirdly: Unbelief is ingratitude for infinite bounties. 

 Fourthly:  Unbelief  is  a  crime  against  infinity;  that  is,  the  divine  essence  and 

attributes. 

 Fifthly: As [indicated by] the Hadith: "The heavens and earth contain me not, yet I 

am  contained  in  the  heart  of  the  believer,"  {[*]:  al-'Ajlûni,  Kashf  al-Khafâ',  ii,  195.  For 

details, see, Nursi, Ishârât al-l'jâz [Ihsan Qasim], 86.} the human conscience is in regard to 

its outer face limited and finite, but by virtue of its reality the roots of its inner face spread 

and extend to eternity. In this respect therefore it is infinite. Unbelief however sullies it 

and it dwindles away. 

 Sixthly: Although opposites stubbornly resist each other, they are similar in many 

instances. Thus, on the one hand belief yields the fruits of the delights of Paradise, and on 

the other unbelief produces everlasting suffering and pain. 

 

88 

 

  

 It may be concluded therefore if one puts these six aspects together that infinite 

punishment fits the infinite crime and is pure justice. 

 - If you were to ask: So it is conformable with justice, but what about wisdom, which 

is exempt from creating evils that result in punishment? 

 You  would  be  told:  As  you  have  heard  before,  a  greater  good  should  not  be 

abandoned due to the interspersion of lesser evil, for that would be a greater evil. This is 

because divine wisdom necessitates the existence of relative truths, which are far more 

numerous that actual truths; and their appearance is possible only through the existence 

of evil; and evil can be 

 

#89 

held  within  its  limits  and  prevented  from  its  aggression  only  through  intimidation;  and 

intimidation only truly affects the conscience if it [can be] verified and actualized by the 

existence  of  external  torment;  for  like  the  intellect  and  imagination,  the  conscience  is 

truly  affected  by  intimidation  only  if  it  perceives  from  various  indications  the  eternal, 

external reality of torment. It is pure wisdom therefore after filling people with fear at 

Hell-fire in this world, for it to exist in the next. 

-If  you  were  to  ask:  So  it  is  consistent  with  divine  wisdom  also,  but  how  does 

compassion permit it? 

 You would be told: The unbelievers can be thought of only in terms of non-existence 

or existence in torment. If you think it over in your conscience [you will understand that] 

existence, even if in Hell, is a mercy and better than non-existence. For if you analyze it 

carefully [you will see that] non-existence is pure evil; indeed, non-existence is the source 

of all misfortunes and sins. Whereas existence is pure good, even if in Hell. Furthermore, 

it is in the nature of man's spirit, if it knows that the torment eliminates its crimes and 

sins, to be content with it, to alleviate the burden of shame. It will then acknowledge that 

the punishment is fair and that it deserves it. Out of its love of justice, it receives pleasure 

from it even. There are many honourable people in this world who long for the execution 

of justice on themselves so as to be saved from the shame of their crimes. 

 [The unbelievers] go to Hell and abide there for ever as their perpetual abode, but 

after some time paying the penalty for their actions they grow accustomed to it in a way, 

even if they do not deserve this, and adapt to it. Also, their punishments are reduced and 

mitigated in many ways in recompense for their good deeds in this world, as is indicated 

 

89 

in some Hadiths. These are instances of mercy for them, although they are not worthy of 

them.

Verse	8	

 ۢ
َﻦﯿ

 ٖﻨِﻣ ْٔﻮُﻤِﺑ ْﻢُھﺎَﻣَو ِﺮ ِﺧٰﻻْا  ِم ْﻮَﯿْﻟﺎِﺑَو ِ

ّ8ﺎِﺑ ﺎﱠﻨَﻣٰا ُلﻮُﻘَﯾ  ْﻦَﻣ ِسﺎﱠﻨﻟا  َﻦِﻣَو

 

 “Of the people there are some who say: we believe in Allâh and in the Last Day; 

but they do not really believe.” (Wa min al-nâs man yaqûlu âmannâ bi'llâhi wa bi'l-yawm 

al-âkhir wa mâ hum bi-mu'minîn.) 

The verse's positioning in regard to what precedes it: 

 Just  as  two  parts  of  a  sentence  are  joined  by  a  conjunction  because  they  both 

contribute  to  what  is  being  stated,  and  two  clauses  or  sentences  are  joined  by  a 

conjunction since they serve the same aim; so two stories are joined since they are both 

consistent with the same goal. The conjunction of the story of the dissemblers and that of 

the unbelievers is of this latter sort; that is, the summary of the following twelve verses is 

joined by a conjunction with the substance (ma'âl) of the previous two verses. For since 

the Revelation (al-tanzîl) opens with praise [of itself]: "That is the Book," it entails praise 

of  the  believers  as  the  fruits  of  that  book  (lit.  praise);  and  this  in  turn  requires 

disparagement  of  their  opposites,  since  "things  are  known  by  their  opposites."  Then,  to 

fulfil the purpose of guidance, it is fitting to follow this with the dissemblers, so that all 

types of people should be included. 

-If you were to ask: Why does it deal concisely with the disbelievers and pure unbelief 

in two verses, and then deal at length with dissembling in twelve? 

 You would be told: For several subtle reasons: 

 Firstly:  If  unknown,  an  enemy  is  more  harmful;  and  if  he  is  elusive,  he  is  more 

pernicious; and if he is mendacious, he causes more corruption; and if he is on the inside, 

he is more injurious. For an internal enemy saps one's strength and crumbles one's forces, 

contrarily to external enemies, for they strengthen resolve and solidarity. Alas! The harm 

dissembling has caused 

90 

ٰ
  

  

  

#91 

frequently condemns it. 

Islam is truly immense. It is the cause of the present confusion. For this reason the Qur'an 

 Secondly: The dissembler mixes with the believers and becomes familiar with them 

to  an  extent,  and  grows  accustomed  to  belief  a  little.  He  starts  to  feel  repelled  at  his 

condition because his actions are reviled and condemned. Little by little the confession of 

divine unity trickles from his tongue to his heart. 

 Thirdly:  The  dissembler  surpasses  the  unbeliever  in  such  crimes  as  mockery, 

trickery, fraudulence, cunning, lying, and hypocrisy. 

 Fourthly: The dissembler is usually one of the People of the Book, and a diabolically 

clever scheming swindler. To be prolix about dissembling therefore is perfect eloquence. 

Now to analyze the verse's words: 

 Consider  this:  in  one  respect  "And  of  the  people  (Wa  min  al-nâs)"  is  the  prefixed 

predicate of "who (man)." 

- If you were to ask: Isn't it obvious that the dissembler is one of the people? 

 You  would  be  told:  When  a  statement  is  obvious,  what  is  intended  is  one  of  its 

necessary consequences, and here it is to cause astonishment. It is as though it is saying: 

It is extraordinary that the contemptible dissembler is a human being, for man is noble; it 

is not characteristic of him to stoop to such baseness. 

- If you were to ask: Why is the predicate put first? 

 You  would  be  told:  Precedence  is  more  apt  for  producing  astonishment,  and  for 

concentrating  attention  on  the  subject,  for  that  is  where  the  aim  [of  the  sentence]  is 

found.  Otherwise  one  might  expectantly  pass  [from  the  subject]  to  the  predicate  [and 

partially overlook the subject and aim]. 

 Several subtle points may be distilled from the expression "the people (al-nâs):" 

 Firstly:  The  Qur'an  did  not  specify  [the  dissemblers]  and  expose  them,  indeed,  it 

concealed them under the term "the people." This indicates that shielding them and not 

lifting the veil from their repugnant faces was more consistent with the Prophet's policies 

(Upon whom be blessings and peace). For if it had exposed them, the believers would have 

wavered, for no one is safe from the tricks of the soul, and doubts would have led to fear, 

and fear to hypocrisy, and hypocrisy to dissembling. Also, if attention had been drawn to 

 

91 

their ugliness it might have been said that the Prophet (UWBP) was hesitant and did not 

trust his followers. And sometimes, if 

 

#92 

corruption  remains  concealed  it  subsides  by  degrees  and  the  one  perpetrating  it 

endeavours  to  hide  it.  But  if  the  veil  is  raised,  in  consequence  of  the  saying:  "If  you're 

shameless you can do as you like!", {[*]: This is based on a Hadith related from Abu Mas'ûd 

'Uqba ibn 'Amr al-Ansâri and cited by al-Bukhâri: "One thing people have understood from 

the  words  of  the  prophethood  is:  'You  can  do  you  what  you  like  so  long  as  you  feel  no 

shame.'" al-Bukhâri, Sahih, iv, 215; alSuyû.tî, al-Durar al-Muntathira, 35. See, Nursi, lshârât 

al-l'jâz if ihsan Qâsim], 89; Badıllı, Kudsî Kaynakları, 812.} he would exclaim, "It doesn't 

matter what happens!," and unconcernedly spread depravity. 

 Secondly:  The  term  "the  people  (al-nâs)"  indicates  that  quite  apart  from  other 

attributes  opposed  to  dissembling,  the  most  general  of  attributes,  I  mean  humanity,  is 

contrary to it. For man is noble and such degradation is not characteristic of him. 

 Thirdly: It also infers that dissembling is not particular to any group or class, but is 

found in mankind generally, whatever the people. 

 Fourthly: The word hints that dissembling offends the honour of everyone human 

and  inevitably  arouses  their  anger  against  the  person,  and  drives  them  to  restrict  [his 

activities] to prevent the poison spreading. Similarly, it wounds the honour of the group, 

and the disgrace of its member excites [its members'] rage against him. 

  

"Who say: we believe (man yaqûlu âmannâ)" 

 -If  you  were  to  ask:  Why  although  they  both  refer  to  the  same  person,  is  "say 

(yaqûlu)" in the singular case, and "we believe (âmannâ)" in the plural? 

 You would be told: This indicates an exquisitely subtle point which is that the first 

person  plural  is  singular  [to  say:  "we"  is  to  speak  as  one],  and  "say  (yaqûlu)"  is  singular 

because one person is speaking. But "we believe (âmannâ)" is plural because he is not alone 

in his belief. 

 Then is the quotation of their assertions: this form of literal quotation indicates the 

rebuttal in two respects of what is quoted, in the same way that it indicates its forcefulness 

in two respects. For "say (yaqûlu)" hints by its form that they do not speak out of conviction 

or [in consequence of their] actions, but utter with their mouths what is not in their hearts. 

Also, its being in the imperfect tense suggests that the reason for their continuing to defend 

themselves and make this claim is hypocrisy and not prsompted by the conscience. While 

 

92 

their assertion "we believe (âmannâ)" being in the perfect tense suggests: "All of us People 

of  the  Book,  we  have  long  since  believed  so  why  shouldn't  we  believe  now?"  And  the 

pronominal suffix "-nâ - we" 

 

#93 

hints  that  they  say:  "We  are  a  community  and  have  esprit  de  corps',  we  aren't  like  an 

individual who may lie or be deceived." 

"In Allâh and in the Last Day (bi'ilâhi wa bi'l-yawm al-âkhir)" 

 Consider this: the Revelation either takes exactly what others have said, or taking 

its substance, puts in another form, or summarizes it. According to the first of these, by 

mentioning the first and last of the pillars of belief [the dissemblers] are demonstrating 

their firmness [of belief). For in their view, these pillars are the most acceptable. And by 

repeating [the preposition] "in (bâ')" despite the proximity [of the two words], they are 

alluding to the other pillars. Then according to the second [possibility], if it is the Most 

High's word, by mentioning only these two poles of belief, it is indicating that what they 

claim to believe in most powerfully even, is not belief. For their belief in them is not as it 

should be. And the repetition of the preposition "in (bâ')" indicates difference. For belief 

in Allâh is belief in His existence and unity, and belief in the Last Day is belief in its reality 

and that it will come, as was discussed above. [That is, belief in both is multifaceted and 

not only in one respect.] 

 "But they do not really believe (wa mâ hum bi-muminîn)" 

- If you were to ask: Why does the verse not say 'and they do (lit. did) not believe 

(wa mâ âmanû), which would be similar [in tense and form] to "we believe (âmannâ)"! 

 You would be told: Lest it should be supposed that there is any inconsistency, if only 

in form. And so that the negation should not refer to "we believe (âmannâ)," which [despite 

being  a  verb  in  the  perfect  tense]  is  an  exclamatory  clause  (jumla  inshâ'iyya).  Thus  its 

explicitness  disallows  its  denial.  Rather,  the  negation  and  denial  refer  to  the  sentence 

implicit  in  "we  believe  (âmannâ),"  which  is  'for  we  are  believers'  (fa-nahnu  mu'minûn). 

Furthermore, because this negative sentence is a nominal one, it infers that their unbelief 

  

 

  

  

is continuous. 

 

93 

- If you were to ask: Why doesn't it indicate its non-continuance, since the negating 

particle mâ comes at the beginning of the clause? 

 You would be told: Negation is what is signified by the dense [visible] letter (al-harf 

al-kathîf), whereas continuance is signified by the light structure (al-hey'at al-khafîfa) [of 

the nominal clause]. So the negation is closer to what is being expressed. 

 - If you were to ask: What is the subtlety in [the preposition] "bâ"' of "(bi-mu'minîn)" 

being used in the predicate of the negating particle "mâ"! 

 

 

#94 

You  would  be  told:  It  indicates  their  lack  of  ability  to  believe  even  if  they  [appear  to] 

believe outwardly. It is the difference between "mâ Zayd sakhîyan (Zayd is not generous)," 

and "mâ Zayd bi-sakhîyin" the first refers to his capricious character, its meaning is Zayd 

is not actually being generous although he has the ability and is a generous person. While 

the  second  means,  Zayd  does  not  have  the  capacity  to  be  magnanimous  and  is  not  a 

generous person, although he does good works.

The positioning [of this verse and its relationship with the preceding one]: 

 Consider first what the phrases indicate: censure of dissembling; then condemnation 

of it; then denunciation of dissemblers as repugnant; then the threatening of them; then 

intimidation  of  them;  then  amazement  at  them;  then  an  exposition  of  their  aims  as 

expressed  above;  then  an  explanation  of  what  made  them  say  what  they  did;  then  a 

description  of  the  first  of  the  four  misdeeds  arising  from  their  dissembling,  which  are 

deception, corruption, their calling the believers feeble-minded, and their deriding them. 

Then a portrayal of their crimes and artifices by means of an allegorical comparison (isti'âra 

tamthîliyya). It is like this: it depicts their conduct in the face of Allâh (the Most High)'s 

injunctions and towards the Prophet (Upon whom be blessings and peace) and the believers 

- their displaying belief for worldly ends despite inwardly disbelieving. It depicts how Allâh, 

the Prophet and the believers act towards them, gradually enacting the precepts of the 

believers against them, although in Allâh's sight they are the most abominable disbelievers. 

Just like two people tricking each other, or a 

hunter and his prey: the prey senses the hunter on emerging from its hole so scurries back

they deceive (yukhâdi'ûna)," which looks to their first crime, to "because they are false [to 

themselves] (bi-mâ kânû yakdhibûn)." Consider the consecutive consequences inferred by 

these seven phrases, as follows: 

 Firstly:  They  are  shown  to  be  stupid  for  attempting  something  impossible  like 

deceiving Allâh.

and harm. 

 Secondly: They are deemed foolish for harming themselves while seeking their own 

 Thirdly:  They  are  accused  of  ignorance  for  failing  to  distinguish  between  benefit 

 Fourthly: They are scorned for their malignant characters, and their sick sources of 

health and moribund springs of life. 

 Fifthly: They are despised for increasing their sickness while seeking a cure. 

 Sixthly: They are threatened with pure suffering, and nothing but further pain. 

 Seventhly: They are paraded before the people [as the perpetrators of] the ugliest 

of vices; that is, lying. 

illustrated as follows: 

 The  sequence  of  these  seven  phrases,  and  how  each  bears  on  the  next  may  be 

 If you want to hold someone back from doing something and advise him against it, 

you  say  to  him  firstly:  "Hey  you!  You're  an  intelligent  person,  you  can  see  that  this  is 

impossible! And you're fond of youself, so you can understand how harmful it is! And you're 

sensible  too,  so  why  can't  you  tell  the  difference  between  what's  harmful  and  what's 

beneficial? Maybe you have no will, but at least admit that your character is corrupted. It 

is  sick  and  distorts  the  truth  and  makes  you  think  that  what's  sweet  is  bitter.  You're 

searching  for  a  cure,  but  it  only  increases  your  sickness  and  is  no  remedy.  What  you're 

afflicted with resembles insomnia; you try to sleep, but it only upsets you and banishes 

your  sleepiness.  Or  you  resemble  someone  whose  heart  is  assailed  by  worries  and  this 

excessive anxiety only compounds his ailment. Then you seek pleasure but it yields severe 

pain and leads to more terrible suffering, and that contains no pleasure at all. If you don't 

come to your senses immediately and give up all this, nothing remains but to brand you on 

the snout with an ugly mark! Then everyone will know you and your corruption won't spread 

among them!

#97 

 In just the same way, in order to restrain the dissemblers, Allâh the Most High says: 

"Fain would they deceive Allâh (yukhâdi'ûna Allâh)," rather than 'Fain would they deceive 

the  Prophet,'  [also]  pointing  out  their  stupidity.  That  is,  how  could  they  deceive  the 

Prophet (Upon whom be peace) seeing that he is a Messenger from Allâh the Most High. So 

their trickery reverts to Allâh Himself, and it is impossible to trick Allâh the Most High. To 

attempt the impossible is stupidity and such stupidity is only to be wondered at. 

 This  is  followed  by  "but  they  only  deceive  themselves  (wa  mâ  yakhda'ûna  illâ 

anfusahum)," to point out their foolishness. That is, "There is no benefit in what you are 

doing,  only  harm;  and  its  harm  will  turn  back  on  you,  as  though  you  were  deceiving 

yourselves." 

 Following this is "and they realize it not (wa mâ yash'urûn)," to demonstrate their 

ignorance. That is, "You ignorant people! You're further astray than beasts, or solid stones, 

for you can't see the difference between benefit and harm!" 

 This is succeeded by "In their hearts is a disease (fi qulûbihim maradun)" to show 

how contemptible they are, for their natures are corrupted. That is, if you don't have wills, 

at least you should know the sickness for what it is, and that you are depraved. Indeed, 

dissembling and envy are sicknesses of the spirit, the mark of which is to distort the truth 

and change it so that you suppose sweetness to be bitter and bitterness to be sweet, and 

black to be white and white to be black; so don't follow such a path! 

 Then it adds "so Allâh has increased their disease (fa-zâdahum Allâhu maradan)" 

to show their debasement. That is, you want a remedy to be cured of your anger and envy, 

but they are ailments that will only increase your sickness. You are like a person who breaks 

one of his hands, and seeking revenge on someone strikes him with it, causing it multiple 

 Next  it  says  "and  theirs  is  a  grievous  penalty  (wa  la-hum  'adhâbun  alîmun),"  in 

order to threaten them. That is, if you are seeking pleasure through this dissembling of 

yours,  it  will  give  you  nothing  but  ghastly  suffering  now,  and  result  in  more  terrible 

suffering in the hereafter. It is not like other sins, which afford a sort of immediate paltry 

 Finally, it completes the section with "because they are false [to themselves] (bi-

mâ kânû yakdhibûn)," to brand them with the most repulsive stamp. That is, if you don't 

come to your senses, and you haven't come to 

fractures. 

pleasure.

#98 

  

 

your senses, the only solution will be for you to be paraded before the people for lying so 

that they do not put their trust in you and your sickness does not spread. 

Now the positioning of the parts of the phrases relatively to each other: 

The  first  phrase:  that  is,  "Fain  would  they  deceive  Allâh  and  those  who  believe 

(Yukhâdi'ûna Allâh wa alladhîna âmanû):" the use of the term deception to describe their 

act, and of the imperfect tense, and especially the third form of the verb, and particularly 

using the name of Allâh in place of the Prophet, and "who believe (alladhîna âmanû)" in 

place of 'the believers' (al-mu'minûn), all point explicitly to the impossibility of their aim 

to deceive. It thrusts this impossibility before the eyes, making people abominate it and 

shudder at it. For the parabolic metaphor (al isti'âra altamthîlîyya) contained in the word 

'deception' (al-khudâ) arouses revulsion. The heart too recoils at the descriptiveness of the 

imperfect tense and the continuance it infers. 

 As in the verse, "The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto, (42:40) 

the  reciprocity  expressed  by  the  use  of  the  third  form  of  the  verb  suggests  that  their 

deception will be fruitless. For in the third form of the verb, the act of 'the doer' is a cause 

of the act of the one acted upon, and here the latter is a cause of the doer's deception 

being  fruitless  and  without  effect;  indeed,  it  shows  their  deception  to  be  feeble  and 

without substance, like turning the tables on someone. For example, you mock someone 

supposing him to be unaware of it, but inwardly he knows and is secretly mocking you. 

 The  name  "Allâh"  states  explicitly  the  impossibility  of  what  they  intend,  for  to 

deceive the Prophet (Upon whom be peace) entails deceiving Allâh the Most High, and the 

reasoning faculty cannot accept such deception. 

 In  the  choice  of  "and  those  who  believe  (wa  alladhîna  âmanu)"  rather  than  'the 

believers,' that is, in the choice of the relative clause and the attribute of belief, is a sign 

that the dissemblers try to ingratiate themselves with the believers through the attribute 

of belief, exciting that vein of the believers in order to win their love so that they can 

insinuate themselves among them. It suggests too that since the minds of the community 

of believers are illuminated with belief, the dissemblers' deceptions are not hidden from 

them, which leads to those deceptions being fruitless. 

  

 

98 

The second phrase; that is, "but they deceive only themselves (wa mâ yakhda'ûna 

illâ anfusahum):" in the restriction expressed by "only" is a sign of their total foolishness, 

since their act rebounds on them. Like a person 

 

#99 

deceived. 

who  throws  a  stone  at  a  wall  and  it  bounces  back  and  cracks  his  skull.  For  they  let  fly 

arrows at the believers but hit themselves, as though it were only themselves they had 

 And  the  replacement  of  'they  harm'  (yadarrûna)  by  "they  deceive  (yakhda'ûna)" 

implies  their  utter  foolishness,  for  among  reasonable  people  one  may  be  found  who 

intentionally  harms  himself,  but  none  that  deliberately  deceives  himself,  unless  he  is  a 

complete donkey. 

 And  in  the  word  "themselves  (anfusahum)"  is  a  concealed  sign  that  since  their 

dissembling and artifice are to gratify their instinctual souls and for selfish reasons, they 

result in the reverse of what is being sought. 

 

  

 -If  you  were  to  ask:  The  restriction  [to  the  dissemblers]  here  implies  that  their 

deceptions cause no harm to Islam and the Muslims, but Islam has been harmed by nothing 

to the extent it has been harmed by the various sorts of dissembling and their offshoots, 

which have spread like poison among the peoples of the Islamic world? 

 You would be told: The aggressive harm you see and that contagious poison have 

spread like an infectious disease from their prurient characters, corrupted natures, and 

putrid consciences; it is not the result of the deceptions and tricks they have perpetrated 

through their wills. For they want to deceive Allâh and the Prophet and the community of 

believers,  but  Allâh  has  knowledge  of  all  things  and  the  Prophet  is  the  recipient  of 

revelation, and it is not possible for the deception to be hidden from the community of 

believers for any length of time, and they are not deceived. So it is established that it is 

only themselves that they deceive. 

The  third  phrase:    "and  realize  it  not  (wa  mâ  yash'urûn);"  that  is,  they  do  not 

perceive or are not sensible of: this succinct phrase ascribes ignorance to them, for it gives 

to understand that if they are intelligent beings, this is not characteristic of intelligence, 

and if they are animals and act on the impulses of the instinctual soul, they should sense 

and  be  aware  of  this  palpable  harm.  Hence  it  is  established  that  they  have  come  to 

resemble inanimate beings, devoid of will. 

 

99 

 The fourth phrase: "In their hearts is a disease (fi qulûbihim maradun);" this phrase 

being positioned here states that since they do not act as required by the reasoning of the 

intellect and awareness of the senses, it is clear that they are suffering from a sickness of 

the spirit. For at least they should know it is a sickness and avoid its attendant problems 

and not judge according to them. For such sickness alters the truth, distorts beauty, and 

shows what is bitter to be sweet, as has been described. 

 

#100 

 The preposition "In (fi)" hints that their envy and hatred are sicknesses afflicting the 

inward dimensions of their hearts, the heart being a subtle dominical faculty, as discussed. 

 And in the term 'heart' (qalb) is an indication that just as a disease of the physical 

heart disturbs the functioning of all the body, so when what the heart signifies is sick with 

deception and dissembling, all the functions of the spirit are deflected from the straight 

path, for the heart in this sense is the source of life and its machine. 

 And  "In  their  hearts  (fi  qulûbihim)"  preceding  "is  a  disease  (maradun)"  bears  the 

meaning of restriction in two respects: by way of allusion it indicates that belief is a light 

which gives health and right direction to all man's actions and works. Secondly, it infers 

that their corruption is fundamental so it is of no avail to repair minor matters. 

 The word "disease (maradun)" allusively confutes their excuses and rams them down 

their throats. For man's innate disposition inclines naturally to the truth; corruption and 

destruction are sicknesses and accidental ('ârid). 

 And in the use of the indefinite is a sign that the disease is so deepseated that it is 

not possible to either see it or cure it. 

 

 The fifth phrase; that is, "and Allâh has increased their disease (fazâdahum Allâhu 

maradan):"  when  they  do  not  recognize  the  disease  or  avoid  it,  but  chase  after  it 

applauding it, Allâh increases it, for "whoever seeks will find." 

 In the "fa-" [of fa-zâdahum Allâhu], which expresses purpose, although the existence 

of the sickness is not a reason for its increase - is a sign that since they do not identify the 

disease, nor seek a means of curing it, indeed, take steps to aggravate it like someone who 

strikes a superior enemy with a broken hand, it seems they are seeking its increase. So 

Allâh increases it by transforming their hopes into oppressive despair, due to the triumph 

of the believers, and transforms their enmity into burning hatred in their hearts, because 

the believers prevail. So there arise from the diseases of hatred and despair, the sickness 

 

100 

of fear and ailment of weakness and illness of degradation, all of which overwhelm their 

hearts. 

 Allâh  the  Most  High  did  not  say  'Allâh  increased  their  disease'  (fa-zâda  Allâhu 

maradahum), but "Allâh has increased them in disease" and made the pronominal suffix 

the object and "disease" specificatory (tamyîz) in order to indicate that the inner sickness 

of the heart has spread to the outside, contaminating all they do. It is as if this malignant 

disease has covered 

 

#101 

all  their  bodies,  which  have  become  the  disease  itself.  The  suppurating  blisters  of  the 

illness become an additional body for them. Like the saying "ishta'ala al-baytu nâran" which 

infers that fire has enveloped the whole house and it is all ablaze; as opposed to "ishta'ala 

nâru'1-bayt," which states that a part of it has caught fire. 

 The  sixth  phrase,  that  is,  "and  theirs  is  a  grievous  penalty  (wa  la-hum  'adhâbun 

alîm):" the lâm (of "la-hum - theirs"), which denotes benefit, indicates that if they are to 

receive benefit, it would definitely be [in the form of] grievous suffering in this world or 

painful  torment  in  the  next.  Now  it  is  impossible  that  these  should  be  benefits,  so  it  is 

impossible  they  should  receive  them.  While  the  word  "torment,  penalty  (adhâb)"  being 

qualified  by  "painful,  grievous  (alîm),"  meaning  'in  pain,  suffering'  (muta'allim),  which 

usually  refers  to  people,  hints  that  the  torment  has  overwhelmed  their  bodies  and 

enveloped their persons and suffused their inner beings, so that they have become torment 

and  the  torment  has  become  identical  with  them,  like  red-hot  coals  turn  into  burning 

embers  when  consumed  by  fire.  If  one  beholds  the  torment  with  one's  imagination  and 

hears the agonized wailing and moaning on every side arising from the perpetually renewed 

life of torture, it seems as though it is the torment itself that is wailing and groaning. What 

a terrible warning for those who think! 

 

 

 The seventh phrase; that is, "because they are false [to themselves] (bimâ kânû 

yakdhibûn):" by attributing the above-mentioned penalty for their crimes to lying alone, it 

is indicating the atrociousness of lying, and its ugliness and loathsomeness. This indication 

testifies  truthfully  to  the  severe  effects  of  the  poison  of  lying,  for  lying  is  the  basis  of 

unbelief; indeed, unbelief is a falsehood and the worst sort of lying, and it is the chief sign 

of dissembling. Lying is to slander divine power and it is the opposite of dominical wisdom. 

Lying  destroys  high  morals.  It  transforms  great  enterprises  into  putrifying  corpses.  Its 

 

101 

poison has spread through the Islamic world. It has overturned the affairs of mankind, and 

held back the world of humanity from attaining its perfections, and prevented its advance 

and progress. It has cast down the likes of Musaylima the Liar to the lowest of the low. It 

is a heavy burden on man's back hindering him from achieving his aims. It is the progenitor 

of hypocrisy and artificiality. These are the reasons it has been specified by that which was 

revealed from above the Sublime Throne, and why it is execrated and made the object of 

threats.  So  you  people,  and  especially  you  Muslims!  This  verse  calls  on  you  to  note  it 

 -If you were to ask: Isn't lying excusable if for some good purpose? 

 You would be told: - If to lie is imperative and its advantages are certain. But what 

they call good reason is [generally] a false excuse. For it is stipulated by the science of the 

principles of the Shari'a that because a matter that is not determinable or quantifiable is 

open  to  exploitation,  it  cannot  be  made  the  basis  of  rulings.  For  example,  since  the 

hardship involved in performing the salât while on a journey is undeterminable, it is not 

the reason for their being shortened; the reason is the journey. And if we accept that the 

harm of a thing outweighs its benefits, a ruling is given to abrogate it and its benefit lies 

in its non-existence. The anarchy and disorder in the world testify to the overwhelming 

harm of the pretext of benefit. But hinting and allusions are not lying. The way is twofold: 

either silence, for truthfulness does not demand that one says everything that is true; or 

honesty, for truthfulness is the basis of Islam and a characteristic of belief; indeed, belief 

is truthfulness and its main sort. [Truthfulness] is the bond of all perfections; and the life 

of high morals; and the root binding things to reality; and the manifestation of truth on 

the tongue. It is the pivot of man's development, and the order of the Islamic world; and 

it is what conveys man with the speed of lightning down the road of progress to the ka'ba 

of  perfections;  and  it  raises  the  poorest  and  dullest  person  higher  than  a  sultan;  and  it 

made the Companions of the Prophet (Upon whom be blessings and peace) superior to all 

others;  and  it  raised  up  our  Master  Muhammad  alHâshimî  (Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 

peace) to the loftiest peak of humanity.

 When it is said to them: 'Do not spread corruption on the earth,' they answer: 'We 

are  but  improving  things!'  *  Oh,  verily,  it  is  they,  they  who  are  who  are  spreading 

corruption, but they perceive it not. (Wa idhâ qîla la-hum lâ tufsidû fi'l-ard qâlû innamâ 

nahnu muslihûn. * A' lâ innahum hum almufsidûna wa lâkin lâ yash'urûn.) 

Consider the positioning of these verses in regard to the preceding ones: 

 Allâh the Most High mentions the first of the crimes arising from their dissembling: 

their  wronging  themselves  and  transgressing  the  rights  of  Allâh  (huqûq  Allâh),  together 

with  the  successive  consequences  mentioned  above,  and  then  He  follows  this  with  the 

second of their crimes: their trampling the rights of Allâh's servants and their spreading 

corruption, and its results. 

 [The  phrase]  "when  it  is  said  (idhâ  qîla)"  is  linked  by  virtue  of  the  story  to  "say 

(yaqûlu)" in "Of the people there are some who say: (Wa min alnâs man yaqûlu)," (2:8) and 

by reason of its meaning to "Fain would they deceive (Yukhâdi'ûna);" (2:9) so too, by virtue 

of itself it is linked to "they are false to themselves (yakdhibûn)." (2:10) 

 The change from a categorical to a conditional clause is an indication and concealed 

sign of the clause implicit between them. It is as though it is saying: "Theirs is a grievous 

penalty for what they give the lie to; for when they lie they cause dissension, and when 

they cause dissension they cause corruption; and if they are admonished they do not accept 

it, and if they are told: don't spread corruption... and so on." 

 The positioning of the verses' phrases, both explicit and implicit: 

 It is exactly the same as the order and linkages in the example that I shall now give

 If you see someone who has taken a road leading to perdition, you first of all warn 

him, saying: "This way will be the ruin of you; don't take it!" If he does not avoid it using 

his  own  intelligence,  you  will  renew  your  efforts  to  restrain  him  by  forbidding  and 

upbraiding him, and you will reinforce this and instil it in his brain either by scaring him 

with the threat of universal condemnation, or by softening his heart by inculcating fellow-

feeling, as will be explained to you below. 

 If  the  person  is  obstinate,  persistent,  recalcitrant,  and  mounted  on  compounded 

ignorance, he will not be silent but will defend himself. For it is characteristic of corrupters 

to look on their corruption as good and useful. For by nature, man does not perpetrate 

iniquitous acts thinking they are iniquitous. He will offer evidence that his way is right, 

claiming that this is well-known and that you have no right to admonish him and that he 

has no need for your advice. Rather, you need to learn about his way. For the only smooth 

path is his and you should not attack the better way. 

 And if that obdurate person is two-faced, he will also have a forked tongue. On the 

one hand, he will try to divert the person admonishing him and silence him, and on the 

other  he  will  defend  his  way  saying:  "Outwardly  I  put  things  to  rights  as  you  wish,  and 

inwardly as I believe." Then to corroborate what he claims, he says: "Putting things to rights 

is something I've always done; it isn't that I now do good works having previously spread 

corruption." 

 And if that obdurate, Nimrod-like person persists in spreading his way and declaring 

the admonisher a lier and making insinuations against the people of truth to this extent, it 

is clear that the medicine has no effect on him. Only one remedy remains and that is to 

put him into quarantine. This treatment consists of warning people and informing them 

that  he  is  a  corrupter,  not  a  doer  of  good,  for  he  does  not  use  his  head  or  employ  his 

intelligence that he might grasp this matter which is so obvious and palpable. 

 If  you  have  understood  the  links  enumerated  in  the  above  example  [that  is,  the 

progression of the argument], you will have grasped the links between the phrases, both 

stated and alluded to, in this verse from "And when it is said to them (Wa idhâ qîla la-

hum)" to the end. For their order is so natural and succinct that the miraculousness glows 

from beneath it [like live coals]. 

 

 

 

 

 

104 

#105 

 The order and positioning of the parts of the phrases: 

 Consider this: the definiteness expressed by "when (idhâ)" in "When it is said to 

them: 'Do not spread corruption on the earth' (Wa idhâ qîla lahum lâ tufsidû fi'l-ard)" 

denotes the necessary obligation of 'forbidding what is unlawful.' 

 The passive form of "it is said (qîla)" indicates that such prohibition is encumbent 

on all (fard kifâya 'alâ al-umûm). 

 In the "la-" of "la-hum -to them" is a sign that the prohibition must be in the form of 

advice, not coercion; and through persuasion rather than by force. 

 "Do not spread corruption (lâ tufsidû)" is a summary in the form of a conditional 

syllogism;  that  is,  "do  not  do  that,  for  it  will  lead  to  anarchy.  Relations  [requiring] 

obedience will be severed, justice and its system will be thrown into disorder, the bonds 

of unity will be broken, and this will lead to corruption. So don't do that lest you cause 

corruption." 

 The phrase "on the earth (fi'l-ard)" corroborates and perpetuates the prohibition, 

for  [its  effect]  is  temporary.  The  admonition  therefore  has  to  fix  it  permanently  in  the 

brain  of  the  one  addressed  by  appointing  his  conscience  to  always  restrain  him  from 

beneath. This is either by exciting his vein of fellow-feeling, or by arousing his desire to 

flee from public disgust. "On the earth (fi'l-ard)" arouses these two veins, for the phrase 

addresses [the dissemblers] saying: "This depravity of yours spreads through mankind. Why 

do you feel such hatred and anger at all the people, some of whom are innocent, or poor, 

or unknown by you? Why don't you feel sorry for them and pity them? We can see you have 

no sympathy for your fellow men, but at least you should realize that this action of yours 

attracts their loathing." 

 

 -If you were to ask: Which of [the dissemblers'] objectives looks to the people at 

large? How can their depravity spread to everyone? 

 You would be told: Just as everything appears dark and ugly to a person who looks 

through a dark lens, so everything appears hateful and odious to the person whose sight is 

veiled by dissembling and whose heart is corrupted by unbelief. His heart is full of malice 

towards all men, indeed, all beings, and he stubbornly opposes them. Furthermore, if one 

tooth  of  a  flywheel  in  the  workings  of  a  clock  is  damaged,  the  clock  is  affected  either 

wholly or partially. Similarly, mankind's order is affected by one person's dissembling, for 

it  is  set  in  order  through  justice,  Islam,  and  obedience.  Alas!  [The  dissemblers'] 

continuously scattered poisons have accumulated and resulted in the present ignominy. 

 

105 

#106 

"They answer: 'We are but improving things!' (Qûlû innamâ nahnu muslihûn):" 

 In the substitution of "they answer (lit. say) (qâlû)" for 'they do not accept advice' 

(lâ  yaqbulûna  al-nasîha),  which  would  have  been  appropriate  in  the  context,  is  an 

indication that they are making presumptuous claims and calling others to their way. 

 "Innamâ,"  [the  restrictive  particle,  meaning  only  or  but],  possesses  two 

characteristics: 

 The  First:  The  phrase  in  which  it  is  included  has  necessarily  to  signify  something 

known, either in reality or allegedly. Thus, it infers depreciation of the one offering advice, 

as well as their [the dissemblers'] persisting in their compounded ignorance. 

 The  Second:  The  restriction  of  "but"  indicates  that  in  their  view  their  improving 

things is unadulterated by corruption. And this is an insinuation against the believers [who 

say the opposite]. 

 The  use  of  the  active  participle  in  "(lit.)  improvers  [of  things]  (muslihûn)"  rather 

than the verbal form 'we are making improvements, setting in order, etc.' indicates that 

[they allege that] this attribute of theirs is constant and continual and that what they are 

doing  is  total  betterment.  But  they  are  dissimulating  in  saying  this  also,  for  what  they 

profess inwardly is the opposite of what they profess outwardly: inwardly they claim their 

corruption to be improving things, and outwardly they hypocritically claim that what they 

do is for the betterment of the believers and in their interests. 

 "Oh,  verily,  it  is  they,  they  who  are  who  are  spreading  corruption,  but  they 

perceive it not. (A'lâ innahum hum al-mufsidûna wa lâkin lâ yash'urûn):" 

 Consider this: the previous verse inferred a number of things about the dissemblers: 

for example, their spreading their ideas, and claiming that they consistently put things to 

rights and that this is a constant attribute of theirs, and is confined to them; and that their 

bettering things is untouched by corruption; that this is clear and well-known; and their 

casting aspersions on the believers and imputing ignorance to those who offer them advice. 

Here,  the  Qur'an  replies  to  them  with  the  present  sentence,  which  comprises  elements 

proving  their  corruption  and  that  they  have  become  one  with  it;  that  corruption  is 

restricted to them, and that this is an established fact, and warning the people against 

them, and showing them to be ignorant by disallowing them any senses, as though they 

were inanimate. If you wish, consider the following: 

 

 

 

 

106 

"they say (qâlû)." 

#107 

them. 

 The [intensifying interjection] "Oh, verily! (a'-lâ)" is for alerting or warning: see how 

with its warning it declares false all their propaganda, which is alluded to by the word(s) 

 The [corroborative particle] "innâ," which is for verification: see how it refutes their 

well-known claims, indicated by "innamâ." It is as though the "innâ" is saying that in reality 

their  inner  state  is  one  of  corruption,  so  their  outwardly  being  righteous  will  not  profit 

 The  restrictive  meaning  of  the  personal  pronoun  "they  (hum)"  counters  the 

insinuations implicit in "nahnu" and "innamâ:" "We are but improving things." 

 The  definite  article  in  "(lit.)  the  spreaders  of  corruption  (al-mufsidîn,"  which 

signifies  that  you  see  in  them  the  quintessence  of  those  who  cause  corruption  and  that 

they  are  in  essence  depravity  -  see  how  this  contradicts  the  restriction  expressed  by 

"innamâ." 

 And  "but  they  perceive  it  not  (wa  lâkin  lâ  yash'urûn),"  how  it  contradicts  their 

declaring  false  the  one  admonishing  them  and  their  claim  that  they  are  not  in  need  of 

advice, since their assertions [about what they are] are known.

 And when they are told. 'Believe as other people believe,' they answer, 'Shall we 

believe as the weak-minded believe?' Oh, verily, it is they, they who are weak-minded, 

but they know it not! (Wa idhâ qîla la-hum âminû ka-mâ amana al-nâs qâlû a' nu'minu ka-

mâ âmana al-sufahâ' a' lâ innahum hum al-sufahâ' wa lâkin lâ ya'lamûn) 

 The positioning of this verse and its relationship with the previous one: 

 Consider  this:  in  so  far  as  these  two  verses  (2:11,  2:13)  consist  of  advice  and 

guidance; the enjoining of what is lawful, adornment (al-tahlîyya), and encouragement [in 

the  present  verse]  are  linked  to  the  prohibiting  of  what  is  unlawful,  purification  (al-

takhlîyya), and intimidation in the previous one. And in so far as they both describe [the 

dissemblers'] crimes, their decrying the believers and pride [in the present verse] are linked 

to their mischief-making (ifsâd) in the previous one. Just as their mischief-making is tied 

to  their  depravity  (fasâd),  every  sort  of  which  is  a  branch  of  the  Zaqqum-tree  of 

dissembling. 

 The relationships between the verse's phrases: 

 Consider this: with the sentence "And when they are told, 'Believe as other people 

believe' (Wa idhâ qîla la-hum âminû ka-mâ âmana al-nâs)," [the verse] first suggests with 

its parts the obligation of calling to sincere belief in emulation of the mass of the people, 

who are genuine [believers], for indeed the conscience perpetually urges them to do this. 

It then quotes [the dissemblers' retort]: "they answer, 'Shall we believe as the weakminded 

believe?' (qâlû a' nu'minu ka-mâ amana al-sufaha)," indicating their [pique,] obduracy and 

pride, and their insistence on their rightness. Yes, all liars look on the false as true and 

think their ignorance is knowledge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

108 

#109 

For [the dissemblers'] hearts have been corrupted by dissembling, and pride and the 

tendency to corrupt spring from depravity, and because of this they have grown obdurate. 

By way of mischief-making, they secretly confabulate and plan to lead others astray. And 

in  their  pride,  they  consider  fervent  religiosity  and  perfect  belief,  the  cause  of 

independence and contentment, to be ignominy, foolishness, and indigence. 

 Moreover,  because  of  their  duplicity,  they  dissemble  when  saying  this,  also.  For 

outwardly they say: "How should we be like the weak-minded, for we aren't mad? We are 

as  superior  as  you  could  wish."  While  inwardly  they  say:  "How  could  we  be  like  the 

believers,  for  most  of  them  are  paupers?  In  our  eyes  they  are  the  dim-witted  rabble  of 

different nations." 

 You can now supply the fine points to the two parts of this conditional sentence. 

 The Qur'an then hurls back at them the stone they flung at the believers, ramming 

it down their throats: "Oh, verily, it is they, they who are weakminded (a Iâ innahum hum 

al-sufahâ')."  For  whoever  is  obstinate  to  this  degree  and  ignorant  without  realizing  it, 

deserves to be paraded among the people and proclaimed the feeble-minded one, for this 

is  an  established  fact,  and  their  calling  the  believers  weak-minded  is  due  to  their  own 

feeblemindedness. 

 Then by saying: "but they know it not (wa lâkin lâ ya'lamûn)," it is pointing out that 

their ignorance is compounded because they are unaware of it. It is therefore useless to 

offer them advice; they should be shunned entirely. For it is only those who realize that 

they are ignorant that may benefit from advice. 

 The positioning of [and relationships between] the phrases' parts: 

 "And when they are told, 'Believe as other people believe;' (Wa idhâ qîla la-hum 

âminû ka-mâ âmana al-nâs):" 

 In  this  phrase,  the  certainty  expressed  by  the  word  "when  (idhâ)"  indicates  the 

necessity of offering guidance [to the people] by 'enjoining what is lawful.' 

 "[Being]  told  (qîla):"  the  passive  mood  infers  that  offering  advice  is  an  obligation 

[that may be performed by a number of people in the name of the community ('alâ sabîl 

al-kifâya)], as has been mentioned. 

 The use of the verb "believe (âminu)" rather than 'be sincere in your belief (akhlisû 

fi imânikum) indicates that insincere belief is not belief. 

 The phrase "as [others] believe (ka-mâ âmana)" is an allusion to the fine 

 

 

 

109 

#110 

as to commit." 

examples of admirable men, suggesting that sincerity may be attained by following them. 

 The word "the people (al-nâs)" contains two points, which induce the conscience to 

always  enjoin  the  good.  For  "as  other  people  believe  (ka-mâ  âmana  an-nâs)"  intimates: 

"Follow the mass of the people, for to oppose them is an error that the heart is not so bold 

 Secondly, it infers that those who do not believe should not be counted as true men; 

only believers are true human beings, as though the others are human only in form. For 

the believers have advanced in perfections and true humanity is particular to them, and 

the rest have fallen from the level of humanity. 

  

The  phrase:  "they  say:  shall  we  believe  as  the  weak-minded  believe?  (qâlû  a' 

nu'minu ka-mâ âmana al-sufahâ')" has this meaning: "We don't accept advice. How could 

we be like those lowly wretches? How can we people of standing be put on a par with them? 

We look on them as dimwits?" 

 Thus, the word "they say (qâlû)" hints at their self-justification, their spreading their 

views, their disdain for advice, and their arrogance and presumption. 

 The  rhetorical  question  "shall  we  believe  (a'  nu'minu)"  indicates  their  obstinately 

sticking to their ignorant views. As though, using the interrogative form, they are saying 

to the one advising them: "Consult your conscience! Can you in all fairness accept that we 

reject [religion]?" 

 Moreover, "they say (qâlû)" contains three consecutive aspects; that is: first of all 

they address themselves, then their fellows, then the one offering them guidance, for it is 

usual when offered advice for a person first of all consult himself, then his fellows, then 

to refer back to you with the results of his reasoning. Hence, when they are told what was 

said, they examine their corrupted hearts and rotten consciences and are shown the way 

of denial. What they say is an interpretation of what is in their hearts. Then with a view 

to making mischief they refer to their brothers, and are again shown the way of denial, 

and  they  begin  holding  secret  confabulations.  Then  by  way  of  making  excuses  and  to 

mislead  they  turn  back  to  the  one  giving  them  advice  and  say  provocatively:  "The 

difference between us is so great we can't be compared with them. They are poor and have 

to be strong in religion and Sufism; they simply have to be like that. But we are people of 

high rank and standing." In their arrogance they call on the one offering them advice to be 

fair, and as a ruse and stratagem say deceitfully: "Don't 

 

 

110 

#111 

suppose us to be feeble-minded; you shouldn't imagine we're people like that! No, we act 

as sincere believers act." However, inwardly they say: "We aren't like those impoverished, 

worthless believers," which is an oblique hint at their depravity and spreading of corruption 

and their arrogance and duplicity. 

 "As the weak-minded believe (ka-mâ âmana al-sufahâ');" that is, "You suppose the 

believers  to  be  the  people  of  perfection,  but  in  our  view  they  are  contemptible 

mendicants.  They're  forced  to  turn  to  religion.  They're  worthless  for  all  their  numbers. 

They're the riff-raff of other nations." 

 Their claiming that there can be no comparison between them indicates that Islam 

is the refuge of the downtrodden, the recourse of the poor, the defender of truth, and the 

preserver of right, the preventer of arrogance, and the restrainer of pride; it is the only 

measure of perfection and distinction. 

 The dissemblers' claim to be different also points to the cause of dissembling, which 

for the most part is self-interest, pride, and arrogance, as is explained by the verse, "We 

see [in] you nothing but a man like ourselves; nor do we see that any follow you but the 

most abject among us, in judgement immature." (12:27) 

 It is also a concealed sign that Islam cannot be made an instrument of domination 

and  oppression  in  the  hands  of  the  worldly  and  high-ranking;  it  is  rather  a  means  of 

upholding right at the disposal of the poor and needy, contrarily to other religions. History 

testifies to this. 

 

 "Oh, verily, it is they, they who are weak-minded (a lâ innahum hum al-sufahâ'):" 

 Consider this: the sole reason for the Qur'an's vigorous assaults on dissembling and 

its condemnation of it is that its various kinds have been the cause of most of the calamities 

visited on the Islamic world. 

 The interjection "a' lâ - Oh, verily" is to attract attention and publicize their folly 

and call on public opinion to testify to it. The real meaning of "a' lâ" is "Don't you know that 

they're weak-minded? That is, you ought to know!" 

 The corroborative particle "inna" acts as a mirror to the truth and is a means to it, 

as though it were saying: "Refer to the truth and understand that their outward sophistries 

are baseless." 

 The pronoun "they (hum)" infers restriction [to themselves] and [its purpose] is to 

reject  their  self-justification  and  repulse  their  imputation  of  feeble-mindedness  to  the 

 

111 

believers, indicated by "as the weak-minded believe (ka-mâ âmana al-sufahâ')." That is, 

the weak-minded are those people who 

 

#112 

give up [working for] the hereafter at the behest of their pride and selfinterest and fleeting 

pleasures, unlike those who earn eternal life by giving up their ephemeral desires. 

 The  definite  article  "al"  of  "al-sufahâ'  -  [the]  weak-minded"  indicates  that  it  is  a 

known  fact  that  they  are  weak-minded.  It  also  denotes  completeness;  that  is,  theirs  is 

complete weak-mindedness. 

"But they know it not (wa lâkin lâ ya'lamûn):" 

 This contains three indications: 

 The  First:  Knowledge  and  insight  are  necessary  to  distinguish  between  truth  and 

falsehood and differentiate between the way of the believers and that of the dissemblers, 

unlike  [the  dissemblers']  corruption  and  dissension,  which  can  be  perceived  by  those  of 

least intelligence. For this reason, [as this verse is concluded with the phrase, "but they 

know it not"], the previous verse has appended to it the phrase, "but they perceive it not." 

The Second: "They do not know," like similar phrases at the ends of verses such as 

"they do not use their reasons (lâ ya'qilun)," "they do not reflect (lâ yatafakkarûn)," and 

"they do not recall (lâ yatadhakkarûn)" show that Islam is founded on reason, wisdom, and 

knowledge.  It  is  characterized  by  being  acceptable  by  all  sound  minds,  unlike  other 

religions, which are based on blind imitation and bigotry. This indication presages well [for 

Islam], as is discussed elsewhere. {[*]: This refers to al-Khutba al-Shâmiyya (Turk. Hutbe-i 

şamiye)  (1911).  For  English  translation,  see,  The  Damascus  Sermon  (Istanbul:  Sözler 

Publications, 1996), 27-43.} 

The Third: One should avoid [the dissemblers] and not concern oneself with them, 

for there is nothing to be gained from offering them advice; they are not aware of their 

ignorance that they might try to dispel it and be quit of it.

 When they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe;" but when they are alone 

with their evil ones, they say: "We are really with you; we [were] only jesting. * Allâh will

bi-him wa yamudduhum fi tughânihim ya'mahûn.) 

 The relationship of these verses' meaning with that of the previous one: 

 This consists of the linking [by means of the conjunction "and"] of the dissemblers' 

fourth crime; that is, their mockery and scorn, with their previous crimes; that is, their 

accusing  the  believers  of  weak-mindedness,  their  spreading  corruption,  and  their 

The  positioning  of  the  phrases  constituting  these  verses  [and  the  relationships 

 Belief, as a prop and support in the face of suffering and a source of assistance for 

realizing one's hopes, possesses three essential properties: 

 The First: Self-respect, which arises from having such a support, and the mark of 

which is not to lower oneself by being abject and servile. 

 The  Second:  Compassion,  the  mark  of  which  is  not  to  abase  others  or  be 

contemptuous of them. 

 The Third: Respect for the truth and knowledge of its worth. For the person who 

possesses something of high value possesses the truth; he owns a unique jewel and will not 

be scornful of the truth. For he is also dignified.

contempt of others. 

 Similarly, the opposite of belief, that is, dissembling, has three characteristics, the 

reverse of those of belief: obsequiousness, the desire to corrupt, and arrogance leading to 

 If  you  have  recognized  these,  then  know  that  dissembling  causes  a  person  to  be 

obsequious, which results in his abasement; in this he is hypocritical, which means he is 

sycophantic, which is lying. This is indicated by "When they meet those who believe, they 

say: 'We believe' (Wa idhâ laq û alladhîna âmanû qâlû âmannâ)." 

 Moreover, dissembling corrupts the heart, and this makes the spirit feel orphanlike; 

that is, its being without owner, protector, or lord; and this gives rise to fear, which makes 

such  people  resort  to  hiding  themselves  away.  This  is  indicated  by  "but  when  they  are 

alone (wa idhâ khalaw)." 

 Also,  dissembling  causes  a  person  to  sever  relations  with  his  relatives,  and  this 

extinguishes his compassion, and its extinction leads the person to mischief-making, which 

leads to dissension, and this to treachery, and this to weakness, which compels him to seek 

a  supporter  and  helper.  And  this  is  indicated  by  the  phrase  "with  their  evil  ones  (ilâ 

shayâtînihim)." 

 Then,  because  dissembling  is  wavering  ignorance,  it  causes  [the  dissemblers]  to 

vacillate, which leads to their instability, and then to their having no outlook, and then to 

their not being trusted, and this compels them to continually renew their agreements. This 

sequence of events is indicated by "they say: we are really with you (qâlû innâ ma'kum)." 

 Then,  feeling  the  need  to  make  excuses,  out  of  their  fickleness  they  attach  no 

importance  to  the  truth.  Because  of  their  own  worthlessness,  they  depreciate  its  high 

value. Due to their own abasement, they disdain elevated things. And in their weakness, 

they are carried away by pride. The Qur'an alludes to this with the words: "we were only 

jesting (innamâ nahnu mustahzi'ûn)." 

 While  expecting  from  this  line  of  reasoning  that  the  believers  will  reply  to  [the 

dissemblers], the listener sees that Allâh the Most High replies to them in their stead. This 

indicates  Allâh's  honouring  the  believers  and  implies  that  their  mocking  the  believers  is 

nothing  compared  with  Allâh  the  Most  High's  punishment  of  them.  It  indicates  too  their 

stupidity and that they deserve to be rejected and turned away. For how can the person 

who has Allâh as his protector be mocked? So the Most High says: "Allâh will throw back 

their mockery on them (Allâh yastahziyyu' bi-him)." That is, He will punish them severely 

for their mockery by causing them to be continously derided and scorned in this world and 

the next. 

 

114 

#115 

 And the phrase "and give them rope in their trespasses; so they will wander like 

blind  ones  [to  and  fro]  (wa  yamudduhum  fi  tughânihim  ya'mahûn)"  specifies  what  form 

[Allâh's] mocking [will take], the punishment for their mockery. 

 The positioning of the parts of the phrases [and the relationships between them]: 

 Consider  this:  the  phrase  "When  they  meet  those  who  believe,  they  say:  'We 

believe.' Wa idhâ laqû alladhîna âmanû qâlû âmannâ)" denotes their sycophancy. 

 The  certainty  expressed  by  "when  (idhâ)"  infers  definiteness,  deliberateness,  and 

intention. That is, they deliberately intended to meet the believers. 

 The verb "they meet (laqû)" indicates that they intended to encounter the believers 

on thoroughfares in the midst of the people. 

 The  use  of  the  phrase  "those  who  believe  (alladhîna  âmanû)"  in  place  of  'the 

believers' (al-mu'minîn) indicates that [the dissemblers] have direct contact with them and 

that they are in touch with each other, and that the reason for their relations is belief, 

and that belief is the most outstanding of the believers' attributes. 

 The word "they say (qâlû)" hints that they say with their mouths what is not in their 

hearts, and that what they say demonstrates their artificiality, hypocrisy, and sycophancy, 

and that they say it to rebuff accusations and avidly attract [to themselves] the believers' 

advantages and so that they might pry into their secrets. 

 The word "we believe (âmannâ)" not being in the intensive [or corroborative - bilâ 

ta'kîd)  form  although  the  sense  requires  it,  and  its  being  a  verbal  clause,  indicate  that 

there is no passion or incentive in their hearts driving them to be steadfast in what they 

say. The non-use of the intensive also indicates their strenuous rebuttals of the accusations 

against them, as though they are saying: "Your denying [our belief] is uncalled for, in fact 

it's futile, for we're not the sort of people who can be accused." It is also a sign that such 

vehemence will not give currency to what they say. It also hints that the veil covering their 

lies and dissembling is so flimsy, if force were applied to it, it would be torn apart. Also, 

in its being a verbal clause is a sign that they cannot claim to be constant and persistent 

[in their belief]; their aim in dissimulating while claiming that they have recently come to 

believe is to share in the believers' benefits and to discover their secrets.

#116 

 "But when they are alone with their evil ones, they say: 'We are really with you' 

(Wa idhâ khalaw ilâ shayâtinihim qâlû innâ ma'kum)" 

 The comprehensive "wâw - and" in "but (lit. and) when (wa idhâ)" denotes that these 

words are so placed to make it clear that the dissemblers adhere to no particular way, and 

to  describe  their  vacillation,  [as  set  forth]  in  detail  in  the  two  conditional  clauses  [this 

phrase and the last one]. 

evil ones]. 

 The definiteness expressed by "when (idhâ)" indicates that driven by their depravity 

and spreading of corruption, they deem it their bounden duty to have recourse [to their 

 The  verb  "they  are  alone  (khalaw)"  infers  that  because  of  their  perfidy  they  are 

scared, and because of their fear they conceal themselves. 

 The use of "ilâ (lit. to)" instead of ma' (with), which is [properly] used with the verb 

khalaw, indicates that because of their weakness and impotence they [have to] seek refuge 

[with others], and because of their corruption and intrigues, they hand over the believers' 

secrets to the unbelievers. 

 The term "evil ones (al-shayâtîn)" indicates that their chiefs are like satans, hidden 

and making diabolical suggestions, and that they cause harm like satans, and that they are 

on a satanic path, and can conceive of nothing but evil. 

 The phrase "they say: we are really with you (qâlû innâ ma'kum)" is to express their 

meeting their obligations and renewing their agreements, and their constancy in their way. 

For here, it is confirmative although no denial is made, while in the previous phrase it is 

not  confirmative  although  there  is  denial,  which  is  evidence  for  the  lack  of  compelling 

eagerness in the speaker's heart in the previous phrase, and its being found in this one. 

Moreover, the fact that this phrase is a nominal clause and the previous one is a verbal 

clause, indicates that the purpose here is to demonstrate their constancy in dissembling 

and their inconstancy in belief. 

  

"We were only jesting (innamâ nahu mustahzi'ûn)" 

 This phrase is not joined to the preceding one with a conjunction, for conjunctions 

are not used to join sentences that are either so similar as to be one with each other or 

are totally unconnected, but only [with sentences that] are between the two. This phrase 

in  one  respect  is  a  substitute  (badal)  for  the  previous  one,  and  in  another  respect 

corroborates it; the two are therefore closely interlinked. Then in another way it is the 

answer  to  an  implicit  question  and  so  is  totally  unconnected.  For  usually,  replies  are 

 

116 

declarative (ikhbâriyya) sentences or clauses, and questions express wishes, requests, or 

conditions (inshâ'iyya). 

 

#117 

 With regard to this clause corroborating the previous one, and its being a substitute 

for it, which is closer to it, it signifies contempt for the truth and the people of truth, so 

exalts falsehood and its followers; this is the meaning of: "We are really with you." 

 And with regard to its being the answer to an implied question, it is as though their 

satans are saying to them: "If you are with us and on our way, why are you in agreement 

with  the  believers?  Either  you  subscribe  to  their  beliefs,  or  you  have  no  belief." 

Apologetically they reply: "We were only jesting," thus stating explicitly that they are not 

in any way Muslims. By using the restrictive "only (innamâ)," they also infer that they are 

not hesitant or without beliefs or convictions, and by using the active participle "mocking, 

jesting (mustahzi'ûn)," they hint that to mock is one of their permanent characteristics. 

Thus, they are not serious in this action of theirs, [their belief). 

  

"Allâh will throw back their mockery on them (Allâh yastahziyyû bi-him)" 

 This clause is not joined to those preceding it; indeed, it is disjoined and separate 

from them. For if it had been attached by a conjunction to "we [were] only jesting (innamâ 

nahnu mustahzi'ûn)," it would also have had to corroborate "we are really with you (innâ 

ma'kum)." And if it had been attached to "they say (qâlû)," it would also have had to have 

been confined to when they were alone, whereas Allâh mocks them continually. And if it 

had been attached to "when they are alone (idhâ khalaw)" it would have had to have been 

the complement of their vacillation. And if it had been attached to "when they meet (idhâ 

laqû)," both clauses would have had to have been intending the same thing. Whereas the 

first describes what they have done, and the second, their punishment. Thus, since all the 

possibilities demanding a conjunction are invalid, it would not be correct for this clause to 

be attached to those preceding it. So it can only be unconnected to the previous phrase 

(musta'nifa),  and  in  reply  to  an  implied  question.  This  hints  and  implies  that  their 

wickedness and loathsomeness have reached such a degree that they induce the spirits of 

all those aware of them to ask: "How will people who behave like that be punished?" 

 The clause's beginning with the word "Allâh," although the listener expects to see 

the  believers  facing  up  to  them,  indicates  that  He  is  honouring  the  believers  and  being 

beneficent  to  them,  for  He  confronts  the  dissemblers  in  their  stead.  It  is  also  a  hint 

 

117 

restraining  the  dissemblers,  for  those  supported  by  the  One  All-Knowing  of  the  Unseen 

cannot be mocked. Also, the fact that this clause is detached and unconcerned with their 

 

#118 

mockery indicates that their mockery is nothing compared with its punishment. Moreover, 

the  use  of  the  term  "mocking"  to  describe  Allâh  the  Most  High's  chastisement  of  them, 

which  is  unfitting  for  His  exaltedness,  is  to  give  the  idea  of  the  similarity  between  the 

holders of a conversation, and to indicate that the chastisement is the punishment for their 

mockery  and  its  inevitable  result,  although  its  purpose  is  to  humiliate  and  scorn  them. 

Furthermore, it hints that their mockery of the believers does not profit them, indeed, it 

harms them, as though Allâh the Most High is mocking them [for it]. Like someone who 

thinks he is making fun of you, but you look on him as crazy and want him to talk to you 

even if he abuses you, for his making fun of you is part of your making a fool of him. 

 Here, the derisory "mocks (yastahziyyu')" is a verb in the imperfect tense, although 

in the previous verse "mustahzi'ûn" it is an active participle, which indicates that Allâh the 

Most High's chastisement and His debasing them are continually renewed so that they suffer 

the  pain  and  are  affected  by  it.  For  the  effects  of  something  continuous  and  regular 

diminish, or disappear altogether. This is the reason it is said that variation is necessary to 

make things felt. 

  

"And give them rope in their trespasses so they will wander like blind ones [to 

and fro] (wa yamudduhum fı' tughyânihim ya'mahûn)" 

 That is, they make use of the means of misguidance and seek it, so Allâh the Most 

High  gives  it  to  them.  Thus,  the  word  "(lit.)  grant  them  a  respite,  give  them  rope 

(yamuddu)"  implies  rebuttal  of  the  Mu'tazilites,  [who  asserted  man  creates  his  own 

actions], and since it includes the meaning of 'seeking help' (istimdâd) it infers rejection 

of  the  Jabriyya;  that  is,  misusing  their  wills  the  dissemblers  chose  this  path  and  sought 

help to follow it, so Allâh the Most High helped them, and loosed their halters. 

 The addition of the pronominal suffix "their (-hum)" to "trespasses (lit. rebellion) 

(tughyân)," that is, they chose it voluntarily, signifies that they were not coerced so that 

they  might  be  excused.  While  "tughyân"  [which  has  the  meaning  of  overflowing  and 

exceeding all bounds] indicates that their harm has inundated everything good like a flood, 

destroying the foundations of perfection, and that nothing remains but black scum. 

 "So  they  will  wander  like  blind  ones  [to  and  fro]  (ya'mahûn):"  that  is,  they  are 

bewildered and hesitant. This indicates that they have no beliefs and no fixed goal.

 These are the people who have purchased error at the price of guidance, but their 

trade is profitless, and they are not rightlyguided. (Ûla ika alladhîna ishtaraw al-dalâlata 

bi'l-hudâ fama rabihat tijâratuhum wa mâ kânû muhtadîn) 

 The verse's positioning with regard to what precedes it: 

 Consider  this:  this  verse  is  a  summary  of  the  preceding  detailed  descriptions, 

illustrating them in elevated and effective fashion. Commerce is chosen as the parable's 

[subject]  because  the  first  people  it  was  addressing  had  experienced  the  pleasures  and 

hardships of trade on their journeys of winter and summer. 

 The verse's pertinence is this: 

 human beings were not sent to this world to make it their homeland, but to trade 

using the capital of their innate faculties and powers; to cultivate them and then dispose 

freely of their produce. 

 The positioning of the verse's phrases: 

 This is a fluent, natural arrangement, reflecting the ordering of the parable. It is 

like this: there was a cheated failed merchant. He had been given rich capital but he had 

used  it  only  to  buy  poison  and  things  harmful  to  himself.  He  worked  his  capital,  but  it 

brought him no profit and was of no avail to him; indeed, it plunged him into ever greater 

loss. Finally he lost all of it, and then strayed from the path until there was no return. 

 The positioning of the parts of the phrases: 

 The  demonstrative  pronoun  "  These  (Ûla'ika)"  brings  close  what  is  tangible  and 

distant.  This  suggests  that  on  hearing  the  crimes  enumerated  in  the  above  verses,  the 

listener  feels  in  his  heart  a  gradually  increasing  anger  and  disgust,  so  wants  to  see  the 

dissemblers in order to vent his anger and confront them with his loathing and contempt. 

The palpability hints that their 

 

#120 

 

being qualified by these extraordinary attributes embodies them in the [listener's] mind, 

making  them  [almost]  tangible  to  [his]  imagination.  It  also  indicates  the  reason  for  the 

statement,  since  sin  leads  to  further  sin.  [For  certainly  a  reason  is  necessary  if  one 

exchanges  misguidance  for  guidance,  and  this  is  their  above-mentioned  crimes  and 

119 

attributes. Thus, the Qur'an alludes to them with "These (Ûla'ika)," that is, those qualified 

by those attributes, so that the listener will know the reason for the condemnation of them 

in this verse.] {[*]: Nursi, İsârâtu l-İ'caz [Abdûlmecid], 121-2.} 

 As  for  the  distance  signified  by  "These  (Ûla'ika),"  it  indicates  their  great  distance 

from the right path; they have reached the point of no return; they departed of their own 

accord, but they cannot return. 

 The  relative  pronoun  "who  (alladhîna)"  indicates  that  this  sort  of  commerce  is 

strange and injurious. Only recently had it appeared and become a principle and course of 

action  adopted  by  people.  For  as  mentioned  above,  the  relative  pronoun  indicates  new 

facts that are just being established. 

 The verb "have purchased (ishtaraw)" alludes to the rejection of their excuse [when 

they say] "it is in our natures to do this." It is as though the Qur'an is saying to them: "No! 

Allâh has given you your lifespan as capital, and deposited in your spirits the potentiality 

to mature and be perfected, and planted in your consciences the seeds of truth, which 

constitute innate guidance, so that you might buy happiness. But rather than buying it, 

indeed  renouncing  it,  you  procured  immediate  pleasures  and  worldly  benefits,  and 

misusing your wills you chose the way of misguidance rather than the path of guidance, 

and you spoiled that innate guidance and lost your capital. 

 The phrase "error [at the price of ] guidance (al-dalâlata bi'1-hudâ)" hints that they 

incur loss upon loss, for just as they lose by acquiring misguidance, so they lose through 

giving up the supreme bounty of guidance. 

 "But their trade is profitless (fa-mâ rabihat tijâratuhum):" the use of the negative 

-  for  not  only  have  they  incurred  a  loss  but  have  lost  all  their  capital -  suggests  that  it 

would have been intelligent not to attempt unprofitable trade, and particularly trade that 

causes loss and even the loss of one's capital. 

 Also, by ascribing the verb to their commerce - although rightly it should have been 

ascribed to themselves; that is 'but they gained no profit in their trade' (fa-mâ rabihû fi 

tijâratihim) - is a sign that in no respect, in 

#121 

 

 

none  of  its  particulars  or  conditions  or  means,  does  their  commerce  yield  any  benefit, 

unlike in some businesses where no profit is made on the products but some benefits may 

accrue  in  other  particulars  or  their  services.  The  dissemblers'  trade  is  pure  evil  and 

undiluted harm. Ascribing the verb to the trade here resembles the saying: "Nâma layluhu 

(his night slept)" instead of "nâma fi'l-layl (he slept in the night)." The former means that 

120 

besides himself sleeping, the night was hushed and silent as though sleeping, and nothing 

disturbed him. 

 "And they are not rightly-guided (wa mâ kânû muhtadîn):" that is, just as they have 

lost their capital, so have have they lost their way. This is linked and associated with the 

parabolic "ishtaraw (have purchased)," as was the preceding phrase. It also hints obliquely 

at "guidance for those who fear Allâh (hudan li'l-muttaqîm)" at the start of the sura. As 

though it is saying: "The Qur'an offered them guidance, but they did not accept it."

 Their parable is that of people who kindle a fire: but as soon as it has illumined all 

around  them,  Allâh  takes  away  their  light  and  leaves  them  in  utter  darkness,  wherein 

they cannot see: * Deaf, dumb, blind - and they cannot turn back. * Or [the parable] of a 

violent cloudburst in the sky, with utter darkness, thunder and lightning: they put their 

fingers  into  their  ears  to  keep  out  the  peals  of  thunder,  in  terror  of  death;  but  Allâh 

encompasses [with His might] all who deny the truth. * The lightning well-nigh takes away 

their sight; whenever it gives them light, they advance therein, and whenever darkness 

falls around them, they stand still. And if Allâh so willed, He could indeed take away their 

hearing  and  sight:  for  verily  Allâh  is  powerful  over  all  things.  (Mathaluhum  kamathal

Consider this: the Qur'an's miraculousness is founded on the eloquence of its word-

order (nazm), and the eloquence of its word-order is of two sorts: the first is like decoration 

and the second like a garment. 

The First Sort resembles strung pearls, finely worked decoration, and embroidery 

studded with gems. It is derived from following the grammatical and verbal meanings of a 

speech, like molten gold running among lumps of silver. The exposition of the subtle points 

that are the fruits of this sort of eloquence has been undertaken by fann ['ilm] al-ma'âni. 

The Second Sort is like a costly gown or robe of honour, cut out according to the 

stature  of  the  meanings,  sewn  from  different  pieces  with  regular  stitches,  and  clothed 

altogether On the meaning, or the story, or the aim. This sort's craftsman and master is 

fann ['ilm] al-bayân. 

 One  of  the  most  important  questions  of  this  [latter]  sort  is  that  of  allegorical 

comparisons  (tamthîl).  The  Qur'an  contains  as  many  as  a  thousand,  for  allegorical 

comparisons contain a subtle mystery and are elevated wisdom. Yes, through them delusion 

is overcome by reason, imagination is compelled to submit to thought, the hidden is made 

present, the abstract made tangible, and the meaning made palpable, the disparate are 

brought together, the various are blended, the diverse united, the sundered connected, 

and the defenceless armed. If you want to hear a detailed discussion, then listen along 

with me to what the author of Dalâ'il al-I'jâz chants in Asrâr al-Balâgha, {[*]: 'Abd al-Qâhir 

al-Jurjânî (d. 471/1078). He was a luminary in the fields of language and rhetoric. For this 

passage,  see,  Ahmad  Mustafâ  al-Marâghî  (ed.),  (Cairo:  Matba'  al-Istiqama,  1948),  128.} 

when he says: 

 

122 

 

 

 

#124 

On the Appropriate and Effective Use of Allegorical Comparisons 

 The  intelligent  ('uqalâ')  agree  that  when  allegorical  comparisons  come  after  the 

meanings, or when the meanings emerge on being summarized by comparisons, and are 

transposed from their original forms to that of the comparisons, the comparison clothes 

them in splendour, makes them glorious, 

raises  their  value,  kindles  their  fire,  augments  their  power  by  rousing  souls,  summons 

hearts  towards  them,  stirs  up  breasts  with  fervent  longing  and  love,  and  subjugates 

dispositions through ardent passion and zeal. 

 For  if  [what  is  intended]  is  praise,  [the  allegorical  comparison  makes  it]  more 

splendid  and  magnificent;  and  more  sublime  and  august;  it  excites  the  emotions  more, 

familiarizing the meanings more swiftly, causing more joy; [it is] more effective on the 

praised, a more powerful intercessor for the praiser; more judicious will be his gifts and 

presentations, easier on the tongue and pleasanter to mention; more efficacious at causing 

the heart to cleave to the meaning, and worthier. 

 And  if  [what  is  intended]  is  censure,  the  [comparison's]  touch  is  more  biting,  its 

branding more caustic, its impact severer, its sharpness keener. 

 And  if  it  is  argument  and  disputation,  the  [comparison's]  proofs  are  more 

illuminating, its power is more cogent, its exposition more dazzling. 

 And if [what is intended] is pride and vainglory, its aspiration is farther reaching, its 

honour more serious, its tongue more vehement. 

 And if [what is intended] is apology or excuse, [the comparison] is closer to hearts 

and  better  at  cajoling  them,  dispelling  hatreds  more  gently,  extinguishing  anger  more 

effectively, more captivating in its spells, leading to a better return 

 And if [what is intended] is admonishment, [the comparison] is better healing for 

the breast, more conducive to thought, more eloquent in cautioning and restraining, better 

at disclosing the aim, revealing the purpose, absolving the ailing, healing rancour. 

 If  you  investigate  the  kinds  and  varieties  of  speech  and  study  its  categories  and 

branches, you will see that this is indeed the case. 

 (Here end al-Jurjani's words)

 The  following  verses  contain  evidences  of  the  Qur'an's  miraculousness  and  the 

mysteries  of  its  eloquence.  We  are  mentioning  them  because  of  their  relevance  to  the 

matters discussed in the forthcoming introduction: 

 An example of an allegorical comparison given by the Qur'an in the station (maqâm) 

of praise is that concerning the attributes of the [Prophet's] Companions: 

 "And their similitude in the Gospel is like a seed which sends forth its blade, then 

makes it strong; it then becomes thick, and it stands on its stem, [filling] the sowers with 

wonder and delight. (48:29) 

 In the station of censure are the verses, "His similitude is that of a dog: if you attack 

him,  he  lolls  out  his  tongue,  or  if  you  leave  him  alone,  he  [still]  lolls  out  his  tongue." 

(7:176) "The similitude of those who were charged with the [obligations of the] the Mosaic 

Law, but who subsequently failed in those [obligations], is that of a donkey which carries 

huge  tomes  [but  understands  them  not]."  (62:5)  "We  have  put  yokes  round  their  necks 

right up to their chins, so that their heads are forced up [and they cannot see]." (36:8) 

And so on. 

 

#125 

And in the station of argument and deduction: "Their similitude is that of a man who 

kindled afire." (2:17) "Or [another similitude] is that of a rainladen cloud from the sky; in 

it are zones of darkness... (to the end of the verse)." (2:18) "Or the parable of those who 

reject faith is that of the beast which hears the shepherd's cry, and hears in it nothing 

but the sound of a voice and a call." (2:171) "The parable of those who take protectors 

other than Allâh is that of the spider, who builds [to itself] a house." (29:41) "He sends 

down water from the skies, and the channels flow, each according to its measure; but the 

torrent bears away the foam that mounts up to the surface. Even so, from [ore] which 

they smelt in the fire, to make ornaments or utensils therewith, there is a scum likewise." 

(13:17) "Allah puts forth a parable, a man belonging to many partners at variance with 

each  other,  and  a  man  belonging  entirely  to  one  master:  are  those  two  equal  in 

comparison?" (39:29) And so on. 

 An  example  of  pride  and  dignity,  even  if  not  so-called,  that  illustrates  divine 

sublimity  and  perfection:  "No  just  estimate  have  they  made  of  Allâh,  such  as  is  due  to 

Him; on the Day of Judgement the whole of the earth will be but His handful, and the 

heavens will be rolled up in His right hand. Glory be to Him! High is He above the partners 

they attribute to Him!" (39:67) And so on. 

 

124 

 The only examples of allegorical comparisons in the station of apology and excuse 

are such futile excuses as are mentioned to express disapproval: "They say: Our hearts are 

under veils, [concealed] from that to which you invite us, and in our ears is a deafness, 

and between us and you is a screen." (41:5) And so on. As it says in the poem: 

 Suppose not that my dance among you is joyful, µ  For 

the 

slaughtered 

fowl 

dances out of pain. 

 Examples in the Qur'an of admonishment about the luxuries of this life are these: 

"Here is a similitude; how rain and the growth which it brings forth delight [the hearts of] 

the tillers; soon it withers; you will see it grow yellow; then it becomes dry and crumbles 

away."  (57:20)  "Do  you  see  not  that  Allâh  sends  down  rain  from  the  sky,  and  leads  it 

through springs in the earth? Then He causes it to grow, therewith, produce of various 

colours." 

 

#126 

(39:21) "We did indeed offer the Trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains; 

but  they  refused  to  undertake  it,  being  afraid  thereof;  but  man  undertook  it,  he  was 

indeed unjust and foolish!" (33:72) "Had We sent down this Qur'an on a mountain, verily, 

you would have seen it humble itself and cleave asunder for fear of Allâh. Such are the 

similitudes We propound to men that they may reflect." (59:21) "Then what is amiss with 

them  that  they  turn  away  from  all  admonition  *  As  though  they  were  terrified  asses  * 

Fleeing from a lion?" (74:49-51) "The parable of those who spend their substance in the 

way of Allâh is that of a grain of corn: it grows seven ears, and each ears has a hundred 

grains." (2:261) "... is the parable of a garden, high and fertile; heavy rainfalls on it..." 

(2:265) 

 An example of showing how hypocrisy and harmful acts nullify good works: "Does any 

of you wish that he should have a garden with date palms and vines and streams flowing 

underneath, and all kinds of fruit, while he is stricken with old age, and his children are 

not strong [enough to look after themselves] - that it should be caught in a whirlwind, 

and with fire therein, and be burnt up?" (2:266) "The parable of those who reject their 

Lord is that their works are as ashes on which the wind blows furiously on a tempestuous 

day: no power have they over aught that they have earned; that is the straying far, far 

[from the goal]." (14:18) 

 Some  examples  from  the  categories  of  speech;  [examples  of]  the  station  of 

description (maqâm al-wasf): "Moreover, He comprehended in His design the sky, and it 

had  been  [as]  smoke;  he  said  to  it  and  to  the  earth:  Come  you  together,  willingly  or 

 

125 

unwillingly.  They  said:  We  do  come  [together]  in  willing  obedience."  (41:11)  "Then  the 

word went forth: O earth! swallow up your water, and O sky! withhold [your rain]! And 

the water abated, and the matter was ended. The ark rested on Mount Judi, and the word 

went forth: Away with those who do wrong!" (11:44) "See you not how Allâh sets forth a 

parable?- A goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches [reach] to the heavens 

- * It brings forth its fruit at all times, by the leave of its Lord." (14:24-5) "And the parable 

of an evil word is that of any evil tree: it is torn up by the root from the surface of the 

earth; it has no stability." (14:26) 

 A verse: 

 And the night flowing, the stars showering onto the Milky Way 

 Like a garden, its flaring blossoms extinguished in the river, {[*]: By Ibn al-Nabih al-

Misrî (d. 619 H.) in praise of the Ayyubids.} 

 

#127 

 Consider this: all these allegorical verses are of different levels, degrees, forms, and 

styles. Each contains subtle truths. If you take a silver flagon, decorate it with molten gold 

and stud it with gems, then electrify it making it shine and sparkle, you will behold in it 

many levels of beauty and varieties of adornment. Similarly, in all these verses, allusions 

and indications extend [by means of] the allegorical comparisons from their main aims to 

the [above-mentioned] stations, as though the underlying aim rolls along all these levels 

gathering tints and a share from each, making the words comprehensive summaries [of the 

Qur'an], or epitomes even. 

 

An Introduction [on Eloquence (or Rhetoric)] 

 Consider  this:  one  who  speaks  expresses  a  meaning,  then  offering  evidence 

convinces  the  intellect.  Then  too,  employing  allegories,  he  excites  feelings  in  the 

conscience, so arousing either desire or distaste in the heart and preparing it to accept 

[his words]. Thus, eloquent speech is speech that which the intellect and conscience profit 

from together; it both enters the intellect, and trickles into the conscience. The allegorical 

comparison provides for these two aspects, for it comprises a sort of analogy, and through 

it the law included in the comparison is reflected in the mirror of the thing represented. 

As though the speech is a proposition supported by evidence. For example, you might say 

about a ruler who suffers hardship for the sake of his subjects: "The lofty mountain endures 

the burden of ice and snow, while the valleys below grow green and flourish." 

  

 

126 

Similes form the basis of comparisons, and the function of similes is to arouse feelings 

of disgust or longing or sympathy or aversion or wonder or awe. Thus, the purpose of the 

comparison is to exalt or to denigrate or to arouse longing or aversion, or to defame or 

embroider  or  show  kindness,  and  so  on.  The  conscience  is  aroused  by  the  form  of  the 

comparison and feelings of desire or aversion are provoked. 

 The  need  for  comparisons  arises  from  the  profundity  and  subtlety  of  meanings, 

comparisons  make  these  apparent;  or  [it  arises]  from  the  aim  [what  is  intended  by  the 

speech]  being  disparate  and  scattered,  then  the  comparison  binds  it  together.  The 

allegorical verses of the Qur'an (mutashâbihât) are of the former kind, for according to the 

authoritative scholars (ahl al-tahqîq) these are a sort of elevated comparison and a means 

of expressing sheer truths and abstract ideas. One reason for this is that for the 

 

#128 

most  part  ordinary  people  can  be  taught  truths  only  in  imaginary  form  they  can 

comprehend abstract ideas only by means of comparisons, and this necessitates the use of 

such  allegorical  expressions  (mutashâbihât)  as  "Then  He  established  Himself  on  the 

Throne." (7:54) In this way, taking their understanding into consideration, such ideas are 

made familiar to them. 

 Over the course of time I have deduced from the essentials of eloquence (rhetoric) 

twelve matters preliminary to expounding the Qur'an's miraculousness. Each is the thread 

of (khayt) [means to] many truths. {[*]: This refers to the twelve 'Topics' comprising the 

second part (ikinci Makale) of Nursi's work, Muhâkemat, 77-102.} Having set out above the 

verses  containing  comparisons  and  parables,  it  is  now  appropriate  to  summarize  those 

[twelve] matters. So saying, "Success is from Allâh alone," we begin: 

 

The First Matter 

 The source of the embroideries of eloquence is none other than the arrangement of 

the  meanings;  it  is  not  the  ordering  of  the  words,  which  was  the  domain  of  the 

grandiloquent literalists. Their passion for words developed into a chronic illness so that 

finally  'Abd  al-Qâhir  al-Jurjânl  refuted  them  in  his  Dalail  al-l'jâz  and  Asrâr  al-Balâgha, 

devoting more than a hundred pages to disputing them. 

 The arrangement of the meanings consists of the grammatical meanings being placed 

systematically among the words; that is, the literal (harfi) meanings being dissolved among 

the words to obtain the novel embroideries. If you look into it closely, you will see that 

the natural channel for ideas and emotions is the ordering of the meanings. 

 

127 

 The arrangement of the meanings is constructed through the rules of logic. For it is 

only by means of logic that thought progresses towards truths. And thought reaches truths 

when  it  penetrates  the  subtleties  of  the  natures  of  things  and  their  relations.  And  the 

relations between the essences of things are the bonds of [the universe's] perfect order. 

And the perfect order is the shell of sheer beauty, which is the source of all beauty. And 

sheer  beauty  is  the  garden  of  the  elegant  and  refined  sayings  that  are  the  flowers  of 

eloquence. This flower-filled garden is where the nightingales wander who are known as 

the  men  of  eloquence  and  lovers  of  creation.  And  the  sweet,  soft  songs  of  those 

nightingales  arise  from  the  harmonious  spiritual  echoes  wafting  from  the  pipes  of  the 

meanings' arrangement. 

In Short: The universe is of the utmost eloquence; its Maker composed it flawlessly, 

eloquently. All the forms and species it contains, because of the 

order included in them, are miracles of power. Thus, when speech comes face to face with 

actuality, and its arrangement is in conformity with the latter's order, it possesses purity 

of  style  in  its  entirety.  But  if  it  turns  to  the  ordering  of  the  words,  it  descends  into 

artificiality and hypocrisy, and as though degenerates into dry earth or a delusive mirage. 

 The underlying reason the literalists deviated from true eloquence was that when 

the non-Arabs became Arabicized on being drawn by the attractions of Arab rule, the art 

of words came to have paramount importance for them. With their intermingling with the 

Arabs, the speech of the Mudari, which forms the basis of the Qur'an's eloquence, became 

corrupted; that mirror of the Qur'an's styles became tarnished - although it sprang from 

the emotions and temperament of the Mudar people. So a large number of later scholars 

were carried away by love of the words. 

NOTE: Embellishing words enhances them only if it is necessitated by the meanings. 

And decorating the forms of the meanings only elevates them if the meanings permit it. 

And burnishing the literary devices employed augments the purity of style only if permitted 

by what is intended. And the subtlety of the comparisons becomes eloquence only when 

suitable to the aim and approved by what is intended. And the power and roaming of the 

imagination is eloquence only when it does not mar the truth, nor preponderate over it, 

and  the  imagination  exemplifies  the  truth,  springing  from  it.  If  you  wish  for  some 

 

128 

 

#129 

  

  

comprehensive  examples  of  these  conditions,  you  should  consult  the  above-mentioned 

allegorical verses. 

  

The Second Matter 

 If  rhetorical  magic  (al-sihr  al-bayânî)  is  manifested  in  speech  accidents  become 

substance,  meanings  are  embodied,  inanimate  beings  acquire  spirits,  and  plants  are 

endowed  with  intelligence.  Conversation  then  starts  up  between  them  that  leads 

sometimes to dispute, and sometimes to banter. Lifeless beings start to dance before the 

imagination. If you want an example, consider these lines: 

 Perfidiousness whispered to me from behind his deferment, µ  And  hope  and 

despair fell to disputing in my breast {[*]: By lbn al-Mu'taz; see, Dalail al-I'jâz, p. 61; Diwan 

Ibn al-Mu'taz, p. 226.} 

Or take note of the love between the earth and the rain in the lines: 

 The earth complained to the rain of its tardy coming, µ  Then  drank  deep  of  its 

waters, sipped from its lips. {[*]: See, al-Mutanabî, Diwan, i, 263.} 

 

#130 

  

The Third Matter 

 This depicts the crackling and sprouting of the parched earth on the arrival of the 

belated rains. There must therefore be a grain of truth in every imagining, like in these 

examples, and in the lamp of every metaphor the flame of truth. Otherwise the imaginary 

eloquence is mere fable, good only for exciting wonder. 

 Know  that  the  beauty  and  perfection  of  speech,  and  the  rhetorical garment  with 

which it is clothed, lie in its manner of expression (uslûb). And its manner of expression 

consists of the form of the truths and the model of meanings obtained from the pieces of 

the  allegorical  metaphors  (al-isti'ârât  al-tamthîliyya).  As  though  those  pieces  were  an 

imaginary cinema, like the word 'fruit' points to its orchard, and the word 'combat' to the 

battlefield. 

 Moreover, allegorical comparisons (al-tamthîlât) are founded on the mystery of the 

relations between things, and their reflection in the order of the universe, and some things 

recalling others. For example, for the sons of the date-palm [the Arabs], the sight of the 

crescent moon in the constellation of the Pleaides calls to mind a bunch of grapes [a cluster 

of dates] hanging from a curved whitened stalk. As the Revelation says: "... till it returns 

like an old date-stalk, withered and curved." (36:39) 

 

129 

 The  usefulness  of  comparisons  (uslûb  al-tamthîl),  as  shown  in  the  verses  given 

previously, is that by means of them the speaker brings to light [raises to the surface] deep 

roots and unites scattered meanings. When he hands one side to his listener, it is possible 

for  the  listener  to  draw  the  remainder  towards  himself;  since  they  have  been  brought 

together, he can transfer to them mentally. Since he sees some, though they may be in 

the dark, he can progress step by step towards all of them. 

 For instance, a jeweller defines eloquent speech as "an idea that bores [a pearl like 

a  drill]."  While  a  taverner  would  say  that  it  is  "what  is  cooked  in  the  cauldrons  of 

knowledge." And a camel driver would say of eloquent speech, that it is "what you take by 

the halter and cause to recline in the hollow of the meaning." Observing the art in these 

definitions, someone hearing them would comprehend all they intended. 

 The wisdom in the formation of the literary device (uslûb) [of comparisons] is that 

voluntarily the speaker hails and arouses the meanings reposing in the nooks and crannies 

of his heart, stark and bare. They emerge and enter the imagination, and don the garments 

of  whatever  form  they  find,  that  are  found  there  by  reason  of  the  speaker's  art  or 

occupation or familiarity 

 

#131 

or need. Or at least they tie a kerchief of his art around their heads, or are tinted with its 

hues. The exordia you find in the prefaces of books form the best examples of this matter. 

 However, the style of speech may also be in accordance with the imagination of the 

one addressed, like the styles of [the literary devices used in] the Qur'an. Don't forget this! 

Moreover, the degrees of the styles are various. Some are softer than the breeze; when it 

blows,  it  is  signified  by  the  speech  as  a  whole.  And  some  are  more  covert  than  the 

subterfuges  of  war;  they  can  be  divined  only  by  masters  of  the  art  of  warfare.  Like 

alZamakhsharî divined from the verse "Who can give life to [dry] bones and decomposed 

ones  [at  that]?,"  (36:78)  "Are  there  any  contenders  for  the  fight?"  If  you  like,  study  the 

verses mentioned previously; you will find in them things verifying the subtlest aspects of 

these matters. And if you wish, visit Imam al-Bûsayrî, and see how he writes his prescription 

in the style of a physician with his words: 

 Shed tears from eyes filled µ  With  forbidden  things;  stick  to  a  diet  of 

repentance. 

  

 

 

130 

The  physician's  style  is  alluded  to  with  the  word  diet.  And  listen  to  Sulayman's 

Hoopoe; how it refers to its engineering {[*]: According to al-Kashshaf (al-Zamakhshari), 

this signifies water-divining.} with the words: "That they should not worship Allâh, Who 

brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth..." (27:25) 

  

The Fourth Matter 

that beauty; 

 Know that speech possesses power and strength only if it confirms the lines: 

 Our expressions are diverse but your beauty is one, µ 

And  all  [of  us]  point  to 

[it should confirm them] with all its words, order, and phrases responding to each 

other; and each taking the hand of the other and supporting it, and apart from its particular 

fruits each assisting to its own extent the general purport. This shared aim resembles a 

pool fed from all sides by rivulets. The mutual response gives rise to mutual assistance, 

which gives rise to order, from which harmony proceeds, from which fairness is born, and 

essential beauty. This secret of eloquence sparkles on every part of the Qur'an, especially 

on "That is the Book concerning which is no doubt, guidance sure for those who fear Allâh," 

and others like it, as you saw in "But if a breath of your Sustainer's punishment touches 

them." (21:46) 

The Fifth Matter 

(2:2) 

 

#132 

  

  

 Know that the richness of [any part of] speech and its scope lie in its serving the 

main aim, and its manner and overall form and allusive meanings all indicating and pointing 

to  the  main  aim  together  with  its  subsidiary  and  secondary  meanings.  Then  levels  of 

meaning appear one after the other, and stations appear one behind the next. If you want 

an  example  of  this,  study  "When  it  is  said  to  them:  'Do  not  spread  corruption  on  the 

earth..." (to the end of the verse, 2:11), and "When they meet those who believe..." (to 

the end of the verse, 2:14), as expounded above. 

The Sixth Matter 

 Know that the meanings garnered from the chart of speech are taken and inscribed 

by the camera of the wording according to their various sorts and degrees. Some are like 

air; they can be felt but not seen. Others are like steam; they can be seen but not held. 

 

131 

Yet others are like water; they can be held but not grasped. Others are like molten metal; 

they can be contained but not determined as to shape. And others are like strung pearls or 

beaten gold; they can be given specific shapes and forms. Then, under the effect of the 

aim and station, the insubstantial meaning acquires firmness and body. Three conditions 

mould a single meaning: have you not observed that when some external matter affects 

your conscience, your heart is agitated? Your emotions are excited, insubstantial meanings 

take  flight  and  desires  are  born.  Some  of  these  are  attained.  Then  some  of  these  take 

form. And some of these latter are inhibited. In each of these levels, some of the meanings 

become established and some contract and yet others are suspended, like part of the voice 

is suspended when forming certain letters, and like part of an ear of corn becomes the 

husk  as  the  grains  are  formed.  Thus,  the  eloquent  speaker  is  marked  by  his  expressing 

clearly those things intended by his speech and required by its station, and demanded by 

those he is addressing. The other levels of meaning he refers - in relation to their proximity 

to  the  main  aim  -  to  what  the  sense  infers  and  the  words  indicate  and  the  particular 

circumstances evince and the exordium betokens and the style implies and his own attitude 

 Then there are the suspended meanings; they are ephemeral significative (harfiyya) 

meanings, not expressed by particular words. They are itinerant travellers with no fixed 

abode. Sometimes they are concealed in a word, 

suggests. 

 

#133 

sometimes they are absorbed by a phrase, and sometimes they take refuge in a story; you 

can distill them if you press where they are found. Like the disappointment expressed by 

Mary's mother in the verse, "O my Lord! Behold I am delivered of a female child!," (3:36) 

and the regret in the lines, "Were my youth to return one day, I would tell it of the woes 

of  old  age."  And  such  meanings  as  longing,  self-praise,  addressing  others,  allusion, 

suffering, bewilderment, wonder, and boasting. 

 The relations between all these competing meanings are good on condition attention 

and care are allotted to them proportionately to their serving the main aim. If you want 

examples of this matter, the clearest are provided by this sura, from the beginning up to 

here, and by the manner in which it is expounded. 

  

The Seventh Matter 

 Know that if imagination has a place in a style or literary device (uslûb), it definitely 

has to sprout from a seed of truth, and to be like a mirror reflecting onto non-material 

 

132 

matters (ma'nawiyat) the physical laws and causes and effects in the chains of external 

beings.  The  philosophy  of  grammar  (al-nahw),  the  works  of  which  contain  the  above-

mentioned relationships, is also of this sort - just as it is said that the nominative is the 

right of the doer, for the powerful takes the powerful. You can make further examples in 

the same way. 

  

The Eighth Matter 

 Know that Sibawayh {[*]: Umar ibn 'Uthmân Sibawayh (d. 796 H.), a leading authority 

on Arabic grammar.} stated categorically that particles that express numerous meanings 

like  'from'  (min),  'to'  (ilâ),  and  'by'  (al-bâ'),  and  others,  in  fact  express  only  a  single, 

unchanging,  meaning.  It  is  rather  that  they  absorb  a  suspended  meaning  related  to  the 

context  (lit.  station  -  maqâm)  and  aim,  drawing  it  into  themselves,  and  their  original 

meanings become forms or modes of expression (uslûb) for their guests. Similarly, when 

someone  well-versed  in  the  science  of  language  studies  these  closely,  he  knows  that  a 

shared word [bearing several meanings] mostly has a single meaning. Then, because of the 

relationships between them, the meanings have become similies and some have become 

metaphorical, and others, becoming part of the common language, have lost their original 

meanings  (haqâ'iq  'urfiyya).  In  this  way  single  words  have  come  to  have  numerous 

meanings. The word al-'ayn, which means 'eye' or 'spring,' was applied to 

 

#134 

  

The Ninth Matter 

the sun also, figuratively, for by means of it the celestial world looks down on the lower 

world, or because the water of life which is its light, floods down from that source onto 

lofty white peaks. You can make analogies with this for the rest. 

 Know  that  the  highest  degree  of  eloquence,  which  confounds  the  faculty  of  will, 

personal  thought  and  simple  conceptions,  is  the  speaker  observing  and  preserving  all 

together the relationships of the parts of his speech as well as the relations of the words 

and  the  balance  of  the  sentences.  Each  of  these  with  its  fellows  should  display  an 

embroidery, and interlinking [in their totality, form] a vast tapestry. It is as though the 

speaker  employs  other  brains  as  well  as  his  own,  like  the  builder  of  a  palace  placing 

multicoloured stones in such a way as to obtain a wondrous design out of their balance and 

proportion, or like some calligraphic designs featuring the letter 'ayn, shared by the four 

Rightly-Guided Caliphs. {[*]: Their names all begin with the letter 'ayn: 'Umar, 'Uthmân, 

 

133 

'Ali. 'Atiq was the title of Abu Bakr, the first Caliph.} One of the clearest examples of this 

matter  is  the  verse,  "Alif.  Lâm.  Mîm.  *  That  is  the  Book  concerning  which  is  no  doubt; 

guidance sure for those who fear Allâh" (2:1-2) as you heard above. 

 Another reason for speech being elevated is its resembling a family tree, with the 

branches  and  twigs  of  its  generations  all  denoting  aims  that  point  to  the  main  aim  and 

station (maqâm). A further reason is the speech assuming such a form that many aspects 

and branches can be deduced from it, like the story of Moses (UWP). 

The Tenth Matter 

 Know that speech acquires smoothness and fluency, the source of its subtlety and 

agreeableness, when the meanings and feelings it evinces are blended and combined, or 

are various yet ordered, for then the surroundings do not attract the power of its expression 

and aim, but the centre draws strength from the surroundings. Speech also acquires fluency 

when the aim is well defined, and when the point at which all the intended aims come 

together, is clear. 

The Eleventh Matter 

 

#135 

 Know that the integrity of speech, which is the reason for its correctness and power, 

lies in the following: just as speech should indicate first principles 

and proofs, and allude to primary and secondary meanings; so too with the elements of 

the subject and predicate and their modes of expression, it should infer the repulsion of 

doubts and delusions - as though each part of it is the answer to an implicit question. If 

you want an example, study the Opening Sura of the Qur'an! 

The Twelfth Matter 

 Know that there are three sorts of style or modes of expression (uslûb): 

The First is a sheer or abstract style (al-uslûb al-mujarrad); it is of a single colour 

and is characterized by its conciseness, naturalness, correctness, and integrity. It is smooth 

and even, and used for business, discussions, and the instrumental sciences. If you want a 

fluent example of it, study the works of Sayyid al-Jurjani. 

  

  

 

  

  

 

134 

The  Second  is  the  embellished  style  (al-uslûb  al-muzayyan)  it  is  characterized  by 

embellishment and illumination, and by arousing the heart with either longing or disgust. 

Suitable  places  for  it  are  addresses  [intended  to]  praise  or  censure  and  so  on,  and  for 

persuasion and similar things. If you are looking for an embellished example, enter Dalail 

al-I'jâz and Asrar al-Balâgha, for in them you will happen on many an ornamented garden. 

The Third is the high style (al-uslûb al-'âli), which is characterized by its intensity, 

power, grandeur, and spiritual loftiness. The suitable places for it are divine matters, the 

principles of religion, and philosophy. If you want a perspicuous and miraculous example, 

study the Qur'an, for in it are eloquent truths that have been seen by no eye nor occurred 

to any heart.

Consider this: the noteworthy points in the verse we were discussing: "Their parable 

is that of people who kindle... (Mathaluhum ka-mathal alladhi istawqada...)" (to the end 

of the verse, 2:17), are as follows: 

 Firstly: its positioning in regard to what precedes it. 

 Secondly: the positioning of [and relationships between] its phrases. 

 Thirdly:  the  positioning  of  [and  relationships  between]  the  constituents  of  its 

 Bearing in mind the above [discussion on eloquence], know that having given a clear 

description  of  the  dissemblers'  circumstances  and  their  crimes,  the  Qur'an  cites  the 

following comparison (tamthil) for three reasons: 

phrases. 

 

 

#136 

The  First  of  these:  to  make  [the  new  or  unfamiliar]  appear  familiar  to  the 

imagination  (al-khayâl),  which  accepts  the  products  of  imagination  more  readily  than 

rational ideas; and to make the surmising faculty (al-wahm), which is given to doubts and 

questioning and opposing the reason, submit by showing the strange in a familiar form, and 

by depicting the hidden as visible. 

 The Second: to arouse the conscience and excite disgust in it, so by representing 

what is mental (abstract) as tangible to unite the mind and emotions. 

 The Third: to bind together scattered meanings by means of the comparison, and 

point out the true bonds between them. Also, to plant [the desired facts] before the eye 

of the imagination so that it may garner the subtle points that the tongue fails [to express]. 

 Consider this: the meaning of this verse's phrases corresponds both to the meaning 

of the whole story of the dissemblers, and to all the verses that [relate] it. Don't you see 

that they believed outwardly for worldly advantages, then inwardly they disbelieved. They 

were  then  confused  and  disconcerted.  They  then  did  not  search  out  the  truth  so  were 

unable to return [to it] that they might recognize it. How this resembles the situation of 

people who light a fire or a lamp but cannot keep it alight and it goes out. They are plunged 

in darkness. They can see nothing and it seems to them that everything has ceased to exist. 

Due to the silence of the night it is as though they are deaf; and because the night seems 

blind and their lights have been extinguished, it is as though they are blind; and because 

there is no one they can turn to for help and they receive no assistance, it is as though 

they are dumb; and because they cannot return, it is as though they are lifeless spectres, 

devoid of spirits. The main points in the comparison look to the main particulars of their 

subject [lit. the things compared - mushabbah]. For instance, the darkness looks to [their] 

 

136 

his 

 

#137 

 

  

disbelief, and the bewildered confusion to [their] vacillation, and the fire to dissension. 

You can make further analogies in the same way. 

 -If  you  were  to  ask:  Light  [is  mentioned]  in  the  comparison,  but  how  can  the 

dissembler have light, that the comparison be applied to him? 

 You would be told: If a person has no light, it may be found in his surroundings, from 

where he may seek it. If there is none there, it may be found among his people, from whom 

he may take it. If there is no light among his people, there may be some among the human 

race from which he may benefit. And if not, there may be [a spark that] emanates from 

own inborn nature, from which he may receive effulgence, as has been discussed. If you're 

not  convinced  by  this,  there  may,  in  the  view  of  others,  be  [light]  on  his  tongue,  or 

according to himself, in order to obtain worldly benefits. If you're still not persuaded, [the 

dissemblers  may  have  had  a  light]  because  some  of  them  believed  at  first,  then 

apostatized. If this doesn't convince you, it may be that the light here alludes to what they 

benefited  from,  while  the  fire  indicates  the  dissension  [they  caused].  And  if  you're  not 

satisfied with this either, the fact that guidance was possible through the revelation [of 

the Qur'an] [meant] it was existent, as is indicated by the [preceding] verse, "These are 

the people who have purchased error [at the price of] guidance. (ûlâ'ika alladhîna ishtaraw 

al-dalâlata bi'l-hudâ.)" For this is the close neighbour of the comparison. 

Now for the positioning of [and relationships between] the phrases of the verse: 

 Consider this: the positioning of the phrase "who kindle a fire (alladhî istawqada 

nâran)" is absolutely fitting. For the lighting of fire in this way was entirely consistent with 

the situation of the first people the Qur'an was addressing. They were the inhabitants of 

the  Arabian  Peninsula  and  without  exception  had  experienced  such  a  situation,  or  had 

heard about it, and had suffered its upsetting effects. They had taken refuge in the night 

from the sun's tyranny, travelling in darkness. Very often the skies would press down on 

them and they would feel the weariness of travel, and sometimes their road would lead 

them  to  the  abyss.  They  would  also  roam  in  the  gloom  of  caves  filled  with  noxious 

creatures. Then they would lose their way and need to kindle a fire or light a lamp to see 

their companions or feel close to them even, and to see their possessions and protect them, 

and  make  out  the  path  they  should  take,  and  so  that  ferocious  beasts  and  other  perils 

 

137 

would be visible to them and they could avoid them. Then, when they were well lit up with 

the light it would be suddenly extinguished at a blow from the heavens. Filled with hope 

and about to accomplish their goals, they would be cast into the deepest despair. [The 

Qur'an] states this clearly with the words: "but as soon as it has illumined all around them, 

Allâh takes away their light (fa-lamma adâ'at mâ hawlahu dhahaba Allâhu binûrihim)." 

 The "but (fa-)" at the beginning of the phrase indicates that they kindled the fire for 

light  and  it  lit  up  [all  round  them]  and  they  felt  confident  at  this.  But  they  were 

immediately overcome by frustration and disappointment. How powerfully effective is this 

being thwarted at the very moment of 

 

#138 

success! The light being taken away in the [consequence - that is, second half - of the] 

conditional sentence is apparently necessitated by the illumination [but the necessity of 

this  is  not  obvious].  The  necessity  being  hidden  indicates  the  existence  of  implied 

[sentences], as follows: 

 When all was lit up around them they busied themselves with the light yet did not 

preserve it. They did not give it due importance and were not aware of its value. They did 

not  keep  [the  fire]  alight  and  it  went  out.  For  being  preoccupied  with  the  result,  they 

neglected the means. As inferred by the verse "But man doth transgress all bounds, * In 

that he looks upon himself as self-sufficient (inna'l-insana la-yatghâ; An râhu'staghnâ)," 

(96:6-7)  [their  preoccupation  with  the  light]  was  the  cause  of  its  ceasing  and  being 

extinguished, as though the very illumination caused the light to vanish. 

 As for the phrase "and leaves them in utter darkness (wa tarakahum fi zulumâtin)," 

having  pointed  out  how  they  lost  the  bounty  of  the  light,  [the  Qur'an]  describes  their 

disappointment at the calamity of being plunged into darkness. 

 The phrase "[wherein] they cannot see (lâ yubsirûn):" know that when darkness falls 

and a person loses his way, he may stop and be consoled by the sight of his companions 

and possessions. But if he does not see them, stopping may be as bad for him as moving 

on, or even worse. 

 The  phrase  "Deaf,  dumb,  blind  -  and  they  cannot  turn  back.  (Summun  bukmun 

'umyun fa-hum lâ yarji'ûn):" when a person is overcome by such a calamity, he finds solace 

by hoping for salvation and seeking it from four successive directions: 

 Firstly  he  hopes  to  hear  the  cries  of  nearby  villagers  or  other  travellers  and 

[anticipates] that if he calls for help they will save him. But since the night is soundless 

 

138 

and silent, he is no different to a deaf man, so [the Qur'an] calls him "deaf" and that hope 

 Secondly he hopes that if he shouts or calls out for help there is the possibility that 

someone will hear and come to his aid. But when the night is deaf and dumb, there is no 

difference between the speaker and someone dumb, so [the Qur'an] calls [him] "dumb," 

silencing him and destroying that hope too. 

 Thirdly he hopes to be saved by espying some sign or a fire or light that will show 

him the way to his destination. But when the night is overwhelmingly ashen-black, frowning 

and  blind,  the  seeing  and  the  blind  are  the  same,  so  [the  Qur'an]  calls  [him]  "blind" 

extinguishing that hope too. 

 Fourthly: nothing now remains to him but to try to return. But the darkness 

is lost. 

 

#139 

has descended on him and he is like someone who has got stuck in a quagmire of his own 

accord and can find no way out. Indeed, how many matters there are that you get involved 

in willingly then against your will you cannot turn back; you desist from them but they do 

not let you go. So the Most High says: "and they cannot turn back" to shut this door on them 

too, severing this last cord that they were clinging on to. So they fall into the darkness of 

despair, desolation, wretchedness, and fear. 

 Now for the third aspect, I mean the positioning of [and relationships between] 

the constituents of the phrases: 

 Consider  "Their  parable  is  that  of  people  who  kindle  a  fire  (Mathaluhum  ka-

mathal  alladhi  istawqada  nâran),"  and  see  how  the  sparks  of  fine  points  fly  off  in  all 

directions from its words. 

 The word "parable" indicates the strangeness of the dissemblers' situation and that 

their story is remarkable. For a parable is something that is on every tongue and people 

recount it to each other because it is odd and unusual; its most salient characteristic is its 

curiousness.  It  is  because  fundamental  principles  are  included  in  parables  and  proverbs 

that they are called "common wisdom" and "popular philosophy." What is intended here by 

the  parable  is  [to  describe]  this  characteristic  strangeness  and  their  curious  story  and 

abhorrent state. In other words, the metaphorical use of the term "parable" to describe 

their  situation  indicates  their  being  unusual  and  odd.  And  this  indication  implies  that 

characteristically,  this  attribute  of  theirs  is  met  with  disgust  and  condemnation  by 

everyone, as with a proverb. 

  

 

139 

As for the "ka-" of "ka-mathali - is that [the parable] of:" 

- If you were to ask: If this had been omitted it would have been an elegant simile. 

Wouldn't that have been more eloquent? 

 You would be told: It is of greater eloquence in this context (maqâm) to mention it, 

for its explicitness alerts the mind, causing it to look on the parable in second place and 

to transfer from the main points [the parable is making] to what it is alluding to. For if 

[the  reader's  mind]  were  to  become  intentionally  absorbed  in  [the  parable  itself],  its 

subtleties that should be applied [to what it is alluding to] would elude it. 

 The  second  [instance  of  the  word]  "parable  (mathal)"  indicates  that  with  its 

strangeness and existence in the common mind, the situation of the one kindling the fire 

 - If you were to ask: Why is this [relative pronoun] singular when [the dissemblers] 

is as though proverbial. 

  

Now for "who (alladhî'):" 

are plural? 

 

#140 

 You would be told: If the part and the whole, and the individual and the collectivity 

are  equal  and  membership  [of  the  collectivity]  neither  increases  nor  diminishes  the 

individual's attributes, it is permissible [to use it for both the singular and plural] in two 

respects, as in "[their similitude (mathal) is] that (mathal) of a donkey." The use of the 

singular  indicates  that  each  individual  independently  represents  the  consternation  and 

abhorrence of all of them. Or it may be that "alladhî" is an abbreviated form of "alladhîna" 

[the plural form]. 

 The sin of "istawqada - kindle" [that is, the verb being in the Xth form] alludes to 

[their] seeking and taking trouble, while its being in the singular although the subsequent 

"their  light  (nûrihim)"  has  the  plural  pronominal  suffix  is  a  subtle  sign  that  the  person 

kindles it for the group. It is indeed subtle that the singular is used for the kindling and the 

plural is used for the being illumined. 

 The  use  of  "a  fire  (nâran)"  instead  of  'the  lamp'  or  something  else  alludes  to  the 

hardship  [involved]  in  the  light  of  God's  commands  [and  trials],  and  indicates  that  they 

were  kindling  the  fire  of  dissension  under  the  guise  of  a  light.  "A  fire"  being  indefinite 

indicates that their need for fire was so intense they did not mind what form it took. 

  

 

140 

Now cast an eye over the phrase "but as soon as it has illumined all around them, 

Allâh takes away their light (fa-lammâ adâ'at mâ hawlahu dhahaba Allâh bi-nûrihim)," 

and see how its words light up the darkness of their bewilderment, which is their main 

aim.  You  heard  [read]  in  the  Fourth  Matter  above  that  the  power  of  speech  lies  in  the 

mutual response of its parts. 

being full of hope. 

 The "but" ("fa-" in "fa-lamma") hints at the immediate onset of absolute despair after 

 "As  soon  as  (lammâ)"  comprises  a  proportionate  conditional  syllogism  which,  by 

demonstrating the certainty of the first [proposition], infers the certainty and realization 

of  the  subsequent  one;  [that  is,  their  being  overwhelmed  by  darkness]  and  losing  their 

source of consolation. 

 "It  has  illumined  (adâ'at)"  indicates  that  they  kindled  the  fire  for  light,  not  for 

warmth. And this hints at their terrible dismay, for its illumination only served to see the 

perils [besetting them] and to learn of their existence. Had it not been for [the light], they 

could have deceived themselves and felt reassured. 

 While  "all  around  them  (mâ  hawlahu)"  indicates  that  they  were  encompassed  by 

terror on all four sides, and that they had to preserve themselves with the light from the 

harms beleaguering them from all six directions. 

 

 

#141 

 As for "takes away (dhahaba)," it is the consequence of the condition and therefore 

necessitated by [the first part of the conditional sentence] "it has illumined (adâ'at)," but 

as discussed above, this necessity is [not clear, it is] hidden and implies [these sentences]: 

they did not attend to and maintain the fire and did not know its value as a bounty, and 

the light made them get above themselves and their glee and cockiness made them forget 

to tend it, so Allâh took it from them. 

 The ascription of "takes away (dhahaba)" to Allâh indicates the frustration of two 

hopes: hope of rectifying [their situation] and hope of divine mercy. For it infers that the 

heavenly visitation does not allow their situation to be put to rights and suggests that it is 

the punishment for human faults. This is the reason Allâh the Most High chastises them. 

Thus  what  they  were  cleaving  to  was  torn  away  from  them  when  the  causes  were 

suspended, and this was the hope of mercy. For help cannot be sought from the truth in 

order to nullify it. 

 

141 

 The  [preposition]  "bi-"  of  "bi-nûrihim"  ("their  light")  signifies  [their]  despairing  of 

[the  light]  returning,  for  what  Allâh  has  taken  cannot  be  sought.  For  there  is  a  clear 

difference  between  "dhahaba  bih"  which  means  "he  laid  claim  to  it  and  took  it,"  and 

adhhabahu [IVth form], which means "he removed it or took it away," while dhahaba [1st 

form] means "he went on his way." In the latter two there is the possibility of return, but 

in the former there is none. 

 In  "light  (nûr)"  is  a  slight  hint  about  [the  dissemblers']  situation  on  the  Bridge  of 

Sîrat. The possessive pronominal suffix "their (-him)," which denotes particularity, infers 

their  terrible  grief.  For  a  person  suffers  greater  sorrow  if  his  fire  goes  out  while  other 

people's fires are burning brightly. See how the very subtlest pearls of eloquence are Allâh's 

in the Qur'an! Do you not see how all the parts [of the sentence] are turned towards the 

general aim; I mean, the [dissemblers'] alarm and despair is like a pool at the confluence 

 Now consider carefully "and leaves them in utter darkness, wherein they cannot 

see (wa tarakahum fi zulumâtin lâ yubsirûn):" the [conjunction] "and (wa)" indicates that 

they combine two losses: they are stripped of the light and clothed in darkness. 

 The use of "left, abandoned (taraka)" instead of 'he made stay' (abqa) or something 

similar  suggests  that  they  have  become  like  lifeless  corpses  and  kernelless  shells.  It  is 

fitting therefore that they should be abandoned as worthless and discarded. 

 The "in (fi)" infers that in their view everything has ceased to exist and that nothing 

remains  but  the  darkness,  which  seems  to  be  non-existence  and  encases  them  like  the 

 The  plural  of  "darkness(es)  (zulumâtin)"  indicates  that  the  blackness  of  the  night 

and tenebrous clouds have given rise to the darkness of despair and fear in their spirits, 

and that where they are found is filled with the darkness of desolation and despondency. 

For them time too is filled with the darkness of silence and motionlessness. It suggests that 

they  are  entirely  swathed  in  multifarious  darknesses.  The  use  of  the  indefinite  signifies 

that the darkness is unknown to them, their never before having experienced it, and this 

increases its impact on them. 

 As for "they cannot see (lâ yubsirûn)," it states clearly the worst calamities. For the 

person who cannot see suffers more tribulations, and because he lacks sight he experiences 

[to a greater degree] the slightest misfortunes. The imperfect tense is used to depict their 

 

142 

of rivers? 

 

 

#142 

grave. 

condition  [vividly]  in  the  eye  of  the  imagination  so  the  listener  [actually]  sees  their 

consternation and his conscience is affected. The verb is without object to generalize [the 

meaning]; they cannot see anything that would be of use to them and might protect them, 

and they cannot see the dangers that they might avoid them; and they cannot see their 

companions to avail themselves of their intimacy. It is as though each is on his own and 

alone. 

 Next  consider  the  phrases  "Deaf,  dumb,  blind  -  and  they  cannot  turn  back 

(Summun  bukmun  'umyun  fa-hum  lâ  yarji'ûn)"  and  listen  to  how  they  confide  in  one 

another.  For  these  four  [phrases]  are  a  definition  shared  (hadd  mushtarak)  by  both  the 

parable  or  comparison  (mumaththil)  and  the  thing  portrayed  (mumaththal).  They  are 

intermediate between them and are turned to both. They tell of both sides' conditions, 

and are a mirror to both showing you their characters. They result from both and tell you 

their stories. 

 The aspect looking to the comparison: know that a person who is struck by such a 

calamity clings onto the hope of being saved by listening closely for the voice of someone 

who might save him. But the night is so silent and soundless it deafens him. Still he hopes 

to make someone hear, but the deafness of the night makes him dumb. Then he hopes to 

be guided by the sight of a fire or light, but the unseeing night makes him blind. Then [he 

hopes] to return to the start [of his journey] but the door is blocked up against him like 

one who falls into a bog and the more he struggles the more he sinks into it. 

 

#143 

successive ways: 

 The aspect looking to those depicted in the comparison: know that when they get 

caught up in the darkness of disbelief and dissembling they could be saved from it in four 

 Firstly: They could raise their heads and listen to the truth and heed the Qur'an's 

guidance, but when the rush of desire prevents the sound of the Qur'an entering their ears, 

and their frenzy takes them by the ears and holds them back from this path, the Qur'an 

reproaches them with the epithet "deaf'!" This indicates that this door is blocked up and 

suggests that their ears have been cut off. 

 Secondly:  They  should  lower  their  heads  and  consult  their  consciences,  and  ask 

about  the  truth  and  the  path.  But  when  obstinacy  seizes  their  tongues  and  hatred  tugs 

them back into the hollow of their mouths, the Qur'an deals a blow at them with the word: 

"dumb!" This indicates that that door too is shut in their faces and alludes to their failing 

to endorse the truth. 

 

143 

 Thirdly: They should make the effort to extract lessons from the evidences in the 

world around them, but heedlessness places its hand over their eyes and feigned blindness 

draws down their eyelids, so the Qur'an calls them "blind!", a sign that they have strayed 

from this path too. The omission of the particle 'ka' indicates that their eyes - the lights of 

the head - have as though been plucked out. 

 Fourthly: They should recognize the ignominy of their situation and feel disgusted 

and regret it and repent and return, but because, due to the corruption of their natures 

caused  by  their  insisting  on  their  way  and  the  dominance  of  lust  and  Satan,  their  souls 

make these abominations seem appealing to them, so the Qur'an says: "and they cannot 

turn back." This is a sign that the final paths have been closed up for them and indicates 

that  although  they  have  got  into  this  situation  voluntarily  they  do  not  have  the  will  to 

extricate themselves and are floundering like a man caught in quicksands.

 Or [the parable] of a violent cloudburst in the sky, with utter darkness, thunder 

and lightning: they put their fingers into their ears to keep out the peals of thunder, in 

terror  of  death;  but  Allâh  encompasses  [with  His  might]  all  who  deny  the  truth.  *  The 

lightning  well-nigh  takes  away  their  sight;  whenever  it  gives  them  light,  they  advance 

therein, and whenever darkness falls around them, they stand still. And if Allâh so willed,

 The  noteworthy  points  in  these  verses  may  also  [be  subsumed  under]  three 

[headings]: their positioning in regard to the preceding verses; the postioning of the verses' 

phrases  [and  the  relationships  between  them];  and  the  relationships  between  the 

constituents of the phrases. These resemble the relationships between the hour, minute, 

and second hands of a clock. 

 

#145 

those that preceded it: 

 That aspect of the word-order [that looks to the positioning] of these verses and 

 The Qur'an repeats the parables thus extending its descriptions and indicating the 

need to describe [at length] the dissemblers in their alarm and confusion, which are of two 

sorts, [as is shown in the following summaries]: 

 A  Summary  of  the  First  Parable:  The  dissembler  sees  himself  in  the  desert  of 

existence apart from his fellows, ostracized from the assembly of beings and outside the 

jurisdiction of the true sun. In his view everything is non-existent, all creatures are alien; 

silent and motionless they are forlorn and [doomed to] extinction. Can this compare with 

the believer, who through the light of belief looks on beings as friendly and is familiar with 

all the universe? 

  

  

A Summary of the Second Parable: The dissembler supposes that in its entirety the 

world is announcing his death with its calamities, and menacing him with its disasters, and 

screaming at him with its events, and raining down blows on him from all sides, as though 

all its beings have united in enmity to him and everything beneficial has become harmful. 

The only reason for this however, is his having no support and no source of help, as has 

been discussed. Can this compare with the believer, who by virtue of his belief hears the 

glorifications of all beings and their joyous utterances? 

 Moreover,  the  fact  there  is  a  second  parable  indicates  that  the  dissemblers  are 

divided  into  a  common  low  class,  conformable  with  the  first  parable,  and  an  arrogant, 

overweening class, corresponding to the second. 

The relationship of this latter parable with the context (maqâm), in respect of the 

listener: The first people the Qur'an was addressing were the desert-dwellers whose bed 

was the floor of the desert and roof the tent of the heavens. They had all experienced 

these  things  or  heard  about  them  from  their  fellows,  and  were  therefore  familiar  with 

them and found them as effective as proverbs. The relationship of this second parable with 

 

145 

 

#146 

  

  

the first one is abundantly clear, for it completes and perfects it and in many instances 

even makes the same points. The relationship between the parable and those depicted by 

it [the dissemblers] has six aspects: 

The First: They are both totally overcome by bewilderment when all ways of escape 

are blocked up and all means of deliverance [are suspended]. 

 The Second: They are both overwhelmed by terrible fear and they all imagine that 

beings are united in hostility to them and that they cannot live in safety even for a minute. 

 The Third: They are both struck by alarm so fearsome they become insane and lose 

their minds. It is like someone who sees a flashing sword and tries to defend himself by 

closing his eyes, or hears the roar of guns and tries to avoid being hit by stopping up his 

ears, or like someone who does not want the sun to set and impedes the workings of his 

watch so that the wheel of fate will cease to turn. How crazy they are! For the thunderbolts 

will not turn back when they stop up their ears, nor will the fiery lightning pity them when 

they close their eyes. From this it is understood that they have nothing left to cling on to. 

 The Fourth: The sun and rain, and light and water are apparently the source of the 

life of flowers and plants and for the raising of them, but they also cause dead things to 

putrefy and filthy things to rot. Similarly, if mercy and bounty do not encounter places 

that  are  ready  and  prepared  for  them  and  know  their  value,  they  are  transformed  into 

trouble and revenge. 

 The Fifth: Just as, if one disregards the words, there is a correspondence between 

the meanings [of the second parable and of the story of the dissemblers it portrays], which 

form the basis of the allegorical metaphor 

(al-isti'âra  al-tamthiliyya)  so  too  there  are 

relationships between the parts [of both of these]. For a cloudburst is the life of plants, as 

Islam is the life of spirits. The thunder and lightning indicate promise and threat, while 

the darknesses show you the doubts of disbelief and scepticism of dissembling. 

The positioning of [and relationships between] the verses' phrases: 

 With  the  phrase  "a  violent  cloudburst  in  the  sky  (ka-sayyibin  min  alsamâ'),"  the 

Qur'an infers that [the dissemblers] resemble people forced to travel through a wild desert 

on a dark night in a violent rainstorm, the calamitous rain pelting down on them like bullets 

from the brimming sky. In this way it is alerting the listener's mind, for he is waiting for an 

explanation of why the rain clouds, which are essentially much desired mercy, are such a 

 

146 

ghastly calamity. So to illustrate their awesomeness, it says: "with utter darkness(es) (fihi 

zulumâtun),"  suggesting  that  the  rain  contains  the  clouds'  darkness  and  denseness. 

Similarly, because of its abundance and being so widespread and general, it is as though 

with its black droplets [the rain] contains the fragmenting night. As soon as the listener 

hears "with utter darkness" he expects an explanation, as though the speaker hears the 

sound of thunder in his brain so says: "and thunder (wa ra'dun)." This suggests its menacing 

threats, for the skies, the commander of beings, are intent on wiping out [the dissemblers] 

and they rumble and roar at them 

 

#147 

with their thunder. In the face of this, the terrified calamity-stricken [dissemblers] imagine 

that the universe, whose beings co-operate and assist each other, is bent on harming them 

despite its tranquillity, and despite its silence is howling at them horribly. When they hear 

the  thunder  they  imagine  it  is  uttering  threats  at  them,  for  out  of  fear  they  think  it  is 

roaring at them. 

 Then as soon as the listener hears the thunder, its constant companion strikes his 

mind, and for this reason [the Qur'an] says: "and lightning (wa barqun)," which indicates 

through  the  use  of  the  indefinite  that  it  is  strange  and  wondrous.  Yes,  it  is  indeed 

wondrous. For when it is born, a world of darkness dies and is wrapped up and cast into 

nothingness. But on its death another world of darkness is resurrected and raised to life. 

It is as though it is fire that when extinguished leaves as its legacy a world full of smoke. 

The  person  struck  by  it  therefore  should  examine  it  attentively  and  not  glance  at  it 

superficially  due  to  familiarity,  for  in  this  way  he  may  discover  the  subtle  art  of  divine 

power. 

 Having heard these descriptions the listener is moved to ask: "What did they do? Did 

they attempt anything?" So the Qur'an says: "they put their fingers into their ears to keep 

out the peals of thunder, in terror of death (yaj'alûna asâbi'ahum fi âdhânihim min al-

sawâ'iq hadhara al-mawt)," indicating that [the dissemblers] have no refuge and no place 

of recourse, and are like drowning men who clutch at what cannot be clutched at. In their 

terror, they use their fingers instead of just the fingertips, as though their alarm is beating 

them on the hands so they stuff their hands in their ears out of pain, and in their stupidity 

they  block  up  their  ears  so  the  thunderbolts  do  not  strike  them.  Following  this,  the 

listener's  mind  [continues  to]  investigate  and  he  asks:  "Is  this  calamity  general,  or  is  it 

particular,  that  [escape  is  still]  hoped  for?"  And  [the  Qur'an]  replies:  "but  Allâh 

encompasses  [with  His  might]  all  who  deny  the  truth  (wa  Allâhu  muhitun  li'l-kâfirîn)," 

 

147 

inferring that the disaster is a penalty for their ingratitude for bounties. Allâh the Most 

High punishes them through it for their remaining exceptions to the divine laws deposited 

in general run of beings (aljumhûr). 

 When [the listener] hears the violent peals of thunder, he asks himself: "Won't the 

lightning be useful for them by lighting up their way?" So [the Qur'an] says: "The lightning 

well-nigh takes away their sight (Yakâdu albarqu yakhtafu absârahum)," indicating that 

just  as  the  thunder  is  inimical  to  them  and  they  are  unable  to  hear,  so  the  lightning  is 

hostile towards them 

 

#148 

with its light, blinding their eyes. Then hearing that the universe is united in its hostility 

towards them, the listener's mind calls out: "What will happen to them? What can they do? 

What  are  they  trying  to  do?"  So  [the  Qur'an]  says:  "whenever  it  gives  them  light,  they 

advance therein, and whenever darkness falls around them, they stand still (kullamâ adâ'a 

lahum mashaw fihi wa idhâ azlama 'alayhim qâmû)," indicating that they are confused, 

hesitant, and bewildered, watching for the slightest opportunity and the smallest glimpse 

of the road. Whenever it appears to them they move forward, but with their anguished 

spirits, jerkily like decapitated hens, and then become frozen to the spot. 

 So  by  way  of  enquiry  the  listener's  mind  asks:  "Why  don't  they  die,  or  become 

completely blind and deaf, and be saved from their anguish?" And [the Qur'an] says: "And 

if Allah so willed, He could indeed take away their hearing and sight (wa-law shâ'a Allâh 

la-dhahaba bi-sam'ihim wa absârihim);" that is, they do not deserve to be delivered from 

their plight. For this reason, [divine] will does not cause them to die. If it were to act, it 

would take away their hearing and sight. It is more fitting for those who are recalcitrant 

and  deviate  from  the  laws  of  the  Most  High  that  they  retain  their  ears  to  hear  their 

punishment and their sight to see it. 

 Containing  all  these  points,  from  beneath  its  exterior  the  story  hints  at  divine 

sublimity  and  power,  and  the  disposals  of  the  Most  High  in  the  universe,  especially  the 

marvels  of  the  thunder,  lightning,  and  clouds.  On  recalling  this,  with  his  conscience 

aroused the listener declares: "Glory be to Him! How great the power of the One whose 

awesomeness the universe manifests, and whose wrath these calamities display!" So [the 

Qur'an] said: "Verily Allah is powerful over all things (inna Allâhu 'aid kulli shay'in qadir.)" 

  

 

 

 

148 

Now for the relationships between the constituents of the phrases: 

 Know that the "or" of "or [the parable] of a violent rainstorm" (the "aw" of "aw 

ka-sayyibin,") indicates that [the dissemblers] represented in the comparison are divided 

into  two  sorts,  and  is  a  sign  that  there  is  a  true  correspondence  both  between  the  two 

parables, and between them and [the condition of] the dissemblers, and that there is an 

indisputable  similarity  between  them.  Moreover,  the  "or"  comprises  the  [intensifying 

conjunction] "bal al-tarqiyya" [meaning, but rather, no on the contrary, but, indeed], for 

the  second  parable  is  more  terrifying.  The  lack  of  correspondence  between  "or  [the 

parable]  of  a  violent  rainstorm  (aw  ka-sayyibin)"  and  the  dissemblers  [that  is,  the 

dissimilarity between them, because the dissemblres are 

 

#149 

being likened to the rainstorm] necessitates that the thing [the rain] does resemble 

is implied (muqaddar). This implied thing is not stated for conciseness and the words are 

made concise [that is, the purpose of the ellipsis is] to make the meaning prolix, and the 

prolix meaning is referred to the listener's imagination so he may seek further meanings 

from the context. Thus by reason of this lack of correspondence [the Qur'an] is as though 

saying: "or they resemble people who journey through the empty desert and dark night and 

are struck by many calamities resulting from a violent rainstorm." The replacement of the 

familiar friendly word 'rain' (matar) with "rain cloud; downpour (al-sayyib)" infers that the 

droplets of the rain are each calamities (masâ'ib) pelting down on them like bullets finding 

their mark (tusîbahum), and that [the dissemblers] have nowhere to shelter. 

 The explicit mention of "(lit. from) in the sky (min as-samâ')" [stating] specifically 

that the rain comes from the sky alone, is to express generality. That is, the sky is specified 

to make it absolute (itlaq), as in the verse "There is not an animal [that lives] on the earth, 

nor  a  being  that  flies  on  its  wings;"  (6:38)  that  is,  the  rain  has  taken  possession  of  the 

whole face of the sky. Some Qur'anic commentators concluded from "from the sky" here 

and from the verse "And He sends down from the sky mountain masses [of clouds] wherein 

is hail," (24:43) that the rain falls from the body (firm) of the sky, and some of them even 

imagined the existence of an ocean beneath the sky. but [the science of] eloquence (or 

rhetoric) does not endorse this. No, the meaning is "from the direction of the sky," and the 

sky is specified for the above-mentioned reason. Moreover, [since] the word "sky" is used 

[generally] for everything above you, the clouds and atmosphere [may also be said to be] 

the sky. 

  

 

149 

Verification of the Subject  (tahqîq al-maqâm): If you consider [divine] power, [you 

will see that] all sides are equal [before it]; that is, the rain may fall from any direction. 

 And if you consider divine wisdom, [you will see that it] establishes the optimum 

order in things, necessitating the preservation of the general balance, and that it chooses 

the most direct means. As for the rain, it is [formed] through the condensation of the water 

vapour dispersed through the globe of the atmosphere, one of the ten constituents of which 

is this vapour in its depths. 

 

 

#150 

 An  Elucidation  of  this:  When  divine  will  commands  the  [water]  molecules,  they 

comply  and  steal  away  from  all  around.  They  join  forces  and  become  rainladen  clouds. 

Then on the orders of their commander they 

condense and become raindrops. The angels, who are the representatives of the laws [in 

force in the universe] and reflect its order, take them by the hand so they do not crowd 

together [in masses] and strike each other, and they take them down to the ground. In 

order to preserve the balance of the atmosphere, the seas and earth vaporize to replace 

what has been lost through distillation. The reason some people imagined the existence of 

a heavenly ocean was their conceiving of metaphors as facts. For to portray the green of 

the atmosphere as the colour of the sea, and the atmosphere as containing more water 

than the Pacific Ocean, is a figure of speech not distant from the reality. 

 Consider the verse: "And He sends down from the sky mountain masses [of clouds] 

wherein is hail" (24:43) and understand that to dwell on its apparent meaning although it 

has kindled a light with its metaphor (isti'âra) is to be coldly insensible and literalist. For 

just as the verse "Crystal-clear, made of silver" (76:16) contains a fine metaphor, so does 

"mountain masses [of clouds] wherein is hail" consist of one that is singularly strange and 

beautiful. The food dishes of paradise are made neither of crystal nor of silver, but have 

the transparency of crystal and the shining whiteness of silver. This is indicated by the fact 

that crystal is not made of silver and that they are different materials, and also by the use 

of  [the  partitive]  "of(min)."  Similarly,  "mountain  masses  [of  clouds]  wherein  is  hail" 

contains  two  metaphors  which  in  the  listener's  view  are  founded  on  poetical  imagining. 

This imagining is based on observing an analogy and likeness between the representation 

of the higher world and formation of the lower one. And this observation is based on the 

idea of a beauty contest between the earth and the sky and a competition in the garments 

clothed on them by the hand of power. It is as though when the earth appears with its 

 

150 

mountains clothed in the white garments of snow and ice in the winter, and is turbanned 

with them in the spring; and when in the summer it is adorned with its colourful gardens, 

presenting to the view of wisdom through its transformations the miracles of divine power; 

the atmosphere responds by imitating it and competing with it in displaying the miracles 

of divine sublimity. It appears veiled, attired in the broken clouds like towering mountains, 

hills,  and  valleys.  Tinted  with  various  colours,  it  depicts  the  earth's  gardens,  intimating 

with the most shining of evidences divine splendour and majesty. 

 In consequence of this vision and mutual resemblance and imaginary vista, the simile 

of  the  clouds  was  greeted  favourably  in  Arabic  styles  of  speech,  especially  the  summer 

clouds being likened to mountains, ships, 

 

#151 

gardens,  valleys,  and  caravans  of  camels,  as  may  be  heard  in  the  oratory  of  the  Arabs. 

Thus,  in  the  view  of  [the  science  of]  rhetoric  [or  eloquence]  it  seems  that  the  summer 

clouds are travelling floating in the skies, with the thunder [as a shepherd] tending them 

[like a flock] and spurring them on [with its shouts], whenever it shakes the staff of its 

lightning at them in the oceans of the skies, the clouds quiver and are convulsed. They 

appear like mountains crumbling on doomsday, or ships tossed about in a storm, or gardens 

quaking with earth tremors, or a caravan fleeing from the attack of bandits. Nevertheless, 

[the clouds] do travel and are swept along; it is even as if all the molecules of water vapour 

lie hidden and silent in their places awaiting the orders of their Creator. Then when the 

thunder  booms  out  like  a  military  bugle:  "Gather  together  and  form  ranks!",  vying  with 

each other they leap up from their places and run with all speed to the one summoning 

them, and are resurrected as clouds. Then having performed their duties and received the 

order to retire, they all fly off to their aeries. 

 It is because of this imaginary relationship and the proximity and neighbourliness 

between the clouds and the mountains - for in order to draw up moisture the cloud forms 

on the mountain in accordance with its size and it wears its dress; and because the cloud 

has the colour of the snow and ice and is fashioned through their moisture and coldness; 

and because of the brotherhood between the mountain and the cloud, and their exchanging 

forms and dress in many places in the Qur'an, and their shaking hands in the revelation as 

they converse and embrace each other on many lines of the page of the earth in the book 

of the world; and as you see the cloud resting on the mountain so that the mountain is like 

a dock or anchorage for the ships of the clouds, or a place where they take counsel, or a 

nest on which they alight - it is because of all these things that in the view of eloquence 

 

151 

they deserve to be neighbours, exchanging and borrowing things. Thus, it calls the clouds 

mountains without the use of the particle [of likening ka-]. 

 If you have understood all you have heard about these relationships, [you will have 

understood that] "And He sends down from the sky" means from the direction of the sky, 

and  "mountain  masses  [of  clouds]"  means  clouds  like  mountains,  and  "wherein  is  hail" 

means in respect of their colour, moisture, and frigidity. So since there is an interpretation 

acceptable to the science of rhetoric, what makes you believe that the rain [which] falls 

in  two  minutes  [comes]  from  a  distance  of  five  hundred  years  in  opposition  to  Allâh's 

wisdom, who makes everything with the finest art and precision? 

 

#152 

 The relationships and positioning of the phrase: "with utter darkness (lit. in which 

are darknesses) (fihi zulumâtun):" 

 The aim of this is to intimidate. The precedence of "in which (fihi)" is a sign that 

with their imaginations, both the terrified calamity-struck [dissemblers] and the listener 

fancy that the darkness of many dark nights has been emptied entirely into this night. Then 

its being said that the darknesses are within the rain [the cloudburst] although it is vice-

versa, suggests that the frightened men suppose space to be a pool filled with rain, and 

the night to be contained within it, interspersed between its molecules. 

 "Darknesses" being plural alludes to their variety: the darkness of the black clouds 

and their denseness and covering the whole sky, the heaviness of the rain and the largeness 

of its drops, and the compounded darkness of the night. 

 And the word "darknesses" is indefinite because [the darknesses] are unknown and 

particularly because those addressed are ignorant of them. And [its being indefinite] is also 

corroborative [for not knowing is a sort of darkness]. 

 As for the phrases "and thunder and lightning (wa ra'd wa barq)," their aim is to 

portray the bewilderment and alarm [of the dissemblers], and [to indicate that] disaster-

struck and baffled, they focus all their attention on the least significant event. For scrutiny 

leads  a  person  to  understand  the  wondrously  strange  revolutions  and  changes  in  the 

thunder and lightning. But when [the dissemblers] see the darkness invading the universe 

and swallowing up beings - like nothingness - their bewilderment is turned into orphanlike 

grief and they fall silent as the dead. For they see the clearest evidences of existence, the 

utterance of those lofty beings [the thunder], then their appearance when the veil is lifted 

[on the flashing of the lightning], and they are filled with consternation, bewilderment and 

fear. For when they see the boundless darkness in infinite space, which they can in no way 

 

152 

overcome, they look in despair. But then, when those darknesses are suddenly emptied out 

of  space  and  vanish  and  everywhere  is  filled  with  light,  their  absolute  despair  is 

transformed into hope. 

 Know that thunder and lightning are two clear signs from the World of the Unseen. 

They are in the hands of the angels appointed to the world of the clouds to oversee the 

ordering  of  its  laws.  Divine  wisdom  ties  causes  and  their  effects,  and  when  clouds  are 

formed from water vapour dispersed in the atmosphere, some of them are charged with 

negative electrons and others with positive electrons. When two come close to each other 

they collide 

 

#153 

suddenly  and  lightning  is  produced.  Then  on  one  cloud  staging  an  assault  and  being 

suddenly uprooted, and its place being filled by another so there should be no vacuum, the 

layers  oscillate  and  undulate  which  produces  the  sound  of  thunder.  However,  these 

atmospheric  conditions  occur  within  the  order  and  laws  represented  by  the  angel  of 

thunder and lightning. 

 The rain (cloudburst) being shown to contain [the thunder and lightning] although 

[in reality] it is the clouds that contains them is because the terrified [dissemblers], and 

the  listener  who  is  alarmed  at  their  terror,  look  on  the  pelting  rain  as  encompassing 

everything since it is encompassing them. 

 The use of the singular for the thunder and lightning although darknesses is plural 

indicates that the source of the calamity-stricken dissemblers' fright is their imagining the 

sky to be speaking and menacing them with its thunder, and the flashing lighting revealing 

[their  dreadful  situation].  These  are  the  verbal  meanings  [ma'nâ  masdârî  -  and  such 

meanings are singular] {[*]: Nursi, İsârâtû'I-İ'caz [Abdûlmecid], 144.} and [resemble] "the 

shining  hand."  {[*]:  This  association  of  the  thunder  and  lightning  with  speech  and  "the 

shining hand" (al yad al-baydâ') is an allusion to two of Moses' miracles. See, Qur'an, 20:22ff; 

26:33;  27:12;  28:32.  See,  Nursi,  İsârâtû'l-İ'caz  [Bahaeddin  Sağlam],  190.}  Also,  each  is  a 

different sort of being (naw '), although there are numerous instances of each, [and what 

is intended is the sort, not the individual instances of them]. 

 "Thunder" and "lightning" are indefinite since they are not qualified by adjectives; 

that is, [the 'nunation' signifies implied adjectives such as] crashing thunder and dazzling 

lightning. It indicates too that [the dissemblers] are unfamiliar [with their reality] because 

all their attention is focussed on the curious aspects of them. It also hints that they do not 

 

153 

recognize the thunder and lightning because they have stopped up their ears and shut fast 

 The parts of the phrases: "They put their fingers into their ears to keep out the 

peals of thunder, in terror of death (yaj'alûna asâbi'ahum fi âdhânihim min al-sawâ'iq 

their eyes. 

hadhara al-mawt):" 

 This  sentence  is  the  reply  to  an  implied  question  and  a  fine  'commencement' 

[isti'nâf- that is, it is not tied to what precedes it]. For when the listener addresses himself 

to this emotional, allegorical story, he feels an intense desire to discover the circumstances 

of the calamity. Once this is depicted perfectly, his curiosity is satisfied and he then desires 

to learn the condition of the calamity-struck men. He as though asks: "What state are they 

in now? What are they doing to save themselves?" And the Qur'an 

 

#154 

replies saying: "They put their fingers into their ears to keep out the peals of thunder, in 

terror of death." That is, there is no escape for them; they are like drowning men clutching 

at straws, for they try to protect themselves from the heavenly projectiles by blocking up 

their ears. But that is impossible and they cannot be saved. 

 The word "they put (yaj'alûna)" is used instead of 'they put into' (yadkhulûna) as a 

sign that they searched for some means [of escape] but the only thing they could think of 

was  sticking  [their  fingers  in  their  ears].  The  use  of  the  imperfect  tense,  which  evokes 

present situations, indicates that [on hearing about] such bewildering circumstances the 

listener  conjures  up  in  his  imagination  the  actual  time  and  place.  The  imperfect  also 

indicates  [the]  continuance  and  perpetual  renewal  [of  the  calamity],  and  in  this 

continuance is a sign that the clouds are attacking them incessantly. 

 The  use  of  "fingers  (asâbi'ahum)"  instead  of  'fingertips'  indicates  their  complete 

confusion. 

 And "into their ears (fi âdhânihim)" alludes to their awful fright at the sound of the 

thunder, making them imagine that the thunder is going to enter their ears and their spirits 

will fly out of the doors of their mouths. In this is a subtle sign that they did not open their 

ears to the call of truth and good advice so are being punished in this way by the crash of 

thunder; that is, as they blocked them up [voluntarily] in the first instance, so they are 

[forcibly] blocked up in the second. Like someone who says something disgraceful is hit in 

the mouth, and he puts his penitent right hand over his mouth and covers his eyes with his 

ashamed left hand. 

 

154 

 "[To keep out] the peals of thunder (min al-sawâ'iq)" indicates that the thunder and 

lightning united to harm them, for the thunder(bolt) comprised both a terrible noise and 

scorching fire, felling whomever it encountered. 

 As for "in terror of death (hadhara al-mawt)," it hints that the calamity has reached 

its final point and the knife has hit the bone. Everything is finished except life, and now 

they are concerned with nothing except fear of death and the wish to save their lives. 

 The parts of the phrase: "but Allâh encompasses [with His might] all who deny 

the truth (wa Allâlu muhîtun bi'l-kâfirin):" 

 Consider  this:  the  conjuction  "but  (lit.  and)  (wa)"  necessitates  a  relationship 

between two clauses, and here it is between the implied outcome of the previous [phrase] 

and this one. It is as though the conjunction is denouncing them, saying: "These are people 

who fled from town life and loathe civilization. They rebelled against the law that makes 

the night the 

#155 

time of rest, and did not comply with the advice they were given. Now they suppose they 

can  be  saved  by  escaping  from  the  desert,  but  they  are  frustrated  in  this  and  are 

encompassed by Allâh's tribulations." 

 The word "Allah" signifies the dashing of their final hope. For the only recourse and 

solace for those smitten by disaster is Allâh's mercy, and when they come to earn His wrath 

that hope is extinguished. 

 The word "encompasses (muhîtun)" infers that those all-encompassing calamities are 

the  works  of  the  Most  High's  wrath.  Just  as  the  sky,  clouds,  thunder,  and  night  are 

assaulting  them  from  all  six  directions,  so  the  Most  High's  wrath  and  His  tribulations 

surround them. Moreover, the Most High's knowledge and power encompass all beings, and 

His  command  embraces  all  particles.  So  it  is  as  though  "encompasses"  is  declaiming  at 

them: "They cannot pass beyond the regions of the heavens and earth," (see, 55:33) and 

"whithersoever you turn, there is the countenance of Allâh." (2:115) 

 "All  those  who  deny  the  truth  (bi'1-kâfirîn):"  the  [preposition]  "bi-"  prefixing  this 

suggests that [the dissemblers] have happened upon the very thing they were fleeing from 

and have become the target for its arrows. 

 This  latter  phrase  indicates  that  the  image  of  those  represented,  that  is,  the 

dissemblers, is portrayed in the mirror of the parable. This is so that the listener's mind 

should not be diverted by the parable and he does not forget the aim. It also indicates that 

the  parable  and  those  portrayed  in  it  are  so  similar  they  are  virtually  the  same;  the 

difference between them has almost faded away so they seem identical and reality and 

 

155 

imagination have merged. The phrase also signifies the gloominess of their hearts, for their 

consciences torment them too with their faults and crimes. Those who receive requital for 

their crimes are not easy in their consciences. 

 Now  the  parts  of  the  phrase:  "The  lightning  well-nigh  takes  away  their  sight 

(Yakâdu al-barq yakhtafu absârahum)" 

 This is apparently unconnected [to the previous phrase and therefore] implies that 

the  listener  is  asking:  "Why  don't  they  take  advantage  of  the  lightning  to  reduce  the 

calamity of the darkness for themselves?" And he is told: "They are scared of its harm more 

than [wanting] its advantages." 

 By reason of its well-known property "well-nigh (yakâdu)" points to the loss of their 

sight, but for some reason they did not lose it completely. {[*]: Kâda yakâdu, means on the

 "Snatches away (yakhtafu):" since this word is usually used with ghouls 

and  eagles  it  denotes  here  a  subtle  instance  of  eloquence  that  flashes  in  the  brain  and 

indicates that the lightning races with the eye's beam to see which can reach things first 

to  capture  their  images.  It  overtakes  it  and  cuts  it  short,  and  strikes  it  on  the  eyelid, 

extinguishing its light. It is as though when the eye's light speedily quits its home to capture 

the images of things, the lightning, which is the beam of the sky's eye, races against it and 

seizes the image from it before it can get it home. That is, the lightning swipes the image 

from the eye. 

 And by virtue of [the eyes] being the mirror of the heart, "their sight (absârahum)" 

alludes to the dissemblers' eyes being blind to the decisive proofs of the Qur'an. 

 Now  for  the  parts  of  the  phrases:  "whenever  it  gives  them  light,  they  advance 

therein, and when darkness falls around them, they stand still (kullamâ adâ'a la-hum 

mashaw fihi wa idhâ azlama 'alayhim qâmû):" 

 The fact that this is a fresh start [and not apparently related to what precedes it] 

(isti'nâf) indicates that it is the answer to the questions the listener asks when he sees all 

these  different  calamities  and  asks  about  [the  dissemblers']  circumstances  in  both 

situations. 

 The fact that "whenever (kullamâ)" precedes "it gives them light (adâ'a)" and the 

"when (idhâ)" precedes "darkness falls (azlama)" indicates [the dissemblers'] intense desire 

for light, seizing on the least light they can. [For the former means 'whenever' denoting 

numerous  occasions,  and  the  latter  means  'when  and  if.']  "Whenever"  also  comprises  an 

analogous conditional syllogism. 

 

156 

 The  [preposition]  "to  (la-)"  in  "it  gives  (to)  them  light  (adâ'a  la-hum),"  signifies 

causation  (al-ajliyya)  and  benefit,  and  is  a  sign  that  the  terrified  calamity-stricken 

[dissemblers] are plunged in [concern for] their own needs so that they suppose the light 

that the hand of power is spreading through the world for thousands of general instances 

of wisdom is meant for them alone, and that the hand of power is sending it for their sake. 

 Although [the dissemblers] should seize the opportunity [of the light] to travel on 

quickly,  [the  word]  "they  advance  (lit.  walk)  (mashaw)"  [is  used],  indicating  that  the 

calamity has held them back and they can only move forward slowly at walking pace. 

 The [pronominal suffix -hi] in "therein (fihi)," [referring to the light] indicates that 

the distance they move forward is [that permitted by the brief instant of] the light, which 

is the colour of time. Thus it as though limits them as to space. 

 

#157 

opportunity. 

behind. 

 The [conjunction] "and (wa)" in "and when (wa idhâ)" indicates that the calamity is 

continuous,  which  increases  its  severity.  And  since  contrarily  to  "whenever  (kullamâ)," 

"when (idhâ)" expresses particularity and neglect [since the generalizing suffix -mâ has not 

been added], it points to their extreme revulsion [at the darkness] and their blindness, and 

that it seizes them when they are lost in the instant of [light], [which affords them] an 

 The ascription of "darkness falls (azlama)" to the lightning alludes to darkness after 

light being more intense, and indicates that when in their imaginations the calamity-struck 

[dissemblers] see the lightning [first] banishing the darkness but then filling where they 

are found with it, they fancy that [the light] has been extinguished, leaving only smoke 

 "Around  (lit.  on,  against)  them  ('alayhim)"  infers  harm  and  indicates  that  the 

darkness is not imposed by chance but is a punishment for their actions. It indicates too 

that the terrified [dissembler] imagines the darkness to be filling the sky and is directed 

at him among all beings, despite his insignificance and contemptibility, and that its assaults 

and harm are aimed at him in particular. 

 The use of "they stand [up] still (qâmû)" instead of 'they become still, stop' (sakanû) 

is  a  sign  that  due  to  the  calamity  and  their  strenuous  efforts  [to  combat  it]  they  had 

become bent at the waist as though bowing in prayer, which is characteristic of a person 

who  works  earnestly  at  something,  [and  had  straightened  up  when  the  darkness  struck 

them]. 

 

157 

 Now for the parts of the phrase "And if Allâh so willed, He could indeed take away 

their hearing and sight (wa-law shâ'a Allâhu la-dhahaba bisam'ihim wa absârihim):" 

 Being a conjunction, the "And (wa)" hints that the hand of power acts under the veil 

of causes and that wisdom superintends from above all causes. 

 "If  (law)"  comprises  a  non-analogous  conditional  syllogism;  that  is,  its  not  having 

been willed is the reason ('illa) for their [hearing and sight] not being lost; similarly, their 

not being lost is evidence that divine will has not caused them to be lost. It is also a sign 

that the conditions for their being lost have been virtually fulfilled. 

 "Wills (shâ'a)" indicates that the only thing binding cause and effect is divine will 

and wish, and it is divine power that executes [the act]. Causes are merely a veil to divine 

dignity and grandeur so that the hand of power is not seen by the mind's eye[, which sees 

only the apparent,] to be in contact with lowly things. 

 

#158 

ness. 

 The explicit use of the name "Allâh" is an indication [warning] people against their 

addiction to causes and restraining them from becoming immersed in them. It also invites 

minds to see the hand of power behind all causes. 

The  omission  of  the  object  of  the  verb  "wills  (shâ'a),"  although  such  an  object  is 

necessary according to the usual rules, is permissible here due to the associated meanings 

(qarîna) of other words. The omission infers that divine wish and will are not affected by 

the events of the universe, and that things have no effect on the divine attributes. Human 

will however is affected by things and their beauty and ugliness, and greatness and smAll-

 "He could indeed take away (la-dhahaba)" indicates that causes do not have control 

and supremacy over effects so that if they were to be raised, the effects would remain in 

a vacuum, the playthings of coincidence and tossed around by chance; rather, the hand of 

power is present behind causes. When it plucks things out [of non-existence] the hand of 

divine wisdom takes them through the law of balance and order, and sends them to other 

places; it does not neglect them. [For example,] when heat breaks down the structure of 

water, through the order [laws] included in the air the steam follows a determined course 

and its Maker sends it to a specified place. Similarly, in "dhahaba" is a sign that [man's] five 

external senses are not produced by nature and that there is nothing to necessitate the 

cavities of the eyes and ears; they are the gifts and bounties of the Most High. Cavities and 

causes are merely the usual conditions [for their existence]. 

 

158 

 The  verb  "dhahaba"  is  made  transitive  by  the  following  [preposition]  "bi-"  in  "He 

could indeed take away their hearing (la-dhahaba bisam'ihim)," instead of with 'hamza;' 

[that is, the IVth form of the verb]. This is a sign that the hand of power does not take 

things by the reins of causes, nor are they free to wander with their halters hanging from 

their necks; rather their halters are [firmly] in the hands of [the laws and] order. 

 Since "hearing" is in the singular and "sight" is in the plural, "their hearing and sight 

(bi-sam'ihim wa absârihim)" indicates that one thing is audible, while numerous things may 

be seen. For a thousand men may hear the same thing at the same time, but what they 

 The parts of the phrase "for verily Allâh is powerful over all things (innâ Allâhu 

 Consider this: this phrase is a summary of the study of horrors in the parable and 

[the people] portrayed in it. It indicates that just as the details of 

see will be different. 

'alâ kulli shay'in qadîr):" 

 

#159 

the  calamity-stricken  [travellers']  circumstances,  which  represent  faithfully  the 

dissemblers' circumstances, are not neglected [by divine power]; so the disposals of divine 

power are to be seen in every minute particle. 

 Together with indicating that this statement is an unshakeable truth, the particle 

"inna (verily)" alludes to the vast breadth and delicateness of the matter, and to human 

impotence, weakness, and faultiness concerning it, arising from [man's] delusions, which 

are  the  consequence  of  his  doubts  concerning  matters  of  certainty.  [That  is,  with  its 

certainty, "inna" dispels the doubts.] 

 The  explicit  use  of  the  name  "Allâh"  alludes  to  proof  of  the  statement  [of  His 

omnipotence],  for  total,  all-embracing  power  is  the  necessary  inherent  quality  of  the 

Godhead. 

High. 

 

 As for "over ('ala)," it indicates that divine power, which brings things out of non-

existence,  will  not  let  them  go  for  nothing,  futile  and  vain;  rather,  divine  wisdom  will 

oversee them and supervise their being raised and reared. 

 "All  (kull)"  suggests  that  the  works  of  causes,  as  well  as  the  results  (al-hâsil  bi'l-

masdar) of [man's] voluntary actions, are [brought about] through the power of the Most 

 "Thing (shay')," having the meaning of "thing willed by Allâh (mashiy ')," indicates 

that after coming into existence, beings cannot be independent of their Maker; indeed, 

they are in need of His efficacy for their continuance - which is the repetition of existence. 

159 

 As  for  the  use  of  the  word  "powerful  (qadîr)"  rather  than  'qâdir'  [the  active 

participle], is a sign that divine power cannot be measured like determined things, for it 

is  an  unchanging  necessary  inherent  quality  that  accepts  no  increase  or  decrease.  It  is 

impossible for its opposite, impotence, to encroach on it, or for any [degrees of] intensity 

or weakness [to intervene in it]. It is a sign too that power is like the basic verbal pattern 

in [Arabic] grammar, that is, fa'ala, for all the attributes of action (al-awsâf al-fi'lîyya), 

such  as  Provider  (al-Razzâq),  Forgiving  (al-Ghaffâr),  Giver  of  Life  (al-Muhyî),  Dealer  of 

Death (al-Mumît), and so on. [That is, power is their basis.] 

 Now reflect well and long on what you have heard!

 O you people! Worship your Lord and Sustainer, who has created you and those [who

Introduction 

 You should know that it is worship that instils the tenets of belief [in the believers] 

making them a very part of their character. For if matters pertaining to the conscience 

and reason are not nurtured and strengthened by worship, which consists of carrying out 

Allâh's commands and abstaining from His prohibitions, they remain ineffectual and weak. 

The present state of the Islamic world testifies to this. 

 

 

160 

ٰ
ّ
 Know too that worship is the cause of happiness in this world and the next, and is a 

means  of  ordering  life  here  and  there,  and  a  cause  of  attainment  and  perfection,  both 

individual  and  collective.  It  is  an  exalted,  esteemed  relation  between  Creator  and 

bondsman. 

 

#161 

 There are several reasons worship is the cause of happiness and prosperity in this 

world, which is the tillage of the hereafter: 

 Firstly: Man has been created with a strange, subtle nature distinguishing him from 

all other living beings and making him an exception to them. By virtue of this there have 

arisen in him the desire to choose, and the wish for the most beautiful things and for fine 

decoration, and a natural desire to have a livelihood and position befitting humanity. 

 For his food, dress, and accommodation - the need for which arises due to the above-

mentioned desires - to be prepared proficiently man has need of multiple arts and crafts, 

but he is incapable of practising all of these on his own. He needs therefore to mix with 

his fellow-men and to co-operate with them, and for all of them to assist each other and 

exchange the fruits of their labour. However, since so as to allow men's progress by means 

of  the  mainspring  of  the  will  the  All-Wise  Maker  placed  no  innate  limits  on  the  [three] 

human  powers  of  appetite,  anger,  and  intellect  -  as  with  the  animals  and  their  limited 

powers - tyranny and aggression have arisen. And since no limit has been placed on them, 

the  powers  [tend  to]  aggression  and  the  [human]  community  is  in  need  of  justice  when 

exchanging the fruits of its labour. But because the intellects of single members of society 

are incapable of comprehending justice, the human race as a whole needs a general or 

universal intellect [to establish] justice from which all may benefit. And that intellect is 

the universal law, and that law is the Shari'a. Then in order to preserve the effectiveness 

of the Shari'a and its enforcement, a lawmaker is necessary, someone to lay claim to it and 

promulgate it, an authority, and that is the Prophet (Upon whom be blessings and peace). 

 Then  in  order  to  perpetuate  his  outward  and  inward  domination  over  [people's] 

minds and hearts the Prophet needs to be eminently superior both physically and spiritually 

and morally, and in conduct and appearance, and by nature and in character. He is in need 

too of proof of the strength of his relations with the Lord of All Sovereignty, the Master of 

the  World,  and  such  a  proof  is  his  miracles.  Then  in  order  to  secure  obedience  to  [its] 

commands and avoidance of [its] prohibitions he is in need of perpetuating the idea of the 

Maker's  grandeur,  the  Master  of  all  Sovereignty,  and  that  is  [possible]  through  the 

manifestation of the tenets of belief. Then in order to perpetuate this idea and fix the 

 

161 

tenets  of  belief  firmly  in  their  minds,  he  needs  a  constantly  repeated  reminder  and 

renewed act, and that reminder is nothing but worship. 

Secondly: The purpose of worship is to turn minds towards the All-Wise 

  

 

#162 

Maker. And this turning towards induces obedience and submission, and this includes [the 

worshippers] under the perfect order [in the universe] and binds them to it. To follow this 

order leads to the realization of the mystery of wisdom, and the wisdom is testified to by 

the perfect art in the universe. 

 Thirdly: Man resembles a pole to the top of which are joined electric cables, for 

attached to his head are the tips of all the laws of creation; the natural laws extend to 

him, and the rays of the divine laws and principles in the universe are reflected and centred 

on him. So man has to complete them and adhere to them and cling on to them to facilitate 

the general current lest his foot slips and he falls and is crushed under the wheels of the 

machinery turning in the levels [of the world]. And this is achieved through worship, which 

consists of conforming to the commands and prohibitions. 

 Fourthly: By complying with the commands and prohibitions numerous connections 

are formed for a person with the many levels of society, and the individual becomes like a 

species. For many of the commands, especially those that touch on the marks [of Islam] 

and the general good, resemble threads to which are tied [people's] honour and through 

which their rights are set in order. If it were not for them, all those rights and duties would 

be torn up and scattered to the wind. 

 Fifthly: The Muslim has firm relations with all other Muslims and there are strong 

bonds between them. By reason of the tenets of belief and [the Muslims'] Islamic traits 

these relations give rise to unshakeable brotherhood and true love. And it is worship that 

makes manifest the tenets of belief and renders them effective, and roots them firmly in 

the pysche. 

  

How worship is the cause of personal attainment and perfection: 

 Consider this: together with being physically small, weak, and powerless, and being 

one  of  the  animals,  man  bears  within  him  an  exalted  spirit,  and  has  vast  potentiality, 

unrestricted desires, infinite hopes, uncountable ideas, and unlimited powers, and he has 

a nature so strange he is as though an index of all the species and all the worlds. As for 

worship,  it  expands  his  spirit  and  raises  his  value;  it  causes  his  abilities  to  unfold  and 

 

162 

develop, allowing him to become worthy of eternal happiness. Worship is also a means of 

rectifying  and  purifying  his  inclinations,  and  of  realizing  his  hopes  and  making  them 

fruitful, and of marshalling his ideas and setting them in order, and also of reining in and 

limiting his [three] powers [of appetite, anger, and intellect]. Worship also removes the 

rust of nature from his members, physical and spiritual, each of which when transparent 

is like a window onto his private world and that of humankind. Also, when 

 

#163 

performed with both conscience and mind and heart and body, worship raises man to the 

dignity  of  which  he  is  worthy  and  to  his  appointed  perfection.  It  is  a  subtle,  elevated 

relation, an illustrious lofty connection between the bondsman and the One Worshipped. 

This relation constitutes the utmost degree of human perfection. 

 Sincerity  in  worship  is  this,  that  it  is  performed  only  because  it  is  commanded, 

although it comprises numerous instances of wisdom [and benefits]. Each of these may be 

a reason ('illa) for performing worship, but sincerity makes it imperative that the [true] 

reason be the command to perform it. If the wisdom or benefit is made the reason, the 

worship is null and void, but if it merely encourages the person to perform the worship, it 

is permissible. 

 When those addressed hear the words "O you people! worship..," they ask through 

the tongue of disposition: "Why and for what reason? What is the wisdom in it? Why should 

we? And what for?" You learnt the wisdom in the introduction above; concerning the reason 

('illa), the Qur'an replies with proof of the Maker and His unity with the words: "Your Lord 

and Sustainer who created you..." Then with the verse: "If you are in doubt about what 

We have revealed," (2:23) it proves prophethood. 

 

An Introduction 

Explaining Certain Points [arising from] This Verse 

 Consider this: a proof (burhan) is [in the form of] either the argument from material 

cause to material effect (limmî), or the argument from effect to cause (innî'). This latter 

is sounder, and it is either based on contingency (imkânî), that is, the argument that since 

contingent beings are equal in respect of being and non-being there must be [a Necessary 

Being]  to  choose  this  (al-murajjih)',  or  it  is  based  on  createdness  (hudûthî)  that  is,  the 

argument that since there is constant change and renewal in beings, there must be One to 

give  them  existence  (al-mûjid).  Each  of  the  above  proofs  is  in  respect  of  either  the 

essences of things or their attributes, and in respect of either the giving of existence or 

 

163 

the continuation of it. And all of them are either the proof that things are given existence 

out of nothing (dalîl ikhtirâ'î) or the proof of divine providence (dalil 'inâyatî). The present 

verse alludes to all these types of proof. Included here is [only] a summary of them, for 

we have explained them in detail in another book. {[*]: Nursi, Muhâkemat, 107 ff.} 

 

#164 

 The  proof  of  divine  providence  (dalîl  'inayatî)  is  the  proof  of  the  Maker  that  is 

indicated by this verse and consists of the order included in the universe. For the order is 

a thread to which is attached all benefits and instances of wisdom. All the Qur'anic verses 

that enumerate the benefits of things and mention their purposes are 'the weaver' of this 

proof and are where this argument is manifested. For just as the order, with which all the 

instances  of  wisdom  and  benefits  comply,  proves  the  existence  of  the  Orderer,  so  it 

demonstrates the Maker's intention and wisdom, and repulses the delusion of blind chance 

and unseeing coincidence. 

 Now  see!  If  you  cannot  encompass  this  elevated  order,  adorned  with  bezels  of 

wisdom,  with  your  sight,  and  you  are  incapable  of  understanding  it  through  inductive 

reasoning, look through the prying eyes of the sciences which are the senses of your species 

and are formed through the meeting of minds and conjunction of ideas, and are like the 

ideas of the human race for you will see an order that dazzles the mind. You will know too 

that each of the physical sciences discloses through the universality of its principles, the 

order and harmony, the more perfect than which cannot be conceived of. For there is a 

science [to study] every area (naw ') of the universe, or there will be [that is, each could 

sustain a science]. 

 Science  consists  of  universal  principles,  and  this  universality  demonstrates  the 

beauty of the order. For there can be no universality in something without order. Don't you 

see  that  if  we  say:  "All  religious  scholars  wear  white  turbans,"  it  is  confirming  the 

universality, for there is order among that group (naw')? It leads on from this that by reason 

of  the  universality  of  their  principles,  all  the  sciences  demonstrate  through  inductive 

reasoning a total, all-embracing order; each is a shining proof pointing to the benefits and 

fruits hanging in bunches from the links of the chains of beings, indicating too the instances 

of  wisdom  and  advantages  concealed  in  their  changing  states.  The  sciences  raise  the 

banner of divine unity and testify to the Maker's purpose and wisdom. Each of them is a 

shining star piercing the darkness and repulsing the satans of delusion and doubt. 

 If you like, now disregard the general [order] and consider the following example: a 

microscopic organism so small it is invisible to the naked eye comprises an extremely fine 

 

164 

and  wonderful  divine  machine.  Necessarily  and  self-evidently,  this  machine,  which  is 

contingent in both its essence and attributes and states, did not come into existence of 

itself without a cause. Like the pans of some scales, contingent beings are equal in respect 

of both existence and non-existence; if one preponderates, it remains in 

 

#165 

non-existence. Thus, as all reasonable people agree, there has to be a cause to make the 

choice. It is impossible that this should a natural cause. For the exquisite order of [the 

machine] necessitates infinite knowledge and perfect intelligence, and it is impossible to 

conceive of these in such causes, about which [the Naturalists] deceive themselves. The 

causes  are  simple,  few,  and  lifeless  and  cannot  specify  their  course  or  restrict  their 

motions, hesitant as they are between thousands of possibilities, some of which have no 

primacy. So how does [a cause] follow a specific course and travel a defined path, and how 

can it choose certain aspects of the possibilities so that it produces this marvellous, well-

ordered  machine  the  subtlety  of  the  instances  of  wisdom  of  which  leave  minds  in 

astonishment? You could only convince yourself and feel happy at it if you ascribed to every 

single particle the intelligence of Plato {[*]: Plato (c. 428-348 B.C.), the great Athenian 

philosopher and pupil of Socrates, and teacher of Aristotle. His most famous work was the 

Republic.} and wisdom of Galen {[*]: Galen, the Greek physician and philosopher of the 

2nd  century  A.D.  who  for  centuries  was  the  supreme  authority  in  medicine.}  and  you 

believed that all these particles communicated with each other. And this a sophistry that 

would put even the Sophists to shame. 

 Although the forces of attraction and repulsion form the basis of physical matter in 

the smallest indivisible atoms, this appears to be the combining of opposites. Yes, the law 

of attraction and that of repulsion and others are the names of the laws of divine practice 

and the Most High's Shari'a of Creation (al-sharî'at al-fitriyya), which is called nature. Such 

laws are acceptable on condition they do not cease being principles and become nature, 

and exist only in the mind and are not ascribed external existence, and do not cease being 

merely  theoretical  and  become  real,  and  do  not  cease  to  be  seen  as  means  and  are 

considered effectual. 

 Now if you have understood this example [of the microscopic organism] and you have 

seen its vastness despite its infinitesimal size, and its breadth despite its narrowness, raise 

your  head  and  observe  the  universe:  you  will  see  the  clarity  of  the  proof  of  divine 

providence  (dalîl  al-'inâya)  and  that  it  is  as  clear  and  obvious  as  the  universe.  All  the 

Qur'anic verses that recount the bounties of things and recall their benefits manifest this 

 

165 

proof. When the Qur'an enjoins reflective thought, it generally directs the one it addresses 

to the method of this [deductive] reasoning (istidlâl): "So turn your vision again; do you 

see any flaw?" (67:3) And this verse, how [clearly] it points to this proof: "Who has made 

the earth a resting-place for you and the sky a canopy, and has sent down water from the 

sky and thereby brought forth fruits for your sustenance." (2:22) 

 

#166 

 The proof that things are given existence out of nothing (al-dalîl alikhtirâ'î), which 

is alluded to by the verse "who has created you and those [who lived] before you (alladhî 

khalaqakum wa alladhîna min qablikum)," is this: Allâh the Most High gave every species 

and all the members of each, a particular being which is the source of its particular works 

and the perfections of which it is worthy. For since all species [and realms of beings] are 

contingent,  as  are  the  never  ending  chains  of  causes,  none  can  go  back  in  unbroken 

succession to pre-eternity. Also, since there is [constant] change in the world, it proves 

[the world's] createdness, sometimes through observation and sometimes through rational 

necessity. It has also been demonstrated by biology and botany that there are more than 

two  hundred  thousand  sorts  of  species  and  that  each  has  a  progenitor  and  forefather. 

Contingency  and  createdness  prove  therefore  that  necessarily  these  progenitors  and 

forefathers  emerged  without  intermediary  from  the  hand  of  divine  power.  Moreover, 

[causes] cannot be imagined [at the first creation] as they are imagined in the chains of 

causes. Furthermore, the delusion of the splitting off of some species from others is invalid. 

For  [since  either  the  offspring  are  barren  or  the  line  becomes  extinct,]  an  intervening 

species mostly does not become the start of new chains through reproduction. It is most 

likely therefore that since the origins and beginnings are thus, the successive members will 

also be thus. How can it be imagined that simple, lifeless natural causes, which are devoid 

of  intelligence  and  will,  should  be  capable  of  bringing  into  existence  these  chains  [of 

beings] which astound the mind, and of creating (ikhtirâ') the individual beings, each of 

which is a marvel of art and miracle of divine power? Hence, all beings and the chains of 

which  they  are  parts  testify  decisively  through  the  tongues  of  their  createdness  and 

contingency to the necessary existence of their Creator, may His glory be exalted. 

 -If you were to ask: Why when there is this decisive testimony do people believe in 

such misguided [ideas] as the pre-eternity of matter and its motion? 

 You would be told: If a person looks at something indirectly he may consider the 

impossible to be possible, like the old man searching the sky for the crescent moon of the 

festival ('îd) saw the white hair resting on his eyelid [and thought it was] the moon. For by 

 

166 

virtue of his lofty essence and noble nature, man pursues truth and right. And if the false 

and invalid fall 

 

#167 

into  his  hand,  then  involuntarily  -  so  long  as  he  has  not  sought  or  searched  for  it  -  but 

because of his superficial, indirect view, he is forced to accept it. Because when he ignores 

the  order  [of  the  universe],  which  is  the  thread  [to  which  is  tied]  all  the  instances  of 

wisdom,  and  fails  to  see  the  contrariness  of  the  motion  [of  particles  as  the  source  of 

matter] and the pre-eternity of matter, it becomes possible in his indirect view to ascribe 

the unique embroideries and wondrous art to blind chance and unseeing coincidence. As 

al-Jisri  {[*]:  Husain  b.  Muhammad  b.  Mustafa  al-Jisr.  b.  Trablus  (Syria)  1261/1845  d. 

1327/1090. He graduated from al-Azhar 1284 H. His most famous work was translated into 

Turkish under the title Risale-i Hamidiyye.} has said, if a person who enters a palace filled 

with the embellished works of civilization does not see its owner, he will believe that it 

has  none  and  will  be  forced  to  ascribe  the  building  and  its  decorations  to  chance, 

coincidence, and the laws of natural selection. Moreover, when he ignores the testimony 

to  a  total  will,  all-encompassing  knowledge,  and  perfect  power  of  all  the  instances  of 

wisdom and uses and benefits in the order of the world and is heedless of them, it will 

appear  possible  to  him  -  since  he  sees  them  by  the  way  -  to  prove  the  actual  effect  of 

lifeless causes. 

 Now how about this! Disregard the subtleties of the Most High's art and study the 

most obvious of the works called "nature" and that is the visible manifestation (irtisâm) 

and reflection [of things], on condition you rend the veil of familiarity: how can your soul 

be  convinced  and  your  reason  accept  that  the  properties  of  the  face  of  a  mirror  can 

constitute an effective cause conducive to revealing the face of the skies and attracting 

[and reflecting] in its glass its image with its altitude and inscribed with stars? And how 

can  your  reason  be  persuaded  that  in  reality  the  imaginary  thing  called  gravity  is  an 

effective cause holding the earth and stars with their motions and rotations in firm order? 

  

In Short: If a person looks at something impossible and invalid superficially and by 

the way and does not see the true cause, he may deem it to be possible and valid. But if 

he  considers  such  a  thing  intentionally  and  for  itself,  and  studies  it  as  his  own,  it  is 

impossible that he should accept any of those matters that they drone on about in natural 

philosophy, unless he is so foolish as to suppose all minute particles possess the intelligence 

of the philosophers and the wisdom of the politicians! 

 

167

 -If you were to ask: What are nature and the laws and forces that they mutter about 

and try to console themselves with? 

 You would be told: Nature is a pattern, not a source; it is a printing-press, 

and not the printer; it is a code of laws, and not a power; it is the divine shari'a of creation 

which imposes an order on the acts of the limbs of the Manifest World's body. Just as the 

Shari'a is the product and summary of the rules governing voluntary acts, and the system 

of government is the sum of political principles; so the Shari'a and order are two theoretical 

matters that exist only in the mind; and so too nature is a theoretical matter that is the 

summary of Allâh's external practices in creation. The delusion of its external existence is 

like a savage imagining when he sees a military division performing disciplined drill that 

the  soldiers  are  tied  together  with  [physical  strings  that  have]  external  existence.  It  is 

people  with  the  consciences  of  savages,  therefore,  who  imagine  that  because  of  its 

continuance nature has effective external existence. 

In Short: Nature is the art of Allâh the Most High and the code of His creational laws. 

Its laws are the articles of the code, and its forces, the matters of the articles. 

 Now for the proof of divine unity (dalîl al-tawhîd), indicated by "worship! (u'budû)," 

that is, 'profess Allâh's unity' (wahhadû). According to the commentary of Ibn 'Abbas it is 

as follows: the Qur'an of Miraculous Exposition has omitted nothing from its proofs of divine 

unity. Sufficient evidence is the proof [called] burhan al-tamânu contained in the verse "If 

there had been in them [the heavens and earth] gods other than Allâh, they would have 

caused confusion in both;" (19:22) it is a shining beacon [proving] that independence is a 

necessary  essential  and  inherent  quality  of  the  Godhead.  This  verse  [also]  alludes  to  a 

subtle proof of divine unity which is [indicated by the following:] the co-operation of the 

heavens and earth and their relations in producing the products [to support] the livelihoods 

of mankind and the animals; the similarity of the works in the world, and all sides of it 

embracing each other, each taking the other by the hand so to complete the order; the 

mutual response of its different parts to each other's needs; all of it looking to a single 

point; and all being in regular motion on the axis of a single order. All this implies, indeed 

states clearly that the Maker of this single machine is One. So too it recites the lines: 

 In everything is a sign indicating that He is One. {[*]: The authorship of these lines 

is disputed: they are attributed to Ibn al-Mu'taz in Ibn Kathir, i, 24, and to Abu al-Atahhiyya 

 

168 

in Bayhaqi, Shu'ab al-îmân, i, 130-1. See, Nursi, Isârâtû'l-İ'caz [Abdûlmecid], 162. In Abu 

al-Atahhiyya's Diwan they are attributed to Imam 'Ali (ibn Abi Talib), see, Nursi, Ishârât al-

I'jâz [Ihsan Qasim], 154.} 

 

#169 

 Now consider this: the Maker is necessarily existent and one, so too He is qualified 

by  all  the  attributes  of  perfection.  For  whatever  the  traces  of  perfection  found  in  an 

artefact, they are derived from the shadow of the manifestation of its Maker's perfection. 

So  necessarily,  the  beauty,  perfection,  and  goodness  of  the  Maker  (May  His  glory  be 

exalted) must be of a degree infinitely higher than all the beauty, perfection, and goodness 

found in the universe. For beneficence (ihsân) is derived from the wealth of the Beneficent 

(al-Muhsin) and is evidence for it, and the giving of existence (îjâd) proves the existence 

(vujûd) of the Giver of existence (al-mûjid), and making necessary proves the existence of 

one who makes necessary, and making beautiful points to the beauty of one who makes 

beautiful.  Moreover,  the  Maker  is  exempt  from  all  defects,  for  defects  arise  from  the 

essential inability of material beings and the Most High is free of materiality. So too is He 

free of the attributes necessarily arising from the contingent essences of beings. Glory be 

to Him! There is none like unto Him, May His glory be exalted! He alludes to these two 

truths with His words: "Then set not up rivals to Allâh (fa-lâ taj'alû li'llâhi andâdan)." 

 Now  for  the  proof  of  contingency  (al-dalîl  al-imkânî),  which  is  alluded  to  by  the 

verse, "For God is indeed self-sufficient, whereas you stand in need [of Him]:" (47:38) you 

see that in respect of its essence and all its attributes and every one of its states and all 

its facets, every single atom in the universe [exists] hesitant and wavering amid endless 

possibilities. Then suddenly one springs to life, stands, and follows a specific path; it is 

clothed in particular attributes and assumes an orderly state and mounts an apposite law; 

it is turned to a fixed destination; then it yields wise results and benefits that could be 

obtained  only  in  that  determined  way.  Does  it  not  proclaim  in  its  particular  tongue  its 

Maker's intention and wisdom, enunciating them clearly? 

 Just as each particle singly is a proof, so its evidence multiplies as it becomes a part 

of ever-growing compounds one within the other. For it has a position in each compound, 

and  it  has  relations  in  each  position,  and  it  has  functions  resulting  from  each  of  the 

relations, and each of its functions bears the fruit of benefits and uses. In each degree it 

recites  with  its  tongue  proofs  of  the  necessary  existence  of  its  Maker.  It  resembles  a 

soldier, [who has relations and duties] in his platoon, his regiment, his division, and so on.

 Now  we  commence  with  the  positioning  and  word-order  (nazm)  of  the  above-

mentioned verse in respect of [firstly] the relationship (nazm) of the verse as a whole with 

what  preceded  it,  [secondly]  the  relationships  of  some  of  its  phrases,  and  [thirdly]  the 

relationships between the parts of the phrases. 

 The positioning of this verse and its relationship with what preceded it: 

 Having spelled out the categories of human beings; the pious believers charged with 

worship,  the  obdurate  disbelievers,  and  the  wavering  dissemblers,  the  Qur'an  now 

addresses  all  of  them  with  the  words:  "O  you  people!  worship..."  It  makes  this  the 

consequence of what preceded it in the same way that a building follows the plan, and 

commands  and  prohibitions  pertaining  to  actions  proceed  from  laws  [that  exist  as] 

knowledge,  and  the  divine  decree  (al-qadâ')  is  executed  in  accordance  with  divine 

determining  (al-qadar),  and  composition  and  creation  follow  on  after  the  story  and 

quotation.  {[*]:  These  latter  are  literary  terms,  referring  to  various  types  of  sentences. 

See,  Nursi,  Isârâtû'l-İ'caz [Bahaeddin Sağlam], 212.}  For when [the Qur'an] mentions the 

three different [groups] and describes their characteristics and outcomes, it is paving the 

way for the [main] subject and alerting the listeners]. Then it addresses [them] directly. 

This regard, I mean its referring to them firstly in the third person, then here addressing 

them directly, is a device (lit. point) generally [acceptable to the literary science of] al-

bayân. It is this: when either the virtues or vices of a person are mentioned by degrees, it 

alerts and excites [the listeners] and increases in [them] feelings of either admiration or 

disgust. These gradually grow stronger until they drive [the listeners] to speak in person to 

the  person  concerned.  Here,  as  required  by  the  context  (maqâm)  and  to  satisfy  those 

wishes of the listeners, the speaker (al-mutakallim - the Qur'an) fetches the person, brings 

him to their presence and addresses him directly. 

 This contains a point particular to this context, which is to alleviate the burdens of 

the obligation [of worship] with the pleasure of being addressed directly. 

 It indicates furthermore that in worship there are no intermediaries between the 

Creator and His bondsman. 

  

The relationships between the phrases: 

 The phrase "O you people! worship..." addresses all the people of every class of 

the three groups, of the past, present, and future: O genuine believers 

 

 

170 

#171 

who worship surely and regularly! O middling [worshippers], try to increase your worship! 

O  disbelievers,  perform  your  worship  and  all  it  entails  connected  to  belief  and  the 

affirmation of divine unity! And O dissemblers, worship with true sincerity! Thus, the word 

"worship" here is like a shared word expressing many meanings. So ponder over this! 

 "Your Sustainer and Lord (Rabbakum);" that is, worship Him for He is the lord who 

raises and sustains you! It is encumbent on you to be a bondsman who worships and serves 

Him. 

 A Short Note: 

 In "your Sustainer and Lord" is a subtle allusion to the contingency of the essences 

[of those addressed]; and in "has made the earth a resting-place for you" is a sign indicating 

the contingency of their attributes, and "who has created you and those who lived before 

you" hints at the createdness of their essences and attributes. Also, the following verses 

offer  clear  evidence  that  the  essences  of  those  addressed  are  contingent:  "For  Allâh  is 

indeed self-sufficient, whereas you stand in need [of Him];" (47:38) "That to your Lord is 

the final goal;" (53:42) "Now verily, these [false deities] are my enemies, [and that none 

is my helper] save the Lord and Sustainer of all the Worlds;" (26:77) "Say: Allâh [sent it 

down], then leave them to plunge in vain discourse and trifling "(6:91) "So flee unto Allâh" 

(51:50) "for verily in the remembrance of Allâh do [men's] hearts find their rest." (13:28) 

Now think of further examples in the same way! 

 As  for  the  phrase  "who  has  created  you  (alladhî  khalaqakum):"  know  that  when 

Allâh  the  Most  High  commands  worship,  which  necessitates  three  things:  firstly,  the 

existence of the object of worship (ma'bûd) secondly, His unity; and thirdly, His fitness to 

be worshipped, He replies to these three implied questions by indicating three evidences 

of them: the evidences of [His] existence, which are of two sorts: those in the outer world 

(âfâqî) and those in man's self (anfusî). The latter are also of two kinds: evidences in the 

self (nafsî) and those pertaining to origins (usûlî). [The Qur'an] alludes to evidences in the 

self  (nafsî),  which  are  the  nearest  and  most  evident,  with  the  phrase  "who  has  created 

you," and to those pertaining to man's origins with "and those [who lived] before you." 

 As for the positioning of "so that you might remain conscious of Him: (la'allakum 

tattaqûn)" know that since the Qur'an relates worship to [men's] creation and that of their 

forefathers, it necessitates two points: 

 The  First:  [Human  beings]  being  created  with  a  propensity  to  worship  and  their 

having the ability to be conscious of and fear Allâh (al-taqwâ), so [much so] that anyone 

who observes such an ability would expect worship 

 

171 

#172 

tearing at or grasping things. 

from  them.  Like  someone  who  sees  [an  animal's]  claws  understands  that  they  are  for 

 The Second: That the purpose of their creation, and the function with which they 

are charged and the perfection to which they are turned, is the fear of Allâh. This is the 

most complete and perfect worship. 

 That is to say, "so that you might remain conscious of Him;" that is, the aim of your 

creation, and your perfection, and that for which your innate disposition has been made, 

is the consciousness of Allâh and fear of Him. 

 Now for the phrase "has made the earth a resting-place for you (ja'ala la-kum al-

ard  firâshan):"  this  points  out  the  most  likely  evidences  of  the  Most  High's  existence 

furnished by the outer world. It is also an allusive rebuttal of the actual effectiveness of 

causes, which is the source of a sort of associating partners with Allâh (shirk); that is, its 

ascribing the spreading-out of the earth, or its preparation as man's cradle, to the Most 

High and not to nature. 

outer world. 

 The phrase "and the sky a canopy (wa al-sama binâ'an)" indicates by mentioning 

the sky, which is contiguous with the earth, the most elevated of the simple proofs in the 

 Then with the phrase "and has sent down water from the sky (wa anzala nûn al-

samâ')" [it indicates] the evidence of their Maker's existence [offered by] compound beings 

and things animal, vegetable, and mineral. 

 Moreover,  all  the  previous  phrases  point  to  proof  of  [the  Maker's]  existence. 

Similarly, as a whole they indicate His unity. And the way they are set out indicates the 

order [of the universe] and alludes to the bounties. With the evidence [offered by] "for 

your  sustenance  (rizqan  la-kum),"  it  establishes  the  fitness  of  the  Most  High  to  be 

worshipped, for it is compulsory to thank the bestower of bounties. "For your sustenance" 

also indicates that just as the earth and things animal, vegetable and mineral have been 

made to serve you, so you should serve the One who subjugated them to you. 

 Now the positioning [and relationships] of "then set not up rivals to Allâh (fa-lâ 

taj'alû li'llâhi andâdan):" know that extending from its position are lines to "O you people! 

worship your Sustainer and Lord;" and to "who has created you;" and to "who has made... 

for you;" and to "and has sent down." That is, when you worship your Lord, associate no 

partners with Him, for it is He who is the Lord and Sustainer, and is your Creator and the 

Creator of the human race; do not set up lords and masters in derogation of Allâh; and 

 

172 

because  it  was  He  who  created  the  heavens  and  made  them  the  roof  to  your  dwelling-

place, so do not believe that natural causes 

 

#173 

have an actual effect, which is the source of idolatry; and because it is He who sends down 

rain to the earth for your food and livelihoods. There is no bounty but His, so thanks and 

worship are due to Him alone. 

 The positioning and relationships of the parts of the phrases: 

 Consider  this:  the  interjection  [introductory  to  the  vocative]  "Yâ  ayyuhâ"  in  the 

phrase "Yâ ayyuhâ al-nâs ubudû - O you people! Worship" appears frequently in the Qur'an 

since  it  contains  [a  number  of]  fine  points.  Here  the  address  is  corroborated  in  three 

respects: by the "yâ - O" which is to arouse; by the "ayyû," [the purpose of] which is to 

distinguish; and by the "-hâ" [the purpose of] which is to alert. For the address here alludes 

to  three  benefits:  the  replacing  of  the  hardship  of  the  obligation  [of  worship]  with  the 

pleasure of [being] address[ed], and [informing that] the only means of man's progress from 

the depths of absence to the [high] station of presence is worship. It indicates too that 

those addressed are charged in three respects: in respect of their hearts, with submission 

and obedience; in respect of their intellects, with belief and affirming divine unity; and 

physically, through action and worship. 

 [The address] infers too that those addressed consist of three groups [the believers, 

the unbelievers, and the dissemblers]. It hints too at the three classes of the elite, the 

middle class, and the mass of the people. It betokens too the familiar manner and order 

of  things,  which  is  that  a  person  first  of  all  calls  out  to  a  person  to  stop  him,  then  he 

recognizes  his  features  and  turns  to  him,  then  he  addresses  him  and  gets  him  to  do 

something. 

 In Short: the above subtle points [in the use of the vocative case] corroborate and 

reinforce the address [by] establishing the mentioned aspects [and meanings]. 

 Concerning  the  interjection  "yâ  -  O!"  since  it  is  addressing  the  people  and  they 

consist of various classes including the heedless, the absent, the idle, the ignorant, and so 

forth, it both arouses the heedless, and summons the absent, and calls the idle to action, 

and informs the ignorant, and arrests the busy, and gives direction to those who turn away, 

and excites the lovers, and encourages the seekers, and urges the perfected to increase 

[their worship], and it also gives people a jolt. 

 

173 

The  distance  [inferred]  by  the  "yâ  -  O!,"  although  the  context  (maqâm)  is  one  of 

propinquity [and worship], indicates the grandeur and sublimity of the obligation and its 

trust (amana al-taklîf). 

 It alludes too to the distance from when and where the address appeared, of the 

times and places of those on whom the obligation has been laid. 

 

#174 

 So too it is an allusion to the depths of mankind's heedlessness. 

 As for the "ayyu," it is used to single out [a person or a group] from the mass and 

infers that all the universe is being addressed, and humankind is specified since men bear 

the  trust  in  the  form  of  "fard  kifâya"  [that  is,  it  is  human  beings  that  are  charged  with 

performing worship]. So if they are lax [in doing this], they transgress against the rights of 

all [other] beings. 

 Also,  in  "ayyu"  is  an  eloquent  subtlety  in  that  its  conciseness  is  followed  by  the 

descriptive "people (al-nâs)." Then the "hâ" being a substitute for the second part of the 

genitive  construction  indicates  that  [its  purpose]  is  to  alert  those  summoned  with  the 

vocative interjection "yâ - O!" 

 " People (al-nâs)" being an active participle derived from [the verbal noun] nisyân, 

meaning forgetfulness, it indicates censure or reproof. That is, "O you people! How can 

you forget the pre-eternal covenant (al-mithâq al-azalî)? It indicates too an excuse; that 

is: "O you people! Your neglect can be due only to a mistake or forgetfulness; it can't be 

deliberate or serious!" 

 As  for  "worship!  (u'budû)"  since  it  is  the  conclusion  (or  apodosis)  of  the  general 

summons  to  all  the  classes  [of  people]  mentioned  above,  it  points  to  obedience,  and 

indicates sincerity, and hints at continuance, and alludes to divine unity. That is, obey! Be 

sincere and constant [in worship]! Increase [your worship]! Profess the divine unity! 

 "Your  Lord  and  Sustainer  (rabbakum)"  indicates  that  just  as  worship  should  be 

desired and sought since it is an elevated relation, an illustrious connection; it should be 

sought too since it is [a way of] serving and offering thanks to the One who nurtures and 

raises you, of whom you are in need. 

 Now for the parts of the phrase: "who created you and those [who lived] before 

you (alladhî khalaqakum wa alladhîna min qablikum):" 

 As a relative pronoun, "who (alladhî)" is known only in so far as it is qualified by the 

relative clause. [For instance, all that is known about "the one who went" is that he has 

gone.] Thus, [here "Lord and Sustainer" being governed by "who"] it infers that knowledge 

 

174 

of Allâh the Most High can only be in respect of His actions and works, and not His essence. 

{[*]: See, Nursi, İsârâtûl-İ'caz [Abdûlmecid], 169.} 

 Then by virtue of its signifying determined, regular creation rather than the [mere] 

giving  of  existence  (îjâd)  or  giving  rise  to  (inshâ'),  "created  (khalaqa)"  indicates  that  by 

nature  the  human  being  is  turned  toward  the  obligation  [of  worship].  It  infers  too  that 

worship is a duty, for it is the 

 

#175 

result and 'wage' of creation. But [this wage is not the reward for worship;] the reward is 

purely a favour of Allâh the Most High. 

 Because of the uncertainty of [who or what is governed by] "those [who] (alladhîna)" 

it is as though hinting: "Nothing is now known of those who came before you and have died 

and departed. You are tottering on the brink of the grave, so take a lesson and don't be 

deceived by this world. Be steadfast in worship, the means to everlasting happiness." 

 Concerning  "so  that  you  might  remain  conscious  of  Him  (la'allakum  tattaqûn);" 

"la'alla " signifies hope, and when it precedes something desirable it is used to increase 

eagerness, and when it precedes something repugnant, its function is to put [the listener] 

on his guard. Here, the hope cannot refer literally to the Speaker [that is, to Allâh], so it 

is either metaphorical, or refers either to the addressee or to observers or listeners. 

 If it refers to the Speaker, it is an allegorical metaphor (isti'âra tamthîliyya). [For 

instance,] if one equips a person with the gear for a job, one hopes and expects that he 

will  do  it.  In  the  same  way,  Allâh  has  decked  out  humanity  with  the  potentiality  to  be 

perfected, and the capacity [to perform the religious] obligations, and the means of will. 

 The metaphor indicates too that the purpose (hikma) of man's creation is fear of 

Allâh and consciousness of Him (taqwâ). It also infers that worship results in the degree 

(al-martaba) of fear of Allâh. So too it is a sign that the fear of Allâh is the highest degree. 

 Moreover,  in  the  style  of  kings,  the  metaphor  suggests  encouragement  and  the 

holding out of hopes and [the making of] certain promises. 

 If [the hope signified by la'alla] refers to those addressed, it is as though saying: 

"Worship seeking [to aspire to] the fear of Allâh, between fear and hope." This implies that 

man should not feel confident about his worship. It suggests too that he should not suffice 

with his [present degree of worship], but should confirm the saying "it is incumbent on you 

to act without cease" and look beyond the degree at which he is found [and aspire to more]. 

 And if [the hope signified by la'alla] refers to observers and listeners, it is as though 

whoever observes human beings equipped with such abilities and potentialities will hope 

 

175 

and expect worship from them - just as a person who sees the claws and fangs of a predator 

will  expect  it  to  be  rapacious.  It  indicates  too  that  worship  is  required  by  man's  inborn 

 Since the fear of Allâh results from the worship of all the classes [of men] mentioned 

previously, the words "they may fear Allâh (tattaqûn)" allude to all [types and] levels of 

taqwâ. That is, taqwâ [preventing] the 

nature. 

 

#176 

association of partners with Allâh (shirk), taqwâ [preventing the committing of] grievous 

sins, taqwâ [causing one] to preserve one's heart from [attachment to] things other than 

Allâh the Most High, and taqwâ [causing one] to avoid [things leading to] punishment, and 

taqwâ [causing one] to restrain oneself from anger. It is also a hint that [true] worship is 

that which is [performed] with sincerity. And it indicates that worship should be the sole 

aim, and not a means, and suggests too that worship should not be [performed in the hope 

of] reward or [to avoid] punishment. 

 Now the elements of the phrase "Who has made the earth a restingplace for you 

and the sky a canopy (alladhî ja'ala la-kum al-arda firâshan wa al-samâ' bina'an):" 

 Consider this: by describing the vastness of the Maker's power, this indicates that it 

is spurring [the people] on to worship, and by mentioning His favours encouraging [them]. 

It  is  as  though  saying:  "O  man!  The  One  who  subjugates  the  earth  and  heavens  to  you 

deserves your worship." 

 It also indicates man's virtue and his high worth and his nobility in Allâh's sight, as 

though saying: "You should show through worshipping the One who has ennobled you by 

making the heavenly and lowly bodies [in such a way] that you might benefit from them 

despite their vastness, that you are worthy of His favour." 

 Moreover,  it  is  a  hint  rebutting  chance,  coincidence,  and  the  [actual]  effect  of 

nature. That is: "All the attributes you see [in nature exist] through the making of a Maker, 

the intention of an Intender, the specification of a Specifier, and the order of an Orderer. 

How sublime is His wisdom!" 

 So too it infers rebuttal of the Naturalists' school, and that of the Sabeans, which 

gave rise to the school of idolators (al-wathanîîn). 

 Furthermore,  it  draws  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  attributes  of  bodies  point 

through their contingency to the Maker. For their atoms are equal in that they can assume 

[an infinite number of] general states and modes, and all contingent attributes are hesitant 

amid a great many possibilities. So in respect of their attributes and states all [physical] 

 

176 

bodies are in need of intention, purpose or wisdom, and the specifying of one to specify 

 As  for  the  precedence  of  "for  you  (la-kum),"  it  indicates  that  the  earth  has  been 

spread out for man; as though it is only man who benefits from it, and the rest [in this 

respect] are superfluous. Ponder over this carefully! 

 "A resting-place (firâshan)" indicates a fine point of eloquence which is the strange 

fact that although the earth's nature requires that it should have been submerged in water, 

[it was not] and this implies that it was spread 

[these]. 

 

#177 

out  contrarily  to  its  nature.  For  according  to  this,  the  water  should  have  overrun  the 

[whole] globe. But in His wisdom and mercy, the Maker drew out a part of it and spread it 

out and laid on it the table of His bounties. 

 Similarly, in accordance with the rule "If a thing is proved, it is proven together with 

the  things  it  necessitates,"  the  word  "resting-place"  [derived  from  the  verb  farasha  to 

spread out] indicates that the earth is like the carpeted floor of a house, and the species 

of  plants  and  animals  it  contains  like  its  furniture,  placed  in  it  intentionally  and 

purposively. 

 It  suggests  also  that  intentionally  and  purposively  [the  state  of]  the  earth  is  a 

middling one; it is neither so liquid that it cannot be walked upon, nor is it so hard that it 

cannot be utilized or tilled. For if it had been thus it would have been useless even if made 

of gold. Its intermediate [state] therefore indicates that it has been specified, made, and 

intended by one [who acts] with wisdom and purpose. 

 "And the sky a canopy (wa al-samâ binâ'an)" indicates this, that when the Most High 

made the heavens a canopy and roof for you, its stars became your lamps, so don't imagine 

that chance [has any part] in their dispersal, as you might imagine it does if you scatter 

some jewels on the ground. 

precious mystery, which is as follows: 

 In this verse is the hint, the suggestion, the intimation of a wondrously subtle and 

 If you were to ask: Man is a mere atom in relation to the earth, and the earth is an 

atom in relation to the universe. Similarly, a human individual is an atom relatively to the 

human race, and the human race is an atom compared with its partners in benefiting from 

this lofty home. Moreover, the extent to which mankind utilizes the house's advantages 

and aims is [only] an atom's [worth]. And its aims that the human intellect can perceive 

are  a  [mere]  atom  in  relation  to  the  uses  [existent]  in  pre-eternal  wisdom  and  divine 

 

177 

knowledge. So how is it that [the Most High] created the earth for humankind and made 

man's utilizing it its ultimate aim? 

 You would be told: Yes, that's right, but despite all that, on account of the breadth 

of man's spirit and the expanse of his intellect and extent of his abilities, and the many, 

far-flung  ways  in  which  he  utilizes  the  universe;  and  because  of  the  absence  of 

overcrowding  and  fragmentation  and  resistance  in  respect  of  its  utilization,  like  the 

relation of the whole with its parts - for the whole is present in its entirety in all its parts 

and there is therefore no crowding and no fragmentation; the Qur'an made man's utilization 

the ultimate aim although it is only one out of the myriad aims of the heavens 

 

#178 

and  earth,  and  that  is  how  it  appears  to  man.  That  is,  man  benefits  from  the  earth  as 

though it were the courtyard of his house and the heavens were his roof. The stars are 

lamps for him and the plants, his food, so each [person] has the right to say: "My sun, my 

skies, my earth." Now think about this together with your reasoning faculty! 

 Now for the particulars of "and has sent down water from the sky and thereby 

brought forth fruits for your sustenance (wa anzala min al-samâ mâ'an fa-akhraja bi-hi 

min al-thamarâti rizqan la-kum):" 

 Consider this: the [implied] pronoun in "has sent down (anzala)" [referring to Allâh] 

indicates that the raindrops are sent down with an intentional balance and with wisdom 

[and purpose]. In fact, each droplet is encompassed by a particular order, as is suggested 

by  none  of  them  ever  colliding  with  its  brothers  during  its  long  descent  despite  the 

buffeting of the air. This announces that the raindrops are not left to their own devices, 

but that the reins of each are held by an angel representing the order and reflecting it. 

 The use of the noun in "from the sky (min al-samâ')" although a pronoun would have 

been in place [since it is repetition], infers that what is intended is the direction of the 

sky, not from the sky itself (cirmahâ). 

 The  use  of  the  word  "water  (mâ'an)"  although  what  falls  is  snow,  hail,  and  rain, 

indicates that water is the source nearest and most useful. Indeed, "And [that] We made 

out  of  water  every  living  being."  (21:30)  While  its  being  indefinite  suggests  that  it  has 

wondrous properties and a strange structure and that its chemical compound is unknown 

to you. 

 

 The conjunction "fa-" in "fa-akhraja - has thereby brought forth" is so positioned as 

to follow on without break, but there is a [considerable] delay between the falling of the 

rain and the bringing forth of the fruits. This implies such [missing] sentences as "... the 

178 

earth trembled and swelled, then grew green and produced every sort of plant in pairs, 

and has thereby brought forth." As for the [implied] pronoun of "has brought forth" [which 

refers to Allâh], it indicates that the fruits are not brought forth through mere reproduction 

or compounded substances, but that the All-Wise Maker creates and raises them through 

attributes and characteristics not present in their physical matter. 

 "[With  it]  (bi-hi):"  since  the  true  meaning  of  [this  preposition  of  instrument 

qualifying "water"], that is, to affix or bring close (ilsâq), has absorbed [the meaning of] 

causality, it indicates the luscious freshness of the fruits. For contrary to its nature, the 

water rises to them and fills their goblets at close quarters. 

 

#179 

 "[Some] fruits (min al-thamarât):" according to Sibawayh, since [the partitive] "min 

[some]" does not entirely lack the meaning of a subject [it cannot be the object of "has 

brought forth,"] and this indicates that the object will vary according to the understanding 

of the listeners]; that is, "such various fruits as you feel appetite for." 

 As for the 'nunation' (indefiniteness) of "sustenance (rizqan)," it indicates that the 

causes by which you obtain this sustenance are unknown to you, for it comes to you from 

where you would not expect. 

 And  "for  your  (lit.  you)  (la-kum)"  is  a  hint  strengthening  the  meaning  of  gracious 

bestowal. It infers too that the sustenance is for you, but there is no harm if others profit 

from it after you. Also it implies that the Most High has singled you out for His bounties, 

so you should offer thanks to Him alone. 

Allâh (fa-lâ taj'alû li'ilâhi andâdan):" 

 The  positioning  [and  relationships]  of  the  parts  of  "then  set  not  up  as  rivals  to 

 The "fa- (then or so)" [of "fa-la"] looks to the four sections [above]: that is, He is the 

true Object of Worship, so associate none other with Him; He is absolutely Omnipotent and 

the  heavens  and  earth  are  in  the  grasp  of  His  power,  so  don't  believe  that  He  has  any 

partners; He is the Bestower of [all] bounties so offer your thanks to none but He; and He 

is your Creator, so don't imagine that He has any partners. 

 The use of "set up (taj'alû)" instead of 'believe' (ta'taqidû) indicates the meaning of 

the  verse  "These  [allegedly  divine  beings]  are  nothing  but  empty  names  you  have 

invented."  (53:23)  That  is,  meaningless  names  you  imagine  exist  and  are  of  your  own 

making. 

 

179 

 The  precedence  of  "to  Allâh  (li-llâh):"  by  drawing  immediate  attention  to  [Allâh] 

shows on the one hand the necessity of [remembering Him]; while on the other it infers 

that the reason for the prohibition is the fact that partners are associated with Him. 

 "Rivals (andâd):" [the singular] "nidd" has the meaning of like, equal, or peer, and 

anything 'like' the Most High will be His exact opposite; between them will be contrariety. 

In this is a subtle hint that the [term] rival or equal is essentially futile. Then the use of 

the  plural  indicates  the  utter  ignorance  of  those  who  associate  partners  with  Allâh  (al-

mushrikîn), and infers derision of them: "How can you ascribe to Allâh, who is without like, 

hordes of equals and opposites?" 

 It also infers the rejection of all sorts of partners; partners in His essence, in His 

attributes, and His actions. It intimates too rebuttal of every type of 

associator of partners with Allâh: the pagans (al-wathaniûn), the Sabeans, the Christians 

(ahl al-tathlîth), and the Naturalists, all of whom believe that causes have an actual effect. 

 Note: the source of paganism or idolatry is either the deification of the stars or the 

indwelling or incarnation of Allâh. 

"Now that you know (wa antum ta'lamûn):" like similar concluding phrases of verses 

(fawâsil), this indicates that the source of Islam is knowledge (al-'ilm) and its basis is reason 

(al-'aql), and that it accepts the truth and rejects sophistry and delusion. 

 Moreover, through its conciseness in attaching no object to the verb "know," [the 

Qur'an] prolongs the speech. That is, "You know now that other than Him there is no true 

object of worship and no creator or possessor of absolute power or bestower of bounties. 

And you know too that all gods and idols are nothing and are incapable of doing anything. 

They are all created, mere inventions you have fancied." You should give this due thought!

An Introduction Verifying Prophethood 

 Consider this: just as the previous verse proves the first of the four main aims of the 

Qur'an,  and  that  is  divine  unity  (al-tawhîd),  so  this  one  (2:23)  proves  the  second,  the 

prophethood of Muhammad (Upon whom be blessings and peace), {[*]: In fact, the second 

aim of the Qur'an is prophethood generally. But Muhammad's prophethood may be said to 

be thus since it was universal and included the essence of the previous prophets' teachings. 

See,  Nursi,  İşârâtü'l-İ'caz  [Abdülmecid],  177.}  through  the  most  consummate  of  his 

miracles,  which  was  his  challenging  [opponents]  with  the  Qur'an's  miraculousness  and 

inimitability (i'jâz). We have set out evidences of his prophethood in detail in another book 

{[*]: Nursi, Muhâkemat, 121 ff. See also, Nursi, Letters, 236-46; 257-63.} and a part of them 

is summarized here in six topics. {[*]: If fact, there are seven 'Topics.'} 

181 

ٰ
#182 

 The First Matter 

 It  may  be  concluded  from  the  circumstances  of  the  prophets,  through  inductive 

reasoning (al-istiqrâ' al-tâmm) and the analogy known as 'hidden' (al-qiyâs al-khafî), [based 

on]  the  unvarying  order  [in  similar  things],  that  the  pivot  and  basis  of  the  prophets' 

missions,  and  their  dealings  with  their  communities  were  found  most  perfectly  and 

completely  in  Muhammad,  Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace,  who  was  the  master  of 

mankind at the time of its maturity. This furnishes the best possible argument and proof 

that he was also the Messenger of Allâh. For through the tongues of their miracles all the 

prophets as though testified to Muhammad's truthfulness (Upon whom be peace), who was 

a luminous proof of the Maker's existence and unity. Now reflect on this! 

 

 The Second Matter 

 Consider this, that although they were not necessarily wondrous, all Muhammad's 

(Upon whom be peace) conduct and actions pointed initially to his truthfulness and finally 

to his justice and fairness. Do you not see how he acted in situations similar to the incident 

of  the  cave  when  there  was  no  hope  of  aid:  he  declared  with  complete  certainty, 

confidence, and earnestness: "Grieve not; verily, Allâh is with us!" (9:40) Thus, his conduct 

at the start [of his mission] - his unconcern in the face of opponents, and his lack of fear 

and hesitation, and complete confidence - indicates that he adhered to the truth. Then his 

establishing at the end - the rules essential for attaining happiness in this world and the 

next - and the Tightness of his actions and his adhering to the truth are all evidence for his 

justice and fairness. This was true for each of his actions. But if you take a look at all he 

did and all his conduct there will appear before your eyes a proof of his prophethood as 

brilliant as lightning. So reflect on this! 

 The Third Matter 

 Understand that the past and the present - that is, the Era of Bliss [the time of the 

Prophet] - and the future are united in affirming his prophethood, just as his own self was 

evidence for it. We should now study the following four pages. Firstly we seek blessings by 

studying his self, first of all by calling to mind four points: 

 Firstly: Even if they are of the highest standard, artificial and man-made things can 

never be equal to what is natural and 'real' or take their place. The slips and blunders of 

artificiality will surely show up the imposture. 

 

 

 

182 

#183 

 Secondly: The only thing that fixes high morals in the ground of reality is seriousness, 

and  the  only  thing  that  perpetuates  them  in  their  totality  is  truthfulness  (sidq).  If 

truthfulness departs from their midst they become as straw winnowed by the wind. 

 Thirdly: Just as attraction and [mutual] inclination are present in things that are 

harmonious and congruent; so contradictory and opposing things give rise to repulsion and 

mutual disgust. 

 Fourthly is [the rule] "there is in the whole what is not present in the parts," like a 

rope being strong though its strands are weak. 

 If you have grasped these points, understand now that as was acknowledged by his 

enemies, Muhammad's (UWBP) works, and the course and story of his life, all testify that 

he had the finest character and that combined in him were all the highest moral qualities. 

Such a combination is marked by personal dignity, gravity, and self-respect, and these do 

not permit a person to stoop to trivial inanities. Just as the angels do not permit devils to 

mix with them, so in no way when they come together do these elevated morals permit 

trickery and falsehood to enter amongst them. Have you not observed that someone famous 

only for bravery does not stoop to lying, except if forced? So how could a person in whom 

all  [those  qualities  are  present]?  Thus,  it  is  established  that  [the  Prophet's]  own  person 

(UWBP) furnished evidence for himself as clear as the sun. 

 Moreover, if you study his conduct (Upon whom be peace) from the age of four till 

forty, you will see that although this is the period of youth when the natural passions are 

rampant and hidden traits and any latent slyness or trickery in a person's character come 

to light, he lived these years in complete righteousness, constancy, and chastity, and in 

regular and orderly fashion. There was no hint of trickery in any of his conduct; not even 

the obdurate and clever [enemies] he was faced with [observed any wiles in him]. And then 

you  see  him  when  he  is  forty  years  old,  when  the  character  becomes  fixed  and  habits 

ingrained, and he emerges as a marvel who brings about a mighty unprecedented revolution 

in the world. This could have occurred only through Allâh's [will]. 

The Fourth Matter 

 Know  that  the  page  of  the  past,  which  contains  the  stories  of  the  prophets, 

recounted  [by  the  Prophet]  (Upon  whom  be  peace)  in  the  Qur'an,  is  a  proof  of  his 

prophethood. This [page comprises] four points: 

  

 

 

 

183 

#184 

The  First:  If  a  person  grasps  the  basic  principles  of  a  science  and  recognizes  its 

essential usefulness and employs its proficiently where he should, and constructs his cause 

on it, this is evidence of his skill and expertise in that science. 

 The Second Point: If you are cognizant of human nature [you know that] you will 

never see a person being so bold as to oppose [the majority] without hesitation or concern 

or constraint, or to lie even if insignificantly, among a people even if they are few, for a 

cause even if lowly, with dignity even if small. So how could someone - with the utmost 

dignity, for a cause of the utmost gravity, among people who were extremely numerous, 

in  the  face  of  extreme  obstinacy  despite  his  being  unlettered  -  how  could  he  speak  of 

matters unattainable by reason alone and disclose them with the greatest seriousness and 

proclaim them over the heads of witnesses? Does this not point to his truthfulness, and 

that [what he proclaimed] was not from him but from Allâh? 

 The Third: There are many sciences that for the civilized are axiomatic and teach 

customs,  events,  situations,  and  actions,  but  that  are  unknown  and  theoretical  to 

[primitive]  nomads.  So  if  someone  wants  to  interrogate  [them]  and  investigate  their 

circumstances, especially in past centuries, he has to imagine himself among them in those 

deserts. 

 The Fourth: This is that if a person debates with experts in a science, even if it is 

only grammar, and propounds his views concerning the matters it entails, corroborating 

what is agreed upon and correcting points of dispute, would this not demonstrate to you 

his superiority and that his knowledge is God-given (wahbî)? 

 If  you  have  understood  these  points,  understand  now  that  despite  his  being 

unlettered,  Muhammad  the  Arabian  (Upon  whom  be  peace)  recounts  to  us  through  the 

tongue of the Qur'an the stories of the prophets and early times as though he had been 

present and witnessed them. He describes their exploits and divulges their secrets to all 

the world in the way of a mighty cause that has attracted the attention of intelligent men. 

He  recounts  these  without  concern.  For  he  took  their  vital  points  and  fundamental 

principles as the basis of his own cause, confirming matters unanimously endorsed by the 

previous  scriptures  and  correcting  matters  of  difference.  As  though  with  a  fleet  spirit 

reflecting  divine  revelation  he  traversed  time  and  space  and  entered  the  depths  of  the 

past, then proclaimed [what was there] as though he had witnessed it. Thus, his doing this 

is a proof of his prophethood and one of his miracles. All the evidences of the prophethoods 

of the previous 

 

 

184 

prophets  are  in  effect  evidence  for  his  prophethood,  and  all  their  miracles  are  in 

#185 

  

effect a miracle of his. 

The Fifth Matter 

 This elucidates the page of the Age of Bliss, especially the question of the Arabian 

Peninsula. It also consists of four points: 

 The First: If you study the world you will see that to extirpate customs and habits is 

difficult in the extreme even if they are unimportant, or characteristics even if they are 

insignificant, among people even if few, or a group even if wretched, for a king even if he 

is powerful with resolution even if great, over a long time and expending much effort. So 

how  about  a  person  who  is  not  a  ruler  yet  succeeded  in  a  short  time  with  little  effort 

proportionately to what was achieved, in extirpating customs and morals that were totally 

ingrained and had been practised since time immemorial, and in their place planting morals 

and  habits  in  the  hearts  of  a  people  who  were  exceedingly  numerous  and  were  utterly 

attached to and bigoted in their customs? Wouldn't you look on him as a wonder and marvel? 

 The Second Point: A state or government is a corporate body (shakhs ma'nawî); it 

takes form gradually like a growing child. And its conquest of former states, whose laws 

have become a very part of their people's natures, takes time. So wasn't it extraordinary 

that Muhammad (Upon whom be peace) founded a mighty state [almost] instantaneously, 

equipped  to  progress  to  the  highest  degree,  comprising  eternal,  lofty  fundamental 

principles, and which conquered powerful states at once, and perpetuated its rule not only 

outwardly and physically but also inwardly and spiritually? 

 The  Third  Point:  It  is  possible  to  dominate  outwardly  and  superficially  through 

compulsion and force, but to conquer minds and affect spirits by instilling in them one's 

refinement,  and  to  hold  sway  over  people's  dispositions  while  perpetuating  one's 

domination  of  their  consciences  must  surely  be  extraordinary;  it  can  only  be  the 

outstanding characteristic of prophethood. 

 The Fourth Point: To direct and guide public opinion by means of the subterfuges of 

intimidation  and  enticement,  and  fear  and  threat,  has  only  a  partial,  superficial,  and 

temporary  effect  and  in  time  blocks  up  the  path  to  rational  thinking.  So  if  a  person 

penetrates  to  the  very  depths  of  people's  hearts  with  his  guidance,  excites  their  finest 

emotions, reveals their potentialities, awakens their highest morals, discloses their hidden 

talents, makes the essence of their humanity well forth, and makes manifest their value 

as 

 

185 

#186 

rational  beings,  all  these  acts  of  his  can  only  be  the  very  rays  of  reality,  and  indeed 

extraordinary.  You  see  a  person  so  hard-hearted  he  buries  his  daughter  alive  without 

compunction  or  sorrow,  then  when  you  see  him  again  one  day  later,  having  become  a 

Muslim,  he  [refrains  from  stepping  on]  an  ant  since  he  pities  it  and  feels  the  creature's 

pain. Can you ascribe such a revolution of the emotions to any law? Tell me, for God's sake! 

 If you have understood these points, reflect on another. It is this: 

 The  history  of  the  world  testifies  that  unique  geniuses  are  those  men  who  are 

capable of developing the innate talents of all the people, and revealing their particular 

traits, and arousing their emotions, for if he does not arouse those dormant emotions, his 

efforts will all be in vain, or temporary, no matter how illustrious he is in himself. 

 History also shows us that even the greatest people are successful at arousing only 

a  few  of  those  general  emotions,  like  the  feeling  of  patriotism,  and  the  sense  of 

brotherhood, and feelings of love, and the desire for freedom, and so on. Is it therefore 

not a wonder and extraordinary to arouse thousands of such emotions, latent and elevated, 

and make them burst forth and unfold in a nomadic people scattered through the endless 

deserts of Arabia? Indeed it is so! It is a light from the sun of reality. Anyone who has not 

got this point into his head, we shall thrust the Arabian Peninsula into his mind's eye! And 

now it is after thirteen centuries and after mankind has climbed the rungs of civilization 

and progress. So, O obdurate one! Pick a hundred eminent philosophers and let them strive 

for a hundred years and see if they can do one hundredth of what Muhammad the Arabian 

(UWBP) did in his time. And if they cannot, and they will not be able to, you should beware 

of what happens to the obdurate! For his achievement was indeed extraordinary and was 

only one of his [many] miracles (Upon whom be blessings and peace). 

 You  should  understand  too  that  a  person  who  wants  to  succeed  has  to  [act]  in 

accordance with the divine laws ('âdât Allâh), be knowledgeable of the natural laws, and 

conform to social relations, otherwise the innate disposition of things (al-fitra) will respond 

to  him  by  denying  him  success  and  will  confound  him.  Also,  a  person  who  follows  a 

[particular] way in society should not oppose the general current, otherwise it will work 

against him rather than for him. Consequently, if a person is aided by success within the 

general current, as was Muhammad (Upon whom be peace), it is proved that he adhered 

 If you have understood this, consider the truths of the Shari'a: you will 

to the truth. 

 

 

 

186 

#187 

see that despite all the momentous clashes and revolutions down the long centuries, they 

have preserved the balance of the natural laws and social relations, which because of their 

minuteness are not apparent to people's minds (al-'uqûl) although they are completely in 

conformity and harmony with them. The more time passes, the more their interconnection 

becomes clear. It is plain from this that Islam is the natural religion for humankind and 

that it is truth (haqq). For this reason it can never cease or diminish. Don't you see that 

the healing antidote for the fatal poison in society is the proscription of interest and usury 

(ribâ) and the obligatory payment of the purification tax (zakât)? And these are only two 

of the thousands of matters of the Shari'a. 

 Now, if you have grasped the above four points and three points that follow them, 

know too that although Muhammad al-Hashimi (UWBP) was unlettered and could neither 

read  nor  write,  and  had  no  outward  power  and  no  sovereignty,  and  neither  did  his 

forefathers, and although he had no desire for domination and rule, with all his heart and 

confidence and assurance in a position of the gravest danger and importance, he undertook 

a matter of supreme gravity and conquered minds and became the beloved of spirits, and 

dominated dispositions, and uprooted from the depths of their hearts their many habitual 

entrenched familiar savage practices and customs. He then planted in their place with the 

utmost firmness, as though fusing with their very flesh and blood, elevated morals and fine 

customs.  He  replaced  the  hard-heartedness  of  a  people  degenerated  in  the  far-flung 

corners of barbarity, with fine sensitivities and he disclosed the jewel of their humanity. 

He took them out of their barbarity and raised them to the peak of civilization and made 

them teachers of the world of their time. For them he founded a state that swallowed up 

[other] states like Moses' staff. It appeared like a brilliant flaming light that burnt up the 

[social]  ties  of  tyranny  and  corruption,  and  in  a  short  time  established  the  seat  of  that 

state [which extended over] East and West. Doesn't this situation prove that his way was 

truth and reality, and that he was truthful in what he was claiming? 

The Sixth Matter 

 This is about the page of the future, and especially the question of the Shari'a. Four 

points have to be considered in this matter: 

 The First: Even if he is exceptional, one person can become expert and proficient 

in only four or five sciences. 

  

 

 

 

187 

#188 

The Second Point: The same speech differs according to who says it, so just as it may 

point  to  the  superficiality  and  ignorance  of  one  person,  it  may  indicate  the  skill  and 

proficiency of another - although the words are the same. For one of them looks to the 

source and conclusion of what he says, and its context and what precedes it; he thinks of 

it in relation to its brothers [the other things said] and places it appropriately. He employs 

it most aptly and seeks out fertile ground in which to sow it. It is clear from this that he is 

a  singular  [speaker]  and  has  mastered  the  subject  about  which  he  is  speaking.  All  the 

concluding phrases of Qur'anic verses related to the sciences and what they have gleaned, 

are of the above sort. 

 The Third Point: Due to the perfecting of ways and means, many things that are now 

commonplace and even toys for children, two centuries ago were considered marvels. So 

whatever preserves its youth, freshness, and novelty over these long centuries must surely 

be extraordinary and unique. 

 The  Fourth  Point:  Guidance  is  beneficial  only  when  commensurate  with  the 

intellectual capacity of the majority of the people. And the great majority are common 

people, and the common people are not capable of contemplating the sheer truth; they 

are accustoming to seeing it clothed only in the dress of their familiar imaginings. Because 

of this, the Qur'an depicts such truths in allegorical form (mutashâbihât), with metaphors 

(isti'âra) and similes (tashbîh), and it protects the mass of people, who have not advanced, 

from  falling  into  the  abyss  of  error.  Thus,  it  is  vague  and  obscure  in  matters  that  they 

necessarily believe to be contrary to actuality due to their superficial emotional view (bi'l-

hiss al-zâhirî), yet it still makes allusion to and indicates the truth. 

 If you have grasped these points, now consider this: the Islamic religion and Shari'a 

are founded on rational proof, and are the sum and substance of the branches of knowledge 

that comprise the vital essence of all the basic sciences: the science of refining the spirit, 

and of training the heart, and of educating the conscience, and the science of physical 

training,  and  domestic  science,  and  the  science  of  local  government,  and  that  of 

international relations, and the legal sciences, and the science of human relations, and 

that  of  social  behaviour,  and  so  on  and  so  forth.  Moreover,  the  Shari'a  explains  and 

elucidates  where  is  necessary  or  needed,  and  is  concise  where  this  is  not  necessary  or 

[people's] minds are not ready or the times do not allow, and lays down principles that can 

be elaborated, deduced, and expanded through consultation and the exercise of reason. 

  

 

 

188 

At the present time, all these sciences or even a third of them after one 

 

#189 

thousand  three  hundred  years  -  having  grown  through  the  meeting  of  minds  and  the 

expansion of their results - could not be found in a single person even in civilized places 

and among clever people. So whoever decks out his conscience with fairness will confirm 

that the Shari'a is always beyond human power, and was particularly so at that time. And 

he will endorse the statement "you haven't been able to do it and you won't be able to." 

 Virtue is that which is acknowledged even by enemies. For the American philosopher 

Cariyle {[*]: The famous historian and philosopher Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881) was actually 

Scottish.  He  was  born  in  Scotland  and  died  in  London.  The  two  passages  cited  here  are 

taken from his work On Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History (London: 1841), 

the chapter entitled: The Hero as Prophet. Mahomet: Islam. It is not known what Nursi's 

source was, for the first is rather a loose translation (See, pp. 74-5). Cariyle was actually 

praising the moral discipline and direction that Islam, and its Prophet, gives its adherents 

while at the same time not denying the pleasant things of life. It is not clear which remarks 

are  his  and  which  are  Goethe's.  The  second  (pp.  64-5),  is  closer  to  the  original,  though 

there  it  is  Islam  that  swallowed  up  the  existing  religions,  not  the  Qur'an.}  quoted  the 

famous German literary figure, Goethe, who asked after close study of the truths of the 

Qur'an: "Could the civilized world be further advanced within the bounds of Islam?" And he 

told himself: "Yes, indeed! For in one respect scholars now benefit from it." Cariyle said 

too that Islam appeared like a flaming light and devoured the religions of the time. And it 

had  the  right  to  do  so,s  for  it  contained  nothing  of  the  "vain  janglings"  of  some  of  the 

Christian sects or the "rumours... and idle wiredrawings" of the Jews. He confirmed the 

meaning of the verse: "Then produce a Sura like thereunto... But if you cannot... then 

fear the Fire..." (2:23-24) 

 If you were to ask: The Qur'an, and likewise its expounder - I mean Hadiths - have 

only taken summaries from all the sciences, but isn't it possible for a single individual to 

comprehend numerous summaries? 

 You would be told: Through their apt positioning and fitting use in fertile ground, in 

matters  that  are  only  hinted  at  -  as  we  indicated  in  the  second  point  above  -  such 

summaries  reveal  like  glass  a  full  cognizance  of  the  science  [in  question]  and  complete 

proficiency in it. So the summary becomes like the science and it would not be possible for 

such a person [as you mention to comprehend it]. 

 

189 

 Now understand that the conclusion of the above arguments is that firstly you should 

bear in mind the following rules: one person cannot be a specialist in a plethora of sciences; 

the same speech or words differ [when uttered by] two [different] people; [when uttered 

by] one they will be gold, and [when spoken by] the other they will be coal; the sciences 

result from 

 

#190 

the meeting of minds and are perfected with the passage of time; many matters that were 

theoretical in the past are now commonplace; to compare the past and present is a false 

comparison  [the  difference  between  them  is  too  great];  due  to  their  simplicity  and 

candour, desert-dwellers cannot hide trickery and deception, as they may be concealed 

beneath the veil of civilization; many of the sciences result only from instilling customs in 

human nature and teaching it events and circumstances, when the time and environment 

are  favourable;  the  light  of  man's  vision  cannot  penetrate  the  future  and  he  cannot 

perceive its particular circumstances; just as human life has a natural span which will come 

to an end, so too laws have a natural lifespan which comes to an end, of course; in terms 

of both time and place, the environment is vastly influential on people's circumstances; 

very  many  wonders  of  the  past  have  become  commonplace  through  the  perfecting  of 

means; human intelligence, even if exceptional, is not capable of creating a science and 

perfecting all at once; the science is rather like a child; [its development] is gradual. 

 Now that you have settled these matters in your head and can picture them, free 

yourself from the fancies of the present and the delusions of its environment, and plunge 

into the sea of time from the shore of this century. Then pass under the sea till you emerge 

at the Age of Bliss and behold the Arabian Peninsula. Raise your head and dress yourself 

with the ideas that that time sews for you, and take a look at the boundless desert. What 

appears to you first is a single person who although without helper or power is challenging 

the whole world on his own. He is disputing everyone. He is bearing on his shoulders a truth 

more  glorious  than  the  globe.  He  is  holding  in  his  hand  a  Shari'a  that  guarantees  the 

happiness of all men. This Shari'a of his is as though the sum and substance of all the divine 

sciences  and  the  sciences  of  reality.  It  is  living  like  a  skin  rather  than  like  clothes,  and 

expands as the human potentialities unfold, producing the fruits of happiness in this world 

and the next. It orders the affairs of humankind as if all men were the members of a single 

gathering. If its laws were to be asked from where they had come and where they were 

headed, they would reply through the tongue of their miraculousness: "We come from pre-

eternal [divine] speech and we shall accompany human thought through all eternity. When 

 

190 

the world ends we shall apparently part from men in respect of the religious obligations, 

but we shall always accompany them through the mystery of our meanings and shall nourish 

their spirits and assist and guide them." 

 

#191 

 So now, doesn't what you have witnessed up to here recite to you the verse with its 

taunting command: "... then produce a Sura like thereunto... But if you cannot, and of a 

surety you cannot..."? 

 Now consider this: the verse "And if you are in doubt as to what We have revealed" 

indicates that because some people are heedless of what the Lawgiver (al-Shâri ') intends 

in  guiding  the  mass  of  people  and  are  ignorant  of  the  necessity  of  offering  guidance 

commensurate  with  their  mental  capacity,  they  fall  into  doubt,  the  source  of  which  is 

three matters: 

 The First: They say: "The existence of allegorical verses and obscurities in the Qur'an 

is contrary to it miraculousness, which is based on eloquence (al-balâgha), and eloquence 

is based on clarity of expression. 

 The  Second:  They  say:  "The  Qur'an  is  vague  and  general  concerning  the  truths  of 

creation and the physical sciences (funûn al-kâ'inât), but this is contrary to its way and 

method (maslak), which is to teach and guide. 

 The Third: They say: "Some of the Qur'an's literal meanings tend to be contrary to 

rational proof so may be opposed to reality, and this is contrary to its veraciousness. 

 The Answer: Success is from Allâh alone. O you doubters, listen to this! What you 

suppose  to  be  causes  of  defect,  in  reality  are  truthful  witnesses  to  the  mystery  of  the 

Qur'an's miraculousness. 

  

Answer to the first doubt, which is the existence of allegories and obscurities: 

 The Qur'an's guidance is for all people, and most of them are common people. In 

[matters] of guidance, the minority follows the majority, for when the common people are 

addressed,  the  educated  classes  can  benefit  from  it  and  receive  their  share.  But  if  the 

reverse  is  true,  the  common  people  are  deprived  [of  their  share].  The  mass  of  people 

cannot free their minds from what they are accustomed to and imaginary things, and are 

therefore  unable  to  apprehend  sheer  truths  and  abstract  ideas  except  through  the 

telescope of their imaginations and by depicting things familiar to them. However, [when 

doing this] they should not fix their attention on the apparent forms [of those things] lest 

 

191 

it necessitates something impossible like their embodiment or having 'sides;' they should 

look beyond [the form] to the truths [behind them]. 

 For  example,  the  masses  can  conceive  of  the  reality  of  divine  disposal  over  the 

universe  in  the  form  of  a  king  seated  on  the  throne  of  his  power  holding  sway  over  his 

dominions. It is for this reason that [the Qur'an] chooses [to use] a metonymy in the verse: 

"the Most Gracious, established on the throne of His almightiness." (20:5) 

 

#192 

Since  the  feelings  of  the  mass  of  people  are  thus,  it  is  imperative  according  to 

eloquence and guidance that their understanding is taken into account, and their feelings 

are respected, and their intellects are deferred to, and allowance is made for their ideas. 

Like someone who speaks with a child has to come down to his level so that he can get the 

child to understand in a friendly manner. The literary devices and styles of the Qur'an (al-

asâlîb al-Qur'âniyya) in such places, that show regard for the mass of people are called 

"divine condescension to human minds (al-tanazzulât al-ilâhiyya ilâ 'uqûl al-bashar)." It is 

to  put  [people's]  minds  at  ease.  For  this  reason  it  sets  the  forms  [depicted  by]  the 

allegorical verses before the people's eyes like telescopes. Haven't you seen how most of 

the  eloquent  literati  use  figures  of  speech  (al-isti'ârât)  to  depict  subtle  meanings  or  to 

portray disparate ideas. Thus, the allegorical verses are figures of speech of an abstruse 

(ghâmid) kind for they depict abstruse truths. 

 As for there being obscure (mushkil) expressions, this is due either to the subtlety 

and profundity of what they signify, and the conciseness and loftiness of the style, and the 

obscurities  of  the  Qur'an  are  of  this  sort;  or  to  the  ambiguity  of  the  words  and  tangled 

expressions, which is contrary to eloquence and the Qur'an is exempt from this. So now, 

you  sceptic!  Isn't  it  pure  eloquence  to  so  easily  bring  close  to  the  common  people's 

understanding these profound truths which are so distant from everyone? For eloquence is 

to speak conformably to any given situation. Dwell on this! 

  

The Answer to the Second Doubt, which is the Qur'an's vagueness concerning the 

shaping of creation, although the modern sciences are explicit. 

 Understand that included in the tree of the world is the desire to be perfected (mayl 

al-istikmâl), out of which branches the inclination to progress found in man. The inclination 

to progress resembles a seed that sprouts and grows as a result of numerous experiences, 

and takes form and expands through the meeting of minds [and exchange of ideas] and 

produces the fruits of successive sciences, whereby the following can arise only after the 

 

192 

previous  one  has  come  into  being,  and  the  previous  one  can  only  be  preliminary  to  the 

subsequent one after it has been universally accepted. Consequently, if ten centuries ago 

a person wanted to teach science - remembering that sciences are born only as the result 

of numerous experiments - and call people to it, all he would have done would have been 

to confuse their minds and caused them to fall into error. For instance, if the Qur'an had 

 

#193 

said: "O people! Behold the stationary sun {[*]: One time when I was ill, in a state between 

sleeping and waking, [the following] occurred to me about "And the sun runs it course to a 

place appointed." (36:38) That is, [it turns] "in" its appointed place so that its [the solar] 

system can be upheld. That is, by rotating it generates the force of attraction [gravity] 

which  holds  the  solar  system  in  its  order.  Otherwise,  it  would  fall  apart.  (This  sleepy 

footnote is subtle and meaningful) - Said Nursi 

 In his work Lemeât (1921) (See, The Words, 732.) Said Nursi expressed this idea in 

"semiverse:" 

 The sun is a fruit-bearing tree; it shakes itself so that the planets fall not, its fruits. 

 If  it  rested  motionless  the  attraction  would  cease,  and  they  would  weep  through 

space,  its  ecstatics.}  and  rotating  earth  and  the  swarming  millions  of  living  beings  in 

creation, then conceive of the Maker's grandeur!", it would have driven the people either 

to denial, or to deceive themselves or to compete with it. For because of their superficial 

view, rather their false view, they look on the earth as self-evidently flat and the sun as 

rotating. So indeed, to confuse people's minds, especially over the period of a thousand 

years just to satisfy a few people of our times would have been contrary to wise guidance 

and opposed to the spirit of eloquence. 

 Friend!  Don't  assume  that  you  can  draw  an  analogy  between  theoretical  future 

matters and the conditions of the hereafter. [That is, don't suppose that the matters of 

the  hereafter  and  its  conditions,  which  are  unknown  to  us,  are  similar  to  theoretical 

matters  that  will  be  discovered  in  the  future.]  For  since  the  external  senses  cannot 

perceive any aspect of [the matters of the hereafter], they remain within the bounds of 

the  possible  and  may  be  believed  in  confidently.  What  they  clearly  require  is  to  be 

elucidated. However, when it comes to our subject [the discoveries of science], since in 

the view [of the people of those times] they were outside the bounds of possibility and 

probability, and due to their erroneous perceptions [what they thought to be true] was 

self-evident, what was required in the view of eloquence was for those discoveries [to be 

mentioned] in vague and general [terms] out of respect for the people's feelings and so as 

 

193 

not to confuse their minds. Nevertheless, the Qur'an indicates, hints at, and makes allusion 

to  the  truth,  and  opens  the  door  to  minds  and  bids  them  enter  by  planting  signs  and 

associated meanings (qarâ'in). Friend! If you are fairminded, reflect on the rule "Speak to 

people  in  accordance  with  their  level  of  understanding,"  {[*]:  See,  al-Suyûtî,  Kanz  al-

'Ummâl, x, 307; al-Firdaws, v, 359.} and understand that since the times and environment 

of those people had not equipped them mentally they would have been unable to support 

or sustain such matters [as the discoveries of science], 

 

#194 

miraculousness. 

  

which were [later] born of the meeting of minds and conjunction of ideas, and concede 

that the Qur'an's choosing to be vague and general is pure eloquence and evidence of its 

The  Answer  to  the  Third  Doubt,  which  is  some  of  the  literal  meanings  of  verses 

tending to be contrary to rational evidences and the findings of science. 

 Consider this: the Qur'an's main aim is to instruct the mass of people (al-jumhûr) 

about  its  four  basic  principles,  which  are  proof  of  the  Single  Maker,  prophethood,  the 

resurrection of the dead, and justice. Thus, its mention of the universe is secondary and 

digressive,  for  purposes  of  deduction  (al-istidlâl),  for  it  was  not  revealed  to  teach 

geography or cosmography (astronomy). It mentions the universe in order to conclude from 

the divine art in it and its unique order [the existence of] the True Orderer (May His glory 

be exalted). It is a fact that traces of art, purpose, and order are to be seen in all things, 

but however they were formed does not concern us since it is unconnected with the main 

aim. For seeing that the Qur'an speaks of beings for purposes of deduction, and seeing that 

their existence has to be known before the proposition, and seeing that the evidence has 

to be clear, how could guidance and eloquence not make it imperative that [the Qur'an] 

should  incline  with  some  of  its  apparent  or  literal  meanings  (zawâhir  al-nusûs)  towards 

their  emotional  views  and  literary  knowledge,  making  concessions  to  them?  Such  literal 

meanings are not for affirming or indicating their knowledge, but are allusive (min qabil 

al-kinâyât) or associative expressions (mustatba'ât al-tarâkîb). In any event, [the Qur'an] 

includes signs and indications for investigators of the truth (ahl al-tahqîq) that point to the 

truth. 

 

 For example, suppose when presenting its argument (fi maqâm alistidlâl) the Qur'an 

had said: "O people! Ponder over the sun's being stationary although it apparently moves, 

and the earth's daily and annual rotations although it is apparently stationary. Reflect on 

194 

the extraordinary gravity holding the stars [in place]. Behold the marvels of electricity, 

and  the  infinite  combinations  of  the  seventy  elements,  and  the  massing  together  of 

uncountable  organisms  in  a  droplet  of  water,  and  know  that  Allâh  is  powerful  over  all 

things!" Had it spoken thus, the evidence would have been obscurer and far less clear than 

what was being claimed, and that is opposed to the rules of deduction. 

 Moreover, since [the literal meanings of verses that apparently tend to contradict 

science] are allusive, their meanings are not either true or false 

 

#195 

qâf or kâf. 

[that is, their meanings should not be taken literally]. Don't you see that the alif in the 

word "qâla" denotes lightness, so it makes no difference whether its root was yâ or wâw, 

 In Short: Since the Qur'an was revealed for all people of all times, these three points 

[which are thought to raise doubts] are evidence of its miraculousness. I swear [by Allâh] 

Who taught the miraculous Qur'an, that the view of the Bringer of Good News and Warner 

and his critical insight were too fine, brilliant and penetrating to confuse truth and illusion, 

and  his  way  of  truth  was  too  elevated,  pure  and  exalted  to  deceive  people  or  mislead 

them. 

 The Seventh Matter 

 The books of [the Prophet's] biography and works of history have described numerous 

of his perceptible miracles (mu'jizât mahsûsa), and the famous wonders he performed in 

the presence of the people, and these have been commented on by authoritative scholars. 

To teach what is already known would be superfluous, so we refer detailed discussion to 

their  books  and  here  we  shall  summarize  [the  miracles]  by  mentioning  [only]  their 

categories. 

 

 

 

{(*): This strange shape did not appear 

by chance in the middle of this discussion of 

strange things, for just as I was writing out a 

[fair]  copy  in  Diyarbekir  in  Cevdet  Bey's 

house  on  19th  subat  [3  March  1916]  on  the 

night  [before]  Friday,  Bitlis  fell  and  the 

author  (Bediuzzaman)  was  taken  captive. 

 

The strange shape [of spilt ink] on this page 

 

195 

on  that  night  was  a  sign  -but  Allâh  knows 

and their being taken prisoner that night in 

best-  of  the  spilt  blood  of  those  of 

Bitlis. (Abdûlmecid) 

Bediuzzaman's students who were with him 

 Moreover, [this spilt ink] took the shape of a serpent whose tail encircled the author 

and whose head had been severed. This [signified] the Russians. It also depicts the water 

conduit into which the author fell wounded, where he remained for thirty hours awaiting 

death every moment. (Hamza)} 

 

#196 

 Concerning  [the  Prophet's]  manifest  wonders:  although  each  of  them  has  been 

transmitted from only one source (âhâdîyan) and there is no consensus concerning them 

(ghair  mutawâtir),  as  a  type  and  there  being  many  in  these  categories  they  may  be 

considered as being unanimously reported in respect of their meanings (mutawâtir bi'1-

ma'nâ). They consist of three categories: 

 The  First:  [The  various  paranormal  events  that  took  place  before  the  prophetic 

mission but which were related to it, called] "irhâsat." [These included] the Zoroastrians' 

fire being extinguished, the drying up of Lake Sava, the breaking into two of Chrosroes' 

portico,  and  the  prognostications  of  hidden  voices.  A  person  might  even  fancy  that  the 

century in which the Messenger (Upon whom be blessings and peace) was born was a highly 

sensitive wonderworker that had premonitions of his coming. 

 The Second Category: The many predictions of the future, including the conquest of 

the  treasuries  of  the  Persian  and  Byzantine  rulers,  the  defeat  of  the  Byzantines,  the 

conquest of Mecca, and so on. As if [the Messenger's] ethereal, winged spirit rent the bonds 

of  fixed  time  and  space,  roamed  in  the  climes  of  the  future,  then  told  us  what  it  had 

witnessed. 

 The Third Category: Wonders that could be perceived by the physical senses and 

were performed during [the period of] his challenging [the existing order] and calling [to 

Islam].  [These  included]  stones  speaking,  trees  moving,  the  splitting  of  the  moon,  and 

water  flowing  [from  his  fingers],  alZamakhsharî  stated  that  there  were  as  many  as  a 

thousand [miracles] of this category. Some of these have been reported unanimously but 

not literally (mutawâtir bi'1-ma'nâ). In fact, even those who denied the Qur'an could not 

tamper with the verse "And the moon is split." (54:6) 

  

 

-If you were to ask: Something like the splitting of the moon should have become 

world famous and known by everyone? 

196 

 You  would  be  told:  [Factors  like]  differences  in  the  time  of  its  rising,  and  the 

existence  of  cloud,  and  there  being  little  observation  of  the  skies  at  that  time,  and  its 

occurrence  at  an  hour  [people  are]  inattentive,  during  the  night,  and  its  occurring 

instantaneously, all meant that it was not seen by everyone or most people. Nevertheless, 

it has been established in narrations that it was witnessed by many caravans for which the 

moon's position was similar to that [of Mecca]. 

 However,  the  chief  of  these  miracles  is  the  Perspicuous  Qur'an  whose  proven 

miraculousness in seven aspects is indicated by this verse. (2:23) 

 Friend! If you have understood these matters listen now to what you will 

 

#197 

be  told  about  the  three  aspects  of  the  verses'  positioning  and  word-order:  the  verse's 

positioning in relation to what preceded it; the positioning [and relationships] of some of 

its phrases; the positioning [and relationships] of the parts of the phrases. 

 Concerning the first: there are two aspects to the relationship of this verse and 

the preceding ones: 

 The First: According to Ibn 'Abbas' commentary, when in order to prove divine unity 

[the Qur'an] says: "O you people! (Yâ ayyuhâ an-nâs)," it also proves the prophethood of 

Muhammad  (Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace),  who  was  the  clearest  proof  of  divine 

unity. Now, prophethood is proven by miracles. And the greatest of miracles is the Qur'an. 

And the most subtle facet of the Qur'an's miraculousness lies in the eloquence of its word-

order (nazm). 

 Muslims  agree  that  the  Qur'an  is  miraculous  and  inimitable.  The  authoritative 

scholars however differ as to the ways in which this is so. Nevertheless, these ways do not 

conflict,  for  some  prefer  one  aspect  [and  others  another  aspect].  Some  say  that  its 

miraculousness lies its predicting the future; according to others, it is its bringing together 

[all] truths and sciences; others assert it is its freedom from contradictions and defects; 

according to others, it is the originality of its styles and the singularity of the beginnings 

and ends of its verses and suras; others say it was its appearance from someone illiterate 

who could neither read nor write; according to others it was its being so extraordinarily 

eloquent as to be beyond human power; and so on and so forth. Detailed knowledge of this 

[latter] sort of miraculousness may be obtained by studying Qur'anic commentaries such as 

the present work, or it may be learnt summarily in [the following] three ways, as it was 

ascertained  by  'Abd  al-Qâhir  al-Jurjânî,  the  Master  of  Eloquence  (al-Shaikh  al-Balâgha), 

and al-Zamakhsharî, and al-Sakkâkî, and al-Jâhiz: 

 

197 

 The First Way: 

 The Arab people were illiterate nomads [who lived] in an unusual environment that 

suited them. They were awaked by the mighty revolutions [occurring] in the world. Their 

[only]  books  (dîwânuhum)  [of  their  proud  exploits  consisted  of]  poetry  and  their  [only] 

science  was  rhetoric  (al-balâgha),  and  [the  source]  of  their  pride  and  vainglory  was 

eloquent speech (al-fasâha) in such fairs as 'Ukâz. They were the cleverest of peoples and 

therefore  the  most  needy  for  mental  exercise  and  activity,  and  mentally  they  were 

experiencing a period of burgeoning youth. Then the Holy Qur'an rose upon them with its 

majesterial eloquence and outshone their eloquence, represented by the Seven Hanging 

Odes (al-mu'allaqât al-sab'a), 

 

#198 

inscribed in gold [hanging] on the walls of the Ka'ba. Despite their being eloquent 

orators - the commanders of rhetoric and eloquence and rulers of correct Arabic - they 

could not dispute the Qur'an nor utter a single word in argument, despite the severe taunts 

of  the  Messenger  (UWBP)  and  his  rebuking  and  chiding  them,  and  discrediting  their 

intelligence,  and  provoking  them  over  a  long  period,  and  his  humiliating  them  although 

some of their orators' heads touched the skies in their pride and others reached the stars. 

So if they had not wanted to dispute [the Qur'an] and put it to the test and if they had not 

been aware of their impotence, they surely would not have remained silent. Their total 

inability [to dispute the Qur'an] was therefore proof of its miraculousness and inimitability. 

The Second Way: 

 Punctillious scholars and critics with knowledge of all the parts of speech and their 

properties and fine points, have studied the Qur'an sura by sura, passage by passage, verse 

by  verse,  and  word  by  word,  and  they  have  testified  that  it  brings  together  truths, 

qualities, and subtleties not found all together in human speech. There are thousands of 

such [scholars]. Evidence for the veracity of their testimony are the momentous changes 

that the Qur'an wrought in the world of humanity, and the widespread religion it founded, 

and  its  perpetuating  down  the  ages  what  it  contains  of  the  sciences,  and  its  growing 

younger as time grows older, and its becoming sweeter the more it is repeated. Hence "It 

  

  

is only revelation inspired." (53:4) 

The Third Way: 

 

198 

 As is pointed out by al-Jâhiz, despite the intense need of the masters of oratory and 

rhetoric to invalidate and frustrate the Messenger's (Upon whom be peace) cause, and in 

spite of their hatred of him and obduracy, they gave up disputing him verbally, which was 

the safest, easiest, and most direct way, and they took up arms against him, despite this 

being  the  most  difficult  and  lengthy  way,  beset  with  dangers  and  of  uncertain  end. 

Moreover, their political acumen was such that the differences between these two ways 

could not have escaped them. So the person who avoided the first way although it was 

possible [to attempt it] and would have been more effective at thwarting the [Messenger's] 

cause, and took the way that threw his property and life into peril, must have been either 

stupid - and this could not be ascribed to those who ruled the world after they were rightly-

guided - or he felt powerless to take the former way and was compelled to take the latter. 

-If  you  were  to  ask:  It  was  possible  to  dispute  [the  Qur'an],  but  perhaps  for  some 

reason or other it was not attempted? 

  

 

#199 

 You would be told: If it had been possible some people would have striven to do so 

since the provocations were [severe] and the need was intense. And if they had disputed 

it, it would have been known, for it was much sought after and there were many reasons 

for  its  being  known.  And  if  it  had  become  known,  there  would  have  been  many  who 

supported [such an attempt to dispute it], and to defend it, and they would have said that 

it  had  been  disputed,  particularly  at  that  time.  And  had  there  been  opposers  and 

defenders, even if only out of bigotry, it would have become famous, for it was a matter 

of great import. And if it had been famous, it would have been reported in the chronicles, 

just as they reported the ravings of Musaylima [the Liar] when he said [in imitation of the 

Qur'an]: "An elephant, what is an elephant? How can you recognize an elephant? It has a 

short tail and long trunk." 

 - If you were to ask: Musaylima was an eloquent orator, so how is it that his words 

have been so mocked and scorned by people? 

 You would be told: Because he was [his words were] compared with something far 

higher than himself. Haven't you noticed that if someone is compared with Yûsuf (Joseph) 

(Upon whom be peace), he appears ugly even though he may be good looking? It is therefore 

not possible to dispute the Qur'an, so it must be miraculous. 

 -If  you  were  to  ask:  The  sceptics  have  voiced  many  objections  and  doubts  on 

grammatical  grounds  about  the  Qur'an's  phrases  and  words,  such  as,  "in  hâdhân  -  these 

 

199 

two," (20:62) "al-sâbi'ûna - Sabeans, (5:69) and "alladhi istawqada naran - who kindle a 

fire" (2: 17)? 

 You would be told: You should consult the conclusion of al-Sakkâkî's al-Miftâh, for 

he effectively silences [such objectors] saying: "Don't they understand that a person whose 

eloquently correct speech is unanimously acknowledged would know whether or not what 

he  had  repeatedly  stated  over  a  long  period  of  time  contained  the  errors  noticed  it  by 

unthinking people like them?" 

verses]: 

 The second aspect of the verse's positioning [and relationship with the previous 

 When  the  previous  verse  commands  worship,  the  listener  asks  in  his  mind:  "How 

should we worship?" And it as though answers: "As the Qur'an teaches you!" So then the 

person asks: "How can we know that it's the word of Allâh the Most High?" And it replies 

saying:  "And  if  you  are  in  doubt  as  to  what  We  have  revealed,  step  by  step,  to  Our 

servant..." (2:23) 

 

#200 

 The positioning of the verse's phrases: 

 The  sentence  "And  if  you  are  in  doubt  as  to  what  We  have  revealed,  step  by 

step, to Our servant" has fallen into place most aptly, for when the Qur'an commands 

worship, it is as though it is asked: "How can we know that it's Allâh's command, that we 

have to comply with it?" And it replies: "If you doubt it, try [to produce something similar] 

yourself; then you'll be certain that it's Allâh's command." 

 Another  aspect  of  the  verse's  positioning  is  this:  the  Qur'an,  having  praised  itself 

with the sentence "That is the Book concerning which is no doubt, guidance sure for those 

who fear Allâh," (2:2) and followed this with praise of the believers, and having gone on 

from  this  to  censure  the  disbelievers  and  dissemblers  and  then  proceeded  to  command 

worship and the affirmation of divine unity, it now returns to the beginning and directs 

attention  to  "concerning  which  is  no  doubt."  That  is,  no  doubts  can  be  levelled  at  the 

Qur'an; if you have doubts, they arise from your diseased hearts and sickly characters. 

 One denied the sunlight due to disease of the eyes; µ 

And  felt  disgust  at  the 

taste of water due to sickness. 

 The  positioning  of  the  phrase:  "then  produce  a  Sura  like  thereunto:"  this  is  the 

apodosis [of the protasis (condition) "if you are in doubt"], and the apodosis has to be the 

consequence of the conditional verb. And since the command ["then produce a Sura..."] is 

provocative  (ta'jîzî),  it  necessitates  the  implied  command  "make  the  attempt  to! 

 

200 

(tashabbathû)." And since the command expresses something new (inshâ'), and this cannot 

be a consequence, the consequence of the command has to be something other than the 

apodosis. And this is the necessity that is one of the basic meanings of the command. Now, 

the necessity of attempting also does not appear to be the consequence of their doubting, 

so this requires implied sentences concealed beneath the verse. The implied sentences are 

these: "If you doubt that this is Allâh's word, you should study its miraculous nature, for 

something  miraculous  cannot  be  human  and  Muhammad  (Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 

peace) is human. If you want its miraculousness to be evident, try yourself [to produce 

something similar] and that you're incapable will become clear. That means you are obliged 

to attempt to produce a sura similar to it." 

 How excellent is Allâh's Revelation! How concise! How miraculous! 

 Now for the positioning of "and call your witnesses [and helpers if 

 

#201 

aspects: 

leaders. 

there  are  any]  besides  Allâh  (wa'd'û  shuhadâ'akum  min  dûn  Allâh),"  it  has  three 

 The First: They say: "Just because we are incapable [of producing its like] it does 

not prove that all mankind is incapable." So it dumbfounds them with the words: "and call 

your  witnesses  [and  helpers  if  there  are  any]  besides  Allâh;"  that  is,  your  elders  and 

 The Second: They declare: "If we dispute [the Qur'an], who would support us and 

defend us?" So it silences them saying: "Whatever the outlook, it has its adherents. Were 

you to dispute it, supporters would emerge to defend you." 

 The Third: It is as though the Qur'an is saying: "The Messenger (Upon whom be peace) 

calls on Allâh the Most High as witness, and Allâh testifies to his truthfulness by placing 

the stamp of miraculousness on his cause. So if your gods and witnesses are any use to you 

at all, call on them!" In this way, [the Qur'an] pours scorn on them. 

 The positioning and relationship of "But if you cannot (Fa-in lam taf'alû)" is clear. 

For it implies the following phrases: "So attempt it, but look! [You can't!] And if you can't, 

it's clear you're incapable of doing it!"  

 The positioning of "and of a surety you cannot (wa lan taf'alû):" it is as if when it 

says "and of a surety you cannot," one of them says in reply: "Just because we haven't been 

able to do it, it doesn't mean mankind will be incapable of doing it in the future." So it 

replies: "of a surety you cannot (lit. will not)." This signifies its miraculousness in three 

respects: 

 

201 

 The  First:  Its  foretelling  the  future,  and  as  it  predicted  so  it  was.  As  you  know, 

millions  of  Arabic  books  have  attempted  to  imitate  the  style  of  revelation,  as  well  as 

numerous obdurate [deniers], yet none of them has been successful, as you will see if you 

scrutinize them. It is as though it is the single one of its kind. So it is either inferior to all 

of them, and this is unanimously agreed to be impossible, or it is superior. 

 The Second Respect: Its silencing and snubbing them, and censuring them for not 

doing  it,  and  provoking  them,  while  [the  Messenger]  was  in  that  precarious  situation 

[furthering]  his  great  cause.  This  is  a  sure  sign  that  he  was  reliable,  trustworthy,  and 

confident in his message. 

 The Third Respect: It is as though the Qur'an is saying: "You're the leaders in eloquent 

speech and the ones most needy [to produce the like of the Qur'an], yet you haven't been 

able to, so no one else will!" Moreover, it infers that just as the past could not produce 

anything  similar  to  Islam,  the  result  of  the  Qur'an,  so  will  the  future  will  incapable  of 

producing anything similar. 

 

#202 

 Now the positioning of "then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones (fa-'ttaqû 

al-nâr  allatî  waqûduhâ  an-nâs  wa  al-hijâra):"  consider  this:  "and  if  you  cannot"  being 

followed  by  "then  fear"  necessitates  according  to  the  tastes  of  eloquence  the  following 

implied  sentences:  "Since  you  haven't  been  able  to  do  it  and  you  won't  be  able  to,  it's 

obvious it's miraculous, so it [must be] Allâh's word. Hence it is incumbent on you to believe 

in it and comply with its commands. And one of its commands is 'O you people! Worship!,' 

that you may fear Hell-fire, so fear the Fire!" See how concise it is, how miraculous! 

 The  positioning  of  "whose  fuel  is  men  and  stones  (allati  waqûduha  alnâs  wa  al-

hijâra):" the purpose of "then fear (fa-'ttaqû)" is to frighten, and [here, being followed by 

"the Fire"] it has a strengthened, intensified meaning, in order to terrify them with "whose 

fuel is men." For a fire fuelled by human beings is more appalling and horrifying. Then it 

further intensifies it by adding stones. For [the fire] that burns stones is even fiercer. It 

also infers that it is restraining them from idolatry. That is, if you don't comply with Allâh's 

command  and  you  worship  stone  idols,  you  will  enter  the  Fire  that  consumes  both 

worshippers and their objects of worship. 

 The positioning of "prepared for those who reject faith (u'iddat li'lkâfirin):" this 

elucidates and establishes the consequence (luzûm) between the conditional verb "if you 

cannot" [the protasis] and its apodosis "then fear." That is, this calamity is not like storm 

and  tempest  and  other  [natural]  disasters  which  do  not  strike  wrongdoers  alone  but 

 

202 

encompass the righteous and elect; it is particular to offenders and caused by disbelief, 

and the only means of salvation from it is to comply with the Qur'an. 

 Moreover,  "prepared  (u'iddat)"  indicates  that  Hell  is  created  and  existent  at  the 

present moment, contrarily to what the Mu'tazilites asserted. The following will show you, 

and allow you to surmise, that Hell is eternal: if you reflect on the world from the point of 

view  of  wisdom  (al-hikma),  you  will  see  fire  to  be  a  vast  creature,  prevailing  and 

overwhelming, a primordial element of the lofty and lower worlds. And you will understand 

that it consists of a huge head and strange fruits that hang over into eternity. Don't you 

see that someone who espies a long stalk trailing along [the ground] will understand there 

to be a melon at the end of it; similarly whoever sees the creatures of fire will understand 

that at their extremity are the bitter fruits of Hell. Likewise, whoever sees bounties and 

good things and pleasures will surmise that their extracts and the place they are poured 

out and their garden is Paradise. 

 

#203 

where. 

 -If you were to ask: If Hell exists now, where is it located? 

 You  would  be  told:  We  Sunnis  believe  that  it  exists  now,  but  we  cannot  specify 

 -And  if  you  were  to  ask:  The  literal  meanings  of  some  Hadiths  indicate  that  it  is 

under  the  earth,  {[*]:  al-'Ajlûnî,  Kashf  al-Khafa,  i,  281;  see,  al-Hâkim,  al-Mustadrak,  iv, 

568.} and in one it says that its fire is two hundred times fiercer and hotter than worldly 

fire, {[*]: See, al-Bukhârî, Bad' al-Khalq, 10; Muslim, Janna, 30; al-Tirmidhi, Jahannam, 7.} 

and that the sun also will enter Hell? 

 You would be told: The expression "under the earth" means its core, for the centre 

is under the globe. It has been established by scientific theories that the heat (lit. fire) at 

the  [earth's]  centre  reaches  two  hundred  thousand  degrees.  For  every  thirty-three 

commercial  cubits  (dhirâ  al-tujjâr)  one  digs  down  into  the  earth,  the  temperature 

increases one degree, and at the centre it is approximately two hundred thousand degrees. 

This theory is in conformity with the Hadith that says that it is two hundred times hotter 

than worldly fire. 

 Moreover,  in  another  Hadith  it  says  that  a  part  of  this  fire  [of  Hell]  is  freezing 

(zamharîr) {[*]: al-Bukhârî, Mawaqit, 9; Muslim, Masâjid, 32; al-Tirmidhi Jahannam, 9; lbn 

Mâja, Zuhd, 38.} and that it burns with its coldness. This corresponds to the theory, for 

the fire at the centre - [from the centre] to the surface comprises all degrees of fire [heat]. 

And  it  has  been  established  by  natural  science  [al-hikmat  al-tabî'iyya]  that  there  is  a 

 

203 

degree of heat (lit. fire) that spontaneously attracts surrounding heat and burns it with its 

coldness and freezes water. 

 -If you were to ask: The fire inside the earth, that it contains, is very small, so how 

will it encompass Hell, which will encompass the heavens and earth? 

 You  would  be  told:  Even  if  in  respect  of  this  manifest  world  (al-mulk)  and  [Hell] 

being 'rolled up' (al-matwîyya), it is contained by the earth, but in respect of the hereafter, 

it will become so vast it will encompass thousands [of globes] similar to the earth. Yes, the 

Manifest  World  (âlam  al-shahâda)  is  like  a  screen  preventing  contact  between  this 

[present]  fire  and  its  branches.  Also,  its  being  under  the  earth  does  not  necessitate  its 

being conjoined with it, for the branches of the tree of creation have produced such fruits 

as the sun, the moon, and the stars, and our earth, and other earths. So what lies beneath 

the fruits includes the area between the 

 

#204 

repulsed. 

branches where it is found. The dominions (mulk) of Allâh the Most High are indeed wide 

and the tree of creation is spread [throughout them], so wherever Hell travels it cannot be 

 It says in a Hadith: "Hell is folded up." This possibly means that Hell is an egg of the 

bird of our flying earth, and when the veil of the Manifest World is rent, [the earth] will 

lay  its  egg  and  [Hell]  will  emerge,  baring  its  teeth  at  the  people  of  rebellion.  It  is  also 

possible that it was this [question of Hell] being 'folded up' that caused the Mu'tazilites to 

fall into the error [of believing] that Hell is not now existent, and to cling onto it. 

 Now for the positioning [and relationships of] the parts of the phrases: 

 The [conjunction] "and (al-wâw)" in "And if you are in doubt as to what We have 

revealed,  step  by  step,  to  Our  servant  (Wa  in  kuntum  fi  raybin  mimmâ  nazzalnâ  'alâ 

'abdina)," is [so placed] because of the relationship between [this verse and "O you people! 

Worship...", but no such relationship is apparent. It becomes apparent only through two 

implied questions and their answers: firstly is the implied answer to the question arising 

from the first verse: "How should we worship?", that is,] "as the Qur'an has taught you." [In 

reply to the second implied question: "How can we know the Qur'an is Allâh's word?", it 

says: "And if you are in doubt..."] {[*]: Nursi, İsârâtû' 1-İ'caz [Abdûlmecid], 203-4} 

 The  use  of  "if  (in),"  which  expresses  hesitation,  instead  of  "idhâ,"  which  infers 

certainty and resolve, [although it is certain that they are in a state of doubt,] indicates 

that  because  means  had  arisen  to  dispel  their  doubts,  their  very  existence  should  be 

doubtful or impossible even; they could only be hypothetical. 

 

204 

 Also,  the  doubt  expressed  by  "if  (in)"  looks  to  the  [literary]  style  and  not  to  the 

Speaker (May He be exalted). 

 The substitution of "you are in doubt (kuntum fi raybin)" for [the verbal form] 'you 

doubt' although the latter is more concise, indicates that the source of their doubt is their 

sick natures and characters. 

 And the doubt encompassing (zarfiyya) them although it is contained (mazrûf) by 

their hearts hints that the darkness of doubt has spread from their hearts and overwhelmed 

their whole physical beings, enveloping in darkness all ways [of possible illumination]. 

 The use of the indefinite for "doubt (rayb)" is to make it general. That is, whichever 

of the sorts of doubt you feel, the answer is the same, and that 

 

#205 

minimâ). 

is: [the Qur'an] is miraculous and true! Thus, your accusing [the Qur'an] of error due to 

your superficial view is an error and it is not necessary to answer every doubt specifically. 

You can surely see that a person who [happens upon] a spring and tastes its pure, sweet 

water does not need to taste all its subsidiary streams and branches. 

 The  [partitive]  "min"  in  "minimâ  nazzalnâ  -  as  to  (lit.  a  part  of)  what  we  have 

revealed" infers the implied words 'about a part of what of We have revealed' (fi shay'in 

 The word(s) "we have revealed (nazzalnâ)" indicates that the source of their doubt 

is [the Qur'an's] revelation (lit. descent). And the decisive reply proves its revelation. 

 The choice of [the Ilnd form] "nazzalnâ," which denotes gradual revelation, instead 

of [the IVth form] 'anzalnâ,' which suggests that it was sudden, alludes to the excuses they 

advanced saying: "Why isn't it revealed to him all at once?" Indeed, the Qur'an was revealed 

gradually as events required, according to circumstances, verse by verse, sura by sura. 

 The choice of the word "servant [or bondsman] ('abd)" rather than 'the Messenger' 

or 'Muhammad' indicates exaltation of the Messenger, and hints at the elevated nature of 

worship, and corroborates the command "Worship!" and infers the repulsion of delusions, 

for the Messenger (Upon whom be peace) performed more worship than anyone and recited 

more of the Qur'an. So reflect on this! 

 The phrase "then produce a sura like thereunto (fa-'tû bi-sûratin min mithlihi)." 

[The  purpose  of]  the  command  "then  produce"  is  to  display  their  impotence,  and  it 

comprises a challenge, and censure, and calls on them to try to dispute it, making clear 

their inability to do this. 

 

205 

 While the word "a sura" indicates [the Qur'an's] silencing and dumbfounding them 

utterly, as follows: 

 The First Level of Challenge: It says: "Produce the like of the whole Qur'an together 

with its truths, sciences, predictions, and elevated wordorder, all from someone illiterate. 

 The  Second  Level:  It  says:  "If  you  can't  do  that,  fabricate  something,  but  with 

similarly eloquent word-order. 

 The Third Level: It says: "If you can't do that either, produce around ten suras. 

 The  Fourth  Level:  If  you're  not  capable  of  doing  that  either,  just  produce  [the 

equivalent of] a long sura. 

 The Fifth Level: If that's too difficult for you as well, just bring one sura 

 

#206 

produce it. 

even if it's very short like "Behold We have bestowed upon thee (Innâ a'tainâka), (108:1) 

and from someone illiterate like him. 

 The Sixth Level: If it isn't possible for you to have it produced by someone illiterate, 

get an adept scholar or skilful writer to do it. 

 The  Seventh  Level:  If  that's  too  hard  for  you  too,  a  number  of  you  cooperate  to 

 The Eighth Level: And if you can't do that, seek the help of all men and jinn, and 

the assistance of all the results of their shared knowledge from the time of Adam till the 

end  of  the  world,  as  well  as  those  ideas  found  in  the  books  available  to  you  about  the 

Arabic language and its styles, written with the desire to imitate [the Qur'an] or out of 

obstinacy  by  those  wanting  to  dispute  it.  To  say  nothing  of  authoritative  scholars,  if  a 

person of scant intelligence or an ignorant one even were to study them, he would declare 

that none of them was similar to [the Qur'an], So it is either inferior to all of them, and 

this is impossible as is unanimously agreed, or it is superior to all. And this is what was 

wanted,  as  was  mentioned  above.  Indeed,  it  has  not  been  [successfully]  disputed  in 

thirteen centuries. And as that was true in the past, so it will be in the future, till the end 

 The Ninth Level: It says: Don't remonstrate saying you don't have any witnesses and 

we don't testify for you either. Go and call your witnesses and your partisans and let them 

consult their consciences; will they be so bold as to uphold what you claim disputing [the 

of time. 

Qur'an]? 

 

206 

 If you have understood these levels, consider now how the Qur'an is miraculous in 

its  conciseness,  indicating  these  levels,  silencing  them  effectively  and  loosening  their 

bridles [giving them the opportunity to reply]. 

 Understand too that human incapability to dispute even the shortest sura is a clear 

argument from effect to cause (inniyatuhu badîhîyya). As for its being argued from cause 

to effect (limmîyyatuhu), it is said "Allâh the Most High prevented men from disputing it." 

The most correct school in the latter question [the argument from cause to effect] is that 

followed by 'Abd al-Qâhir al-Jurjânî, al-Zamakhsharî, and al-Sakkâkî. This states that "it is 

beyond human power [to compose the Qur'an's] elevated word-order." Moreover, al-Sakkâkî 

preferred [the view] that its miraculousness can only be sensed (dhawqî) and cannot be 

expressed or explicated. It can only be experienced." But the author of Dalail al-I'jâz [al-

Jurjânî], preferred [the view] that it is possible to express it [in words], and we subscribe 

to his school in this question. 

 The choice of "sûra" rather than such words as "najm, tâ'ifa, or nawba" 

 

#207 

indicates [the Qur'an's] silencing them [by answering] the source of their doubts, namely, 

"Why wasn't it revealed to him all at once?" That is, [the Qur'an told them:] "You produce 

some and let's see it, even if only a single short piece!" 

 The choice of the word "sûra" signifies too that there are numerous benefits in the 

Qur'an being divided into suras, as has been elucidated by alZamakhshari, and that this 

unusual method contains many subtle points. 

 The  phrase  "like  thereunto  (min  mithlihi)"  signifies  two  [possible]  things:  that  is, 

[the  suffixed  pronoun  "hi"  refers]  either  to  the  thing  revealed  (al-munzal)  [the  Qur'an  - 

that is, "produce a sura like one of the Qur'an's"], or to the one to whom it was revealed 

(al-munzal 'alayhi) [the Messenger - that is, "get someone unlettered like him to produce 

it"]. If it is the former, it should be phrased "mithli sûratin minhu," but it is expressed as 

"min mithlihi," indicating that the second possibility is taken into account. That is, "You 

can  invalidate  his  case  with  your  disputing  only  if  someone  unlettered  like  him  [the 

Messenger] does it." It indicates too that [the Qur'an's] miraculousness could be invalidated 

only if disputed by a collection [a literary work, majmû'a - that is, if the sura produced 

was part of a complete work] like [the Qur'an], 

 The  phrase  also  allusively  directs  attention  to  the  other  scriptures  that  were 

revealed like the Qur'an, so that the listener may weigh them up in his mind and understand 

the Qur'an's elevated nature. 

 

207 

 The  sentence  "and  call  your  witnesses  [and  helpers  if  there  are  any]  besides 

Allâh (wa'd'û shuhadâ'akum min dûn Allâh):" the choice of "call (ud'û)" instead of 'seek the 

help or assistance of' indicates that those who might respond to them and defend them are 

not non-existent but are there [with them] and do not need to be called. 

 The word "witnesses (shuhadâ')" comprises three meanings: your authorities on the 

Arabic language, those who observe [witness] you, and your gods. 

 In respect of the first it silences them by rebutting their argument that their own 

inability  does  not  prove  that  their  literary  leaders  lack  the  power  [to  the  imitate  the 

 In respect of the second it dumbfounds them by cutting short their excuse that they 

had no witnesses, for every outlook and way has defenders and witnesses. 

 In respect of the third it rebukes and derides them, asking why their gods which 

they look to for benefits and to repel harm, do not help them in this matter that is troubling 

Qur'an], 

them. 

 

#208 

The genitive construction of "witnesses" and the pronominal suffix "your (- kum)" denotes 

particularity and strengthens the first meaning [above]: "Your great ones are present with 

you and there are special [bonds] between you; if they had been capable of helping you, 

surely [they would have done]." It expresses the second meaning like this: "We accept the 

testimony of those who support you and are your partisans, for they won't venture to testify 

for something whose invalidity is self-evident." And it takes the third meaning by the arm 

and mocks it, saying: "Why don't the gods you worship help you?" 

 With  respect  to  the  first,  the  phrase  "besides  Allâh  (min  dûn  Allâh)"  indicates 

generality; that is, [call] all the eloquent masters of language in the world other than Allâh 

the Most High. It indicates too that [the Qur'an's] miraculousness is only [miraculousness] 

because it is from Allâh. 

 With respect to the second, it indicates their impotence and confusion when they 

say:  "Allâh  is  our  witness.  Allâh  knows  that  we  can  do  it."  For  it  is  the  habit  of  those 

defeated  in  argument  and  reduced  to  impotence  to  swear  by  Allâh  and  call  on  Him  to 

witness what they are incapable of proving. 

 And with respect to the third it indicates that their disputing the Messenger (Upon 

whom be blessings and peace) was exactly the response of associating partners with Allâh 

(shirk) to divine unity (tawhîd), and of lifeless, unconscious beings to the Creator of the 

heavens and the earth. 

 

208 

 The phrase "if what you say is true (in kuntum sâdiqîn)" alludes to their saying: "If 

we wanted, we could say something similar." It also insinuates: "You aren't truthful. Your 

truthfulness is only hypothetical; indeed, you only utter sophistries. And you haven't fallen 

into doubt because you were seeking the truth, but because you were seeking the false, 

and you fell into it. Furthermore, the consequence (apodosis) [of the conditional verb "if 

what you ray"] is the sum and substance of the previous phrases; that is, "do it!" That is, 

"If what you say is true, then try to produce something similar." 

 The sentence: "But if you cannot, and of a surety you cannot, then fear the Fire 

(Fa-in lam taf'alû wa lan taf'alû fa-'ttaqû al-nâr):" with the phrase "If what you say is true" 

the Qur'an is confuting them with a conditional syllogism, excepting the opposite of the 

following phrase to occasion the opposite of the preceding one. 

 A summary of it: "If you were truthful, you would have disputed it and produced a 

sura, but you didn't [coundn't] and you won't [be able to]. One 

 

#209 

class?" 

 

concludes  from  this  that  you  weren't  truthful,  while  your  enemy,  the  Messenger  (Upon 

whom be peace), is truthful and that the Qur'an is miraculous. So this obliges you to believe 

in him so that you may fear [avoid] the punishment [of the Fire]!" See how miraculous is 

this conciseness of the Revelation! 

 Then, saying: "if you cannot (in lam taf'alu)" instead of 'but you haven't [done it]' 

(lâkin mâ taf'alûn), it indicates through the doubt denoted by "if" conformity with their 

suspicions (zann), and through its denoting a condition that is the opposite of the following 

sentence, necessitates the opposite of the previous one. Then, in place of the result, that 

is,  the  opposite  of  the  previous  one,  I  mean  "but  you  weren't  truthful,"  it  mentions  the 

third of three successive consequences (lâzim) of the cause ('illa), which is "then fear the 

Fire (fa-'ttaqû al-nâr)," to frighten, intimidate, and threaten them. 

 As for "if you cannot (lit. have not) (in lam taf'alû):" its signifying the past by virtue 

of the "lam - not" and the future through the "if (in)" is in order to direct attention towards 

their past, as though it is saying to them: "Look at your decorated orations and gilded Seven 

Hanging Odes: are any of them equal to [the Qur'an] or close to it even, or in the same 

 The choice of "do, make (taf'alû)" rather than 'bring' (ta'tû) suggests two points: 

 The First: It infers that the source of the [Qur'an's] miraculousness and inimitability 

(i'jâz) is their impotence ('ajz), and the source of their impotence is [related to] action 

209 

(fi'l) not to the work (athar). [That is, the source of their impotence is their inability to 

'do' or produce something similar to the Qur'an, not the work itself]. 

 The Second: It is for conciseness. For just as in grammar [the verbal root] fa 'ala is 

used to depict the patterns and forms of the verb, so in the literary styles it is used as the 

summary of actions and stories, as though it were a pronoun expressing whole sentences 

and alluding to them. 

 "And of a surety you cannot (wa lan taf'alû):" the future and emphasis expressed by 

"lan" infer definiteness, and this indicates that the speaker is confident and serious and 

that  he  has  no  doubts  concerning  what  he  is  saying.  And  this  is  a  sign  that  there  is  no 

trickery or deception [in what he says and does]. 

 The use of "then fear (fa-'ttaqû)" instead of 'avoid' (tajannabû), [both express the 

same meaning, but al-ittiqâ' follows on after belief, while avoidance does not have this 

secondary meaning] implies as a substitute for the consequence [of the above conditional 

sentence] the sentence: "Believe 

 

#210 

and avoid associating partners with Allâh (shirk), which is a cause of entering Hell-fire." 

 The definite article is used in "the Fire (al-nâr)" because it is wellknown and firmly 

fixed in people's minds, having been heard about from [all] the prophets from Adam up till 

now. Its being governed by the relative pronoun "which (allatî)" although [such pronouns] 

generally refer to something previously known, is in consequence of the earlier revelation 

of "a Fire whose fuel is men and stones," (66:6) before this verse, and those addressed had 

heard this. Thus the relative pronoun is in place. 

 "Whose fuel is men and stones (waqûduhâ al-nâs wa'l-hijâra):" as mentioned above, 

the purpose of this is to intimidate, and intimidation is made severer by threatening. Thus 

it threatens with the word "men" as though striking them and reinforces this with "stones" 

as though castigating them: "What profit or salvation do you hope for from these idols that 

are now the instruments of your torture?" 

 As for the phrase: "prepared for those who reject faith (u'iddat li'lkâfirin):" Know 

that the position [here required] 'prepared for you' (u'iddat la-kum), however, generally 

the Qur'an mentions summaries and general rules at the ends of verses to indicate the most 

powerful  evidences  for  the  statements  [made  in  the  verse  in  question].  Thus,  what  is 

basically [implied here] is "prepared for you if you disbelieve, since it is prepared for the 

disbelievers." For this reason the noun is used in place of the pronoun. 

 

210 

 Then "prepared" being in the perfect tense indicates that Hell exists at the present 

time, as was discussed above.

 But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness, that theirs are 

gardens beneath which rivers flow. Every time they are fed with fruits therefrom, they 

say: "Why, this is what we were fed with before," for they are given things in similitude; 

and they have therein companions pure [and holy]; and they abide therein [for ever]. (Wa

khâlidûn.) 

 Consider this: the word-order and positioning (nazm) of this verse, like its sisters, 

has three aspects: the positioning of the verse as a whole [and its relationship] with what 

precedes it; the positioning [and relationships] of the verse's phrases; and positioning [and 

relationships] of the constituents of the phrases. 

 The First 

 Between  this  verse's  meaning  and  the  previous  verses  are  various  relations,  and 

different lines stretch out from it to those verses' phrases. Surely you see how at the start 

of the sura the Qur'an praises itself and the believers, for [their] belief and good works, 

then with this verse indicates the result of belief and fruit of good works. And similarly, 

how it censures the disbelievers and condemns the dissemblers and describes their way 

which 

#212 

 

 

leads to eternal perdition, then alludes with this verse to the light of everlasting happiness, 

pointing it out to them to increase their sense of loss at having missed that supreme bounty. 

211 

 And having charged [the people] "O you people! Worship...", although this means 

hardship and difficulty and giving up immediate pleasures, it flings open to them the doors 

of postponed [future pleasures]. With this verse it satisfies and assures their souls. 

 And  having  proved  divine  unity,  the  principal  pillar  of  belief  and  chief  [religious] 

obligation, with this verse it announces the fruits of divine unity, the title-page of mercy 

and preface of divine pleasure by pointing out Paradise and eternal happiness. 

 And  having  proved  prophethood,  the  second  pillar  of  belief,  through  the 

miraculousness  of  the  verse  "And  if  you  are  in  doubt...,"  (2:23)  with  this  verse  and 

indirectly with the previous one, it alludes to the duties and obligations of prophethood, 

which are to warn and deliver good news through the tongue of the Qur'an. 

 And having threatened, intimidated, and warned in the previous verse, through the 

mystery of the relation between opposites, in this one it promises, excites desire, and gives 

good tidings. 

 Also, if a person is to make the souls [of others] submit and persist in obedience and 

make [their] consciences obey the dictates of reason, he will have to excite both the sense 

of  fear  and  sense  of  longing  by  bringing  together  [the  obligations]  of  frightening  [away 

from wrong] and attracting [to right] (tarhîb wa targhîb). For the dictates of the intellect 

are  only  temporarily  [effective],  and  there  has  to  be  in  the  conscience  a  permanent 

motivation and compelling incentive. 

 Moreover,  having  indicated  one  part  of  the  hereafter  with  the  previous  verse,  so 

with  this  one  it  indicates  the  other,  which  is  the  spring  of  eternal  happiness.  Similarly, 

there it alludes with fire to Hell, and here it explicitly mentions Paradise. 

 Now understand that Paradise and Hell are two fruits which point to eternity from 

the tree of creation, and are the two results of the chain of the universe. They are two 

storage  tanks  into  which  the  universe  is  poured,  and  two  pools  for  it  as  it  flows  into 

eternity.  Yes,  the  universe  will  be  convulsed  and  shaken  up  with  a  violent  motion,  and 

Paradise and Hell will appear and will fill up [with the appropriate matters]. 

An Elucidation of This: When Allâh (May His glory be exalted) willed the creation of 

a world for examination and trial, for numerous instances of 

wisdom too fine [to be apprehended by] the mind, He willed the change and transformation 

of  this  world  for  [many]  reasons.  He  combined  good  and  evil,  and  mixed  in  harm  with 

benefit, and included ugliness in beauty. He joined [evil, harm, and ugliness] to Hell and 

212 

  

#213 

 

 

sent them assistance from it. And He despatched good things and virtues to be manifested 

in Paradise. 

 Furthermore, when He willed trial and competition in [the world of] human beings 

and [for there to be] differences and change among them, he mixed in bad people with 

good. Then when the period of testing closes and divine will [commands] that they should 

be eternal, He will make the bad people manifest the verse: "Get you apart (...) O you 

guilty  ones."  (36:59)  While  the  good  will  be  honoured  and  graced  with  the  address:  "So 

enter there to dwell for ever!" (39:73) Then when the two categories are separated out 

the  universe  will  be  purified,  and  evil  and  harmful  matters  will  be  withdrawn  from  the 

good and the beneficial and perfected, and they will collect on one side. 

In Short: If you study the universe carefully, you will encounter two basic elements, 

two  long  crawling  stems  [like  melons],  that  when  [the  fruits  of  which  are]  collected 

together and made immortal, will become Hell and Paradise. 

An Introduction 

 This verse and the preceding ones betoken the resurrection of the dead and great 

gathering. There are four noteworthy points in this matter: 

 Firstly: The possibility of the world's destruction and its death. 

 Secondly: Their occurrence. 

 Thirdly: Its repair and being raised to life. 

 Fourthly: Their occurrence. 

  

 

 

 The Possibility of the Universe's Death: If a thing is subject to the law of evolution 

(qânûn  al-takâmul),  it  undergoes  growth  and  development.  It  has  therefore  a  natural 

lifespan and allotted time of death; it cannot escape death's call. According to inductive 

reasoning, [this goes for] most members of the species (afrâd al-anwâ). So just as man, 

the microcosm, cannot be saved from destruction; so too there is no refuge from death for 

the world, the macroanthropos. Similarly, a tree is a miniature copy of the universe and is 

pursued by demolition and dissolution; so too the chain of the universe is a part of the tree 

of creation and cannot be saved from the hand of destruction and reconstruction. So if not 

struck by a violent wind or an 

 

 

 

 

213 

external  illness  [ordained  by]  pre-eternal  divine  will  before  [the  end  of]  its  natural 

lifespan, and if its Maker does not annihilate it earlier, there will necessarily and certainly 

and even according to scientific reckoning come a day when the verses "When the sun is 

rolled up * When the stars grow dark" (81:1-2) and "When the sky is rent apart" (82:1) will 

be  realized.  Then  the  macroanthropos  will  suffer  its  death  agonies  and  utter  a  horrible 

growl, an appalling roar, that will resound through space. 

#214 

  

Its occurrence: As is agreed by all the revealed religions, and testified to by all sound 

natures, and indicated by the change, transformation, and renewal of the universe, - and 

if you wish, imagine the world's death agonies and its roar - the universe is bound together 

with a delicate, elevated order and clings to those wondrous bonds. So when one of the 

heavenly  bodies  receives  the  order:  "Be!"  or  "Quit  your  orbit!"  you  will  see  the  world 

[suddenly]  smitten  by  its  death  agonies  and  the  stars  and  heavenly  bodies  beginning  to 

clash and collide. Infinite space will thunder and roar. On one part striking another sparks 

will fly off as big as the earth or bigger. Can you imagine the awful sound of millions of 

firing cannons the smallest shells of which are larger than the earth? For that will be the 

sound of its death. With the onset of its demise, the creation will be convulsed and beings 

will  separate  out,  and  Hell  will  emerge  together  with  its  inhabitants  and  matters,  and 

Paradise  will  become  manifest,  bringing  together  all  the  subtleties  derived  from  its 

elements. 

  

unchanging? 

-If you were to ask: Why is the universe subject to change and time and [so] will be 

destroyed,  then  at  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  will  be  made  eternal,  fixed,  and 

 You would be told: Since pre-eternal wisdom and providence necessitated trial and 

examination,  and  the  development  of  potentialities  and  unfolding  of  abilities,  and  the 

disclosure of the relative truths (al-haqâ'iq al-nisbiyya), which in the hereafter will be total 

truths (al-haqâ'iq alhaqîqiyya), and the existence of relative degrees and many instances 

of wisdom the human mind is powerless to perceive; the Maker (May His glory be exalted) 

made the natures and dispositions of things different, and combined harmful things with 

useful ones, and interspersed evils among good, and He brought together ugly things and 

beautiful. The Hand of Power kneaded together opposites and the universe became subject 

to the law of change, alternation, variation, and development (al-takâmul). 

 

214 

 Thus, the Maker (May His glory be exalted) willed through His grace that when the 

arena of examination is closed, and the time of trial finished, 

 

#215 

and the harvest-time has come, He will purify the various opposites to make them eternal, 

and separate out the causes of change, and distinguish the matters of difference. Then 

Hell will be formed with its solid body, receiving the address of "So get you apart!" And 

Paradise will be manifested with its eternal, stable body and foundations. [This will be] in 

accordance  with  [the  rule]  "relations  are  essential  for  order,"  [That  is,  there  is  no 

contrariety  between  the  elements  and  parts  forming  Paradise  and  Hell;  there  are  only 

relations and bonds between them] {[*]: Nursi, İsârâtûl-İ'caz [Abdülmecid], 218.} and order 

is the cause of continuity. 

 Moreover, through His perfect power, the Most High will give the dwellers of those 

two eternal abodes stable existences that will not be subject to dissolution or change, for 

change here, which leads to extinction, arises from the relative differences [that is, the 

imbalance]  between  what  is  formed  and  what  dissolves.  But  the  relative  stability  there 

[that is, the balance] will permit change that will not lead to disintegration. 

 The Third and Fourth Points, I mean the possibility of the repair and raising to life 

of  the  earth,  and  their  occurrence:  since  proofs  of  divine  unity  and  prophethood  taken 

from the Qur'an and Hadiths (al-dalîl al-naqlî) alone are not valid as it would necessitate 

a circular argument, {[*]: This is because the validity of evidences taken from Qur'an and 

Hadiths is tied to the authenticity and veraciousness of prophethood; to prove prophethood 

by  such  evidences  therefore  would  entail  an  impossibility  and  circular  argument.  See, 

Nursi, İsârâtûl-İ'caz [Abdülmecid], 218.} the Qur'an alludes to rational proofs of them [as 

well].  It  is  permissible  however  for  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  to  be  proven  by  both 

reason and the Qur'an and Hadiths [bi'l-'aql wa'l-naql). For rational proofs, you may consult 

what  we  explained  to  our  utmost  when  expounding  "And  have  certain  belief  in  the 

hereafter" (2:4) Briefly, order, mercy, and grace only become order, mercy and grace with 

the coming of the resurrection. The transmitted (naqlî) evidences consist of what everyone 

has  said  [all  the  prophets],  {[*]:  Nursi,  İsârâtûl-İ'caz  [Abdûlmecid],  218.}  and  what  the 

miraculous Qur'an states about its occurrence. For these evidences as well as indications 

of the rational ones, you may refer to this subject in Fakhr al-Din al-Razi's commentary, 

{[*]: Fakhr al-Dîn al-Râzi (1165-1240 A.D.) is reputed to have written around 200 works in 

various of the Islamic sciences including tafsir (Qur'anic exegesis), kalâm (theology), and 

the principles of fiqh (jurisprudence). One of his most famous works is the commentary 

 

215 

Mafâtih al-Ghayb, known as al-Tafsir al-Kabir.} for he enumerates the verses that prove 

the resurrection of the dead. 

 

#216 

 In Short: A person has only to peruse the samples, examples, and similitudes of the 

resurrection in very many realms (lit. species - al-anwâ') [of beings] to surmise from their 

diverse signs the existence of bodily resurrection and eternal happiness. 

 The positioning and relationships of the phrases: 

 You should be aware that the string on which the pearls of this verse are threaded 

in successive order is this: eternal happiness is of two sorts: 

 The First and Foremost: Allâh the Most High's pleasure, and His grace, manifestation, 

and nearness. 

 The  Second:  Physical  bliss,  which  is  attained  through  one's  house,  food,  and 

marriage, and their continuing for all eternity, which completes and perfects them. 

 The first sorts are not in need of detailed explanation, or anyway such explanation 

is not possible. As for the second, the most agreeable of dwellings is that set among plants 

and flowing water. You surely know that the plashing, gurgling waters of rivers, whispering 

beneath pavilions and gardens, inspire poetry and breathe love into hearts. As for food, it 

is sustenance, and while the most delicious of basic sustenance is that which is familiar, 

fruits are best in one respect when varied. For familiarity [allows] one to recognize the 

high  degree  of  the  bounty  and  its  superiority  over  similar  things.  Moreover,  one  of  its 

highest pleasures is knowing that [the sustenance] is the reward for one's actions. Another 

is  its  source  and  store  being  right  before  one's  eyes,  yielding  the  pleasure  of  confident 

assurance.  Concerning  marriage,  one  of  man's  most  intense  needs  is  to  have  someone 

respond to him with heartfelt love and to share with [his partner] pleasure and intimacy, 

and for them to together feel wonder [at the divine bounties] and to ponder over them. 

You must have observed that if someone sees something unusual that perplexes him and 

makes him think, he calls on someone, if only mentally, to share his perplexity. And the 

gentlest of hearts, and the kindest and warmest, are those of the second sex. And those 

whose  spirits  will  blend  fully  and  hearts  will  achieve  complete  intimacy,  and  whose 

outward union will be pure and chaste are those of the second sex who have been purified 

and cleansed of bad morals and unpleasant traits. 

  

 

-If you were to ask: [The purpose of] food is to perpetuate a person's [life] for by 

means  of  it  those  parts  of  the  body  that  dissolve  are  re-formed,  and  marriage  is  to 

216 

perpetuate the human race, but in the hereafter people will be immortal and not subject 

to  change  and  dissolution.  Anyway  there  will  be  no  reproduction  in  the  hereafter,  will 

there? 

 

#217 

 You  would  be  told:  The  benefits  of  food  and  marriage  are  not  restricted  to 

perpetuating  life  and  reproduction;  they  are  a  source  of  great  pleasure  in  this  painful 

world. So why shouldn't there be pleasure of a pure, elevated kind in the realm of bliss? 

 -If you were to ask: Pleasure here [in this world is obtained] through dispelling pain 

and suffering, [but in the hereafter, there will be none]? 

 You  would  be  told:  Dispelling  pain  is  only  one  cause  of  pleasure.  Also,  it  is  not 

possible to compare the eternal realm and this world. Indeed, the garden of Horhor {[*]: 

Nursi's  medrese  in  Van,  at  the  foot  of  the  citadel.  The  onomatopoeic  name  recalls  the 

bubbling stream that ran through its garden.} here is to the lofty gardens of Paradise, what 

the [paintainted] pleasures of this world are to the pleasures of the hereafter. However 

superior Paradise is to the garden here, its pleasures are superior to the same extent. Ibn 

'Abbas (May Allâh be pleased with him) alluded to this vast difference when he said: "The 

only thing in Paradise will be their names." {[*]: "The only thing in this world from Paradise 

is the Names." (Or something similar.) See, Ibn Kathir, i, 63; Ibn Taymiyya, Fatawa, iii, 28; 

Ibn Hajar, al-Matâlib al-'Aliyya, no: 4692. See, Nursi, Islhârât al-l'jâz [Ihsân Qasim], 196.} 

That is, the fruits of this world. 

 Regarding eternal life and perpetual pleasure, consider this: pleasure is only true 

pleasure if it is untouched by evanescence, for just as the dispelling of pain is pleasure or 

a  cause  of  it,  so  the  passing  of  pleasure  is  pain;  indeed,  even  to  imagine  its  passing  is 

painful.  In  fact,  the  poetry  of  'metaphorical'  lovers  all  consists  of  lamentations  at  such 

pain. The diwâns of these purveyors of a love that is not 'true' are nothing but their weeping 

and wailing at this pain, which arises from the imagined passing of the beloved. 

 Indeed, most temporary pleasures produce lasting pains when they disappear, and 

every time a person recalls them, regret surges up in him and he exclaims: "Alas! Alack!", 

cursing this pain of the spirit. Then most suffering yields lasting pleasure when it subsides, 

and every time the person thinks of his being saved from it, he exclaims: "Praise and thanks 

be to Allâh!", alluding to this immaterial bounty. 

 Yes, man was created for eternity and he can obtain true pleasure only from eternal 

things such as knowledge of Allâh, love, perfection, knowledge, and so on. 

 In Short: Pleasure and bounty are only pleasure and bounty if they are eternal. 

 

217 

 Now that you have seen the string, thread the phrases of the verses on it. 

 

#218 

 The phrase "But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness 

(Wa  bashshir  alladhîna  âmanû  wa  'amilû  al-sâlihât):"  when  the  Most  High  charged  the 

people  [with  worship],  and  proved  [the  Messenger's]  prophethood,  and  charged  the 

Messenger with conveying His commands - so that by giving the glad tidings [of Paradise] 

he would ensure they complied with the obligations, which entailed difficulties and the 

giving up of worldly pleasures - he was commanded both to warn and to convey the good 

news  of  Allâh  the  Most  High's  pleasure,  and  His  grace,  and  nearness,  and  of  everlasting 

happiness. 

 And the phrase "that theirs are gardens beneath which flow (anna lahum jannâtin 

tajri):" as was mentioned above, man's most essential need, since he has a body, is a place 

and a dwelling. The most beautiful places are those with plants and trees, and the most 

pleasant  are  those  with  pools  among  their  verdant  gardens,  and  the  most  splendid  are 

those that have abundant streams flowing among their trees and under their pavilions. This 

is why it says "beneath which rivers flow." 

After somewhere [to live] man's greatest need, the finest of physical pleasures, is 

food and drink. These are indicated by [the words] gardens and rivers. And the finest of 

sustenance is that which is familiar, so one may appraise the degree of its superiority over 

similar foods. And the most delicious are fruits, as long as they are varied. And the purest 

pleasure is from [fruits] that are known and picked from close by. But most delicious of all 

is knowing that they are the fruits of one's labours. This is why it says "Every time they 

are fed with fruits therefrom, they say: 'Why, this is what we were fed with before."' 

That is, in this world or before now. 

 The phrase "for they are given things in similitude (wa utû bihi mutashâbihan):" 

it says in a Hadith that they will be similar in form but different in taste. {[*]: See, al-

Mundhiri, al-Targhib wa'l-Tarhib, vi, 296-9: al-Ghazâlî, İhya 'Ulum al-Din (Cairo: Mu'assasa 

al-Halabi, 1968), iv, 669.} Hence, the verse indicates that the pleasure of fruits lies in their 

change and variation, and that perfect pleasure is when the person is served and [the fruit] 

is given to him. 

 The  phrase  "and  they  have  therein  companions  pure  (wa  la-hum  fi-hâ  azwâjun 

mutahharatun):" as you saw above [when describing] the string [for the verse's pearls], a 

person needs a wife, a companion, to dwell with, through whose eyes he may look and who 

 

218 

may see through his eyes, and whose love he may benefit from, this being the gentlest of 

the rays of divine mercy. Complete intimacy too is with her. 

 

#219 

 And the phrase "and they abide therein [for ever] (wa hum fi-hâ khâlidûn):" when 

a person encounters a bounty or delight, the first thing that occurs to him is "Is it going to 

continue or will it be spoiled by ceasing?" For this reason, [the Qur'an] indicates with the 

words "and they abide therein for ever" the completion of the bounty through its enduring 

in  Paradise,  and  it  and  his  wives  being  perpetual  there,  and  the  continuation  of  the 

pleasures and his benefiting from them for ever. 

 The positioning and relationships of the parts of the verse's phrases: 

 The phrase "But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness 

(Wa bashshir alladhîna âmanû wa 'amilû al-sâlihât):" 

 The [conjunction] "But (lit. And) (al-waw)" points to the warning that drips from the 

previous [verse], 

 "Give glad tidings (bashshir)" is a sign that Paradise is [purely] a favour of the Most 

High and not incumbent on Him, and moreover, that actions should not be on account of 

Paradise  [that  is,  in  the  hope  of  it].  And  [the  verb]  being  in  the  imperative  suggests: 

"Convey  it  as  though  you're  conveying  good  news!"  For  [the  Prophet]  was  charged  with 

communicating the message. 

 Then the use of "those who believe (alladhîna âmanû)" instead of the more succinct 

'the believers' (al-mu'minûn), alludes to the "who (believe in the Unseen) (alladhîna)" at 

the beginning of the sura so that the details given there may elucidate the brevity here. 

 The use of the perfect tense here in "believe and work (âmanû wa 'amilû)" although 

there [at the start of the sura] the imperfect is used for "believe (yu'minûn)" and "spend 

(yunfiqûn  )"  indicates  that  the  imperfect  is  appropriate  [in  connection  with]  praise  and 

encouragement, but that the perfect is suitable [in reference to] recompense and requital, 

for reward follows on after service. 

 The "and" of "and work..." indicates, due the mystery of dissimilarity, that contrary 

to [the assertions of] the Mu'tazilites, actions are not included in belief, and that belief 

without action is insufficient. While the word 'work' ('amal) signifies that the thing about 

which good tidings are given resembles recompense [though it is not]. 

 As for "righteousness (lit. good works) (al-sâlihât)" it is vague and concise. According 

to Shaikh Muhammad 'Abduh of Egypt, {[*]: Muhammad 'Abduh ibn Hasan Khayrullâh (1849-

1905). Graduated from al-Azhar University, and after coming under the influence of Jamal 

 

219 

al-Din al-Afghani began to work in the fields of kalâm, philosophy, and politics. Together 

they brought out the magazine al-'Urwat al-Wuthqâ in Paris. In 1899 he was appointed Mufti 

of Egypt and he applied himself to reforming al-Azhar, notably by founding a faculty of 

modern science and updating the curricula. His works included Tafs'ir al-Qur'an al-Karîm 

and  Risâla  al-Tawhid.  See,  İsârâtû'  1-İ'caz  [Abdûlmecid],  325-6;  Ishârât  al-l'jaz  [Ihsân 

Qasim], 198.} it has a general 

 

#220 

meaning here because people know perfectly well what good works are. But I say that in 

addition, it is thus since it looks to [the details given] at the start of the sura. 

 The  phrase  "that  theirs  are  gardens  beneath  which  rivers  flow  (anna  la-hum 

jannâtin tajrî min tahtihâ al-anhâr):" 

 Consider all the parts of this phrase: the confirmative "anna - that," the specifying 

"lam"  [of  "theirs  (la-hum)],"  the  precedence  of  "la-hum  theirs,"  the  plural  "gardens 

(jannât)" and its being indefinite and the mention of the flowing waters, the mention of 

"min"  and  "taht  -  beneath,"  the  specifying  [the  plural]  of  "rivers  (anhâr)"  and  its  being 

definite;  - like moisture trickling from all sides of the dry earth into a central pool, all 

these  parts  assist  and  respond  to  each  other  reinforcing  the  main  aim,  which  is  joy, 

pleasure, and requital. 

 [To explain:] "That (anna)" indicates that since the mind might be hesitant about 

the  stupendousness  of  the  thing  about  which  the  good  news  is  given,  it  needs  to  be 

corroborated. Also, it is characteristic of a context (maqâm) [inducing] joy that it repels 

ungrounded fears, for the least anxiety shatters the imagining and chases away the joy. It 

is also a sign that this is not a mere promise but an actual reality. 

 The "lam" of "la-hum - theirs" indicates particularity, ownership, and entitlement, 

[meaning that the thing about which good news is given] is exclusive [to the believers], 

and  is  theirs,  and  that  they  are  deserving  of  it,  which  perfects  [their]  pleasure  and 

augments [their] joy. Otherwise it would be like a king entertaining a pauper. 

 The  precedence  of  "theirs  (la-hum)"  indicates  that  among  the  people  it  is  [the 

believers] who are singled out for Paradise. [As a result], they observe the situation of the 

people of Hell, which will make apparent the value of paradisical pleasure. 

 The plural of "gardens (jannât)" indicates the [great] number of gardens or paradises 

and their various degrees proportionate to the [many] various degrees of actions. It is a 

sign too that every part of Paradise is a paradise, and infers also that whatever portion is 

allotted  to  a  person,  with  its  great  extent  it  will  seem  like  the  whole  of  Paradise; 

 

220 

[individuals] will not be herded together with their group [or community] to a [particular] 

place. 

 

#221 

 "Gardens  (jannât)"  being  indefinite  reads  out  to  the  minds  of  listeners:  "[The 

gardens] contain what no eye has seen, nor any ear heard, nor has occurred to the heart 

of man." {[*]: From Abu Huraira; see, al-Bukhârî, Muslim no: 2824; al-Tirmidhi no: 3195. 

See, Ishârât al-I'jâz [Ihsân Qasim], 199.} It also refers it to the listeners' minds so that they 

may  all  conceive  of  it  in  a  manner  they  find  pleasing.  Furthermore,  it  is  as  though  the 

indefinite is a substitute for "there will be there all that the souls could desire." (43:71) 

 "Flow  (tajrî):"  as  is  known,  the  most  beautiful  of  gardens  are  those  which  have 

water; and the most beautiful of these are those in which the water is flowing; and the 

most beautiful of these are those in which the flow of water is perpetual. Thus, the word 

"flow" conjures up the picture of continuously running water. 

 As for "beneath which (min tahtihâ)," you know that the most beautiful of running 

water is that which flows through plants and shrubs, gushing out pure and clear from the 

garden, and flowing gurgling beneath its pavilions and in many rivulets among the trees. 

"Beneath which" indicates these three [that is, the waters flowing beneath the gardens, 

the pavilions, and the trees], 

 "Rivers (al-anhâr):" running water in gardens is most beautiful if plentiful, and it is 

most pleasing if in the form of rivulets chasing each other, and if these are symmetrical 

they  increase  the  charm  and  beauty  of  that  part.  But  most  beautiful  of  all  is  when  the 

water is deliciously sweet and cold, as in the verse: "of waters incorruptible." (47:15) The 

plural form and use of the definite indicate the above. 

  

The  sentence  "Every  time  they  are  fed  with  fruits  therefrom,  they  say:  'Why, 

this is what we were fed with before' (kullamâ ruziqû minhâ nıin thamarâtin rizqan qâlû 

hâdhâ alladhî ruziqna min qablu):" 

 You  should  be  aware  that  the  parts  of  [this  sentence]  include  many  implied 

sentences [or phrases]. Since it is not tied to the preceding sentence (istinaf), it is the 

answer to an implied question, and this question is a mixture of eight successive questions. 

For when given the good news of such a lofty dwelling-place, it occurs to the listener: "Will 

there be food there or not?" And if there is food, where will it come from and how will it 

be obtained? And if it is to be obtained from the garden, what does it consist of? And if it 

is its fruits, do they resemble the fruit of this world? And if they do resemble it, do they 

 

221 

resemble each other? And if those fruits do resemble each other, are their tastes different? 

And if they are different, 

#222 

 

  

will they diminish [in number] when picked or will they be replaced [with new fruits]? And 

if they are replaced by others, will these continue to be food? And if they do continue, will 

those who eat them feel delight? And if they do feel delight, what will they say? 

If you have understood these questions, consider now how the Qur'an replies to them 

with the parts of the [above-mentioned] section of the verse: 

 The word "whenever (kullamâ)" indicates continuity and corroboration. 

 "They are fed (lit. they have been fed) (ruziqû)" being in the perfect tense indicates 

its realization. Also, it infers their being reminded by something similar, of the food of this 

world.  And  its  being  in  the  passive  mood  indicates  the  absence  of  any  difficulty  [in 

obtaining it] and their being served and its being given to them. 

 The choice of "with fruits therefrom (minhâ min thamarâtin)" rather than 'with their 

fruits' is in order to give certain answers to two of the abovementioned questions. 

 The indefiniteness of "fruits" makes it general and indicates that whichever of the 

fruits it is, it is sustenance. 

that they know, which assuages hunger. 

 And "sustenance (rizqan)" being indefinite indicates that it is not the sort of food 

 The word "they say (qâlû)" has the meaning of "they say to each other" [that is, the 

VIth form of the verb], which signifies their delight, wonder, and happiness. 

 The  phrase  "This  is  what  we  were  fed  with  before  (hâdhâ  alladhî  ruziqn  â  min 

qablu):" this being general [and unspecific] it comprises four meanings: 

 The First: "What we are fed with here is the good works [we performed] in the [last] 

world." The strong tie between actions and requital will as though cause the [good] actions 

[to be transformed] in the hereafter into embodied rewards. And they rejoice at this. 

 The Second: "We are fed here with the foods of the last world, but there is a vast 

difference between their tastes." And they feel wonder at this. 

 The Third: "This resembles what we ate previously, but though it is similar in form 

it is different in meaning since it combines the pleasures of familiarity [on the one hand] 

and variation and change [on the other]." And they delight in this. 

 

222 

 The Fourth: "Whatever we eat from the tree's branches is replaced instantaneously, 

as though with the one we had eaten." It is known from this that the [fruits] will never 

decrease. 

 

#223 

 Now  the  phrase  "for  they  are  given  things  in  similitude  (wa  utû  bihi 

mutashâbihan):" this is a parenthetical clause confirming and explaining the previous one, 

and is a summary and appendix of it. 

 The use of the passive mood in "they are given" indicates that they are served. 

 While "in similitude" alludes to the combining of two pleasures as you already know. 

 The  phrase  "and  they  have  therein  companions  pure  (wa  la-hum  fi-hâ  azwâjun 

mutahharatun):"  by  virtue  of  the  relationship  between  two  sentences  joined  by  a 

conjunction, the "and" [here] indicates that just as they are in need of dwellings for their 

bodies, so are they need a means of rest and tranquillity for their spirits. 

 "They  have  (la-hum)"  indicates  particularity  and  possession,  and  specifying  and 

restriction, and infers that besides their wives of this world they shall have houris, created 

specially for them. 

 And "therein (fi-hâ)" indicates that these wives will be worthy of Paradise and that 

their beauty will be proportionate to their elevated degree. Moreover, in this is a concealed 

sign that Paradise is adorned and decked out with them. 

 The word "pure (mutahharatun)" indicates that someone has cleansed and purified 

them, but don't suppose that anyone cleansed by the hand of power [can be described]! 

Its  being  a  transitive  verb  [the  IInd  form]  suggests  that  the  women  of  this  world  are 

cleansed and purified so they become as beautiful as houris, who are of themselves pure. 

 And the phrase "and they abide therein for ever (wa hum fi-hâ khâlidûn)" indicates 

that both themselves, and their wives, and the delights of Paradise, and all of Paradise,

are eternal.

 Behold, Allah does not disdain to propound a parable of a gnat, or of something 

[even] less than that. Now, as for those who believe, they know that it is the truth from 

their Lord and Sustainer - whereas those who reject faith say, 'What means Allah by this 

parable?' By it He causes many to go astray, and many He guides aright; but none does he 

cause thereby to go astray save those who forsake [the path] - * Who break Allah's covenant 

after it has been ratified, and cut asunder what Allah has bidden to be joined, and spread

 Consider this: there are three aspects to these verses also, that look to the word-

order [and positioning and relationships] (nazmiyya), and the meaning of all them looks to 

both the preceding verses and the succeeding ones, and to the Qur'an as a whole. 

Their positioning in respect of what follows them: 

 You should be aware that when the Qur'an gives examples of gnats and spiders and 

speaks of ants and date-palms, the Jews, dissemblers, and idolators see it as an opportunity 

to  oppose  [it],  and  ask  foolishly:  "Does  Allâh  the  Most  High  -  despite  His  sublimity  - 

condescend to speak of such lowly matters, which the people of excellence disdain even 

to mention?" So the Qur'an deals them a blow in the mouth with this verse. 

 Their positioning with regard to with what precedes them: 

 Through  its  miraculousness  and  inimitability  the  Qur'an  proves  [Muhammad's] 

prophethood;  and  by  challenging  [its  opponents]  it  proves  its  miraculousness  and 

inimitability; and by their silence it proves [the success of] its challenges; and it proves at 

the start of the sura that it possesses elevated qualities not found together in other speech. 

[Thus it defeats its opponents who] remain silent in the face of its challenges, with not 

even their feelings of tribal solidarity being aroused. However, using false arguments they 

object to one [aspect] of the Qur'an's perfection, saying that such parables as "their parable 

is that of people who kindle..." (2:17) and "or [the parable] of a violent cloudburst in the 

sky..."(2:19) are about commonplace matters and lower the level of the language putting 

it on a par with the conversation of ordinary people. So the Qur'an raps them on the head 

with this verse, dazing them. 

of which are a number of fallacies: 

 An explanation of this: their frail doubts arise from a string of delusions, the source 

 The  First  is  a  false  analogy  the  source  of  which  is  their  seeing  everything  in  the 

mirror of what they are familiar with. For they see a person whose mind is partial, whose 

thought is partial, whose speech is partial, whose hearing is partial, and who cannot attend 

to two matters at once, and they know that the criterion for his aspirations is the thing he 

is preoccupied with and attaches importance to. They consider that worth and greatness 

are proportionate to ambition and cannot ascribe lowly, inferior matters to a lofty, august 

person, for they assume that he would not stoop to bothering himself with such things nor 

go  to  great  lengths  concerning  paltry  matters.  With  this  false  view  they  look  to  the 

Necessary One (May He 

 

 

225 

#226 

things?" 

be exalted) and say: "How in His sublimity and glory does He condescend to speak with 

men and converse in their way and to talk of trifling matters, especially these contemptible 

 Do these foolish people not understand that the will, knowledge, and power of Allâh 

the Most High are universal, general, all-embracing, and comprehensive, and that the only 

measure  for  His  sublimity  is  His  works  in  their  totality,  and  that  the  only  scale  for  His 

manifestations  is  His  words  which,  if  all  the  seas  were  ink  for  them,  would  never  be 

exhausted. For example, "And Allâh's is the highest similitude" (16:60) if the light of the 

sun - assuming it possessed will and intelligence - were to fall on a dusty atom, could you 

ask it: "How with all your glory can you stoop to busy yourself with this atom?" 

 Yes, just as Allâh the Most High created the world and made it with the utmost art 

and perfection, going to great lengths with it, so too He creates the minutest particle and 

fashions it with the greatest precision and art. In the view of [divine] power there is no 

difference between a minute particle and the planets, for the power, knowledge, will, and 

speech of the Most High are necessary inherent qualities. They are unchanging, and can 

neither  increase  nor  decrease,  nor  have  degrees,  which  would  cause  them  to  vary.  For 

being  the  opposite  [of  power],  impotence  cannot  intervene  in  it.  There  is  therefore  no 

difference [for it] between an atom and the sun. For contingent beings are equal in regard 

to existence and non-existence like some scales with two pans: if they hold two suns or 

two atoms, it takes no more power to raise one and lower the other. In just the same way, 

creatures  are  equal  in  the  face  of  [divine]  power,  which  is  necessary  and  essential.  So 

there  can  be  no  comparison  between  it  and  the  power  of  contingent  beings,  which  is 

accidental and varies on the intervention of impotence. 

 In  Short:  Minute  particles  and  lowly  matters  are  creatures  of  the  Most  High,  and 

necessarily known by Him, so indisputably and self-evidently He will speak about them. It 

is due to this mystery that He says: "Should He not know, He that created? And He is the 

One that understands the finest mysteries [and] is well-acquainted [with them]." (67:14) 

How should the One who knows [them] not mention them or speak of them, since He is the 

Mighty, the Wise? 

  

The Second Fallacy 

 

 

 They claim that they see in the Qur'an's style an effigy of man behind the Speaker, 

by reason of its mentioning insignificant things and common-place 

226 

#227 

 

matters in the manner of human discussions. But do these people who close their eyes [to 

the truth] not know that speech looks to the speaker in [only] one respect, and to the one 

addressed in several, as is required by eloquence, which is [to speak] in accordance with 

[the understanding] of the one addressed. Thus, since the one addressed is man, and what 

is discussed is his circumstances, and the aim is to ensure that he understands it, the Qur'an 

assumes  the  garb  of  human  style,  blended  with  human  emotions  and  called  "divine 

condescension to the minds of men," to put man's mind at rest. You surely know that when 

you speak with a child, you have to speak in childish language. 

 -If  you  were  to  ask:  Aren't  the  triviality  and  baseness  of  things  opposed  to  the 

sublimity of [divine] power and purity of [divine] speech? 

 You  would  be  told:  Their  insignificance,  lowliness,  ugliness  and  so  on  are  only  in 

regard to their outer face (mulk) and the face that looks to us and appears to our superficial 

view. Apparent causes have been put to act as intermediaries in this aspect, to absolve 

divine sublimity [of any fault]. However, the inner face of things (malakûtiyyat al-ashyâ') 

is entirely translucent and exalted. This aspect is the locus of [divine] power, and there is 

nothing  outside  it.  Thus,  on  the  one  hand  [divine]  sublimity  necessitates  the  placing  of 

causes  outwardly,  and  on  the  other  unity  and  dignity  demand  that  power  and  speech 

encompass all things. However, a Qur'an written in minute particles on an atom is no less 

eloquent than a Qur'an written in the ink of the stars on the page of the heavens. And the 

creation of a gnat is of no lesser art than the creation of an elephant. Thus, [divine] speech 

is the same as [divine] power. 

parables? 

 -If you were to ask: What then does the apparent insignificance refer to in these 

 You would be told: It refers not to the one relating the parables but to the ones 

portrayed, and the closer the parables are to the things portrayed the better they are and 

the higher the level of speech and the more elevated the order of the eloquence. Surely 

you  know  that  if  a  king  gives  his  shepherd  some  suitable  clothes  and  throws  a  dog  an 

appetizing bone, and so on, it cannot be said that what he has done is an innovation (bid'a) 

[that is, out of place]; it would be said rather that he had done the best [possible] by giving 

each  what  was  appropriate.  So  however  insignificant  the  thing  portrayed,  its 

representation is similarly insignificant, and however great it is, its representation is thus. 

Since idols are the very least of things, Allâh sets gnats to pester them. And since worship 

of them is the most worthless of things, Allâh portrays it as a spider's web. 

 

227 

#228 

 The Third Fallacy 

incapable of setting forth reality?" 

 They  ask:  "What  need  is  there  for  such  parables,  which  infer  that  [the  Qur'an]  is 

 The Answer: Since the purpose of the Qur'an's revelation is to guide the masses and 

they are ordinary people, and ordinary people cannot understand sheer truths and abstract 

ideas stripped of their imaginings, in His grace and beneficence Allâh the Most High clothed 

the truths in the garments of things familiar to them, to make them more palatable. You 

have seen this in the discussion about the allegorical verses [in verse 23]. 

 The positioning [and relationships] of the verses' phrases: 

 The phrase "Behold, Allâh does not disdain to propound a parable of a gnat, or 

of  something  [even]  less  than  that  (Inna  Allâha  lâ  yastahyî  an  yadriba  mathalan  mâ 

ba'ûdatan fa-mâ fawqahâ)" refutes and rejects [their] string of objections. It is as though 

they are asking: 

 "What is the reason ( hikma) Allâh the Most High speaks with men, and reproaches 

them and complains about them, for it is a sign that they too have the power to act in the 

world?  -  Especially  if  [His  speech]  resembles  the  conversations  people  hold  among 

themselves, doesn't it infer it is human speech? And especially if man's image is apparent 

behind the speech? And especially if [He speaks in the form of] allegories and parables, for 

this infers the inability to depict reality? And especially if the parables are commonplace, 

for this is a sign that the speaker's mind is limited? And especially if they [depict] trifling 

things, for this indicates the speaker's frivolity? And especially if they are things that do 

not have to be mentioned and it would be better to avoid? And especially if some are things 

self-respecting  people  would  not  stoop  to  speak  of?  And  especially  if  the  speaker  is 

someone  grand  and  important?  So  the  Qur'an  replies  and  demolishes  this  chain  from 

beginning to end with a single blow. It declares: "Allâh does not disdain..." For the inner 

face [of things] (malakûtiyya) is not contrary to His grandeur and glory, and He neglects or 

omits  nothing.  Godhead  necessitates  this.  Hence  He  portrays  insignificant  things  [to 

express]  insignificant  meanings,  for  wisdom  and  true  (lit.  the  mystery  of)  eloquence 

necessitate this. And hence He propounds commonplace parables since they are conducive 

to education and guidance. And hence He depicts truths by means of parables since this is 

necessitated  by  divine  grace  and  condescension.  And  hence  He  chooses  to  speak  in  the 

manner of human conversation since this is necessitated by dominicality (rubûbiyya)

and the order [of things]. 

and instruction. And hence He speaks with the people since this is demanded by wisdom 

 In Short: When Allâh the Most High deposited the faculty of will (Juz' ikhtiyâri) in 

man and made him the source (masdar - lit. verbal noun, infinitive) of the world of actions, 

He sent His word (kalâm) in order to set that world in order. 

 The positioning [with respect to the preceding phrase] of the phrase "Now, as for 

those who have attained to faith, they know that it is the truth from their Lord and 

Sustainer (fa-ammâ alladhîna âmanû faya'lamûna annahû al-haqq min rabbihim):" 

 With this phrase [the Qur'an] points out the way to prove the statement made by 

the previous one. It alludes too to the way to repulse ungrounded fears. That is, whoever 

looks with the light of belief, and from the point of view of Allâh the Most High and His 

power, bearing in mind His wisdom, grace, and dominicality, will know that this is [the 

parables are] true and [in conformity with] eloquence. But the person who looks from the 

depths  of  his  soul  and  from  the  point  of  view  of  contingent  beings  is  bound  to  attract 

delusions. This resembles two people who went up hill and down dale till they encountered 

a number of streams. One of them continued uphill and came to the spring. He tasted the 

water and found it clear and fresh. [He then descended and] whenever he came across a 

small piece of water from the tributaries of the streams he knew it to be good, though this 

was on the slightest evidence, and no delusions could mislead him however powerful. The 

other man, however, went downhill and sought the water from the tributaries. He did not 

[climb to or] see the spring and therefore needed strong evidence so as to know from the 

small  amounts  of  water  he  encountered  whether  or  not  each  bit  was  good.  The  least 

suspicion cast him into doubt. Or it resembles two people between whom is a mirror: one 

of them looks at the transparent glass, and the other at its coloured back. 

In Short: When observing the art of the Most High one has to look from His point of 

view (min jânibihi) and noticing His grace and dominicality. This is to look with the light 

of  belief,  while  delusions  -  even  the  most  powerful  of  them  -  become  flimsier  than  a 

spider's web. But if one looks at [divine art] from the point of view of contingent beings, 

with the narrow view of a customer, frail delusions will grow powerful in his sight and the 

truth will be hidden from him, just like a gnat's wing may prevent the eye seeing Mount

kafarû):" 

 The positioning of the phrase "whereas those who reject faith (wa ammâ alladhîna 

 Having pointed out the way to understand the wisdom in the parables, which is to 

look with the light of belief from the point of view of the Necessary Existent, it explains 

here the opposite way, which is the source of delusions and distractions. This is because it 

looks from the side of the soul, through the darkness of unbelief, which imagines everything 

to  be  dark,  and  with  a  sickness  of  the  heart  that  causes  even  the  slightest  delusion  to 

become oppressive. Then [such a person] strays from the path of truth, then he vacillates, 

then he starts to ask questions, and then he denies. So concisely and allusively, indicating 

[the disbelievers'] questioning that smacks of denial, the Qur'an says, "'What could Allâh 

mean by this parable?' (mâdhâ arâda Allâhu bi-hâdhâ mathalan)" instead of 'they do not 

know,' although clearly this would have corresponded to [the "they know" in] the previous 

phrase. 

 The positioning of the phrase "By it He causes many to go astray, and many He 

guides aright (yudillu bihi kathîran wa yahdî bi-hi kathîran):" 

 This is the answer to [the unbelievers'] question [in the previous phrase]. For to be 

exceedingly concise, it makes the result [of the parable; that is, guidance and misguidance] 

the ultimate reason for it (al-'illa al-ghâ'iyya), [that is, guidance and misguidance are not 

the underlying reason for the parable; its purpose is to admonish and offer guidance to the 

people] and they are asking: "Why is it like that? Why isn't its miraculousness obvious? Why 

doesn't  it  have  to  be  Allâh's  word?  Why  does  it  provide  the  opportunity  for  doubts  and 

delusion through these parables?" So the Qur'an [dispels all these questions] saying: "By it 

He causes many to go astray, and many He guides aright." 

 This is because [the Qur'an] increases in light those who ponder over [the parables] 

in the light of belief, while it increases in darkness those who ponder over them in the 

darkness of disbelief [with a view to] criticizing them. And this is because [the Qur'an] is 

theoretical (nazarî) and not obvious (badîhî). And this is so that elevated, pure spirits may 

be distinguished from lowly turbid ones. And this is so that eminent dispositions may be 

differentiated through their progress from wicked ones. And this is so that sound natures 

may be picked out through their development, striving, and exertion from among corrupted 

rotten ones. And this necessitates man's examination. And this requires his being tested 

and tried. And this demands his accountability due to the obligations laid on him (al-taklîf), 

to perfect him and his happiness. How concisely the Qur'an replies! 

 

 

230 

#231 

 -If  you  were  to  ask:  You  say  that  the  obligations  laid  on  human  beings  and  their 

accountability  are  to  secure  their  happiness,  but  they  are  the  reason  for  most  of  them 

being wretched. If it hadn't been for this accountability there wouldn't have been such an 

enormous difference between people? 

 You would be told: Just as Allâh the Most High entrusted man with the faculty of 

will (al-juz' al-ikhtiyârî) and charged him (al-taklîf) through it (lit. through its acquisition 

- bi-kasbihi) to form the world of voluntary actions; so too He made this obligation the 

means of watering the unlimited seeds planted in the human spirit and their germination. 

If  it  were  not  for  that  obligation  those  seeds  would  not  sprout.  If  you  study  the  history 

(ahwâl) of mankind deeply, you will see that all advances of the [human] spirit, and divine 

perfecting of the conscience, and progress of the intellect, and the productive advances 

in  thought  which  are  so  great  as  to  be  astounding,  have  occurred  only  due  to  man's 

accountability, and [those faculties] being awakened by the sending of prophets, and the 

fecundation of religious laws, and the inspiration of the religions. Had it not been for them 

human beings would have remained as animals and those perfections of the conscience and 

moral virtues would have been non-existent. A minority accepted the responsibility [and 

undertook  the  obligations]  voluntarily  and  they  both  won  happiness  for  themselves  and 

were the means of the happiness of the human race. As for the majority, quantitatively, 

even though they may have disbelieved in their hearts and in those areas in which they 

were  free,  since  not  every  attitude  and  attribute  of  every  disbeliever  arises  from  his 

disbelief,  because  the  prophets  aroused  the  sensibilities  of  the  human  conscience  and 

awakened  its  moral  sense,  the  sacred  laws  [they  brought]  have  been  heeded  and  their 

works are known, [and the majority] has willy-nilly accepted some of the obligations [with 

which man is charged], 

 -If  you  were  to  say:  How  can  happiness  for  the  few  and  wretchedness  for  the 

majority  be  happiness  for  the  human  race,  that  the  Shari'a  may  be  a  mercy?  For  the 

happiness of the human race could be [attained] only through [the happiness] of all or [at 

least] the majority. 

 You would be told: If you have a hundred eggs and you put them under a hen, and 

twenty hatch and eighty do not, wouldn't you say that you had brought the species up to 

full-strength?  For  twenty  living  chicks  are  equal  to  thousands  of  eggs.  Or  if  you  have  a 

hundred date stones and you [plant and] water them, and twenty become towering date 

palms while eighty rot, wouldn't you say that the water was happiness for the species? Or 

if you 

 

231 

#232 

have some metal ore and you smelt it and one fifth becomes gold and the rest turns to 

dross and ashes, isn't the fire the means of its perfection and excellence (lit. happiness)? 

You can make further examples in the same way. Consequently, it is only through striving 

that  elevated  sensibilities  unfold  and  [high]  morals  develop,  and  it  is  only  through  the 

confrontation of opposites and competition that things are perfected. You surely know that 

if a government or state exerts itself its courage grows, but if it gives up striving its courage 

expires. [That is, if it abandons jihad, it loses its courage and enterprise.] Reflect on this! 

 Now the positioning of the phrase "but none does he cause thereby to go astray 

save those who forsake [the path] (wa mâ yudillu bi-hi illâ alfâsiqîn):" 

 Because of the vagueness of the [previous] phrase, "He causes many to go astray," 

this one alerts the listener's mind, and perturbed, he asks: "Who are these people who go 

astray? What is the reason? And how can darkness come from the light of the Qur'an?" So 

[the Qur'an] answers: "[They go astray] because they are depraved and have deviated from 

the right path (al-fâsiqûn). Misguidance is the penalty for their depravity. And because of 

it  the  light  becomes  fire  for  them,  and  the  brightness,  darkness."  You  surely  know  that 

sunlight putrefies filth. 

 [Various]  aspects  [of  sinfulness,  depravity  (fisq)]  are  described  in  [the  following 

verse]: "Who break Allâh's covenant after it has been ratified, and cut asunder what 

Allâh has bidden to be joined, and spread corruption on earth (Alladhîna yanqudûna 

'ahd Allâhi min bad mithâqihi wa yaqta'ûna mâ amara Allâhu bi-hi an yûsala wa yufsidûna 

fi al-ard):" 

 This elucidates and spells out [what] depravity [consists of], for it is a renunciation 

of truth and to exceed the limits and quit the hard shell [of right-guidance]. It is either 

excess (al-ifrât) or deficiency (al-tafrît) in the three powers of intellect, anger, and animal 

appetites. And excess and deficiency lead to rebellion in the face of the evidences that 

are like the divine covenants (al-'uhûd) in creation (al-fitra). They also lead to sickness in 

personal  life;  the  first  attribute  [in  the  above  verse]  indicates  this.  So  too  they  incite 

rebellion in the face of social life and break the bonds and laws of society. The second 

attribute indicates this. They also cause corruption and revolution, which spoil the order 

of the earth, as indicated by the third attribute. Yes, when his intellect exceeds the bounds 

of moderation the depraved person breaks the bonds of the tenets of belief and smashes 

their strong shell, that is, eternal life. And when his power of anger oversteps the

al-khâsirûn):" 

mark he smashes the shell of social life. And when his power of animal appetites exceeds 

the limits and he follows his desires, compassion for his fellow humans vanishes from his 

heart and he corrupts the people and makes difficulties for them in whatever he becomes 

involved in, and causes harm to the human race and spoils the order of the earth. 

 The positioning of the phrase: "these it is that shall be the losers (ûla ika humu 

 Having  mentioned  the  crimes  of  the  depraved  and  scared  them,  [the  Qur'an] 

reinforces its threat [by mentioning] their ends and punishment, so as to scare them more 

effectively.  And  it  says:  "They  make  a  loss  by  trading  the  hereafter  for  this  world  and 

exchanging guidance for their own caprices." 

 Now  let's  begin  [analyzing]  the  positioning  [and  relationships]  of  the  phrases' 

 Consider this: the verses and their phrases and parts resemble the hands of a clock 

that  show  the  seconds,  the  minutes,  and  the  hours.  If  one  proves  one  thing,  another 

corroborates it to its own extent, and the other assists it as far as it can. Similarly, if this 

one wants something, that one helps, and the other aids it in such a way that it recalls the

 It is by virtue of this mystery that the Qur'an's fluency and its pre-eminent level and 

the fineness of its embroideries reach the degree of miraculousness. 

 The parts of the phrase: "Behold, Allâh does not disdain to propound a parable 

of  a  gnat,  or  of  something  [even]  less  than  that  (Inna  Allâha  lâ  yastahyi  an  yadriba 

mathalan mâ ba'ûdatan fa-mâ fawqahâ):" 

 Consider this: the [particle] "Inna - Behold! (lit. indeed, verily)" is corroborative and 

[its purpose is] to dispel hesitation and rebut denial. So too it indicates the succession of 

vacillating [doubts] mentioned previously. 

the] comparison mentioned above. 

 The word "Allâh" is [used] to alert [the listener's] mind against the error of [making 

 The choice of "does not disdain (lit. is not ashamed to) (lâ yastahyî)" rather than 

'does not desist or refrain from,' - although shame (al-hayâ), which is a retraction of the 

self, is impossible in reference to the* Most High and it is futile to negate the impossible - 

indicates that since such things as wisdom, eloquence and so on necessitate a fine parable, 

there is no reason 

 

233 

#234 

to  refrain  [from  propounding  one]  except  shame,  and  since  shame  is  impossible  for  the 

Most High, there is absolutely no reason to refrain [from propounding one]. Thus, it silences 

[the unbelievers] most effectively and subtly. Moreover, it alludes by means of [the literary 

device by which similar forms express different meanings, called] mushâkala al-suhba, to 

the  foolish  words  they  were  saying:  "Isn't  Muhammad's  lord  ashamed  by  these  parables 

about trifling matters?" [That is, the Qur'an uses the expression they used in order to refute 

what they were saying.] 

 The choice of "to propound (an yadriba)" rather than 'of lowly parables,' although 

the latter would have been more appropriate, indicates a stylistic subtlety which is that a 

parable  resembles  striking  a  seal  in  order  to  affirm  and  authenticate  [something],  or 

minting  a  coin  to  set  the  value  and  credibility  [of  money].  And  this  suggests  that  fine 

parables and comparisons repel doubts and suspicions. Similarly, it indicates that parables 

are  a  well-known  and  valued  device,  for  propounding  examples  is  an  acknowledged 

method. 

 Furthermore, the choice of "to propound (an yadriba)" [which is in the imperfect 

tense] rather than [the verbal noun] 'darb' although this is more concise, is to indicate that 

the source of [the unbelievers'] objections is the triviality [of the thing represented in the 

parables, not the parables themselves, which are useful.] For being a verb, "to propound" 

is not independent [self-sufficient]; it seems insubstantial, so the mind (lit. aim, intention, 

goal]  passes  lightly  onto  the  object.  However,  because  [the  verbal  noun]  'darb'  is 

independent, it is dense and impedes the mind. 

 [The word] "a parable (mathalan)" alludes to the particular attribute of parables and 

allegories (al-tamthîl), which is to depict abstract things with concrete ones, and represent 

the imaginary with the real, and portray the hidden with the manifest. And this is a sign 

that they repel doubts and suspicions. 

 The indefiniteness of "a parable" indicates that what is noteworthy is the parable 

itself, not the character [it assumes through the thing it portrays], which is related to what 

is demanded by the context (al-maqâm) or the situation of the thing it depicts. 

 The generality of "what (lit. the parable of 'what' is a gnat) (mâ)" indicates that the 

rule [of parables] is a general one, so that the reply should not be [considered] particular 

to  their  objections;  [and  it  should  be  understood  that]  the  thing  depicted  will  take 

whatever  form  necessitated  and  deemed  appropriate  by  [the  science  of]  rhetoric 

(eloquence - al-balâgha). 

 

 

234 

#235 

 The specific [mention of] "a gnat (ba'ûdatan)" looks to the frequent parabolic use of 

them  by  the  masters  of  eloquence  (al-bulaghâ')  in  such  expressions  as:  "Smaller  than  a 

gnat." "Stubborner than a gnat." "He asked me for a gnat's brain." "Rarer than a gnat's brain." 

"The gnat told the bee: Hold on tight and I'll fly off!" "In Allah's sight the world is not equal 

to a gnat's wing." And so on. It also suggests the flimsiness of their doubts. 

 The meaning of "something [even] less than that. (lit. what is above, over, or more 

than) (mâ fawqahâ)" is what is smaller than it in size or what is of higher value according 

to eloquence, or what is lower in both value and size. Also the phrase infers that small 

things  are  more  remarkable  in  the  view  of  eloquence,  and  more  exquisite  in  [their] 

creation. 

together display a fine embroidery. 

 Consider this: the parts of these phrases are like silken threads which being brought 

 Now the parts of the sentence "Now, as for those who believe, they know that it 

is the truth from their Sustainer - whereas those who reject faith say, 'What could 

Allah  mean  by  this  parable?'  (Fa-ammâ  alladhîna  âmanû  fa-ya'lamûna  annahû  al-haqq 

min  rabbihim  wa  ammâ  alladhîna  kafarû  fa-yaqûlûna  mâdhâ  arâda  Allâh  bi-hâdhâ 

mathalan):" 

 Consider this: the [conjunction] "Fa- - Now" [expresses] the branching or ramification 

(al-tafrî')  [of  this  sentence  from  the  previous  one],  and  this  indicates  an  implied  proof 

which  yields  this  sentence  with  its  two  parts.  That  is,  [Allah]  does  not  refrain  from 

[propounding] parables because eloquence requires them, and people who are fair-minded 

know that they are eloquent, true, and Allah's word. While those who obstinately resist 

them do not know the wisdom [in them], so are hesitant and ask [about them], then deny 

[them], then they look on them as trifling. Consequently, since the believer is fair-minded 

he affirms that the parable is Allah's word while because the disbeliever is obdurate, he 

asks: "What's the use o this?" 

 Since "as for (ammâ)" expresses condition and necessity, [here] it indi cates that the 

predicate ["they know that it is the truth"] is the necessary consequence of the subject 

["those who believe"]; that is, the predicate [to know the truth] is characteristic of the 

subject [those who believe]. 

 The use of "those who believe (alladhîna âmanû)" instead of 'the believers' is a clear 

indication that belief is the reason they know it is the truth, just as knowing it to be the 

truth is belief. 

 

235 

 And the use of "that it is the truth (annahû al-haqq)" rather than 'that this is [most] 

eloquent,' although it would have been more apt in this 

 

#236 

context, alludes to the [logical] conclusion of their objections, for their purpose is to deny 

that [the Qur'an] is Allâh's word. 

 The  restriction  expressed  by  "that  it  is  the  truth  (annahû  al-haqq)"  [that  is,  that 

being right is restricted to that parable], is a sign that contrary to what they claim, it is 

[only] this [parable of the gnat] that is approved [by the science of rhetoric] and not found 

disagreeable.  [Accordingly,  another  metaphor  would  not  be  acceptable  even  if  free  of 

defect], for freedom from defect does not prove the perfection [of a thing]. 

 The  phrase  "from  their  Sustainer  (min  rabbihim)"  indicates  that  their  aim  and 

purpose is to deny [that the parable] is revealed [by their Sustainer], 

 The [conjunction] "as for (ammâ)" in "whereas (lit. as for) those who reject faith 

(lit.  disbelieve)  (wa  ammâ  alladhîna  kafarû)"  signifies  emphasis,  corroboration,  and 

particularization. 

 The  substitution  of  "those  who  reject  faith  (lit.  disbelieve)"  for  'the  disbelievers,' 

although the latter is more concise, infers that their denial arises from disbelief and leads 

to it, as has been mentioned. 

 And "[they] say (fa-yaqûlûna)" is used rather than 'but they do not know,' although 

as has been mentioned the latter is clearer, because to make allusion is more succinct; 

that is: the person who disbelieves does not know the truth and this causes him to waver, 

and this leads [firstly] to denial and then to asking disparaging questions. 

 Moreover,  "[they]  say"  infers  that  just  as  they  are  themselves  misguided,  so  with 

their words they lead others astray. 

 Now [the positioning and relationships of) the parts of the phrases "By it He causes 

many  to  go  astray,  and  many  He  guides  aright  (yudillu  bihi  kathîran  wa  yahdî  bi-hi 

kathîran):" 

 Consider this: here, the arrangement (al-tartîb) requires that the second [phrase] 

comes  first  [to  correspond  to  the  precedence  of  "those  who  believe"  previously  in  the 

verse], but since the aim is to refute the [disbelievers'] vacillating, questioning, repugnant 

objections that smack of denial, "He causes to go astray" is of greater importance. 

 The  non-use  of  the  verbal  nouns  'guidance'  and  'misguidance'  and  use  of  the 

imperfect  tense  of  the  verbs  indicates  that  the  darkness  of  their  disbelief  intensifies 

 

236 

proportionately  to  the  gradual  revelation  [of  the  Qur'an],  just  as  the  believers'  faith 

increases proportionately in luminosity. 

 Moreover, as the reply [to their question: "What means Allâh by this parable?], the 

verbal form suggests it is elucidating the situations of the two groups, and explaining [the 

choice of] the reasons [for them]. 

 

#237 

 As for "many (kathîran)," the first, [those who have gone astray], expresses quantity 

and number, while the second, [the rightly-guided], expresses quality and value. Yes, the 

generous and noble are numerous [due to their high worth] even if few [in number]. The 

second  "many"  is  also  an  allusion  to  the  mystery  of  the  Qur'an's  being  a  mercy  for 

humankind. Now dwell on this! 

 The phrase "but none does He cause thereby to go astray save those who forsake 

[the path] (wa mâ yudillu bi-hi illâ al-fâsiqîn):" 

 Consider  this:  by  explaining  here  who  the  misguided  are,  [the  Qur'an]  allays  the 

doubts, fear, and hesitation [given rise to by] the "many" above ["He causes many to go 

astray"],  and  rejects  the  accusation  that  the  Qur'an  is  defective.  [It  explains]  that  the 

source of their misguidance is their depravity, and that the cause of it is what they have 

done (kasbuhum), and that the faults are theirs not the Qur'an's, and that the creation of 

misguidance is punishment for their actions. Understand too that each of these phrases 

elucidates the one preceding it, and is expounded by the one following it, as though each 

is proof of the preceding and the consequence of the succeeding. 

 This may be clarified with two lines of reasoning: 

 The  first  is  this:  [Allâh]  does  not  disdain  (lit.  is  not  ashamed)  [to  propound  the 

parable],  because  He  does  refrain  [from  doing  this],  because  [the  parable]  is  eloquent, 

because it is the truth, because it is the word of Allâh, because the believer knows this. 

 The second is this: [Allâh] does not disdain [to propound the parable], as the deniers 

say, because they say He should refrain from it, because they do not know the wisdom in 

it, because they ask what use it is, because they deny it, because they deem it trifling, 

because they have fallen into misguidance through hearing it, because the Qur'an has led 

them astray, because in their wickedness they have exceeded the bounds, because they 

have  broken  Allâh's  covenant,  because  they  have  sundered  what  He  joined  through  His 

commands both in creation and in the Shari'a, because they spoil the divine order of the 

earth,  consequently  they  are  the  losers  both  in  this  world  by  reason  of  their  pangs  of 

conscience, anxious hearts, and desolate spirits, and in the hereafter due to the everlasting 

 

237 

torments and divine wrath that shall be visited on them. Ponder now over the fluency of 

these two sequences! 

 Now  the  parts  of  the  sentence  "Who  break  Allâh's  covenant  after  it  has  been 

ratified, and cut asunder what Allâh has bidden to be joined, and 

 

#238 

spread  corruption  on  earth  (Alladhîna  yanqudûna  'ahd  Allâh  min  ba'd  mithâqihi  wa 

yaqta'una mâ amara Allâh bi-hi an yûsala wa yufsidûna fi alard):" 

 Consider this: there is an elevated subtlety in this manner of describing here the 

depraved, who are doubtful about [the Qur'an's] miraculousness and word-order. It is as 

though the Qur'an is saying: "It's not at all unlikely that the depraved should be doubtful 

and ignorant about the miraculousness and inimitability of the Qur'an's order, for they can't 

see the miraculousness of divine power in the order of the universe, which is the greater 

Qur'an. For they look on the the universe's order as [occurring] by chance, and its fruitful 

changes as purposeless, so the instances of wisdom in it are concealed from them - since 

their spirits are corrupted. So too, because of their dissolute natures and their rotten folly, 

they consider the Qur'an's miraculousness to be a confused muddle and its preliminaries 

sterile and its fruits bitter." 

 The phrase "break Allâh's covenant (yanqudûna 'ahd Allâh):" 

 A  high  style  is  indicated  here  with  the  use  of  the  word  'al-naqd,'  which  means 

undoing the strands of a rope and breaking them, as though the covenant with the Most 

High were a luminous rope twisted with [divine] wisdom, grace, and will and stretching all 

the way from pre-eternity to posteternity. It is manifested in the universe in the form of 

[its] general order, and has sent out chains to all the species and realms [of beings] and 

extended the tips of them to the human race. In the human spirit it has bequeathed the 

legacy  of  the  seeds  of  [its]  potentialities  and  abilities,  which  are  watered  and  made  to 

thrive through the faculty of will, [when] regulated by the commands of the Shari'a; that 

is,  the  evidences  of  the  Qur'an  and  Sunna  (al-dalâ'il  al-naqliyya).  Thus,  the  covenant  is 

fulfilled  by  employing  those  abilities  as  they  should  be,  and  it  is  broken  by  doing  the 

opposite  and  undoing  [the  rope  and  spoiling  the  order],  like  believing  in  some  of  the 

prophets  and  denying  others,  and  accepting  some  precepts  and  rejecting  others,  and 

approving some verses and disapproving others. And this violates the order, arrangement, 

and regularity. 

 

 Now  the  phrase  "and  cut  asunder  what  Allâh  has  bidden  to  be  joined  (wa 

yaqta'ûna mâ amara Allâhu bi-hi an yûsala):" 

238 

 Consider  this:  the  command  here  embraces  legislative  (tashrî'î)  commands  and 

creational  (takwînî)  commands  both  of  which  are  included  within  the  natural  laws  (al-

qawânin  al-fitriyya)  and  the  laws  of  divine  practice  (al-'âdât  al-ilâhiyya).  So  sundering 

what the Shari'a commands to be 

 

#239 

joined means breaking off family relations and severing the bonds between the hearts of 

believers.  You  can  make  further  examples.  And  [sundering  what  is  joined  by  creational 

commands]  means  cutting  off  actions  from  knowledge,  and  separating  knowledge  from 

intelligence,  severing  intelligence  from  innate  abilities,  and  knowledge  of  Allâh  from 

reason,  and  labour  from  strength,  and  jihad  from  courage,  and  so  on.  For  the  giving  of 

strength  is  a  non-material  creational  command  (amr  ma'nawî  takwînî)  to  work,  and  the 

giving of intelligence is non-material creational command to learn. And so on. 

 The phrase "and spread corruption on earth (wa yufsidûna fî al-ard):" 

 Consider this: in accordance with [the saying] "the more general the calamities the 

pleasanter  they  become,"  a  person  who  becomes  depraved  and  gets  embroiled  in  the 

morass wants companions who are similarly embroiled so as to alleviate his terrible plight. 

Likewise, if [the idea of] revolution settles in someone's heart, it will lead to the ruin of 

its  perfections  and  attainments  and  its  high  sentiments  will  gradually  decline,  and  the 

desire to destroy will born in it. This will make him feel a pleasure at destruction, and he 

will seek the pleasure by spreading corruption and fomenting revolution. 

 

-If you were to ask: How can the whole earth, indicated by the word "on earth," be 

affected by the corruption of one depraved person? 

 You would be told: That which has order has balance; in fact, the order is based on 

balance. If even an insignificant thing disturbs the workings of a machine, the machine is 

affected by it. And a pair of scales holding two mountains in its pans is affected if only a 

walnut is placed on one of them. 

 Now the phrase "these it is that shall be the losers (ûlâ'ika humu alkhâsirûn):" 

 Consider this: this phrase should have been: "they are the losers since [they did not 

accept]  right-guidance  through  [the  Qur'an]."  [It  is  expressed  the  way  it  is  to  make  the 

following  points,  concerning:]  "these  (lit.  those)  (ûlâ'ika),"  and  "they  (hum),"  and  the 

definite article of "the losers," and its generality: 

 The purpose of "these (lit. those) (ûlâ'ika)" is to conjure up the idea of something 

palpable or perceptible (li-ihdâr al-mahsûs) and this indicates that when the listener hears 

 

239 

of their vile situation, it arouses his disgust and makes him angry at them. So he wants to 

picture them in his imagination in order to vent his anger and express his loathing, and to 

observe them as their terrible end is described. 

 

#240 

for their loss. 

 The  perceptibility  indicates  that  their  shameful  attributes  multiply  to  the  extent 

they are embodied palpably in the disgusted person's view. This also alludes to the reason 

 The distance [expressed by "these (lit. those) (ûlâ'ika)"] indicates that they are too 

far  from  the  way  of  truth  to  turn  back,  and  therefore  deserve  to  be  censured  and 

execrated, contrarily to those who repent and are within easy reach of return. 

 "They (hum)" indicates that the loss is restricted to them, and that if the believers 

suffer the loss of some worldly pleasures it is not loss, and that compared with their loss, 

the loss of some worldly people in their businesses is not loss [either]. 

 The definite article denotes [specific] facts and [classes of things]; that is, anyone 

who wants to see the truth about the losers should look at them. It is a sign too that their 

way [results in] pure loss, unlike other sorts of losses, which may contain aspects of gain; 

the harm is greater. For the definite article is [used] for [things that are] either total or 

self-evident, or to depict a [specific] fact. 

 The  generality  of  the  loss  [that  is,  its  not  being  defined]  indicates  [its 

comprehensiveness]; that is, they have lost by not remaining faithful to the covenant and 

breaching it; they have lost in [connection with] family relations by severing them, and in 

[connection with] reform by spreading corruption, and in [connection with] belief through 

disbelief, and in their wretchedness they have lost eternal happiness.

 How can y u refuse to acknowledge Allâh seeing that you were lifeless and He gave 

you life; then will He cause you to die, and then will bring you again to life; and again to 

Him will you return. (Kayfa takfurûna bi'llâhi wa kuntum amwâtan fa-ahyâkum thumma 

yumîtukum thumma yuhyîkum thumma ilayhi turja'ûn.) 

 As  in  the  previous  verses,  the  positioning  and  word-order  of  this  verse  has  three 

The positioning of this verse's meaning in relation to what precedes it. 

 Consider this: Allâh the Most High, having called on the people to worship Him and 

believe  in  Him,  and  having  indicated  the  fundamental  beliefs  and  the  injunctions 

[pertaining  to  action]  and  having  mentioned  their  evidences  summarily,  resumes  [the 

discussion] in this verse and the three subsequent ones by setting out evidences for them 

and enumerating the bounties that the evidences comprise. The greatest of these bounties 

is life, indicated by this verse. The continuance of life (al-baqâ), that is, life made perfect 

and complete through the ordering of the heavens and the earth, is indicated by the second 

verse. Man's superiority and ennoblement over all beings is indicated by the third verse, 

and his being taught knowledge [is stated] by the fourth. 

 In  respect  of  their  form,  these  bounties  are  a  proof  of  [divine]  providence  and 

purpose (dalîl al-'inâya wa'l-ghâya), so too they are proof of [the obligation of] worship. 

For  it  is  obligatory  to  thank  the  Bestower  of  Bounties,  while  reasonably  ingratitude  is 

proscribed (harâm). In respect of reality, [these bounties] are a proof that things are given 

existence out of nothing (dalîl ikhtirâ'i) 

[and thus] of the first creation and the resurrection of the dead (al-mabda' wa'l-ma'âd). 

Furthermore, just as this verse looks to the preceding ones, so it looks to the earlier ones 

that discuss the disbelievers and dissemblers. It infers with its amazed rhetorical question 

that it is hitting them over the head, and condemning, threatening, and intimidating them. 

#242 

 

241 

ٰ
 The positioning [and relationships] of the verse's phrases: 

 Know that here, [the Qur'an] turns from the use of the third person [in the previous 

verses]  to  the  second  person,  for  previously  it  was  quoting  [the  disbelievers],  now  it  is 

addressing  them.  This  is  to  make  a  point  wellknown  in  eloquence,  which  is  that  if  one 

describes a person's iniquities bit by bit, a feeling of anger mounts in [the listener] till if 

[truly]  human  he  feels  compels  to  speak  with  the  person  face  to  face.  Similarly,  if  one 

mentions someone's virtues little by little, the desire to speak with him grows [gradually] 

stronger till one turns to him and addresses him directly. {[*]: This device called 'iltifat' is 

widely used in Arabic. See, İsârâtû'l-icaz [Abdûlmecid], 253.} Thus, since the Qur'an was 

revealed in the styles and modes [of speech] of the Arabs, it turns to [the disbelievers] and 

addresses [them directly] saying: "How can you refuse to acknowledge Allâh? (lit. how can 

you disbelieve in Allâh?)" 

 Know too that since the aim here is to set out the proofs of the fundamental matters 

mentioned  above,  including  belief  and  worship,  and  to  refute  disbelief  and  prevent 

ingratitude for bounties; and since the clearest evidences are those derived from the chain 

of human circumstances, and the greatest bounties are those hanging in the stem of that 

sequence and found in its nodes; it says: "seeing that you were lifeless and He gave you 

life; then will He cause you to die, and then will bring you again to life; and again to Him 

will you return." This indicates the wondrous interlinked sequence, which has five nodes, 

from the stem of which hang the bunches of bounties. We shall now set out five matters 

to decipher those nodes. 

  

The  First  Matter  is  about  "seeing  that  you  were  lifeless  (wa  kuntum  amwatân)." 

While physically man consists of lifeless particles [once] scattered through the world, you 

see that they are brought under a particular law and specific order. Then, while they are 

hidden and silent in the world of the elements you notice that they are transposed to the 

world of animate beings through a specific rule and order which betoken purpose and 

 

#243 

 

wisdom. Then, while scattered through that world, you observe that they group together 

in  extraordinary  fashion  and  become  sperm.  Then  through  a  series  of  revolutions  they 

become clinging blood-clots, then lumps of flesh, then flesh and bone, and so on and so 

forth. Although in each of these stages [the particles] are more perfect than in the previous 

one, they are relatively dead and lifeless compared to the subsequent one. 

242 

 -If you were to ask: Death is the absence of life and its cessation, and [the particles] 

 You would be told: Death here is metaphorical, to prepare the mind to accept the 

had no life that it should cease? 

third and fourth 'nodes'. 

  

The Second Matter, concerning "and He gave you life (fa-ahyâkum)." Consider this: 

life is the most wondrous and subtle miracle of [divine] power. It is also the greatest of all 

bounties and the clearest of all proofs of the first creation and the resurrection of the dead 

(al-mabda' wa'l-ma'âd). 

 Its finest and most obscure aspect is this: the lowest form of life is plant life, and 

its first level is the awakening of the embryo or vital cells (al-'uqdat al-hayâtiyya) in the 

seeds. Despite being so obvious, widespread, and familiar, this awakening has remained a 

mystery to human science from the time of Adam till the present. 

 The aspect of its being the supreme bounty: The only relations a lifeless body has 

are with the place it is located and the things that befall it; it is single, alone, even if a 

mountain. But you see that the moment life enters a tiny body like a bee, the bee can form 

relations with the whole  universe and may do trade with all species [of  beings]. It may 

then say: "The universe is my home and it's just like my property." For on passing to the 

level of animal life, you see that it roams with its senses and by means of them has disposal 

over [other beings] in all parts of the universe. Particular relations, commerce, and love 

are established between it and other species [of beings]. Especially if it rises to the level 

of human life, you see that it travels through the worlds through the light of intellect. It 

has  disposal  over  the  corporeal  world  and  roams  in  the  spiritual  world  and  makes 

peregrinations through the world of similitudes. And as it journeys to those worlds, so they 

travel to him by being reflected in the mirror of his spirit. He then has the right to say: 

"The world was created for me through the grace of Allâh the Most High!" Thus, his life 

becomes multiform and expands [to include] physical life, and moral life, corporeal life, 

and spiritual life, each of which embraces many levels. In fact, it might well be said that 

just  as  light  makes  colours  and  bodies  visible,  so  life  reveals  beings  and  makes  them 

evident. 

#244 

 

 

 It is life that makes an atom a world. And it is life that is the means of all the world 

being bestowed on every living being individually, and this without confusion or division 

except for a small minority of human beings. 

243 

 The aspect of life that is the clearest proof of both the Maker and the resurrection 

of the dead. Consider this: the transference and spontaneous change of a number of lifeless 

particles from one situation and grouping to another opposing one without the intervention 

of any reasonable cause, is a decisive proof. Indeed, by its nature life is the purest and 

most sublime truth. In neither its outer (al-mulk) aspect nor its inner (al-malakût) aspect 

is  there  any  soil  or  blemish,  for  both  are  subtle.  In  fact,  the  lowest  most  insignificant 

animate being is also exalted. It is due to this mystery that no apparent cause intervenes 

between life and the hand of power, for [the latter's] contact is not contrary to its dignity, 

although as has been stated previously, apparent causes are [otherwise] placed to preserve 

the  dignity  of  divine  power  from  contact  with  things  that  to  the  superficial  view  are 

inferior. 

 You have already heard about that aspect of life which forms the clearest proof of 

the first creation and the resurrection of the dead, so here we shall just summarize it for 

you: whoever studies life and follows the progressive elementary stages of the body, will 

see the parts dispersed through the world of atoms. Then he will observe that they have 

been clothed in another form in the world of the elements. Then he will encounter them 

in the world of animate beings in another situation. Then he will meet them in sperm, then 

in a blood clot, then as a lump of flesh. Then he will see that they have suddenly assumed 

a  form  in  the  midst  of  these  transformations.  He  will  observe  that  throughout  these 

revolutions  [they  follow]  regular  motions  according  to  specific  laws,  from  which  it  is 

apparent that each particle was programmed at the first stage and as though charged with 

the duty of travelling to a suitable position in a living body. The person grasps with his 

mind that it is intentionally driven and purposively sent. Now the second life will appear 

to him far easier, simpler, and more possible [than the first], and he will feel convinced in 

his heart. 

 Thus, this phrase, "and He gave you life" is a proof of the following one, "then will 

He cause you to die," and both together they form a proof in the face of the denial implied 

by "how? (kayfa)" [in this verse, 2:28]. 

  

The Third Matter, regarding "then will He cause you to die." 

 Consider this: the verse "He who created death and life" (67:2) shows that death is 

not annihilation and absolute non-existence; it is rather an act, 

 

 

 

 

244 

#245 

a change of abode, and the spirit's liberation from its place of confinement. Moreover, the 

innumerable signs and tokens human beings have witnessed up to the present have planted 

in their minds the conviction and surmise that after death man is immortal in one respect, 

and what has immortality is his spirit. Thus, the existence of this inherent property in an 

individual  is  evidence  of  its  existence  in  the  race  as  a  whole,  because  it  is  essential. 

Consequently [in accordance with the rule of logic], the particular proposition necessitates 

the universal one. Hence, death is a miracle of [divine] power the same as life is; it is not 

non-existence caused by the absence of the conditions of life. 

 -If you were to ask: How can death be a bounty, threaded [with others] on the string 

 

of bounties? 

 You would be told: 

 Firstly: Because it is the introduction to everlasting happiness, and the introduction 

to  something  is  like  the  thing  itself,  whether  good  or  bad.  For  whatever  the  obligatory 

depends on is obligatory, and whatever leads to the proscribed is proscribed. 

 Secondly: And because according to investigative scholars among the Sufis, for the 

individual person it means being saved from what seems to be a prison filled with vicious 

animals and [being taken to] a broad plain. 

otherwise suffer appalling wretchedness. 

 Thirdly:  And  because  for  human  beings  it  is  the  supreme  bounty,  for  they  would 

 Fourthly: And because according to some people it is a sought-after bounty, for due 

to his weakness and impotence [man] cannot bear the burdensome responsibilities of life 

and the pressures of its tribulations and the pitilessness of the elements. Death for such 

people is a door [through which they may] escape. 

 The Fourth Matter, regarding "and then will bring you again to life." 

 Consider this: as indicated by the verse "Twice has thou caused us to die, just as 

twice thou hast brought us to life," (40:11) and as is indicated by [the above phrase] being 

followed by "and again to Him will you return," bearing in mind the Qur'an's conciseness, 

[it may be said that these] point to both the life of the grave, and [the resurrected] life at 

the resurrection of the dead. 

 -If you were to ask: If a person is incinerated and his ashes are thrown to the wind, 

how could he be thought to experience the life of the grave? 

 You would be told: According to the Sunnis, the body is not a condition of life, so 

the spirit may be attached to a few particles. 

 

245 

#246 

 -And if you were to ask: How can one conceive of the torments of the grave, for if 

one  placed  an  egg  on  the  chest  of  a  corpse  and  left  it  there  for  days,  not  the  slightest 

movement would be felt in it. So how could there be life and torment? 

 You would be told: The World of Similitudes (al-'âlam al-mithâlî') has proved it, in 

the  relevant  places;  indeed,  its  existence  is  certain  according  to  the  punctilious  divine 

scholars.  That  world  [of  Similitudes]  is  characterized  by  its  embodying  meanings, 

transforming accidents into substance, and making mutable things immutable. The eyes 

that look to it from this manifest world are true dreams, true illuminations (kashf), and 

wraith-like  bodies,  for  these  all  intimate  its  existence.  The  Intermediate  Realm  ('âlam 

albarzakh)  is  a  firmer  reality  than  the  World  of  Similitudes,  which  is  its  image  or 

exemplification.  While  the  World  of  Dreams  is  the  shadow  of  the  latter  [intermediate] 

world, and the World of Imagination is the shadow of the World of Dreams. These bodies 

are as transparent as mirrors. 

 Now, if you have understood this, consider the World of Dreams and think of a person 

who is sleeping near you. He is resting peacefully and silently, but in his world he is fighting 

and being wounded by the blows he receives, or is bitten by a snake and he suffers pain at 

this. If it were possible for you to enter his dream, you would say to him: "Hey! Don't feel 

hopeless and angry! This isn't real [it's a dream]!" You would swear it a thousand times but 

he would not believe you, and would say: "Can't you see that I've been wounded and the 

pain I'm suffering? Can't you see the man and his sword and the snake that's hissing at me?" 

For the significations of his painful shoulder or cold in his head had been embodied as a 

cutting sword, for the result was the same. Or he imagined in the form of a snake what a 

betrayal  that  had  wounded  his  heart  had  signified  for  him,  for  the  pain  was  the  same. 

Friend! Now that you have seen this in the shadow of the World of Similitudes, [the World 

of Dreams,] wouldn't you accept it in the Intermediate Realm, the reality of which is far 

firmer and more distant from us? 

 "Will bring you again to life," in regard to the life of the hereafter: the life of the 

hereafter is the outcome of all the world. If it were not for that life, there would be no 

fixed and constant reality, and all truths - such as bounties - would be transformed into 

calamities. You can think of further examples in the same way. We summarized its proofs 

when expounding "And in the hereafter they have certain faith." (2:5) 

The Fifth Matter, regarding "and again to Him will you return (thumma 

  

 

 

246 

ilayhi turja'ûn)." This is the final node in this sequence, so consider the following: 

 The  Creator  manifested  His  power,  combining  opposites  in  this  world  of  change 

('âlam al-kawn wa'l-fasâd) for [many] subtle instances of wisdom, and He placed apparent 

causes and intermediaries to display His dignity, and determined the chains of cause and 

effect. Then, at the resurrection of the dead when the universe is purified and [opposites] 

are separated out and join forces, causes will be removed and intermediaries will fall away 

and  the  veil  shall  be  raised,  and  each  person  will  see  his  Maker  and  recognize  his  true 

#247 

Owner. 

 

 An Appendix Summarizing the Positioning of the Phrases 

 Consider this: having rebutted the disbelief implied by the rhetorical question "How? 

(kayfa)," and having prompted the peoples's amazement at it, the Most High offers [them] 

proof  with  what  follows  the  circumstantial  "and"  (al-wâw  al-hâliyya)  that  is,  the  four 

mighty transformations, all of which and each of which testify to the necessity of belief. 

Each transformation comprises numerous stages and degrees, and each is the preliminary 

and 'stomach' of the one that follows it. From the first stage of the first transformation till 

the  last  stage  of  the  last  transformation  the  fundament  of  the  living  body  is  constantly 

renewed. It casts away one shell and is clothed in one more perfect, then it discards that 

and is dressed in one finer, then it throws that away and puts on a better form, and so on 

and so forth. It continuously swaps its form for one more perfect till it reaches the acme 

of perfection and there it comes to rest on the establishment of eternal happiness. And all 

this is in accordance with a specified order and regular laws. 

 With  "seeing  that  you  were  lifeless"  it  indicates  the  first  transformation,  which 

comprises [numerous] stages the last of which leads to "and He gave you life," which points 

to the second transformation, which is the most wondrous of the truths of the world. It too 

comprises many stages the last of which concludes in the transformation of "then will He 

cause you to die," which also has many stages pertaining to the Intermediate Realm. This 

finishes in the transformation of "and then will bring you again to life," which comprises 

many  stages  pertaining  to  the  grave  and  then  to  the  resurrection  of  the  dead,  and  is 

concluded  with  [the  truth  of]  "and  again  to  Him  will  you  return."  How  can  anyone  who 

studies these transformations attentively be so audacious as to deny [them]? 

 

 

 

 

247 

#248 

of the phrases: 

 Now we commence with the positioning [and relationships] of the constituents 

 The first phrase, that is, "How can you refuse to acknowledge Allâh seeing that 

you were lifeless? (Kayfa takfurûna bi'llâhi wa kuntum amwatan):" 

 The interrogative form is [used] here to call attention to [the disbelievers'] error so 

that they might see it themselves and come to think fairly and acknowledge [Allâh], 

 "How (kayfa)" infers through the denial of the circumstantial sentence necessitated 

by "how" that their disbelief is [in reality] non-existence. 

 The  use  of  the  second  person  in  "you  refuse  to  acknowledge  Allâh  (lit.  you 

disbelieve)" indicates, as was discussed above, [Allâh's] intense anger [at them], and the 

non-use of 'do you not believe' instead of "you disbelieve" indicates their extreme obduracy, 

for they hold back from belief, for which there are evidences, and accept disbelief for the 

futility of which there are manifold proofs. 

 The circumstantial [conjunction] "and (wa)" (al-wâw al-hâlîyya) in "seeing that (lit. 

and)  you  (wa  kuntum)"  implies  an  unstated  phrase.  [The  conjunction  indicates  that 

"kuntum amwâtan" is circumstantial (hâl) to the verb "takfurûn." The circumstantial word 

or phrase has to be together with the factor governing it ('âmil dhi'l-hâl). Whereas there 

are four phrases here, two of which refer to the past (are in the perfect tense) and two of 

which refer to the future are (in the imperfect tense). They are therefore opposed to the 

rule of simultaneity. Therefore the circumstantial "and" implies an unstated sentence or 

phrase], which is: "seeing that (lit. and) you know that you were lifeless (lit. dead)." [In 

this way, the words "you know" are circumstantial (hâl) to the doer of the verb "takfurûn - 

(lit.) you disbelieve."] {[*]: See, İsârâtu l-İ'caz [Abdûlmecid], 258.} 

 -If you were to ask: They know the first life and death, but they don't know they are 

from Allâh. Also they don't accept the second life or agree that they will return to Allâh 

the Most High? 

 You would be told: It is a rule of eloquence to accord the ignorant man the status 

of a knowing or learned one [that is, not to call ignorance ignorance] if there are clear 

evidences to dispel his ignorance. Since reflection on the stages of the first death and first 

life  compels  one  to  acknowledge  the  Maker  and  knowledge  of  them  convinces  one 

intellectually about the 

 

 

 

 

248 

#249 

life? 

  

  

  

second life, [the disbelievers] as though had knowledge of that sequence [of events]. 

 The use of the second person in "you (kuntum)," indicates that they had a specific 

existence  in  the  world  of  minute  particles  too.  The  particles  did  not  come  together 

haphazardly and become a particular body by chance. 

 And  the  choice  of  "you  were  lifeless  (lit.  dead)  (amwâtan)"  rather  than  'lifeless, 

inanimate (jamâdât)' or 'particles' alludes to the meaning of the verse "Has there not been 

over man a long period of time, when he was nothing - [not even] mentioned?" (76:1) 

Now the phrase: "and He gave you life (fa-ahyâkum):" 

-If you were to ask: The conjunction "fa- - and" denotes succession and contact [that 

is, there should be no 'distance' between what precedes and succeeds it], but doesn't it 

interrupt the stages and isn't there a long interval between death or lifeless beings and 

 You would be told: The "fa-" indicates the source of the proof of the Maker, and that 

is  the  transformation  of  particles  spontaneously  from  an  inanimate  to  an  animate  state 

without the intervention of a reasonable cause, which compels the mind to acknowledge 

the Maker. Moreover, the stages in the conditions of inanimate beings are defective and 

inconstant, and are characterized by [swift] succession. 

 And the choice of "He gave you life (ahyâkum)" rather than '(lit.) you became alive' 

(sirtum ahyâan) is for clarification; that is, "you became alive and this was possible only 

through the Maker's power. It has to be concluded therefore that it is Allâh the Most High 

who gives life." 

 Then the substitution of "then will He cause you to die (thumma yumîtukum)" for 

'you  will  die'  (tamûtûn)  indicates,  as  has  been  mentioned,  that  death  is  a  vast  act  of 

[divine] power in accordance with the measuring of divine determining (qadar). You have 

surely noticed that it is only a tiny minority who live out their full natural span. This makes 

one realize that death is not a natural consequence. It is the dissolution of the body, not 

the extinction of the spirit; it is indeed, the liberation of the spirit. 

In the phrase "and then He will bring you again to life (thumma yuhyîkum)," "then 

(thumma)" indicates the intervention of the Intermediate Realm with its strange wonders. 

 

249 

 In the phrase "and again to Him will you return (thumma ilayhi turja'ûn)," "then" 

indicates the existence of the great veil, while its raising, and the repulsion of causes and 

dismissal of intermediaries are indicated by "to Him will you return." 

 -If you were to ask: Returning to Allâh the Most High necessitates having come from 

Him in the first place, and because of this some people have imagined there to be union 

[with Allâh] and some Sufis have fallen into doubt? 

 You would be told: Just as in this world there is existence and its continuance, so in 

the  hereafter  there  is  existence  and  its  continuance.  In  this  world  of  flux  and  change 

existence emanates from the hand of power without intermediary, but [its] continuance is 

encompassed by composition and decomposition, and the disposal of power and change, 

and  for  the  instances  of  wisdom  mentioned  above  causes  intervene  [in  it].  But  in  the 

hereafter  both  existence  and  [its]  continuance  will  appear  [directly]  from  the  hand  of 

power with all their necessities and compositions, and everything will know its True Owner. 

If you think about this, you will understand the meaning of "return."

 It is He who has created for you all that is on earth, and has applied His design to 

the  heavens,  and  has  fashioned  them  into  seven  heavens;  and  of  all  things  He  has  full 

knowledge. (Hû alladhî khalaqa la-kum mâ fi'l-ard jamî'an thumma astawâ ilâ al-samâ' fa-

sawwâhunna saba' samâwât wa hû bi-kulli shay'in 'alîm.) 

 This verse too has three important facets. 

 The positioning of the verse as a whole in relation to the previous verse: 

 In the previous verse disbelief and ingratitude were disproved by means of evidences 

pertaining  to  man's  self  (al-dalâ'il  al-anfusiyya)  and  these  were  the  stages  of  human 

[development], and now this verse points out evidences in the outside world (al-dalâ'il al-

âfâqiyya). Similarly, the previous verse indicated the bounties of existence and life, while 

this verse indicates the bounty of permanent existence (al-baqâ). Again, in the previous 

one there was proof of the Maker and matters preliminary to the resurrection of the dead, 

while this verse indicates the realization of the resurrection and the dispelling of doubts, 

as though [the disbelievers] were asking: "Where does it come from, this value man has? 

Why does he have such importance? And what is his position in Allah's sight that He should 

bring about the resurrection of the dead on account of him?" So the Qur'an replies through 

the indications of this verse: "Man has high value as is evidenced by the heavens and earth 

being subjugated [to him] for his use. He also has vast importance as is evidenced by the 

fact that Allah did not create him for creation, but created creation for him. He also has 

a [high] place in Allah's sight as is evidenced by the fact that Allah did not give existence 

world for itself, but for man, and He gave man existence that he might worship Him. It is 

to be concluded from this that man is superior and preeminent and not like the animals, 

and that he is worthy of receiving the jewel of "and again to Him will you return." 

251 

The positioning of the verse's phrases. 

 Consider this: the word "all (jami'an)" in the first phrase, the word "then (thumma)" 

in the second, and "seven (sab'a)" in the third all require investigation. We shall discuss 

 

		

them in three matters: 

The	First	Matter	

 If you were to ask: This verse indicates that everything on the earth is for man's use, 

but how can one conceive of Zayd for example making use of every part of the earth? And 

how could Habib and 'Ali derive benefit from a stone at the foot of a mountain in the middle 

of an island in the Pacific Ocean? And how can 'Amr utilize Zayd's property? But this verse 

and  others  like  it  suggest  that  all  of  it  is  for  each  person  without  being  divided  up. 

Moreover, how with their vastness can the sun and moon and so on be for Zayd and 'Amr 

and their main purpose be their tiny benefits? And how can harmful things be useful for 

human beings? For there is nothing vague or inaccurate in the Qur'an and exaggeration is 

not in keeping with true eloquence? 

 You would be told: Consider the following six points which will put such doubts to 

flight: 

 The First: 

with all things. 

 The Second: 

 As  has  been  mentioned,  it  is  characteristic  of  life  that  it  makes  the  particular 

universal,  and  the  part  into  a  whole,  the  single  into  a  collectivity,  and  the  restricted 

absolute, and the individual into a world. Thus, each member of all the species becomes 

like a living race or people and the world becomes its house, and it comes to have relations 

 As  you  know,  there  are  in  the  world  a  fixed  order,  and  firm  arrangement,  and 

elevated principles, and constant fundamental laws, making it like a clock or machine. And 

just as each cog-wheel, indeed each tooth of each cog, and even every part of each tooth, 

plays  a  part  however  minor  in  the  working  order  of  the  machine,  so  too  through  the 

workings of the machine it has an effect on the machine's utility and its production. In the 

same way, through its existence [every being] is in some way useful for living beings, the 

chief and leader of which is the human race. 

 The Third: 

 As has reached your ears in previous discussions, no [being] obstructs [other beings] 

in regard to benefiting [from things]. For just as the 

 

252 

#253 

sun in its entirety is Zayd's and its light is his place of relaxation and promenading, so in 

its  entirety  is  it  'Amr's  and  a  garden  for  him.  If  for  example  Zayd  were  all  alone  in  the 

world,  he  would  benefit  from  it  no  more  than  if  he  were  together  with  all  the  world's 

people - with the exception of that part that looks to 'the two caves,' [like food, for these 

might be the object of scrummaging and obstruction]. 

 The Fourth: 

 The universe does not have only one fine facet; it has layer upon layer of different, 

general  facets  the  benefits  of  which  [also]  have  numerous  general  and  interconnected 

facets. And the ways of utilizing them are numerous and various. For example, if you have 

a garden, you benefit from it in one way and the people benefit in another, by receiving 

pleasure from it through the faculty of sight for instance. For of course man derives benefit 

through his five external senses, his inner faculties, and his body and spirit, and also by 

means of his intellect and heart, in his life both in this world and in the hereafter, and 

from the point of view of taking lessons; you can think of further examples in the same 

way. There is nothing preventing him utilizing any of these facets of anything on the earth, 

or even in the world. 

 The Fifth: 

 -If you were to ask: The verses here and others in other places indicate that this 

vast world was created for human beings and that their utilization of it is the ultimate aim 

of  its  creation.  However,  the  planet  Saturn,  which  is  larger  than  the  earth,  is  not 

proportionately more beneficial for man; it is just a sort of adornment and pale light. So 

how could this be an ultimate reason [for its creation]? 

 You would be told: A person who profits [from a thing] loses himself in the facet of 

it that he utilizes, he focusses his mind on it and forgets everything else, and he looks at 

everything else from his own point of view. Also, [in his view] the aims and purpose of a 

thing are confined to the facet that looks to himself. Hence there is nothing exaggerated 

or inaccurate if in the context of gracious bestowal it is said in connection with that person: 

"Although Saturn's Creator gave it existence for thousands of instances of wisdom, each of 

which has thousands of facets, and every facet can be benefited from in thousands of ways, 

He created it for that person to benefit from." 

 The Sixth: 

 As you noted earlier, for sure man is small but [in meaning] he is great, hence for 

him some minor, particular benefit becomes universal and great. So there is nothing futile 

and useless. 

 

253 

#254 

 The	Second	Matter concerns "then (thumma)." 

 This verse indicates that the earth was created before the heavens, while the verse 

"And after that, the earth: wide has He spread its expanse" (79:30) shows that the heavens 

were created before the earth. Then the verse "the heavens and the earth were [once] 

one single entity, which We then parted asunder" (21:30) indicates that they were created 

together and then split apart as (lit. from) the same matter. 

 Understand secondly that the teachings (naqliyat) of the Shari'a suggest that Allâh 

the Most High created firstly a substance, that is, matter, then He manifested [His power] 

on it and made a part of it steam and a part fluid. Then through his manifestation the fluid 

part thickened and became froth. Out of this He created the earth or the seven globes of 

the earths. Then a sky was formed for each of these earths out of the wafting atmosphere. 

Then He expanded the steamy matter and arranged the [seven] heavens out of it, planting 

the stars in them. So the heavens took form containing the nuclei of the stars. 

 According  to  the  assumptions  and  theories  of  modern  science,  the  solar  system, 

together  with  the  heavens  in  which  it  floats,  were  a  simple  substance  which  was 

transformed into a sort of steam. Out of this, some fiery liquescent matter was formed, 

part of which cooled down and solidified. Then due to its motion the liquescent matter 

threw off [into space] sparks and pieces which broke up. These became compressed and 

turned into the planets, one of which is our earth. 

 If  you  have  understood  this,  you  may  correlate  these  two  explanations,  for  it  is 

possible that the verse "the heavens and the earth were [once] one single entity, which 

We then parted asunder" (21:30) indicates that the earth and the solar system were a sort 

of dough kneaded by the hand of power out of a simple substance; I mean ether, which 

compared with beings is a fluid substance that passes through and among them. The verse 

"and the throne of His [almightiness] has rested upon water" (11:7) alludes to this matter, 

which resembles water. 

 After  its  creation,  the  ether  received  the  Maker's  first  manifestation  giving 

existence;  that  is,  He  created  the  ether,  then  He  made  it  into  the  fundamental  atoms 

(jawâhir farda), then some of these He made dense and out of them created the seven 

globes,  of  which  our  earth  is  inhabited.  Then  the  earth  solidified  before  all  the  rest, 

speedily forming a crust, and over a long period of time became the source of life while 

up to the present most of the heavenly bodies remained in a fiery fluid state. In so far as 

this was the 

 

 

254 

#255 

case  its  creation  and  formation  was  before  that  of  the  heavens.  And  since  its  uses  and 

benefits and its being "spread out" - that is, arranged and set in order - were completed 

after  the  arrangement  and  ordering  of  the  heavens,  the  heavens  were  previous  in  this 

respect, although [the heavens and earth] were together at the beginning. Thus, the three 

verses look to the three points [solving the apparent contradictions], 

 A second answer: The Qur'an's aim is not to teach the history of creation; it was 

revealed to teach knowledge of the Maker, and so contains different levels (maqâmat). 

When describing the [divine] bounties, favours, and mercy and the clarity of the evidences, 

the earth comes first. But on the level of the proofs of [divine] grandeur, sublimity, and 

power, the heavens precede. 

 "Then (thumma):" this may refer to 'a being protracted' or procrastination (tarâkhi). 

This  may  be  essential  (dhâti),  and  may  also  pertain  to  degree  (rutbî)  [or  to  reflection 

(tafakkurî)]. Thus "and (lit. then ) has applied His design (thumma astawâ)" implies the 

unstated words "Then know and reflect on [how] He applied His design to the heavens..." 

[That  is,  the  creation  of  the  heavens  was  first  in  time  but  in  respect  of  reflection  and 

thought it is in second place; and the creation of the earth was after that of the heavens 

but in regard to reflective thought it comes first.] {[*]: See, İsârâtu'l-İ'caz [Abdûlmecid], 

265.} 

  

The	Third	Matter, regarding "seven (sab'a)." 

 Consider this: ancient philosophy asserted that the heavens were ninefold, and its 

proponents conceived of it in an extraordinary form. Their ideas dominated mankind for 

centuries.  In  fact,  very  many  Qur'anic  commentators  were  forced  to  bend  the  literal 

meanings of verses to [conform with] with their school. Modern science, however, asserts 

that the stars are suspended in space or in the void, as though it denies the existence of 

the heavens. That is to say, one went to one extreme and the other went to the other. As 

for the Shari'a, it states that the Maker (May His glory be exalted) created seven heavens 

and placed the stars in them like fish swimming [in the sea]. The Hadith "The heavens are 

a wave held back"{[*]: Musnad, ii, 370; al-Tirmidhi, Sura al-Hadid, 1 (no: 3298). For further 

details  see,  Ishârât  al-l'jâz  [Ihsân  Qasim],  226.}  alludes  to  this.  This  school  [of  thought] 

may be verified on six levels: 

 The First: It has been established by science and philosophy that endless space is 

filled with ether. 

 

 

255 

#256 

 The Second: What binds the laws of the lofty bodies and transmits and spreads such 

forces as light and heat is a matter that is existent in space and fills it. 

 The Third: Although the matter [called] ether remains as ether, like other matter it 

has various different changeable states, like steam, water, and ice are formed of water. 

 The  Fourth:  If  the  heavenly  bodies  are  observed  carefully,  there  appear  to  be 

different levels. You have surely seen the river of the heavens known as the Milky Way, 

which appears as a great splash of clouds; it consists of millions of stars that are being 

newly  formed  and  are  clustering  together.  And  the  ether,  in  which  those  stars  are 

clustering, is of course different to the level of the fixed stars, and one surmises correctly 

that this too is different to the levels of the solar system, and so on, till there are seven 

 The  Fifth:  It  is  established  by  both  induction  and  intuition  that  when  matter  is 

subject to both formation, ordering, and arrangement, it gives rise to different states (lit. 

levels). From carbon (lit. mineral - ma'dan) is produced ashes, coal, and diamonds; and 

fire may be separated into embers, flames, and smoke; and from the combining of oxygen 

and hydrogen water, ice, and steam are produced. 

 The  Sixth:  The  above  are  all  indications  that  the  heavens  are  manifold.  And  the 

truthful lawgiver (al-shâri' al-sâdiq) said they were seven. And they are seven in the sense 

that in the Arabic language, seven, seventy, and seven hundred all denote multiplicity. 

In Short: The Maker (May His glory be exalted) created from the matter [called] ether 

seven heavens and arranged them giving them a wondrously fine order, and He planted the 

stars in them, and their layers are various. 

 Now consider this: if you ponder over the Qur'an's addresses and its meanings and 

its taking into consideration the understanding of all classes [of people] from the lowest 

to the highest of the elite, you will observe an extraordinary matter. For example, from 

"the  seven  heavens"  some  people  understand  the  levels  of  the  atmosphere  (al-hawa'  al-

nasîmî); and some understand the wafting spheres that encircle our earth and its fellows 

which sustain living beings; others understand the seven planets visible to everyone; others 

understand the seven etherial layers in the solar system; yet others understand seven solar 

systems the first of which is our's; others understand the ether giving rise to the formation 

of seven levels [or states] as was discussed above; then some consider that all that is visible 

of the adorning lamps of the suns and fixed stars is a single heaven. They form 

levels. 

  

 

 

256 

#257 

the skies of this world, above which are six more invisible heavens. And yet others surmise 

that the seven heavens are not restricted to the Manifest World, and they conceive of them 

as levels of creation in this world, the hereafter, and the Unseen and their worlds. All of 

these [classes of people] profit from the Qur'an's abundant blessings in accordance with 

their  capacities  and  receive  their  shares  from  its  table,  which  encompasses  all  these 

understandings. 

  

ard jamî'an):" 

Now consider the five aspects of the positioning of the verse's first sentence; that is, 

"It is He who has created for you all that is on earth (Hû alladhî khalaqa la-kum mâ fi'l-

 The First: The previous verse pointed out the bounty of life and existence, while 

this one indicates the bounty of permanent existence (al-baqâ) and its causes. 

 The Second: When the previous verse proves that man is at the highest degree, that 

is, he will return to the Most High, it arouses the listener's mind and he asks: "How could 

lowly man have had the capacity [to sustain] this high rank if it hadn't been for the Most 

High's grace and His drawing him to it?" So this phrase as though replies to the question, 

saying that man has a truly elevated place in his Creator's sight since He has subjugated all 

the world to him. 

 The Third: On the previous verse indicating the occurrence of the resurrection of 

the  dead  and  Great  Gathering  for  mankind,  the  listener  starts  to  ask:  "What  is  man's 

importance that the resurrection should be brought about for him and the world destroyed 

for his happiness?" And this phrase as though replies: "Seeing that all that the earth contains 

has been prepared for his use and all its species [of beings] have been subjugated to him, 

he must have supreme importance since this shows he is the fruit of creation." 

 The Fourth: With the words "to Him will you return" the previous verse implies that 

[in the hereafter] intermediaries will be removed and all recourse and authority will be 

confined to the Most High. In this world however man has numerous things and authorities 

to which he has recourse, so this phrase states that causes and intermediaries disclose the 

hand of power and that the true place of recourse [in this world too] is Allâh the Most High, 

and that causes only intervene for certain instances of wisdom. For the Most High creates 

everything man needs. 

 The Fifth: The preceding verse having alluded to eternal happiness, this one points 

out the previous grace and favours that necessitate it. That is, 

 

 

257 

#258 

everlasting happiness. 

one who has been graced with all that is on the earth must be worthy of being granted 

 The phrase: "and has applied His design to the heavens (thumma astawa ilâ al-

samâ'):" its positioning has four aspects: 

 The First: The heavens are the earth's companion. The earth cannot be conceived 

of as alone; mention of it always recalls the heavens. 

 The Second: The skies are ordered perfectly, [in such a way that] man may utilize 

what is on the earth. 

 The Third: The preceding phrase points out evidences of [divine] beneficence and 

grace, while this one points to evidences of [divine] grandeur and power. 

 The Fourth: This phrase indicates that man's benefits are not confined to the earth, 

but that the heavens too are subjugated to his use. 

 The positioning of the phrase "and has fashioned them into seven heavens (fa-

sawwâhunna saba' samâwât)." This has five aspects: 

 The First: This phrase is tied to the previous one in the way that [the fiat] "Be!" is 

tied to "and it is." 

 The Second: [It is tied to the previous one] in the way that the functioning (ta'lluq) 

of [divine] power and that of [divine] will are tied. 

 The Third: [It is tied to the previous phrase] in the way that the conclusion [of a 

piece] is tied to the introduction. 

kulli shay'in 'alîm)" has two aspects: 

 The positioning of the phrase "and of all things He has full knowledge (wa hû bi-

 One of them: [This phrase] is an argument from cause to effect (dalîl limmî) proving 

the ordering [described in the previous phrase], just as that ordering is an argument from 

effect to cause (dalîl innî) proving this phrase. For order and harmony prove the existence 

of perfect knowledge, just as knowledge informs order. 

 The other: The previous phrase points to perfect power, while this one indicates all-

embracing knowledge. 

 The positioning of the parts of the verse's phrases: 

 [The verse contains these points:] the first phrase is not tied to the previous one; 

the first two parts are definite, as is the predicate; the preposition "la-" of "la-kum - for 

you" and the phrase's precedence; the preposition "in (fi);" and the word "all (jamî'an)." 

 

258 

 Being  unconnected  to  what  preceded  it  (al-istinâf)  the  first  phrase  implies  the 

unstated questions the answers to which were noted in the 'five aspects' of the positioning 

of the first phrase above. 

 

#259 

 In the phrase "He who (hû alladhî)," "He" is the subject and "who" is the predicate, 

and both are definite, which indicates divine unity and restriction. [That is, the creation 

of all in the earth is confined to Allâh; Allâh is the sole Creator.] And this restriction alludes 

to the restriction expressed by the precedence of "to Him (ilayhi)" in "and again to Him 

will you return" in the previous verse. [The relative pronoun "who" and relative clause are 

the predicate and of right should be indefinite.] It's being definite here indicates that the 

statement is obvious. [That is, it is clear and obvious that Allâh is the Creator of all on the 

 The  [preposition]  "la-  of  benefit"  in  "la-kum  -  for  you"  indicates  that  essentially 

things  are  permissible  and  become  forbidden  only  under  certain  circumstances;  for 

instance, other people's property is proscribed since it is protected by the Shari'a; human 

flesh  is  proscribed  out  of  respect;  poison  because  of  its  harm;  or  carrion  because  it  is 

earth.] 

unclean. 

 Furthermore, it suggests the existence of benefit for man in everything, even if he 

benefits from only one of the many ways a thing may be benefited from, or in only one of 

many ways; [there is benefit for man] even in the least of things; or at least a thing may 

be utilized with a view to taking lessons. Moreover, the Most Merciful has many treasuries 

stored up in the earth, looking to the people of the future. 

 The precedence of "for you (la-kum)" indicates that man's utilization [of the earth's 

contents] is their primary purpose and main aim. 

 "What  (mâ)"  is  general  in  order  to  urge  [man]  to  search  out  the  benefits  in 

everything. 

 The use of "in the earth (fi'l-ard)" rather than 'on the earth' for example, indicates 

that  most  of  the  things  to  be  utilized  are  inside  the  earth.  It  also  spurs  [man]  on  to 

investigate what is found there. And the gradual utilization by mankind of the minerals and 

other substances of the earth suggests that it may contain such materials and elements as 

foodstuffs and other things that will lighten the burdens of life of the people of the future. 

 And "all (jamî'an)" is to rebut the false idea that some things are futile and useless. 

 In the second phrase, "then (thumma)" indicates a chain of the Most High's actions 

and works after creating the earth, [His turning] to the ordering of the heavens. It is also 

 

259 

a sign that in regard to human benefits, their ordering is of a lower degree than the earth's 

creation. It also infers its occurring later than [the earth's creation]. 

 "astawâ" is a concise usage, meaning 'arâda an yusawwi - (lit.) He 

 

#260 

towards them. 

willed  or  wanted  to  arrange  or  regulate.'  It  also  has  a  metaphorical  meaning,  denoting 

someone who aims at something intently without swerving to left or right. 

 "To the heavens (ilâ al-samâ'):" that is, to the [physical] matter of the heavens, and 

 The particle "fa- (and)" of "fa-sawwâhunna - and has fashioned them:" in so far that 

this is the particle of divergence or branching (tafrî), [the tie between this phrase and the 

previous  one;  that  is,  between  astawâ  and  taswîyya]  resembles  "it  is"  being  the 

consequence of [the creative command] "Be!", and an act of power being the result of an 

act  of  will,  and  the  execution  of  an  act  (al-qadaâ)  being  the  result  of  determining  (al-

qadar).  And  in  so  far  as  it  denotes  'following'  (ta'qîb),  the  "fa-"  implies  some  unstated 

words: "He made [the heavens] various and set them in order and regulated the matters 

between them, and then He arranged them [into the seven heavens]." 

The meaning of "fashioned (sawwâ)" is that He created them as wellordered, regular 

and similar, in that He gave each what was fitting for its potentialities and equal to its 

capacity. 

matter of the heavens. 

 The  [pronominal  suffix]  "them  (-hunna)"  denotes  the  diversity  of  the  [physical] 

 As for "seven (sab'a)," it comprises [meanings] of both multiplicity, and the relation 

with the seven [divine] attributes, and with the seven aeons in the formation of the earth. 

 And by "the heavens (samâwât)" is meant the garden of profuse pearly flowers, the 

seas for the fishes of the planets, and the arable field for the seeds of the stars. 

  

  

The phrase " and of all things He has full knowledge (wa hû bi-kulli shay'in 'alîm):" 

 The conjuction "and" necessitates a connection [though apparently there is none], 

which implies [the following unstated sentence]: "He is powerful over all things so [must 

be] the Creator of these majestic heavenly bodies. And He is knowing of all things, for it 

is He who placed them in order with such precise art." 

 The "bi-", which expresses contiguity, in "of all (bi-kulli)" indicates that knowledge 

is not separate from what is known. 

 

260 

 "All  (kull)"  is  general  and  [from  the  point  of  view  of  divine  knowledge]  there  is 

nothing  outside  it  [for  Allâh  knows  everything  without  exception].  Thus,  the  rule  "all

An Introduction 

 Consider this: confirmatory belief in the existence of the angels in one of the pillars 

of faith. We may discuss it here in several stations (maqâmat): {[*]: For a more detailed 

discussion, see, the Twenty-Ninth Word (The Words, 521-37).} 

 The First Station 

 Whoever  observes  the  earth,  [will  see  that]  despite  its  lowliness  it  is  filled  with 

beings with spirits (dhawî al-arwâh), and if he studies the precise order of the world, he 

will surmise that the lofty constellations also have inhabitants. 

 A person who does not believe in the existence of the angels resembles a man who 

travels  to  a  great  city  and  there  comes  across  a  little  house  which  is  old,  littered  with 

refuse, and overflowing with people. He notices that its yard is full of beings with spirits 

all of which have particular vital needs: some are herbivorous and some pisciverous. Then 

thousands of lofty 

262 

#263 

inhabitants. 

mansions strike his eye, new and interspersed among wide squares and avenues, but due 

to  the  absence  of  the  conditions  to  support  life  he  believes  this  abode  to  be  devoid  of 

 A person who does believe in the angels is like someone who when he sees the small 

house  which  is  full  of  beings  with  spirits  and  notes  the  well  laid-out  city,  is  absolutely 

certain that the decorated mansions also have inhabitants, appropriate to them and with 

their own particular conditions of life. Their being invisible, due to either the distance or 

the  loftiness  of  the  mansions,  does  not  prove  that  they  do  not  exist.  Thus,  by  means  a 

primary analogy based on a 'hidden' syllogism and based too on the regular order, it may 

be  concluded  from  the  earth  being  full  of  animate  beings  that  endless  space  with  its 

constellations, stars, and heavens is full of beings with spirits. And these beings, which are 

of various sorts, the Shari'a calls the angels. Now, reflect on this! 

  

The Second Station 

 You know, as has been discussed, that life is the discloser of beings; indeed, it is its 

result.  So  how  could  endless  space  be  devoid  of  inhabitants  and  the  heavens  lack  their 

populace? All the intelligent have in effect agreed on the concept of the angels and their 

reality, even if their interpretations have differed. In fact, the Peripatetic philosophers 

called them "the disembodied spiritual essences of species;" and the Illuminists called them 

"the [ten] intellects and masters (arbâb) of the species;" and the followers of the religions 

have called the Mountain Angel, the Sea Angel, and the Rain Angel, for example. For the 

Materialists even, who believe only what they see, it has not been easy to deny the concept 

of the angels and they have associated them with the pervasive forces or power (al-qûwât 

alsâriyya) in the laws of creation. 

 -If you were to ask: Aren't the laws and principles in force in creation sufficient to 

hold the universe together and [sustain] its vitality? 

 You  would  be  told:  Those  laws  and  principles  are  only  theoretical  or  subjective 

(i'tibâriyya) or imaginary even; they can be accorded specific existence and identity only 

through that which represents and reflects them and holds their reins. And this is nothing 

other than the angels. 

 Furthermore, the philosophers (al-hukamâ'), reason, and the transmitted religious 

texts  are  united  in  [their  belief  that]  existence  is  not  restricted  to  the  visible  Manifest 

World, which is lifeless and unsuitable for the formation (tashakkul) of spirits. The World 

 

263 

of the Unseen however comprises numerous worlds which are appropriate for spirits, like 

water is for fishes, and is full of them and it imparts (muzhir) life to the Manifest World. 

 Thus, since these four matters testify for you to the existence of the angels as a 

concept, the most satisfactory forms ascribed to them are those set out by the Shari'a, as 

is agreed by all people of sound intelligence: they are honoured worshipful servants [of 

Allâh] who never fail to do what they are commanded. They are subtle luminous bodies 

 

#264 

and are of various sorts. 

  

The Third Station 

 Consider  this:  the  angels  is  one  of  those  matters  in  which  [the  existence  of]  the 

universal  can  be  verified  by  establishing  [the  existence  of]  a  single  particular  and  the 

species can be known through the sighting of one of its members. For if one is denied, all 

are denied. 

 It would surely be impossible in your opinion - otherwise may Allâh awaken you [to 

the truth]! - for the followers of all the religions down the ages from the time of Adam to 

the  present  to  have  agreed  on  the  angels'  existence,  and  on  the  certain  occurrence  of 

conversations with them and the definite sightings of them and the narrations about them 

and what people have reported about their various sorts - if one single angel, or several, 

had not been seen and if the existence of one or more of them was not certain or if their 

existence had not been perceived. 

 Similarly, it is impossible that a such a delusion would have become established in 

the beliefs of mankind and persisted in this way through all the upheavals [of time] if there 

had been no truth that gave rise to those general beliefs or to the necessary principles on 

which they were based. In which case, the basis of the consensus is a conjecture born of 

various different signs, provided by sightings, arising from necessary principles. And the 

reason for the general belief is the necessary principles arising from [the angels] having 

been  seen  and  observed  on  numerous  occasions,  forming  what  is  in  effect  a  consensus 

concerning  them.  Otherwise  none  of  the  certain,  well-known  beliefs  of  mankind 

[concerning other things] would be reliable. 

 Thus, if the existence of any one spirit being (al-rûhâniyya) has been verified at any 

time, the existence of the species has been verified. And since the existence of the species 

has been verified, it will surely be as described by the Shari'a and expounded by the Qur'an. 

  

 

264 

The positioning of this verse's meaning in relation to the preceding one. 

 It has four aspects: 

 The First: The [earlier] verses enumerate the immense bounties [bestowed on man], 

and the previous one indicates the greatest of them - 

 

#265 

man's being the fruit of creation and all on the earth being subjugated to him for him to 

dispose of as he wishes. Now this verse points out that man is [Allâh's] vicegerent on the 

earth and is its ruler. 

earth are in man's hands. 

 The  Second:  This  verse  expounds,  explains,  elucidates,  verifies,  proves,  and 

corrroborates what the previous verse [states], that the reins of the chains of all on the 

 The Third: The previous verse having explained the building of the two dwellings of 

the earth and the heavens, this one indicates their inhabitants, mankind and the angels. 

And while the former alludes to the chain of creation, this one hints at the chain of beings 

with spirits (dhawî al-arwâh). 

 The  Fourth:  On  the  previous  verse  making  it  clear  that  humankind  is  the  aim  of 

creation and that man has a high place in his Creator's sight, the listener is moved to ask: 

"How can man be worthy when he perpetrates so much evil and corruption? Does wisdom 

necessitate his existence, to worship and hallow the Most High?" So this verse implies that 

on account of (lit. besides) the mystery [the Trust] being deposited in him, his evils and 

iniquities are forgiven, and that Allâh stands in no need of man's worship, for some of the 

angels hallow Him and glorify Him with praises beyond number. [Man's creation therefore] 

is for some purpose known only to the One All-Knowing of the Unseen. 

  

Now the positioning of the verse's phrases: 

 This  verse  flows  on  smoothly  [from  the  previous  one]  because  of  [the  second, 

implied] "then (idh)" necessitated by the first, and its looking to ( 'atf) "and of all things 

He  has  full  knowledge"  [although  it  is  apparently  unrelated.  This  implies]  the  unstated 

sentence: "Then (idh) He created what He created in perfect systematic order 'And then 

your Lord said to the angels...'" [Thus, the second idh looks to the first and a relationship 

is formed between the two sentences.] When, to get them to ask the reason for [man's 

creation] and to teach them consultation as a method, the Most High addresses the angels 

saying: "I will create a vicegerent on earth," it prompts the listener's mind to ask [three 

things]: "What did they say?", in connection with the mystery of conversation; and to ask 

 

265 

the reason for [man's creation] and out of surprise: "Are You going to create [such a one] 

on  the  earth?";  and  to  learn  the  wisdom  in  man's  vicegerency  rather  than  the  mischief-

making jinns and his having been entrusted with the powers of anger and animal appetites: 

"One who will make mischief in it?" [While this latter is] due to the excesses of the power 

of appetite, "and will shed blood?" is due to the aggression of the power of anger. Having 

completed 

 

#266 

its questions and expressed its surprise, the listener's mind awaits the Most High's reply. 

And He says: "I know what you know not." That is, everything is not limited to what you 

know, and your not knowing does not infer a thing doesn't exist. I am All-Wise, I have good 

reason for [their creation], and I shall forgive their corruption and bloodshed on account 

of the wisdom in it. 

 Now the positioning of the parts of the phrases: 

 As  shown  above,  by  reason  of  the  necessary  relationship  between  two  sentences 

joined  by  a  conjunction,  the  [conjunction]  "And"  [at  the  beginning  of]  "Behold  (lit.  And 

then), your Lord and Sustainer said to the angels: I will create a vicegerent on earth (wa 

idh qâla rabbuka li'lmalâ'ika innî jâ'ilun fi'l-ard khalîfatan)" implies an unstated sentence. 

An implied sentence is similarly required before the verse "Behold! Your Lord said to the 

angels: I am about to create man from sounding clay... (Wa idh qâla Rabbuka...)" (15:28) 

 Also, since [by its very nature] Revelation summons attention and calls to mind, the 

conjuction "And" implies "And recall to them that when your Lord..." 

 The [particle] "then (idh)" denotes past time, and so sends the minds [of listeners] 

down the rungs of the past, there raises [the veil] and attracts to the present its events so 

they may behold them and gather them up. 

 The [words] "Your Lord and Sustainer (Rabbuka)" is a proof for the angels; that is, 

the  One  who  has  raised  and  perfected  you  [Muhammad],  and  made  you  the  guide  of 

humankind  that  you  might  put  a  stop  to  their  corruption.  That  is,  you  are  the  supreme 

good deed [of mankind] that preponderates over all its iniquities and covers its faults. 

 "To the angels (li'l-malâ'ika):" through their conversation in the form of consultation 

this indicates that the dwellers of the heavens, that is, the angels, have very many relations 

and connections with the dwellers of the earth, that is, humankind. For some of them are 

charged with overseeing [human beings] (muwakkal), some are guardian angels, some are 

recording angels, so they have to concern themselves with their affairs. 

 

266 

 Since  it  is  the  nature  of  the  [intensifying  particle]  "inna"  to  repulse  doubts,  here 

expressed [by the angels' question] "will You place...? (a taj'alu)," it indicates the immense 

importance of the question. 

 The use of the first person pronominal suffix "-î of innî," although the first person 

plural  is  used  in  "We  said  (qulnâ)"  in  the  following  verses,  indicates  that  there  are  no 

intermediaries in His creation and giving of existence 

 

#267 

as there are in His speech and address. These fine points are illustrated also in the verse 

"We  have  sent  down  to  you  the  Book  in  truth.  That  you  might  judge  between  men  in 

accordance with what Allâh has taught you." (4:105) Here, the first person plural in "We 

have  sent  down"  indicates  the  existence  of  an  intermediary  in  [the  sending  down  of] 

revelation and infers its splendour. [That is, it indicates the angel(s) of revelation, who 

manifest the splendour of the One who sends them.] While the third person singular in "in 

accordance with what Allâh has taught you" indicates that there are no intermediaries in 

the inspiration of meanings. 

 The choice of "place (jâ'il)" rather than 'create' indicates that what causes the doubts 

and questioning is mankind being 'placed' on the earth and appointed to cultivate it, not 

[man's] creation and being given existence. For existence is pure good and creation is an 

essential act (fi'l dhâti) [of Allâh] and [as such] cannot be questioned. 

 And  the  choice  of  "in  (fi)"  in  the  phrase  "in  the  earth"  rather  than  'on,'  despite 

mankind being on the earth, intimates that humankind resembles the spirit breathed into 

the earth, and if it ever quits the earth, the earth will fall apart and expire. 

 "Vicegerent (khalîfatan)" suggests that before conditions on the earth were readied 

for  human  life,  there  were  intelligent  creatures  for  whose  lives,  conditions  during  the 

earth's  early  epochs  were  suitable.  This  [view]  is  in  conformity  with  the  questions  of 

science (qadîyya al-hikma). The most widely held [view] is that these creatures were a 

species of jinn, but they spread corruption [on the earth] so were succeeded by mankind. 

 The parts of the sentence: "They said: Will You place therein one who will make 

mischief  therein  and  shed  blood?  (qâlû  a  taj'alu  fi-hâ  man  yufsidufi-hâ  wa  yasfiku  al-

 Consider this: "They said" being apparently unconnected to what precedes it (istinaf) 

suggests that the Most High's turning to and addressing the angels drives the listener to 

ask: "What will [the angels'] attitude be towards their neighbours, seeing that their houses 

dimâ'a)" 

 

267 

are side by side? Will they be happy to have them as fellows? What is their opinion of them?" 

So the Qur'an says: "They said: Will You place therein..?" 

 This last phrase, "They said: Will You place (qâlû a taj'alu)" is the consequence of 

the conditional particle "idh" [in the phrase "Behold (lit. and then) (your Lord) said (Wa idh 

qâla)"] [but the necessary phrase (luzûm) is unstated, implying the words:] "Allâh the Most 

High  ruled  that  man  should  be  made  His  vicegerent  on  the  earth,  which  was  under  the 

supervision of 

 

#268 

them. 

the angels, although He was in no need of officers or ministers. This meant that the angels 

had to declare how they would meet [human beings]." 

 The speech [in these two phrases] is a conversation in the form of consultation, [and 

its purpose is] to teach [these to] the people, for the Most High is far above [any need of] 

 [The angels] ask: "Will You place therein..?" in order to learn the reason, for the 

Most High had informed [them] about it but had withheld the reason. This was the cause 

of their surprise and it led to their question. That is, their asking: "What is the wisdom in 

[men] being placed [on the earth]?" Thus, they wanted to learn the result or effect rather 

than the cause, not to deny or object to it, for they are without sin. 

 And  "the  placing"  [of  mankind  on  the  earth]  hints  that  man's  characteristics,  and 

theoretical origins and descent, and circumstances are not the imperatives of nature, but 

have all been 'placed' by One who places. 

 The  repetition  of  "in  it  (fi-hâ)"  despite  their  proximity  is  for  clarity  and  implies: 

What is the reason for placing mankind [on the earth] as a spirit breathed into the earth's 

body to quicken it, when on the other hand men will be the cause of its corruption and 

 The use of the [relative pronoun] "one who (man)" indicates that rather than the 

human character, it is the rebellion of creatures against the Most High that troubles [the 

death? 

angels]. 

 And  the  use  of  "cause  corruption  (yafsudu)"  rather  than  'rebel'  indicates  that 

rebellion  eventually  spoils  the  order  of  the  world.  And  the  use  of  the  imperfect  tense 

indicates  that  what  is  detestable  about  it  is  its  constant  repetition.  [The  angels]  had 

knowledge of this either through the Most High informing [them], or through studying the 

Preserved Tablet, or because they had knowledge of human nature and the unrestricted 

powers  lodged  in  it.  Corruption  is  caused  through  the  unrestrained  use  of  the  power  of 

 

268 

animal appetites, while bloodshed and tyranny result from the aggression of the power of 

 "Therein  (fi-hâ):"  that  is,  [they  cause  corruption  in  the  earth]  despite  it  being  a 

mosque founded on consciousness of Allâh and fear of Him (taqwâ). 

 The [conjunction] "and" joins two despicable acts [causing corruption and shedding 

blood], for corruption leads to the spilling of blood. 

 And the choice of "shed blood (yasfiku)" rather than 'kill' is because to shed blood is 

to kill unjustly. And murder is not jihâd in Allâh's way. Also, the [just] killing of one person 

for the good of the community is like killing a wolf to save the flock. 

anger. 

 

#269 

 The  [use  of]  the  word  "blood  (al-dimâ")"  with  "shed  blood"  is  to  emphasize  the 

repugnance of murder. 

 The positioning of the parts of the phrase: "Whilst we do celebrate Your praises 

and glorify Your holy [name]? (wa nahnu nusabbihu bi-hamdika wa nuqaddisu la-ka.)" 

 The [circumstantial conjunction] "and" (waw al-hâl) indicates that [the angels] were 

aware that they would meet with [such] a counter-objection as: "Aren't mankind's worship 

and  hallowing  of  the  Most  High  sufficient  wisdom  in  your  view  [for  human  beings  being 

placed on the earth]?" 

 "We (nahnu);" that is, the whole host of angels untainted by sin. And this being a 

nominal  sentence  infers  that  glorification  of  Allâh  is  a  part  of  their  very  natures  and 

intrinsic to them and necessitated by their natures. 

 "We  do  celebrate  Your  praises  (nusabbihu  bi-hamdika)"  is  a  very  comprehensive 

phrase: "We proclaim You in the universe through all the varieties of worship. We believe 

that with Your glorious attributes You are far above anything unworthy [of Your Godhead] 

-  [Your  glorious  attributes]  that  are  [the  source]  of  Your  praiseworthy  bounties.  We 

declare: "Subhân Allâh wa bi-hamdihi!", that is, we laud and extol You with Your attributes 

of Glory and Beauty (al-jalâl wa'l-jamâl)!" 

 And  "Whilst  we  do  celebrate  Your  praises  and  glorify  Your  holy  [name]  (wa 

nuqaddisu la-ka);" that is, "we hallow You;" or, "we purify ourselves and our action from 

sins and our hearts of desire for anything other than You." 

 And contrarily to the previous conjunction [joining the two vices of corruption and 

spilling blood], the [conjunction] "and" here joins the two virtues of compliance with the 

divine commands and avoidance of things proscribed. 

 

269 

 Now  the  parts  of  the  phrase:  "He  said:  I  know  what  you  know  not.'  (Qâla  inni 

a'lamu mâ lâ ta'lamûn.)" The apparent unconnectedness of this phrase (al-istînâf) implies 

the [unstated] questions: "What did Allâh the Most High say in reply to their questioning? 

How did His explanation of the reason [for mankind's creation] dispel their astonishment? 

What  is  the  wisdom  in  human  beings'  preference  to  them?"  So  it  says:  "He  said  (qâla)," 

alluding to its brief reply and to the detailed explanation in the following verse. 

 The "inna" of "innî a'lamu - I know" is confirmative (li'l-tahqîq) and rebuts doubts 

and hesitation. It is used only in speculative matters not incontestable ones, whereas the 

Most High self-evidently and indisputably 

 

#270 

knows what creatures do not know, and God forbid, the angels have no doubts concerning 

this.  In  which  case,  the  "inna"  throws  light  on  a  sequence  of  [unstated]  phrases  which, 

conformably  with  the  well-trodden  path  of  rhetoric,  the  Qur'an  summarizes  succinctly. 

That is, there is much good and many advantages in mankind, and there is sinfulness but 

this  is  minor.  It  would  be  opposed  to  wisdom  to  abandon  the  former  due  to  the  latter. 

Humanity also holds a mystery, and this qualifies man for the vicegerency. The angels were 

heedless of it, but man's Creator had knowledge of it. There is also an instance of wisdom 

in the [creation] of human beings that renders them superior to [the angels]; the angels 

did not know this, but the One who created it did. 

 The "inna"s [confirmatory] meaning may also refer to a statement implied by any 

one of the sentence's words rather than to one specific word. Here it looks to a phrase 

implied by "you know not" that is, 'you have no certain knowledge of it.' 

Also, "I know what you know not (inni a'lamu mâ lâ ta'lamûn)" is by way of mentioning 

something  necessary  and  willing  its  natural  consequence.  That  is,  something  exists  that 

you have no knowledge of. For the Most High's knowledge is necessary for everything. The 

absence of [His] knowledge indicates the non-existence of the thing known. As the Most 

High says: "Is it that you will inform Him of something He knows not on the earth?" (13:33) 

That is, it is not possible [for something unknown by Allâh] to exist. And the existence of 

knowledge is evidence for the existence of the thing known. 

[In another place the Qur'an] verifies and confirms this succinct reply, saying: "Allâh 

is indeed all-knowing, all-wise." His actions lack nothing as regards wisdom and benefit. 

Hence,  beings  are  not  restricted  to  the  knowledge  of  creatures,  and  the  absence  of 

knowledge does not indicate their non-existence. 

 

270 

When Allâh the Most High created pure good, that is, the angels, and pure evil, that 

is, the devils, and that which was neither good nor evil, that is, the animals, being the 

Munificent  Bestower  of  Bounties,  His  wisdom  necessitated  the  existence  of  a  fourth 

category that embraced both good and evil. [That is, human beings.] Thus, if the [human] 

powers of anger and animal appetites submit to the power of intellect, through effort and 

striving man rises higher than the angels. But if the reverse is the case, he falls lower than 

the beasts, for he has no excuse.

story. 

related to the question of the vicegerency. There are many lessons to be learnt from the 

 Bearing in mind the verse: "Nor anything fresh or dry but is [inscribed] in a Record 

Clear," (6:59) and supported by the facts that the Qur'an both offers you clear statements 

and  evidences,  and  teaches  you  through  signs  and  indications,  I  understand  from  the 

masterly  signs  and  indications  {(*):  If  you  are  in  doubt  concerning  what  the  author 

discovered about the subtleties of the Qur'an's word-order, I can tell you that we consulted 

Ibn al-Fârid's book of poetry, opening it at random, and these lines came up: "ka-anna al-

kirâm al-kâtibina tanazzalû * Ala qalbihi wahyan bi-mâ fi sahifatın - As though the Recording 

Angels  had  alighted  *  On  his  heart,  inspiring  it  with  what  is  on  the  page."  Signed,  [His 

student and scribe] Habib} of the Qur'an's miraculousness in the stories of the prophets and 

their miracles, that it is encouraging mankind to attain similar achievements. It is as though 

with these stories, the Qur'an is pointing the finger at the main lines and final results in 

the future of mankind's efforts to progress, for the future is built on the foundations of the 

past, while the past is the mirror of the future. And it is as though the Qur'an is slapping 

humanity on the back urging and encouraging men, saying: "Exert yourselves to the utmost 

[and discover] the means to achieve some of these wonders!" You surely know that it was 

the hand of miracles that first gave mankind the clock and the ship. 

 If you wish, consider now the verses: 

 "And He taught Adam all of the names." (2:31) 

 "We bestowed grace aforetime on David from Ourselves: 'O you mountains! Sing back 

the praises of Allâh with him, and you birds [also]!'" (34:10) 

 "And unto Solomon [We made subservient] the wind; its morning course [covered 

the  distance  of]  a  month's  journey,  and  its  evening  course,  a  month's  journey.  And  We 

caused a fountain of molten copper to flow at his behest." (34:12) 

 "'Strike the rock with thy staff!' - whereupon twelve springs gushed forth." (2:60) 

 "And you heal those born blind, and the lepers, by My leave." (5:110) 

 Now  dwell  on  what  combined  human  thought  has  produced  and  the  thousands  of 

rational sciences it has deduced: each of them [is related to] one of the species [realms of 

being] in the universe, so that mankind has come to manifest "And He taught Adam all of 

 Now ponder over the railway and telegraph and other wonders of art deduced by 

human thought and by means of smelting iron and forging 

the names." (2:31)

became the basis of his industries 

copper, so that man came to manifest "and We softened iron for him," (34:10) and this 

 Think also about the aeroplanes that human minds incubated and hatched, which 

travel a month's journey in a day, so that humankind would come to manifest: "its morning 

course  [covered  the  distance  of]  a  month's  journey,  and  its  evening  course,  a  month's 

journey." (34:12) 

thy staff!'" (2:60) 

 And reflect on the progress achieved in tools invented through human enterprise, 

staffs  to  strike  arid  deserts,  causing  copious  springs  to  gush  forth  and  transforming  the 

sandy wastes into gardens, so that man is on the point of manifesting "'Strike the rock with 

 Now ponder over the wonders of medicine yielded by man's experiments that are 

beginning to heal those born blind and the lepers and the chronically sick, by Allâh's leave 

- you will see that [between the above verses and the future scientific discoveries] is a full 

correspondence  and  you  will  be  right  to  say  that  [those  miracles]  are  the  criteria  and 

measure  [of  those  future  discoveries],  and  that  the  miracles  point  to  them  and  urge 

[mankind to work to achieve] them. 

for Abraham." (21:69) 

 Similarly, consider such verses as: "We said: 'O fire! Be cool, and [a means of] safety 

 "  Had  he  not  seen  an  evidence  of  His  Lord."  (12:24)  That  is,  according  to  one 

narration, had he not had a vision of Jacob biting his finger. 

 "I do indeed scent the presence of Joseph." (12:94) 

 "O you mountains! Sing ye back the praises of Allâh with him." (34:10) 

 "O you people! We have been taught the speech of birds." (27:16) 

 "I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye." (27:40) 

 Now consider mankind's discovery of the degree of heat that does not burn and non-

inflammable materials; and the invention of means of attracting images and sounds from 

far off and bringing them to you before you can blink your eye; and 'speaking' machines 

[such as the radio]; and the employment of some species of birds like the pigeon and so 

on. You may see the agreement and congruity between these two sorts [of wonders], and 

may rightly say that [the verses] signify and allude to [the future discoveries]. 

 Similarly, reflect on the particular attribute of the Supreme Miracle [the Qur'an], 

articulate speech and thought, the peculiarity of humanity, and literature and eloquence. 

Now think about the highest means of training the human spirit, and the subtlest means of 

 

273 

purifying the conscience, and the finest way of adorning human thought, and the best at 

expanding the heart: 

 

#274 

this is none other than a sort of literature. For some unknown reason, this literature is the 

most extensive of sciences, it has the widest scope, is the most penetrating and effective, 

and the closest to the human heart. Indeed, it is the sultan of the sciences. Think over this 

carefully! 

positioning and the word-order: 

 [Like  the  previous  verses]  these  verses  have  three  aspects  related  to  their 

 The positioning of the [first] verse in relation to the preceding one has four aspects: 

 The First: When the Qur'an explains the wisdom in man's vicegerency in the previous 

verse it is the first part of the answer, and is more general [addressing] everyone, and the 

easiest and most convincing, and the most brief and concise. Then with this verse it gives 

an explanatory, detailed answer satisfying to both ordinary people and the elite. 

 The  Second:  Having  made  an  explicit  statement  about  man's  vicegerency  in  the 

previous verse, with this one it proves the question with the miracle of mankind in the face 

of the angels. 

 The  Third:  The  previous  verse  having  indicated  mankind's  superiority  over  the 

angels, this verse alludes to the cause of its superiority. 

 The  Fourth:  Having  hinted  with  the  previous  verse  at  mankind's  receiving  the 

supreme vicegerency of the earth, with this one it allusively advances arguments to support 

it. For by virtue of the diversity of man's abilities and the multiplicity of ways in which he 

can utilize things and the many sides to his knowledge, and his encompassing the universe 

with his five senses, external and inner, and especially with his boundless conscience, he 

is a comprehensive copy [of the world] and locus of all the manifestations [of the divine 

names]. You can see that contrary to the angels, he can relish the taste of things like honey 

in two ways or even more! So ponder over this! 

 The  positioning  of  the  verses'  phrases  is  naturally  smooth  and  fluent  to  the 

utmost degree: 

 The first [phrase "And He taught Adam the names of all things;"] verifies (tahqîq) 

the meaning of [the last phrase of the previous verse]: "I know what you know not," and 

elaborates what it states summarily and expounds its obscurities. Moreover, [the function 

of] the Most High's vicegerent on the earth is to execute His ordinances and apply His laws, 

 

274 

and this is dependent on full knowledge. So too, the thread and drift of the previous verse 

implies these [unstated words]: "So He created him and ordered his being, 

 

#275 

and  breathed  His  spirit  into  him  and  raised  him,  then  He  taught  him  the  names  and 

prepared him for the vicegerency." 

 Then,  since  [the  Most  High]  had  chosen  [Adam]  over  and  above  the  angels  and 

distinguished him [by conferring on him] knowledge of the names, [and had made clear] in 

this question of his superiority his worthiness of the vicegerency, the context being one of 

challenge, He presented the things to [the angels] seeking their objections. So perceiving 

their impotence, they affirmed the Most High's wisdom and were assured. For this reason 

the Qur'an says: "Then He presented them to the angels and said: 'Declare unto Me the 

names of these [things], if what you say is true."' 

 "They said (Qâl û):" that is, they declared themselves innocent of what in his egotism 

Iblis  had  insinuated  into  their  questioning,  saying:  "Limitless  are  You  in  Your  glory!  No 

knowledge have we save that which You have taught us. Verily, You alone are all-knowing, 

truly wise." 

[things]. "' 

 Then, once their impotence, arising from their lack of comprehensive abilities, had 

become clear, the context necessitated a statement of Adam's competence, in order to 

complete  the  challenge.  So  it  says:  "O  Adam,  convey  unto  them  the  names  of  these 

 Then,  when  the  underlying  reason  and  wisdom  had  become  exemplified  and 

apparent in Adam, the context (al-maqâm) necessitated the former concise reply, making 

it a sort of consequence of the detailed explanation here. So [the Qur'an] says: "Did I not 

say unto you: Verily, I alone know the hidden reality of the heavens and the earth, and 

know all that you bring into the open and all that you would conceal?" 

 This use of conversation divulges and intimates that Iblis' egotism had spread among 

the angels, and that the objections of one group [of devils] intervened in their questioning. 

 The positioning of the parts of the phrases: 

 The phrase "And He taught Adam the names of all things (Wa 'allama Adam al-

asmâ  kullahâ):"  that  is,  [the  Most  High]  fashioned  [Adam]  with  a  nature  in  which  were 

contained the fundamental principles of all types of attainment and perfection, and He 

created him with a disposition in which were planted the seeds of all elevated qualities, 

and He decked him out with ten senses, and a conscience that would hold the similitudes 

 

275 

of all beings. He prepared him [by giving him] these three faculties that He might teach 

him the realities of things in all their variety. Then He taught him all the names. 

 

#276 

conciseness (ellipsis). 

 The  [conjunction]  "And"  implies  the  above  phrases,  'rolled  up'  beneath  the 

 "He taught ('Allama)" allusively praises knowledge, and indicates its high degree and 

that it is the pivot of the vicegerency. It is a sign too that the names [of things] are made 

known by Allâh. This is corroborated by the relationships mostly obtaining between names 

and  the  things  they  signify.  It  suggests  too  that  miracles  are  an  act  of  Allâh  without 

intermediary, contrarily to [the claim] of the philosophers that wonders are the acts of 

wondrous spirits. 

 "Adam;" that is, the earthling whose vicegerency was willed by Allâh the Most High 

and  who  was  given  the  name  of  Adam  by  Him.  The  specific  mention  of  the  name  is  to 

applaud and proclaim it and to associate it with him. 

 "The names (al-asmâ'):" the attributes, characteristics, and appellations that signify 

things. Or the [myriad] languages [or words and terms - allughât] that the sons of Adam 

use  (lit.  have  divided  among  themselves).  Also,  as  indicated  by  "presented  them 

('aradahum)," it suggests that the names are identical to what they signify, as is claimed 

by the Sunnis. 

 "All of them (kullahâ)" is a clear statement of the source of [Adam's] distinction [vis-

â-vis  the  angels]  and  of  the  miracle  [of  the  names],  [That  is,  while  man  may  acquire 

complete knowledge of the names, the angels' knowledge is partial.] 

 The phrases: "Then He presented them to the angels and said: 'Declare unto Me 

the  names  of  these  [things],  if  what  you  say  is  true.'  (Thumma  'aradahum  'ala  al-

malâ'ika fa-qâla anbi'unî bi-asmâ'i hâ'ulâ'i in kuntum sâdiqin.)" 

 "Then  (thumma):"  by  reason  of  the  interval  (al-tarâkhî)  indicated  here,  and  as 

necessitated by the context (al-maqâm), this implies [the unstated words]: "And [Allâh] 

said: He is nobler than you and more worthy of the vicegerency." 

 "He presented them ('aradahum):" that is, as though offered for sale. He set out for 

their inspection things of all sorts, as though presenting wares to customers or parading 

the ranks to the commander. In this is an indication that for intelligent beings things are 

goods they may buy through knowledge, and take possession of through naming them (lit. 

their names), and appropriate through representing their forms. 

 

276 

 The  [pronominal  suffix]  "-hum  -  them"  is  used  for  masculine  rational  beings  so 

expounds the two things that render beings superior to others (taghlîb) 

 

#277 

[that is, masculinity and reason] and the metaphor hinted at by the word "He presented 

('arada)." For one imagines from [Allâh] despatching the varieties of beings which parade 

rank upon rank for inspection, that they are regiments (lit. tribes) of [masculine] intelligent 

beings advancing towards [the angels]. 

inscribed on the Sublime Tablet. 

 "To  ('alâ)"  hints  that  what  is  presented  to  [the  angels]  are  the  forms  [of  things] 

 Glory be unto to You, we have no knowledge save that which You have taught us; 

indeed You are All-Knowing, All-Wise. (2:32) 

 And the close of their cry will be: All praise be to Allâh, the Lord and Sustainer of 

all the worlds! (10:10) 

 [In a manner entirely outside my will, this verse occurred to me when I came to the 

end  of  most  of  the  Words  (Sözler)  and  Letters  (Mektûbat).  Now  I  realize  that  this 

commentary was concluded with the same verse, and that all the Words are a sort of true 

commentary on it and a sparkling stream issuing from its ocean, and at their conclusions 

pour [back] into it. It is as though all the Words gush forth [and begin] from the verse here 

at the end of this commentary. Hence, ever since that time [when the commentary was 

written] I have been unable to finish expounding the verse that I might begin its second 

volume. Said Nursi]
