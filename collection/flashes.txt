THE TWENTY-THIRD FLASH: On Nature ....................................... 236

The First Way: The formation of things through the coming together of 
causes in the universe. ................................................................................ 238

F i r s t   I m p o s s i b i l i t y :  The coming together by chance of the elements of 
living beings in perfect measure and balance. ........................................... 238

S e c o n d   I m p o s s i b i l i t y :   If  a  fly,  for  example,  is  attributed  to  causes,  it

T h i r d   I m p o s s i b i l i t y :  “ If a being has unity, it can only have issued from 
one  hand, ”  particularly  if  it  manifests  life,  together  with  perfect  order

S e c o n d   I m p o s s i b i l i t y :   The  particles  of  a  living  body  stand  together  in 
perfect balance and order; if they are not dependent on the master archi-
tect of the universe, each would have to be both dominant over all the 
others and subordinate to them. ................................................................. 241

T h i r d   I m p o s s i b i l i t y :  If your being is not ‘written’ by the pen of the All-
Powerful One, but ‘printed’ by nature and causes, there would have to be 
printing-blocks in nature to the number of cells in your body ................... 242
The Third Way: “ Nature necessitates it and makes it. ” .......................... 243

F i r s t   I m p o s s i b i l i t y :  If animate creatures are not ascribed directly to the 
manifestation of the Pre-Eternal Sun, each has to be a god with infinite 
attributes. .................................................................................................... 243

S e c o n d   I m p o s s i b i l i t y :  If attributed to nature, there would have to pres-
ent in each bit of soil the means by which innumerable flowers and fruits 
could grow and be formed. ........................................................................ 243

The First Flash 

The supplication of Yunus ibn Matta 1 ( Peace be upon our Prophet and 
upon  him )  is  a  most  powerful  supplication,  a  most  effective  means  for 
obtaining answer to prayer. 2 The gist of the celebrated story of Jonah ( Peace 
be upon him ) is as follows:

He  was  cast  into  the  sea  and  swallowed  by  a  large  fish.  The  sea  was 
stormy, the night turbulent and dark, and hope exhausted. But it was while 
he was in such a situation that his supplication:

( 21:87 ) t s r q p o n m l
acted for him as a swift means of salvation. The secret of his supplication’s 
power was this:

In that situation all causes were suspended, for Jonah needed to save him 
one whose command should constrain the whale and the sea, and the night 
and the sky. The night, the sea, and the whale were united against him. Only 
one whose command might subdue all three of these could bring him forth 
on the strand of salvation. Even if the entirety of creation had become his 
servants  and  helpers,  it  would  have  been  of  no  avail.  For  causes  have  no 
effect. Since Jonah saw with the eye of certainty that there was no refuge 
other than the Causer of Causes, and unfolded to him was the meaning of 
divine  oneness  within  the  light  of  divine  unity,  his  supplication  was  able 
suddenly to subdue the night, the sea, and the whale. Through the light of 
divine unity he was able to transform the belly of the whale into a subma-
rine; and the surging sea, which in its awesomeness resembled an erupting 
volcano, into a peaceable plain, a pleasant place of excursion. Through the 
light of unity, he was able to sweep the sky’s countenance clear of all clouds, 
and  to  set  the  moon  over  his  head  like  a  lantern.  Creation  that  had  been 
pressing and threatening him from all sides now showed him a friendly face

from every direction. Thus he reached the shore of salvation, where beneath 
the creeping-gourd tree he observed this favour of his Lord.

Now we are in a situation one hundred times more awesome than that 
in which Jonah ( Peace be upon him ) first found himself. Our night is the 
future. When we look upon our future with the eye of neglect, it is a hun-
dred times darker and more fearful than his night. Our sea is this spinning 
globe. Each wave of this sea bears on it thousands of corpses, and is thus 
a thousand times more frightening than his sea. Our fish is the caprice of 
our soul which strives to shake and destroy the foundation of our eternal 
life. This fish is a thousand times more maleficent than his. For his fish 
could destroy a hundred-year lifespan, whereas ours seeks to destroy a life 
lasting hundreds of millions of years. This being our true state, we should 
in imitation of Jonah ( Peace be upon him ) avert ourselves from all causes 
and  take  refuge  directly  in  the  Causer  of  Causes,  that  is,  our  Lord  and 
Sustainer. We should say: “ T h e r e   i s   n o   g o d   b u t   Yo u ,   G l o r y   b e   u n t o   Yo u !  
I n d e e d   I   w a s   a m o n g   t h e   w r o n g d o e r s , ” and understand with full certainty 
that it is only He who can repel from us the harm of the future, this world, 
and  caprice  of  our  souls,  united  against  us  because  of  our  neglect  and 
misguidance. For the future is subject to His command, the world to His 
jurisdiction, and our soul to His direction.

What cause is there other than the Creator of the heavens and earth who 
can know the most subtle and secret thoughts of our heart; who can lighten 
the future for us by establishing the hereafter; who can save us from the myr-
iad overwhelming waves of the world? No, outside that Necessarily Existent 
One, there is nothing that can in any way give aid and effect salvation except 
by His consent and command.

This being the case, considering that as a result of his supplication, the 
whale became for Jonah a vehicle, or a submarine, and the sea, a peaceable 
plain; and the night became gently lit for him by the moon, so too, we should 
make the same supplication: 

t s r q p o n m l
With  the  sentence o n m l  we  draw  the  gaze  of  mercy  upon  our 
future; with the word p we draw it upon our world; and with the 
phrase t s r q we draw it upon our soul. 1 Thus our future

is  illumined  with  the  light  of  belief  and  the  moonlike  luminosity  of  the 
Qur’an, and the awe and terror of the night are transformed into tranquillity 
and joy. Then too, embarking on the ship of the truth of Islam, fashioned in 
the dockyard of the Most Wise Qur’an, we may pass safely over the sea of 
this earthly abode, which through the alternation of life and death is boarded 
by corpses unnumbered, borne on the waves of the years and centuries, and 
cast into nothingness. Once aboard that ship we may reach the shore of sal-
vation  and  fulfil  our  life’s  duty.  The  tempest  and  surging  of  the  sea  will 
appear a series of pleasing images on a screen, and instead of inspiring terror 
and dread, will delight, caress and illumine the reflective and the meditative 
gaze. By virtue of the mystery of the Qur’an, and the effect of that Criterion 
of Truth and Falsehood, our soul will no longer ride us, but instead become 
our mount. As we ride it, it will be for us a powerful means for the attain-
ment of life everlasting.

I n   S h o r t : Man, in accordance with the comprehensive nature of his being, 
as he suffers and shakes with malaria, so also he suffers from the shaking 
and tremors of the earth, and the supreme convulsion of all beings on the 
Day of Resurrection. As he fears the infinitesimal microbe, he also fears the 
shooting star that appears among the heavenly bodies. As he loves his home, 
he also loves the wide world. As he loves his little garden, he also ardently 
loves infinite and eternal paradise. Man’s object of worship, Lord, refuge, 
saviour, and goal then can only be the One in the grasp of whose power is 
the whole universe, under whose command are both atom and planet. Man 
should therefore constantly say like Jonah ( Peace be upon him ):

The gist of the well-known story of Job 1 ( Upon whom be peace ) is as 

follows:

While  afflicted  with  numerous  wounds  and  sores  for  a  long  time,  he 
recalled the great recompense to be had for his sickness, and endured it with 
utmost patience. But later, when the worms generated by his wounds pen-
etrated to his heart and his tongue, the seat of the remembrance and knowl-
edge of Allah, 2 he feared that his duty of worship would suffer, and so he 
said in supplication not for the sake of his own comfort, but for the sake of 
his worship of Allah:

“ O  Lord!  Harm  has  afflicted  me;  my  remembrance  of  You  with 
my  tongue  and  my  worship  of  You  with  my  heart  will  suffer. ”  Allah 
Almighty then accepted this pure sincere, disinterested and devout sup-
plication in the most miraculous fashion. He granted to Job perfect good 
health and made manifest in him all kinds of compassion.  3 This Flash 
contains five points:

FIRST POINT

THE FLASHES

Corresponding to the outer wounds and sicknesses of Job ( Upon whom 
be  peace ),  we  have  inner  sicknesses  of  the  spirit  and  heart.  If  our  inner 
being were to be turned outward, and our outer being turned inward, we 
would appear more wounded and diseased than Job. For each sin that we 
commit and each doubt that enters our mind, inflicts wounds on our heart 
and our spirit.

The wounds of Job ( Upon whom be peace ) were of such a nature as to 
threaten his brief worldly life, but our inner wounds threaten our infinitely 
long  everlasting  life.  We  need  the  supplication  of  Job  thousands  of  times 
more  than  he  did  himself.  Just  as  the  worms  that  arose  from  his  wounds 
penetrated to his heart and tongue, so too the wounds that sin inflicts upon 
us and the temptations and doubts that arise from those wounds will – may 
Allah  protect  us!  –  penetrate  our  inner  heart,  the  seat  of  belief,  and  thus 
wound belief. Penetrating too the spiritual joy of the tongue, the interpreter 
of belief, they cause it to shun in revulsion the remembrance of Allah, and 
reduce it to silence.

Sin,  penetrating  to  the  heart,  will  blacken  and  darken  it  until  it  extin-
guishes the light of belief.  1 Within each sin is a path leading to unbelief. 
Unless that sin is swiftly obliterated by seeking Allah’s pardon, it will grow 
from a worm into a snake that gnaws on the heart.

For example, a man who secretly commits a shameful sin will fear the 
disgrace  that  results  if  others  become  aware  of  it.  Thus  the  existence  of 
angels and spirit beings will be hard for him to endure, and he will long to 
deny it, even on the strength of the slightest indication.

Similarly, one who commits a major sin deserving of the torment of Hell, 
will desire the non-existence of Hell wholeheartedly, and whenever he hears 
of the threat of Hell-fire, he will dare to deny it on the strength of a slight 
indication and doubt, unless he takes up in protection the shield of repent-
ance and seeking forgiveness.

Similarly, one who does not perform the obligatory prayer and fulfil his 
duty of worship will be affected by distress, just as he would be in case of 
the neglect of a minor duty toward some petty ruler. Thus, his laziness in 
fulfulling his obligation, despite the repeated commands of the Sovereign of 
Pre-Eternity, will distress him greatly, and on account of that distress will

ii, 297.

desire and say to himself: “ Would that there were no such duty of worship! ” 
In turn, there will arise from this desire a desire to deny Allah, which infers 
enmity toward Him. If some doubt concerning the existence of the Divine 
Being comes to his heart, he will be inclined to embrace it like a conclusive 
proof. A wide gate to destruction will be opened in front of him. The wretch 
does not know that although he is delivered by denial from the slight trouble 
of duty of worship, he has made himself, by that same denial, the target for 
milions of troubles that are far more awesome. Fleeing from the bite of a 
gnat, he welcomes the bite of the snake.

There  are  many  other  examples,  which  may  be  understood  with  refer-
ence to these three, so that the sense of, ( 83:14 ) O N M L K  will become 
apparent.

SECOND POINT

As was explained concerning the meaning of divine determining, known 
as destiny, in the Twenty-Sixth Word, men have no right to complain in the 
case of disasters and illness for the following three reasons: 

First Reason

First Reason: Allah Most High has made the garment of the body with 
which He has clothed man a manifestation of His art. He has made man to 
be a model on which He cuts, trims, alters and changes the garment of the 
body, thus displaying the manifestation of various of His names. Just as the 
name of Healer makes it necessary that illness should exist, so too the name 
of Provider requires that hunger should exist. And so on.
ُءاَ(cid:131)َ(cid:192)  َفْ(cid:193)ﯬﯦ ِهﯮﯧْ(cid:171)ُ(cid:174)  ِي(cid:158)  ُفَ

ّر َ(cid:135)َ(cid:99)َ(cid:192)  ِكْ(cid:171)ُ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)ا  ُكِ(cid:170)اَ(cid:174)

Second Reason

Second  Reason:  It  is  by  means  of  disasters  and  sicknesses  that  life  is 
refined, 1 perfected, strengthened and advanced; that it yields results, attains 
perfection and fulfils its own purpose. 2 Life led monotonously on the couch 
of ease and comfort resembles not so much the pure good that is being, as 
the pure evil that is non-being; it tends in fact in that direction. 

Third Reason

Third Reason: This worldly realm is the field of testing, the abode of 
service.  It  is  not  the  place  of  pleasure,  reward,  and  requital.  Considering, 
then,  that  it  is  the  abode  of  service  and  place  of  worship,  sicknesses  and 
misfortunes – as long as they do not affect belief and are patiently endured 
3 – conform fully to service and worship, and even strengthen it. Since they

24

THE FLASHES

make  each  hour’s  worship  equivalent  to  that  of  a  day,  1  one  should  offer 
thanks instead of complaining.

Worship  consists  in  fact  of  two  kinds,  positive  and  negative.  What  is 
meant by the positive is obvious. As for negative worship, this is when one 
afflicted with misfortune or sickness perceives his own weakness and help-
lessness, and turning to his Compassionate Lord, seeks refuge in Him, medi-
tates upon Him, petitions Him, and thus offers a pure form of worship that 
no  hypocrisy  can  penetrate.  If  he  endures  patiently,  thinks  of  the  reward 
attendant on misfortune and offers thanks, then each hour that he passes will 
count  as  a  whole  day  spent  in  worship.  His  brief  life  becomes  very  long. 
There are even cases where a single minute is counted as equal to a whole 
day’s worship.

I once was extremely anxious because of an awesome illness that struck 
one  of  my  brothers  of  the  hereafter,  Muhâcir  Hâfız  Ahmed.  2  But  then  a 
warning came to my heart: “ Congratulate him! ” Each minute he spends is 
counted as a whole day’s worship. He was in any event enduring his illness 
in patience and gratitude.

THIRD POINT

As  we  have  pointed  out  in  one  or  two  of  the  Wo r d s ,  whenever  one 
thinks  of  his  past  life,  he  will  say  in  his  heart  or  with  his  tongue  either 
“ Ah! ” or “ Oh! ” That is he will either experience regret, or say “ Thanks 
and praise be to Allah! ” Regret is inspired by the pains arising from the 
cessation of former pleasures and separation from them. For the cessation 
of pleasure is a pain in itself. Sometimes a momentary pleasure will cause 
everlasting pain. To think upon it will be like lancing a wound, causing 
regret to gush forth.

As  for  the  lasting  spiritual  pleasure  that  comes  from  the  cessation  of 
momentary  pains  experienced  in  the  past,  it  inspires  man  to  exclaim, 
“ Thanks and praise be to Allah! ” In addition to this innate tendency of man, 
if he thinks of the reward that results from misfortune and the requital that 
awaits  him  in  the  hereafter,  if  he  realizes  that  his  brief  life  will  count  as

a long life because of misfortune, then instead of being merely patient he 
should be thankful. He should say, 
  1 ِل َ(cid:203) َ

ّ(cid:139)(cid:170)اَو ِرْ(cid:159)ﯭﯧْ(cid:170)ا ىَو ِ(cid:126)  ٍلاَ(cid:110)  ّ

ِلﯭﯦ ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) ِ

ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا

It is commonly said that misfortune is longlasting. Indeed it is, but not 
because it is troublesome and distressing as people customarily imagine, but 
rather because it yields vital results just like a long life.

FOURTH POINT

As  was  explained  in  the  First  Station  of  the  Twenty-First  Word,  the 
power  of  patient  endurance  given  to  man  by  Allah  Almighty  is  adequate 
to every misfortune, unless squandered on baseless fears. But through the 
predominance  of  delusion,  man’s  neglect  and  his  imagining  this  transient 
life to be eternal, he squanders his power of endurance on the past and the 
future. His endurance is not equal to the misfortunes of the present, and he 
begins to complain. It is as if – Allah forbid! – he were complaining of Allah 
Almighty to men. In a most unjustified and even lunatic fashion, he com-
plains and demonstrates his lack of patience.

If the day that is past held misfortune, the distress is now gone, and only 
tranquillity remains; the pain has vanished and the pleasure in its cessation 
remains; the trouble is gone, and the reward remains. Hence one should not 
complain but give thanks for enjoyment. One should not resent misfortune, 
but love it. The transient life of the past comes to be counted as an eternal 
and blessed life because of misfortune. To think upon past pain with one’s 
fancy and then to waste part of one’s patience is lunacy.

As far as days yet to come are concerned, since they have not yet come, 
to think now of the illness or misfortune to be borne during them and dis-
play impatience, is also foolishness. To say to oneself “ Tomorrow or the 
day after I will be hungry and thirsty ” and constantly to drink water and eat 
bread today, is pure madness. Similarly, to think of misfortunes and sick-
nesses yet in the future but now non-existent, to suffer them already, to show 
impatience and to oppress oneself without any compulsion, is such stupidity 
that it no longer deserves pity and compassion. 

In  short,  just  as  gratitude  increases  divine  bounty,  so  too  complaint 

increases misfortune, and removes all occasion for compassion.

During World War One, a blessed person in Erzurum was afflicted with 
an  awesome  disease.  I  went  to  visit  him  and  he  said  to  me  complaining

bitterly: “ I have not been able to place my head on the pillow and sleep 
for a hundred nights. ” I was much grieved. Suddenly a thought came to 
me and I said:

“ Brother,  the  hundred  difficult  days  you  have  spent  are  now  just  like 
one hundred happy days. Do not think of them and complain; rather look 
at them and be grateful. As for future days, since they have not yet come, 
place  your  trust  in  your  Compassionate  and  Merciful  Lord.  Do  not  weep 
before being beaten, do not be afraid of nothing, do not give non-being the 
colour  of  being.  Think  of  the  present  hour;  your  power  of  patient  endur-
ance is enough for this hour. Do not act like the maddened commander who 
expects reinforcement on his right wing by an enemy force deserting to join 
him from his left, and then begins to disperse his forces in the centre to the 
left and the right, before the enemy has joined him on the right. The enemy 
then destroys his centre, left weak, with a minimal force. Brother, do not be 
like him. Mobilize all your strength for this present hour, and think of divine 
mercy, reward in the hereafter, and how your brief and transient life is being 
transformed into a long and eternal form. Instead of complaining bitterly, 
give joyful thanks. ”

Much  relieved,  he  said,  “ Praise  and  thanks  be  to  Allah,  my  disease  is 

now a tenth of what it was before. ”

FIFTH POINT consisting of three matters.

First Matter

First Matter: True and harmful misfortune is that which affects religion. 
One should at all times seek refuge at the divine court from misfortune in 
matters of religion and cry out for help. 1 But misfortunes that do not affect 
religion in reality are not misfortunes. Some of them are warnings from the 
Most  Merciful  One.  If  a  shepherd  throws  a  stone  at  his  sheep  when  they 
trespass on another’s pasture, they understand that the stone is intended as a 
warning to save them from a perilous action; full of gratitude they turn back. 
2 So too there are many apparent misfortunes that are divine warnings and 
admonishments, others that constitute the penance of sin; 3 and others again 
that dissolve man’s state of neglect, remind him of his human helplessness 
and weakness, thus affording him a form of tranquillity. As for the variety 
of misfortune that is illness, it is not at all a misfortune, as has already been

said, but rather a favour from Allah and a means of purification. 1 There is a 
tradition which says: “ As a tree drops its ripe fruit when shaken, so do sins 
fall away through the shaking of fever. ” 2

Job ( Upon whom be peace ) did not pray in his supplication for the com-
fort  of  his  soul,  but  rather  sought  cure  for  the  purpose  of  worship,  when 
disease was preventing his remembrances of Allah with his tongue and his 
meditation upon Allah in his heart. We too should make our primary intent, 
when  making  that  supplication,  the  healing  of  the  inward  and  spiritual 
wounds that arise from sinning.

As far as physical diseases are concerned, we may seek refuge from them 
when they hinder our worship. But we should seek refuge in a humble and 
supplicating fashion, not protestingly and plaintively. If we accept Allah as 
our Lord and Sustainer, then we must accept too all that He gives us in His 
capacity of Lord. To sigh and complain in a manner implying objection to 
divine determining and decree is a kind of criticism of divine determining, 
an accusation levelled against Allah’s compassion. The one who criticizes 
divine determining strikes his head against the anvil and breaks it. Whoever 
accuses  Allah’s  mercy  will  inevitably  be  deprived  of  it.  To  use  a  broken 
hand to exact revenge will only cause further damage to the hand. So too a 
man who, afflicted with misfortune, responds to it with protesting complaint 
and anxiety, is only compounding his misfortune.

Second Matter

Second  Matter:  Physical  misfortunes  grow  when  they  are  seen  to  be 
large,  and  shrink  when  they  are  seen  to  be  small.  For  example,  a  dream 
enters one’s vision at night. If one pays it attention it swells up and grows; 
if one does not, it disappears. So too if one attempts to ward off an attacking 
swarm of bees, they will become more aggressive; whereas if one pays them 
no  attention  they  will  disperse.  Thus  if  one  regards  physical  misfortunes 
as great and grants them importance, they will grow, and because of anxi-
ety pass from the body and strike root in the heart. The result will then be 
an inward affliction on which the outward misfortune fastens to perpetuate 
itself. But if the anxiety is removed by contentment with the divine decree 
and reliance on Allah, the physical misfortune will gradually decrease, dry 
up and vanish, just like a tree whose roots have been severed. I once com-
posed the following verses in description of this truth:

1.  See,  M u s l i m , Birr, 52;  A b ū   D ā ’ ū d , Janā’iz, 1; al-Daylamī,  a l - M u s n a d , i, 123; al-

If in single-handed combat one smiles at an awesome enemy, his enmity 
will be changed to conciliatoriness; his hostility will become a mere joke, 
will  shrink  and  disappear.  If  one  confronts  misfortune  with  reliance  on 
Allah, the result will be similar.

Third Matter

Third Matter: Each age has particular characteristics.  1 In this age of 
neglect misfortune has changed its form. In certain ages and for certain per-
sons, misfortune is not in reality misfortune, but rather a divine favour. Since 
I consider those afflicted with illness in the present age to be fortunate – on 
condition that their illness does not affect their religion – it does not occur to 
me to oppose illness and misfortune, nor to take pity on the afflicted. When-
ever I encounter some afflicted youth, I find that he is more concerned with 
his religious duties and the hereafter than are his peers. From this I deduce 
that illnesses of that sort do not constitute a misfortune for such people, but 
rather a bounty from Allah. It is true that illness causes him distress in his 
brief, transient and worldly life, but it is beneficial for his eternal life. It is to 
be regarded as a kind of worship. If he were healthy he would be unable to 
maintain the state he enjoyed while sick and would fall into dissipation, as 
a result of the impetuousness of youth and the dissipated nature of the age.
Conclusion
Allah Almighty, in order to display His infinite power and unlimited 
mercy, has made inherent in man infinite impotence and unlimited want. 
Further, in order to display the endless embroideries of His names, He has 
created  man  like  a  machine  capable  of  receiving  unlimited  varieties  of 
pain, as well as infinite varieties of pleasure. Within that human machine

are hundreds of instruments, each of which has different pains and pleas-
ures, different duties and rewards. Simply, all of the divine names mani-
fested  in  the  macroanthropos  that  is  the  world  also  have  manifestations 
in the microcosm that is man. Beneficial matters like good health, well-
being,  and  pleasures  cause  man  to  offer  thanks  and  prompt  the  human 
machine to perform its functions in many respects, and thus man becomes 
like a factory producing thanks.

Similarly, by means of misfortune, illness and pain, and other motion-
inducing  contingencies,  the  other  cogs  of  the  human  machine  are  set 
in  motion  and  revolution.  The  mine  of  weakness,  impotence,  and  pov-
erty inherent in human nature is made to work. It induces in man a state 
whereby he seeks refuge and help not only with a single tongue, but with 
the tongue of each of his members. Thus by means of those contingencies 
man becomes like a moving pen comprising thousands of different pens. 
He inscribes the appointed course of his existence on the page of his life 
or the Tablet in the World of Similitudes; he puts forth a declaration of 
the divine names; and becomes himself an ode to the glory of Allah, thus 
fulfilling the duties of his nature.

The Third Flash 

[ Emotion and spiritual pleasure have become mixed in this Flash to 
an extent, and since their exuberance does not much heed the princi-
ples of the intellect or the scales of thought nor conform to them, it 
should not be weighed up on the scales of logic. ]

(cid:2)(cid:3)

( 28:88 ) o n m l k j i h g f 
The  two  phrases, يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا  َتْ(cid:178)َا يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:92) اَ(cid:192) * يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا  َتْ(cid:178)َا يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:92) اَ(cid:192)  both  express  the 
meaning of the above verse, and state two important truths. It was because of 
this that some of the chiefs of the Naqshbandi Order compiled some special 
invocations based on repetition of the phrases, and held it to be a concise 
set of Naqshi supplications. Seeing that the two phrases express the verse’s 
meaning,  we  shall  explain  several  points  concerning  the  two  signiﬁcant 
truths they state.

FIRST POINT

The first time يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا  َتْ(cid:178)َا يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:92) اَ(cid:192) is recited, like a surgical operation it sev-

ers the heart from everything other than Allah. It is as follows:

By virtue of his comprehensive nature, man is connected with almost all 
beings. Also included in his nature is a boundless capacity to love. For these 
reasons he nurtures love towards all beings. He both loves the huge world 
as though it were his house, and he loves eternal Paradise as though it were 
his garden. However, the beings he loves do not stop, they depart, and he 
constantly suffers the pain of separation. That boundless love of his becomes 
the means of boundless torment.

However, the fault in suffering such torment is his, for he was given a 
heart with an infinite capacity to love in order to direct it toward One pos-
sessing infinite undying beauty. By misusing it and spending it on transitory 
beings, he has done wrong and suffers the punishment for his fault through 
the pain of separation.

30

THIRD FLASH

31

Thus, the first time he utters: يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا  َتْ(cid:178)َا يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:92) اَ(cid:192), it severs his attachment to 
transitory beings; he leaves those objects of love before they leave him and 
he is thus cleared of his fault. It declares that love should be restricted to the 
Eternal Beloved, and expresses this meaning: “ You are the only being that 
endures! Everything other than You is transient. My heart cannot become 
attached  to  anything  transient,  for  it  was  created  for  everlasting  love,  to 
feel  ardour  lasting  from  pre-eternity  to  post-eternity.  Since  those  innu-
merable  beloveds  are  transitory  and  they  leave  me  and  depart,  declaring, 
يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا  َتْ(cid:178)َا يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:92) اَ(cid:192)  I  shall  leave  them  before  they  leave  me.  Only  You  are 
immortal, and I know and believe that beings can only be immortal by Your 
making them so. In which case, they should be loved with love of You. They 
are not otherwise worthy of the heart’s affection. ”

When in this state, the human heart gives up innumerable objects of love; 
beholding the stamp of transitoriness on their beauty, it severs its attachment 
to them. It otherwise suffers wounds to the number of its beloveds. The sec-
ond يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا  َتْ(cid:178)َا يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:92) اَ(cid:192) is both a salve and an antidote for those wounds. That 
is, “  يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:92) اَ(cid:192) Since You are Enduring, that is sufficient, You take the place of 
everything. Since You exist, everything exists! ”

Yes, the beauty, bounty, and perfection in beings, which excite love, are 
generally signs of the Truly Enduring One’s beauty and bounty and perfec-
tions, and passing through many veils, are pale shadows of them; indeed, 
they are the shadows of the shadows of the manifestations of His most beau-
tiful names.

SECOND POINT

Included  in  human  nature  is  an  intense  love  of  immortality.  Even, 
because of his power of imagination, man fancies a sort of immortality in 
everything he loves. He cries out from the depths of his being whenever he 
thinks of or sees their passing. All lamentations at separation are expressions 
of the weeping caused by love of immortality. If there were no imagined 
immortality, there would be no love. It might even be said that the intense 
desire for immortality in human nature arising from that passionate love 
of immortality, and from the spontaneous general prayer for immortality, 
is a reason for the existence of the eternal realm and everlasting Paradise. 
The Enduring One of Glory accepted man’s intense, unshakeable, innate 
desire and his powerful, effective, general prayer, for He created an eternal 
realm for him, a transient being.

THE FLASHES

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  the  Munificent  and  Compassionate  Creator 
would accept the insignificant wish of the tiny stomach and its supplica-
tion through the tongue of disposition for a temporary immortality by cre-
ating innumerable delicious foods, and not accept the intense desire of all 
humankind, which arises from an overpowering innate need, and its uni-
versal, constant, rightful, just prayer for immortality, offered through word 
and state? Allah forbid, a hundred thousand times! It is impossible that He 
would not accept it. Not to accept it would be in keeping with neither his 
wisdom, nor His justice, nor His mercy, nor His power.

Since man is most desirous of immortality, all his perfections and pleas-
ures are dependent upon it. And since immortality is particular to the Enduring 
One of Glory; and since the Enduring One’s names are enduring and immor-
tal; and since the Enduring One’s mirrors take on the hue of the Enduring 
One, and reflect His decree, and manifest a sort of immortality; for sure the 
matter most important for man, his most pressing duty, is to form a relation 
with that Enduring One and to adhere to His names. For everything expended 
on the way of the Enduring One receives a sort of immortality. The second 
يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا  َتْ(cid:178)َا يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:92) اَ(cid:192) expresses this truth. In addition to healing man’s innumer-
able spiritual wounds, it satisfies the intense wish for immortality inherent 
in his nature.

THIRD POINT

In this world, the effects of time on the transience and passing of things  
differ  greatly.  Beings  are  one  within  the  other  like  concentric  circles,  yet 
they differ in regard to the speed of their passage.

Just as the hands of a clock counting the seconds, and those counting 
the minutes, hours, and days superficially resemble each other but differ 
in respect of their speed, so too the spheres of the body, soul, heart, and 
spirit in man differ from one another. For example, the body possesses an 
immortality,  a  life,  and  an  existence  in  the  present  day,  and  even  in  the 
present hour while its past and future are dead and non-existent, but the 
heart’s sphere of existence and life extends from many days previous to 
the present day and to many days in the future. Then the sphere of the spirit 
is vast; its life and existence extends from years previous to the present day 
to years subsequent to it.

By virtue of this capacity – in respect of knowledge, love, and worship 
of Allah the Lord and Sustainer and the pleasure of that Most Merciful One, 
from which spring the life of the heart and spirit – transient life in this world 
contains within it a perpetual life, results in an eternal life, and resembles 
everlasting life.

THIRD FLASH

Yes, one second on the way of love, knowledge, and pleasure of the Truly 
Enduring One is like a year, otherwise a year is a second. A single second, 
even, on His way is immortal and many years. A hundred years of the people 
of neglect looking to this world are like a single second. There is the famous 
saying: ٌةَ(cid:179) ِ(cid:126)  ِلاَ(cid:134)ِوْ(cid:170)ا ُةَ(cid:179)َ(cid:126)َو ٌةَ(cid:179)َ(cid:126)  ِقاَرِ(cid:159)ْ(cid:170)ا ُةَ(cid:179) ِ(cid:126) I say the complete opposite to this: 
a moment’s union for Allah’s sake within the bounds of the Enduring One 
of Glory’s pleasure is a window opening onto not a year’s union, but per-
manent union. While not one year but perhaps a thousand spent in heedless-
ness and misguidance pass in an instant. There is a saying more famous that 
ْ(cid:202)ا َعَ(cid:174) ِة َ(cid:203)َ(cid:159)ْ(cid:170)ا  ُضْرَا   1
confirms this:  ٌناَدْ(cid:193)َ(cid:174)  ِباَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:110)َ
An explicit meaning of the first well-known saying above is this: since 
union with transitory beings is transient, however long it lasts it seems brief. 
A year of such union is as fleeting as a second; it is an illusion, a dream, 
causing regret and sorrow. Since the human heart desires immortality, it can 
receive in one year’s union only the tiniest pleasure within a fraction of a 
second, and a moment’s separation is like not one year but many. For the 
arena of separation is broad. If only for a second, separation inflicts years 
of destruction on the heart, since it yearns for eternity. For it bodes of innu-
merable separations. As for physical and lowly loves, for them the past and 
future are filled with separations.

ّمَ(cid:126)      ٌناَ(cid:107)ْ(cid:179)ِ(cid:158)  ِءاَدْ(cid:150)َ

ْ(cid:202)ا َعَ(cid:174)  ِطاَ(cid:193) ِ(cid:115)ْ(cid:170)ا ُ

While on the subject, we say this: O man! Do you want to make your brief 
and useless life immortal, long, beneficial, and fruitful? Since such a wish 
is demanded by humanity, spend your life on the way of the Truly Enduring 
One. For everything turned to that Enduring One receives the manifestation 
of immortality.

Since  everyone  fervently  desires  long  life  and  yearns  for  immortality; 
and since there is a means of transforming this fleeting life into perpetual 
life and it is possible to make it lengthy; for sure anyone who has not lost 
his humanity will seek out the means and try to convert the possibility into 
reality  and  will  act  accordingly.  Yes,  the  means  is  this:  work  for  Allah’s 
sake, meet with others for Allah’s sake, labour for Allah’s sake; act within 
the bounds of  “ For Allah, for Allah’s sake, on account of Allah. ” 2 Then all 
the moments of your life will be turned into years.

Alluding to this truth, verses of the Qur’an state that a single night such 
as the Night of Power is the equivalent of a thousand months, that is, around

eighty years. The expansion of time, a tried principle among the people of 
sainthood and reality, also alludes to this truth. For through its mystery, a 
few minutes’ Ascension become many years and prove the existence of this 
truth and demonstrate it in fact. The few hours of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) 
Ascension had the length, breadth, and comprehensiveness of thousands of 
years, for by way of it he entered the world of eternity, and a few minutes of 
that world comprise thousands of years of this world.

There  are,  besides  this,  the  numerous  occurrences  of  the  expansion  of 
time experienced by the saints, constructed on this truth. It is related that 
some of them did a day’s work in a single minute, and others performed a 
year’s duties in an hour, while others recited the whole Qur’an in the space 
of a minute. Such veracious people of truth would never knowingly stoop to 
lying. There can be no doubt that they observed exactly the fact of the expan-
sion of time, 1 which has been thus numerously and unanimously reported.
The expansion of time experienced in dreams is a sort confirmed by eve-
ryone. Sometimes a day in the waking world, or many days, would be neces-
sary to experience the happenings, words, pleasures, and pains experienced 
in a minute’s dream.

I n    S h o r t :  For  sure  man  is  transitory,  but  he  was  created  for  immortal-
ity and to be a mirror to the Enduring One, and he was charged with duties 
which produce eternal fruits, and was given a form that is the means to mani-
festing the impresses of an Enduring One’s eternal names. In which case, his 
true duty and happiness is to cling with all his powers and faculties to the 
names of that Perpetually Enduring One within the bounds of those things 
that please Him; it is to be turned towards Him, and to go to Him. As man’s 
tongue utters يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا  َتْ(cid:178)َا يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:92) اَ(cid:192) so his heart, spirit, mind, and all his subtle

This describes the perfect compassion and mercy of Allah’s Noble Mes-
senger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) towards his community. Accord-
ing to sound narrations, when at the terror of the resurrection everyone includ-

will demonstrate his pity and compassion 1 by calling out: “ My community! 
My community! ” 2 As is affirmed by those who disclose the realities, when 
he was born, his mother heard the same words among his supplications.  3 
Then the whole history of his life, as well as the benevolence he taught dem-
onstrate his perfect compassion and clemency. Also, by evincing an infinite 
need  for  his  community’s  innumerable  prayers,  4  he  showed  a  boundless 
compassion,  for  he  showed  that  because  of  it  he  was  concerned  with  the 
happiness  of  all  of  them.  You  can  understand,  therefore,  how  lacking  in 
gratitude  and  conscience  it  is  not  to  observe  the  practices  of  so  kind  and 
compassionate a leader.

Second Point

SECOND POINT

Among the universal, general duties of his prophethood, Allah’s Noble 
Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  displayed  great  com-
passion in certain particular, minor matters. Superficially, his behaving so 
kindly  in  such  matters  seems  unfitting  for  the  supreme  importance  of  the 
prophetic mission. But in reality, such minor matters were the tips or sam-
ples of a chain that would be the means whereby a universal, general func-
tion of prophethood would be fulfilled. The greatest importance was there-
fore given to the sample for the sake of the mighty chain.

For example, the extraordinary gentleness Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) 
showed towards Hasan and Husayn in their childhood and the great impor-
tance he gave them 5 was not only out of love and natural kindness and fam-
ily feeling, it was rather because they were each the tip of a luminous thread 
of the office of prophethood, and the source, sample, and index of a commu-
nity of great consequence which would receive the legacy of prophethood.

Indeed,  the  Messenger  ( UWBP )  used  to  take  Hasan  ( May  Allah  be 
pleased with him ) tenderly into his arms and kiss his head 6 for the sake of 
the luminous, blessed, Mahdi-like descendants who would spring from him, 
such  as  Shah  Geylani,  the  Ghawth  al-A‘zam,  7  who  would  be  the  inheri-
tors  of  prophethood  and  would  uphold  the  sacred  Shari‘a  of  Muhammad.

He saw with the eye of prophethood the sacred services they would perform 
in  the  future,  and  applauded  them.  1  He  kissed  Hasan’s  head  as  a  sign  of 
approval and encouragement.

Also, he embraced Husayn ( May Allah be pleased with him ) and showed 
him importance and tenderness in the name of the illustrious Imams like Zayn 
al-‘Abidin and Ja‘far al-Sadiq, and the numerous Mahdi-like luminous per-
sons, the true inheritors of prophethood, who would spring from his effulgent 
line,  and  kissed  his  neck  on  account  of  the  religion  of  Islam  and  office  of 
prophethood. 

Since  with  his  Unseen-percipient  heart,  the  Prophet  Muhammad’s 
( UWBP ) luminous vision and future-penetrating eye observed from the Era 
of Bliss in this world the Assembly of the Resurrection on the side of post-
eternity,  and  from  the  earth  saw  Paradise,  and  the  angels  in  the  sky,  and 
watched events which had occurred since the time of Adam and were con-
cealed in the dark veils of the past, and even beheld the vision of the All-
Glorious One, he surely saw the spiritual poles and the Imams who were to 
be the inheritors of prophethood, and the Mahdis, who would follow on in 
the lines of Hasan and Husayn. And for sure he would kiss their heads in 
the name of all of them. Yes, Shah Geylani has a large part in his kissing 
Hasan’s head.

Third Point

According to one interpretation, the verse: 3 2 1 0 ( 42:23 )  has 
the meaning: “ Allah’s Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) wants no reward for ful-
filling the duties of messengership; he wants only love for his family. ”

I f   i t   i s   a s k e d :   According  to  this,  it  seems  there  is  an  advantage  to  be 

gained from a family relationship. Whereas, according to the meaning of:

( 49:13 ) U T S R Q
prophethood functions in respect of closeness to Allah, not of family rela-
tionships?

The Answer: With his vision that penetrated the Unseen, Allah’s Most 
Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) saw that his family would become a light-giving 
tree in the world of Islam. It would be from his family that the overwhelming 
majority of those persons who would act as guides and preceptors instruct-
ing every level of the world of Islam in human attainment and perfection 
would emerge. He divined that his community’s prayer for his family in the 
final section of the prescribed prayers:

would be accepted. That is to say, just as the vast majority of the luminous 
guides among the people of Abraham were prophets of Abraham’s family 
and line, 2 so he saw in his community the spiritual poles of his family per-
forming the momentous duties of Islam, and in most of the paths and Sufi 
orders,  like  the  prophets  of  Israel.  3  Therefore,  being  commanded  to  say: 
3 2 1 0 / . - , +  he  wanted  his  community  to  love  his 
family.

There  are  numerous  narrations  corroborating  this  fact.  He  repeatedly 
decreed: “ I   l e a v e   y o u   t w o   t h i n g s .   I f   y o u   a d h e r e   t o   t h e m ,   y o u   w i l l   f i n d   s a l -
v a t i o n :   o n e   i s   A l l a h ’s   B o o k ,   t h e   o t h e r   i s   m y   F a m i l y . ” 4 For members of his 
family  were  the  source  and  guardians  of  his  practices  (   S u n n a   )   and  were 
charged with complying with them in every respect. This is why what was 
intended by this Hadith was adherence to the Book and the Prophet’s prac-
tices.  That  is  to  say,  in  respect  of  the  office  of  messengership  it  was  the 
Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices that were sought from his family. So no one 
who  abandoned  his  practices  could  truly  be  a  member  of  his  family,  nor 
could such a person not be a true friend to them. 5

Also,  the  reason  he  desired  his  community  to  gather  round  his  family 
6 was that, with Allah’s permission, he knew it was going to become very 
numerous in the course of time, and that Islam was going to become weak. 
An  extremely  strong  and  large  mutually  supportive  group  of  people  was 
therefore necessary to be the instrument through which the Islamic world 
would progress spiritually and morally, with divine permission. He thought 
of this and desired that his community should gather round his family.

Indeed,  even  if  the  members  of  the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  family  were 
not greatly in advance of others in matters of belief and faith, they were 
still far ahead of them in regard to submission, partiality, and partisanship.

For they were followers of Islam by nature, birth, and temperament. Even 
if natural partiality is weak and unworthy, or unjustifiable even, it cannot 
be given up. So would it be possible for a person to give up his support 
for a truth to which all his forefathers – who were most strong, most con-
stant and true, and most illustrious – had been bound, and through which 
they had won glory, and for which they had sacrificed their lives, a truth 
the person clearly felt to be so fundamental and natural? Thus, due to this 
intense partiality and natural submission, the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) family 
accepted the least hint in favour of the religion of Islam as though it were 
a powerful proof. For they were partial by nature. Others become partial 
only after some powerful proof.

Fourth Point

FOURTH POINT

In connection with the Third Point, we shall indicate briefly a matter that 
has been disputed by the Shi‘ites and the Sunnis and has been magnified to 
such an extent that it has been included in the books on doctrine, among the 
fundamentals of belief. 1

The Sunnis say: “ ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) was the fourth of 
the Rightly-Guided Caliphs. Abu Bakr the Veracious ( May Allah be pleased 
with  him )  was  superior  to  him  and  was  more  deserving  of  the  Caliphate, 
therefore  it  passed  to  him  first. ”  2  While  the  Shi‘ites  say:  “ It  was  ‘Ali’s 
right. An injustice was done to him. ‘Ali was the most worthy of them all. ” 
A summary of the arguments for their claims is this. They say: “ The Hadiths 
of the Prophet ( UWBP ) about ‘Ali,  3 and with his title of King of Saint-
hood  his  being  the  recognized  authority  of  the  vast  majority  of  the  saints 
and spiritual paths, and his extraordinary knowledge, courage, and worship, 
and the Prophet’s ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) intense concern for 
him and towards his descendants all show that he was the most worthy. The 
Caliphate was always his right; it was seized from him. ”

The Answer: The fact that ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) for 
over  twenty  years  followed  the  first  three  Caliphs,  whom  he  repeatedly 
acknowledged, 4 and held the position of their Shaykh al-Islam, refutes these 
claims of the Shi‘ites. Furthermore, the victories of Islam and the struggles 
against its enemies in the time of the first three Caliphs and the events in

‘Ali’s time, refute the Shi‘ites’ claims, again from the point of view of the 
Islamic Caliphate. That is to say the Sunnis’ claim is rightful.

I f   i t   i s   s a i d ,  there are two sorts of Shi‘ites, the Sainthood Shi‘a and the 
Caliphate Shi‘a. Because they mixed hatred and politics the second group 
may have been unjust, but the first group were not concerned with partisan 
politics. However, the Sainthood Shi‘a joined the Caliphate Shi‘a. That is, 
some  of  the  saints  of  the  Sufi  orders  looked  on  ‘Ali  as  superior  and  they 
endorsed the claims of the Caliphate Shi‘a.

The Answer: ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) has to be considered 
in two respects. One is from the point of view of his personal perfections 
and rank, and the other is from the point of view of his representing the col-
lective personality of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) family. As for this collective 
personality, it displays an aspect of the Most Noble Messenger’s ( UWBP ) 
essential nature.

Thus, in regard to the first point, foremost ‘Ali himself and all the people 
of truth gave precedence to Abu Bakr and ‘Umar.  1 They saw their ranks 
as higher in the service of Islam and closeness to Allah. As for the second 
point,  as  the  representative  of  the  collective  personality  of  the  Prophet’s 
( UWBP )  family,  which  represents  an  aspect  of  the  Muhammadan  Truth, 
‘Ali  has  no  equal.  The  highly  laudatory  Hadiths  about  ‘Ali  2  look  to  this 
second point. There is a sound narration that corroborates this: the Noble 
Messenger ( UWBP ) decreed: “ The descendants of each prophet are from 
himself. My descendants are those of ‘Ali. ” 3

The reason the Hadiths praising ‘Ali more than the other three Caliphs 
have become so widespread is that the people of truth, that is, the Sunnis, 
spread many narrations about him in response to the Umayyads and Khari-
jites attacking and disparaging him unjustly. The other Rightly-Guided Cal-
iphs were not subject to such criticism and detraction, so no need was felt to 
spread Hadiths about them.

Furthermore,  the  Prophet  ( UWBP )  saw  with  the  eye  of  prophethood 
the grievous events and internal strife to which ‘Ali would be exposed in 
the future, and in order to save him from despair and his community from

thinking unfavourably of him, he consoled him and guided his community 
with significant Hadiths like  ُه َ(cid:202)ْوَ(cid:174)  ٌ

The excessive love of the Sainthood Shi‘a towards ‘Ali ( May Allah be 
pleased with him ) and – influenced by the Sufi Orders – their deeming him 
superior,  does  not  make  them  answerable  to  the  degree  of  the  Caliphate 
Shi‘a. For those who follow the path of sainthood look towards their spir-
itual guides with love, and the mark of love is excess; 2 it wants to see the 
beloved as greater than his rank. And that is how it sees him. Ecstatics may 
be forgiven excesses of love. So their deeming ‘Ali more worthy because of 
their love may be excused on condition it does not turn into disparagement 
of the other Rightly-Guided Caliphs and enmity towards them, and does not 
go beyond the fundamental teachings of Islam.

As for the Caliphate Shi‘a, since political prejudice took a hold of them 
they  could  not  rid  themselves  of  hatred  and  aggression,  so  forfeited  their 
ِبُ(cid:111)ِ(cid:170)  َ(cid:202) 
right to be excused. Even, confirming the saying, َر َ(cid:175)ُ(cid:150) 
since Persian national pride was wounded at ‘Umar’s hand,  3 they showed 
their revenge in the form of love of ‘Ali. So also ‘Amr ibn al-‘As’s rebellion 
against ‘Ali and ‘Umar ibn al-Sa‘d’s tragic war against Husayn 4 aroused in 
the Shi‘a an intense anger and enmity towards the name of ‘Umar.

The Sainthood Shi‘a have no right to criticize the Sunnis, for the Sun-

the  excessive  love  which  is  described  as  dangerous  in  Hadiths.  5  The 
Prophet’s ( UWBP ) praise of ‘Ali’s followers in the Hadiths  6 refers to 
the Sunnis. For it is the Sunnis among ‘Ali’s followers who love him in 
a moderate fashion and are the people of truth. Just as excessive love of

made clear in sound Hadiths that that sort of excessive love for ‘Ali is 
dangerous. 1

I f   t h e   S a i n t h o o d   S h i ‘ a   s a y :  “ Once ‘Ali’s consummate spiritual attain-
ments  are  accepted,  it  is  impossible  to  give  precedence  to  Abu  Bakr  the 
Truthful. ”

The reply: It was as though the personal perfections of Abu Bakr, the 
Supremely Veracious, and ‘Umar, the Supreme Distinguisher between True 
and False ( May Allah be pleased with them ), had been placed in the pan 
of  some  scales  together  with  their  achievements  during  their  Caliphates, 
realized through their performance of the duties inherited from the Prophet 
( UWBP ), and in the other pan had been placed ‘Ali’s ( May Allah be pleased 
with  him )  extraordinary  personal  perfections  together  with  the  internal 
struggles during his Caliphate, which resulted from the tragic events he was 
compelled to enter upon and were the object of suspicion and distrust, and 
the Sunnis saw that Abu Bakr’s or ‘Umar’s or ‘Uthman’s ( D h i ’ l - N u r a y n  ) 
pan weighed heavier, and so they gave them precedence.

Moreover,  as  is  proved  in  the  Twelth  and  Twenty-Fourth  Words, 
prophethood is so elevated in comparison to sainthood that a tiny manifesta-
tion of it is superior to a large manifestation of sainthood. In regard to this, 
the successes of the Supremely Veracious and the Supreme Distinguisher 
between  True  and  False  during  their  Caliphates  was  an  indication  for  the 
Sunnis that their share in the legacy of prophethood 2 and the establishment 
of its laws had been divinely bestowed. Since ‘Ali’s personal perfections did 
not dismiss that greater share, which had been inherited from the Prophet 
( UWBP ), he acted as Shaykh al-Islam for Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, the two 
Illustrious Elders, in the time of their Caliphates, and esteemed them. How 
should the Sunnis, who love and revere ‘Ali, not love and revere the two 
Elders, whom ‘Ali loved and revered sincerely? Let us make this truth clear 
by means of an example:

One of the sons of a very rich man is given twenty b a t m a n s   3 of silver 
and four b a t m a n s  of gold from his father’s legacy, and another is given five 
of silver and five of gold. So if the third is given three of silver and five of 
gold, of course the last two will receive less in quantity, but more in quality.

Like  this  example,  the  lesser  amount  of  the  two  elders’  share  of  the  gold 
of  the  truth  of  divine  immediacy,  which  was  manifested  in  the  legacy  of 
prophethood  and  the  establishment  of  its  laws,  would  weigh  heavier  than 
the great amount of divine proximity and the perfections of sainthood which 
sprang from personal perfections and the jewel of sainthood. These points 
should  also  be  taken  into  account  when  weighing  them  up.  1  But  if  they 
are compared with one another from the point of view of personal courage, 
knowledge, and sainthood, the matter takes on a different complexion.

Also, there can be no comparison in respect of the collective personal-
ity of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) family, which was represented in the person 
of ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ), and of the Muhammadan Truth, 
which was manifested as a total inheritance in that collective personality. 
For contained in it was the mighty mystery of the Prophet Muhammad him-
self ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ).

As for the Caliphate Shi‘a, they can claim no rights before the Sunnis 
other than shame. For although they say they have tremendous love for ‘Ali 
( May Allah be pleased with him ), they disparage him, and their creed neces-
sitates accusing him of immorality. For they say that although Abu Bakr the 
Veracious and ‘Umar were acting unjustly, ‘Ali feigned approval for them; 
according to Shi’i terminology, he dissimulated. That is, he was frightened 
of them and behaved hypocritically. 2 But it is not love to hold that someone 
who was such a hero of Islam, won the title Lion of Allah,  3 and was the 
commander and guide of the faithful, was simulating love for people he did 
not love out of fear and deception, and was feigning approval for them in 
fear for more than twenty years, and was following wrongdoers. ‘Ali ( May 
Allah be pleased with him ) would disclaim love that sort.

Thus, the people of truth’s creed in no way disparages ‘Ali, nor levels 
accusations of immorality at him. It does not attribute cowardice where there 
was such remarkable courage, but says that if ‘Ali had not considered the 
Rightly-Guided Caliphs to be right, he would not have recognized them for 
a minute, nor obeyed them. It means that since he thought them right and 
preferable, he made over his courage and striving to the way of justice. 4

I n    S h o r t : Too much or too little of anything is not good. Moderation is 
the  middle  way  1  and  has  been  chosen  by  the  Sunnis.  But,  alas,  Wahhabi 
and Kharijite ideas have infiltrated the Sunnis to an extent; so too addicts of 
politics and some atheists criticize ‘Ali. They say, Allah forbid, that he did 
not understand politics so was not entirely worthy of the Caliphate and could 
not govern, and because of these unjust accusations, ‘Alawis feel affronted 
at the Sunnis. Whereas Sunnis hold no principles or basic beliefs that neces-
sitate such ideas. Indeed, they prove the opposite. The Sunnis cannot be con-
demned because of ideas that come from Kharijites and atheists. Indeed, the 
Sunnis are firmer followers of ‘Ali than the ‘Alawis. They mention ‘Ali in 
the laudatory fashion he deserves in all their  k h u t b a s  and prayers. And the 
saints and purified scholars, the vast majority of whom belonged to the Sunni 
school, recognized him as a spiritual guide and the king of sainthood. 2 The 
‘Alawis should ignore the Kharijites and atheists who have deservedly earned 
the enmity of both the ‘Alawis and the Sunnis, and not take sides against the 
people of truth. Some ‘Alawis even abandon the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) S u n n a  
out of spite for the Sunnis. Anyway, we have said too much on this matter, 
for it has been discussed inordinately by the religious scholars.

O Sunnis, who are the people of truth, and ‘Alawis, whose way is love 
of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) family! Quickly put an end to this meaningless, 
disloyal, unjust, and harmful dispute between you. Otherwise the atheistic 
current which is now so influential will make one of you a tool against the 
other, and use the one to crush the other. And after defeating the one it will 
destroy the tool. As believers in divine unity, it is essential that you leave 
aside unimportant matters that cause division, for there are a hundred funda-
mental sacred bonds between you that enjoin brotherhood and unity.

* Note: Our Master, Hazret-i Ustad, said in explanation of these two phrases in the 
footnote of the Sixth Chapter of the Twenty-Ninth Flash, which is in Arabic: “ The degrees 
of these two phrases were written in Arabic because they are reflection and remembrance 
of Allah rather than intellectual knowledge.....  ” The Fourth Ray, called H a s b i y e   R i s a l e s i , 
about the verse ( 3:173 ) Ø × Ö Õ was written subsequently in Turkish.

A  treatise  was  to  be  written  that  would  explain  in  fifteen 

degrees a highly significant meaning of the verse, 

( 3:173 ) Ø × Ö Õ  but it has been postponed for 
now since it would have been concerned more with reflective 
thought and the recollection of Allah than with reality and intel-
lectual  knowledge.  In  fact,  the  important  treatise  called  The 
Stairway of the Practices of the Prophet and Antidote for the 
Sickness of Innovation was originally known as the Fifth Flash, 
but since it comprised eleven points, it was designated the Elev-
enth Flash, and the Fifth Flash’s place remained unoccupied.

teen or twenty degrees of reflective thought the important truth

which are about reality, rather than among them.

These three verses from Sura al-Fath contain many aspects of miracu-

À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ »  is  stating  that  although  the  Truce  of 
Hudaybiya  was  apparently  opposed  to  Islam’s  interests  and  the  Quraysh 
were victorious to an extent, in reality it was a great victory and the key to 
further conquests. For with the Truce the physical sword was temporarily 
hung up, but the flashing diamond sword of the Qur’an was unsheathed, and 
it conquered minds and hearts. As a result of it, the two sides mixed with 
one another. The virtues of Islam and lights of the Qur’an rent the veils of 
obduracy and tribalism and prevailed. For example, people like Khalid ibn 
al-Walid, a brilliant warrior, and ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, a brilliant politician, who 
could  not  accept  defeat,  were  defeated  by  the  Qur’anic  sword  manifested 
through the Truce of Hudaybiya.  1 They submitted in perfect obedience to 
Islam in Medina, and Khalid became a “ Sword of Allah; ” a sword in the 
conquests of Islam.

A n   I m p o r t a n t   Q u e s t i o n :   What  was  the  reason  the  Companions  of  the 
Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), the Glory of the 
World and Beloved of the Sustainer of All the Worlds, were defeated by the 
idolators at the end of Uhud and beginning of Hunayn? 2

The Answer: Among the idolators were many persons like Khalid who 
in the future would be equal to the leading Companions of that time. There-
fore, so as not to degrade them entirely in the view of the future, which for 
them would be glorious and honourable, divine wisdom gave them in the 
past immediate recompense for their future good works and did not com-
pletely destroy their pride. That is to say, the Companions of the past were 
defeated by the Companions of the future, so that the future Companions 
would enter Islam, not through fear of the flashing sword but through zeal 
for the flash of truth, and so that they and their natural valour should not be 
brought low.

THE SIXTH

The First

in two respects:

The phrase, @ ? > =  makes predictions concerning the Unseen 
T h e   F i r s t :  It cites these qualities of the Companions that are mentioned 
in the Torah, which for an unlettered person like the Prophet ( Upon whom 
be  blessings  and  peace )  belonged  to  the  World  of  the  Unseen.  Yes,  as 
described in the Nineteenth Letter, the Torah contains the following lines 
about the Companions of the Prophet who was to come at the end of time: 
“ The banners of the holy ones are together with them. ” 1 That is, his Com-
panions would be pious worshippers and righteous saints, so that they were 
described  as  “ the  holy  ones, ”  that  is,  “ sacred. ”  The  Torah  has  been  cor-
rupted  through  translation  into  numerous  languages,  yet  with  many  of  its 
verses it still corroborates the words of Sura al-Fath, @ ? >
T h e   S e c o n d   aspect  of  it  giving  news  of  the  Unseen  is  this:  with  this 
phrase it is predicting that the Companions and the generation that followed 
them would achieve such a degree of worship that the luminosity of their 
spirits would shine in their faces, and that marks would be apparent on their 
foreheads, like a stamp of sainthood, caused by their repeated prostrations. 
And indeed the future proved this brilliantly, with complete clarity and cer-
tainty.  Many  prominent  persons  caught  up  in  that  strange  dissension  and 
political  upheaval  demonstrated  the  mystery  of @ ? >  who  like 
Zayn al-‘Abidin day and night performed prayers of a thousand rakats, and

First Aspect

THE SEVENTH

L K J I H G F E D C B  
   Q P O N M 

The First is the prediction in the Gospel about the Companions, which 

for the unlettered Prophet ( UWBP ) belonged to the World of the Unseen.

Yes, the Gospels contain such verses as,  َكِ(cid:170)ٰذﯬﯦ ُهُ(cid:99)َ

ّ(cid:174)ُاَو  ٍد(cid:192) ِدَ(cid:110)  ْنِ(cid:174)  ٌب(cid:193) ِ(cid:139)َ(cid:162) ُهَ(cid:151)َ(cid:174) 
1  describing  the  Prophet  who  was  to  come  at  the  end  of  time.  That  is,  a 
Prophet would come who unlike Jesus ( UWP ) would wield the sword and 
be charged with waging j i h a d , as would his Companions. The one bearing 
“ the staff of iron ” would be the World’s Ruler. For in another place in the 
Gospels it says: “ I am going so that the Ruler of the World may come. ” 2 
That is to say, the World’s Ruler will come. It is thus understood from these 
two verses in the Gospels that at the outset the Companions would be few 
and  weak,  nevertheless  they  would  sprout  like  seeds,  grow,  thicken,  and 
find strength. Then when about to be overwhelmed and smothered by the 
rage this caused the unbelievers, they would subjugate mankind with their 
swords and prove that the Messenger ( UWBP ), their leader, was the Ruler 
of the World. These verses express exactly the meaning of the above verses 
of Sura al-Fath.

Second Aspect

Second  Aspect:  The  verses  predict  the  following:  due  to  their  weak-
ness  and  small  number  the  Companions  accepted  the  Pact  of  Hudaybiya, 
but within a short time they grew and acquired such strength and loftiness 
that, planted by the Hand of Power in the field of the face of the earth, they 
multiplied in most elevated, powerful, fruitful, and plentiful fashion. This 
was true in comparison with the shoots of mankind at that time, since these 
latter were short, weak, defective, and scant due to neglect and heedlessness. 
The Companions would grow strong causing illustrious governments to rage 
at them in envy, jealousy, and anger. The future verified this prediction in 
most brilliant fashion.

The  prediction  also  make  the  following  further  slight  hint:  it  indicates 
through  the  word  Z  that,  although  while  praising  the  Companions’ 
excellent qualities they should have been promised the greatest rewards, in 

1.  Nabhānī, Ḥ u j j a t   A l l ā h   ‘ a l ā ’ l - ‘ Ā l a m ī n , 99, 114.

SEVENTH FLASH

51

the future they would commit serious errors due to strife. For forgiveness 
indicates the existence of faults. At that time it would be forgiveness, the 
greatest bounty, that the Companions would want most; the highest reward 
would  be  absence  of  punishment,  thanks  to  forgiveness.  The  word Z 
both  makes  this  subtle  allusion,  and  it  is  connected  with  the  verse  at  the 
beginning of the Sura, ( 48:2 ) / . - , + * ) ( ' By giving 
the good news of forgiveness at the start of the Sura not for true sins, since 
the Messenger ( UWBP ) was exempt from sin and did not commit them, but 
for a meaning in keeping with the rank of prophethood, and by giving the 
good news of forgiveness for the Companions at the end of the sura, it adds 
a further subtlety to the allusion.

Of the ten aspects of miraculousness contained in the above-mentioned 
three  verses  at  the  end  of  Sura  al-Fath,  we  have  discussed  here  only  the 
aspect concerning predictions about the Unseen, and of the numerous parts 
of that aspect, only seven. A flash of miraculousness in the positioning of 
the letters of the last verse is alluded to at the end of the Twenty-Sixth Word, 
which is about divine determining and man’s faculty of will. This last verse 
looks to the Companions both with its sentences, and to their situations with 
its phrases, and it describes their attributes with its words  1 and letters; so 
too with its letters and the repetition of the number of letters it alludes to 
classes of such famous Companions as those of Badr, of Uhud, of Hunayn, 
of the Bench, and of Ridwan. Moreover, it expresses many further mysteries 
through ‘coincidences’ and a b j a d  reckoning, which are branches of the sci-
ence of j a f r  and keys to it.

 X W V U T S R Q P O 
( 4:68-69 ) [ Z Y
We shall point out two of the thousands of fine points expounding these 

verses.

First Point

FIRST POINT

Just  as  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  expresses  truths  through 
its explicit, clear meanings and senses, so it expresses many allusive mean-
ings through its styles and manner of exposition. Each of its verses contains 
numerous  levels  of  meanings.  The  Qur’an  proceeds  from  all-encompass-
ing knowledge, so all its meanings may be intended. Its meanings are not 
restricted to one or two like man’s speech, the product of his limited mind 
and individual will.

In  consequence  of  this,  innumerable  truths  contained  in  the  Qur’an’s 
verses have been expounded by Qur’anic commentators, and there are many 
more that have not been expounded by them. In addition to its explicit mean-
ings, much significant knowledge is contained in its letters in particular and 
in its allusions.

Second Point

SECOND POINT
With the terms, 

[ Z Y X W V U T S  the  verse 
describes  the  people  of  the  Straight  Path  and  the  groups  of  the  Prophets, 
the  caravan  of  the  Veracious,  the  community  of  the  Martyrs,  the  class  of 
the Righteous, and those who follow them. These are the members of man-
kind who truly receive the divine bounties. Furthermore, having indicated 

SEVENTH FLASH

53

explicitly  the  most  perfect  of  those  five  groups  in  the  world  of  Islam,  it 
indicates their leaders and chiefs by mentioning their well-known attributes. 
In  addition,  with  a  flash  of  miraculousness  giving  news  of  the  Unseen,  it 
specifies one aspect those chiefs’ positions in the future.

Yes, T S  looks explicitly to the Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ), and the phrase U looks to Abu Bakr the Vera-
cious. It also indicates that he would be second after the Messenger ( Upon 
whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  and  first  to  succeed  him,  and  be  known 
among the Umma by the special title of Veracious and be seen at the head of 
all honest and upright people. Then V refers to ‘Umar, ‘Uthman, and 
‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with all of them ) together. It intimates that the 
three of them would succeed to the Caliphate after the Veracious One, and 
that the three of them would be martyred and the merits of martyrdom added 
to their other virtues.

W  alludes  to  distinguished  persons  like  the  Companions  of  the 

Bench, and of Badr and Ridwan. While with its explicit meaning, 
[ Z Y encourages others to follow them, and with its implicit 
meaning,  by  showing  that  with  its  adherence  the  generation  that  suc-
ceeded them was honoured and illustrious, it alludes to Hasan ( May Allah 
be pleased with him ), who as the fifth Caliph affirmed the Hadith “ After 
me the Caliphate will last thirty years ” 1 – in order to show its great value 
despite its brief duration.

I n    S h o r t : Similarly to the verses at the end of Sura al-Fath, which look 
to  the  four  Rightly-Guided  Caliphs,  affirming  them,  these  verses  look  in 
part and allusively to their future positions in a way that gives news of the 
Unseen. Flashes of this sort of miraculousness, the disclosing of facts about 
the Unseen, which is one sort of the Qur’an’s miraculousness, are so numer-
ous as to be incalculable. Literalist scholars limit them to forty or fifty verses 
because  of  their  superficial  view,  but  in  reality  they  number  more  than  a 
thousand. Sometimes a single verse has four or five aspects giving news of 
the Unseen.

In addition to corroborating the predictions about the Unseen at the end 

of Sura al-Fath, the verse,

( 4:69 ) [ Z Y
elucidates what is meant by the people of the Straight Path and the verse 
( 1:7 )  > = < ;  and  describes  the  luminous,  large,  familiar, 
attractive caravan travelling the lengthy road leading to eternity. It vigor-
ously urges the believers and the intelligent to join, follow, and accompany 
it. In addition to its explicit meaning, like the verses at the end of Sura al-
Fath, this verse indicates through allusive and figurative meanings – called 
in rhetoric m a ‘ ā r ī ḍ  a l - k a l ā m 2 and m u s t a t b a ‘ ā t  a l - t a r ā k ī b  3 – the four Rightly-
Guided Caliphs and Hasan ( May Allah be pleased with him ), the fifth Cal-
iph. It gives news of the Unseen in several respects, as follows:

Just as the above verse states through its explicit meaning that the car-
avan  of  the  Prophets,  the  group  of  the  Veracious,  the  community  of  the 
Martyrs and Witnesses, the category of the Righteous, and the class of the 
generation following the Companions are the people of the Straight Path and 
those  among  mankind  who  receive  elevated  divine  bounties,  and  are  ‘the 
doers of good;’ so too it indicates in a manner predicting the Unseen that 
the best and most excellent of those groups are found in the World of Islam, 
like this: it points to the heirs of the Prophets who follow on in succession 
through the mystery of the legacy of the Messenger of the End of Time’s 
( UWBP ) prophethood, and to the caravan of the Veracious who follow on 
from the source of veracity of the Strictly Veracious One, and to the convoy 
of the Martyrs, who are bound through the rank of martyrdom to three of

and to the categories of the generation following the Companions, who rep-
resented the mystery of ( 3:31 ) E D C B A @ ? > and were 
in the company of the Companions and the Rightly-Guided Caliphs. So too, 
through its allusive meaning, it gives news through the epithet U 
that  Abu  Bakr  the  Veracious  would  succeed  to  the  Noble  Messenger’s 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) position after him, and would be Cal-
iph, famous among the Muslim community with the title Strictly Veracious, 
and be the chief of the caravan of “ t h e   Ve r a c i o u s . ” With the phrase V 
it foretells the martyrdom of three of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, and that 
after  the  Veracious  there  would  three  martyr  Caliphs.  Because  “ Martyrs 
ءآ
َدَ(cid:183) ُ(cid:130)  ” is plural and the lowest number [ in Arabic grammar ] of the plural 
is three. That means, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman, and ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with 
them ) would lead Islam after the Veracious One and would suffer martyr-
dom. And it occurred exactly as predicted.

Also, it is giving news through the phrase W that people like the 
People of the Bench who performed good works, acts of worship, and feared 
Allah, and are commended in the Torah, would be numerous in the future. 
While the phrase [ Z Y praises the generation that followed

addition to showing that to accompany those four groups on the road to eter-

THE FLASHES

There  are  many  further  mysteries  like  these  allusive  predictions,  but 
since they are outside our purpose, that door has not been answered for now. 
Numerous verses of the All-Wise Qur’an give news of the Unseen in many 
respects.  This  sort  of  the  Qur’an’s  predictions  about  the  Unseen  number 
thousands.

Conclusion 
A  miraculous,  subtle  point  of  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  that  is  manifested 

through ‘coincidences’ 1 is as follows:

ّر(cid:170)ا ِ

ِم(cid:193) ِ(cid:110)َ

the value of 

ّر(cid:170)ا  ِن ٰ(cid:175)ْ(cid:110)َ

In the All-Wise Qur’an, the divine names of Allah, Merciful ( R a ḥ m ā n  ), 
Compassionate ( R a ḥ ī m  ), Sustainer ( R a b b  ), and He ( H ū  ) in place of Allah, 
are mentioned approximately four thousand times in all. The second type 
of  a b j a d ,  reckoned  according  to  the  arrangement  of  the  alphabet,  makes 
ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) around four thousand also. Small frac-
tions of large numbers do not spoil ‘coincidence’, so have been disregarded. 
Also, together with the two conjunctival w a w ’s within  ٓمٓ(cid:170)ا it makes approx-
imately  two  hundred  and  eighty.  In  addition  to  coinciding  with  both  the 
approximately two hundred and eighty instances of the word Allah in Sura 
al-Baqara,  and  the  around  two  hundred  and  eighty  verses  of  the  Sura,  if 
reckoned with the second sort of abjad reckoning, it again makes about four 
thousand. That coincides both with the five famous divine names mentioned 
above,  and  if  the  fractions  are  disregarded,  with  the  numerical  value  of 
ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92)  That  is  to  say,  according  to  this  mystery  of  ‘coin-
ِم(cid:193) ِ(cid:110)َ
cidence,’  ٓمٓ(cid:170)ا  is  both  a  title  denoting  the  One  it  signifies,  and  a  name 
for  al-Baqara,  and  a  name  of  the  Qur’an,  and  a  concise  index  of  both 
of  them,  and  a  sample,  summary  and  seed  of  both,  and  a  summary  of 
ِم(cid:193) ِ(cid:110)َ

ّر(cid:170)ا  ِن ٰ(cid:175)ْ(cid:110)َ
According  to  the  well-known  a b j a d   system, 

ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92)  is 
equal in numerical value to the name of Sustainer. Similarly, if the doubled 
R ā  in ِم(cid:193) ِ(cid:110)َ
ّر(cid:170)ا is counted twice, it becomes nine hundred and ninety 
and a key to numerous important mysteries – with its nineteen letters, the 
key to nineteen thousand worlds.

ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) 

ّر(cid:170)ا  ِن ٰ(cid:175)ْ(cid:110)َ

Among  the  subtle  ‘coincidences’  of  the  word  Allah  in  the  Qur’an  of 
Miraculous Exposition is that in the whole Qur’an eighty instances of the 
word at the beginning of the bottom line of pages correspond to each other 
in  patterns.  So  too  do  eighty  instances  of  the  name  at  the  end  of  the  bot-
tom line look to each other in the same way. And again fifty-five instances 
of the word Allah right in the centre of the bottom line fall one on top of 
the other, uniting as though to make a single instance of the name. At the 
start of the last line a single and sometimes three-letter word numbers, with 
gaps, twenty-five, thus when added to the coinciding fifty-five at the middle 
of the lines, makes a ‘coincidence’ of eighty; this makes a coincidence of 
eighty both at the beginning of the line and at the end. Could such a subtle, 
fine, orderly, symmetrical, miraculous ‘coincidence’ be without wisdom or 
subtlety? Allah forbid, such a thing could not be! Most certainly, significant 
treasuries could be opened up with the tip of these coincidences.

My Dear, Loyal, Sincere, Conscientious Brother!
The reason I did not write a separate letter to our brother Abdülmecid, 
1  was  that  I  considered  the  letters  I  had  written  to  you  to  be  sufficient. 
After  Hulûsî,  2  Abdülmecid  is  a  valuable  brother  for  me  and  a  student. 
Every morning and evening he is present in name in my prayers together 
with  Hulûsî,  sometimes  being  mentioned  first.  First  Sabri,  3  then  Hakkı 
Efendi  4 profit from the letters I write you. I do not write them separate 
letters either. Almighty Allah made you a blessed elder brother to them. 
Correspond with Abdülmecid in my place; he should not worry, for after 
Hulûsî, I think of him.

YOUR FIRST QUESTION

You ask a confidential question about one of your forebears signing him-
self, “ al-Sayyid Muhammad. ” My brother, it isn’t possible for me to give a 
scholarly answer to this or an intuitive one or to research into it. However, 
I  told  my  companions:  “ Hulûsi  resembles  neither  the  present-day  Turks, 

1.  Abdülmecid ( ‘Abd al-Majīd ) was Bediuzzaman’s younger brother. He was a teach-
er  of  the  religious  sciences,  then  a  Mufti,  and  translated  parts  of  the  Risale-i  Nur  into 
Arabic, and  I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z  and  M e s n e v i - i   N u r i y e  from Arabic into Turkish. He died in 
1967. [ Tr. ]

2.  Hulûsi Yahyagil was one of the first students of the Risale-i Nur, and was from 
Elazığ in eastern Turkey. When serving as a captain in the army in 1929 he visited Bediuz-
zaman, and in Bediuzzaman’s words, “ his zeal and seriousness were the most important 
reason for the last of the Wo r d s  ( S ö z l e r  ) and L e t t e r s  ( M e k t û b a t  ) being written. ” [ Tr. ]

3.  Sabri Arseven. Known as Santral Sabri, he was one of Bediuzzaman’s most impor-
tant students in Barla and was also imam of the neighbouring village of Bedre. He died in 
1954. [ Tr. ]

4.  Hakkı Tığlı. He was from Eğridir and was imprisoned together with Bediuzzaman 

in Eskişehir in 1935. He also acted as Bediuzzaman’s lawyer. [ Tr. ]

observed in Hulûsi is a divine gift. Also, as you know, Allah’s Noble Mes-
senger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) has two families. One consists 
of his descendants, and the other is the family of his prophethood’s lumi-
nous collective personality. You certainly belong to the latter, and I am of 
the opinion, though unsubstantiated, that in respect of his first family, your 
forefather’s signature was not without reason.

My Dear Brother!

A SUMMARY OF YOUR SECOND QUESTION

Muhyiddin  al-‘Arabi  1  said:  “ The  spirit’s  createdness  consists  of  its 
unfolding. ” With this question you are compelling a powerless wretch like 
me  to  contest  an  awesomely  brilliant  scholar  of  reality  and  genius  of  the 
occult sciences like Muhyiddin al-‘Arabi. However, relying on the teachings 
of the Qur’an I can attempt the discussion; even if I am only a fly, I can fly 
higher than that eagle.

My brother! You should understand that Muhyiddin would not deceive, 
but he could be deceived. He was rightly-guided, but could not act as a guide 
in all his works. What he saw was correct, but it was not reality. The real-
ity of man’s spirit, about which you ask, is explained in the Twenty-Ninth 
Word, the discussion about the spirit.

Yes,  in  respect  of  its  nature,  the  spirit  is  a  law  proceeding  from  the 
divine command, but it is a living law clothed in external existence and 
possessing external existence. Muhyiddin thought of it only from the point 
of view of its essential nature. His way of the Unity of Existence consid-
ers the existence of things to be imaginary. He had wondrous visions and 
unveiled the realities, but since his was a prominent way and he chose an 
independent path, he was compelled to apply, artificially and with forced 
interpretations, certain Qur’anic verses to his way and observations, thus 
marring  the  clarity  of  the  verses.  In  others  of  his  treatises  he  expounds 
the straight highway of the Qur’an and of the Sunnis. He was a holy man 
who held a position all his own, and he was one of the well-accepted, but 
he exceeded the mark in his unbalanced disclosures and in many matters 
opposed the majority of the learned authorities.

1.  Muḥyī al-Dīn ibn al-‘Arabī, an eminent scholar and thinker who profoundly in-
fluenced  the  development  of  Sufism.  He  was  born  in Andalusia  in  560AH  and  died  in 
Damascus in 638AH. Among his best known works are F u ṣ ū ṣ   a l - Ḥ i k a m  and a l - F u t ū ḥ ā t

THE FLASHES

It is because of this that although he was such an elevated and wondrous 
spiritual pole, unequalled down the ages, it is as though his particular way 
was very short and restricted to Sadruddin al-Qunawi. 1 His works are only 
rarely benefited from by those on the straight path. Many of the authoritive 
scholars do not encourage study of those valuable works and some of them 
even prevent it. 

Lengthy study and a very lofty, broad view is needed to show the fun-
damental differences together with their sources between Muhyiddin’s way 
and that of the exacting scholars. Yes, the differences are so fine and pro-
found  and  the  sources,  so  elevated  and  extensive  that  Muhyiddin  has  not 
been censured and has continued to be accepted. For if in regard to thought, 
scholarship, and illumination the difference and sources had become appar-
ent, it would have been very humiliating for him, and he would have been 
seen to be in serious error. Since the difference is so profound, we shall try to 
show it and the sources briefly by means of a comparison, and Muhyiddin’s 
errors in the matter.

For example, the sun appears in a mirror. The mirror both contains the 
sun and is qualified by it. That is to say, in one respect the sun is present 
in the mirror, and in another it adorns the mirror, becoming a brilliant col-
our,  attribute  and  quality  of  it.  If  the  mirror  had  been  a  camera,  it  would 
have fixed the sun’s image on photographic paper. In these cases, the sun in 
the mirror, and its semblance on the photographic paper, and its aspect that 
adorns the mirror and becomes like a quality of the mirror, are other than the 
actual sun. They are not the sun, but the sun’s manifestation which has taken 
on another existence. As for the existence of the sun that is visible in the 
mirror, even if it is not identical with the sun that is visible outside, since it 
is tied to it and points to it, it has been supposed to have the same existence.
In consequence of this, it may be said: “ There is nothing apart from the 
actual sun in the mirror, ” meaning that the mirror contains it and intend-
ing the sun’s external existence in the mirror. But if it is said that the sun’s 
extended reflection, which has become like an attribute or quality of the 
mirror, and its image which has been transposed to the photographic paper 
is the sun, it is wrong; it is an error to say: “ There is nothing in them other 
than the sun. ” For there is the reflection on the mirror’s shining face and 
the  image  formed  on  its  back,  and  these  have  their  own  separate  exist-
ences. For sure those existences are from the sun’s manifestation, but they

ber of works on Sufism, among which is a l - N u ṣ ū ṣ   f ī   Ta ḥ q ī q   a l - Ṭ a w r   a l - M a k h ṣ ū ṣ .

are not the sun. The human mind and imagination resemble this example 
of the mirror, as follows:

The  information  in  the  mirror  of  man’s  thought  also  has  two  faces:  in 
one respect it is knowledge, in another, it is known. If we suppose the mind 
to contain what is known, then the known thing becomes something known 
by the mind; its existence is something different to the mind. If we suppose 
the mind to be qualified by the thing occurring, it becomes an attribute or 
quality of the mind; then the thing becomes knowledge and has an external 
existence. Even if the existence of the thing known is essential ( j a w h a r ī  ), it 
has an accidental external existence like the knowledge.

Thus, according to these two comparisons, the universe is a mirror. The 
true nature of beings is also mirror-like; they are subject to divine creation 
through pre-eternal power. In one respect, each being is a sort of mirror to 
one of the names of the Pre-Eternal Sun, displaying its embroideries. The 
followers of Muhyiddin’s way unveiled them only in respect of being mir-
rors and containers, revealing the similitude of their existence in the mirror, 
from  the  point  of  view  of  denial.  Supposing  the  reflection  to  be  identical 
with the thing reflected, they did not think of other levels. They said: “ There 
is no existent but He, ” and were in error. They almost went as far as denying 
the fundamental rule: “ The real essences of things exist in reality. ” 

As for the people of reality, they have seen through the mystery of the 
legacy  of  prophethood  and  the  definite  statements  of  the  Qur’an  that  the 
embroideries and inscriptions that come into being in the mirrors of things 
through divine power and will are His works. They are “ all from Him; ” they 
are not “ all Him. ” 1 Things have an existence and their existence is constant 
to  a  degree.  For  sure  it  is  weak  compared  to  that  of  the  Necessary  Exist-
ence, like an illusion or imagining, but through the Pre-Eternal All-Powerful 
One’s creation, will, and power, it exists.

In  the  comparison,  the  sun  in  the  mirror  has  an  existence  through  its 
similitude  apart  from  its  external  existence.  And  its  expanded  reflection 
also,  which  gives  colour  to  and  adorns  the  mirror,  has  an  accidental  and 
separate external existence. And the sun’s image which is depicted on the 
photographic paper on the back of the mirror also has a separate and acci-
dental external existence. 

Similarly, the inscriptions of beings, which appear through the manifesta-
tions of the sacred divine names – occurring through will, choice, and power – 

1.  That is, everything is from Him; He creates everything. Not everything is Him so 

that it may be said “ There is no existent save Him. ”

62

THE FLASHES

in  the  mirror  of  the  universe  and  mirrors  of  the  quintessential  natures  of 
things,  have  a  created  existence  separate  from  the  Necessary  Existence. 
And this existence has been given a permanence through pre-eternal power. 
But if the connection were to be severed, all things would at once cease to 
be. Because for their continued existence, all things are every instant in need 
of their Creator’s preserving them. “ The real essences of things exist in real-
ity,” but but have a constant existence only through His making it so.

Thus, Muhyiddin’s saying: “ Spirit is not created; it is a reality proceed-
ing from the world of the divine command and from the attribute of will, ” is 
contrary to many clear statements of the Qur’an and Hadiths, and according 
to the investigation above, he was confused, deceived, and had not seen the 
weak existences of things.

The places of manifestation of such divine names as Creator and Provider 
cannot be illusory or imaginary. Since the names have a reality, their places 
of manifestation also have an external reality.

YOUR THIRD QUESTION

You want instruction in the science of j a f r  that will be a key to it.
T h e   A n s w e r :  We are not carrying out this work and service at our own 
wish and through our own planning. A better will than ours governs it, over 
and  above  our  wills.  The  science  of  j a f r   is  an  absorbing  and  pleasurable 
occupation, but it busies us and detains us from our true duties. It has often 
happened that some of the Qur’an’s mysteries have been revealed through 
it as though it were a key, but on addressing myself to them with real enthu-
siasm and enjoyment, they eluded me. I have discovered two instances of 
wisdom in this: 

The  First:  It  may  be  discourteous  towards  the  prohibition  of  “ None 

knows the Unseen save Allah. ”

The  Second:  Teaching  the  Islamic  community  about  the  fundamental 
truths of belief and the certain proofs of the Qur’an is a sacred service far 
exceeding in value and merit such occult sciences as  j a f r . Their firm evi-
dences  and  categorical  proofs  allow  no  opportunity  for  exploitation,  but 
occult sciences like  j a f r  are not bound by any firm rules, and are open to 
abuse and exploitation by charlatans. In any event, a little is bestowed when-
ever the need arises in this service of reality.

Among the keys of  j a f r , the easiest, and perhaps the purest and finest, 
are the various sorts of ‘coincidences.’ These proceed from the divine name 
of Originator ( B a d ī ‘  ) and have been manifested in the name of Allah in the 

NINTH FLASH

63

Qur’an and adorn the works we have published. They have been pointed out 
to an extent in several places in the work K e r â m e t - i   G a v s i y e  ( T h e   Wo n d e r s  
o f   a l - G a w t h   a l - A ‘ z a m  ). For instance, the coincidences showing something 
in several aspects constitutes a sign that has the strength of a proof. Some-
times with a number of deductions, a single coincidence may form a proof. 
However, this is enough for now. If there is serious need, it will be made 
known to you.

YOUR FOURTH QUESTION

That  is,  not  your  question  but  Imam  Ömer  Efendi’s,  about  a  wretched 
doctor saying that Jesus ( UWP ) had a father. 1 With a lunatic interpretation, 
the doctor tried to show that a Qur’anic verse justifies his saying this.

At one time, the unfortunate man was trying to create something with the 
Disjointed Letters. He was working at it feverishly. Then I understood that 
he had perceived from the atheists’ attitude that they were going to attempt 
to abolish the Islamic script. He was struggling pointlessly as though to save 
the script in the face of that flood. Now in this matter, and in the Second 
Matter, he saw the atheists’ terrible attacks on the fundamentals of Islam, 
and I reckon he wanted to find a way of compromising through meaningless 
interpretations like that. Since definite verses like, 

( 3:59 ) | { z y x w v
state that Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ) had no father, no importance should 
be given to what those who attempt to change such certain, veritable facts 
say with their idiotic, forced interpretations. For they suppose it impossible 
that the law of human reproduction be broken. But there is no law that has 
no exceptions and to which individuals have not been subject. And there is 
no universal rule that has not been breached by extraordinary individuals.

Since the time of Adam there has been no law to which there have been 
no individual exceptions. Firstly, the law of reproduction was violated in 

1.  The extraordinary achievements of an extraordinary human being who is the leader 
of a quarter of mankind, transformed in a way from the human state to that of the angels, 
and left this world to make the heavens his dwelling – these extraordinary achievements 
demand an extraordinary form of the law of reproduction. For him to have been subject 
to that law in a dubious, unknown, unnatural, and even base way would have been inap-
propriate for him; anyway there was no need for him to have been. Moreover, the Qur’an’s 
explicit  statements  do  not  bear  interpretation.  How  can  the  law  of  the  angels’  sexuality, 
which is outside reproduction and in no way can be broken for the sake of repairing the law 
of human reproduction, which has been broken in a hundred ways – how can this law – to-
gether with such powerful laws as the law of the explicit verses of the Qur’an be violated?

THE FLASHES

regard to origins by the origins of the two hundred thousand animal spe-
cies, and brought to an end. That is, the two hundred thousand progenitors 
of the species, quite simply like Adam’s, violated the law of reproduction. 
They were not born of a father and mother and were given existence out-
side the law.

Furthermore, the greater part – innumerable individuals – of the hun-
dred thousand species we see with our eyes every spring are created out-
side that law, on the surface of leaves and on putrified matter. So you can 
see just how unreasonable someone is who cannot accept with his reason 
the exception of a single individual in one thousand nine hundred years to 
a law that was violated and breached at its origin and has been breached 
every year even, and clings to forced interpretations of the definite state-
ments of the Qur’an.

The things those wretches call natural laws are the laws called â d â t u l l a h  
or divine practices, which are a universal manifestation of the divine com-
mand  and  dominical  will,  and  which  Almighty  Allah  changes  for  certain 
instances of wisdom. He shows that His will and choice govern in every-
thing and in every law. Certain extraordinary individuals breach those prac-
tices. This truth He points out with His decree,

Ömer Efendi’s Second Question concerning the doctor:
The doctor behaves extremely foolishly in this matter, so that to listen to 
what he says or give it importance is very demeaning. The unfortunate wants 
to be half way between belief and unbelief. I say the following, in reply not 
to his trifling words, but to Ömer Efendi’s questioning:

The  reason  for  the  injunctions  and  prohibitions  of  the  Shari‘a  are  the 
divine command and divine prohibition. Advantages and instances of wis-
dom are to give them weight, and may be the reason for the command or 
prohibition from the point of view of the divine name of All-Wise.

For example, someone making a journey shortens the five daily prayers. 
There is a reason for ( i l l e t  ) and a purpose or instance of wisdom in ( h i k -

difficulty involved. If on a journey and there is no difficulty involved, the 
prayers are still shortened. If not on a journey, and the person suffers a hun-
dred difficulties in his own house, he may not shorten the prayers. For the 
difficulty occurring on some journeys is sufficient as the purpose for short-
ening the prayers, and is again sufficient for making the journey the reason.

Thus, in accordance with this rule of the Shari‘a, the Shari‘a’s injunc-
tions do not change due to purposes or instances of wisdom; they look to 
the  true  reasons.  Apart  from  the  harm  and  illness  caused  by  pork,  as  the 
doctor said, according to the saying, “ The person who eats pork becomes 
piggish in some ways; ” 1 the pig is not harmless like other domestic animals. 
Its meat causes considerable harm rather than being beneficial. And it has 
been  established  medically  that  its  powerful  fat  is  harmful  in  lands  other 
than Europe, which are powerfully cold, and is thus in fact and in meaning 
extremely harmful.

Instances of wisdom such as these are purposes for the divine prohibi-
tion and for its being forbidden. The wisdom does not have to be present in 
every instance and all the time. The reason does not change with the purpose 
and  wisdom  changing.  If  the  reason  does  not  change,  the  injunction  does 
not change. From this rule it may be seen just how far from the spirit of the 
Shari‘a the unfortunate man was when he spoke. No importance should be 
given to what he said regarding the Shari‘a. The Creator has many animals 
in the form of unreasoning philosophers!

1.  I wonder, does the fact that despite all the wondrous progress and civilization of 
Europe and its advances in science and knowledge beneficial for humanity, its people eat 
pork, not play some part in their becoming piggishly stuck in the darkness of materialism 
and  naturalism,  which  are  entirely  the  reverse  of  that  progress,  knowledge,  and  attain-
ment? I ask you. Evidence that man’s temperament is affected by the food he eats is the 
saying: “ The person who eats meat every day for forty days will suffer anxiety and sorrow 
in his heart, ” which has become proverbial.

An Addendum to the Answer to Your Question 
about Muhyiddin al-‘Arabi
Q u e s t i o n :  Muhyiddin al-‘Arabi considered the Unity of Existence to be 
of the highest level. Likewise, some of the great saints who took the path 
of love followed him. However, you say that this matter is not of the high-
est level and is not real; that it is rather the way, to a degree, of those who 
become intoxicated and immersed in the divine, and of the people of love 
and ecstasy. So what, briefly, is the high level of the affirmation of divine 
unity pointed out by the clear verses of the Qur’an, through the mystery of 
the legacy of prophethood? Can you explain it?

The Answer: It is a hundred times beyond the ability of an utterly power-
less unfortunate like myself to judge those elevated stations with his limited 
thought. I shall just explain one or two extremely brief points proceeding 
from the effulgence of the All-Wise Qur’an. Perhaps they will be useful in 
understanding the matter.

FIRST POINT

There are numerous reasons for becoming embroiled in the way of the 

Unity of Existence. One or two of them may be described as follows:

The First Reason: Because they could not squeeze into their brains the 
maximum degree of the creativity of dominicality, nor entirely establish in 
their hearts the idea that everything, through the mystery of divine oneness, 
is held directly in the grasp of dominicality and that all things have exist-
ence through divine power, choice, and will, those who took that way were 
obliged to say that everything is either Him, or does not have existence, or is 
imaginary, or is His manifestation or emanation.

The Second Reason: The mark of passionate love is to want never to 
be separated from the beloved and to flee desperately from such separa-
tion; to tremble at the thought of parting, to fear distance from the beloved 
as though fearing Hell, and to abominate transience; to love union with the 
love of one’s own spirit and life, and to yearn to be near to the beloved 
as though longing for Paradise. Thus, through adhering to a manifestation 
of  divine  immediacy  in  all  things,  those  who  took  the  way  of  the  Unity 
of  Existence  disregarded  separation  and  distance;  supposing  union  and 

NINTH FLASH

67

meeting to be permanent, they said: “ There is no existent but He; ” through 
the intoxication of love and as demanded by the ecstasy of permanence, 
meeting,  and  union,  they  imagined  that  in  the  Unity  of  Existence  was  a 
most pleasurable way of illumination whereby they could be saved from 
the dreadfulness of separation and made it their refuge. 

That is to say, the first reason sprang from the fact that the hand of their 
intellects was unable to reach up to some of the truths of belief, which were 
extremely broad and elevated; they were unable to comprehend them, and 
had not developed completely in regard to belief. While the source of the 
second reason was the extraordinary unfolding of their hearts from the point 
of view of love, and their wondrous expansion and breadth.

However,  the  supreme  level  of  divine  unity,  which  the  Purified  Ones 
– who were the people of sobriety and great saints of the legacy of prophet-
hood – saw through the explicit expositions of the Qur’an is both extremely 
elevated, and shows both the maximum level of dominicality and creativity 
and that all the divine names are real. It preserves the Qur’an’s principles 
and does not spoil the balance of the decrees of dominicality. For they say 
that together with the oneness of His essence and His being free of space, 
with His knowledge Almighty Allah encompasses and determines directly 
all things together with all their attributes, and through His will He chooses 
and specifies them, and through His power He creates them and gives them 
existence.  He  creates  and  directs  the  whole  universe  as  though  it  were  a 
single being.

He creates the huge spring with the ease of creating a flower. Nothing 
obstructs anything else. There is no fragmentation in His regarding things. 
He  is  present  everywhere  at  the  same  instant  through  the  disposal  of  His 
knowledge and power. There is no division or distribution in His disposal. 
This  mystery  has  been  expounded  and  proved  decisively  in  the  Sixteenth 
Word and in the Second Aim of the Second Stopping-Place of the Thirty-
Second  Word.  Since,  according  to  the  rule,  “ Comparisons  are  incontesti-
ble, ” no attention should be paid to defects in comparisons and allegories, 
I shall set forth a very faulty comparison so that the difference between the 
two ways may be understood to a degree.

For example, let us imagine a huge, matchless, and wondrously adorned 
peacock which can fly from east to west in an instant, and opens and closes 
its wings, which stretch from north to south, are adorned with hundreds of 
thousands of fine patterns, and in every single feather of which are included 

68

THE FLASHES

brilliant  arts.  Now,  there  are  two  men  observing  it;  they  want  to  fly  with 
the wings of the intellect and heart up to the elevated qualities of this bird, 
to its wondrous decorations. One looks at the peacock’s condition and form 
and the marvellous inscriptions of power on all its feathers; he loves it with 
extreme  passion  and  ardour;  he  in  part  abandons  his  attentive  reflective 
thought, and clings to love. But then he sees that every day those lovable 
decorations change and are transformed. Those objects of his love, which he 
worships, disappear and are lost.

While he should have said that through true divine unity, which he could 
not encompass with his mind, and absolute dominicality and the oneness of 
the divine essence, they were the artistic decorations of an Inscriber possess-
ing universal creativity, he said instead – in order to console himself – that 
the  spirit  of  the  peacock  was  so  sublime  that  its  maker  was  within  it,  or 
that the peacock had become him, and that since its spirit had become one 
with its being, and its being had combined with its outward appearance, its 
spirit’s perfection and being’s exaltedness displayed those manifestations, 
displaying every moment a different inscription and beauty; it was not a true 
creation through its will, but rather a manifestation, an emanation.

As for the other man, he said that those harmonious, orderly decorations 
so full of art definitely required will, choice, intention, and purpose. It was 
impossible for there to be a manifestation without will, an emanation with-
out choice.

Yes,  the  peacock  had  a  beautiful  and  elevated  nature,  but  it  could  not 
be the doer; it was passive. It could not become one with the active agent. 
Its spirit was fine and exalted, but it could not be the creator and disposer, 
only receptive and a means. For observedly in each of its feathers was an 
art performed with infinite wisdom and an inscription and decoration made 
through  an  infinite  power.  And  these  could  not  occur  without  will  and 
choice. The arts indicating perfect wisdom within perfect power, and perfect 
dominicality and mercy within perfect wisdom were not the work of some 
sort of manifestation. The scribe who had written that gilded notebook could 
not be inside it and be united with it. The notebook rather only had contact 
with the nib of the scribe’s pen. In which case, the wondrous decorations of 
the similitude of the peacock known as the universe were a gilded missive 
of the peacock’s Creator.

Now, look at the peacock and read the missive. Say to its Scribe: “ What 
wonders Allah has willed! Blessed be Allah! Glory be to Allah! ” The per-
son who supposes the missive to be the scribe, or the scribe to be inside the 

NINTH FLASH

69

letter, or fancies the missive to be imagination, has surely mislaid his reason 
in the veils of love, and been unable to see the true form of reality.

Among the varieties of passionate love, the one most giving rise to the 
way of the Unity of Existence, is love of this world. When it turns into true 
love, love of this world, which is temporary, is transformed into the Unity 
of Existence. A person loves a personal beloved with worldly love. Then, 
unable to accept in his heart his beloved’s transience and ephemerality, he 
consoles himself by saying that his beloved is a mirror reflecting the beauty 
of the True Object of Love and Worship, and attaches himself to a reality, so 
acquiring permanence for him through true love.

In the same way, when due to the constant blows of death and separation 
the strange love of the person who takes the huge world and the universe 
in its totality as his beloved is transformed into true love, he seeks refuge 
in the way of the Unity of Existence in order to save that great beloved of 
his from death and separation. If he has extremely powerful and elevated 
belief, it becomes a pleasurable, luminous, acceptable level, as with those 
resembling Muhyi’d-Din al-‘Arabi. However, it is possible he may fall into 
various abysses, embrace materiality, and become submerged in causes. As 
for the Unity of Witnessing, it is harmless; it is an exalted way of the people 
of sobriety.

One  meaning  of  the  above  verse  is  to  be  expounded  and  explained  by 
the blows dealt by divine compassion that my comrades in the service of 
the Qur’an receive for mistakes they make as the result of human nature. 
So a succession of extra-ordinary events proceeding from the service of the 
Qur’an will be explained together with an instance of  G a w t h   a l - A ‘ z a m ’s   1 
wonderworking,  since  he  supervises  this  sacred  service  with  Allah’s  per-
mission and assists it with his saintly inﬂuence and prayers. Then those who 
perform it may persevere earnestly in their service.

There are three sorts of wonderworking associated with this sacred work:
The First Sort is that aspect which prepares the work and urges those 

employed to perform it.

The Second Sort removes obstacles and repulses the evil of those who 
oppose it and deals them blows. There are numerous instances of this sec-
ond sort and they are lengthy, 2 so postponing them to another time we shall 
discuss the third sort, which are the lightest.

The  Third  Sort  is  this:  Whenever  those  who  work  sincerely  in  this 
service become lax, they receive a compassionate slap. So coming to their

senses, they take up their work again. Incidents of this sort number more 
than a hundred. Out of only twenty, thirteen or fourteen received compas-
sionate slaps, while six or seven received restraining slaps.

THE FIRST

This  concerns  this  unfortunate  Said:  whenever  I  have  flagged  in  my 
duties,  and  saying,  “ What  is  it  to  me?, ”  have  become  preoccupied  with 
my own private affairs, I have received a slap. I have formed the opinion 
that  I  received  it  due  to  my  neglect.  Because  whatever  my  purpose  was 
that deceived me and spurred me on, I received a slap that was the reverse 
of it. Then studying the compassionate slaps that my sincere friends have 
received, like mine they were always the opposite of whatever their aim was 
– if they were neglectful – so that we have come to the conclusion that such 
incidents were wonders proceeding from service of the Qur’an.

For  example,  as  long  as  this  unfortunate  Said  was  busy  teaching  the 
truths of the Qur’an in Van at the time of the Shaykh Said events, 1 the sus-
picious government did not and could not interfere with me. Then when I 
said “ What is it to me?, ” and thinking of myself withdrew into a ruined cave 
on Mount Erek in order to save my life in the hereafter, they arrested me for 
no reason and sent me into exile. I was brought to Burdur.

There, again as long as I was serving the Qur’an… at that time all the 
exiles were watched very closely and I was supposed to report to the police 
in  person  every  evening,  but  I  and  my  sincere  students  held  ourselves  to 
be exceptions. I never ever went; I did not recognize the government. The 
Governor there complained to Fevzi Pasha 2 when he visited but Fevzi Pasha 
replied:  “ Don’t  interfere  with  him!  Treat  him  with  respect! ”  What  made 
him say that was the sacred nature of service of the Qur’an. Yet whenever 
I was overcome by the idea of saving myself and thought only of my life 
in  the  hereafter  and  there  was  a  temporary  slackening  in  my  serving  the 
Qur’an, I received a slap contrary to my intentions. That is to say, I was sent 
from one place of exile to another. I was sent to Isparta.

In Isparta I took up my duties again. After twenty days, a number of cow-
ardly people said by way of a warning: “ Perhaps the government won’t look 
kindly on this situation. It would be better if you go a bit cautiously. ” Again 
the idea of thinking only of myself took hold of me, and I said: “ Don’t let

anyone come! ” And I was taken from that place of exile and sent to a third, 
to Barla.

And in Barla whenever a slackness has come over me and the idea of 
thinking  of  myself  alone  has  gripped  me,  one  of  these  serpents  and  two-
faced hypocrites from among ‘the worldly’ 1 has been set to pester me. Dur-
ing this eight years eighty such incidents have befallen me; I could recount 
them, but am cutting them short so as not to bore people.

My brothers! I have described some of the compassionate slaps I have 
received, now if you will permit it and forgive me, I shall relate some that 
have befallen you. Don’t be offended. If anyone is offended, I will not put 
his name.

THE SECOND

My  true  brother  and  first  and  most  superior  and  self-sacrificing  stu-
dent, Abdülmecid, 2 had a fine house in Van. He was well-off and he was a 
teacher. Following his own ideas, he did not join those who were attempting 
to send me to the border region against my wishes, which was a place more 
in need of Qur’anic service, and as though for my benefit, did not vote for 
it. As though, if I had gone there, my service of the Qur’an would not have 
been apolitical or sincere, and they would have expelled him from Van – so 
he did not take part. But he received a compassionate slap contrary to his 
intentions, for he had to leave both Van, and his beautiful house, and his 
native region; he was compelled to go to Ergani.

THE THIRD

Hulûsi  Bey 3  was  crucial  to  our  service  of  the  Qur’an.  There  were  a 
number  of  things  when  he  returned  to  his  native  region  from  Eğridir  that 
would have afforded him much enjoyment and worldly happiness, perhaps 
causing him to become slack in his service of the Qur’an, which pertains 
solely to the hereafter. For he was reunited with his parents, whom he had 
not seen for a long time, and he was back home, and because he had returned 
there  with  rank  and  honour,  the  world  was  smiling  on  him  and  appeared 
good. However, for those employed in serving the Qur’an, either the world 
must be vexed with them, or they must be vexed at the world, so that they 
can perform that service sincerely and earnestly.

Hulûsi’s heart was certainly unshakeable, but his situation drove him to 
slackness and he received a slap from divine compassion. For one or two 
years a number of dissemblers were set to pester him, which drove away 
all his worldly pleasure. They made both the world vexed at him, and him 
vexed at the world. So in the true meaning of the word he embraced his 
duty earnestly.

THE FOURTH

This is Muhâcir Hâfız Ahmed. 1 He himself said the following:
“ Yes, I confess that I made a mistake when interpretating the question 
of my life in the hereafter and its connection with my service of the Qur’an. 
I had a wish that would cause me to be lax in my service, and I received a 
blow  that  was  compassionate,  but  also  severe  and  was  atonement.  It  was 
like this: my Master ( U s t a d  ) was not in favour of the new measures. 2 My 
mosque was next to his house and the Three Months 3 were drawing close. 
If I had abandoned my mosque, both I would have forfeited much reward, 
and the district would have grown accustomed to not praying. If I had not 
carried  out  the  new  practices,  I  would  have  been  barred.  So  according  to 
my  interpretation  I  wanted  my  Master,  whom  I  loved  more  than  my  life, 
to temporarily move to another village. I did not know that if he moved, or 
went to another region, it would cause a temporary lapse in our service of the 
Qur’an. Just at that juncture I received a blow. It was compassionate but so 
awesome that three months later I still have not regained my senses. How-
ever, praise be to Allah, according to what my Master says, it was imparted 
to him that we may hope from divine mercy that each minute of the calamity 
is equivalent to a day’s worship. For the mistake was not due to enmity; the 
wish occurred to me only because I was thinking of my life in the hereafter. ”

THE FIFTH

This is Hakkı Efendi. 4 Since he is not here now, I am deputizing for him 
as I did for Hulûsi Bey, and say this: while Hakkı Efendi was carrying out to 
the letter his duties as student, an immoral k a y m a k a m  5 came to the district. 
So he hid what he had written so that harm should come neither to his Mas-
ter, nor to himself. He temporarily gave up his service of the R i s a l e - i   N u r .

Suddenly, a court case was opened against him, which was a sort of slap 
dealt by divine compassion. He was going to have to pay a fine of a thousand 
liras. He was subject to the threat for a year, until he came here and we met, 
and on his return he again took up his service of the Qur’an and the duties 
of being a R i s a l e - i   N u r  student. Then the compassionate slap’s sentence was 
lifted, and he was acquitted.

Later a further duty commenced for the students, which concerned the 
writing  out  of  the  Qur’an  in  a  new  way.  1  A  section  was  given  to  Hakkı 
Efendi. He embarked on it enthusiastically and wrote out a thirtieth part of 
the Qur’an. But because of his straitened circumstances he felt compelled to 
secretly undertake someone’s defence in a court case. He suddenly received 
another  compassionate  slap.  He  broke  the  finger  he  used  to  hold  his  pen 
with.  It  was  as  though  warning  him:  “ This  finger  won’t  write  out  both  a 
lawyer’s case and the Qur’an! ” We were astonished at his finger because we 
did not know about his taking on the case. Then it was understood that the 
sacred, pure service of the Qur’an did not want to involve the fingers which 
were particular to it in other work. Anyway I know Hulûsi Bey like I know 
myself and spoke in his place, and Hakkı Bey is just the same. If he does not 
like my acting as his proxy, he can write about his slap himself!

THE SIXTH

This is Bekir Efendi. 2 He is not here at present, so in the same way that 
I deputized for my brother Abdülmecid, relying on his confidence and loy-
alty and what all my close friends like Şamlı Hafız and Süleyman Efendi 
say and know, I say this: Bekir Efendi had the Tenth Word printed. Then 
we sent him the Twenty-Fifth Word, about the Qur’an’s Miraculousness, to 
print before the new letters were introduced. 3 We also wrote that we would 
send him the printing costs, as we sent him the costs of printing the Tenth 
Word. But thinking of my poverty and seeing that the printing costs would 
be  around  four  hundred  l i r a s ,  Bekir  Efendi  thought  to  himself:  “ Perhaps 
the Hoja won’t be pleased if I pay it out of my own pocket, ” and his soul 
deceived him. It was not printed and caused considerable harm to our serv-
ice of the Qur’an. Two months later nine hundred liras of his were stolen and 
he received a compassionate but severe blow. Allah willing, the lost nine 
hundred liras was like a sort of almsgiving.

THE SEVENTH

75

This is Şamlı Hafız Tevfik. 1 He himself says: “ Yes, I confess that because 
of some things I did unknowingly and in error that would have caused harm 
to our service of the Qur’an, I received two compassionate slaps. I have no 
doubt that they were the result of that.

“ T h e   F i r s t :  All praise be to Allah, I was endowed with handwriting of 
the Arabic script which is to a degree suitable for writing the Qur’an. My 
Master first of all assigned me three thirtieth parts of the Qur’an to write 
out, and divided the rest among the others. Desire to write out the Qur’an 
destroyed my wish to perform the service of writing out the rough and final 
drafts of the parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . I even had the conceited idea of want-
ing to surpass the others who did not know how to write the Arabic script 
properly. I had even said arrogantly when my Master told me as a precaution 
about the writing that it was for him: “ I know this. I don’t need to learn it. ” 
I received an extraordinary and unimaginable slap because of this mistake: 
what I wrote was not even as good as that of a brother ( Husrev ) who knew 
the least about writing the Arabic script. We were all astonished. And we 
have understood now that it was a slap.

“ T h e   S e c o n d :   I  confess  that  two  of  my  attitudes  were  damaging  for 
the complete sincerity necessary for service to the Qur’an, which has to be 
purely for Allah’s sake, and I received a severe blow. For I am like a stranger 
in the region, and foreign. Also – but I should not complain – since I did not 
observe frugality and contentment, important rules of my Master, I suffer 
from poverty. I am compelled to mix with selfish and arrogant people, and 
so,  may  Allah  forgive  it,  I  was  forced  to  be  generous  in  hypocritical  and 
sycophantic manner. My Master frequently warned, reminded, and scolded 
me, but unfortunately I could not stop myself. On the one hand satans from 
among jinn and men were profiting from this situation of mine which was 
opposed to the spirit of service of the All-Wise Qur’an, and on the other it 
caused a coldness and slackness in our service.

“ In the face of this fault of mine, I received a severe, but Allah willing 
compassionate, blow. I have no doubt that it happened in consequence of 
that fault. The blow was this: although for eight years I have had both close

relations with my Master and been his writer of rough drafts and final drafts, 
for around eight months, I had been unable to benefit from the R i s a l e - i   N u r . 
We were astonished at this situation. Both I and my Master sought the rea-
son, wondering why it was thus. Now we feel certain that those truths of the 
Qur’an are light and luminous, and cannot unite with the darkness of artifi-
ciality, flattery, and abasement. So the meaning of those truths’ lights were 
drawing away from me, appearing foreign to me and as strangers. I beseech 
Almighty Allah that He will grant me sincerity worthy of such service, and 
save me from hypocrisy and artificiality towards ‘the worldly.’ I request of 
firstly my Master and all my brothers that they pray for me.

This is Seyrani. Like Husrev, he was one of my students who was enthu-

my students in Isparta about the ‘coincidences,’ which are a key to the mys-
teries of the Qur’an and to the science of j a f r . They responded and took part 
eagerly, but because Seyrani had other ideas and points of interest, he did 
not respond, and in addition wanted me to give up the truth I knew to be cer-
tain. He wrote me a letter that upset me considerably. I said: “ Alas! I have 
lost  this  student. ”  Certainly  I  wanted  to  enlighten  his  ideas,  but  a  further 
meaning confused matters. He received a blow from divine compassion: he 
remained for nearly a year in a place of seclusion ( that is, in prison ).

honour to be sufficient – although they had made it their way to follow the 
practices  of  the  Prophet  ( UWBP )  and  avoid  innovations  –  he  took  it  on 
himself to teach a serious innovation in the hope of increasing his standing 
in the eyes of ‘the worldly.’ He perpetrated an error that was diametrically 
opposed  to  our  way.  He  received  an  awesome  slap  from  divine  compas-
sion. An incident occurred that completely destroyed his family’s honour. 
Unfortunately, Hâfız Zühtü the Younger was also affected by the grievous 
incident  although  he  was  not  deserving  of  any  slap.  But  Allah  willing  it 
will act as a beneficial surgical operation delivering his heart from worldly 
attachment and making it over totally to the Qur’an.

This is someone called Hâfız Ahmed ( May Allah have mercy on him ). 
For two or three years he wrote out the treatises in encouraging fashion 
and he benefited from them. Then ‘the worldly’ took advantage of a weak 
trait in his character. His enthusiam was dampened. He had relations with 
‘the worldly,’ perhaps so that he would avoid being harmed by them and 
have  some  say  with  them,  and  win  some  sort  of  position,  and  make  his 
scant livelihood more plentiful. But in return for the slackness and harm 
that was thus caused to his service of the Qur’an, he received two blows. 
One was that he had to support five more people with his scant means, and 
his  situation  became  truly  wretched.  The  second  slap:  as  someone  who 
was  sensitive  in  regard  to  honour  and  self-respect  and  could  not  brook 
anyone’s criticism or objections, he was unknowingly used as a shield by 
some  cunning  people  in  such  a  way  that  his  honour  was  sullied.  Ninety 
per cent of his honour was destroyed and ninety per cent of people were 
turned against him. May Allah forgive him! Allah willing, he will come to 
his senses and return in part to his duty.

This was not written since perhaps he would not agree.

THE ELEVENTH

THE TWELFTH

This is the teacher, Galib ( May Allah have mercy on him ). Yes, he per-
formed great services loyally and appreciatively in writing out final drafts 
of the treatises, displaying no weakness in the face of any difficulties. Most 
days he would come, and listening eagerly, copy them down. Then in return 
for a fee of thirty l i r a s  he had the whole of T h e   Wo r d s  and L e t t e r s  written 
out.  His  aim  was  to  distribute  them  in  his  native  region  and  to  enlighten 
the people there. But due to certain ideas, he did not distribute the treatises 
as he had envisaged and left them in their box. Suddenly a grievous event 
occurred due to which he suffered distress for a year. He gained numerous 
unjust,  tyrannical  enemies  in  place  of  a  handful  of  official  enemies  who 
would have been inimical just because he had distributed the treatises, and 
lost some of his friends.

THE THIRTEENTH

This is Hâfız Halid 1 ( May Allah grant him mercy ). He said: 
“ Yes, I confess that I was feverishly engaged in writing out rough drafts 
of the works my Master disseminated in serving the Qur’an, when the post

of i m a m  in a mosque in our quarter became available. With the intention of 
dressing once again in my former robe and wearing the turban, I temporar-
ily neglected my service and avoided doing it. I received a compassionate 
slap contrary to my intentions. Although for eight or nine months I acted as 
i m a m , extraordinarily I was unable to wear the turban, despite the repeated 
promises of the Mufti. I have no doubt that this compassionate slap was the 
result of my error. I was both someone addressed by my Master, and was 
his scribe of rough drafts. He suffered difficulties due to my neglect. In any 
event… Still, thanks be to Allah, we realized my error and understood just 
how sacred this service is. We were confident that we had behind us a Mas-
ter like a protecting angel, like Shah Geylani.

“ The weakest of Allah’s servants,

“ H â f ı z   H a l i d  ”

THE FOURTEENTH

This consists of the three small slaps the three Mustafa’s received.
T h e   F i r s t : For eight years Mustafa Çavuş ( May Allah grant him mercy ) 
attended to our small private mosque, and saw to its stove, paraffin, and even 
the matches. I learnt later that for the eight years he provided for the paraffin 
and matches out of his own pocket. On the night before Friday in particular 
he would join the congregation as long as there was no other essential mat-
ter to attend to. Then, taking advantage of his ingenuousness, ‘the worldly’ 
said to him: “ They are going to interfere in Hâfız’s – one of the scribes of the 
Wo rd s  – wearing a turban. He should also temporarily stop making the call to 
prayer secretly. You tell the scribe to take off his turban before they remove 
it by force. ” They did not know that it was extremely difficult for someone 
with a lofty spirit like Mustafa Çavuş to tell someone else employed in serv-
ice of the Qur’an to remove his turban. But he told him what they had said.
That  night  I  dreamt  that  Mustafa  Çavuş  came  to  my  room  with  dirty 
hands  behind  the  k a y m a k a m .  I  asked  him  the  following  day:  “ Mustafa 
Çavuş, who did you see today? I dreamt of you with dirty hands behind the 
k a y m a k a m . ” He replied: “ Alas! The village headman told me to ‘tell the 
scribe.’ I didn’t know what was behind it. ”

Also, that same day he brought almost an o k k a  1 of paraffin to the mosque. 
In a way he had never done before, he left the door open and a kid entered. 
Then a big man came, and supposing the paraffin in the ewer to be water, 
sprinkled it all around the mosque, in order to clean it and the mess left by 

1.  An o k k a  was the equivalent of 2.9 lbs. [ Tr. ]

the kid on the prayer-mat. It is extraordinary that he did not smell the paraf-
fin. That is to say, the mosque did not allow the man to smell it, in order to 
tell Mustafa Çavuş through the tongue of disposition: “ We don’t need your 
paraffin. I haven’t accepted it because of the mistake you made. ” That week 
on the eve of Friday and other important prayers, even, he was unable to join 
the congregation, although he tried to. Then he repented earnestly and asked 
forgiveness, and he regained his purity of heart.

T h e  S e c o n d  M u s t a f a s :  These are my worthy, hard-working, and impor-
tant  student  Mustafa  from  Kuleönü,  and  his  most  loyal,  self-sacrificing 
friend, Hâfız Mustafa ( May Allah grant him mercy ). After the religious 
festival I sent word telling them not to come lest ‘the worldly’ bother us 
and discourage us in our service of the Qur’an, but if they had to come, 
they should come singly. Then one night, three of them came all together. 
They intended to leave before dawn if the weather was suitable. In a way 
that  had  never  happened  before,  neither  Mustafa  Çavuş,  nor  Süleyman 
Efendi, nor myself, nor themselves, had thought of taking any clear pre-
cautions; we were made to forget to do so. Each of us left it to the others 
and  took  no  measures.  They  left  before  dawn.  Then  for  two  hours  they 
were pounded by such a storm that I was alarmed thinking that they would 
not survive it. This winter there had been no such storm, nor had I pitied 
anyone so much. As a punishment for his lack of caution, I was going to 
send Süleyman after them to find out if they were well and safe. Mustafa 
Çavuş said: “ If he goes, he will be stranded too, and I’ll have to go after 
him to find him. Then Abdullah Çavuş will have to come after me. ” So 
saying: “ We place our trust in Allah! ” we waited.

Q u e s t i o n :  You consider the calamities visited on your special friends to 
be slaps; punishment for laxity in their service of the Qur’an. Whereas those 
that are truly inimical to you and to the service of the Qur’an remain safe 
and sound. Why are friends dealt slaps while enemies are left untroubled?

The Answer: According to, ُموُدَ(cid:192) ُرْ(cid:159)ﯭﯧْ(cid:170)اَو ُموُدَ(cid:192) َ(cid:202) ُمْ(cid:171)ـُ

ّ(cid:147)(cid:170)َا 1 friends’ errors 
are  wrongdoing  of  a  sort  in  this  service  of  the  Qur’an,  and  therefore  are 
swiftly punished. A person receives a compassionate slap and if he is sen-
sible, realizes his error. But enemies oppose this service and try to prevent 
it on account of misguidance. Knowingly or unknowingly, their aggression 
against our service assists atheism. Since unbelief persists, generally they do 
not receive any blows immediately.

THE FLASHES

Just  as  the  penalties  of  those  perpetrating  small  crimes  are  delivered 
locally and serious crimes are sent to the high courts, so too, according to 
the rules, the small errors of believers and close friends are punished swiftly 
and in part in this world, in order to quickly purify them. But the crimes of 
the people of misguidance are so great that since their punishments exceed 
this brief worldly life, as required by justice they are referred to the Supreme 
Tribunal in the eternal realm, and mostly they do not receive any punish-
ment here.

The Hadith ِرِ(cid:158)اﯬﯧْ(cid:170)ا ُةَ

ّد(cid:170)َا 1 alludes to this truth. That is 
to say, because the believer receives partial punishment for his faults in this 
world, it is a place of punishment for him. It is a dungeon and Hell in rela-
tion to his happiness in the hereafter. And since the unbelievers will not be 
released from Hell and they in part receive the rewards for their good works 
in this world and their large sins are postponed, this world is their Paradise 
in  relation  to  their  life  in  the  hereafter.  For  in  reality  and  in  meaning  the 
believer is also far happier in this world than the unbeliever. A believer’s 
faith is quite simply like a Paradise in his spirit; while the unbeliever’s unbe-
lief sets afire a sort of Hell in his being.

Eleven  of  the  hundreds  of  points  concerning  these  two  sublime  verses 

will be explained concisely.

FIRST POINT

Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) said:

rife. To comply with them in even a small matter of behaviour, particularly 
when the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) community is corrupted, signifies a powerful 
belief and fear of Allah. And to follow the practices recalls the Noble Mes-
senger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) directly, and such recollection 
is  transformed  into  recollection  of  the  divine  presence.  The  moment  they 
are observed in even the least significant dealings, in the conduct of eating, 1 
drinking, 2 or sleeping, 3 such habitual, natural acts become meritorious acts of 
worship in compliance with the Shari‘a. For the person thinks of following 
Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) and conceives of his actions as conduct of the 
Shari‘a. Then he recalls that the Messenger ( UWBP ) brought the Shari‘a, 
and then his heart turns to Almighty Allah, the True Lawgiver, and he gains 
a sort of awareness of the divine presence and a sense of worship.

By virtue of this mystery, the person who makes it his habit to follow the 
Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices transforms all his acts into worship, and may 
make his whole life fruitful and yielding of reward.

SECOND POINT

Imam-i Rabbani, Ahmad Faruqi ( May Allah be pleased with him ) said: 
“ I saw while traversing the degrees in my spiritual journeying that the ranks 
of the saints that were most brilliant, splendid, subtle, and sound were those 
who made following the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices the basis of their way. 
Even ordinary saints of those ranks appeared more splendid than the highest 
saints of the other. ” 4

Yes, Imam-i Rabbani, the Regenerator of the Second Millennium ( May 
Allah be pleased with him ) speaks the truth. One who takes the Prophet’s 
( UWBP )  practices  as  his  guiding  principles  will  manifest  the  station  of 
being beloved of Allah under the shadow of Allah’s Beloved ( UWBP ).

THIRD POINT

At  a  time  this  poor  Said  was  struggling  to  emerge  from  the  Old  Said, 
his intellect and heart were floundering among truths in a terrible spiritual 
storm resulting from lack of a guide and the pride of his evil-commanding 
soul. They were being tossed around, rising and falling, sometimes from the 
Pleiades to the ground, sometimes from the ground to the Pleiades.

At that time I observed that like q i b l a -directing compasses showing the 
course  to  be  followed  in  ships,  each  of  the  matters  of  the  practices,  even 
small points of conduct, were like electric switches among innumerable haz-
ardous, dark ways. Whenever in the course of that spiritual journeying I saw 
myself under awesome pressure overwhelmed by truly burdensome loads, I 
followed the matters of the practices touching on the situation, I experienced 
a lightness as though all my burdens were being lifted from me. By submit-
ting to them, I was saved from doubts and scruples, that is, from such anxi-
eties as: “ Is this course of action right, is it beneficial? ” But if I gave them 
up,  I  looked  and  saw  that  the  pressure  was  intense;  there  were  numerous 
ways and it could not be known where they led. The load was heavy, and I 
was utterly powerless. My view was short, and the way, dark. But whenever 
I adhered to the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices, the way was lit up and seen to 
be safe. I felt as though the load was being lightened and the pressure lifted. 
At those times I confirmed through my own observations what Imam-i Rab-
bani had said.

FOURTH POINT

At  one  time,  I  saw  myself  in  a  strange  world  that  arose  from  a  state 
of  mind  produced  by  contemplating  death  and  affirming  the  proposition 
ّقَ(cid:110)  ُتْو َ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)َا 1 and from the transience and passing of the world. I saw myself 
as a corpse standing at the head of three huge corpses.

O n e :  I was like a tombstone at the head of the immaterial corpse of all 
living creatures, with which I was connected through my life and which had 
entered the grave of the past.

T h e   S e c o n d : In the graveyard of the globe on the face this century, which 
was the tombstone at the head of the vast corpse buried in the grave of the 
past of all the species of living creatures, with which mankind is connected 
through its life, I was a mere point that would be swiftly erased, an ant that 
would quickly die.

T h e   T h i r d :  Since the universe is certain to die on Doomsday, that is how 
I saw it. In addition to seeing myself in terror at the death agonies of that vast 
corpse, in wonder and astonishment at its death, my own death too, which 
is certain to occur in the future, appeared to be happening at that time. In

all beings, all my beloveds, turned their backs on me, abandoning me and 
leaving me alone. My spirit was being driven towards the future on the side 
of post-eternity, which resembles a boundless ocean. Whether it wanted or 
not, it would be cast into the ocean.

While in that truly strange and sorrowful state of mind, help reached me 

from belief and from the Qur’an; the verse, 

  ¾ ½ ¼ » º ¹ ¸  μ ´ ³ ² ± ° ¯ ® ¬
came  to  my  assistance,  like  a  safe  and  trusty  boat.  My  spirit  boarded  the 
verse with complete confidence and joy. I understood that besides its explicit 
meaning, an allusive meaning had consoled me so that I had found tranquil-
lity and serenity.

Yes, its explicit meaning says to Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom 
be  blessings  and  peace ):  “ If  the  people  of  misguidance  turn  away,  shun 
your Shari‘a and practices and do not heed the Qur’an, do not worry. Say: 
Almighty Allah is enough for me. I place my trust in Him. He will raise up 
others in their place who will follow me. The throne of His rule encompasses 
everything;  the  rebellious  cannot  escape  outside  its  bounds,  nor  do  those 
who seek assistance remain unaided. ” While its allusive meaning says this:
“ O man! And O leader and guide of mankind! If all beings leave you and 
depart for non-existence on the path of transience; if living beings part from 
you  and  hasten  down  the  road  of  death;  if  people  abandon  you  and  enter 
the  graveyard;  if  the  people  of  neglect  and  misguidance  do  not  heed  you 
and fall into darkness; do not be anxious. Say: Almighty Allah suffices me. 
Since He exists, everything exists. Those who have departed have not gone 
to non-existence; they have departed for another of His realms. Out of His 
infinite generosity and from among His innumerable soldiers, that Owner of 
the sublime throne sends others in their place. Those who have entered the 
graveyard have not been annihilated; they have departed for another world. 
He will send other officials in their place. And He can send obedient servants 
who follow the true path in place of those who fall into misguidance. Since 
it is thus, He takes the place of everything. Nothing can take the place of His 
favours, His regard. ”

This allusive meaning caused the three awesome corpses which had ﬁlled 
me with terror to take on another form. They became a wisdom-displaying 
passage under the direction and dominicality of an All-Powerful One of Glory 
Who is both All-Wise, All-Compassionate, and All-Just, within His wisdom 
and  mercy;  an  instructive  excursion,  a  journeying  for  the  performance  of 
duties, a demobilization and a charging with duties, whereby the universe is 
shaken up, and comes and goes.

ELEVENTH FLASH 

FIFTH POINT

The sublime verse,

85

 ( 3:31 ) E D C B A @ ? >
proclaims in definite fashion just how necessary and important it is to fol-
low the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices. Yes, among the syllogisms of logic, 
this verse is the most powerful and certain of the sort called hypothetical or 
conditional syllogisms. It is as follows:

To  exemplify  a  hypothetical  syllogism  it  is  said  in  logic:  “ If  the  sun 
comes out, it will be daytime. ” For a positive result it is said: “ The sun has 
come out. One may therefore conclude that it is daytime. ” For a negative 
result, it is said: “ It is not daytime. One therefore draws the conclusion that 
the sun has not come out. ” According to logic, these two conclusions, nega-
tive and positive, are definite.

In just the same way, the above verse says: “ If you love Allah, you will 
follow Allah’s Beloved ( UWBP ). If you do not follow him, it points to the 
conclusion that you do not love Allah. ” If a person loves Allah, it entails 
following the practices of Allah’s Beloved ( UWBP ). Yes, the person who 
believes in Almighty Allah will certainly obey Him. And the most accept-
able, the most direct, and the shortest among the ways of obeying Him is 
without doubt the way Allah’s Beloved ( UWBP ) showed and followed.

Yes, it is necessary and self-evident that the All-Generous One of Beauty 
who fills the universe with so many bounties should want thanks from con-
scious  creatures  in  return.  And  clearly  that  All-Wise  One  of  Glory  who 
adorns the universe with so many miracles of art will make the most excel-
lent of conscious creatures His addressee and interpreter, and the herald and 
leader of His servants. And certainly and self-evidently that All-Beauteous 
One of Perfection, who makes the universe reflect the innumerable mani-
festations of His beauty and perfections, will give the most perfect worship-
ful  stance  to  the  person  who  is  the  most  comprehensive,  perfect  measure 
and means of displaying His beauty, perfection, names, and art, which He 
clearly loves and wants to display; He will make his conduct a fine example 
to others and encourage them to follow him so that his fine conduct may 
appear in others too.

I n    S h o r t : Love of Allah necessitates and results in following the Proph-
et’s ( UWBP ) practices. How fortunate the person who follows them to a 
large extent! And woe on the person who does not appreciate the practices 
and adopts innovations!

not  to  care  for  the  rules  of  the  Illustrious  Shari‘a  and  principles  of  the 
Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices after they have been completed and perfected 
and to adopt new creations, or Allah forbid, create innovations, which infers 
considering them to be deficient, is misguidance and leads to Hell-fire.

There are degrees in the practices: 2 some are compulsory; these may not 
be given up. This sort are described in detail in the Illustrious Shari‘a. They 
are incontestable and can in no way be changed. Another sort are voluntary, 
and these are of two sorts:

One  sort  includes  those  practices  related  to  worship.  They  too  are 
described in the books of the Shari‘a and to change them is innovation. The 
other sort is known as “ conduct ” ( ā d ā b  ); these practices are mentioned in 
the books of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) biography. Opposition to them cannot 
be called innovation, but it is opposition of a sort to the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) 
conduct and means not benefiting from its light and true courtesy. Follow-
ing this sort entails emulating him in customary, natural acts and dealings, 
which are known through unanimous reports. For example, there are numer-
ous practices showing the conduct of speaking, and explaining the principles 
of eating, drinking, and sleeping, and concerning social relations. Practices 
of this sort are called “ conduct. ” The person who practises them transforms 
his habitual actions into worship and receives significant effulgence. Prac-
tising the smallest aspect of such conduct recalls Allah’s Messenger ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ), which imparts a light to his heart.

The most important among the practices are those that symbolize Islam 
and are connected with its ‘marks.’ The marks of Islam are worship, con-
cern the community, and quite simply are general rights of a sort. Just as the 
whole community benefits from one person doing them, so too if he gives

them up, the whole community is answerable. There can be no hypocrisy in 
the performance of marks of this sort, and they should be proclaimed openly. 
Even if they are of the voluntary sort, they are still more important than per-
sonal obligatory acts.

SEVENTH POINT

The Practices of the Prophet ( UWBP ) are courtesy. There is no matter 
among them beneath which a light, and courtesy, is not found. Allah’s Noble 
Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) said: 
ىـِ(cid:93)(cid:192)ِدْأَ(cid:98)  َنَ(cid:127)ْ(cid:110)َاَ(cid:158) ىـِ
ّدَا  1  Yes,  anyone  who  studies  his  biography  and  is 
acquainted with his practices will certainly understand that Almighty Allah 
brought together in His Beloved every sort of courtesy and good conduct. 
So if anyone gives up the practices, he abandons courtesy. He exemplifies 

ّ(cid:92)َر يِ(cid:179)َ(cid:92)َ

the rule, 
ْب َر 
that causes him loss.

ِ(cid:279)ْ(cid:265)ُ(cid:292)  ْزَا  ْ(cid:239) َ(cid:252)אَ(cid:214)  ْمو

(cid:243) ْ(cid:233) َ(cid:296)  ْبَدَا (cid:309)ــِ(cid:214) and is discourteous in a way 

Question: How can there be courtesy in the face of the Knower of All 
Things, who sees and knows everything and from whom nothing can be hid-
den? Situations which cause shame or embarrasment cannot be concealed 
from Him. One sort of courtesy is covering the necessary members and veil-
ing distasteful situations. But nothing can be hidden from the sight of the 
Knower of All Things.

T h e   A n s w e r   :   F i r s t l y :  Giving  it  the  greatest  importance,  the  Glorious 
Creator wants to show that His art is beautiful; He veils detestable things; 
He attracts attention to His bounties by decorating them. So too, He wants 
to show to conscious beings that His creatures and servants are beautiful. 
Their appearing in ugly situations is a sort of rebellion against His names 
of Beauteous, Adorner, Subtle, and Wise, and is contrary to courtesy. Thus, 
the courtesy of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices means assuming a stance of 
pure courtesy within the bounds of the Glorious Maker’s names.

S e c o n d l y :  Professionally, a doctor may examine the private member of 
someone who is canonically a stranger to him, and if necessary it may be 
shown to him and this cannot be said to be discourteous. Indeed, it may be 
said that the conduct of medicine requires it. But the same doctor may not 
examine the member as a man, or as a preacher or teacher, and courtesy can-
not issue a f a t w a  permitting it to be shown. To do so would be shameless.

THE FLASHES

In  just  the  same  way,  the  Glorious  Maker  has  numerous  names  and 
each  has  a  different  manifestation.  For  example,  just  as  the  name  of  Oft-
Forgiving requires the existence of sins and Veiler, the existence of faults, 
so the name of Beauteous does not wish to see ugliness. Names pertaining 
to divine beauty and perfection like Subtle, Munificent, All-Wise, and All-
Compassionate require that beings be in the most beautiful form and best 
possible situations. Such names want to display their beauties in the view 
of angels, spirit beings, jinn and man through the beautiful states and fine 
conduct of beings. Thus, the conduct of the practices are the signs of this 
elevated conduct, and its principles and samples.

EIGHTH POINT

Coming after the verse,  

...~ } | 

[ to the end of the 
verse ], ( 9:128 ) which shows the Noble Messenger’s ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ) perfect kindness and compassion towards his community, 
the verse,  ( 9:129 ) ± ° ¯ ® ¬ says:

O  mankind!  And  O  Muslims!  You  should  understand  how  lacking  in 
conscience and unreasonable it is to turn away from the practices and the 
decrees that the Noble Prophet ( UWBP ) conveys as though casting asper-
sions on his self-evident compassion, for he guides you with infinite kind-
ness, expending all his strength for your good, and curing with his practices 
and decrees your spiritual wounds.

O compassionate Prophet and clement Messenger! If they do not recog-
nize this vast compassion and benevolence of yours and out of their foolish-
ness turn their backs and do not listen, don’t be anxious. Sufficient for you is 
the All-Glorious One, under whose command are the cohorts of the heavens 
and  earth,  and  the  sovereignty  of  whose  dominicality  rules  over  the  sub-
lime all-encompassing throne. He will muster around you His true, obedient 
troops and make them heed you and accept your decrees!

Yes, there is no matter of the Shari‘a of Muhammad ( UWBP ) and his 
practices  which  does  not  contain  numerous  instances  of  wisdom.  This 
wretched one claims and is ready to prove it, despite all his faults and pow-
erlessness. Furthermore, the seventy to eighty parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  so far 
written are like seventy to eighty truthful witnesses testifying to how full of 
wisdom and truth are the matters of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) practices and 
his Shari‘a. If I were capable of it and they had been written, seven thousand 
treatises  on  this  subject  could  not  completely  describe  those  instances  of 
wisdom, let alone seventy.

ELEVENTH FLASH

Moreover, I have observed and experienced perhaps a thousand times in 
my own self that the principles and matters of the Shari‘a and practices of 
the  Prophet  ( UWBP )  are  all  highly  beneficial  remedies  for  sicknesses  of 
the spirit, mind, and heart, and particularly for social sicknesses, and that 
matters put forward by philosophy cannot take their place, and to an extent 
I have made known to others in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  what I have experienced. If 
anyone doubts this claim of mine, let them refer to the parts of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  and see for themselves.

It may be seen from this just how profitable it is to try to follow as far as 
is possible the practices of such a person, and how advantageous for eternal 
life, and how beneficial for worldly life.

NINTH POINT

Actually following to the letter every aspect of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) 
practices is only bestowed on the highest of the elite. If it is not possible to 
follow them in practice, everyone can seek to do so by intention, purpose, 
and by supporting them and being biased towards them. In any event one is 
compelled to follow the obligatory and compulsory sorts. And even if there 
is no sin involved in giving up the practices which are ‘recommended’, it 
results in considerable loss of merit. And if they are changed, it is a great 
error. When the practices are followed in habitual actions and dealings, such 
acts become worship. While if they are not followed, it is not to be reproved, 
but  the  benefit  from  the  light  of  the  daily  conduct  of  Allah’s  Beloved 
( UWBP ) is less.

New creations in the ordinances concerning worship are innovation, and 

since innovations are opposed to the verse, 

( 5:3 ) ...N M L K
they are to be rejected. 1 However, the recitations and invocations of the Sufi 
way are not innovations on condition they originate in the Book and Sunna, 
and even if they differ in form and manner, their basis and principles do not 
oppose  the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  practices  or  change  them.  Certainly  some 
scholars classed a number of these as innovations, but called them “ com-
mendable innovations. ”  2 Imam-i Rabbani, the Regenerator of the Second 
Millennium, ( May Allah be pleased with him ) said: 

1.  See,  B u k h ā r ī , I’tisām, 5; Buyū‘, 60; Ṣulḥ, 5;  M u s l i m , ‘Aqdiyya, 18;  A b ū   D ā ’ ū d ,

THE FLASHES

“ On my spiritual journeying, I saw that words narrated from the Noble 
Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  were  luminous,  shin-
ing  with  the  rays  of  his  practices.  But  when  I  saw  invocations  and  states 
which were not narrated from him, that light was not on them, even if they 
were brilliant and powerful. The most brilliant of them was not equal to the 
least of the first sort. I understood from this that the rays of the Prophet’s 
( UWBP ) practices are an elixir. Also, for those seeking light, the practices 
are sufficient; there is no need to seek light outside them. ”

This statement of such a hero of reality and the Shari‘a shows that the 
Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices are the foundation stone of the happiness of 
both worlds and the source and spring of all attainment and perfection.

TENTH POINT
The verse,

( 3:31 ) E D C B A @ ? >
displays a miraculous conciseness, for many phrases are included in its three 
phrases. It is as follows:

The verse says: “ If you believe in Allah ( May His Glory be exalted ), 
you will surely love Him. Since you love Allah, you will act in the manner 
He loves. To do that, you must resemble the one Allah loves, and he may be 
resembled by following him. Whenever you follow him, Allah will love you 
too. Anyway you have to love Allah so that He shall love you. ”

These phrases express only a brief and concise meaning of the verse. It 
means  that  man’s  most  exalted  goal  is  to  receive  Almighty  Allah’s  love. 
The verse shows that this may be achieved by following Allah’s Beloved 
( UWBP ) and his practices. If at this stage three points are proved, the above 
truth will become completely clear.

First Point

First  Point:  Man  was  created  with  an  infinite  innate  love  for  the  uni-
verse’s Creator. For included in his nature are a love of beauty, an ardour 
for perfection, and passion for bestowal. His love increases proportionately 
to  the  degrees  of  beauty,  perfection,  and  bestowal,  reaching  the  furthest 
degrees of ecstatic ardour.

Furthermore, tiny man’s tiny heart may hold a love as great as the uni-
verse.  Yes,  the  fact  that  writings  equivalent  to  a  library  of  thousands  of 

ELEVENTH FLASH 

91

books may be inscribed in the faculty of memory, which is a coffer of the 
heart’s the size of a lentil, shows that the human heart may contain the uni-
verse and bear love that great.

Since  inherent  in  human  nature  is  such  an  infinite  capacity  to  love 
bestowal, beauty, and perfection; and since the universe’s Creator possesses 
infinite sacred beauty, the existence of which is self-evidently established 
by His works apparent in the universe; and since He possesses infinite holy 
perfection, the existence of which is necessarily proved by the embroideries 
of His art to be seen in beings; and since He is the owner of infinite boun-
ties, the existence of which is certainly, indeed, self-evidently established 
by the infinite varieties of His bestowal and bounties to be observed in liv-
ing creatures; these surely demand infinite love from man, who is the most 
comprehensive, the most needy, the most thoughtful, and the most yearning 
of conscious beings.

Indeed, all human beings are capable of infinite love for the All-Glo-
rious  Creator,  and  in  the  face  of  His  beauty,  perfection,  and  bestowal, 
the Creator is more deserving of love than anyone. All the varieties of 
love  and  intense  attachment  a  believing  human  being  has  for  his  life, 
immortality, and existence, his world, his self, and other beings, are mere 
droplets of his capacity to love Allah. His various intense emotions are 
transformations  of  that  capacity  to  love,  and  distillations  of  it  in  other 
forms. It is clear that just as man takes pleasure at his own happiness, so 
he receives pleasure at the happiness of others to whom he is attached. 
And just as he loves someone who saves him from disaster, so he loves 
someone who saves those he loves. In consequence of this mental atti-
tude, if a person thinks only of this out of all the varieties of divine boun-
ties bestowed on all men, he will say: 

My Creator saved me from non-existence, which is eternal darkness, and 
gave me a beautiful world like this one. Then when the time comes for me to 
die, He will again save me from non-existence, which is eternal extinction, 
and from annihilation, and bestow on me in an eternal realm an everlasting 
and truly magnificent world. And just as He has bestowed on me external 
and inner senses and feelings with which to benefit from all the varieties of 
delights and good things of the world and to roam around it and make excur-
sions, so He bestows innumerable bounties on all my relatives and friends 
and fellow-men, all of whom I love and to whom I am attached. Those boun-
ties are also mine in a way, because I am happy and receive pleasure at their 

92

THE FLASHES

ْ(cid:202)َا 1 every-
happiness. Since in accordance with the rule,  ِناَ(cid:127)ْ(cid:110)ِ
one in a sense worships benevolence, certainly in the face of such innumer-
able favours, since I have a heart as great as the universe, it necessitates its 
being filled with love at those favours, and I want to fill it. If in fact I am 
unable to love that much, I can do so potentially, by intention, belief, accept-
ance, appreciation, longing, taking the part of, and by will. And so on.

ْ(cid:202)ا ُد(cid:193)ِ(cid:93)َ(cid:150) ُناَ(cid:127)ْ(cid:178)ِ

Analogies  may  be  drawn  with  the  love  for  bestowal  we  have  briefly 
alluded to here for the love man feels for beauty and perfection. As for the 
unbelievers, they are infinitely hostile because of their unbelief, and even 
bear a wrongful and insulting enmity towards the universe and all beings.

Second Point

Second  Point:  Love  of  Allah  necessitates  following  the  Practices  of 
Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). For to love Allah is to 
do what pleases Him, and the things that please Him are manifested in most 
perfect form in the person of Muhammad ( UWBP ). There are two ways of 
resembling Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) actions and deeds:

T h e   F i r s t :   Obeying  Almighty  Allah’s  commands  in  respect  of  loving 
Him  and  within  the  bounds  of  what  pleases  Him  necessitates  following 
them, for the most perfect leader in such matters is the person of Muham-
mad ( UWBP ).

T h e   S e c o n d :   Since  the  person  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP )  is  the  chief 
means of man receiving innumerable divine favours, he is surely worthy of 
boundless love for the sake of Almighty Allah. If man is capable of resem-
bling someone he loves, by nature he wants to do so. This definitely neces-
sitates that those who love Allah’s Beloved ( UWBP ) try to resemble him by 
following his illustrious practices.

Third Point

Third Point: Almighty Allah has boundless love, just as He has infinite 
compassion. Just as He makes Himself loved in infinite fashion through all 
the fine qualities and adornment of the creatures in the universe, so He loves 
in  particular  conscious  beings  who  respond  with  love  to  His  making  His 
artefacts loved. It may be clearly understood how important and exalted an 
aim it is to try to attract the love of the Being one manifestation of whose 
mercy are all the subtle wonders and good things and delights and bounties 
of Paradise. Since it is stated clearly that His love is won only through fol-
lowing Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) practices, it is certain that it should be man’s 
greatest aim and his most urgent duty.

First Matter

This consists of three matters.
F i r s t   M a t t e r :  The sources of the Noble Messenger’s ( UWBP ) illustrious 
practices  are  threefold:  his  words,  his  acts,  and  his  conduct.  And  each  of 
these has three categories: obligatory, voluntary, and laudable.

It  is  imperative  to  follow  those  that  are  obligatory  and  compulsory, 
and  penalties  and  punishment  are  incurred  for  giving  them  up.  Everyone 
is  charged  with  following  them.  As  for  the  voluntary  sort,  as  a  means  of 
winning Allah’s love, the believers are again charged with following them, 
but they receive no penalty if they fail to do so. However, to act in accord-
ance with them and to follow them is highly meritorious, while to change 
them is innovation, misguidance, and a great error. To emulate the Proph-
et’s  ( UWBP )  customary  actions  is  extremely  laudable  and  in  accordance 
with wisdom, and is beneficial for both personal life and social life and for 
humankind.  For  all  his  habitual  actions  produce  numerous  things  benefi-
cial for life, and furthermore, by following them, such conduct and actions 
become worship.

Yes,  since  as  both  friend  and  foe  agree,  the  person  of  Muhammad 
( UWBP ) manifested the highest degrees of moral virtues; and since as all 
are agreed, he is the most famous and excellent member of the human race; 
and since as is indicated by his thousands of miracles, and testified to by 
the World of Islam that he founded and its achievements, and is affirmed by 
the truths of the Qur’an, which he heralded and interpreted, he was the most 
excellent Perfect Man and most excellent guide; and since as the fruit of fol-
lowing him, millions of the people of perfection have advanced through the 
degrees of attainment and reached the happiness of both worlds; for sure his 
practices and actions are the finest examples to be followed, and the safest 
guides, and the soundest laws to be adopted as principles. Happy the person 
who has a large share of following the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices. While 
those who are lazy and do not follow them suffer vast loss, and those who 
consider them to be unimportant commit a great crime, while if they criticize 
them, which infers denying them, it is serious misguidance. 1

Second Matter

S e c o n d   M a t t e r :  Almighty Allah decrees in the All-Wise Qur’an,

THE FLASHES

According to sound narrations, when the distinguished Companion ‘A’isha 
the  Veracious  ( May  Allah  be  pleased  with  her )  described  the  Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), she would say: “ His character is the 
Qur’an. ” 1 That is to say, Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 
is the exemplar of the fine moral qualities described by the Qur’an. He con-
forms to them more than anyone, and his nature was created in accordance 
with them.

So even lunatics would understand how unfortunate are those heedless 
members of his community who believe in him yet give no importance to his 
practices or want to change them, despite each of his deeds, states, words, 
and actions being worthy of emulation by mankind.

Third Matter

T h i r d   M a t t e r :  Since the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ) was created with the most moderate character in the most perfect form, 
his actions and rest all proceeded on moderation and equanimity. 2 His biogra-
phy shows clearly that he always acted with moderation and equanimity, and 
avoided excess and neglicence.

Yes,  Allah’s  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace ) 

conformed completely to the command:

( 11:112 ) [ Z Y
and moderation is apparent in all his acts, words, and conduct. For example, 
since  his  reasoning  faculty  was  free  of  wiliness  and  stupidity,  which  are 
excess and deficiency – resembling its corruption and darkness, it always 
functioned with wisdom, the middle way and means of moderation. Simi-
larly, far from rage and cowardice, which are the corruption of the power 
of  anger  and  its  excess  and  deficiency,  his  power  of  anger  was  always 
employed with sacred courage, which is the middle way and means of mod-
eration of that power. And so too, purified of licentiousness and frigidity, 
which are the excess and deficiency of the power of animal appetites and 
its corruption, his power of passion always took chasteness, the means of 
moderation of that power, as guide, at the degree of maximum virtuousness. 
And so on. In all his practices, daily conduct, and in carrying out the injunc-
tions  of  his  Shari‘a,  he  chose  the  way  of  moderation  and  avoided  excess 
and  deficiency,  and  wastefulness  and  prodigality,  which  are  wrongdoing

My Dear, Loyal Brother, Re’fet Bey,
Your questions at this difficult time put me in a difficult position. On this 
occasion they are both unimportant, but they did seem to me to be significant 
since they are related to two points of the Qur’an and your question about 
the  globe  of  the  earth  touches  on  criticisms  about  the  seven  levels  of  the 
earth and the heavens made by geography and astronomy. So disregarding 
the unimportant nature of the questions, I shall explain two fine points about 
two verses of the Qur’an, in a scholarly and general way.

FIRST TOPIC

First Point

This consists of two points.
First Point: According to the verses,

( 29:60 ) w v u t s r q p o

( 51:58 ) Z Y X W V U T 
sustenance  is  supervised  by  the  All-Powerful  One  of  Glory  and  comes 
directly from the treasury of His mercy. Since the sustenance of all living 
creatures is guaranteed by the Sustainer, none should die of hunger. Whereas 
apparently many do die of it and of lack of food. This is a fact on the one 
hand and a mystery on the other, and may be solved as follows:

1.    Re’fet  Barutçu,  1886-1975.  He  first  visited  Bediuzzaman  in  Barla  in  1931  and 
thereafter became one of his close students, serving prison sentences together with him in 
Eskişehir and Denizli. He was a retired y ü z b a ş ı  ( captain ) in the army.

96

TWELFTH FLASH 

97

The Sustainer’s guarantee is true; none die of hunger. For that All-Wise 
One of Glory stores up some of the food He sends to the bodies of living 
creatures as fat, as reserves. In fact, He stores up a part of the sustenance He 
sends to each cell, in the cell, like a reserve stock to be spent when no food 
comes from outside. The creatures die before the store is finished. That is 
to say, death in such cases is not from lack of sustenance; the creatures die 
from mistakenly acquired habits and due to illness resulting from the desire 
for the wrong things and the giving up of habit.

Yes,  the  natural  sustenance  stored  up  in  the  bodies  of  living  creatures 
in the form of fat generally lasts perfectly well for forty days. It may even 
last twice that long in cases of illness or certain ecstatic states. It was writ-
ten in the newspapers thirteen years ago ( and now it is thirty-nine ) that out 
of extreme stubbornness, a man in prison in London managed to live quite 
healthily for seventy days eating nothing at all.

Since the natural sustenance lasts from forty days to seventy or eighty; 
and since the manifestation of the divine name of Provider is apparent on 
the  face  of  the  earth  truly  extensively;  and  since  foods  flow  forth  from 
breasts and from wood even in completely unexpected fashion; if man so 
full of evil does not interfere with his mistaken choices and confuse things, 
that name comes to the assistance of the living creature before the natural 
sustenance is consumed, preventing death from starvation. In which case, 
if those who die of hunger do so in less than forty days, it is definitely not 
from lack of sustenance. Rather, in accordance with the saying, “ the aban-
doning of habit is fatal, ” it occurs either from a bad habit or from illness 
resulting from the giving up of habits. In which case it may be said that 
there is no death from hunger.

Indeed,  observedly,  sustenance  is  in  inverse  proportion  to  power  and 
will. For example, when still in the womb, young are completely deprived of 
power and will yet are fed to repletion. Then when they come into the world 
they still lack power and will, but since they have some sort of ability and 
potential senses, needing only to fasten their mouths to the breast, the most 
perfect, nutritious and easily digestible food is given to their mouths from 
those fountains, in the gentlest form and strangest way. Then as they acquire 
a little amount of power and will, that readily available, fine food starts to be 
withdrawn from them. The fountains of the breasts dry up and the infants’ 
food is sent from elsewhere. However, since their power and will are still 
insufficient to search for it, so the Munificent Provider sends their parents’ 
tenderness and compassion to assist them. Whenever their power and will 

98

THE FLASHES

are perfected, then their sustenance does not hasten to them and is not made 
to  do  so.  The  sustenance  remains  in  its  place,  saying:  “ Come  and  search 
for me and take me! ” That is to say, sustenance is in inverse proportion to 
power and will. We have indeed explained in many parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
that animals most lacking in will and power are better nourished and live 
better than those with greater will and power.

Second Point

Second  Point:  There  are  different  sorts  of  possibility,  like  reasonable 
possibility,  customary  possibility,  and  ordinary  possibility.  If  an  event  is 
not within the bounds of reasonable possibility, it is rejected, and if it is not 
within the bounds of customary possibility, it is a miracle but may not eas-
ily be wonderworking. If there is nothing similar to it, either according to 
common usage or in principle, it can only be accepted through a categorical 
proof as clear as witnessing.

In  consequence  of  this,  the  extraordinary  states  of  Sayyid  Ahmad 
Badawi, 1 who for forty days refrained from eating bread even, are within 
the bounds of customary possibility. It may have been both wonderwork-
ing and an habitual practice out of the ordinary. Yes, there are numerous 
unanimous reports concerning Sayyid Ahmad Badawi’s ( May his mys-
tery be sanctified ) wondrous states and absorption in ecstasy. On occa-
sion, he ate only once in forty days, but he did not do that all the time; 
he achieved it sometimes as an instance of wonderworking. It possibly 
became a habit for him because he did not feel the need to eat while in a 
state of ecstasy. Wonders of this sort have been reliably narrated about 
many saints of his kind. As we proved in the first Point, stored-up sus-
tenance remains undepleted for more than forty days, and it is possible 
not to eat for that length of time through habit, and such a state has been 
reliably reported about people who were out of the ordinary. It therefore 
cannot be denied.

Two important matters will be explained in connection with the second 
question, for the sciences of geography and astronomy have criticized 
the verse and foolishly even tried to deny it, because with their abbrevi-
ated laws and narrow principles and tiny scales they have been unable 
to ascend to the heavens of the Qur’an, and have been unable to dis-
cover the seven levels of meanings in the stars of its verses.

First Important Matter

1.  Sayyid Aḥmad Badawī ( d. 675/1276 ). He was born in Morocco and eventually 
settled in Tanta in Egypt. He is famous as one of the four Spiritual Poles whose saintly 
powers persisted after their deaths.

FIRST IMPORTANT MATTER

This is about the earth having seven levels like the heavens. This matter 
appears to the philosophers of the present time to be untrue; their sciences 
about the earth and heavens find it unacceptable, and making it a pretext, 
they oppose some of the truths of the Qur’an. We shall point out concisely 
a few points about this.

The First

T h e   F i r s t   :   F i r s t l y ,  the verse’s meaning is one thing and the parts of the 
meaning and points confirming it, another. The meaning cannot be denied if 
one of the many parts of the universal meaning is absent. Of the numerous 
parts of the universal meaning concerning the seven levels of the heavens 
and seven layers of the earth, seven points confirming it are clearly apparent.
S e c o n d l y ,  the verse does not explicitly state that “ the earth has seven lay-

ers. ” The apparent meaning of the verse is,
( 65:12 ) Ü Û Ú Ù Ø × Ö Õ  [  t o   t h e   e n d   o f   t h e   v e r s e  ]   “ He 
created the earth like the seven heavens, and made it a dwelling place for His 
creatures. ” It does not say: I created it in seven levels. Its being similar is in 
regard to createdness and being the habitation of creatures.

The Second

The   Second:  The  globe  of  the  earth  is  certainly  very  small  in  rela-
tion  to  the  heavens,  but  as  the  exhibition,  display,  gathering  place  and 
centre of countless divine artefacts, as the heart and immaterial centre of 
the vast, endless heavens, it is equivalent to them, like the heart may be 
seen as equivalent to the body. For this reason, the earth having seven  1 
climes, as was supposed from early times; also the well-known seven con-
tinents, Europe, Africa, Oceania, the two Asias, and the two America’s; 
also  together  with  the  seas,  the  East,  West,  North,  and  South,  the  well-
known seven regions of this face and on the face of the New World; also 
the  various,  contiguous  seven  levels  from  the  centre  to  the  outer  crust, 
which have been established by science; and the famous seven universal 
elements called the seven levels, which comprise the seventy simple ele-
ments  that  are  the  means  of  perpetuating  animate  creatures’  lives;  also 
the four elements of water, air, fire, and earth, together with the animal, 
vegetable,  and  mineral  kingdoms,  making  seven  levels  and  realms;  also 
the  seven  realms  of  the  earth  verified  by  those  who  uncover  the  secrets 
of  creation  and  the  people  of  witnessing,  who  are  very  numerous,  their 
testimony that they are the worlds and habitations of jinns, demons, and 

1.  The seven repetitions of the word seven here makes a fine ‘coincidence’ ( T. t e v â f u k ; 

Ar. t a w ā f u q  ).

100

THE FLASHES

other various sentient and living creatures; also the seven levels indicat-
ing that seven further globes exist resembling our globe, and that they are 
the dwelling places of living creatures – from these indications it has been 
understood from verses of the Qur’an that the earth too has seven levels.

It thus becomes clear that the earth has seven sorts of levels that exist 
in  seven  ways.  The  eighth,  which  is  the  final  meaning,  is  important  from 
another point of view; it is not included in the seven.

The Third

The  Third: Since the Absolutely Wise One wastes nothing and creates 
nothing in vain; and since creatures exist for conscious beings and find their 
perfection by means of conscious beings and rejoice through them and are 
saved from futility by means of them; and since observedly the Absolutely 
Wise One, the All-Powerful One of Glory, fills the element of air, and world 
of water, and layer of earth with innumerable living beings; and since just 
as air and water are not an obstacle to the movement of animals, so dense 
matter like earth and stone do not form obstacles to the passage of matter 
like electricity and X-rays; for sure the All-Wise One of Glory, the Undying 
Maker, will not leave empty and uninhabited the broad spaces and worlds 
and caves and seven contiguous layers from the centre of our globe to the 
outer crust, which is our habitation and centre. He has certainly populated 
them  and  created  and  settled  there  conscious  beings  appropriate  to  those 
worlds. Since those sentient creatures must be angels and spirit beings of a 
sort, the densest and hardest layer even will be to them as the sea is to fish 
and the air is to birds. The awesome heat at the centre of the earth even must 
be for those conscious creatures like the sun’s heat is for us. Created from 
light, for those sentient spirit beings fire is like light.

The Fourth

The  Fourth: Mentioned in the Eighteenth Letter is a comparison about 
the depictions made by the people of illumination of the strange wonders 
of the earth’s levels, which are outside the bounds of reason. A summary 
is this:

In the Manifest Realm the globe is a seed, while in the World of Simili-
tudes and Intermediate Realm it is so vast as to be equal to the heavens. If 
the people of illumination have seen a level of the earth particular to demons 
which has a breadth of a thousand years, it is not in the seed of the earth that 
pertains to the Manifest World; but is a manifestation of its branches and 
levels in the World of Similitudes. Since an apparently insignificant level 
of the earth has such a vast manifestation in another world, surely it may be 
said that it has seven levels which are the equivalent of the seven levels of 
the heavens. In order to call to mind the above points, the Qur’an’s verses 

TWELFTH FLASH 

101

allude to them by showing in a miraculously concise way that the tiny earth 
is the equivalent of the seven levels of the heavens.

Second Important Matter

SECOND IMPORTANT MATTER

 ( 17:44 ) h g f e d c b  [  t o   t h e   e n d   o f   t h e   v e r s e  ]  
( 2:29 ) Ñ Ð Ï Î Í Ì Ë Ê É È Ç Æ
Numerous verses like these depict the heavens as sevenfold. It is appro-
priate to write here only a summary of this matter, which of necessity we 
expounded extremely briefly in the commentary  I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z  ( S i g n s   o f  
M i r a c u l o u s n e s s  ), while on the front in the first year of the Great War. It is 
as follows:

Ancient philosophy conceived of the heavens as being nine in number; 
accepting in the tongue of the Shari‘a the throne of Allah and seat of Allah 
together with the seven heavens, they depicted the heavens in strange man-
ner. The glittering terms of the philosophers held mankind under their sway 
for many centuries. In fact, many Qur’anic commentators were compelled 
to  make  the  apparent  meanings  of  verses  conform  to  their  school.  In  this 
way the All-Wise Qur’an’s miraculousness was veiled to an extent. As for 
the new philosophy, called modern science, in the face of the excesses of 
ancient philosophy about the heavens it went to the other extreme and quite 
simply denied the heavens’ existence. The former went to excess and the 
latter was deficient; they were unable to portray reality in its entirety.

As  for  the  sacred  wisdom  of  the  All-Wise  Qur’an,  it  left  aside  such 
excess and deficiency and choosing the middle way said that the All-Glori-
ous Maker created the seven levels of the heavens. The planets swim in the 
heavens like fish and glorify Allah. It says in a Hadith:  ٌفوُ(cid:159)ﯰﯧَ(cid:174)  ٌجْوَ(cid:174) ُءا َ(cid:175) َ
ّ(cid:127)(cid:170)َا 
1 That is, the heavens are an ocean the waves of which are stationary.

We shall prove this Qur’anic truth extremely briefly with rules and seven 

aspects of meaning.

First Rule

F i r s t   R u l e :   It  is  established  by  science  and  philosophy  that  limitless 

space is not an infinite vacuum, but is filled with matter called ether.

Second Rule

T h e   S e c o n d :  It is established by science and reason, indeed by observa-
tion, that a matter which fills space is the bond of the laws governing the

102

THE FLASHES

heavenly bodies like those of attraction and repulsion, and is the conductor 
and transmitter of such forces in matter as light, heat, and electricity.

Third Rule

T h e   T h i r d :  It has been established empirically that while remaining as 
ether, it has various forms and formations like other matter. Just as there are 
three  states  of  the  same  matter,  liquid,  gas  and  solid,  for  instance,  steam, 
water, and ice; so there is nothing to reasonably prevent ether having seven 
states or levels; it cannot be objected to in any way.

Fourth Rule

T h e   F o u r t h :  If the heavenly bodies are studied carefully, it will be seen 
that there is a difference in the levels. The level that contains the vast nebular 
sphere called the Milky Way of course does not resemble the level of the 
fixed stars. It is as if those stars have ripened and matured like the fruits of 
summer, while the uncountable stars apparent in the form of a cloud in the 
Milky Way are constantly emerging and beginning to mature. According to 
accurate conjecture, the level of fixed stars also appears different to the level 
of the solar system. And so on. One may adduce seven systems and seven 
levels which differ from one another.

Fifth Rule

T h e  F i f t h :  It is established by conjecture, sense, inductive reasoning, and 
experience that if a material is given order and form and if other artefacts are 
made from the material, it is transformed into various levels and forms. For 
example, when a diamond mine is worked, from the material, ashes, coal, 
and diamonds are produced. And when fire is lit, it separates into the levels 
of flame, smoke, and embers. And when water and oxygen are combined, 
levels like water, ice, and steam are formed. That is to say, when a single 
substance is worked, it may separate into levels. In which case, when Crea-
tive Power started to work in the substance called ether, in accordance with 
the verse, Ì Ë Ê it created from it seven sorts of heavens as 
differing levels.

Sixth Rule

T h e   S i x t h :  The above indications necessarily indicate both the existence, 
and the plurality, of the heavens. Since the heavens are certainly numerous, 
and the Bringer of Sure News ( UWBP ) stated in the tongue of the Qur’an 
that they number seven, for sure they are seven.

Seventh Rule

T h e   S e v e n t h :  Since in Arabic, terms like seven, seventy, and seven hun-
dred express multiplicity, those universal seven levels may comprise multi-
ple levels.

In Short

I n   S h o r t : The All-Powerful One of Glory created the seven heavens from 
ether, and forming it into levels, ordered it with a truly fine and wondrous 
order and sowed the stars in it. Since the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition is 

TWELFTH FLASH 

103

a pre-eternal address speaking to all the classes of all mankind and the jinn, 
for sure each of those classes will receive its share from the Qur’an’s verses 
and its verses will contain various and numerous meanings, both explicit 
and implicit, in a way that will satisfy the understanding of each.

Yes, the breadth of the Qur’anic address and the comprehensiveness of its 
meanings and indications and its conforming to and flattering all the degrees 
of understanding from the most uneducated common people to the highest 
of the elite shows that all its verses have an aspect which looks to each class. 
Thus, in consequence of this mystery, as an example, seven classes of men 
understand as follows the meaning of seven various levels from the univer-
sal meaning “ seven heavens: ” 

A short-sighted and narrow-minded class of men understands the atmos-
phere  from  the  verse Ì Ë Ê  While  another  class  of  men 
befogged by astronomy understands the famous stars known popularly as 
the  seven  planets,  and  their  orbits.  Yet  another  group  understands  seven 
celestial globes resembling our globe, which are inhabited by living crea-
tures. 1 A further group of men understands the solar system being separated 
into  seven  levels,  and  seven  solar  systems  together  with  our  system.  And 
yet  another  group  undertands  the  ether  being  separated  into  seven  levels. 
Another class of men with broader ideas counts all the visible skies gilded 
with stars as a heaven, and saying that it is this world’s heaven, understands 
that there are six levels of heavens besides it. And mankind’s seventh and 
highest class do not consider the seven heavens to be restricted to the Mani-
fest World, and understands that the Worlds of the Hereafter and the Unseen, 
and this world, and the World of Similitudes all have seven heavens, each of 
which is an encompassing container and roof.

Similarly, there are many further particular meanings in the universal of 
the verse, like the above-mentioned seven levels of meaning of the seven 
levels. Everyone receives his share according to his understanding and eve-
ryone finds his sustenance at that heavenly table.

Since the verse has thus numerous points confirming it, the unreasoning 
philosophers and foolish astronomers attacking the verse in that way on the 
pretext  of  denying  the  heavens  is  like  silly  children  throwing  stones  at  a 
star in the hope of making it fall. Because if one of the points confirming it 
from the verse’s universal meaning is correct, the universal meaning is cor-
rect and true. A particular even which is not literally true but is commonly 

1.  See, al-Ḥākim, a l - M u s t a d r a k , ii, 535; al-Ṭabarī, J ā m i ‘   a l - B a y ā n , xxviii, 153-4.

THE FLASHES

accepted  may  be  included  in  the  universal  meaning  in  order  to  conform 
to  the  generally  held  ideas.  Whereas  we  saw  numerous  particulars  which 
are right and true. Now look at this unfair, unjust geography and drunken 
intoxicated  astronomy:  how  wrong  these  two  sciences  have  been,  closing 
their eyes to the universal meaning, which is right and correct and true, and 
not seeing the aspects which confirm it and are absolutely right; they have 
fancied an imaginary and extraordinary particular to be the meaning of the 
verse and thrown stones at the verse! And they have broken their own heads 
and lost their belief!

I n   S h o r t : Since like jinns and satans, unbelieving materialist ideas have 
been unable to ascend to the seven levels of the skies of the Qur’an, which 
was revealed in seven recitations,  1 and with seven aspects, seven sorts of 
miraculousness, seven truths, and seven pillars, they do not know what there 
is and what there is not in the stars of its verses and give false and inaccurate 
reports.  So  falling  stars  like  the  above  discussion  descend  on  their  heads 
from  the  stars  of  those  verses  and  scorch  them.  Yes,  the  heavens  of  the 
Qur’an cannot be ascended to by means of the jinn-like ideas of philosophy. 
The stars of its verses can only be risen to through the ascension of true wis-
dom and the wings of belief and Islam.

FIRST INDICATION

Q u e s t i o n :   Although  evil  spirits  do  not  interfere  in  the  universe  in  any 
way in regard to creation; and through His mercy and favour Almighty Allah 
takes the part of the people of truth; and the attractive beauties and virtues 
of  truth  and  reality  strengthen  and  encourage  the  people  of  truth,  and  the 
repulsive ugliness of misguidance revolts the people of misguidance; what 
is the reason for Satan’s party very often gaining the upper hand; what is the 
wisdom in it? And why should the people of truth always seek refuge with 
Allah from Satan’s evil?

The Answer: The wisdom and purpose is this: for the most part, mis-
guidance  and  evil  are  negative,  destructive,  and  pertain  to  non-existence. 
While in the great majority of cases, guidance and good are positive, con-
structive, repairing, and pertain to existence. Everyone knows that one man 
can destroy in one day a building constructed by twenty men in twenty days. 
Yes, a person continues to live due to the existence of all the basic members 
and  conditions  of  life,  life  being  particular  to  the  All-Glorious  Creator’s 
power; yet, by severing a member a tyrant may make the person manifest 

105

death, which is non-being in relation to life. Therefore, the saying “ Destruc-
tion is easy ” has become proverbial.

In consequence, the people of misguidance sometimes triumph over the 
people of truth, who are very powerful, with what is in reality a weak force. 
But the people of truth possess a stronghold so unassailable that when they 
take  refuge  in  it,  those  fearsome  enemies  cannot  draw  close;  they  can  do 
nothing. If they cause some temporary harm, according to the verse, 

( 7:128 ) ª ©
everlasting  reward  and  profit  make  up  for  the  damage.  That  impregnable 
stronghold, that fortified citadel, is the Shari‘a of Muhammad ( UWBP ) and 
his practices.

SECOND INDICATION

Q u e s t i o n :  The creation of devils, who are pure evil, and their harassing 
the people of belief, and many people not believing and going to Hell because 
of them, appears to be terrible and ugly. How does the mercy and beauty 
of the Absolutely Beauteous One, the Absolutely Compassionate One, the 
Truly  Merciful  One,  permit  this  infinite  ugliness  and  awesome  calamity? 
Many people have asked about this question, and it occurs to many people.
The  Answer:  In  addition  to  the  minor  evils,  there  are  numerous  uni-
versal good purposes in the existence of Satan, and human attainments and 
perfections. Yes, however many the degrees from a seed to the huge tree, 
the degrees in the abilities lodged in human nature are more numerous. They 
range from a minute particle to the sun. For these abilities and potentialities 
to develop, action is required, a transaction is necessary. In such a transac-
tion the action of the mechanism of progress is triggered through striving. 
And striving occurs due to the existence of evil spirits and harmful things. 
Otherwise man’s station would have been constant like that of the angels; 
there  would  have  been  no  classes  in  humankind,  which  resembles  thou-
sands of species. It is contrary to wisdom and justice to abandon a thousand 
instances of good so as to avoid one minor evil.

For sure the majority of people embrace misguidance due to Satan, but 
importance and value look mostly to quality; they look to quantity little or 
not  at  all.  If  someone  has  a  thousand  and  ten  seeds  which  he  buries,  and 
under the earth the seeds undergo a chemical reaction as a result of which 
ten become trees and a thousand rot, the profit the man receives from the 
ten seeds which have become trees certainly eliminates the loss he suffers 

THIRTEENTH FLASH 

107

from the thousand rotted ones. In exactly the same way, through the struggle 
against the soul and Satan, the profit, honour, enlightenment, and value for 
humankind gained by ten perfect men, who are like stars, certainly reduce 
to nothing the harm caused to mankind through the people of misguidance 
embracing unbelief, who are so base as to be considered vermin. Since this 
is  so,  divine  mercy,  wisdom,  and  justice  have  permitted  the  existence  of 
Satan, and allowed him to molest men.

O people of belief! Your armour against this awesome enemy is the fear 
of Allah fashioned on the workbench of the Qur’an, and your shield is the 
Noble  Messenger’s  ( UWBP )  practices,  and  your  weapon,  seeking  refuge 
with Allah from Satan, and seeking forgiveness, and taking refuge in divine 
protection.

THIRD INDICATION

Q u e s t i o n :  The very great complaints and massing of forces against the 
people of misguidance in the All-Wise Qur’an does not appear to the reason 
to be conformable with its equitable and apt eloquence and the congruence 
and moderation of its style. It is quite simply as though it is mustering armies 
against  a  single  man.  It  threatens  him  on  account  of  one  minor  action  as 
though he had committed thousands of crimes. It affords him a position and 
complains about him as though he were an aggressive partner, despite his 
being bankrupt and having no share of the property. What is the reason for 
this and the wisdom in it?

The Answer: The reason for it is this: because the evil spirits and those 
who follow them take the path of misguidance, they can cause great destruc-

cause much harm with a small deed.

For  example,  by  some  small  action  or  neglecting  a  small  duty,  a  man

employed on it and all the fruits of their labour being lost and going for noth-

who are connected with the ship. And he inflicts a terrible punishment on 
him, taking into account not his insignificant action but its dreadful results, 
not in his own name but in that of the rights of his subjects.

In exactly the same way, through their apparently insignificant mistakes 
and sins, the people of misguidance, Satan’s party, who are on the ship of the 
earth together with the people of guidance, transgress against the rights of

numerous creatures and nullify the results of their elevated duties. The Mon-
arch  of  Pre-Eternity  and  Post-Eternity’s  awesome  threats  and  complaints 
about them, therefore, and His mobilization of forces against them are pure 
wisdom within perfect eloquence, and are most apt and appropriate. It is in 
conformity with the requirements of the situation, which is the definition of 
eloquence and its basis. 1 And it is free of exaggeration, which is wasteful-
ness in words.

It is clear that the person will be wretched who does not take refuge in a 
secure stronghold in the face of terrible enemies who wreak much destruc-
tion  with  little  action.  O  people  of  belief!  Such  a  heavenly  stronghold  of 
steel is the Qur’an. Enter it and be saved!

FOURTH INDICATION

Investigative  scholars  and  the  people  of  illumination  have  agreed  that 
non-existence is pure evil and existence, pure good. Yes, in the great major-
ity of cases, good, virtues, and perfections are based on existence and are 
related to it. Even if they are superficially negative and hint of non-existence, 
their basis is in existence and pertains to it. While the basis and leaven of 
all ugliness, such as misguidance, evil, calamities, and sins, is non-existence 
and  denial.  Their  badness  and  ugliness  arise  from  non-existence.  Even  if 
they appear superficially to be positive and pertaining to existence, essen-
tially they are non-existence and denial.

Also, observedly, the existence of something like a building is realized 
through the existence of all its parts. While its destruction, non-existence, 
and  annihilation  occur  through  the  non-being  of  one  of  its  main  parts. 
Furthermore, existence requires an existent cause, it is based on a cause 
that has an actual reality. Whereas non-existence may be based on things 
which  pertain  to  non-existence.  Such  things  may  be  the  cause  of  some-
thing non-existent.

In consequence of this rule, despite the awesome destruction in the uni-
verse of devils from among jinn and men, and the varieties of unbelief, mis-
guidance,  evil,  and  destruction  they  perpetrate,  they  neither  interfere  one 
iota in creation, nor do they have any share in divine sovereignty. Moreover, 
they do not perform those acts through any power or ability; they perpetrate 
many of the things they do through neglect and abstaining from action. They 
commit  evils  by  not  allowing  good  to  be  done,  that  is,  they  become  evil.

For since bad and evil are a sort of destruction, their causes do not have to be 
an existent power and active creativity. Indeed, vast destruction is wrought 
due to one non-existent matter or one condition being nullified.

It was because the Zoroastrians did not develop this mystery that they 
believed there was a creator of good in the universe, called Yazdan, and a 
creator of evil, called Ahriman. 1 However, the imaginary god of evil they 
called Ahriman was Satan, who causes evil through the power of choice and 
the power to act, which has no ability to create.

O people of belief! Your most effective weapon and equipment for repairs 
in the face of this awesome destruction of Satan is seeking forgiveness from 
Allah, and declaring “ I seek refuge with Allah, ” to have recourse to Him. 
And your stronghold is the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices.

FIFTH INDICATION

In  the  revealed  scriptures  Almighty  Allah  points  out  to  mankind  great 
rewards like Paradise and terrible punishments like Hell, and He gives guid-
ance, many admonishments and reminders, and threats and encouragement. 
But despite there being so many means guiding the people of belief to the 
straight path, they are defeated in the face of the feeble, unrewarding, repel-
lent stratagems of Satan’s party. At one time this caused me much thought. 
How is it, I wondered, that although they believe, they disregard Almighty 
Allah’s severe threats? Why isn’t their belief enough? They are carried away 
by Satan’s baseless wiles and rebel against Allah, although according to the 
verse, ( 4:76 ) V U T S R  Some of my own friends, even, although 
they sincerely affirmed the teachings about reality they had heard from me 
a hundred times and had an excessively good opinion of me and relations 
with me, they were carried away by the trite and hypocritical compliments 
of a corrupt person, and took up a position in favour of him and against me. 
“ Glory be to Allah!, ” I exclaimed, “ How can a person fall so low? What a 
deceitful man he was. ” I slandered him and committed a sin.

Later, the truth explained in the previous Indications became clear and 
illuminated  many  obscure  points.  Thanks  be  to  Allah,  through  its  light  I 
understood  both  that  the  All-Wise  Qur’an’s  powerful  encouragement  and 
assurances  are  completely  in  place,  and  that  the  people  of  belief  being 
deceived  by  Satanic  machinations  is  not  due  to  a  lack  of  belief  or  weak-
ness of faith. I understood too that someone who commits grievous sins is

friend of mine sacrificing a hundred lessons in reality to win the attentions of 
such a scoundrel was not despicable abasement and degeneration; I thanked 
Almighty Allah and was saved from the abyss. For as I said before, Satan

reality lacks existence. Moreover, man’s soul always listens to Satan; and 
his powers of anger and animal appetites are like both receivers and trans-

One of Satan’s most dangerous stratagems is this: he makes certain sen-
sitive and ingenuous people confuse imagining unbelief with affirming it. 
He shows the imagining of misguidance to be the affirmation of it. He also 
conjures up in their imaginations ugly thoughts about holy individuals and 
sacred things. He shows also things which are essentially possible together 
with those that are reasonably possible, thus making those things appear to 
be  doubts  opposed  to  the  certainty  of  belief.  Then  the  wretched  sensitive 
man  supposes  that  he  has  fallen  into  misguidance  and  unbelief,  and  that 
his certainty of belief has been lost; he falls into despair and becomes the 
plaything of Satan. Satan works both his despair, and that weak vein of his, 
and his confusion, so that he either goes mad, or exclaiming: “ All is lost, ” 
embraces misguidance. We have explained in some parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r

just how lacking in substance are these diabolical stratagems, so here shall 
discuss them only briefly, as follows:

Just  as  a  snake’s  image  in  a  mirror  cannot  bite,  nor  the  similitude  of 
fire  burn,  or  the  reflection  of  filth  soil;  so  the  reflections  of  unbelief  and 
association of partners with Allah cannot corrupt belief nor the shadows of 
misguidance, or the imaginings of ugly abuse and words in the mirror of the 
imagination or of thought change faith, or damage respectful courtesy. For 
the well-known rule goes, “ To imagine abuse is not abuse, to imagine unbe-
lief is not unbelief, and to conceive of misguidance is not misguidance. ”

ّىِ(cid:98)اَ

As  for  the  question  of  doubts  in  belief,  possibilities  that  are  essen-
tially possible do not belie the certainty of belief and do not harm it. One 
of  the  established  rules  of  the  science  of  the  principles  of  religion  is:

ّنِا  1  For  example,  we  are  certain

that  Barla  Lake  is  in  its  place  consisting  of  water.  It  is,  however,  essen-
tially  possible  that  this  very  moment  the  lake  sank  into  the  ground.  It  is 
within the bounds of possibility that it might sink. But since there is noth-
ing  to  indicate  such  a  possibility,  it  is  not  a  reasonable  possibility  and 
cause  doubt.  For  another  established  rule  of  the  principles  of  religion  is: 
ْ(cid:203)ِ(cid:170) َةَرْ(cid:93)ِ(cid:150)  َ(cid:202) That is, an essential possibility unsup-

Hence, the unfortunate man exposed to those Satanic whisperings sup-
poses that due to essential possibilities he has lost his certain belief in the 
truths of faith. For example, numerous essential possibilites about the human 
aspects of the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) may 
occur to him which cause no harm to his firm belief, but he imagines that 
they have and so suffers harm.

Also,  sometimes  Satan  suggests  bad  things  about  Almighty  Allah  in 
the form of whisperings in the heart. The man trembles, supposing that his 
heart is corrupted so that it says such things. But his fear and trembling 
and lack of consent shows that those words did not come from his heart; 
they rather came from Satanic whisperings, and were imparted and caused 
to be imagined by Satan.

Also, among man’s subtle faculties are one or two that I have been una-
ble to specify; they do not heed the will and power of choice and probably

should not be held responsible. Sometimes they govern, do not listen to the 
truth, and incline towards wrong. Then Satan whispers to the man: “ You’re 
not capable of attaining to reality and belief, so you involuntarily attempt 
what is futile and fruitless. That means your fate has condemned you to per-
dition. ” The wretched man falls into despair and is ruined.

The believer’s stronghold in the face of the former stratagems of Satan 
are the truths of belief and incontestable matters of the Qur’an, the limits of 
which have been defined by the principles of the purified exacting scholars. 
And in the face of the latter stratagems, the believer’s stronghold is to seek 
refuge with Allah and to attach no importance to them. For the more impor-
tance is given them, the more it attracts attention to them, and they grow 
and swell. The believer’s antidote and remedy for such spiritual wounds is 
adhering to the practices of the Prophet ( UWBP ). 

SEVENTH INDICATION

Q u e s t i o n :  The Mu‘tazilite authorities considered the creation of evil to 
be evil, and therefore did not attribute the creation of unbelief and misguid-
ance to Allah, as if by so doing they were exonerating Him. They misguid-
edly said: “ Man creates his own actions. ” 1 They also said: “ A believer who 
commits a grievous sin loses his belief, 2 for believing in Allah and affirming 
Hell is incompatible with such acts. Out of fear at a minor prison sentence 
in this world, a man restrains himself from acting contrarily to the law, so if 
he commits serious sins, which infers disregard of divine wrath, it certainly 
points to his lack of belief. ”

The Answer to the first part of the question: as is elucidated in the 
treatise on divine determining, 3 the creation of evil is not evil; it is the incli-
nation to do evil that is evil. For creation and bringing into being look to all 
the results. Since the existence of one evil is preliminary to numerous good 
results,  by  virtue  of  those  results,  the  creation  of  the  evil  becomes  good, 
and is as though good. For example, fire has a hundred good results, but if 
because  they  misuse  their  wills  people  make  the  fire  evil  for  themselves, 
they cannot say that the creation of fire is evil. In the same way, the creation 
of devils has numerous wise results such as human progress; so if a person

is defeated by Satan due to his misuse of his will and misguided inclinations, 
he cannot say that the creation of Satan is evil. For he did evil to himself 
because he was himself disposed to it.

Yes,  since  the  tendency  is  a  particular  relation,  it  has  a  particular  evil 
result and becomes evil. But since creation looks to all the results, the crea-
tion of evil is not evil; it is good. The Mu‘tazilites did not understand this 
mystery, so they said: “ The creation of evil is evil, and the creation of bad, 
bad. ” And to exonerate Almighty Allah of all fault, they did not ascribe the 
creation of evil to Him; they fell into misguidance, wrongly interpreting the 
pillar of belief ِهّ

ِرَ(cid:130)َو ِهِرْ(cid:193)َ(cid:114) ِرَدَ(cid:163)ْ(cid:170)اِ(cid:92)َو 1

The  Answer  to  the  second  part  of  the  question  “ How  can  someone 
who  commits  grievous  sins  remain  a  believer? ”:  Firstly,  their  error  may 
be understood clearly from the previous Indications, so there is no need to 
repeat  it.  Secondly,  the  man’s  evil-commanding  soul  prefers  an  ounce  of 
immediate, present pleasure to a ton of postponed, hidden pleasure; simi-
larly, he shrinks at the fear of an immediate slap more than at a year’s tor-
ment  in  the  future.  Furthermore,  if  the  emotions  dominate  a  person,  they 
do not heed the reason and mind. Desires and delusions govern in him, and 
he prefers the slightest, most trivial present pleasure to huge reward in the 
future,  and  he  shrinks  from  some  minor  present  distress  more  than  from 
some terrible postponed torment. For desire, illusions, and emotions do not 
see the future, indeed, they deny it. And if the soul assists them, the heart, 
which  is  the  seat  of  belief,  and  the  mind,  fall  silent  and  are  defeated.  In 
which case, committing grievous sins does not arise from lack of belief, but 
from the defeat of the heart and mind by the predominant emotions, desires, 
and illusions.

Moreover, as is understood from the previous Indications, since the way 
the passions and evil work is through destruction, they are extremely easy. 
Satans from among jinn and men quickly drive people down that road. It 
is an astonishing situation, for according to a Hadith, a light to the extent 
of a fly’s wing from the World of Eternity  2 is comparable to the pleasure 
and bounties a person receives in his entire life in this world, 3 yet follow-
ing  Satan,  certain  unfortunates  prefer  the  pleasures  of  this  fleeting  world,

which are a mere fly’s wing in comparison with the pleasures of that eternal 
world, which are worth all this world.

It is for these reasons that the All-Wise Qur’an repeatedly and insistently, 
and with encouragement and threats, restrains believers from sin and urges 
them to do good.

One time this severe guidance of the All-Wise Qur’an gave me the idea 
that these continual warnings and reminders imply that believers are incon-
stant and faulty. They suggest a situation inconsistent with man’s integrity.  
For although a single order from his superior is sufficient to exact an offi-
cial’s obedience, if the superior repeats the same order ten times, the official 
will  be  seriously  offended.  He  will  say:  “ You  are  insulting  me.  I  am  not 
disloyal. ” However, the All-Wise Qur’an insistently repeats the same com-
mand to the most sincere believers.

At the time I was puzzling over this idea, I had two or three loyal friends. 
I  frequently  used  to  warn  and  remind  them  lest  they  be  deceived  by  the 
machinations of satanic humans. They were not offended at me, nor said I 
was insulting them. However I used to tell myself that I was offending them 
with these continual admonitions and that I was accusing them of disloyalty 
and inconstancy. Then suddenly the truth explained and proved in the above 
Indications became clear. I understood that the All-Wise Qur’an’s insistent 
repetitions were apt and exactly as required by the situation, and wise and 
not  excessive  or  accusing;  they  were  pure  wisdom  and  pure  eloquence.  I 
understood too the reason those loyal friends of mine were not offended. A 
summary of the truth is this: 

Since evil spirits provoke people in respect of destruction, they commit 
much evil with few actions. People who take the path of truth and guidance, 
therefore, are in need of much caution and great care and repeated warnings 
and various assistance. For this reason Almighty Allah offers assistance to 
the people of belief through His thousand and one names by way of those 
repetitions,  and  stretches  out  thousands  of  compassionate  hands  to  help 
them. He does not slight their integrity, but upholds it. He does not belittle 
man, but shows Satan’s evil to be great.

O people of truth and people of guidance! The way to be saved from the 
above-mentioned wiles of satanic jinn and men is this: make your headquar-
ters the school of the people of the truth, the Sunnis; enter the stronghold of 
the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition’s incontestable matters; and take the 
Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices as your guide; find safety and salvation!

Q u e s t i o n :  You have proved in the above Indications that the way of mis-
guidance  is  easy,  and  is  destruction  and  aggression,  so  that  many  take  it. 
Whereas in other parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  you have proved decisively that 
the way of unbelief and misguidance is so fraught with difficulties and prob-
lems that no one should take it; that it is not possible to follow it. And you 
have  shown  that  the  path  of  belief  and  guidance  is  so  easy  and  clear  that 
everyone should take it.

The Answer: There are two sorts of unbelief and misguidance. One per-
tains to actions and secondary matters, and is also denial and rejection of the 
matters of belief. This kind is misguidance is easy. It is a non-acceptance of 
the truth, an abdication, non-existence, and the absence of acceptance. In the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , this sort has been shown to be easy.

As for the second sort, it pertains not to actions and secondary matters, 
but is a judgement of the mind and pertains to belief. It does not only deny 
belief, but opens up a way that is the opposite of it. It is the acceptance of 
what is false and invalid, the proof of the reverse of truth. This is not only 
the denial and refutation of belief, it is its opposite. It is not non-acceptance 
so  that  it  should  be  easy,  but  the  acceptance  of  non-being,  and  can  only 
be  accepted  through  proving  non-existence.  In  accordance  with  the  rule 
ُتَ(cid:93)ـْ(cid:103)ُ(cid:192)  َ(cid:202) ُمَدَ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)َا 1 it is certainly not easy to prove it. 

Thus, the unbelief and misguidance shown in other parts of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  to be so difficult and problematic as to be impossible is this sort. Any-
one with even a grain of intelligence would not take this way. Moreover, as 
is demonstrated, it imparts such grievous pains and suffocating darkness that 
anyone reasonable to the tiniest degree would not follow it. 

I f   i t   i s   a s k e d :  Why do most people take it, seeing that it is so grievous, 

dark, and difficult?

The  Answer: They have fallen into it and cannot extricate themselves. 
And because the animal and vegetable powers in man do not see the conse-
quences and do not think of them, and come to dominate man’s subtle facul-
ties, such people do not want to extricate themselves, so console themselves 
with immediate, temporary pleasure. 

Q u e s t i o n :  Since misguidance gives rise to such dreadful suffering and 
fear, the unbeliever should not be able to live, let alone receiving pleasure

from life. He should be crushed by the pain and be absolutely terrified. For 
although by reason of his humanity he desires innumerable things and loves 
life,  because  of  his  unbelief,  he  constantly  sees  death  confronting  him  as 
eternal extinction and everlasting separation, and the passing of beings and 
deaths of his friends and those he loves as annihilation and eternal parting, 
so how can such a man live? How can he receive pleasure from life?

The  Answer: He deceives himself through an extraordinary sophistry of 
Satan, and lives. He supposes he receives a superficial pleasure. We shall 
allude to the true nature of this with a well-known comparison.

It is related that they said to the ostrich: “ You’ve got wings, so fly! ” But 
it folded its wings and said: “ I’m a camel, ” and didn’t fly. So it fell into the 
hunter’s trap, and not wanting the hunter to see it, stuck its head in the sand. 
However, it left its huge body exposed, as prey for the hunter. They later 
said to it: “ You say you’re a camel, so you should carry loads. ” Whereupon 
it opened its wings and declared: “ I’m a bird, ” and so avoided being a beast 
of burden. But then it had neither protector nor food, and was pursued by 
the hunters.

In  exactly  the  same  way,  the  unbeliever  gave  up  absolute  disbelief  in 
the  face  of  the  Qur’an’s  heavenly  proclamations  and  fell  into  scepticism. 
If  he  is  asked:  “ You  think  death  is  eternal  extinction.  How  can  a  person 
live when he perpetually sees before him the gallows on which he is to be 
hanged? How can he be happy? ” Thanks to the portion he has received of 
the Qur’an’s universal mercy and all-encompassing light, the man replies: 
“ Death doesn’t mean going to nothingness; perhaps there is life after death. ” 
Or else he plunges his head in the sand of heedlessness like the ostrich so 
that the appointed hour will not spot him and the grave will not watch him 
and the transience of things will not let fly their arrows at him!

I n   S h o r t : When like the ostrich the unbeliever looks on death and decline 
as  extinction,  his  scepticism  makes  him  consider  possible  the  certain  tid-
ings of the Qur’an and revealed scriptures concerning belief in the hereafter 
afford him a possibility. He grasps the possibility and does not suffer that 
ghastly pain. If he is then told: “ Since one will go to an everlasting realm, to 
have a good life there, here one has to put up with the difficulties of perform-
ing the religious obligations, ” his scepticism leads him to reply: “ Perhaps 
there  is  no  such  world,  so  why  should  I  work  for  something  that  doesn’t 
exist? ” That is to say, he is saved from the pain of eternal nothingness by 
the  possibility  of  immortality  afforded  by  that  decree  of  the  Qur’an,  and 
clinging onto the possibility of unbelief, he is saved from the hardship of

the religious obligations by the possibility of non-existence afforded by his 
scepticism. That is to say, from this point of view, he supposes he receives 
more  pleasure  from  this  life  than  the  believers,  for  due  to  the  possibility 
afforded  by  unbelief  he  is  saved  from  the  hardship  of  the  religious  obli-
gations,  and  due  to  the  possibility  afforded  by  belief,  he  does  not  expose 
himself  to  everlasting  pains.  However,  this  satanic  sophistry  is  extremely 
superficial, temporary, and without benefit.

Thus,  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  produces  a  sort  of  manifestation  of  mercy 
for the unbelievers too that to an extent saves their lives in this world from 
being Hell; it induces doubt in them, so they live through doubt. Otherwise, 
by recalling the Hell of the hereafter they would have suffered the torments 
of a sort of Hell in this world too, and they would have been compelled to 
commit suicide.

O people of belief! Fully confident in your belief enter under the protec-
tion of the Qur’an, which will save you from eternal extinction and the hells 
of  this  world  and  the  hereafter.  Submissively  and  appreciatively  remain 
within the bounds of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices, and so be saved from 
both misery in this world and torment in the next!

NINTH INDICATION

Q u e s t i o n :  Why is it that the people of guidance, foremost the prophets 
with the Glory of the World (Upon whom be blessings and peace) at their 
head, who are Allah’s party, – why is it that they are so often defeated by 
the  people  of  misguidance,  who  are  Satan’s  party,  despite  the  Glory  of 
the World ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) being at their head and 
their receiving so much divine mercy and assistance and so many favours? 
What was the reason for the dissemblers of Medina insisting on misguid-
ance  and  their  not  embracing  guidance,  despite  being  close  to  the  bril-
liant sun-like prophethood and messengerhood of the Seal of the Prophets 
( UWBP )  and  the  Qur’anic  truths,  which  are  more  captivating  than  the 
universal laws of attraction?

The Answer: To solve the two parts of this awesome question, a pro-

found principle must be explained. It is like this: 

The All-Glorious Creator of the universe has two sort of names, those 
pertaining to His glory and those pertaining to His beauty. Since the names 
require  to  demonstrate  their  decrees  through  different  manifestations,  the 
Glorious  Creator  blended  together  opposites  in  the  universe.  Bringing 
them face to face, he gave them aggressive and defensive positions, in the 
form of a wise and beneficial contest. Making the opposites transgress one

another’s bounds, He brought conflict and change into being, and made the 
universe subject to the law of change and transformation and the principles 
of progress and advancement. In humankind, the comprehensive fruit of the 
tree of creation, he gave the law of contest an even stranger form, and open-
ing the door to striving, which would be the means to all human progress, He 
gave  Satan’s  party  certain  faculties  with  which  to  challenge  Allah’s  party.
It is because of this subtle mystery that the prophets were often defeated 
by  the  people  of  misguidance.  And  the  people  of  misguidance,  who  are 
extremely weak and impotent, temporarily triumph over the people of truth, 
who in reality are extremely strong, and struggle against them. The wisdom 
in this strange opposition is as follows:

Misguidance and unbelief comprise both non-existence and omission, so 
that they are extremely easy and do not require action. They also give rise to 
destruction, which is also easy, and need little action. They are also a source 
of aggression, which may cause much harm to many with little action, and 
by way of intimidating others and satisfying the soul’s desire for power, may 
secure rank and position for a person. There is also freedom and satisfaction 
in  misguidance  and  unbelief,  which  gratifies  man’s  vegetable  and  animal 
powers, which are blind to consequences and obsessed by present pleasure, 
and  induces  such  subtle  faculties  as  the  heart  and  reason  to  give  up  their 
humane and far-sighted duties.

However, the sacred way of foremost the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ), the Beloved of the Sustainer of All the Worlds, and 
of the people of prophethood and the people of guidance, both pertains to 
existence, and is firmly established, and is constructive, and is based on the 
important principles of action, moderation, prudence and foresight, worship, 
and  smashing  the  domination  and  independence  of  the  evil-commanding 
soul.  1 It is because of this that the dissemblers of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) 
time  in  Medina  closed  their  eyes  to  that  refulgent  sun  like  bats,  and  sur-
rendering themselves to a satanic force of repulsion in the face of that huge 
attraction, remained in misguidance.

I f  i t   i s  S a i d   :  The Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace )

army were angels; 1 and he watered a whole army with one handful of water; 
2 and provided a feast for a thousand men with four handfuls of wheat and 
the meat of one kid; 3 and caused the unbelievers’ army to flee by throwing 
a handful of dust at them, which entered all their eyes;  4 so how was that 
dominical commander who performed a thousand miracles similar to these, 
defeated at the end of Uhud 5 and at the beginning of Hunayn? 6

The  Answer: Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ) was sent to mankind as an exemplary guide and leader so that men 
might learn from him the rules of social and personal life, become accus-
tomed  to  obeying  the  laws  of  the  All-Wise  One  of  Perfection,  and  act  in 
conformity  with  the  principles  of  His  wisdom.  If  the  Messenger  ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) had always relied on wonders and miracles, 
he could not have been absolute guide and leader.

He  therefore  displayed  miracles  from  time  to  time,  in  answer  to  need, 
solely to make them affirm his claim to prophethood and to nullify the unbe-
lievers’ denial. At other times he obeyed the divine commands more than 
anyone, and more than everyone acted in conformity with the divine laws 
in creation, established through dominical wisdom and will, and submitted 
to them. He used to wear armour when confronting the enemy, 7 and would 
order his troops to enter their trenches. 8 He received wounds and suffered 
hardship.  9  In  this  way  he  obeyed  and  observed  to  the  letter  the  laws  of 
divine wisdom and the Greater Shari‘a of Creation.

THE FLASHES

materialist philosophy in particular have been hesitant in these self-evident 
matters, we shall say one or two things in the face of this stratagem of Satan. 
They are as follows:

There are self-evidently corporeal evil spirits who perform Satan’s func-
tions. It is also certain to the same degree that there are evil spirits without 
bodies from the jinns. If they were clothed in physical bodies, they would 
be the same as those evil human beings. Also, if those evil spirits in human 
form were able to leave aside their bodies, they would be those jinn-satans. 
Indeed, in consequence of this terrible relationship one deviant school pro-
nounced:  “ After  they  have  died,  excessively  evil  spirits  in  human  form 
become devils. ”

It  is  well-known  that  when  something  of  high  quality  is  corrupted  it 
becomes  more  corrupted  than  something  of  less  quality.  For  example, 
if  yoghurt  and  milk  go  bad  they  may  still  be  eaten,  but  if  oil  goes  bad  it 
becomes inedible, and poisonous even. Similarly, if the most noble, indeed 
the highest of creatures, man, is corrupted, he becomes more corrupt than a 
depraved animal. Like vermin who enjoy the stink of putrifying matter and 
snakes who take pleasure at biting and poisoning, they take pride and pleas-
ure at the evils and wicked immorality of the swamp of misguidance, being 
gratified at the harms and crimes of the darkness of evil-doing; quite simply 
they take on the nature of Satan. Yes, a decisive indication of the existence 
of devils from the jinn, is the existence of human satans.

S e c o n d l y :  All the hundreds of decisive evidences proving the existence 
of angels and spirit beings in the Twenty-Ninth Word prove also the exist-
ence of evil spirits. We refer this aspect to that Word.

T h i r d l y :  The existence of the angels, the representatives and supervisors 
of the laws of the good matters in the universe, is established and agreed 
upon by all the religions. So too, the existence of evil and satanic spirits, 
who  are  the  representatives  and  ushers  of  evil  matters  and  the  means  of 
the laws of such matters, is required by wisdom and reality, and is certain. 
Indeed, in evil matters, a conscious screen is more necessary. For as is stated 
at the beginning of the Twenty-Second Word, since everyone cannot see the 
true good of everything, the All-Glorious Creator has made apparent inter-
mediaries a screen to apparent evils and defects, so that objections should 
not  be  levelled  at  Him,  nor  His  mercy  be  accused,  nor  his  wisdom  criti-
cized or unjustly complained about, and so that objections, criticisms, and 
complaints should be directed at the screen, and not turned to the Generous 
Creator, the Absolutely Wise One. Just as He made illness a screen to the 

THIRTEENTH FLASH 

121

appointed hour of death in order to save Azra’il from the complaints 1 of His 
servants who die, so too He made Azra’il a screen to the seizing of the spirits 
of the dying so that the complaints at that situation, which is fancied to be 
lacking in compassion, should not be directed at Almighty Allah. And even 
more certainly, dominical wisdom demanded the existence of Satan, so that 
objections and criticisms in the face of evils and bad things should not be 
directed at the All-Glorious Creator.

F o u r t h l y :  Just as man is a small world, the microcosm, so is the world 
a large human being, the macroanthropos. Small man is an index and sum-
mary of the macroanthropos. The large originals of the samples in man will 
necessarily be found in the macroanthropos. For example, the existence of 
man’s faculty of memory is a certain indication of the existence of the Pre-
served Tablet in the world. So too everyone has experienced in himself the 
inner faculty situated in a corner of the heart which is the means to diaboli-
cal suggestions 2 and temptations and is a satanic tongue that speaks at the 
promptings  of  the  surmising  faculty  and  the  corrupted  power  of  imagina-
tion, which becomes like a small Satan and acts contrary to its owner’s will 
and opposed to his desires – these are certain evidences of the existence of 
great satans in the world. And since the inner faculty which is the means of 
diabolical suggestions and the power of imagination are an ear and a tongue, 
they infer the existence of an external evil individual who blows on the one 
and makes the other speak.

ELEVENTH INDICATION

The  All-Wise  Qur’an  states  in  miraculous  fashion  that  the  universe 
grows angry at the evil of the people of misguidance, and the universal ele-

storm visited on Noah’s people and the assaults of the heavens and earth, 
the anger of the element air at the denial of the ‘Ad and Thamud peoples, 
and  the  fury  of  the  sea  and  element  water  at  the  people  of  Pharaoh,  and

and people of misguidance; in miraculous fashion it restrains the people of 
misguidance and rebellion.

Q u e s t i o n :  Why do the unimportant actions and personal sins of unimpor-

tant men attract the anger of the universe in this way?

The  Answer:  As  proved  in  other  parts  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   and  in  the 
previous Indications, unbelief and misguidance are terrible aggression and 
crimes that concern all beings. For one of the most important results of the 
universe’s creation is man’s worship and his responding to divine domini-
cality  with  belief  and  submission.  However,  due  to  the  denial  which  is  a 
part of disbelief, the people of unbelief and misguidance reject that supreme 
result, which is the ultimate reason for the continued existence of beings, and 
they therefore perpetrate a sort of transgression against the beings’ rights. 
Moreover, since they deny the manifestations of the divine names which are 
apparent in the mirrors of beings and exalt their value, they both insult those 
sacred names, and by degrading the value of all beings, greatly depreciate 
them. Also, although beings are dominical officials charged with elevated 
duties,  by  their  unbelief,  the  people  of  misguidance  cast  them  down,  and 
showing them to be lifeless, transitory, meaningless creatures, they in a way 
violate the rights of all of them.

Thus,  since  the  varieties  of  misguidance  impair  to  a  greater  or  lesser 
extent the dominical wisdom in the universe’s creation and the divine pur-
poses in the world’s continued existence, the universe becomes angry at the 
people of rebellion and misguidance, as do all beings and creatures.

O wretched man, whose being is small but guilt great and sin grievous! If 
you want to be delivered from the wrath of the universe, the rage of beings, 
and the aversion of creatures, here is the means: enter the sacred bounds of 
the All-Wise Qur’an and follow the practices of Allah’s Noble Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), who was the herald of the Qur’an. So 
put yourself within its fold and adhere to the practices!

TWELFTH INDICATION

First Question

This consists of four questions and answers.
F i r s t    Q u e s t i o n :  How can infinite torment in an endless Hell in return for 

limited sins in a limited life be justice?

The   Answer:  It  was  understood  clearly  in  the  above  Indications,  and 
particularly  in  the  Eleventh,  that  unbelief  and  misguidance  constitute  an 
infinite crime and are transgression against innumerable rights.

Second Question

THIRTEENTH FLASH 

123

S e c o n d  

 Q u e s t i o n :   It  is  said  in  the  Shari‘a  that  Hell  is  punishment  for 

actions, but Paradise is a divine favour. 1 What is the reason for this?

The  Answer: It is clearly shown in the above Indications that with his 
faculty  of  will  and  trifling  wishes,  man  causes  awesome  destruction  and 
evils  by  giving  form  and  reality  to  something  non-existent  or  theoretical. 
Similarly, since his soul and appetites always incline towards evil and harm, 
he is responsible for the evils that occur as a result of his trivial wishes. For 
his soul wanted them and his desires gave rise to them. And since evil per-
tains to non-existence, the servant is the agent and Almighty Allah creates 
it.  Being  responsible  for  the  infinite  crime,  he  certainly  deserves  infinite 
punishment.

However, since good deeds and actions pertain to existence, man’s will 
and  wishes  cannot  be  the  direct  cause  of  their  existence.  Man  cannot  be 
the true agent in such acts. Also, his evil-commanding soul does not tend 
towards  good  deeds;  it  is  divine  mercy  that  requires  them  and  dominical 
power that creates them. Man can only lay claim to them through belief, a 
wish, or an intention. And having claimed them, such good works consist 
of thanks for the infinite divine bounties received, such as the gifts of belief 
and existence. Such thanks looks to past bounties, while Paradise is a favour 
of the Most Merciful which since it as been promised by Him will be given. 
Apparently it is a reward, but in reality it is a favour.

That is to say, in evils the soul is the cause and deserves the punishment, 
while in good deeds, both the cause and the occasion are from Allah. Man 
can  only  lay  claim  to  them  through  belief.  He  may  not  say:  “ I  want  the 
reward, ” but he may say: “ I hope for divine favour. ”

Third Question

T h i r d   Q u e s t i o n :  It is understood from the above explanations that since 
evils multiply through contagion and aggression, a single evil deed should 
be recorded as a thousand; and since good deeds pertain to existence, they 
do not multiply nor do they occur through the servant’s creative act or the 
desires of his soul; they therefore should not be recorded at all or as only 
one. So why are evil deeds recorded as one and good deeds as ten, and some-
times as thousands? 2

The  Answer:  In  this  way  Almighty  Allah  demonstrates  His  perfect 

mercy and the beauty of His compassionateness.

1.    See,  Qur’an,  10:58.  See  also,  B u k h ā r ī ,  Riqāq,  18;  Marḍā,  19;  M u s l i m ,  Ṣifāt  al-

Fourth Question

THE FLASHES

F o u r t h  

 Q u e s t i o n :   The  successes  the  people  of  misguidance  have 
achieved and the power they display and their victories over the people of 
guidance show that they rely on some power and truth. This means either 
that the people of guidance possess some weakness, or that the misguided 
possess some truth?

The  Answer: Allah forbid, neither do they possess any truth, nor do the 
people of truth have any weakness. But regretably some of the ordinary peo-
ple  who  are  short-sighted  and  unreasoning  become  doubtful  and  hesitant, 
and harm comes to their belief. For they say: If the people of truth had pos-
sessed complete truth and reality, they should not have suffered defeat and 
abasement to this degree. For the truth is powerful. According to the funda-
mental principle ِهْ(cid:193)َ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) ىٰ(cid:171)ْ(cid:151)ُ(cid:192)  َ(cid:202)َو وُ(cid:171)ْ(cid:151)َ(cid:192) ُ
ّقَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا 1 power lies in truth. If the people of 
misguidance had not possessed a true power and point of support, they could 
not have predominated over the people of truth and triumphed to this extent.
The   Answer:  As  is  proven  in  the  above  Indications,  the  defeat  of  the 
people of truth does not arise from lack of power and absence of truth, and 
as is also proven, the people of misguidance’s victory does not spring from 
their power and capacity and their having some source of support. Hence, 
the answer to this question is all the above Indications; here we shall only 
point out a number of the tricks and weapons they employ, as follows: 

I  myself  have  frequently  observed  that  mischief-makers,  who  form 
ten per cent, defeat the righteous, who form ninety per cent. I used to be 
astonished  and  curious.  Investigating,  I  understood  certainly  that  their 
victory results not from power, but from corruption, baseness, destruc-
tion, taking advantage of differences among the people of truth, sowing 
conflict among them, from playing on their weak traits of character and 
grafting them with such traits, and exciting the emotions of the soul and 
personal hatred, and through working the evil capacities in human nature 
which are like mines of corruption, and through hypocritically flattering 
the  soul’s  tyranny  in  the  name  of  fame  and  glory,  and  through  every-
one fearing their unfeeling destruction. By means of diabolical machina-
tions like these, they temporarily triumph over the people of truth. But in 
accordance with the verse, 

( 7:128 ) ª ©
and the rule, “ Truth is exalted and shall not be overcome, ” in addition to its 

1.  See, B u k h ā r ī , Janā’iz, 79: a l - I s l ā m   y a ’ l u   w a   l ā   y u ‘ l ā .

THIRTEENTH FLASH 

125

not yielding any significant benefit for them, their temporary triumph will 
lead to their earning Hell for themselves and Paradise for the people of truth.
Thus, because in misguidance those without power appear powerful and 
the insignificant win fame, they take up a position opposed to the people of 
truth. In this way conceited, fame-seeking, hypocritical people demonstrate 
their power although it has little substance and win a position for themselves 
through intimidating others and causing harm; they are seen and attention is 
drawn to them, and the destruction of which they are the cause, not through 
power  and  ability,  but  through  omission  and  failure  to  act,  is  attributed  to 
them  and  they  become  talked  about.  Just  like  the  person  obsessed  with 
fame who defiled a place of worship so that everyone would talk about him. 
Even if it meant being execrated, so long as he was talked about, his wor-
ship of fame made it appear desirable to him. The case became proverbial.
O wretched man created for the eternal realm and enamoured of this tran-

sient world! Study closely the meaning of the verse,

( 44:29 ) g f e d c
and heed it. Look, what does it say? With its explicit meaning it says: “ When 
the people of misguidance die, the heavens and earth, which are connected 
with man, do not weep over them, that is, they are pleased at their deaths. ” 
While with its implied meaning, it says: “ The heavens and earth weep over 
the bodies of the people of guidance when they die; they do not want them 
to depart. ” For all the universe is connected with the people of belief and its 
beings are happy with them. For by virtue of their belief they know the Crea-
tor of the Universe, so appreciate the universe’s value, and respect and love 
it. They do not nurture implicit enmity and contempt for it like the people 
of misguidance.

O man, think! You are bound to die. If you follow your soul and Satan, 
your neighbours, and even your relations, will be happy at being delivered 
from you. But if saying, “ I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the Accursed, ” 
you follow the Qur’an and the Merciful One’s Beloved ( UWBP ), then in 
accordance with your degree the heavens and earth and all beings will be 
sorry at your parting, and in effect weep. Mourning in elevated fashion and 
giving you a splendid send-off, they will indicate that you will have a good 
welcome in the world of eternity according to your degree, when you enter 
it through the door of the grave. 1

THE FLASHES

First Point

THIRTEENTH INDICATION
This consists of three points.
F i r s t    P o i n t :  One of Satan’s most cunning wiles is to deceive people with 
narrow minds, short views, and constricted hearts concerning the immensity 
of the truths of belief. He says: “ It is said that a single Being directs and 
administers within His dominicality all particles and planets and stars and 
all the other beings and all their states. How can a person believe in such an 
immense and extraordinary matter? How can it be contained in the heart? 
How can the mind accept it? ” He awakens a feeling of denial in respect of 
human impotence.

The  Answer: The way to silence this wile of Satan’s is “ Allah is Most 
Great! ” And its true answer is “ Allah is Most Great! ” Yes, the reason “ Allah 
is Most Great! ” is the most frequently repeated of all the marks of Islam is 
to eliminate this wile. For it is through the light of “ Allah is Most Great! ” 
that man’s impotence and lack of power, weakness and lack of strength, and 
narrow thought see such infinitely vast truths and affirm them. It is through 
the strength of “ Allah is Most Great! ” that man sustains those truths, and 
situates them within the sphere of “ Allah is Most Great! ” And he says to his 
heart which starts to doubt: 

It is self-evident that the universe is administered and directed in most 

orderly fashion. There are two ways in which this may occur:

The First Way: This is possible but it is truly vast and wondrous. Any-
way, such an astonishing work could only come about through wondrous art 
in a wondrous way. So this first way is that the universe exists through the 
dominicality, will, and power of a Single and Eternally Besought One, to 
Whose existence are witnesses to the number of beings, indeed, of minute 
particles.

The Second Way: This is the way of unbelief and associating partners 
with Allah, which is in no way possible and is so difficult as to be impossible 
and is in no respect reasonable. For as is proved decisively in many parts of 
the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   such  as  the  Twentieth  Letter  and  Twenty-Second  Word, 
there would have to be present in all the beings in the universe and even in 
every single particle absolute divinity and all-encompassing knowledge and 
infinite power so that the total order and regularity, the sensitive balance and 
distinction, and the perfect, adorned embroideries of art to be observed in 
beings could come into existence.

I n  

 S h o r t :  If  there  were  no  immense  and  tremendous  dominicality, 
which is completely appropriate and fitting, it would necessitate following 

THIRTEENTH FLASH 

127

a way that is in every respect unreasonable and precluded. Even Satan can-
not propose fleeing from such necessary immensity, and suggest accepting 
impossibility.

Second Point

S e c o n d  P o i n t :  Another of Satan’s cunning wiles is to prevent man admit-
ting his faults in order to close up the way of seeking forgiveness and taking 
refuge with Allah. He also incites the egotism of the human soul, so that the 
soul defends itself like a lawyer, quite simply acquitting itself of all fault.

Yes, a soul that listens to Satan does not want to see its own faults. Even 
if it does see them, it explains them away in a hundred ways. According to 
the saying: ٌةَ(cid:171)(cid:193)ِ(cid:171)ﯬﯦ  ٍبْ(cid:193)َ(cid:150)  ّ
ِر(cid:170)ا ُنْ(cid:193)َ(cid:150)َو  1 when a person looks with 
pleasure on his soul, he does not see its errors. And because he does not see 
them, he does not admit to them or seek forgiveness, or seek refuge with 
Allah from them, so becomes the plaything of Satan. How can the soul be 
relied on when a noble prophet like Joseph ( UWP ) said: 

ِلﯭﯦ  ْنَ(cid:150) اَ(cid:138)ّ

( 12:53 ) - , + * ) ( ' & % $ # "
The  person  who  accuses  his  soul,  sees  its  faults.  And  he  who  admits  his 
faults, seeks forgiveness for them. And he who seeks forgiveness, takes ref-
uge with Allah. And he who takes refuge with Allah, is saved from Satan’s 
evil. Not to see one’s faults is a greater fault than the first fault. And not to 
admit to one’s faults is a serious defect. If one sees the fault, it ceases to be 
a fault. If one admits it, one becomes worthy of forgiveness. 2

Third Point

T h i r d    P o i n t :  A satanic wile corrupting the life of society is this: not to 
see all the virtues of a believer on account of a single bad point. Those unjust 
people  who  heed  this  wile  of  Satan  are  in  this  way  inimical  to  believers. 
However, when Almighty Allah weighs up deeds with absolute justice on 
the supreme scales at the Last Judgement, He will judge in accordance with 
the predominance of good deeds over evils and vice versa. Seeing that the 
causes of evil deeds are numerous and their existence is easy, sometimes He 
veils numerous bad deeds with a single good deed.

That is to say, dealings in this world should be in accordance with divine 
justice. If a person’s good points are greater in regard to quality or quan-
tity  than  his  bad  points,  he  is  deserving  of  love  and  respect.  Indeed,  one 
should forgive numerous bad points on account of a single laudable virtue.

THE FLASHES

However,  due  to  the  vein  of  tyranny  in  his  nature,  at  the  promptings  of 
Satan, the person forgets the hundred virtues of others because of a single 
bad point; he is hostile towards his believing brother and commits sins. Just 
as  a  fly’s  wing  covering  the  eye  conceals  a  mountain,  so  too,  the  veil  of 
hatred  makes  man  conceal  virtues  as  great  as  a  mountain  due  to  a  single 
evil resembling a fly’s wing; he forgets them, is hostile towards his brother 
believer, and becomes a tool of corruption in the life of society.

By means of another wile resembling this one, Satan corrupts the integ-
rity of peoples’ thoughts. He impairs sound judgement concerning the truths 
of belief and damages integrity and correctness of thought. It is like this: 

He desires to destroy hundreds of evidences proving the truths of belief 
with a slight hint refuting them. Whereas it is an established principle that 
“ a single proof is superior to a hundred denials. ” The statement of a witness 
proving a claim is preferable to a hundred people denying it. Consider this 
truth by means of the following comparison: 

There is a palace with a hundred doors all closed. If one of its doors is 
opened, the palace may be entered and all the doors opened. If all the doors 
are open and one or two are closed, it may not be said that the palace cannot 
not be entered.

Thus, the truths of belief are the palace. Each evidence is a key; it proves 
the truths and opens a door. If one of the doors remains closed, the truths of 
belief cannot be abandoned and denied. Satan however, in consequence of 
certain things or by means of heedlessness or ignorance, points out a door 
that  has  remained  closed,  thus  causing  a  person  to  disregard  all  the  posi-
tive evidences. He deceives the person, saying: “ See, this palace cannot be 
entered. Perhaps it isn’t a palace and perhaps there’s nothing inside it. ”

O wretched man afflicted by Satan and his wiles! If you want the life of 
religion and of society and personal life all to be healthy, and if you want 
integrity of thought, a sound view, and a sincere heart, weigh up your actions 
and thoughts on the scales of the incontestable matters of the Qur’an and the 
balance of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices. Always take the Qur’an and 
ّ(cid:195)اِ(cid:92) ُذوُ(cid:150)َا and seek refuge

My Dear and Loyal Brother, Re’fet Bey!
The answer to the question you ask about the Bull and the Fish is to be 
found in several parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . The Third Branch of the Twenty-
Fourth Word contains an explanation of that sort of question, in the light of 
twelve important rules called twelve principles. Those rules all offer crite-
ria for understanding the various interpretations of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) 
Hadiths, and comprise important principles for dispelling doubts that may 
arise about them. Unfortunately at the moment a number of circumstances 
prevent my becoming occupied with scholarly matters that are not inspira-
tion. I therefore cannot reply to your question as you asked it. I have to be 
busy with the inspiration when it comes to my heart, I am compelled to be 
busy with it. I answer some questions because they coincide with the inspi-
rations, so don’t be offended. I cannot answer all questions as they deserve. 
But this time let me reply briefly to your question.

on a bull and a fish, but geography sees it hanging in space and travelling 
like a star. There is neither bull nor fish? ”

The  Answer:  There  is  a  sound  narration  attributed  to  people  like  Ibn 
‘Abbas ( May Allah be pleased with him ) which says that the Noble Mes-
senger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) was asked: “ What does the

ّ(cid:103)(cid:170)ا ىَ(cid:171)(cid:150) and on another occasion he said,  ِتوُ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)ا ىَ(cid:171)(cid:150) Some Hadith scholars 
ِرْوَ
applied this Hadith to superstitions and stories taken from i s r a ’ i l i y a t, related 
since early times. Scholars of the Children of Israel who became Muslims 
especially applied it to stories about the Bull and the Fish they had seen 
in the former scriptures, altering it to mean something strange. For now I 
shall explain very concisely three ‘principles’ and three ‘aspects’ in con-
nection with your question.

First Principle

FIRST PRINCIPLE

When  some  of  the  Israelite  scholars  became  Muslims,  their  former 
knowledge  became  Muslim  along  with  them  and  was  ascribed  to  Islam. 
However, what they knew contained errors which were certainly their errors 
and not Islam’s.

Second Principle

SECOND PRINCIPLE

On  comparisons  and  metaphors  passing  from  the  elite  to  the  common 
people, that is, on their falling from the hands of learning to those of igno-
rance, with the passage of time they are imagined to be literally true. For 
example, when I was a child an eclipse of the moon occurred. I asked my 
mother:  “ Why  has  the  moon  gone  like  that? ”  She  replied:  “ A  snake  has 
swallowed it. ” “ It can still be seen, ” I said. She replied: “ The snakes up 
there are like glass; they show the things inside them! ”

For a long time I recalled this childhood memory. Pondering over it, I 
would  say:  “ How  could  such  a  false  superstition  come  to  be  repeated  by 
serious  people  like  my  mother? ”  Then  when  I  studied  astronomy  I  real-
ized that people like her who repeated it supposed a metaphor to be reality. 
For when the vast circle called the zodiac, which is the circle denoting the 
degrees of the sun, and the circle of the declination of the moon, which is the 
circle depicting its mansions, pass over one another, it gives each of the two 
circles the form of an arc. Using a subtle metaphor the astronomers called 
the two arcs “ the two great serpents. ” They called the points of intersection 
of the two circles “ the head ” and “ the tail. ” When the moon comes to the 
head and the sun to the tail, in the terminology of astronomy, an interposi-
tion of the earth occurs. That is, the globe of the earth passes right between

al-Haythamī, M a j m ū ‘   a l - Z a w ā ’ i d , viii, 131; Ibn al-Jawzī, a l - M u n t a ẓ a m , i, 172.

THE FLASHES

the  two  of  them  and  the  moon  is  eclipsed.  According  to  the  above  meta-
phor, “ the moon has entered the serpent’s mouth. ” Thus, when this elevated 
and scholarly metaphor entered the language of the common people, in the 
course of time it took on the shape of a huge snake swallowing the moon.

Thus, with a sacred and subtle metaphor and meaningful allusion, two 
great angels were called the Bull ( T. Sevr; Ar. Thawr ) and the Fish ( T. Hût; 
A. Ḥ ū t  ), but on entering the common language from the elevated tongue 
of the prophethood, the metaphor was transformed and given a literal mean-
ing, and they took on the form of a truly enormous bull and awesome fish.

Third Principle

THIRD PRINCIPLE

Just as the Qur’an contains allegories and comparisons, and with them 
teaches  profound  matters  to  the  ordinary  people;  so  do  Hadiths  contain 
comparisons  and  allegories;  they  express  profound  truths  by  means  of 
familiar  comparisons.  For  example,  as  we  have  described  in  two  other 
places, one time in the presence of the Prophet ( UWBP ) a deep rumbling 
was heard. He said: “ It is the sound of a rock which has been rolling down-
hill for seventy years and has now hit the bottom of Hell. ” 1 A few minutes 
later someone arrived and reported that a famous seventy-year-old dissem-
bler had died, thus proclaiming the true meaning of the Noble Messenger’s 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) highly eloquent comparison. 

First Aspect

For now, three ‘aspects’ will be explained in reply to your question:
T h e  F i r s t :  Almighty Allah appointed four angels – called the Eagle ( Nasr 
– Aquila ) and the Bull ( Thawr – Taurus ) 2 – as bearers of the divine throne 
and the heavens, to supervise His dominical sovereignty. He also appointed 
two angels as supervisors and bearers of the earth, which is the small brother 
of the heavens and companion of the planets. One of them was called the 
Bull and the other, the Fish. The reason for His giving these names is this:

There are two parts to the earth, one is water and the other is land. Fish 
inhabit the part that is water, while agriculture, the support of human life, is 
practised with bulls and oxen, which inhabit the part of the earth that is land; 
agriculture rests on the shoulders of oxen. Since the two angels appointed to 
the earth are both commanders and supervisors, they surely have some sort 
ّ(cid:195)ا َدْ(cid:179)ِ(cid:150) ُمْ(cid:171) ِ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)اَو 
of  relationship  with  the  bovine  and  piscine  species.  Indeed,  ِ

1.  See, M u s l i m , Janna, 12; M u s n a d , iii, 315, 341, 346.

the angels are represented in the Worlds of the Inner Dimensions of Things 
and  of  Similitudes  in  the  forms  of  a  bull  and  a  fish.  1  Thus,  alluding  to 
their  relationship  and  supervision  and  those  two  important  species  of  the 
earth, with his miraculous manner of expression the Prophet ( UWBP ) said: 
ْ(cid:202)َا thus stating in one fine, concise sentence a page of 
ِتوُ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)اَو ِرْوَ
profound truths.

ّ(cid:103)(cid:170)ا ىَ(cid:171)(cid:150)  ُضْرَ

Second Aspect

S e c o n d   A s p e c t :  If it is said: “ What does the government and its rule rest 
on?, ” it will be said in reply: ِمَ(cid:171)َ(cid:163)ْ(cid:170)اَو 
ّ(cid:127)(cid:170)ا ىَ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) That is, it rests on the valour 
ِفْ(cid:193) َ
of the soldier’s sword and the perspicacity and justice of the official’s pen. 
In the same way, since the earth is the dwelling-place of animate beings and 
the commander of animate beings is man, and fish are the means of liveli-
hood of the majority of men who live by the sea, and the majority of those 
who do not live by the sea live by means of agriculture, which rests on the 
shoulders of bulls and oxen, and fish are also an important means of trade, 
just as the state rests on the sword and the pen, so it may also be said that 
the earth rests on the ox and the fish. For man cannot survive if the ox does 
not work or fish do not produce millions of eggs; life would cease and the 
All-Wise Creator would destroy the earth.

Noble  Messenger  ( UWBP )  said: 

Thus,  replying  in  a  most  miraculous,  elevated,  and  wise  way,  Allah’s 
ْ(cid:202)َا  He  taught  an 
ِتوُ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)اَو  ِرْوَ
extensive truth with two words and showed how closely linked man’s life is 
to the life of the animal species.

ّ(cid:103)(cid:170)ا  ىَ(cid:171)(cid:150)   ُضْرَ

Third Aspect

T h i r d   A s p e c t :  In the view of ancient cosmology the sun travelled and a 
constellation was defined every thirty degrees of its journey. If hypothetical 
lines were drawn connecting the stars in the constellations with one another, 
some would take on the shape of a lion, others the shape of scales, others 
the shape of a bull, and yet others the shape of a fish. Names were given 
to the constellations in consequence of those relationships. But in the view 
of  astronomy  this  age,  the  sun  does  not  travel.  The  constellations  remain 
idle and without work, for the earth travels instead of the sun. They assume 

1.  The globe of the earth is a dominical ship ploughing through the oceans of space, 
and according to a Hadith, is the tillage of the hereafter, that is, an arable field and nursery. 
How fitting, then, are the name of Fish for the angel who commands that huge lifeless and 
unconscious ship and makes it swim through those seas at the divine command in regular, 
purposeful fashion, and the name of Bull for the angel who with divine permission super-
vises that arable field.

shapes on a small scale within the annual orbit of the earth on the ground, 
instead of those lofty idle constellations above. Thus, the heavenly constel-
lations are represented out of earth’s annual orbit, and each month the earth 
is in the shadow and likeness of one of the constellations. It is as if they are 
represented in the mirror-like annual orbit of the earth.

For this reason, as we mentioned above, on one occasion the Noble Mes-
ّ(cid:103)(cid:170)ا ىَ(cid:171)(cid:150) and on another 
senger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) said: ِرْوَ
he said:  ِتوُ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)ا ىَ(cid:171)(cid:150) Yes, he indicated a truly profound truth that would be 
understood only many centuries later, and said in the miraculous prophetic

tongue: ِرْوَ

for then the earth was in the shadow of the constellation of Pisces. 

Yes, he said:  ِتوُ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)اَو ِرْوَ

ّ(cid:103)(cid:170)ا ىَ(cid:171)(cid:150) and alluded to an elevated truth that would 
be  understood  in  the  future,  and  hinted  at  the  earth’s  duty  of  motion  and 
journeying,  and  the  heavenly  constellations  being  idle  and  without  guests 
in regard to the sun, and that the constellations which truly work are in the 
earth’s  annual  orbit  and  that  it  is  the  earth  which  journeys  and  performs 
duties in the constellations.

THE SECOND QUESTION is about the People of the Cloak
My brother! Regarding your question about the People of the Cloak, only 
one  of  the  many  instances  of  wisdom  concerning  it  will  be  explained,  as 
follows:

Many  mysteries  and  instances  of  wisdom  are  found  in  Allah’s  Noble

Hasan and Husayn ( May Allah be pleased with them ) with the blessed cloak 
he wore, and his praying for them with the verse,

 1   ( 33:33 ) ` _ ^ ] \ [ Z
I shall not discuss the mysteries, but one instance of wisdom connected with 
the function of messengership is this:

Allah’s  Noble  Messenger  ( UWBP )  saw  with  the  eye  of  prophethood, 
which penetrated the Unseen and beheld the future, that thirty or forty years 
later serious strife would erupt among the Companions and the generation 
that succeeded them, and that blood would be spilt. He witnessed that three 
of the people under his cloak would be the most distinguished of them. So 
he enfolded them in his cloak, giving the four, plus himself, the title of the 
Five People of the Cloak.  2 In this way he wanted to acquit and exonerate 
‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) in the view of the Islamic community; 
to  console  and  offer  condolences  to  Husayn  ( May  Allah  be  pleased  with 
him ); to congratulate Hasan and proclaim the honour he would acquire by 
removing through reconciliation serious discord, and his supreme value for 
the  Islamic  community;  and  to  show  that  Fatima’s  descendants  would  be 
pure and honoured and that they would be worthy of the elevated title of the 
Prophet’s Family. 

For  sure  ‘Ali  was  the  rightful  Caliph,  but  since  the  blood  that  would 
be spilt held great importance and since in the view of the community his 
acquittal and exoneration were important on account of the function of mes-
sengership, the Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) in this way absolved him. He 
invited the Kharijites and the aggressive supporters of the Umayyads to be 
silent,  for  they  criticized  him  and  accused  him  of  error  and  misguidance. 
Yes, the excesses perpetrated against ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) 
by the extreme supporters of the Kharijites and Umayyads and their accusa-
tions  of  misguidance,  and  the  truly  tragic,  distressing  events  in  Husayn’s 
( May Allah be pleased with him ) time together with the excesses and inno-
vations of the Shi‘a and their dissociating themselves from the two Shaykhs, 
have all been most damaging for the people of Islam.

Thus, with his cloak and prayer, the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ) absolved ‘Ali and Husayn of responsibility, and cleared 
them him of the accusations and bad opinion of the Islamic community. So

SECOND MYSTERY

In order not to overwhelm minds by divine unity, which is apparent in 
the  boundless  multiplicity  of  creatures,  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Expo-
sition  constantly  points  out  the  manifestation  of  divine  oneness  within 
divine  unity.  For  example,  the  sun  encompasses  numberless  things  with 
its light. A truly extensive conceptual ability and comprehensive view are 
necessary  to  behold  the  sun  itself  in  the  totality  of  its  light.  So,  lest  the 
sun  be  forgotten,  it  is  displayed  in  every  shining  object  by  means  of  its 
reflection.  And  in  accordance  with  their  capacities,  all  lustrous  objects 
reflect the sun’s attributes, such as its light and heat and the seven colours 
in its light, together with the manifestation of its essence. And just as each 
shining thing displays relatively to its capacity the sun together with all its 
attributes; so too, each one of the sun’s attributes such as its light, heat and 
the seven colours in its light encompasses all the things facing it. 

In exactly the same way,  ( 16:60 )  j  i  h – but let there be no 
mistake in the comparison – just as divine oneness and eternal besoughted-
ness have a manifestation together with all the divine names in everything, in

animate creatures in particular, and especially in man’s mirror-like essence; 
so too through divine unity each of the divine names connected to beings 
encompasses  all  things.  Thus,  lest  minds  become  overwhelmed  by  divine 
unity and hearts forget the Most Pure and Holy Essence, the Qur’an con-
stantly draws attention to the stamp of divine oneness within divine unity. 

And that stamp, with its three salient points, is

All the realms of beings in the universe are purposively gathered around 
man and are made to hasten to meet all his needs with the utmost order 
and wisdom, and this clearly arises from one of two situations. Either each 
realm of beings knows man, obeys him, and runs to help him, which just as 
it is completely irrational is also impossible in many respects; or an abso-
lutely impotent being like man has to possess the power of the mightiest 
absolute sovereign; or this assistance occurs through the knowledge of an 
Absolutely Powerful One behind the veil of the universe. That is to say, it 
is not that the different beings in the universe know man, but that they are 
the evidences of a Knowing, Compassionate One who is acquainted with 
him and knows him.

O man! Come to your senses! Is it at all possible that the All-Glorious 
One,  who  causes  all  the  varieties  of  creatures  to  turn  towards  you  and

stretch out their hands to assist you, and to say: “ Here we are! ” in the face 
of your needs – is it possible that He does not know you, is not acquainted 
with  you,  does  not  see  you?  Since  He  does  know  you,  He  informs  you 
through His mercy that He knows you. So you should know Him too, and 
with respect let Him know that you know Him, and understand with cer-
tainty that what subjugates the vast universe to an absolutely weak, abso-
lutely  impotent,  absolutely  needy,  ephemeral,  insignificant  creature  like 
you, and despatches it to assist you, is the reality of divine mercy, which 
comprises wisdom, favour, knowledge, and power.

and  earnest  and  genuine  respect.  Therefore,  say: 

Most certainly, a mercy such as this requires universal and sincere thanks,

which is the interpreter and expression of such sincere thanks and genuine 
respect. Make it the means of attaining to the mercy and an intercessor at the 
court of the All-Merciful One.

The existence and reality of divine mercy are as clear as the sun. For just 
as a woven tapestry centred on one point is formed by the order and situa-
tion of the threads of its warp and weft coming from all directions, so too the 
luminous threads extending from the manifestation of the thousand and one 
divine names in the vast sphere of the universe weave such a seal of compas-
sionateness, tapestry of clemency, and seal of benevolence within a stamp 
of mercy that it demonstrates itself to minds more brilliantly than the sun. 

The  Beauteous  All-Merciful  One,  Who  orders  through  the  rays  of  His 
thousand  and  one  names  the  sun  and  moon,  the  elements  and  minerals, 
and  plants  and  animals  like  the  warp  and  weft  of  a  vast  woven  tapestry, 
and  causes  them  to  serve  life;  and  demonstrates  His  compassion  through 
the  exceedingly  sweet  and  self-sacrificing  compassion  of  mothers,  plant 
and animal; and subjugates animate creatures to human life, and from this 
demonstrates man’s importance and a most lovely large tapestry of divine 
dominicality, and manifests His brilliant mercy; – that Most Merciful One 
has, in the face of His own absolute lack of need, made His mercy an accept-
able intercessor for animate creatures and man.
O man! If you are truly a human being, say: 

ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) Find 
that intercessor! For sure, it is clearly, self-evidently, divine mercy which, 
without  forgetting  or  confusing  any  of  them,  raises,  nurtures,  and  admin-
isters  the  four  hundred  thousand  plant  and  animal  species  on  the  earth  at 
precisely the right time and with perfect order, wisdom, and beneficence, 
and stamps the seal of divine oneness on the face of the globe of the earth.

The existence of divine mercy is as certain as the existence of the beings on 
the face of the earth, so do the beings offer evidences of its reality to their 
own number.

Just as there is this seal of mercy and stamp of divine oneness on the face 
of the earth, so on the face of man’s nature is a stamp of divine mercy that is 
not inferior to the stamp of compassion and vast stamp of mercy on the face 
of the universe. Simply, man has so comprehensive a nature he is as though 
the point of focus of a thousand and one divine names.

O man! Is it at all possible that the One who gives you this face and 
places such a stamp of mercy and seal of oneness on it would leave you 
to  your  own  devices,  attach  no  importance  to  you,  pay  no  attention  to 
your actions, make the whole universe, which is turned towards you, futile 
and pointless, and make the tree of creation rotten and insignificant with 
decayed fruit? Would He cause His mercy to be denied, although it is as 
obvious as the sun, as well as His wisdom, which is as clear as daylight, 
and neither of which can in any way be doubted, nor are in any way defi-
cient? Allah forbid!

oneness  should  be  apparent  on  all  species  and  realms  of  beings  just  as  it 
is  shown  clearly  on  individual  objects,  and  that  they  should  call  to  mind 
the Single One, it is shown within the stamp of divine mercy. Thus every-
one at every level may turn to the Most Pure and Holy One, and declaring: 
5 4 3 2  address Him directly.
It is in order to express this mighty mystery and clearly point out the seal 
of divine oneness that the All-Wise Qur’an suddenly mentions the smallest 
sphere and most particular matter when describing the vastest sphere of the 
universe, for example, the creation of the heavens and the earth. That is, so 
that the mind does not wander, nor the heart drown, and the spirit may find 
its  True  Object  of  Worship  directly,  while  mentioning  the  creation  of  the 
heavens and earth it opens a discussion of man’s creation and voice, and the 
subtle details of the bounties and wisdom in his features, for example. This 
truth is demonstrated in miraculous fashion by the verse, 

( 30:22 ) v u t s r q p o
Within innumerable creatures and infinite multiplicity, there are stamps 
of unity like concentric circles of many sorts and degrees from the greatest 
stamp  to  the  smallest.  But  however  clear  the  unity,  it  is  still  unity  within 
multiplicity; it does not truly address observers. Hence, there has to be the 
stamp  of  divine  oneness  behind  unity  so  that  unity  does  not  call  to  mind 
multiplicity and before the Most Pure and Holy One a way may be opened 
up to the heart directly.

Furthermore, a truly captivating design, shining light, agreeable sweet-
ness,  pleasing  beauty,  and  powerful  truth  –  which  is  the  stamp  of  divine 
mercy  and  seal  of  divine  compassion  –  has  been  placed  on  the  stamp  of 
divine oneness in order to direct gazes towards it and attract hearts. Yes, it is 
the strength of that mercy that attracts the gazes of conscious beings, draws 
them to it, and causes them to reach the seal of oneness and to observe the 
Single One, and from that to truly manifest the address of

There is a Hadith which goes something like this: 
ْ(cid:202)ا  َقَ(cid:171)َ(cid:114) َ

ّنِا 1 It has been interpreted by some Sufis 
ﯗﮑ ٰ(cid:175)ْ(cid:110)َ
in an extraordinary way, unfitting for the tenets of belief. Some of them 
who  were  ecstatics  even  considered  man’s  spiritual  nature  to  be  in  the 
form of the All-Merciful. Since ecstatics are mostly immersed in contem-
plation  and  confused,  they  are  perhaps  to  be  excused  in  holding  views 
contrary to reality. But on consideration, people in their right senses can-
not accept ideas of theirs that are contrary to the fundamentals of belief. If 
they do, they are in error.

Indeed, the Most Pure and Holy Deity, who administers with order the 
whole universe as though it were a palace or house, and spins the stars as 
though  they  were  particles  and  causes  them  to  travel  through  space  with 
wisdom and ease, and employs minute particles as though they were orderly 
officials, has no partner, match, opposite, or equal. So too, according to the 
meaning of the verse:

( 42:11 ) 7 6 5  3 2 1
He has no form, like, or peer, and there is nothing resembling Him or similar 
to Him. However, according to the meaning of the following verse and its 
parabolic comparison,

( 30:27 ) P O N M L K J I H G
His actions, attributes, and names may be considered. That is to say, allegory 
and  comparison  may  be  used  in  connection  with  His  actions.  One  of  the 
many things intended by the above-mentioned Hadith is: “ Man is in a form 
that  displays  the  divine  name  of  All-Merciful  in  its  entirety. ”  Yes,  as  we 
explained before, the divine name of All-Merciful is manifested through the 
rays of a thousand and one names on the face of the universe, and is apparent 
through the innumerable manifestations of Allah’s absolute dominicality on 
the face of the earth. Similarly, its complete manifestation is apparent in a 
small measure in man’s comprehensive form, the same as on the faces of the 
earth and universe.

The Hadith suggests also that the evidences of the Necessarily Exist-
ent One offered by such proofs, mirrors, and manifestations of the Most

O  unhappy  man  afflicted  by  boundless  impotence  and  endless  wants! 
See from the following how valuable and acceptable an intercessor is divine 
mercy. For it is a way to know the All-Glorious Sovereign in Whose army 
both the stars and minute particles serve together in perfect order and obe-
dience – the Glorious Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, Who is 
self-sufficient and utterly without need. He is rich without limit and in no 
way in need of the universe and its beings. The whole cosmos is under His 
command and direction, utterly obedient beneath His majesty and grandeur, 
submissive before His sublimity. That is divine mercy for you, O man! It 
raises you to the presence of the One Who lacks all need, the Eternal Sover-
eign, and makes you His friend, addressee, and well-loved servant. But just 
as you cannot reach the sun and are far from it although it fills your mirror 
with  its  light,  reflection,  and  manifestation,  and  you  can  in  no  way  draw 
near to it; in the same way you are infinitely distant from the Most Pure and 
Holy One, the Sun of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, and cannot draw near 
to Him, but the light of His mercy brings Him nearer to us. 

O man! Anyone who finds this mercy finds an eternally unfailing treas-
ury of light. And the way to find it is by following the practices of the Most 
Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), who was the most 
brilliant exemplar and representative of mercy, its most eloquent tongue and 
herald, and was described in the Qur’an as a “ Mercy to All the Worlds. ”

The  way  to  attain  to  this  embodiment  of  mercy  who  is  a  mercy  to  all 
the worlds is to utter the prayer calling down Allah’s blessings upon him. 
Indeed, the meaning of this prayer is mercy. As a prayer of mercy for that 
living embodiment of divine mercy, it is a means of reaching the Mercy to 
All  the  Worlds  ( UWBP ).  1  So,  make  this  prayer  the  means  to  the  mercy 
to all the worlds for yourself, and at the same time make him the means of 
reaching the mercy of the Most Merciful One.

The  whole  Muslim  community  in  all  its  vastness  uttering  this  prayer 
which is synonymous with mercy for the Mercy to All the Worlds ( UWBP ) 
proves  in  brilliant  fashion  what  a  precious  gift  is  divine  mercy,  and  how 
broad is its sphere.

To   C o n c l u d e :  Just  as  the  most  precious  jewel  in  the  treasury  of  mercy 
is the Prophet Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), its door-

My Dear and Loyal Brothers Hoja Sabri, Hâfız ‘Ali, Mes’ud, the Mus-
tafas, Husrev, Re’fet, Bekir Bey, Rüştü, the Lütfis, Hâfız Ahmed, Shaykh 
Mustafa, and the others! It occurred to my heart to explain to you in concise 
informative fashion four small matters that have been the subject of curios-
ity and questions.

THE FIRST

Certain  of  our  brothers  like  Çaprazzâde  Abdullah  Efendi  had  heard 
related  from  the  diviners  of  realities  that  this  last  Ramadan  a  relief  from 
difficulties, a victory, would occur for the Sunnis, whereas it did not occur. 
Why do such people of sainthood and illumination make predictions that are 
contrary to reality? They asked me, and a summary of the reply I gave them, 
with which I was inspired, is this: 

It  says  in  a  Hadith:  “ Sometimes  a  calamity  is  visited  on  a  person,  but 
if  it  meets  with  almsgiving,  it  is  repelled. ”  1  The  underlying  meaning  of 
this  Hadith  shows  that  while  appointed  events  are  going  to  come  to  pass 
under  certain  conditions,  they  do  not  occur.  That  is  to  say,  the  appointed 
events of which the people of illumination are aware are not absolute, but 
restricted by certain conditions; if the conditions are not fulfilled, the event 
does not occur. However the event, like the appointed hour of death when 
conditional, is written and determined in the Tablet of Appearance and Dis-
solution,  2 which is a sort of notebook of the Pre-Eternal Tablet. It is only 
extremely rarely that illuminations penetrate as far as the Pre-Eternal Tablet; 
mostly they cannot rise that far.

2.  See, al-Nawawī, Sharḥ Ṣ a ḥ ī ḥ  M u s l i m , xvi, 114; Ibn Ḥajar, F a t ḥ   a l - B ā r ī , x, 415-6.

SIXTEENTH FLASH

147

In consequence, predictions made as a result of interpretations or illumi-
nations this last Ramadan and Feast of Sacrifices or at other times that do 
not occur because the conditions on which they were dependent were not 
fulfilled, do not give the lie to those who told of them. For they were deter-
mined, but did not come about because the conditions were not fulfilled.

Yes, the sincere prayers of the majority of the Sunnis that innovations in 
the month of Ramadan be abrogated formed a condition and important rea-
son. But since innovations had entered the mosques in Ramadan, they hin-
dered the acceptance of the supplications, and the relief did not arrive. Just 
as in accordance with the above Hadith, almsgiving repels calamities, the 
sincere supplications of the majority attract a general release from troubles. 
Since the power of attraction was not formed, the victory was not given.

SECOND CURIOUS QUESTION

The last two months there has been a lively political situation in the face 
of which some attempt should have been made to alleviate conditions both 
for myself and the brothers with whom I am connected. While there was a 
strong possibility that this could have been achieved, I attached no impor-
tance  to  the  situation,  and  on  the  contrary,  had  an  idea  in  support  of  ‘the 
worldly’ who oppress me. A number of people were astonished at this. They 
said: “ What do you think about the policies followed by those at the head 
of these innovators and in part dissembling people who torment you, so that 
you do nothing to them? ” A summary of my reply is as follows:

The greatest danger facing the people of Islam at this time is their hearts 
being corrupted and belief harmed through the misguidance that arises from 
science and philosophy. The sole solution for this is light; it is to show light 
so that their hearts may be reformed and their belief, saved. If one acts with 
the club of politics and prevails over them, the unbelievers descend to the 
degree of dissemblers. And dissemblers are worse than unbelievers. That is 
to say, the club cannot heal the heart at this time, for then unbelief enters 
the heart and is concealed, and is transformed into dissembling. And at this 
time, a powerless person like myself cannot employ both of them, the club 
and the light. For this reason I am compelled to embrace the light with all 
my  strength  and  cannot  consider  the  club  of  politics  whatever  form  it  is 
in.  We  are  not  charged  with  physical  j i h a d   at  the  moment,  whatever  that 
duty demands. Yes, in accordance with a person’s way, a club is necessary 
to  form  a  barrier  against  the  assaults  of  the  unbelievers  or  apostates.  But 
we only have two hands. Even if we had a hundred hands, they would be 

148

THE FLASHES

sufficient only for the light. We do not have any other hands with which to 
hold the club!

THIRD CURIOUS QUESTION

Why do you violently oppose war, although, with foreign forces like the 
British  and  Italians  interfering  in  the  government  recently,  it  would  have 
excited Islamic zeal – the true point of support and source of moral strength 
of this country’s government – and been a means to an extent of reviving the 
marks of Islam and repulsing innovations? Why have you offered prayers 
for its being settled by peaceful means and come out fervently in support 
of the innovators’ government? Is this not indirect support of innovations?

The  Answer:  We  want  relief,  release,  happiness,  and  victory,  but  not 
with the sword of the unbelievers. Let their swords be the end of them! We 
are not in need of any advantage proceeding from them. In fact it is those 
obstinate  Europeans  who  have  set  the  dissemblers  to  pester  the  people  of 
belief, and have raised the atheists.

As for the calamity of war, it would cause great harm to our service of 
the Qur’an. The majority of our most valuable, self-sacrificing brothers are 
under  the  age  of  forty-five,  and  would  be  forced  because  of  war  to  leave 
their sacred service of the Qur’an and enroll in the army. If I had the money, 
I would gladly pay whatever was necessary to exempt each of such valuable 
brothers from military service, even if it was a thousand liras. With hundreds 
of my valuable brothers leaving the Qur’anic service of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and 
laying hands on the club of physical j i h a d , I feel a loss in myself of a hun-
dred thousand liras. These two years of Zekâi’s military service, even, have 
caused perhaps a thousand liras of his immaterial profit to be lost. Anyway... 
Like the One Powerful Over All Things sweeps and cleans in a minute the 
atmosphere filled with clouds and shows the shining sun in clear skies, so He 
may dispel these black, merciless clouds and show the truths of the Shari‘a 
like the sun, and give them without expense or trouble. We await it from 
His mercy that He will not sell them to us expensively. May He give intel-
ligence to the heads of those at the top, and belief to their hearts; that would 
be enough. Then matters would put themselves to rights.

FOURTH CURIOUS QUESTION

They ask: “ Since what you hold in your hand is light, not a club, and light 
may not be objected to, nor fled from, nor can harm come from showing it, 
why do you advise caution to your friends, and prevent them showing many 
light-filled parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  to people? ”

SIXTEENTH FLASH

149

A  brief  reply  to  the  question  is  this:  the  heads  of  most  of  those  at  the 
top are drunk and they cannot read them. And even if they do read them, 
they cannot understand them; they give them the wrong meaning, and inter-
fere.  They  should  not  be  shown  them  until  they  come  to  their  senses  lest 
they interfere. There are also many unscrupulous people who out of spite or 
ambition or fear, deny the light or close their eyes to it. Therefore, I advise 
my brothers to be cautious and not to give the truths to those who are unfit, 
1 or do things which excite the suspicions of ‘the worldly.’ 2

Conclusion
Today I received a letter from Re’fet Bey. In connection with his ques-

tion about the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) beard, I say this:

It  is  established  by  Hadiths  that  the  number  of  hairs  from  the  blessed 
beard of the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) was 
small. But despite their being few – for instance, thirty, forty, fifty or sixty 
– the fact that there are hairs from the blessed beard in thousands of places 
caused me much thought at one time. It occurred to me then that what is 
known as his blessed beard consists not only of its hairs, but also the hair 
of his blessed head, which the Companions, who neglected nothing,  3 pre-
served when he cut it. His luminous, blessed hair, which would be preserved 
for ever, numbered thousands and may be equal to what is now extant.

I also wondered at that time whether or not it was established with sound 
documentary evidence that the hair found in all mosques was the Messen-
ger’s  ( UWBP )  hair  so  that  it  was  acceptable  to  visit  it.  Then  it  occurred 
to me that it was the cause of visits, and of benedictions being uttered for 
the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), and his being 

1.  See, I b n   M ā j a , Muqaddima, 17.
2.  An anecdote about an event that could have led to something serious: yesterday 
morning Mehmed, the son-in-law of one of my friends came to me. Joyfully, as one bear-
ing good news, he said to me: “ They’ve printed one of your books in Isparta and a lot 
of people are reading it. ” I replied: “ That one hasn’t been printed, which is prohibited; a 
number of copies have been obtained by means of a hectograph, about which the govern-
ment can say nothing. ” And I added: “ Be careful not to say anything about this to those 
two dissemblers, your friends. They’re looking for something to use as a pretext. ” My 
friends! The man was the son-in-law of one of my friends, and in that connection may also 
be thought of as my friend, but because he is the barber he is the friend of the unscrupulous 
teacher and dissembling District Officer. One of our brothers apparently said something 
there without being aware of it, so it was a good thing that he came first and told me about 
it. I warned him and anything untoward was forestalled. And behind this screen the dupli-
cating machine published thousands of copies.

THE FLASHES

venerated and loved, 1 and thus was not looked at for what it actually was. 
Therefore,  even  if  the  hair  was  not  truly  from  the  Messenger’s  ( UWBP ) 
blessed beard, since it was held to be so because of its appearance, and it 
functioned  as  a  means  of  veneration,  regard,  and  benedictions,  it  did  not 
have to be authenticated. So long as there was no definite evidence to the 
contrary, that was sufficient. For generally held opinions and the acceptance 
of the Islamic community count as a sort of proof.

If some of the pious object to such matters on grounds of fear of Allah, or 
caution, or resolution, they do so in particular cases. And if they say it is an 
innovation, it should be included among commendable innovations, for it is 
a means of benedictions for the Prophet ( UWBP ) being recited. Re’fet Bey 
said in his letter that the matter had led to an argument among the brothers. 
I advise my brothers that they do not argue in such a way as to cause differ-
ences and conflict; they should grow accustomed to discussing things as an 
exchange of ideas, without arguing.

T h e   S e c o n d :  Where is the barrier of Dhu’l-Qarnayn?
T h e   T h i r d :  This is about Jesus ( UWP ) coming at the end of time 2 and 

killing the Dajjal. 3

SIXTEENTH FLASH

151

The  answers  to  these  questions  are  lengthy,  so  indicating  them  briefly 
we  say  this:  since  the  verses  of  the  Qur’an  express  matters  in  accord-
ance  with  the  styles  of  Arabic,  in  conformity  with  apparent  meanings, 
in  a  way  everyone  will  understand,  they  frequently  explain  things  in  the 
form of metaphors, allegories, and comparisons. So to consider the verse, 
8 7 6 5 Dhu’l-Qarnayn saw the sun setting on the shores of the 
Atlantic  Ocean,  which  appeared  to  be  a  boiling,  muddy  spring,  or  in  the 
fiery,  smoking  crater  of  a  volcano.  That  is,  evidently  the  Atlantic  Ocean 
appeared to Dhu’l-Qarnayn in the distance as the large pool of a spring sur-
rounded by a swamp which in the intense heat of summer was steaming and 
vaporizing; he saw the sun’s apparent setting in a part of it. Or he saw the 
sun, the eye of the skies, being hidden in a new, fiery crater at the summit of 
a volcano which was spewing out rocks, earth, and lava.

Yes,  the  All-Wise  Qur’an’s  miraculously  eloquent  expression  teaches 
many matters with this sentence. Firstly, it explains that Dhu’l-Qarnayn’s 
journey to the west coincided with the intense heat of summer, the area of a 
swamp, sunset, and the time of a volcanic eruption, and so alludes to many 
instructive matters, such as the complete conquest of Africa.

It is well-known that the sun’s motion is apparent, indicating the hidden 
movement of the earth and giving news of it. What it intends is not the actual 
setting of the sun. Also the spring is a metaphor. From the distance a large 
sea appears to be a small pool. It is most meaningful and apt according to 
the mysteries of eloquence 1 to liken a sea appearing beyond swamps with 
mists and vapours rising from it due to the heat to a muddy spring, with word 
7  , which in Arabic means both spring, and sun, and eye. It appeared 
like that to Dhu’l-Qarnayn because of the distance. So too, the Qur’an comes 
from the sublime throne and commands the heavenly bodies, so its heavenly 
address stating that the subjugated sun, which performs the duty of a lamp 
in this guesthouse of the Most Merciful One, is hidden in a dominical spring 
like  the  Atlantic  Ocean,  is  fitting  for  its  loftiness  and  sublimity;  with  its 
miraculous style it shows the sea to be a hot spring and steaming eye. And 
that is how is appears to heavenly eyes.

1.    In  accordance  with  the  mysteries  of  rhetoric  the  word  “ spring ”  7  in 
8 7 6 makes a subtle allusion, as follows: after gazing with the eye of the sun on 
the beauty of divine mercy on the face of the earth, the sky and its face – and after behold-
ing divine tremendousness above, the earth with the eye of the sea –  these two eyes close 
one within the other and close also the eyes on the earth. Thus, with one miraculous word 
the Qur’an recalls this, and alludes to eyes resting from their duties.

152

THE FLASHES

I n    S h o r t : The use of the term “ a   m u d d y   s p r i n g  ” for the Atlantic Ocean 
indicates  that  Dhu’l-Qarnayn  saw  that  huge  ocean  as  a  spring  due  to  the 
distance. But because the Qur’an sees everything from close to, it did not 
see  what  Dhu’l-Qarnayn  saw,  which  was  a  sort  of  illusion.  Indeed,  since 
the Qur’an comes from the heavens and looks to them, it sometimes sees 
the  earth  as  an  arena,  sometimes  as  a  palace,  sometimes  as  a  cradle,  and 
sometimes as a page. So its calling the vast misty, vaporous Atlantic Ocean 
a spring shows its lofty sublimity.

YOUR SECOND QUESTION

Where is the barrier of Dhu’l-Qarnayn? Who were Gog and Magog?
The  Answer:  Long  ago  I  wrote  a  treatise  about  this  question  and  it 
silenced the atheists. I do not have it with me now, and my memory is not 
working and helping me. Also, this question is discussed briefly in the Third 
Branch of the Twenty-Fourth Word. We shall therefore only indicate very 
briefly two or three points about it, as follows:

According to explanations given by investigative scholars, and as indi-
cated by the title Dhu’l-Qarnayn, names beginning with the suffix D h u , like 
Dhu’l-Yazan, were used by the kings of Yemen, so this Dhu’l-Qarnayn was 
not Alexander the Greek. He was one of the kings of Yemen 1 who lived at 
the time of Abraham ( UWP ) 2 and received instruction from Khidr. 3 Alex-
ander the Greek lived approximately three hundred years before Christ, and 
was taught by Aristotle. 4

Human history goes back in regular fashion approximately three thou-
sand  years.  This  deficient  and  short  view  of  history  is  not  accurate  con-
cerning  pre-Abrahamic  times.  It  continues  back  either  as  superstition,  or 
as  denial,  or  in  very  abbreviated  form.  The  reason  the  Dhu’l-Qarnayn  of 
Yemen was since early times in Qur’anic commentaries known as Alexan-
der, 5 was either because it was one of his names and he was Alexander the 
Great or the Alexander of Ancient Times, or else the following:

The particular events mentioned in Qur’anic verses are the tips of univer-
sal events. Thus, through his prophetic guidance, Alexander the Great, who 
was Dhu’l-Qarnayn, built a barrier between some peoples, oppressors and 
oppressed, and built the famous Great Wall of China to prevent the raids of 
those cruel enemies. Similarly, many powerful kings and world conquerors 
like Alexander the Greek followed in the path of Dhu’l-Qarnayn materially, 
while the prophets and spiritual poles, who are the kings of man’s spiritual 
world,  followed  him  in  spiritual  matters  and  guidance;  they  built  barriers 
between mountains, one of the most effective means of saving the oppressed 
from  oppressors,  1  and  later  constructed  strongholds  on  mountain  peaks. 
They  founded  these  themselves  through  their  material  power,  or  through 
their guidance and planning. Then they built walls surrounding towns and 
citadels inside the towns, and finally they made machine-guns and Dread-
noughts, which were like mobile citadels. The most famous barrier on earth, 
the Great Wall of China, covers a distance of several days’ journeying and 
was built to halt the incursions against the oppressed peoples of India and 
China  of  the  savage  tribes  known  in  the  Qur’an  as  Gog  and  Magog,  and 
otherwise  known  as  the  Mongols  and  Manchurians.  These  tribes  several 
times threw the world of humanity into chaos. Pouring out from behind the 
Himalayas,  they  wrought  destruction  from  east  to  west.  A  long  wall  was 
built between two mountains close to the Himalayan mountains which for a 
long time prevented the frequent assaults of those savage peoples, and bar-
riers were also built through the efforts of the kings of ancient Persia, who 
resembled  Dhu’l-Qarnayn,  in  the  mountains  of  Caucasia,  in  the  region  of 
Darband, to halt the inroads of the plundering and pillaging Tatar peoples. 
There are very many barriers of this sort. Since the All-Wise Qur’an speaks 
with all mankind, it mentions what is apparently a particular incident, and 
recalls all events similar to it. It is from this point of view that the narrations 
differ concerning the Barrier and Gog and Magog, as well as the writings of 
the Qur’anic commentators about them.

Furthermore,  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  switches  from  one  event  to  another 
distant  one  due  to  the  association  of  ideas.  The  person  who  fails  to  think 
of  this  association  supposes  the  two  events  to  be  close  in  time.  Thus,  the 
Qur’an’s predicting the end of the world from the destruction of the Barrier 
is not because the two events are close in time, but to make two subtle points 
connected with the association of ideas. That is, the world will be destroyed 

1.  There are numerous artificial barriers on the face of the earth that with the passing 

of time have taken on the appearance of mountains or have become unrecognizable.

just  as  the  Barrier  will  be  destroyed.  Also,  just  as  mountains,  which  are 
natural divine barriers, are firm and will be destroyed only at the end of the 
world; so the Barrier is firm as a mountain and will be levelled to dust only 
at the destruction of the world. Even if it suffers damage from the assaults of 
time, it will mostly remain intact. Yes, the Great Wall of China is one par-
ticular meaning of the universal meaning of the Barrier of Dhu’l-Qarnayn 
and has been standing for thousands of years and is still there for all to see. 
It is read as a long, petrified, meaningful line from ancient history, written 
by man’s hand on the page of the earth.

My Dear Self-Sacrificing, Loyal, Conscientious Brothers, Hoja Sabri and 

Hâfız Ali!

Your important question concerning the verse at the end of Sura Luq-
man about “ t h e   f i v e   h i d d e n   t h i n g s  ”( 31:34 )  1 deserves a serious reply, but 
unfortunately neither my present state of mind nor my physical condition 
permit it. I shall allude only very concisely to one or two points your ques-
tion touches on.

Your  question  indicates  that  atheists  who  have  deviated  from  the  true 
path  of  religion  have  made  objections  and  criticisms  concerning  the  time 
of  rain  falling  and  nature  of  the  embryos  in  the  womb  from  among  “ t h e  
f i v e   h i d d e n   t h i n g s . ”  They  have  said:  “ Instruments  in  the  observatory  can 
discover when rain is to fall, so someone other than Allah knows. Also the 
sex of embryos can be learnt by means of X-rays. This means it is possible 
to learn “ the five hidden things. ”

The Answer: The time rain falls is tied not to any law, but directly to 
divine will. One instance of wisdom in its appearance from the treasury of 
mercy being dependent on a particular divine wish is as follows: 

The  most  important  things  in  the  universe  and  the  most  valuable  are 
existence, life, light, and mercy. These look directly, without intermediary 
or veil, to divine power and a particular divine wish. With other creatures, 
apparent causes are veils to the disposal of divine power, and regular laws 
and  principles  screen  the  divine  will  and  wish  to  an  extent.  However,  no 
such veils have been placed on existence, life, light, and mercy, for the pur-
pose they serve is not in force in those things.

Since the most important truths in existence are mercy and life, and rain 
is the source of life and means of mercy, indeed is pure mercy, of a certainty 
intermediaries will not veil it, nor will laws and monotony screen the wishes 
that are Allah’s alone. In this way everyone in every situation will all the 
time be obliged to offer thanks and worship and supplications and prayers. 

1.  See, B u k h ā r ī , Istisqā’, 29; Tafsīr Sūra 6:1; 13:1; 31:2; Tawḥīd, 4; M u s n a d , ii, 24; 

52, 58, 122.

ٰ
156

THE FLASHES

If rain had been included under a law, everyone would have relied on the law 
and the door of thanks and supplication would have been closed.

It is clear that there are numerous benefits in the sun’s rising, but since it 
is tied to a regular law, supplications are not offered for its rising and thanks 
are not given. And since because of the law it is a part of human knowledge 
that it will rise again tomorrow, it is not counted among the matters of the 
Unseen. But the particular occurences of rain do not follow any law, so men 
are all the time obliged to take refuge at the divine court with prayers and 
supplications.  Human  knowledge  has  been  unable  to  specify  the  times  of 
precipitation, men therefore consider it a special bounty proceeding from the 
treasury of mercy alone, and truly offer thanks.

In consequence the verse includes the time rain falls among “ the five hid-
den things. ” Deducing the preliminaries of rain with instruments in observa-
tories and specifying the times of precipitation is not knowing the Unseen, 
but knowing by studying some of its preliminaries when it has emerged from 
the World of the Unseen and drawn close to the Manifest World. When the 
most hidden events of the Unseen occur, or when they are close to occurring, 
they may be perceived through a sort of premonition. But that is not know-
ing the Unseen, but knowing that something exists or is close to existence. 
In  fact,  I  sometimes  perceive  the  rain  twenty-four  hours  before  it  arrives 
due to a sensitivity in my nerves. That is to say, the rain has preliminaries, 
forerunners; they make themselves felt through a sort of dampness, making 
it known that rain is to follow. Just like a law, this situation is a means of 
reaching matters that have left the World of the Unseen but not yet entered 
the Manifest World. But to know when rain will fall that has not yet set foot 
in the Manifest World, nor left through a particular divine wish the treasury 
of mercy, is peculiar to the One All-Knowing of the Unseen.

THE SECOND MATTER

Learning  by  means  of  X-rays  whether  a  child  in  the  womb  is  male  or 
female is not contrary to the meaning of the verse, ( 31:34 ) Ç Æ Å Ä 
which  refers  to  the  Unseen.  For  what  is  intended  by  the  verse  are  the 
preliminaries of the child’s particular capacity and the appointed course 
of  its  life,  which  it  will  acquire  in  the  future,  and  even  the  wondrous 
stamp  of  the  Eternally  Besought  One  on  its  face  –  the  child  being 
known in this way is particular to the One All-Knowing of the Unseen.1 
Even  if  a  hundred  thousand  X-ray-like  minds  of  men  were  to  combine, 
they still could not discover its true features, each of which is a mark dis-

1.  See, B u k h ā r ī , Bad’ al-khalq, 6; Anbiyā’, 1; M u s l i m , Qadar,  1.

SIXTEENTH FLASH

157

tinguishing the child from all the other members of the human race. So how 
could  they  discover  the  non-physical  features  of  its  abilities,  which  are  a 
hundred times more wondrous than its physical features.

We  said  at  the  beginning  that  existence,  life,  and  mercy  are  the  most 
important truths in the universe and that the most important station is theirs. 
Therefore, one reason for the comprehensive truth of life looking with all its 
fine points and subtleties to the divine will and wish and mercy, which are 
particular to Allah Almighty, is this: 

Since life together with all its faculties and facets is the source and means 
of  thanks  and  worship,  laws  and  monotony  –  which  are  a  veil  to  Allah’s 
will, and apparent intermediaries – which screen His mercy, have not been 
placed on it. Almighty Allah has two manifestations in the physical and non-
physical features of unborn children.

One  shows  divine  unity,  oneness,  and  eternal  besoughtedness,  for  the 
child  testifies  to  divine  unity  by  being  similar  to  other  human  beings  in 
respect of its basic members and human faculties. With this tongue it shouts 
out:  “ Whoever  gave  me  these  features  and  members  is  the  Maker  of  all 
human beings, for they resemble me in regard to basic members, and He is 
the Maker too of all living beings. ”

This tongue of the child in the womb does not pertain to the Unseen; it 
may be known since it follows a law and general rule and the species. It is a 
branch and tongue of the Manifest World that has entered the World of the 
Unseen.

The  Second  Aspect:  With  the  tongue  of  the  features  of  its  particular 
capacity and its individual features, it proclaims its Maker’s choice, will and 
wish and particular mercy and that He is under no restriction. But this tongue 
comes  from  the  deepest  Unseen;  none  other  than  Pre-Eternal  Knowledge 
can see it before it comes into existence, nor comprehend it. These features 
cannot be known while in the womb even if one or other of the child’s thou-
sand members is seen!

I n    S h o r t : The features of the embryo’s innate capacity and its physical 
features offer both evidence for divine unity and proofs of divine will and 
choice. If Almighty Allah grants success, a number of further points shall be 
written about “ the five hidden things. ” But for now I have no more time and 
my condition does not permit it, so I conclude here.

My Dear, Loyal, Curious Brother, Re’fet Bey!
You ask in your letter about the ten subtle faculties. It is not appropriate 
to give instruction in the Sufi way at present; there are in any case the works 
about them written by the learned shaykhs of the Naqshbandi Order. Our 
duty at the present time is to disclose mysteries, not to relate existent mat-
ters. Don’t be offended, I can’t give the details. I shall only say this much: 
Imam-i  Rabbani  defined  the  ten  subtle  faculties  as  the  heart,  spirit,  inner 
heart ( s i r r  ), k h a f ī , a k h f ā , and a faculty related to each of the four elements 
in man, and he discussed briefly the progress of one faculty in each stage of 
the spiritual journeying.

I myself observe that there are numerous subtle faculties in man’s com-
prehensive  disposition  and  vital  potentialities,  of  which  ten  have  become 
famous.  The  philosophers  and  literalist  scholars  made  those  ten  faculties 
the basis of their theories in another form, and called them the five external 
senses and five internal senses, these latter being the windows or samples of 
the ten faculties. In fact, man’s ten subtle faculties, which are well-known 
by both the learned and ordinary people, are related to the Sufis’ ten subtle 
faculties. For example, if such faculties as the conscience, nerves, emotions, 
intellect, desires, power of animal appetites, and power of anger are added to 
the heart, spirit, and inner heart, the ten subtle faculties are shown in another 
way. There are many other faculties in addition to these, like the sense of 
premonition,  and  various  motive  and  appetitive  powers.  To  expound  this 
question completely would be very lengthy, and as I have little time, I am 
compelled to cut it short.

As for your second question, about the aspect of things which looks to 
themselves, and the aspect which looks to their Maker ( m â n â - y ı   i s m î  and 
m â n â - y ı   h a r f î  ), they are explained at the start of all books on Arabic gram-
mar. Moreover, there are ample explanations of them, together with com-
parisons, in the works of the science of reality called T h e   Wo r d s  and L e t t e r s . 
Further discussion would be superfluous for someone intelligent and exact-
ing like yourself. If when you look at the mirror, you look at it for the glass, 
you will intentionally see the glass; Re’fet will strike the eye secondarily, 

SIXTEENTH FLASH

159

indirectly. Whereas if your purpose is to look at the mirror in order to see your 
blessed  face,  you  will  intentionally  see  lovable  Re’fet.  You  will  exclaim:  
( 23:14 ) ª © ¨ §  The glass of the mirror will strike your eye 
secondarily and indirectly.

Thus,  in  the  first  instance,  the  glass  of  the  mirror  is  ‘the  meaning  that 
looks to the thing itself,’ while Re’fet is its ‘significative meaning.’ In the 
second instance, the glass of the mirror is ‘the significative meaning’, that 
is, it is looked at not for itself but for another meaning; that is, the reflection. 
The reflection is ‘the meaning which looks to the thing itself.’ That is, it is 
included in one respect in the definition “ it points to a meaning in itself. ” 
While the mirror verifies the definition of its ‘significative meaning,’ which 
is “ it points to the meaning of another. ” 

According to the Qur’anic view, all the beings in the universe are letters, 
expressing  through  their  ‘significative  meaning,’  the  meaning  of  another. 
That is, they make known the names and attributes of that Other. Soulless 
philosophy for the most part looks in accordance with ‘the meaning which 
looks to the thing itself’ and deviates into the bog of nature. However, I do 
not have the time now for much talk. In fact, I cannot even write the final 
and easiest and most important part of the Index. Convey my greetings to 
your study companions, in particular, Husrev, Bekir, Rüşdü, Lütfü, Shaykh 
Mustafa, Hâfız Ahmed, Sezâi, the Mehmeds, and the Hojas. I pray for the 
blessed innocents in your household.

The Seventeenth Flash 

[ This Flash consists of Fifteen Notes taken from Zühre. ]

(cid:2)(cid:3)

Introduction
Twelve years before this Flash was written, 1 I wrote down in note form 
in Arabic in such treatises as Z ü h r e , Ş u ’ l e , H a b b e , Ş e m m e , Z e r r e , and K a t r e , 
a  number  of  flashes  concerning  divine  unity  which  became  clear  to  me 
through dominical grace during an unfolding of the spirit and progress of 
the mind and journey of the heart in divine knowledge. But since they were 
written to show only one tip of a lengthy truth and point out only one beam 
of a shining light, and since each was in the form of a memento and reminder 
for myself only, their benefits for others were limited, and particularly as the 
great majority of my most select and special brothers were unable to read 
Arabic.  On  their  insistent  and  pressing  requests,  therefore,  I  was  obliged 
to write in Turkish an approximation of those notes, those flashes, in part 
expounding them and in part abbreviating them. Since these notes and Ara-
bic  treatises  form  the  first  of  the  New  Said’s  works  proceeding  from  the 
knowledge of reality, which he to a degree  witnessed  in the  form of illu-
mination, their meanings have been written unchanged. Because of this, a 
number of the sentences are included here despite being mentioned in others 
of the Wo r d s . And some are not expounded despite being very concise, so 
that the refinement of the original should not be lost.

First Note
I addressed myself saying: O heedless Said! Know that it is unworthy of 
you to attach your heart to something that will not accompany you after this 
world comes to an end and on its destruction will part from you. It is not rea-
sonable to fasten your heart to transitory things that will turn their backs on

161

you and leave you when the age in which you live comes to an end, and will 
not befriend you on the journey through the Intermediate Realm, or accom-
pany you to the door of the grave, 1 and which, leaving you for ever after one 
or two years, will burden you with their sins and out of spite abandon you at 
the moment of accomplishment.

If you are sensible, you will give up matters that will be shattered and 
destroyed under the blows of worldly revolutions and the stages of the Inter-
mediate Realm and clashing upheavals of the hereafter; which are not able 
to  accompany  and  befriend  you  on  the  journey  to  eternity.  Give  them  no 
importance! Do not grieve at their passing!

Consider your own nature; among your subtle faculties is one that will be 
content with nothing other than eternity and the Eternal One. It can address 
itself to none but He. It cannot demean itself for any other. Should you give 
it the whole world, it would not satisfy that innate need. It is the sovereign 
of your senses and faculties. So obey it, for it obeys the All-Wise Creator’s 
command! Find salvation!

Second Note
I had a true dream in which I said to people: “ O man! One of the Qur’an’s 
principles is this: consider nothing other than Almighty Allah to be greater 
than yourself to the degree that you worship it. And do not consider yourself 
to be greater than anything else to the degree that you become arrogant and 
haughty before it. For just as all creatures are equal in regard to their far-
ness from being fit to be worshipped, so too are they equal in regard to their 
createdness. ”

Third Note
O heedless Said! You have illusions and see the exceedingly temporary 
world  as  undying  and  permanent.  When  you  look  around  yourself  at  the 
world, you see it as stable to a degree, and constant. Since looking with the 
same view you also consider your own transient self to be constant, you only 
take fright at Doomsday. You are only frightened at that as though you were 
going to live till then. 2

Use your reason! You and your personal world are perpetually subject 
to the blows of death and decline. Your illusion and sophistry resemble this 
comparison:  if  you  have  a  mirror  and  hold  it  up  to  a  house  or  a  town  or 

1.  See, B u k h ā r ī , Riqāq, 42; M u s l i m , Zuhd, 5; N a s ā ’ ī , Janā’iz, 52; M u s n a d , iii, 110.
2.  See, al-Ghazālī, I ḥ y ā ’  ‘ U l ū m   a l - D ī n , iv, 64; al-‘Ajlūnī, K a s h f   a l - K h a f ā ’ , ii, 368.

a garden, their images will appear in it. If the mirror is moved the tiniest 
amount or the smallest change occurs to it, the images become confused and 
distorted. The fact that the actual house, town or garden outside the mirror 
continue and are constant is of no avail to you, for the house in the mirror in 
your hand and your town and garden are only in the scale and proportions 
which the mirror gives you.

Your life is the mirror. The support and mirror of your world and its cen-
tre is your life. Every minute it is possible that the house, town, and garden 
will die and be destroyed, their condition is such that any minute they may 
collapse on your head and your doomsday will come. Since it is thus, do not 
burden this life and world of yours with loads they cannot raise and support!
Fourth Note
Know that it is generally the practice of the All-Wise Creator to return 
important  and  valuable  things  exactly  the  same.  That  is  to  say,  renewing 
most things in similar form in the alternating of the seasons and changing 
of the centuries, He returns the things of value and importance exactly. This 
law of divine practice is seen to be mostly unvarying in the resurrections of 
the days, years, and centuries.

In consequence of this constant law, we say: since according to the agree-
ment and testimony of science, man is the most perfect fruit of the tree of 
creation, and among creatures is the most important, and the most valuable, 
and since a human person is equivalent to a species of the other animals, it 
may be surmised with certainty that at the supreme resurrection, each human 
being will be returned exactly the same, with his body and all his attributes.
Fifth Note
Western science and civilization had to some extent a place in the Old 
Said’s thought, so when the New Said embarked on his journeys of the mind 
and the heart, they were transformed into sicknesses of the heart and were 
the cause of excessive difficulties. The New Said was therefore compelled to 
shake off from his mind that fallacious philosophy and dissolute civilization. 
In order to silence the emotions of his evil-commanding soul, which testi-
fied in favour of Europe, he was compelled to hold in his spirit the following 
discussion – which in one respect is very brief and in another is long – with 
the collective personality of Europe.

It should not be misunderstood; Europe is twofold. One follows the sci-
ences which serve justice and right and the industries beneficial for the life 

SEVENTEENTH FLASH

163

of society through the inspiration it has received from true Christianity; this 
first Europe I am not addressing. I am addressing the second corrupt Europe 
which,  due  to  the  darkness  of  the  philosophy  of  Naturalism  supposes  the 
evils  of  civilization  to  be  its  virtues,  and  has  driven  mankind  to  vice  and 
misguidance. As follows:

On my journey of the spirit at that time I said to Europe’s collective per-
sonality, which apart from beneficial science and the virtues of civilization, 
holds  in  its  hand  meaningless,  harmful  philosophy  and  noxious,  dissolute 
civilization:

Know this, O second Europe! You hold a diseased and misguided phi-
losophy in your right hand and a harmful and corrupt civilization in your 
left, and claim, “ Mankind’s happiness is with these two! ” May your two 
hands be broken and may these two filthy presents of yours be the death of 
you! And so they shall be!

O you unhappy spirit which spreads unbelief and ingratitude! Can a man 
who is suffering torments and is afflicted with ghastly calamities in both his 
spirit and his conscience and his mind and his heart be happy through his 
body wallowing in a superficial, deceptive glitter and wealth? Can it be said 
that he is happy?

Don’t you see that on feeling despair at some minor matter and his hope 
for some illusory wish being lost and his being disillusioned at some insig-
nificant business, such a person’s sweet imaginings become bitter for him, 
what is pleasant torments him, and the world constricts him and becomes a 
prison for him? But what happiness can you ensure for such a wretched per-
son who through your inauspiciousness has suffered the blows of misguid-
ance in the deepest corners of his heart to the very foundations of his spirit, 
and because of this whose hopes have all been extinguished and whose pains 
all arise from it? Can it be said of someone whose body is in a false and fleet-
ing paradise and whose heart and spirit are suffering the torments of Hell 
that he is happy? See, you have led astray wretched mankind in this way! 
You make them suffer the torments of Hell in a false heaven!

O evil-commanding soul of mankind! Consider the following compari-
son  and  see  where  you  have  driven  mankind.  For  example,  there  are  two 
roads  before  us.  We  take  one  of  them  and  see  that  at  every  step  is  some 
wretched, powerless person. Tyrants are attacking him, seizing his property 
and goods, and destroying his humble house. Sometimes they wound him as 
well. The heavens weep at his pitiful state. Wherever one looks, things are 
continuing in this vein. The sounds heard on this way are the roars of tyrants

and the groans of the oppressed; a universal mourning envelops the entire 
way. A person is afflicted with a boundless grief since due to his humanity 
man is pained at the suffering of others. But because his conscience cannot 
endure so much pain, one who travels this way is compelled to do one of two 
things: either he strips off his humanity and embracing a boundless savagery 
bears such a heart that so long as he is safe and sound, he is not affected even 
if all the rest of mankind perish, or else he suppresses the demands of the 
heart and reason.

O Europe corrupted with vice and misguidance and drawn far from the 
religion of Jesus! You have bestowed this hellish state on the human spirit 
with your blind genius which, like the Dajjal, 1 has only a single eye. 2 You 
afterwards understood that this incurable disease casts man down from the 
highest of the high to the lowest of the low, and reduces him to the basest 
level of animality. The only remedy you have found for it are the fantasies 
of entertainment and amusement and anodyne diversions which temporarily 
numb the senses. These remedies of yours are being the death of you, and 
so they shall be. There! The road you have opened up for mankind and the 
happiness you have given it resembles this comparison.

The second road, the All-Wise Qur’an has bestowed on mankind; it is 
like this: We see that in every stopping-place, every spot, every town are 
patrols of a Just Monarch’s equitable soldiers doing the rounds. From time 
to time at the King’s command a group of the soldiers is discharged. Their 
rifles, horses and gear belonging to the state are taken from them and they are 
given their leave papers. They are apparently sad to hand over their familiar 
rifles and horses, but in reality are happy to be discharged and extremely 
pleased to visit the Monarch and return to his court.

Sometimes the demobilization officials encounter a raw recruit who does 
not recognize them. “ Surrender your rifle!, ” they say. The soldier replies: 
“ I am a soldier of the King and I am in his service. I shall go to him later. 
Who  are  you?  If  you  come  with  His  permission  and  consent,  I  greet  you 
with pleasure, show me His orders. Otherwise go away and stay far from 
me. Even if I remain on my own and there are thousands of you, I shall still 
fight you, and it would not for myself, because I do not own myself; I belong 
to my King. Indeed, my self and the rifle I have now are in trust from my 
owner. I shall not submit to you because I have to safeguard the trust and 
defend my King’s honour and dignity! ”

This  situation  then  is  one  of  thousands  on  the  second  way  which  are 
the  cause  of  joy  and  happiness.  You  can  think  of  the  others  for  yourself. 
Throughout the journey there is the mobilization and despatch of troops with 
joy  and  celebrations  under  the  name  of  birth,  and  the  discharge  of  troops 
with cheer and military bands under the name of death. This road has been 
bestowed  on  mankind  by  the  All-Wise  Qur’an.  Whoever  accepts  the  gift 
wholeheartedly travels down it to happiness in this world and the next. He 
feels neither grief at the things of the past nor fear at those of the future.

O second corrupted Europe! A number of your rotten and baseless foun-
dations are as follows. You say: “ Every living being from the greatest angel 
to the tiniest fish owns itself and works for itself and struggles for its own 
pleasure. It has the right to life. Its aim and purpose and all its endeavour is 
to live and continue its life. ” And you declare idiotically: “ Life is conflict, ” 
because you suppose to be conflict the compassionate, munificent manifes-
tations of the universal law of the All-Generous Creator which is manifested 
through plants hastening to the assistance of animals and animals hastening 
to the assistance of man through a principle of mutual assistance, which is 
conformed to in perfect obedience by all the principal beings of the universe.
How can particles of food hastening with total eagerness to nourish the 
cells of the body – a manifestation of the principle of mutual assistance – be 
conflict? How can it be a clash and struggle? It is, rather, mutual help at the 
command of a Munificent Sustainer.

Another  of  your  rotten  foundations  is,  as  you  say:  “ Everything  owns 
itself. ” A clear proof that nothing owns itself is this: among causes the most 
noble and with regard to choice the one with the most extensive will is man. 
But  out  of  the  most  obvious  acts  connected  to  man’s  will  like  thinking, 
speaking,  and  eating,  only  a  hundredth  single,  doubtful,  part  is  subject  to 
his will and is within his power. So how can it be said that he owns himself?
If the highest beings with the most extensive will are thus inhibited from 
real power and ownership to this degree, someone who says that the rest of 
beings,  animate  and  inanimate,  own  themselves  merely  proves  that  he  is 
more animal than the animals and more lifeless and unconscious than inani-
mate beings.

What  pushes  you  to  make  such  an  error  and  casts  you  into  this  abyss 
is your one-eyed genius. That is, your extraordinary, ill-omened brilliance. 
Due to that blind genius of yours, you have forgotten your Sustainer, who 
is the the Creator of all things, you have attributed His works to imaginary 
nature and causes, you have divided up the Creator’s property among idols,

false gods. In regard to this and in the view of your genius, every living crea-
ture and every human being has to resist innumerable enemies on his own 
and struggle to procure his endless needs. They are compelled to do this with 
the power of a minute particle, a fine thread-like will, a fleeting flash-like 
consciousness, a fast extinguishing flame-like life, a life which passes in a 
minute. But the capital of those wretched animate creatures is insufficient to 
answer even one of the thousands of their demands. When smitten by disas-
ter, they can await no salve for their pain other than from deaf, blind causes. 
They manifest the meaning of the verse:

( 13:14 ) = < ; : 9 8
Your dark genius has transformed mankind’s daytime into night. And in 
order to warm that dark, distressing, unquiet night, you have only illumi-
nated men with deceptive, temporary lamps. Those lamps do not smile at 
them with joy, they rather smirk idiotically at their pitiful and lamentable 
state. Those lights mock and make fun of them.

In  the  view  of  your  pupils,  all  living  beings  are  miserable,  calamity-
striken, and subject to the assaults of oppressors. The world is a place of uni-
versal mourning. Issuing from it are cries and wails at death and suffering. 
The pupil who has absorbed your instruction thoroughly becomes a pharaoh. 
But he is an abject pharaoh who worships the basest things and holds him-
self to be lord over everything he reckons advantageous. A student of yours 
is obstinate, but an obstinate wretch who accepts utter abasement for a sin-
gle pleasure. He is so despicable as to kiss Satan’s foot for some worthless 
benefit. And he is a bully. But because he has nothing in his heart on which 
to rely, he is an impotent bullying braggart. His whole aim and endeavour is 
to satisfy the lusts of his soul, to cunningly seek his own personal interests 
under the screen of patriotism and devotion, and work to satisfy his ambition 
and pride. He loves seriously nothing at all other than himself and sacrifices 
everything for his own sake. 

As  for  the  sincere,  wholehearted  student  of  the  Qur’an,  he  is  a  wor-
shipping  servant.  But  he  is  an  esteemed  servant  who  does  not  stoop  to 
bow in worship before even the mightiest of creatures, and does not make 
the  supreme  benefit  of  Paradise  the  aim  of  his  worship.  And  he  is  mild 
and  gentle,  but  at  the  same  time  noble  and  gracious  and  lowers  himself 
before none but the All-Glorious Creator, and only stoops before the lowly 
with  His  permission  and  at  His  command.  And  he  is  needy,  but  due  to 
the  reward  his  All-Generous  Owner  is  storing  up  for  him  in  the  future,

167

he is at the same time self-sufficient. And he is weak, but he is strong in his 
weakness for he relies on the strength of his Lord whose power is infinite. 
Would the Qur’an make its true student take this fleeting, transient world 
as his aim and purpose while not making him have even eternal Paradise 
as  his  goal?  Thus  you  can  understand  how  the  two  students’  aims  and 
endeavours differ from one another.

You  can  further  compare  the  zeal  and  self-sacrifice  of  the  All-Wise 

Qur’an’s students with the pupils of sick philosophy as follows:

The student of philosophy flees from his brother for his own sake and a 
files a lawsuit against him. Whereas, looking on all the righteous worship-
pers in the heavens and on the earth as brothers, the Qur’an’s student makes 
supplication for them in sincere fashion. He is happy at their happiness and 
he feels a powerful connection with them in his spirit, so that praying he

things, the divine throne and the sun, to be subservient officials, and servants 
and creatures like himself.

ّمُ(cid:183)ٰ

Also, compare in the following the loftiness and expansion of spirit of 
the two students: the Qur’an imparts such a joyous elevation to its students’ 
spirits that instead of the ninety-nine prayer-beads, it places in their hands 
the minute particles of ninety-nine worlds displaying the manifestations of 
the ninety-nine divine names, and tells them to recite their invocations with 
them. Listen to the invocations of such students of the Qur’an as Shah Gey-
lani, Rufa’i, and Shazali ( May Allah be pleased with them )! See, in their 
fingers are the strings of particles, the droplets of water, the breaths of all 
creatures,  and  recite  their  invocations  with  them.  They  praise  and  glorify 
Allah with them and mention His most beautiful names.

Behold the miraculous instruction of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposi-
tion and see how man is elevated by it – insignificant man who is stunned 
and confused at some minor grief or tiny sorrow and is defeated by a micro-
scopic germ. How his inner senses expand so that the beings in the mighty 
world  appear  inadequate  as  prayer-beads  for  his  invocations.  He  consid-
ers Paradise to be insufficient as the aim of his invocations and recitations 
of the divine names, yet he does not see himself as superior to the lowest 
of Almighty Allah’s creatures.  1 He combines the utmost dignity with the 
utmost  humility.  You  can  see  from  this  how  abject  and  base  are  philoso-
phy’s students.

THE FLASHES

Thus, the guidance of the Qur’an – which looks at the two worlds with 
two shining eyes familiar with the Unseen and points with two hands to the 
two happinesses for mankind – says concerning the truths which the one-
eyed genius proceeding from the sick philosophy of Europe sees wrongly:

O man! The self and property you hold is not yours; it is in trust to you. 
The owner of the trust is an All-Compassionate and Munificent One, power-
ful over all things and with knowledge of all things. He wants to buy from 
you His property you hold so that He can guard it for you and it will not be 
lost. He will give you a good price for it in the future. You are a soldier under 
orders and charged with duties. Work in His name and act on His account, 
for He sends you the things you need as sustenance and protects you from 
the things you are unable to bear. The aim and result of this life of yours is to 
manifest your Owner’s names and attributes. When a calamity comes your 
way, say:

( 2:156 ) G F E D C
That is to say, “ I am in the service of my Owner, O calamity! If you have 
come  with  His  permission  and  consent,  greetings,  you  are  welcome!  For 
anyway some time we shall return to Him and enter His presence, and we 
yearn for Him. Since He will release us from the responsibilities of life, let 
the release and discharge be at your hand, O calamity, I consent to it. But 
if He has decreed your coming as a trial for my dutifulness and loyalty in 
preserving my trust, then without His permission and consent to surrender it 
to you, so long as I have the power, I will not surrender my Owner’s trust to 
one not certainly charged to receive it. ”

Consider this one example out of a thousand and see the degrees in the 
instruction given by the genius of philosophy and guidance of the Qur’an. In 
reality, the two sides proceed in the manner described above, but the degrees 
of people in guidance and misguidance differ, and the degrees of heedless-
ness differ. Not everyone can perceive completely this truth in every degree, 
because heedlessness numbs the senses. In the present age it has so deadened 
them that the civilized do not feel this grievous pain and suffering. However, 
sensitivity is increasing and rending the veil of heedlessness due to develop-
ments in science and the warnings of death which every day displays thirty 
thousand corpses. Utter abhorrence and a thousand regrets should be felt for 
those who take the way of misguidance due to the Europeans’ idols and the 
natural sciences, and for those who follow them in blind imitation!

O sons of this land! Do not try to imitate Europeans! How can you rea-
sonably trust in and follow the vice and invalid, worthless thought of Europe

after the boundless tyranny and enmity it has shown you? No! No! You who 
imitate them in dissoluteness are not following them but unconsciously join-
ing their ranks and putting to death both yourselves and your brothers. Know 
that the more you follow them in immorality the more you lie in claiming 
to be patriots! Because to follow them in this way is to hold your nation in 
contempt, to hold the nation up to ridicule!

Sixth Note
O you unhappy person who is alarmed at the great numbers of the unbe-
lievers and their agreement in denying some of the truths of belief, and as 
a result is shaken in his faith! You should know that value and importance 
do not lie in quantity and number. For if man is not a true human being, he 
is transformed into a diabolical animal, and the more he increases in animal 
greed, the more animal he becomes – like some Europeans and their imita-
tors. You can see that in number, men are extremely few in comparison to 
the countless animals, and yet they are sovereign rulers over all the animal 
species and vicegerents of the earth. 

The harmful unbelievers and those depraved wretches who follow in their 
way are a vicious species among Almighty Allah’s animals which the All-
Wise Maker has created for the development and prosperity of the world. 
He has made them a unit of measurement in order to make known to His 
believing servants the degrees of the bounties He has bestowed on them, and 
finally will consign those animals to the Hell they deserve.

There is no power in the unbelievers and misguided denying or disput-
ing any truth of belief. Their agreement lacks power; a thousand deniers are 
equal to one denier. Even if the whole population of Istanbul, for example, 
denies seeing the new moon at the beginning of Ramadan, the proven testi-
mony of two witnesses invalidates that great multitude’s negation and agree-
ment. 1 In reality unbelief and misguidance are negation and denial, so are 
ignorance and non-existence, and the agreement of large numbers of unbe-
lievers even has no significance. 2 Since matters of belief are true and estab-
lished, and their validity is proven, the judgement of two believers based on 
certain witnessing takes preference and prevails over the agreement of those 
vast numbers of the misguided. The reason for this is as follows:

Superficially, the claims of those who deny are the same but in fact they 
are diverse and cannot unite and so gain strength. While the claims of those 
who  affirm  unite  and  receive  strength  from  each  other.  This  is  because  a 
person who does not see the new moon of Ramadan in the sky says: “ In my 
view, there is no moon. It has not appeared that I can see. ” And another says: 
“ In my view, the moon has not appeared. ” And so does another. Each says 
that in his view, there is no moon. Since the view of each is different, and 
the causes that prevent them seeing it may also be different, their claims are 
all different as well; each claim cannot reinforce the other claims. But those 
who are affirming it are not saying: “ In my view and opinion the new moon 
is  there, ”  but,  “ The  new  moon  has  actually  appeared  in  the  sky. ”  Those 
who sight it all make the same claim and say: “ In actuality... ” That is to say, 
all the claims are the same. But since the views of those who are denying 
it are all different, their claims also are different. They are not making the 
judgement according to what actually is. Because a negation of what actu-
ally pertains cannot be proved; for that, an all-embracing proof is necessary.

1 Yes, if you claim that a particular thing exists in the world, it is enough to 
merely point that thing out. But if you say it does not exist and you deny it, 
the whole world has to be sifted through in order to demonstrate it so that 
the denial can be proved. It is in consequence of this that the unbelievers 
denying a truth is like solving a problem or passing through a narrow hole 
or jumping over a ditch; it makes no difference whether there is one man 
or a thousand, because they cannot help one another. But since those who 
affirm look at the heart of the matter and reality of the situation, their claims 
unite and the individual strength of each of them combines and assists all. It 
resembles lifting a great boulder: the more hands there are, the stronger they 
are and the easier it becomes.

conscience is completely corrupted and he becomes like poison in the life 
of society. It is because of this that according to the science of the principles 
of religion, “ The apostate forfeits the right to life, whereas if an unbeliever 
is a member of the protected minorities or he makes peace, he has the right 
to life; ” this is a principle of the Shari‘a.  1 Furthermore, according to the 
Hanafi school, the testimony of such an unbeliever is acceptable, 2 whereas 
the testimony of someone who has strayed from the path of the Shari‘a is 
rejected. For he is perfidious. 3

O miserable sinner who has deviated from Shari‘a! Do not look at the 
multitude of the dissolute and be deceived; do not say: “ Most people think 
the same as me! ” For the depraved do not want to embrace depravity; they 
rather fall into it and cannot extricate themselves. There is no sinner who 
does not want to be righteous and who does not want to see his superior and 
chief as religious. Other than if – I seek refuge with Allah! – his conscience 
is corrupted through apostasy and he receives pleasure from poisoning, like 
a snake.

O crazy head and corrupted heart! Do you suppose that Muslims do not 
love the world, or that they do not think about the poverty into which they 
have fallen, and that they are in need of admonishment so that they do not 
forget their share of the world?

Your supposition is false, your surmise, wrong. Their greed has increased; 
that  is  the  reason  they  are  impoverished.  Because  for  Muslims,  greed

Yes, there are many things calling and driving man to the world, like his 
soul and its appetites, and need, and his senses and emotions, and the Devil, 
and the superficial enticement of the world, and false friends like you. While 
those who call to the hereafter, which lasts for ever, and to long-lasting eter-
nal life, are few. If you are patriotic even to the tiniest degree towards this 
nation and the high aspirations you brag about are not lies, you should help 
the few who call to eternal life. For if you silence them and help the many, 
you will be befriending Satan!

Do you suppose this nation’s poverty is the result of a sort of religious 
asceticism or of laziness arising from abandoning the world? You are wrong

to suppose that. Do you not see that the nations dominated by Europe, such 
as  China  and  the  Brahmins  and  Zoroastrians  of  India,  and  the  blacks  of 
Africa are poorer than we are? And do you not see that nothing apart from 
the most basic subsistence is left in the hands of Muslims? The rest is either 
stolen or seized by the European infidel tyrants or the dissemblers of Asia.

You should be certain that if your intention in forcibly driving the people 
of belief to degenerate civilization in this way is the country’s law and order 
and easy administration, you are mistaken and you are driving them down 
the  wrong  path.  For  it  is  more  difficult  to  govern  a  hundred  degenerates 
whose belief is shaken and morals corrupted, and to maintain public security 
among them, than to govern thousands of the righteous.

Thus, according to these principles, the people of Islam are not in need of 
being encouraged and driven to the world and to greed. Progress and public 
order cannot be secured in that way. They are rather in need of having their 
working conditions set in order, of security being established among them, 
and  of  having  the  principle  of  co-operation  encouraged.  And  these  needs 
can be brought about through the sacred commands of religion, and fear of 
Allah, and firm adherence to religion.

Eighth Note
O idle man who is unaware of the pleasure of effort and happiness of 
work! Know that out of His perfect munificence, Almighty Allah placed 
the reward for work within it. He included the wage for work within the 
work  itself.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  in  their  particular  duties,  which  are 
called  creative  commands,  animate  beings,  and  even  from  one  point  of 
view inanimate creatures, conform to the dominical commands with com-
plete  eagerness  and  a  sort  of  pleasure.  Everything  from  bees,  flies,  and 
chickens to the sun and the moon carry out their duties with perfect pleas-
ure. This means there is an enjoyment in their work so that they perform 
it  perfectly,  although  they  do  not  think  of  the  results  since  they  do  not 
possess intelligence.

If  you  ask:  “ Living  creatures  have  the  ability  to  receive  pleasure,  but 

how can inanimate beings experience eagerness and enjoyment? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  Inanimate beings desire and seek a position, a rank, per-
fection, beauty, and order, not on their own accounts but on account of the 
divine  names  manifested  on  them.  They  become  illumined  and  progress 
because  in  performing  their  natural  duties,  they  become  like  mirrors  and 
places of reflection of the names of the Light of Lights.

For example, if, although they are unimportant and of themselves with-
out  light,  a  droplet  of  water  or  fragment  of  glass  are  turned  with  their 
pure hearts to the sun, they become thrones to the sun and smile at you. 
Similarly, by being mirrors in respect of their duties towards the names of 
the All-Glorious One, who possesses absolute beauty and perfection, par-
ticles and beings rise from a very lowly position to a most elevated degree 
of manifestation and illumination like the droplet and fragment of glass. 
Since  they  rise  to  a  luminous  and  exalted  rank  by  virtue  of  their  duties, 
it may be said that if it is possible and they have the capacity to receive 
pleasure, that is, if they receive a share of general life, they perform their 
duties with perfect pleasure.

For  clear  evidence  of  the  pleasure  to  be  found  in  the  performance  of 
duties  consider  your  own  members  and  emotions.  Each  receives  different 
pleasures in performing the duties connected to your personal survival and 
the survival of the human race. The duties themselves are a means of enjoy-
ment for them, and to give up a duty is a sort of torment for a member.

Further clear evidence is the self-sacrifice and courage which such ani-
mals  as  cocks  and  hens  with  chicks  display  in  performing  their  duties: 
even  if  hungry,  the  cock  prefers  the  hens  to  itself,  summoning  them  to 
feed. It does not peck up the food itself but allows them to do so. And it is 
clear that it feels pleasure, pride and enjoyment in carrying out this duty. 
This  means  it  receives  greater  pleasure  from  carrying  out  the  duty  than 
from feeding. The hen too, which shepherds its chicks,  will sacriﬁce its 
life for them, throwing itself at a dog. It will also remain hungry and give 
them grain. That is to say, it receives such pleasure in its duty that it makes 
preferable the pains of hunger and pangs of death.

Animal  mothers  receive  pleasure  in  trying  to  protect  their  young,  it  is 
their duty when the young are small. When the young are grown, the duty 
ceases and so does the pleasure. The mothers beat their offspring and take 
the grains of feed from them. Only, for human mothers the duties continue 
for some time, for due to their weakness and impotence humans are always 
children in one respect, and are all the time in need of compassion.

Consider the males and females of the animal species, like the mother 
hen and the cock, which acts as shepherd, and understand that they do not 
perform these duties on their own account, in their own names, or for their 
own perfections. For if they have to sacrifice their lives in the course of their 
duties, they do so. They rather perform them on account of the Munificent 
Bestower of Bounties, the All-Glorious Creator, Who employs them in their 
duties, in which, through His mercy, He includes pleasure.

Further evidence that the wage is present in the duty itself is this: plants 
and  trees  conform  to  the  Glorious  Creator’s  commands  in  a  manner  that 
implies eagerness and pleasure. For the fragrant scents they disperse, and 
their being adorned with decorations that attract the glances of their custom-
ers, and their sacrificing themselves for their shoots and fruits until they rot, 
shows to the attentive that they receive such pleasure in conforming to the 
divine commands that it rots and destroys them.

Look, fruit-bearing trees like the coconut, which bears so many cans of 
milk on its head, and the fig, request through the tongue of disposition the 
finest food like milk from the treasury of mercy; they receive it and give it to 
their fruits to eat, while they content themselves with muddy water.

In seeds also a longing is clearly apparent in their duty of germinating 
and  sending  out  shoots.  Like  someone  imprisoned  in  a  constricted  place 
longs to go out into a garden or open space, such a longing, such a joyful 
state, is also apparent in seeds, in their duty of sprouting.

It is because of this long and mysterious principle, which is in force in the 
universe and is called a divine practice, that those idle, lazy people who live 
in ease and affluence for the most part suffer more distress than those who 
strive and work. For the idle always complain about their lives and want to 
pass them quickly by indulging in amusements. Whereas the one who works 
and strives is thankful and offers praise and does not want his life to pass

principle. It is also for this reason that the saying “ Ease lies in hardship, and 
hardship in ease ” has become proverbial.

Indeed, if inanimate creatures are studied carefully, it will be seen that 
on  their  undeveloped  innate  capacities  and  abilities  expanding  from  the 
potential to the actual through great effort and exertion, a state similar to the 
above-mentioned divine practice comes about. This shows that the natural 
duty produces an eagerness and pleasure. If the inanimate creature partakes 
of general life, the eagerness is its own; otherwise it pertains to the thing 
which represents and supervises the creature. It may even be said that when 
subtle, delicate water receives the command to freeze, it conforms with such 
intense eagerness that it may split iron, breaking it into pieces. That is to 
say, in conveying the dominical command of “ Expand! ” with the tongue 
of freezing sub-zero temperature to the water in a closed iron container, it 
breaks the container with its intense eagerness. It splits the iron and itself 
becomes ice.

You can make analogies with this for everything. From the rotations of 
the suns and their peregrinations to the Mevlevi-like spinning and turning 
and vibrations of minute particles, all striving and motion in the universe 
turns on the law of divine determining and proceeds from the hand of divine 
power  and  is  manifested  through  the  creative  command  which  comprises 
divine will, knowledge, and command.

Each particle, each creature, each living being, even, resembles a soldier 
who has different relations with all the sections of the army and different 
duties that look to each; all particles and living beings are similar to this. For 
example, a particle in your eye has a relation with the cells of the eye, with 
the eye itself, the facial nerves, and the blood vessels of the body; and it has 
duties arising from those relations, and yields benefits in accordance with 
those duties. And so on, you can compare everything with this. Thus, eve-
rything testifies to the Necessary Existence of the Pre-Eternal All-Powerful 
One in two respects: 

The First: By carrying out duties far exceeding its own power, every-
thing testiﬁes through the tongue of absolute impotence to the All-Powerful 
One’s existence.

The Second: By acting in conformity with the laws that form the order 
of the world and principles that perpetuate the balance of beings, everything 
testifies to that All-Knowing and All-Powerful One. For lifeless things like 
particles, and tiny animals like bees cannot know order and balance, which 
are  the  subtle  matters  of  the  Clear  Book.  How  can  a  lifeless  particle  and 
tiny bee read the subtle, significant matters of the Clear Book, which is in 
the hand of the All-Glorious One, who opens and closes and gathers up the 
levels of the heavens as though they were the pages of a notebook? If you 
crazily suppose the particle possesses an eye capable of reading the fine let-
ters of that book, you can try to refute the particle’s testimony!

Yes, the All-Wise Creator summarizes the principles of the Clear Book 
in most beautiful form and abbreviated fashion and with a particular pleas-
ure and through a special need, and includes them in beings. If everything 
acts thus with a particular pleasure out of a particular need, it unknowingly 
conforms to the principles of the Clear Book. For example, the minute the 
mosquito with its proboscis comes into the world, it emerges from its house, 
and  without  hesitation  attacks  man’s  face;  it  strikes  it  with  its  long  staff 
causing the water of life to spurt out, and it drinks it. It shows the skill of a 
practised warrior in dodging the blows directed at it. Who taught the tiny, 
inexperienced, newly-born creature the science of war and art of extracting

water? Where did it learn it? I, that is, this unfortunate Said, confess that if 
I had been in the place of that mosquito with its proboscis, I could only have 
learnt this art, this warfare of attack and retreat, this extracting of water, only 
after lengthy instruction and much experience.

Compare with the mosquito animals like the bee, who receives inspira-
tion, the spider, and the nightingale, who weaves his nest like a stocking, 
then compare plants to these animals in just the same way. Yes, the Abso-
lutely Generous One ( May His glory be exalted ) has given each living being 
a memorandum written with the pen of pleasure and ink of need, and with 
it has deposited in the being the programme of His creative commands and 
index  of  its  duties.  See  how  the  All-Wise  One  of  Glory  has  written  on  a 
receipt the amount concerning the bee’s duties, from the principles of the 
Clear Book, and placed it in the coffer in the bee’s head. And the key to the 
coffer is the pleasure particular to the diligent bee. With it, it opens the cof-
fer, reads the programme, understands the command, and acts. It proclaims 
the meaning of the verse,

Of the thousands of merits of worship, consider only the following: the 
Prophet  ( UWBP )  unites  the  hearts  of  the  affirmers  of  divine  unity  in  the 
prayers of the Festivals and of Friday, and worship performed in congrega-
tion.  He  brings  together  their  tongues  in  a  single  phrase  so  that  one  man 
responds to the sublime address of the Pre-Eternally Worshipped One with 
the  voices,  supplications,  and  invocations  uttered  by  innumerable  hearts 
and tongues. Strengthening one another, assisting one another and uniting, 
those voices, supplications, and invocations display so expansive a worship 
before the Godhead of the Pre-Eternal All-Worshipped One that the globe 
of the earth as though recites the invocations, offers the supplications, and 
performs the prayers with its regions, and conforms with its climes to the 
command of   l k ( 2:43 )  which was revealed with glory and tre-
mendousness from beyond the heavens. Through this mystery of unity, man, 
a miniscule, powerless creature in the universe like a particle, by virtue of 
the  vastness  of  worship  becomes  a  beloved  servant  of  the  Creator  of  the 
Heavens and the Earth, vicegerent of the earth, the earth’s ruler and chief of 
the animals, and the result and aim of the universe’s creation.

Yes, if the voices of hundreds of millions of people proclaiming “ Allah 
is Most Great! ” after the five daily prayers, and particularly in the Festival 
Prayers, unite in the Manifest World as they do in the World of the Unseen, 
the globe in its entirety becomes a huge human being. Since the “ Allah is 
Most Great! ” it proclaims with a mighty voice is equal to its own greatness, 
the believers in divine unity proclaiming “ Allah is Most Great! ” at the same 
instant in unison becomes a mighty “ Allah is Most Great! ” uttered by the 
earth. The earth is as though shaken with a great tremor with the invocations 
and glorifications of the World of Islam at the Festival Prayers. Proclaiming 
“ Allah is Most Great! ” with all its regions and climes, it forms its inten-
tion with the pure heart of the Ka‘ba, its q i b l a , and on its uttering “ Allah is 
Most Great! ” with the tongue of Mount Arafat in the mouth of Mecca, that 
single phrase assumes a form in the air in the cave-like mouths of the believ-
ers in all parts of the earth. Just as through the echo of the words “ Allah is 
Most Great! ” innumerable “ Allah is Most Great’s ” come into being, so too 
that acceptable recitation and invocation causes the heavens to ring out and 
resounds rising and falling in the Intermediate Realms.

We praise and glorify and exalt to the number of the particles of the earth 
the All-Glorious One, Who made the earth thus prostrate to Him in worship, 
glorifying  and  exalting  Him,  and  made  it  a  mosque  for  His  servants  and

cradle for His creatures. And we offer praise to Him to the number of beings 
that He made us members of the community of His Noble Messenger ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ), who taught us worship of this kind.

Know,  O  heedless,  confused  Said!  If  you  are  to  attain  to  the  light  of 
knowledge  of  Allah  and  look  on  it,  and  are  to  see  its  manifestations  in 
the mirrors of signs and witnesses, and behold its proofs and evidences, 
you  should  not  examine  it  with  the  fingers  of  criticism.  You  should  not 
examine critically every light that passes over you or occurs to your heart 
or appears to your mind, or criticize it with the hand of hesitation. Do not 
stretch out your hand to catch hold of a light that appears to you! Rather 
withdraw from the things that cause heedlessness, be turned to the light, 
and wait. For I have observed that the witnesses and proofs of knowledge 
of Allah are of three sorts:

One  Sort  is  like  water.  It  is  visible  and  palpable,  but  cannot  be  held 
with the fingers. For this sort, one has to detach oneself from illusions and 
submerge oneself in it as a whole. It cannot be spied on with the fingers of 
criticism; if it is, it flows away and is lost. The water of life cannot make the 
finger its dwelling!

The Second Sort is like air. It may be perceived, but it is neither visible 
nor may it be held. You should turn towards it with your face, your mouth, 
your spirit, and hold yourself before that breeze of mercy. But do not stretch 
out the hand of criticism towards it, for you will be unable to hold it. Breathe 
it with your spirit. If you look on it with the eye of hesitation and lay hands 
on it by criticizing it, it will escape you and depart. It will not make your 
hand its dwelling; it would never be content with it! 

As for the Third Sort, it is like light. It is visible, but is neither palpable 
nor may it be held. So you should hold yourself before it with the heart’s eye 
and spirit’s vision; you should direct your gaze towards it and wait. Perhaps 
it will come of its own accord. For light cannot be held in the hand or hunted 
with the fingers; it can be chased only with the light of insight and intuition. 
If you stretch out a grasping, physical hand and weigh it on material scales, 
even if it is not extinguished, it will hide itself. For just as such light will not 
be consent to be imprisoned in matter, so it cannot be restricted, nor will it 
accept dense things as its lord and master.

Know  that  there  is  much  kindness  and  compassion  in  the  Qur’an  of 
Miraculous Exposition’s manner of expression, for the majority of those it 
addresses are ordinary people. Their minds are simple so to flatter them it 
repeats the signs inscribed on the face of the heavens and earth, since their 
vision  does  not  penetrate  to  fine  things.  It  facilitates  the  reading  of  those 
large letters. For example, it teaches signs that are clearly apparent and eas-
ily read, like the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the rain being 
made to fall from the sky, and the raising to life of the earth. It rarely directs 
attention to the subtle signs written in small letters among the large ones lest 
ordinary people experience difficulty in reading them.

There  is  an  eloquence,  fluency,  and  naturalness  in  the  Qur’an’s  styles 
whereby it is like a h â f ı z ; it recites the verses inscribed with the pen of power 
on the pages of the universe. It is as though the Qur’an is the recitation of the 
book of the universe and the verbal expression of its order, and reads out the 
Pre-Eternal Inscriber’s attributes and writes His acts and deeds. If you want 
to see this eloquence of expression, listen with an aware and attentive heart 
to decrees like Sura ‘Ammā 1 and the verse, ( 3:26 ) Z Y X W 

Twelfth Note
O my friends who are listening to these notes! You should know that the 
reason I sometimes write down my heart’s prayers, entreaties, and supplica-
tions to my Sustainer, which ought to be secret, is to request divine mercy 
to accept the words of my writing when death has silenced the words of my 
tongue. Yes, my short-lived tongue’s repentance and regret is insufficient 
to atone for my numberless sins. The tongue of writing is permanent to an 
extent, and more effectual. Thus, thirteen years ago, 2 when as the result of a 
tumultuous storm of the spirit the laughter of the Old Said was being trans-
formed into the weeping of the New Said – at a time I awoke from the heed-
less sleep of youth in the morning of old age – I wrote these entreaties and 
supplications in Arabic. The Turkish meaning of a part of them is as follows: 
O my Compassionate Sustainer and Munificent Creator! Due to my mis-
taken choices my life and youth are lost and gone, and all that remains to 
me as their fruits are grievous sins, abasing sorrows, and misguiding doubts 
and scruples. I draw close to the grave shame-faced with this heavy load and

sick heart. Like my departed friends, peers, and relations, without deviating 
to left or right I am involuntarily approaching the door of the grave.

The grave is the first stopping-place on the road leading from this fleeting 
realm to everlasting separation and all eternity; it is the first door opening 
onto  it.  1  But  I  am  attached  to  the  realm  of  this  world  and  am  captivated 
by it, and I have understood with absolute certainty that it is transient and 
will die, will perish and depart. The beings within it travel on convoy after 
convoy and disappear, as is to be observed. This world is exceedingly cruel 
and treacherous, especially for those like me with evil-commanding souls. 
For one pleasure, it inflicts a thousand pains. For a single grape, it deals a 
hundred slaps.

O my Compassionate Sustainer and Munificent Creator! As with the say-

mounted the bier, bade farewell to my friends. Approaching my grave I call 
out to the court of Your mercy through the mute tongue of my corpse and the 
articulate tongue of my spirit: “ Mercy! Mercy! Most Kind, Most Clement! 
Deliver me from the shame of my sins! ”

Now  I  have  reached  the  brink  of  my  grave.  I  am  standing  at  the  head 
of my corpse stretched out beside it. Raising my head to the court of Your 
mercy, I cry out beseechingly with all my strength: “ Mercy! Mercy! Most 
Clement! Most Kind! Deliver me from the heavy burden of my sins! ”

Now I have entered my grave, I am wrapped in my shroud. Those who 
came to send me on my way have left me alone and departed. I await Your 
forgiveness and mercy. I see clearly that other than You there is no place of 
refuge or succour. I cry out with all my strength at the ugly face of sin, the 
savage form of rebellion against Allah, at the narrowness of the place:

“ Mercy!  Mercy!  Most  Merciful  One!  Most  Clement!  Most  Kind!  Just 
Judge! Deliver me from the companionship of my ugly sins! Broaden my 
place! My Allah! Your mercy is my recourse. Your Beloved, the Mercy to 
All the Worlds, the means to Your mercy. I complain, not about You, but 
about my soul and my state. 

“ O  my  Munificent  Creator  and  Compassionate  Sustainer!  Your  crea-
ture and servant called Said is both rebellious, and impotent, and heedless, 
and ignorant, and sick, and base, and a sinner, and aged, and a wrongdoer,

Most Merciful of the Merciful. If You do not accept me, whose door can I

Although those who strive on the way of truth should think only of their 
own duties, they think of those that pertain to Almighty Allah, base their 
actions on them, and fall into error. It is written in the work  A d a b   a l - D i n  
w a ’ l - D u n y a , that one time Satan tempted Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ) saying: 
“ The appointed hour of death and all things are specified by divine deter-
mining, so throw yourself down from this high place, and see, you’ll die. ” 
ّنِا 
Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ) replied: ُهَ
1 That is, “ Almighty Allah tests his servant, saying to him: If you do that I 
shall do this. Let’s see, are you able to do it? But the servant does not have 
the right and power to test Almighty Allah and say: If I do that, will You 
do this? To assume such a stance, as though subjecting Almighty Allah’s 
dominicality to test and examination, is bad conduct and contrary to worship 
and man’s being Allah’s slave. ” Since this is the case, man should do his 
own duty and not interfere in Almighty Allah’s business.

war, his ministers and followers told him: “ You will be victorious; Almighty 
Allah will make you victor. ” He replied: “ I am charged by Allah’s command 
to act on the way of j i h a d, I do not interfere in Allah’s concerns. To make us 
victor or vanquished is His business. ” Because he thus understood the mys-
tery of submission, he was wondrously victorious on numerous occasions.

In his voluntary actions man should not think of the results which pertain 
to  Almighty  Allah.  For  example,  for  some  of  our  brothers,  when  people 
join the R i s a l e - i   N u r  it fires their enthusiasm and makes them increase their 
efforts. Then when others do not listen, the weak ones among them become 
demoralized and their enthusiasm wanes somewhat. Whereas Allah’s Noble 
Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) , who was the Absolute 
Master, Universal Leader, and Perfect Guide, took as his absolute guide the 
divine decree,  9 8 7 6 5 ( 24:54 )  and when people held back and 
did  not  listen,  conveyed  the  message  with  greater  effort,  endeavour,  and 
earnestness. For in accordance with the verse,

( 28:56 ) h g f e d c b a ` _
he  understood  that  making  people  listen  and  guiding  them  was  Almighty 
Allah’s concern. And he did not interfere in Allah’s concerns.

And so, my brothers! You shouldn’t be officious either by basing your 
actions  on  what  is  not  your  business,  or  take  up  a  position  testing  your 
Creator!

The Second Matter

The Second Matter

Worship and servitude of Allah look to the divine command and divine 
pleasure.  The  reason  for  worship  is  the  divine  command  and  its  result  is 
divine pleasure. Its fruits and benefits look to the hereafter. But so long as 
they are not the ultimate reason and not intentionally sought, benefits look-
ing to this world and fruits which come about themselves and are given are 
not contrary to worship. They are rather to encourage the weak and make 
them  incline  to  worship.  If  those  fruits  and  benefits  are  made  the  reason 
for the invocation or recitation, or a part of the reason, it in part invalidates 
the worship. Indeed, it renders the meritorious invocation fruitless, and pro-
duces no results.

Thus, those who do not understand this mystery, recite for example the 
Aw r ā d   Q u d s i y y a   S h ā h   N a q s h b a n d ,  which  yields  a  hundred  benefits  and 
merits, or the J a w s h a n   a l - K a b ī r , which yields a thousand, making some of 
those benefits their prime intention. Then they do not receive the benefits,

and shall not receive them, and do not deserve to receive them. For the ben-
efits may not be the reason for the invocation and may not themselves be 
intended and sought. For they are obtained when unsought, in consequence 
of the sincere invocation, as a favour. If they are intended, it damages the 
sincerity to an extent. Indeed, it ceases being worship and loses all value. 
But there is one matter, which is that weak people need something to encour-
age them to recite meritorious invocations. If they think of the benefits and 
eagerly recite them purely for Allah’s sake and for the hereafter, it causes no 
harm and is acceptable even. But because this instance of wisdom has not 
been understood, many of them come to doubt or even to deny the benefits 
narrated from the spiritual poles and righteous ones of former generations 
when they do not receive them.

Each of the divine names has manifestations like a sun, from the heart to 
the divine throne. The heart too is a throne, but it cannot say: “ I am like the 
divine throne. ”

Thus, those who proceed reluctantly and with pride instead of knowing 
their  impotence,  poverty,  faults,  and  defects,  and  prostrating  entreatingly 
before the divine court, which form the basis of worship, hold their minis-
cule hearts equal to the divine throne. They confuse their droplet-like sta-
tions with the ocean-like stations of the saints. They stoop to artificiality, 
false  display,  and  meaningless  self-advertisement  in  order  to  make  them-
selves fitting for those high ranks and to hold them, and cause themselves 
many difficulties.

THE FLASHES

That is to say, the only means of salvation and deliverance is sincerity. It is 
of the greatest importance to gain sincerity. The tiniest act performed with 
sincerity is preferable to tons performed without sincerity. 1 A person should 
understand that what gains sincerity for his actions is his doing them purely 
because they are a divine command and that their result is divine pleasure, 
and he should not interfere in Allah’s business.

There is sincerity in everything. A jot of love, even, with sincerity is supe-
rior to tons of official love for which return is wanted. Someone described 
this sincere love as follows: 

  2   ُباَوَ(cid:102) ِهْ(cid:193)َ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) ى ٰ(cid:155)ْ(cid:93)ُ(cid:192) ىًوَ(cid:182)  ٌف(cid:193) ِ(cid:151) َ(cid:138)    ًةَو ْ(cid:130)ُر  ّ

Sincere love has been lodged in human nature and in all mothers. The com-
passion of mothers manifests this sincere love in its true meaning. Evidence 
that through the mystery of this compassion mothers do not want or seek a 
reward or bribe for their love of their children, is their readiness to sacrifice 
their lives and even their eternal happiness for them. All a hen’s capital is its 
life, and one hen sacrificed its head in order to save its chick’s head from the 
jaws of a dog – as Hüsrev witnessed.

The Fourth Matter

The Fourth Matter

One  should  not  accept  bounties  which  arrive  at  the  hands  of  apparent 
causes on account of the causes. If a cause like an animal or a tree does not 
possess will, it gives the bounty directly on account of Almighty Allah. It

ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) and take it for Allah’s sake. If the cause possesses

says: ِ
too should say: ِ
will, he should say:  ِ
refuse it. Apart from its explicit meaning, the verse,

( 6:121 ) W V U T S R Q P
has an implicit meaning: Do not partake of bounties that do not recall the 
True Bestower of Bounties and are not given in His name. 

Since this is so, both the one who gives and the one who receives should 
say ِ
ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) 
ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) If the giver does not say it and you are in need, you say, ِ
and seeing the hand of divine mercy upon him, kiss it in thanks, and take 
the bounty from him. That is to say, look from the bounty to the bestowal,

and from the bestowal think of the True Bestower. To reflect in this way is a 
sort of thanks. Then if you wish, offer a prayer for the apparent means, since 
it was by his hand that the bounty was sent to you.

What deceives those who worship apparent causes is the two things com-
ing together or being together, which is called ‘association;’ they suppose 
the two things cause one another. Also, since the non-existence of one thing 
is the cause of a bounty’s non-existence, they suppose that the thing’s exist-
ence is also the cause of the bounty’s existence. They offer their thanks and 
gratitude  to  the  thing  and  fall  into  error.  For  a  bounty’s  existence  results 
from  all  the  bounty’s  conditions  and  preliminaries.  Whereas  the  bounty’s 
non-existence occurs through the non-existence of only a single condition.
For example, someone who does not open the canal to water the gar-
den is the reason and cause of the garden drying up and the non-existence 
of  bounties.  But  the  existence  of  the  garden’s  bounties  is  dependent  on 
hundreds of conditions besides the man’s duty and the bounties come into 
being  through  dominical  will  and  power,  which  are  the  true  cause.  So 
understand just how clear is the error of this sophistry and how mistaken 
are those who worship causes!

Yes, ‘association’ is one thing and the cause is another. You receive a 
bounty, but the intention of a person to bestow it on you was the ‘associate’ 
of the bounty, not the cause. The cause was divine mercy. If the man had not 
intended to give you the bounty, you would not have received it and it would 
have been the cause of the bounty’s non-existence. But in consequence of 
the above rule, the desire to bestow cannot be the cause of the bounty; it can 
only be one out of hundreds of conditions.

For example, some of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students ( like Hüsrev and Re’fet ) 
who have received Almighty Allah’s bounties have confused the ‘associa-
tion’ and the cause, and have been over-grateful to their Master. However, 
Almighty  Allah  put  together  the  bounty  of  benefiting  from  the  Qur’anic 
instruction which He bestowed on them, and the bounty of instructing which 
He had bestowed on their Master; He ‘associated’ the two. They say: “ If our 
Master had not come here, we would not have received this instruction, so 
his instruction is the cause of our benefiting. ” However, I say: 

“ Brothers!  The  bounties  Almighty  Allah  bestowed  on  you  and  on  me 
arrived together. The cause of both bounties is divine mercy. Like you, I at 
one time confused the association with the cause, and felt much gratitude 
towards the hundreds of R i s a l e - i   N u r  students with diamond pens like your-
selves. I would say: ‘If it had not been for them, how could a semi-literate 

186

THE FLASHES

unfortunate like myself have performed this service?’ Then I understood that 
after bestowing on you the sacred bounty by means of the pen, He bestowed 
on me success in this service. He associated the two; they were not the cause 
of each other. I do not thank you, but congratulate you. You too pray for me 
and congratulate me, rather than being grateful to me. ”

It  may  be  understood  from  this  Fourth  Matter  just  how  many  degrees 

there are in heedlessness.

The Fifth Matter

The Fifth Matter

Just as if the property of a community is given to one man, it is wrong; or 
if one man lays hands on charitable foundations which belong to the com-
munity, he does wrong; so too to ascribe to the leader or master of a com-
munity  the  results  of  that  community’s  labours  or  the  honour  and  merits 
resulting  from  its  good  works,  is  wrong  both  for  the  community  and  for 
the leader or master. Because to do so flatters his egotism and encourages 
pride. While being the doorkeeper, he supposes himself to be the king. He 
also does wrong to himself. Indeed, he opens the way to a sort of concealed 
association of partners with Allah.

Yes, the colonel cannot claim for himself the booty, victory, and glory 
belonging to a regiment which conquers a citadel. The master and spiritual 
guide should not be considered to be the source and origin, but known to 
be  the  place  of  reflection  and  manifestation.  For  example,  heat  and  light 
reach you by means of a mirror. It would be crazy if you forget the sun, and 
considering the mirror to be the source, are grateful to it instead of being 
grateful to the sun. The mirror should be preserved because it is the place 
of manifestation. Thus, the guide’s spirit and heart are a mirror; they are the 
place for reflecting the effulgence emanating from Almighty Allah. He is 
the means of its being reflected to his followers. He should not be ascribed 
a station higher with regard to the effulgence than that of being the means. 
It sometimes even happens that a master considered to be the source is nei-
ther  the  place  of  manifestation  nor  the  source.  The  follower  supposes  the 
effulgences he receives due to the purity of his sincerity, or his strength of 
attachment,  or  his  concentration  on  his  master,  or  in  other  ways,  to  have 
come from the mirror of his master’s spirit. Like by means of mesmerism, 
some  people  open  up  a  window  onto  the  World  of  Similitudes  by  gazing 
attentively at a mirror, and observe strange and wonderful things in the mir-
ror. But they are not in the mirror; by focussing their attention on the mirror, 
a  window  opens  up  in  their  imaginations  outside  the  mirror  and  they  see 
those things. It is for this reason that sometimes the sincere student may be

more advanced than a deficient shaykh. He returns, guides his shaykh and 
becomes the shaykh’s shaykh.

This consists of four short signs alluding to divine unity.

First Sign

Fourteenth Note

First Sign

O worshipper of causes! You see a wondrous palace fashioned of rare 
jewels which is being made. Some of the jewels used in its construction are 
found only in China; others in Andalusia; others in Yemen; while others are 
found nowhere but Siberia. If you see that as it is being made, the precious 
stones are summoned that same day from north, south, east, and west, would 
you have any doubt that the master builder making the palace was a miracle-
worker who ruled the whole earth?

Thus,  every  animal  is  a  divine  palace,  and  man  is  the  finest  and  most 
wondrous of the palaces. Some of the jewels in the palace called man come 
from the World of Spirits, others from the World of Similitudes and the Pre-
served Tablet, and others from the world of the air, the world of light, and 
the world of the elements. He is also a wondrous palace whose needs stretch 
to eternity, whose hopes have spread to all the regions of the heavens and 
the earth, and who has relations and ties with all the epochs of this world 
and the hereafter. 

O you who considers yourself to be a true man! Since your true nature is 
thus, you can only be made by One for whom this world and the hereafter 
are each a dwelling, the earth and the skies each a page, and who has dis-
posal over pre-eternity and post-eternity as though they were yesterday and 
tomorrow. In which case, the only being fit to be worshipped by man, and 
his place of recourse and saviour, can be one who rules the earth and the 
heavens, and holds the reins of this world and the next.

Second Sign

Second Sign

There are certain foolish people who because they do not recognize the 
sun,  if  they  see  it  in  a  mirror,  start  to  love  the  mirror.  With  intense  emo-
tion they try to preserve the mirror so that the sun within it will not be lost. 
Whenever the foolish person realizes that the sun does not die on the mir-
ror’s dying and is not lost on its being broken, he turns all his love to the sun 
in the sky. He understands then that the sun appearing in the mirror is not 
dependent on the mirror, and its continued existence does not depend on it. It 
is rather the sun that holds the mirror and supplies its shining light. The sun’s 

188

THE FLASHES

continuance is not dependent on the mirror; the continuance of the mirror’s 
living brilliance is dependent on the sun’s manifestation.

O man! Your heart, identity, and nature are a mirror. The intense love 
of  immortality  in  your  nature  and  heart  should  be  not  for  the  mirror,  nor 
for your heart and nature, but for the manifestation of the Enduring One of 
Glory whose manifestation is reflected in the mirror according to the mir-
ror’s  capacity.  However,  out  of  stupidity  that  love  of  yours  is  directed  to 
other places. Since it is thus, say: “ O Enduring One! You alone are Endur-
ing! ” That is, “ Since You exist and are enduring, whatever transience and 
non-existence want to inflict on us, let them, it is of no importance! ”

Third Sign

Third Sign

O  man!  The  strangest  state  the  All-Wise  Creator  has  included  in  your 
nature is your inability to settle in the whole world; like someone suffocating 
in prison, you gasp for somewhere wider than the world. Yet you enter the 
minutest matter, a memory, a moment, and settle in it. Your heart and mind 
which cannot settle in the vast world settle in that jot. You wander about 
with your intensest emotions in that brief moment, that tiny memory.

And He lodged in your nature such immaterial powers and subtle facul-
ties that if some of them devoured the world, they would not be satisfied; 
and some of them cannot sustain even a minute particle within themselves. 
Like  the  eye  cannot  bear  a  hair  although  the  head  can  bear  heavy  stones, 
those faculties cannot bear the weight of even a hair, that is, some insignifi-
cant state arising from heedlessness and misguidance. They are sometimes 
extinguished and die even.

Since  it  is  thus,  be  careful,  tread  with  caution,  be  frightened  of  sink-
ing! Do not drown in a mouthful, a word, a seed, a flash, a sign, a kiss! Do 
not plunge your extensive faculties, which can swallow the world, in such 
a thing. For there are things which are very small that can in one respect 
swallow  things  which  are  very  large.  The  sky  together  with  its  stars  can 
enter a small fragment of glass and be drowned. And most of the pages of 
your actions and leaves of your life enter your faculty of memory, tiny as 
a mustard-seed. So too there are tiny things that swallow things thus large, 
and contain them.

Fourth Sign

O world-worshipping man! You conceive of your world as very broad, 
yet it resembles a narrow grave. But since the walls of that narrow grave-like 
dwelling are of glass, they are reflected one within the other and stretch as 

SEVENTEENTH FLASH

189

far as the eye can see. While being narrow as the grave, your world appears 
to be as large as a town. For despite both the right wall, which is the past, and 
the left wall, which is the future, being non-existent, they are reflected one 
within the other, unfolding the wings of present time, which is extremely 
brief and narrow. Reality mixes with imagination, and you suppose a non-
existent world to be existent.

On being spun round at speed, a line appears to be broad like a surface, 
despite in reality being a fine line. Your world too is in reality narrow, but 
due to your heedlessness, delusions, and imagination, its walls have drawn 
far apart. If driven by a calamity you stir in that narrow world, you will 
hit your head on the wall, which you supposed to be distant. It will dispel 
the illusions in your head and banish your sleep. Then you will see that 
that broad world of yours is more conﬁned than the grave, narrower and 
more forbidding than a rope bridge. Your life passes faster than lightning, 
it pours away more swiftly than a mountain stream.

Since worldly life and the life of the flesh and animal life are thus, shake 
free  of  animality,  leave  behind  corporeality,  enter  the  level  of  life  of  the 
heart and spirit! You will find a sphere of life, a world of light, far broader 
than the world you imagined was broad. The key to that world is to make the

For instance, take a handful of seeds of various trees, flowers, and plants, 
which are like the small coffers and are themselves all different and various, 
then bury them in the darkness of simple and lifeless earth. Then water them 
with simple water, which lacks balance, cannot distinguish things, and runs 
wherever you pour it.

Now come back in the spring, the arena of the annual resurrection, and 
look!  Note  carefully  the  time  in  the  spring  when  the  Israfil-like  angel  of 
thunder calls out to the rain as though sounding his trumpet, giving the good 
news of the breath of life being breathed into the seeds buried beneath the 
ground;  you  will  see  that  under  the  manifestation  of  the  divine  name  of 
Preserver,  those  seeds  that  resemble  each  other  and  are  all  mixed  up  and 
confused,  conform  perfectly  and  without  error  to  the  creative  commands 
proceeding from the All-Wise Creator. They conform so exactly that in their 
growth a brilliant consciousness, insight, purpose, will, knowledge, perfec-
tion, and wisdom are apparent. For you see that those seeds which all resem-
ble each other separate out and are distinguished from one another.

For example, this tiny seed has become a fig-tree, it has started to spread 
the All-Wise Creator’s bounties over our heads. It distributes them, stretch-
ing  them  out  to  us  with  its  hands.  And  these  two  seeds  which  are  super-
ficially  the  same  have  produced  the  flowers  called  sun-flowers  and  pan-
sies. They have adorned themselves for us. They smile in our faces, making 
us love them. And this sort of seed has produced fine fruits; they became 
shoots, then trees. Whetting our appetites with their delectable tastes, scents, 
and forms, they invite us to themselves. They sacrifice themselves for their 
customers so that they may rise from the level of vegetable life to that of ani-
mal life. And so on. You can make further examples in the same way. The 
seeds developed in such a way that the single handful became a garden filled 
with  multifarious  trees  and  flowers.  There  was  no  fault,  no  error  among 
them. They demonstrated the meaning of the verse,

( 67:3 ) K J I H G F
Through the manifestation and bestowal of the name of Preserver, each of 
the seeds preserves and shows without confusion or defect the legacy inher-
ited from its parent and origins.

This is a certain indication that the Preserver who carries out this won-
drous work will demonstrate the supreme manifestation of His preservation 
at the resurrection of the dead and Last Judgement.

SEVENTEENTH FLASH

191

Yes, the manifestation of preservation that is thus faultless and without 
defect in insignificant, fleeting, transient states is a decisive proof that the 
actions, works, words, and good deeds and bad deeds of man, the holder of 
the Supreme Trust and vicegerent of the earth – deeds which have an eternal 
effect and supreme importance – are precisely preserved and will be subject 
to account.

Does man suppose he will be left to his own devices? Allah forbid! He is 
destined for eternity, and for everlasting happiness and perpetual misery. He 
will be called to account for all his actions, small and great, many and few. 
He will receive either reward or punishment.

Witnesses  to  the  maximum  manifestation  of  preservation  and  to  the 
truth of the first-mentioned verse are beyond count or calculation. Those 
we  have  shown  in  this  Matter  are  a  mere  drop  from  the  ocean,  an  atom 
from a mountain.

On Frugality 

[ This treatise is about frugality and contentment, and wastefulness and 
extravagance. ]

(cid:2)(cid:3)

( 7:31 ) , + * )
This verse gives most important and wise instruction in the form of cat-
egorically commanding frugality and clearly prohibiting wastefulness. The 
matter contains seven points.

FIRST POINT

The All-Compassionate Creator desires THANKS in return for the boun-
ties He bestows on mankind, while wastefulness is contrary to thanks, and 
slights the bounty and causes loss. Frugality, however, shows respect for the 
bounty and is profitable. Yes, frugality is both a sort of thanks, and shows 
respect towards the divine mercy manifested in the bounties, and most defi-
nitely is the cause of plenty. So too, like abstinence, it is health-giving for 
the body, and since it saves a person from the degradation of what is in effect 
begging, is a cause of self-respect. It is also a powerful means of experienc-
ing the pleasure to be found in bounties, and tasting that pleasure in bounties 
which apparently afford no pleasure. As for wastefulness, since it is opposed 
to these instances of wisdom, it has grave consequences.

SECOND POINT

The  All-Wise  Maker  created  the  human  body  in  the  form  of  a  won-
derful  palace  and  resembling  a  well-ordered  city.  The  sense  of  taste  in 
the mouth is like a doorkeeper, and the nerves and blood vessels like tel-
ephone and telegraph wires; they are the means by which the sense of taste 
communicates with the stomach, which is at the centre of the body, and 
informs it of the food that enters the mouth. If the body and stomach have 

192

NINETEENTH FLASH

193

no use for it, it says: “ Forbidden! ”, and expels it. And sometimes the food 
is harmful and bitter as well as not being beneficial for the body, and it 
spits it out immediately.

Thus, since the sense of taste is a doorkeeper, from the point of view of 
administering the body, the stomach is a master and a ruler. If the gifts arriv-
ing at the palace or city and those given to the palace’s ruler are worth one 
hundred l i r a s , only five l i r a s ’  worth is appropriate for the doorkeeper in the 
form of a tip, lest he becomes conceited and is corrupted, then forgetting his 
duty he lets revolutionaries into the palace who will give him a bigger tip.

In  consequence  of  this  mystery  we  shall  now  imagine  two  mouthfuls. 
One consists of nutritious food like cheese and egg and costs forty p a r a ,  1 
and the other is of the choicest pastries and costs ten k u r u s h . Before entering 
the mouth, there is no difference in these two mouthfuls with respect to the 
body, they are equal. And after passing down the throat, they are still equal 
in nourishing the body. Indeed, forty p a r a s ’  worth of cheese is sometimes 
more nutritious. Only, in regard to pampering the sense of taste in the mouth, 
there is a half-minute difference. You can see from this what a meaningless 
and harmful waste it is to increase the cost from forty p a r a  to ten k u r u s h  for 
the sake of half a minute.

Now, although the gift arriving for the palace’s ruler is worth forty p a r a s , 
to give the doorkeeper a tip nine times bigger than that will corrupt him. He 
will declare: “ I am the ruler, ” and will allow to enter whoever gives him the 
biggest tip and most pleasure; he will cause a revolution and conflagration 
to break out. Then he will compel them to cry out: “ Oh! Call the doctor and 
get him to put out this fire in my stomach and bring down my temperature! ”
Thus, frugality and contentment are in conformity with divine wisdom; 
they  treat  the  sense  of  taste  as  a  doorkeeper  and  give  it  its  remuneration 
accordingly. As for wastefulness, since it is to act contrarily to wisdom, it 
swiftly receives its punishment, upsets the stomach, and causes real appetite 
to be lost. Producing from the unnecessary variety of foods a false and arti-
ficial appetite, it causes indigestion and illness.

THIRD POINT

We said in the Second Point that the sense of taste is a doorkeeper, and 
indeed,  for  the  heedless  and  those  who  have  not  progressed  spiritually  or 
advanced in the way of thanks, it is like a doorkeeper. Wastefulness should

194

THE FLASHES

not be indulged in or the sense of taste’s price be raised from one to ten for 
the sake of giving it pleasure.

However, the sense of taste of those truly on the way of thanks, those 
seeking  reality,  and  those  who  approach  reality  with  their  hearts  is  like  a 
supervisor and inspector in the kitchens of divine mercy, as is explained in 
the comparison in the Sixth Word. Its duty is to recognize and weigh up the 
varieties of divine bounties on the tiny scales present in it to the number of 
foods, and to send the body and stomach news of the food in the form of 
thanks. In this respect the sense of taste does not only look to the physical 
body; since it looks also to the heart, spirit, and mind, it holds a position and 
importance superior to the stomach. It can follow its pleasure on condition 
it is not wasteful or extravagant, and is purely to carry out its duty of thanks 
and recognize and perceive the varieties of divine bounty, and on condition 
it  is  licit  and  does  not  lead  to  degradation  and  begging.  In  fact,  delicious 
foods may be preferred in order to employ the tongue which bears the sense 
of taste in giving thanks. The following is an instance of Shaykh Geylani’s 
wonderworking which alludes to this truth:

At  one  time,  being  instructed  by  Ghawth  al-A‘zam,  Shaykh  Geylani 
( May his mystery be sanctified ), was the only son of an aged and anxious 
woman. This esteemed lady had gone to her son’s cell and seen that he had 
nothing to eat but a piece of dry, black bread. Her maternal compassion was 
aroused by his emaciated condition resulting from his asceticism. She felt 
sorry  for  him.  Later  she  went  to  Ghawth  al-A‘zam  in  order  to  complain, 
and  saw  the  Shaykh  was  tucking  into  roast  chicken.  Out  of  her  concern, 
she  declared:  “ O  Master!  My  son  is  dying  of  hunger  while  you  are  eat-
ing chicken! ” Whereupon Ghawth al-A‘zam said to the chicken: “ Rise up, 
with Allah’s permission! ” At this, the cooked chicken bones assembled and 
were thrown out of the dish as an entire live chicken. This has been related 
unanimously through many reliable and documented channels as a marvel 
of someone whose extraordinary wonderworking is world-famous. Ghawth 
al-A‘zam said to her: “ When your son reaches this level, then he too can eat 
chicken. ” 1 Thus, the meaning of Ghawth al-A‘zam’s words is this: when-
ever your son’s spirit rules his body, and his heart rules the desires of his 
soul, and his reason rules his stomach, and he wants pleasure for the sake of 
offering thanks, then he may eat delicious things.

According to the Hadith َد َ(cid:135)َ(cid:99)ْ(cid:162)ا  ِنَ(cid:174) ُلوُ(cid:151)َ(cid:192)  َ(cid:202) the meaning of which is: “ The 
thrifty will suffer no family difficulties as regards livelihood, ” 1 the frugal 
and economical person will not suffer undue trouble and hardship in sup-
porting his family.

There are countless proofs that frugality yields plenty and good living. 
For instance, I have seen myself and I can say according to the testimony 
of those who have befriended and assisted me that by being frugal I have 
sometimes seen a tenfold increase, and so have my friends. Even, nine years 
ago – and now it is thirty, a number of the tribal leaders who were exiled to 
Burdur together with me did their best to make me accept their z a k a t  so that 
I would not suffer privation and humiliation due to lack of money. I said to 
those rich leaders: “ I have very little money, but I am frugal and economical 
and I am accustomed to being content with little. I am richer than you. ” I 
refused their repeated and insistent offers. It is worth noting that two years 
later some of those who had offered me their z a k a t  were in debt because they 
had not been frugal. Praise be to Allah, seven years on from that, thanks to 
the plenty resulting from frugality that small amount of money was still suf-
ficient for me; it did not degrade me, nor compel me to present my needs to 
the people, nor make me deviate from my way of self-sufficiency and being 
independent of people, which is one of the principles of my life.

The person who is not frugal is certain to be abased and reduced to pov-
erty and in effect to begging. At the present time, money, the means of waste-
fulness and extravagance, is extremely expensive. Sometimes a person sells 
his honour and self-respect and bribes are taken to obtain it. Sometimes the 
sacred things of religion are sold, then some inauspicious money received in 
return. That is to say, material goods worth ten kurush are procured in return 
for an immaterial loss of a hundred lira.

However, according to the implied meaning of the verse,

and the explicit meaning of the verse,

( 51:58 ) Z Y X W V U T

enough sustenance to live on in unexpected ways. The verse guarantees it. 
Yes, there are two sorts of sustenance: 1

One  is  true  sustenance,  which  is  enough  to  subsist  on.  As  the  verse 
decrees,  this  is  guaranteed  by  the  Sustainer.  So  long  as  man’s  inclination 
towards evil does not interfere, he will find this essential sustenance under 
any circumstances. He will be compelled to sacrifice neither his religion, nor 
his honour, nor his self-respect.

The second sort is metaphorical sustenance, due to which and its abuse, 
inessential needs become like essential ones, and owing to the calamity of 
custom and tradition, people become addicted to them and cannot give them 
up. Such sustenance is not guaranteed by the Sustainer, so the obtaining of 
it is extremely expensive – especially at the present time. These unfruitful, 
inauspicious goods are obtained by first of all sacrificing one’s self-respect 
and accepting degradation, and sometimes stooping to what is in effect beg-
ging, kissing the feet of the vile, and sometimes sacrificing the sacred things 
of religion, which are the light of eternal life.

Also,  at  this  time  of  poverty  and  hardship,  the  distress  people  with 
consciences  feel  at  the  anguish  of  the  hungry  and  needy  sours  any  pleas-
ure  to  be  had  from  unlawfully  acquired  money.  As  far  as  doubtful  goods 
are  concerned,  one  has  to  make  do  with  them  to  the  minimum  degree 
necessary  during  strange  times  such  as  these.  For  according  to  the  rule, 
اَ(cid:182)ِرْدَ(cid:163)ِ(cid:92) ُرَ
ّنِا if compelled, illicit goods may be taken to the mini-
mum degree necessary, not more. Someone in dire need may eat prohibited 
meat, but he may not eat his fill. He may eat enough only to remain alive. 
Also, one could not fully enjoy more than this in the presence of a hundred 
people who are hungry.

The following is a story showing that frugality is the cause of dignity and 

distinction:

One time, Khatim Tay, who was world-famous for his generosity, was 
giving  a  large  banquet.  Having  given  his  guests  a  superfluity  of  presents, 
he  went  out  to  walk  in  the  desert.  There  he  saw  a  poor  old  man  carrying 
a load of thorny bushes and plants on his back. The thorns were piercing 
his skin and making him bleed. Khatim said to him: “ Khatim Tay is giv-
ing a large banquet and giving away gifts. Go there and you will be given 
five hundred k u r u s h  in return for your load worth five k u r u s h . ” The frugal 
old man replied: “ I raise and carry this thorny load with my self-respect;

I am not going to become obliged to Khatim Tay. ” Later, they asked Kha-
tim Tay: “ Have you come across anyone more generous and estimable than 
yourself? ” He replied: “ The frugal old man I met in the desert was more 
estimable, elevated, and generous than me. ” 1

FIFTH POINT

Out of His perfect generosity, Almighty Allah makes a poor man under-
stand the pleasure of His bounty the same as a rich man, and a beggar the 
same as a king. Indeed, the pleasure a poor man obtains from a dry piece of 
black bread because of hunger and being frugal is greater than the pleasure 
a king or a rich man obtains from the choicest pastries consumed with the 
weariness and lack of appetite resulting from excess.

It is surprising but some dissolute, extravagant people accuse the frugal 
and economical of being mean and stingy. Allah forbid! Frugality is dignity 
and generosity. Stinginess and meanness are the inner face of the apparently 
noble qualities of the wasteful and extravagant. There is an event corrobo-
rating this which occurred in my room in Isparta the year this treatise was 
written. It was as follows:

One of my students insisted on my accepting – contrary to my rule and 
life-long  principle  –  a  present  of  nearly  two  and  a  half  o k k a s   2  of  honey. 
However much I reiterated my rule, he was not to be persuaded. So I told 
the three brothers who were with me to take it, saying that by being eco-
nomical they would eat the honey for thirty to forty days in the months of 
Sha‘ban and Ramadan, and not lack something sweet to eat, and the one who 
brought it would earn the reward. I myself had an  o k k a  of honey as well. 
Although my three friends were moderate and appreciated frugality, because 
they offered the honey to each other, and flattered each others’ souls, and 
each preferred the others to himself, which in one respect is a good quality, 
they forgot about being economical. They finished the two and a half o k k a s  
of honey in three nights. Laughing, I said: “ I would have given you the taste 
of that honey for thirty to forty days, but you have reduced the thirty days to 
three. I hope you enjoyed it! ” I consumed my one o k k a  of honey frugally. 
For the whole of Sha’ban and Ramadan both I ate it, and, Praise be to Allah, 
every evening while breaking the fast I gave each of those brothers a spoon-
ful,  3 and it became the means of signficant reward. Perhaps anyone who

saw my doing this thought it was stinginess and what my brothers did for 
three nights was generosity. But in point of fact we perceived that concealed 
beneath the apparent stinginess lay an elevated dignity, increase and plenty, 
and great reward. If they had not stopped, it would have led to something 
much worse than stinginess beneath the generosity and excess, like beggarli-
ness and watching another’s hand greedily and expectantly.

SIXTH POINT

There  is  a  great  difference  between  frugality  and  stinginess.  Just  as 
humility is a praiseworthy quality superficially resembling but different to 
the  bad  quality  of  servility,  and  dignity  is  a  laudable  virtue  superficially 
similar to but different from the bad quality of haughtiness, so too frugality, 
which was one of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) elevated qualities and indeed is 
one of the things on which the divine wisdom in the order of the universe 
depends,  1 bears no relation to stinginess, which is a mixture of baseness, 
avarice, miserliness, and greed. There is merely a superficial resemblance. 
The following is an event corroborating this fact:

‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar, who was one of the famous Companions of the 
Prophet known as the seven ‘Abdullahs, 2 was the greatest and most impor-
tant  of  the  Caliph  ‘Umar,  Faruq  al-A‘zam’s  sons,  and  one  of  the  most 
distinguished and learned of the Companions. One day while shopping in 
the market, in order to be economical and to preserve the confidence and 
integrity on which trade depends, 3 he disputed hotly over something worth 
a few k u r u s h . One of the Companions saw him, and imagining the Illustri-
ous Successor of the Prophet on Earth, the Caliph ‘Umar’s son’s wrangling 
over a few  k u r u s h  to be an extraordinary stinginess, he followed him in 
order to understand his conduct. Next he saw that ‘Abdullah was entering 
his blessed house and had spotted a poor man at the door. He chatted with 
him for a bit, and the man left. Then he came out of the second door of the 
house and saw another poor man. He chatted with him for a while too, and 
the man left. The Companion, who was watching from the distance, was 
curious. He went and asked the poor men: “ ‘Abdullah paused a while with 
you. What did he do? ” Each of them replied: “ He gave me a gold piece. ” 
“ Glory be to Allah!, ” exclaimed the Companion, and thought to himself: 
“ How  is  it  that  he  wrangled  like  that  over  a  few  k u r u s h   in  the  market,

then was completely happy to give away two hundred k u r u s h  in his house 
without letting anyone know? ”

He went to ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar and said: “ O Imam! Solve this difficulty 
for me! In the market you did that, while in your house you did this. ” ‘Abdul-
lah replied to him saying: “ What I did in the market was not stinginess, but 
arose from frugality; it was perfectly reasonable, and to preserve confidence 
and honesty, which are the basis and spirit of commerce. And what I did 
by my house arose from the heart’s compassion and the spirit’s perfection. 
Neither was the first stinginess, nor the second immoderateness. ”

Alluding to this, Imam Abu Hanifa said: 

ْ(cid:202)ا يِ(cid:158) َرْ(cid:193)َ(cid:114)  َ(cid:202) ا َ(cid:175)ﯬﯦ ِرْ(cid:193)َ(cid:115)ْ(cid:170)ا يِ(cid:158)  َفاَر ْ(cid:126)ِا  َ(cid:202) 1 That is to say, just as in good 
ِفاَر ْ(cid:126)ِ
works and benevolence there can no excess or wastefulness – on condition 
they  are  for  the  deserving,  so  there  is  no  good  at  all  in  wastefulness  and 
immoderateness.

SEVENTH POINT

The First

Excess and wastefulness lead to greed, and greed has three consequences:
The First is dissatisfaction, and as for dissatisfaction, it destroys endeav-
our  and  enthusiasm  for  work,  and  causes  the  dissatisfied  person  to  com-
plain instead of giving thanks, and makes him lazy. Such a person abandons 
possessions which though few in number are licit,  2 and seeks possessions 
which are illicit and trouble-free. He sacrifices his self-respect on the way, 
and even his honour.

The Second Consequence of Greed

The  Second  Consequence  of  Greed  is  disappointment  and  loss.  The 
greedy person drives away what he wishes for, is found disagreeable, and is 
deprived of assistance and help. He even confirms the saying: 

 3  ٌر ِ(cid:126)اَ(cid:114)  ٌبِ(cid:86)اَ(cid:114) 

ُص(cid:192)ِرَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا

Greed and contentment have their effects in the world of living beings  
in  accordance  with  an  extensive  law.  For  instance,  the  natural  content-
ment of trees needy for sustenance makes their sustenance hasten to them; 
this shows the huge benefits of contentment. While animals’ running after

2.  Consumers increase and producers decrease as a result of wastefulness and lack 
of economy. Everyone fixes his eye on the government’s door. Then industry, trade, and 
agriculture, on which social life depend, decrease. And the nation declines and is impov-
erished.

THE FLASHES

their  sustenance  greedily  and  with  difficulty  and  deficiency  demonstrates 
the great loss of greed.

Also, the contentment apparent through their tongues of disposition of 
the helpless young and a pleasant food like milk flowing out to them from 
an unexpected place, while wild animals greedily attack their deficient and 
dirty sustenance, prove our claim in clear fashion.

Also, the contented attitude of fat fish being the means of their perfect 
sustenance, and intelligent animals like foxes and monkeys remaining puny 
and weak because they cannot find sufficient sustenance although they pur-
sue it with greed, again show the degree to which greed is the cause of hard-
ship and contentment the cause of ease. 

Also,  certain  people  finding  through  greed,  usury,  and  trickery  their 
degrading,  miserable,  illicit  sustanance  only  at  subsistence  level,  and  the 
contented attitude of nomads and their living with dignity and finding suf-
ficient sustenance, proves decisively what we say once more.

Also,  many  scholars  1  and  literary  figures  2  being  reduced  to  poverty 
because of the greed arising from their intelligence, and many stupid and 
incapable people becoming rich due to their innate contentedness  3 proves 
decisively that licit sustenance comes because of impotence and want, not 
by virtue of ability and will. Indeed, licit sustenance is in inverse proportion 
to  ability  and  will.  For  the  more  children  increase  in  ability  and  will,  the 
more their sustenance decreases, the further it is from them and the more 
difficult to digest. According to the Hadith, ىٰ(cid:179)ْ(cid:159)َ(cid:192)  َ(cid:202) ٌزْ(cid:179)ﯬﯦ ُةَ(cid:150)اَ(cid:179)َ(cid:163)ْ(cid:170)َا 4 content-

rulers and rulers not to be seen at the doors of the learned, whereas learning is superior 
to rulership? ” He replied: “ Because of the knowledge of the learned and the ignorance 
of the rulers. ” That is to say, due to their ignorance, rulers do not know the value of 
learning so that they approach the doors of the learned to seek it. But because of their 
knowledge, the learned know the value of their rulers’ goods and possessions and seek 
them at the rulers’ doors. Explaining thus wittily the greed resulting from the cleverness 
of the learned, which causes some of them to be impecunious and in want, Bozorgmehr 
replied in a refined manner.

ment is a treasury of good living and ease of life, while greed is a mine of 
loss and abasement.

The Third Consequence

The Third Consequence: Greed destroys sincerity and damages actions 
in regard to the hereafter. For if a Allah-fearing person suffers from greed, 
he will desire the regard of others, and someone who considers the attention 
of  others  cannot  have  complete  sincerity.  This  consequence  is  extremely 
important and worth noticing.

I n   S h o r t : Excess and wastefulness lead to lack of contentment. And lack 
of contentment destroys enthusiasm for work; it causes laziness, opens the 
door to complaining about life, and makes the dissatisfied person grumble 
continuously. 1 Also, it destroys sincerity, and opens the door to hypocrisy. 
And it destroys self-respect, and points the way to begging.

ّلَذ َعَ(cid:179)َ(cid:162)  ْنَ(cid:174) َ

As for frugality and economy, these result in contentment. According to 
the Hadith, َع َ(cid:175)َ(cid:142)  ْنَ(cid:174)  َ
ّزَ(cid:150) 2 contentment gives rise to self-esteem. It 
also encourages effort and work. It increases enthusiasm, and induces striv-
ing. For example, a person worked for one day. Because he was content with 
the petty wage he received in the evening, he worked again the second day. 
But because the wasteful and immoderate person was not content, he did not 
work the following day, or if he did, he did so without enthusiasm.

Also,  the  contentment  arising  from  frugality  opens  the  door  of  thanks 
and closes the door of complaint. Throughout his life, the contented person 
is thankful. And in so far as he is independent of others due to his content-
ment, he does not seek their regard. The door of sincerity is opened and the 
door of hypocrisy closed.

I  observed  the  fearsome  harm  of  wastefulness  and  excess  on  a  broad 
scale.  It  was  as  follows:  nine  years  ago  I  visited  a  fortunate  town.  It  was 
winter and I could not see its sources of wealth. Several times the town’s 
Mufti, may Allah have mercy on him, said to me, “ Our people are poor. ” 
His words touched me. The next five or six years I felt continual pity for 
the people of the town. Eight years later I again visited it, in the summer. I 
looked at the gardens and recalled the words of the late Mufti. “ Glory be to 
Allah! ”, I exclaimed, “ These gardens’ crops are far greater than the needs of 

1.  Whenever you meet a wasteful, immoderate person, you hear complaints. No mat-
ter how rich he is, his tongue still complains. But when you meet even the poorest, but 
contented, person, you hear only thanks.

the town. Its people should be very rich. ” I was amazed. Then remembering 
a truth that has never deceived me and is my guide in understanding other 
truths, I understood that the abundance and plenty had disappeared due to 
wastefulness and excess, so that although the town possessed such sources 
of wealth, the late Mufti used to say: “ Our people are poor. ” 

Indeed, just as giving z a k a t  and being frugal and economical is proven by 
experience to be the cause of increase and plenty in goods and possessions, 
1 so too innumerable events show that wastefulness and the failure to give 
z a k a t  cause increase and plenty to be taken away.

comparatively speaking, there is no harmful rivalry and conflict.

First Point
A n   I m p o r t a n t   a n d   A w e s o m e   Q u e s t i o n :  Why is it that while the worldly 
and the neglectful, and even the misguided and hypocrites, co-operate with-
out rivalry, the people of religion, the religious scholars, and those who fol-
low the Sufi path, oppose each other in rivalry, although they are the people 
of truth and concord? Agreement belongs in reality to the people of concord 
and dispute to the hypocrites; how is it that these two have changed places?
T h e  A n s w e r : We will set forth seven of the extremely numerous causes of 
this painful, disgraceful and awesome situation, one that causes the zealous 
to weep.

The First

THE FIRST

Just as dispute among the people of the truth does not arise from lack 
of the truth, so too the agreement prevailing among the people of neglect 
does not arise from any possession of truth. Rather it is that a specific duty 
and particular function has been assigned to the classes in society, like ‘the 
worldly,’ 1 those engaged in politics, and those who have received a secular 
education, and thus the functions of the various groups, societies, and com-
munities  have  been  defined  and  become  distinguished  from  one  another. 
Similarly, the material reward they are to receive for their functions in order 
to  maintain  a  livelihood,  as  well  as  the  moral  reward  that  consists  in  the 
attention  they  receive  from  men  for  the  sake  of  their  ambition  and  pride 
– this too is established and specified.  2 There is therefore nothing held in 
common to the degree that it might produce conflict, dissension and rivalry. 
However evil be the path that they tread, they will be able to preserve unity 
and agreement. 

But as for the people of religion, the scholars, and those who follow the 
path, the duty of each is concerned with all men; their material reward is not 

1.  ‘The worldly’ ( e h l - i   d ü n y a  ): those people whose view is restricted to the life of 
this world and who disregard the hereafter, or those who sell religion for this world. ( Tr. )
2.  Be aware that the attention of men cannot be demanded, but only given. If it is 
given, one should not delight in it. If one delights in it, sincerity is lost and hypocrisy takes 
its place. The attention of men, if accompanied by the desire for honour and fame, is not a 
reward and a prize, but a reproach and chastisement for lack of sincerity. Such attention of 
men, such honour and fame, harm sincerity, the source of vitality for all good deeds, and 
even though they yield a slight pleasure as far as the gate of the tomb, on the other side of 
that gate they take on the form of torment. One should not therefore desire the attention of 
men, but flee and shy away from it. Be warned, all you who worship fame and run after 
honour and rank!

206

THE FLASHES

set and specified; and their share in social esteem and acceptance and public 
attention is not predetermined. Many may be candidates for the same posi-
tion; many hands may stretch out for each moral and material reward that is 
offered. Hence it is that conflict and rivalry arise; concord is changed into 
discord, and agreement into dispute.

Now the cure and remedy for this appalling disease is sincerity. Sincerity 
may be attained by preferring the worship of Allah to the worship of one’s 
own soul, by causing Allah’s pleasure to vanquish the pleasure of the soul 
and the ego, and thus manifesting the meaning of the verse:

( 10:72 ) O N M L K
by renouncing the material and moral reward to be had from men 1 and thus 
manifesting the meaning of the verse:

( 24:54 ) : 9 8 7 6 5
and  by  knowing  that  such  matters  as  goodly  acceptance,  and  making  a 
favourable impression, and gaining the attention of men are Allah’s concern 
and a favour from Him, and that they play no part in conveying the message, 
which is one’s own duty, nor are they necessary for it, nor is one charged 
with gaining them – by knowing this a person will be successful in gaining 
sincerity, otherwise it will vanish.

Second Cause

SECOND CAUSE

The agreement among the poeple of misguidance is on account of their 
abasement, and the dispute among the people of guidance is on account of 
their dignity. That is to say that the people of neglect – the misguided and 
those sunk in worldly concerns – are weak and abased because they do not 
rely on truth and reality. On account of their abasement, they need to aug-
ment their strength, and because of this need they wholeheartedly embrace 

1.  One should also take as one’s guide the quality of preferring others to oneself, the 
same quality of the Companions that is praised in the Qur’an. For example, when giving a 
present or performing an act of charity, one should always prefer the recipient to oneself, 
and  without  demanding  or  inwardly  desiring  any  material  reward  for  religious  service, 
know one’s act to be purely Allah’s grace and not impose a sense of obligation on men. 
Nothing worldly should be sought in return for religious service, for otherwise sincerity 
will be lost. Those serving have many rights and claims, for their needs should be met 
by the community, and may even deserve zakat. But it cannot be demanded. When one 
receives something, it cannot be said that “ This is the reward for my service. ” Rather in 
perfect contentment one should always prefer to oneself others who are more deserving. 
Thus  manifesting  the  meaning  of    ( 59:9 )  Ï Î Í Ì Ë Ê É    one 
may be saved from this terrible danger and gain sincerity.

TWENTIETH FLASH

207

the aid and co-operation of others. Even though the path they follow is mis-
guidance, they preserve their agreement. It is as if they were making their 
godlessness  into  a  form  of  worship  of  the  truth,  their  misguidance  into  a 
form of sincerity, their irreligion into a form of solidarity, and their hypoc-
risy into concord, and thus attaining success. For genuine sincerity, even for 
the sake of evil, cannot fail to yield results, and whatever man seeks with 
sincerity, Allah will grant him it. 1

But as for the people of guidance and religion, the religious scholars 
and those who follow the Sufi path, since they rely upon truth and reality, 
and each of them on the road of truth thinks only of his Sustainer and trusts 
in His succour, they derive dignity from their belief. When they feel weak-
ness, they turn not toward men, but toward Allah and seek help from Him. 
On account of difference in outlook, they feel no real need for the aid of 
the one whose outlook apparently opposes their own, and see no need for 
agreement and unity. Indeed, if obstinacy and egoism are present, one will 
imagine himself to be right and the other to be wrong; discord and rivalry 
take the place of concord and love. Thus sincerity is chased away and its 
function disrupted.

Now the only remedy for the critical consequences of this awesome state 

consists of nine commands:

1. To act positively, that is, out of love for one’s own outlook, avoiding 
enmity for other outlooks, not criticizing them, interfering in their beliefs 
and sciences, or in any way concerning oneself with them.

2. To unite within the fold of Islam, irrespective of particular outlook, 
remembering those numerous ties of unity that evoke love, brotherhood and 
concord.

3. To adopt the just rule of conduct that the follower of any right outlook 
has the right to say, “ My outlook is true, or the best, ” but not that “ My out-
look alone is true, ” or that “ My outlook alone is good, ” thus implying the 
falsity or repugnance of all other outlooks.

4. To consider that union with the people of truth is a cause of divine suc-

cour and the high dignity of religion.

5. To realize that the individual resistance of the most powerful person 
against the attacks through its genius of the mighty collective force of the

ّدَ(cid:106)َو  َبَ(cid:171)َ(cid:142)  ْنَ(cid:174) is a rule of truth. Its scope is comprehensive and includes 

the matter under discussion.

people of misguidance and falsehood, which arises from their solidarity, will 
inevitably be defeated, and through the union of the people of truth, to create 
a joint and collective force also, in order to preserve justice and right in the 
face of that fearsome collective force of misguidance.

6. In order to preserve truth from the assaults of falsehood,
7. To abandon the self and its egoism,
8. And give up the mistaken concept of self-pride,
9. And cease from all insignificant feelings aroused by rivalry.
If this ninefold rule is adhered to, sincerity will be gained and its function 

perfectly performed. 1

Third Cause

THIRD CAUSE

Disagreement  among  the  people  of  truth  does  not  arise  from  lack  of 
zeal and aspiration, nor does union among the people of misguidance arise 
from loftiness of aspiration. That which impels the people of guidance to 
the  misuse  of  their  high  aspiration  and  hence  to  disagreement  and  rivalry 
is  the  desire  for  heavenly  reward  that  is  counted  as  a  praiseworthy  qual-
ity in respect of the hereafter, and extreme eagerness with respect to duties 
pertaining to the hereafter. Thinking to oneself, “ Let me gain this reward, 
let me guide these people, let them listen to me, ” he takes up a position of 
rivalry towards the true brother who faces him and who stands in real need 
of his love, assistance, brotherhood and aid. Saying to oneself, “ Why are my 
pupils going to him? Why don’t I have as many pupils as him? ” he falls prey 
to egoism, inclines to the chronic disease of ambition, loses all sincerity, and 
opens the door to hypocrisy.

The cure for this error, this wound, this awesome sickness of the spirit, is 
the principle that “ Allah’s pleasure is won by sincerity alone, ” and not by 
a large following or great success. For these latter are a function of Allah’s 
will; they cannot be demanded, although they are sometimes given. Some-
times a single word will result in someone’s salvation and hence the pleasure 
of Allah. Quantity should not receive too much attention, for sometimes to 
guide one man to the truth may be as pleasing to Allah as guiding a thousand. 

1.  It is even recorded in authentic traditions of the Prophet that at the end of time the 
truly pious among the Christians will unite with the People of the Qur’an and fight their 
common  enemy,  irreligion. And  at  this  time,  too,  the  people  of  religion  and  truth  need 
to  unite  sincerely  not  only  with  their  own  brothers  and  fellow  believers,  but  also  with 
the truly pious and spiritual ones among the Christians, temporarily refraining from the 
discussion and debate of points of difference in order to combat their joint enemy—ag-
gressive atheism.

Moreover sincerity and adherence to the truth require that one should desire 
the Muslims to benefit from anyone and at any place they can. To think “ Let 
them take lessons from me so that I gain the reward ” is a trick of the soul 
and the ego.

O man greedy for reward in the hereafter and the performance of deeds 
entitling you to that reward! There have been certain prophets who had only 
a  limited  following  but  received  the  infinite  reward  of  the  sacred  duty  of 
prophethood. The true achievement lies, then, not in gaining a vast follow-
ing, but in gaining Allah’s pleasure. What do you imagine yourself to be, 
that saying, “ Let everyone listen to me, ” you forget your function, and inter-
fere in what is strictly Allah’s concern? To gain acceptance for you and to 
have people gather round you is Allah’s concern. So look to your own duty 
and concern, and do not meddle with Allah’s concerns.

Moreover, it is not only men who earn reward for those who hear and 
speak the truth. The sentient and spiritual beings of Allah and His angels 
have  filled  the  universe  and  adorned  its  every  part.  If  you  want  plentiful 
reward, take sincerity as your foundation and think only of Allah’s pleas-
ure.  Then  every  syllable  of  the  blessed  words  that  issue  forth  from  your 
mouth will be brought to life by your sincerity and truthful intention, and 
going to the ears of innumerable sentient beings, they will illumine them and 
earn you reward. For when, for example, you say, “ Praise and thanks be to 
Allah, ” millions of these words, great and small, are written on the page of 
the air by Allah’s leave. Since the All-Wise Inscriber did nothing prodigally 
or  in  vain,  He  created  innumerable  ears,  as  many  as  were  needed  to  hear 
those multiple blessed words. If those words are brought to life in the air by 
sincerity and truthful intent, they will enter the ears of the spirit beings like 
some tasty fruit in the mouth. But if Allah’s pleasure and sincerity do not 
bring those words to life, they will not be heard, and reward will be had only 
for the single utterance made by the mouth. Pay good attention to this, you 
Qur’an reciters who are sad that your voices are not more beautiful and that 
more people do not listen to you!

Fourth Cause

FOURTH CAUSE

In  just  the  same  way  that  rivalry  and  disagreement  among  the  people 
of  guidance  do  not  arise  from  failure  to  foresee  consequences  or  from 
shortsightedness, so too wholehearted agreement among the people of mis-
guidance does not result from farsightedness or loftiness of vision. Rather 
the  people  of  guidance,  through  the  influence  of  truth  and  reality,  do  not 

210

THE FLASHES

succumb to the blind emotions of the soul, and follow instead the farsighted 
inclinations of the heart and the intellect. Since, however, they fail to pre-
serve their sense of direction and their sincerity, they are unable to maintain 
their high station and fall into dispute. 

As  for  the  people  of  misguidance,  under  the  influence  of  the  soul  and 
caprice, and the dominance of sense-perception, which is blind to all con-
sequences and always prefers an ounce of immediate pleasure to a ton of 
future pleasure, they come together in eager concord for the sake of instant 
benefit and immediate pleasure. Indeed, lowly and heartless worshippers of 
the ego are bound to congregate around worldly and immediate pleasures 
and benefits. It is true that the people of guidance have set their faces to the 
rewards  of  the  hereafter  and  its  perfections,  in  accordance  with  the  lofty 
instructions  of  the  heart  and  the  intellect,  but  even  though  a  proper  sense 
of  direction,  a  complete  sincerity  and  self-sacrificing  union  and  concord 
are possible, because they have failed to rid themselves of egoism, and on 
account of deficiency and excess, they lose their union, that lofty source of 
power, and permit their sincerity to be shattered. Their duty in regard to the 
hereafter is also harmed. Allah’s pleasure is not had easily.

The cure and remedy for this serious disease is to be proud of the com-
pany of all those travelling the path of truth, in accordance with the principle 
of love for Allah’s sake; to follow them and defer leadership to them; and 
to consider whoever is walking on Allah’s path to be probably better than 
oneself, thereby breaking the ego and regaining sincerity. Salvation is also 
to be had from that disease by knowing that an ounce of deeds performed 
in sincerity is preferable to a ton performed without sincerity, and by pre-
ferring the status of a follower to that of a leader, with all the danger and 
responsibility that it involves. Thus sincerity is to be had, and one’s duties 
of preparation for the hereafter may be correctly performed.

Fifth Cause

FIFTH CAUSE

Dispute and disagreement among the people of guidance are not the result 
of weakness, and the powerful union of the people of misguidance is not the 
result of strength. Rather the lack of union of the people of guidance comes 
from the power that results from the support provided by perfect belief, and 
the union of the people of neglect and misguidance comes from the weak-
ness and impotence they experience as a result of their lack of any inward 
support.  The  weak  form  powerful  unions  precisely  because  of  their  need 

TWENTIETH FLASH

211

for union. 1 Since the strong do not feel a similar need, their unions are weak. 
Lions do not need union like foxes and therefore live as individuals, whereas 
wild goats form a herd to protect themselves against wolves. The commu-
nity  and  collective  personality  of  the  weak  is  strong,  and  the  community 
and collective personality of the strong is weak. There is a subtle allusion 
to this in the Qur’an in the words, ( 12:30 ) Ï Î Í Ì the verb  َلاَ(cid:162) 
being in the masculine form, although it should be feminine for two reasons 
[ women is a feminine noun, and also a plural – so-called “ broken ” plurals 
in Arabic are always regarded as feminine ]. But by contrast see the words, 
( 49:14 )  ^ ]   the  verb  said  in  this  case  being  in  the  feminine,  even 
though its subject designates a community of men. Herein lies an indication, 
that  an  association  of  weak,  meek and  soft  women  gains  strength,  tough-
ness and force, and even acquires a certain kind of virility. The use of the 
masculine form of the verb is therefore most appropriate. Strong men, by 
contrast, and in particular Beduin Arabs, trust in their own strength; there-
fore their associations are weak, for they assume a stance of softness and 
caution and take on a kind of femininity, for which the use of the feminine 
form  of  the  verb  is  most  suitable.  Similarly  the  people  of  truth  submit 
to  and  place  their  reliance  in  the  firm  source  of  support  that  is  belief  in 
Allah; hence they do not present their needs to others or request aid and 
assistance  from  them.  If  they  do  sometimes  make  the  request,  they  will 
not adhere to the persons concerned at all cost. But the worldly ignore in 
their worldly affairs the true source of support; they fall into weakness and 
impotence, and experiencing an acute need of assistance, come together 
sacrificing themselves wholeheartedly.

The people of truth do not recognize and seek the true strength that is 
to be found in union; hence they fall into dispute, as an evil and harmful 
consequence  of  this  failure.  By  contrast,  the  people  of  misguidance  and 
falsehood  perceive  the  strength  to  be  found  in  union,  by  virtue  of  their 
very weakness, and thus acquire union, that most important means for the 
attainment of all goals.

The  cure  and  remedy  for  this  disease  of  discord  among  the  people  of 
truth is to make one’s rule of conduct the divine prohibition contained in this 

1.  Among the most powerful and effective organizations in the West is the Ameri-
can  Organization  for  Women’s  Rights  and  Liberty,  even  though  women  are  called  the 
fair sex, and are weak and delicate. Similarly, the organization of the Armenians, despite 
their weakness and small numbers when compared to other peoples, with its strong, self-
sacrificing behaviour, provides another proof of our observation.

sense of his own utter weakness and impotence. Finally, one must forget his 
own person, abandon hypocrisy and pretension, and lay hold of sincerity.

Sixth Cause

SIXTH CAUSE

Discord among the people of truth does not arise from lack of manliness, 
aspiration and zeal; similarly, the wholehearted union among the misguided, 
neglectful and worldly with respect to their worldly affairs does not result 
from manliness, aspiration and zeal. It is rather that the people of truth are 
generally concerned with benefits to be had in the hereafter and hence direct 
their zeal, aspiration and manliness to those important and numerous mat-
ters. Since they do not devote time – the true capital of man – to a single 
concern, their union with their fellows can never become firm. Their con-
cerns are numerous and of a wide scope. As for the neglectful and worldly, 
they think only of the life of this world, and they firmly embrace the con-
cerns of the life of this world with all their senses, their spirit and heart, and 
cling firmly to whoever aids them in those concerns. Like a mad diamond 
merchant who gives an exorbitant price for a piece of glass worth virtually 
nothing, they devote time, which is of the highest value, to matters which 
in reality and in the view of the people of truth are worth nothing. Paying 
such a high price and offering oneself with the devotion of all the senses 
will  naturally  result  in  a  wholehearted  sincerity  that  yields  success  in  the 
matter at hand even on the path of falsehood, so that the people of truth are 
defeated. As a result of this defeat, the people of truth decline into a state 
of abasement, humiliation, hypocrisy and ostentation, and sincerity is lost. 
Thus the people of truth are obliged to flatter and cringe before a handful of 
vile and lowly men of the world.

O people of truth! O people of the law, people of reality and people of 
the path, all worshipping Allah! Confronted by this awesome disease of dis-
cord, overlook each other’s faults, close your eyes to each other’s shortcom-
ings! Behave according to the rule of courtesy established by the criterion 

that  is  the  Qur’an  in  the  verse: f e d c b  ( 25:72 )  Regard  it 
as your primary duty – one on which your state in the hereafter depends – 

TWENTIETH FLASH

213

to abandon internal dissension when attacked by an enemy from the outside, 
and thereby to deliver the people of truth from their abasement and humili-
ation! Practise the brotherhood, love and co-operation insistently enjoined 
by  hundreds  of  Qur’anic  verses  and  traditions  of  the  Prophet  ( UWBP )! 
Establish with all of your powers a union with your fellows and brothers in 
religion that is stronger than the union of the worldly! Do not fall into dis-
pute! Do not say to yourself, “ Instead of spending my valuable time on such 
petty matters, let me spend it on more valuable things such as the invoca-
tion of Allah and meditation; ” then withdrawing and weakening unity. For 
precisely what you imagine to be a matter of slight importance in this moral 
j i h a d  may in fact be very great. In just the same way that under certain spe-
cial and unusual conditions the watch kept for one hour by a soldier may be 
equal to a whole year’s worship, in this age when the people of truth have 
been defeated, the precious day that you spend on some apparently minor 
matter concerning the moral struggle may be worth a thousand days, just like 
the hour of that soldier. Whatever is undertaken for the sake of Allah cannot 
be divided into small and great, valuable and valueless. An atom expended 
in sincerity and for the sake of Allah’s pleasure becomes like a star. What 
is important is not the nature of the means employed, but the result that it 
yields. As long as the result is Allah’s pleasure and the substance employed 
is sincerity, any means to which recourse is had will be great, not small.

Seventh Cause

SEVENTH CAUSE

Dispute and rivalry among the people of truth do not arise from jeal-
ousy and greed for the world, and conversely union among the worldly and 
neglectful does not arise from generosity and magnanimity. It is rather that 
the people of truth are unable to preserve fully the magnanimity and high 
aspiration  that  proceed  from  the  truth,  or  the  laudable  form  of  competi-
tion that exists on Allah’s path. Infiltrated by the unworthy, they partially 
misuse that laudable form of competition and fall into rivalry and dispute, 
causing  grave  harm  both  to  themselves  and  to  the  Islamic  community. 
As  for  the  people  of  neglect  and  misguidance,  in  order  not  to  lose  the 
benefits with which they are infatuated and not to offend the leaders and 
companions they worship for the sake of benefit, in their utter humiliation, 
abasement and lack of manliness, they practise union at all costs with their 
companions, however abominable, treacherous and harmful they be, and 
wholeheartedly  agree  with  their  partners  in  whatever  form  may  be  dic-
tated by their common interest. As a result of this wholeheartedness, they 
indeed attain the benefits desired.

THE FLASHES

So  O  people  of  truth  given  to  dispute  and  afflicted  with  disaster!  It  is 
through your loss of sincerity and your failure to make Allah’s pleasure your 
sole aim in this age of disaster that you have caused the people of truth to 
undergo this humiliation and defeat. In matters relating to religion and the 
hereafter there should be no rivalry, envy or jealousy; indeed there can be 
none of these in truth. The reason for envy and jealousy is that when several 
hands reach out after a single object, when several eyes are fixed on a single 
position, when several stomachs hunger for a single loaf of bread, first envy 
arises as a result of conflict, dispute and rivalry, and then jealousy. Since 
many people desire the same thing in the world, and because the world, nar-
row and transitory as it is, cannot satisfy the limitless desires of man, people 
become rivals of each other. However, in the hereafter a five-hundred-year 
paradise will be given to a single individual; seventy thousand palaces and 
houris will be granted to him; and every one of the people of Paradise will 
be perfectly satisfied with his share. 1 It is thus clear that there is no cause for 
rivalry in the hereafter, nor can there be rivalry. In that case, neither should 
there be any rivalry with respect to those good deeds that entail reward in the 
hereafter; there is no room for jealousy here. The one jealous here is either a 
hypocrite, seeking worldly result through the performance of good deeds, or 
a sincere but ignorant devotee, not knowing the true purpose of good deeds 

1.  A n   i m p o r t a n t   q u e s t i o n   r a i s e d   b y   a   s i g n i f i c a n t   p e r s o n :  According to tradition a five-
hundred-year paradise will be given to everyone in Paradise. How can worldly intelligence 
comprehend this truth? 

T h e   A n s w e r :  In this world everyone has his private and temporally limited world as 
broad as the world, the pillar of which is his life. He makes use of his world through his in-
ner and outer senses. He says to himself, “ The sun is my lamp, the stars are my candles. ” 
The existence of other creatures and animate beings in no way negates his ownership of 
these; on the contrary, they brighten and illumine his world. In the same way, although on 
an infinitely higher plane, in addition to the garden of each believer that contains thou-
sands of palaces and houris, there is a private five-hundred-year paradise for everyone, 
apart from the general Paradise. He will benefit from this paradise and eternity through his 
senses and feelings, according to the degree of development they have reached. The fact 
that others share in the general Paradise in no way harms his ownership or benefit, but on 
the contrary strengthens these, and adorns that vast Paradise. Man in this world benefits 
from a garden lasting an hour, a spectacle lasting a day, a country lasting a month and a 
journey lasting a year, with his mouth, his ear, his eye, his taste and all his other senses. 
So too, in that realm of eternity, his sense of smell and touch, which in this transient world 
barely profit from a garden lasting an hour, will benefit as if from a garden lasting a year. 
The sense of sight and hearing which here barely profit from an excursion lasting a year, 
will there be able to benefit from a five-hundred-year excursion in a manner fitting that 
realm, adorned from end to end. Every believer will benefit there according to his spiritual 
rank, and gain delight and pleasure through his senses that will expand and develop in 
relation to the reward he has earned in this world and the good deeds he has performed.

and not comprehending that sincerity is the spirit and foundation of all good 
deeds. By cultivating a kind of rivalry and hostility toward Allah’s saints, he 
is in fact placing in doubt the breadth of Allah’s compassion.

An  instance  supporting  this  truth:  One  of  my  former  companions  nur-
tured hostility to someone. His enemy’s good deeds and sanctity were once 
favourably  described  in  his  presence.  He  was  not  jealous  or  upset.  Then 
someone said, “ That enemy of yours is courageous and strong. ” We saw a 
strong vein of jealousy and rivalry suddenly appearing in that man. We said 
to him:

“ Sanctity and righteousness bestow a strength and exaltation like a jewel 
of eternal life, yet you were not jealous of them. Now worldly strength is to 
be found in oxen, and courage in wild beasts; in comparison with sanctity 
and righteousness they are like a piece of glass compared to a diamond. ”

The man replied:
“ We have both fixed our eyes in this world on a single object. The steps 
that lead to it are provided by things such as courage and strength. It is for 
this reason that I was jealous of him. The objects and stations of the hereaf-
ter are without number. Although he is my enemy here, there he can be my 
beloved and intimate brother. ”

O people of the truth and the path! The service of the truth is like carrying 
and preserving a great and weighty treasure. Those who carry that trust on 
their shoulders will be happy and grateful whenever powerful hands rush to 
their aid. Far from being jealous, one should proudly applaud the superior 
strength, effectiveness and capacity of those who in upright love come for-
ward to offer their help. Why then look on true brothers and self-sacrificing 
helpers in a spirit of rivalry, thus losing sincerity? You will be exposed to 
fearsome accusations in the eyes of the people of misguidance, such as pur-
suing worldly interest through religion, even though it is something a hun-
dred times lower than you and your belief, earning your livelihood through 
the knowledge of truth and rivalling others in greed and acquisitiveness.

The sole remedy for this disease is to accuse your own soul before oth-
ers raise these charges, and always to take the side of your fellow, not your 
own soul. The rule of truth and equity established by the scholars of the art 
of debate is this: “ Whoever desires, in debate on any subject, that his own 
word should turn out to be true, whoever is happy that he turns out to be 
right and his enemy to be wrong and mistaken – such a person has acted 
unjustly. ” Not only that, such a person loses, for when he emerges the victor 

216

THE FLASHES

in such a debate, he has not learned anything previously unknown to him, 
and his probable pride will cause him loss. But if his adversary turns out to 
be  right,  he  will  have  learned  something  previously  unknown  to  him  and 
thereby  gained  something  without  any  loss,  as  well  as  being  saved  from 
pride. In other words, one fair in his dealings and enamoured of the truth 
will subject the desire of his own soul to the demands of the truth. If he sees 
his adversary to be right, he will accept it willingly and support it happily.

If then the people of religion, the people of truth, the people of the path, 
and the people of learning take this principle as their guide, they will attain 
sincerity, and be successful in those duties that prepare them for the here-
after.  Through  Allah’s  mercy,  they  will  be  delivered  from  this  appalling 
wretchedness and misfortune from which they presently suffer.

O  my  brothers  of  the  hereafter!  And  O  my  companions  in  the  service 
of the Qur’an! You should know – and you do know – that in this world 
sincerity is the most important principle particularly in works pertaining to 
the hereafter; it is the greatest strength, the most acceptable intercessor, the 
firmest  point  of  support,  the  shortest  way  to  reality,  the  most  acceptable 
prayer, the most wondrous means of achieving one’s goal, the highest qual-
ity,  and  the  purest  worship.  Since  sincerity  comprises  much  strength  and 
many  lights  like  those  mentioned  above;  and  since  at  this  dreadful  time, 
despite our small number and weak, impoverished, and powerless state and 
our being confronted by terrible enemies and suffering severe oppression in 
the midst of aggressive innovations and misguidance, the extremely heavy, 
important,  general,  and  sacred  duty  of  serving  belief  and  the  Qur’an  has 
been placed on our shoulders by divine grace, we are certainly compelled 

217

218

THE FLASHES

more than anyone to work with all our strength to gain sincerity. We need 
more than anything to instil sincerity in ourselves. Otherwise what we have 
achieved so far in our sacred service will in part be lost and will not per-
sist; and we shall be held responsible; we shall manifest the severe threat 
contained in the divine prohibition, ( 2:41 )  ^ ] \ [ Z   We shall 
otherwise destroy sincerity, thus harming eternal happiness for the sake of 
meaningless, unnecessary, harmful, sad, self-centred, tedious, hypocritical 
base feelings and insignificant benefits. And if we were to do that, we would 
violate all our brothers’ rights, transgress against the duty of service to the 
Qur’an, and be disrespectful towards the sacredness of the truths of belief.

My brothers! There are many obstacles before significant good works. 
Satans put up a powerful struggle against those who assist in them. In the 
face of those obstacles and satans you have to rely on the strength of sincer-
ity.  You  should  avoid  things  that  harm  sincerity  as  you  avoid  snakes  and 
scorpions. In accordance with the words of Joseph ( Upon whom be peace ),

( 12:53 ) - , + * ) ( ' &
the evil-commanding soul cannot be relied upon. Do not let egotism and the 
soul deceive you! To gain sincerity and preserve it you should take as your 
guide the following rules:

YOUR FIRST RULE

You  should  seek  divine  pleasure  in  your  actions.  If  Almighty  Allah  is 
pleased, it is of no importance if the whole world even is displeased. If He 
accepts an action and everyone else rejects it, their rejection has no effect. 
Once His pleasure has been gained and He has accepted an action, even if 
you do not ask it of Him, should He wish it and His wisdom requires it, He 
will make others accept it. He will make them consent to it too. For this rea-
son, to seek divine pleasure should be the sole aim in this service.

YOUR SECOND RULE

This is not to criticize your brothers who are employed in this service of 
the Qur’an, and not to excite their envy by displaying superior virtues. For 
just as one hand cannot compete with the other, so one eye cannot criticize 
the other, nor the tongue object to the ear, nor the heart see the spirit’s faults. 
Each of a person’s members completes the deficiencies of the others, veils 
their faults, assists their needs, and helps them out in their duties. Otherwise 
his life would be extinguished, his spirit flee, and his body fall apart.

TWENTY-FIRST FLASH

219

Similarly, the components of a factory’s machinery cannot compete with 
one another in rivalry, take precedence over each other, or dominate each 
other.  They  cannot  spy  out  one  another’s  faults  and  criticize  each  other, 
destroy the other’s eagerness for work, and cause him to become idle. They 
rather assist each other’s motions with all their capacity in order to achieve 
the common goal; they march towards the aim of their creation in true soli-
darity and unity. If even the slightest aggression or desire to dominate were 
to interfere, it would throw the factory into confusion, cancelling its products 
and results. The factory’s owner would then demolish the factory entirely.

O R i s a l e - i   N u r  students and servants of the Qur’an! You and I are mem-
bers of such a collective personality, worthy of the title of the perfect man. 
We are like the components of a factory’s machinery which produces eternal 
happiness  within  eternal  life.  We  are  hands  working  on  a  dominical  boat 
which will disembark the community of Muhammad ( UWBP ) at the realm 
of peace, the shore of salvation. So we are surely in need of solidarity and 
true union, obtained through gaining sincerity – for the mystery of sincer-
ity secures through four individuals the moral strength of one thousand one 
hundred and eleven – indeed, we are compelled to obtain it.

Yes, if three a l i f s  do not unite, they have the value of three, but on unit-
ing, through the mystery of numbers they acquire the value of one hundred 
and eleven. If four times four remain apart, they have a value of sixteen. But 
if, through the mystery of brotherhood and having a common goal and joint 
duty, they unite coming together shoulder to shoulder on a line, they acquire 
the strength and value of four thousand four hundred and forty-four. Indeed, 
numerous historical events testify that the moral strength and value of six-
teen self-sacrificing brothers have exceeded that of four thousand. 

The underlying reason for this mystery is this: each member of a true, 
sincere union may see with the eyes of the other brothers, and hear with their 
ears, as if each person of a true union of ten acquires the value and strength 
to see with twenty eyes, think with ten minds, hear with twenty ears, and 
work with twenty hands. 1

1.   Yes,  through  the  mystery  of  sincerity  heartfelt  solidarity  and  union  produce  in-
numerable benefits, and are also an effective shield and point of support against fear, and 
even death. For if death comes, it takes one spirit. But since through the mystery of true 
brotherhood on the way of divine pleasure in works connected with the hereafter there are 
spirits to the number of brothers, if one of them dies, he meets death happily, saying: “ My 
other spirits remain alive, for they in effect make life continue for me by constantly earn-
ing me reward, so I am not dying. I live in respect of merit through their spirits; I am only 
dying in respect of sin. ” And he lays down in peace.

220

YOUR THIRD RULE

THE FLASHES

You should know that all your strength lies in sincerity and truth. Yes, 
strength lies in truth and sincerity. Even those who do wrong gain strength 
from their sincerity in their wrongdoing.

Evidence that strength lies in truth and sincerity is this service of ours. 
A small amount of sincerity in our work proves this claim and is evidence 
for itself. For seven or eight years of service to learning and religion here 
has surpassed a hundredfold the twenty years of service I performed in my 
native region and in Istanbul. And in these places the people assisting me 
were a hundred or even a thousand times more numerous than my brothers 
who work together with me here, where I am alone, with no one, a stranger, 
semi-literate,  under  the  surveillance  of  unfair  officials  and  persecuted  by 
them. I have absolutely no doubt that the service I have carried out with you 
these seven or eight years and the moral strength which has resulted in suc-
cess a hundred times greater than formerly, has arisen from your sincerity. 
I have also to confess that by your heartfelt sincerity, you have saved me to 
an extent from the hypocrisy which used to flatter my soul under the veil of 
fame and renown. Allah willing, you will be successful in gaining absolute 
sincerity, and you will cause me to gain it too.

You should be aware that it is because of this mystery of sincerity that 
‘Ali 1 ( May Allah be pleased with him ) and Ghawth al-A‘zam 2 ( May his 
mystery  be  sanctified )  honour  you  with  their  miraculous  wonderworking 
and wondrous vision of the Unseen. They offer you consolation in protect-
ing manner and applaud your service. Yes, you should have no doubt that 
this attention of theirs is because of sincerity. If you knowingly harm it, it is 
from them that you will receive punishment. You should bear in mind “ the 
blows of compassion ” in the Tenth Flash.

If you want to be backed by the support of such spiritual heroes, and have 
them as masters at your head, gain complete sincerity in accordance with the 
verse, Ë Ê É ( 59:9 )  Prefer your brothers’ souls to your own 
soul in honour, rank, acclaim, and in the things your soul enjoys like mate-
rial  benefits,  and  even  in  such  innocent,  harmless  benefits  as  informing 

1.  ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib: the son of the Prophet Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) uncle, who from 
a young age was brought up by the Prophet ( UWBP ), who later married him to his daugh-
ter, Fatima. ‘Alī was one of the first to believe in the Qur’anic revelation, and was famous 
for his heroism in battle. He became the fourth caliph.

2.  Sayyid ‘Abd al-Qādir Gīlānī ( Geylanî ), known as the Gawth al-A‘zam, was the 
eponym of the Qadiri Order and a towering spiritual figure in the history of Islam. He lived

a needy believer about one of the fine truths of belief. If possible, encour-
age one of your disinclined companions to inform him, so that your soul 
does not become conceited. If you have the desire to tell him the edifying 
matter to gain the reward, it surely is not a sin and there is no harm in it, 
but the essence of sincerity between you might be damaged.

YOUR FOURTH RULE

This is to imagine your brothers’ virtues and merits in your own selves, 
and to thankfully take pride at their glory. The Sufis have terms they use 
among  themselves,  “ annihilation  in  the  shaykh, ”  “ annihilation  in  the 
Prophet; ” I am not a Sufi, but these principles of theirs make a good rule 
in our way, in the form of “ annihilation in the brothers. ” Among brothers 
this is called “ t e f â n î ; ” that is, “ annihilation in one another. ” That is to say, 
to forget the feelings of one’s own carnal soul, and live in one’s mind with 
one’s brothers’ virtues and feelings. In any event, the basis of our way is 
brotherhood; it is not the relationship ( lit. means ) between father and son, or 
shaykh and follower; it is that of true brotherhood. At the very most a Mas-
ter  [ Ustad ]  intervenes.  Our  way  is  the  closest  friendship.  This  friendship 
necessitates  being  the  closest  friend,  the  most  sacrificing  companion,  the 
most appreciative comrade, the noblest brother. The essence of such friend-
ship is true sincerity. The person who spoils this true sincerity falls from the 
high pinnacle of this friendship, possibly to the bottom of a deep depression. 
There is nothing onto which he may cling in between.

Yes, the way is seen to be two. There is the possibility that those who part 
now from this way of ours, the great highway of the Qur’an, are unknow-
ingly helping the forces of irreligion, who are hostile to us. Allah willing, 
those who enter the sacred bounds of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition 
by way of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  will always add strength to light, sincerity, and 
belief, and will avoid such pitfalls.

O my companions in the service of the Qur’an! One of the most effec-
tive  means  of  attaining  and  preserving  sincerity  is  “ contemplation  of 
death. ” Yes, just as worldly ambition damages sincerity and drives a person 
to  hypocrisy  and  the  world,  so  the  contemplation  of  death  causes  disgust 
at  hypocrisy  and  gains  sincerity.  That  is,  to  think  of  death  and  grasp  that 
this world is transient, and so be saved from the tricks of the soul. Yes, the 
instruction the Sufis and people of truth received from such verses of the 
All-Wise Qur’an as,  q p o n ( 3:185 )   Ö Õ Ô Ó ( 39:30 )  
led them to make the contemplation of death fundamental to their spiritual 

222

THE FLASHES

journeyings; it dispelled the illusion of eternity, the source of worldly ambi-
tion. They imagined themselves to be dead and being placed in the grave. 
With prolonged thought the evil-commanding soul becomes saddened and 
affected  by  such  imagining  and  gives  up  its  far-reaching  ambitions  and 
hopes to an extent. There are numerous advantages in this contemplation. It 
is taught by the Hadith which says something like, 
ّذَ
 1 ِتاَ
ّ(cid:171)(cid:170)ا ِمِداَ(cid:182) َرﯰﯦِذ اوُرِ(cid:103)ﯰﯦَا
However, since our way is not that of the Sufis but of reality, we are not 
compelled to perform this contemplation in an imaginary and hypothetical 
form like they do. To do so is anyway not in conformity with the way of real-
ity. Our way is not to bring the future to the present by thinking of the end, 
but to travel in the mind to the future from the present in respect of reality, 
and to gaze on it. Yes, dispensing with the need to imagine, one may look 
on one’s own corpse, the single fruit on the tree of this brief life. One may 
look on one’s own death, and if one goes a bit further, see the death of this 
century, and going further still, observe the death of this world, opening up 
the way to complete sincerity.

The Second Means: By attaining a sense of the divine presence through 
the strength of certain, affirmative belief and through the lights proceeding 
from reflective thought on creatures which leads to knowledge of the Maker; 
by thinking that the Compassionate Creator is all-present and seeing; and by 
not seeking the attention of any other than He, and realizing that looking to 
others in His presence or seeking help from them is contrary to right conduct 
in His presence, one may be saved from such hypocrisy and gain sincerity. 
However, this comprises many degrees and stages. Whichever degree a per-
son reaches, he will profit to that extent. There are numerous truths in the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  that will save a person from hypocrisy and gain him sincerity, 
so referring him to those, we cut short the discussion here.

Of the very many things that destroy sincerity and drive one to hypocrisy, 

we shall briefly explain two or three.

The First

The First: Rivalry towards material advantages slowly destroys sincer-
ity. It is also detrimental to the results of our service. So too it causes the 
material benefits to be lost. This nation has always nurtured respect for those 
who work for reality and the hereafter, and has assisted them. With the inten-
tion of actively sharing in their genuine sincerity and in the works they carry

a l - M u s t a d r a k , iv, 321.

TWENTY-FIRST FLASH

223

out devotedly, it has always showed respect by assisting them with material 
benefits like alms and gifts to save them from preoccupation with securing 
their material needs and wasting their time. But such assistance and benefit 
may not be sought; it is given. It may not even be sought through the tongue 
of disposition by inwardly desiring it or awaiting it. It should rather be given 
unexpectedly, otherwise sincerity will be harmed. It would otherwise bring 
a person close to the prohibition stated by the verse,

and in part destroys the action.

( 2:41 ) ^ ] \ [ Z

The evil-commanding soul selfishly excites a feeling of rivalry towards 
a true brother and companion in that particular service by first desiring and 
expecting such a material benefit, then not allowing it to go to someone else. 
Sincerity is damaged, and the sacredness of the service is lost, and the per-
son becomes disagreeable in the eyes of the people of reality. He also loses 
the material benefit. This subject needs much discussion, but I shall curtail 
it and only mention two examples which will strengthen sincerity and true 
union between my true brothers.

F i r s t   E x a m p l e :   ‘The  worldly,’  and  even  certain  politicians  and  secret 
societies and manipulators of society, have adopted as their guiding princi-
ple, that of shared property, in order to procure wealth and power. They do 
acquire an extraordinary strength and advantage, despite all their exploita-
tion and losses. However, the nature of common property does not change 
with sharing, despite its many harms. Although each partner is as though the 
owner and supervisor of the rest in one respect, he is unable to profit from it.
Nevertheless, if the principle of shared property is applied to the works of 
the hereafter, it accumulates vast benefits and produces no loss. For it means 
that all the property passes to the hands of each partner. For example, there 
are four or five men. With the idea of sharing, one of them brings paraffin, 
another a wick, another the lamp, another the mantle, and the fifth matches; 
they assemble the lamp and light it. Each of them becomes the owner of a 
complete lamp. If each of those partners has a full-length mirror on a wall, 
the lamp will be reflected in everyone’s mirror together with the room, with-
out deficiency or being split up.

Just  the  same  are  mutual  participation  in  the  goods  of  the  hereafter 
through the mystery of sincerity, and co-operation through the mystery of 
brotherhood,  and  joint  enterprise  through  the  mystery  of  unity:  the  total 
obtained  by  those  joint  acts,  and  all  the  light,  enters  the  book  of  good 
deeds of each person taking part. This is a fact and has been witnessed by 

224

THE FLASHES

the people of reality. It is required also by the breadth of divine mercy and 
munificence.

My  brothers!  Allah  willing,  material  benefits  will  not  provoke  rivalry 
among you. You may possibly be deceived in regard to the benefits of the 
hereafter like some of those who follow the Sufi path. But how can some 
personal, minor merit be compared with the merit and light manifested in 
respect of the shared actions mentioned in the above example?

S e c o n d   E x a m p l e :   Craftsmen  are  obtaining  significant  wealth  by  co-
operating so as to profit more from the products of their crafts. Formerly ten 
manufacturers of sewing needles all worked on their own, and the fruit of 
their individual labour was three needles a day. Then following the rule of 
the division of labour the ten men united. One brought the iron, one lit the 
furnace, one pierced the needles, one placed them in the furnace, and another 
sharpened the points, and so on; each was occupied with only part of the 
process of needle-making. Since the work in which one man was employed 
was simple, he did not waste time; he acquired skill and performed the work 
with considerable speed. The manufacturers divided up the work performed 
in  accordance  with  the  rule  of  joint  enterprise  and  the  division  of  labour: 
they saw that instead of three needles a day for each man, it worked out at 
three hundred. This event was widely published among the craftsmen of ‘the 
worldly’ in order to encourage them to pool their labour.

The Second Obstacle Destroying Sincerity

My  brothers!  Since  union  and  accord  in  worldly  matters  and  in  dense 
materials  yield  such  results  and  advantages,  you  can  compare  how  vastly 
profitable it is for each to reflect in his own mirror through divine grace the 
light of all, which is luminous and pertains to the hereafter and does not need 
to be divided up and fragmented, and to gain the equivalent reward of all 
of them. This huge profit should not be lost through rivalry and insincerity.
The Second Obstacle Destroying Sincerity: This is to flatter the ego 
and  give  high  status  to  the  evil-commanding  soul  by  attracting  attention 
to oneself and public acclaim, driven by the desire for fame, renown, and 
position. This is a serious spiritual sickness that also opens the door to the 
hypocrisy and self-centredness called the hidden association of partners with 
Allah, and damages sincerity.

My brothers! Our way in the service of the Qur’an is reality and broth-
erhood,  and  the  true  meaning  of  brotherhood  is  to  annihilate  one’s  per-
sonality  among  one’s  brothers  1  and  to  prefer  their  souls  to  one’s  own. 

1.  Yes, happy is he who, in order to gain access to a large pool of fresh water filtered 
from the spring of the Qur’an, casts his personality and egotism – which are like blocks of 
ice – into the pool and melts them.

TWENTY-FIRST FLASH

225

Rivalry  of  this  sort  arising  from  desire  for  rank  and  position  should  not 
therefore be provoked. It is altogether opposed to our way. The brothers’ 
honour may be all the individuals’ generally; so I am hopeful that sacrific-
ing that great collective honour for personal, selfish, competitive, minor 
fame  and  renown  is  far  from  being  something  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students 
would  do.  Yes,  the  heart,  mind,  and  spirit  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students 
would not stoop to such lowly, harmful, inferior things. But everyone has 
an evil-commanding soul, and sometimes the soul’s emotions affect cer-
tain veins of character, and predominate to an extent in spite of the heart, 
mind, and spirit. I am not accusing your hearts, minds, and spirits; I have 
confidence in you because of the effect of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . But the soul, 
desires, emotions, and imagination sometimes deceive. For this reason you 
sometimes receive severe warnings. The severity looks to the soul, emo-
tions, desires, and imagination; act cautiously.

Yes, if our way had been subjection to a shaykh, there would have been 
a single rank, or limited ranks, and numerous capacities would have been 
appointed  to  them.  There  could  have  been  envy  and  selfishness.  But  our 
way is brotherhood. Among brothers there is no position of father, nor can 
they assume the position of spiritual guide. In brotherhood ranks are broad 
and cannot be the cause of envious jostling. At the most brother helps and 
supports brother; he completes his service. Evidence that much harm and 
many dangers have resulted from the envy, greed for spiritual reward, and 
high aspirations of the paths of spiritual guides are the conflict and rivalry 
among those who follow them despite their vast attainments, perfections and 
benefits, which have had the disastrous consequence of their vast and sacred 
power being unable to withstand the gales of innovation.

The Third Obstacle

The  Third  Obstacle:  This  is  fear  and  greed.  This  obstacle  has  been 
explained comprehensively in  T h e   S i x   A t t a c k s   1 together with other obsta-
cles. We therefore refer you to that, and making all the most beautiful names

A Confidential Letter to Some of my Brothers

I  shall  mention  a  point  concerning  two  Hadiths  to  my  brothers  who 
become  bored  of  writing,  and  prefer  other  recitations  during  the  Three 
Months, the months of worship, to writing out the R i s a l e - i   N u r , although to 
do this is worship in five respects. 1 The two Hadiths are these:

those  who  adhere  to  and  serve  the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  practices  and  the 
Qur’an’s  truths  when  innovations  and  misguidance  are  rife  may  gain  the 
reward of a hundred martyrs.

O my brothers who weary of writing out of laziness! And O my brothers 
who lean to Sufism! These two Hadiths show that the black light flowing 
from your blessed, pure pens serving the truths of belief and mysteries of the 
Shari‘a and practices of the Prophet ( UWBP ) at a time such as this – even a 
drop of their water-of-life-like ink – may win for you on the Day of Judge-
ment reward equal to a hundred drops of martyrs’ blood. So try to win it!
I f   y o u   s a y :  It says scholars in the Hadith and some of us are only scribes.
T h e   A n s w e r :  Anyone who reads these treatises for a year and compre-
hends  and  accepts  them,  may  become  a  valuable,  exacting  scholar  at  this 
time. Even if he does not understand them, since the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students 
have a collective personality, doubtless it is learned. As for your pens, they 
are  the  immaterial  fingers  of  that  collective  personality.  With  your  good 
opinion of me, you have afforded me the position of Master ( U s t a d  ) and 
religious scholar, and attached yourselves to me although in my view I am 
unworthy. I am unlettered and have difficulty in writing, so your pens may 
be thought of as mine; you will receive the reward indicated in the Hadith.

1.  We asked for an explanation of the five sorts of worship which our Master indicates 

in this valuable letter. The explanation we received is below:

i. To strive against the people of misguidance, the most important struggle.
ii. To serve our Master in the form of helping him spread the truth.
iii. To serve M u s l i m s  in respect of belief.
iv. To obtain knowledge by means of the pen.
v. To perform worship in the form of reflective thought, one hour of which may some-

times be equal to a year’s worship.                                    Signed: R ü ş t ü ,   H ü s r e v,   R e ’ f e t

FIRST INDICATION

A n   i m p o r t a n t   q u e s t i o n   a b o u t   m y   p e r s o n   a n d   t h e   R i s a l e - i   N u r :  many 
people  ask,  “ Although  you  have  not  meddled  in  ‘the  worldly’s’  world, 
why do they meddle in your hereafter at every opportunity? Whereas no 
government’s laws interfere with recluses and people who have abandoned 
the world? ”

The  Answer:  The  New  Said’s  reply  to  this  question  is  silence.  The 
New Said says: “ Let divine determining give the answer for me. ” Nev-
ertheless,  since  I’m  compelled  to,  the  Old  Said’s  head,  which  the  New 
Said has borrowed on trust, says: those who should give the answer to this 
question are the authorities of Isparta Province, and its people. For they 
are much more concerned with the meaning underlying this question than 
I am. Since the administration, which consists of thousands of people, and 
the people, who number hundreds of thousands, are obliged to consider it 
and defend it in my place, why should I speak with the prosecutors unnec-
essarily, and defend myself?

I have been in this province for nine years, and I am gradually turning 
my back more and more on their world. No aspect of my life has remained 
hidden. Even my most secret and confidential treatises have come into the 
hands  of  the  government  and  some  of  the  deputies.  If  I  had  meddled  at 
all in worldly matters, which would have caused ‘the worldly’ alarm and 
anxiety, or if I had made any attempt to meddle, or if I had had any idea 
of doing so, this province and the local government in the towns would 
have  known.  But  although  I  have  been  under  their  scrutiny  and  surveil-
lance for nine years, and I too have not hesitated to divulge my secrets to 
those who have visited me, the authorities have remained silent and have 
not bothered me. If I had displayed any fault that could have been harm-
ful to this country’s happiness and future, and to its people, over this nine 
years everyone from the Governor to the village police chief would have 
been responsible. So to save themselves from such responsibility they are 
obliged to defend me in the face of those who make molehills into moun-
tains  concerning  me,  and  make  the  mountains  into  molehills.  In  which 
case, I refer this question to them to answer.

The reason the people of this province are mostly obliged to defend me 
more than I do myself is that with hundreds of treatises that have demon-
strated their effectiveness materially and in fact, I have worked these nine 
years  for  their  eternal  life  and  strength  of  belief  and  happiness  in  life, 

TWENTY-SECOND FLASH

for they are both brothers, and friends, and blessed; and no upset or harm 
at all has been suffered by anyone on account of the treatises; and not the 
slightest  sign  of  anything  political  or  worldly  has  been  encountered;  and, 
praise be to Allah, by means of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , this province of Isparta has 
gained in respect of strength of belief and firmness in religion a degree of 
blessedness resembling the blessedness of Damascus in former times and of 
al-Azhar in Egypt; and the R i s a l e - i   N u r  has made the power of belief prevail 
over indifference and the desire to worship prevail over vice in the province, 
and  has  made  it  more  religious  than  any  other  province.  Since  this  is  the 
case, all its people, even supposing they are irreligious, are obliged to defend 
me and the R i s a l e - i   N u r . While they have such important rights of defence, 
my unimportant right does not drive me to defend myself now that I, lacking 
all power, have completed my duty and, thanks be to Allah, thousands of 
students have worked and are working in my place. Someone with so many 
thousands of advocates does not defend his own case.

SECOND INDICATION

The answer to a critical question.
‘T h e   w o r l d l y ’  a s k :   “ Why  are  you  angry  with  us?  You  have  not  made 
application to us even once, and are silent. You complain about us bitterly, 
saying that we are unjust towards you. But we have our principles, we have 
our particular rules as demanded by the times, and you do not accept that 
they should be applied to you. The person who applies the law is not a tyrant, 
and the person who does not accept the law is rebellious. For instance, in 
this age of freedom and new republican era which we have inaugurated, the 
principle – on the basis of equality – of abolishing oppression and subjuga-
tion of others is as though our fundamental law. However, it is understood 
from your open behaviour and your adventurous life in the former period 
that whether by assuming the position of  h o j a  or of being an ascetic, you 
try  to  draw  the  public  gaze  on  yourself  and  attract  attention,  so  to  secure 
a power and social position outside the government’s influence. This may 
appear desirable within – according to current terminology – the despotic 
tyranny of the bourgeoisie. But since the principles of pure socialism and 
bolshevism, which have emerged with the awakening and ascendancy of the 
common people, are more conformable with our interests, we have accepted 
them, and your position is disagreeable to us; it opposes our principles. For 
this reason you do not have the right to complain about or be angry at the 
distress we cause you. ”

THE FLASHES

The  Answer:  If  someone  who  opens  up  a  new  way  in  the  life  of 
human society does not act in conformity with the natural laws in force in 
the universe, he cannot be successful in beneficial works and in progress. 
All  his  acts  come  to  serve  the  interests  of  evil  and  destruction.  Since 
actions have to be in conformity with the natural laws, absolute equality 
can be applied only by changing human nature and removing the funda-
mental wisdom in the mankind’s creation. Yes, by birth and the way I 
have lived I am from the class of common people, and I am one of those 
who by temperament and intellectually have accepted the way of equal-
ity  of  rights.  And  due  to  compassion  and  the  justice  proceeding  from 
Islam, I am a person who for a long time has opposed and worked against 
the despotism and oppression of the elite class called the bourgeoisie. I 
therefore support total justice with all my strength, and oppose tyranny, 
oppression, arbitrary power, and despotism.

However,  human  nature  and  the  underlying  wisdom  in  humankind 
are contrary to the law of absolute equality. For to demonstrate His per-
fect power and wisdom, the All-Wise Creator produces many crops from 
a  single  thing,  causes  many  books  to  be  written  on  a  single  page,  and 
causes  many  functions  to  be  performed  by  a  single  thing;  and  in  the 
same way, He causes the duties of thousands of species to be carried out 
by  humankind.  It  is  because  of  this  great  mystery  that  Almighty  Allah 
created man with a nature that would produce the shoots of thousands of 
species and display the levels of the thousands of other species of living 
creatures. No limit was placed on his powers, subtle faculties, and senses 
like  the  other  animals;  since  He  left  him  free  and  gave  him  a  capacity 
whereby his senses could roam through endless degrees, although only 
one species, mankind became like thousands of species. For this reason, 
man became vicegerent of the earth, the result of the universe, and mon-
arch of animate beings.

The most important leaven and mechanism giving rise to the variety in 
mankind is competition and the true virtue resulting from belief. Virtue can 
only be removed through changing human nature, extinguishing the reason, 
killing the heart, and annihilating the spirit. Yes, this age with its awesome 
tyranny under the veil of freedom deserves to be struck in the face with the 
following masterly lines, which, written by a most important person, 1 have 
been wrongly brandished in his face, although he deserved no slap:

1.  Namık Kemal ( 1840-1888 ) in his famous ‘Freedom Ode ( K a s i d e  )’.

In place of these lines, I say, in order to strike this age in the face:

Or,

Yes, just as the virtue arising from belief cannot be the cause of oppres-
sion, so it cannot be the cause of despotism. Oppression and arbitrary des-
potism indicate the absence of virtue. The chief way the people of virtue in 
particular interfere in the life of society is through impotence, poverty, and 
humility. All praise be to Allah, my life has passed on this way, and is pass-
ing on it. I do not claim this out of pride, saying that I possess some virtue. I 
say the following as thanks and to make known a divine bounty:

Through His grace and munificence, Almighty Allah bestowed on me 
the virtue of working for the sciences of belief and the Qur’an. All praise 
be to Allah, throughout my life I have spent this divine bounty for the 
benefit and happiness of this Muslim nation, and just as at no time have 
I  used  it  to  dominate  and  oppress  people,  so  for  an  important  reason  I 
detest public attention and being fêted by people, which is sought after 
by the neglectful; I flee from it. Twenty years of my former life were lost 
because  of  it,  so  I  look  on  it  as  harmful  for  me.  But  since  I  know  that 
public attention is a sign that the people like the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , I do not 
put them off.

O you whose view is restricted to the life of this world! In no way have I 
meddled in your world, nor have I had anything to do with your principles, 
nor  as  is  testified  to  by  my  life  these  nine  years  of  captivity,  have  I  had 
any intention or desire to meddle in the world again. So according to what 
law have you inflicted all this surveillance and oppression on me as though 
I  were  an  old  oppressor  who  was  ever  ready  to  seize  an  opportunity  and 
supported the idea of tyranny and despotism? No government in the world 
permits such treatment over and above the law, nor is it recommended by 
anyone. It is not only me who is sick of the ill-treatment I have had meted 
out to me so far, if they knew of it all mankind would be disgusted, and even 
the universe!

THIRD INDICATION

THE FLASHES

A fallacious, crazy question.
S o m e   m e m b e r s   o f   t h e   j u d i c i a r y   s a y :  “ Since you reside in this country, 
you should abide by its republican laws. So why do you elude those laws 
under the cloak of being a recluse? For instance, according to the present 
laws of the government, it is opposed to one of the principles of the republic, 
which is based on equality, to assume some virtue, some merit, outside one’s 
duty, and through it to dominate some of the nation and exercise power and 
influence. Why do you have your hand kissed, though you hold no position? 
Why do you assume a position advertising yourself and wanting the people 
to listen to you? ” 

The Answer: Those who apply the law, may apply it to others after first 
applying it to themselves. If you apply a principle to others which you have 
not applied to yourselves, you are infringing and opposing your own princi-
ple and law before anyone. You want to apply this law of absolute equality 
to me. So I say this:

Whenever a common soldier rises to the social rank of a field marshal and 
shares in the respect and acclaim the nation shows to the field marshal and 
is the object of acclaim and respect the same as him; or whenever the field 
marshal becomes as common as the soldier and assumes the soldier’s lowly 
position  and  he  retains  no  value  whatsoever  outside  his  duty;  and  when-
ever the most brilliant military commander who leads the army to victories 
receives public acclaim, respect and affection equal to that of the dimmest 
common soldier; then as required by this law of equality of yours, you can 
tell me: “ Don’t call yourself a h o j a ! Don’t accept respect! Deny your virtue! 
Serve the servants, and take beggars as your friends! ”

I f   y o u   s a y :  “ Respect, social position, and public attention are in regard 
to functions and particular to those who perform them when they are per-
forming them. But you have no function, so you may not accept the people’s 
respect as though you did have one. ”

The Answer: If man consisted only of a body, and he were going to live 
in this world for ever, and if the door of the grave were closed and death had 
been killed, then his duties and functions would have been limited to those 
of  the  army  and  government  officials,  and  what  you  say  would  have  had 
some meaning. But since man does not consist only of a body, and his heart, 
tongue, mind, and brain cannot be plucked out to feed his body; they cannot 
be annihilated; they too have to be administered.

TWENTY-SECOND FLASH

233

And since the door of the grave does not close, and since anxiety for the 
future beyond the grave is the most pressing question for everyone, then the 
duties based on the respect and obedience of the nation are not restricted to 
the social, political, and military duties looking to its worldly life. Yes, just 
as it is a duty to give a passport to those travelling abroad, so is it a duty to 
give a passport to those travelling to post-eternity and to give them a light 
for that dark way, and there is no other duty so important. It is a duty that can 
be denied only by denying death and giving the lie to the testimony of the 
thirty thousand witnesses who every day set their signatures with the seals of 
their corpses on the claim “ Death is a reality, ” affirming it. 

Since there are moral and spiritual duties based on moral and spiritual 
needs, and the most important of those duties are the passport for the jour-
ney to post-eternity, and the pocket-torch of the heart in the darkness of the 
Intermediate Realm, and belief, the key to eternal happiness, and instruction 
in belief and its strengthening, for sure, the learned who perform those duties 
will not with ingratitude count as nothing the divine bounties bestowed on 
them and the virtues arising from belief, and descend to the level of sinners 
and  the  dissolute.  They  will  not  soil  themselves  with  the  innovations  and 
vices of the inferior. Thus, the solitude which you do not like and suppose to 
be inequality is because of this.

In addition to this truth I say the following, not to those like you who tor-
ment and pester me and who in egotism and contempt of the law of equality 
are as overweening as the Pharaoh – for the arrogant suppose humility to be 
abasement, so one should not be humble before them – I say rather to the 
fair-minded, the modest, and the just:

All praise be to Allah, I know my faults and impotence. I do not arro-
gantly  want  any  position  superior  to  Muslims  which  demands  respect.  I 
am  always  aware  of  my  endless  faults  and  utter  insignificance.  Finding 
consolation  by  seeking  divine  forgiveness,  I  want  not  respect  from  the 
people,  but  their  prayers.  I  reckon  all  my  friends  know  of  this  way  of 
mine. However, while serving the All-Wise Qur’an and teaching the truths 
of belief, in order to preserve the dignity and pride of learning that such 
a  rank  requires,  on  account  of  those  truths  and  in  honour  of  the  Qur’an 
and  in  order  not  to  bow  before  the  people  of  misguidance,  I  temporar-
ily assume that dignified stance. I do not think ‘the worldly’s’ laws can 
oppose these points!

THE FLASHES

Some Astonishing Treatment

It  is  well-known  that  everywhere  teachers  judge  in  accordance  with 
knowledge and learning. Out of love of their profession, in whomever and 
wherever they encounter knowledge and learning, they will nurture friend-
ship  and  respect  for  the  person  concerned.  If  a  professor  from  an  enemy 
country visits this country even, teachers will visit him out of respect for his 
knowledge and learning, and offer him respect.

However,  when  the  highest  learned  council  of  the  English  asked  for  a 
six-hundred-word answer to six questions they asked the Shaykh al-Islam’s 
Office, a scholar and teacher who has met with the disrespect of the educa-
tion  authorities  here,  answered  those  six  questions  with  six  words  which 
met with approval, and answered with true knowledge and learning the most 
basic principles of the Europeans and their philosophers, and defeated them. 
Through  the  strength  he  received  from  the  Qur’an,  he  challenged  those 
European philosophers. And in Istanbul six months before the proclamation 
of the Second Constitution, he invited both the religious scholars and schol-
ars of modern science to debate, and himself asking no questions answered 
completely correctly without exception all questions posed to him. 1 Those 
who have caused most distress to this scholar and teacher – who has devoted 
all his life to the happiness of this nation, and publishing hundreds of trea-
tises in the people’s own language of Turkish has illuminated them, and is 
both a fellow-citizen and a co-religionist and friend and brother – those who 
have nurtured enmity towards him, and indeed been disrespectful towards 
him, have been certain members of the educational establishment as well as 
a few official h o j a s .

What have you got to say to this? Is this civilization? Is it encouraging 
education?  Is  it  patriotism?  Is  it  love  of  the  nation?  Is  it  republicanism? 
Allah forbid! It is nothing at all! It is rather that divine determining showed 
hostility where this scholar and teacher hoped for friendship so that hypoc-
risy would not become mixed with his learning due to respect, and he might 
gain sincerity.

1.  The New Said says: I do not concur with the words uttered here proudly by the 
Old Said, but I cannot silence him since I gave him say in this treatise. Thinking, Let him 
display a bit of egotism before the egotists, I am silent.

Conclusion 
An assault which in my view was astonishing, 
but was the cause of thanks

‘The  worldly,’  who  are  extraordinarily  egotistical,  are  so  sensitive  in 
their egotism that if it had been conscious, it would have reached the degree 
of wonderworking or of great genius. The matter in question was this: 

With the sensitive balance of their egotism, they perceive in me a little 
hypocritical egotism which I had not perceived with my soul and mind, and 
in violent fashion confront it. This eight or nine years I have experienced 
the following eight or nine times: after they have treated me wrongfully and 
unjustly, I have considered divine determining and searched out the tricks of 
my soul, asking why they been set to pester me. Each time I have understood 
that  my  soul  has  unconsciously  and  naturally  inclined  to  egotism,  or  else 
has knowingly deceived me. So then I have said that divine determining has 
acted justly towards me within those tyrants’ injustice.

For instance, this summer my friends mounted me on a fine horse and I 
rode out into the countryside. A selfish desire for pleasure awakened in me 
without my being aware of it, and ‘the worldly’ opposed that hidden desire 
of mine so violently that they destroyed both it, and my appetite for many 
other things. Even, for example, after Ramadan and learning of the allusions 
made to us by one of the great, holy imams of former times through his won-
derworking which penetrated the Unseen, and being faced with the piety and 
sincerity of my brothers and the respect and good opinion of visitors, with-
out my realizing it my soul wanted proudly to assume a hypocritical position 
under the veil of being thankful. Suddenly with their infinite sensitivity and 
in a way in which the very particles of hypocrisy could be felt, ‘the worldly’ 
attacked me. I thank Almighty Allah that their tyranny was a means of my 
gaining sincerity.

The Twenty-Third Flash 
On Nature 

[ First  written  as  the  Sixteenth  Note  of  the  Seventeenth  Flash,  this 
part of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  was later designated the Twenty-Third Flash 
because of its importance. For it puts naturalistic atheism to death with 
no chance of reanimation, and totally shatters the foundation stones of 
unbelief. ]

A Reminder

This treatise explains through nine ‘Impossibilities,’ them-
selves  comprising  at  least  ninety  impossibilities,  just  how 
unreasonable, crude and superstitious is the way taken by those 
Naturalists  who  are  atheists.  In  order  to  cut  short  the  discus-
sion here and because these impossibilities have been explained 
in part in other sections of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , some steps in the 
arguments have been skipped. It occurs to one, therefore, how 
is  it  that  those  famous  and  supposedly  brilliant  philosophers 
accepted such a blatantly obvious superstition, and continue to 
pursue  that  way.  Well,  the  fact  is  they  cannot  see  its  reality. 
And  I  am  ready  to  explain  in  detail  and  prove  through  clear 
and decisive arguments to whoever doubts it that these crude, 
repugnant  and  unreasonable  impossibilities  are  the  necessary 
and  unavoidable  result  of  their  way;  in  fact,  the  very  gist  of 
their creed. 1 

1.  What occasioned the writing of this treatise were the attacks being made on the 
Qur’an by those who called everything that their corrupted minds could not reach a super-
stition, who were using Nature to justify unbelief, and were vilifying the truths of belief in 
a most aggressive and ugly fashion. Their attacks stirred up in my heart an intense anger 
which resulted in those perverted atheists and falsifiers of the truth receiving vehement 
and harsh slaps. Otherwise, the way generally followed by the Risale-i Nur is a mild, polite 
and persuasive one.

By declaring through the use of a rhetorical question that there cannot 
and should not be any doubt about Allah Almighty, this verse clearly dem-
onstrates the divine existence and unity. 

A point to be mentioned before our discussion:
When  I  went  to  Ankara  in  1922,  the  morale  of  the  people  of  belief 
was  extremely  high  as  a  result  of  the  victory  of  the  army  of  Islam 
over the Greeks. But I saw that an abominable current of atheism was 
treacherously  trying  to  subvert,  poison  and  destroy  their  minds.  “ O 
Allah! ”  I  said,  “ this  monster  is  going  to  harm  the  fundamentals  of 
belief. ”  At  that  point,  since  the  above-mentioned  verse  makes  self-
evidently plain Allah’s existence and unity, I sought assistance from 
it and wrote a treatise in Arabic consisting of a proof taken from the 
All-Wise  Qur’an  that  was  powerful  enough  to  disperse  and  destroy 
that atheistic current. I had it printed in Ankara at the Yeni Gün Press. 
But, alas, those who knew Arabic were few and those who considered 
it seriously were rare. Also, its argument was in an extremely concise 
and abbreviated form. As a result, the treatise did not have the effect 
it should have done and sadly, the current of atheism both swelled and 
gained strength. Now, I feel compelled to explain a part of the proof 
in Turkish. Since certain parts of it have been fully explained in other 
sections of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , it will be written in summary form here. 
Those numerous proofs in part unite in this proof; so each may be seen 
as an element of this proof.

Introduction
O  man!  You  should  be  aware  that  there  are  certain  phrases  which  are 
commonly used and imply unbelief. The believers also use them, but with-
out realizing their implications. We shall explain three of the most important 
of them.

The First: “ Causes create this. ”
The Second: “ It forms itself; it comes into existence itself. ”
The Third: “ It is natural; nature necessitates and creates it. ”

238

THE FLASHES

Indeed, since beings exist and this cannot be denied, and since each being 
comes into existence in a wise and artistic fashion, and since none is pre-
eternal but each is being continuously renewed, then, O falsifier of the truth, 
you are bound to say either that the causes in the world create beings, for 
example, this animal; that is to say, it comes into existence through the com-
ing together of causes, or that it forms itself, or that its coming into exist-
ence  is  a  requirement  and  necessary  effect  of  nature,  or  that  it  is  created 
through the power of One All-Powerful and All-Glorious. Since reason can 
find no way apart from these four, if the first three are definitely proved to be 
impossible, invalid and absurd, the way of divine unity, which is the fourth 
way, will necessarily and self-evidently and without doubt or suspicion, be 
proved true.

THE FIRST WAY

This  to  imagine  that  the  formation  and  existence  of  things,  creatures, 
occurs through the coming together of causes in the universe. We shall men-
tion only three of its numerous impossibilities.

First Impossibility

First Impossibility

Imagine  there  is  a  pharmacy  in  which  are  found  hundreds  of  jars  and 
phials  filled  with  quite  different  substances.  A  living  potion  and  a  living 
remedy  are  required  from  those  medicaments.  So  we  go  to  the  pharmacy 
and see that they are to be found there in abundance, yet in great variety. 
We examine each of the potions and see that the ingredients have been taken 
in varying but precise amounts from each of the jars and phials, one ounce 
from  this,  three  from  that,  seven  from  the  next,  and  so  on.  If  one  ounce 
too much or too little had been taken, the potion would not have been liv-
ing  and  would  not  have  displayed  its  special  quality.  Next,  we  study  the 
living  remedy.  Again,  the  ingredients  have  been  taken  from  the  jars  in  a 
particular  measure  so  that  if  even  the  most  minute  amount  too  much  or 
too little had been taken, the remedy would have lost its special property.

Now, although the jars number more than fifty, the ingredients have been 
taken from each according to measures and amounts that are all different. Is 
it in any way possible or probable that the phials and jars should have been 
knocked over by a strange coincidence or sudden gust of wind and that only 
the precise, though different, amounts that had been taken from each of them 
should  have  been  spilt,  and  then  arranged  themselves  and  come  together 
to form the remedy? Is there anything more superstitious, impossible and 
absurd than this? If an ass could speak, it would say: “ I cannot accept this 
idea! ”, and would gallop off!

TWENTY-THIRD FLASH

239

Similarly, each living being may be likened to the living potion in the 
comparison,  and  each  plant  to  a  living  remedy.  For  they  are  composed 
of matter that has been taken in most precise measure from truly numer-
ous and truly various substances. If these are attributed to causes and the 
elements  and  it  is  claimed,  “ Causes  created  these, ”  it  is  unreasonable, 
impossible and absurd a hundred times over, just as it was to claim that 
the potion in the pharmacy came into existence through the phials being 
knocked over; by accident.

I n   S h o r t : The vital substances in this vast pharmacy of the universe, which 
are measured on the scales of divine determining and decree of the All-Wise 
and Pre-Eternal One, can only come into existence through a boundless wis-
dom, infinite knowledge and all-encompassing will. The unfortunate person 
who declares that they are the work of blind, deaf and innumerable elements 
and causes and natures, which stream like floods; and the foolish, delirious 
person  who  claims  that  that  wondrous  remedy  poured  itself  out  when  the 
phials were knocked over and formed itself, are certainly unreasonable and 
nonsensical. Indeed, such denial and unbelief is a senseless absurdity.
Second Impossibility

Second Impossibility

If everything is not attributed to the All-Powerful and All-Glorious One, 
who is the Single One of Unity, and is attributed to causes, it necessitates 
that many of the elements and causes present in the universe intervene in 
the being of every animate creature. Whereas that different and mutually 
opposing and conflicting causes should come together of their own accord 
in  complete  order,  with  the  finest  balance  and  in  perfect  concord  in  the 
being of a tiny creature, like a fly, is such an obvious impossibility that 
anyone with even an iota of consciousness would say: “ This is impossible; 
it could not be! ”

The tiny body of a fly is connected with most of the elements and causes 
in the universe; indeed, it is a summary of them. If it is not attributed to the 
Pre-Eternal and All-Powerful One, it is necessary for those material causes 
to be themselves present in the immediate vicinity of the fly; rather, for them 
all to enter into its tiny body; and even for them to enter each of the cells of 
its eyes, which are minute samples of its body. For if a cause is of a mate-
rial nature, it is necessary for it to be present in the immediate vicinity of, 
and inside, its effect. And this necessitates accepting that the constituents 
and elements of the universe are physically present inside that minute cell, 
a place too small even for the tip of its antenna, and that they work there in 
harmony like a master.

A way such as this, then, shames even the most foolish of the Sophists.

It is an established rule that,  ِد ِ(cid:110)اَوْ(cid:170)ا  ِنَ(cid:150)  َ

displays a comprehensive life within a perfect order and sensitive balance, 
it demonstrates self-evidently that it did not issue from numerous hands, 
which  are  the  cause  of  conflict  and  confusion,  but  that  it  issued  from  a 
single hand that is All-Powerful and All-Wise. Therefore, to attribute such 
a  well-ordered  and  well-balanced  being  which  has  unity  to  the  jumbled 
hands of innumerable, lifeless, ignorant, aggressive, unconscious, chaotic, 
blind and deaf natural causes, the blindness and deafness of which increase 
with their coming together and intermingling among the ways of number-
less possibilities, is as unreasonable as accepting innumerable impossibili-
ties all at once. If we leave this impossibility aside and assume that mate-
rial causes have effects, these effects can only occur through direct contact 
and touch. However, the contact of natural causes is with the exteriors of 
living beings. And yet we see that the interiors of such beings, where the 
hands of material causes can neither reach nor touch, are ten times more 
delicate, well-ordered and perfect as regards art than their exteriors. There-
fore, although tiny animate creatures, on which the hands and organs of 
material causes can in no way be situated, indeed they cannot touch the 
creatures’  exteriors  all  at  once  even,  are  more  strange  and  wonderful  as 
regards their art and creation than the largest creatures, to attribute them to 
those lifeless, unknowing, crude, distant, vast, conflicting, deaf and blind 
causes can result only from a deafness and blindness compounded to the 
number of animate beings.

THE SECOND WAY

This is expressed by the phrase “ It forms itself. ” It too involves many 
impossibilities  and  is  absurd  and  impossible  in  many  aspects.  We  shall 
explain three examples of these impossibilities.

First Impossibility

First Impossibility

O you obstinate denier! Your egotism has made you so stupid that some-
how  you  decide  to  accept  a  hundred  impossibilities  all  at  once.  For  you 
yourself are a being and not some simple substance that is inanimate and 
unchanging. You resemble an extremely well-ordered machine that is con-
stantly being renewed and a wonderful palace that is undergoing continuous 
change. Particles are working unceasingly in your body. Your body has a 
connection and mutual relations with the universe, in particular with regard 

TWENTY-THIRD FLASH

241

to sustenance and the perpetuation of the species, and the particles that work 
within it are careful not to spoil that relationship nor to break the connection. 
In this cautious manner they set about their work, as though taking the whole 
universe into account. Seeing your relationships within it, they take up their 
positions accordingly. And you benefit with your external and inner senses 
in accordance with the wonderful positions that they take. 

If you do not accept that the particles in your body are tiny officials in 
motion in accordance with the law of the Pre-Eternal and All-Powerful One, 
or that they are an army, or the nibs of the pen of divine determining with 
each particle as the nib of a pen, or that they are points inscribed by the pen 
of power with each particle being a point, then in every particle working in 
your eye there would have to be an eye such as could see every limb and part 
of your body as well as the entire universe, with which you are connected. 
In addition to this, you would have to ascribe to each particle an intelligence 
equivalent to that of a hundred geniuses, sufficient to know and recognize all 
your past and your future, and your forbears and descendants, the origins of 
all the elements of your being, and the sources of all your sustenance.

To  attribute  the  knowledge  and  intelligence  of  a  thousand  Plato’s  to  a 
single particle of one such as you who does not possess even a particle’s 
worth of intelligence in matters of this kind is a crazy superstition a thousand 
times over!

Second Impossibility

Second Impossibility

Your being resembles a thousand-domed wondrous palace in which the 
stones stand together in suspension and without support. Indeed, your being 
is  a  thousand  times  more  wonderful  than  such  a  palace,  for  the  palace  of 
your being is being renewed continuously in perfect order. Leaving aside 
your truly wonderful spirit, heart and other subtle faculties, each member of 
your body resembles a single-domed part of the palace. Like the stones of a 
dome, the particles stand together in perfect balance and order demonstrat-
ing the eye and the tongue, for example, each to be a wondrous building, 
extraordinary work of art, and miracle of power.

If  these  particles  were  not  officials  dependent  on  the  command  of  the 
master architect of the universe, then each would have to be both absolutely 
dominant over all the other particles in the body and absolutely subordinate 
to  each  of  them;  and  both  equal  to  each  and,  with  regard  to  its  dominant 
position, opposed; and both the origin and source of most of the attributes 
that pertain only to the Necessarily Existent One, and extremely restricted; 

242

THE FLASHES

and both in absolute form, and in the form of a perfectly ordered individual 
artefact that could only, through the mystery of unity, be the work of the 
Single One of Unity.

Anyone with even a particle of intelligence would understand what an 
obvious impossibility this is; to attribute such an artefact to those particles. 

Third Impossibility

Third Impossibility

If your being is not ‘written’ by the pen of the Pre-Eternal and All-Pow-
erful One, who is the Single One of Unity, and is instead ‘printed’ by nature 
and  causes,  there  would  have  to  be  printing-blocks  in  nature  not  only  to 
the number of cells in your body, but to the number of their thousands of 
combinations, which are arranged in concentric circles. For if this book, for 
example, which we hold in our hand is written, a single pen may write it 
relying on the knowledge of its writer. If, on the other hand, it is not written 
and is not attributed to its writer’s pen, and if it is said that it exists of its 
own accord or it is ascribed to nature, then, as a printed book, it would be 
necessary for there to be a different iron pen for each letter so that it could 
be printed. In a printing-press there have to be pieces of type to the number 
of letters in the alphabet so the letters in the book come into existence by 
means of them; pens to the number of those letters being necessary in place 
of a single pen.

As may be seen, sometimes a whole page is written in a single large let-
ter from among those letters with a small pen in fine script, in which case a 
thousand pens would be necessary for one letter. Rather, if it took the form 
of  your  body,  with  all  its  components  one  within  the  other  in  concentric 
circles, there would have to be printing-blocks in each circle, for each com-
ponent, to the number of the combinations that they form.

Now, see, if you claim this, which involves a hundred impossibilities, to 
be possible, then again if they are not attributed to a single pen, for those 
well-ordered, artistic pieces of type, faultless printing-blocks and iron pens 
to  be  made,  further  pens,  printing-blocks  and  letters  to  the  same  number 
as themselves would be necessary. And they too would have to have been 
made; and they too would have to have been well-ordered and artistically 
fashioned. And so on. It would carry on in succession a d   i n f i n i t u m .

There, you too understand! This way of thinking is such that it involves 
impossibilites and superstitions to the number of particles in your body. O 
denier of Allah! See this, and quit the way of misguidance!

243

TWENTY-THIRD FLASH

THE THIRD WAY

First Impossibility

“ Nature necessitates it; nature makes it. ” This statement contains many 

impossibilities. We shall mention three of them by way of examples.

First Impossibility

If  the  art  and  creativity,  which  are  discerning  and  wise,  to  be  seen  in 
beings  and  particularly  in  animate  beings  are  not  attributed  to  the  pen  of 
divine determining and power of the Pre-Eternal Sun, and instead are attrib-
uted to nature and force, which are blind, deaf and unthinking, it becomes 
necessary that nature either should have present in everything machines and 
printing-presses  for  their  creation,  or  should  include  in  everything  power 
and wisdom enough to create and administer the universe. The reason for 
this is as follows:

The sun’s manifestations and reflections appear in all small fragments of 
glass and droplets on the face of the earth. If those miniature, reflected imag-
inary suns are not ascribed to the sun in the sky, it is necessary to accept the 
external existence of an actual sun in every tiny fragment of glass smaller 
than a match-head, which possesses the sun’s qualities and which, though 
small in size, bears profound meaning; and therefore to accept actual suns to 
the number of pieces of glass.

In exactly the same way, if beings and animate creatures are not attrib-
uted directly to the manifestation of the Pre-Eternal Sun’s names, it becomes 
necessary to accept that in each being, and especially animate beings, there 
lies a nature, a force, or quite simply a god that will sustain an infinite power 
and will, and knowledge and wisdom. Such an idea is the most absurd and 
superstitious of all the impossibilities in the universe. It demonstrates that 
a  man  who  attributes  the  art  of  the  Creator  of  the  universe  to  imaginary, 
insignificant,  unconscious  nature  is  without  a  doubt  less  conscious  of  the 
truth than an animal.

Second Impossibility

Second Impossibility

If  beings,  which  are  most  well-ordered  and  well-measured,  wise  and 
artistically  fashioned,  are  not  ascribed  to  One  who  is  infinitely  powerful 
and wise and instead are attributed to nature, there has to be present in every 
bit of soil as many factories and printing-presses as there are in Europe so 
that each bit of soil can be the means for the growth and formation of innu-
merable flowers and fruits, of which it is the place of origin and workshop. 
The seeds of flowers are sown in turn in a bowl of soil, which performs the 

244

THE FLASHES

duty of a flower-pot for them. An ability is apparent in the bowl of soil that 
will give shapes and forms which differ greatly from one another to all the 
flowers sown in it. If that ability is not attributed to the All-Glorious and All-
Powerful One, such a situation could not occur without there being in the 
bowlful of soil immaterial, different and natural machines for each flower.
This is because the matter of which seeds, like sperm and eggs for exam-
ple, consists is the same. That is, they consist of an orderless, formless, paste-
like mixture of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen. Together with this, 
since air, water, heat and light also are each simple, unconscious and flow 
against  everything  in  floods,  the  fact  that  the  all-different  forms  of  those 
flowers  emerge  from  the  soil  in  a  most  well-ordered  and  artistic  fashion 
self-evidently and necessarily requires that there are present in the soil in the 
bowl immaterial, miniature printing-presses and factories to the number of 
presses and factories in Europe so that they could weave this great number 
of living fabrics and thousands of various embroidered textiles.

So  you  can  see  how  far  the  unbelieving  thought  of  the  Naturalists  has 
deviated from the realm of reason. And although brainless pretenders who 
imagine nature to be creator claim to be men of science and reason, see just 
how distant from reason and science is their thought, so that they have taken 
a  superstition  that  is  in  no  way  possible,  that  is  impossible,  as  a  way  for 
themselves. See this and laugh at them! 

I f   y o u   a s k :  If such extraordinary impossibilities and insurmountable dif-
ficulties occur when beings are attributed to nature, how are those difficulties 
removed when they are attributed to the Single and Eternally Besought One? 
And how is the difficult impossibility transformed into that easy necessity?
The Answer: We saw in the First Impossibility that the manifestation of 
the sun’s reflection displays its radiance and effect through miniature imagi-
nary  suns  with  complete  ease  and  lack  of  trouble  in  everything  from  the 
minutest fragment of glass to the surface of the vastest ocean. If each parti-
cle’s relationship with the sun is severed, it becomes necessary to accept that 
the external existence of an actual sun could subsist, with a difficulty at the 
level of impossibility, in each of those minute particles.

Similarly,  if  each  being  is  ascribed  directly  to  the  Single  Eternally 
Besought One, everything necessary for each being can be conveyed to it 
through a connection and manifestation with an ease and facility that is at 
the level of necessity. If the connection is severed and each being reverts 
from its position as an official to being without duties, and is left to nature 
and its own devices, it becomes necessary to suppose that, with a hundred 

TWENTY-THIRD FLASH

245

thousand  difficulties  and  obstacles  that  reach  the  degree  of  impossibility, 
blind nature possesses within it the power and wisdom to create and admin-
ister the universe so that it might bring into existence the wonderful machine 
of the being of an animate creature like a fly, which is a tiny index of the 
universe. This is impossible not just once but thousands of times over.

I n   S h o r t : Just as it is impossible and precluded for the Necessarily Exist-
ent  One  to  have  any  partner  or  like  in  respect  of  His  Essence,  so  too  is 
the interference of others in His dominicality and in His creation of beings 
impossible and precluded. 

As for the difficulties involved in the Second Impossibility, as is proved 
in many parts of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , if all things are attributed to the Single 
One of Unity, all things become as easy and trouble-free as a single thing. 
Whereas if they are attributed to causes and nature, a single thing becomes 
as difficult as all things. This has been demonstrated with numerous, deci-
sive proofs and a summary of one of them is as follows.

If  a  man  is  connected  to  the  king  by  being  a  soldier  or  an  official,  by 
reason of the strength of the connection he may perform duties far exceed-
ing  his  individual  strength.  He  may,  on  occasion,  capture  another  king  in 
the name of his own king. For he himself does not carry the equipment and 
sources of strength necessary to carry out the duties and work he performs, 
nor is he compelled to do so. By reason of the connection, the king’s treas-
uries, and the army, which is behind him and is his point of support, carry 
his equipment and sources of strength. That is to say, the duties he performs 
may be as grand as the business of a king, and as tremendous as the actions 
of an army.

Indeed,  through  being  an  official,  an  ant  destroyed  Pharaoh’s  palace; 
through the connection, a fly killed Nimrod off; and through the connection, 
the seed of a pine the size of a grain of wheat produces all the parts of a huge 
pine tree. 1

If the connection is severed and the man discharged from his duties as 
an  official,  he  will  be  compelled  to  carry  the  equipment  and  sources  of 

1.  Yes, through this connection, the seed receives an order from divine determining 
and displays those wonderful duties. If the connection were to be severed, the creation 
of the seed would require more equipment, power and art than the creation of the mighty 
pine tree. For it would be necessary for the pine tree out there on the mountain, which is 
the work of divine power, to be physically present together with all its limbs and parts in 
what is only the potential tree within the seed and is the work of divine determining. For 
the  mighty  tree’s  factory  is  the  seed.  The  determined,  potential  tree  within  it  becomes 
manifested in the external world through Divine power, and becomes a physical pine tree.

246

THE FLASHES

strength necessary for his work himself. He will then only be able to per-
form duties commensurate with the sources of strength and ammunition he 
is able to carry. If he is required in this situation to carry out his duties with 
the extreme ease of the first situation, it will be necessary to load on his back 
the sources of an army’s strength and the arsenals and munitions factories 
of a king. Even clowns who invent stories and superstitions to make people 
laugh would be ashamed at this fanciful idea.

I n    S h o r t :  To  attribute  all  beings  to  the  Necessarily  Existent  One  is  so 
easy as to be necessary, while to attribute their creation to nature is so dif-
ficult as to be impossible and outside the realm of reason.

First Comparison

The following two comparisons, which are included in other parts of the 

R i s a l e - i   N u r , explain this impossibility. 

A wild savage entered a palace which had been built in an empty desert 
and  completed  and  adorned  with  all  the  fruits  of  civilization.  He  cast  an 
eye over its interior and saw thousands of well-proportioned and artistically 
fashioned objects. Out of his boorishness and lack of intelligence, he said: 
“ No one from outside had a hand in this, one of the objects from inside must 
have made this palace together with all of its contents, ” and he started to 
investigate. But it did not appear possible even to his untaught intelligence 
that anything he had looked at could have made those things.

Later, he saw a notebook in which had been written the plan and pro-
gramme of the palace’s construction, an index of its contents and the rules of 
its administration. For sure, the notebook too, which was without hand, eye, 
or implement, like the rest of the objects in the palace, was completely lack-
ing the ability to construct and decorate the palace. But since he saw that in 
comparison with all the other things, the notebook was related to the whole 
palace by reason of its including all its theoretical laws, he was obliged to 
say: “ There, it is this notebook that has organized, ordered and adorned the 
palace, and has fashioned all these objects and set them in their places. ” He 
transformed his uncouthness into ludicrous jabber.

Thus, exactly like this comparison, a boor who subscribed to Naturalist 
thought,  which  denies  Allah,  entered  the  palace  of  the  universe,  which  is 
infinitely more well-ordered, more perfect and everywhere full of miracu-
lous instances of wisdom than the palace in the comparison. Not thinking 
that it was the work of art of the Necessarily Existent One, who is outside 
the sphere of contingency, and shunning that idea, he saw a collection of the 

TWENTY-THIRD FLASH

laws of divine practice and an index of dominical art, which are like a slate 
for writing and erasing of divine determining in the sphere of contingency, 
and like a constantly changing notebook for the laws of the functioning of 
divine power, and are extremely mistakenly and erroneously given the name 
‘nature,’ and he said:

“ These things require a cause and nothing else appears to have the rela-
tionship  with  everything  that  this  notebook  has.  It  is  true  that  reason  will 
in no way accept that this unseeing, unconscious and powerless notebook 
could carry out this creation, which is the work of an absolute dominicality 
and requires infinite power. But since I do not recognize the Eternal Maker, 
the most plausible explanation is to say the notebook made it, and makes it, 
so I shall say that. ” To which we reply:

You mistaken unfortunate! Your foolishness exceeds anything imagina-
ble! Lift your head out of the swamp of nature and look beyond yourself! 
See an All-Glorious Maker to whom all beings from particles to planets tes-
tify with their different tongues and to whom they point with their fingers! 
Behold the manifestation of the Pre-Eternal Inscriber, who fashions the pal-
ace and who writes its programme in the notebook! Study His decree, listen 
to the Qur’an! Be delivered from your delirious raving!

Second Comparison

S e c o n d   C o m p a r i s o n :  A rustic bumpkin entered the bounds of a splendid 
palace and saw there the uniform actions of an extremely well-disciplined 
army carrying out its drill. He observed a battalion, a regiment and a division 
stand to attention, stand at ease and march, and open fire when commanded 
as though they were a single private. Since his rude, uncultured mind could 
not comprehend, so denied, that a commander had been given command by 
the country’s laws and by royal decree, he imagined that the soldiers were 
attached to one another with strings. He thought of what wonderful string it 
must be, and was amazed.

Later, he continued on his way till he came upon a mosque as magnifi-
cent as Aya Sophia. He entered it at the time of Friday prayer and watched 
the congregation of Muslims rising, bowing, prostrating and sitting at the 
sound of man’s voice. Since he did not understand the Shari‘a, which con-
sists of a collection of immaterial, revealed laws, nor the immaterial rules 
proceeding from the Lawgiver’s command, he fancied the congregation to 
be bound to one another by physical string, and that this wonderful string 
had subjected them and was making them move like puppets. Coming up 
with this idea, which is so ridiculous as to make the most ignorant roar with 
laughter, he went on his way.

248

THE FLASHES

Exactly  like  this  comparison,  an  atheist  who  subscribed  to  materialist 
thought, which is denial and pure brutishness, entered the universe, which 
is a splendid barracks of the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity for 
His innumerable forces, and a well-ordered mosque of that Pre-Eternal All-
Worshipped One. He imagined the immaterial laws of the ordering of the 
universe, which proceed from the Pre-Eternal Monarch’s wisdom, each to 
have material and physical existence; and supposed the theoretical laws of 
the sovereignty of dominicality, and the rules and ordinances of the Greater 
Shari‘a,  the  Shari‘a  of  Creation,  which  are  immaterial  and  exist  only  as 
knowledge, each to have external, material and physical existence. But to 
set up in place of divine power those laws, which proceed from the divine 
attributes  of  knowledge  and  speech  and  only  exist  as  knowledge,  and  to 
attribute creation to them; then to attach the name ‘nature’ to them, and to 
deem force, which is merely a manifestation of dominical power, to be an 
independent  almighty  possessor  of  power,  is  a  thousand  times  more  low-
fallen ignorance than the ignorance in the comparison.

I n  

 S h o r t :  The  imaginary  and  insubstantial  thing  that  Naturalists  call 
nature, if it has an external reality, can at the very most be work of art; it 
cannot be the Artist. It is an embroidery, and cannot be the Embroiderer. It 
is a set of decrees; it cannot be the Issuer of the decrees. It is a body of the 
laws of creation, and cannot be the Lawgiver. It is but a created screen to 
the dignity of Allah, and cannot be the Creator.  It  is passive  and  created, 
and cannot be a Creative Maker. It is a law, not a power, and cannot possess 
power. It is a pattern and cannot be the source.

To  Conclude:  Since  beings  exist,  and  as  was  stated  at  the  beginning 
of  this  treatise,  reason  cannot  think  of  a  way  to  explain  the  existence  of 
beings apart from the four mentioned, three of which were decisively proved 
through three clear impossibilities to be invalid and absurd, then necessarily 
and self-evidently the way of divine unity, which is the fourth way, is proved 
in a conclusive manner. The fourth way, in accordance with the verse quoted 
at the beginning:

( 14:10 ) ª © ¨ § ¦ ¥
demonstrates clearly so that there can be no doubt or hesitation the Divinity 
of the Necessarily Existent One, and that all things issue directly from the 
hand of His power, and that the heavens and the earth are under His sway.

O you unfortunate worshipper of causes and nature! Since the nature of 
each thing, like all things, is created, for it is full of art and is being constantly 

TWENTY-THIRD FLASH

renewed, and, like the effect, the apparent cause of each thing is also created; 
and since for each thing to exist there is need for much equipment and many 
tools; there must exist a Possessor of Absolute Power who creates the nature 
and brings the cause into existence. And that Absolutely Powerful One is in 
no need of impotent intermediaries to share in His dominicality and creation. 
Allah forbid! He creates cause and effect together directly. In order to dem-
onstrate His wisdom and the manifestation of His names, by establishing an 
apparent causal relationship and connection through order and sequence, He 
makes causes and nature a veil to the hand of His power so that the apparent 
faults, severities and defects in things should be ascribed to them, and in this 
way His dignity be preserved.

Is  it  easier  for  a  watch-maker  to  make  the  cog-wheels  of  a  clock,  and 
then arrange them and put them in order to form the clock? Or is it easier 
for him to make a wonderful machine in each of the cog-wheels, and then 
leave the making of the clock to the lifeless hands of those machines? Is that 
not beyond the bounds of possibility? Come on, you judge with your unfair 
reason, and say! 

And is it easier for a scribe to collect ink, pen and paper, and then using 
them proceed to write out a book himself? Or is it easier for him to create in 
the paper, pen and ink a writing-machine that requires more art and trouble 
than the book, and can be used only for that book, and then tell the uncon-
scious machine: “ Come on, you write it! ”, and himself not interfere? Is that 
not a hundred times more difficult than writing it himself?

I f   y o u   s a y :  Yes, it is a hundred times more difficult to create a machine 
that writes a book rather than writing it out oneself. But is it not in a way 
easier, because the machine is a means of producing numerous copies of the 
same book?

The  Answer:  Through  His  limitless  power,  the  Pre-Eternal  Inscriber 
continuously renews the infinite manifestations of His names so as to dis-
play  them  in  ever-differing  ways.  And  through  this  constant  renewal,  He 
creates the identities and special features in things in such a manner that no 
missive of the Eternally Besought One or dominical book can be the same 
as any other book. In any case, each will have different features in order to 
express different meanings.

If you have eyes, look at the human face: you will see that from the time 
of Adam until today, indeed, until post-eternity, together with the conform-
ity of its essential organs, each face has a distinguishing mark in relation to 
all the others; this is a definite fact. Therefore, each face may be thought of 

250

THE FLASHES

as a different book. Only, for the artwork to be set out, different writing-sets, 
arrangements, and compositions are required. And in order to both collect 
and situate the materials, and to include everything necessary for the exist-
ence of each, a completely different workshop will be required.

Now, knowing it to be impossible, we thought of nature as a printing-
press. But apart from the composition and printing, which concern the print-
ing-press, that is, setting up the type in a specific order, the substances that 
form  an  animate  being’s  body,  the  creation  of  which  is  a  hundred  times 
more difficult than that of the composition and ordering, must be created in 
specific proportions and particular order, brought from the furthest corners 
of the cosmos, and placed in the hands of the printing-press. But in order to 
do all these things, there is still need for the power and will of the Absolutely 
Powerful One, who creates the printing-press. That is to say, this hypothesis 
of the printing-press is a totally meaningless superstition.

Thus, like the comparisons of the clock and the book, the All-Glorious 
Maker, who is powerful over all things, has created causes, and so too does 
He create the effects. Through His wisdom, He ties the effect to the cause. 
Through His will, He has determined a manifestation of the Greater Shari‘a, 
the  Shari‘a  of  Creation,  which  consists  of  the  divine  laws  concerning  the 
ordering of all motion in the universe, and determined the nature of beings, 
which is only to be a mirror to that manifestation in things, and to be a reflec-
tion  of  it.  And  through  His  power,  He  has  created  the  face  of  that  nature 
which has received external existence, and has created things on that nature, 
and has mixed them one with the other.

Is  it  easier  to  accept  this  fact,  which  is  the  conclusion  of  innumerable 
most rational proofs – in fact, is one not compelled to accept it? – or is it 
easier to get the physical beings that you call causes and nature, which are 
lifeless,  unconscious,  created,  fashioned  and  simple,  to  provide  the  num-
berless tools and equipment necessary for the existence of each thing and 
by themselves to carry out those matters, which are performed wisely and 
discerningly? Is that not utterly beyond the bounds of possibility? We leave 
it to you to decide, with your unreasonable mind!

The unbelieving nature-worshipper replied: “ Since you are asking me to 
be fair and reasonable, I have to confess that the mistaken way I have fol-
lowed up to now is both a compounded impossibility, and extremely harm-
ful  and  ugly.  Anyone  with  even  a  grain  of  intelligence  would  understand 
from your analyses above that to attribute the act of creation to causes and 
nature is precluded and impossible, and that to attribute all things directly

to  the  Necessarily  Existent  One  is  imperative  and  necessary.  I  say:  ‘ALL 
PRAISE BE TO GOD FOR BELIEF,’ and I believe in Him. Only, I do have 
one doubt:

“ I believe that Almighty Allah is the Creator, but what harm does it do 
to the sovereignty of His dominicality if some minor causes have a hand in 
the creation of insignificant matters and thereby gain for themselves a little 
praise and acclaim? Does it diminish His sovereignty in some way? ”

The  Answer:  As  we  have  conclusively  proved  in  other  parts  of  the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , the mark of rulership is its rejection of interference. The most 
insignficant  ruler  or  official  will  not  tolerate  the  interference  of  his  own 
son, even, within the sphere of his rule. The fact that, despite being Caliph, 
certain devout Sultans had their innocent sons murdered on the unfounded 
apprehension that the sons would interfere in their rule demonstrates how 
fundamental is this law of the rejection of interference in rulership. And the 
law of prevention of participation, which the independence intrinsic to ruler-
ship necessitates, has shown its strength in the history of mankind through 
extraordinary upheavals whenever there have been two governors in a town 
or two kings in a country.

If  the  sense  of  rulership  and  sovereignty,  which  is  a  mere  shadow  in 
human  beings,  who  are  impotent  and  in  need  of  assistance,  rejects  inter-
ference to this degree, prevents the intervention of others, does not accept 
participation in its sovereignty, and seeks to preserve the independence of 
its position so jealously, if you can, compare this with an All-Glorious One 
whose absolute sovereignty is at the degree of dominicality, whose absolute 
rulership at the degree of Divinity, absolute independence at the degree of 
oneness,  and  absolute  lack  of  need  at  the  degree  of  absolute  power,  and 
understand  what  a  necessary  requirement  and  inevitable  necessity  of  that 
rulership  is  this  rejection  of  interference,  prevention  of  participation,  and 
repulsion of partners.

C o n c e r n i n g   t h e   s e c o n d   p a r t   o f   y o u r   d o u b t ,   y o u   s a i d :  “ If some of the 
worship  of  some  insignificant  beings  is  directed  towards  certain  causes, 
does this cause any deficiency to the worship of all beings, from particles to 
planets, which is directed towards the Necessarily Existent One, the Abso-
lute Object of All Worship? ”

The Answer: The All-Wise Creator of the universe made the universe 
like a tree with conscious beings as its most perfect fruit, and among con-
scious beings He made man its most comprehensive fruit. And man’s most 
important  fruit,  indeed  the  result  of  his  creation,  the  aim  of  his  nature, 

252

THE FLASHES

and  the  fruit  of  his  life  are  his  thanks  and  worship.  Would  that  Absolute 
Sovereign and Independent Ruler, that Single One of Unity, who creates the 
universe  in  order  to  make  Himself  known  and  loved,  give  away  to  others 
man, the fruit of the whole universe, and man’s thanks and worship, his most 
elevated  fruit?  Totally  contrary  to  His  wisdom,  would  He  make  vain  and 
futile the result of creation and fruit of the universe? Allah forbid! Would 
He be content to give away the worship of creatures to others in a way that 
would deny His wisdom and His dominicality? And although He demon-
strates through His actions that He wishes to make Himself known and loved 
to an unlimited degree, would he cause His most perfect creatures to forget 
Him by handing over to causes their thanks and gratitude, love and worship, 
and cause them to deny the exalted purposes in the universe?

O friend who has given up the worship of nature! Now it is for you to say! 

To which he replied:

“ All praise be to Allah, these two doubts of mine have now been resolved. 
And  your  two  proofs  concerning  divine  unity  which  demonstrate  that  the 
only True Object of Worship is He, and that nothing other than He is worthy 
of worship are so brilliant and powerful that to deny them would require as 
much arrogance as to deny the sun and the daytime. ”

Conclusion
The person who gave up atheistic Naturalism and came to believe said: 
“ All praise be to Allah, I no longer have any doubts, but there are still a few 
questions about which I am curious. ”

First Question

FIRST QUESTION

“ We hear many lazy people and those who neglect the five daily prayers 
ask: ‘What need has Allah Almighty of our worship that in the Qur’an He 
severely and insistently reproves those who give up worship and threatens 
them with so a fearsome a punishment as Hell? How is it in keeping with 
the style of the Qur’an, which is moderate, mild and fair, to demonstrate the 
ultimate severity towards an insignificant, minor fault? ”

The Answer: Allah Almighty has no need of your worship, nor indeed of 
anything else. It is you who needs to worship, for in truth you are sick. As we 
have proved in many parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , worship is a sort of remedy 
for your spiritual wounds. You can understand how absurd it would be if an 
ill person responds to a kindly doctor who insists on his taking medicines 
that are beneficial for his condition by saying: “ What need do you have of it 
that you are insisting in this way? ”

TWENTY-THIRD FLASH

253

As for the severe threats and fearsome punishments in the Qur’an con-
cerning the giving up of worship, they may be likened to a king who in order 
to protect his subjects’ rights, inflicts a severe punishment on an ordinary 
man in accordance with the degree that his crime infringes those rights.

In  the  same  way,  the  man  who  gives  up  worship  and  ritual  prayer  is 
violating in a significant manner the rights of beings, who are like the sub-
jects of the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, and is in fact acting 
unjustly towards them. For the perfections of beings are manifested through 
the  glorification  and  worship  performed  by  that  aspect  of  them  which  is 
directed towards their Maker. The one who abandons worship does not and 
cannot see this worship. Indeed, he denies it. Furthermore, beings occupy 
an exalted position by reason of their worship and glorification, and each 
is a missive of the Eternally Besought One, and a mirror to its Sustainer’s 
names. Since he reduces them from their high positions and considers them 
to be unimportant, lifeless, aimless, and without duties, he is insulting them, 
and denying and transgressing their perfections.

Indeed, everyone sees the world in his own mirror. Allah Almighty cre-
ated man as a measure and scale for the universe. And from the world He 
gave a particular world to each person. This world He colours for him in 
accordance with his sincere beliefs. For example, a despairing, lamenting, 
weeping  person  sees  beings  as  weeping  and  in  despair,  while  a  cheerful, 
optimistic, merry person sees the universe as joyful and smiling. A reflec-
tive man given to solemn worship and glorification discovers and sees to a 
degree the certain, truly existent worship and glorification of beings, while 
a person who abandons worship through either neglect or denial sees beings 
in a manner totally contrary and opposed to the reality of their perfections 
and so in effect transgresses their rights.

Furthermore, since the person who gives up prayer does not own him-
self, he wrongs his own soul, which is a slave of its True Owner. His Owner 
delivers awesome threats in order to protect His slave’s rights from his evil-
commanding soul. Also, since he has given up worship, which is the result 
of his creation and the aim of his nature, it is like an act of aggression against 
divine wisdom and dominical will, and he therefore receives punishment.

I n    S h o r t :  The  abandoner  of  worship  both  wrongs  his  own  soul,  which 
is the slave and totally owned property of Almighty Allah, and wrongs and 
transgresses the rights of the perfections of the universe. Certainly, just as 
unbelief is an insult to beings, so is the abandonment of worship a denial of 
the universe’s perfections. And since it is an act of aggression against divine 
wisdom, it is deserving of awesome threats and severe punishment.

Thus,  it  is  to  express  this  deservedness  and  the  above  facts  that  the 
Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition chooses in a miraculous way that severe 
style, which, in complete conformity with the principles of eloquence, cor-
responds to the requirements of the situation.

Second Question

SECOND QUESTION

The person who had given up Naturalism and come to believe next asked:
“ It is indeed a vast truth that each being is dependent on divine will and 
dominical power in every aspect; in all of its functions, qualities and actions. 
Our  narrow  minds  cannot  comprehend  this  because  of  its  vastness.  How-
ever, the infinite abundance that we see around us, and the boundless ease 
in the creation and formation of things, and the infinite ease and facility in 
the way of unity, which was established through your proofs above, and the 
infinite ease that verses of the Qur’an like the following clearly demonstrate 
and expound,

( 31:28 ) â á à ß Þ Ý Ü

and,

( 16:77 ) « ª © ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ £ 
show this mighty truth to be a matter that is most acceptable and rational. 
What is the wisdom and secret of this ease? ”

The Answer: This matter was elucidated in a most clear, decisive and 
ِلﯭﯦ ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) َوُ(cid:182)َو  which 
convincing  fashion  in  the  explanation  of  ٌر(cid:192) ِدَ(cid:162)  ٍء ْىَ(cid:130)  ّ
forms the Tenth Phrase of the Twentieth Letter. And it was demonstrated 
even  more  clearly  in  the  Addendum  to  that  letter  that  when  attributed  to 
the Single Maker, all beings become as easy as a single being. If they are 
not attributed to that Single One of Unity, the creation of a single creature 
becomes as difficult as that of all beings, and a seed as problematical as a 
tree. When they are ascribed to their True Maker, the universe becomes as 
easy and trouble-free as a tree, a tree as easy as a seed, Paradise as easy as 
the spring, and the spring as easy as a flower. We shall now point out briefly 
one  or  two  evidences  that  have  been  explained  in  detail  in  other  parts  of 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  out of the hundreds which explain the underlying reasons 
for and instances of wisdom in the conspicuous, boundless abundance and 
profusion  of  beings,  the  ease  of  the  great  number  of  individuals  in  each 
species, and the fact that well-ordered, artistically fashioned and valuable 
beings come into existence with immense speed and ease.

TWENTY-THIRD FLASH

255

For example, if the command of a hundred soldiers is given to one officer, 
it is a hundred times easier than if the command of one soldier is given to a 
hundred officers. And if to equip an army it is assigned to one headquarters, 
one law, one factory and the command of one king, it quite simply becomes 
as easy as equipping a single soldier. In the same way, if to equip one soldier 
it is referred to numerous headquarters, numerous factories and numerous 
commanders, it becomes as difficult as equipping an army. Because in order 
to equip a single soldier, it would require as many factories as are necessary 
for a whole army.

Again, since by reason of the mystery of unity, the vital necessities of a 
tree are provided through one root, one centre and according to one law, it 
produces thousands of fruits as easily as a single fruit. This is plain to see. 
If unity changes to multiplicity and all the necessities vital for each fruit are 
provided from different places, to produce each fruit becomes as difficult as 
to produce the tree. And to produce a single seed, even, which is a sample 
and index of the tree, becomes as difficult as the tree. Because all the neces-
sities vital for the tree’s life are necessary for the seed.

There are hundreds of examples like these which show that it is easier for 
thousands of beings to come into existence through unity than for a single 
being to come into existence through multiplicity and ascribing partners to 
Allah. Since this truth has been proved with absolute certainty in other parts 
of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , we refer you to them and here only explain an important 
reason for this ease and facility from the point of view of divine knowledge, 
divine determining, and dominical power. It is as follows:

You are a being. If you attribute yourself to the Pre-Eternal All-Powerful 
One, He creates you at a command through His infinite power out of nothing 
in an instant, like striking a match. If you do not do this and rather attribute 
yourself to physical causes and nature, since you are a well-ordered sum-
mary, fruit, and miniature index and list of the universe, in order to make 
you, it would be necessary to sift with a fine sieve the universe and its ele-
ments, and to gather in precise measure from all the corners of the universe 
the substances of which your body is composed. For physical causes only 
gather and join together. It is confirmed by people of reason that they can-
not create out of nothing what is not present in them. Since this is the case, 
they would be compelled to collect together the body of a tiny animate being 
from every corner of the cosmos. 

Now understand what ease there is in unity, divine unity, and what dif-

ficulties lie in misguidance and attributing partners to Allah!

256

THE FLASHES

Secondly,  there  is  an  infinite  ease  also  with  regard  to  divine  knowl-
edge. It is like this: divine determining is an aspect of divine knowledge; 
it  determines  a  measure  for  each  thing,  which  is  like  its  particular  and 
immaterial mould; the determined measure is like a plan or model for the 
thing’s  being.  When  divine  power  creates,  it  does  so  with  extreme  ease 
in accordance with the determined measure. If the thing is not attributed 
to the All-Powerful One of Glory, who possesses all-embracing, infinite 
and pre-eternal knowledge, as was described above, not only thousands of 
difficulties appear, but hundreds of impossibilities. For if it were not for 
the determined measure which exists in divine knowledge, thousands of 
material moulds with external existences would have to be employed in 
the body of even a tiny animate being.

So, understand one reason for the infinite ease in unity and the endless 
difficulties in misguidance and ascribing partners to Allah. Realize what a 
veracious, correct, and exalted truth is stated by the verse,

Third Question

THIRD QUESTION

The former enemy and now rightly-guided friend then asked: “ Philoso-
phers, who have made many advances these days, claim that nothing is cre-
ated out of nothing, and nothing is annihilated and goes to nothing; there 
is only composition and decomposition, and this makes the factory of the 
universe run. Is this correct? ”

The Answer: Since the most advanced philosophers who did not con-
sider beings in the light of the Qur’an saw that the formation and existence 
of beings by means of nature and causes was so difficult as to be impossible 
– in the manner proved above, they diverged into two groups. 

One  group  became  Sophists;  abdicating  reason,  which  is  exclusive  to 
human beings, and falling lower than mindless beasts, they found it easier 
to deny the universe’s existence and even their own existences, than to fol-
low the way of misguidance, which claims that causes and nature have the 
power to create. They therefore denied both themselves and the universe and 
descended into absolute ignorance.

The second group saw that in misguidance, according to which causes 
and nature are creator, the creation of a fly or a seed, even, entails innumer-
able  difficulties  and  requires  a  power  unacceptable  to  reason.  They  were 
therefore  compelled  to  deny  the  act  of  creation  and  to  say:  “ Nothing  can 

TWENTY-THIRD FLASH

257

exist out of nothing. ” Seeing total annihiliation also to be impossible, they 
declared: “ What exists cannot go to nothing. ” They fancied an imaginary 
situation  in  which  combining  and  decomposition,  gathering  together  and 
dispersion, occur through the motion of particles and the winds of chance.

Now, see! Those who consider themselves to be the most intelligent are 
the  most  profoundly  ignorant  and  stupid.  Understand  just  how  ludicrous, 
debased, and ignorant misguidance makes man, and take a lesson!

Indeed, a Pre-Eternal Power created the heavens and the earth in six days, 
every year creates four hundred thousand species simultaneously on the face 
of the earth, and in six weeks every spring constructs a living world more 
full  of  art  and  wisdom  than  the  world  itself.  Thus,  it  is  more  foolish  and 
ignorant than the Sophists, the first group above, to deny the act of creation 
and deem it unlikely that, like a chemical that when applied shows up invis-
ible  writing,  Pre-Eternal  Power  should  give  external  existence  to  beings, 
which, though externally non-existent, exist as knowledge, and whose plans 
and measures are determined in the realm of a Pre-Eternal Knowledge.

Those unfortunates are absolutely impotent and have nothing at their dis-
posal apart from the faculty of will. Although they are inflated like Phar-
aohs, they can neither annihilate anything nor create anything from nothing, 
even a minute particle. And so, although nothing comes into existence out 
of nothing at the hand of causes and nature on which they rely, out of their 
stupidity  they  say:  “ Nothing  comes  from  non-being,  and  nothing  goes  to 
non-being. ” And they even extend this absurd and erroneous principle to the 
Absolutely All-Powerful One.

Indeed, the All-Powerful One of Glory has two ways of creating: 
The First is through origination and invention. That is, He brings a being 
into  existence  out  of  nothing,  out  of  non-existence,  and  creates  everything 
necessary for it, also out of nothing, and places those necessities in its hand.

The Second is through composition, through art. That is, He forms cer-
tain beings out of the elements of the universe in order to demonstrate subtle 
instances of wisdom, such as displaying the perfections of His wisdom and 
the manifestations of many of His names. Through the law of providing, he 
sends particles and matter, which are dependent on His command, to these 
beings and employs the particles in them.

Yes, the Absolutely All-Powerful One creates in two ways: He both origi-
nates and He composes. To annihilate what exists and to make exist what 
does not exist is most simple and easy for Him. It is one of His constant and

universal laws. The man, therefore, who says: “ He cannot give existence to 
what does not exist ” in the face of a power that in one spring makes exist 
out of nothing the forms and attributes of three hundred thousand animate 
creatures, and, besides their particles, all their conditions and states, such a 
man should himself be obliterated!

The person who gave up nature and embraced the truth said: “ Praise and 
thanks  be  to  Allah  Almighty  to  the  number  of  particles  in  existence  for  I 
have attained to complete belief. I have been saved from delusion and mis-
guidance. Not one of my doubts remains.

This verse enjoins the veiling of women. However, dissolute civilization 
opposes  this  command  of  the  Qur’an;  it  does  not  consider  the  veiling  of 
women to be natural and says it is slavery of a sort. 1

The Answer: We shall explain only four of the many instances of wis-
dom in this injunction of the Qur’an, showing that it is entirely natural and 
those who oppose it are opposing the innate disposition of women.

FIRST INSTANCE OF WISDOM

To  veil  themselves  is  natural  for  women  and  their  innate  dispositions 
demand it. For women are weak and delicate, and since they are in need of a 
man’s protection and help for themselves and for their children whom they 
love  more  than  their  own  lives,  they  have  a  natural  desire  to  make  them-
selves loved and not loathed, and not to be rebuffed.

1.  Part of my defence for the Appeal Court, which opposed the [ Eskişehir ] Court 
and silenced it: “ I say to this court of law that if there is justice on the face of the earth, 
it will surely quash the decision to convict a person who has expounded a most sacred, 
true, and right divine principle which has been in force in the social life of three hundred 
and fifty million people every century for one thousand three hundred and fifty years, 
relying on the confirmation and unanimity of three hundred and fifty thousand Qur’anic 
commentaries and following the beliefs of our forefathers for one thousand three hun-
dred and fifty years; it will surely quash such a ruling! ”

THE FLASHES

Also, seven out of ten women are either old or ugly and they do not want 
to show their age or unsightliness to everyone. Or they are jealous, and they 
do not want to appear ugly in relation to others who are more beautiful. Or 
they  are  frightened  of  assault  or  aspersions,  and  want  by  nature  to  cover 
themselves so as not to suffer assault, nor to be accused of unfaithfulness 
by their husbands. If noted carefully, it is seen that it is the elderly who hide 
themselves most. While only two or three out of ten women are both young 
and beautiful and do not feel uncomfortable at displaying themselves.

It is clear that people are discomforted at being looked at by people they 
do not like or find tedious; they are upset by it. If a beautiful immodestly 
dressed woman takes pleasure at two or three out of ten men who are canoni-
cally strangers looking at her, she is bored by the seven or eight. Also, since 
a woman with uncorrupted morals is sensitive and easily affected, she will 
certainly  be  distressed  at  dirty  looks  whose  effects  have  been  physically 
experienced, indeed, are poisonous. We even hear that in Europe, the place 
of open dress, many women are fed up at being the object of attention, and 
complain  to  the  police,  saying:  “ These  brutes  keep  staring  at  us  and  dis-
turbing us. ” This means that present-day civilization’s unveiling women is 
contrary to their natures, while the Qur’an’s command to veil themselves is 
both in conformity with women’s natures, and saves them – those mines of 
compassion who may be worthy companions for all eternity – from degen-
eration, degradation, what is in effect slavery and wretchedness.

Furthermore, by nature women are fearful of men who are strangers, 
and  are  anxious  at  them.  Fear  naturally  demands  the  veiling  of  women. 
For in addition to suffering the difficulty of bearing the load of a child for 
eight or nine months, which certainly embitters the eight or nine minutes’ 
pleasure, there is the possibility of suffering the calamity of bringing up 
a child for eight or nine years without protector. Since this happens fre-
quently, by creation they truly fear strange men and by nature want to hide 
themselves from them. Being weak, their creation demands that through 
veiling  themselves  they  do  not  excite  the  appetites  of  men  outside  the 
stipulated degrees of kinship, nor allow any opportunity for assault; their 
weak creation gives powerful warning. It shows that their cloaks and coats 
are shields and fortresses. The fact that, according to news received, the 
bare-legged wife of a high-ranking man in the world was accosted in the 
country’s capital, in the marketplace in daylight in front of everyone by a 
common shoe-shiner, deals a slap in the shameless faces of those opposed 
to the veiling of women!

SECOND INSTANCE OF WISDOM

The geniune, intense relationship, love, and affection between men and 
women do not arise only from the needs of worldly life. Yes, a woman is a 
companion to her husband not only in this worldly life, she is his companion 
in eternal life too. Since she will be her husband’s companion in eternal life, 
she  surely  should  not  attract  the  looks  of  others  besides  her  husband,  her 
everlasting friend and companion, and should not offend him and make him 
jealous.  In  consequence  of  the  mystery  of  belief,  her  believing  husband’s 
relations with her are not confined to this worldly life and his love is not only 
animal and temporary, so long as her beauty lasts; he holds true, earnest love 
and respect for her because she will be his companion in eternal life. And 
he bears that love and respect for her, not only during her youth when she is 
beautiful, but also when she is old and unsightly. Certainly in return for this, 
she should show her beauties to him alone and restrict her love to him; this is 
demanded by humanity. Otherwise she would gain very little and lose much.
According to the Shari‘a, the husband should be a good match for the 
wife. That is, they should be suitable to one another. The most important 
aspect of this is with a view to religion.

Happy the husband who sees the wife’s firm religion and follows her, 
and himself becomes pious in order not to lose his companion of eternal life.
Happy the wife who sees her husband’s firmness in religion and becomes 

pious so as not to lose her eternal friend.

Alas for the man who becomes dissolute, which will lose him for ever 

that righteous woman.

eternal blessed friend.

Alas for the woman who does not follow her pious husband and loses her 

And a thousand woes on the unhappy husband and wife who imitate each 

other in sin and vice, helping one another to enter Hell-fire!

THIRD INSTANCE OF WISDOM

Happy  family  life  is  perpetuated  through  mutual  confidence  between 
husband and wife, and heartfelt respect and love. Immodest dress and free-
and-easy behaviour destroy the confidence and spoil the mutual respect and 
love. For out of ten women who favour immodest dress only one will not try 
to make herself liked by strangers because she does not find other men more 
attractive than her husband. Nine will find others better than their husbands. 
And only one out of twenty men will not find other women more attractive.

THE FLASHES

Then besides the true love and mutual respect disappearing, it may arouse 
extremely ugly and base feelings, as follows:

By nature, men do not feel any lust towards those within the stipulated 
degrees  of  kinship  like  their  sisters,  because,  since  such  relatives’  faces 
induce  kindness  and  licit  love  due  to  their  close  kinship,  it  nullifies  any 
sexual or lusty inclinations. But to leave uncovered parts of the body which 
according to the Shari‘a it is not permissible to expose to close relatives like 
the legs, may awaken extremely ugly feelings in men of low character. For 
the face of a close relative reminds the man of their close kinship and does 
not resemble the face of someone outside the degrees of kinship, but a bare 
leg  is  the  same  as  that  of  canonical  strangers.  The  leg  does  not  bear  any 
distinguishing mark to recall the close kinship of its owner, so may arouse 
carnal  feelings  in  the  man.  To  look  on  such  things  is  so  degenerate  as  to 
make one’s hair stand on end.

FOURTH INSTANCE OF WISDOM

It  is  clear  that  everyone  wants  lots  of  children.  There  is  no  nation  or 
government  that  does  not  support  an  increase  in  population.  In  fact, 
Allah’s Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) said: 
َمَ(cid:174)ُ
ّ(cid:178)ِاَ(cid:158) اوُرَ(cid:102)اﯬﯧَ(cid:98) اوُ(cid:111)ﯬﯦاَ(cid:179)َ(cid:98)  1  However,  the  abandoning  of 
Islamic dress for women does not increase marriage, it decreases it signifi-
cantly. For even the most lay-about and modern youth wants his wife to be 
chaste. He does not want her to be modern, that is, careless in questions of 
dress  and  morals  like  himself,  and  so  remains  single,  and  even  frequents 
prostitutes.

Women  are  not  like  that,  they  cannot  restrict  their  husbands’  behav-
iour  to  the  same  extent.  Women’s  most  basic  characteristics  are  loyalty 
and trustworthiness, since being the director of all the matters to do with 
the home, the woman is charged with protecting and preserving her hus-
band’s property and possessions, and his children. Carelessness in dress 
and morality destroys that loyalty, and her husband loses confidence in her 
and makes her suffer pangs of conscience. In fact, if the two qualities of 
courage and generosity, which are desirable in men, are found in women, 
it damages this loyalty and confidence and so are undesirable for women 
and are considered to be bad qualities. But since the husband’s duty is not

loyalty and stewardship, but protection, kindness, and respect, he cannot 
be restricted and refined, and may marry other women as well.

Our country cannot be compared with Europe, because there honour may 
be preserved to a degree by violent means such as the duel, despite immod-
est dress. The person who makes eyes at the wife of a self-respecting man 
takes his life in his hands, and then looks. Also the people of Europe are cold 
and frigid, like the climate. Asia, that is, the lands of Islam, are relatively tor-
rid. It is well-known that the environment has an effect on people’s morality. 
Perhaps in those cold countries immodest dress does not stimulate the ani-
mal appetites and carnal desires of those cold people, and lead to abuse. But 
the carnal lusts of the easily influenced and sensitive people of hot countries 
are continually excited by immodest dress, which is thus the cause of much 
abuse and waste and the weakening of the young generation, and the loss 
of strength. Instead of answering natural needs once a month or every three 
weeks or so, a person considers it necessary every few days. And then, since 
he is obliged to avoid his wife for perhaps two weeks out of every month due 
to contingencies like her monthly period, if he is defeated by his appetites, 
he will incline to houses of ill-fame.

The veiling of women may not be abolished on the pretext of the women 
of small towns and villages and nomad women, for innocent working-women 
and somewhat coarse women being partially unveiled does not excite carnal 
desires since it is due to their working to secure their livelihoods and their 
physical, wearying labour. Moreover, since idle, lay-about men are few, and 
not  even  one  in  ten  of  the  immoral  men  of  the  large  towns  can  be  found 
among them. Such a comparison should not therefore be made.

A Conversation with the Women,
My Believing Sisters of the Hereafter 
At the time I returned to blessed Isparta, which bears the meaning of the 
M e d r e s e t ü ’ z - Z e h r a ,  1 for the third time, I had seen the sincere and enthu-
siastic  interest  shown  by  women  towards  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   in  some  other 
provinces,  and  had  realized  that  in  a  way  far  exceeding  my  due  they  had 
confidence in my instruction in it. I heard then that the women in Isparta, 
my blessed sisters of the hereafter, were waiting to receive instruction from 
me, as though I were going to instruct them in mosques in the manner of 
preaching. I was ill with five or so different illnesses, in a wretched state, 
lacking  the  strength  to  speak  and  think,  yet  that  night  the  following  was 
imparted to my heart, impellingly: “ Fifteen years ago you wrote A   G u i d e   f o r  
Yo u t h  at the request of some youths and it was a source of benefit for many. 
Women, however, are in even greater need of a guide at this time. ” Despite 
my extreme weakness, wretchedness, and powerlessness, in the face of this 
warning I wrote very concisely in three points a number of necessary mat-
ters which I now explain to my blessed sisters and young spiritual offspring.

First Point

FIRST POINT

Since one of the fundamental principles of the R i s a l e - i  N u r  is compassion 
and women are champions of compassion, they are by nature more closely 
connected with the R i s a l e - i   N u r  than others. Praise be to Allah, this natural 
sympathy is felt in many places. The self-sacrifice within such compassion 
seeks nothing in return and expresses true sincerity, and so is of the greatest 
importance at this time. 

Yes, the fact that wanting nothing in return, a mother will sacrifice her 
life to save her young from danger, as demanded by her nature and with true 
sincerity, shows that women are capable of great heroism. By developing 
this heroism, they may save their lives both in this world and in the hereaf-
ter. However, this important attribute does not unfold under the influence of 
certain bad currents of thought, or else it is exploited. A small example out 
of hundreds is as follows:

1.  For the Medresetü’z-Zehra, See note 35, page 325.

264

TWENTY-FOURTH FLASH

265

A compassionate mother undertakes every sort of self-sacrifice so that 
her child should not fall into danger in this worldly life and should receive 
every sort of benefit and advantage; she brings him up with this in view. 
Thinking, “ My son is going to be a Pasha, ” she gives him all her property, 
takes him from the Qur’an school and sends him to Europe. But it does not 
occur to her that her child’s eternal life has fallen into danger. She tries to 
save him from prison in this world and does not take into consideration his 
being  sentenced  to  the  prison  of  Hell.  Reversing  that  innate  compassion, 
she makes her innocent child a claimant against her in the hereafter, though 
he should be her intercessor. He will rebuke her saying: “ Why did you not 
strengthen my belief and so cause me to be lost? ” In this world too, since 
he  did  not  receive  a  proper  Islamic  upbringing,  he  cannot  respond  to  his 
mother’s wondrous compassion in the way it deserves; in fact he does so 
very deficiently.

If  she  does  not  misdirect  her  true  compassion  and  works  to  save  her 
unhappy child from everlasting incarceration in Hell and from dying while 
in  misguidance,  which  will  result  in  eternal  extinction,  the  equivalent  of 
each of the child’s good works will pass to the mother’s book of good deeds. 
And after her death he will continuously send lights to her spirit with his 
good works, and in the hereafter, will be not a claimant but with all his spirit 
and life an intercessor for her, and a blessed child of her’s for all eternity.

Yes, man’s first master and most influential teacher is his mother. In con-
nection with this, I shall explain the following to you, which I have always 
felt strongly in my own self:

I  am  eighty  years  old  and  have  received  lessons  from  eighty  thousand 
people.  Yet  I  swear  that  the  truest  and  most  unshakeable  lessons  I  have 
received are those inculcated in me by my late mother, which have always 
remained fresh for me. They have been planted in my nature as though they 
were seeds planted in my physical being. I observe that other instruction has 
been constructed on those seeds. That is to say, the lessons instilled in my 
nature and spirit by my mother when I was one year old I now see at the age 
of eighty to be fundamental seeds amid great truths.

For  instance,  I  consider  it  certain  that  I  learnt  from  the  compassionate 
behaviour and acts of my mother and from her teaching, to be compassion-
ate, which is the most important of the four principles of my way, and to be 
kind and clement, which is the greatest truth of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r . Yes, the 
compassion of motherhood comprises true sincerity and true self-sacrifice, 
but it is a misuse of it to not think of the hereafter – a treasury of diamonds 

266

THE FLASHES

for her innocent child – and to turn his face towards this world, which resem-
bles temporary, transient fragments of glass, and to be kind to him in that 
way, is to misuse that compassion.

A proof of this heroism of women in respect of compassion, which wants 
absolutely no recompense and nothing in return, and of their sacrificing their 
very spirits, which in no way seeks personal benefit and no show, is that a 
hen, which bears a tiny sample of that compassion, will attack a lion and 
sacrifice its life for its chicks.

Now, sincerity is the most valuable and most essential principle in Islamic 
training and in deeds pertaining to the hereafter. True sincerity is present in 
the heroism of this kind of compassion. If these two points begin to develop 
among women, it will lead to considerable happiness within the domain of 
Islam. When it comes to the heroism of men, it can never be for nothing; 
they always want recompense in perhaps a hundred ways. At the very least 
they  want  glory  and  renown.  But  regretably,  unfortunate  women  practise 
hypocrisy in another form in order to be saved from the evil and oppression 
of tyrannical men; this sort arises from weakness and impotence.

Second Point

SECOND POINT

This year, although I had withdrawn from the life of society and was in 
seclusion, I looked at the world for the sake of some of my brothers and 
sisters who were  R i s a l e - i   N u r  students. I heard from most of the friends 
who visited me complaints about their family lives. “ Alas! ”, I said, “ Fam-
ily life is the refuge of people, and particularly of Muslims, and a sort of 
Paradise, and a small world. Has this now started to break up as well? ” 
I sought the reason and I understood that one or two covert groups were 
working to mislead the youth and drive the young to vice by exciting their 
appetites, so as to cause harm to Islamic social life and thereby to the reli-
gion of Islam. I also realized that one or two groups were working covertly 
and effectively to drive neglectful women down the wrong road. I under-
stood too that a severe blow would be dealt to this Muslim nation from that 
quarter. I therefore categorically state the following to you my sisters and 
spiritual children:

The sole means of saving women’s happiness in the hereafter, and their 
happiness in this world, as well as saving their elevated innate qualities from 
corruption, is the training given by the religion of Islam; there is no other 
means. You hear about the situation into which the unfortunate women of 
Russia have fallen. It says in one part of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  that no sensible 

TWENTY-FOURTH FLASH

267

man builds love and affection for his wife on her fleeting, superficial beauty 
of five to ten years; he should build it on her fine conduct, the most perma-
nent and best of beauty, which is particular to womanhood and its compas-
sion. Then, when the unfortunate advances in years, her husband’s love for 
her will persist. For his wife is not merely a temporary helper and compan-
ion in this worldly life, but an eternal, lovable companion in everlasting life, 
so the older they grow their love for each other should also grow, and their 
compassion and respect. Under the guise of culture and civilization, family 
life is now is a temporary animal relationship followed by eternal separation, 
and is being destroyed at its very foundations.

In  another  place  in  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   it  says:  “ Happy  the  man  who  in 
order not to lose his companion of eternity, copies his righteous wife and so 
becomes righteous himself. And happy the woman who, seeing her husband 
to be pious, adheres to religion herself so as not to lose her everlasting friend 
and companion. Unhappy the man who follows his wife in sin, does not try 
to make her give it up, but joins her. And unhappy the woman who, seeing 
her husband’s sinfulness, follows him in another way. And alas for the wife 
and  husband  who  assist  one  another  in  throwing  each  other  into  the  Fire. 
That is, who encourage one another to embrace the evils of civilization. ”

These  lines  have  the  following  meaning:  at  this  time,  Islamic  conduct 
within  the  bounds  of  the  Shari‘a  is  the  only  means  of  developing  family 
life and finding happiness in this world and the hereafter, and causing the 
elevated qualities of women to unfold. Now, the most important matter in 
family life is this, that if the woman sees bad conduct and disloyalty in her 
husband and to spite him, stints in her loyalty and faithfulness to him, which 
is her duty as far as the family is concerned, then the factory of that family 
life will be thrown into confusion, exactly like discipline in the army being 
spoilt. The woman should try to reform her husband’s faults as far as she 
can in order to save her companion of eternity. It is harmful in every respect 
if she starts to show herself to others by unveiling herself and tries to make 
herself attractive to others. For a woman who gives up complete loyalty pays 
the penalty in this world too. Because it is her nature to be fearful and upset 
at the looks of those canonically strangers to her, and to avoid them. She is 
discomforted at the looks of eighteen out of twenty strangers. As for men, 
they are discomforted and upset at the looks of only one out of a hundred 
women who are canonically strangers to them. The woman suffers torment 
in that respect, and so too may be accused of disloyalty, and due to her weak-
ness, will be unable to defend her rights.

268

THE FLASHES

I n    S h o r t : Just as in respect of compassion women do not resemble men 
in heroism and sincerity, and men cannot compare with them in that regard; 
so too innocent women can in no way compare with men in vice. For this 
reason by their natures and weakness, they are truly frightened of strangers 
and feel themselves compelled to conceal themselves beneath their abundant 
outer  garments.  For  if  for  eight  minutes’  pleasure  a  man  commits  sin,  he 
only suffers a loss of eight l i r a s . But as the penalty of the pleasure of eight 
minutes’ sin, in this world the woman bears a heavy load for eight months 
and then has the hardship of rearing the unprotected child for eight years. 
She therefore cannot compete with men in vice and pays a penalty a hundred 
times greater.

The not infrequent incidents of this sort show that just as by nature women 
are the source of elevated morals, so do they virtually lack the capacity for 
worldly pleasure in vice and dissipation. That is to say, they are a type of 
blessed creature created to pass happy lives in the family within the bounds 
laid  down  by  Islam.  Allah  damn  those  covert  groups  who  are  corrupting 
these blessed creatures! And may Almighty Allah preserve my sisters from 
the evil of such dissolute wretches.

My sisters! I have this to say to you confidentially: rather than entering 
under the domination of a dissolute, immoral, Westernized husband due to 
straitened circumstances, try to economize and obtain your own livelihood 
like innocent peasant women with the frugality and contentment which is in 
your natures; do not try to sell yourselves. If it is your fate to have a husband 
who is unsuitable for you, be content with your fate and resigned to it. Allah 
willing, he will be reformed through your contentment and resignation. But 
to apply to the courts for a divorce, which I have heard of recently; that is not 
in keeping with the honour of Islam and this nation’s good name!

Third Point

THIRD POINT

My dear sisters, you should be certain that as is demonstrated with power-
ful proofs and examples in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , present in pleasures and enjoy-
ment outside the bounds of the licit are pains and distress ten times greater. 
You may find detailed expositions of this in the R i s a l e - i   N u r . For instance, 
the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Words from T h e   S h o r t   Wo r d s  and A   G u i d e   f o r  
Yo u t h  will elucidate this truth for you completely in place of me. In which 
case, make do with licit pleasures and be content with them. Innocent con-
versation with your innocent children in your home is more pleasurable than 
a hundred cinemas.

269

You should also know certainly that true pleasure in the life of this world 
lies in belief and the sphere of faith. There is an immaterial pleasure to be 
found in all good works. The R i s a l e - i   N u r has proved with hundreds of deci-
sive evidences that even in this world most bitter and grievous suffering is 
present in vice and misguidance. I myself have experienced on numerous 
occasions as certainly as seeing it with my own eyes, that a seed of Paradise 
is contained in belief, while a seed of Hell is found in vice and misguidance. 
This truth is repeated many times in the R i s a l e - i   N u r . Although the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  has come into the hands of those who oppose it most obstinately and 
severely, they have been unable to refute this truth; neither have the com-
mittees of experts and the courts been able to refute it. Now, my blessed and 
innocent sisters and your children who are like my spiritual children, fore-
most the Tr e a t i s e   o n   I s l a m i c   D r e s s , and A   G u i d e   f o r   Yo u t h , and T h e   S h o r t  
Wo r d s  should teach you in my place.

I  have  heard  that  you  want  me  to  teach  you  in  the  mosque,  but  my 
wretched state and my illness and many other circumstances do not permit

Message for the Sick

[ This treatise consists of twenty-five remedies. It was written as a salve, 
a solace, and a prescription for the sick, and in order to visit them and 
wish them a speedy recovery. ]

Warning and Apology

This immaterial prescription was written with a speed greater than all 
my other writings, 1 and since time could not be found to correct and 
study it, unlike all the others it was read only once, and that at great 
speed like its composition. That is to say, it has remained in the dis-
ordered state of a first draft. I did not consider it necessary to go over 
carefully  the  things  which  had  occurred  to  me  in  a  natural  manner, 
lest they be spoilt by arranging them and paying them undue attention. 
Readers and especially the sick should not feel upset and offended at 
any  disagreeable  expressions  or  harsh  words  and  phrases;  let  them 
rather pray for me.

TWENTY-FIFTH FLASH

271

FIRST REMEDY

Unhappy  sick  person!  Do  not  be  anxious,  have  patience!  Your  illness 
is not a malady for you; it is a sort of cure. For life departs like capital; if 
it yields no fruits, it is wasted; and if it passes in ease and heedlessness, it 
passes swiftly. Illness makes that capital of yours yield huge profits. Moreo-
ver, it does not allow your life to pass quickly, it restrains it and lengthens 
it, so that it will depart after yielding its fruits. An indication that your life 
is lengthened through illness is the following much repeated proverb: “ The 
times of calamity are long, the times of happiness, most brief. ”

SECOND REMEDY

O ill person who lacks patience! Be patient, indeed, offer thanks! Your 
illness may transform each of the minutes of your life into the equivalent 
of an hour’s worship. For worship is of two kinds. One is positive like the 
well-known worship of supplication and the five daily prayers. The other are 
negative forms of worship like illness and calamities. By means of these, those 
afflicted realize their impotence and weakness; they beseech their All-Com-
passionate Creator and take refuge in Him; they manifest worship which is 
sincere and without hypocrisy. Yes, there is a sound narration stating that a 
life passed in illness is counted as worship for the believer – on condition 
he does not complain about Allah.  1 It is even established by sound narra-
tions and by those who uncover the realities of creation that one minute’s 
illness of some people who are completely patient and thankful becomes the 
equivalent of an hour’s worship and a minute’s illness of certain perfected 
men the equivalent of a day’s worship. So you should not complain about an 
illness which as though transforms one minute of your life into a thousand 
minutes and gains for you long life; you should offer thanks.

THIRD REMEDY

Impatient sick person! The fact that those who come to this world contin-
uously depart, and the young grow old, and man perpetually revolves amid 
death  and  separation  testifies  that  he  did  not  come  to  this  world  to  enjoy 
himself and receive pleasure.

Moreover, man is the most perfect, the most elevated, of living beings 
and the best endowed in regard to members and faculties, and indeed is like 
the monarach of animate beings, but despite this he dwells on past pleasures 
and future pains and so passes a grievous, troublesome life, lower than the

animals. This means that man did not come to this world only to live in a fine 
manner and pass his life in ease and pleasure. Rather, he possesses vast capi-
tal, and he came here to work and do trade for an eternal, everlasting life. 

The capital given to man is his lifetime. Had there been no illness, good 
health and well-being would have caused heedlessness, for they show him 
the  world  to  be  pleasant  and  make  the  hereafter  forgotten.  They  do  not 
want  death  and  the  grave  to  be  thought  of;  they  cause  the  capital  of  life 
to  be  wasted  on  trifles.  Whereas  illness  suddenly  opens  the  eyes,  it  says 
to the body: “ You are not immortal. You have not been left to your own 
devices. You have a duty. Give up your pride, think of the One who created 
you. Know that you will enter the grave, so prepare yourself for it! ” From 
this point of view, illness is an admonishing guide and adviser that never 
deceives. It should not be complained about in this respect, indeed, it should 
be thanked for. And if it is too severe, patience should be sought to endure it.

FOURTH REMEDY

Plaintive ill person! You have no right to complain; what is due to you is 
to offer thanks and be patient. For your body and members and faculties are 
not your property. You did not make them, nor did you buy them from other 
workshops. That means they are someone else’s property, and their owner 
has disposal over his property as he wishes. 

As is related in the Twenty-Sixth Word, an extremely wealthy and skil-
ful  craftsman,  for  example,  employs  a  poor  man  as  a  model  in  order  to 
show off his fine art and considerable wealth. In return for a wage, for a 
brief hour he clothes the poor man in a bejewelled and skilfully wrought 
garment. He works it on him and gives it various states. In order to display 
the  extraordinary  varieties  of  his  art,  he  cuts  the  garment,  alters  it,  and 
lengthens and shortens it. Does the poor wage earner have the right to say 
to that person: “ You are causing me trouble, you are causing me distress 
with the form you have given it, making me bow down and stand up? ” Has 
he the right to tell him that he is spoiling his fine appearance by trimming 
and shortening the garment which makes him beautiful? Can he tell him he 
is being unkind and unfair? 

O sick person! Just like in this comparison, in order to display the gar-
ment of your body with which He has clothed you, bejewelled with luminous 
faculties like the eye, the ear, the reason, and the heart, and the embroideries 
of  His  most  beautiful  names,  the  All-Glorious  Maker  makes  you  revolve 
amid numerous states and changes you in many situations. Just as you learn 

TWENTY-FIFTH FLASH

273

of  His  name  of  Provider  through  hunger,  so  come  to  know  His  name  of 
Healer through your illness. Since suffering and calamities show the decrees 
of some of His names, within them ﬂashes of wisdom and rays of mercy are 
to be found, and within those rays, many instances of good. If the veil of ill-
ness, which you fear and loathe, were to be lifted, behind it you would find 
many agreeable and beautiful meanings.

FIFTH REMEDY

O you who is afflicted with illness! Through experience, I have formed 
the  opinion  at  this  time  that  for  some  people  sickness  is  a  divine  bounty, 
a gift of the Most Merciful. Although I was not worthy of it, over the past 
eight or nine years a number of young people have come to me in connec-
tion  with  their  illnesses,  to  request  my  prayers.  I  have  noticed  that  all  of 
them  have  begun  to  think  of  the  hereafter  more  than  other  young  people. 
They lack the drunkenness of youth, and have renounced to an extent animal 
desires and heedlessness. So I consider them and then remind them that their 
illnesses are a divine bounty within bearable limits. I tell them: “ Brother! I 
am not opposed to this illness of yours. I don’t feel sorry for you because of 
it that I should pray for you. Try to be patient until the illness awakens you 
completely, and once it has performed its duty, the Compassionate Creator 
will restore you to health, Allah willing. ”

I also tell them: “ Owing to the calamity of good health, some of your 
fellows become neglectful, give up the five daily prayers, do not think of 
the  grave,  and  forget  Allah  Almighty.  The  superficial  pleasure  of  a  brief 
hour’s worldly life causes them to shake and damage eternal life, and even 
to destroy it. Whereas because of your illness, you see the grave, which you 
will in any event enter, and the dwellings of the hereafter beyond it, and you 
act accordingly. So for you, illness is good health, while for some of your 
peers good health is a sickness. ”

SIXTH REMEDY

O sick person who complains about his suffering! I say to you: think of 
your past life and remember the pleasurable, happy days and the distress-
ing, troublesome times, and you will surely exclaim either “ Oh! ” or “ Ah! ” 
That  is,  your  heart  and  tongue  will  either  say  “ All  praise  and  thanks  be 
to Allah! ”, or “ Alas and alack! ” Note carefully, what makes you exclaim 
“ Praise  and  thanks  be  to  Allah! ”  is  thinking  of  the  pains  and  calamities 
that  have  befallen  you;  they  induce  a  sort  of  pleasure  so  that  your  heart 
offers thanks, for the passing of pain is a pleasure. With the passing of pains 

274

THE FLASHES

and  calamities,  a  legacy  of  pleasure  is  left  in  the  spirit,  which  on  being 
aroused by thinking, pours forth from the spirit in thanks. 

What  makes  you  exclaim  “ Alas  and  alack! ”  are  the  pleasurable  and 
happy  times  you  have  experienced  in  the  past,  which  with  their  passing 
leave a legacy in your spirit of constant pain. Whenever you think of them, 
the pain is again stimulated, causing regret and sorrow to pour forth.

Since  one  day’s  illicit  pleasure  sometimes  causes  a  year’s  suffering  in 
the spirit, and with the pain of a fleeting day’s illness causes many days’ 
pleasure and recompense in addition to the pleasure at being relieved at its 
passing, think of the result of this temporary illness with which you are now 
afflicted, and of the merits of its inner face. Say: “ All is from Allah! This too 
will pass! ”, and offer thanks instead of complaining.
SIXTH REMEDY 1

Sixth Remedy

O brother who thinks of the pleasures of this world and suffers distress 
at illness! If this world were everlasting, and if on our way there were no 
death, and if the winds of separation and decease did not blow, and if there 
were no winters of the spirit in the calamitous and stormy future, I would 
have pitied you together with you. But since one day the world will bid us 
to leave it and will close its ears to our cries, we must forego our love of 
it now through the warnings of these illnesses, before it drives us out. We 
must try to abandon it in our hearts before it abandons us.

Yes,  illness  utters  this  warning  to  us:  “ Your  body  is  not  composed  of 
stone and iron, but of various materials which are ever disposed to parting. 
Leave off your pride, perceive your impotence, recognize your Owner, know 
your duties, learn why you came to this world! ” It declares this secretly in 
the heart’s ear.

Moreover, since the pleasures and enjoyment of this world do not con-
tinue,  and  particularly  if  they  are  illicit  they  are  both  fleeting,  and  full  of 
pain, and sinful, do not weep on the pretext of illness because you have lost 
those pleasures. On the contrary, think of the aspects of worship and reward 
in the hereafter to be found in illness, and try to receive pleasure from those.

SEVENTH REMEDY

O  sick  person  who  has  lost  the  pleasures  of  health!  Your  illness  does 
not  spoil  the  pleasure  of  divine  bounties,  on  the  contrary,  it  causes  them 

1.  This Flash occurred to me in a natural manner, and two remedies have been includ-
ed in the Sixth Remedy. We have left it thus in order not to spoil the naturalness; indeed, 
we did not change it thinking there may be some mystery contained in it.

TWENTY-FIFTH FLASH

to  be  experienced  and  increases  them.  For  if  something  is  continuous,  it 
loses its effect. The people of reality even say that اَ(cid:182)ِداَد ْ(cid:138)َاِ(cid:92)  ُفَرْ(cid:151)ُ(cid:98) ُءاَ(cid:193) ْ(cid:130)َ
ْ(cid:202)ا ا َ(cid:175)َ
ّ(cid:178)ِا 
For example, if there were no darkness, light would not be known and would 
produce no pleasure. If there were no cold, heat could not be comprehended 
and  would  not  be  agreeable.  If  there  were  no  hunger,  food  would  not  be 
enjoyable. If there were no thirst of the stomach, there would be no pleasure 
in drinking water. If there were no sickness, no pleasure would be had from 
good health.

The  All-Wise  Creator’s  decking  out  man  with  truly  numerous  mem-
bers and faculties, to the extent that he may experience and recognize the 
innumerable  varieties  of  bounties  in  the  universe,  shows  that  He  wants 
to make him aware of every sort of His bounty and to acquaint him with 
them and to impel him to offer constant thanks. Since this is so, He will 
give illness, sickness, and suffering, the same as He bestows good health 
and well-being. I ask you: If you had not suffered this illness in your head 
or in your hand or stomach, would you have perceived the pleasurable and 
enjoyable divine bounty of the good health of your head, hand or stom-
ach, and offered thanks? For sure, you would not have even thought of it, 
let alone offering thanks for it! You would have unconsciously spent that 
good health on heedlessness, and perhaps even on dissipation.

EIGHTH REMEDY

O  sick  person  who  thinks  of  the  hereafter!  Sickness  washes  away  the 
dirt of sins like soap, and cleanses. It is established in a sound Hadith that 
illnesses  are  atonement  for  sins.  And  in  another  Hadith,  it  says:  “ As  ripe 
fruits fall on their tree being shaken, so the sins of a believer fall away on his 
shaking with illness. ” 1

Sins are the chronic illnesses of eternal life, and in this worldly life they 
are  sicknesses  of  the  heart,  conscience,  and  spirit.  If  you  are  patient  and 
do not complain, you will be saved through this temporary sickness from 
numerous perpetual sicknesses. If you do not think of your sins, or do not 
know the hereafter, or do not recognize Allah, you suffer from an illness so 
fearsome it is a million times worse than your present minor illnesses. Cry 
out  at  that,  for  all  the  beings  in  the  world  are  connected  with  your  heart, 
spirit, and soul. Those connections are continuously severed by death and 
separation, opening up innumerable wounds. Particularly since you do not

441; ii, 303, 335; iii, 4, 18, 38, 48, 61, 81.

276

THE FLASHES

know the hereafter and imagine death to be eternal non-existence, as though 
lacerated and bruised, your being suffers illness to the extent of the world. 

Thus, the first thing you have to do is to search for the cure of belief, 
which is the certain healing remedy for the innumerable illnesses afflicting 
that infinitely wounded and sick, extensive immaterial being of yours; you 
have to correct your beliefs. The shortest way of finding such a cure is to 
recognize the power and mercy of the All-Powerful One of Glory by means 
of the window of your weakness and impotence shown you behind the cur-
tain of heedlessness, rent by your physical illness.

Yes,  one  who  does  not  recognize  Allah  is  afflicted  by  a  world-full  of 
tribulations. While the world of one who does recognize Him is full of light 
and spiritual happiness; he perceives these in accordance with the strength 
of his belief. The suffering resulting from insignificant physical illnesses is 
dissolved by the immaterial joy, healing, and pleasure that arise from belief; 
the suffering melts away.

NINTH REMEDY

O sick person who recognizes his Creator! Illness gives rise to pain, fear, 
and anxiety because it sometimes leads to death. Since superficially and to 
the heedless death is terrifying, illnesses which may lead to it cause fear and 
apprehension.

So know firstly and believe firmly that the appointed hour is determined 
and does not change. Those weeping beside the grievously sick and those 
in perfect health have died, while the grievously sick have been cured and 
lived.

S e c o n d l y :  Death is not terrifying as it appears to be superficially. Through 
the  light  afforded  by  the  All-Wise  Qur’an,  in  many  parts  of  the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r  we have proved in completely certain and indubitable fashion that for 
believers death is to be discharged from the burdensome duties of life. For 
them it is a rest from worship, which forms the instruction and training in 
the arena of trial of this world. It is also a means of their rejoining friends 
and relations, ninety-nine out of a hundred of whom have already departed 
for the next world. It is a means of entering their true homeland and eternal 
abodes of happiness. It is also an invitation to the gardens of Paradise from 
the dungeon of this world. And it is the time they receive their wage from 
the  munificence  of  the  Most  Compassionate  Creator  in  return  for  service 
rendered to Him. Since the reality of death is this, it should be regarded not 
as terrifying, but on the contrary as the introduction to mercy and happiness.

TWENTY-FIFTH FLASH

277

Moreover, some of the people of Allah have feared death, not out of ter-
ror at it but because they hoped to gain additional merit by performing more 
good works with the duties of life continuing.

Yes, for the people of belief, death is the door to divine mercy, while for 

the people of misguidance, it is the pit of everlasting darkness.

TENTH REMEDY

O sick person who worries unnecessarily! You worry at the severity of 
your illness and that worry exacerbates it. If you want your illness to be less 
severe,  try  not  to  worry.  That  is,  think  of  the  benefits  of  your  illness,  the 
recompense for it, and that it will pass quickly; it will remove the worry and 
cut the illness at the root.

In  fact,  worry  doubles  the  illness,  for  it  causes  an  immaterial  illness 
of  the  heart  underlying  the  physical  illness;  the  physical  illness  subsists 
through that and persists. If the worry ceases through submission, content-
ment, and comprehension of the reason for the illness, a large part of the ill-
ness is eradicated; it becomes less severe and in part disappears. Sometimes 
a minor physical illness increases tenfold just through anxiety. If the anxiety 
ceases, nine tenths of the illness disappears.

Worry increases illness. It also an accusation against divine wisdom and 
a criticism of divine mercy and complaint against the Compassionate Crea-
tor. For this reason, the person who worries receives a rebuff and it increases 
his illness contrary to his intentions. Yes, just as thanks increases bounty, so 
complaint increases illness and tribulations.

Furthermore, worry is itself an illness. Its cure is to recognize the wisdom 
in illness and its purpose. Since you have now learnt these, apply the salve to 
your worry and find relief! Say “ Ah! ” instead of “ Oh! ”, and “ All praise be 
to Allah for every situation ” instead of sighing and lamenting.

ELEVENTH REMEDY

O my impatient sick brother! Although illness causes you an immediate 
suffering, your illness through the past until today produces a spiritual pleas-
ure and happiness arising from the reward received for enduring it. From 
today forward, from this hour even, the illness does not exist, and certainly 
no pain is suffered from non-being. And if there is no pain, there can be no 
distress. You become impatient because you imagine things wrongly. For 
both the physical illness prior to today, and its pain, have departed; all that 
remains are its reward and the pleasure at its passing. This should afford you 

278

THE FLASHES

profit and happiness, so to think of past days and feel grieved and impatient 
is crazy. Future days have not yet arrived. To dwell on them now, and to feel 
upset and impatient by imagining a day that does not exist and an illness that 
does not exist and distress that does not exist, is to impart existence to three 
degrees of non-existence – if that is not crazy, what is?

If  the  previous  hour  was  one  of  illness,  it  produces  joy;  and  since  the 
time subsequent to the present hour is non-existent, and both the illness and 
the distress are non-existent, do not scatter the power of patience given you 
by Almighty Allah to right and left, but muster it in the face of pain of the 
present hour; say: “ O Most Patient One! ” and withstand it.

TWELFTH REMEDY

O sick person who due to illness cannot perform his worship and invoca-
tions and feels grief at the deprivation! Know that it is stated in a Hadith: “ A 
pious believer who due to illness cannot perform his customary invocations, 
receives a reward equal to them. ” 1 If an ill person performs his obligatory 
worship as far as it is possible with patience and relying on Allah, the illness 
takes the place of Sunna worship during that time of severe illness – and in 
sincere form.

Moreover, illness makes the person understand his impotence and weak-
ness; it causes him to offer supplication both verbally and through the tongue 
of  his  impotence  and  weakness.  For  Almighty  Allah  bestowed  on  man  a 
boundless  impotence  and  infinite  weakness  so  that  he  would  perpetually 
seek refuge at the divine court and beseech and supplicate. The verse, 

 ( 25:77 ) » º ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´
has  the  meaning,  “ what  importance  would  you  have  if  you  did  not  offer 
prayer and supplication? ” According to this, sincere prayer and supplication 
are the reason for man’s creation and for his value. Since illness is one cause 
of this, from this point of view it should not be complained about but thanks 
be offered to Allah for it, and the tap of supplication which illness opens 
should not be closed by regaining health.

THIRTEENTH REMEDY

O unhappy person who complains at illness! For some people illness is 
a rich treasury, a precious divine gift. Every sick person can think of his ill-
ness in this way.

1.  B u k h ā r ī , Jihād, 134; M u s n a d , iv, 410, 418.

TWENTY-FIFTH FLASH

279

The appointed hour is not known: in order to deliver man from abso-
lute  despair  and  absolute  heedlessness,  and  to  hold  him  between  hope 
and fear and so preserve both this world and the hereafter, in His wisdom 
Almighty  Allah  has  concealed  the  appointed  hour;  it  may  come  at  any 
time. If it captures man in heedlessness, it may cause grievous harm to 
eternal life. Illness, however, dispels the heedlessness; it makes a person 
think of the hereafter; it recalls death, so he may prepare himself. Some 
illnesses are so profitable as to gain for a person in twenty days a rank 
they could not otherwise have risen to in twenty years.

For instance, among my friends were two youths, may Allah have mercy 
on them. One was Sabri from the village of ‹lema, the other Vezirzâde Mus-
tafa from İslâmköy. I used to note with amazement that although these two 
could  not  write  they  were  among  the  foremost  in  regard  to  sincerity  and 
the service of belief. I did not know the reason for this. After their deaths I 
understood that each had suffered from a serious illness. Due to the guid-
ance of the illness, they had considerable fear of Allah, performed highly 
valuable service, and attained a state beneficial to the hereafter, unlike other 
youths who heedlessly gave up obligatory worship. Allah willing, the dis-
tress of two years’ illness allowed them to attain the happiness of millions of 
years of eternal life. I understand now that the prayers I sometimes offered 
for  their  health  were  maledictions  in  respect  of  this  world.  Allah  willing, 
they were accepted for their well-being in the hereafter.

Thus, according to my belief, the two gained profit equal to that which 
may be gained through ten years’ fear of Allah. If like some young people, 
they had relied on their youth and good health and thrown themselves into 
heedlessness and vice, and stalking them, death had grabbed them right in 
the midst of the filth of their sins, they would have made their graves into 
nests of scorpions and snakes, instead of that treasury of lights.

Since  illnesses  contain  such  benefits,  they  should  be  not  complained 
about but borne with patience, relying on Allah, indeed, thanking Allah and 
having confidence in His mercy.

FOURTEENTH REMEDY

O sick person who has lost their eyesight! If you knew what a light and 
spiritual eye is to be found beneath the veil that may cover a believer’s eyes, 
you would exclaim: “ A hundred thousand thanks to my Compassionate Sus-
tainer! ” I shall recount an incident to explain this salve. It is as follows:

One  time,  the  aunt  of  Süleyman  from  Barla,  who  served  me  for  eight 
years  with  complete  loyalty  and  willingness,  became  blind.  Owing  to  her 

280

THE FLASHES

good opinion of me, which was a hundred times better than I deserved, the 
righteous woman caught me by the door of the mosque and asked me to pray 
for her sight to be restored. So I made the blessed woman’s righteousness the 
intercessor for my supplication, and beseeching Almighty Allah, I prayed: 
“ O Lord! Restore her sight out of respect for her righteousness. ” Two days 
later, an oculist from Burdur came and cured her eyes. Forty days later she 
again lost her sight. I was most upset and prayed fervently for her. Allah 
willing, the prayer was accepted for her life in the hereafter, otherwise that 
prayer of mine would have been a mistaken malediction for her. For forty 
days had remained till her death; forty days later she died – May Allah have 
mercy on her.

Thus, rather than gazing sorrowfully at the gardens of Barla with the eye 
of old age, she profited in her grave by being able to gaze for forty thousand 
days on the gardens of Paradise. For her belief was strong and she was com-
pletely righteous.

Yes, if a believer loses his sight and enters the grave blind, in accordance 
with his degree he may gaze on the world of light to an extent much greater 
than  other  dead  in  their  graves.  Just  as  we  see  many  things  in  this  world 
that blind believers do not see, if the blind depart with belief, they see to a 
greater extent than other dead in their graves. They can behold the gardens 
of Paradise and watch them like the cinema as though looking through the 
most powerful telescopes, according to their degree.

Thus, through thanks and patience you may find beneath the veil on your 
present eye an eye which is thus light-filled, and with which while beneath 
the earth you may see and observe Paradise above the skies. That which will 
raise the veil from your eye, the eye doctor that will allow you to look with 
that eye, is the All-Wise Qur’an. 

FIFTEENTH REMEDY

O sick person who sighs and laments! Do not look at the outward aspect 
of  illness  and  sigh,  consider  its  meaning  and  be  pleased.  If  in  meaning  ill-
ness  had  not  been  good,  the  All-Compassionate  Creator  would  not  have 
given it to the servants He loves most. For there is a Hadith the meaning 
of  which  is,  ُلَ(cid:103)ْ(cid:174)َ
ْ(cid:202)ا َ
ّدَ(cid:130)َا  1  That  is, 
“ Those most afflicted with tribulations and difficulties are the best of men,

the most perfect. ” Foremost the Prophet Job ( Peace be upon him ) and the 
other  prophets,  then  the  saints,  then  the  righteous,  have  regarded  the  ill-
nesses they have suffered as sincere worship, as gifts of the Most Merciful; 
they have offered thanks in patience. They have seen them as surgical opera-
tions performed by the All-Compassionate Creator’s mercy.

O  you  who  cries  out  and  laments!  If  you  want  to  join  this  luminous 
caravan, offer thanks in patience. For if you complain, they will not accept 
you. You will fall into the pits of the people of misguidance, and travel a 
dark road.

Yes, there are some illnesses which if they lead to death, are a sort of 
martyrdom; they result in a similar degree of sainthood. For example, peo-
ple become martyrs who die from the illnesses accompanying childbirth 1 
and pains of the abdomen, and by drowning, burning, and plague. There are 
also many blessed illnesses which gain the degree of sainthood for those 
who die from them. Moreover, since illness lessens love of the world and 
attachment to it, it lightens parting from the world through death, which 
for the worldly is extremely grievous and painful, and it sometimes even 
makes it desirable.

SIXTEENTH REMEDY

O sick person who complains at his distress! Illness prompts respect and 
compassion, which are most important and good in human social life. For 
it saves man from self-sufficiency, which drives him to unsociableness and 
unkindness. For according to the meaning of the verse,
( 96:6-7 ) k j i  *  g f e d
an evil-commanding soul which feels self-sufficient due to good health and 
well-being,  does  not  feel  respect  towards  his  brothers  in  many  instances, 
who are deserving of it. And he does not feel compassion towards the sick 
and  those  smitten  by  disaster,  although  they  deserve  kindness  and  pity. 
Whenever  he  is  ill,  he  understands  his  own  powerlessness  and  want  and 
he has respect towards his brothers who are worthy of it. He feels respect 
towards his believing brothers who visit him or assist him. He feels human 
kindness, which arises from fellow-feeling, and compassion for those struck 
by disaster, a most important Islamic characteristic. And comparing them to 
himself, he pities them in the true meaning of the word and feels compas-
sion for them. He does what he can to help them, and at the very least prays

‘lying-in.’

for them and goes to visit them to ask them how they are, which is S u n n a  
according to the Shari‘a, and thus earns reward.

SEVENTEENTH REMEDY

O sick person who complains at not being able to perform good works 
due to illness! Offer thanks! It is illness that opens to you the door of the 
sincerest of good works. In addition to continuously gaining reward for the 
sick person and for those who look after him for Allah’s sake, illness is a 
most important means for the acceptance of supplications.

Indeed,  there  is  significant  reward  for  believers  looking  after  the  sick. 
Inquiring after their health and visiting the sick – on condition it does not tax 
them – is S u n n a  1 and also atonement for sins. There is an Hadith which says, 
“ Receive the prayers of the sick, for they are acceptable. ” 2

To look after the sick, especially if they are relations, or parents in par-
ticular, is important worship, yielding significant reward. To please a sick 
person’s heart and console him, is a sort of significant almsgiving. Fortunate 
is the person who pleases the easily touched hearts of father and mother at a 
time of illness and receives their prayer. Even the angels applaud, exclaim-
ing: “ M a ’s h a l l a h !   B a r e k a l l a h !  ” before loyal scenes of those good offspring 
who  respond  with  perfect  respect  and  filial  kindness  at  the  time  of  their 
parents’ illness showing the exaltedness of humanity – for they are the most 
worthy of respect in the life of society.

Yes,  pleasures  are  experienced  at  the  time  of  illness  which  arise  from 
the kindness, pity, and compassion of those around, and are most pleasant 
and agreeable and reduce the pains of illness to nothing. The acceptability 
of the prayers of the sick is an important matter. For the past thirty or forty 
years, I myself have prayed to be cured from the illness of lumbago from 
which I suffer. However, I understood that the illness had been given for 
prayer. Since prayer cannot be removed by prayer; that is, since prayer can-
not remove itself, I understood that the results of prayer pertain to the hereaf-
ter, 3 and that it is a sort of worship, for through illness one understands one’s 
impotence and seeks refuge at the divine court. Therefore, although for thirty 
years I have offered supplications to be healed and apparently my prayer has 
not been accepted, it has not occurred to me to give it up. For illness is the

2.  I b n   M ā j a , Janā’iz, 1; Daylamī, M u s n a d  al-Firdaws, i, 280.
3.  Yes, while certain illnesses are the reason for the existence of supplication, if the 
supplication  is  the  cause  of  the  illness’  non-existence,  the  existence  of  the  supplication 
would be the cause of its own non-existence, and this could not be the case.

TWENTY-FIFTH FLASH

283

time for supplication. To be cured is not the result of the supplication. If the 
All-Wise and Compassionate One bestows healing, He bestows it out of His 
abundant grace.

Furthermore,  if  supplications  are  not  accepted  in  the  form  we  wish,  it 
should not be said that they have not been accepted. The All-Wise Creator 
knows better than us; He gives whatever is in our interests. Sometimes he 
directs our prayers for this world towards the hereafter, and accepts them in 
that way. In any event, a supplication that acquires sincerity due to illness 
and arises from weakness, impotence, humility and need, is very close to 
being acceptable. Illness makes supplication sincere. Both the sick who are 
religious, and believers who look after the sick, should take advantage of 
this supplication.

EIGHTEENTH REMEDY

O sick person who gives up offering thanks and takes up complaining! 
Complaint arises from a right, and none of your rights have been lost that 
you should complain. Indeed, there are numerous thanks which are an obli-
gation for you, a right over you, and these you have not performed. Without 
giving Almighty Allah what is due to Him, you are complaining as though 
demanding rights in a manner which is not rightful. You cannot look at oth-
ers superior to you in degree who are healthy, and complain. You are rather 
charged with looking at the sick who from the point of view of health are 
at  a  degree  lower  than  yourself,  and  should  offer  thanks.  If  your  hand  is 
broken, look at theirs, which is severed. If you have only one eye, look at 
the blind, who lack both eyes, and offer thanks to Allah!

For sure, no one has the right to look to those superior to him in regard 
to  bounties  and  complain.  Concerning  tribulations,  it  is  everyone’s  right 
to look to those above themselves in that regard, so that they should offer 
thanks. This mystery has been explained in a number of places in the R i s a l e -
i   N u r  with a comparison; a summary of it is as follows:

A person takes a wretched man to the top of a minaret. On every step he 
gives him a different gift, a different bounty. Right at the top he gives him 
the largest present. Although he wants thanks and gratitude in return for all 
those various gifts, the peevish man forgets the presents he has received on 
each of the stairs, or considers them to be of no importance, and offering no 
thanks, looks above him and starts to complain, saying, “ If only the minaret 
had been higher, I could have climbed even further. Why isn’t it as tall as 
that mountain over there or that other minaret? ” What great ingratitude it 
would be if he begins to complain like this, what a wrong! 

284

THE FLASHES

In just the same way, man comes into existence from nothing, not as a 
rock or a tree or an animal, but as a human being and a Muslim, and most 
of the time experiences good health and acquires a high level of bounties. 
Despite all this, to complain and display impatience because he is not wor-
thy of some bounties, or because he loses them through wrong choices or 
abuse, or because he could not obtain them, and to criticize divine domini-
cality saying “ What have I done that this has happened to me? ”, is a state 
of mind and spiritual sickness more calamitous than the physical one. Like 
fighting with a broken hand, complaint makes his illness worse. Sensible is 
the person who in accordance with the meaning of the verse, 
ّلﯭﯧِ(cid:170)

( 2:156 ) ﴾ G F E D C  ﴿  ٍةَ(cid:93)(cid:193) ِ(cid:135)ُ(cid:174)  ِ

submits and is patient, so that the illness may complete its duty, then depart.

NINETEENTH REMEDY

As  the  attribute  of  the  Eternally  Besought  One,  “ the  most  beautiful 
names ” indicates, all the All-Beauteous One of Glory’s names are beauti-
ful. Among beings, life is the most subtle, the most beautiful, and the most 
comprehensive mirror of Eternal Besoughtedness. The mirror to the beau-
tiful is beautiful. The mirror that displays the virtues of beauty becomes 
beautiful. Just as whatever is done to the mirror by such beauty is good 
and beautiful, whatever befalls life too, in respect of reality, is good. For 
it displays the beautiful impresses of the most beautiful names, which are 
good and beautiful.

Life becomes a deficient mirror if it passes monotonously with perma-
nent health and well-being. In one respect, it suggests non-existence, non-
being,  and  nothingness,  and  causes  weariness.  It  reduces  the  life’s  value 
and transforms the pleasure of life into distress. For thinking he will pass 
his time quickly, out of boredom a person throws himself either into vice or 
into amusements. He becomes hostile to his valuable life and wants to kill 
it and make it pass quickly as though it were a prison sentence. But when it 
revolves in change and action and different states, life makes its value felt, 
and its importance and pleasure. Such a person does not want his life to pass 
quickly, even if it is in hardship and tribulation. He does not complain wea-
rily, saying, “ Alas! The sun hasn’t set yet, ” or, “ it is still nighttime. ”

Yes, ask a fine gentleman who is rich and idle and living in the lap of 
luxury, “ How are you? ” You are bound to hear a pathetic reply like: “ The 
time never passes. Let’s have a game of backgammon. Or let’s find some 
amusement  to  pass  the  time. ”  Or  else  you  will  hear  complaints  arising 

TWENTY-FIFTH FLASH

285

from worldly ambition, like: “ I haven’t got that; if only I had done such-
and-such. ”

Then ask someone struck by disaster or a worker or poor man living in 
penury: “ How are you? ” If he is sensible, he will reply: “ All thanks be to 
Allah, I am working. If only the evening did not come so quickly, I could 
have finished this work! Time passes so quickly, and so does life; they flash 
by. For sure things are hard for me, but that will pass too. Everything passes 
quickly. ” He in effect says how valuable life is and how regretful he is at 
its passing. That means he perceives the pleasure and value of life through 
hardship and labour. As for ease and health, they make life bitter and make 
one hope for its speedy passing.

My brother who is sick! Know that non-existence is the origin and leaven 
of calamities and evils, and even of sins, as is proved decisively and in detail 
in other parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . As for non-existence, it is evil, it is dark-
ness. Monotonous states like ease, silence, tranquillity, and arrest are close 
to non-existence and nothingness, and therefore make felt the darkness of 
non-existence and cause distress. As for action and change, they are exist-
ence and make existence felt. And existence is pure good; it is light.

Since the reality is thus, your illness has been sent to your being as a guest 
to perform many duties such as purifying your valuable life, and strengthen-
ing it and making it progress, and inducing the other human faculties in your 
being to turn in assistance towards your sick member, and to display various 
of  the  All-Wise  Maker’s  names.  Allah  willing,  it  will  carry  out  its  duties 
quickly and depart, and will say to good health: “ Come, and stay perma-
nently in my place, and carry out your duties. This house is yours. Remain 
here in good health. ”

TWENTIETH REMEDY

O sick person who is searching for a remedy for his ills! Illness is of two 
sorts. One sort is real, the other, imaginary. As for the real sort, the All-Wise 
and Glorious Healer has stored up in His mighty pharmacy of the earth a 
cure  for  every  illness.  As  for  the  cures,  they  require  the  illnesses.  He  has 
created a cure for every illness. Those cures seek illnesses and He created a 
cure for every ill. It is licit to obtain medicines and use them as treatment, 
but one should know that their effect and the cure are from Almighty Allah. 
He both gives the ailment and provides the cure.

Following  the  recommendations  of  skilful,  Allah-fearing  doctors  is  an 
effective medicine. For most illnesses arise from abuses, lack of abstinence, 

286

THE FLASHES

wastefulness, mistakes, dissipation, and lack of care. A religious doctor will 
certainly give advice and instructions within the bounds of the lawful. He 
will forbid abuses and excesses, and give consolation. The sick person has 
confidence in his advice and consolation, and his illness lessens; it produces 
as easiness for him in place of distress.

But when it comes to imaginary illness, the most effective medicine is to 
give it no importance. The more importance is given to it, the more it grows 
and swells. If it is disregarded, it lessens and disperses. The more bees are 
upset the more they swarm around a person’s head, but they disperse if no 
attention is paid to them. Similarly, the more importance one pays to a piece 
of string waving in front of one’s eyes in the darkness and to the apprehen-
sion it causes one, the more it grows and makes one flee like a madman. 
While if one pays it no importance, one sees that it is an ordinary bit of string 
and not a snake, and laughs at one’s fright and anxiety.

If hypochondria is chronic, it is transformed into reality. It is a serious 
illness  afflicting  the  nervous  and  those  given  to  imaginings;  such  people 
make mountains out of molehills and their morale is destroyed. Then if they 
encounter unkind ‘half’ doctors or unfair doctors, it further provokes their 
hypochondria. If they are rich, they lose their wealth, or they lose their wits, 
or their health.

TWENTY-FIRST REMEDY

My sick brother! Your illness is accompanied by physical pain. How-
ever, you are surrounded by a significant spiritual pleasure that will remove 
its effect. For if your father, mother, and relations are with you, their most 
pleasurable compassion which you have forgotten since childhood will be 
reawakened and you will see again the kind looks you received in child-
hood. In addition, friendships envelop you that had remained secret and 
hidden; these too look towards you with love through the attraction of ill-
ness. In the face of these, your physical pain is reduced to insignificance. 
Also,  you  have  become  a  master  of  the  masters  since  those  whom  you 
used to serve proudly now serve you kindly at the decree of illness. More-
over,  you  have  attracted  towards  yourself  the  fellow-feeling  and  human 
kindness in people, and so have found numerous helpful friends and kind 
companions. And again, you have received the order from your illness to 
rest from many taxing duties and are taking a rest. For sure, in the face of 
these immaterial pleasures, your minor pain should drive you to thanks, 
not complaint.

TWENTY-FIFTH FLASH

287

TWENTY-SECOND REMEDY

My brother who suffers from a severe illness like apoplexy! Firstly I give 
you the good news that for believers apoplexy is considered blessed. A long 
time ago I used to hear this from holy men and I did not know the reason. 
Now, one reason for it occurs to me, as follows:

In order to attain union with Almighty Allah, be saved from the spiritual 
perils of this world, and to win eternal happiness, the people of Allah have 
chosen to follow two principles:

T h e   F i r s t  is contemplation of death. Thinking that both the world is tran-
sitory, and they themselves are temporary guests charged with duties, they 
work for eternal life in this way.

T h e   S e c o n d :   Through  fasting,  religious  exercises  and  asceticism,  they 
try to kill the evil-commanding soul and so be saved from its dangers and 
from the blind emotions.

And you, my brother who has lost the health of half his body! Without 
choosing it, you have been given these two principles, which are short and 
easy and the cause of happiness. Thus, the state of your being perpetually 
warns you of the fleeting nature of the world and that man is transient. The 
world can no longer drown you, nor heedlessness close your eyes. And for 
sure, the evil-commanding soul cannot deceive with lowly lust and animal 
appetites someone in the state of half a man; he is quickly saved from the 
trials of the soul.

Thus, through the mystery of belief in Allah and submission to Him and 
reliance on Him, a believer can benefit in a brief time from a severe illness 
like  apoplexy,  resembling  the  severe  trials  of  the  saints.  A  severe  illness 
such as that thus becomes exceedingly cheap.

TWENTY-THIRD REMEDY

Unhappy ill person who is alone and a stranger! Even if your aloneness 
and exile together with your illness were to arouse sympathy towards you 
in the hardest hearts and attract kindness and compassion, could it be a sub-
stitute for your All-Compassionate Creator? For He presents Himself to us 
at  the  start  of  all  the  Qur’an’s  Suras  with  the  attributes  of  “ the  Merciful 
and the Compassionate, ” and with one flash of His compassion makes all 
mothers nurture their young with that wonderful tenderness, and with one 
manifestation of His mercy every spring fills the face of the earth with boun-
ties.  Eternal  life  in  Paradise  together  with  all  its  wonders  is  but  a  single 
manifestation of His mercy. Then surely your relation to Him through belief, 

288

THE FLASHES

your  recognizing  Him  and  beseeching  Him  through  the  tongue  of  impo-
tence, arising from your illness and the affliction of your loneliness in exile, 
will attract the glance of His mercy towards you, which takes the place of 
everything. Since He exists and He looks to you, everything exists for you. 
Those who are truly alone and in exile are those who are not connected with 
Him through belief and submission, or attach no importance to that relation.

TWENTY-FOURTH REMEDY

O you who look after innocent sick children or the elderly, who resemble 
innocent children! You have before you important trade for the hereafter. 
So procure it through your enthusiasm and effort! It is established by the 
people of reality that the illnesses of innocent children are like training for 
their delicate bodies, and injections and dominical training to allow them to 
withstand in the future the upheavals of the world; that in addition to many 
instances  of  wisdom  pertaining  to  the  child’s  worldly  life,  instead  of  the 
atonement for sins in adults which looks to spiritual life and is the means 
to purifying life, illnesses are like injections ensuring the child’s spiritual 
progress in the future or in the hereafter; and that the merits accruing from 
such illnesses pass to the book of good works of the parents, and particularly 
of the mother who through the mystery of compassion prefers the health of 
her child to her own health.

As for looking after the elderly, it is established in sound narrations and 
many historical events that together with receiving huge reward, to receive 
the prayers of the elderly and especially of parents, and to make happy their 
hearts and serve them loyally, leads to happiness in both this world and the 
next. And it is established by many events that a fortunate child who obeys 
to the letter his elderly parents will be treated similarly by his children, but if 
a wretched child wounds his parents he will be punished by means of many 
disasters in this world and in the hereafter. Yes, Islam requires that one looks 
after not only relatives who are elderly or innocents, but also elderly believ-
ers if one encounters them – through the mystery of the true brotherhood of 
belief – and that one serves to one’s utmost ability the venerable sick elderly 
if they are in need of it.

TWENTY-FIFTH REMEDY

My  sick  brothers!  If  you  want  a  most  beneficial  and  truly  pleasurable 
sacred cure, strengthen and develop your belief! That is, make use of belief, 
that  sacred  cure,  and  of  the  medicine  which  arises  from  belief  through 
repentance and seeking forgiveness, and the five daily prayers and worship.

TWENTY-FIFTH FLASH

289

You as though possess a sick immaterial being as large as the world due 
to love of this world and attachment to it, like the heedless. We have proved 
in many parts of the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  that belief at once heals that immaterial 
being  of  yours,  which  is  bruised  and  battered  by  the  blows  of  death  and 
separation, and saves it from the wounds and truly heals it. But I cut short 
the discussion here so as not to weary you.

As for the medicine of belief, it shows its effect when you carry out your 
religious obligations as far as is possible. Heedlessness, vice, the lusts of the 
soul, and illicit amusements reduce its effectiveness. Illness dispels heed-
lessness, cuts the appetites, is an obstacle to illicit pleasures, so take advan-
tage  of  it.  Make  use  of  the  sacred  medicines  and  lights  of  belief  through 
repentance and seeking forgiveness, and prayer and supplication.

May Almighty Allah restore you to health and make your illnesses atone-

ment for your sins. Amen. Amen. Amen.

The Twenty-Sixth Flash
Treatise for the Elderly 

[ This Flash consists of twenty-six hopes, lights, and solaces.1  ] 

REMINDER: The reason I have described my sorrows and afflic-
tions at the beginning of each Hope in a truly grievous way that will 
sadden you is in order to show the extraordinary efficaciousness of the 
remedies proceeding from the All-Wise Qur’an. This F l a s h , concern-
ing the elderly, has been unable to preserve its beauty of expression in 
three or four respects:

T h e   F i r s t :  It is about my life the events of which I revisited in my 
imagination; it was written in the state of mind of those times. It was 
not possible, therefore, to preserve an orderly arrangement in the way 
it is set out. 

T h e   S e c o n d :  It was written at a time I felt extreme fatigue, after 
the morning prayers, and I was also compelled to write it at speed; its 
manner of expression therefore became confused.

T h e   T h i r d :  There was not always someone with me to write, and 
the scribe who generally accompanied me had four or five other duties 
connected with the  R i s a l e - i   N u r . We therefore could not find suffi-
cient time to correct it and it remained in a disordered state.

T h e   F o u r t h :   We  were  both  tired  after  its  composition,  and  not 
thinking  carefully  of  the  meaning,  made  do  with  correcting  it  only 
superficially; so there are bound to be faults in the manner of expres-
sion. I request the generous elderly to look tolerantly on such errors 
and to include us in their prayers when they raise their hands to the 
divine  court,  since  divine  mercy  does  not  reject  the  prayers  of  the 
blessed elderly.

“ The  remaining  Hopes,  from  the  Fourteenth  to  the  Twenty-Sixth,  have  not  been  writ-
ten due to the well-known calamity ( Eskişehir Prison ); the time of writing them having 
passed now, it has remained without them. ” ( The Fourteenth to the Sixteenth were com-
posed subsequently. Tr. )

FIRST HOPE

Respected elderly brothers and sisters who have reached maturity! Like 
you, I am elderly. I am going to write the ‘hopes’ I have found in my old 
age and some of the things that have befallen me, out of the desire to share 
with you the lights of consolation they contain. Of course the lights I have 
seen and the doors of hope I have encountered have been seen and opened 
in accordance with my defective and confused abilities. Allah willing, your 
pure,  sincere  dispositions  will  make  those  lights  shine  more  brightly  and 
strengthen the hopes I have found.

Thus, the spring, source and fount of the following hopes and lights is 

belief in Allah.

SECOND HOPE

One day as I was entering upon old age, in the autumn at the time of the 
afternoon prayer, I was gazing on the world from a high mountain. Suddenly 
I was overwhelmed by a plaintive, sorrowful and in one respect dark state of 
mind. I saw that I had become old. The day too had grown old, and so had 
the year; so too had the world become old. As the time of departure from 
the world and separation from those I loved was drawing close within these 
instances of old age, my own old age shook me severely. Suddenly divine 
mercy unfolded in such a way that it transformed that plaintive sadness and 
separation into a powerful hope and shining light of solace. Yes, you who 
are elderly like myself! The All-Compassionate Creator presents himself to 
us in a hundred places in the All-Wise Qur’an as the Most Merciful of the 
Merciful, and always sends His mercy to the assistance of living creatures 
on  the  face  of  the  earth  who  seek  it,  and  every  year  fills  the  spring  with 
innumerable bounties and gifts from the Unseen, sending them to us who are 
needy for sustenance, and manifests His mercy in greater abundance rela-
tively to our weakness and impotence. For us in our old age, therefore, His 
mercy is our greatest hope and most powerful light. It may be obtained by 
forming a relation with the Most Merciful One through belief, and perform-
ing the five daily prayers, by being obedient to Him.

THE FLASHES

One time when I awoke in the morning of old age from the sleep of the 
night of youth I looked at myself and saw that my life was hastening towards 
the grave as though racing down a slope. As Niyazi Misri said:

E a c h   d a y   a   s t o n e   f r o m   t h e   b u i l d i n g   o f   m y   l i f e   f a l l s   t o   t h e   g r o u n d ;
H e e d l e s s   o n e !   Yo u   s l u m b e r,   u n a w a r e   t h a t   t h e   b u i l d i n g   i s   i n   r u i n s !

My body, my spirit’s dwelling, was becoming dilapidated with every day a 
stone of it falling away. My hopes and ambitions which bound me strongly 
to the world had begun to be broken off from it. I felt that the time I would 
be separated from my innumerable friends and those I loved was drawing 
near. I searched for a salve for that deep and apparently incurable spiritual 
wound, but I could not find one. Again like Niyazi Misri I said:

W h i l e   m y   h e a r t   d e s i r e d   i t s   i m m o r t a l i t y,   R e a l i t y   r e q u i r e d   t h e   p a s s i n g   o f  
m y   b o d y ;
I   a m   a f f l i c t e d   w i t h   a n   i n c u r a b l e   i l l ,   w h i c h   e v e n   L u q m a n   c o u l d   n o t   c u r e !  1
Then  suddenly  the  light  and  intercession  of  the  Glorious  Prophet 
( UWBP ), the tongue, model, exemplar, herald, and representative of divine 
compassion, and the gift of guidance he brought to mankind, soothed and 
healed the wound I had supposed to be incurable and endless. It transformed 
my dark despair into luminous hope.

Yes, respected elderly men and women who feel their old age like I do! 
We are departing, there is no use in deceiving ourselves. Even if we close 
our eyes to it, we will not remain here. There is a mobilization. The land of 
the Intermediate Realm, which appears to us to be dark and full of separation 
due to the gloomy delusions which arise from heedlessness and in part from 
the people of misguidance, is the meeting-place of friends. It is the world 
where we shall meet with foremost Allah’s Beloved ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ), and with all our friends.

We are going to the world of the one who every year for one thousand 
three hundred and fifty years has been the ruler of one thousand three hun-
dred and fifty million people, and the trainer of their spirits, the teacher of 
their minds, and the beloved of their hearts; to whose book of good works, 
in accordance with the meaning of “ the cause is like the doer, ” is every day 
added the equivalent of all the good works performed by his community; 

1.  That is to say, although with all its strength my heart wanted my body to be im-
mortal, divine wisdom necessitated its destruction. I was afflicted with an incurable ill for 
which even Luqman the Wise could find no solution.

who is the means by which the elevated divine purposes in the universe are 
accomplished and the high value of beings are realized. When he came into 
the world, according to authentic narrations and accurate divining of real-
ity,  he  exclaimed:  “ My  community!  My  community! ”  So  too  at  the  Last 
Judgement when everyone thinks only of themselves, he will again declare: 
“ My community! My community! ”, and with sacred, elevated self-sacrifice 
hasten with his intercession to its assistance. We are going to such a world, 
illuminated by the stars of countless saints and purified scholars revolving 
around that Sun ( UWBP ).

Thus, the way to share in that Being’s ( UWBP ) intercession and profit 
from his light, and be saved from the darkness of the Intermediate Realm, is 
to follow his glorious practices.

FOURTH HOPE

At the time I approached old age, my physical health, which perpetuates 
heedlessness, was broken. Old age and illness attacked me in concert. Hit-
ting me over the head, they chased away sleep. I had nothing to bind me to 
the world like family, children, and possessions. Having wasted the fruits of 
my life’s the capital on the giddiness of youth, I saw them to consist only of 
sins and mistakes. Crying out like Niyazi Misri, I said:

I   h a d   c o n c l u d e d   n o   t r a d e ;   t h e   c a p i t a l   o f   l i f e   w a s   a l l   l o s t ;
I   c a m e   t o   t h e   r o a d   t o   f i n d   t h e   c a r a v a n   h a d   m o v e d   o n ,   u n a w a r e .
L a m e n t i n g ,   I   c o n t i n u e d   d o w n   t h e   r o a d ,   a l l   a l o n e ,   a   s t r a n g e r ;
M y   e y e s   w e e p i n g ,   m y   h e a r t   i n   a n g u i s h ,   m y   m i n d   b e w i l d e r e d ,   u n a w a r e .
I was in exile at the time; I felt a despairing sorrow, a regretful penitence, 
a longing for assistance. Suddenly, the All-Wise Qur’an came to my aid. It 
opened a door of hope so powerful and afforded a light of consolation so true 
that  it  could  have  dispelled  despair  and  darknesses  a  hundred  times  more 
intense than mine.

Yes, respected elderly men and women whose attachment to the world 
has begun to be sundered and the ties binding them to be broken! Is it possi-
ble that the All-Glorious Maker who creates this world as a perfectly ordered 
city or palace would not speak with his most important guests and friends or 
not meet with them? Since He knowingly made the palace and ordered and 
adorned it through His will and choice, certainly as one who makes knows, 
so one who knows will speak. Since He made this palace and city into a fine 
guesthouse and place of trade for us, He will surely have a book, a file, to 
explain His relations with us and what He desires from us.

294

THE FLASHES

The most holy of such Books is the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition; it 
is a miracle in forty respects and is every instant on the tongues of at least a 
hundred million people; it scatters light, and every letter of it affords at least 
ten merits and rewards, and fruits of Paradise and lights in the Intermediate 
Realm, and sometimes ten thousand, and sometimes – through the mystery 
of the Night of Power – thirty thousand. There is no book in the universe to 
compete with it in this respect and no one could put one forward. Since this 
Qur’an which we have is the Word of the All-Glorious Creator of the heav-
ens and earth, proceeding from His absolute dominicality, the tremendous-
ness of His Godhead, and His all-encompassing mercy, and is His decree 
and a source of His mercy; adhere to it. In it are found a cure for every ill, 
a light for every darkness, and a hope for all despair. And the key to this 
eternal treasury is belief and submission to Allah, and listening to the Qur’an 
and accepting it, and reciting it.

FIFTH HOPE

One time at the start of my old age when I desired solitude, I retired to 
Yuşa Tepesi, Mount Joshua, away up the Istanbul Bosphorus. My spirit was 
seeking ease in loneliness. One day on that high hill, I gazed around me at 
the broad horizon. Awakened by old age I saw a truly sorrowful and distress-
ing picture. I cast a glance from the high position of the forty-fifth branch, 
that is, the forty-fifth year of the tree of my life to its lower levels. I saw 
that down on the lower branches of each year were the countless corpses of 
those I had known and had loved and with whom I had been connected. I 
felt a truly piteous sorrow at their parting and separation, I wept like Fuzuli 
Baghdadi for the friends from whom I was parted:

A s   I   r e c a l l   t h e i r   c o m p a n y   I   w e e p ,
S o   l o n g   a s   t h e r e   i s   b r e a t h   i n   t h i s   d r y   b o d y,   I   c r y   o u t .

I sought a solace, a light, a door leading to hope. Suddenly belief in the here-
after came to my assistance, shedding an inextinguishable light, offering an 
indestructible hope.

Yes, my brothers and sisters who are elderly like me! Since the hereafter 
exists and it is everlasting, and it is a better world than this; and since the 
One who created us is both All-Wise and All-Compassionate; we should not 
complain and regret our old age. On the contrary, we should be happy at it in 
so far as with age one reaches perfect maturity through worship and belief, 
and it is a sign one will be released from the duties of life and depart for the 
world of mercy in order to rest.

According to narrations, some relying on witnessing and some on ‘abso-
lute  certainty’,  mankind’s  most  eminent  individuals,  the  one  hundred  and 
twenty-four thousand prophets, 1 have unanimously given news of the exist-
ence of the hereafter, and that men will be sent there and the universe’s Cre-
ator will bring it about in accordance with His certain promise. Similarly, 
affirming through illumination and witnessing in the form of ‘certainty at 
the degree of knowledge’ the reports of the prophets, the one hundred and 
twenty-four  million  saints  have  testified  to  the  hereafter’s  existence.  And 
through the manifestations they display in this world, all the names of the 
universe’s All-Wise Maker self-evidently necessitate an everlasting realm. 
So  too  the  infinite  pre-eternal  power  and  the  boundless  eternal  wisdom 
which allowing nothing to be vain and purposeless every year in the spring, 
raise to life with the command of ( 36:83 ) ² ± the incalculable corpses 
of the dead trees on the face of the earth, making them manifest life after 
death,  and  revivify  three  hundred  thousand  species  of  plants  and  animals 
as thousands of samples of the resurrection of the dead. These observedly 
necessitate the existence of the hereafter, as does the eternal mercy and per-
petual favour which with perfect compassion and in wondrous fashion pro-
vide the livelihoods of all living beings needy for sustenance and in a brief 
time in spring display their uncountable sorts of adornment and decoration; 
they too necessitate the existence of the hereafter. Together with man, the 
most perfect fruit of the universe and its Creator’s most loved creature, who 
of all beings is the most closely concerned with the beings in the universe, 
and the clear indications and certain evidence of his intense, unshakeable, 
constant desire for immortality and his hopes which extend to eternity – all 
these prove so decisively that after this transient world there will be an eter-
nal world, a realm of the hereafter and everlasting happiness that they self-
evidently necessitate acceptance of the hereafter’s existence. 2

1.  M u s n a d , v, 266; Walī al-Dīn Tabrīzī, M i s h k ā t   a l - M a ṣ ā b ī ḥ , iii, 122; Ibn al-Qayyim

2.  The ease of reporting a definite matter and the difficulty in denying it may be seen 
in the following comparison: if one person says: “ There is a wondrous garden on earth 
whose trees produce fruits which are cans of milk, ” and another says: “ There isn’t, ” the 
one claiming it only has to point out where it is or some of its fruits in order to easily prove 
it. Whereas the one denying can only prove his denial by seeing and showing the whole 
face of the earth. In just the same way, even if one disregards the hundreds of thousands 
of signs, fruits, and marks of Paradise which those who give news of it have indicated, the 
testimony of two truthful witnesses to its certain existence is sufficient; while the one who 
denies it can only prove his denial after observing the infinite universe and infinite, un-
ending time, and seeing it and investigating it exhaustively; only then can he demonstrate 
its non-existence. And so, my elderly brothers, you may understand just how powerful is 
belief in the hereafter.

296

THE FLASHES

Since the most important thing the All-Wise Qur’an teaches us is belief 
in the hereafter, and since this belief is thus powerful and it yields such hope 
and solace that if a person was overwhelmed by old age a hundred thousand 
times over, the consolation arising from this belief would be sufficient to 
face it; for sure we elderly people should be happy with our old age and say: 
“ All praise be to Allah for perfect belief! ”

SIXTH HOPE

One  time  during  my  distressing  captivity,  I  was  alone  on  the  top  of 
Çamdağı, the Pine Mountain, in the mountains of Barla, having withdrawn 
from the company of men. I was searching for a light in my loneliness. One 
night on the small platform at the top of a tall pine tree on the summit of 
that high mountain, old age recalled to me three or four exiles, one within 
the other. As is described in the Sixth Letter, the melancholy sound of the 
rustling, murmuring trees on that lonely, silent night affected me grievously 
in my old age and exile. Old age gave me the following thought: like the 
day changed into this black grave and the world donned its black shroud, the 
daytime of your life, too, will turn into night, and the daytime of the world 
turn into the night of the Intermediate Realm, and summertime of life will 
be transformed into the winter nighttime of death. It whispered this in my 
heart’s ear. My soul was then obliged to say: 

Yes, I am far from my native land, but being separated from all those I 
have  loved  during  my  fifty  years’  lifetime  who  have  died,  and  remaining 
weeping for them, is a far more grievous and sorrowful exile than the exile 
from my country. Moreover, I am drawing close to a much sadder and more 
painful exile than the melancholy exile of the night and the mountain: old 
age informs me that I am approaching the time of separation from the world. 
I  then  sought  a  light,  a  hope  from  these  sorrowful  exiles  one  within  the 
other. Suddenly belief in Allah came to my assistance and afforded such a 
familiarity that even if the compounded desolation in which I found myself 
increased a thousandfold, its consolation would have been sufficient.

Elderly men and women! Since we have a Compassionate Creator, there 
can be no exile for us! Since He exists, everything exists for us. Since He 
exists,  the  angels  exist.  The  world  is  not  empty.  Lonely  mountains  and 
empty deserts are full of Almighty Allah’s servants. Apart from His con-
scious  servants,  stones  and  trees  become  like  familiar  friends  when  seen 
through His light and on His account. They may converse with us and give 
us enjoyment.

TWENTY-SIXTH FLASH

297

Yes,  evidences  and  witnesses  to  the  number  of  beings  in  the  universe 
and to the number of the letters of this vast book of the world testify to the 
existence of our All-Compassionate, Munificent, Intimate, Loving Creator, 
Maker, and Protector; they show us His mercy to the number of living crea-
tures’ members, foods, and bounties, which may be a means of receiving 
His compassion, mercy, and favour, and indicate His court. Impotence and 
weakness are the most acceptable intercessor at His court. And old age is 
precisely the time of impotence and weakness. So one should not feel resent-
ful at old age, which is thus an acceptable intercessor at a court, but love it.

SEVENTH HOPE

One time at the start of my old age when the laughter of the Old Said was 
being transformed into the weeping of the New Said, supposing me still to 
be the Old Said, the worldly in Ankara invited me there, and I went. At the 
close of autumn I climbed to the top of the citadel, which was far more aged, 
dilapidated, and worn out than me. It seemed to me to be formed of petri-
fied historical events. The old age of the season of the year together with my 
old age, the citadel’s old age, mankind’s old age, the old age of the glorious 
Ottoman Empire, and the death of the Caliphate’s rule, and the world’s old 
age all caused me to look in a most grieved, piteous and melancholy state in 
that lofty citadel at the valleys of the past and the mountains of the future. As 
I experienced an utterly black state of mind in Ankara encompassed by four 
or five layers of the darknesses of old age one within the other, 1 I sought a 
light, a solace, a hope.

As I sought consolation looking to the right, that is, to the past, my father 
and forefathers and the human race appeared in the form of a vast grave and 
filled me with gloom rather than consoling me. Seeking a remedy I looked to 
the future, which was to my left. I saw that it appeared as a huge, dark grave 
for myself, my contemporaries, and future generations; it produced horror in 
place of familiarity. Feeling desolate in the face of the left and right, I looked 
at the present day. It appeared to my heedless, historical eye as a coffin bear-
ing my half-dead, suffering and desperately struggling corpse. So despairing 
of that direction too, I raised my head and looked at the top of the tree of my 
life, and there was my corpse; it stood at the top of the tree and was watch-
ing me. Feeling horror at this direction, too, I bowed my head. I looked to 
the foot of the tree of my life, to its roots, and saw that the soil there, the 
earth which was the source of my creation and the dust of my bones mixed 

1.  My state of mind at that time prompted me to write a supplication in Persian. It was 

printed in Ankara, in a treatise entitled, H u b a b .

together, was being trampled underfoot. That was no remedy, it only added 
further pain to my affliction.

Then I was forced to look behind me. I saw that this unstable, transient 
world was tumbling, disappearing, into the valleys of nothingness and the 
darkness  of  non-existence.  I  was  seeking  a  salve  for  my  pain,  but  it  only 
added poison. Since I could see no good in that direction I looked in front 
of me, I sent my view forward to the future. I saw that the door of the grave 
was open right in the middle of my path; it was watching me with its mouth 
agape.  The  highway  beyond  it  which  stretched  away  to  eternity,  and  the 
convoys travelling that highway, struck the eye from the distance. But apart 
from a limited will as my support and defensive weapon in the face of the 
horrors coming from these six directions, I had nothing.

The faculty of will, man’s only weapon against those innumerable ene-
mies and endless harmful things, is both defective, and short, and weak, and 
lacks the power to create, so he is capable of nothing apart from ‘acquisi-
tion.’ It could neither pass to the past in order to silence the sorrows which 
came to me from there, nor could it penetrate the future to prevent the fears 
which arose from there. I saw that it was of no benefit for my hopes and 
pains concerning the past and future. 

As I was struggling in the horror, desolation, darkness and despair pro-
ceeding from these six directions, the lights of belief which shine in the sky 
of  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  suddenly  came  to  my  assistance. 
They lit up and illuminated those six directions to such a degree that if the 
terrors and darkness I had seen increased a hundredfold, the light would still 
have been sufficient to meet them. One by one it transformed all those hor-
rors into solace and the desolation into familiarity. It was as follows:

Belief  rent  asunder  the  desolate  view  of  the  past  as  a  vast  grave,  and 
showed  it  with  utter  certainty  to  be  a  familiar,  enlightened  gathering  of 
friends.

And belief showed the future, which had appeared in the form of a huge 
grave to my heedless eyes, to be most certainly a banquet of the Most Merci-
ful One in delightful palaces of bliss.

And belief rent the view of present time as a coffin, as it had appeared to 
my heedless view, and showed it with certainty to be a place of trade for the 
hereafter and a glittering guesthouse of the All-Merciful One.

And belief showed with utter certainty that the only fruit at the top of the 
tree of life was not a corpse as had appeared to my neglectful eye, but that 

TWENTY-SIXTH FLASH

299

my spirit, which would manifest eternal life and was designated for eternal 
happiness, would leave its worn-out home to travel around the stars.

And through its mystery, belief showed that my bones and the earth that 
was the source of my creation were not valueless pulverized bones trampled 
underfoot, but that the earth was the door to divine mercy and veil before the 
halls of Paradise.

And  through  the  mystery  of  the  Qur’an,  belief  showed  that  the  world 
which had appeared to my heedless eye as tumbling behind me into noth-
ingness and non-existence to consist of missives of the Eternally Besought 
One and pages of decorations and embroideries glorifying Allah which had 
completed their duties, stated their meanings, and left their results in exist-
ence in their place. It made known with complete certainty the true nature 
of the world.

And through the light of the Qur’an, belief showed that the grave which 
would open its eyes and look at me in the future was not the mouth of a well, 
but that it was the door to the world of light, and that the highway which 
stretched to eternity beyond it led not to nothingness and non-existence, but 
to existence, a realm of light, and eternal bliss. Since belief demonstrated 
this to a degree which afforded utter conviction, it was both a remedy and a 
salve for my afflictions.

And in place of a very minor ability to receive, belief puts a document 
into the hand of the limited faculty of will through which it may rely on an 
infinite power and be connected to a boundless mercy in the face of those 
innumerable enemies and layers of darkness. Indeed, belief is a document in 
the hand of man’s will, and although this human weapon of will is in itself 
both short, powerless, and deficient, just as when a soldier utilizes his partial 
strength on account of the state, he performs duties far exceeding his own 
strength, so too through the mystery of belief, if the limited faculty of will 
is used in the name of Almighty Allah and in His way, it may gain also a 
paradise as broad as five hundred years.

And belief takes from the hands of the body the reins of the faculty of 
will, which cannot penetrate to the past and future, and hands them over to 
the heart and spirit. Since the sphere of their life is not restricted to present 
time like the body, and included within it are a great many years from the 
past and a great many years from the future, the will ceases being limited 
and  acquires  universality.  Through  the  strength  of  belief  it  may  enter  the 
deepest valleys of the past and repel the darkness of its sorrows; so too with 
the light of belief it may rise as far as the farthest mountains of the future, 
and remove its fears.

THE FLASHES

My elderly brothers and sisters who are suffering the difficulties of old 
age like myself! Since, praise be to Allah, we are believers, and in belief are 
found this many luminous, pleasurable, agreeable, and gratifying treasures; 
and since our old age impels us even more to the contents of the treasure, 
for sure, rather than complaining about old age accompanied by belief, we 
should offer endless thanks.

EIGHTH HOPE

At a time grey hairs, the sign of old age, were appearing in my hair, the 
turmoil  of  the  First  World  War,  which  made  even  heavier  the  deep  sleep 
of  youth,  the  upheaval  of  my  captivity  as  a  prisoner-of-war,  the  position 
of great fame and honour accorded to me on my return to Istanbul, and the 
kind treatment and attention far exceeding my due I received from everyone, 
from  the  Caliph,  even,  Shaykh  al-Islam,  and  Commander-in-Chief  of  the 
Army to the students of religion, the intoxication of youth, and the mental 
state produced by my position all made the sleep of youth so heavy that I 
quite simply saw the world as permanent and myself in a wonderful undying 
situation cemented to it.

Then one day in Ramadan I went to Bayezid Mosque to listen to the sin-
cere Qur’an reciters. With their tongues, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposi-
tion was proclaiming with its exalted heavenly address the decree of:

( 21:35 ) Ï Î Í Ì
which powerfully gives news of man’s death and that of all animate crea-
tures. It entered my ear, penetrated to the depths of my heart and established 
itself there; it shattered my profound sleep and heedlessness. I went out of 
the mosque. Because of the stupor of the sleep which for a long time had 
settled in my head, for several days a tempest raged in it, and I saw myself 
as a boat with smoking boilers and compass spinning. Every time I looked at 
my hair in the mirror, the grey hairs told me: “ Take note of us! ” And so the 
situation became clear through the warnings of my grey hairs.

I looked and saw that my youth which so captivated me with its pleasures 
and  in  which  I  so  trusted  was  bidding  me  farewell,  and  that  this  worldly 
life which I so loved and with which I was so involved was beginning to 
be extinguished, and that the world with which I was closely connected and 
of  which  I  was  quite  simply  the  lover  was  saying  to  me:  “ Have  a  good 
journey! ”, and was warning me that I would be leaving this guesthouse. It 
too  was  saying  “ Good-bye, ”  and  was  preparing  to  depart.  The  following 

TWENTY-SIXTH FLASH

301

meaning was unfolding in my heart from the indications of the Qur’an of 
Miraculous Exposition’s verse,

  Ï Î Í Ì
the human race is a living creature; it shall die in order to be resurrected. The 
globe of the earth is a living creature; it also will die in order to take on an 
eternal form. The world too is a living creature; it will die in order to assume 
the form of the hereafter.

While in this state, I considered my situation. I saw that youth, which is 
the source of pleasure, was departing; while old age, the source of sorrow, 
was approaching; that life, which is so shining and luminous, was taking its 
leave; while death, which is terrifying and apparently darkness, was prepar-
ing to arrive; and that the lovable world, which is thought to be permanent 
and is the beloved of the heedless, was hastening to its decease.

In order to deceive myself and again plunge my head into heedlessness I 
considered the pleasures of the social standing I enjoyed in Istanbul, which 
was far higher than I deserved, but there was no advantage in it at all. All 
the regard, attention, and consolation of people could only accompany me as 
far as the looming door of the grave; there it would be extinguished. Since 
I saw it to be a tedious hypocrisy, cold conceit, and temporary stupefaction 
under the embellished veil of glory and renown, which is the goal and dream 
of those who chase fame, I understood that these things which had until then 
deceived me could provide me with no solace, there was no light to be found 
in them at all.

I again started to listen to the reciters in Bayezid Mosque in order to hear 
the Qur’an’s heavenly teaching, and to awaken once more. From its sublime 
instruction I heard good news through sacred decrees of the sort,

( 2:25 ) ....# " !
With its effulgence, I sought consolation, hope, and light, within the points 
at which I had felt horror, desolation and despair, not outside them. Endless 
thanks  be  to  Almighty  Allah,  I  found  the  cure  within  the  malady  itself,  I 
found the light within the darkness itself, I found the solace within the hor-
ror itself.

Firstly, I looked in the face of death, which is imagined to be most terrible 
and terrifies everyone. Through the light of the Qur’an I saw that although 
its  veil  is  black,  dark,  and  ugly,  for  believers  its  true  face  is  luminous 

302

and  beautiful.  We  have  proved  this  truth  decisively  in  many  parts  of  the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r .  For  example,  as  we  explained  in  the  Eighth  Word  and  the 
Twentieth Letter, death is not annihilation and separation, but the introduc-
tion  to  eternal  life,  its  beginning.  It  is  a  rest  from  the  hardships  of  life’s 
duties, a demobilization. It is a change of residence. It is to meet with the 
caravan  of  one’s  friends  who  have  already  migrated  to  the  Intermediate 
World; and so on. I saw death’s true, beautiful face through truths like these. 
I looked at death’s face not with fear, but with a sort of longing. I understood 
one meaning of the Sufis’ contemplation of death.

Then  I  considered  my  departed  youth  –  youth,  which  makes  everyone 
weep on its passing, which infatuates them and fills them with desire, caus-
ing them to pass it in sin and heedlessness. I saw that within its beautiful 
embroidered garb was an ugly, drunken, stupified face. Had I not learnt its 
true nature, it would have made me weep for a hundred years if I remained in 
the world that long, instead of intoxicating and amusing me for a few years. 
Just as one such person said lamenting: 

ُب(cid:193) ِ(cid:131) َ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)ا  َلَ(cid:151)َ(cid:158) ا َ(cid:175)ِ(cid:92) ُهَرِ(cid:93)ْ(cid:114)ُاَ(cid:158)    اً(cid:174)ْوَ(cid:192) ُدوُ(cid:151)َ(cid:192)  َباَ(cid:93) َ

ّ(cid:131)(cid:170)ا  َتْ(cid:193)َ(cid:170)

Indeed, elderly people like the above who do not know the true nature 
of youth, think of their own youth, and weep with regret and longing. But 
when youth belongs to believers with sound minds and hearts who are aware 
of the divine presence, it is a most powerful, agreeable and pleasant means 
of securing good works and trade for the hereafter, so long as they spend it 
on worship, and that trade and those good works. For those who know their 
religious duties and do not misspend their youth, it is a precious and delight-
ful divine bounty. But when it is not spent in moderation, uprightness, and 
fear of Allah, it contains many dangers; with its excesses it damages eternal 
happiness and the life of the hereafter, indeed, it ruins the life of this world 
too. It causes many years of grief and sorrow in old age in return for the 
pleasures of one or two years’ youth.

Since for most people youth is harmful, we elderly people should thank 
Allah that we have been saved from its dangers and harm. Like everything 
else, the pleasures of youth depart. If they have been spent on worship and 
good works, the fruits of such a youth remain perpetually in their place and 
are the means of gaining youth in eternal life.

Next, I considered the world, with which most people are infatuated and 
to which they are addicted. Through the light of the Qur’an, I saw that it has 
three faces, one within the other:

TWENTY-SIXTH FLASH

T h e   F i r s t  looks to the divine names; it is a mirror to them
I t s   S e c o n d   F a c e  looks to the hereafter, and is its tillage.
I t s   T h i r d   F a c e  looks to the worldly; it is the playground of the heedless.
Moreover, everyone has his own vast world within this world. Simply, 
there are worlds one within the other to the number of human beings. The 
pillar of each person’s private world is his own life. When his body gives 
way,  his  world  collapses  on  his  head,  it  is  doomsday  for  him.  Since  the 
heedless  and  neglectful  do  not  realize  that  their  world  will  be  so  quickly 
destroyed, they suppose it to be permanent like the general world and wor-
ship it. I thought to myself: “ I too have a private world that will swiftly col-
lapse and be demolished like the worlds of other people. What value is there 
in this private world, this brief life of mine? ”

Then, through the light of the Qur’an, I saw that both for myself and eve-
ryone else, this world is a temporary place of trade, a guest house which is 
every day filled and emptied, a market set up on the road for the passers-by 
to shop in, an ever-renewed notebook of the Pre-Eternal Inscriber which 
is  constantly  written  and  erased,  and  every  spring  is  a  gilded  letter,  and 
every summer a well-composed ode; that it is formed of mirrors reflect-
ing and renewing the manifestations of the All-Glorious Maker’s names; 
is a seedbed of the hereafter, a flower-bed of divine mercy, and a special, 
temporary workshop for producing signboards which will be displayed in 
the world of eternity.

I  offered  a  hundred  thousand  thanks  to  the  All-Glorious  Creator  who 
had made the world in this way. And I understood that while love for the 
beautiful,  inner  faces  of  the  world  which  look  to  the  hereafter  and  divine 
names had been given to mankind, since they misused it and spent it on its 
transient, ugly, harmful, heedless face, they manifested the meaning of the

Elderly  people!  I  realized  this  truth  through  the  light  of  the  All-Wise 
Qur’an, and the warnings of my old age, and belief opening my eyes. And 
I have demonstrated it with decisive proofs in many places in the R i s a l e - i

thankful for my old age, and I was happy that my youth had gone. You too 
do not weep, but offer thanks. Since there is belief and the truth is thus, it 
should be the heedless who weep and the misguided who lament.

NINTH HOPE

THE FLASHES

In the First World War, as a prisoner, I was in the distant province of 
Kosturma in north-eastern Russia. There was a small mosque belonging to 
the Tatars beside the famous River Volga. I used to become wearied among 
my friends, the other officers. I craved solitude, yet I could not wander about 
outside without permission. Then they took me on bail to the Tatar quarter, 
to that small mosque on the banks of the Volga. I used to sleep there, alone. 
Spring was close. I used to be very wakeful during the long, long nights of 
that northern land; the sad plashing of the Volga and the mirthless patter of 
the rain and the melancholy sighing of the wind of those dark nights in that 
dark exile had temporarily roused me from a deep sleep of heedlessness. I 
did not yet consider myself old, but those who had experienced the Great 
War were old. For those were days that, as though manifesting the verse: 

( 73:17 ) ½ ¼ » º
made  even  children  old.  While  I  was  forty  years  old,  I  felt  myself  to  be 
eighty. In those long, dark nights and sorrowful exile and melancholic state, 
I despaired of life and of my homeland. I looked at my powerlessness and 
aloneness, and my hope failed.

Then, while in that state, succour arrived from the All-Wise Qur’an; my 

tongue said: 

( 3:173 ) Ø × Ö Õ 

And weeping, my heart cried out: 

(cid:295)َ(cid:281)(cid:315) ِ(cid:273) َ(cid:260)

And, thinking of my old friends in my homeland, and imagining myself

dying in exile there, like Niyazi Misri, my spirit poured forth these lines:

C r y i n g   w i t h   e a c h   b r e a t h ,   F r i e n d !   F r i e n d !

It was searching for its friends.

Anyway, my weakness and impotence became such potent intercessors 
and means at the divine court on that melancholy, pitiful, separation-afflicted,

long  night  in  exile  that  now  I  still  wonder  at  it.  For  several  days  later  I 
escaped in the most unexpected manner, on my own, not knowing Russian, 
across a distance that would have taken a year on foot. I was saved in a won-
drous fashion through divine favour, which was bestowed as a consequence 
of my weakness and impotence. Then, passing through Warsaw and Austria, 
I reached Istanbul, so that to be saved in this way so easily was quite extraor-
dinary. I completed the long flight with an ease and facility that even the 
boldest and most cunning Russian-speakers could not have accomplished.

That  night  in  the  mosque  on  the  banks  of  the  Volga  made  me  decide 
to  pass  the  rest  of  my  life  in  caves.  Enough  now  of  mixing  in  this  social 
life of people. Since finally I would enter the grave alone, I said that from 
now on I would choose solitude in order to become accustomed to it. But 
regretfully, things of no consequence like my many and serious friends in 
Istanbul, and the glittering worldly life there, and in particular the fame and 
honour accorded me, which were far greater than my due, made me tempo-
rarily forget my decision. It was as though that night in exile was a luminous 
blackness in my life’s eye, and the glittering white daytime of Istanbul, a 
lightless white in it. It could not see ahead, it still slumbered. Until two years 
later, Ghawth al-Geylani opened my eyes once more with his book  F u t ū ḥ  
a l - G h a y b .

O elderly men and women! Know that the weakness and powerlessness 
of old age are means for attracting divine grace and mercy. The manifesta-
tion of mercy on the face of the earth demonstrates this truth in the clearest 
fashion, just as I have observed it in myself on numerous occasions. For the 
weakest and most powerless of animals are the young. But then it is they 
who receive the sweetest and most beautiful manifestation of mercy. The 
powerlessness  of  a  young  bird  in  the  nest  at  the  top  of  a  tree  attracts  the 
manifestation  of  mercy  to  employ  its  mother  like  an  obedient  soldier.  Its 
mother flies all around and brings it its food. When with its wings growing 
strong the nestling forgets its impotence, its mother tells it to go and find its 
own food, and no longer listens to it.

Just as this mystery of mercy is in force for the young, so is it in force 
for the elderly, who resemble young in regard to weakness and impotence. 
I have had experiences which have led me to form the unshakeable convic-
tion that just as the sustenance of infants is sent to them in wondrous fashion 
by divine mercy on account of their impotence, being made to flow forth 
from the springs of breasts; so too the sustenance of believing elderly, who 
acquire innocence, is sent in the form of plenty. This truth is also proved 

306

by  the  Hadith  which  says: اً

It states both that a household’s source of plenty is its elderly inhabitants, 
and that it is the elderly that preserve the household from the visitation of 
calamities.

Since  the  weakness  and  impotence  of  old  age  are  thus  the  means  of 

attracting divine mercy to this extent; and since with its verses:

 } | { z y x w v u t s r q p
« ª © ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ £ * ¡ ﮯ ~
( 17:23-24 ) ¯ ® ¬ 
the All-Wise Qur’an summons children most miraculously in five ways to 
be kind and respectful towards their elderly parents; and since the religion 
of Islam commands respect and compassion towards the elderly; and since 
human nature also requires respect and compassion towards the aged; we 
elderly people certainly receive significant, constant mercy and respect from 
divine grace and human feeling in place of the fleeting physical pleasures 
and appetites of youth, as well as the spiritual pleasures arising from respect 
and compassion. Since this is the case, we would not exchange this old age 
of ours for a hundred youths. Yes, I can tell you certainly that even if they 
were to give me ten years of the Old Said’s youth, I would not give one year 
of the New Said’s old age. I am content with my old age, and you too should 
be content with yours!

TENTH HOPE

For a year or two in Istanbul after returning from being held as a prisoner-
of-war, I was overcome by heedlessness. The politics of the day directed my 
attention away from myself and scattered it on the outside world. Then one 
day I was sitting on a high spot overlooking the valley of the Eyüb Sultan 
graveyard  in  Istanbul  when  I  was  overcome  by  a  state  of  mind  in  which, 
while I was looking down on it, it seemed my private world was dying and 
my spirit was withdrawing. I said: “ I wonder if it’s the inscriptions on the 
gravestones that are giving me such illusions? ”, and I drew back my gaze. 
I looked not at the distance, but at the graveyard. Then the following was 
imparted to my heart: “ This graveyard around you holds Istanbul a hundred

times over, for Istanbul has been emptied here a hundred times. You can-
not escape from the command of the All-Wise and Powerful One who has 
poured all the people of Istanbul into here; you are no exception; you too 
will depart. ”

I left the graveyard and with those awesome thoughts entered a small cell 
in Sultan Eyüb Mosque where I had stayed many times before. I thought to 
myself, I am a guest in three respects: I am a guest in this tiny room, I am 
also a guest in Istanbul, and a guest in this world. A guest has to think of the 
road. Just as I shall leave this room, so one day I shall leave Istanbul, and yet 
another day I shall depart from this world.

While in this state of mind, I, my heart, was overwhelmed by a most piti-
ful, grievous sorrow. I was not losing only one or two friends; I would be 
parted from the thousands of people I loved in Istanbul, and I would also part 
from Istanbul, which I also loved much. And just as I would be parted from 
hundreds of thousands of friends in this world, so I would leave the beauti-
ful world, with which I was captivated and I loved. While pondering over 
this, I climbed once more to that spot in the graveyard. I had been to the cin-
ema from time to time to take lessons, and just then all the dead of Istanbul 
appeared to me to be walking around, like the cinema shows in the present 
the images of the past. And all the people I could see at that time appeared 
to be corpses walking around. I told my imagination: some of the dead in the 
graveyard appear to be walking around as though on the cinema-screen, so 
you should see the people of the present, who are bound to enter the grave-
yard in the future, as having entered it; they too are corpses, walking around.
Suddenly  through  the  light  of  the  Qur’an  and  through  the  guidance  of 
Ghawth al-A‘zam, Shaykh Geylani, my grievous state was transformed into 
a joyful one. It was like this:

The  light  proceeding  from  the  Qur’an  gave  me  the  following  thought: 
you had one or two officer friends while a prisoner-of-war in exile in Kos-
turma in the north-east. You knew that they would in any event go to Istan-
bul. If one of them had asked you: “ Do you want to go to Istanbul, or to 
stay here? ” For sure if you had had a jot of intelligence, you would joyfully 
have chosen to go to Istanbul. For out of a thousand and one friends, nine 
hundred and ninety-nine were already in Istanbul. Only one or two remained 
there, and they too would leave. Going to Istanbul for you would not be a sad 
departure and sorrowful separation. Moreover you have come here and were 
you not happy to do so? You were delivered from the long, dark nights and 
cold, stormy winters in that enemy country. You came to Istanbul, a worldly 
paradise.

THE FLASHES

In just the same way, from your childhood to your present age, ninety-
nine  out  of  a  hundred  of  those  you  love  have  migrated  to  the  graveyard, 
which terrifies you. You have one or two friends still in this world, and they 
too will depart. Your death in this world is not separation; it is union; it is 
to be reunited with all those friends. I was reminded that they, that is those 
immortal spirits, have left behind under the earth their worn-out dwellings, 
and some of them are travelling about the stars and some in the levels of the 
Intermediate Realm.

Yes, the Qur’an and belief proved this truth so certainly that you should 
believe it as though seeing it if you are not entirely lacking heart and spirit, 
and misguidance has not suffocated your heart. For most certainly and self-
evidently the All-Generous Maker who adorns this world with innumerable 
sorts of gifts and bounties, and demonstrates His dominicality munificently 
and  compassionately,  and  preserves  even  the  least  significant  things  like 
seeds, would not annihilate or send to nothingness or waste man as unkindly 
and purposelessly as it superficially appears, for he is the most perfect, com-
prehensive,  important,  and  beloved  among  His  creatures.  Rather,  like  the 
seeds a farmer scatters on the earth, the Compassionate Creator temporar-
ily casts that beloved creature of His under the ground, which is a door of 
mercy, in order to produce shoots in another life. 1

After receiving this reminder of the Qur’an, the graveyard became more 
familiar to me than Istanbul. Solitude and retirement became more pleasur-
able to me than conversation and company, and I found a place of seclu-
sion for myself in Sarıyer on the Bosphorus. There, Ghawth al-A‘zam ( May 
Allah be pleased with him ) became a master, doctor, and guide for me with 
his F u t ū ḥ   a l - G h a y b , while Imam Rabbani ( May Allah be pleased with him ) 
became  a  companion,  sympathetic  friend,  and  teacher  with  his  M a k t ū b ā t  
( Letters ). Then I was extremely happy I had approached old age, withdrawn 
from civilization, and slipped free of social life. I thanked Allah.

O respected persons who have entered upon old age and who frequently 
recall death through its warnings! In accordance with the light of the teach-
ings of belief taught by the Qur’an, we should look favourably on old age, 
death,  and  illness,  and  even  love  them  in  one  respect.  Since  we  have  an 
infinitely precious bounty like belief, old age, and illness, and death are all 
agreeable. If there are things that are disagreeable, they are sin, vice, innova-
tions, and misguidance.

1.  This truth has been proved as clearly as twice two equals four in other parts of the 

Risale-i Nur, and especially in the Tenth and Twenty-Ninth Words.

ELEVENTH HOPE

309

After my return from captivity, I was living together with my nephew 
Abdurrahman 1 in a villa on the hill at Çamlıca in Istanbul. From the point 
of view of worldly life, my situation could have been thought to be the most 
fortunate  for  people  like  us.  For  I  had  been  saved  from  being  a  prisoner-
of-war and in the Darü’l-Hikmet we were being successful in propagating 
knowledge in an elevated way suitably to my profession, the learned profes-
sion. The honour and esteem afforded me were far greater than my due. I 
was living in Çamlıca, the most beautiful place in Istanbul. Everything was 
perfect for me. I was together with the late Abdurrahman, my nephew, who 
was extremely intelligent and self-sacrificing, and was both my student, and 
servant, and scribe, and spiritual son. But then, knowing myself to be more 
fortunate than anyone else in the world, I looked in the mirror and I saw grey 
hairs in my hair and beard.

Suddenly,  the  spiritual  awakening  I  had  experienced  in  the  mosque  in 
Kosturma  while  in  captivity  recommenced.  I  began  to  study  the  circum-
stances and causes to which I felt geniune attachment and which I supposed 
were the source of happiness in this world. But whichever of them I studied, 
I saw that it was rotten; it was not worth the attachment; it was deceptive. 
Around  that  time,  I  suffered  an  unexpected  and  unimaginable  act  of  dis-
loyalty  and  unfaithfulness  at  the  hands  of  a  friend  whom  I  had  supposed 
to be most loyal. I felt disgust at the world. I said to myself: “ Have I been 
altogether deceived? I see that many people look with envy at our situation, 
which in reality should be pitied. Are all these people crazy, or is it me that 
has gone crazy so that I see all these worldly people as such? ”

Anyway,  as  a  result  of  this  severe  awakening  caused  me  by  old  age, 
first  of  all  I  saw  the  transitoriness  of  all  the  ephemeral  things  to  which 
I  was  attached.  Then  I  looked  at  myself,  and  I  saw  myself  to  be  utterly 
impotent. So then my spirit declared, which desires immortality and was 
infatuated with ephemeral beings imagining them to be immortal: “ Since I 
am a transient being with regard to my body, what good can come of these 
ephemeral things? Since I am powerless, what can I await from these pow-
erless things? What I need is one who is Eternal and Enduring, one who 
is Pre-Eternal and All-Powerful, who will provide a remedy for my ills. ” 
And I began to search.

1.  Abdurrahman was the son of Bediuzzaman’s elder brother, ‘Abdullah. He was born 
in Nurs in 1903, and was Bediuzzaman’s spiritual son, student, and assistant. He joined his 
uncle in Istanbul after the First World War, and published a short biography of him at that 
time. He died in Ankara in 1928, where he is buried. ( Tr. )

THE FLASHES

Then, before everything, I had recourse to the learning I had studied of 
old,  I  began  to  search  for  a  consolation,  a  hope.  But  unfortunately,  up  to 
that time I had filled my mind with the sciences of philosophy as well as 
the  Islamic  sciences,  and  quite  in  error  had  imagined  those  philosophical 
sciences to be the source of progress and means of illumination. However, 
those philosophical matters had greatly dirtied my spirit and been an obsta-
cle to my spiritual development. Suddenly, through Almighty Allah’s mercy 
and  munificence,  the  sacred  wisdom  of  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  came  to  my 
assistance. As is explained in many parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , it washed away 
and cleansed the dirt of those philosophical matters.

For instance, the spiritual darknesses arising from science and philoso-
phy plunged my spirit into the universe. Whichever way I looked seeking 
a light, I could find not a gleam in those matters, I could not breathe. And 
so it continued until the instruction in divine unity given by the phrase from 
the All-Wise Qur’an “ There is no god but He ” dispersed all those layers of 
darkness with its brilliant light, and I could breathe with ease. But relying 
on what they had learnt from the people of misguidance and philosophers, 
my soul and Satan attacked my reason and my heart. All thanks be to Allah, 
the ensuing debate with my soul resulted in the victory of my heart. Those 
exchanges  have  been  described  in  part  in  many  parts  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r . 
So deeming them to be sufficient, here I shall explain only one proof out of 
thousands in order to show one thousandth part of that victory of the heart. 
In this way it may also cleanse the spirits of certain elderly people which 
have been dirtied in their youth, and their hearts sickened and souls spoilt, 
by matters which though called Western philosophy or the sciences of civi-
lization, are in part misguidance and in part trivia. And through divine unity, 
they may be saved from evil of Satan and the soul. It is as follows:

My soul said in the name of science and philosophy: “ According to the 
nature of things, the beings in the universe intervene in other beings. Every-
thing looks to a cause. The fruit has to be sought from the tree and seed from 
the soil. So what does it mean to seek the tiniest and least insignificant thing 
from Allah and to beseech Him for it? ”

Through the light of the Qur’an, the meaning of divine unity then unfolded 
in the following way: like the greatest thing, the tiniest and most particular 
proceeds directly from the power of the Creator of the whole universe and 
emerges from His treasury. It cannot occur in any other way. As for causes, 
they are merely a veil. For in regard to art and creation, sometimes the crea-
tures we suppose to be the smallest and least important are greater than the 

TWENTY-SIXTH FLASH

311

largest creatures. Even if a fly is not of greater art than a chicken, it is not of 
lesser art. In which case, no difference should be made between great and 
small. Either all should be divided between material causes, or all should be 
attributed at once to a single Being. And just as the former is impossible, the 
latter is necessary and imperative.

For  if  beings  are  attributed  to  a  single  Being,  that  is  to  a  Pre-Eternal 
All-Powerful One, since His knowledge, the existence of which is certain 
by reason of the order and wisdom in all beings, encompasses everything; 
and  since  the  measure  of  all  things  is  determined  in  His  knowledge;  and 
since observedly beings which are infinitely full of art continuously come 
into existence from nothing with infinite ease; and since in accordance with 
innumerable  powerful  evidences  that  All-Knowing  All-Powerful  One  is 
able  to  create  anything  whatever  through  the  command  of  “   ‘ B e ! ’  a n d  
i t  
i s   ”  as simply as striking a match, and as is explained in many parts of the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  and proved particularly in the Twentieth Letter and at the end 
of the Twenty-Third Flash, He possesses unlimited power – since this is the 
case, the extraordinary ease and facility which we observe arises from that 
all-encompassing knowledge and vast power.

For example, if a special solution is applied to a book written in invisible 
ink, that huge book suddenly demonstrates its existence visibly and makes 
itself read. In just the same way, the particular form and appointed measure 
of everything is determined in the all-encompassing knowledge of the Pre-
Eternal All-Powerful One. Through the command of “ ‘ B e ! ’  a n d   i t   i s  ” and 
with that limitless power of His and penetrating will, like spreading the solu-
tion on the writing, the Absolutely All-Powerful One applies a manifestation 
of His power to the being which exists as knowledge and with utter ease and 
facility gives it external existence; He displays and makes read the embroi-
deries of His wisdom.

If all things are not all together attributed to that Pre-Eternal All-Power-
ful One, the One Knowing of All Things, then as well as having to gather 
together in a particular measure from most of the varieties of beings in the 
world the body of the tiniest thing like a fly, the particles which work in that 
tiny fly’s body will have to know the mysteries of the fly’s creation and its 
perfect art in all its minutest details. For as all the intelligent agree, natural 
causes and physical causes cannot create out of nothing. In which case, if 
they do create, they will gather the being together. And since they will gather 
it together – whatever animate being it is, there are within it samples of most 
of the elements and most of the varieties of beings, for living creatures are

quite simply like a seed or essence of the universe – it will of course be nec-
essary for them to gather together a seed from the whole tree and an animate 
being from the whole face of the earth sifting them through a fine sieve and 
measuring them with the most sensitive balance. And since natural causes 
are ignorant and lifeless, and have no knowledge with which to determine 
a plan, index, model, or programme according to which they can smelt and 
pour the particles which enter the immaterial mould of the being in ques-
tion, so they do not disperse and spoil its order, it is clear how far it is from 
possibility and reason to suppose that, without mould or measure, they can 
make the particles of the elements which flow like floods remain one on the 
other in the form of an orderly mass without dispersing, for everything has 
a single form and measure amid possibilities without calculation or count. 
For sure, everyone who does not suffer from blindness in his heart will see 
it. Yes, in consequence of this truth, according to the meaning of the verse,
1  ( 22:73 ) 3 2 1 0 / . - , + * ) (
if all material causes were to gather together and if they possessed will, they 
could not gather together the being of a single fly and its systems and organs 
with their particular balance. And even if they could gather them together, 
they could not make them remain in the specified measure of the being. And 
even if they could make them remain thus, they could not make those minute 
particles, which are constantly being renewed and coming into existence and 
working, work regularly and in order. In which case, self-evidently, causes 
cannot claim ownership of things. That is to say, their True Owner is some-
one else.

Indeed, their True Owner is such that, according to the verse,

( 31:28 ) â á à ß Þ Ý Ü
He raises to life all the living beings on the face of the earth as easily as He 
raises to life a single fly. He creates the spring as easily as He creates a single 
flower. For He has no need to gather things together. Since He is the owner 
of the command of ² ± and since every spring He creates from noth-
ing the innumerable attributes, states, and forms of the innumerable beings 
of spring together with the elements of their physical beings; and since He 
determines  the  plan,  model,  index,  and  programme  of  everything  in  His 
knowledge; and since all minute particles are in motion within the sphere of 

1.  That is, “ Should all the things you call upon and worship other than Allah were to 

gather together, they could not create so much as a fly. ”

TWENTY-SIXTH FLASH

His knowledge and power; He therefore creates everything with infinite ease 
as though striking a match. And nothing at all confuses its motion so much 
as an iota. And minute particles are like a regular, disciplined army in the 
same way that the planets are an obedient army.

Since they are in motion relying on that pre-eternal power and function 
in accordance with the principles of that pre-eternal knowledge, those works 
come into existence in accordance with the power. They therefore cannot be 
deemed insignificant by considering their unimportant individualities. For 
through the strength of being connected to that power, a fly can kill off Nim-
rod, and an ant can destroy the Pharaoh’s palace, and the minute seed of the 
pine bears on its shoulder the burden of the pine tree as tall as a mountain. 
We have proved this truth in numerous places in the  R i s a l e - i   N u r : just as 
through his enlistment in the army and being connected to the king, an ordi-
nary soldier can take another king prisoner, exceeding his own capacity a 
hundred thousand times; so too, by being connected to pre-eternal power, all 
things can manifest miracles of art exceeding the capacity of natural causes 
hundreds of thousands of times.

I n    S h o r t :  The  fact  that  all  things  come  into  existence  with  both  infi-
nite  art  and  infinite  ease  shows  that  they  are  the  works  of  a  Pre-Eternal 
All-Powerful One possessing all-encompassing knowledge. Otherwise, let 
alone  coming  into  existence  with  a  hundred  thousand  difficulties,  leav-
ing the bounds of possibility and entering those of impossibility, nothing 
could even come into existence, indeed, their coming into existence would 
be impossible and precluded.

Thus, through this most subtle, powerful, profound, and clear proof, my 
soul, which had been a temporary student of Satan and the spokesman for 
the people of misguidance and the philosophers, was silenced, and, all praise 
be to Allah, came to believe completely. It said:

Yes, what I need is a Creator and Sustainer who possesses the power to 
know the least thoughts of my heart and my most secret wishes; and as He 
will  answer  the  most  hidden  needs  of  my  spirit,  so  he  will  transform  the 
mighty earth into the hereafter in order to give me eternal happiness, and 
remove this world and put the hereafter in its place; and create the heavens 
as He creates a fly; and as He fastens the sun as an eye in the face of the sky, 
so he can situate a particle in the pupil of my eye. For one who cannot create 
a fly cannot intervene in the thoughts of my heart and cannot hear the pleas 
of  my  spirit.  One  who  cannot  create  the  heavens,  cannot  give  me  eternal 
happiness. In which case, my Sustainer is He who both purifies my heart’s 

314

thoughts, and like He fills and empties the skies with clouds in an hour, so 
he will transform this world into the hereafter, make Paradise, and open its 
doors to me, bidding me to enter. 

My  elderly  brothers  who  as  a  result  of  misfortune,  like  my  soul,  have 
spent  part  of  their  lives  on  lightless  Western  materialist  philosophy  and 
science! Understand from the sacred decree of “ There is no god but He ” 
perpetually  uttered  by  the  tongue  of  the  Qur’an,  just  how  powerful,  true, 
unshakeable, undamageable, unchanging, and sacred a pillar of belief it is, 
and how it disperses all spiritual darkness and cures all spiritual wounds!

I  included  this  long  story  among  the  doors  of  hope  of  my  old  age  as 
though involuntarily. I did not want to include it, indeed, I held back from 
doing so because I thought it would be tedious. But I have to say that I felt 
compelled to write it. Anyway, to return to the main topic:

In consequence of grey hairs appearing in my hair and beard and of a 
loyal friend’s unfaithfulness, I felt a disgust at the pleasures of Istanbul’s 
worldly life which was so glittering and superficially agreeable and gilded. 
My soul searched for spiritual pleasures in place of the pleasures with which 
it was obsessed. It wanted a light, a solace, in this old age which in the view 
of the heedless is cold, burdensome, and disagreeable. And all praise be to 
Allah and a hundred thousand thanks, just as I found true, lasting, and sweet 
pleasures of belief in “ There is no god but He ” and in the light of divine 
unity  in  place  of  all  those  false,  disagreeable,  fleeting  worldly  pleasures, 
so through the light of divine unity, I saw old age which in the view of the 
heedless is cold and burdensome to be most light, and warm, and luminous.
O you elderly men and women! Since you have belief and since you pray 
and offer supplications which illuminate and increase belief, you can regard 
your old age as eternal youth. For through it you can gain eternal youth. The 
old age which in truth is cold, burdensome, ugly, dark, and full of pain is the 
old age of the people of misguidance, indeed, their youth as well. It is they 
who  should  weep  with  sighs  and  regrets.  While  you,  respected  believing 
elderly people, should joyfully offer thanks saying: “ All praise and thanks 
be to Allah for every situation! ”

TWELFTH HOPE

One  time,  I  was  being  held  in  the  district  of  Barla  in  the  province  of 
Isparta in a distressing captivity called exile, in a truly wretched state suf-
fering both illness, and old age, and absence from home, and in a village 
alone with no one, barred from all company and communication. Then, in 
His perfect mercy, Almighty Allah bestowed a light on me concerning the 

TWENTY-SIXTH FLASH

315

subtle points and mysteries of the All-Wise Qur’an which was a source of 
consolation for me. With it, I tried to forget my pitiful, sad state. I was able 
to forget my native land, my friends and relations, but alas, there was one 
person  I  could  not  forget  and  that  was  Abdurrahman,  who  was  both  my 
nephew, and my spiritual son, and my most devoted student, and my brav-
est friend. He had parted from me six or seven years previously. Neither he 
knew where I was so that he could hasten to help and console me, nor did I 
know his situation so that I could correspond with him and we could confide 
in each other. Now in my old age, I was in need of someone loyal and self-
sacrificing like him.

Then out of the blue someone gave me a letter. I opened it and saw it was 
from Abdurrahman, written in a way which showed his true self. A part of 
it that clearly shows three instances of wonderworking has been included 
among the pieces of the Twenty-Seventh Letter. It made me weep, and it 
still makes me weep. The late Abdurrahman wrote in the letter seriously and 
sincerely that he was disgusted with the pleasures of the world and that his 
greatest desire was to reach me and look to my needs in my old age just as 
I had looked to his when he was young. He also wanted to help me with his 
capable pen in spreading the mysteries of the Qur’an, my true duty in this 
world. He even wrote in his letter: “ Send me twenty or thirty treatises and 
I’ll write out twenty or thirty copies of each and get others to write them. ”

His letter made me feel very hopeful in respect of the world. With the 
thought that I had found a bold student who was so intelligent as to be a gen-
ius and would assist me more loyally and with greater attachment than a true 
son, I forgot my torturous captivity, loneliness, exile, and old age.

He had obtained a copy of the Tenth Word about belief in the hereafter 
before writing the letter. It was as if it had been a remedy for him curing 
all  the  spiritual  wounds  he  had  received  during  those  six  or  seven  years. 
He then wrote the letter to me as if he was awaiting his death with a truly 
strong and shining belief. Then one or two months later while thinking of 
once again passing a happy worldly life together with Abdurrahman, alas, 
I received news of his death. I was so shaken that five years later I am still 
under its effect. It afflicted me with a grief, sorrow, and sense of separation 
far exceeding the torturous captivity, aloneness, exile, old age, and illness 
I was then suffering. Half of my private world had died with the death of 
my  mother,  and  now  with  Abdurrahman’s  death,  the  other  half  died.  My 
ties with the world were now completely cut. For if he had lived, he could 
have been both a powerful help in my duties which looked to the hereafter, 
and  a  worthy  successor  to  fill  my  place  completely  after  me,  and  a  most 

316

THE FLASHES

self-sacrificing  friend  and  consolation.  He  would  have  been  my  cleverest 
student and companion, and a most trustworthy protector and owner of the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r .

Yes,  in  regard  to  humanity,  such  losses  are  extremely  distressing  and 
painful for people like me. It’s true outwardly I was trying to endure it, but a 
fierce storm was raging in my spirit. If from time to time solace proceeding 
from the Qur’an’s light had not consoled me, I would not have been able to 
endure it. At the time I used to wander alone in the mountains and valleys of 
Barla. Sitting in lonely places amid my sorrows, pictures of the happy life I 
had spent in former times with my loyal students like Abdurrahman passed 
through my imagination like the cinema; since due to old age and exile I was 
swiftly affected, they broke my resistance. Suddenly the sacred meaning of 
the verse,

( 28:88 ) o n m l k j i h g f
was unfolded to me. It caused me to declare: “ O Enduring One, You alone 
are Enduring! O Enduring One, You alone are Enduring! ”, and truly con-
soled me.

Then, inspired by this verse’s meaning as is described in the treatise, T h e  
H i g h w a y   o f   t h e   P r a c t i c e s   o f   t h e   P r o p h e t   (   U W B P   ) , I saw myself while in 
that lonely valley and sad state, at the head of three vast corpses:

One was the sight of myself as a gravestone on the grave of the fifty-five 
dead Saids of my fifty-five years who had been buried in the course of my 
life.

The second corpse was the vast corpse of all my fellow-men who had 
died since the time of Adam ( UWP ) and had been buried in the grave of 
the  past.  I  saw  myself  as  a  miniscule  ant-like  living  creature  at  the  head 
of that corpse, wandering over the face of this century, which was like its 
gravestone.

The third corpse was the greater world which, like human beings and the 
travelling worlds which every year die, would also – in accordance with the 
above verse – die; this was embodied before my imagination.

Then the verse, 

 ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´ ³ ² ± ° ¯ ® ¬
( 9:129 ) ¾ ½ ¼ »
completely illuminated with its true solace and inextinguishable light that 

TWENTY-SIXTH FLASH

317

awesome vision arising from my grief at Abdurrahman’s death; it came to 
my assistance with its allusive meaning, which states: since Almighty Allah 
exists, He takes the place of everything. Since He is Eternal, He is surely 
sufficient. A single manifestation of His grace takes the place of the whole 
world. One manifestation of His light infuses with life the three vast corpses 
mentioned above, showing that they are not corpses but having completed 
their duties, have departed for other worlds. This mystery has been explained 
in the Third Flash, so that sufficing with the above, here I only say that the 
two  repetitions  of  the  phrase: يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا  َتْ(cid:178)َا يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:92) اَ(cid:192)  * يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا  َتْ(cid:178)َا يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:92) اَ(cid:192),  which 
illustrates the meaning of  ( 28:88 ) j i h g f saved me from that 
distressing, sad state. It was like this:

The first time I uttered يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا  َتْ(cid:178)َا يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:92) اَ(cid:192), it began to cure me like a surgi-
cal operation on the endless spiritual wounds arising from the passing of the 
world and of the friends in this world to whom I was attached, and from the 
ties binding me being broken.

The  second  time,  the  phrase يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا  َتْ(cid:178)َا يِ(cid:162)اَ(cid:92) اَ(cid:192)  was  both  a  salve  and  an 
antidote for all those innumerable wounds. That is to say: “ You are eternal. 
If  the  rest  depart,  let  them;  You  are  enough  for  me.  Since  You  abide  for 
ever, a single manifestation of Your mercy is sufficient in place of all tran-
sient things. Since You exist, everything exists for the person who knows 
of the connection with Your existence established through belief and acts in 
accordance with that relation on account of Islam. Transience and decline, 
death  and  non-existence  are  a  veil,  a  renewal;  like  travelling  through  dif-
ferent domains. ” Thinking this, my painful, sad, grievous, dark, awesome, 
separation-stained state of mind was transformed into a happy, joyful, pleas-
urable,  luminous,  lovable,  familiar  state.  My  tongue  and  heart,  indeed  all 
the particles of my being through the tongue of disposition, exclaimed: “ All 
praise be to Allah! ”

One thousandth of that manifestation of mercy is this: I returned to Barla 
from that sorrowful valley and melancholy state of mind, where I saw that 
a young man called Kuleönlü Mustafa had come to ask me some questions 
about the five daily prayers and ablutions. Although I did not accept visitors 
at  that  hour,  my  spirit  perceived  as  though  with  foresight  his  sincerity  of 
spirit and the future valuable services he would perform for the R i s a l e - i   N u r, 1 

1.  With his fine pen, Mustafa’s younger brother, Küçük Ali, wrote out more than seven 
hundred copies of parts of the Risale-i Nur and himself became an Abdurrahman. He also 
trained many other Abdurrahmans.

318

THE FLASHES

and  I  did  not  turn  him  away,  I  accepted  him.  1  It  later  became  clear  that 
Almighty Allah sent Mustafa to me as a sample in place of Abdurrahman, 
who as a worthy successor would carry out completely the duty of a true heir 
in the work of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , as though saying: “ I took one Abdurrahman 
from you, but I shall give you thirty like the Mustafa you see in return, who 
will  be  both  students,  and  nephews,  and  spiritual  sons,  and  brothers,  and 
self-sacrificing comrades in this duty for religion. ”

Yes,  praise  be  to  Allah,  He  gave  me  thirty  Abdurrahman’s.  So  I  told 
myself: “ O weeping heart! Since you have seen this sample and through him 
He has healed the most serious of your spiritual wounds, be assured that He 
will heal all the rest of them. ”

My elderly brothers and sisters who like me have lost at the time of their 
old age a child or relative they love dearly, and who have to bear the searing 
sorrows of separation together with the burdens of old age! You have under-
stood from my situation that although it was much harsher than yours, it was 
cured and healed by a verse of the Qur’an. This being so, there are remedies 
in that sacred pharmacy to heal all your difficulties. If you have recourse to 
it through belief and make use of those remedies through worship, the heavy 
burdens of your old age and your sorrows will be alleviated considerably.

The  reason  for  writing  this  long  piece  was  to  seek  more  prayers  for 
Abdurrahman,  not  to  weary  you.  Also,  my  purpose  in  showing  my  worst 

1.  He truly showed that he was not only worthy of being accepted, but also worthy of 

the future.*

* An  event  confirming  that  Ustad’s  prediction  that  Mustafa,  the  first  student  of  the 

Risale-i Nur, was worthy of the future:

The day preceding the eve of ‘Eid al-Adha, the Feast of Sacrifices, Ustad intended to 
go out to take some air. When he sent me to fetch the horse, I said to him: “ Don’t you go 
down. I’ll lock the door from the back, and go out from the wood-store. ” Ustad said: “ No. 
You go out of the door. ” And he went down. After I had gone out, he bolted the door after 
me. I went out and he returned upstairs. He then slept. A while later Kuleönlü Mustafa ar-
rived together with Haji Osman. Ustad was not accepting anyone, and he was not going to 
accept anyone. He would never have taken in two people together, especially at that hour, 
and  would  have  turned  them  away.  Nevertheless,  when  our  brother  Kuleönlü  Mustafa, 
whom we are talking about here, came with Haji Osman, it was as though the door said to 
him through the tongue of disposition: “ Ustad will not accept you, but I’ll open for you. ” 
And although it was bolted from the inside, the door opened of its own accord for Mus-
tafa. That is to say, just as the future verified what Ustad had said about him: “ Mustafa is 
worthy of the future, ” so did the door testify to it.

Signed: H ü s r e v
Yes, what Hüsrev has written is correct and I confirm it. The door both greeted this 

blessed Mustafa in my place, and accepted him.

unduly and put you off, is to demonstrate what a wondrous remedy and bril-

THIRTEENTH HOPE 1

In this Hope I shall describe an important scene from my life; it is bound 
to be somewhat lengthy, so I hope you will not become bored or be offended.
After  being  saved  from  captivity  in  Russia  during  the  Great  War,  my 
serving religion in the Darü’l-Hikmet kept me in Istanbul for two or three 
years. Then through the guidance of the All-Wise Qur’an and spiritual influ-
ence of Ghawth al-A’zam and the awakening of old age, I felt a weariness 
at the civilized life of Istanbul and a disgust at its glittering social life. A 
feeling of longing for my native land drove me there, I went to Van with the 
thought that since I am bound to die, I’ll die in my own country.

First of all, I went to visit my m e d r e s e  in Van, the Horhor. The Armeni-
ans had razed it during the Russian occupation, like the rest of the buildings. 
It  was  right  under  and  adjacent  to  Van’s  famous  citadel,  which  is  a  great 
monolith like a mountain. My true friends, brothers, and close students of 
the  m e d r e s e   which  I  had  left  seven  or  eight  years  earlier  were  embodied 
before my eyes. Some of those devoted friends had become actual martyrs, 
while others had died due to that calamity and had in effect become martyrs.
I  could  not  restrain  myself  from  weeping.  I  climbed  to  the  top  of  the 
citadel which overlooking the m e d r e s e , towers above it to the height of two 
minarets,  and  I  sat  down.  I  went  back  in  my  imagination  seven  or  eight 
years. Having a powerful imagination, I wandered all around that time in 
my mind. There was no one around to distract me and draw me back. For I 
was alone. As my view of those seven or eight years expanded, I saw enough 
to fill a century. I saw that the town at the foot of the citadel had been com-
pletely burnt and destroyed. It was as though two hundred years had passed 
from  when  I  had  seen  it  previously  to  them,  it  seemed  so  infinitely  sad. 
Most of the houses’ inhabitants had been my friends and acquaintances. The 
majority of them had died in the migrations, may Allah have mercy on them, 
or had gone to a wretched exile. Only the Armenian quarter remained, all 
the Muslim houses of Van had been levelled. My heart was lacerated. I was 
so affected, if I had had a thousand eyes they would have all wept together.

THE FLASHES

I had returned to my homeland from exile; I had supposed that I had been 
saved from exile. But alas! the most lamentable exile I experienced was in 
my homeland. I saw that hundreds of my students and friends to whom I had 
been closely attached, like Abdurrahman in the Twelfth Hope, had entered 
the grave and that their places were all ruins. 

There were some lines of someone who had long been in my mind, but I 
had not understood their true meaning. Now before that sad scene I gained a 
full understanding of them. The lines were these: 
  ً(cid:203)ُ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126) اَ(cid:179) ِ(cid:110)اَوْرَا ىٰ(cid:170)ِا اَ(cid:192)اَ(cid:179)ُ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)ا اَ(cid:183)َ(cid:170)  ْتَدَ(cid:106)َو اَ(cid:174)  ِباَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:110)َ

ْ(cid:202)ا ُةَ(cid:162)َراَ(cid:159)ُ(cid:174)  َ(cid:202)ْوَ(cid:170)

“ If there were no separation from friends, death could find no way to our 
spirits to seize them. ”1 That is to say, what kills man most is separation from 
those he loves. Yes, nothing had caused me as much suffering and sorrow as 
that situation. If assistance had not come from the Qur’an and from belief, 
my grief and sorrow and suffering would have made my spirit fly away.

Since early times in their verses, poets have lamented the destruction with 
time of the places they have been together with their beloveds. I had seen this 
most painfully with my own eyes. With the sorrow of someone passing by 
the dwellings of beloved friends after two hundred years, my heart and spirit 
joined my eyes in weeping. Then one by one the happy scenes of the life I 
had passed for nearly twenty years in study with my valuable students, when 
the places which were now in ruins were flourishing and happy, sprang to 
life before me like pictures at the cinema, then died away and vanished. This 
continued before the eye of my imagination for some time.

Then I felt astonished at the state of the worldly, how is it that they deceive 
themselves? For the situation there showed clearly that this world is transi-
tory and that human beings are guests within it. I saw with my own eyes how 
true are the constantly repeated words of the people of reality: “ The world is 
cruel, treacherous, bad; don’t be deceived by it! ” I also saw that just as man 
is connected with his own body and household, so is he connected with his 
town, his country, and with the world. For while weeping with my two eyes 
at the pitifulness of old age in respect of my body, I wanted to weep with ten 
eyes not only at my m e d r e s e ’s  old age, but at its death. And I felt the need to 
weep with a hundred eyes at the half-death of my beautiful homeland.

It states in a Hadith that every morning an angel calls out: 

ِباَرَ(cid:115)ْ(cid:171)ِ(cid:170) اوُ(cid:179)ْ(cid:92)اَو  ِتْو َ(cid:175)ْ(cid:171)ِ(cid:170) اوُدِ(cid:170) 2 I was hearing this truth not with my ears, but with 
my eyes.

Ten years later I still weep when I think of that situation, as it made me 
weep  then.  Yes,  the  ruins  of  the  houses  at  the  foot  of  the  ancient  citadel, 
thousands  of  years  old,  and  the  town  ageing  eight  hundred  years  in  eight 
years,  and  the  death  of  my  once-flourishing  m e d r e s e   which  had  been  the 
gathering-place of friends, all indicated the vastness of the immaterial corpse 
of all the m e d r e s e s  in the Ottoman Empire, which now had died; the great 
monolith of Van’s citadel had become a gravestone to all of them. It was 
as though my students who had been together with me in the m e d r e s e  eight 
years previously were weeping in their graves together with me. Indeed, the 
ruined walls of the town and its scattered stones were weeping with me. I 
saw them to be weeping.

Then I understood that I could not endure this exile in my native land. I 
thought that I would either have to join them in the grave, or withdraw into a 
cave in the mountains and await my death there. I told myself: “ These unen-
durable,  searing  separations  which  destroy  patience  and  resistance  surely 
make death preferable to life. The pains of such a life are unbearable. ”

I then cast a glance over the six aspects and saw that they were all black. 
The heedlessness resulting from my intense grief showed me the world as 
terrifying, empty, desolate, and about to collapse over my head. My spirit 
sought a point of support in the face of innumerable hostile calamities. Its 
endless desires which stretch to eternity were seeking out something to sat-
isfy them. While awaiting consolation in the face of the sorrow arising from 
those endless separations and deaths, that endless devastation, suddenly the 
truth was manifested of the All-Wise Qur’an’s verses:

  *  μ ´ ³ ² ± ° ¯ ® ¬ «
( 57:1-2 ) Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½  » º ¹ ¸
It saved me from that pitiful, terrible, sad, separation-stained imagining, and 
opened my eyes. I saw that the fruits at the tops of the fruit-trees were look-
ing at me as though smiling. “ Note us as well, ” they were saying. “ Do not 
only look at the ruins. ” The verses’ truth brought the following thought to 
mind: “ Why does an artificial letter written in the form of a town by the 
hand of man, who is a guest on the page of Van’s plain, being wiped out by 
a calamitous torrent called the Russian invasion sadden you to this extent? 
Consider the Pre-Eternal Inscriber, everything’s True Owner and Sustainer, 
for His missives on this page continue to be written in glittering fashion, in 
the way you used to see. Your weeping over those desolate ruins arises from 

322

the error of forgetting their True Owner, not thinking that men are guests and 
imagining them to be owner. ”

A door to reality opened up from my error, from that searing sight, and 
my soul was prepared to accept the reality completely. Like iron is plunged 
in the fire so that it softens and may be profited from, that grievous sight 
and terrible state were fire which softened my soul. Through the reality of 
the above verses, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition showed my soul the 
effulgence of the truths of belief, causing it to accept it.

Yes,  all  thanks  be  to  Allah,  as  is  proved  conclusively  in  such  parts  of 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  as the Twentieth Letter, through the effulgence of belief in 
Allah, the truth of the verses becomes a source of strength for the spirit and 
heart which unfolds proportionately to the firmness of each person’s belief. 
This was so powerful it afforded me the strength to confront calamities even 
a  hundred  times  more  dreadful  than  the  situation  I  beheld.  It  uttered  this 
reminder: “ Everything is subjected to the command of this country’s True 
Owner,  your  Creator.  He  holds  the  reins  of  all  things.  Your  relation  with 
Him should be sufficient. ”

On recognizing my Creator and relying on Him, all the things that had 
appeared hostile gave up their enmity, and the grievous things that had made 
me weep started to make me happy. As we have demonstrated with certain 
proofs in many places in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , through the light proceeding from 
belief in the hereafter, that recognition and reliance afforded such assistance 
in the face of my endless desires that it was sufficient not only for my attach-
ment  to  and  desire  for  insignificant,  temporary,  brief  worldly  friendships, 
but  for  my  innumerable  far-reaching  desires  in  the  world  of  permanence, 
for everlasting happiness through all eternity. For through one manifestation 
of His mercy, the All-Merciful and Compassionate One every spring lays 
on the table of that season incalculable numbers of delightful, artful boun-
ties in order to please His guests of one or two hours. Then after providing 
them with these, which are a sort of snack or appetizer, He prepares for His 
servants innumerable varieties of bounties, and for an unending time fills 
eight permanent Paradises with them from among His everlasting dwelling-
places.  The  person  who  relies  on  the  mercy  of  such  an  All-Merciful  and 
Compassionate One through belief and knows his relation surely finds such 
a  source  of  assistance  that  even  its  least  degree  provides  for  innumerable 
hopes reaching to eternity, and causes them to continue.

Furthermore, through the reality of the verses, the light proceeding from 
the effulgence of belief was manifested in such brilliant fashion that it lit 

TWENTY-SIXTH FLASH

up those six dark aspects like daytime. It illuminated the grief I felt for my 
students and friends in my m e d r e s e  and in the town with this reminder: “ The 
world your friends have gone to is not dark. They have merely gone some-
where  else;  you  will  meet  again. ”  It  put  an  end  to  my  tears  entirely,  and 
made me understand that I would find others resembling them in this world 
who would take their place.

Yes, all praise be to Allah, He both raised to life the dead Van m e d r e s e  
with the m e d r e s e  of Isparta, and He in meaning raised my friends there to 
life with the more numerous and valuable students and friends here. It also 
made known that the world is not empty and meaningless and that my think-
ing of it as a ravaged country had been wrong: as required by His wisdom, 
the True Owner changes the artificial scenes made by man and renews His 
missives.  The  more  the  fruits  of  some  trees  are  plucked,  the  more  others 
grow in their places; so too death and separation among mankind constitute 
renewal and change. In respect of belief, they are a renewal that produces 
not the grievous sorrow arising from the lack of friends, but the sweet sor-
row born of parting in the hope of meeting again in another, better place.

The verses also illuminated the face of the beings in the universe which 
had appeared dark in the former ghastly situation. I wanted to offer thanks 
for this, and the following Arabic lines occurred to me, which described that 
reality exactly. I said:

 اً(cid:98)اَوْ(cid:174)َا ًءاَدْ(cid:150)َا  َبِ(cid:178)اَ(cid:106)َا ُمَ

That is to say, due to the heedlessness resulting from my grievous state of 
mind, some of the beings in the universe appeared to my neglectful soul as 
hostile and strange, 1 others as awesome corpses, and yet others as orphans 
weeping  in  their  loneliness.  In  the  light  of  belief  I  saw  that  they  were  all 
friends  and  brothers.  As  for  the  awesome  corpses,  some  were  living  and 
friendly  while  others  had  been  released  from  their  duties.  Seeing  through 
the light of belief the wailing of the orphans to be the murmuring of remem-
brance and glorification of Allah, I offered endless praise and thanks to the 
Glorious Creator, for He had given me belief, the source of these innumera-
ble bounties. And seeing that it is incumbent on me to think of all the beings 

1.  Like earthquake, storm, tempest, plague, and fire.

in my personal world, which is as vast as the world, as being engaged in the 
praise and glorification of Allah, and through intention to make use of them, 
it means that I say “ All praise and thanks to Allah for the light of belief ” 
together with all those beings, who utter it singly and as a whole through the 
tongue of disposition.

Moreover, the pleasures of life, which had been reduced to nothing by 
my  heedless  and  dreadful  state  of  mind,  and  my  hopes,  which  had  with-
ered up entirely, and my personal enjoyment and bounties, which had been 
constricted  within  the  narrowest  bounds,  indeed,  destroyed,  suddenly  so 
expanded through the light of belief that narrow sphere around my heart that 
it contained the whole universe – as has been proved clearly in other parts 
of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  – and in place of the bounties which had withered up in 
the garden of the Horhor Medrese and lost their taste, it made the realms 
of this world and the hereafter each a merciful table of bounties. It showed 
that not only the ten or so human members like the eyes, ears, and heart, 
but also the hundred members were an extremely long arm which believers 
might extend each according to his degree, to those two tables of the Most 
Merciful, to gather in the bounties from all sides. At that time, I uttered the 
following words both to express this elevated truth, and as thanks for those 
endless bounties:

“ I offer praise and thanks to my Creator for the light and bounty of belief 
to my very utmost, with all the particles of my being, for it shows me that 
this world and the hereafter are overflowing with bounties and mercy, and 
allows me and all true believers to benefit from those two vast tables with 
the hands of all their senses, which develop and unfold through the light of 
belief and Islam. ” 

ِلﯭﯧِ(cid:170)

Since belief is so tremendously effective in this world, certainly in the 
Eternal Realm it will have such fruits and effulgences that they cannot be 
comprehended with the mind in this world, nor described.

O you elderly people who like me experience the pains of separation from 
numerous friends due to old age! However much older than me in years the 
oldest of you is, my guess is that in meaning I am older than him. For since 
by nature I feel excessive pity and compassion for my fellow beings, I have 
experienced  the  sufferings  of  thousands  of  my  brothers  in  addition  to  my 

ٰ
ّ
TWENTY-SIXTH FLASH

own pains and feel as though I have lived for hundreds of years. However 
much you have suffered the calamity of separation, you have not suffered it 
as I have. For I have no son that I should think only of him. I feel pain and 
sympathy towards thousands of Muslim sons and their sorrows, and even 
innocent animals, due to the excessive pity and compassion in my nature. 
I do not have a house of my own that I should think only of it; I am bound 
through Islamic zeal to this country and even the Islamic world, as though 
they were my house. I am saddened at the pains of my fellow Muslims in 
those two great houses, and am sorrowful at being parted from them!

Thus, the light of belief was sufficient for me and all my sorrows arising 
from  old  age  and  the  pains  of  separation;  it  gave  me  an  inextinguishable 
hope, an unassailable faith, an unquenchable light, unending solace. Belief 
then is certainly more than enough for you in the face of the darkness, heed-
lessness, sorrows, and griefs of old age. In fact, the old age that is utterly 
black and lacking in light and solace, and is the most grievous and terrible 
separation, is the old age and separation suffered by the people of misguid-
ance and the dissipated. It is possible to experience the belief that affords 
hope, light, and solace, and its effects by adopting a consciously worshipful 
attitude,  worthy  of  old  age  and  appropriate  to  Islam.  It  is  not  possible  by 
trying to imitate the young, and plunging one’s head into heedlessness and 
forgetting old age.

FOURTEENTH HOPE

The  summary  at  the  start  of  the  Fourth  Ray,  on  the  luminous  verse 
( 3:173 ) Ø × Ö Õ  describes  how  having  been  isolated  from 
everything  by  ‘the  worldly’,  I  was  afflicted  with  five  sorts  of  exile.  The 
heedlessness arising from distress led me to look not to the consoling lights 
of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   which  would  have  aided  me,  but  directly  to  my  heart 
and my spirit. I saw that governing in me were an overpowering desire for 
immortality, an intense love of existence, a great yearning for life, together 
with  an  infinite  impotence  and  endless  want.  But  an  awesome  transience 
was extinguishing the immortality. Suffering this state of mind, I exclaimed 
like the poet:

R e a l i t y   w a n t e d   t h e   p a s s i n g   o f   m y   b o d y,   t h o u g h   m y   h e a r t   d e s i r e d   i t s

I bowed my head in despair. Suddenly the verse, Ø × Ö Õ 
came to my assistance, summoning me to read it with attention. So I recited 
it five hundred times every day. The more I recited it, nine levels of meaning 
were unfolded to me out of its many lights, at the level of ‘certainty at the 
degree of knowledge,’ and even of ‘certainty at the degree of witnessing.’

The First Level of the Luminous Verse

The First Level of the Luminous Verse “ For us Allah suffices ”

By  virtue  of  a  shadow  in  my  essential  being  of  a  manifestation  of  a 
name of the Glorious One of Perfection, who, possessing absolute perfec-
tion, is of Himself and for no other reason worthy of love, I had an innate 
desire for immortality, directed not to my own immortality but to the exist-
ence,  perfection,  and  immortality  of  that  Absolutely  Perfect  One.  But 
due  to  heedlessness  that  innate  love  had  lost  its  way,  become  attached  to 
the  shadow  and  enamoured  of  the  mirror  of  immortality.  Then  the  verse, 
Ø × Ö Õ raised the veil. I saw and felt and experienced at 
the  degree  of  ‘absolute  certainty’  that  the  pleasure  and  happiness  of  my 
immortality lay exactly and in more perfect form in the immortality of the 
Enduring One of Perfection and in affirming my Sustainer and Allah, and 
in believing in Him, and submitting to Him. The evidence for this has been 
explained  in  the  Fourth  Ray,  the  treatise  on  the  verse  “ F o r   u s   A l l a h   s u f -
f i c e s , ” in twelve sections which are extremely profound and subtle and will 
fill with wonder anyone with fine sensibilities.

At  a  time  when,  in  my  old  age,  exile,  aloneness,  and  isolation,  ‘the 
worldly’ were attacking me with their spies and stratagems despite my 
boundless innate impotence, I told my heart: “ Whole armies are attack-
ing  a  single  man  whose  hands  are  tied  and  is  ill  and  weak.  Is  there 
nothing  from  which  he  can  seek  help? ”  I  had  recourse  to  the  verse 
Ø × Ö Õ and it informed me of the following:

Through  the  document  of  belief,  you  become  connected  to  a  Ruler  of 
Absolute Power who every spring equips in perfect order all the plant and 
animal armies on the face of the earth composed of four hundred thousand 
different nations. In addition, He places in the ‘extracts’ of the Most Mer-
ciful known as seeds and grains, which are like the meat, sugar and other 
food extracts discovered recently by the people of civilization but a hundred 
times more perfect, all the sustenance of the huge armies of foremost man, 
and of all the animals. He folds up inside those extracts the instructions of 
divine determining concerning their cooking and development, and places 
them in their tiny protective cases. The creation of those tiny coffers is with 
such  ease,  speed,  and  abundance  from  the  “ K ā f .   N ū n  ”  factory,  which  is 
governed by the command of “ ‘B e ! ’  a n d   i t   i s , ” that the Qur’an states: “ The 
Creator merely commands and it comes into being. ” Gaining such support 
with the document of the relationship of belief, you can rely on an infinite 
strength and power. As I assimilated this lesson from the verse, I found such 
a moral strength arising from belief that through its power I could have chal-
lenged not only my present enemies, but the whole world. With all my spirit 
I declared: Ø × Ö Õ

The Third Level of the Luminous Verse

At a time when, finding my attachment to the world to be broken due to 
suffering the oppression of those exiles and illnesses, belief recalled to me 
that I was destined for perpetual happiness in an eternal world, an everlasting 
realm, I gave up sighing regretfully, which caused further grief and yearn-
ing, and became cheerful and happy. However, this goal of the imagination 
and spirit and result of man’s nature could only be realized through the infi-
nite power of an Absolutely Omnipotent One who knows and records the 
action and rest and conduct and states, in word and deed, of all creatures, and 
takes as His friend and addressee insignificant and absolutely impotent man, 

328

giving him a rank superior to all beings; it could only be realized through 
His infinite favours to man and the importance He gives him. While think-
ing of these two points, that is, the activity of such a power and the impor-
tance of apparently insignificant man, I wanted an explanation which would 
deepen belief and satisfy the heart. Again I had recourse to the verse, and it 
told me to note the اَ(cid:178) “ F o r   u s , ” and to heed who is saying اَ(cid:179)ُ(cid:93) ْ(cid:127)َ(cid:110) verbally 
and through the tongue of disposition together with me.

I at once looked and saw that innumerable birds and flies, which are min-
iature birds, and uncountable animals, and boundless plants and trees were, 
like me, reciting through the tongue of disposition Ø × Ö Õ.  
They recall to everyone the immensity and majesty of a power which before 
our eyes particularly in the spring creates in most abundant plenitude, with 
the greatest ease and on a vast scale, from eggs, seeds, grains, and droplets 
of  fluid,  which  all  resemble  each  other  and  whose  substance  is  the  same, 
the hundred thousand species of birds, the hundreds of thousands of sorts 
of  animals,  the  hundred  thousand  types  of  plants,  and  the  hundred  thou-
sand varieties of trees, without error, defect, or confusion, in adorned, bal-
anced,  well-ordered  fashion,  and  in  forms  all  different  from  one  another. 
They demonstrate to us His unity and oneness by being made in this way 
together, one within the other and resembling each other. I understood that 
any interference or participation in the dominical, creative act of disposal 
which displays thus incalculable miracles was not possible. Those who want 
to understand my personality and human character, which is like that of all 
believers,  and  those  who  want  to  be  like  me,  should  look  at  the  explana-
tion of the ‘I’ in the first person plural اَ(cid:178) in اَ(cid:179)ُ(cid:93) ْ(cid:127)َ(cid:110) that is, the explanation of 
myself. What is my apparently insignificant, wanting being – like that of all 
believers? What is life? What is humanity? What is Islam? What is certain, 
affirmative belief? What is knowledge of Allah? How should love be? They 
should understand and take a lesson!

A time I was being shaken by old age, exile, illness, and defeat coincided 
with a period of heedlessness. I was grievously anxious that my being, to 
which I was intensely attached and by which I was captivated, indeed all 
creatures,  were  departing  for  non-existence,  then  again  I  had  recourse  to 
the  verse.  It  told  me:  “ Note  my  meaning  carefully  and  look  through  the 
telescope of belief! ”

TWENTY-SIXTH FLASH

So I looked and with the eye of belief and saw that like all believers, my 
miniscule  being  was  the  mirror  of  a  limitless  being,  and  through  infinite 
expansion, the means of gaining innumerable existences, and was a word 
of wisdom producing the fruits of numerous permanent existences far more 
valuable than itself. I knew with ‘certainty at the degree of knowledge’ that 
owing to the relationship of belief to live for an instant was as valuable as 
an eternal existence. For I understood through the consciousness of belief 
that this being of mine was the work of art, artefact, and manifestation of 
the Necessarily Existent One. So being saved from the anxiety of loneliness 
and  from  innumerable  separations  and  their  pains,  I  formed  relations  and 
bonds of brotherhood with beings to the number of divine acts and names 
connected with beings and especially living beings, and I knew that there 
was a permanent union with all the beings I  loved,  and only a temporary 
separation. And so, through belief and the relations of belief, like all beings, 
my being gained the lights of innumerable existences untouched by separa-
tion. Even if it departed, they would remain behind and it would be happy as 
though it had remained itself.

In short, death is not separation, it is union; it is a change of abode; it is 

the producing of an eternal fruit.

Another time my life was being shaken by harsh conditions, they directed 
my  attention  towards  life.  I  saw  that  my  life  was  departing  at  speed;  the 
hereafter was drawing close; due to the oppression I was suffering my life 
had started to be extinguished. As is explained in the section of the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  on the divine name of Ever-Living, I thought sorrowfully of how with 
its important functions, and great benefits and virtues, life did not deserve to 
be so swiftly extinguished but to last a long time. I again had recourse to my 
master, the verse,  Ø × Ö Õ. This time it told me: “ Consider 
life from the point of view of the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One, who 
gives you life! ”

So I looked and I saw that if only one aspect of my life looked to me, a 
hundred looked to the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One. And if, of its 
results, one looked to me, a thousand looked to my Creator. Since this is the 
case, to live for one instant within the bounds of divine pleasure is sufficient; 
a  long  time  is  not  required.  This  truth  may  be  explained  in  four  matters. 
Anyone who is not dead or who wants to be alive should seek the nature and 
reality of life and its true rights in those four matters; they will find them and 
be raised to life!

THE FLASHES

A summary is this: the more life looks to the Ever-Living and Self-Sub-
sistent One, and the more belief becomes the life and spirit of life, the more 
it becomes perpetual and produces enduring fruits. It also becomes so ele-
vated that it receives the manifestation of eternity; it no longer looks to the 
brevity or length of a lifetime.

At  a  time  when  my  advancing  years  and  old  age  were  giving  warning

the destruction of the world, the time of general parting, the feelings in my 
nature of love of beauty and passion for loveliness and fascination by per-
fection  were  unfolding  in  an  extraordinarily  sensitive  manner.  I  saw  with 
extraordinary  clarity  and  sorrow  that  transience  and  decline,  which  are 
always  destructive,  and  death  and  non-existence,  which  perpetually  cause 
separations, were tearing apart this beautiful world and these beautiful crea-
tures in terrible fashion, and destroying their beauty. The metaphorical love 
in my nature boiled up and rebelled against this situation. In order to find 
consolation, I again had recourse to the verse “ F o r   u s  A l l a h   s u f f i c e s . ” It told 
me: “ Recite me and consider my meaning carefully! ”

So I entered the observatory of the verse in Sura al-Nur, 

( 24:35 ) | { z y
and looked through the telescope of belief to the most distant levels of the 
verse “ F o r   u s   A l l a h   s u f f i c e s , ” then through the microscope of the insight of 
belief at its most subtle mysteries, and saw the following:

Mirrors, pieces of glass, transparent things, and even bubbles, show the 
various hidden beauties of the sun’s light and of the seven colours in its light; 
and through their motion and renewal, and different capacities and refrac-
tion, they renew that beauty; and through their refracting, they display the 
hidden beauties and loveliness of the sun and its light. In exactly the same 
way, in order to act as mirrors to the sacred beauty of the All-Beauteous One 
of Glory, the Pre-Eternal and Post-Eternal Sun, and to the everlasting loveli-
ness of His most beautiful names, and to renew their manifestations, these 
beautiful  creatures,  these  lovely  artefacts,  these  exquisite  beings,  arrive 
and  depart  without  stopping.  Powerful  proofs  are  expounded  in  detail  in 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  that demonstrate that the beauties apparent on them belong 
not to them, but are signs, indications, flashes, and manifestations of a per-
petually manifesting, eternal, holy beauty which desires to appear, a tran-
scendent, sacred loveliness which wants to be seen. The explanation begins 
by saying that three of those proofs have been mentioned briefly and most

reasonably. The treatise leaves in amazement everyone of fine perception 
who sees it so that in addition to benefiting from it themselves, they find it 
necessary to try to allow others to benefit from it. Anyone whose mind is 
not rotten and heart not corrupted will appreciate, admire, and recommend 
the five points explained in the second proof, and exclaiming: “ M a ’s h a l l a h !  
B a r a k a l l a h !  ” will perceive and affirm that it is a wondrous marvel which 
will exalt his apparently lowly, wanting being.
FIFTEENTH HOPE 1

One time when I was in compulsory residence in Emirdağ, 2 in what was 
virtually solitary confinement, I became wearied of life due to the torments 
they inflicted on me with their surveillance and arbitrary treatment, which 
I  found  hard  to  bear,  and  I  regretted  having  been  released  from  prison.  I 
longed for Denizli Prison with all my spirit, and wanted to enter the grave. 
But while thinking, prison and the grave are preferable to such a life, and 
deciding  to  enter  one  or  the  other,  divine  grace  came  to  my  assistance:  it 
bestowed on the students of the Medresetü’z-Zehra, 3 whose pens were like 
duplicating machines, one of the machines, which had just appeared. All at 
once,  five  hundred  copies  each  of  the  valuable  collections  of  the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r   appeared  from  a  single  pen.  Their  presaging  new  victories  made  me 
love that distressing life, and caused me to offer unending thanks.

A  while  later,  unable  to  endure  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s  victories,  its  covert 
enemies prompted the government to act against us. Again life became dif-
ficult for me. Then suddenly dominical grace was manifested: the officials 
connected with the case, who were those most in need of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
studied the confiscated copies in the course of their duties most curiously 
and carefully, and its treatises gave their hearts a sense of bias towards it. 

1.  This Fifteenth Hope was written by a Nurju to complete in the future the Tr e a t i s e  
f o r   t h e   E l d e r l y , and as a source for its composition, since the period of the Risale-i Nur’s 
writing had come to an end three years’ previously.

1949. ( Tr. )

eastern Anatolia, where the religious sciences would be taught together with the modern 
sciences. He received funds from Sultan Reşad and laid the foundations on the shores of 
Lake Van in 1911, but it was not completed due to the outbreak of World War I. With the 
spread of the Risale-i Nur in the first decades of the republic, Risale-i Nur Medreses, or 
places where the Risale-i Nur was studied or copies of it were written, opened throughout 
Turkey. Bediuzzaman then called the Risale-i Nur students, students of the Medresetü’z-
Zehra. ( Tr. )

THE FLASHES

As they began to appreciate it rather than criticize it, the R i s a l e - i  N u r ’s circle 
of study greatly expanded. It produced profits a hundred times greater than 
our material losses, reducing to nothing our anxiety and distress.

Then,  secret,  hostile  dissemblers  directed  the  government’s  attention 
towards  my  person.  They  recalled  my  former  political  activities.  They 
aroused suspicions about me in both the judiciary, and the education authori-
ties, and the police, and the Home Affairs Office. These spread at the hand 
of  the  different  parties  and  the  incitement  of  concealed  communist  anar-
chists. They started to pressure us and arrest us, and confiscate the parts of 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  that fell into their hands. The activities of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
students came to a standstill. A number of officials made false accusations 
which  no  one  at  all  could  believe.  They  tried  to  spread  around  the  most 
extraordinary slander, but they could make no one believe it. 

Then they arrested me during the coldest days of winter on some trite pre-
text, and put me into solitary confinement in prison in a large and extremely 
cold ward, leaving me two days without a stove. I was accustomed to light 
my stove several times a day in my small room and always had live coals in 
the brazier, so with my illness and weakness I could endure it only with dif-
ficulty. While struggling in this situation suffering from both a fever and the 
cold, and dreadful distress and anger, a truth unfolded in my heart through 
divine grace. It uttered the following warning to my spirit:

“ You called prison the Medrese-i Yûsufiye – the School of the Prophet 
Joseph, and while in Denizli, things like relief a thousand times greater than 
your distress, and spiritual profit, and the other prisoners benefiting from the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , and its widespread triumphs, all made you offer endless thanks 
instead  of  complaining.  They  made  each  hour  of  your  imprisonment  and 
hardship the equivalent of ten hours’ worship, and made those passing hours 
eternal. Allah willing, the calamity-stricken in this third School of Joseph 
benefiting from the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and finding consolation will heat this cold, 
severe distress of yours and transform it into joy. If the people you are angry 
at are being deceived and are ill-treating you without realizing it, they are 
not worth being angry at. And if they are tormenting you and causing you 
suffering knowingly, out of spite and on account of misguidance, they will 
in a short time enter the solitary confinement of the grave due to the eternal 
execution of death, to suffer everlasting torment and torture. Their oppres-
sion is earning for you both merit and spiritual pleasures, and is making tran-
sient hours eternal, and is allowing you to perform scholarly and religious 
duties with sincerity. ”

With  all  my  strength  I  exclaimed:  “ All  praise  be  to  Allah! ”  Out  of 
humanity, I pitied those tyrants and prayed: “ O my Sustainer, reform them! ” 
As I wrote in my statement to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in this new 
incident  the  truly  guilty  are  those  tyrants  who  in  ten  respects  act  unlaw-
fully in the name of the law. They found extraordinary pretexts showing to 
anyone fair-minded with their slanders and fabrications, which would have 
made those who heard them laugh and lovers of the truth weep, that they can 
find no way to attack the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its students in respect of the law 
and right, so deviate into lunacy.

For instance, the officials who spied on us for a month could find nothing 
incriminating,  so  they  wrote  out  a  memorandum  saying:  “ Said’s  servants 
bought r a k ı  from a shop and took it to him. ” They could find no one to sign 
the  memo,  but  finally  arrested  a  drunken  stranger  and  got  him  to  sign  it 
under threat. Even he said: “ Allah forgive us! Who would sign this extraor-
dinary lie? ” So they were compelled to tear it up.

A   S e c o n d   E x a m p l e :  Someone I did not know and still do not know, lent 
his horse so that I could go out for a ride. I used to go out most days for a 
couple of hours in the summer, for my illness and to take some air. I had 
given my word that I would give the owner of the horse and phaeton books 
worth fifty  l i r a s , so as not to break my rule and become indebted to him. 
Could any harm come of such a thing? But then both the Governor, and the 
court  officials,  and  the  police  questioned  us  fifty  times  about  the  horse’s 
owner.  As  though  it  were  some  important  political  event  affecting  public 
security! One person even said loyally that the horse was his and another, 
that the phaeton was his, in order to put a stop to this meaningless question-
ing, and they were both arrested together with me. We watched numerous 
childish escapades like these two examples and laughed till we cried. And 
we understood that those who attack the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its students make 
fools of themselves.

An  amusing  incident  from  among  those  examples:  the  reason  given 
on  the  paper  authorizing  my  arrest  was  “ disturbing  public  order. ”  Not 
having seen the document, I told the public prosecutor: “ I slandered you 
last night. I said to a police officer who was questioning me for the Police 
Chief: ‘If I haven’t served this country’s public security as much as a thou-
sand public prosecutors and a thousand police chiefs – three times – may 
Allah damn me!’ ”

Just at that point, when in those freezing conditions I was in most need 
of rest and not catching cold and not thinking of the world, I was overcome 

334

THE FLASHES

with anger and vexation at those who had sent me into this intolerable exile, 
isolation, imprisonment, and oppression, in a way that spelt out their hatred 
and  ill-intentions.  Divine  grace  came  to  my  assistance,  and  the  following 
was imparted to my heart:

“ Divine determining, which is pure justice, has a large part in the wrong-
ful oppression which these people are inflicting on you. You have food to 
eat  in  this  prison;  that  sustenance  of  yours  called  you  here.  It  should  be 
met with contentment and resignation. Dominical wisdom and mercy have 
a large part, which is to illuminate those in this prison and console them, 
and to gain you reward. This share should be met with endless thanks and 
patience. Your soul has a part in it, due to its faults which you did not know 
about. In the face of this, you should tell your soul by repenting and seeking 
forgiveness that it deserved this blow. Some of your secret enemies have a 
part in it, with their intrigues and deceiving certain ingenuous and suspicious 
officials and inciting them to such oppression. In the face of this share, the 
terrible  immaterial  blows  dealt  by  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   on  those  dissemblers 
have avenged you completely. That is enough for them. The final part is the 
officials who were the actual means. In the face of this share, it is an act of 
magnanimity to forgive them in accordance with the rule, 

( 3:134 ) 7 6 5 4 3
for whether they wanted to or not they may have benefited from the R i s a l e - i  
N u r  in respect of belief, although they looked at with the intention of criti-
cizing it.

I  felt  such  happiness  and  gratitude  at  this  veracious  warning  that  I 
decided to commit some harmless offence and incur a prison sentence, so 
that  I  might  remain  in  this  new  School  of  Joseph  and  perhaps  even  help 
those who were opposed to me. For someone like me who was seventy-five 
years old, without attachment, and only five out of the seventy people he 
loved in this world remained alive, the grave was a hundred times preferable 
to this prison. For seventy thousand copies of the treatises of the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r  were in free circulation and would perform my duties connected with 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and I had brothers and heirs who would continue to serve 
belief with thousands of tongues in place of my one tongue. This prison too 
was a hundred times more comfortable and more beneficial than the unfree 
liberty outside subject to that tyranny and oppression. For in place of having 
to suffer all alone outside the arbitrary treatment of hundreds of officials, in 
prison, together with hundreds of other prisoners one only has to suffer the 
intentional slight arbitrariness of one or two people like the prison governor 

TWENTY-SIXTH FLASH

and chief warder. And in the face of this, one receives the brotherly kind-
ness  and  consolation  of  many  fellow-prisoners.  With  the  thought  that  the 
compassion of Islam and human nature are shown as kindness to the elderly 
in such a position, thus turning the hardship of prison into mercy, I became 
resigned to prison.

At the time I attended this third trial, because of my difficulty in remain-
ing on my feet due to weakness, old age, and illness, I sat on a chair outside 
the  door  of  the  court.  The  judge  suddenly  appeared  and  angrily  asked  in 
insulting manner: “ Why isn’t he waiting on his feet? ” I was angry at this 
unkindness in the face of my old age. Then I looked and saw that a large 
number of Muslims had gathered around us and were watching in most kind 
and brotherly fashion, and were not being dispersed. I was suddenly warned 
of the following two truths:

The  First:  The  covert  enemies  of  myself  and  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   had 
deceived certain ingenuous officials with the intention of putting a stop to 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s conquests by destroying the public’s good opinion of me, 
which in any event I did not want, and of destroying my character in the peo-
ple’s view; they had prompted those officials to act contemptuously towards 
me in that way. See these hundred people in place of that one man’s insults! 
In return for the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s service to belief – as a divine favour – they 
are kindly offering their sympathy by appreciating your service, and both 
welcoming you and seeing you off. Even, while I was in the examining mag-
istrate’s office on the second day of the trial answering the public prosecu-
tor’s questions, around a thousand people gathered in the courtyard opposite 
the  court  windows  and  showed  their  concern;  they  appeared  to  be  telling 
them through the tongue of disposition not to pressurize us. The police could 
not  make  them  disperse.  It  was  imparted  to  my  heart  that  in  this  danger-
ous age these people want a true solace, an inextinguishable light, powerful 
belief, and certain good news about eternal happiness, and that they search 
for these by nature. They must have heard that what they are searching for 
is to be found in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  so that they show my unimportant person 
much more attention than I deserve because I have performed some small 
services for belief.

Second Truth: I was reminded that in return for the ill-treatment a few 
contemptuous,  deceived  individuals  inflicted  on  us  with  the  intention  of 
insulting us and destroying public regard for us, due to their unfounded sus-
picions of our disturbing public order, was the applause and appreciation of 
innumerable people of reality and forthcoming generations.

THE FLASHES

Yes, through the strength of certain, affirmative belief, in every part of 
this country the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  and its students halt the awesome corruption 
and efforts of anarchy to destroy public order under the veil of communism. 
They work to maintain public order and security so that these twenty years 
three or four related courts and the police of ten provinces have not been 
able  to  find  or  record  any  incidents  involving  the  infringement  of  public 
order connected with the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students, who are very numerous and 
found in every part of the country. And the fair-minded police of three prov-
inces stated: “ The R i s a l e - i   N u r  students are moral police. They assist us in 
preserving  public  order.  Through  certain,  affirmative  belief,  they  leave  in 
everyone’s head who reads the R i s a l e - i   N u r  something that restrains them 
from committing misdemeanours. They work to maintain public order. ”

An example of this was Denizli Prison. When the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  entered 
there and  F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f  was written for the prisoners, within a space of 
three or four months more than two hundred of those prisoners became so 
extraordinarily obedient and acquired such religious and righteous conduct 
that  a  man  who  had  murdered  three  or  four  people  refrained  from  killing 
bedbugs even. They became completely compassionate, harmless members 
of the nation. The officials were astonished at this situation and looked on 
in appreciation. Some youths even said before receiving their sentences: “ If 
the Nurjus remain in prison, we shall try to have ourselves convicted so that 
we can be taught by them and become like them. We shall reform ourselves 
through their instruction. ”

So those who accuse the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students, who are thus, of disturb-
ing public order are surely seriously deceived, or have been fooled, or know-
ingly or unknowingly are deceiving the government on account of anarchy, 
and try to crush and repress us. We say this to them: 

Since  death  is  not  to  be  killed,  and  the  grave  is  not  to  be  closed,  and 
the  travellers  in  this  guesthouse  of  the  world,  convoy  after  convoy  enter 
the earth with great speed and ado, and vanish; for sure we shall part from 
one  another  very  soon.  You  shall  receive  the  penalty  for  your  tyranny  in 
awful fashion. At the very least you shall mount the gallows of death and 
eternal extinction, which form the discharge papers of the oppressed people 
of belief. The fleeting pleasures you have received in this world imagining 
them to be everlasting, will be transformed into everlasting, grievous pains.
Regretfully, our secret dissembling enemies sometimes attach the name 
of  Sufism  to  the  reality  of  Islam,  which  has  been  gained  and  preserved 
through  the  swords  and  blood  of  the  hundred  million  martyrs  at  the  rank 
of saints, and heroic war veterans of this religious nation. While the way of 

TWENTY-SIXTH FLASH

337

Sufism is only a single ray of that sun, they show it to be the sun and deceive 
certain lax government officials. Calling the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students “ Sufis ” 
and “ members of a political society ” – because they work effectively for 
the truths of the Qur’an and belief – they want to incite them against us. We 
say to them, and to those who listen to them against us, what we told the just 
court at Denizli:

“ Let  us  too  be  sacrificed  for  this  sacred  truth  for  which  hundreds  of 
millions of people have been sacrificed! Even if you set fire to the world 
around us, we who sacrifice ourselves for the truths of the Qur’an will not 
lay down our arms before atheism; we shall not abandon our sacred duty, 
Allah willing! ”

Thanks to the sacred solace arising from belief and the Qur’an for the 
pains  and  despair  at  the  adventures  of  my  old  age,  I  would  not  exchange 
this most distressing year of my old age for ten of the happiest years of my 
youth  –  especially  since  for  those  who  repent  and  perform  the  obligatory 
prayers each hour in prison is the equivalent of ten hours’ worship, and with 
respect  to  merit,  each  transient  day  spent  in  illness  and  under  oppression 
gains ten days of perpetual life. I thus understood from those warnings just 
how deserving of thanks are these days for someone like me awaiting his 
turn at the door of the grave. I exclaimed: “ Endless thanks be to my Sus-
tainer! ”, and was happy at my old age and pleased with my imprisonment. 
For life does not stop, it passes swiftly. If it passes in pleasure and happiness, 
since the passing of pleasure is pain, it becomes transient, passing without 
thanks and in heedlessness; leaving sins in the place of pleasures, it departs. 
Whereas if it passes in prison and hardship, since the passing of pain is a 
sort of pleasure, and since it is considered to be a sort of worship, it becomes 
perpetual in one respect, and through its good fruits gains everlasting life. 
It becomes atonement for the mistakes that were the cause of past sins and 
imprisonment, and purifies them. From this point of view, the prisoners who 
perform the compulsory parts of the obligatory prayers should offer thanks 
in patience.

SIXTEENTH HOPE

One time in my old age, I was released from Eskişehir Prison after serv-
ing a years’ sentence. They exiled me to Kastamonu,  1 where I stayed for 
two or three months as a guest in the police station. It may be understood 
how much torment someone like me suffered in a place like that, who was a

recluse, wearied by seeing even his loyal friends, and could not endure the 
changes in dress. 1 While suffering this despair, divine grace suddenly came 
to the assistance of my old age. The inspector and police in the police sta-
tion became like firm friends. They not once warned me about not wearing a 
peaked cap, and like my servants, used to take me for trips around the town.
Then I took up residence in Kastamonu’s  R i s a l e - i   N u r  Medrese, oppo-
site the police station, and started to write further parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . 
Heroic  R i s a l e - i   N u r   students  like  Feyzi,  Emin,  Hilmi,  Sâdık,  Nazif,  and 
Salâhaddin, attended the m e d r e s e  in order to duplicate the treatises and dis-
seminate them. We held scholarly debates even more brilliant than those I 
had held in my youth with my old students.

Then our hidden enemies aroused the suspicions of some officials and 
some  egotistical  h o j a s   and  shaykhs  concerning  us.  They  caused  us  and 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  students from five or six provinces to be gathered together in 
the School of Joseph of Denizli Prison. The details of this Sixteenth Hope 
are described clearly in the brief letters I sent secretly to my brothers while 
in Denizli Prison, in those sent from Kastamonu, and in the collection con-
taining the court defence speeches. So referring the details to those letters 
and to my defence speech, I shall allude to it only very briefly here:

I  hid  the  confidential  and  important  collections,  and  particularly  those 
about the Sufyan and the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s wonderworking, under the coal and 
firewood so that they might be published after my death or after the authori-
ties had come to their senses and listened to the truth. Then, when feeling 
easy  at  this,  some  detectives  and  the  assistant  public  prosecutor  suddenly 
raided my house. They pulled out those secret and important treatises from 
under the wood then arrested me and sent me to Isparta Prison, although I 
was in bad health. While greatly upset and sad at the harm that had come 
to the R i s a l e - i   N u r , divine grace came to our aid. The authorities carefully 
and curiously began to read those important treatises which had been hid-
den, of which they were in much need, and the government offices became 
like R i s a l e - i   N u r  study-centres. Although they began to read with the idea of 
criticizing, they appreciated them. In Denizli even, although we were una-
ware of it, numerous people read the printed edition of Ay e t ü ’ l - K ü b r a  ( T h e  
S u p r e m e   S i g n  ),  officially  and  unofficially,  and  strengthened  their  belief. 
This reduced to nothing the calamity of prison we were suffering.

1.  This refers to the compulsory adoption of European dress following the Dress Laws 
passed in the first years of the Republic. The Hat Act of 1925 banned the wearing of all 
headgear other than European-style hats. ( Tr. )

Later they took us to Denizli Prison and put me into solitary confinement 
in a stinking, cold, damp ward. I was most unhappy at my old age and ill-
ness and the difficulties visited on my friends because of me. I was feeling 
most distressed at the confiscations of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and the cessation in 
its activities when divine grace suddenly came to my aid. It transformed that 
huge prison into a R i s a l e - i   N u r  medrese, proving it was a School of Joseph. 
The R i s a l e - i   N u r  started to spread through the diamond pens of the heroes 
of the Medresetü’z-Zehra. 1 The great hero of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  even, in those 
severe conditions, wrote out more than twenty copies of the F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f  
and the D e f e n c e   S p e e c h e s   C o l l e c t i o n  in the space of three or four months. 
The conquests began both within the prison and outside. It transformed our 
losses in that calamity into significant gains and our distress into joy. It once 
again showed the meaning of the verse,

( 2:216 ) . - , + * ) (
Then we were subject to severe criticisms because of the incorrect and 
superficial  statements  of  the  first  experts’  committee,  and  the  Education 
Minister’s savage attacks. A statement was published against us. Then just 
when  according  to  some  reports  they  were  even  trying  to  secure  the  exe-
cution  of  some  of  us,  divine  grace  came  to  our  assistance.  Chiefly,  while 
expecting a severely critical report from the Experts Committee in Ankara, 
they sent a commendatory one. And although they found less than ten errors 
in five chests of copies of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , we proved in court that the points 
they  had  shown  to  be  errors  were  completely  correct  and  that  they  them-
selves had been in error in the matters they said were wrong; we showed 
between five and ten errors and mistakes in their five-page report. And while 
awaiting  severe  reprisals  in  the  face  of  the  F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f   and  D e f e n c e s  
C o l l e c t i o n , which we had sent to seven government offices, and the entire 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  which had been sent to the Ministry of Justice, and especially 
in return for the effective, stinging slaps dealt by the confidential treatises, 
they responded extremely leniently, and like the even consoling letter sent 
to us by the Prime Minister, they were most conciliatory and did not attack 
us. This proved decisively that as a miracle of divine grace, the truths of the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  had defeated them, making them study its treatises as though it 
were a guide. It made those broad circles into a sort of study circle and saved 
the belief of numerous hesitating and bewildered people, causing us spiritual 
joy and profit far exceeding our distress.

Then our hidden enemies poisoned me; and the late Hafız Ali, the mar-
tyr hero of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , went to hospital instead of me, travelled to the 
Intermediate Realm in my place, and made us weep despairingly. Before this 
calamity, on many occasions I had insisted on the mountain at Kastamonu: 
“ My brothers, don’t give meat to the horse and grass to the lion! ” That is 
to say: “ Don’t give all the treatises to everyone, lest they use them to attack 
us. ” Although Hafız Ali ( May Allah have mercy on him ) was around seven 
days away on foot, as though he heard with his spiritual telephone, that same 
time he was writing to me: “ Yes, Ustad, it is a wonder of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
that horses should not be given meat, nor lions, grass. Rather, since horses 
should be given hay, and lions meat, he gave that lion-like h o j a  the treatise 
on sincerity. ” I received his letter seven days later. We worked it out, and 
at the same time I was shouting it out on the mountain, he was writing the 
strange words in his letter.

Thus,  just  at  the  time  that  hero  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   died,  and  we  were 
being pressurized by the secret dissemblers who were trying to have us pun-
ished through their intrigues against us, and we were anxious that I would 
be sent to hospital on official orders because I was ill from poison, divine 
grace came to our assistance. Thanks to the sincere prayers of my blessed 
brothers the danger to my life from the poison passed; and according to pow-
erful signs our martyr was occupied in his grave with the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and 
replied with the R i s a l e - i   N u r  to the questioning angels; and the Denizli hero, 
Hasan Feyzi ( May Allah have mercy on him ), who would work according 
to Hafız Ali’s system and in his place, together with his friends were secretly 
serving the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  effectively; and because the other prisoners were 
being reformed by the R i s a l e - i   N u r , even our enemies supported our being 
released from prison; and like the Companions of the Cave, the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
students turned that place of ordeal into an ascetic’s cave of olden times; 
all this, together with their endeavours in writing out and disseminating the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  with easy hearts, proved that divine grace had come to our aid.
It also occurred to my heart that since a great interpreter of the law like 
Imam  A‘zam  suffered  imprisonment;  and  a  supreme  m u j ā h i d   like  Imam 
Ahmad ibn Hanbal was severely tortured in prison for the sake of a single 
matter of the Qur’an and endured it in perfect patience, yet not remain silent 
about the matter in question; and numerous religious leaders and scholars 
were completely patient and unshaken, offering thanks, despite suffering tor-
ments far greater than yours; for sure you are obliged to offer endless thanks 
for  the  very  few  difficulties  you  suffer,  although  the  reward  you  receive

is great for those many truths of the Qur’an. Yes, I shall describe briefly a 
manifestation of divine grace in the midst of man’s wrongful tyranny:

When  I  was  twenty  years  old  I  used  to  say  repeatedly:  “ Towards  the 
end of my life I shall withdraw from the life of society into a cave or onto 
a  mountain  like  the  people  of  olden  times  who  abandoned  the  world  and 
withdrew into caves. ” Then when in the Great War I was being held as a 
prisoner in the north-east, I took this decision: “ After this I shall spend my 
life in caves. I shall slip away from political and social life. Enough now of 
mixing in them. ” At that point both dominical grace and the justice of divine 
determining were manifested. It transformed the caves I had imagined into 
prisons, places of seclusion, loneliness in places of ordeal and solitary con-
finement in a way far better than my decision and wish, compassionately for 
my old age. It bestowed on me Schools of Joseph and places of solitary con-
finement where my time would not be wasted that were far superior to the 
mountain caves of ascetics and recluses. It gave both the benefits pertaining 
to the hereafter of the cave, and strenuous service of the truths of belief and 
the Qur’an. I had even determined to show myself guilty of some crime and 
remain in prison after my friends had been released. Solitaries like Husrev 
and Feyzi would have remained with me, and on some pretext I would have 
remained  in  the  solitary  confinement  ward  so  as  not  to  meet  with  people 
and waste my time on unnecessary conversation and egotistical artificiality. 
But then divine determining and our fate sent us to another place of ordeal. 
Out of compassion for my old age and in order to make us work harder in 
the service of belief, duties were given us outside our will and power in this 
third School of Joseph, in accordance with the verse, 
. - , + * ) ( and the saying: ُ

Yes, there are three instances of wisdom and important benefits in respect 
of the service of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  in divine grace turning – out of compassion 
for my old age – the caves of my youth, when I had no powerful, hidden 
enemies, into the solitary confinement of prison:

First Instance of Wisdom and Benefit

F i r s t   I n s t a n c e   o f   W i s d o m   a n d   B e n e f i t :  It is only in the School of Joseph 
that the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students can gather together without harm. Outside it 
is expensive and causes suspicion if they meet together. Some who came to 
visit me would spend forty or fifty liras, then see me for only twenty minutes 
or not at all, and would have to return. I would have willingly chosen the 
hardship of prison to be closer to some of my brothers. This means that for 
us prison is a bounty and instance of mercy.

S e c o n d   I n s t a n c e   o f   W i s d o m   a n d   B e n e f i t :  The service to belief at this 
time through the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  has to be through advertising it everywhere 
and attracting the attention of those in need. Attention is drawn to the R i s a l e -
i   N u r  by our imprisonment; it is like an advertisement. The most stubborn 
or most needy find it and save their belief; their obduracy is broken and they 
are saved from danger, and the R i s a l e - i   N u r ’s study-circle is widened.

Third Instance of Wisdom and Benefit

T h i r d   I n s t a n c e   o f   W i s d o m   a n d   B e n e f i t :  The R i s a l e - i   N u r  students who 
are sent to prison learn from one another’s conduct, qualities, sincerity, and 
self-sacrifice, and they no longer seek worldly benefits in their service. Yes, 
since in the School of Joseph they have seen with their own eyes the ten and 
perhaps a hundred benefits gained for every hardship and difficulty, and the 
good results, and the extensive and sincere service to belief, they are suc-
cessful in attaining pure sincerity and no longer lower themselves by seek-
ing minor, personal benefits.

A subtle but sad, yet at the same time agreeable, point concerning these 
places of ordeal that concerns myself only is this: I observe the same situa-
tion here that I saw in the old m e d r e s e s  in my native region in my youth. For 
traditionally in the eastern provinces, some of the m e d r e s e  students’ needs 
were met from outside, and in some m e d r e s e s  their food was cooked in the 
m e d r e s e . There were other ways they resembled this place of ordeal. As I 
watch the prison here, I feel a pleasurable regret and longing, and travel in 
my imagination to those enjoyable times of youth, and forget the difficulties 
of old age.

A Small Point Concerning an Important Verse

It was autumn and approaching the time flies are discharged from their 
duties, and because of their minor annoyance, selfish humans were employ-
ing  chemicals  in  my  prison  cell  in  order  to  eliminate  them.  It  aroused  a 
sharp pity in me. There was a washing-line in my cell. In order to thwart 
the humans the flies multiplied even more. In the evening those miniature 
birds would line themselves up in most orderly fashion on the line. When he 
wanted to hang up the washing, I said to Rüştü: “ Don’t disturb those little 
birds; hang it somewhere else. ” To which he replied, completely seriously: 
“ We need the line; let the flies find somewhere else for themselves. ”

Anyhow...  In  the  early  morning  a  discussion  started  up  in  connection 
with this exchange, about the very numerous small creatures like flies and 
ants. I said the following to him:

The species whose copies are thus numerous have important duties and 
great value, like the copies of a book are multiplied in relation to the book’s 
importance.  That  is  to  say,  the  species  of  flies  have  important  duties  and 
high  value  so  that  the  All-Wise  Creator  has  greatly  multiplied  those  tiny 
missives  of  divine  determining  and  copies  of  the  words  of  divine  power. 

1.  Süleyman Rüştü Çakın, 1899-1974. He was born in Isparta, where he was the Di-
rector of the Tax Assessment Office. He became one of Bediuzzaman’s close students, and 
was imprisoned together with him in Eskişehir and Denizli.

That  is  to  say,  if  those  things  claimed  to  be  gods  by  the  people  of  mis-
guidance were to gather together all causes and false gods apart from Allah 
Almighty, they would be unable to create even a fly. That is, the creation of 
a fly is such a dominical miracle and clear sign of the creative act that even 
if all causes were to assemble they would be unable to make anything like it 
or to duplicate it, and would be unable to dispute that dominical sign.

Flies,  the  significant  subject  of  the  above  verse,  defeated  Nimrod,  and 
when Moses ( Upon whom be peace ) complained about their bothering him, 
saying: “ O my Sustainer! Why have You made these irritating creatures so 
very numerous? ”, the following answer came to him by way of inspiration:
“ You have objected about the flies once while the flies have asked many 
times: ‘O our Sustainer! This man has a huge head, yet he praises You with 
only one tongue, and sometimes he neglects to do that. If you had created us 
out of only his head, there would have been creatures like us praising You 
with thousands of tongues!’ ”

Moreover  the  flies,  which  thus  defended  the  wisdom  in  their  creation 
against Moses’ complaint sufficiently powerfully to withstand a thousand 
such  objections,  also  pursue  great  cleanliness.  These  insects  continually 
wash  their  faces,  eyes,  and  wings  as  though  taking  ablutions,  and  have 
important  duties.  The  common  view  is  short-sighted;  it  is  still  unable  to 
comprehend those duties.

Indeed,  Almighty  Allah  has  created  an  orderly  group  of  carniverous 
beings as public health officials of a sort; they cleanse the seas by gathering 
up the corpses of other sea-creatures 1 that die every day in their millions, and 
prevent the sea from becoming polluted and disgusting with their corpses. If 
those public health officals of the sea did not carry out their extremely regu-

equal the fish that die. Also, the mother fish cannot always superintend her young because 
of the great difference in size between them, and she cannot enter the places they hide. So 
as a manifestation of divine compassion, the All-Wise and Compassionate promotes one 
of the young to supervise the others, and employs the tiny creature in the mother’s duties.

lar duties, the sea would not sparkle like a mirror; it would rather display a 
sad and touching turbidity.

Also, Almighty Allah has created carniverous and carrion-eating birds, 
and wild animals to be like cleansing and public health officials which col-
lect the corpses of the wild animals and birds that die every day in their mil-
lions, cleanse the face of the earth of those putrid remains, and save other 
animate beings from such sad, discomforting sights. Some, like eagles for 
example, through a divine impulse, wonderfully perceive the location of a 
corpse from a distance of five or six hours, though hidden and distant, and 
hasten to remove it. If those health officals of the land were not extremely 
efficient and orderly in carrying out their official duties, the face of the earth 
would become such so as to make all weep.

The licit food of carniverous animals is the flesh of dead animals. The 
flesh of living animals is unlawful for them. If they eat it, they receive pun-
ishment. The Hadith which states: “ Retaliation shall be made for the horn-
less sheep on the horned on Resurrection Day ”  1 points out that although 
the bodies of animals with immortal spirits perish, they will receive reward 
and  punishment  in  a  manner  appropriate  for  them  in  an  eternal  realm.  In 
consequence, it may be said that the flesh  of  live  animals is unlawful for 
wild animals.

Furthermore,  ants  are  employed  as  cleansing  officials  to  collect  the 
corpses of tiny creatures and small particles and fragments of bounty. They 
are given duties as public health officals to preserve tiny particles of divine 
bounty from waste, from being trodden underfoot, contempt and futility, and 
to gather up the corpses of other small creatures.

Similarly, flies are charged with duties of cleaning away poisonous sub-
stances  and  microbes  which  breed  disease  and  are  invisible  to  the  human 
eye. They do not transmit microbes, on the contrary, through sucking up and 
imbibing harmful microbes they destroy them and cause them to be trans-
formed  into  a  different  state;  they  prevent  the  spread  of  many  contagious 
diseases.  A  sign  that  they  are  both  health  workers  and  cleansing  officials 
and  chemists  and  that  they  exhibit  extensive  wisdom  is  the  fact  that  they 
are extremely numerous. For valuable and beneficial things are multiplied. 2

decreed. ”

O you self-centred human being! Apart from the thousands of instances 
of wisdom in the creation of flies, consider the following small benefit that 
concerns you and leave off your hostility towards them. For just as they offer 
you some familiarity in your exile, solitude and loneliness, so do they warn 
you against sliding into heedlessness and your thought wandering. You see 
flies  that  through  their  delicate  manner  and  their  washing  their  faces  and 
eyes as though taking ablutions are giving you a lesson and reminding you 
of human duties like action and cleanliness.

Moreover, bees, which may be thought of as a sort of fly, give you honey 
to eat, the sweetest and most delicate of bounties. And as is stated by the 
Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, they are distinguished by receiving divine 
inspiration. So to be hostile towards them although they should be loved; 
indeed, to be hostile towards creatures that suffer all sorts of difficulties in 
hastening in friendship to assist man, is wrongful and unjust. We may com-
bat harmful creatures only to repel their harm. We fight wolves to protect 
sheep from their attack, for example.

Mosquitoes and fleas fall upon the turbid blood flowing in the veins pol-
luted by harmful substances, indeed they are charged with consuming the 
polluted blood. So in hot weather when there is blood surplus to the body’s 
needs, why should they not be natural cuppers? It is possible...

At  one  time  when  I  was  struggling  with  my  evil-commanding  soul,  it 
was imagining that the bounties it saw in itself to be its own property, and it 
became conceited, proud and boastful. I told it: “ This property is not yours; 
it is on trust. ” So it gave up its conceit and pride but became lazy, it said: 
“ Why  should  I  bother  about  someone  who  is  not  mine?  Let  him  perish, 
what is it to me? ” Suddenly I saw that a fly had alighted on my hand and 
had started to thoroughly clean its eyes, face, and wings, which were its trust 
from Allah. The fly was washing itself just like a soldier cleans his rifle and 
uniform thoroughly, which belong to the state. I said to my soul: “ You look 
at that! ” It looked and learned a good lesson. As for the fly, it became my 
conceited and lazy soul’s teacher and instructor.

Fly excretion is not harmful medically; in fact, sometimes it is a sweet 
syrup. For it is not distant from dominical wisdom, it is indeed a function 
of  that  wisdom,  that  while  flies  contain  thousands  of  harmful  substances, 
microbes, and poisons from what they have eaten, they are like tiny transfor-
mation and purification machines. Apart from bees, there are other species 

TWENTY-EIGHTH FLASH

347

of flying insects 1 that eat various putrid substances and then continuously 
excrete droplets of syrup in place of the filth. By transforming those rotten, 
poisonous substances into a sweet and healing syrup, a confection of divine 
power, that rains onto the leaves of trees, they prove that they are machines 
for transmuting one substance into another. They demonstrate before one’s 
eyes what a mighty nation and group these tiny individuals form. Through 
the tongues of their beings they say: “ Don’t look at our smallness, consider 
the vastness of our species, and declare, ‘All Glory be to Allah!’ ”

1.  At the end of spring there is one species of small fly which is created in the form 
of a black mass that becomes stuck to the branches of almond and wild apricot trees, and 
remains there. In place of waste matter, droplets continuously flow from the flies. These 
drops are like honey and other species of flies gather round them suck them up. 

Another species is employed in the pollination of the flowers of plants and some trees, 
like the fig. Just as the fire-fly is worthy of observation, since it is a sort of fly that flashes, 
sparkles,  and  is  luminous;  so  do  other  species  that  are  gilded  and  glisten  like  gold  de-
serve notice. Also, we must not forget flies armed with lances, and wild bees, which are 
like  brigands.  If  the All-Merciful  Creator  had  not  pulled  in  their  reins,  if  they  attacked 
human beings like fleas, in the same way that those armed species killed Nimrod, they 
would  have  assailed  the  human  race  and  expounded  the  implicit  meaning  of  the  verse,

these  bearing  special  qualities  are  of  great  importance  so  that  this  mighty  verse  makes

As this verse indicates, creation is through a command. The treasuries of 
divine power are in the K ā f . and N ū n . 1 Several of the many aspects of this 
subtle mystery have been mentioned in various places of the R i s a l e - i   N u r . 
Here,  in  order  to  make  more  comprehensible  in  this  century’s  materialist 
view Hadiths about the characteristics, qualities, and material effects of the 
Qur’an’s letters, and particularly the disjointed letters at the start of some 
Suras, we shall illustrate this mystery with a material example.

The All-Glorious One, the Owner of the Sublime Throne, has four thrones 
by which He directs the creatures on the earth, which is like a centre of the 
world and a heart and q i b l a  of the universe:

O n e   is  the  throne  of  preservation  and  life,  which  is  earth.  This  is  the 

manifestation of the divine names of Preserver and Giver of Life.

T h e   S e c o n d   T h r o n e  is the throne of bounty and mercy, which is the ele-

ment of water.

of light.

T h e   T h i r d  is the throne of knowledge and wisdom, which is the element 

T h e  F o u r t h is the throne of will and command, which is the element of air.
We see with our eyes that the minerals and innumerable various plants 
are formed from simple earth, through which are met the innumerable needs 
of animals and human beings – boundless multiplicity from unity with per-
fect order, an infinite variety of species from a simple element, innumerable 
regular embroideries on a plain page. And although water, and especially 
the sperm of animals, is a simple fluid, innumerable miracles of art become 
manifest through it in the many animate creatures. This shows that similarly 
to these two thrones, light and air are the places of manifestation of the won-
drous miracles of the pen of knowledge, command, and will of the Pre-Eter-
nal Inscriber, the All-Knowing One of Glory, despite their simple nature.

For now we shall leave aside the element of light, and in connection with 
our  question  here,  try  to  unveil  a  little  the  marvels  of  command  and  will 
within the element of air, which for the globe of the earth is the throne of the 
divine command and will.

1.  The two letters of the Arabic alphabet in the word ±, that is, “ Be! ” [ trans. ]

With the air in our mouths we sow letters and words which at once sprout 
and send forth shoots. That is to say, in a instant, in no time at all, a word 
becomes a seed in the air, sprouting in the surrounding air and producing the 
shoots of innumerable instances of the same word, great and small, in the 
air all around. We consider the element of air and we see that it is so obedi-
ent and subjugated to the command of ² ± that it is as if like a soldier 
in a regular army, each of its particles is as though ever awaiting its orders, 
demonstrating its compliance with and submission to commands manifested 
from the command of “ B e !  ”, arriving instantaneously from another particle 
far off.

For  example,  the  fact  that  human  speech  may  be  heard  anywhere  in 
the  air  by  means  of  radio  transmitters  and  receivers  –  on  condition  there 
is a receiver – everywhere on earth, at the same moment, instantaneously, 
demonstrates how perfectly each particle of air obediently conforms to the 
manifestation  of  the  command  of ² ±  In  respect  of  sacredness  and 
in  accordance  with  the  mystery  of  compliance,  the  letters,  which  have  an 
unstable existence in the air, may manifest many external effects and mate-
rial qualities.

Innumerable signs like these show that letters, which are the beings of the 
air, and especially sacred and Qur’anic letters, and in particular the letters of 
the divine cyphers at the beginning of some Suras, are orderly and infinitely 
sensitive, and as though listening to the instantaneous commands and acting 
accordingly They therefore surely make the particles of air submit to their 
material qualities and wondrous properties, which reflect the manifestation 
of the command of ² ± and of pre-eternal will.

In  consequence  of  this  mystery,  sometimes  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous 
Exposition describes the works of divine power as though they proceed from 
the attributes of will and speech, meaning that they govern like power apart 
from utter speed of creation, submission of things and subjugation of beings. 
That is to say, the letters proceeding from the creative command govern in 
the existence of beings like a physical force, and the creative command is 
manifested identically with power and will.

Yes, the works of will and the creative command appear to be identical 
with power in beings of this sort whose physical existence is invisible, like 
the air, which is semi-material and semi-immaterial; indeed, they are identi-
cal with power. It is as though the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition decrees,

Å Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ in order to attract attention to 
beings which are an isthmus between the material and the immaterial.

It is thus in keeping with the sacred letters of the divine cyphers like 4  ,  
!  , and ! that they should each be switches among the particles of the 
air  for  causing  the  wires  of  the  hidden,  subtle  relations  to  vibrate  and  so 
be  the  means  of  the  immaterial  sacred  wireless  and  telecommunications 
between the earth and divine throne; it is entirely reasonable that this should 
be their function.

In addition to the duties of all particles of the air dispersed throughout 
the world, their conforming to the commands in connection with such things 
as wirelesses, radios, telephones, and telegraphs, and acting as receivers and 
conductors of subtle forces such as electricity – I conjectured and observed 
even  a  further  duty  in  the  blossom  of  my  almond-tree.  The  state  the  tree 
acquired through the touch of the air in the blowing breeze – with its parti-
cles like receivers conforming to the same command at the same instant – 
and all the trees on the face of the earth like a disciplined army, afforded me 
a conviction as certain as two plus two equals four.

That is to say, the air is a swift and agile servant on the face of the earth, 
tending the guests of the Most Merciful and Compassionate One. Resem-
bling radio and telephone receivers and soldiers under orders, all its parti-
cles deliver the sacred commands of that Most Merciful One to the plants 
and animals. At the command of ² ± they carry out numerous orderly 
duties such as acting as fans for those creatures, aiding their respiration; that 
is, after performing the duty of purifying their blood, the water of life, and 
kindling their bodily heat, the fire of life, they emerge from them and are the 
means of forming words in their mouths.

As a result of this quality of the air, when letters, the beings of the air, 
acquire sacredness; that is, when they take up the position of being receiv-
ers; that is, they take up the position of receivers because they are letters of 
the Qur’an, and become like switches, and even more so when the letters at 
the start of some Suras become the sensitive central switches of those hidden 
relations, just as their existences in the air possess this quality, so their exist-
ences in the mind and even as inscriptions have a share in it. That is to say, 
like physical medicines, healing cures and other purposes may be achieved 
by reading and writing those letters.

so as to hunt down a manifestation of those points, I shall say a few 
words as though encircling them. ]

First Word: In respect of being a divine attribute like knowledge and 
power,  pre-eternal  speech  is  infinite.  Certainly,  if  the  seas  were  ink  for 
something infinite, they would never get to the end of them.

Second  Word:  Speech  is  the  clearest  and  most  powerful  thing  that 
makes known someone’s existence. Hearing someone’s speech proves that 
he exists as clearly as a thousand proofs, indeed, as clearly as seeing him. 
Thus through its allusive meaning, this verse says:

“ If the seas were ink to the extent of divine speech, which demonstrates 
the  All-Glorious  Sustainer’s  existence,  and  the  trees  were  pens,  and  they 
were to write His speech, they would never come to the end of them. That 
is to say, just as any speech points to its own extent and at the degree of 
witnessing to the existence of the one who spoke it, so the extent that the 
above speech points to and tells of the One who spoke it – the Single and 
Eternally Besought One – is beyond measure, so that if all the seas were ink 
they would still be insufficient for writing it. ”

Third Word: When teaching the truths of belief to all classes of men, the 
Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition apparently repeats the same truth, which 
is in accordance with the wisdom of establishing, verifying, and convincing 
them of a truth. This verse is in effect an answer to the entirely unjustifiable 
attacks of the Jewish scholars, who were the learned People of the Book of 
the  time,  on  the  Illustrious  Prophet  ( UWBP )  concerning  this,  because  he 
was unlettered and not learned. It is as follows:

352

THE FLASHES

The  verse  says:  “ The  repetition  of  a  truth  containing  numerous  bene-
fits and results in different and miraculous ways for numerous instances of 
wisdom, such as verification and persuasion, does not arise from restricted 
speech or intellectual deficiency or lack of capital. Nor does the repetition 
of such matters as the pillars of belief comprising thousands of truths each 
of  which  is  infinitely  valuable,  in  order  to  establish  them  in  the  hearts  of 
the mass of people in particular. For the Qur’an proceeds from the endless, 
infinite pre-eternal treasury of divine speech, and being turned to the Mani-
fest World on account of the World of the Unseen, speaks with man and the 
jinn, spirits, and the angels, resounding in the ears of each person. If the seas 
were ink, sentient beings scribes, plants pens, and particles the pens’ nibs 
for counting the words of pre-eternal speech, the source of the Qur’an, they 
would still never come to the end of them. For they are finite, while divine 
speech is infinite. ”

Fourth  Word:  It  is  clear  that  the  issuing  of  speech  from  something 
unexpected increases the speech’s effectiveness and makes it heeded. The 
speech-like voices of large bodies like the clouds and the atmosphere in 
particular  make  everyone  listen  to  them.  The  sounds  of  a  gramophone 
the  size  of  a  mountain  would  attract  attention  even  more.  The  heavenly 
voice of the Qur’an, which takes the levels of the heavens as gramophone 
records, issues forth to make the head of the globe of the earth listen to 
it. And with the power of the radio, the molecules of air become like the 
receivers and transmitters of its letters. The verse alludes to the fact that 
the air molecules each become mirrors, tongues, needle points, and ears 
for the All-Wise Qur’an’s letters, and indicates how important, valuable, 
significant,  and  living  those  letters  are,  saying:  “ The  Qur’an,  which  is 
divine speech, is so living and valuable that if all the seas were to become 
ink,  and  the  angels  scribes,  and  minute  particles  points,  and  plants  and 
hairs pens to the number of the ears that listen to it and hear it, and to the 
number  of  the  sacred  words  that  enter  those  ears,  they  could  still  never 
come to the end of them. ”

No,  they  could  never  come  to  the  end  of  them,  because  if  Almighty 
Allah multiplies man’s weak, lifeless speech millions of times in the air, 
for sure each word of the speech of that Peerless Sovereign of the Heavens 
and Earth, which looks to all the earth and the heavens and addresses all 
the conscious beings within them, will comprise words to the numbers of 
particles of air.

Fifth Word: This consists of two letters.
T h e   F i r s t   L e t t e r :   Just  as  the  divine  attribute  of  speech  has  words,  so 
does power have embodied words, and knowledge too has wise words of 
divine  determining;  these  consist  of  all  beings.  Living  beings,  and  small 
creatures  in  particular,  are  each  dominical  words  which  point  to  the  Pre-
Eternal Speaker in a way more powerfully than speech. If the seas were ink 
they could never come to the end of them. That is, the verse looks to this 
meaning too in allusive fashion.

T h e   S e c o n d   L e t t e r :  All the inspiration received by angels and men, and 
even by animals, are divine speech of a sort. Its words are certainly infinite. 
It means that the verse is telling us how numerous and infinite are the inspi-
rations  and  words  of  divine  command  which  the  innumerable  cohorts  of 
absolute sovereignty continually receive.

[ A brief reply to a question about the above verse, which has come to 
have great importance, for with it a prominent person with knowledge 
of modern science silenced a number of h o j a s . ]

Q u e s t i o n :  It is normally said that iron is mined from the earth, so why 
is  it  said  in  this  verse  اَ(cid:179)ـْ(cid:170)َزْ(cid:178)َا  or  “ r e v e a l e d  ”  rather  than  We  excavated  or 
extracted; this appears to be inappropriate? 

The Answer: With the phrase اَ(cid:179)ـْ(cid:170)َزْ(cid:178)َا the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposi-
tion recalls the vast and important bounty of iron. For it does not consider 
iron only for itself so that it should say extracted, but recalls the tremendous 
divine bounty in iron and how needy mankind is for it. Its aspect of being 
a bounty does not come upwards from below, but down from the treasury 
of mercy. The treasury of mercy is certainly elevated, above, and at a high 
level,  so  the  bounty  descends  from  above;  and  needy  mankind’s  level  is 
surely below. The bestowal of bounty is superior to need, so the correct way 
to express the fact that bounty comes from the treasury of mercy to meet 
mankind’s need is اَ(cid:179)ـْ(cid:170)َزْ(cid:178)َا it is not We extracted.

Also,  since  the  gradual  extraction  of  iron  is  at  man’s  hand,  the  word 
extract does not alert the heedless person to its aspects of bounty. If what 
is meant is iron’s material substance, it is extracted in respect of its physi-
cal  situation.  But  iron’s  quality  of  being  a  bounty,  which  is  the  intended 
meaning here, is immaterial. This meaning looks not to physical situation, 
but to immaterial degree or level. Bounties proceeding from the treasury of 
mercy, which is a manifestation of the infinitely exalted degree of the Most 
Merciful, are certainly sent down from the highest level to the lowest. Thus, 
the correct expression is اَ(cid:179)ـْ(cid:170)َزْ(cid:178)َا it recalls to mankind that iron is one of the 
greatest divine bounties.

Yes, iron is the source of all mankind’s industries, and of its advance-
ment and progress, and the means of its power and strength. So in order to 
call to mind this tremendous bounty and bestowal of favour, in lofty style 
the Qur’an states:

 3 2 1 0 / . -

TWENTY-EIGHTH FLASH

355

In a similar way it declares about David’s (UWP) important miracle:

( 34:10 ) a ` _
That is to say, it points out the softening of iron, a great miracle and great 
bounty for a great prophet.

S e c o n d l y :  Above and below are relative. They are above and below in 
relation to the earth’s centre. In fact, something which is below in relation to 
us is above from the point of view of the American continent. This means the 
situation of substances coming from the earth’s centre to its surface changes 
according to the position of people on the surface.

With the tongue of miraculousness, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition 
states that iron contains so many benefits and has such extensive uses that it 
is not some common substance to be extracted from the store of the globe, 
and  that  it  is  not  some  natural  substance  to  be  used  for  any  chance  need. 
Rather,  in  order  to  express  iron’s  general  uses  it  states  that  it  is  a  bounty 
stored up by the Creator of the Universe in the treasury of mercy and huge 
workshop of the universe which He sent down through His majestic title of 
Sustainer of the Heavens and Earth to meet the needs of the earth’s inhabit-
ants. It is as if, like rain, heat, and light, which descend from the skies, it 
contains such all-embracing advantages that it was sent from the workshop 
of the universe, not from the narrow store of the earth. It was sent having 
been prepared in the great treasury of mercy in the palace of the universe, 
and situated in the store of the globe, from which it is extracted little by little 
over the centuries in proportion to need.

The Qur’an of Mighty Stature does not want to express the iron which is 
extracted bit by bit from this small store only as being utilized, but as being 
sent down together with the globe of the earth from the supreme treasury, as 
a tremendous bounty. That is to say, the thing most necessary for the house 
of the earth is iron, for when the All-Glorious Creator separated the earth 
from the sun and sent it down for mankind, He sent down iron together with 
it, and met most of mankind’s needs with it. The All-Wise Qur’an decrees in 
miraculous fashion: “ Use this iron in your works and try to excavate it and 
take advantage of it. ”

The verse describes two bounties; both the repulsion of enemies and the 
attraction of benefits. Iron was put to important human uses before the rev-
elation of the Qur’an, but with the phrase, 1 0 /  it points out that 
in the future, it would be used for travelling through the sea, air, and land, 

356

THE FLASHES

and would subjugate the globe wondrously and astonishingly, and demon-
strate a wondrous death-tainted strength. Thus of its various sorts of miracu-
lousness, it displays a flash of miraculousness in its predicting the future. 

While discussing the above point, the subject of Solomon’s Hoopoe came 
up. A persistent questioner from among our brothers 1 asked: “ What is the 
reason for the Hoopoe describing Almighty Allah with a relatively insignifi-
 ( 27:25 ) G F E D C while there 

cant attribute in the sentence,
are more significant divine attributes?

The Answer: One aspect of eloquence is to make understood the occu-
pation or craft with which the speaker is mostly employed. Like the nomad 
diviners who intuitively discover the places where water is to be found in 
the Arabian Peninsula, Solomon’s Hoopoe, a diviner from among birds and 
animals, was a blessed bird who was employed in various duties and also 
found water for Solomon ( Upon whom be peace ), so it could be used. It is 
stating through the measure of its own art that Almighty Allah proves His 
fitness to be worshipped and prostrated before by making known the things 
hidden in the heavens and earth.

Yes,  the  Hoopoe  understood  it  well,  for  the  natural  inclination  of  the 
incalculable numbers of seeds and minerals under the earth is not to emerge 
upwards from below. Because since such beings lack life and will, they can-
not  go  upwards  of  their  own  accord;  on  their  own,  they  can  only  tumble 
downwards.  A  body  concealed  under  the  heaviness  of  the  earth  certainly 
could  not  shake  that  heavy  load  off  its  shoulders  on  its  own  and  emerge 
upwards. It means that it does so through a wondrous power.

The Hoopoe understood through his divining this most hidden and impor-
tant of the proofs of divine fitness to be worshipped, so that the All-Wise 
Qur’an imparted a miraculousness to its statement concerning it.

This verse comprises the same point we explained in the discussion of the

By saying in Sura al-Zumar, /. - , + * )  and not say-
ْ(cid:202)ا  َنِ(cid:174)  ْمﯭﯧَ(cid:170)  َقَ(cid:171)َ(cid:114)َو the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposi-

tion is stating: “ Eight sorts of blessed animals have been sent down to you 
from the treasury of mercy, as though they were bounties of Paradise. ” Yes, 
those blessed animals are a gift for mankind with all their  parts, for their 
wool or hair is made into the mobile homes and clothes of nomads, whole-
some food is made from their flesh, delicious sustenance is had from their 
milk, shoes and so on are made from their hides, cultivated land is nourished 
by their manure and men make fuel from it. It is as though those blessed 
animals are pure bounty and embodied mercy.

It  is  because  of  this  that  like  rain  is  called  “ mercy ”  ( r a ḥ m a  ),  these 
blessed beasts are called “ bounty ” ( a n ‘ ā m  ). As though just as embodied 
mercy becomes rain, so too embodied bounty takes on the form of goats, 
sheep,  cattle,  water-buffalo,  and  camels.  For  sure  their  physical  bodies 
are  created  on  the  earth,  but  since  the  attribute  of  being  bounties  and  the 
meaning of mercy have totally predominated over their physical beings, in 
accordance with the phrase اَ(cid:179)ـْ(cid:170)َزْ(cid:178)َا the All-Compassionate Creator sent down 
these blessed animals directly from the exalted degree of His mercy and His 
elevated, immaterial Paradise, as gifts from the treasury of mercy.

Sometimes art of high worth is present in material worth virtually noth-
ing. It is given value in respect of the art, not of the material’s value, like the 
tiny material being of a fly and the sublime dominical art within it. Some-
times valuable material worth five l i r a  contains art worth nothing; then the 
material predominates.

In just the same way, sometimes in some physical material the meaning 
of bounty and mercy is found to such a degree that it is a hundred times more 
important than the material. The physical matter is quite simply hidden and 

358

THE FLASHES

its  aspect  of  bounty  predominates.  Thus,  just  as  the  vast  benefits  of  iron 
and the many products it yields conceal its material aspect, so too bounty 
being present in every member of the blessed animals mentioned above has 
transformed their physical matter into bounty. It is because of this that their 
immaterial attributes have been considered, and their physical beings disre-
garded, and this is expressed with the phrases, - and, -
These two phrases state the above-mentioned point both in regard to real-
ity, and they miraculously express an important meaning in respect of elo-
quence. It is as follows:

Together  with  its  extremely  tough  nature,  and  its  being  hidden,  fre-
quently  deep  underground,  iron  is  found  everywhere,  bestowed  with  the 
quality of being easily softened. Everyone can therefore obtain it easily eve-
rywhere for everything. In order to express this, it states through the phrase 
. - that iron tools are are obtained so easily they are as though sent 
down from a workbench above as natural, heavenly bounties, and placed in 
man’s hand.

Furthermore, although some animal species, from the mosquito to snakes, 
scorpions, wolves, and lions are harmful to human beings, large beasts like 
the  water-buffalo,  ox,  and  camel,  who  are  important  among  animals,  are 
extremely docile and submissive. So much so they may be led by even a 
child. To express the idea of their submissiveness, the verse 
, + * )  states  that  being  neither  wild  nor  dangerous,  these 
blessed beasts do not resemble worldly animals. They are rather useful and 
harmless like paradisaical animals. They have been sent down from above, 
that is, from the treasury of mercy.

Perhaps  this  is  why  some  Qur’anic  commentators  have  said  that  these 
animals have been sent down from Paradise. It is hardly prolix to write a 
whole page about a single letter of the All-Wise Qur’an,  1 for it is Allah’s 
Word. It has therefore not been wasteful to write two or three pages on the 
expression - Sometimes one letter of the Qur’an is the key to a treasury.
1.    What  some  Qur’anic  commentators  intended  by  saying  “ Their  origins  were 
the  heavens ”  was  this:  the  continued  existence  of  the  animals  known  as  “ a n ‘ ā m  ”  is 
through sustenance, and their sustenance is fodder. The fodder’s sustenance is rain. Rain 
is  the  water  of  life  and  mercy;  so  sustenance  also  comes  from  the  heavens. The  verse, 
( 51:22 ) z y x alludes to this. Since those animals’ continually renewed existences 
 اَ(cid:179)ْ(cid:170)َزْ(cid:178)َأ is apt, for it expresses the 
lie in the rain which comes from the skies, the expression 
meaning of having been sent down from the sky.

Pieces Written in Eskişehir Prison
as a True Solace for the Risale-i Nur Students 

My Dear Brothers!
I was exceedingly unhappy for you; I was crushed by grief. But it was 
imparted to me that divine determining and your fate have given you this 
prison’s water to drink and bread to eat, all together. I saw that as a mark of 
divine mercy and manifestation of dominical favour, your eating this bread 
together  and  drinking  this  water  was  the  easiest,  lightest,  best,  and  most 
meritorious of ways; that this prison was a most beneficial place of instruc-
tion for the R i s a l e - i  N u r  students, and a most effulgent place of ordeal; that it 
was a most exacting place of examination teaching just how essential it is to 
act prudently in the face of one’s enemies. I saw it in the form of a luminous 
place of study and t e k k e  for learning and benefiting from the elevated quali-
ties and fine characteristics of our friends here, which are all different, and 
to establish and renew the brotherhood between them. I did not complain 
about this situation therefore, but offered thanks with all my spirit. Yes, our 
way is thanks. And it is to see an aspect of mercy, an aspect of bounty, in 
everything.

From your brother who is grieved

A Rule
R i s a l e - i  N u r  students should not seek light outside the circle of the R i s a l e -

the immaterial sun giving light through the window of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , and 
perhaps lose the sun.

Also, the pure and powerful way of friendship and brotherhood within 
the circle of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which gains numerous spirits for each person 
and through the mystery of the legacy of prophethood depicts the Com-
panions’ way of brotherhood, leaves no need for seeking a spiritual guide 
or  father  outside  that  sphere,  in  a  way  that  is  harmful  to  them  in  three 
respects;  it  provides  many  a ğ a b e y s   that  is,  elder  brothers,  in  place  of  a 
single  father.  The  joint  compassion  of  elder  brothers  reduces  a  father’s 
compassion to nothing.

360

THE FLASHES

Someone who has a shaykh before entering the R i s a l e - i   N u r  circle may 
keep him after entering it. But the person who does not, may only seek a 
guide  within  the  circle.  Moreover,  the  knowledge  of  reality  taught  within 
the circle of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which offers the effulgence of the legacy of 
prophethood, the greater sainthood, leaves no need for the Sufi orders out-
side that circle – unless of course they are self-indulgent people who misun-
derstand the way of Sufism, are addicted to pleasant dreams and imaginings, 
lights and spiritual pleasures, and desire worldly, fanciful pleasures which 
are different to the virtues of the hereafter, and want a rank where people 
have recourse to them.

This world is the abode of labour and service; recompense is commensu-
rate with hardship and difficulty; it is not a place of reward. The people of 
reality attach no importance, therefore, to the pleasures and lights of illumi-
nations and wonderworking. Indeed, they sometimes flee them and want to 
conceal them.

Furthermore, the R i s a l e - i  N u r ’s circle is very broad, and its students, very 
numerous.  It  does  not  seek  anyone  who  depart  from  it.  It  gives  them  no 
importance and perhaps will not again admit them. Everyone has only one 
heart, and a single heart cannot be both within the circle and outside it.

Also, those desirous for guidance outside should not busy themselves 
with the R i s a l e - i  N u r  students. For they may receive harm in three respects. 
Those people who are within the bounds of fear of Allah do not need guid-
ance, but outside it there are abundant people who do not perform the five 
daily prayers. To leave aside the latter and busy oneself with the former is 
not guidance. If such a person loves the students, let him firstly enter the 
circle and be not a father, but a brother, and if he is very virtuous, an elder 
brother.

It  has  also  become  apparent  from  this  incident  that  attachment  to  the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  holds much importance and has a high price. If he is sensible, 
the person who gives this price and takes up a position striving against irre-
ligion in the name of the Islamic world, will not abandon this way which is 
as valuable as diamonds, and embrace other ways.

aspects to the wrongs that are visited on us: one is man’s aspect, the other, 
divine determining’s. In the same event, man does wrong, but divine deter-
mining  is  fair  and  acts  in  justice.  In  this  matter  of  ours,  we  should  think 
more of the justice of divine determining and mystery of divine wisdom than 
man’s tyranny and wrongdoing.

Yes, divine determining summoned the R i s a l e - i  N u r  students to this gath-
ering. And the wisdom in this was the unfolding of their striving and strug-
gle, which drove them to this truly very distressing School of Joseph. Man’s 
tyranny and pretexts were the means. So beware, do not say to one another: 
“ If I had not done such-and-such I would not have been arrested. ”

instance of dominical protection and divine preservation, and was a favour 
of the Most Merciful corroborating the wondrous predictions concerning the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  of Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) and Ghawth 
al-A‘zam ( May Allah be pleased with him ). The hands of forty-two of our 
innocent, wronged brothers raised in supplication to the divine court halted 
a missile directed at them, turned it back and in effect exploded it over the 
heads of those who had fired it. Our losses amount to only a few minor cuts 
and bruises which will gain us reward. It is a marvel to be saved with such 
minor injury from a gun that was being charged for the past year. One should 
respond with thanks and joy to such a great bounty. After this our lives will 
not be our own, for according to the plans of the spreaders of corruption, we 
were to be completely wiped out. That means after this we should pledge 
our lives not to ourselves, but to truth and reality. We should try to always 
see the trace, face, and essence of mercy in things, which will cause us not 
to complain, but to offer thanks.

S a i d   N u r s i

I request of my brothers that they are not offended at one another due to 
discomfort, or distress of the spirit, or fastidiousness, or being deceived by 
Satan’s wiles, or at the offensive language uttered by some of them. They 
should not say that their honour has been insulted. I take upon myself any 
bad words that are spoken. They should not be offended. If I had a hundred 
honours, I would sacrifice all of them for love and cordiality among my 
brothers.

THE FLASHES

My Brothers!
I have understood certainly the last two or three days that unfortunately 
we suffered a blow from divine mercy. I understood even that one of the 
many indications of a verse concerning the people of rebellion looks to us. 
It is this:

( 6:44 ) Ù   ... Î Í Ì Ë Ê
That is, “ When they forgot the instruction and advice with which we have 
warned them and did not act in accordance with it, We took hold of them and 
afflicted them with disaster. ”

Yes,  recently  we  were  prompted  to  write  a  treatise  on  the  meaning  of 
sincerity. In truth, it was a most luminous and exalted rule of brotherhood, 
a sacred principle which allows ten men to withstand calamities and events 
which normally could only be withstood with the strength of tens of thou-
sands.  But  unfortunately  we,  and  foremost  myself,  did  not  act  in  accord-
ance with the warning. In accordance with the allusive meaning of the verse, 
according to the science of j a f r , the value of Ù is one thousand three 
hundred and fifty-two. We were arrested on the same date. Some of us suf-
fered a slap dealt by divine compassion. Others suffered, not such a blow, 
but were included in these tribulations in order to be a solace to our brothers 
who did suffer it, so that it might be a means of earning reward and profit.

For three months I was barred from mixing with others, but for the past 
three days I have been able to learn my brothers’ states of mind. An unim-
aginable incident had occurred opposed to the meaning of sincerity involv-
ing brothers whom I had supposed to be the most sincere. I understood from 
this that an allusive meaning of the verse, Ù   ... Î Í Ì Ë Ê 
looked to us from afar. For the people of misguidance, for whom the verse 
was revealed, it is punishment, but for us it is a blow from divine compassion 
in order to train our souls, as atonement for sins, and so that we may raise 
our spiritual degrees. Evidence that we suffered this blow because we did 
not completely appreciate the value of the divine bounty we had received is 
that we were not contented with our sacred service of the Qur’an through the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , a most sacred striving in Allah’s way which receives the efful-
gence of ‘greater sainthood’ through the mystery of the legacy of prophet-
hood and is a means to attaining the essence of the way of the Companions. 
Through my severe warnings on several occasions, the wish to join a Sufi 
order  was  forestalled,  the  advantages  of  which  are  very  few  for  us  at  the 

TWENTY-EIGHTH FLASH

moment and could possibly have caused us much harm in this situation. Oth-
erwise, both our unity would have been destroyed, and it would have caused 
both differences in ideas which would have reduced the value of four a l i f s  
– which through solidarity is one thousand one hunded and eleven – to four, 
and mutual antipathy, which would have reduced our strength to nothing.

The author of the G u l i s t a n , Shaykh Sa‘di Shirazi, relates: “ I saw one of 
the people of the heart in a t e k k e  while occupied with his spiritual journey-
ing. Several days later I saw him among students in the medrese. I asked 
him why he had left the effulgent t e k k e  and come to the religious school. He 
replied that there everyone could save themselves, if they were successful, 
whereas here in the religious school persons of high aspiration were trying 
to save many others besides themselves. Nobility and high endeavour were 
theirs; virtue and exertion were theirs; that was why he went there.

Shaykh Sa‘di wrote a summary of this in his G u l i s t a n .
So if the small matter of students parsing verbs is superior to the reci-
tations  in  the  t e k k e s ,  since  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   teaches  in  the  clearest  and 
most certain manner the sacred truths of belief of the confession of faith: 
ِر ِ(cid:114)ٰ
ّ(cid:195)اِ(cid:92)   ُتْ(cid:179)َ(cid:174)ٰا  and  silences  the  most 
obdurate  atheists  and  obstinate  philosophers,  to  abandon  it,  or  cause  its 
activities to come to a standstill, or not to be content with it, and desiring the 
Sufi way to enter the dissolved Sufi t e k k e s  without asking permission of the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r , is entirely wrong and shows how much we deserve this blow 
of divine compassion.

A Warning

S a i d   N u r s i

[ Two short stories ]

The First: Fifteen years ago when a prisoner-of-war in the north of Rus-
sia I was being held together with ninety other officers in a large factory. 
Numerous  arguments  and  disturbances  arose  due  to  the  discomfort  and 
oppressive conditions. I used to pacify them, since they all had great respect 
for  me.  I  appointed  four  or  five  officers  to  keep  the  peace,  telling  them: 
“ Whenever you hear an uproar, go there and help whichever side is in the 
wrong. ” It is a fact that with this precaution a stop was put to the noise. They 
asked me why I helped those who were in the wrong. In reply I told them:

ٰ
366

THE FLASHES

People in the wrong are unfair. They do not give up a single benefit for 
the sake of public peace forty times greater. Whereas the person who is 
in the right is fair. He sacrifices and waives his own right, worth little, for 
the advantage of his friend, which is part of the public peace and worth 
much. The disturbance ceases and peace is restored. The ninety people in 
this ward can be comfortable. If the person in the right is helped, the noise 
would increase even more. In communal life of this sort, the general good 
takes precedence.

And so, my brothers! In this communal life of ours, do not say: “ I am fed 
up with my brother, for he’s been unfair to me. ” To do so is a great error. If 
such a friend of yours has caused you a little harm, your being angry with 
him causes us harm of high cost. It is possible it would even cause excessive 
harm to the Risale-i Nur. But, praise be to Allah, with our friends being pre-
vented from repeatedly going to be questioned, no harm came to our power-
ful and rightful defences. Otherwise like getting something as tiny a fly’s 
wing in one’s eye or a spark falling into gunpowder, due to a little pique 
brothers who are vexed with one another can cause a great deal of harm.

Second  Story: There was once an elderly woman who had eight sons. 
She gave each of them a loaf of bread from the loaves she had, but none 
remained for herself. So each of them gave her half his loaf. She then had 
four loaves, while theirs was reduced to half a loaf.

My brothers! I feel in myself half the pains of the share in this calamity 
of each of the forty of you. I take no notice of my own hardships. One day 
I felt excessively afflicted and studied my previous position wondering if I 
was paying the penalty for some error I had committed. I saw that I had no 
part at all in the fomenting and incitement of this calamity; on the contrary 
I had employed every possible means to avoid it. That means it is a divine 
decree. It has been planned against us by intriguers over the past year, and 
made  inevitable.  It  was  not  possible  to  avoid  it.  It  was  inevitable  that  we 
should be embroiled in it. A hundred thousand thanks to Almighty Allah that 
He reduced the calamity from a hundred to one.

In consequence of this fact therefore, do not blame me saying “ We are 
suffering this disaster because of you! ” Forgive me rather, and pray for me. 
And do not criticize each other, saying: “ If you had not done such-and-such, 
this would not have happened. ” For example, with one of our brothers men-
tioning two or three signatures, the plan the mischief-makers were hatching 
in order embroil numerous people in a calamity, was restricted and many 
were saved from it. It was the cause not of harm, but of great advantage. It 
resulted in many innocent people being saved from this disaster.

[ This piece is very valuable. Everyone may benefit from it as far as the 
Second Point. ]

In  connection  with  certain  unpleasant  situations  which  come  about  in 
Eskişehir Prison, not through bad morality but because of the distress, this is 
about one fine point of a well-known verse that has remained undisclosed, 
and a point concerning good behaviour.

FIRST POINT
Out of His perfect munificence, compassion, and justice, Almighty Allah 
has  included  in  good  works  an  immediate  reward  and  in  bad  actions  an 
immediate punishment. He has included in good works spiritual pleasures 
that recall the rewards of the hereafter, while in bad works are spiritual pen-
alties which recall the torments of Hell. 

For  example,  love  between  believers  is  a  praiseworthy  action  for  the 
people of faith. Included in that good work are a spiritual pleasure, a grati-
fication, an ease of mind that recall the physical rewards of the hereafter. 
Anyone who refers to his heart will feel this pleasure.

And for example, enmity and hostility between believers are an evil that 
cause noble spirits to feel torment of the conscience enough to overwhelm 
the heart and spirit. I myself have experienced it perhaps more than a hun-
dred times: when I have felt enmity towards a believing brother I have suf-
fered such torment that it has left me in no doubt that it was the immediate 
punishment for my evil deed.

And for example, to be respectful towards those worthy of respect, and 
compassionate to those worthy of compassion, and to assist them, are good 
works,  good  deeds.  They  hold  a  pleasure  and  gratification  so  great  they 
make felt the rewards of the hereafter. And they so increase the respect and 
compassion they make the person ready to sacrifice his very life. The plea-
sure and reward a mother receives through the compassion she feels for her 
child may be so great she will sacrifice her life due to it. The hen who attacks 
a lion in order to save her chick is an example of this truth in the animal 
kingdom. This means that there is an immediate reward in compassion and 
respect. Magnanimous people of high aspiration feel it, and for this reason 
assume their heroic attitude.

And for example, in greed and wastefulness is such a punishment that, 
afflicting his heart and spirit, it makes man complaining and anxious, and 
bewilders him. And in jealousy and envy is such an immediate punishment 
that it scorches the one who feels them. While in contentment and reliance 

368

THE FLASHES

on Allah is such an immediate, pleasurable reward that it dispels all the pains 
and tribulations of poverty and indigence.

And for example, in pride and conceit is a heavy burden, for the proud 
man wants respect from everyone. And because he is despised due to this 
desire,  he  suffers  constant  torment.  Yes,  respect  is  given,  it  may  not  be 
sought. 

And for example, in humility and the giving up of egotism is a pleasur-
able reward by which a person is saved from the heavy burden of trying to 
make himself liked.

And for example, in pessimism and always interpreting things unfavour-
ably is an immediate punishment in this world. In accordance with the rule, 
“ Whoever  strikes  is  struck, ”  those  who  think  unfavourably  of  others  are 
also  thought  of  unfavourably.  The  actions  of  those  who  misinterpret  the 
actions of their believing brothers are also misinterpreted, and they suffer 
the punishment for it.

And  so  on,  all  good  and  bad  deeds  should  be  measured  according  to 
this yardstick. I beseech divine mercy that those who witness the Qur’anic 
miraculousness manifested at this time in the R i s a l e - i   N u r , experience these 
spiritual pleasures; they will not suffer from bad morals, Allah willing.

( 51:56-58 ) Z Y X W V  U T  * R Q
For a long time these verses worried my mind, since according to many 
Qur’anic commentaries their apparent meaning did not reflect the Qur’an’s 
elevated miraculousness. I shall now explain briefly three aspects of their 
extremely  beautiful  and  exalted  meanings,  which  proceed  from  the  efful-
gence of the Qur’an.

The  First:  Sometimes  Almighty  Allah  attributes  to  Himself  certain 
states that could pertain to His Messenger, so as to honour and exalt him. 
Here  too,  the  verses, H G F E D C  have  this  meaning: 

TWENTY-EIGHTH FLASH

369

“ My Messenger does not want a wage, recompense, or reward, or to be fed 
in return for his duty of messengership and conveying to you the obligations 
of worship; ” they refer to the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ) being given food and sustenance. Otherwise it would be making 
known something self-evident and clear, and would be incompatible with 
the Qur’an’s miraculous eloquence.

The  Second  Aspect:  Man  is  excessively  preoccupied  with  his  suste-
nance. So lest he is deluded into making his winning it a pretext for neglect-
ing worship, or making it an excuse, the verse says: “ You were created for 
worship. The result of your creation is worship. Winning sustenance is wor-
ship of a sort, from the point of view of its being a divine command. I have 
undertaken  to  provide  your  sustenance  and  that  of  your  families  and  ani-
mals, my creatures; it pertains to me; you were not created to procure food 
and sustenance, for I am the Provider. I provide the sustenance of my ser-
vants, your dependants. So do not make it an excuse and give up worship! ”
If its meaning is not this, it becomes a statement of the obvious, for to 
provide Almighty Allah with food and sustenance is self-evidently impos-
sible. It is an established rule of rhetoric that if the meaning of a sentence is 
clear and obvious, it is not that meaning which is intended, but a meaning 
necessitated by it and dependent on it. For example, if you say to someone: 
“ You  are  a  h â f ı z , ”  it  is  stating  the  obvious.  The  intended  meaning  is  “ I 
know that you are a h â f ı z . ” You are informing him because he did not know 
that you knew. 

Thus, in consequence of this rule, the meaning of the verse, in which the 
prohibition of giving food to Almighty Allah is a metaphor, is this: “ You 
were not created in order to produce food for My creatures, which are Mine 
and the providing of whose sustenance I have undertaken. Your fundamen-
tal duty is worship. But to strive to procure sustenance in accordance with 
My commands is also a sort of worship. ”

The Third Aspect: In Sura al-Ikhlas the apparent meaning of, 

 ( 112:3 ) , + * )
is  self-evident  and  obvious,  hence  another  meaning  is  intended  which  is 
necessitated by it. That is to say, Almighty Allah states extremely clearly 
and  self-evidently  , + * )  meaning:  “ Anyone  who  has  a 
father and mother cannot be a god, ” and, “ pre-eternal and post-eternal, ” to 
deny the divinity of Jesus ( UWP ), and of Uzayr, and the angels, and stars, 

370

THE FLASHES

and other false gods. It is just the same with our example, the verse, “ The 
All-Glorious  Provider,  your  object  of  worship,  does  not  require  suste-
nance for Himself, you were not created to provide Him with food ” means: 
“ Things with the ability to receive sustenance and food cannot be gods and 
objects of worship, ” meaning: “ Beings that are in need of sustenance and 
being provided for are not worthy of worship. ”

( 7:4 ) J I H
This  was  written  in  connection  with  Re’fet  being  curious  and  ask-
ing  about  the  word J  –  slept  for  their  afternoon  rest  –  in  the  verse, 
J I H and to prevent his diamond-like pen becoming idle in prison, 
and lethargic, as a result of sleeping after the morning prayer like the others.

Sleep is of three sorts:
The First is G h a y l ū l a . This is from pre-dawn to forty minutes or so after 
the sun has risen, the time when prayer is lawful but reprehensible. Sleep at 
this time is contrary to the Practices of the Prophet ( UWBP ), since accord-
ing to Hadiths, it leads to a decrease in livelihood and its being unfruitful. 
The most appropriate time for preparing to earn one’s living is when it is 
cool. One is overcome by lethargy when this has passed. It has been estab-
lished by many experiences that this is both detrimental to the day’s labour 
and indirectly to one’s livelihood, and is the cause of unfruitfulness.

The  Second  is  F a y l ū l a .  This  is  from  the  afternoon  prayer  till  sunset. 
Sleep  at  this  time  leads  to  a  diminution  of  life,  that  is,  it  makes  life  that 
day shorter and pass in a state of semi-sleep and drowsiness, thus causing a 
physical deficiency to life. Moreover, immaterially, since most of the day’s 
results, material and immaterial, become apparent after the afternoon prayer, 
to pass that time in sleep as though prevents the results being reaped and the 
day becomes as though unlived.

The Third is Q a y l ū l a , which is in accord with the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) 
practices. 1 It is from mid-morning to just past noon. Such sleep is Sunna 
since it allows a person to rise at night to pray. So too it is the custom in 
the Arabian Peninsula to rest from work at noon when it is intensely hot, 
corroborating this practice of the Prophet ( UWBP ). This sleep augments 
both life and sustenance. For half an hour’s Q a y l u l a  sleep is the equivalent 
of two hours’ sleep at night. This means it adds one and a half hours’ to 
a person’s life every day. It saves one and a half hours from the hand of 
sleep, the brother of death, and gives it life, increasing the time of working 
for one’s livelihood.

I saw that the world of the night is like a newly opened dwelling of the 
world. I entered it during  ‘ I s h a , the prayer at nightfall. Since man is con-
nected to all the world, through an extraordinary expansion of the imagina-
tion I saw the mighty world that night as a dwelling. Living creatures and 
men became so tiny they were invisible. I observed with the imagination that 
the only thing that inhabited the dwelling and made it familiar, and filled it 
with light, was the collective personality of Muhammad ( UWBP ). As a per-
son greets those present when he enters a house, I was overwhelmed with the 
desire to say: “ Endless peace be upon you, O Messenger of Allah! ” 1 It was 
as though I was greeting him to the number of all men and jinn. That is to 
say, I offered greetings, meaning: I renew my allegiance to you, accept your 
mission, submit to the laws and commands you brought, and state through 
the greetings that they will be safe from our assaults, and making speak all 
the  parts  of  my  world  and  all  jinn  and  men,  all  conscious  beings,  I  offer 
greetings in their name.

As  he  illuminated  my  world  through  the  light  and  gift  he  brought,  so 
he illuminates and fills with bounties the worlds of everyone in this world. 
In grateful response for the gift, I exclaimed: “ Endless blessings be upon 
you! ” That is, “ We cannot respond to this goodness of yours, so we show 
our gratitude to you by beseeching that mercy be bestowed upon you from 
our Creator’s treasury of mercy, to the number of the inhabitants of the heav-
ens. ” I perceived this meaning in my imagination.

In respect of his worship and on account of his being turned from cre-
ation  to  Creator,  the  person  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP )  requires  blessings 

1.  The divine mercy received by Muhammad ( UWBP ) looks to the needs of all his 
community  through  all  eternity.  For  which  reason,  endless  greetings  are  appropriate.  If 
someone enters a vast house like the world, desolate and empty and dark due to heedless-
ness, how frightened and dismayed he will be. Then suddenly the house is lit up and a 
familiar, friendly, lovable and beloved Lieutenant appears in the forefront. If he describes 
and makes known the house’s Compassionate and Generous Owner through all its fittings 
and furnishings, you can understand what joy, familiarity, happiness, light, and ease it will 
give. From this you may appreciate the value and pleasure of the greetings for the Mes-
senger ( UWBP ).

which have the meaning of mercy. While in respect of his messengership 
and  being  the  envoy  sent  from  Creator  to  creation,  he  requires  peace.  He 
is worthy of peace to the number of jinn and men, and we offer a general 
renewal of our allegiance to their number. So too he is worthy of blessings 
from the treasury of mercy to the number of the inhabitants of the heavens 
and in the name of all of them. For it was through the light he brought that 
the perfections of all things became apparent, and the value of beings was 
made manifest, and the dominical duties of creatures could be observed, and

My Dear Brother!
You want an explanation of the Unity of Existence. In one of the F l a s h e s  
of the Thirty-First Letter there is a very powerful and elucidating answer to 
Muhyiddin’s ideas concerning this matter. For now we just say the following:
Teaching this question of the Unity of Existence to people at the present 
time causes serious harm. Like when metaphors and similes pass from the 
hands of the learned to those of the common people and knowledge passes 
from scholars to the ignorant, they are thought to be literally true, 1 so when 
elevated truths such as the Unity of Existence pass to the heedless and to 
the common people submerged in causes, they are thought to be nature, and 
cause three significant instances of harm.

The First: The way of the Unity of Existence is quite simply to deny 
the universe on account of Almighty Allah. Despite this, when it is adopted 
by the heedless common people and enters their ideas which are tainted by 
materialist thought in particular, it leads to denial of the Godhead on account 
of the universe and materiality.

The Second: The way of the Unity of Existence rejects the dominicality 
of anything other than Allah so vehemently that it denies everything other 
than Allah and removes duality. Since it does not recognize the independent 
existence of anything, let alone that of evil-commanding souls, with the pre-
dominance of the idea of nature at this time and pride and egotism inflating 
the evil-commanding soul and causing the hereafter and the Creator to be 
forgotten,  to  inculcate  the  Unity  of  Existence  in  people  whose  evil-com-
manding souls are small pharaohs and quite simply are disposed to taking 
their own selves as their objects of worship, so inflates the evil-commanding 
soul that – I seek refuge with Allah – it can no longer be contained. 

The Third: While the All-Glorious One is free and exempt from, pure of 
and exalted above all change, alteration, division, and being comprehended 
in time or place, the Unity of Existence gives rise to conceptions that are not 
fitting for His necessary existence, holiness, and being free of all defect, and 
leads to false teachings. Yes, if one who speaks of the Unity of Existence 
rises in the mind from the ground to the Pleiades, leaves the universe behind 
and fixes his gaze on the sublime throne, ecstatically reckoning the universe 
to be non-existent, through the strength of his belief he may see everything to 
be directly from the Single One of Unity. But the person who stands behind

the  universe  and  looks  at  it,  and  sees  causes  before  him  and  looks  from 
the ground may possibly become submerged in causes and immersed in the 
swamp of nature. The person who rises in the mind to the divine throne may 
say like Jalaluddin Rumi: “ Listen! The words you hear uttered by everyone, 
you may hear as uttered by Almighty Allah, like natural gramophones. ” But 
if you say to the one who cannot rise as high as Jalaluddin, nor see all beings 
from the ground to the divine throne in the form of mirrors: “ Listen! You 
will hear the divine speech from everything, ” he will in effect fall from the 
throne to the ground, and will also be afflicted by false imaginings contrary 
to the truth!

T h e   A n s w e r   t o   a   Q u e s t i o n

I do not have the time to weigh up the ideas of Mustafa Sabri 1 and those 
of Musa Bekûf. 2 I shall only say this much, that the one went to one extreme 
and  the  other,  to  the  other  extreme.  Mustafa  Sabri  was  right  relatively  to 
Musa Bekuf, but it is not right to denigrate someone like Muhyiddin who 
was a miracle of the Islamic sciences.

Yes, Muhyiddin was himself rightly-guided and acceptable, but should 
not be the guide and instructor with all his works. Since he very often pro-
ceeded in the realities without balance, he opposed the rules of the Sunnis 
and  some  of  the  things  he  said  apparently  denote  misguidance.  However, 
he himself was free of misguidance. A word may sometimes appear to be 
unbelief, but the one who speaks it is not an unbeliever. Mustafa Sabri did 
not take these points into consideration; he was extreme concerning certain 
points of Sunni law, due to bigotry.

As for Musa Bekûf, he was excessively in favour of renewal; because 
of  this  and  the  concessions  he  made  to  modernity  in  respect  of  his  ideas, 
he was very much in error. He corrupted some of the truths of Islam with 
his false interpretations. He went far to excess by maintaining that some-
one rejected like Abu’l-A‘lā al-Ma‘arrī was superior to authoritative schol-
ars,  and  favouring  disproportionately  matters  stated  by  Muhyiddin  which 
oppose the Sunnis because they suited his own ideas.

Muhyiddin  said:  اَ

ّ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174)   َسْ(cid:193)َ(cid:170)   ْنَ(cid:174)  ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150)  اَ(cid:179)ِ(cid:93)ُ(cid:99)ﯭﯦ  ُةَ(cid:151)َ(cid:170)اَ(cid:143)ُ(cid:174)  ُمَرْ(cid:111)ُ(cid:98)  : ِن(cid:192)ّ

ِد(cid:170)ا   ِىْ(cid:111)ُ(cid:174)   َلاَ(cid:162) 
“ Other people who are not one of us and do not know our station should not 
read our books, for it may be damaging for them. ” Yes, it is harmful to read 
Muhyiddin’s books at the present time, especially the matters related to the 
Unity of Existence.

I shall explain a matter that unfolded before the gaze of my imagination 
one  glittering  night  of  the  festival,  while  watching  from  my  prison  win-
dow  through  the  lens  of  prudence  and  foresight  the  laughter  of  mankind 
that would turn into tears. As the lives of people of previous ages who lie 
in the graveyard may be seen in the cinema, so I as though saw the moving 
corpses of people who would inhabit it in the near future. I wept for those 
merrymakers.  All  of  a  sudden  a  feeling  of  desolation  and  pity  came  over 
me. I turned to my intellect and asked of reality: “ What is this imagining? ” 
Reality replied, saying:

In fifty years time, out of the fifty who are now laughing and enjoying 
themselves with such joy five will be bent and stooping seventy-year-olds, 
while forty-five will have rotted in the graveyard. Those beautiful features 
and joyful smiles will have been transformed into their opposites. According 
ّلﯭﯦ since it is to some degree true that things that 
are going to happen in the near future are seen to have already arrived, then 
surely what you see is not imagination.

to the rule of  ٌب(cid:192)ِرَ(cid:162)  ٍتٰا  ُ

Furthermore, since the heedless laughter of this world veils bitter facts 
that thus turn it into tears, and is temporary and subject to decline, most cer-
tainly it is only thankful, innocent enjoyment within the bounds of the licit, 
which leads to awareness of Allah’s presence and dispels heedlessness, and 
pleasures that will be permanent by reason of their reward that will cause 
joy to wretched man’s eternity-worshipping heart and his spirit, which has 
an irresistible desire for immortality, and make them smile.

It is because of this that there are among the narrations many that strongly 
encourage thanks and remembrance of Allah at festival times, in order to 
prevent heedlessness from prevailing and deviation into the illicit. To do this 
at such times may transform the bounties of joy and happiness into thanks 
and make the bounty continue and increase it. For thanks increases bounty 
and dispels heedlessness.

The person who loves himself – if his evil-commanding soul has not been 
purified – will love no one else. Even if he does apparently, he does not do 
so sincerely, but only for the pleasure of it or for some good he receives. He 
always tries to make himself liked. Also, he never ascribes faults to himself; 
he defends and exonerates himself like a lawyer. He praises himself, exag-
gerating and even lying, showing himself to be free of fault, as though sanc-
tifying himself, and according to his degree receives a slap from the verse, 

( 25:43 ) Ä Ã Â Á
His  self-praise  and  efforts  to  make  himself  liked  have  the  reverse  effect, 
for he attracts contempt and is treated coldly. He also loses sincerity in his 
actions that look to the hereafter and they become mixed with hypocrisy. He 
is defeated by the emotions and desires of the soul, which are blind to the 
consequences, do not think of results, and are obsessed with present pleas-
ure; he serves a year’s prison sentence due to one hour’s pleasure demanded 
by  his  emotions,  which  have  gone  astray.  He  pays  ten  years’  penalty  on 
account of one minute’s pride or revenge. Quite simply like a silly child who 
sells the portion of the Qur’an he is learning to buy a single sweet, in order to 
flatter his emotions, gratify his senses, and satisfy his appetites, he makes his 
diamond-like good deeds the means to egotistical pleasures as insignificant 
as fragments of glass, and he loses out in profitable works.

A   Q u e s t i o n

How can incarceration in Hell for an infinite duration in return for unbe-

lief for a short duration be justice?

T h e   A n s w e r :  Reckoning a year to be three hundred and sixty-five days, 
the  law  of  justice  requires  for  a  one-minute  murder,  seven  million  eight 
hundred  and  eighty-four  thousand  minutes’  imprisonment.  So,  since  one 
minute’s unbelief is like a thousand murders, according to the law of human 
justice, someone who lives a life of twenty years in unbelief and dies in that 
state  deserves  imprisonment  for  fifty-seven  billion,  two  hundred  and  one 
thousand two hundred million years. It may be understood from this how 
conformable with divine justice is the verse, 

( 4:169 ) °  ¯  ®
The  reason  for  the  connection  between  these  two  numbers,  so  far 
from  one  another,  is  this:  since  murder  and  unbelief  are  destruction  and 
aggression, they have an effect on others. A murder which takes one minute 
negates on average at least fifteen years of the victim’s life, so the murderer 
is  imprisoned  in  their  place.  While  since  one  minute  of  unbelief  denies  a 
thousand  and  one  divine  names  and  denigrates  their  inscriptions,  violates 
the rights of the universe and denies its perfections, and gives the lie to innu-
merable evidences of divine unity and rejects their testimony, the unbeliever 
is cast down to the lowest of the low for more than a thousand years, and 
¥ in imprisonment.

the court passed judgement on 19th August, 1935 was one hundred and fif-

the one hundred and fifteen people found guilty coincides with the number 
exactly, showing that the calamity visited on the R i s a l e - i   N u r  students and

An important point concerning verses like these will be explained in con-
nection with criticisms made by the people of misguidance. It is as follows:
Spies from among the jinn and satans eavesdrop on events in the heavens, 
and  like  soothsayers,  mediums,  and  some  spiritualists,  convey  news  from 
the World of the Unseen. So that their giving information about the Unseen 
should not give rise to any doubts when the Qur’an was first revealed, their 
continual espionage was prevented to a greater extent and they were repulsed 
by shooting stars. The following is a brief reply to an extremely important 
question  in  three  parts  concerning  the  above  verses,  which  are  about  this 
subject.

Q u e s t i o n :  It is understood from verses like these that spying satans infil-
trate the distant lands of the heavens in order to learn of some minor and 
even personal event in the Unseen. Rumours of such minor events as though 
spread everywhere in those vast lands, and any satan anywhere may hear a 
confused version of them and pass it on. However, reason and science can-
not accept such a thing.

Also, it is said that some of the people of prophethood and some wonder-
workers as though pluck the fruits of Paradise from nearby, which according 
to definite verses of the Qur’an, is above the heavens, and they sometimes 
gaze  on  Paradise  from  near  at  hand.  This  matter,  which  concerns  infinite 
distance within infinite proximity, is not conformable with the understand-
ing of the present age.

Also,  the  unimportant  situation  of  an  unimportant  person  being  the 
subject of discussion in the Sublime Assembly in the universal, vast land 
of  the  heavens  is  not  conformable  with  the  wisdom  of  the  utterly  wise 

382

THE FLASHES

administration of the universe. Nevertheless, these three matters are consid-
ered to be among the truths of Islam.

The Answer:
F i r s t l y :   In  the  seven  ‘Steps’  of  the  treatise  called  the  Fifteenth  Word, 
the repulsion and ejection with stars of diabolical spies from the heavens, 
expressed by the verse,

  _ ^ ] \ [ Z Y X
is  proved  so  certainly  with  seven  premises  that  it  convinces  the  obdurate 
materialist, silencing him and forcing him to accept it.

S e c o n d l y :  We shall allude to those three truths which are supposed to be 
far from the reason with a comparison that will bring them close to narrow 
minds. 

For  example,  if  a  state’s  Army  Office  is  in  the  east  of  the  country,  its 
Ministry of Justice in the west, its Education Ministry in the north, its Reli-
gious Affairs Department in the south, and its Civil Service in the centre, 
and  each  department  and  ministry  communicates  and  is  connected  with 
the others by means of radio, telephone, and telegraph in most regular and 
orderly fashion, the whole country will quite simply be its Army Office the 
same as it is its Ministry of Justice, and will be its learned establishment as 
it is its Civil Service.

And  for  example,  it  sometimes  happens  that  numerous  countries  and 
states  whose  capitals  are  different  have  sovereignty  over  a  single  country 
in different ways, through colonies, or concessions, or trade. Although the 
country’s  subjects  and  nation  are  one,  through  its  concessions,  each  state 
has  connections  with  them.  The  affairs  of  those  states,  which  are  distant 
from one another, touch on each other; they come close to each other in all 
the  houses  of  the  country,  and  they  share  in  each  of  its  people.  Its  minor 
matters are seen in a minor sphere in its points of contact. For each minor 
matter is not taken from the universal sphere. But when those minor matters 
are discussed, they are mentioned as though they are taken from the univer-
sal sphere, since they are directly in accordance with the universal sphere’s 
laws; they are given the form of a matter discussed in that sphere.

Like these two comparisons, although the land of the heavens is extremely 
distant in respect of its centre and capital, it has immaterial telephones reach-
ing the hearts of men in the land of the earth. Furthermore, it does not only 
look to the corporeal world, but in one respect encompasses the Manifest 
World since it comprises the Spirit World and World of the Inner Dimension 
of Things.

TWENTY-EIGHTH FLASH

383

The sphere of influence of Paradise too, which is from the world of eter-
nity  and  everlasting  realm,  stretches  out  and  spreads  in  luminous  fashion 
beneath the veil of the manifest, despite its infinite distance. Just as although, 
through  the  wisdom  and  power  of  the  All-Wise  and  Glorious  Maker,  the 
centres of the senses in man’s head are all different, each governs the body 
taking it under its disposal; so the universe, the macroanthropos, comprises 
thousands of worlds one within the other like concentric circles. Sometimes 
the  situations  and  events  that  occur  in  them  are  the  object  of  attention  in 
respect of their universality and particularity and insignificance and immen-
sity; that is to say, those particulars are to be seen in particular, near places, 
while the universals and immense matters are seen in universal, vast stations.
However, sometimes a minor, particular event occupies a vast world. In 
whichever corner of the world you listen, you will hear about it. And some-
times  some  vast  mobilization  is  not  against  the  enemy’s  forces,  but  for  a 
show of pomp and majesty. For example, the event of Muhammad ( UWBP ) 
and sacred occurrence of the Qur’an’s revelation were the most important 
events in the land of the heavens and were bruited in every corner of it. Then 
there were more falling stars, which was a dominical sign proclaiming the 
degree of splendour of the Qur’anic revelation and its glittering sovereignty 
and the degree of its truthfulness, which could be penetrated by no doubt, 
and was expressed and illustrated by the sentries posted on the distant, tow-
ering  bastions  of  the  vast  heavens  raining  down  missiles  to  drive  off  and 
repulse the devils. The Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition expounds and pro-
claims that cosmic proclamation, and alludes to those heavenly signs.

Yes, such a tremendous heavenly sign, and the spying satans, who being 
made  to  do  battle  with  the  angels  although  they  could  have  been  blown 
away  at  the  puffing  of  an  angel,  was  surely  to  show  the  majesty  of  the 
Qur’anic  Revelation’s  sovereignty.  Also,  this  splendid  exposition  of  the 
Qur’an and vast heavenly mobilization indicate that there was nowhere the 
jinns and devils could interfere on the long way from the heart of Muham-
mad ( UWBP ) to the world of the heavens and the Sublime Throne, not that 
the jinns and satans possess some power which drove the inhabitants of the 
heavens  to  fight  them  and  defend  against  them.  The  Qur’anic  Revelation 
was a truth discussed by all the angels in the heavens; in order, the satans 
were compelled to rise to the heavens to draw close to it a little, but were 
not successful and were repulsed. This shows that the Revelation that came 
to  the  heart  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP ),  and  Gabriel  who  came  to  his  pres-
ence, and the truths of the Unseen which appeared to his gaze, were sound 

384

THE FLASHES

and straight and could be pierced by no doubts. The Qur’an of Miraculous 
Exposition tells this in miraculous fashion.

As for Paradise being seen from very close despite its great distance and 
being  part  of  the  World  of  Eternity,  and  sometimes  fruits  being  plucked 
from it, this transient world and Manifest Realm is a veil to the World of the 
Unseen and Everlasting Realm as may be understood from the above two 
comparisons. Paradise may be seen everywhere by means of the mirror of 
the World of Similitudes, despite the distance of its supreme centre. So too, 
where there is belief at the degree of ‘absolute certainty’, Paradise may have 
sorts of colonies and ministries in this transient world – if there is no mistake 
in the comparison – and by means of the telephone of the heart, may com-
municate with elevated spirits, and its gifts may come to them.

As  for  a  universal  sphere  being  preoccupied  with  particular,  personal 
matters;  that  is  to  say,  satans  rising  to  the  heavens  and  eavesdropping  in 
order to bring reports of the Unseen to soothsayers, and their bringing false, 
confused news, as is described in Qur’anic commentaries, it must be as fol-
lows: it is not a question of their going as far as the capital of the land of 
the heavens and gathering particular news; but of there being certain places 
resembling police outposts – if the metaphor is not mistaken – in the country 
of the heavens, which encompasses the atmosphere. In these they have rela-
tions with the country of the earth. The satans eavesdrop on particular events 
in those particular places. The human heart even is one such place, where the 
angel of inspiration and personal devil do battle. 

Also,  however  particular  the  truths  of  belief  and  the  Qur’an  and  the 
events connected with Muhammad ( UWBP ), they are as though the greatest 
and most universal and important events and are published at the Sublime 
Throne and in the sphere of the heavens, the most universal sphere, in – if 
the comparison is not mistaken – the newspapers of the appointed events of 
the universe. They are discussed on every corner. Since from the heart of 
Muhammad ( UWBP ) to the sphere of the throne there is no way the satans 
can  interfere,  they  do  nothing  apart  from  listening  to  the  heavens.  Thus, 
the verse proclaims and shows most eloquently, indeed, miraculously, how 
elevated and true are the Qur’anic revelation and prophethood of Muham-
mad ( UWBP ), and that it is in no way possible to oppose them or draw close 
to them with subterfuge or falsehood.

Preface 
Thirteen years ago, my heart combined with my mind and urged me to 
the way of reflective thought which the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition 
commands with such verses as,

ﯯﯧَ(cid:159)َ(cid:98) 1 states 
that on occasion an hour’s reflection may be equivalent to a year’s worship. 
It  also  offers  powerful  encouragement  for  reflective  thought.  For  myself, 
in order to preserve the extensive lights and lengthy truths which appeared 
to my mind and heart during the thirteen years I have followed this way, I 
recorded a number of phrases by way of indications, not to point out those 
lights but to indicate their existence, facilitate reflection, and preserve the 
order. I used to recite the phrases to myself verbally in varying Arabic terms 
when I embarked on the reflection. Although repeated thousands of times 
over  this  long  period,  I  never  became  wearied,  nor  did  the  pleasure  they 
afforded diminish, nor the spirit’s need of them lessen. For since the reflec-
tion all consisted of flashes from Qur’anic verses, the qualities of not causing 
weariness and preserving their sweetness, which are qualities of the verses, 
were represented in the mirror of that reflective thought.

I  realized  recently  that  the  powerful  source  of  life  and  brilliant  lights 
in  the  various  parts  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   are  flashes  of  those  sequences  of 
thought. Thinking that they would affect others as they had affected me, I

life. For sure, important parts of them have been included in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
but a further power and value will be found in them in their totality.

Since  the  end  of  life  is  not  clear,  and  since  the  conditions  here  of  my 
imprisonment have taken on a form worse than death, not waiting for my life 
to end, on the insistence and importunity of my brothers I have written those 
sequences of thought without changing them, as seven chapters.

[ The remaining six chapters of this F l a s h  have been published in hand-
duplicated editions of T h e   F l a s h e s , and not included here. ]

THE THIRD CHAPTER

On the Degrees of ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ

ّ(cid:195)َا

We  shall  mention  seven  of  its  thirty-three  degrees.  An  important  part 
of those degrees have been expounded in the Second Station of the Twen-
tieth Letter, at the end of the Second Stopping-Place of the Thirty-Second 
Word, and at the beginning of the Third Stopping-Place. Those who want 
to understand the reality of those degrees should refer to those two parts of 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r .

1.  This third degree considers a flower and a beautiful woman. The huge spring is a 
flower, and so is Paradise. They are the places of manifestation of this degree. The world 
is a vast, beautiful human being. Houris, and spirit beings, animals, and men, all as realms 
of being, bear the meaning of a human being; through their pages, they display the divine 
names this degree depicts.

The Thirtieth Flash 

This, the Thirtieth Flash of the Thirty-First Letter
and a fruit of Eskişehir Prison, consists of six points 

[ Just as M e y v e   R i s a l e s i  ( T h e   F r u i t s   o f   B e l i e f  ) was the supreme lesson 
of the Denizli School of Joseph, and E l - H ü c c e t ü ’ z - Z e h r â  ( T h e   S h i n i n g  
P r o o f  ) was a most valuable lesson of the Afyon School of Joseph, so 
too this Thirtieth Flash, which expounds six points about the six divine 
names bearing the greatest name was a powerful lesson of the greatest 
importance of the Eskişehir School of Joseph.

Everyone will not immediately understand and appreciate the profound, 
extensive  matters  in  the  pieces  about  the  names  of  Ever-Living  and 
Self-Subsistent from the greatest name, but they will not remain with-
out a share of them either. ]

THE FIRST POINT
The Divine Name of Most Holy 

[ This point concerns one aspect of the divine name of Most Holy. It is 
appropriate that it should form an addendum to the Addendum of the 
Thirtieth Word. ]

(cid:2)(cid:3)

( 51:48 ) Ë Ê É È 
One manifestation of the divine name of Most Holy, which is one mean-
ing of the above verse and is a greatest name or one of the six lights con-
tained in the greatest name, became clear to me at the end of the month of 
Sha‘ban in Eskişehir Prison. It demonstrated with complete clarity both the 
divine existence and divine unity. I saw it as follows:

404

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF MOST HOLY

405

The universe is a vast, constantly working factory and the globe of the 
earth a hostel and guesthouse which is continually filled and emptied. Gen-
erally, factories, hostels and guesthouses which are thus used become much 
dirtied and soiled with filth, debris and rubbish, and putrid matter accumu-
lates in all parts of them. They cannot be occupied unless they are kept with 
care  and  cleaned  and  swept;  human  beings  are  overwhelmed  by  the  dirt. 
The factory of the universe and guesthouse of the earth, however, are totally 
pure, clean and spotless, and completely unsoiled, untainted and fresh; there 
is nothing unnecessary, nothing without benefit, not a random piece of dirt 
to be found. Even if there is apparently, it is quickly thrown into a transfor-
mation machine and cleaned.

This means that the One who looks after this factory does so very well. 
Its  Owner  is  such  that  He  sweeps  and  cleans  and  orders  the  vast  factory 
and extensive palace as though they were small rooms. Considering the size 
of the huge factory, there is no dirt or rubbish remaining from its filth and 
debris. Indeed, its cleanness and tidiness are remarkable.

If someone does not wash himself and clean his small room for a month, 
they will become extremely dirty and soiled. That is to say, the cleanliness, 
purity, and luminosity in this palace of the world arise from a continuous, 
wise, and diligent cleaning. If it were not for this cleaning, sweeping and 
careful tending, in one year all the hundred thousand animal species would 
have been choked on the face of the earth.

Also, the debris of the globes in space and the heavens, which manifest 
destruction and death, and of satellites and stars, would have smashed not 
only our heads and those of the other animals, but also the head of the earth 
itself and of our world. They would have rained down on our heads rocks 
the size of mountains and driven us away from our homeland in this world. 
However, for a long time past, if as a warning a few meteorites have fallen 
as a result of destruction and reconstruction in those lofty worlds, they have 
not broken any heads.

Furthermore, the corpses of hundreds of thousands of animal species and 
the debris of two hundred thousand plant species each year on the face of 
the earth resulting from the alternation and struggles of life and death would 
have so utterly filthied the land and the sea that conscious creatures, rather 
than loving and delighting in the face of the earth, would have felt disgust 
and aversion at such ugliness and fled to death and non-existence.

Just as a bird cleans its wings with ease and a scribe his pages, so too the 
wings of the aircraft of the earth and the birds of the heavenly bodies and 

406

THE FLASHES

the  pages of the book of the universe are cleaned and made beautiful. So 
much so that people who do not consider the infinite beauty of the hereafter 
and  think  with  belief  become  lovers  of  this  cleanliness  and  beauty  of  the 
world, they worship it.

That is to say, this palace of the world and factory of the universe dis-
play a greatest manifestation of the divine name of Most Holy whereby it 
is not only the carniverous cleaners of the seas and the eagles of the land 
which obey the commands proceeding from that sacred cleansing, but also 
its cleansing officials which gather up corpses, like worms and ants. Like 
the red and white blood-corpuscles flowing in the body obey those sacred 
commands and do the cleaning in the body’s cells, so does breathing purify 
and clean the blood.

And as eyelids obey the command to clean the eye and flies to brush their 
wings, so the extensive atmosphere and the clouds obey it. The air blows 
upon the pieces of dust and soil settled on the surface of the earth and cleans 
it. The sponges of the clouds sprinkle water on the garden of the earth and 
dampen the dust and soil. Then, so as not to dirty the sky, the air quickly col-
lects the earth’s rubbish and the clouds withdraw and hide themselves with 
perfect orderliness. They display the beautiful face and eye of the skies as 
swept and polished, all sparkling and shining.

And  as  the  stars,  elements,  minerals,  and  plants  obey  the  command  to 
clean, all particles and atoms obey it: they pay attention to cleanliness within 
the astonishing upheavals of change and transformation. They never congre-
gate anywhere unnecessarily and get in the way. If they do become soiled, 
they are quickly cleaned. They are impelled by a hand of wisdom to acquire 
the cleanest, neatest, and most shining states and the most beautiful, pure 
and subtle forms. 

Thus, this single act, that is, making clean, which is a single truth, is a 
greatest  manifestation  of  a  greatest  name,  the  name  of  Most  Holy,  which 
shows itself in the maximum sphere, that is, throughout the universe. Like 
the sun, it shows directly to eyes that are far-seeing and broad-sighted the 
divine existence and unity together with the most beautiful divine names.

It has been established with decisive proofs in many parts of the R i s a l e -
i   N u r  that the act of ordering and order, which are a manifestation of the 
names of Sapient and All-Wise; and the act of weighing and balance, which 
are a manifestation of the names of Justice and All-Just; and the act of adorn-
ing  and  munificence,  which  are  a  manifestation  of  the  names  of  Beaute-
ous and All-Generous; and the act of sustaining and bestowal, which are a 

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF MOST HOLY

407

manifestation of the names of Sustainer and Most Compassionate are each 
a single truth and a single act in the vast sphere of the world, they therefore 
demonstrate the necessary existence and unity of a Single Being. In exactly 
the same way, the act of purifying and making clean, which is a manifesta-
tion and display of the name of Most Holy, demonstrates like the sun both 
the existence of the Necessarily Existent One, and like daylight, His unity.

And as the wise acts of ordering, balancing, adorning and making clean 
mentioned above point to a Single Maker by reason of their unity of kind in 
the maximum sphere, so most of the beautiful names, indeed, the thousand 
and  one  names,  each  have  such  a  greatest  manifestation  in  the  maximum 
sphere. And the act proceeding from that manifestation points to the Single 
Unique One with clarity and decisiveness in relation to its extensiveness.

The  self-evident  truths  and  single  acts  that  illuminate  the  face  of  the 
universe and make it smile, such as the universal wisdom that causes all 
things to conform to its law and order, the comprehensive munificence that 
adorns all things and causes them to smile, the all-embracing mercy that 
makes all things pleased and happy, the universal providing of sustenance 
which nurtures and gives pleasure to all things, and the life and giving of 
life which connects each thing with all things and makes each thing benefit 
from,  and  to  some  extent  own,  all  things  –  these  self-evident  truths  and 
single acts point as plainly as light points to the sun to a single All-Wise, 
All-Generous,  and  All-Compassionate  One,  a  single  Sustainer,  a  single 
Ever-Living Giver of Life.

If  those  hundreds  of  extensive  acts,  each  of  which  is  a  clear  proof  of 
Allah’s unity, are not attributed to the Single Unique One, each necessarily 
becomes  impossible  in  hundreds  of  respects.  For  example,  let  alone  such 
self-evident truths and single evidences as wisdom, providence, mercy, sus-
taining and giving of life, if only the act of making clean is not attributed 
to the Creator of the universe, then the following becomes necessary in the 
unbelieving way of the people of misguidance:

Either all the creatures connected to cleansing from particles and flies to 
the elements and the stars would have to have the ability to know and con-
sider the adorning, balancing, ordering, and cleansing of the vast universe and 
would act accordingly, or each would have to possess the sacred attributes 
of the world’s Creator, or each would have to be present at a consultative 
meeting the size of the universe in order to regulate the equilibrium of the 
adorning and cleansing of the universe and its incomings and outgoings, and 
innumerable particles, flies, and stars would have to be participants in the 

408

THE FLASHES

meeting; and so on. Hundreds of superstitious, nonsensical and sophistical 
impossibilities  like  these  would  have  to  occur  so  that  the  universal,  com-
prehensive, and exalted adorning, purifying and cleansing that is to be seen 
and observed everywhere could come about. As for this, it is not impossible 
once, but a hundred thousand times over.

If daylight and the imaginary miniature suns represented in the shining 
objects on the earth are not attributed to the sun and they are not said to be 
the manifestation of the sun’s reflection, it would be necessary for the actual 
sun to be present in all fragments of glass, drops of water and snow-flakes 
glistening on the face of the earth, and even in all particles of air, so that the 
universal light could exist.

Thus, wisdom is a light; all-embracing mercy is a light; adorning, bal-
ancing,  ordering,  and  cleansing  are  each  an  encompassing  light:  they  are 
all the rays of the Pre-Eternal Sun. So see how misguidance and unbelief 
have entered a bog from which there is no escape! See just how idiotic is the 
ignorance of misguidance! Say: “ Praise be to Allah for the religion of Islam 
and complete and perfect belief! ”

For sure, this exalted, universal cleansing which keeps the palace of the 
universe clean is the manifestation and requirement of the divine name of 
Most Holy. Yes, just as the glorification of all creatures looks to the name 
of Most Holy, so does the name of Most Holy require their cleanliness in all 
respects. 1

It  is  because  of  this  sacred  connection  of  cleanliness  that  the  Hadith, 
ْ(cid:202)ا َنِ(cid:174) ُةَ(cid:158)اَ(cid:147)َ
ّ(cid:179)(cid:170)َا 2 deems it to be a light of belief. And the verse,

ِنا َ(cid:175)(cid:192)ِ

( 2:222 ) ° ¯ ® ¬ « ª
shows that cleanliness is a means of attracting Allah’s love.

stances of moral and spiritual dirt.

THE SECOND POINT

The Divine Name of All-Just

( 15:21 ) V U T S R Q P O N M L
One point concerning this verse and one manifestation of the name of All-
Just, which is a greatest name or one of the six lights comprising the great-
est name, like the First Point, appeared to me from afar while in Eskişehir 
Prison. In order to bring it closer to the understanding, we say the following; 
again by means of a comparison:

The universe is a palace, but it is such a palace that within it is a city that 
suffers the upheavals of constant destruction and reconstruction. Within the 
city is a country that is being continuously agitated by war and emigration.
Within the country is a world which is unceasingly revolving amid death and 
life. But such an astonishing balance, equilibrium and equilibration prevail 
in the palace, city, country and world that it self-evidently proves that the 
transformations, and incomings and outgoings apparent in their innumerable 
beings are being measured and weighed every moment on the scales of a 
Single Being who sees and supervises the whole universe.

For  if  it  had  been  otherwise,  if  causes  had  been  free  and  unrestrained, 
which try to destroy the balance and overrun everything, with a single fish 
laying a thousand eggs and a single flower like the poppy producing twenty 
thousand seeds, and with the onslaught and violence of change and the ele-
ments flowing in floods, or if it had been referred to aimless, purposeless 
chance, anarchic blind forces, and unconscious dark nature, the equilibrium 
of beings and balance of the universe would have been so utterly destroyed 
that within a year, indeed within a day, there would have been chaos. That 
is to say, the seas would have been filled with wreckage in total disorder 
and  confusion  and  would  have  become  fetid;  the  atmosphere  would  have 
been poisoned with noxious gases; and as for the earth, it would have turned 
into a refuse-heap, slaughter-house, and swamp. The world would have suf-
focated.

Thus, everything from the cells of an animate body, the red and white cor-
puscles in the blood, the transformations of minute particles, and the mutual 
proportion and relation of the body’s organs, to the incomings and outgoings 
of the seas, the income and expenditure of springs under the earth, the birth

and death of animals and plants, the destruction of autumn and the recon-
struction of spring, the duties and motion of the elements and the stars, and 
the alternations, struggles and clashes of death and life, light and darkness, 
and heat and cold, are ordered and weighed with so sensitive a balance, so 
fine a measure, that the human mind can nowhere see any waste or futility, 
just as human science and philosophy observe everywhere and demonstrate 
the most perfect order and beautiful symmetry. Indeed, human science and 
philosophy are a manifestation and interpreter of that order and symmetry. 
So,  come  and  consider  the  balance  and  equilibrium  of  the  sun  and  its 
twelve planets. Does it not point as clearly as the sun to the All-Glorious 
One who is All-Just and All-Powerful? Especially our ship, that is, the globe 
of the earth, which is one of the planets; it travels an orbit of twenty-four 
thousand years in one year, not scattering or shaking the things stored up 
and stacked on its face, despite its extraordinary speed, nor throwing them 
off  into  space.  If  its  speed  had  been  increased  or  reduced  just  a  little,  it 
would  have  thrown  its  inhabitants  off  into  the  atmosphere,  and  scattered 
them through space. And if its balance was to be destroyed for a minute, 
or even a second, it would destroy the world. Indeed, it would clash with 
another body and doomsday would break forth.

Especially  the  compassionate  balance  on  the  face  of  the  earth  of  the 
births, deaths, livelihoods, and lives of the four hundred thousand plant and 
animal species; it shows a single Just and Compassionate One, as clearly as 
light shows the sun.

Especially the members, faculties, and senses of a single of the innumer-
able members of those species; they are related to each other with so fine a 
balance and equilibrium that their balance and mutual proportion show an 
All-Wise and Just Maker so clearly as to be self-evident.

Especially the cells and blood-vessels in the bodies of animals, and the 
corpuscles  in  the  blood  and  particles  in  the  corpuscles;  they  have  such  a 
fine, sensitive, and wondrous balance that it self-evidently proves that they 
are  being  nurtured  and  administered  through  the  balance,  law,  and  order 
of a single All-Just and Wise Creator who holds the reins of all things, has 
the key to all things, for whom nothing is an obstacle to anything else, and 
directs all things as easily as a single thing.

If someone who does not believe or deems it unlikely that the deeds of 
jinn and men will be weighed up on the supreme scales of justice at the Last 
Judgement notes carefully this vast balance, which he can observe in this 
world with his own eyes, he will surely no longer consider it unlikely.

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF ALL-JUST

411

O wasteful, prodigal.. wrongful, unjust.. dirty, unclean.. wretched man! 
You have not acted in accordance with the economy, cleanliness, and justice 
that are the principles by which the whole universe and all beings act, and 
are therefore in effect the object of their anger and disgust. On what do you 
rely  that  through  your  wrongdoing  and  disequilibrium,  your  wastefulness 
and uncleanliness, you make all beings angry? Yes, the universal wisdom of 
the universe, which is the greatest manifestation of the divine name of All-
Wise, turns on economy and lack of waste. It commands frugality. And the 
total justice in the universe proceeding from the greatest manifestation of the 
Name of All-Just, administers the balance of all things and enjoins justice on 
man. Mentioning the word balance four times, the verses in Sura al-Rahman,

 f e d * b a ` _ * ] \ [ Z
( 55:7-9 ) i h g
indicate four degrees and four sorts of balance, showing its immensity and 
supreme importance in the universe. Yes, just as there is no wastefulness in 
anything, so in nothing is there true injustice or imbalance.

The cleanliness and purification proceeding from the greatest manifesta-
tion of the name of Most Holy cleans and makes beautiful all the beings in 
the universe. So long as man’s dirty hand does not interfere, there is no true 
uncleanliness or ugliness in anything.

So  you  may  understand  how  basic  to  human  life  are  the  principles  of 
justice, frugality, and cleanliness, which are truths of the Qur’an and Islamic 
principles.  And  know  how  closely  connected  with  the  universe  are  the 
injunctions of the Qur’an, having spread their firm roots everywhere, and 
that it is as impossible to destroy those truths as it is to destroy the universe 
and change its form.

Is it at all possible that although hundreds of comprehensive truths like 
these three vast lights, such as mercy, grace, and preservation, require and 
necessitate the resurrection of the dead and the hereafter, such powerful 
and  all-encompassing  truths  as  mercy,  favour,  justice,  wisdom,  frugal-
ity, and cleanliness, which govern in the universe and all beings, should 
be  transformed  into  unkindness,  tyranny,  lack  of  wisdom,  wastefulness, 
uncleanliness, and futility, by there being no hereafter and the resurrection 
not occurring?

Allah forbid, a hundred thousand times, Allah forbid! Would a mercy and 
wisdom which compassionately preserve the rights of life of a fly violate the 

412

THE FLASHES

countless rights of life of all conscious beings and the numberless rights 
of numberless beings, by not bringing about the resurrection? And if one 
may say so, would a splendid dominicality which displays infinite sensi-
tivity and care in its mercy and compassion and justice and wisdom, and a 
divine sovereignty which adorns the universe with His endless wondrous 
arts  and  bounties  in  order  to  display  His  perfections  and  make  himself 
known and loved, permit there to be no resurrection, which would reduce 
to nothing the value of creatures and all their perfections, and make them 
denied? Allah forbid! Such an absolute beauty clearly would not permit 
such absolute ugliness.

Yes, the person who wants to deny the hereafter must first deny all the 
world and all its truths. Otherwise the world together with all its truths will 
give him the lie with a hundred thousand tongues, proving the compounded 
nature  of  his  lie.  The  Tenth  Word  proves  with  certain  evidences  that  the 
existence of the hereafter is as definite and indubitable as the existence of 
this world.

THE THIRD POINT

Which alludes to the Third of the Six Lights
of the Greatest Name,

The Divine Name of Sapient

( 16:125 ) z y x w v

[ One manifestation of the divine name of Sapient, which is a greatest 
name or one of the six lights of the greatest name, and a fine point of 
the  above  verse,  appeared  to  me  in  the  month  of  Ramadan  while  in 
Eskişehir Prison. This Third Point consists of five matters, and forms 
only an allusion to it. It was written in haste and has remained in its 
original form. ]

First Matter

FIRST MATTER

As is indicated in the Tenth Word, the greatest manifestation of the divine 
name of Sapient has made the universe like a book in every page of which 
hundreds of books have been written, and in every line of which hundreds 
of pages have been included, and in every word of which are hundreds of 
lines, and in each letter of which are a hundred words, and in every point of 
which is found a short index of the book. The book’s pages and lines down 
to the very points show its Inscriber and Writer with such clarity that that 
book  of  the  universe  testifies  to  and  proves  the  existence  and  unity  of  its 
Scribe to a degree far greater than it shows its own existence. For if a single 
letter shows its own existence to the extent of a letter, it shows its Scribe to 
the extent of a line.

Yes, one page of this mighty book is the face of the earth. Books to the 
number of the plant and animal species are to be observed on this page in the 
spring, one within the other, together, at the same time, without error, in the 
most perfect form.

A single line of the page is a garden. We see that written on this line are 
well-composed odes to the number of flowers, trees, and plants together, one 
within the other, without error.

One word of the line is a tree which has opened its blossom and put forth 
its  leaves  in  order  to  produce  its  fruit.  This  word  consists  of  meaningful 

413

414

THE FLASHES

passages lauding and praising the All-Glorious Sapient One to the number 
of  orderly,  well-proportioned,  adorned  leaves,  flowers,  and  fruits.  It  is  as 
though like all trees, this tree is a well-composed ode singing the praises of 
its Inscriber.

It is also as if the All-Glorious Sapient One wants to look with thousands 
of eyes on His wonderful antique works displayed in the exhibition of the 
earth.

And  it  is  as  if  the  bejewelled  gifts,  decorations  and  uniforms  given  to 
the tree by that Pre-Eternal Monarch have been given such adorned, well-
proportioned, orderly, meaningful and wise forms in order to present them 
to His view in the spring, its particular festival and parade, that each of its 
flowers and fruits testifies in numerous ways and with many evidences one 
within the other to its Inscriber’s existence and names.

For example, in all its blossoms and fruits is a balance. The balance is 
within  an  order,  and  the  order  is  within  an  ordering  and  balancing  which 
is  being  constantly  renewed.  The  ordering  and  balancing  is  within  an  art 
and adornment, and the adornment and art are within meaningful scents and 
wise tastes. Thus, each flower points to the All-Glorious Sapient One to the 
number of the tree’s blossoms.

And in the tree, which is a word, the point of a seed in a fruit, which is 
like  a  letter,  is  a  small  coffer  containing  the  index  and  programme  of  the 
whole tree. And so on. To continue the same analogy, through the manifes-
tation of the name of Sapient and Wise, all the lines and pages of the book 
of the universe – and not only its lines, but all its words, letters, and points – 
have been made as miracles so that if all causes were to gather together, they 
could not make the like of a single point, nor could they dispute it.

Yes, since each of the creational signs of this mighty Qur’an of the uni-
verse displays miracles to the number of points and letters of those signs, in 
no way could confused chance, blind force, aimless, anarchic, unconscious 
nature interfere in that wise, percipient particular balance and most sensitive 
order. If they had interfered, some traces of confusion would certainly have 
been apparent. Whereas no disorder of any sort is to be seen anywhere.

perfection of His beauty with the universe and all its pages, lines and even 
letters and points, with the innumerable tongues of all beings from the most 
particular to the most universal.

O heedless man! Come to your senses! Know just what a compounded 
ignorance it is and what a loss if in the face of the Sapient and All-Wise 
Ruler of Glory and Beauty’s making Himself known to you and loved by

recognize Him with belief and you do not make yourself loved by Him with 
your worship.

T h e   S e c o n d   T o p i c    o f   t h e   S e c o n d   M a t t e r :  There is no place for partner-
ship in the dominions of the universe’s All-Powerful and Wise Maker. For 
the infinitely perfect order present in everything does not accept partners. 
Many hands intervening in a single matter confuses it. If there are two kings 
in a country, two governors of a town, or two headmen in a village, disorder 
will occur in all their affairs. Similarly, the lowest official does not accept 
interference in his duties, which shows that the fundamental characteristic of 
rulership is independence and singleness. That is to say, order necessitates 
unity, and rulership necessitates independence.

If a temporary shadow of rulership in impotent man needy for assistance 
rejects interference in this way, the true, absolute rulership at the degree of 
dominicality of the One who possesses absolute power will certainly reject 
interference with all its strength. Even the tiniest interference would spoil 
the order.

However, the universe has been created in such a way that to create a 
seed, the power to create a tree is necessary. And to create a tree, the power 
to create the universe is necessary. If any partner interfered in the universe, 
he would have to share in the tiniest seed. For the seed is a sample of the 
universe.  So  then  two  dominicalities  which  cannot  reside  together  in  the 
vast universe, would have to reside in a seed, and even in a minute parti-
cle. This is the most precluded and meaningless of impossibilities and false 
delusions.  Know  that  unbelief  and  associating  partners  with  Allah  are  an 
infinitely compounded contradiction, error, and falsehood, for they necessi-
tate the impotence – even if only in a seed – of the Absolutely Powerful One 
who holds in the balance of His justice and order of His wisdom all the states 
and attributes of the vast universe; and know that divine unity is an infinitely 
compounded truth, reality and verity, and say: “ All praise and thanks be to 
Allah for belief! ”

With His names of Sapient and All-Wise, the All-Powerful Maker has 
included  thousands  of  well-ordered  worlds  in  this  world.  Within  those 
worlds, He created man as a centre and pivot who of all creatures manifests 
the wisdom and purposes in the universe. The most important of the instances 
of wisdom and beneficial things in the sphere of the universe look to man. 
And in the human sphere, He made sustenance a centre; in the human world 
most  of  the  instances  of  wisdom  and  benefits  look  to  sustenance  and  are 
manifest through it. The manifestation of the name of All-Wise is apparent 
in brilliant form in man through his intelligence and the pleasure he receives 
from sustenance. Each one of the hundreds of sciences discovered by human 
intelligence describes a manifestation of the name of Sapient in a realm of 
creation.

For example, if the science of medicine were to be asked: “ What is the 
universe? ”, it would be bound to reply: “ It is an exceedingly vast, orderly 
and perfect pharmacy. All remedies are prepared and stored up in it in the 
best way. ”

If the science of chemistry were asked: “ What is the earth? ”, it would 

reply: “ It is a perfectly ordered chemist’s shop. ”

The science of engineering would reply: “ It is totally faultless, perfect 

factory. ”

The science of agriculture would reply: “ It is an infinitely productive, 
regular and well-laid-out field and garden which produces all kinds of seeds 
at the required time. ”

The science of commerce would reply: “ It is an extremely well-set-out 

exhibition, orderly market, and shop stocked with most artistic wares. ”

The  science  of  economics  would  reply:  “ It  is  an  exceedingly  well-

arranged warehouse containing every sort and kind of food. ”

The science of dietetics would reply: “ It is a dominical kitchen and caul-
dron of the Most Merciful in which are cooked most regularly hundreds of 
thousands of the most delicious foods. ”

The  science  of  soldiering  would  reply:  “ The  earth  is  a  military  camp. 
Although  there  are  four  hundred  thousand  different  nations  in  that  army, 
newly  taken  under  arms  with  their  tents  pitched  on  the  face  of  the  earth, 
they  are  given  their  rations,  uniforms,  weapons,  training,  and  discharges, 
which are different for each nation, in perfect order, with no confusion and

none being forgotten, through the command, power, compassion of a single 
Commander-in-Chief,  from  His  treasury;  they  are  all  administered  in  the 
most regular fashion. ”

And if the science of electricity were to be asked: “ What is this world? ”, 
it would certainly reply: “ The roof of this magnificent palace of the universe 
has  been  adorned  with  innumerable  orderly  and  balanced  electric  lamps, 
and the order and balance are so wondrous that foremost the sun, and those 
heavenly lamps which are a thousand times larger than the earth, do not spoil 
their balance, although they burn continuously; they do not explode or burst 
into flames. Their expenditure is endless, so where do their income and fuel 
and combustible material come from? Why are they not exhausted? Why is 
the balance not spoilt with their burning? A small lamp goes out if it is not 
tended regularly. See the wisdom and power of the All-Wise One of Glory, 
who makes the sun, which according to astronomy is a million times larger 
than the earth and a million years older, 1 burn without coal or oil, without 
being extinguished; say: ‘All Glory be to Allah!’ Say: ‘What wonders Allah 
has  willed!  Blessed  be  Allah!  There  is  no  god  but  He!’  to  the  number  of 
seconds of the sun’s existence.

“ This means there is a wondrous order in these heavenly lamps, and they 
are tended with the greatest care. It is as if the boiler of those huge, numer-
ous fiery masses, those light-shedding lamps, is a Hell whose heat is never 
exhausted;  it  provides  them  with  lightless  heat.  While  the  machinery  and 
central  factory  of  those  electric  lamps  is  a  perpetual  Paradise;  it  provides 
them  with  light  and  luminosity;  through  the  greatest  manifestation  of  the 
names of Sapient and All-Wise, they continue to burn in orderly fashion. ”

And  so  on;  through  the  certain  testimony  of  hundreds  of  sciences  like 
these,  the  universe  has  been  adorned  with  innumerable  instances  of  wis-
dom, purposes, and beneficial things within a faultless, perfect order. And 
the order and wisdom given through that wondrous, all-encompassing wis-
dom to the totality of the universe have been included in small measure in 
seeds and the tiniest living creatures. It is clear and self-evident that aims, 
purposes, instances of wisdom, and benefits can only be followed through 

1.  You can reckon just how much wood, coal, and oil would be necessary for the stove 
or lamp of the sun, which heats the palace of the world. According to the reckoning of 
astronomy, piles of wood equal to a million earths and thousands of oceans of oil would be 
necessary for it to burn each day. Now think! And say: “ Glory be to Allah! What wonders 
Allah has willed! Blessed be Allah! ” to the number of the sun’s particles in the face of the 
majesty, wisdom, and power of the All-Powerful One of Glory, who makes it give light 
continuously without firewood or oil.

choice, will, intention, and volition, not in any other way. Neither could they 
be the work of unconscious causes and nature, which lack will, choice, and 
purpose, nor could they interfere in them.

That is to say, it is extraordinary ignorance and foolishness not to rec-
ognize or to deny the All-Wise Maker, the Agent with Choice, whom the 
universe and all its beings necessitate and demonstrate through their infi-
nite order and the instances of wisdom they contain. Yes, if there is any-
thing astonishing in the world, it is such denial. For the endless aspects of 
order and instances of wisdom in the beings in the universe testify to His 
existence and unity, so that even the most profoundly ignorant can under-
stand what blindness and ignorance it is not to see or not to recognize Him. 
I might even say that among the people of unbelief, the Sophists, who are 
supposed to be stupid because they denied the universe’s existence, are the 
most intelligent. For since on accepting its existence, it was not possible 
not to believe in Allah and its Creator, they started to deny the universe’s 
existence.  They  denied  themselves  as  well.  Saying,  “ There  is  nothing, ” 
they  abdicated  their  intelligences,  and  being  saved  from  the  boundless 
unreasonableness – under the guise of reason – of the other deniers, they 
in one sense drew close to reason.

Fourth Matter

FOURTH MATTER

As is indicated in the Tenth Word, for a Wise Maker, a most wise master 
builder, to follow carefully hundreds of instances of wisdom in each stone 
of a palace, then not to construct the palace’s roof so it falls into ruin and all 
the innumerable purposes and instances of wisdom are lost, is something no 
conscious being could accept. Similarly, it is in no way possible that having 
followed out of his perfect wisdom tons of benefits, aims, and purposes in a 
tiny seed, a possessor of absolute wisdom should go to the great expense of 
the mighty tree as tall as a mountain so it should produce a single benefit, a 
single small aim, a single fruit worth virtually nothing, and so to be waste-
fully prodigal in a way entirely opposed and contrary to his wisdom. 

In just the same way, the All-Wise Maker attaches hundreds of instances 
of wisdom to each of the beings in the palace of the universe and equips them 
to perform hundreds of duties, and to all trees bestows instances of wisdom 
to the number of its fruits and gives duties to the number of its flowers. For 
Him not to bring about the resurrection of the dead and the Great Gathering 
and for all those incalculable numbers of purposes and instances of wisdom 
and infinite duties to be meaningless, futile, pointless, and without purpose

or  benefit,  would  impute  absolute  impotence  to  that  Absolutely  Powerful 
One’s perfect power, just as it would impute futility and purposelessness to 
that Absolutely Wise One’s perfect wisdom, and utter ugliness to the beauty 
of that Absolutely Compassionate One’s mercy, and boundless tyranny to 
that Absolutely Just One’s perfect justice. It would be quite simply to deny 
the wisdom, mercy, and justice in the universe, which may be seen by eve-
ryone. It would be an extraordinary impossibility comprising innumerable 
absurdities.  Let  the  people  of  misguidance  come  and  see  just  what  a  ter-
rifying darkness, obscurity, there is in their misguidance, just as there is in 
their graves; and how they are the nests of scorpions. They should know that 
belief in the hereafter is a way as beautiful and luminous as Paradise, and 
should embrace belief.

S e c o n d   T o p i c :   It  may  be  said  that  the  names  of  Sapient  and  All-Wise

( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) to the degree of being self-evident.

Yes,  since  a  meaningful  book  requires  a  teacher  to  explain  it;  and  an 
exquisite beauty requires a mirror to show itself and see itself; and a perfect 
work of art requires a herald to announce it; for sure among mankind, who 
is addressed by the mighty book of the universe, in every letter of which are 
hundreds of meanings and instances of wisdom, will be a perfect guide, a 
supreme teacher. For he will teach the sacred, true wisdom in the book; that 
is, make known the existence of the wisdom and purposes in the universe; 
indeed, be the means of the appearance, and even existence, of the dominical

purposes in the universe’s creation; and make known and act as a mirror to 
the perfect art of the Creator, and the beauty of His names, which He willed 
to display throughout the universe, showing their importance. 

And  since  the  Creator  wants  to  make  Himself  loved  through  all  His 
beings and to be responded to by all His intelligent creatures, one of them 
will respond with comprehensive worship in the name of all of them in the 
face  of  those  comprehensive  dominical  manifestations;  he  will  bring  the 
land and sea to ecstasy, and with a tumultuous announcement and exaltation 
that will cause the heavens and earth to reverberate turn the gazes of those 
conscious creatures to the One who made the art; and with sacred instruction 
and teaching and a Qur’an of Mighty Stature that will draw the attention of 
all reasonable people, will demonstrate in the best way the divine purposes 
of that Sapient and All-Wise Maker; and who will respond most completely 
and perfectly to the manifestations of all His instances of wisdom and of His 
beauty and glory; the existence of such a being is as necessary, as essen-
tial for the universe as the existence of the sun. And the one who did this 
and performed those functions most perfectly was self-evidently the Most 
Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). In which case, all 
the wisdom in the universe necessitates the messengership of Muhammad 
( UWBP ) as the sun necessitates light, and light, the day.

Yes,  just  as  through  their  greatest  manifestation,  the  names  of  Sapient 
and All-Wise necessitate the messengership of Muhammad ( UWBP ) at the 
maximum degree, so too numerous most beautiful names like Allah, Most 
Merciful,  All-Compassionate,  Loving,  Bestower,  Munificent,  Beauteous, 
and  Sustainer  necessitate  through  their  greatest  manifestation  apparent  in 
the universe, at the maximum degree and with absolute certainty, the mes-
sengership of Muhammad ( UWBP ).

For example, the all-embracing mercy which is the manifestation of the 
name of Most Merciful is apparent through the being sent as a Mercy to All 
the Worlds. Almighty Allah’s making Himself known and loved, which is 
the manifestation of the name of Loving, yields the fruit of that Beloved of 
the Sustainer of All the Worlds and finds response in him. All instances of 
beauty, which are the manifestation of the name of Beauteous, that is, the 
beauty of the divine essence, the beauty of the divine names, beauty of art, 
and the beauty of creatures, are seen and displayed in the mirror of Muham-
mad ( UWBP ). The manifestations of the splendour of dominicality and sov-
ereignty of divinity are known, become apparent and understood, and are 
confirmed through the messengership of Muhammad ( UWBP ), the herald 

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF SAPIENT

of the dominion of dominicality. And so on, like these examples, most of the 
most beautiful names are shining proofs of the messengership of Muham-
mad ( UWBP ).

I n  

 S h o r t :  Since  the  universe  exists  and  cannot  be  denied,  neither  can 
such  observable  truths  as  wisdom,  grace,  mercy,  beauty,  order,  balance, 
and  adornment,  which  are  like  the  colours,  embellishments,  lights,  rays, 
arts,  lives,  and  bonds  of  the  universe  be  denied.  Since  it  is  impossible  to 
deny these attributes and acts, certainly the Necessarily Existent, All-Wise, 
Munificent, Compassionate, Beauteous, Sapient, and Just One also, who is 
the One signified by those attributes, and is the Doer of those deeds, and the 
Sun and Source of those lights, can in no way be denied. And certainly the 
messengership of Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), who 
is the supreme guide, most perfect teacher, pre-eminent herald, solver of the 
talisman of the universe, mirror of the Eternally Besought One, beloved of 
the Most Merciful, and the means of those attributes and acts being known, 
indeed of their perfection, and even of their being realized, can in no way 
be denied. His messengership is the universe’s most brilliant light, like the 
lights of the world of reality and of the reality of the universe.

[ One fine point of this verse and a manifestation of the divine name 
of Single, which is a greatest name comprising the names of One and 
Unique, or one of the six lights comprising the greatest name, appeared 
to  me  in  Eskişehir  Prison  in  the  month  of  Shawwal.  Referring  the 
details of that greatest manifestation to the R i s a l e - i   N u r , we shall here 
explain  extremely  briefly  in  seven  short  Indications  the  true  affirma-
tion of divine unity which the name of Single demonstrates through its 
maximum manifestation. ]

First Indication

FIRST INDICATION

The Twenty-Second Word and Thirty-Third Letter have shown in detail 
that through a greatest manifestation, the greatest name of Single has placed 
a seal, a stamp, of divine unity on the universe as a whole and on each realm 
of beings in it, and on each individual being. Here, we shall point out only 
three stamps.

First Stamp

F i r s t    S t a m p :  The manifestation of divine singleness has placed a seal of 
unity on the face of the universe whereby it has made it an indivisible whole. 
One who does not have power of disposal over the whole universe cannot be 
the true owner of any part of it. The seal is this:

Like the finest machinery in a factory, the beings and realms of beings in 
the universe assist one another and work to complete each other’s functions. 
With their solidarity and co-operation, their answering each other’s requests 
and hastening to assist to each other, their embracing each other and being 
one within the other, they form a unity of existence according to which, like 
the elements in the human body, they cannot be separated from each other. 
A person who controls one of its elements yet does not have control over all 
of them, will not have true mastery over the single element. 

Thus, this co-operation, solidarity, mutual response, and embracing one 

another forms a most brilliant supreme seal of divine unity.

Second Stamp

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF SINGLE

423

S e c o n d    S t a m p :  Through the manifestation of the name of Single, so bril-
liant  a  seal  of  divine  oneness  and  stamp  of  unity  has  been  placed  on  the 
face of the earth and face of the spring that it proves that one who does not 
administer all the living creatures on the face of the globe together with all 
their  members  and  attributes  and  states,  and  who  does  not  know  and  see 
them  all  together,  and  cannot  create  them,  cannot  interfere  in  anything  in 
respect of creation. The stamp is this: 

Disregarding  the  truly  orderly,  yet  hidden,  stamps  of  the  mineral  sub-
stances, the elements, and inanimate creatures of the earth, consider the fol-
lowing inscribed stamp consisting of the woven threads of the two hundred 
thousand  animal  species  and  two  hundred  thousand  plant  species:  we  see 
with our own eyes in the spring on the earth that all things with their dif-
ferent  duties,  different  forms,  different  sustenance,  different  members  are 
given everything they need, without confusion and without error, with com-
plete distinction and differentiation, with extremely sensitive balance, with-
out difficulty, at exactly the right time, from unexpected places despite their 
being  one  within  the  other  and  all  mixed  up  together.  This  situation,  this 
planning, this administration forms such a seal of divine unity and stamp of 
oneness that one who cannot create all those creatures at once from nothing, 
cannot interfere in anything at all in respect of dominicality and creation. 
For if something had interfered, the equilibrium of that utterly vast adminis-
tration would have been spoilt. However, man apparently serves the smooth 
application of those laws of dominicality, at the divine command.

Third Stamp

T h i r d    S t a m p :  This stamp of divine oneness is on man’s face, indeed, is 
man’s face: one who does not hold in his gaze all the human beings who 
have come and will come from the time of Adam till the end of the world, 
and cannot place a distinguishing mark on each of their faces, indeed, hun-
dreds of distinguishing marks, can have no part in respect of creation in the 
stamp of unity on the face of any single one of them. Yes, the one who places 
that stamp on man’s face must surely hold within his view and encompass 
with  his  knowledge  all  the  members  of  the  human  race,  for  although  the 
basic members of the human face resemble one another, each face possesses 
points of difference. All the members of the face, such as the eye and ear, 
resembling each other forms a stamp of unity testifying that humankind’s 
Maker is One; similarly, the many wise differences – making them superior 
to other species – distinguishing one from the other so they are not confused 
and to preserve the rights of all of them, are both different, subtle stamps of 
divine oneness, and denote the Maker of unity’s will, choice, and volition. 

424

THE FLASHES

They show that one who cannot create all men and animals, indeed, the uni-
verse, cannot apply that stamp.

Second Indication

SECOND INDICATION

The worlds, species, and elements of the universe are so intertwined and 
interwoven that any cause that does not possess the universe as a whole can-
not have true disposal over any of its elements. The manifestation of unity 
proceeding from the name of Single has included the whole universe within 
a unity so that everything proclaims it. For example, the universe’s lamp, 
the sun, being one indicates that the whole universe belongs to one, so too, 
the air, which serves living beings nimbly and swiftly, being the same; and 
ﬁre, their cook, being the same; and the sponges of clouds which water the 
garden of the earth being the same; and the rain which comes to aid of all 
living creatures being the same and falling everywhere; and most of the ani-
mal and plant species spreading freely over the earth and their species and 
habitats being the same, are most certain signs and testimonies indicating 
that all those beings, as well the places they are found, are the property of a 
single being.

Following this analogy, the realms of beings in the universe are so inter-
woven  they  have  made  the  universe  into  a  totality  which  is  indivisible  in 
respect of creation. A cause that does not have rule over the whole universe 
can govern nothing at all in respect of dominicality and creativity; it cannot 
make a single particle heed it.

Third Indication

THIRD INDICATION

Through  its  greatest  manifestation,  the  name  Single  has  made  the  uni-
verse  into  innumerable  missives  of  the  Eternally  Besought  One  whereby 
each  displays  seals  of  divine  oneness  and  stamps  of  unity  to  the  number 
of its words – as though printed – and points to its Scribe to the number of 
those seals.

Yes, all flowers, all fruits, all grasses, and all animals even, and all trees 
are seals of divine oneness and stamps of divine unity, which, together with 
the places they are found, which take the form of missives, are like signa-
tures showing the one who wrote the place. For example, a buttercup in a 
garden  is  like  a  seal  of  the  garden’s  inscriber.  Whosever  seal  the  flower 
is, all flowers of the same sort on the face of the earth indicate clearly that 
they are his words and that the garden too is his writing. This means that all 
things ascribe everything to the One who created them, pointing to a maxi-
mum affirmation of divine unity.

Fourth Indication

FOURTH INDICATION

In  addition  to  being  clear  as  the  sun,  the  greatest  manifestation  of  the 
name  of  Single  is  so  reasonable  as  to  be  necessary  and  can  be  accepted 
with  infinite  ease.  Numerous  proofs  demonstrating  that  the  association  of 
partners with Allah, the opposite and opponent of that manifestation, is infi-
nitely difficult and infinitely far from reason, indeed, impossible and pre-
cluded,  have  been  explained  in  various  parts  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r .  For  the 
present referring the details of the points of those proofs to those treatises, 
we shall here expound only three points.

The First

T h e   F i r s t :  We have demonstrated with certain proofs, briefly at the end 
of the Tenth and Twenty-Ninth Words and in detail at the end of the Twen-
tieth Letter, that in relation to the power of the Single and Unique One, the 
creation of the greatest thing is as easy as the smallest. It creates the spring 
as easily as a ﬂower. Every spring it easily creates before our eyes thousands 
of  examples  of  the  resurrection  of  the  dead.  It  administers  a  large  tree  as 
comfortably as a small fruit. Whereas if referred to numerous causes, each 
fruit becomes as difficult and expensive as a tree, and a flower as difficult 
and troublesome as the spring.

Yes, if the equipment of an army is made on the orders of a single com-
mander in a single factory, it is as easy as making the equipment of a sin-
gle soldier, whereas if the equipment of all the soldiers is made in differ-
ent factories and the army’s administration passes from a single officer to 
many, then each soldier will require factories to the number of the army’s 
soldiers. In just the same way, if everything is ascribed to the Single and 
Unique  One,  the  innumerable  members  of  an  entire  species  become  as 
easy  as  a  single  member.  While  if  attributed  to  causes  each  becomes  as 
difficult as the whole species.

Yes, both unity and singleness come about through everything being con-
nected with the One of Unity, and through reliance on Him. And this reliance 
and connection may become a boundless power and strength for the thing. 
Through the strength of the reliance and connection, that small thing may 
perform  works  far  exceeding  its  individual  strength,  and  produce  results. 
While something very powerful that does not rely on the Single Unique One 
and is not connected to Him can perform small works in accordance with its 
individual strength, and the results diminish accordingly.

For  example,  a  strong,  bold  man  who  is  not  a  regular  soldier  is  com-
pelled to carry his own ammunition and provisions himself, and so can hold 

426

THE FLASHES

out only temporarily against ten enemy. For his individual strength is lim-
ited. But a soldier who by belonging to the army is connected to and relies 
on  the  commander-in-chief,  is  not  compelled  to  carry  his  own  sources  of 
strength and provisions; his connection and reliance become an inexhaust-
ible strength for him, like a treasury. Through the strength of his connection, 
he may capture a field marshal of the defeated enemy army, together with 
thousands of others.

That is to say, in divine unity and divine singleness, through the strength 
of the connection, an ant may defeat a Pharaoh and a fly defeat a Nimrod and 
a microbe a tyrant, and a seed as tiny as a chickpea may bear on its shoulders 
a pine tree as majestic as a mountain. Yes, a commander-in-chief may send 
an army to the assistance of one soldier and assemble an army behind the 
soldier so that he has the moral support of the army behind him and through 
that strength may perform great works in the commander’s name. Similarly, 
since the Pre-Eternal Monarch is Single and One, He has no need of any sort. 
If to suppose that He did have need, He would send all things to the assist-
ance of everything and assemble the army of the universe behind one thing 
and everything could rely on a strength as great as the universe and in the 
face of everything, all things – to suppose that He did have the need – could 
become like the Single Commander’s strength. If there were no divine sin-
gleness, everything would lose all this strength and become as nothing; their 
results too would dwindle to nothing.

Thus, the appearance of these truly wondrous works out of most insig-
nificant  unimportant  things  which  we  all  the  time  observe  with  our  eyes 
self-evidently demonstrates divine singleness and divine oneness. If it were 
not for them, the results, fruits, and works of everything would decrease to 
the  substance  and  strength  of  each  thing;  they  would  be  reduced  to  noth-
ing. Nothing of the infinite abundance and infinite inexpensiveness of the 
extremely  valuable  things  we  see  around  us  would  remain.  A  melon  or 
pomegranate  that  we  now  buy  for  a  small  sum,  we  would  not  be  able  to 
procure for a fortune. Yes, all the ease, all the abundance, all the inexpen-
siveness in the world arise from divine unity and testify to divine singleness.
S e c o n d   P o i n t :  Beings are created in two ways; one is creation from noth-
ing  called  origination  and  invention,  and  other  is  the  giving  of  existence 
through bringing together existent elements and things, called composition 
and assembling. When in accordance with the manifestation of divine sin-
gleness  and  mystery  of  divine  oneness,  this  occurs  with  an  infinite  ease, 
indeed, such ease as to be necessary. If not ascribed to divine singleness, it 

Second Point

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF SINGLE

427

would be infinitely difficult and irrational, difficult to the degree of impos-
sibility. However, the fact that the beings in the universe come into existence 
with infinite ease and facility and no difficulty at all, and in perfect form, 
self-evidently shows the manifestation of divine singleness and proves that 
everything is directly the art of the Single One of Glory.

Yes, if things are ascribed to the Single One of Unity, they are created 
from  nothing  through  His  infinite  power,  the  immensity  of  which  is  per-
ceived through its works, like striking a match. And through His all-embrac-
ing, infinite knowledge everything is appointed a measure like an immaterial 
mould. The particles of all things are situated easily in the mould existent in 
knowledge, in accordance with the form and plan of everything in the mirror 
of knowledge and they preserve their positions in good order.

If it is necessary to gather together particles from round about, the par-
ticles are bound together in regular fashion like the soldiers of an obedient 
army in accordance with the comprehensive principles of power and laws 
of knowledge. Driven by power in accordance with knowledge, they come, 
enter the mould existent in knowledge in accordance with the measure of 
divine determining, which encompasses the thing’s existence, and with ease 
form its being. Like the reflection in a mirror being clothed in external exist-
ence  on  paper  by  means  of  a  camera,  or  the  invisible  writing  of  a  letter 
appearing when it is spread with a special substance, with the greatest ease 
power clothes with external existence the essences of things and forms of 
beings present in the mirror of the Single One of Unity’s pre-eternal knowl-
edge; it brings them from the World of Meaning to the Apparent World, and 
shows them to us.

If beings are not ascribed to the Single One of Unity, it would be neces-
sary to gather together in extremely precise measure the being of a fly from 
all round the earth and from the elements, quite simply sifting the face of 
the earth and the elements and bringing from everywhere the particles par-
ticular to that particular being. And in order to situate them in proper order 
in its being so full of art, a physical mould, indeed moulds to the number 
of its members would be necessary. Then too the senses in its being, and its 
fine, subtle immaterial faculties like spirit, would have to be drawn from the 
immaterial worlds in a particular measure.

Thus,  the  creation  of  a  fly  in  this  way  would  be  as  difficult  as  that  of 
the universe. The difficulties would be multiplied a hundred times, indeed, 
would be a compounded impossibility. For as all the people of religion and 
scientists  are  agreed,  nothing  apart  from  the  Single  One  can  create  from 

428

THE FLASHES

nothing and non-existence. In which case, if referred to causes and nature, 
everything  may  be  given  existence  only  through  being  gathered  together 
from most things.

Third Point

T h i r d   P o i n t :  We shall explain briefly two or three comparisons which 
are elucidated in other parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , showing how, if ascribed to 
a Single One of Unity, all things become as easy as a single thing, whereas 
if referred to causes and nature, the existence of a single thing becomes as 
difficult as that of all things.

For Example

F o r   e x a m p l e :  If the positions and administration of a thousand soldiers 
are referred to one officer, and that of one soldier to ten officers, to command 
the one soldier will be ten times more difficult than commanding a battalion. 
For those who command him will form obstacles to one another, and in the 
resulting disorder, the soldier will have no peace. Whereas if to obtain the 
desired result and situation a battalion is referred to a single officer, he can 
achieve the result easily, without difficulty, and give it that situation. If to 
obtain the result and situation, it is referred to the soldiers without a chief, 
leader, or sergeant, they will only be achieved with much dispute and dif-
ficulty, in great disorder, and deficiently.

Second Comparison

S e c o n d   C o m p a r i s o n :   For  example,  if  a  master  builder  is  appointed  to 
give the stones in the dome of a mosque like Aya Sophia their suspended 
position, he may do so easily. But if it is referred to the stones themselves, 
they will all have to be both absolutely dominant and absolutely subject to 
each other in order to support each other in that suspended position. For the 
work the master builder performs easily to be carried out, work a hundred 
times greater, of a hundred builders, will have to be carried out, only then 
may such a position be achieved.

Third Comparison

T h i r d   C o m p a r i s o n :  For example, since the globe of the earth is an offi-
cial,  a  soldier,  of  the  Single  One  of  Unity  which  heeds  that  single  One’s 
single command, such results are obtained as the change of the seasons, the 
alternation of day and night, the lofty, majestic motions of the heavens, and 
the changes in the cinema-like celestial scenes. On receiving the single com-
mand of that Single One, in rapturous joy at its duty, a single soldier like the 
earth rises to revolve in two motions like an ecstatic Mevlevi dervish, and 
is the means to those splendid results being achieved. It is as if the single 
soldier is commanding magnificent manoeuvres on the face of the universe.
If not ascribed to a Single One whose rule of divinity and sovereignty of 
dominicality encompass the whole universe, and whose command and rule 
cover  all  beings,  those  results,  heavenly  maneouvres,  and  earthly  seasons 

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF SINGLE

429

could  only  be  obtained  by  millions  of  stars  and  globes  a  thousand  times 
larger than the earth travelling the long distance of millions of years every 
twenty-four hours and every year.

Thus, those results being obtained through the two motions – in its orbit 
and on its axis like an ecstatic Mevlevi dervish – of a single official like the 
globe of the earth, is an example of the infinite ease there is in divine unity. 
While their being obtained through endlessly long ways millions of times 
more difficult than the motion described above is an example of just how 
difficult, indeed, impossible is the way of associating partners with Allah 
and unbelief, and just what impossible, absurd things are found on it.

Consider the ignorance of those who worship causes and nature through 
the following example: you can understand how far from reason it is and 
how ignorant to suppose that after preparing in orderly fashion through his 
wondrous art the parts or machinery of a wonderful factory, or marvellous 
clock, or splendid palace, or fine book, a person does not himself assem-
ble  the  parts  easily  and  work  them,  but  with  protracted  and  high  expense 
makes each part, each mechanism, and even each sheet of paper and pen into 
extraordinary machines in order to make the parts themselves construct and 
work the factory, palace, and clock, and write the book instead of the crafts-
man. And he refers to them the art and craft, which is the means of display-
ing all his arts and skills, which he has great desire to exhibit.

In just the same way, those who attribute creation to causes and nature 
fall into compounded ignorance. For above nature and causes are extremely 
well-ordered  works  of  art,  and  they  too  are  artefacts  like  other  creatures. 
The one who makes them thus, makes their results too and displays them 
together. The one who makes the seed, also makes the tree above it. And the 
one who makes the tree, is the one who makes the fruits above it. Otherwise 
further well-ordered natures and causes would be necessary for other, differ-
ent natures and causes to come into existence. And so on, a d   i n f i n i t u m . One 
would have to accept the existence of an infinite, meaningless, impossible 
chain of illusory fancies. This would be the most extraordinary ignorance.

Fifth Indication

FIFTH INDICATION

We have demonstrated with decisive proofs in many places that the most 
fundamental  characteristic  of  rulership  is  independence  and  separateness. 
Even the weak shadow of rulership in impotent men vehemently rejects the 
interference of others and does not permit others to meddle in its duty, and 
in this way preserves its independence. Many kings have mercilessly put to 
death their innocent children and loved brothers on account of this rejection 

430

THE FLASHES

of interference. That is to say, independence, separateness, and the rejection 
of the interference of others are the most basic characteristics of true ruler-
ship, and are its inseparable necessities and perpetual essentials.

It is because of this characteristic that divine rulership, which is at the 
degree  of  absolute  dominicality,  most  vehemently  rejects  the  associa-
tion of any partners and the participation and interference of others. The 
Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition too, insistently, repeatedly, and sternly, 
indicates  divine  unity  and  rejects  with  severe  threats  the  association  of 
partners with Allah.

Thus,  the  divine  rulership  in  dominicality  most  deﬁnitely  necessitates 
divine unity and indicates a most powerful motive and necessitating cause 
for it. So too the infinitely perfect order and harmony on the face of the uni-
verse, apparent from the totality of the universe and the stars, and the plants, 
animals and minerals to particulars, individuals, and minute particles, form 
an indubitably veracious witness to and clear proof of that singleness and 
unity.  For  if  others  had  interfered,  this  most  sensitive  balance,  order,  and 
regularity of the universe would have been spoilt and signs of disorder would 
have been apparent. In accordance with the meaning of the verse,

( 21:22 ) ¶ μ ´ ³ ² ± °
this wondrous, perfect order of the universe would have been thrown into 
confusion and been spoilt. Whereas, according to the verse,

( 67:3 ) K J I H G F
from minute particles to the planets, from the ground to the divine throne, 
there is no sign of fault, defect, or confusion. Thus the order of the universe 
and of creatures and the balance of beings, demonstrate most brilliantly the 
greatest manifestation of the name of Single and testify to divine unity.

Moreover, since, through the mystery of the manifestation of divine one-
ness, the tiniest living creature is a miniature sample of the universe and a 
small index of it, only the One who holds the whole universe in the grasp of 
His power can lay claim to it. And since, in regard to creation, a seed is not 
inferior to a tree, and a tree is a small universe, and all living beings are like 
small universes and small worlds, this mystery of divine oneness has made 
the association of partners with Allah impossible.

By virtue of this mystery, the universe is not only an indivisible whole, 
but  is  also  by  its  nature,  a  universal  whose  division  and  being  broken 
up  into  parts  is  impossible  and  which  does  not  accept  participation  and 

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF SINGLE

431

numerous hands in its creation. Thus, since each part of it is a particular 
and individual part, and the whole also is a universal, it in every respect 
precludes the participation of others in it. Through this mystery of divine 
oneness, this greatest manifestation of the name of Single proves the truth 
of divine unity to the degree of being self-evident.

Yes, since the realms of beings in the universe are interwoven and inter-
bonded and the functions of each look to all, it has made the universe, in 
respect of dominicality and creation, like an indivisible whole. So too, the 
all-encompassing general acts in the universe are interwoven and interpene-
trated. For example, the acts of nurturing and giving of sustenance are appar-
ent at the same instant within the act of giving life. And the acts of ordering 
and  decking  out  the  living  creature’s  body  are  observed  at  the  same  time 
within those acts of nurturing and giving of life. And at the same time the 
acts of giving of form, raising, and regulating strike the eye within those acts 
of nurturing, giving life, ordering, and decking out. And so on, since such 
all-encompassing  and  general  acts  are  interpenetrated  and  one  within  the 
other and blended together like the seven colours in light, indeed, are united; 
and since each of those acts encompasses and embraces most beings and are 
a single act and by nature are the same; and since the one who performs the 
acts must be the same; and since each of them pervades the whole universe 
and unites with the other acts in co-operation and assistance; it has made the 
universe into an indivisible whole. Similarly, since all living creatures are 
like seeds, indexes, and samples of the universe, it has made the universe 
from the point of view of dominicality like a universal whose division and 
breaking into parts is impossible. That is to say, the universe is a totality so 
that to be Lord and Sustainer of a part of it is only possible by being Lord 
and Sustainer of the whole. And it is a universal so that each part of it has 
become like a single member; to make any one single member submit to His 
dominicality is only possible by subjugating the universal.

Sixth Indication

SIXTH INDICATION

Dominical singleness and divine unity are the means and basis of all 
perfections, 1 and the source and origin of the purposes and wisdom in the 
universe’s creation. They are also the source and sole means of attaining 

1.  In fact, divine unity is the clearest proof and most powerful evidence for the exis-
tence of endless divine perfections and beauty. For if the universe’s Maker is known to be 
the Unique One of Unity, all the perfections and beauty of the universe are known to be 
the shadows, manifestations, signs, and distillations of the sacred perfections and beauty 
present in that Maker of Unity. Otherwise the universe’s perfections and beauties would 
have pertained to creatures and causes, and the eternal treasury of divine perfections would 
have remained unknown for the human mind, and without a key.

432

THE FLASHES

the wishes and desires of conscious beings and rational beings, and partic-
ularly of man. If not for divine singleness, all man’s wishes and demands 
would be extinguished. The results of the universe’s creation would also 
decline to nothing, and the majority of existent, certain perfections would 
be annihilated.

For  example,  man  has  an  intense,  unshakeable,  passionate  desire  for 
immortality.  Only  One  who  through  the  mystery  of  singleness  holds  the 
whole universe in His grasp and can close down this world and open up the 
hereafter as easily as shutting up one house and opening another can sat-
isfy this desire. And like this one, man’s thousands of desires which stretch 
to eternity and are spread throughout the universe are tied to the mystery 
of  singleness  and  the  reality  of  divine  unity.  If  not  for  divine  singleness, 
they would not be, they would be fruitless. And if not for the Single One 
who through divine unity has disposal over the entire universe, those desires 
could not be satisfied. And even supposing they were, they would be so very 
deficiently.

It is because of this mighty mystery that the Qur’an of Miraculous Expo-
sition repeatedly and fervently and with elevated eloquence teaches divine 
unity and singleness. Similarly, all the prophets, purified scholars, and saints 
found their greatest pleasure and happiness in the profession of divine unity, 
“ There is no god but Allah. ”

Seventh Indication

SEVENTH INDICATION

Just  as  Muhammad  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  taught, 
proved, and proclaimed most perfectly the true affirmation of divine unity 
in all its degrees, so his messengership was established as surely and cer-
tainly as divine unity. For since he taught divine unity, the greatest reality 
in the sphere of existence, together with all its truths, it may be said that all 
the arguments proving divine unity indirectly though decisively prove his 
messengership, the authenticity of his duty, and the rightness of his cause. 
Yes,  a  messengership  that  discovered  and  truly  taught  divine  singleness 
and unity, which bring together those thousands of elevated truths, is most 
definitely necessitated and required by that singleness and unity; they cer-
tainly require it.

Thus, Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) carried out that 
duty to the letter. Now, we shall explain by way of example, three out of 
numerous evidences and causes that testify to the importance and elevated-
ness of his collective personality, attesting that it is a sun in the universe.

The First

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF SINGLE

433

T h e   F i r s t :  In accordance with the rule “ The cause is like the doer, ” the 
equivalent of all the good deeds performed throughout the centuries by all 
his community has passed to the book of good deeds of Muhammad ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ). So too, by thinking of the certain accept-
ance of the s a l a w ā t  prayers for the Prophet ( UWBP ), which every day all 
his community recite for him, and the station and degree that those endless 
prayers necessitate, it may be understood that the collective personality of 
Muhammad ( UWBP ) is a sun in the universe.

The Second

T h e   S e c o n d :   Think  of  Muhammad’s  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace ) spiritual progress: his essential being was the source, seed, life, and 
means of the mighty tree of the world of Islam: it arose from his perform-
ing before all others with his extraordinary capacity and faculties the sacred 
worship and glorifications which form the spiritual aspects of the world of 
Islam, perceiving all their meaning; so understand how much more elevated 
than  other  sainthoods  was  the  sainthood  of  Muhammadan  ( UWBP )  wor-
ship, by which he rose to the rank of Allah’s beloved.

At  one  time,  a  single  glorification  was  unfolded  to  me  in  one  of  the 
prayers in a manner close to how the Companions of the Prophet perceived 
them, and it appeared to me as important as a month’s worship. I under-
stood the Companions’ high worth. It meant that in the early days of Islam, 
the effulgence and light proceeding from the sacred words had a different 
quality.  Their  newness  imparted  a  different  flavour,  subtlety,  and  fresh-
ness that with the passage of time have become obscured and have dimin-
ished through neglect. With his wondrous capacity Muhammad ( UWBP ) 
received  them  new  and  fresh  from  their  original  source,  the  Most  Pure 
and Holy Essence, and absorbed and assimilated them. He could therefore 
receive the effulgence from a single glorification that others could receive 
only from a years’ worship.

From this you may understand the degree Muhammad ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ) progressed through the degrees of perfections, which 
are without bound or limit.

The Third

T h e   T h i r d :  Since mankind is the pivot of all the Creator’s purposes in 
the  universe;  and  since  with  his  superior  understanding  man  has  received 
the  addresses  of  that  Glorious  One;  and  since  Muhammad  ( UWBP )  was 
the most famous and renowned of mankind, and as his works and achieve-
ments testify, its most perfect and magnificent individual; that Single One of 
Glory took Muhammad ( UWBP ) as His addressee in the name of mankind, 

434

THE FLASHES

indeed, on account of the whole universe; He made manifest in him bound-
less effulgences in endless perfections.

There are numerous points like these three that prove conclusively that 
just  as  the  collective  personality  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP )  is  the  spiritual 
sun of the universe, so is it the supreme sign of the mighty Qur’an known as 
the universe, and the greatest name of that Supreme Distinguisher between 
Truth  and  Falsehood,  and  the  mirror  of  the  greatest  manifestation  of  the 
name  of  Single.  We  beseech  the  Single,  Unique,  Eternally  Besought  One 
that blessings and peace to the number of particles of the universe multiplied 
by  the  seconds  of  the  minutes  of  all  time  descend  on  Muhammad  ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) from the infinite treasury of His mercy.

The index-like answer to the questions “ What is life? ”and “ What is its 
true nature and purpose? ”, which are a greatest manifestation of the names 
of Ever-Living and Giver of Life, is this:

FIRST SIGN

Life is:

The most important aim of the universe;
Its greatest result;
Its most brilliant light;
Its subtlest leaven;
Its distilled essence;
Its most perfect fruit;
Its most elevated perfection;
Its finest beauty;
Its most beautiful adornment;

The secret of its undividedness;
The bond of its unity;
The source of its perfections;
In  regard  to  art  and  nature,  a  most  wondrous  being  endowed  with 
spirit;
A miraculous reality which makes the tiniest creature into a universe;
A most extraordinary miracle of divine power that connects the ani-
mate creature to most beings and makes it a tiny universe as well as 
being the means whereby the universe is situated in a tiny animate 
creature  and  displays  a  sort  of  index  of  the  huge  universe  in  the 
creature;
A wondrous divine art that makes a tiny part the greatest whole, and 
makes a particular a universal-like world, and shows that in regard to 
dominicality the universe is an indivisible whole or universal that can-
not be broken into parts and which accepts no participation;
Among the essential attributes of the universe, the most brilliant, the 
most decisive, and the most perfect of proofs testifying to the neces-
sary existence of the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One; and among 
divine artefacts is the most unknown and most apparent, and the most 
valuable and abundant, and the purest, most shining, and most mean-
ingful embroidery of dominical art; 
A  graceful,  refined,  delicate  manifestation  of  divine  mercy  which 
makes other beings serve itself;
A comprehensive mirror of the divine attributes;
A wonder of dominical creation comprising the manifestations of such 
numerous most beautiful names as Merciful, Provider, Compassion-
ate, Munificent, and All-Wise, that subjects to itself many truths like 
sustenance, wisdom, grace, and mercy, and is the source and origin of 
all the senses, like sight, hearing, and touch;
A transformation-machine in the vast workshop of the universe that 
continuously cleanses everywhere, purifies, allows progress, and illu-
minates, while living bodies, the dwellings of life, are guesthouses, 
schools,  and  barracks  for  instructing  and  illuminating  the  caravans 
of particles, enabling them to perform their duties. Quite simply, by 
means  of  the  machine  of  life  the  Ever-Living  Self-Subsistent  One 
makes subtle this dark, transient, lowly world, illuminates it and gives 
it a sort of permanence, preparing it to go to another, everlasting world;
Life’s two faces, that is, its inner and outer faces, are both shining,

elevated, and without dirt or defect. It is an exceptional creature on 
which apparent causes have not been placed, veiling the disposal of 
power, in order to show clearly that it has emerged directly without 
veil or means from the hand of dominical power;
The reality of life looks to the six pillars of belief, proving them in 
meaning and indirectly. That is to say, it is a luminous truth which 
powerfully looks to and necessitates both the necessary existence of 
the Necessarily Existent One and His eternal life, and the realm of the 
hereafter and everlasting life, and the existence of the angels, and the 
other pillars of belief.
Also, just as life is the purest essence of the universe, distilled from it, 
so it is a mighty mystery producing thanks, worship, praise, and love, 
the most important divine purposes in the universe and most impor-
tant results of the world’s creation.

So consider these twenty-nine significant, valuable characteristics of life, 
and elevated, general duties. Then look and see the tremendousness of the 
name of Ever-Living behind the name of Giver of Life. Understand too how 
with these immense characteristics and fruits of life, the name of Ever-Liv-
ing is a greatest name.

Also  understand  that  since  life  is  the  most  important  result  of  the  uni-
verse, and its greatest aim and most valuable fruit, it must have an aim and 
result as vast as the universe. For the tree’s result is its fruit, so the fruit’s 
result is the future tree by means of the seed. Yes, just as the aim and result 
of  this  life  is  eternal  life,  so  one  of  its  fruits  is  thanks  to  the  Ever-Living 
Giver of Life, and worship and praise of Him and love for Him. And just as 
this thanks, love, praise and worship are the fruit of life, so are they the aim 
of the universe.

Understand also from this, the ugly ignorance and denial, indeed, unbe-
lief, of those who say that the purpose of life is to live comfortably, enjoy 
oneself heedlessly, and indulge oneself in pleasure, and how they denigrate 
and insult the precious bounty of life, gift of consciousness, and bounty of 
reason, and what ghastly ingratitude they display.

One  would  have  to  write  treatises  to  the  number  of  life’s  attributes  to 
explain all its degrees, attributes, and duties, mentioned in the index in the 
First Sign, for this life is a maximum manifestation of the name of Ever-Liv-
ing and a most subtle manifestation of the name of Giver of Life. Since some 
of them have been elucidated in various parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , we refer 

438

THE FLASHES

you to them for some of the details, and here point out only a few others.

It was said in the twenty-third of the twenty-nine properties of life that 
since life’s two faces are transparent and unsullied, apparent causes have not 
been made a veil to the disposals of dominical power.

Yes,  the  meaning  of  this  is  as  follows:  for  sure  everything  in  the  uni-
verse  contains  good  and  beauty,  while  evil  and  ugliness  are  minor,  and 
have  the  function  of  being  units  of  measurement  to  show  the  degrees  of 
good  and  beauty  and  to  augment  and  multiply  their  realities.  In  this  way 
the evil becomes good and the ugliness, beauty. And apparent causes have 
been made a veil to the disposals of power so that the complaints and anger 
arising  from  what  are  to  the  superficial  view  of  conscious  beings  appar-
ently ugliness, badness, disasters, and calamities, should not be directed to 
the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One, and so that the contact of sacred, 
pure divine power with apparently vile and filthy things should not offend 
the dignity of power. The causes cannot create, but have been placed to be 
the target of unjust complaints and objections and to preserve the dignity, 
sacredness, and unblemished nature of divine power.

As is explained in the Introduction to the Second Station of the Twenty-
Second Word, Azra’il ( Upon whom be peace ) supplicated Almighty Allah 
concerning his duty of seizing the spirits of the dying, saying: “ Your serv-
ants will be angry with me. ” He was told in reply: “ I shall place the veil of 
illness and calamity between your duty and the dying, then they shall fling 
their arrows of complaint and objection, not at you, but at those veils. ”

According  to  this  supplication,  Azra’il’s  ( Upon  whom  be  peace )  duty 
is a veil as other causes are apparent veils, so that the anger and complaints 
of those who do not see the true, beautiful face of death – beautiful for the 
people  of  belief  –  and  do  not  know  the  manifestation  of  mercy  on  it,  are 
not directed to the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One. Yes, dignity and 
grandeur  require  that  causes  are  curtain-holders  to  the  Hand  of  Power  in 
the mind’s view, while divine unity and glory demand that causes withdraw 
their hands and have no true effect.

However,  since  both  the  outer  and  inner  faces  of  life  are  without  dirt, 
defect,  or  fault,  there  is  nothing  to  invite  complaints  and  objections;  they 
hold no filth or ugliness contrary to the dignity and sacredness of power. The 
faces of life, therefore, have been surrendered directly, without veil, to the 
hand of the life-giving, restoring, resurrecting name of the Ever-Living Self-
Subsistent One. Light is the same, and so are existence and the giving of 
existence. For this reason, creation and the giving of existence look directly 

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF EVER-LIVING

439

without veil to the power of the All-Glorious One. Moreover, since rain is a 
sort of life and mercy, the time of its precipitation has not been made subject 
to a regular law, so that at all times of need hands will be raised to the divine 
court to seek it. If like the rising of the sun, rain had been subject to a law, 
that vital bounty would not have been sought and asked for at times of need.

THIRD SIGN

It was said in the twenty-ninth property of life that just as the result of the 
universe is life, so are thanks and worship the result of life, and the cause and 
ultimate reason for the universe’s creation, and its desired result.

Yes,  the  universe’s  Ever-Living  Self-Subsistent  Maker  certainly  wants 
thanks  and  love  from  living  creatures  in  return  for  His  making  Himself 
known  and  loved  through  so  many  sorts  of  bounties,  and  He  wants  their 
praise and laudation in return for His precious arts, and for His creatures to 
respond with worship and obedience to His dominical commands.

In accordance with this mystery of dominicality, it is because thanks and 
worship are the most important purpose of every sort of life and therefore of 
the whole universe that the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition urges thanks 
and worship with fervour, intensity, and sweetness. It states repeatedly that 
worship is for Allah alone, thanks is due only to Him, and praise is particu-
lar to Him. To state that thanks and worship should go directly to its True 
Owner, verses like,

point out that He holds life together with all its attributes, without veil, in 
the grasp of His power, and they reject intermediaries explicitly, and ascribe 
life  directly  to  the  Ever-Living  and  Self-Subsistent  One’s  hand  of  power, 
restricting it to Him. The verses,

( 51:58 ) Z Y X W V
( 26:80 ) Å Ä Ã Â
( 42:28 ) ´ ³ ² ± ° ¯ ® ¬
show  that  things  which  provoke  thanks  such  as  sustenance,  healing  and 

440

THE FLASHES

rain, which also invite gratitude and thanks and stimulate a feeling of love 
and praise, also pertain directly to the Healing Provider, and that causes and 
intermediaries are a veil; that is, that sustenance, healing, and rain are par-
ticular to and restricted to the power of the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent 
One. To express this in accordance with the rules of grammar, the restric-
tive pronoun, “ For Allah is He Who ” W V and “ He is the One that ” 
® ¬ has been used. The True Healer is the one who gives medicines 
their properties and creates their effects.

It was explained concerning the twenty-eighth property of life, that life 

looks to the six pillars of belief and proves them; it points to their truth.

Yes, since life is the most important result and fruit of the universe, and 
the purpose of its creation, certainly that elevated reality is not restricted to 
this fleeting, brief, deficient, painful worldly life. The aim and result of the 
tree of life, the immensity of which is understood through its twenty-nine 
properties, and the fruit commensurate with its immensity, is eternal life and 
the life of the hereafter; it is life in the realm of bliss, the very stones, trees, 
and earth of which are alive. The tree of life, decked out with this many sig-
nificant members, would otherwise remain without fruit, benefit, purpose, 
and reality for intelligent beings and especially for man. Then man, whose 
capital and faculties are twenty times greater and more numerous than those 
of a sparrow and is the most exalted and important creature in the universe, 
and the highest living being, would fall lower than a sparrow in respect of 
the happiness of life, and become the most unhappy, the most debased of 
wretches.

Furthermore, by dwelling on the pains of the past and fears of the future, 
the intelligence, the most precious of bounties, would continuously wound 
the human heart; because it mixes nine pains with a single pleasure, it would 
become a calamitous affliction. This would be false to the hundredth degree. 
That is to say, the life of this world proves the pillar of belief in the hereafter 
decisively and in the spring, lays before our eyes more than three hundred 
thousand examples of the resurrection of the dead.

Is it at all possible that the All-Powerful Disposer of Affairs, Who pre-
pares with wisdom, grace, and mercy in your body, garden and country all 
the things and members necessary and appropriate for your life; who makes 
them reach you at the right  time; who knows and hears even the tiny, partic-
ular prayer for food offered by your stomach through its desire for continued 

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF EVER-LIVING

441

existence; and gratifies it, showing with innumerable delicious foods that He 
accepts its prayer – is it at all possible He does not see you and know you; 
would  not  prepare  everything  necessary  for  eternal  life,  mankind’s  great-
est goal; and would not accept mankind’s most urgent, important, univer-
sal prayer for immortality, of which it is worthy, through constructing the 
hereafter and creating Paradise; that He would not hear man’s most power-
ful, general prayer, which rings out from the ground to the divine throne, 
although he is the ruler and result of the earth, nor hold him as important as 
a stomach, would not gratify him, so make him deny His perfect wisdom and 
endless mercy? Allah forbid, a hundred thousand times!

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  He  should  hear  the  most  secret  voice  of  the 
tiniest particular of life, heed its plaint, supply its cure, answer its want, 
nourish it solicitously, cause others to serve it attentively, and make His 
large creatures assist it; then not hear the thunderous voice of the largest 
and most valuable, immortal, most delicate life; and not take into consid-
eration its powerful plea and prayer for immortality? That He should equip 
and superintend a common soldier with the greatest care and disregard a 
magnificent, obedient army? That He should see an atom and not see the 
sun?  That He should hear the buzzing of a mosquito and not hear the roar 
of thunder? Allah forbid! A hundred thousand times, Allah forbid!

Could the reason in any way accept that an All-Powerful and All-Wise 
One  who  is  infinitely  merciful,  loving,  and  compassionate,  who  greatly 
loves His own art, makes Himself much loved, and loves greatly those who 
love Him, would condemn to everlasting death the life that loves Himself 
more than anything, is lovable and loved and by nature loves its Maker, 
condemn to death the spirit, the essence and substance of life; would He 
offend and make angry with Himself for all eternity that beloved friend of 
His, and wounding him in terrible fashion deny the mystery of His mercy 
and light of His love, and make him deny it? A hundred thousand times, 
Allah forbid! The absolute beauty which adorns the universe with its mani-
festation, the absolute mercy which makes happy all creatures, is most cer-
tainly exempt from such infinite ugliness, far elevated above such absolute 
tyranny, such unkindness. 

C o n c l u s i o n : Since there is life in this world, those who understand the 
secret of life and do not misuse their lives will manifest eternal life in the 
realm of eternity and everlasting Paradise. In this we believe!

Shining objects on the face of the earth glistening with the sun’s reflec-
tion, and bubbles on the surface of the sea sparkling and dying away with 

442

THE FLASHES

flashes of light and the bubbles that follow on after them again acting as mir-
rors to the imaginary miniature suns, self-evidently show that those flashes 
are the reflections and manifestations of a single, elevated sun. They recall 
the sun’s existence with various tongues, and point to it with their fingers 
of light.

In  just  the  same  way,  through  the  greatest  manifestation  of  the  Ever-
Living and Self-Subsistent One’s name of Giver of Life, the living creatures 
on the earth and in the sea shine through divine power, and in order to make 
way  for  those  that  follow  after  them,  utter  “ O  Living  One! ”  and  vanish 
behind the veil of the Unseen, thus indicating and testifying to the life and 
necessary existence of the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One, who pos-
sesses eternal life. 

Furthermore, all the evidences testifying to divine knowledge, the effect 
of which is apparent in the ordering of all creatures; and all the proofs dem-
onstrating the power which has disposal over the universe; and all the evi-
dences proving the will and volition which governs and directs the universe; 
and all the signs and miracles proving the missions of the prophets, the chan-
nels of divine revelation and dominical speech; and all the evidences attest-
ing to the seven divine attributes – all these unanimously indicate, denote, 
and testify to the life of the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One. 

For if a thing has sight, it also has life; and if it has hearing, it is a sign of 
life; and if it has speech, it points to the existence of life; and if it has will 
and choice, it shows life. Thus, attributes such as absolute power, compre-
hensive will, and all-embracing knowledge, the existence of which is clear 
and certain due to their works and effects in the universe, testify, through all 
their evidences, to the life and necessary existence of the Ever-Living and 
Self-Subsistent One, the eternal life which illuminates the whole universe 
with a single of its shadows, and, through a single of its manifestations gives 
life to the realm of the hereafter, even its very particles.

Life looks also to the pillar of belief in the angels and proves it indirectly. 
For since the most important result of the universe is life; and it is living 
beings that are most widely spread, and because of their value, their copies 
are most duplicated, and who populate the guesthouse of the earth with their 
travelling caravans; and since the globe of the earth has been filled with so 
many species of living creatures, and for the purpose of renewing and multi-
plying the animate species is continuously emptied and refilled; and since life 
is created on it in even rotting and corrupt matter and it has become a mass 
of  micro-organisms;  and  since  consciousness  and  intelligence,  the  purest 

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF EVER-LIVING

443

distilled essence of life, and spirit, its most subtle and stable substance, are 
created in great profusion on the earth, and quite simply the earth has been 
infused with life through life, intelligence, consciousness, and spirits, and 
inhabited in that way; since this is so, surely the heavenly bodies, which are 
subtler, more luminous, larger and more important than the earth, could not 
be dead, inanimate, lacking life and consciousness; it would be beyond the 
bounds of possibility. That is to say, in accordance with the mystery of life, 
there will surely be living, conscious inhabitants of the skies, the suns, and 
the stars suitable to the heavens, who will endow them with their living state, 
demonstrate the result of the creation of the heavens, and receive the divine 
addresses; and they are the angels.

The essential nature of life also looks to the pillar of belief in the mes-
sengers, and proves it indirectly. Yes, since the universe was created for 
life, and life is a greatest manifestation of the Pre-Eternal Self-Subsistent 
One,  a  perfect  inscription  of  His,  a  most  beautiful  work  of  His  art;  and 
since the Eternal Life shows Itself through the sending of messengers and 
revealing of scriptures, for if there were no Books or messengers, that Pre-
Eternal Life would not be known – just as it is through his speech that it is 
understood that a person is alive, so too it is messengers and the scriptures 
they bring that make known the words and speech of the One who speaks 
from beyond the World of the Unseen, beneath the veil of the universe, 
who commands and prohibits and utters His address – then certainly just 
as the life in the universe testifies decisively to the necessary existence of 
the Pre-Eternal Ever-Living One, it looks also to the pillars of belief the 
sending  of  messengers  and  revelation  of  scriptures,  which  are  the  rays, 
manifestations,  and  communications  of  that  Pre-Eternal  Life.  And  since 
the  messengership  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP )  and  the  Qur’anic  revelation 
are like the spirit and intelligence of life, it may be said that their truth is 
as certain as the existence of life.

Yes, just as life is the distilled essence of the universe; and consciousness 
and sense perception are distilled from life and are the essence of life; and 
intelligence too is distilled from consciousness and sense perception and is 
the essence of consciousness; and spirit is the pure, unsullied substance of 
life, its stable and autonomous essence; so too, the physical and spiritual life 
of Muhammad ( UWBP ) is the distilled quintessence of the life and spirit 
of the universe; and the messengership of Muhammad ( UWBP ) is the very 
purest essence distilled from the senses, consciousness, and intelligence of 
the universe. Indeed, the physical and spiritual life of Muhammad ( UWBP ), 

444

THE FLASHES

is, through the testimony of its works, the very life of the universe’s life. 
And Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) messengership is the consciousness and light 
of the universe’s consciousness. While the Qur’anic revelation, according to 
the testimony of its living truths, is the spirit of the universe’s life and the 
intelligence of its consciousness.

Yes, yes, yes! If the light of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) messengership were 
to depart from the universe, the universe would die. If the Qur’an were to 
depart, the universe would go mad, the earth would lose its head and its rea-
son; it would even strike its now unconscious head on a planet and Dooms-
day would occur.

Life also looks to the pillar of belief in divine determining and proves 
it indirectly. Because, since life is the light of the Manifest World, and it 
dominates it, and is the result and aim of existence, and since it is the most 
comprehensive mirror of the Creator of the Universe and the most perfect 
sample and index of dominical activity, and – let there be no mistake in the 
comparison – is like a sort of programme; for sure, the mystery of life neces-
sitates that the creatures in the World of the Unseen, that is, the past and the 
future, that is, that have been and will come, are predisposed to conform to 
order, regularity, being known and observed, specific individual existence, 
and the creative commands, which are their lives in one respect.

The original seed of a tree and its root, as well as the seeds contained in its 
fruit and final outcome, all manifest a sort of life no less than the tree itself; 
indeed, they bear within themselves laws of life more subtle than those of 
the tree. Similarly, the seeds and roots left by last autumn, before the present 
spring, as well as the seeds and roots that will be left to subsequent springs 
after this spring has departed – they all bear the manifestations of life, just 
like  this  spring,  and  are  subject  to  the  laws  of  life.  In  just  the  same  way, 
all the branches and twigs of the cosmic tree each have a past and a future. 
They have a chain consisting of past and future stages and circumstances. 
The multiple existences and stages of each species and each member of each 
species, existing in divine knowledge, forms a chain of being as knowledge, 
and like its external existence, its existence as knowledge is a manifestation 
of universal life that draws all the aspects of its life from these meaningful 
and vital Tablets of divine determining.

The fact that the World of Spirits – which is one form of the World of 
the Unseen – is full of the essence of life, the matter of life, and the spirits, 
which  are  the  substances  and  essence  of  life,  of  a  certainty  demands  and 
requires that the past and future – which are another form of the World of 

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF EVER-LIVING

445

the Unseen and its second segment – should also receive the manifestation 
of life.

In  addition,  the  perfect  order,  the  meaningful  circumstances  and  vital 
fruits  and  stages  inherent  in  the  existence  of  a  thing  as  knowledge,  also 
demonstrate the manifestation of a sort of life. Such a manifestation of life, 
which is the light emitted by the sun of eternal life, cannot be limited to this 
Manifest World, this present time, this external existence. On the contrary, 
each  world  receives  the  manifestation  of  that  light  in  accordance  with  its 
capacity, and the cosmos together with all its worlds is alive and illumined 
through it. Otherwise, as the misguided imagine, beneath a temporary and 
apparent life, each world would be a vast and terrible corpse, a dark ruin.

One broad aspect of the pillar of belief in divine determining and decree 
is,  then,  understood  through  the  mystery  of  life  and  is  established  by  it. 
Just  as  the  life  and  vitality  of  the  Manifest  World  and  existent,  visible 
objects become apparent from their orderliness and the consequences of 
their existence, so too past and future creatures – regarded as belonging 
to the World of the Unseen – have an immaterial existence and sort of life 
and a spiritual presence as knowledge. The trace of this life and presence 
is made manifest and known by means of the tablet of divine determining 
and decree and through all the stages and circumstances of their external 
lives and existences.

Also, it was said concerning the sixteenth property of life that when life 
enters a thing, it makes it into a world; if a part, it affords it the comprehen-
siveness of a whole; if a particular, the extensiveness of a universal.

Yes, life possesses such extensiveness it is simply a comprehensive mir-
ror of divine oneness, showing in itself most of the divine names manifested 
throughout the universe. When life enters a body, it makes it a small world; 
like a sort of seed of the tree of the universe, containing an index of it. In the 
same way that a seed can only be the work of a power capable of making the 
tree that bears it, the one who creates the tiniest living beings has to be the 
Creator of all the universe.

Thus, through this comprehensiveness, life demonstrates in itself a most 
obscure mystery of divine oneness. That is, like the mighty sun is present 
with its light, reflection, and seven colours in every drop of water and frag-
ment of glass facing it, so the divine names and attributes which encompass 
the universe are manifested together in all living beings. From this point of 

446

THE FLASHES

view, in regard to creation and dominicality, life makes the universe into an 
indivisible whole, a universal whose being broken into parts and in which 
others can share is outside the bounds of possibility.

Yes, the stamp on your face shows self-evidently that the One who cre-
ates  you  is  the  One  who  creates  all  humankind.  For  the  nature  of  man’s 
creation is the same; it cannot be split up. Also, by means of life the parts 
of  the  universe  are  like  the  individual  members  of  mankind,  and  the  uni-
verse, like the species. It shows the seal of divine oneness and stamp of eter-
nal besoughtedness on every individual, the same as it shows them on the 
whole, thus in every way repulsing the associating of partners with Allah.

Also, there are such extraordinarily wondrous miracles of dominical art 
in life that one, a power, that cannot create the whole universe cannot create 
the tiniest animate creature. Yes, a pen that inscribes in a tiny seed the index 
of the huge pine tree, and the programme of its life, like writing the whole 
Qur’an in a chickpea, can surely be none other than the pen that writes the 
heavens together with the stars. And the one who places in the tiny head of 
a bee the ability and faculties to know the flowers in the garden of the uni-
verse, be connected with most of its realms, convey a gift of divine mercy 
like honey, and know on the day it comes into the world the conditions of 
life, can surely be none other than the Creator of the entire universe.

I n   S h o r t : Life is a shining seal of divine unity on the face of the universe; 
and in respect of life all beings with spirits are stamps of divine oneness; 
and  the  embroideries  and  art  in  every  living  being  form  a  seal  of  eternal 
besoughtedness; and living creatures set their signatures with their lives on 
the missive of the universe in the name of the Ever-Living and Self-Sub-
sistent One to their number, and are seals of divine unity, stamps of divine 
oneness, and signets of divine eternal besoughtedness. Similarly, just as all 
living beings are seals of divine unity in this book of the universe, like life; 
so a seal of divine oneness has been placed of the faces and features of each.
Furthermore, just as life forms signatures and seals testifying to the unity 
of the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One to the number of its particulars 
and of animate beings, the act of raising and restoring to life also puts sig-
natures to divine unity to the number of beings. For example, the raising to 
life of the earth, which is one example of such restoration, testifies to divine 
unity as brilliantly as the sun. For in the raising to life of the earth in spring, 
three hundred thousand species together with all the species’ innumerable 
individual members are restored to life one within the other, without fault or 
defect, in perfect, regular order. The one who performs a single act such as 

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF EVER-LIVING

447

that together with innumerable other orderly acts must surely be the Creator 
of all beings and the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One, and the Single 
One of Unity any partnership in whose dominicality is impossible.

For now, this small number of life’s properties has been described briefly, 
and we refer the explanation and detailed discussion of its other properties to 
the R i s a l e - i   N u r  and to another time.

Conclusion

Conclusion
The greatest name is not the same for everyone; it differs. For example, 
for  Imam  ‘Ali  ( May  Allah  be  pleased  with  him )  it  was  the  six  names  of 
Single, Ever-Living, Self-Subsistent, Sapient, All-Just, and Most Holy. For 
Imam al-A‘zam, it was two names; Sapient and All-Just. While for Ghawth 
al-A‘zam  it  was  Ever-Living.  For  Imam  Rabbani,  the  greatest  name  was 
Self-Subsistent, and so on; many other people held different names to be the 
greatest name.

In connection with this Fifth Point being about the name of Ever-Living, 
as both a blessing, and a witness, and an evidence, and as a sacred proof, 
and as a prayer for ourselves, and as a happy conclusion to this treatise, we 
include  the  following,  uttered  by  Allah’s  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom 
be  blessings  and  peace )  in  the  supreme  supplication  called  a l - J a u s h a n  
a l - K a b ī r , which shows the extremely elevated and comprehensive degree of 
his knowledge of Allah. We shall travel in the imagination to that time and 
saying  “ Amen ”  to  what  the  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings 
and peace ) said, shall utter the same supplication with his voice as though 
saying it ourselves:

THE SIXTH POINT
The Divine Name of Self-Subsistent

[ This point discusses the divine name of Self-Subsistent. It is a sum-
mary of the Fifth Point about the name of Ever-Living, is an addendum 
to  N u r   Ç e ş m e s i  ( T h e   F o u n t a i n h e a d   o f   L i g h t  ), and is also considered 
appropriate to be an Addendum to the Thirtieth Word. ]

An Apology

These  important  matters  concerning  the  profound,  comprehensive 
greatest manifestation of the name of Self-Subsistent occurred to me as 
separate flashes and are therefore not well-arranged. They have more-
over remained in the form of an ill-arranged, speedily written uncor-
rected rough copy. For these reasons many deficiencies and much dis-
orderliness are bound to be apparent in the phraseology and manner of 
expression. You must forgive my defects for the sake of the beauties of 
the matters discussed.

A Reminder

The points concerning the greatest name are comprehensive to the 
utmost degree and also extremely profound, especially the matters 
concerned with the name of Self-Subsistent, as are those of the First 
Ray in particular. 1 Furthermore since these latter look to the materi-
alists and have penetrated the subject to an even greater degree, eve-
ryone will not be able to understand every matter in all its aspects. 
They will, however, be able to grasp a part of each matter. Accord-
ing  to  the  rule  of  “ A  thing  should  not  be  abandoned  completely 
even if it is not wholly obtained, ” it is not reasonable to leave aside 
such a matter altogether, saying: “ I cannot pick all the fruits in this 
immaterial  garden. ”  Whatever  the  amount  of  fruit  a  person  can 
pick, it will be of benefit. For just as the matters connected with the 
greatest name are extensive to a degree beyond comprehension, so 
are they also subtle to the degree the mind cannot distinguish them. 
Not everyone’s mind will reach the Fifth and Sixth Points concern-
ing the names of Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent, in particular the 

1.  If the person reading this treatise does not have a knowledge of science, he should 

not begin with the First Ray, but with the Second and should read the First at the end.

allusions of life to the pillars of belief and particularly to the pillar 
of divine determining and decree in the Fifth Point, but they will not 
remain without some share of them and in any event these matters 
will strengthen their belief. The importance of strengthening belief, 
the  key  to  eternal  happiness,  is  truly  tremendous.  Even  an  iota’s 
increase  is  a  treasure.  Imam  Rabbani,  Ahmad  al-Faruqi,  said:  “ In 
my view, increase in only a small aspect of belief is preferable to 
hundreds of illuminations and spiritual delights. ”

Imparted to my mind during the month of Dhi’l-Qa‘da was a point con-
cerning verses like these that allude to divine Self-Subsistence, a greatest 
manifestation  of  the  name  of  Self-Subsistent,  which  is  either  the  greatest 
name, or the second of the two lights of the greatest name, or the sixth of its 
six lights. My situation in Eskişehir Prison does not allow me to explain that 
greatest light fully. However, Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) 
expounded the greatest name in his ode  A r j ū z a  under the exalted name of 
S a k ī n a , and in his ode J a l j a l ū t i y y a  he considered these six names contained 
within the greatest name together with some other sublime names, and said 
they  were  the  greatest  and  most  important.  I  have  received  extraordinary 
consolation from his discussion of them. And so, similarly to the preceeding 
five names, we shall allude to the name of Self-Subsistent, to that greatest 
light, with five rays in what is at the very least an abbreviated form.

First Ray

FIRST RAY

The universe’s Glorious Creator is Self-Subsistent, that is, He subsists, 
continues, endures of Himself. All things subsist and continue through Him, 
they remain in existence and have permanence. If the relationship of Self-
Subsistence were cut off from the universe for even the fraction of a second, 
the universe would be annihilated.

Furthermore, as the Qur’an of Mighty Stature decrees, together with the 

All-Glorious One’s Self-Subsistence,

( 42:11 ) 3 2 1

450

THE FLASHES

That is, He has no like, equal, peer, or partner in either His essence, or His 
attributes, or His actions. Indeed, it is not possible for the Most Pure and 
Holy One who holds the universe with its circumstances and functions in the 
grasp of His dominicality and regulates, administers, sustains and nurtures 
it with perfect order as though it were a house or a palace to have any like, 
equal, partner, or peer; it is impossible.

Yes, it is indeed impossible that the All-Glorious Ever-Living and Self-
Subsistent One for whom the creation of the stars is as easy as that of parti-
cles; to whose power the greatest thing is subjugated as is the most minute; 
for whom nothing is an obstacle to any other thing and no action obstructs 
any other action; in whose view innumerable individuals are present in the 
same way that a single individual is present; who hears all voices simultane-
ously and is able to answer the limitless needs of all simultaneously; outside 
the sphere of whose will and volition is nothing, no state, as is testified to 
by the order and balance of the beings in the universe; who although He is 
in no place, is present everywhere through His power and knowledge; and 
although everything is utterly distant from Him, is utterly close to them – 
that He should have any like, equal, partner, deputy, opposite or peer is not 
possible; it is impossible. His sacred qualities and attributes can be consid-
ered only through allegory and comparison. All the comparisons and allego-
ries in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  are of this sort.

Yes, the Most Pure and Holy One is without like, necessarily existent, 
utterly remote from matter, and beyond space; His fragmentation and divi-
sion are impossible in every respect as is any sort of change or alteration; 
His being needy or impotent is beyond the bounds of possibility. And yet, 
a group of the people of misguidance suppose certain manifestations of the 
Most Pure and Holy Essence which are manifested in the pages of the uni-
verse and in the levels of beings to be the Most Pure and Holy One Himself 
and  ascribe  the  decrees  of  the  divinity  to  certain  creatures;  they  attribute 
some of the All-Glorious One’s works to nature.

However, it is demonstated with conclusive proofs in numerous places 
in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  that nature is a divine art, and cannot be the artist. It is a 
dominical book, and cannot be the scribe. It is an embroidery, and cannot be 
the embroiderer. It is a register, and cannot be the accountant. It is a law, and 
cannot be the power. It is a pattern, and cannot be the source. It is a recipi-
ent and is passive, and cannot be the author. It is an order, and cannot the 
orderer. It is a code of creation, and cannot be the establisher of the code.

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF SELF-SUBSISTENT

451

If, to suppose the impossible, the tiniest animate creature was referred to 
nature and it was told: “ You made this; ” as is demonstrated in many places 
in the  R i s a l e - i   N u r  with decisive proofs, it would be necessary to provide 
moulds, or rather machines, to the number of the tiny creature’s members 
and bodily systems so that nature could carry out the work.

Moreover, although a group of the people of misguidance called materi-
alists perceived a greatest manifestation of divine creativity and dominical 
power within the orderly transformations of minute particles, since they did 
not know from where the manifestation came and could not understand from 
where  that  universal  force  was  being  directed,  which  originated  from  the 
manifestation of the Eternally Besought One’s power, they supposed matter 
and force were pre-eternal and began to attribute the divine works to parti-
cles and their motion. Glory be to Allah! Could human beings be so ignorant 
as to attribute actions and works that can only be carried out by one who is 
both beyond space and present in such a way as to see, know, and direct all 
things in the creation of all things everywhere, to particles and their motion, 
which are tossed around in the storms of lifeless, blind, unconscious chance 
that lacks will and balance? Anyone who possesses even a jot of intelligence 
must see just what an ignorant and superstitious idea this is.

Indeed,  because  those  wretches  have  abandoned  absolute  unity,  they 
have fallen into a limitless, endless absolute multiplicity. That is, since they 
do not accept one single Allah, they are compelled to accept endless gods. 
Which means that since they are unable to squeeze into their corrupted minds 
the idea of one single Most Pure and Holy Essence and the pre-eternity and 
creativity  that  are  necessary  and  essential  to  Him,  they  are  compelled  by 
their opinions to accept the pre-eternity, indeed the divinity, of those limit-
less, endless, lifeless particles.

So, come and consider this complete and utter ignorance! For certainly, 
the manifestation on particles has made that mass of particles into an orderly 
and  magnificent  army  through  the  strength,  power,  and  command  of  the 
Necessarily  Existent  One.  If  the  Commander-in-Chief’s  command  and 
power were withdrawn even for a second, that numerous, lifeless, uncon-
scious  mass  would  degenerate  into  irregular  soldiers,  it  would  altogether 
cease to exist.

Furthermore, it is as if another group of people see even further, that is, 
they are even more ignorantly misguided. They imagine the matter known 
as ether, which is an extremely subtle, fine, obedient and subjugated page 

452

THE FLASHES

of  the  Glorious  Maker’s  activities,  a  means  for  the  transmitting  of  His 
commands, a flimsy veil for the exercise of His power, a refined ink for 
His writing, a fine raiment for His creating, a leaven of His artefacts and 
a tillage for His seeds, to be the origin and the author because it acts as a 
mirror to the manifestation of His dominicality.

This  extraordinary  ignorance  requires  endless  impossibilities  because 
ether  is  matter  that  is  unconscious,  lifeless  and  without  will  and  is  finer 
than  the  matter  of  which  particles  consist,  which  drowns  the  materialists, 
and  is  denser  than  the  index  of  primordial  matter  into  which  the  ancient 
philosophers  thrust  themselves.  To  attribute  to  this  matter,  which  may  be 
fragmented and divided without limit and is equipped with the qualities and 
duties of being passive and the ability to transmit – to attribute to its minute 
particles, which are far minuter than particles of other matter, the actions and 
works that exist through a will and power that sees, knows, and directs all 
things in all things is mistaken to the number of particles of ether.

The act of creation apparent in beings is such that it demonstrates it pro-
ceeds from a power and will which sees and knows most things, the whole 
universe even, in each thing particularly if it is animate, and which recog-
nizes  and  secures  the  animate  creature’s  relationship  with  the  universe;  it 
thus demonstrates that it cannot be the act of causes, which are material and 
are not all-encompassing. Through the meaning of Self-Subsistence, a par-
ticular creative act bears a mighty meaning that points to its being directly 
the act of the Creator of the universe. For example, an act pertaining to the 
creation of a bee demonstrates that it is peculiar to the Creator of the uni-
verse in two respects.

First Respect

First  Respect:  The  fact  that  all  the  other  bees  throughout  the  world 
resembling that particular bee manifest the same act at the same time dem-
onstrates that the particular and individual act is the tip of a comprehensive 
act which embraces the face of the earth. In which case, whoever the author 
and owner of that vast act is, he must be the author of the particular act.

Second Respect

Second Respect: In order to be the author of the action directed towards 
the creation of the bee in question, a power and will are necessary that are 
vast enough to know and secure the conditions for the life of the bee, and 
its members, and its relationship with the universe. Therefore, the one who 
performs the particular action can only perform it thus perfectly by having 
authority over most of the universe.

Hence the most particular and insignificant action demonstrates in two 

respects that it is peculiar to the Creator of all things.

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF SELF-SUBSISTENT

453

The most remarkable and surprising thing is this: the Necessarily Exist-
ent One possesses necessity, which is the firmest level of existence; absolute 
isolation  from  matter,  which  is  the  most  immutable  degree  of  existence; 
absolute freedom from space, which is the state of existence furthest from 
cessation; and unity, which is the soundest quality of existence and the one 
remotest from change and non-existence. And yet they attribute pre-eternity 
and everlastingness, which are the Necessarily Existent One’s most particu-
lar qualities and are necessary and essential to Him, to things like ether and 
particles,  which  are  matter  that  is  material,  unbounded  and  numerous,  is 
the least stable level of existence and the least tangible, the most changing 
and  the  most  varying  and  the  most  dispersed  through  space;  they  ascribe 
pre-eternity  to  them  and  fancy  them  to  be  pre-eternal;  and  some  of  them 
even suppose that it is out of them that the divine works arise. It has been 
demonstrated through cogent arguments in many places in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  
how contrary to truth and reality, how unreasonable and absurd, is this idea.

This consists of two matters.
First Matter:

( 39:63 ) m l k j
These verses point to a greatest manifestation of the name of Self-Subsist-
ent. One aspect of the mighty truth that these and verses like them indicate 
is as follows:

The existence, continuance, and perpetuation of the heavenly bodies in 
the universe are tied to the mystery of Self-Subsistence. If the manifestation 
of Self-Subsistence were to avert its face for a moment, millions of globes, 
some of them a thousand times larger than the earth, would be scattered into 
the infinite void of space, and colliding with one another would crash into 
nothingness.

For example, the power of the Self-Subsistence of the One who keeps 
thousands of stately palaces in place in perfect order and makes them travel 
like aircraft through space is measured through the stability, order, and con-
tinuance of those palaces in space. So too a measure of the greatest mani-
festation of the name of Self-Subsistent are the facts that the All-Glorious 
and Self-Subsistent One bestows on the innumerable heavenly bodies within 
ethereal matter a stability, permanence, and continuance within the utmost 

454

THE FLASHES

order  and  balance  through  the  mystery  of  Self-Subsistence;  and  together 
with  upholding  without  prop  or  support  in  the  void  millions  of  mighty 
globes, some a thousand and some even a million times larger than the earth, 
entrusts them all with duties and causes them to submit in perfect obedience 
like a majestic army to the decrees proceeding from the command of “ ‘ B e ! ’ 
a n d   i t   i s . ” The particles of all beings also exist, like the stars, through the 
mystery of Self-Subsistence, and are permanent and continue through it.

The  particles  in  an  animate  creature’s  body  do  not  disperse  but  are 
assembled in groups and systems peculiar to each limb, and without scat-
tering, preserve their position within the storms of the elements, which flow 
like floods, and remain regular and in order. Since this self-evidently does 
not occur through themselves but through the mystery of Self-Subsistence, 
and since each body is like a disciplined regiment and each species like a 
regular army, these particles proclaim the mystery of Self-Subsistence with 
innumerable tongues in the same way that the continuance and motion of 
animate creatures and their assemblages on the earth and that of the stars in 
the world of space proclaim it.

Second Matter

Second  Matter:  This  station  requires  that  some  of  the  benefits  and 
instances of wisdom in things connected with the mystery of Self-Subsist-
ence are pointed out. 

The wisdom in the existence of things, and the aims of their natures, the 

benefits in their creation, and the results of their lives are of three sorts.

T h e   F i r s t   S o r t  looks to each thing itself and to man and to man’s affairs.
T h e   S e c o n d   S o r t  is more important. It is the meanings of all things being 
set out for innumerable readers, for each is a sign, a missive, a book, an ode 
for conscious beings to study, an indication making known the manifesta-
tion of the Glorious Creator’s names.

T h e   T h i r d   S o r t :   This  concerns  the  Glorious  Maker  and  looks  to  Him. 
While one of the benefits and results of things look to the things themselves, 
countless look to the Glorious Maker. For the Glorious Maker beholds the 
wonders of His art Himself, He observes the manifestation of His names in 
the beings which He Himself has fashioned. In regard to this mighty third 
sort, it is sufficient if beings live only for a second.

Another  mystery  of  Self-Subsistence  that  requires  the  existence  of  all 

things will be explained in the Third Ray.

At one time I was investigating the talisman of the universe and riddle of 
creation, which lies in its being a manifestation, together with the instances 

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF SELF-SUBSISTENT

455

of wisdom and benefits in beings, and I asked: “ I wonder why these things 
display themselves in this way, then swiftly vanish and are lost? I look at 
their individual features; they have been attired, decked out and adorned in 
an orderly, purposeful fashion and sent to this display and exhibition. But 
then they disappear in a day or two, and some of them within a few minutes; 
uselessly and in vain they vanish. What is the purpose in their being seen by 
us for this brief time? ” I was most curious.

Then, through divine favour, I discovered an important instance of wis-
dom in the fact that beings, in particular animate beings, come into the place 
of instruction that is this world. It was as follows: each being, and especially 
if it is animate, is an extremely meaningful word, missive, dominical ode 
and divine proclamation. After it has been studied by intelligent beings and 
has stated its meaning to innumerable readers, its corporeal form, which is 
like a letter or a word, disappears.

For about a year this instance of wisdom was sufficient for me. Then the 
truly wonderful and subtle miracles of art to be found in creatures, in par-
ticular in animate beings, were disclosed. I understood that these subtleties 
of art which are so fine and wonderful are not only to set forth meanings 
for the gazes of intelligent beings. For although innumerable such creatures 
may study each being, their studying is both limited, and not all of them will 
be able to penetrate all the subtleties of art in those animate beings. That is 
to say, the most important result of the creation of animate beings and the 
most significant purpose of their natures is to present to the Pre-Eternal Self-
Subsistent  One’s  own  gaze  the  marvels  of  His  art  and  the  compassionate 
gifts and bounties He has bestowed.

As for this purpose, it satisfied me for a long time and from it I under-
stood the following: the wisdom and purpose of creation, which is to present 
the endless subtleties of art in beings, particularly in animate beings, to the 
gaze  of  the  Pre-Eternally  Self-Subsistent  One,  that  is,  for  He  Himself  to 
behold His own art, was sufficient for that vast outlay.

Some time later I realized that the subtleties of art in the individual fea-
tures and forms of beings did not continue; they were being renewed and 
were undergoing change at great speed; they were being transformed within 
an endless activity and creativity. I started to ponder over it, saying: “ The 
wisdom in this creativity and activity must necessarily be as extensive as the 
activity itself. ” Then, the two instances of wisdom mentioned above began 
to seem insufficient; they lacked something. With extreme curiosity I began 
to search and seek for a further purpose and instance of wisdom.

THE FLASHES

All praise be to Allah, through the effulgence of the Qur’an of Miraculous 
Exposition, after some time a vast, limitless wisdom and purpose became 
apparent at the level of the mystery of Self-Subsistence. And through it, the 
divine mystery called the talisman of the universe and riddle of creation was 
understood. It is explained in detail in the Twenty-Fourth Letter, so here in 
the Third Ray we shall briefly mention only two or three points.

Look from this point to the manifestation of the mystery of Self-Subsist-
ence: it has plucked all beings out of non-existence, and according to the 
meaning of the verse,

( 13:2 ) 9 8 7 6 5 4 3
has caused each one of them to remain in infinite space. It has bestowed sta-
bility and permanence on them, and caused them all to display the manifes-
tation of the mystery of Self-Subsistence. If not for this support, nothing at 
all could continue to exist of its own accord. Everything would topple over 
into the infinite void and tumble into non-existence.

Furthermore, just as all beings rely on the All-Glorious Self-Subsistent 
One for their existence, stability, and permanence, they continue in exist-
ence through Him, so according to the meaning of the verse,

 ( 11:123 ) g f e d
the  tips  of  thousands  of  chains  or  lines  in  the  states  and  conditions  of 
beings are fastened to the mystery of Self-Subsistence, which, if the com-
parison is not mistaken, is like the centre or central pole of telephone and 
telegraph lines. If they did not rely on that luminous point of support, thou-
sands of unending sequences of causes would be necessary, which accord-
ing to scholars is an impossible and false notion; in fact, there would have 
to be as many of these absurd unending sequences of causes as there are 
beings. For example, one thing – protection or light or existence or suste-
nance, for instance – in one respect relies on the next thing, and that on the 
next, and that on the next, until finally since it cannot be infinite, it has to 
come to an end.

Thus, the end of all such lines and sequences lies in the mystery of Self-
Subsistence. But when this mystery has been understood, the links and the 
meaning of each thing relying on the next in those imaginary sequences do 
not  remain,  they  disappear  and  everything  is  seen  to  look  directly  to  the 
mystery of Self-Subsistence.

Third Ray

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF SELF-SUBSISTENT

457

THIRD RAY

By means of one or two introductory points, we shall point out to a small 
degree the disclosure of the mystery of Self-Subsistence within divine crea-
tivity and dominical activity, which verses like the following allude to:

 ( 85:16 ) Ë Ê É    (   55:29 ) j i h g f
 ( 36:83 ) Ì Ë Ê É     ( 30:54 ) ] \ [   
( 30:50 ) Ö Õ Ô Ó Ò Ñ Ð Ï Î Í 
T h e   F i r s t :  When we look at the universe, we see that one group of crea-
tures, which are tossed around in the flood of time and follow on one after 
the other convoy after convoy, come for a second and then immediately van-
ish. Another group comes for a minute and then passes on. One species stops 
by in the Manifest Word for an hour, then enters the World of the Unseen. 
Some of them come and alight in the Manifest World for a day, some of 
them for a year, some for a century, and some for an age; they perform their 
duties and then depart.

This astonishing travelling and passage of beings and flow and flux of 
creatures is driven and directed with such order, balance and wisdom, and 
the one who commands them and those convoys does so with such insight, 
purpose and planning that even if all minds were to unite and become one 
mind, it would be unable to comprehend the essence of this wise direction; it 
would be unable to find any fault in it and so could not criticize it. 

Thus, within this dominical activity, not allowing any of those pleasing 
creatures that it loves, especially animate creatures, to open their eyes, the 
pen of divine determining and decree despatches them to the World of the 
Unseen; not permitting them even to draw a breath, it discharges them from 
the life of this world. It continuously fills the guesthouse of the world and 
empties it without the guests’ consent. Making the globe of the earth like a 
slate for writing and erasing, through the manifestation of

( 2:258 ) O N
the pen of divine determining and decree ceaselessly inscribes writings on it, 
and renews and replaces them.

One meaning of the wisdom in this dominical activity and divine creativ-
ity and a fundamental requirement and a motive cause of them is a limit-
less, endless instance of wisdom that may be divided into three important 
branches.

458

The First Branch

THE FLASHES

The First Branch of that wisdom is this: Every sort of activity, whether 
particular  or  universal,  yields  pleasure.  There  is  a  pleasure  in  all  activity. 
Indeed, activity is pure pleasure. Yes, activity is the manifestation of exist-
ence,  which  is  pure  pleasure  and  is  the  shaking  off  and  becoming  distant 
from non-existence, which is pure suffering.

Everyone with ability follows with pleasure the unfolding of his ability 
through activity. The revealing of innate talents through activity arises from 
a pleasure and results in a pleasure. Everyone who possesses some perfec-
tions follows with pleasure their disclosure through activity.

Since there is present in every activity a perfection and pleasure which 
is thus loved and sought after, and activity too is a perfection; and since 
there are apparent in the world of animate creatures the manifestations of 
a boundless love and infinite compassion which arise from a perpetual and 
pre-eternal life; those manifestations show that as the requirement of that 
eternal  Life  which  is  fitting  for  the  necessary  existence  of  the  One  who 
thus loves and is compassionate and makes Himself loved, and is worthy 
of His holiness, there are – if the terms are not mistaken – at the utmost 
level such sacred qualities in that Most Pure and Holy Life as divine pas-
sion, hallowed love, and sheer pleasure. And it is these qualities that con-
tinuously renew, agitate, and change the universe through endless activity 
and infinite creativity.

The Second Branch

The  Second  Branch  of  the  wisdom  in  the  limitless  divine  activity 
which looks to the mystery of Self-Subsistence: This looks to the divine 
names. It is well-known that everyone who possesses beauty wants to both 
see and display his beauty; that everyone who possesses some skills desires 
and  loves  to  attract  attention  to  his  skills  by  exhibiting  and  proclaiming 
them; he desires and loves his skill, which is a beautiful truth and meaning 
that has remained concealed, to be revealed and to find ardent admirers.

These  fundamental  rules  are  in  force  in  all  things  according  to  the 
degree  of  each.  According  to  the  testimony  of  the  universe  and  the  evi-
dence  of  the  manifestations  and  embroideries  of  the  thousand  and  one 
most beautiful names of the All-Glorious Self-Subsistent One, who pos-
sesses absolute beauty, there are in every degree of each of those names a 
true loveliness, a true perfection, a true beauty and a most exquisite truth. 
Indeed, in every degree there are endless different sorts of loveliness and 
innumerable beautiful truths.

Since the beings of the universe are mirrors reflecting the sacred beau-
ties of those names and the tableaux displaying their beautiful embroideries 

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF SELF-SUBSISTENT

459

and the pages setting forth their beautiful truths, those constant and eternal 
names will entirely and unceasingly renew and change the universe through 
their manifestations as a consequence of that sacred divine love and due to 
the mystery of Self-Subsistence. In this way they will display their endless 
manifestations and infinite, meaningful embroideries and books both to the 
witnessing gaze of the All-Glorious Self-Subsistent One, whom they signify, 
and to the studying gaze of uncountable numbers of intelligent creatures and 
creatures endowed with spirits, and will display countless tableaux out of a 
finite and limited thing and numerous individuals out of a single individual 
and multiple truths out of a single truth.

Fourth Ray

FOURTH RAY

The  Third  Branch  of  the  wisdom  in  the  constant  and  astonishing 
activity in the universe: Everyone who is compassionate is happy at giv-
ing pleasure to others; and everyone who is kind is gratified at making oth-
ers happy; everyone who is loving is gladdened by pleasing others who are 
worthy of being pleased; and everyone who is noble-hearted takes pleasure 
at making others happy; everyone who is just rejoices at upholding justice 
and at winning the gratitude of those whose rights are vindicated by punish-
ing the deserving; and every skilful craftsman takes pride in exhibiting his 
work, at its functioning as he hoped it would function, and at its giving the 
desired results.

Thus,  each  of  the  above-mentioned  principles  is  a  fundamental  rule 
which is in force throughout the universe and the world of mankind. Three 
examples demonstrating that these rules function in the divine names have 
been explained in the Third Stopping Place of the Thirty-Second Word. It 
is appropriate to write a summary of them at this point, so we say the fol-
lowing:

For  example,  an  extremely  kind,  generous,  munificent,  noble-hearted 
person who embarks the poor and needy on a large ship, gratifies them with 
banquets and bounties and sails it in the seas around the world, will watch 
them happily since he is superior to them, take pleasure at those needy peo-
ple’s gratitude, rejoice and be pleased at their taking pleasure, and feel proud.
If  someone  who  is  merely  a  distribution  official  takes  such  pleasure 
and  delight  at  holding  an  insignificant  banquet,  consider  the  following: 
the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One embarks all animals and men and 
countless angels, jinn and spirit beings on the ship of the earth, which is 
a vessel of that All-Merciful One; He spreads the face of the earth before 
them as a dominical table laden with varieties of foods, and with delights 

460

THE FLASHES

and sustenance for all the senses; he causes those needy, thankful, grate-
ful and happy creatures to sail the regions of the universe, and not only 
makes them happy in this world with all these bounties but also makes 
the bounties tables in the unending banquets in the Paradises of the Eter-
nal Realm. It is therefore the meaning of dominicality alluded to by the 
divine qualities resulting from the thanks, gratitude, joy and delight of 
those creatures which look to the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One, 
which we are powerless and not permitted to express, like holy pleasure, 
sacred pride, and hallowed delight that necessitate this constant activity 
and ceaseless creativity.

And for example, if a skilful craftsman builds a gramophone that requires 
no records and it plays just as he wishes, how proud and delighted he will 
be;  he  will  say  to  himself:  “ What  wonders  Allah  willed! ”  Seeing  that  an 
insignificant piece of art in which there is no true creation engenders a feel-
ing of such pride and pleasure in the craftsman’s spirit, then consider the 
following:

The All-Wise Maker creates the totality of the universe as a divine orches-
tra and wondrous workshop which strikes up and gives forth countless sorts 
of songs and hymns praises and glorification; He displays all the species, all 
the worlds, in the universe through a different craft and different miracles 
of art; and not only does He fashion many machines in the heads of animate 
creatures, each like a gramophone, camera or telegraph, He also fashions in 
the heads of human beings, both a gramophone without records, a camera 
without a film, a telegraph without wires, and a machine twenty times more 
wonderful. It is therefore meanings like sacred pride and holy pleasure and 
the exalted qualities of this sort which proceed from dominicality and arise 
from creating such machines, and their functioning in the required way and 
producing the desired results that necessitate this unceasing activity.

And  for  example,  a  just  ruler  takes  pleasure  and  is  gratified  and  feels 
proud at taking the part of the oppressed against tyrants in order to uphold 
justice, at protecting the poor against the wrongdoing of the powerful, and at 
giving to everyone his due. Since this is a fundamental rule of rulership and 
justice, consider the following:

The Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One, who is the All-Wise Ruler and 
is Absolutely Just, bestows on creatures and especially on animate ones the 
necessary conditions for life, which are known as the rights of life; and to 
preserve  their  lives,  He  grants  them  the  necessary  abilities  and  members; 
and  He  compassionately  protects  the  weak  from  the  evil  of  the  powerful. 

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF SELF-SUBSISTENT

461

Therefore, the dominical qualities and sacred meanings, which we are pow-
erless to express, that arise from this and from the execution of the mystery 
of justice, which in this world is total with regard to establishing justice for 
all  animate  beings  and  partial  with  regard  to  punishing  wrongdoers,  and 
especially that arise from the manifestation of supreme justice at the supreme 
tribunal of the resurrection, necessitate the constant activity in the universe.
Thus,  as  these  three  examples  show,  since  each  of  the  most  beautiful 
names give rise to certain sacred divine qualities in this unceasing activity, 
they require unceasing creativity. And since the development, unfolding and 
blossoming of abilities and faculties yield a joy, expansiveness and pleas-
ure; and since on the performance and completion of a duty and on being 
released from it, everyone entrusted with such a duty experiences a feeling 
of relief and gratitude; and since to receive many fruits from a single seed 
and to gain a hundredfold profit from a single thing is a most pleasurable 
trade, then most certainly the One who causes the innumerable abilities of 
creatures  to  unfold,  after  employing  the  creatures  in  valuable  duties,  will 
discharge them, but to a higher state. That is to say, He raises elements to 
the level of minerals; minerals to plant life; plants to the level of animal life 
by means of sustenance; and animals to the high level of human life, which 
is conscious.

It may be understood then just how important are the sacred meanings 
and divine dominicality arising from the constant activity and dominical cre-
ativity which, on the demise of their external existences, cause all animate 
creatures  to  leave  behind  them  multiple  existences  taken  from  them,  like 
their spirits, essences, identities, forms, existences in the Worlds of Simili-
tudes,  Knowledge,  and  the  Unseen,  the  sheaths  of  their  spirits,  and  astral 
bodies, all of which are charged with duties in their places. This is explained 
in the Twenty-Fourth Letter.

A Decisive Answer to an Important Question
One group of the people of misguidance says that the being who changes 
and transforms the universe with this constant activity must himself be sub-
ject to change and alteration.

T h e   A n s w e r :  Allah forbid! A hundred thousand times, Allah forbid! The 
fact that mirrors on the ground change demonstrates not that the sun in the 
sky changes, but on the contrary that its manifestations are being renewed. 
Moreover, change and alteration are impossible in the Most Pure and Holy 
Essence,  who  is  pre-eternal,  post-eternal,  sempiternal,  in  every  respect 

462

THE FLASHES

absolutely  perfect  and  absolutely  self-sufficient,  totally  free  of,  detached 
from, and beyond matter, space, restriction, and contingency. Change in the 
universe points to his lack of change and alteration, not to His changing. For 
one who causes constant change and causes numerous things to move must 
himself be unchanging and not move.

For example, if you spin a large number of globes and balls which have 
each been tied to a piece of string and cause them all to move unceasingly 
within an order, you have to remain in one place and not change or move, 
for if you did, it would spoil the order. It is clear that one who causes objects 
to move within an order must himself not move, and one who causes objects 
to change ceaselessly must himself be unchanging so that these actions may 
continue in an orderly fashion.

Secondly:  Change  and  alteration  arise  from  createdness,  from  being 
renewed in order to be perfected, from need, materiality, and contingency. 
Since the Most Pure and Holy Essence is both eternal, and in every respect 
absolutely perfect and absolutely self-sufficient, and totally detached from 
matter, and necessarily existent, most certainly His changing and altering is 
not possible; it is impossible.

First  Matter

If we wish to see the greatest manifestation of the name of Self-Subsist-
ent, we shall set up two telescopes in order to observe the whole universe 
with our imaginations. One of them will show the most distant objects, the 
other minute particles. So if we look through the first telescope, we see that 
through the manifestation of the name of Self-Subsistent and without sup-
port, of millions of globes and stars thousands of times larger than the earth, 
some have been made apparently stationary in the matter known as ether, 
which is subtler than air, while others have been made to travel apparently 
as their duty.

Then we look through the second telescope, which is the microscope of 
the imagination, to observe minute particles. Through the mystery of Self-
Subsistence, taking up orderly positions like the stars, the particles of the 
bodies of animate creatures on the earth are all in motion and performing 
their duties. We see that especially the miniscule agglomerations forming 
the particles known as red corpuscles and white corpuscles in the blood of 
animate beings, like the planets, move with two orderly motions like Mev-
levi dervishes.

A Summary

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF SELF-SUBSISTENT

463

A Summary 1

A summary is appropriate here in order to examine the sacred light the 
six names of the greatest name form, blending together like the seven col-
ours in light. It is as follows:

Look beyond the greatest manifestation of the name of Self-Subsistent 
which thus upholds and gives permanence and continuity to all the beings 
in the universe: the greatest manifestation of the name of Ever-Living has 
set aflame all animate beings with its manifestation. It has illuminated the 
universe. It gilds all animate beings with its manifestation.

Now  look  again:  beyond  the  name  of  Ever-Living,  the  greatest  mani-
festation of the name of Single confers a unity on the universe with all its 
elements  and  parts.  It  puts  a  stamp  of  unity  on  each  being’s  forehead.  It 
places a seal of oneness on each being’s face. It causes them to proclaim its 
manifestation with endless, countless tongues.

Now consider the greatest manifestation of the name of Sapient beyond 
the name of Single: it incorporates in a fruitful order, wise regularity and 
purposeful harmony appropriate to each all the beings we observe through 
the two telescopes of the imagination, from stars to particles, whether uni-
versal or particular, from the greatest sphere to the most minute. It adorns 
and gilds all beings.

Then  look  beyond  the  greatest  manifestation  of  the  name  of  Sapient: 
in regard to its aspect that was examined in the Second Point, through the 
greatest  manifestation  of  the  name  of  All-Just,  the  universe  with  all  its 
beings is administered with such balance, equilibrium and measure within 
unceasing activity, that if just one of the heavenly bodies were to lose its 
balance even for a second, that is, if it were to break free of the manifesta-
tion of the name of All-Just, it would cause chaos among the stars; it would 
be like Doomsday.

Thus, all beings and all the different realms of beings from the army of 
the stars to the army of minute particles, that is, from the largest sphere that 
is the vast belt known as the Milky Way to the sphere of the motion of red 
and white corpuscles, stand shoulder to shoulder in a manner gauged with 
the finest balance and measure, so demonstrating that all those beings are 
obedient and totally subjugated to the commands proceeding from the com-
mand of ² ±

1.  This is a brief summary of the six sacred names which bear the greatest name and 

are the basis and subject of the six main sections of the Thirtieth Flash.

464

THE FLASHES

Now look beyond the greatest manifestation of the Name of All-Just to 
the greatest manifestation of the name of Most Holy, which was explained 
in the First Point: the fact that it renders all the beings in the universe so 
pure,  clean,  clear,  beautiful,  adorned  and  shining  demonstrates  that  it  has 
bestowed  on  the  universe  and  on  all  beings  the  form  of  beautiful  mirrors 
worthy of reflecting the utter essential beauty of the Absolutely Beautiful 
One and the sheer loveliness of His most beautiful names.

I n  

 S h o r t :  These  six  names  and  six  lights  of  the  greatest  name  have 
enwrapped  the  universe  and  all  beings  in  ever-differing,  multifarious  col-
ours, embroideries and adornment.

Second Matter

Second Matter of  the Fifth Ray

Just as the manifestation of Self-Subsistence in the universe is at the level 
of unity and glory, so in man, who is the centre, pivot, and conscious fruit 
of the universe, it is at the level of oneness and beauty. That is to say, just 
as the universe subsists through the mystery of Self-Subsistence, so it in one 
respect subsists through man, who is the most complete place of manifesta-
tion  of  the  name  of  Self-Subsistent.  For  since  most  of  the  wisdom,  aims, 
purposes, and benefits in the universe look to man, the manifestation of Self-
Subsistence in him is as though a support for the universe. It may be said that 
the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One willed man to be in the universe 
and created it for him. For with the comprehensiveness of his nature, man 
can understand and take pleasure in all the divine names. He can understand 
many of names through the pleasure to be found in sustenance in particular. 
Whereas the angels cannot know them through that pleasure.

Because of this important comprehensiveness, the Ever-Living and Self-
Subsistent One has given man a stomach and appetite with which He allows 
him to understand all His names and to taste all the varieties of His bounty, 
and  He  has  generously  laden  the  table  with  endless  varieties  of  foods  for 
man’s stomach. He has also made life a stomach, like the physical one, and 
has spread an extensive table of bounties before the senses, which are like 
the hands of the stomach of life. With its senses, life offers a sort of thanks 
for all the ways it benefits from the table of bounties.

After  the  stomach  of  life,  He  has  bestowed  on  man  the  stomach  of 
humanity,  which  requires  sustenance  and  bounties  in  a  wider  sphere  than 
life. Intelligence, mind, and imagination, the hands of this stomach, benefit 
from the table of mercy, which is as broad as the heavens and the earth, and 
give thanks.

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF SELF-SUBSISTENT

465

After the stomach of humanity, He has spread before man another table 
of bounties which is infinitely vast. He has made the beliefs of Islam like 
an  immaterial  stomach  requiring  extensive  sustenance  and  has  extended 
its  table  outside  the  sphere  of  contingency  and  included  in  it  the  divine 
names. With this stomach and the great pleasure of sustenance, man per-
ceives the names of All-Merciful and All-Wise and exclaims: “ All praise 
be to Allah for His mercifulness and His wisdom! ” And so on. Man is able 
to benefit from limitless divine bounties with this vast immaterial stom-
ach. And there is a further sphere in this stomach, which is the pleasure of 
divine love.

Thus, the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One has made man a centre 
and pivot of the whole universe; He has spread before him a table of boun-
ties as broad as the universe, and subjugated the universe to him. The reasons 
for this and for the universe in one respect subsisting through the mystery of 
Self-Subsistence manifested through man are man’s three important duties:

His First Duty

His Second Duty

His First Duty
All  the  varieties  of  bounties  dispersed  throughout  the  universe  are  put 
into order through man. All those things beneficial to man are strung like 
prayer-beads  on  a  string  and  the  ends  of  the  strings  of  those  bounties  are 
tied to man’s head. Man is thus made a list of all the various contents of the 
treasuries of mercy.
His Second Duty
By reason of his comprehensiveness, this is for man to be the most per-
fect addressee of the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One; by appreciating 
and admiring His astonishing arts, to be His loudest herald; and by offering 
every kind of conscious thanks, to give praise, glory, and thanks for all the 
varieties of His bounties and the limitless different sorts of His gifts.

His Third Duty

His Third Duty
Through his life, this is to act in three respects as a mirror to the Ever-Liv-
ing and Self-Subsistent One and His qualities and all-embracing attributes.

F i r s t   A s p e c t :  This is to perceive through his own absolute impotence 
the absolute power of his Creator and its levels, and through the degrees 
of  his  impotence,  the  degrees  of  His  power.  It  is  to  understand  through 
his own absolute poverty, His mercy and the degrees of His mercy, and 
through  his  weakness,  His  strength;  and  so  on.  It  is  to  be  a  mirror  and 
measuring instrument for his Creator’s attributes of perfection through his 
own defective attributes. Just as darkness is a perfect mirror for displaying 

466

THE FLASHES

electric light, the brilliance of the light being proportionate to the darkness 
of the night, so man acts as a mirror to the divine perfections through his 
own defective attributes.

S e c o n d   A s p e c t :  Using the universe as a yardstick and with his own par-
tial  will,  tiny  knowledge,  minute  power,  and  apparent  ownership,  and  by 
building his own house, man understands and acts as a mirror to the owner-
ship, art, will, power, and knowledge of the universe’s Fashioner.

T h i r d   A s p e c t :  Man’s acting as a mirror in this respect has two faces:
First: It is to display in himself the ever-differing embroideries of the 
divine names. To put it simply, by reason of his comprehensiveness, man is 
like a tiny index and miniature specimen of the universe and so displays the 
embroideries of all the names.

Second Face: This face acts as a mirror to the divine attributes. That is 
to say, just as man points to the life of the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent 
One through his own life, so he acts as a mirror to and makes known such 
attributes of the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One as hearing and sight, 
by means of his own sense of hearing and sense of sight that develop during 
his lifetime.

Furthermore, man acts as a mirror to the sacred attributes of the Ever-
Living and Self-Subsistent One through the very numerous and responsive 
senses, meanings, and emotions that are present with his life, which do not 
develop but which boil up in the form of feelings and emotions. For exam-
ple, as a result of such emotions, through meanings like loving and feeling 
proud, pleased, happy and cheerful he acts as a mirror to attributes of that 
sort, on condition they are suitable and worthy for the sacredness and abso-
lute self-sufficiency of the Most Pure and Holy Essence.

Also, through his comprehensive life, man is an instrument that recog-
nizes and measures the attributes and qualities of the All-Glorious One, and 
is an index of the manifestation of His names, and a conscious mirror, and so 
on, he acts as a mirror to the Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One in many 
respects. Man is also a unit of measurement, an index, a scale, and a balance 
to the truths of the universe. 

For example, extremely decisive evidence for the existence of the Pre-
served Tablet in the universe and an example of it is man’s faculty of mem-
ory. And a decisive evidence of the existence of the World of Similitudes 
and an example of it is man’s faculty of imagination. And evidence for the 
existence  of  spirit  beings  in  the  universe  and  an  example  of  them  are  the 

THE THIRTIETH FLASH – THE DIVINE NAME OF SELF-SUBSISTENT

467

powers and subtle faculties in man. 1 And so on. In small measure man may 
display almost visibly the truths of belief present in the universe.

Man performs many important functions like those mentioned above. He 
is a mirror to enduring beauty. He is the place of manifestation announc-
ing sempiternal perfection. He is one needy and thankful for eternal mercy. 
Since beauty, perfection, and mercy are everlasting and eternal, it is surely 
necessary and inevitable that man, who is the desirous mirror to enduring 
beauty,  the  enraptured  herald  of  everlasting  perfection,  and  thankful  and 
needy  for  eternal  mercy,  will  go  to  an  everlasting  realm  to  remain  there 
permanently, that he will go to eternity to accompany those eternal qualities, 
and will accompany that eternal Beauty, everlasting Perfection, and ever-
enduring Mercy for all eternity.

For an eternal beauty cannot be content with an impermanent admirer, a 
mortal lover. Since beauty loves itself, it desires love in return for its love. 
Transience and impermanence transform such love into enmity. If man was 
not  going  to  go  to  eternity  and  remain  there  permanently,  he  would  feel 
enmity rather than innate love for eternal beauty.

As is described in a footnote in the Tenth Word, one time a celebrated 
beauty expelled a lover from her presence, whereupon his love turned into 
enmity and in order to console himself, he said: “ Ugh! How ugly she is! ”, 
thus insulting and denying her beauty.

Indeed, man is hostile to what is unfamiliar to him, just as he quite sim-
ply wishes to be hostile to and find fault in things he cannot obtain or pos-
sess.  Since,  as  the  whole  universe  testifies,  the  True  Beloved  and  Abso-
lutely Beautiful One causes man to love Himself through His most beautiful 
names, which are altogether exquisite, and desires man to love Him, then 
most certainly He would not endow man who is both His beloved and His 
lover with an innate enmity and cause him to be vexed with Himself from 
afar; He would not endow man’s spirit with a hidden enmity, which would 
be altogether contrary to man’s nature, who is by his nature the most lovable 
and loving creature and the most exceptional that He has created for wor-
ship. For man would only be able to cure the deep wounds caused by eternal 

1.   The  elements  in  man  point  to  the  elements  in  the  universe,  and  his  bones  to  its 
stones and rocks, his hair to its plants and trees, and the blood which flows in his body 
and the fluids which issue from his eyes, ears, nose and mouth to the spring and mineral 
waters of the earth. Similarly, man’s spirit points to the spirit world, his faculty of memory 
to the Preserved Tablet, and his power of imagination to the World of Similitudes, and so 
on. Each of his members and faculties points to a different world and bears decisive wit-
ness to their existence.

THE FLASHES

separation from an Absolute Beauty that he loves and whose value he appre-
ciates by enmity towards it, being vexed with it, and denying it.

It is from this point that the unbelievers’ enmity towards Allah Almighty 
arises. In which case, the Pre-Eternal Beauty will surely make manifest in 
man a perpetual life in a permanent realm in order to be present together with 
him who is an enraptured mirror to Himself on the journey to post-eternity.
Since man has been created in such a way that by his very nature he longs 
for and loves an Ever-Enduring Beauty; and since an Ever-Enduring Beauty 
cannot  be  content  with  an  impermanent  lover;  and  since,  in  order  to  find 
consolation from the pain and sorrow arising from some aim that he does 
not know or cannot attain or possess, man pacifies himself through discov-
ering the faults of such an aim, rather, through nurturing a hidden enmity 
towards it; and since the universe was created for man, and man was created 
to know and love Allah; and since the Creator of the universe, together with 
His names, is eternal; and since the manifestation of His names will be per-
petual, everlasting, and post-eternal; then man will most certainly go to an 
everlasting realm and will manifest an everlasting life.

Furthermore  Muhammad  the  Arabian  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace ), who is the supreme guide and perfect man, made known and dem-
onstrated most perfectly in himself and in his religion the value and all the 
perfections and duties we have explained above concerning man. This dem-
onstrates that the universe was created for mankind and its aim and object is 
mankind. So too the aim and object of mankind, and its choicest and most 
valuable member, and its most brilliant mirror to the Single and Eternally 
Besought One is Ahmad Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ).
