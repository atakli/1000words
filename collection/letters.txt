THE FIRST LETTER: The answers to four questions: .......................... 19
The First answers a question about Khidr’s life, and in connection 

with it explains the ﬁve levels of life ............................................... 19

The  Second  explains  how,  in  accordance  with  Qur’anic  verses, 

death is created and a bounty, like life. ........................................... 21

The Third describes where Hell is situated. It explains the wisdom 
in the creation of the Greater Hell, and how in majestic fash-
ion,  manifesting  divine  favour  and  wrath,  Heaven  and  Hell 
are the two fruits of the tree of the universe and will be ﬁlled 
with the produce of this world ......................................................... 23

The Fourth shows that like passing love for persons may be trans-
formed into true love, so through belief in Allah, passing love 
of  this  world  may  be  transformed  into  true  love,  which  is 
acceptable ........................................................................................ 25

THE  SECOND  LETTER:  Six  reasons  why,  in  accordance  with 
Qur’anic  verses,  those  working  for  the  cause  of  religion 
should practice self-sufﬁciency, and if there is no compelling 
reason to do so, not accept alms and gifts ....................................... 28

THE  THIRD  LETTER:  A  description  of  two  verses  which  in 
miraculous  fashion  allude  to  the  face  of  the  heavens  and 
orderly motion of the heavenly bodies. It explains too ﬁrstly, 
how the wicked will travel to Hell, and secondly, the inﬁnite 
ease in unity and inﬁnite difﬁculty in multiplicity. ......................... 31

THE  FOURTH  LETTER  makes  two  points  about  the  R i s a l e - i  
N u r  and its way: firstly, that it manifests the meaning of the 
verse, Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ »  and  secondly, 
about the way of impotence. Finally is a piece “ resembling 
poetry ” on the Utterance of the Stars. ............................................. 35

THE FIFTH LETTER: In the face of the tendency to attach too 
much importance to Sufism at the expense of spreading the 
truths of belief, this letter describes the three sorts of saint-
hood, and how the unfolding of the truths of belief is the chief

aim of the Sufi ways, but is also possible through the R i s a l e - i  
N u r , though in a shorter time. .......................................................... 38

THE SIXTH LETTER explains the meaning of two verses about 
reliance on Allah and describes a light and consolation pro-
ceeding from them and from belief that dispelled the darkness 
of ﬁve degrees of exile. .................................................................... 40

THE  SEVENTH  LETTER:  A  decisive  answer  to  atheists  who 
seek  to  criticize  the  Prophet  Muhammad’s  ( UWBP )  num-
ber  of  wives  and  his  marriage  with  Zaynab  in  particular.  It 
also  explains  some  important  instances  of  wisdom  in  his 
marriages. ........................................................................................ 43

THE EIGHTH LETTER: In explanation of the verse, 

3 2 1 0 / . -  this shows that what the Prop-
het Jacob ( UWP ) felt for Joseph ( UWP ), was not love of a 
passionate  kind,  but  compassion  –  compassion  being  more 
elevated  and  pure,  and  the  means  of  attaining  to  the  divine 
names Merciful and Compassionate. ............................................... 46

THE  NINTH  LETTER:  A  discussion  about  wonderworking, 
divine bestowal, and divine favour. Secondly is an explana-
tion of how such intense emotions as curiosity, love, greed, 
ambition, and stubbornness are of two sorts, worldly and real. 
Thirdly is a discussion about the differences between Islam 
and belief or faith. ............................................................................ 48

THE TENTH LETTER consists of the answers to two questions. 
The ﬁrst explains the realities of the Clear Book and the Clear 
Record, mentioned in several places in the Qur’an. The sec-
ond is a convincing explanation of where the Great Gathering 
and Last Judgement will take place. ................................................ 52

THE ELEVENTH LETTER consists of four topics. Expounding 
the  verse, V U T S R  the  first  is  a  cure  for  those 
who  suffer  from  scruples.  The  second  is  included  not  here 
but  in  the  Seventeenth  Word.  The  third  and  fourth  are  two 
examples demonstrating the impotence of modern civilization 
before the Qur’an. The examples show how the Qur’anic dec-
rees  on  women’s  inheritance  are  both  pure  justice  and  pure 
compassion. ..................................................................................... 55

THE  TWELFTH  LETTER:  The  brief  replies  to  three  questions 
disputed  over  by  people  with  a  modern  educational  back-
ground: ............................................................................................. 58

on even the innocent and animals is not contrary to justice. ........... 61

THE THIRTEENTH LETTER: The reply to frequent questions 
as to how Bediuzzaman endured the oppression inﬂicted on 
him by the politicians and ‘the worldly.’ It shows how the ill-
treatment was transformed into various sorts of mercy. It also

papers, and for his indifference towards politics. ............................ 63

THE FIFTEENTH LETTER: Six important answers to six impor-

tant questions: ..................................................................................

T h e   F i r s t :  The answer in two stations concerning the Companions

grieved by the events of the Last Day? ............................................ 77

drawn  from  the  world  and  politics;  also  written  to  preserve 
the dignity of learning. ..................................................................... 92

THE SEVENTEENTH LETTER: A letter of condolence on the 
death of a child. Although short and addressed to a close stu-
dent of Bediuzzaman, it is of considerable interest. It estab-
lishes that, as the Qur’an teaches, children who die before the 
age  of  puberty  remain  as  children  in  the  everlasting  realm, 
and are returned to the embrace of their parents. ............................ 97

THE EIGHTEENTH LETTER consists of three important matters: ....
The First explains and illustrates by means of a comparison how

to  them  through  illumination  in  other  worlds  and  levels  of 
existence appear contrary to reality in this Manifest World. ........... 101

The Second: A clear explanation of the way of the Unity of Exis-
tence, which has been the cause of confusion and controversy. 
It  proves  that  the  way  of  the  Companions  of  the  Prophet 
( UWBP ) and the veracious, the people of sobriety, is sounder 
and more elevated and acceptable. .................................................. 103
An Addendum to the Second Matter ..................................................... 106
The  Third:  A  brief  indication  solving  one  of  the  three  main  rid-
dles  of  creation.  These  have  been  solved  completely  in  the

Twenty-Fourth Letter. ..................................................................... 110

T h e   A n s w e r :   He  is  alive,  but  there  are  ﬁve  levels  of  life.  He  is  at  the 
second. It is because of this that some religious scholars have been doubtful 
about it.

The First Level of Life is that of our life, which is very restricted.
The Second Level of Life is that of Khidr and Ilyas ( May Allah grant 
them peace ), which is free to an extent; that is to say, they can be present in 

1.  Bediuzzaman explained as follows his reasons for heading his letters with this verse 
( 17:44 ) : “ This was the ﬁrst door opened to me from the sacred treasuries of the All-Wise 
Qur’an. Of the divine truths of the Qur’an, it was the truth of this verse that ﬁrst became 
clear to me and it is this truth that pervades most parts of the Risale-i Nur. Another reason 
is that the masters in whom I have conﬁdence used it at the head of their letters. ” ( See, 
B a r l a   L a h i k a s ı , 335. ) ( Tr. )

numerous places at the same time. They are not permanently restricted by 
the requirements of humanity like we are. They can eat and drink like us 
when they want to, but are not compelled to like we are. Saints who attain to 
direct vision and knowledge of reality have reported virtually unanimously 
their adventures with Khidr and these elucidate and prove this level of life. 
One of the degrees of sainthood, even, is called the degree of Khidr. A saint 
who reaches it receives instruction from Khidr and meets with him. But it 
sometimes  happens  that  such  a  person  is  mistakenly  thought  to  be  Khidr 
himself.

The  Third  Level  of  Life  is  that  of  Idris  and  Jesus  ( May  Allah  grant 
them  peace ),  which  is  removed  from  the  requirements  of  humanity,  and 
is an angelic level of life and acquires a luminous ﬁneness. Quite simply, 
Idris and Jesus are present in the heavens with their earthly bodies, which 
have the subtlety of bodies from the World of Similitudes and the luminos-
ity  of  astral  bodies.  There  is  a  Hadith  that  states  that  at  the  end  of  time, 
Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ) will come and will act in accordance with the 
Shari‘a of Muhammad ( UWBP ).1 This indicates that at the end times the 
religion of Christianity will be puriﬁed and divest itself of superstition in the 
face of the current of unbelief and atheism born of naturalist philosophy, and 
will be transformed into Islam. At that point, on the one hand the collective 
personality  of  Christianity  will  kill  the  fearsome  collective  personality  of 
irreligion with the sword of heavenly revelation; and on the other, represent-
ing the collective personality of Christianity, Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ) 
will kill the Dajjal, who represents the collective personality of irreligion; 
that is, he will kill atheistic thought.

The  Fourth  Level  of  Life  is  that  of  the  martyrs.  According  to  the 
Qur’an, the martyrs are at a level of life higher than that of the other dead 
in their graves. Since they sacriﬁced their worldly lives in the way of truth, 
in  His  perfect  muniﬁcence  Almighty  Allah  bestows  on  them  in  the  Inter-
mediate  Realm  a  life  resembling  earthly  life,  but  without  its  sorrows  and 
hardships. They do not know themselves to be dead and suppose only that 
they  have  gone  to  a  better  world.  Enjoying  themselves  in  perfect  happi-
ness, they do not suffer the pains of separation that accompany death. 2 For 
sure the spirits of the dead are immortal, but they know they are dead. The 
happiness and pleasure they experience in the Intermediate World are not 
equal  to  the  martyrs’  happiness.  Like  if  two  men  in  their  dreams  enter  a 
beautiful palace resembling Paradise: one knows that he is dreaming and the

FIRST LETTER

pleasure and enjoyment he receives are deﬁcient. He thinks: “ If I wake up, 
all this enjoyment will disappear. ” While the other man is unaware that he 
is dreaming, and he experiences true pleasure and delight.

Thus, the martyrs partake of life in the Intermediate Realm differently 
to the other dead. It has been deﬁnitely established by innumerable inci-
dents  and  narrations  that  they  manifest  life  in  the  way  described  above 
and  suppose  themselves  to  be  alive.  Indeed,  their  level  of  life  has  been 
illuminated  and  proved  on  numerous  occasions  by  such  occurrences  as 
Hamza ( May Allah be pleased with him ) – the lord of the martyrs – pro-
tecting those who have recourse to him, and his performing and making 
performed tasks in this world. I myself, even, had a nephew and student 
called  Ubeyd.  He  was  killed  at  my  side  and  in  my  place  and  became  a 
martyr. Then, when I was being held as a prisoner-of-war at a place three 
months’  distance  away,  I  entered  his  grave  in  a  true  dream,  which  was 
a sort of dwelling-place under the earth, although I did not know where 
he  was  buried.  I  saw  him  living  the  martyrs’  level  of  life.  He  evidently 
thought that I was dead and said that he had grieved over me greatly. He 
thought he was alive, but having retreated before the Russian invasion, had 
made himself a good home under the ground. Thus, owing to such indica-
tions,  my  unimportant  dream  convinced  me  about  the  above-mentioned 
truth as certainly as having witnessed it.

The Fifth Level of Life is that of the spirits of the dead in their graves. 
Yes, death is a change of residence, the liberation of the spirit, a discharge 
from duties; it is not annihilation, non-existence, and a going to nothingness. 
Many  evidences  illuminate  and  prove  this  level  of  life,  such  as  the  innu-
merable occasions the spirits of saints have assumed forms and appeared to 
those who unveil the realities, and the other dead have communicated with 
us while awake or sleeping and have told us of things that are conformable 
with reality. In fact, the Twenty-Ninth Word, which is about the immortality 
of man’s spirit, demonstrates this level of life with incontrovertible proofs.

SECOND QUESTION

( 67:2 ) 3 2 1 0 / . - , + 
Verses like this in the All-Wise Qur’an, the Criterion of Truth and False-
hood, make it understood that death is created like life; it too is a bounty. But 
on the face of it, death is dissolution, non-existence, decay, the extinction 
of life, the annihilator of pleasures; so how can it be created and a bounty?

22

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

T h e   A n s w e r :  As was stated at the end of the answer to the ﬁrst question, 
death is a discharge from the duties of life; it is a rest, a change of residence, 
a transformation of existence; it is an invitation to eternal life, a beginning, 
the introduction to an immortal life. Just as life comes into the world through 
an act of creation and is appointed and determined, so departure from the 
world is created and determined, and is planned wisely and purposively. The 
ways plants die, plant life being the simplest level of life, show their death 
to be a more orderly work of art than life. For although the death of fruits, 
seeds, and grains appears to occur through their decay and dissolution, it is 
in fact a sort of kneading that comprises exceedingly well-ordered chemi-
cal reactions and a balanced combining of elements and wise formation of 
particles; their unseen, orderly and wise deaths appear through the life of the 
new shoots. That is to say, the death of the seed is the onset of the shoot’s 
life. Indeed, since its death is like life itself, it is created and regular the same 
as life is.

Moreover, the death of living fruits or animals in the human stomach is 
the beginning of their rising to the level of human life; it may therefore be 
said that being thus, their death is more orderly and created than is their life.
If  the  death  of  plant  life,  the  lowest  level  of  life,  is  created,  wise,  and 
ordered in that way, the death that befalls human life, the highest level of 
life, must be the same. Similarly, as a seed sown in the ground becomes a 
tree in the world of the air, so a man who is laid in the earth will surely pro-
duce the shoots of an everlasting life in the Intermediate Realm.

Now for the aspects of death that are bounties; we shall point out four of 

them.

The First: Death is a great bounty because it means one is freed from the 
duties and obligations of life, which become burdensome. It is also a door 
through which one passes in order to join and be united with one’s friends, 
ninety-nine out of a hundred of whom are already in the Intermediate Realm.
The  Second:  It  is  to  be  released  from  the  narrow,  irksome,  turbulent 
prison of this world, and to receive an expansive, joyful, troublefree immor-
tal life, and to enter the sphere of the Eternally Beloved One’s mercy.

The  Third:  There  are  numerous  factors  like  old  age  which  make 
life arduous and show death to be a far superior bounty. For example, if 
together with your very elderly parents who cause you much distress you 
beheld before you your grandfather’s grandfathers in all their pitiful state, 
you would understand what a calamity life is, and what a bounty, death. 

FIRST LETTER

23

Another example: one can imagine how difﬁcult life is in the harsh condi-
tions  of  winter  for  the  beautiful  ﬂying  insects,  the  lovers  of  the  beautiful 
ﬂowers, and what a mercy death is for them. 

The Fourth: Just as sleep is a comfort, a mercy, a rest, particularly for 
those  afﬂicted  by  disaster  and  the  wounded  and  the  sick,  so  too  is  death, 
the elder brother of sleep, a pure bounty and mercy for the disaster-struck 
and  those  who  suffer  tribulations  that  drive  them  to  suicide.  However,  as 
is proved decisively in many of the Wo r d s , for the people of misguidance, 
death is pure torment the same as life, and pure afﬂiction, but that is outside 
the discussion here.

THIRD QUESTION
Where is Hell?
The Answer:

ّ(cid:195)ا  َ

ّ(cid:202)ِا  َبْ(cid:193)َ(cid:155)ْ(cid:170)ا ُمَ(cid:171)ْ(cid:151)َ(cid:192) َ(cid:202)  ( 67:26 ) ë ê é è ç 
According to some narrations, Hell is beneath the earth.  1 As we have 
explained in other places, in its annual orbit the globe traces a circle around 
an area that in the future will accommodate the Great Gathering and Last 
Judgement. It means that Hell is beneath the area of its orbit. It is invisible 
and  imperceptible  because  it  consists  of  veiled,  lightless  ﬁre.  Within  the 
vast stretch of space travelled by the earth many creatures are found that are 
invisible because they are without light. Just as the moon loses its existence 
when its light recedes, so we are unable to see numerous lightless globes and 
creatures, although they are before our eyes.

There are two Hells, the Lesser and the Greater. In the future, the Lesser 
will be transformed into the Greater and is like its seed; in the future it will 
become one of its habitations. The Lesser Hell is under the earth, that is, at 
the earth’s centre. It is the inside and centre of the globe. Geology informs 
us  that  in  digging  downwards,  the  heat  for  the  most  part  increases  one 
degree every thirty-three metres. That means that since half the diameter 
of the earth is around six thousand kilometres, the ﬁre at the centre is at a 
temperature of around two hundred thousand degrees, that is, two hundred 
times hotter than ﬁre at the circumference; this is in agreement with what 
is stated in Hadiths. 2 The Lesser Hell performs many of the Greater Hell’s 
functions  in  this  world  and  Intermediate  Realm,  and  this  is  indicated  in 

1.  al-Ajlūnī, K a s h f   a l - K h a f ā ’ , i, 281; al-Ḥākim, a l - M u s t a d r a k , iv, 568.

Hadiths. Just as in the world of the hereafter, the earth will pour its inhabit-
ants into the arena of the resurrection within its annual orbit; so at the divine 
command it will hand over the Lesser Hell within it to the Greater Hell. 

Some of the Mu‘tazilite authorities said that Hell will be created later, 
but such an idea is mistaken and foolish, and arises from Hell not having 
completely opened up at the present time and developed into a form entirely 
appropriate  for  its  inhabitants.  In  order  to  see  with  our  worldly  eyes  the 
dwelling places of the next world within the veil of the Unseen and to dem-
onstrate their existence, either the universe has to be shrunk to the size of 
two provinces, or our eyes have to be enlarged to the size of stars, so that we 
can see and specify their places. Allah knows best, the dwelling-places of 
the hereafter are not visible to our worldly eyes, but as indicated by certain 
narrations, the Hell of the hereafter is connected with our world. A Hadith 
says about the intense heat of summer:  َمَ
ّ(cid:179)َ(cid:183)َ(cid:106)  ِحْ(cid:193)َ(cid:158)  ْنـِ(cid:174)  1 That is to say, the 
Greater Hell is not visible to the tiny, dim eyes of this world’s minds. How-
ever, we may look with the light of the divine name All-Wise, as follows:

The Greater Hell beneath the earth’s annual orbit has as though made the 
Lesser Hell at the earth’s centre its deputy and made it perform some of its 
functions. The possessions of the All-Powerful One of Glory are truly exten-
sive; He situated the Greater Hell wherever divine wisdom required. Yes, 
the All-Powerful One of Glory, the All-Wise One of Perfection, who issues 
the command of ( 36:82 ) ² ± has tied the moon to the earth before our 
very eyes with perfect wisdom and order, and with vast power and perfect 
order tied the earth to the sun, and has made the sun travel together with 
its planets at a speed close to that of the annual rotation of the earth, and 
with His majestic dominicality, according to one possibility, made it travel 
towards the sun of suns, and like a ﬂeet decked out with electric lights has 
made the stars luminous witnesses to His sovereign dominicality. It is not far 
from the perfect wisdom, tremendous power, and sovereign dominicality of 
one thus All-Glorious to make the Greater Hell like the boiler of an electric-
light factory and with it set ﬁre to the stars of the heavens that look to the 
hereafter, and give them heat and power. That is, give light to the stars from

Paradise, the world of light, and send them ﬁre and heat from Hell, and at 
the same time, make part of that Hell a habitation and place of imprisonment 
for those who are to be tormented. Furthermore, He is an All-Wise Creator 
who conceals a tree as large as a mountain in a seed the size of a ﬁnger-nail. 
It is surely not far then from the power and wisdom of such an All-Glorious 
One to conceal the Greater Hell in the seed of the Lesser Hell in the heart of 
the globe of the earth.

In Short: Paradise and Hell are the two fruits of a branch of the tree of 
creation,  which  stretches  out  towards  eternity.  The  fruits’  place  is  at  the 
branch’s tip. And they are the two results of the chain of the universe; and 
the places of the results are the two sides of the chain. The base and heavy 
are on its lower side, the luminous and elevated on its upper side. They are 
also the two stores of the ﬂood of events and the immaterial produce of the 
earth. The store-places vary according to the produce, the bad beneath, the 
good above. They are also the two pools of the ﬂood of beings, which ﬂows 
in waves towards eternity. As for the pool’s place, it is where the ﬂood stops 
and gathers. That is, the obscene and ﬁlthy below, the good and the pure 
above. They are also the two places of manifestation, the one of beneﬁcence 
and  mercy,  the  other  of  wrath  and  grandeur.  Places  of  manifestation  may 
be anywhere; the All-Merciful One of Beauty, the All-Compelling One of 
Glory, situates His places of manifestation where He wishes.

As for the existence of Paradise and Hell, they have been proved con-
clusively in the Tenth, Twenty-Eighth, and Twenty-Ninth Wo r d s . Here, we 
only say this: the existence of the fruit is as deﬁnite and certain as the exist-
ence of the branch; the result is as deﬁnite as the chain; the store as the pro-
duce; the pool as the river; and the places of manifestation are as deﬁnite and 
certain as the existence of mercy and wrath.

FOURTH QUESTION

Passing ( m e c a z î  ) love for things can be transformed into true love, so 
can the passing love most people have for this world also be transformed 
into true love?

T h e  A n s w e r :  Yes, if a person who loves with passing love the transitory 
face of the world sees the ugliness of the decline and transience on that 
face and turns away from it; if he searches for an immortal beloved and is 
successful in seeing the world’s other two, beautiful, faces, of being a mir-
ror to the divine names and the tillage of the hereafter, his illicit passing 
love then starts to be transformed into true love. But on the one condition 
that he does not confuse with the outside world his inner ﬂeeting, unstable 

26

world, which is bound to his life. If like the people of misguidance and heed-
lessness he forgets himself, plunges into the outside world, and supposing 
the general world to be his private world comes to love it, he will fall into the 
swamp of nature and drown. Unless, extraordinarily, a hand of favour saves 
him. Consider the following comparison which will illuminate this truth. 

For example, if on the four walls of this ﬁnely decorated room are four 
full-length  mirrors  belonging  to  the  four  of  us,  then  there  would  be  ﬁve 
rooms. One would be actual and general, and four, similitudes and personal. 
Each of us would be able to change the shape, form, and colour of his per-
sonal room by means of his mirror. If we were to paint it red, it would appear 
red, if we were to paint it green, it would appear green. Likewise, we could 
alter it by adjusting the mirror; we could make it ugly, or beautiful, or give it 
different forms. But we could not easily adjust and change the outer, general 
room. While in reality the general and personal rooms are the same, in prac-
tice they are different. You could destroy your own room with one ﬁnger, 
but you could not make one stone of the other stir. 

Thus,  this  world  is  a  decorated  house.  The  life  of  each  of  us  is  a  full-
length mirror. Each of us has a world from this world, but its support, centre, 
and door is our life. Indeed, that personal world of ours is a page and our life 
is a pen; many things that are written with it pass to the page of our actions. 
We love our world, but later see that since it is constructed on our life, like it, 
it is ﬂeeting, transitory, and unstable. We perceive and understand this, and 
our love for it is redirected to the beautiful impresses of the divine names to 
which our personal world is the mirror and which it reﬂects; it switches from 
our world to the manifestations of the names. Moreover, if we are aware that 
that personal world of ours is a temporary seedbed of the hereafter and Para-
dise, and if we direct our feelings for it like intense desire, love, and greed, 
towards the beneﬁts of the hereafter, which are its results, fruits, and shoots, 
then that passing love is transformed into true love. Otherwise, manifesting 
the meaning of the verse,

( 59:19 ) K J I H G F E D 
a person will forget himself, not think of life’s ﬂeeting nature, suppose his 
personal, unstable world to be constant like the general world, and imag-
ine himself to be undying; he will ﬁx himself on the world and embrace 
it with intense emotions; he will drown in it and depart. Such love will be 
boundless torment and tribulation for him. For an orphan-like compassion,  

FIRST LETTER

27

a despairing softness of heart will be born of that love. He will pity all living 
beings. Indeed, he will feel sympathy for all beautiful creatures which suffer 
decline, and the pain of separation, but he will be able to do nothing, he will 
suffer in absolute despair.

However, the ﬁrst man, who is saved from heedlessness, ﬁnds an elevated 
antidote for the pain of that intense compassion. For in the death and decline 
of all the living beings he pities, he sees that the mirrors of their spirits are 
immortal, for in them are depicted the perpetual manifestations of the endur-
ing  names  of  an  Ever-Enduring  One;  his  compassion  is  transformed  into 
joy. He also sees behind all beautiful creatures, which are subject to death 
and transience, an impress, a making beautiful, an art, adornment, bestowal, 
and illuminating that are permanent and that make perceived a transcendent 
beauty, a sacred loveliness. He sees the death and transience to be renewal, 
the  purpose  of  which  is  to  increase  the  beauty,  refresh  the  pleasure,  and 
exhibit the art, and this augments his pleasure, his ardour, his wonder.

Thirdly: You sent me a present and want to break an extremely impor-
tant  rule  of  mine!  Just  this  time  I  am  not  going  to  say:  “ I  don’t  accept 
presents from you in the same way that I don’t accept them from Abdülme-
cid  2 and Abdurrahman  3 my brother and nephew, ” because since you are 
more advanced than them and closer in spirit, I can’t refuse them even if I 
refuse everyone else’s. But apropos of this, I shall tell you the reason for my 
rule. It is like this:

The Old Said never accepted favours. He preferred death to becoming 
obliged  to  people.  He  never  broke  that  rule  of  his  despite  suffering  great 
hardship and difﬁculty. This wretched brother of yours inherited this char-
acteristic from the Old Said, and it is not asceticism or artiﬁcial self-sufﬁ-
ciency; there are four or ﬁve important reasons for it:

1.  This refers to Hulûsi Yahyagil, “ the ﬁrst student of the Risale-i Nur. ” He was from 
Elazığ in eastern Turkey and was then serving as a captain in the army stationed at Eğridir. 
He ﬁrst visited Bediuzzaman in the spring of 1929. In Bediuzzaman’s words, “ his zeal 
and seriousness were the most important reason for the last of  T h e   Wo r d s  ( S ö z l e r  ) and 
L e t t e r s  ( M e k t û b a t  ) being written. See, B a r l a   L a h i k a s ı , 21. Also, Necmeddin Şahiner, S o n  
Ş a h i t l e r , I ( 1st ed. ), 33-55. ( Tr. )

2.  Abdülmecid ( ‘Abd al-Majīd ) was Bediuzzaman’s younger brother. A teacher of 
the religious sciences, then a Mufti, he translated parts of the Risale-i Nur into Arabic, and 
I s h ā r ā t   a l - I ‘ j ā z  and a l - M a t h n a w ī   a l - ‘ A r a b ī   a l - N ū r ī  ( M e s n e v î - i   N u r i y e  ) from Arabic into 
Turkish. He died in 1967. ( Tr. )

3.  Abdurrahman was the son of Bediuzzaman’s elder brother, Abdullah. He was born 
in  Nurs  in  1903.  Bediuzzaman  called  him  his  spiritual  son,  student,  and  assistant.  He 
joined his uncle in Istanbul following First World War, and published a short biography of 
him at that time. He died in 1928. ( Tr. )

SECOND LETTER

29

The First: The people of misguidance accuse religious scholars of secur-
ing  advantage  through  their  learning.  They  attack  them  unfairly,  saying: 
“ They  are  exploiting  knowledge  and  religion  to  make  a  living  for  them-
selves. ” This has to be shown to be false in practice.

The Second: We are charged with following the prophets in disseminat-

ing the truth. In the All-Wise Qur’an those who do this say:

( 10:72 ) O N M L K   ..O N M L K
and they display independence. Most meaningful in regard to this matter is 
the verse in Sura Ya. Sin.:

( 36:21 ) ~ } | { z y x
The Third: As is explained in the First Word, one should give in Allah’s 
name  and  take  in  Allah’s  name.  Whereas  mostly  either  the  one  giving  is 
heedless and gives in his own name and implicitly puts the recipient under 
an obligation, or the recipient is heedless; he gives the thanks and praise due 
to the True Provider to apparent causes and is in error.

The Fourth: Reliance on Allah, contentment, and frugality are such a 
treasury  and  wealth  they  can  be  exchanged  for  nothing.  I  do  not  want  to 
take things from people and shut up that inexhaustible treasury. I offer end-
less thanks to the All-Glorious Provider that since my childhood He has not 
compelled me to remain under obligation and so suffer abasement. Relying 
on His muniﬁcence, I beseech His mercy that I may remain faithful to this 
rule for the rest of my life.

The Fifth: In consequence of many signs and experiences over the past 
year  or  two  I  have  formed  the  ﬁrm  conviction  that  I  am  not  permitted  to 
accept people’s goods and particularly the gifts of the rich and of ofﬁcials. 
Some make me ill. Indeed, they are made to be like that; they are made so 
that I cannot eat them. Sometimes they are turned into a form that upsets 
me. This must be a sort of command not to accept the goods of others, pro-
hibiting  me  from  accepting  them.  Moreover,  I  have  a  need  for  solitude,  I 
cannot receive everyone all the time. Accepting people’s gifts necessitates 
considering their feelings and accepting them at times I do not want to. And 
I do not ﬁnd that agreeable. I ﬁnd it more agreeable to eat a small piece of 
dry bread and wear clothes patched in a hundred places, and be saved from 
fawning  and  artiﬁciality.  It  is  disagreeable  for  me  to  eat  the  best  quality 
b a k l a v a  and wear the ﬁnest clothes at the hands of others and be obliged to 
consider their feelings.

30

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

The Sixth: The most important reason for self-sufﬁciency is what Ibn 
Hajar, the most reliable scholar of our school of law, says: “ If you are not 
righteous it is forbidden to accept something intended for the righteous. ” 1

Out of their greed and ambition, the people of this age sell the smallest 
gift very expensively. They imagine a sinful wretch like myself to be right-
eous or a saint and they give him a loaf of bread. If, Allah forbid, I consider 
myself to be righteous, it is a sign of pride and points to the absence of right-
eousness. If I do not consider myself to be righteous, it is not permissible to 
accept those goods. Also, to receive alms and gifts in return for actions that 
look to the hereafter means consuming the eternal fruits of the hereafter in 
transitory form in this world.

[ Part of a letter sent to the well-known student of his. 1  ]

F i f t h l y :  You wrote in one of your letters to me that you wanted to share 

my feelings here, so listen now to one thousandth of them.

One night at the height of a hundred-storey building in my tree-house at 
the top of a cedar tree, I looked at the beautiful face of the heavens gilded 
with stars and saw an elevated light of miraculousness and brilliant secret of 
eloquence in the All-Wise Qur’an’s oath of,

( 81:15-16 ) _ ^  * \ [ Z 
This verse, which refers to the planets and their being concealed and spread 
abroad, displays to the gaze of observers an elevated embroidery full of art 
and an exalted, instructive tapestry. The planets emerge from the sphere of 
the sun, their commander, and entering that of the ﬁxed stars, display fresh 
embroideries and instances of art in the skies. Sometimes they come shoul-
der  to  shoulder  with  another  star  like  themselves  and  display  a  beautiful 
situation. At other times they enter among the small stars and assume the 
position of commander. Especially in this season after evening, Venus on 
the horizon, and before the early dawn one of its shining companions, dis-
play a truly graceful and lovely scene. Later, after carrying out their duties 
as inspectors and acting as shuttles in the tapestries of art, they return, and 
entering the dazzling sphere of the sun, hide themselves. Now they dem-
onstrate as brilliantly as the sun the majestic dominicality and glittering 

1.  See, p. 28, fn. 1.

31

32

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

divine sovereignty of the One who spins this earth of ours and the planets 
described in the above verse with perfect order in space, each like a ship or 
aeroplane. See that majestic dominion which has under its sway ships and 
aeroplanes a thousand times larger than the earth, and that travel thousands 
of times faster.

You can see from this what an elevated happiness, what a great honour, 
it is to be connected to such a Monarch through worship and belief, and to 
be his guest.

Then I looked at the moon and saw a shining light of miraculousless in 

the verse,

( 36:39 ) Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾
Indeed, the determining, rotating, regulating, and illuminating of the moon, 
and its positioning in regard to the earth and the sun with precise reckoning 
is so wonderful, so astonishing, that nothing at all could be difﬁcult for the 
All-Powerful One who orders and determines it thus. It instructs all beings 
with  intelligence  who  behold  it,  conveying  to  them  the  idea  that  the  One 
who makes it thus can surely do everything. It follows the sun and does not 
deviate from its path even for a second, or lag behind one iota in its duties. 
It makes those who observe it carefully exclaim: 
ُلوُ(cid:163)ُ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)ا ِه ِ(cid:151)ْ(cid:179) ُ(cid:134) ىِ(cid:158) َرَ

it comes into conjunction with the Pleiades in the shape of a ﬁne crescent, 
appearing as the curved white branch of a date-palm, and the Pleiades appear 
as a bunch of grapes, it conjures up in the imagination the existence of a 
huge luminous tree behind the veil of the green heavens. As if the pointed 
tip of one of the tree’s branches had pierced the veil and stuck out its head 
together with its bunch of grapes and become the Pleiades and the crescent 
moon, and the other stars had become the fruits of that hidden tree. See the 
subtlety and eloquence of the metaphor of: Ä Ã

Then this verse occurred to me,

( 67:15 ) B A @ ? > = < ; : 9 8 7 6 5 4
which suggests that the earth is a mastered ship or mount. From this I saw 
myself high up in a huge ship speeding through space. I recited the verse,

( 43:13 ) N M L K J I H G F 

THIRD LETTER

33

which it is S u n n a  to recite when mounting such means of transport as horses 
or ships. 1

I saw that with its motion the globe of the earth had assumed the position 
of a projector showing images as in the cinema; it brought into movement 
all the heavens and began to mobilize all the stars like a magniﬁcent army. 
It shows such lofty scenes that it intoxicates those who think and ﬁlls them 
with  wonder.  “ Glory  be  to  Allah! ”  I  exclaimed,  “ What  numerous,  vast, 
strange, wonderful, and elevated works are performed at so little expense! ” 
Two subtle points concerning belief occurred to me after this:

The First: A few days ago I was asked a question by a guest: the gist 
of it, which inferred doubt, was this: Paradise and Hell are a great distance 
away. Through divine grace, the people of Paradise will pass through the 
resurrection like lightning or as swiftly as Buraq, and enter Paradise. But the 
people of Hell, how will they go, with their ponderous bodies, loaded down 
with the heavy burdens of their sins? How will they travel?

What occurred to me was this: if for example all nations are invited to 
a general congress in America and each boards a huge boat and goes there, 
in the same way, the globe, which travels the long distance of twenty-ﬁve 
thousand years in one year in the vast ocean of the universe, will take on 
its people, travel to the ﬁeld of the resurrection, and disembark them. Fur-
thermore,  the  Hell  at  the  centre  of  the  earth  is  indicated  by  the  fact  that 
the earth’s temperature increases one degree every thirty-three metres. That 
Hell will pour its ﬁre into the Greater Hell, whose temperature of two hun-
dred thousand degrees is similar to that described in Hadith and according 
to Hadiths will carry out some of the duties of the Greater Hell in this world 
and the Intermediate Realm. 2 Then at a divine command, the earth will be 
transformed into a better, eternal form, and will become one of the habita-
tions of the hereafter.

The  Second  Point  which  comes  to  mind:  it  is  the  custom  of  the  All-
Powerful  Maker,  the  All-Wise  Creator,  the  Single  One  of  Unity,  in  order 
to demonstrate the perfection of His power and beauty of His wisdom and 
proofs of His unity, to perform many works with very little and to have large 
duties carried out by small things. As I have said in some of the Wo r d s , if 
all things are attributed to a single being, they become so easy as to be nec-
essary.  Whereas  if  they  are  attributed  to  numerous  makers  and  causes,  as 
many difﬁculties arise as to make them impossible. For a single person like 

1.  M u s l i m , Ḥajj, 425; A b ū   D ā ’ ū d , Jihād, 72, 74; Ti r m i d h ī , Da‘wāt, 46.
2.  See, B u k h ā r ī , Bad’ al-Khalq, 10; M u s l i m , Janna, 30; Ti r m i d h ī , Jahannam, 7; M u s -

n a d , ii, 313.

34

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

an ofﬁcer or master builder easily positions numerous soldiers or numerous 
stones with a single act, a single movement, and obtains a result. But if, in 
order to obtain those positions and results, it is referred to the soldiers in 
the army or the stones of the dome, which is without support, they could 
be achieved only with truly numerous acts, numerous difﬁculties, and great 
confusion.

And so, if such acts as the whirling and rotations, the circulation and rev-
olutions, and the gloriﬁcation-scattering promenading and excursions of the 
four seasons and day and night in the universe are ascribed to unity, then by 
impelling a single globe with a single command, a Single Being can obtain 
those elevated situations and exalted results. He can display the wonders of 
art in the alternation of the seasons, and the marvels of wisdom in the revolu-
tions of day and night, and the graceful spectacles in the apparent motions of 
the stars, sun, and moon. For the army of all beings is His. If He wishes, He 
may appoint a soldier like the earth to be commander of all the stars, make 
the mighty sun a lamp furnishing heat and light for his people, and the four 
seasons, which are tablets of the inscriptions of His power, as shuttles, and 
night and day, which are pages for the writings of His wisdom, He can make 
into bows. By showing each day the moon in a different shape, He makes it 
a calendar for reckoning time. And just as He makes the stars adorned, ele-
gant, shining lanterns in the hands of the angels, dancing in ecstasy, so too 
He demonstrates many instances of wisdom that look to the earth. If these 
situations are not sought from One Being whose command, order, law, and 
regulation address all beings, then all the suns and stars would have to cut an 
inﬁnite distance each day with actual motion and inﬁnite speed.

It is because of the inﬁnite ease in unity and inﬁnite difﬁculty in multi-
plicity that businessmen and industrialists give a unity to multiplicity and so 
make things easy; that is, they form companies.

In Short: There are inﬁnite difﬁculties in the way of misguidance, and 

inﬁnite ease in the way of unity.

My Dear Brothers!
I am now on a high peak on Çamdağı ( Pine Mountain ), at the top of a 
mighty  pine  tree  in  a  tree-house.  In  lonely  solitude  far  from  men,  I  have 
grown accustomed to this isolation. When I wish for conversation, I imagine 
you to be here with me, and I talk with you and ﬁnd consolation. If there is 
nothing to prevent it, I would like to remain alone here for a month or two. 
When I return to Barla, 1 I shall search for some means for the verbal con-
versation with you I so long for, if you would like it. For now I am writing 
two or three things that come to mind here in this pine tree.

The First: This is somewhat conﬁdential, but no secrets are concealed 

from you. It is as follows:

Some of the people of reality manifest the divine name Loving One, and 
with its manifestations at a maximum degree look to the Necessarily Exist-
ent One through the windows of beings. In the same way – but only when 
he is employed in service of the Qur’an and is the herald of its inﬁnite treas-
uries  –  this  brother  of  yours  who  is  nothing,  but  nothing,  is  given  a  state 
whereby he manifests the divine names All-Compassionate and All-Wise. 
Allah willing, the Wo r d s  manifest the meaning of the verse: 

( 2:269 ) Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ »

denly occurred to me: “ On the Naqshbandi way one has to abandon four

things: the world, the hereafter, existence, and abandoning itself. ” It gave 
rise to the following thought:

“ On the way of impotence four things are necessary: absolute poverty, 

absolute impotence, absolute thanks, and absolute ardour, my friend. ”

Then the rich and colourful poem you had written, “ Look at the multi-
coloured page of the book of the universe, etc. ” came to mind. I gazed at 
the stars on the face of skies in the light of it, and I said to myself: If only I 
could have been a poet and completed it! Then I set about it although I have 
no ability to write poetry or verse, and what I wrote was not poetry. I wrote 
it as it occurred to me. You, my heir, may convert it into poetry and put it 
into verse. This is what occurred to me:

1.  That is, since innumerable miracles of power are exhibited on the face of the earth, 
which is the seedbed and tillage for Paradise, the angels in the world of the heavens gaze 
on those miracles, those marvels. And like the angels, the stars, resembling the eyes of 
the heavenly bodies, gaze on the ﬁnely fashioned creatures on the earth, and in so doing 
look at the world of Paradise. They look on both the earth and Paradise at the same time; 
they observe those ﬂeeting wonders in an enduring form in Paradise. That is to say, in the 
heavens, there are prospects of both worlds.

In his L e t t e r s  ( M a k t u b a t  ), Imam-i Rabbani 1 ( May Allah be pleased with 
him ), a sun of the Naqshbandi Order and its hero, said: “ For me, the dis-
closure of a single matter of the truths of faith is preferable to thousands of 
illuminations, ecstasies, and instances of wonderworking. ” 2

He also said: “ The ﬁnal point of all the Suﬁ ways is the clariﬁcation and 

unfolding of the truths of faith. ” 3

He  also  said:  “ Sainthood  is  of  three  sorts:  one  is  the  lesser  sainthood, 
which  is  the  well-known  sainthood.  The  others  are  the  middle  sainthood 
and  the  greater  sainthood.  Greater  sainthood  is  to  open  up  by  way  of  the 
legacy of prophethood a direct way to reality without entering the intermedi-
ate realm of Suﬁsm. ” 4

He said also: “ The Naqshi way is traversed with two wings; that is, by 
having  ﬁrm  belief  in  the  truths  of  faith  and  by  carrying  out  the  religious 
obligations. The way cannot be covered if either of these two wings is defec-
tive. ” 5 In which case, the Naqshi way consists of three veils:

The  First  and  most  important  is  to  serve  the  truths  of  faith  directly; 

Imam-i Rabbani travelled this way in his later years.

The Second is to [ advance the cause of ] the religious obligations and 
serve the glorious practices ( Sunna ) of the Prophet ( UWBP ) under the veil 
of the Suﬁ way.

1.  Shaykh Aḥmad Sirhindī was also known by the titles of Imām-i Rabbānī, Aḥmad 
Fārūqī, and Regenerator of the Second Millennium. He lived in India 971/1563-1034/1624, 
where he puriﬁed the religion of Islam of polytheistic accretions and efforts to degenerate 
it. He is also famous for his efforts to reform Suﬁsm. ( Tr. )

The Third is to strive to eliminate the sicknesses of the heart by way of 

Suﬁsm and to journey with the feet of the heart. 

Of  these,  the  ﬁrst  is  the  equivalent  of  obligatory,  the  second,  close  to 

obligatory, and the third, S u n n a .

Since the reality of the matter is thus, my conjecture is that if such per-
sons as Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qadir Gilani 1 ( May Allah be pleased with him ) and 
Shah Naqshband  2 ( May Allah be pleased with him ) and Imam-i Rabbani 
( May Allah be pleased with him ) were alive today, they would expend all 
their efforts on strengthening the truths of faith and tenets of Islam. For it is 
through them that eternal happiness is won. Any deﬁciency in them results 
in eternal misery. A person without faith will not enter Paradise, but very 
many will go there without Suﬁsm. Man cannot live without bread, but he 
can live without fruit. Suﬁsm is the fruit, the truths of Islam, basic suste-
nance. In former times, through spiritual journeying from forty days to as 
much as forty years, a person could rise to some of the truths of faith. But 
now, if through Almighty Allah’s mercy there is a way to rise to those truths 
in forty minutes, it surely is not sensible to remain indifferent to it.

Thus, people who have studied the thirty-three Wo r d s  closely state that 
they have opened up just such a Qur’anic way. Since this is a fact, I am of 
the opinion that the Wo r d s  so far written about the mysteries of the Qur’an 
are a most appropriate medicine and salve for the wounds of this time, and 
a most beneﬁcial light for Islam as a whole, which has been subject to the 
assaults of darkness, and a most right guide for those wandering bewildered 
in the valleys of misguidance.

You know that if misguidance arises from ignorance it is easy to dispel, 
but if it results from science and learning it is difﬁcult to eliminate. In former 
times only one person in a thousand was in the latter category, and only one 
in a thousand such people would be reformed through guidance. For such 
people fancy themselves. They do not know, but they think they do know. 
I think that Almighty Allah has bestowed the Wo r d s  at this time, which are 
ﬂashes of the Qur’an’s miraculousness, as an antidote to this atheistic mis-
guidance.

My hard-working brothers, zealous friends, and means of consolation in 

these lands of exile known as the world!

Seeing that Almighty Allah has made you shareholders in the notions He 
has imparted to my mind, it is surely also your right to share in my feelings. 
So as not to sadden you unduly, I shall skip the excessively grievous part of 
my loneliness in exile and tell you about another part, as follows:

These last two or three months I have been very much alone. Sometimes, 
once every two or three weeks or so, I have a guest with me; the rest of the 
time I am alone. For nearly three weeks now there has been no one working 
in the mountains near me; they have all dispersed.

One night in these foreign mountains, silent and alone amid the mournful 

sighing of the trees, I saw myself in ﬁve exiles of different hues.

The ﬁrst: because of old age I was alone and a stranger far from most of 
my friends, relations, and those close to me; I felt a sad exile at their hav-
ing left me and departed for the Intermediate Realm. Then another sphere 
of exile was disclosed within that one: I felt a sad sense of separation and 
exile at most of the beings to which I was attached, like last spring, having 
left me and departed. Then within that one a further sphere of exile opened 
up, which was that I had been parted from my native land and relatives, 
and was alone. I felt a sense of separation and exile arising from that too. 
Then because of it, the loneliness of the night and the mountains made me 
feel another pitiable exile. And then I beheld my spirit in an overwhelming

exile: it was ready to journey to eternity both from this exile and from the 
temporary  guesthouse  of  this  world.  I  exclaimed  to  myself  suddenly:  My 
Allah! How can I endure these exiles and layers of darkness? My heart cried 
out:

M y   L o r d !   I   a m   a   s t r a n g e r,   I   h a v e   n o   o n e ,   I   a m   w e a k ,   I   a m   p o w e r l e s s ,   I

Yo u r   C o u r t ,   O   A l l a h !
Suddenly the light of belief, the effulgence of the Qur’an, and the grace 
of  the  Most  Merciful  came  to  my  aid.  They  transformed  those  ﬁve  dark 
exiles into ﬁve luminous, familiar spheres. My tongue declared:

While my heart recited the verse:

My mind too addressed my soul, crying out in such distress and terror, say-

As Mawlana Jalal al-Din, 1 one of my masters, addressed his soul, I said:

his father, where he died in 672/1273. He was the author of the M a t h n a w ī , and p ī r  of the

So then my soul declared: “ Yes, yes, through impotence and reliance on 
Allah, and poverty and seeking refuge with Him, the door of light is ﬂung 
open and the layers of darkness are dispersed. All praise be to Allah for the 
light of belief and Islam! ” I understood the elevated truth expressed by the 
following lines of the famous Hikam Ata’iyya: 

 2   ُهَدَ(cid:106)َو  ْنـَ(cid:174) َدَ(cid:163)َ(cid:158) اَذاَ(cid:174)َو  *  ُهَدَ(cid:163)َ(cid:158)  ْنـَ(cid:174) َدَ(cid:106)َو اَذاَ(cid:174)
That is, the person who ﬁnds Him ﬁnds everything, while the person who 
fails to ﬁnd Him, can ﬁnd nothing. If he does ﬁnd something, it will only 
bring him trouble. I understood the meaning of the Hadith, ِءاَ(cid:92)َرُ(cid:155)ْ(cid:171)ِ(cid:170) ىَ(cid:92)وُ(cid:142) 3 and 
I offered thanks.

My brothers! Those dark exiles were lit up through the light of belief, yet 
they still affected me somewhat, provoking the following thought: “ Seeing 
that I am a stranger and in exile and shall go to another exile, have my duties 
in  this  guesthouse  been  completed?  Should  I  hand  over  the  Wo r d s   to  my 
brothers and completely sever all my ties? ” This is why I asked you whether 
the  Wo r d s   that  have  been  written  will  sufﬁce  or  whether  they  are  lacking 
something. That is, have I accomplished my duty so that with an easy heart 
I can cast myself into a light-ﬁlled, pleasurable, true exile, forget the world 
and say like Mawlana Jalal al-Din,

My Dear Brothers!
I gather you told Şamlı Hafız 1 to ask me two things:

THE FIRST

“ Like  the  dissemblers  in  early  times,  the  misguided  of  modern  times 
make  the  marriage  of  Allah’s  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace ) with Zaynab a pretext for criticism, considering it was intended to 
satisfy the lusts of the soul. ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  Allah forbid, a hundred thousand times! Such vile doubts 
cannot be harboured against that lofty one! The Messenger ( UWBP ) was 
such that from the age of ﬁfteen to forty when the blood is ﬁery and exuber-
ant and the passions of the soul enﬂamed, with complete chastity and purity 
he sufﬁced and was content with a single older woman, Khadija the Great 
( May Allah be pleased with her ) – as is agreed by friend and foe alike. His 
having numerous wives after the age of forty, that is, when bodily heat sub-
sides and the passions are quietened, is decisive, self-evident proof for those 
who  are  even  a  little  fair-minded  that  such  marriages  were  not  to  satisfy 
the carnal appetites, but were for other important reasons and instances of 
wisdom.

One of those instances of wisdom is this: as with his words, the actions, 
states, conduct, and deeds of Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) are the sources

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

The Companions transmitted the outward, public things, and his wives were 
the transmitters and narrators of the private matters of religion and injunc-
tions of the Shari‘a that became clear from his private conduct in the per-
sonal sphere; they performed that function. Perhaps half of the personal mat-
ters of religion and the injunctions concerning them come from them. That is 
to say, numerous wives of differing temperament were required to perform 
this necessary duty.

Now let us consider his marriage with Zaynab. In connection with the 

verse,

( 33:40 ) Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ » º ¹
which is one of the examples given in the Third Ray of the First Light in 
the Twenty-Fifth Word, it is written that given their many aspects, single 
verses state meanings that address all classes of men, each with its own 
understanding.

One class’s share of understanding of the above verse is this: according 
to a sound narration based on his own admission, Zayd, the Noble Messen-
ger’s ( UWBP ) servant whom he addressed as “ my son, ” divorced his proud 
wife because he did not ﬁnd himself equal to her. That is to say, with his 
perceptiveness, Zayd realized that Zaynab had been created with an elevated 
character different to his and that it was in her nature to be a prophet’s wife. 
As a spouse he found himself unequal to her and this caused incompatibility, 
so he divorced her. At Allah’s command, His Messenger ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ) took her. That is, as indicated by the verse, 

( 33:37 ) Z
which shows that it was a heavenly contract, the marriage was out of the 
ordinary, above external relations, and entered into purely on the orders of 
divine determining. Thus, the Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) submitted to the 
decree of divine determining and was compelled to do so; it was not at the 
behest of carnal desire.

The verse,

( 33:37 ) c b a ` _ ^ ] \ [  
comprises  an  important  injunction  of  the  Shari‘a,  a  general  instance  of 
wisdom, and a comprehensive, general beneﬁt pertaining to this decree of 
divine determining; it indicates that adults calling the young “ my son ” is 
not forbidden so that it should be the cause of ordinances being changed – 

SEVENTH LETTER

as though “ z i h a r , ” that is, a man saying to his wife “ you are like my mother, ” 
is forbidden. Also, great personages look to their followers in fatherly fash-
ion and address them as such, and divine messengers do the same with their 
communities. But this is because of their positions as leaders and messen-
gers; it is not in respect of their human personalities making it inappropriate 
for them to take wives from among them.

Another class’s share of understanding the verse is this: a great ruler 
looks  on  his  subjects  with  paternal  compassion.  If  he  is  a  spiritual  king 
holding both outward and inward rule, his compassion will be a hundred 
times  greater  than  that  of  a  father,  and  his  subjects  will  look  on  him  as 
their  father  as  though  they  were  his  real  sons.  The  paternal  view  is  not 
easily transformed into that of a husband, nor a girl’s view into that of a 
wife. Since according to this the public ﬁnd it inappropriate that a prophet 
should take the believers’ daughters in marriage, the Qur’an repels such 
doubts, saying: By virtue of divine mercy the Prophet ( UWBP ) is kindly 
towards you and he deals with you in fatherly fashion, and in the name of 
messengership you are like his children. But in regard to his human per-
sonality he is not your father so that it should be inappropriate for him to 
take a wife from among you. Even if he calls you “ son, ” according to the 
Shari‘a you can’t be his children! ”

My brother, to me the names ِم(cid:193) ِ(cid:110)َ

ّر(cid:170)َا appear as a light so vast it 
embraces the whole universe and satisﬁes all the eternal needs of all spir-
its, and so luminous and powerful it secures a person against all his innu-
merable enemies. The most important means I have found for attaining to 
these names, these two vast lights, are poverty and thanks, impotence and 
compassion; that is, worship and realizing one’s neediness. What comes to 
mind  in  this  connection  and  I  say  contrary  to  the  great  mystics  and  reli-
gious scholars, and even to Imam-i Rabbani, one of my masters, is this: the 
intense and brilliant emotion the Prophet Jacob ( Upon whom be peace ) felt 
for Joseph ( Upon whom be peace ) was not love or passion, but compas-
sion.  For  compassion  is  much  more  acute  and  brilliant  and  elevated  than 
passionate  love,  and  purer  and  more  worthy  of  the  rank  of  prophethood. 
Intense love and passion for worldly beloveds and creatures are not ﬁtting 
for the elevated rank of prophethood. This means that Jacob’s feelings were 
a  high  degree  of  compassion  which  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  describes  with 
brilliant eloquence and were a way of attaining to the name All-Compas-
sionate.  As  for  passionate  love,  which  is  a  way  of  attaining  to  the  name 
of All-Loving, it is more like Zulaikha’s love for Joseph ( Upon whom be 
peace ).  That  is  to  say,  however  much  higher  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous 
Exposition  shows  Jacob’s  ( Upon  whom  be  peace )  emotions  to  be  than 
Zulaikha’s, compassion is higher than passionate love to the same degree. 

ٰ
EIGHTH LETTER

My master, Imam-i Rabbani, did not consider worldly love to be altogether 
ﬁtting  for  the  rank  of  prophethood  and  therefore  said:  “ Joseph’s  virtues 
pertained to the hereafter, so love for him was not of a worldly kind that 
it  should  have  been  defective. ”  1  But  I  say:  “ Master!  That  is  an  artiﬁcial 
interpretation, the truth of the matter must be this: Jacob’s was not love but 
a degree of compassion a hundred times more brilliant, more extensive, and 
more elevated than love. ” Yes, in all its varieties, compassion is subtle and 
pure, while many sorts of love and passion may not be condescended to.

Furthermore, compassion is extremely broad. Because of the compassion 
a person feels for his child, he may well feel a kindness towards all young 
and all living beings even, and act as a sort of mirror to the comprehensive 
name All-Compassionate. Whereas passionate love restricts its gaze to its 
beloved and sacriﬁces everything for it. Or else while elevating and praising 
its beloved, it denigrates others and in effect insults them and abuses their 
honour. For example, someone said: “ The sun espied my beloved’s beauty 
and was embarrassed. Not to see it, it veiled itself in cloud. ” Lover, ﬁne sir! 
What right do you have to impute shame to the sun, which is a light-ﬁlled 
page of eight Greatest Names?

Moreover, compassion is sincere and wants nothing in return; it is pure 
and seeks no recompense. The self-sacriﬁcing, unselﬁsh tenderness of ani-
mals towards their young is evidence for this at the lowest level. Passionate 
love, however, desires remuneration and seeks return. The weepings of pas-
sionate love are a sort of demanding, a desiring remuneration.

Thus,  Jacob’s  ( Upon  whom  be  peace )  compassion,  the  most  brilliant 
light  of  Sura  Yusuf  –  the  most  brilliant  of  the  Qur’an’s  Suras  –  points  to 
the names Merciful and Compassionate. It informs us that the way of com-
passion is the way of mercy. And as a salve for the pain of compassion, it 
induces a person to utter:

[ Again part of a letter he sent to the same sincere student of his. ]

S e c o n d l y :  Your success, endeavour, and eagerness in spreading the lights 
of the Qur’an are a divine bestowal, a wonder of the Qur’an, a dominical 
( r a b b â n î  ) favour. I congratulate you! Now that we have come to a discus-
sion of wonderworking, bestowal, and favour, I shall tell you one of the dif-
ferences between wonderworking and bestowal. It is like this:

So long as there is no necessity for it, to display wonderworking is harm-
ful. Whereas to make known bestowal is to make known a divine bounty. If 
someone honoured with wonderworking knowingly manifests an extraordi-
nary matter and his evil-commanding soul is persistent, then since he relies 
on himself and on his soul and what he has disclosed and falls into pride, 
it may be that Almighty Allah is drawing him on by at ﬁrst granting him 
success. If he displays a wondrous act unknowingly; for example, a person 
has an unvoiced question and involuntarily he gives an appropriate answer 
and afterwards realizes this, it increases his conﬁdence, not in himself but 
in his Lord and Sustainer. He says: “ I have a Preserver who is training me 
better than I could myself, ” and this increases his reliance on Allah. It is a 
harmless sort of wonderworking. He is not obliged to conceal it but should 
not  advertize  it  intentionally,  because  of  pride.  For  since  it  is  apparently 
associated with the human power to act, he may ascribe it to himself. When 
it comes to bestowal, it is sounder than the second sort of wonderworking, 
the sound sort, and in my opinion is more elevated. To make it known it is to 
make known a bounty. The power to act has no connection with it, and the 
soul does not ascribe it to itself.

My brother! The divine bounties received by both you and me, particu-
larly in our service of the Qur’an, which for a long time past I have seen and 

48

NINTH LETTER

49

written about, are bestowals, and to make them known is to make known a 
divine bounty. This is why – to make known the divine bounty – I am men-
tioning the success of both of us in our service. I always knew that it would 
encourage you to offer thanks and not make you proud.

T h i r d l y :  I observe that the most fortunate person in this worldly life is he 
who sees the world as a military guest house, and submits himself and acts 
accordingly. Seeing it in this way, he may rise swiftly to the rank of winning 
Allah’s pleasure, the highest rank. Such a person will not give the price of a 
lasting diamond for something as valueless as glass, doomed to be broken. 
He will pass his life uprightly and with pleasure. Yes, matters to do with this 
world are like pieces of glass that will be broken, while the lasting matters 
of the hereafter are as precious as ﬂawless diamonds. The intense curiosity, 
fervent love, terrible greed, stubborn desires, and other intense innate human 
emotions  were  given  to  gain  the  matters  of  the  hereafter.  To  direct  them 
fervently towards the transitory things of this world is to give the price of 
eternal diamonds for doomed fragments of glass. A point has occurred to me 
in connection with this, so I shall recount it. It is like this:

Passionate  love  is  an  ardent  sort  of  love.  When  it  is  directed  towards 
transitory objects, it either causes its owner perpetual torment and pain, or, 
since the ephemeral ( m e c a z î  ) beloved is not worth the price of such fervent 
love, it causes the lover to search for an eternal one. Then passing love is 
transformed into true love.

Man possesses thousands of emotions, each of which has two degrees, 
one worldly ( m e c a z î  ), the other, true. For example, everyone feels anxiety 
about the future. A person is intensely anxious about the future, but then sees 
that he has no guarantee that he will reach the future he is so anxious about. 
Also, if it is his livelihood he is worried about, anyway it is promised, and 
the brief future is not worth such terrible anxiety. So he turns away from the 
future towards the true future beyond the grave, which is long-lasting and 
which for the heedless has not been promised. 

Man also displays intense ambition for possessions and rank, then he sees 
that the transient property which has been put temporarily under his supervi-
sion, and calamitous fame and high rank, which are dangerous and lead to 
hypocrisy, are not worth such intense ambition. He turns away from them 
towards spiritual rank and degrees in closeness to Allah, which constitute 
true rank, and towards provisions for the hereafter, and good works, which 
are true property. Worldly ambition, which is a bad quality, is transformed 
into true ambition, a lofty quality.

50

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

And, for example, with wilful obstinacy man expends his emotions on 
trivial, ﬂeeting, transient things. Then he sees that he pursues for a year 
something not worth even a minute’s obstinacy. Also, just to be obstinate, 
he  persists  in  something  damaging  and  harmful.  Then  he  sees  that  this 
powerful emotion was not given to him for such things and that to expend 
it on them is contrary to wisdom and truth. So he utilizes his intense obsti-
nacy, not on those unnecessary transient matters, but on the elevated and 
eternal truths of belief and essentials of Islam and service and duties per-
taining to the hereafter. Worldly obstinacy, a base quality, is transformed 
into true obstinacy; that is, ardent steadfastness and constancy in what is 
right, a ﬁne and good quality.

As these three examples show, if man uses the faculties given to him on 
account of the soul and this world, and behaves heedlessly as though he were 
going to remain here for ever, they will be the cause of bad morals and will 
be misspent and futile. But if he expends the lesser of them on the matters 
of this world and the more intense of them on spiritual duties and tasks per-
taining to the hereafter, they become the source of laudable morals and the 
means to happiness in this world and the next in conformity with wisdom 
and reality.

My  guess  is  that  one  reason  the  advice  and  admonitions  given  at  the 
present time have been ineffective is that those offering them say: “ Don’t 
be ambitious! Don’t be greedy! Don’t hate! Don’t be obstinate! Don’t love 
the world! ” That is, they propose something that is apparently impossible 
for those they address like changing their inborn natures. If only they would 
say: “ Turn these emotions towards beneﬁcial things, change their direction, 
their channel, ” both their advice would be effective, and they would be pro-
posing something within those persons’ will power.

F o u r t h l y :   The  differences  between  Islam  and  belief  ( or  faith–ī m ā n  ) 
have been frequently discussed by Islamic scholars. One group has said that 
they are the same, while another has said that they are not the same but that 
you cannot have one without the other. They have expressed various ideas 
similar to this. I myself have understood the following difference:

Islam  is  a  preference,  while  belief  is  a  conviction.  To  put  it  another 
way, Islam is to take the part of the truth and is submission and obedience 
to  it,  and  belief  is  acceptance  of  and  assent  to  the  truth.  Long  ago  I  saw 
certain  irreligious  people  who  fervently  supported  the  injunctions  of  the 
Qur’an. That is to say, by taking the part of the truth, such people were in 
one  respect  Muslim  and  were  called  “ irreligious  Muslims. ”  Then  later  I 
saw certain believers who did not evince support for the injunctions of the

NINTH LETTER

51

Qur’an nor take the part of them, and they reﬂected the epithet “ non-Muslim 
believers. ”

Can belief without Islam be the means of salvation?
T h e   A n s w e r :  Neither can Islam without belief be a means of salvation, 
nor can belief without Islam be a means. All praise and bounty is Allah’s, 
through  the  grace  of  the  Qur’an’s  miraculousness  the  comparisons  of  the 
R i s a l e - i   N u r  have shown the fruits of the religion of Islam and results of the 
Qur’anic truths in such a way that even if someone without religion does 
not understand them, he cannot be unsympathetic towards them. And they 
have demonstrated proofs of belief and Islam in such powerful fashion that 
if even a non-Muslim understands them, he is sure to assent to them. While 
being a non-Muslim, he would believe. Yes, the Wo r d s  show that the fruits 
of belief and Islam are as delectable as the fruits of the Tuba tree of Paradise, 
and that their results are as agreeable as the pleasures of happiness in this 
world and the next. They therefore induce in those who see them and know 
them a feeling of inﬁnite partiality, support, and surrender. Demonstrating 
proofs as powerful as the chains of beings and numerous as minute particles, 
they give rise to inﬁnite submission and strength of belief. On certain occa-
sions even, when testifying to belief while reciting the invocations of Shah 
َكِ(cid:170)ٰذ  ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) 
Naqshband,  and  when  saying:  اًدَ(cid:154)   ُثَ(cid:151)ْ(cid:93)ُ(cid:178)  ِهْ(cid:193)َ(cid:171)َ(cid:150)َو   ُتوُ(cid:175)َ(cid:178)  ِهْ(cid:193)َ(cid:171)َ(cid:150)َو  ىَ(cid:193)ْ(cid:111)َ(cid:178)  
I have experienced an inﬁnite feeling of partiality. If the whole world were 
given me, I would not sacriﬁce a single truth of belief. It causes me extreme 
distress to imagine the reverse of a single truth for a minute even. Were the 
whole world to be given me, my soul would renounce it unhesitatingly for 
the existence of a single truth of belief. I feel an inﬁnite strength of belief 
when I say,

[ This consists of the answers to two questions. ]

T h e   F i r s t  is about the footnote to the long sentence describing the trans-

formations of minute particles in the Second Aim of the Thirtieth Word. 1

The Clear Book and the Clear Record are mentioned in many places in 
the All-Wise Qur’an. Some Qur’anic commentators said they are the same, 
while  others  said  they  are  different.  Their  explanations  as  to  their  reality 
differ, but in short they said they are titles for divine knowledge. However, 
through the effulgence of the Qur’an I have formed this opinion: the Clear 
Record is a title for a variety of divine knowledge and command that looks 
to  the  World  of  the  Unseen  rather  than  to  the  Manifest  World.  That  is,  it 
looks to the past and the future more than to the present. That is, it looks 
to the origin, progeny, roots and seeds of things more than to their external 
existence. It is a notebook of divine determining (   k a d e r   ) , the existence of 
which has been proved both in the Twenty-Sixth Word and in a footnote in 
the Tenth Word. 2

Yes, the Clear Record is the title for an aspect of divine knowledge and 
the  divine  command.  For  since  the  origins,  roots,  and  sources  of  things 
result, with the utmost order and perfect art, in their [ external ] existences, 
they show that they are set in order in accordance with a notebook of the 
principles of divine knowledge. And since the results, progeny, and seeds of 
things comprise the programmes and indexes of beings that will come in the 
future, they surely infer that they are miniature collections of divine com-
mands. For example, it may be said that a seed resembles the programmes 

1.  See, T h e   Wo r d s  ( Istanbul: Sözler Publications, 2008 ), 571-2, fn. 21. ( Tr. )

TENTH LETTER

and indexes which will impart order to all the parts of the tree, and is like a 
miniature embodiment of the creative commands that specify the index and 
programme.

In short, the Clear Record resembles a programme or index of the tree 
of  creation,  the  branches  of  which  have  spread  throughout  the  past  and 
the  future  and  the  World  of  the  Unseen.  In  this  sense  it  is  a  notebook  of 
divine  determining  and  a  collection  of  its  principles.  Minute  particles  are 
despatched to their duties and motions in the bodies of things through the 
dictation and decree of those principles.

As  for  the  Clear  Book,  it  looks  to  the  Manifest  World  rather  than  the 
World of the Unseen. That is, it looks to the present more than to the past 
and the future. It is a title, a notebook, a ledger, of divine power and will 
more  than  of  divine  knowledge  and  command.  If  the  Clear  Record  is  the 
notebook of divine determining, the Clear Book is the notebook of divine 
power.

That is to say, the perfect art and order in the beings, essences, attributes, 
and qualities of things show that they are being clothed in existence through 
the principles of a perfect power and the laws of a penetrating will. Their 
forms are determined and speciﬁed, each is given deﬁnite proportions and 
a particular shape. This means the power and will have a universal, general 
collection of laws, a great ledger, according to which the particular exist-
ences and forms of things are cut out, sewn, and clothed. The existence of 
this  notebook,  like  the  Clear  Record,  has  been  proved  in  the  discussions 
about divine determining and man’s will. So see the foolishness of the peo-
ple  of  misguidance,  heedlessness,  and  philosophy,  for  they  perceived  the 
Preserved  Tablet  of  creative  power  and  the  manifestation,  reﬂection,  and 
similitude in things of that perspicuous book of dominical wisdom and will, 
but, Allah forbid, calling it “ nature, ” they made it blind. Thus, through the 
dictation  of  the  Clear  Record,  that  is,  through  the  decree  of  divine  deter-
mining and according to its principles, on creating, divine power writes the 
chains of beings, each of which is a sign, on the page of time known as the 
Tablet of Appearance and Dissolution (   L e v h - i   M a h v,   I s b a t   ) , and causes the 
motion of particles.

This means that the motion of particles is a vibration, a movement, aris-
ing  from  that  writing  and  copying,  as  beings  pass  from  the  World  of  the 
Unseen to the Manifest World, from knowledge to power. As for the Tablet 
of Appearance and Dissolution, it is an ever-changing notebook, a slate for 
writing and erasing, of the Supreme Preserved Tablet – which is ﬁxed and 

54

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

constant – in the sphere of contingency, that is, in beings, which constantly 
manifest life and death, existence and annihilation; it is the reality of time. 
Yes, time has a reality as does everything; the reality of what we call time, a 
mighty river ﬂowing through the universe, is like the page and ink of power 
as it writes on the Tablet of Appearance and Dissolution.

T h e   A n s w e r :  The knowledge is with Allah alone. The elevated instances

point  of  being  plain  that  the  globe  does  not  revolve  in  a  circle  aimlessly 
and pointlessly, but revolves around something important; it depicts the cir-
cumference of a vast arena. It travels around a huge place of exhibition and 
hands over its immaterial produce to it; because in the future the produce 
will be displayed there before the gazes of men. That is to say, it will ﬁll the 
circle, the circumference of which is a distance of approximately twenty-
ﬁve thousand years. Syria will be like a seed, according to one narration; 1 
the arena of the Great Gathering will be expanded out of that region. All the 
immaterial produce of the earth is for now sent to the notebooks and tablets 
of the arena which is beneath the veil of the Unseen, and in the future when 
the  arena  is  opened  up,  the  earth  will  pour  its  inhabitants  into  it  too.  Its 
immaterial produce will also be transposed to the Manifest Realm from that 
of the Unseen. Yes, as though it were an arable ﬁeld, a spring, or a measure, 
the earth has produced crops enough to ﬁll that vast arena, and the creatures 
that will occupy it have ﬂowed on from the earth; the beings to ﬁll it have 
departed from the earth. That is to say, the globe is a seed, and the arena of 
the Great Gathering and what it holds, a tree, a shoot, and a store. Just as a 
point of light becomes a luminous line or circle on moving at speed, so with 
its rapid, purposeful motion, the earth describes a circle of existence, and 
together with that circle of existence and its produce, gives rise to the arena 
of the Great Gathering.

[ This letter comprises a signiﬁcant remedy and points our four small 
gems from the treasuries of four verses. ]

My Dear Brother!
The All-Wise Qur’an taught my soul these four different matters at vari-
ous times. I am writing them now so that those of my brothers who wish 
may also receive instruction or have a share of them. With regard to subject 
matter, each is a sample, a small jewel, from the treasuries of four different 
verses and their truths. The form of each of the four topics is different, and 
so are the beneﬁts each yields.

FIRST TOPIC

( 4:76 ) V U T S R 
O my soul which is in despair due to doubts and scruples! The associa-
tion of ideas and the imaginings or suppositions that occur to one are a sort 
of involuntary expression or depiction. If they arise from good and luminos-
ity, the qualities and reality they possess are transposed to an extent to their 
forms and images – just like the sun’s light and heat are transposed to its 
reﬂection in a mirror. If such depictions are of something evil and dense, 
their qualities and requirements cannot pass or spread to their reﬂections. 
For example, the reﬂection in a mirror of something unclean or corrupt is 
neither unclean nor corrupt. Nor can a snake’s image bite.

In  consequence,  to  imagine  unbelief  is  not  unbelief,  and  to  imagine 
abuse is not abuse. Particularly if it is involuntary or some notion or specu-
lation occurs to one, then it is altogether harmless. Furthermore, according 
to the Sunni school, the people of truth, if the Shari‘a rules that a thing is 

55

56

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

bad or unclean, it is because it is prohibited by Allah. Since what we are 
discussing are involuntary associations of ideas and imaginings that occur to 
one without one’s consent, they are not subject to such prohibitions. How-
ever ugly or unclean the form they take, they are not ugly and unclean.

SECOND TOPIC

This is a fruit of the Pine, Cedar, and Black Poplar trees of Tepelice in 
the  mountains  of  Barla,  which  has  been  included  in  T h e   Wo r d s   1  and  not 
repeated here.

THIRD TOPIC

The two following matters are part of the examples given in the Twenty-
Fifth Word  2 showing the impotence of present-day civilization before the 
miraculousness  of  the  Qur’an.  They  are  two  examples  out  of  thousands 
proving how unjust are the laws of present-day civilization, which opposes 
the Qur’an:

The ruling of the Qur’an:

( 4:176 ) M L K J 
is both pure justice, and pure compassion. Yes, it is justice, for the over-
whelming majority of men take a wife and undertake to provide for her. 
As for women, they take a husband and load their livelihood on him, and 
this makes up for the deﬁciency in what they inherit. It is also a mercy, for 
a weak girl is greatly in need of kindness from her father and brothers. The 
Qur’an decrees that she receives this without worry. Her father does not 
look on her with misgivings, thinking of her as a harmful child because of 
whom half of his wealth will go to a stranger. His kindness is untainted by 
anxiety and anger. Her brother’s kindness and protection are free of rivalry 
and jealousy. He does not consider her as a rival who will destroy half the 
family and give a signiﬁcant part of their property to someone else. His 
protective and kindly feelings for her will not be marred by resentment and 
hostility. Thus, the girl, who is delicate and weak by nature, is apparently 
deprived of a small part, but in place of it she gains inexhaustible wealth 
in the form of the compassion and kindness of those close to her. Also, to 
give her more than her due with the idea of being more merciful to her than 
divine mercy, is not kindness but a great wrong. Indeed, the savage greed 
of the present time, which recalls the appalling cruelty of the live burial of 
girl children in the Age of Ignorance due to savage jealousy, may possibly

open the way to merciless wickedness. Like this one, all Qur’anic rulings 
conﬁrm the decree, 

( 21:107 ) d c b a `

FOURTH TOPIC

( 4:11 ) » º 
This low civilization, which causes injustice by giving daughters more 
than their due, perpetrates an even greater injustice by denying the mother 
her right. Yes, the compassion of mothers is a truly sweet, subtle, and lovely 
manifestion  of  dominical  mercy,  and  among  the  truths  of  the  universe,  is 
the one most worthy of respect and reverence. A mother is so generous, so 
compassionate, so self-sacriﬁcing a friend that driven by her compassion she 
will sacriﬁce all her world, her life, and her comfort for her child. A timid 
hen, even, at the simplest and lowest level of motherhood, will cast herself at 
a dog or attack a lion in order to protect her young, through a tiny manifesta-
tion of that compassion.

To deprive a mother, who is the bearer of such an honourable, lofty truth, 
of the property of her child is an appalling injustice, a savage lack of respect, 
a compounded wrongful insult, an ingratitude for bounties, that causes the 
divine throne of mercy to tremble and adds poison to a brilliant and beneﬁ-
cal cure for man’s social life. If those human monsters who claim to love 
humanity cannot understand this, for sure true humans can. They know that 
the  All-Wise  Qur’an’s  command  of, » º  is  pure  truth  and  pure 
justice.

My Dear Brothers!
You asked me a question that night and I did not reply, because it is not 
permissible to argue over questions of belief. Your discussion of them had 
turned into a dispute. For now I am writing very brief replies to your three 
questions, about which you were arguing. You will ﬁnd the details in  T h e  
Wo r d s ; the chemist wrote down which. But it did not occur to me to men-
tion the Twenty-Sixth Word, about divine determining and man’s faculty of 
will; have a look at that too, but don’t read it like a newspaper. The reason 
I advised the chemist to study of those Wo r d s  is this: doubts about matters 
of that sort arise from weakness of belief in the pillars of faith. Those Wo r d s  
prove all of them.

FIRST QUESTION

What wisdom does it spring from, Adam ( Upon whom be peace ) being 
expelled from Paradise and some of mankind, the sons of Adam, being sent 
to Hell? What was the reason for it?

T h e   A n s w e r :  The reason for it concerns the charging of duties: the duty 
with  which  Adam  was  charged  yielded  such  results  as  the  unfolding  of 
all  human  spiritual  progress  and  the  revealing  of  all  human  potentialities 
and man’s essential nature being a comprehensive mirror to all the divine 
names. If he had remained in Paradise, his rank would have been ﬁxed like 
that  of  the  angels;  man’s  potentialities  would  not  have  been  disclosed.  In 
any case, the angels, with their unchanging ranks, are numerous and there 
is no need for man to perform their sort of worship. Since divine wisdom 
required a realm of accountability commensurate with the potentialities of 

58

TWELFTH LETTER 

59

man, who would traverse inﬁnite degrees, he was expelled from Paradise for 
his well-known sin, sin being the requirement of human nature and contrary 
to  that  of  the  angels.  That  is  to  say,  just  as  it  was  pure  wisdom  and  pure 
mercy that Adam should be expelled from Paradise, so is it just and right that 
the unbelievers should be sent to Hell.

As is mentioned in the Third Indication in the Tenth Word, the unbeliever 
only committed only one sin in his short life, but the sin comprised inﬁnite 
wrongdoing. For unbelief is an insult to the whole universe; it negates the 
value of all beings, it denies the testimony to divine unity of all creatures, 
and is contempt towards the divine names, the manifestations of which are 
to be seen in the mirrors of beings. Therefore, in order to avenge the rights of 
beings on the unbeliever, their monarch, the All-Compelling One of Glory, 
casts the unbelievers into Hell, and this is pure right and justice. For an inﬁ-
nite crime demands inﬁnite punishment.

SECOND QUESTION

Why are devils created? Almighty Allah created Satan and evil; what is 
the wisdom in it? Isn’t the creation of evil, evil, and the creation of bad, bad?
T h e   A n s w e r :  Allah forbid, the creation of evil is not evil, the acquisition 
of ( k e s b  ) or desire for evil, is evil. For creation and bringing into existence 
look  to  all  the  consequences,  whereas  such  a  desire  looks  to  a  particular 
result, since it is a particular relation. For example, there are thousands of 
consequences of rain falling, and all of them are good. If due to misuse of 
their wills some people receive harm from the rain, they cannot say that the 
creation of rain is not mercy or that it is evil. For it is evil for them due to 
their  mischoice  and  inclinations.  Also,  there  are  numerous  beneﬁts  in  the 
creation of ﬁre and all of them are good. But if some people are harmed by 
ﬁre due to their misuse of it and their wills, they cannot say that the creation 
of  ﬁre  is  evil;  because  it  was  not  only  created  to  burn  them.  Rather,  they 
made a wrong choice and thrust their hands into the ﬁre while cooking the 
food, and made that servant inimical to themselves.

In Short: A lesser evil is acceptable for a greater good. If an evil which 
will lead to a greater good is abandoned so that a lesser evil should not 
occur,  a  greater  evil  will  have  been  perpetrated.  For  example,  there  are 
certainly some minor material and physical harms and evils in sending sol-
diers to ﬁght a j i h a d , but the j i h a d  leads to a greater good whereby Islam 
is saved from being conquered by inﬁdels. If the j i h a d  is abandoned due 
to those lesser evils, the greater evil will come after the greater good has 
gone, and that is absolute wrong. Another example: to amputate a ﬁnger 

60

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

which is infected with gangrene and has to be amputated is good and right, 
although it is apparently an evil. For if it is not amputated, the hand will be 
amputated and that would be a greater evil.

Thus,  the  creation  and  bringing  into  existence  of  evils,  harms,  tribula-
tions, satans, and harmful things, is not evil and bad, for they are created for 
the many important results they yield. For example, satans have not been set 
to pester the angels, and the angels cannot progress; their degrees are ﬁxed 
and deﬁcient. However, in the world of humanity the degrees of progress 
and decline are inﬁnite. There is an extremely long distance through which 
to progress, from the Nimrod’s and Pharaoh’s as far as the veracious saints 
and the prophets.

Thus, because of the creation of satans and the mystery of man’s account-
ability and the sending of prophets, an arena of trial and examination and 
striving and competition has been opened so that coal-like base spirits may 
be  differentiated  and  separated  out  from  diamond-like  elevated  spirits.  If 
there  had  been  no  striving  and  competition,  the  potentialities  in  the  mine 
of  humanity,  resembling  diamonds  and  coal,  would  have  remained  equal. 
The spirit of Abu Bakr the Veracious at the highest of the high would have 
remained on a par with Abu Jahl at the lowest of the low. This means that 
since the creation of satans and evils looks to vast, universal results, it is not 
evil or bad. The evils and instances of bad that arise from abuses and the 
particular causes known as man’s acquisition pertain to his voluntary actions 
not to divine creation.

I f   y o u   a s k   ?  The majority of humanity become unbelievers due to the 
existence of Satan; they embrace unbelief and suffer harm, despite the send-
ing  of  prophets.  If,  according  to  the  rule  “ The  majority  has  the  say, ”  the 
majority suffers evil as a result, then the creation of evil is evil and it may 
even be said that the sending of prophets is not a mercy. Isn’t that so?

T h e   A n s w e r :  Quantity has no importance in relation to quality. The true 
majority looks to quality. For example, if a date-palm has a hundred seeds 
and they are not planted in the earth and watered and so do not undergo a 
chemical reaction and manifest the struggle for life, they remain a hundred 
seeds worth virtually nothing. But if they are watered and are subject to the 
struggle for life, and then eighty out of the hundred rot due to their faulty 
make-up, but twenty become fruit-bearing trees, can you say that watering 
them was evil because most of them rotted? Of course you cannot say that, 
for the twenty have become twenty thousand. A person who loses eighty and 
gains twenty thousand suffers no loss, so it cannot be evil.

TWELFTH LETTER 

61

Another  example:  a  peahen  lays  one  hundred  eggs  and  they  are  worth 
ﬁve hundred k u r u s h . If the hen sits on the hundred eggs and eighty go bad 
and twenty hatch into peacocks, can it be said that the loss was high and 
the affair, evil; that it was bad to put the broody hen on the eggs and an evil 
occurred? No, it was not thus, it was good. For the peacock species and egg 
family lost eighty eggs worth four hundred k u r u s h , but gained twenty pea-
cocks worth eighty l i r a s .

Thus, through the sending of prophets and the mystery of man’s account-
ability, and through striving and ﬁghting with satans, in return for the hun-
dreds of thousands of prophets and millions of saints and thousands of mil-
lions of puriﬁed scholars they have gained, who are like the suns, moons, 
and stars of the world of humanity, mankind has lost the unbelievers and 
dissemblers, who are numerous in regard to quantity, insigniﬁcant in regard 
to quality, and like pernicious beasts.

THIRD QUESTION

Almighty  Allah  sends  calamities  and  inﬂicts  tribulations;  isn’t  this  an 

injustice towards the innocent in particular, and animals even?

T h e   A n s w e r :  Allah forbid, sovereignty is His. He holds sway over His 
possessions as He wishes. Moreover, a skilful craftsman makes you a model 
in  return  for  a  wage  and  dresses  you  in  a  bejewelled  garment  that  he  has 
artistically fashioned. Then in order to display his art and skill, he shortens 
it and lengthens it, measures it and trims it, and he makes you sit down and 
stand up. Can you say to him: “ You have made the garment that makes me 
beautiful ugly. You have caused me trouble, making me sit down and stand 
up. ”? Of course, you cannot say that. If you did, you would be crazy.

In just the same way, the All-Glorious Maker has clothed you in an artis-
tically wrought being bejewelled with such faculties as the eye, the ear, and 
the tongue. To display the embroideries of various of His names, He makes 
you  ill,  He  afﬂicts  you  with  tribulations,  He  makes  you  hungry,  He  ﬁlls 
you, He makes you thirsty; He makes you revolve in states like these. To 
strengthen  the  essence  of  life  and  display  the  manifestation  of  His  names 
He makes you pass through numerous such conditions. As is indicated in 
the comparison, if you ask: “ Why do you inﬂict these calamities on me? ” 
a hundred instances of wisdom will silence you. In any event, calm, repose, 
idleness, monotony, and arrest from motion are forms of non-existence, and 
harm. Motion and change are existence and good. Life ﬁnds its perfection 
through motion, it progresses by means of tribulations. Life performs vari-
ous  motions  through  the  manifestation  of  the  divine  names;  it  is  puriﬁed, 

62

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

ﬁnds strength; it unfolds and expands; it becomes a mobile pen to write its 
own appointed course; it performs its duty and acquires the right to receive 
reward in the hereafter.

Brieﬂy,  these  are  the  answers  to  the  three  questions  you  were  arguing 

over. Explanations of them are to be found in the thirty-three Wo r d s .

My Dear Brother!
Read this letter to the chemist and to anyone who heard the argument that 
you deem suitable. And convey my greetings to my new student, the chem-
ist, and tell him the following:

It is not permissible to have a heated discussion about subtle matters of 
belief like these in a social gathering. If it turns into an uncontrolled contest, 
while being a panacea it becomes poison. It is harmful for both those who 
speak and those who listen. It is permissible to discuss such matters moder-
ately and fairly, exchanging ideas. And tell him that if doubts occur to him 
about matters of this sort and he cannot ﬁnd the answer in  T h e   Wo r d s , he 
may write to me privately. And tell the chemist that it occurred to me that 
the dream he had about his late father might mean this: since his late father 
was a doctor, he may have helped some people who were close to Allah, and 
at the time of his death the spirits of those blessed people who were grateful 
to him were seen by the one closest to him, his son, in the form of birds. It 
occurred to me that they came to meet him with a sort of welcome and this 
would be intercession for his spirit. 

I send greetings to all the friends who were together here that night, and 

I pray for them.

My Dear Brothers!
You frequently ask about my situation and how I am, and why I have 
not applied for my release papers, and concerning my indifference towards 
politics and the state of the world. Since you have asked these questions on 
numerous occasions, and also ask them implicitly, I am compelled to reply 
not as the New Said, but in the language of the Old Said.

YOUR FIRST QUESTION

Are you comfortable? How are you? 
T h e   A n s w e r :  I offer endless thanks to the Most Merciful of the Merciful 
that He has transformed the various wrongs the worldly 1 perpetrate against 
me into various forms of mercy. It is like this:

Having  given  up  politics  and  withdrawn  from  the  world,  I  was  living 
in a mountain cave and thinking of the hereafter when the worldly wrong-
fully  plucked  me  from  it  and  sent  me  into  exile.  The  All-Compassionate 
and Wise Creator turned the exile into mercy; He transformed the solitude 
on the mountain, which was unsafe and exposed to factors that would harm 
sincerity,  into  a  retreat  in  the  safe  and  sincere  mountains  of  Barla.  While 
a  prisoner-of-war  in  Russia  I  made  up  my  mind  to  withdraw  into  a  cave 
towards the end of my life and prayed for it. The Most Merciful of the Mer-
ciful made Barla the cave and bestowed the beneﬁts without burdening my 

1.  ‘The worldly’ ( e h l - i   d ü n y a  ): those people whose view is restricted to the life of 
this world and who disregard the hereafter, or those who sell religion for this world. ( Tr. )

63

64

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

weak self with the difﬁculties and troubles of a cave. Only, in Barla there 
were two or three distrustful people, and I suffered torments because of their 
groundless fears. It was as though those friends of mine were thinking of my 
comfort, but because of their suspicions, they harmed both my heart and our 
service of the Qur’an. 

Moreover,  although  the  worldly  gave  the  document  in  question  to 
all  the  exiles,  and  released  the  criminals  from  prison  and  offered  them 
an amnesty, they wrongfully did not give it to me. However, in order to 
further  employ  me  in  the  service  of  the  Qur’an  and  make  me  write  to  a 
greater extent the lights of the Qur’an called the Wo r d s , my Compassionate 
Sustainer left me untroubled in this exile and transformed it into a great 
instance of compassion.

In addition, although the worldly left all the inﬂuential, powerful leaders 
and shaikhs who could interfere in their world in the towns and cities and 
permitted them to meet with their relatives and everyone, they unjustly iso-
lated me and sent me to a village. With one or two exceptions they allowed 
none of my relatives and fellow-countrymen to visit me. But my All-Com-
passionate Creator transformed that isolation into a vast mercy for me, for it 
left my mind clear and I was able to receive the effulgence of the All-Wise 
Qur’an as it is, free of malice and ill-will.

Also, the worldly deemed excessive the two commonplace letters I wrote 
in two years at the beginning of my exile. And now even, they are displeased 
at one or two people visiting me purely for the sake of the hereafter once 
every week or two or once a month; and they have harassed me because of 
this.  But  my  Compassionate  Sustainer  and  All-Wise  Creator  transformed 
their tyranny into mercy, for He transformed it into a desirable solitude and 
acceptable retreat for me during these Three Months, 1 which may gain for a 
person ninety years of spiritual ( m a n e v î  ) life. All thanks be to Allah for all 
situations, my situation and comfort are thus.

YOUR SECOND QUESTION

Why don’t you apply for your release papers?
T h e  A n s w e r :  I have been sentenced by divine determining ( k a d e r  ) in this 
matter, not by the worldly, so I apply to it. Whenever it gives permission, 
whenever it cuts off my sustenance here, then I shall go. The reality of this 
is as follows: there are two causes of everything that befalls one, one appar-
ent and the other, real. The worldly are the apparent cause; they brought me 
here. As for divine determining, that was the true cause; it sentenced me to 

1.  Ş u h û r - u   s e l â s e : the holy months of Rajab, Sha‘ban, and Ramadan. ( Tr. )

THIRTEENTH LETTER 

65

this isolation. The apparent cause acted wrongfully, whereas the true cause 
acted with justice. The apparent one thought like this: “ This man performs 
strenuous services to learning and religion; he may interfere in our world. ” 
Because  of  this  possibility,  they  exiled  me  and  perpetrated  a  threefold 
wrong. Then divine determining saw that my service of religion and learning 
was not really sincere, so it sentenced me to this exile. It transformed their 
compounded tyranny into a multiple mercy. Divine determining governs in 
the question of my exile and it is just, so I have recourse to it. The apparent 
cause  certainly  has  some  ostensible  reasons  and  things,  but  they  make  it 
meaningless to apply to them. If they possessed some right or some power-
ful cause, then application could have been made to them too.

I have completely given up their world – may it be the end of them – and 
their politics – may it rebound on them – so I do not want to imbue their sus-
picions with reality by applying to them, since the pretexts and suspicions 
they think up are of course baseless. If I had felt any appetite to meddle in 
world politics, the reins of which are held by Westerners, it would not have 
remained  thus  secret  for  eight  hours  let  alone  eight  years;  it  would  have 
leaked out and become known. However, for eight years I have felt no desire 
to read a newspaper, and I have not read one. And for four years I have been 
here under surveillance, and there has not been the slightest sign that I have 
meddled in politics. That is to say, service of the All-Wise Qur’an is superior 
to all politics so that it does not let a person condescend to [ concern himself 
with ] world politics, which consists mostly of falsehood.

The second reason for my not applying is this: to claim a right before 
those who suppose wrong to be right, is a sort of wrong. I do not want to 
perpetrate such a wrong.

YOUR THIRD QUESTION

Why  are  you  so  indifferent  towards  world  politics?  You  don’t  change 
your attitude at all, even though so many things are happening. Does this 
mean you consider them to be good, or are you frightened, so remain silent?
T h e   A n s w e r :   Service  of  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  severely  prohibited  me

story  of  my  life  testiﬁes  that  fear  has  never  taken  me  by  the  hand  and 
held  me  back  from  taking  a  way  I  deemed  right,  nor  could  it.  And  why 
should I be frightened? I have no connection with the world apart from the 
appointed hour. I have no family or children to think of, nor any property. 
I don’t belong to a noble family that I should consider its honour. I would

not want to preserve worldly glory and renown which consists of hypocriti-
cal, undeserved fame; may Allah bless those who help in destroying it! So 
all  that  remains  is  my  death  and  that  is  in  the  hands  of  the  All-Glorious 
Creator. Who has the power to intervene in it before the time of its coming? 
Anyway we are one of those who prefer honourable death to degradation in 
life. Someone resembling the Old Said spoke the following lines:

In any event, service of the Qur’an prohibits me from thinking of socio-
political life. It is like this: human life is a journey. I saw at this time through 
the light of the Qur’an that the way has entered a swamp. The caravan of 
mankind is stumbling forward in stinking, ﬁlthy mud. Part of it is travelling 
a safe way. Another part has found certain means to save itself as far as is 
possible  from  the  muddy  swamp.  But  the  great  majority  are  travelling  in 
darkness in the midst of it. Twenty per cent suppose the ﬁlthy mud to be 
musk and ambergris because they are drunk, and are smearing it over their 
faces and eyes; they stumble on till they drown in it. However, eighty per 
cent understand it is a swamp and realize it is stinking and ﬁlthy, but they are 
bewildered and cannot discern the safe way. There are two solutions:

The First: to bring the drunken twenty per cent to their senses with a 

club.

them a light.

The  Second:  to  point  out  the  safe  way  to  the  bewildered  by  showing 

I  look  and  see  that  eighty  people  are  brandishing  clubs  at  the  twenty 
per cent, while the light is not properly shown to the unhappy, bewildered 
eighty. Even if it is shown, since those showing it hold both the club and 
the light in the same hand, it does not inspire conﬁdence. The bewildered 
person anxiously wonders: “ Does he want to attract me with the light then 
hit me with the club? ” And sometimes when, due to some defect, the club is 
broken, the light ﬂies away too or else is extinguished.

Thus, the swamp is mankind’s dissolute social life, which breeds heed-
lessness  and  misguidance.  The  drunkards  are  those  obdurate  people  who 
take  delight  in  misguidance,  while  the  bewildered  ones  are  those  who 
detest misguidance but cannot extract themselves from it. They want to be 
saved, but cannot ﬁnd the way; they are confused. As for the clubs, they are 
the political currents, and the light, the truths of the Qur’an. Light cannot 
be  disputed,  nor  can  enmity  be  felt  towards  it.  No  one  can  detest  it  apart

My Dear Brother!

YOUR FIRST QUESTION

Why didn’t the Companions discover the troublemakers with the eye of 
sainthood, with the result that three of the four Rightly-Guided Caliphs were 
martyred? For it is said that even the lesser Companions were greater than 
the greatest saints?

T h e   A n s w e r :  This matter comprises two stations.

First Station

First Station
The question may be solved by explaining as follows a subtle mystery of 

sainthood: 

The  Companions’  sainthood,  known  as  the  greater  sainthood,  is  one 
that  proceeds  from  the  legacy  of  prophethood,  and  passing  directly  from 
the apparent to reality without travelling the intermediate path, looks to the 
unfolding of divine immediacy. Although this way of sainthood is very short, 
it is extremely elevated. Its wonders are few, but its virtues are many. Illumi-
nations and wonderworkings are to be encountered on it only infrequently. 
Moreover, the wonderworking of the saints is mostly involuntary; wonders 
appear from them unexpectedly as a divine bestowal. And the majority of 
such illuminations and wonderworkings occur during their spiritual journey-
ing, as they traverse the intermediate realm of the Suﬁ path; they manifest 
those extra-ordinary states because they have withdrawn to a degree from 
ordinary  humanity.  As  for  the  Companions,  due  to  the  reﬂection,  attrac-
tion,  and  elixir  of  the  company  of  prophethood,  they  were  not  obliged  to 
traverse the vast sphere of spiritual journeying of the Suﬁ way. They were 
able to pass from the apparent to reality in one step, through one conversa-
tion with the Prophet ( UWBP ). For instance, there are two ways of reaching 
the Night of Power, if it was last night:

68

FIFTEENTH LETTER

69

One is to travel and wander for a year to reach it. One has to traverse 
a year’s distance to gain proximity to it. This is the method of those who 
embark on spiritual journeying, the way taken by most of those who follow 
the Suﬁ path.

The second is to slip free of and be divested of the sheath of corporeality, 
which is restricted by time, to rise in the spirit and see the Night of Power, 
which  was  last  night,  together  with  the  night  of  the  ‘Id,  which  is  the  day 
after tomorrow, as being present like today. For the spirit is not restricted by 
time. When the human emotions rise to the level of the spirit, present time 
expands.  Time,  which  for  others  consists  of  the  past  and  the  future,  is  as 
though the present for such a person.

According  to  this  comparison,  to  reach  the  Night  of  Power  one  has  to 
rise to the level of the spirit and see the past as though it were the present. 
Essentially, this obscure mystery is the unfolding of divine immediacy. For 
example, the sun is near to us, for its light and heat are present in the mirror 
we are holding. But we are far from it. If we perceive its immediacy from 
the point of view of luminosity, and understand our relation to its reﬂection 
in our mirror, which is a similitude; if we come to know it by that means 
and know what its light, heat, and totality are, its immediacy is unfolded to 
us and we recognize it as close to us and we become connected to it. If we 
want to draw near to it and get to know it in respect of our distance from it, 
we are compelled to embark on an extensive journeying in the mind, so that 
by means of thought and the laws of science we can rise to the skies in the 
mind and conceive of the sun there, and through lengthy scientiﬁc investiga-
tion understand its light and heat and the seven colours in its light. Only then 
may we attain to the non-physical proximity the ﬁrst man attained with little 
thought through his mirror. 

Thus, like this comparison, the sainthood of prophethood and of the leg-
acy of prophethood looks to the mystery of the unfolding of divine imme-
diacy. The other sainthood proceeds mostly on the basis of proximity, and is 
compelled to traverse numerous degrees in spiritual journeying.

The persons who were the cause of those events and instigated the trou-
ble did not consist of a few Jews so that having discovered them the trou-
ble could have been averted. For with numerous different peoples entering 
Islam, many mutually conﬂicting currents and ideas had confused the situa-
tion. Particularly since the national pride of some of them had been terribly 

70

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

wounded by ‘Umar’s ( May Allah be pleased with him ) blows; they were 
waiting  to  take  their  revenge.  For  both  their  old  religions  had  been  ren-
dered null and void and their old rule and sovereignty, the source of their 
pride, been swept away. Knowingly or unknowingly, they were emotion-
ally in favour of seeking vengeance on Islamic rule. It was therefore said 
that some clever, scheming dissemblers like the Jews took advantage of 
that state of society. That is to say, it could have been averted by reform-
ing the society and the various ideas of the time, not by discovering one or 
two troublemakers.

I f   i t   i s   a s k e d :   Why,  with  that  piercing  eye  of  sainthood  of  his,  didn’t 
‘Umar ( May Allah be pleased with him ) see his murderer, Firuz, who was 
with  him,  although  while  in  the  pulpit  he  said  to  one  of  his  commanders 
called Sariya who was a month’s distance away,  َلَ(cid:93)َ(cid:107)ْ(cid:170)َا  َلَ(cid:93)َ(cid:107)ْ(cid:170)َا ُةَ(cid:192)ِراَ(cid:126) اَ(cid:192)  1 mak-
ing  Sariya  hear  it  and  in  wondrous  fashion  causing  a  strategic  victory  – 
showing how penetrating his sight was?

T h e   A n s w e r :   Our  answer  is  that  of  the  Prophet  Jacob  ( UWP ).22  That 
is,  Jacob  was  asked:  “ How  did  you  perceive  the  odour  of  Joseph’s  shirt 
from Egypt when you did not see him in the well at Cana’an close by? ” He 
replied: “ This ability is like lightning; sometimes it appears and sometimes 
it is hidden. Sometimes we are as though seated on the highest spot and can 
see everwhere, and sometimes we can’t see even the arch of our foot. ”

In Short: Man is free to act as he wills, still, in accordance with the verse, 
( 76:30 ) M L K J I H  divine will is fundamental, divine deter-
mining ( k a d e r  ) is dominant. Divine will restores man’s will. It conﬁrms the

THE GIST OF YOUR SECOND QUESTION

What was the true nature of the wars that started in the time of ‘Ali ( May 
Allah be pleased with him )? What should we call those who took part in 
them, and those who died and those who killed?

T h e   A n s w e r :  The war between ‘Ali and Talha, and Zubayr and ‘A’isha 
the Veracious ( May Allah be pleased with all of them ), called the Event of 
the Camel, was a struggle between pure justice and relative justice. It was 
as follows:

‘Ali took pure justice as his guiding principle and in his judgement of 
the Law proceeded on that basis, as was the case in the time of the Caliphs 
Abu  Bakr  and  ‘Umar.  Those  who  opposed  him  said  that  previously  the 
purity of Islam had permitted pure justice, but since with the passage of 
time various peoples whose Islam was weak had joined Islamic society, to 
apply pure justice was extremely difﬁcult. For this reason, their judgement 
of the Law was based on relative justice, known as the lesser of two evils. 
Dispute over interpretation of the Law led to war. Since the interpretations 
had  been  purely  for  Allah’s  sake  and  for  the  beneﬁt  of  Islam,  and  war 
had broken out because of interpretation of the Law, we may surely say 
that both those who killed and those who were killed won Paradise, and 
both acted rightfully. ‘Ali’s interpretation was accurate, just as those who 
opposed him were in error, but they still did not deserve punishment. For 
if a person makes a correct interpretation, he gains two rewards, but if he 
fails to do this he still earns one reward, the reward for making an inter-
pretation, which is a form of worship. He is forgiven his error. A learned 
person  who  was  widely  known  amongst  us  and  whose  pronouncements 
were authoritative wrote in Kurdish: 

ْ(cid:291)(cid:315)ـِ(cid:221)َ(cid:284) 

(cid:295)ـ َ(cid:304)و  ُ(cid:291)ِ(cid:220)אَ(cid:284) (cid:303)َ(cid:301)ـ(cid:315)ِ(cid:221)ـَّ(cid:301) َ(cid:228) ا َر  ْ(cid:307)َ(cid:292)  ْ(cid:291)ـ(cid:315)ِ(cid:284)و  ُلאَ(cid:284) (cid:303)َכ َ(cid:296)  ْنאَ(cid:214)א َ(cid:233) َ(cid:256) 

ِ(cid:243) َ(cid:252) ى ِژ

“ Don’t gossip about the war between the Companions, for both killer and 
killed were destined for Paradise. ”

Pure justice and relative justice may be explained as follows: according 

to the allusive meaning of the verse,

( 5:32 ) 5 4 3 2 1 0 / . - , + * ) 
the rights of an innocent man cannot be cancelled for the sake of all the peo-
ple. An individual may not be sacriﬁced for the good of all. In the view of 
Almighty Allah’s compassion, right is right, there is no difference between 
great and small. The small may not be annulled for the great. Without his 
consent,  the  life  and  rights  of  an  individual  may  not  be  sacriﬁced  for  the 
good of the community. If he consents to sacriﬁce them in the name of patri-
otism, that is a different matter.

As for relative justice, a particular is sacriﬁced for the good of the uni-
versal; the rights of an individual are disregarded in the face of the commu-
nity. The attempt is made to apply a sort of relative justice as the lesser of 
two evils. But if it is possible to apply pure justice, to apply relative justice 
is wrong and may not be undertaken.

Thus, Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ) judged it possible to  
apply pure justice as in the time of the Caliphs Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, and 
he set up the Islamic Caliphate on that basis. Those who opposed him and 
objected to him said that it was impossible because of the great difﬁculties, 
and judged according to the Law that they should proceed with relative jus-
tice. The other historical reasons are not true reasons, they are pretexts.

I f  y o u  a s k :  What was the reason for Imam ‘Ali’s lack of success in regard 
to the Islamic Caliphate relatively to his predecessors, despite his extraordi-
nary capabilities, unusual intelligence, and great deservedness?

T h e   A n s w e r :  That blessed person was deserving of weighty duties other 
than politics and rule. If he had been completely successful in politics and 
government,  he  would  have  been  unable  to  acquire  fully  the  meaningful 
title of King of Sainthood. Whereas he won a spiritual rule far surpassing 
the external, political Caliphate, and became a universal master; in fact, his 
spiritual rule will continue even until the end of the world.

As for his war with Mu‘awiya at Sifﬁn, it was a war over the Caliphate 
and rule. That is to say, Imam ‘Ali gave priority to the injunctions of reli-
gion, the truths of Islam, and the hereafter, and sacriﬁced some of the laws 
of government and pitiless demands of politics. Whereas Mu‘awiya and his 
supporters, in order to strengthen Islamic society with their governmental 
policies, left aside resoluteness and favoured permissiveness; they supposed 
they were obliged to in the political realm; choosing permissiveness, they 
fell into error.

As  for  Hasan  and  Husain’s  struggle  against  the  Umayyads,  it  was  a 
war between religion and nationalism. That is, the Umayyads founded the 

FIFTEENTH LETTER

73

Islamic state on Arab nationalism and put the bonds of nationalism before 
those of Islam, causing harm in two respects:

The First Respect: They offended the other nations and frightened them 

off.

The Other: The principles of racialism and nationalism are not based on 
justice and right, so are unjust and wrongful. They do not proceed on justice. 
For a ruler of racialist leanings gives preference to people of the same race 
and cannot act justly. According to the clear decree of, 
  1 ا َ(cid:175)َ(cid:171) ْ(cid:126)َا اَذِا  ّ
ّ(cid:193)ِ(cid:171)ِ(cid:182)اَ(cid:107)ْ(cid:170)ا َةَ
ْ(cid:202)َا
the bonds of nationalism may not be set up in place of the bonds of religion. 
If they are, there will be no justice; right will disappear.

Thus, Husain accepted the bonds of religion as fundamental and strug-
gled against those others as someone executing justice, until he attained the 
rank of martyrdom.

I f   i t   i s   a s k e d :  If he was so right and just, why wasn’t he successful? Also, 
why did divine determining and divine mercy permit them to meet with the 
tragic end they did?

T h e   A n s w e r :  It was not Husain’s close supporters that harboured feel-
ings of revenge towards the Arab nation, but members of other nations who 
had joined his community, out of their wounded national pride. They caused 
harm to the pure, shining creeds of Husain and his supporters, and were the 
cause of their defeat.

The wisdom in their tragic end from the point of view of divine determin-
ing was this: Hasan and Husain and their family and descendants were des-
tined to hold spiritual rule. It is extremely difﬁcult to bring together worldly 
rule and spiritual rule. Therefore, divine determining made them feel disgust 
at the world; it showed them its ugly face so that they should cease to feel 
any attachment to it in their hearts. They lost a temporary, superﬁcial rule, 
but were appointed to a splendid, permanent spiritual rule. They became the 
authorities of the spiritual poles among the saints instead of commonplace 
governors.

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

T h e   A n s w e r :  As was explained above, there were three main reasons for 

the pitiless cruelty Husain’s opponents displayed during Umayyad rule:

One was the heartless principle of politics: “ Individuals may be sacri-

ﬁced for the welfare of the government and preservation of public order. ”

The Second was the cruel rule of nationalism: “ Everything may be sac-
riﬁced for the well-being of the nation. ” For his opponents’ rule was based 
on racialism and nationalism.

The Third: The traditional vein of rivalry between the Umayyads and 
the Hashimites was present in some people like Yazid, and he displayed a 
merciless ability to be cruel.

A Fourth Reason: The Umayyads made Arab nationalism the basis of 
their  rule,  and  they  looked  on  the  members  of  other  nations  –  who  were 
found  among  Husain’s  supporters  –  as  slaves.  This  had  wounded  their 
national  pride.  So,  since  the  other  nations  had  joined  Husain’s  community 
with mixed intentions and to take revenge, they felt excessively affronted at 
the Umayyad’s fanatic nationalism and were the cause of that terrible well-
known tragedy.

The four reasons mentioned above are outward and apparent. When con-
sidered from the point of view of divine determining, the results pertaining 
to the hereafter and spiritual rule and spiritual progress that the tradegy won 
for Husain and his relatives were of such high worth that the distress they 
suffered due to it was made easy and cheap. It resembled a soldier who dies 
after an hour’s torture and becomes a martyr: he attains a rank so high that 
anyone  else  could  reach  it  only  if  they  strove  for  ten  years.  If  the  soldier 
were to be asked about it after he had died, he would reply that he had gained 
much for very little.

THE GIST OF YOUR FOURTH QUESTION

After Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ) kills the Antichrist ( Dajjal ) at the 
end of time, most people will enter the true religion. But it says in some nar-
rations: “ The end of the world will not occur as long as there remain on the 
earth people who say, Allah! Allah! ” 1 So how after most people have come 
to believe, will they become unbelievers?

T h e   A n s w e r :   Some  people  whose  belief  is  weak  regard  as  unlikely 
what is narrated in the sound Hadith: “ Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ) will 
come and will act in accordance with the Shari‘a of Islam. He will kill

the Dajjal. ” 1 But when its meaning is explained, it is seen that there is noth-
ing unlikely about it. It is as follows:

What this Hadith and those about the Sufyan and the Mahdi  2 mean is 

this: at the end of time two atheistic movements will gain strength.

One of them: Behind a screen of duplicity, a fearsome individual named 
the Sufyan will deny the messengership of Muhammad ( UWBP ), and com-
ing to lead the dissemblers, will try to destroy the Islamic Shari‘a. To oppose 
him, a luminous individual called Muhammad Mahdi of the Family of the 
Prophet  ( UWBP )  will  assume  leadership  of  the  people  of  sainthood  and 
perfection, who are bound to the luminous line of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) 
Family, and he will kill the current of dissemblers, which will consist of the 
collective personality of the Sufyan, and scatter it.

The  Second  Current:  A  tyrannical  movement  born  of  naturalist  phi-
losophy will gradually grow strong at the end of time and spread by means 
of materialist philosophy, going so far as to deny Allah. A savage who does 
not recognize the king or accept that the ofﬁcers and soldiers in the army are 
his soldiers ascribes a sort of kingship and rulership to everyone and to all 
the soldiers. In just the same way, the members of that movement, who deny 
Allah, each ascribes dominicality to his soul like a little Nimrod. And the 
greatest of them, the Dajjal, who will come to lead them, will manifest awe-
some wonders, a sort of spiritualism and hypnosis; he will go even further, 
and imagining his tyrannical, superﬁcial rule to be a sort of dominicality, he 
will proclaim his godhead. It is clear just what foolish buffoonery it is for 
impotent man, who may be defeated by a ﬂy and cannot create even a ﬂy’s 
wing, to claim godhead.

At  that  point,  just  when  the  movement  appears  to  be  very  strong,  the 
religion of true Christianity, which comprises the collective personality of 
Jesus  ( Upon  whom  be  peace ),  will  emerge.  That  is,  it  will  descend  from 
the  skies  of  divine  mercy.  Present-day  Christianity  will  be  puriﬁed  in  the 
face of that reality; it will cast off superstition and distortion, and unite with 
the truths of Islam. Christianity will in effect be transformed into a sort of 
Islam. Following the Qur’an, the collective personality of Christianity will 
be in the rank of follower, and Islam, in that of leader. True religion will 
become a mighty force as a result of its joining it. Although defeated before

the atheistic movement while separate, as a result of their union Christianity 
and Islam will acquire the capability to defeat and rout it. Then the person 
of Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ), who is present with his human body in the 
world of the heavens, will come to lead the current of true religion, as, rely-
ing on the promise of One Powerful Over All Things, the Bringer of Sure 
News has said. 1 Since he has told of it, it is true, and since the One Powerful 
Over All Things has promised it, He will certainly bring it about.

Indeed, it is not far from the wisdom of the All-Wise One of Glory who 
all the time sends the angels to the earth from the heavens, sometimes in 
human  form  –  like  Gabriel  appearing  in  the  form  of  Dihya  2  –  and  sends 
spirit beings from the Spirit World making them appear in human form, and 
even sends the spirits of most of the dead saints to the world with similitudes 
of their bodies, it would not be far from His Wisdom – even if he were not 
alive and present with his body in the skies of the world and had truly died 
and departed for the furthest corner of the hereafter – to clothe Jesus ( Upon 
whom be peace ) in his body and send him to the world, so to bring the reli-
gion of Jesus to a ﬁtting conclusion; for such a momentous result. Indeed He 
promised it because His wisdom required it to be thus, and since He prom-
ised it, He will most certainly send him.

When Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ) comes, not everyone will know him 
to  be  the  true  Jesus.  His  elect  and  those  close  to  him  will  recognize  him 
through the light of belief. It will not be self-evident so that everyone will 
recognize him.

Q u e s t i o n :  There are narrations which say: “ The Dajjal has a false para-
dise where he sends those who follow him, and he also has a false hell into 
which he casts those who do not follow him. He has even made one of his 
mount’s ears into a paradise and the other one into a hell; his body is of such-
and-such vast dimensions; ” 3 they describe him like this?

T h e  A n s w e r :  The Dajjal superﬁcially resembles a human being. But he is 
arrogant and pharaoh-like and has forgotten Allah, so is a foolish satan and 
intriguing  man  who  calls  his  superﬁcial,  tyrannical  rule  godhead.  But  his 
atheistic movement, his collective personality, is truly vast. The awesome

descriptions of the Dajjal in the narrations allude to that. 1 At one time, the 
commander-in-chief  of  the  Japanese  army  was  depicted  with  one  foot  in 
the Paciﬁc Ocean and the other ten days’ distance away in Port Arthur. The 
collective personality of the commander-in-chief’s army was illustrated by 
depicting him in that way.

The  Dajjal’s  false  paradise  consists  of  the  alluring  amusements  and 
enticements  of  civilization.  His  mount  is  means  of  transport  like  the  rail-
way; at one end of the train is the ﬁre-box which sometimes sprays ﬁre on 
those  who  do  not  follow  him.  The  other  of  the  mount’s  ears,  that  is,  the 
other end of it, has been furnished like Paradise, where he seats his follow-
ers. Anyway, the railway, an important mount of sinful, cruel civilization, 
brings a false paradise for the dissolute and the worldly, while for the people 
of religion and Islam like the angels of Hell it brings dangers in the hand of 
civilization, and casts them into captivity and indigence.

For  sure,  when  the  true  religion  of  Christianity  emerges  and  is  trans-
formed into Islam, it will spread its light to the great majority of people in 
the  world,  but  when  the  end  of  the  world  approaches,  an  atheistic  move-
ment will again appear and become dominant. According to the rule, “ The 
word is with the majority, ” no one will remain on earth who says, “ Allah! 
Allah!; ”  2  that  is,  “ Allah!  Allah! ”  will  not  be  uttered  by  any  signiﬁcant 
group that holds an important position on the earth. The people of truth will 
form a minority or will be defeated, but they will remain permanently till the 
end of the world. Only, the moment Doomsday occurs, as a token of divine 
mercy, the spirits of the believers will be seized ﬁrst so that they do not see 
the terrors of the Last Day, and it will break forth over the unbelievers. 3

THE GIST OF YOUR FIFTH QUESTION

Will the immortal spirits be grieved at the events of the Last Day?
T h e   A n s w e r :  They will be grieved according to their degrees. They will 
be grieved in the same way that they are grieved at the overwhelming, wrath-
ful manifestations of the angels towards themselves. A person is affected in 
his mind and conscience if others are trembling in the snow and cold outside 
while he himself is inside in the warmth. Similarly, since they are connected 
to the universe immortal spirits are affected according to their degree by its

awesome  events.  The  Qur’an  indicates  and  alludes  to  this  and  to  the  tor-
mented being grievously afﬂicted, and those destined for happiness being 
struck  by  wonder  and  amazement,  and  even  rejoicing.  For  the  All-Wise 
Qur’an always mentions the extraordinary events of the resurrection in the 
form of threats; it says: “ You will see it! ” Whereas those who will witness it 
physically are those living at the Last Day. That is to say, spirits whose bod-
ies have rotted in their graves are also addressed by those Qur’anic threats.

THE GIST OF YOUR SIXTH QUESTION

Does the verse, j i h g f   ( 28:88 )  include the hereafter, Par-

adise, and Hell, and their inhabitants, or does it not include them?

T h e   A n s w e r :  This question has been much discussed by the scholars, the 
saints, and those who uncover the realities of creation. They have the say 
in this matter. Moreover, the verse is very broad and contains many levels. 
The majority of scholars said that it does not include the everlasting realm, 
while others suggested that those realms too will perish for just an instant, a 
brief interval of time, but so brieﬂy that their being annihilated and restored 
will be imperceptible. However, the absolute annihilation stated by some of 
those who uncover the realities whose ideas are extreme, is not right. For 
since  the  Most  Pure  and  Holy  Divine  Essence  is  eternal  and  everlasting, 
His attributes and names are also surely eternal and everlasting. And since 
His attributes and names are everlasting and eternal, the immortal beings in 
the realm of eternity, which are the mirrors, manifestations, impresses, and 
places of reﬂection of His attributes and names, of necessity will not vanish 
into absolute non-existence.

A couple of points have occurred to me from the effulgence of the Qur’an, 

and I shall write them here in summary:

The First: Almighty Allah is the possessor of such absolute power that 
He  can  bring  existence  into  being  and  despatch  it  to  non-existence  most 
easily, as though they were two houses in relation to His power and will. 
If He wishes He can do this in a day or in an instant. Anyway there is no 
absolute non-existence, for His knowledge is all-embracing; there is nothing 
outside the sphere of divine knowledge so that something can be cast there. 
The non-existence within the sphere of His knowledge is external non-exist-
ence and a title for something concealed but existent in divine knowledge. 
Some scholars have called the beings existent in divine knowledge “ latent 
realities. ” In which case, to go to extinction is to be temporarily divested of 

FIFTEENTH LETTER

79

external dress and to enter upon existence in divine knowledge, existence in 
meaning. That is to say, transitory, ephemeral beings leave external exist-
ence and their essences are clothed in what has the meaning of existence; 
they pass from the sphere of divine power to that of divine knowledge.

The  Second:  As  we  have  explained  in  many  of  the  Wo r d s ,  in  regard 
to  their  faces  which  look  to  themselves,  all  things  are  nothing.  They  do 
not possess existences that are of themselves independent or constant, and 
they do not possess realities that subsist of themselves. But in regard to 
their aspects that look to Almighty Allah, that is, that signify a meaning 
other than themselves, they are not nothing. For in that aspect are to be 
seen the manifestations of eternal names. That aspect is not doomed for 
non-existence, for it bears the shadow of an eternal existent. It has a real-
ity, it is constant, and it is elevated. For it is a sort of constant shadow of 
the eternal name which it manifests.

Furthermore, j i h g f    is  a  sword  to  cut  man’s  attach-
ment to things other than Allah. It looks to the transitory things of this ﬂeet-
ing  world  in  order  to  sever  attachment  to  them,  if  it  is  not  for  Almighty 
Allah’s  sake.  That  is  to  say,  if  man’s  attachment  is  for  Allah’s  sake  and 
on account of the face that looks to Him, and for Him, he cannot embrace 
what is other than Him so that his head should be cut off with the sword of 

j i h g f

In Short: If a person looks at things for Allah, if a person ﬁnds Allah, 
nothing will be other than Him so that his head should be severed. But if 
he does not ﬁnd Allah and does not look on his account, everything will be 
other than Him. A person has to use the sword of j i h g f  he 
has to rend the veil so that he can ﬁnd Him.

This letter manifested the meaning of the verse, ( 20:44 ) { z y x 
and was not written vehemently. It is the answer to a question asked 
me explicitly and implicitly by many people.

[ To reply is not agreeable to me and I do not want to, for I have bound 
everything to reliance on Allah. But since I have not been left in peace 
to  myself  in  my  own  world  and  since  they  have  turned  my  attention 
towards the world, I am compelled to propound ﬁve points in the lan-
guage of the Old Said in order to explain the reality of the situation both 
to my friends, and to the worldly,  1 and to those in authority, so as to 
save not myself, but my friends and my Wo r d s , from the suspicions and 
ill-treatment of the worldly. ]

FIRST POINT

ing to do with them? ”

I am asked: “ Why have you withdrawn from politics and now have noth-

T h e  A n s w e r :  The Old Said of nine or ten years ago was involved in pol-
itics to a degree; indeed, thinking he would serve religion and learning by 
means of politics, he was wearied for nothing. He saw that it is a danger-
ous way which is dubious and full of difﬁculties, and for me superﬂuous as 
well as forming an obstacle to the most necessary duties. It is mostly lies 
and may be exploited by foreigners without one being aware of it. Further-
more, a person who enters politics either wins or is in opposition. As for 

1.  For ‘the worldly,’ see, p. 63 fn 1.

80

SIXTEENTH LETTER

81

winning, since I am neither an ofﬁcial nor a deputy, to work in politics is 
unnecessary and nonsense for me. Politics have no need for me that I should 
meddle in them for nothing. If I join the opposition, I would do so either 
with ideas or with force. If it was with ideas there is no need for me, for 
the questions are all clear and everyone knows them as I do. To wag one’s 
chin for nothing is pointless. If I join the opposition intending to use force 
and to provoke an incident, I might commit thousands of sins to reach one 
doubtful goal. Numerous people would be struck by disaster on account of 
one. So saying that in all conscience he could not commit sins and cause 
the  innocent  to  commit  them  for  a  one  or  two  in  ten  possibility,  the  Old 
Said gave up cigarettes together with the newspapers, politics, and worldly 
conversation about politics. Decisive evidence for this is the fact that for the 
past eight years I have not read a single newspaper nor listened to one being 
read. Let someone come forward and say that I have read one or listened to 
one. Whereas eight years ago the Old Said used to read perhaps eight news-
papers every day. Furthermore, for the past ﬁve years I have been under the 
closest  scrutiny  and  surveillance.  Anyone  who  has  observed  the  slightest 
hint of political activity should say so. For someone like me who is nervous, 
fearless,  and  without  attachment,  who  considers  the  best  stratagem  to  be 
without stratagem, his ideas will not remain secret for eight days, let alone 
eight years. If he had had any appetite or desire for politics, there would have 
been no need for investigation and scrutiny, for he would have given voice 
like the ﬁring of a cannon.

SECOND POINT

Why does the New Said avoid politics with such vehemence?
T h e   A n s w e r :  He avoids it so vehemently in order to serve belief and the 
Qur’an, which is of the greatest importance, the greatest necessity and is 
most pure and most right, and so as not to sacriﬁce unnecessarily and ofﬁ-
ciously for one or two doubtful years of worldly life the work of gaining 
more than millions of years of eternal life. For he says: I am growing old 
and I do not know how much longer I shall live, so for me the most impor-
tant question should be working for eternal life. The prime means of gain-
ing eternal life and the key to everlasting happiness is belief ( ī m ā n  ), so I 
have to work for that. But since I am obliged by the Shari‘a to serve people 
in respect of learning so that they may proﬁt too, I want to perform that 
duty.  However,  such  service  will  either  concern  social  and  worldly  life, 
which I cannot do, and also in stormy times it is not possible to perform 

82

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

such service soundly. I therefore gave up that side of it and chose the side 
of serving belief, which is the most important, the most necessary, and the 
soundest. I leave that door open so that the truths of belief I have gained 
for myself and the spiritual remedies I have myself experienced may be 
acquired by others. Perhaps Almighty Allah will accept this service and 
make it atonement for my former sins. Apart from Satan the Accursed, no 
one, be it a believer or an unbeliever, one of the veracious or an atheist, has 
the right to oppose this work. For unbelief resembles nothing else. In tyr-
annizing, vice, and grievous sins there may be an inauspicious diabolical 
pleasure, but in unbelief there is no sort of pleasure at all. It is pain upon 
pain, darkness upon darkness, torment upon torment.

Just  how  contrary  to  reason  it  would  be  for  someone  like  me  who  is 
unattached, alone, and compelled to atone for his former sins to leave aside 
working for an endless eternal life and serving a sacred light like belief, and 
to cast himself in old age into the unnecessary, perilous games of politics – 
just how contrary to wisdom, just what a lunacy it would be even lunatics 
would understand!

But if you ask why service of the Qur’an and belief prohibit me, I would 
say this: the truths of belief and the Qur’an are each like diamonds. If I were 
polluted  by  politics,  the  ordinary  people  who  are  easily  deceived,  would 
wonder about those diamonds I was holding: “ Aren’t they for political prop-
aganda, to attract more supporters? ” They might regard the diamonds as bits 
of common glass. Then, by being involved with politics I would be wrong-
ing the diamonds by as though reducing their value. O you whose view is 
restricted to this world! Why do you struggle against me? Why do you not 
leave me to myself?

If you say: The shaikhs sometimes interfere in our business, and they 

sometimes call you a shaikh.

I reply: Good sirs! I am not a shaikh, I am a h o j a  ( teacher ). The evidence 
is this: I have been here four years and if I had taught a single person the Suﬁ 
way, you would have had the right to be suspicious. But I have told everyone 
who has come to me: Belief is necessary, Islam is necessary; this is not the 
age of Suﬁsm.

If you say: They call you Said-i Kurdi; perhaps you have some national-

ist ideas and that doesn’t suit our interests.

I would reply: Sirs! The things the Old Said and the New Said have writ-

ten are clear. I cite as testimony the certain statement,

alism and racialism to be fatal poisons, since they are a variety of European 
disease. And Europe has infected Islam with it thinking it would cause divi-
sion, and Islam would break up and be easily swallowed. My students and 
those people who have had anything to do with me know that for years I 
have  tried  to  treat  that  disease.  Since  it  is  thus,  good  sirs,  why  you  make 
every incident a pretext to harass me? According to what principle do you 
cause  me  distress  at  every  worldly  incident,  which  is  like  punishing  and 
inﬂicting trouble on a soldier in the West because of a mistake made by a 
soldier  in  the  East  because  they  both  belong  to  the  army,  or  convicting  a 
shopkeeper  in  Baghdad  because  of  a  crime  committed  by  a  tradesman  in 
Istanbul due to their being in the same line of business? Who could do this 
in all conscience? What advantage is there that could require it?

THIRD POINT

My  friends  who  wonder  how  I  am  and  are  astonished  at  my  meeting 
in patience every calamity, silently ask the following question: “ How can 
you endure the difﬁculties you’re faced with, when formerly you were very 
proud and angry and could not endure even the least insult? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  Listen to two short stories about two incidents and you will 

receive your answer:

The First Story: Two years ago an ofﬁcial spoke insultingly and con-
temptuously about me behind my back. They told me about it later. A vein 
of temperament remaining from the Old Said made me feel upset about it for 
about an hour. Then through Almighty Allah’s mercy the following occurred 
to me; it dispelled the distress and made me forgive the man. It was this:

I addressed my soul saying: if his insults and the faults he described con-
cerned my person, may Allah be pleased with him, because he recalled the 
faults of my soul. If he spoke the truth, he prompted me to train my soul 
and  helped  to  save  me  from  arrogance.  If  he  spoke  falsely,  he  helped  to 
save me from hypocrisy and undeserved fame, the source of hypocrisy. No, 
I am not reconciled with my soul, for I have not trained it. If someone tells 
me there is a scorpion on my neck or breast or else points it out to me, I 
should be grateful to him, not offended. If the man’s insults were directed 
at my belief and my being a servant of the Qur’an, it does not concern me.

I refer him to the Qur’an’s Owner, who employs me. He is mighty, He is 
wise. And if it was merely to curse at me, insult me, and blacken my charac-
ter, that does not concern me either. For I am an exile, a prisoner, a stranger, 
and  my  hands  are  tied;  it  does  not  fall  to  me  to  try  to  restore  my  honour 
myself.  To  do  so  is  the  business  of  the  authorities  of  this  village  where  I 
am a guest and under surveillance, then of the district, then of the province. 
Insulting a person’s prisoner concerns the person; he defends the prisoner. 
Since that was the reality of the matter, my heart became easy. I declared:  
( 40:44 )  ` _ ^ ] \ [ Z Y X I thought of the incident 
as not having happened. But unfortunately it was later understood that the 
Qur’an had not forgiven the man.

The  Second  Story:  This  year  I  heard  that  an  incident  had  occurred. 
Although  I  only  heard  a  brief  account  of  it  after  it  had  happened,  I  was 
treated as though I had been closely connected with it. Anyway I hardly cor-
respond with anyone, and if I do, I only write extremely rarely to a friend 
concerning  some  question  of  belief.  In  fact  I  have  written  only  one  letter 
to my brother in four years. Both I prevent myself from mixing with oth-
ers, and the worldly prevent me. I have only been able to meet with one or 
two close friends once or twice a week. As for visitors to the village, once 
or twice a month perhaps one or two used to meet with me for one or two 
minutes concerning some matter to do with the hereafter. In exile, a stranger, 
alone, with no one, I was barred from everything, from everyone, in a vil-
lage that was unsuitable for someone like me to work for a livelihood. As a 
matter of fact, four years ago I repaired a tumble-down mosque. Although 
with the certiﬁcate I had from my own region to act an i m a m  and preacher, I 
acted as i m a m  in the mosque for four years ( May Allah accept it ), this past 
Ramadan I could not go there. Sometimes I performed the ﬁve daily prayers 
alone. I was deprived of the twenty-ﬁvefold merit of performing the prayers 
in congregation.

I  showed  the  same  patience  and  forbearance  in  the  face  of  these  two 
incidents that befell me as I did in the face of that ofﬁcial’s treatment two 
years ago. Allah willing I shall continue to do so. I think like this, and say: if 
this ill-treatment, distress, and oppression inﬂicted on me by the worldly is 
for my faulty soul, I forgive it. Perhaps my soul will be reformed by means 
of it, and perhaps it will be atonement for its sins. I have experienced many 
good things in this guesthouse of the world; if I experience a little of its tri-
als, I shall still offer thanks. But if the worldly oppress me because of my 

SIXTEENTH LETTER

service of belief and the Qur’an, it is not up to me to defend it. I refer it to 
the Mighty and Compelling One. If their intention is to destroy the regard in 
which I am held generally, to expunge my undeserved fame, which is base-
less and causes hypocrisy and destroys sincerity, may Allah bless them! For 
to be held in high regard by people generally and gain a name among them 
is harmful for people like me. Those who have dealings with me know that 
I do not want respect to be shown to me, indeed, I can’t abide it. I have even 
scolded a valuable friend of mine perhaps ﬁfty times for show-
ing me excessive respect. If their intention in slandering me, belittling me in 
the eyes of the people, and defaming me is aimed at the truths of belief and 
the Qur’an of which I am the interpreter, it is pointless. For a veil cannot be 
drawn over the stars of the Qur’an. A person who closes his eyes only him-
self does not see; he does not make it night for anyone else.

FOURTH POINT

First Suspicious Question

The answer to a number of suspicious questions:
T h e   F i r s t :  The worldly say to me: “ How do you live? What do you live 
on  since  you  do  not  work?  We  don’t  want  people  in  our  country  who  sit 
around idly and live off the labour of others. ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  I live through frugality and the resulting plenty. I am not 
obliged to anyone other than the One who Provides for me and I have taken 
the decision not to become indebted to anyone else. Yes, someone who lives 
on a hundred p a r a , or even forty p a r a , does not become indebted to anyone. 
I do not want to explain this matter. To do so is most disagreeable to me, as 
it may make me feel a sort of pride or egotism. But since the worldly ask 
about  it  suspiciously,  I  reply  as  follows:  since  my  childhood,  throughout 
my  life,  it  has  been  one  of  my  guiding  principles  not  to  accept  anything 
from people, even z a k a t , and not to accept a salary – only I was compelled 
to accept one for one or two years in the Darü’l-Hikmeti’l-İslamiye on the 
insistence of my friends – and not to become obliged to people for a worldly 
livelihood. The people of my native region and those who have known me in 
other places know this. During these ﬁve years of exile, many friends have 
tried earnestly to make me accept their gifts, but I have accepted none of 
them. And so, if it is asked me, “ So how do you manage to live? ”, I reply: 
“ I live through divine bestowal and blessings. ” For sure, my soul deserves 
every  sort  of  insult  and  contempt,  but  the  plenty  and  blessings,  a  divine 
bestowal, I receive as sustenance are a wonder resulting from service of the 
Qur’an. In accordance with the verse,  s r q p ( 93:11 )  I shall cite 

86

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

the bounties Almighty Allah has bestowed on me, and give a few examples 
by way of thanks. To do so is thanks, but I am still frightened that it will 
induce hypocrisy and pride, and that blessed plenty will be cut. For to make 
known a secret divine gift of plenty causes it to cease. But what can I do? I 
have to describe them.

The First: This six months one bushel ( k i l e  ) 1 of wheat, consisting of 
thirty-six loaves of bread, has sufﬁced me. There is still some left, it is not 
ﬁnished. How much longer 2 it will last, I do not know. 

The Second: This blessed month of Ramadan I was given food by only 
two houses, and both of them made me ill. I understood that I am prohib-
ited from eating other people’s food. The rest of the time, in the whole of 
Ramadan, three loaves of bread and one o k k a  3 of rice were enough for me, 
as was witnessed and told by Abdullah Çavuş, the owner of a blessed house 
and a loyal friend who saw my economizing. In fact, the rice was ﬁnished 
two weeks after the end of Ramadan. 

The Third: For three months on the mountain one k ı y y e  4 of butter was 
enough for me and my guests, eating it every day together with bread. On 
one occasion even I had a blessed visitor called Süleyman. Both his bread 
and my bread were about to be ﬁnished. It was Wednesday. I told him to go 
and get some more. For two hours’ distance on every side of us there was 
no one from whom he could have got any. He said that he wanted to stay 
with me on the mountain on Thursday night so that we could pray together. 

ّ(cid:195)ا ىَ(cid:171)َ(cid:150)  ُتْ(cid:171) َ

ﯯﯦَوَ(cid:98) and told him to stay. Later, although it had no 
I declared: ِ
connection with this and there was no reason for it, we both began walk-
ing till we reached the top of the mountain. There was a little water in the 
ewer, and we had a small piece of sugar and some tea. I told him: “ Brother! 
Make some tea! ” He set about making it and I sat down under a cedar-tree 
overlooking  a  deep  ravine.  I  thought  regretfully  to  myself:  we  have  a  bit 
of mouldy bread which will only just be enough for us this evening. What 
shall we do for two days and what shall I say to this ingenuous man? While 
thinking  this,  I  suddenly  turned  my  head  involuntarily  and  I  saw  a  huge 
loaf  of  bread  on  the  cedar-tree  in  among  the  branches;  it  was  facing  us. 
I exclaimed: “ Süleyman! Good news! Almighty Allah has sent us food. ” 
We took the bread, and looking at it saw that no bird or wild animal had 

1.  1 kile = 36.5 lbs. ( Tr. )
2.  It lasted a year.
3.  About 2.8 lbs. or 1,300 grammes. ( Tr. )
4.  About 2.8 lbs. ( Tr. )

ٰ
SIXTEENTH LETTER

touched it. And for twenty or thirty days no one at all had climbed to the top 
of that mountain. The bread was sufﬁcient for us for the two days. While we 
were eating and it was about to be ﬁnished, righteous Süleyman who had 
been the most loyal of loyal friends for four years, suddenly appeared from 
below with more bread.

The Fourth: I bought this sack coat I’m wearing seven years ago second-
hand. In ﬁve years I have spent only four and a half liras on clothes, under-
wear, slippers, and stockings. Frugality and divine mercy and the resulting 
plenty have sufﬁced me.

There are many other things like these examples and numerous sorts of 
divine blessings. The people of this village know most of them. But do not 
suppose I am mentioning them out of pride, I have been forced to, rather. 
And do not think they were due to my goodness. These instances of plenty 
were either bestowal to the sincere friends who have visited me, or a bestowal 
on account of service of the Qur’an, or an abundance and beneﬁt resulting 
from frugality, or they have been sustenance for the four cats I have which 
recite the divine names “ O Most Compassionate One! O Most Compassion-
ate One! ”, which comes in the form of plenty and from which I beneﬁt too.
Yes, if you listen carefully to their mournful miaowings, you will under-
stand that they are saying, “ O Most Compassionate One! O Most Compas-
sionate  One! ”  We  have  arrived  at  the  subject  of  cats  and  it  has  recalled 
the hen. I have a hen. This winter every day almost without exception she 
brought me an egg from the treasury of mercy. Then one day she brought 
me two eggs and I was astonished. I asked my friends “ How can this be? ” 
They replied: “ Perhaps it is a divine gift. ” The hen also has a young chick 
she hatched in the summer. It started to lay at the beginning of Ramadan and 
continued for forty days. Neither I nor those who assist me have any doubt 
that, both its being a pullet, and the season being winter, and Ramadan, this 
blessed situation was a divine gift and bestowal. And whenever the mother 
stopped laying, it immediately started, never leaving me without eggs.

Second Suspicious Question

S e c o n d   S u s p i c i o u s   Q u e s t i o n :  The worldly ask: How can we be sure you 
won’t meddle in our world? If we set you free, you may interfere in it. Also, 
how do we know that you aren’t being cunning? How do we know that it 
isn’t a stratagem, pretending to have abandoned the world and taking things 
from the people not openly, but secretly?

T h e   A n s w e r :  My attitude in the Court Martial and in the period before 
the  proclamation  of  the  Constitution,  which  are  known  by  many,  and  my 
defence  in  the  Court  Martial  at  that  time  called  T h e   Te s t i m o n i a l   o f   Tw o  

88

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

S c h o o l s   o f   M i s f o r t u n e , show decisively that the life I lived was such that I 
would not resort to the tiniest wiles, let alone cunning and subterfuge. If I 
had resorted to trickery this last ﬁve years, I would have made application to 
you in sycophantic manner. A wily man tries to ingratiate himself. He does 
not hold back; he always tries to deceive and hoodwink. Whereas I have not 
condescended to respond to the severest attacks and criticisms levelled at 
me. Saying, “ I place my trust in Allah, ” I turned my back on the worldly. 
Moreover, if he is sensible, a person who discovers the reality of this world 
and knows the hereafter, is not sorry; he does not turn back to the world and 
struggle with it again. After the age of ﬁfty, a person who has no connection 
with anything and is alone, will not sacriﬁce eternal life for one or two years 
of the chatter and deception of this world. If he does, he is not cunning but 
foolish and crazy. What can a crazy lunatic do so that anyone should bother 
with him? As for suspecting me of outwardly abandoning the world while 
inwardly seeking it, in accordance with the verse,

( 12:53 ) ) ( ' & % $ # "
I do not exonerate my soul, for it wants everything bad. But in this ﬂeeting 
world,  this  temporary  guesthouse,  during  old  age,  in  a  brief  life,  it  is  not 
reasonable to destroy eternal life and everlasting happiness for a little bit of 
pleasure. Since it is not proﬁtable for the reasonable and the aware, willy-
nilly my soul has had to follow my reason.

Third Suspicious Question

T h e   T h i r d   S u s p i c i o u s   Q u e s t i o n :  The worldly say: Do you like us? Do 
you  approve  of  us?  If  you  do  like  us,  why  are  you  stand-ofﬁsh  and  have 
nothing to do with us? If you don’t like us, that means you object to us and 
we crush those who object to us.

T h e   A n s w e r :  Not you, if I had loved your world, I would not have with-
drawn  from  it.  I  don’t  like  either  you  or  your  world,  but  I  don’t  interfere 
with them. For I have different goals; my heart is ﬁlled with different things, 
leaving no room for anything else. Your duty is to look to a person’s hand, 
not to his heart. For you seek your government and your public order. So 
long as his hand does not interfere, what right do you have to interfere in his 
heart and tell him, “ your heart should love us too, ” although you are in no 
way worthy of it? Yes, just as I desire the spring during this winter and long 
for it but cannot will it or make it come; so too I long for the world to be 
righted and I pray for it and I want the worldly to be reformed, but I cannot 
will these things because I do not have the power. I cannot bring them about, 
because it is neither my duty, nor do I have the capacity.

Fourth Suspicious Question

SIXTEENTH LETTER

89

F o u r t h   S u s p i c i o u s   Q u e s t i o n :  The worldly say: we have experienced so 
many calamities, we no longer have conﬁdence in anyone. How can we be 
certain that given the opportunity you won’t interfere like you want to?

T h e   A n s w e r :  The previous points should assure you. In addition, I did 
not interfere in your world while in my native region among my students 
and relatives, with those who heeded me in the midst of volatile events. So 
for someone who is alone in exile, with no one, a stranger, weak, powerless, 
turned with all his strength towards the hereafter, cut off from all social rela-
tions and communication, who has found only a few friends from far aﬁeld 
who also look to the hereafter, and who is a stranger to everyone else and 
whom everyone else regards as a stranger – for such a person to interfere in 
your fruitless, dangerous world would surely be compounded lunacy.

FIFTH POINT

First Matter

This concerns ﬁve small matters.
T h e   F i r s t :  The worldly ask me: Why don’t you practise the principles 
of our civilization, our style of life, and our manner of dressing? Does this 
mean you oppose us?

M y   R e p l y :  Sirs! What right do you have to propose to me the principles 
of your civilization? For as though casting me outside the laws of civiliza-
tion, you have wrongfully forced me to reside in a village for ﬁve years and 
prohibited me from having any social relations or communication. You left 
all the exiles in the town with their friends and relatives, then gave them the 
papers granting them an amnesty, but without reason you isolated me and 
did  not  allow  me  to  meet  with  anyone  from  my  native  region,  except  for 
one or two. That means you do not count me as a member of this nation or 
a citizen. How can you propose that I apply your civil code to myself? You 
have turned the world into a prison for me. Such things cannot be proposed 
to someone in prison. You closed the door of the world on me, so I knocked 
on the door of the hereafter and divine mercy opened it to me. How can the 
confused customs and principles of the world be dictated to someone at the 
door of the hereafter? Whenever you set me free and return me to my native 
region and restore my rights, then you can require me to conform to your 
principles.

Second Matter

S e c o n d   M a t t e r : The worldly say: “ We have an ofﬁcial department for 
instructing in the precepts of religion and truths of Islam. On what authority 
do you publish religious works? Since you are a convicted exile, you have 
no right to meddle in these matters. ”

90

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

T h e   A n s w e r :  Truth and reality cannot be restricted. How can belief and 
the Qur’an be restricted? You can restrict the principles and laws of your 
world, but the truths of belief and Qur’anic principles cannot be forced into 
the  form  of  worldly  dealings  or  be  given  an  ofﬁcial  guise  in  return  for  a 
wage. Those mysteries, which are divine gifts, those blessings, come rather 
through  a  sincere  intention  and  giving  up  the  world  and  carnal  pleasures. 
Moreover, that ofﬁcial department of yours accepted me and appointed me 
as a preacher while I was in my home region. I accepted the position, but 
rejected the salary. I have the document in my possession. With it I can act 
as an i m a m  and preacher everywhere, because my being exiled was unjust. 
Also, since the exiles have been returned, my old documents are still valid.

Secondly: I addressed the truths of belief I have written directly at my 
own soul. I do not invite everyone. Rather, those whose spirits are needy 
and hearts wounded search out and ﬁnd those Qur’anic remedies. Only, to 
secure my livelihood I had printed a treatise of mine about the resurrection 
of the dead before the new script was introduced. And the former governor, 
who was unfair to me, studied the treatise, but did nothing against it since he 
could ﬁnd nothing in it to criticize.

Third Matter

T h i r d   M a t t e r :   Some  of  my  friends  remain  apparently  aloof  from  me 
because the worldly look on me with suspicion and in order to curry favour 
with the worldly, indeed, they criticize me. But the cunning worldly attribute 
their aloofness and avoiding me not to their loyalty to the worldly but to a 
sort of hypocrisy and lack of conscience, and they look on those friends of 
mine coldly.

So I say this: O my friends of the hereafter! Don’t hold back from me as 
a servant of the Qur’an and run away. Allah willing, no harm will come to 
you from me. Suppose some calamity is visited on you or I am oppressed, 
you still cannot be saved by avoiding me. By doing that you will make your-
selves more deserving of being visited by a calamity and receiving a blow. 
And what is there, that you should have these groundless fears?

Fourth Matter

F o u r t h   M a t t e r :  I see during this time of exile that certain boastful people 
who have fallen into the swamp of politics regard me in a partisan manner, 
with rivalry, as though I were connected with the worldly movements like 
they are.

Sirs! I am in the current of belief. Before me is the current of unbelief. 
I have no connection with other currents or movements. Perhaps some of 
those who work for a wage consider themselves excused to a degree. But 
to assume a stance opposing me in rivalry in the name of patriotism for no 

SIXTEENTH LETTER

91

wage, and to harass me and oppress me, is truly a grievous error. For as was 
proved above, I have no connection at all with world politics. I have dedi-
cated all my time and my life to the truths of belief and the Qur’an. Since it is 
thus, the person who torments and harasses me in rivalry should realize that 
to do so is like harming belief in the name of atheism and unbelief.

Fifth Matter

F i f t h   M a t t e r :  Since this world is transitory, and life is short, and one’s 
essential  duties  are  many,  and  eternal  life  is  gained  here;  and  since  this 
guesthouse of the world is not without an owner, indeed, has a most wise 
and generous director, and neither good nor bad will remain without recom-
pense; and since according to the verse, 

 ( 2:286 ) ¬  «  ª  ©   ¨  § 
there is no obligation that is insupportable, and a safe way is preferable to a 
harmful one, and since friends and ranks last only till the door of the grave; 
then surely the most fortunate person is the one who does not forget the here-
after for this world, nor sacriﬁce the hereafter for this world, nor destroy the 
life of the hereafter for worldly life, nor waste his life on trivial things, but 
considers himself to be a guest and acts in accordance with the commands of 
the guesthouse’s Owner, then opens the door of the grave in conﬁdence and 
enters upon eternal happiness. 1

1.  The reason for these ‘sinces’ is this: I take no notice of the wrongs and tyranny 
perpetrated against my person and give them no importance. I say, “ They are not worth 
worrying about, ” and I do not interfere in the world.

An Addendum
to the Sixteenth Letter

Without reason the worldly became suspicious of a powerless stranger 
like myself, and imagining me to have the power of thousands, put me under 
numerous restrictions. They did not give permission for me to stay a night 
or two in Bedre, a district of Barla, or on one of the mountains of Barla. I 
heard that they say: “ Said possesses the power of ﬁfty thousand soldiers, so 
we can’t set him free. ”

So  I  say:  You  unhappy  people  whose  view  is  restricted  to  this  world! 
How is it that you do not know the matters of the world, despite working 
for it with all your strength, and govern it like lunatics? If it is my person 
you fear, one soldier even could do more than me, let alone ﬁfty thousand. 
That is, he could be posted at the door of my room and tell me: “ You can’t 
go out! ”

But  if  it  is  my  profession  and  my  being  herald  of  the  Qur’an  and  the 
moral strength of belief that you fear, then you are wrong; you should be 
aware that in that respect, I have the strength of ﬁfty million soldiers, not 
ﬁfty thousand! For through the strength of the All-Wise Qur’an, I challenge 
all Europe including your irreligious people. Through the lights of belief I 
have published I have razed the sturdy bastions they call the physical sci-
ences and nature. I have cast down lower than animals their greatest irreli-
gious philosophers. If all Europe were to gather, of which your irreligious 
people are a part, through Allah’s assistance, they could not make me recant 
a single matter of that way of mine. Allah willing, they could not defeat me!
Since the matter is thus, I do not interfere in your world, so don’t you 

interfere in my hereafter! If you do, if it will be of no avail.

SIXTEENTH LETTER

The  worldly  are  exceptionally  and  excessively  suspicious  of  me;  quite 
simply, they are frightened of me. Imagining about me non-existent things 
that even if they did exist would not constitute a political crime and could 
not be the cause of accusation, like being a shaikh, or having high rank or 
belonging to a powerful family, or being a tribal leader and inﬂuential and 
having numerous followers, or meeting with people from my native region, 
or being involved in the affairs of the world, or even entering politics or the 
opposition; imagining such things about me, they have been carried away by 
groundless fears. At a time they are discussing pardoning those in prison and 
outside, that is, those that according to them cannot be pardoned, they have 
quite simply barred me from everything. A bad and ephemeral person wrote 
the following good and enduring words:

I f   t y r a n n y   h a s   c a n n o n ,   s h o t ,   a n d   f o r t s ,
R i g h t   h a s   a n   u n t w i s t a b l e   a r m ,   a   c o n s t a n t   f a c e .

And I say:

I f   t h e   w o r l d l y   h a v e   r u l e ,   p o w e r,   a n d   s t r e n g t h ,
T h r o u g h   t h e   Q u r ’ a n ’s   e f f u l g e n c e ,   i t s   s e r v a n t
H a s   u n f a l t e r i n g   k n o w l e d g e ,   a n   u n s i l e n c e a b l e   v o i c e ;
H e   h a s   a n   u n e r r i n g   h e a r t ,   a n   u n q u e n c h a b l e   l i g h t .

Many friends, as well as a military commander under whose surveillance 
I was, repeatedly asked: “ Why don’t you apply for the release papers and 
present a petition? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  I do not apply and I cannot apply for ﬁve or six reasons:
The First: I did not interfere in the worldly’s world that I should have 
been convicted and so apply to them. I was convicted by divine determining; 
my faults are before it, and I apply to it.

The Second: I believe and have certain knowledge that this world is a 
swiftly changing guest house. It is not the true homeland and everywhere 
is the same. Since I will not remain permanently in my home region, it is 
pointless to struggle for it; it is not worth going there. Since everywhere is a 
guesthouse, if the mercy of the guesthouse’s Owner befriends one, everyone 
is a friend and everywhere is familiar. Whereas if it does not befriend one, 
everywhere is a load on the heart and everyone is hostile.

The Third: Application should be within the framework of the law, but 
the way I have been treated these six years has been arbitrary and outside the 
law. The Exiles’ Law was not applied to me. They looked on me as being 

94

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

stripped of all the rights of civilization and even of all worldly rights. It is 
meaningless to apply in the name of the law to those whose treatment of me 
has been thus outside the law.

The Fourth: This year, the local ofﬁcial applied in my name for me to 
stay for a few days in the village of Bedre, which is a sort of district of Barla, 
for a change of air. How can those who reject such an unimportant request 
be applied to? To apply to them would be a futile, degrading abasement.

The Fifth: To claim a right before those who claim a wrong to be right, 
and to apply to them, is a wrong. It is disrespectful towards right. I do not 
want to perpetrate such a wrong and show disrespect for right. And that’s 
that!

The Sixth: The distress and difﬁculty the worldly have caused me has 
not been due to politics, because they know I do not meddle in politics but 
ﬂee  from  them.  Rather,  knowingly  or  unknowingly,  they  torment  me  on 
account of aggressive atheism because I adhere to religion. In which case, to 
apply to them infers regretting religion and ﬂattering the cause of aggressive 
atheism.

Moreover, divine determining, which is just, would punish me through 
their tyrannical hand if I applied to them and had recourse to them, for they 
oppress me because I am religious. As for divine determining, from time to 
time it represses me due to my hypocrisy before the worldly, because I am 
deﬁcient in religion and in sincerity. Since this is so, for the time being I can-
not be saved from this distress. If I apply to the worldly, divine determining 
would say: “ Hypocrite! Pay the penalty for applying! ” And if I do not apply, 
the worldly say: “ You don’t recognize us, go on suffering difﬁculties! ”

The Seventh Reason: It is well-known that the ofﬁcial’s duty is to allow 
harmful individuals no opportunity to cause harm and to assist those who are 
beneﬁcial. Whereas the ofﬁcial who took me into custody approached me, 
an elderly guest at the door of the grave, when I was expounding a subtle 
َ(cid:202) as though I were perpetrat-
aspect of belief contained in the phrase ُ
ing some misdemeanour, although he had not been to me for a long time pre-
viously. He caused the sincere unfortunate who was listening to be deprived 
of the instruction, and made me angry. But there were other people there, 
and he gave them no importance. Then when they acted discourteously in a 
way that would poison the life of the village, he started to be gracious and 
appreciative towards them.

SIXTEENTH LETTER

Furthermore, it is well-known that someone in prison who has committed 
a hundred crimes can meet with the ofﬁcial supervising him whether he be 
of high rank or low. But during this last year, although two people important 
in the eyes of the national government who were charged with supervising 
me  have  passed  by  my  house  several  times,  they  have  absolutely  neither 
met with me nor asked after me. At ﬁrst I supposed that they avoided me 
out of enmity, then it transpired that it was due to their fearful suspicions; 
they were ﬂeeing from me as though as I were going to gobble them up. So 
to recognize a government whose members and ofﬁcials are like them and 
have recourse to it and apply to it, is not sensible but a futile abasement. If it 
had been the Old Said, he would have said like ‘Antara:

T h e   v e r y   w a t e r   o f   l i f e   b e c o m e s   H e l l   t h r o u g h   a b a s e m e n t ,
W h e r e a s   H e l l   w i t h   d i g n i t y   b e c o m e s   a   p l a c e   o f   p r i d e . 1

The Old Said no longer exists and the New Said considers it meaningless to 
talk with the worldly. Let their world be the end of them! They can do what 
they like. He is silent, saying, we shall be judged together with them at the 
Last Judgement.

The Eighth Reason for my not applying: According to the rule, “ The 
result of illicit love is merciless torment, ” divine determining, which is just, 
torments me through the tyrannous hand of the worldly, because I incline 
towards them and they are not worthy of it. So saying, “ I deserve this tor-
ment, ”  I  remain  silent.  For  in  the  Great  War  I  fought  as  the  commander 
of  a  volunteer  regiment.  Applauded  by  the  Commander-in-Chief  of  the 
army and Enver Paşa, I sacriﬁced my valuable students and friends. I was 
wounded  and  taken prisoner. Returning from captivity, I cast myself into 
danger through such works as  T h e   S e v e n   S t e p s , aiming them at the heads 
of the British, who had occupied Istanbul. I assisted those who now hold 
me without reason in this torturous captivity. As for them, they punish me 
in this way for that help. Those friends here cause me in three months the 
hardship and distress I suffered in three years as a prisoner-of-war in Rus-
sia.  Nor  did  the  Russians  prevent  me  from  giving  religious  instruction, 
although  they  regarded  me  as  a  Kurdish  militia  commander,  a  cruel  man 
who  had  slaughtered  Cossacks  and  prisoners.  I  used  to  instruct  the  great 
majority of my ninety fellow-ofﬁcer prisoners. One time, the Russian com-
mander came and listened. Because he did not know Turkish, he thought it 
was political instruction and put a stop to it. Then later he gave permission.

Also, in the same barracks we made a room into a mosque and I used to 
lead  the  prayers.  They  did  not  interfere  at  all.  They  did  not  prevent  me 
from mixing, or from communicating, with the others. Whereas my friends 
here, my fellow citizens and co-religionists and those for whose beneﬁts 
in the form of religious belief I have struggled, have held me in distress-
ing captivity not for three years but for six, for absolutely no reason and 
although they know I have severed all my relations with the world. They 
have prevented me mixing with others. They have prevented me from giv-
ing  religious  instruction  despite  my  having  a  certiﬁcate,  and  even  from 
giving private instruction in my room. They have prevented me from com-
municating with others. They have even barred me from the mosque which 
I repaired and where I acted as prayer-leader for four years, although I had 
the necessary certiﬁcate. And now, to deprive me of the merit of perform-
ing  the  prayers  in  congregation,  they  do  not  accept  me  as  prayer-leader 
even for three private individuals, my permanent congregation and broth-
ers of the hereafter.

Furthermore, if, although I do not want it, someone is to call me good, 
the ofﬁcial who holds me in surveillance is jealous and angry. Thinking he 
will destroy my inﬂuence, he entirely unscrupulously takes precautions and 
pesters me in order to curry favour with his superiors.

Who can someone in such a position have recourse to anyone other than 
Allah Almighty? If the judge is also the claimant, of course he cannot com-
plain to him. Come on, you say, what can we say to this? You say what you 
like, I say this: there are many dissemblers among these friends of mine. A 
dissembler is worse than an unbeliever. That is the reason they make me suf-
fer what the inﬁdel Russian did not make me suffer.

You unfortunates! What have I done to you and what I am doing? I am 
trying to save your belief and am serving your eternal happiness! It means 
that my service is not sincere and purely for Allah’s sake so that it has the 
reverse effect. In return, you torment me at every opportunity. For sure, we 
shall meet at the Last Judgement. I say:

A Letter of Condolence
On the Death of a Child

ِ(cid:195) ُمْ(cid:167)ُ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا being resigned

May Almighty Allah grant you all patience, and may He make the deceased 
a helper and intercessor for you in the hereafter. I shall explain ﬁve points 
which are truly good news and offer real consolation for you, and for pious 
believers like you:

F i r s t   P o i n t :  The meaning of the phrase, ( 56:17 ) $ # in the All-
Wise  Qur’an  is  this:  with  this  phrase,  the  verse  indicates  and  gives  the 
good  news  that  the  children  of  believers  who  die  before  reaching  matu-
rity will remain perpetually as eternal, lovable children in a form worthy 
of  Paradise;  that  they  will  be  an  everlasting  source  of  happiness  in  the 
embrace of their fathers and mothers who go to Paradise; and will ensure 
that  their  parents  receive  the  sweetest  of  pleasures,  the  loving  and  car-
ressing of children; and that all pleasurable things will be found in Para-
dise; that those who say that since Paradise is not the place for reproduc-
tion  there  will  be  no  loving  and  carressing  of  children,  are  not  correct; 

97

ٰ

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

and that gaining millions of years of pure, painfree loving and caressing of 
eternal children instead of a brief ten years or so of loving them mixed with 
the sorrows of this world, is a source of great happiness for believers.

S e c o n d   P o i n t :  One time when a man was in prison they sent one of his 
lovable children to him. The unhappy prisoner suffered both his own sor-
rows, and since he could not make the child happy, he also suffered at his 
pain. Then the compassionate judge sent someone to him with a message 
which said: “ For sure the child is yours, but he is my subject and one of 
my people. I shall take him to a ﬁne palace and look after him there. ” The 
man wept in anguish. He said: “ I won’t give you my child, he is my one 
comfort! ” His friends said to him: “ Your grief is meaningless. If it is the 
child you pity, he will go to a spacious, happy palace in place of this dirty, 
distressing  dungeon.  If  you  are  sorry  for  yourself  and  seeking  your  own 
interests,  you  will  suffer  much  distress  and  pain  at  the  child’s  difﬁculties 
if he remains here, in addition to the single dubious, temporary beneﬁt you 
receive. If he goes there, it will be of manifold advantage for you, for he will 
attract the king’s mercy and will be an intercessor for you. The king will 
want you to see him, and he is sure not to send him to the prison, so he will 
release you, summon you to the palace, and allow you to meet with the child 
there. But on condition you have conﬁdence in the king and you obey him! ”
My  dear  brother,  like  this  comparison,  you  must  think  as  follows,  as 
should other believers if their children die: the child was innocent and his 
Creator is All-Compassionate and All-Generous. He has taken him to His 
perfect grace and mercy in place of my deﬁcient upbringing and compas-
sion.  He  has  released  him  from  the  grievous,  calamitous,  difﬁcult  prison 
of this world and sent him to the gardens of Paradise. How happy for the 
child! If he had stayed in this world, who knows how he would have grown 
up. Therefore, I do not pity him, I know him to be fortunate. There remains 
my own beneﬁts, and I don’t pity myself in connection with them, and I am 
not sad and sorry. For if he had remained in the world, he would have had 
ten years of a child’s temporary love mixed with pains. Then if he had been 
righteous and if he had been capable in worldly matters, perhaps he would 
have helped me. But by dying, he has become a sort of intercessor who will 
win me ten million years of a child’s love in eternal Paradise and everlasting 
happiness. Certainly, a person who loses a doubtful, immediate beneﬁt and 
gains a thousand certain, postponed beneﬁts does not weep and lament, nor 
cry out in despair.

T h i r d   P o i n t :  The child who died was the creature, possession, servant, 
and with all his members the artefact of the Most Compassionate Creator; 

SEVENTEENTH LETTER

99

he belonged to Him and was a friend of his parents, put temporarily under 
their supervision. The Creator made the parents the child’s servants. In return 
for their services, He gave them pleasurable compassion as an immediate 
wage. Now, if as the requirement of mercy and wisdom, the Compassionate 
Creator, who owns nine hundred and ninety-nine shares of the child out of a 
thousand, takes the child from you and puts an end to your service, to cry out 
in grief and despair due to that apparent single share in the face of the true 
owner of the thousand shares in a way that infers complaint, does not beﬁt a 
believer; it beﬁts rather the people of neglect and misguidance.

F o u r t h   P o i n t :   If  the  world  had  been  eternal,  and  man  was  to  have 
remained in it eternally, and separation had been unending; grievous sorrow 
and despairing woe would have had some meaning. But since this world is 
a guesthouse, wherever the dead child has gone, you, and we too, shall go 
there. Moreover, he is not the only one to die; it is a general highway. And, 
since separation is not for ever, you will meet with him in the future, both in 
ِ(cid:195) ُمﯰﯧُ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا . 
the Intermediate Realm and in the hereafter. One should say: ِ
“ He gave him and He took him away; ” and: “ All praise be to Allah for all 
circumstances, ” and offer thanks in patience.

F i f t h   P o i n t :  Compassion, one of the most subtle, beautiful, agreeable, 
and sweet manifestations of divine mercy, is a luminous elixir. It is much 
more direct than passionate love; it is a swift means of union with Almighty 
Allah.  Temporary  love  and  worldly  love  are  transformed  into  true  love 
and ﬁnd Almighty Allah only with the greatest difﬁculty, but compassion 
binds the heart to Him in purer, more direct fashion – and without difﬁculty. 
Both father and mother love their child more than all the world. If they are 
fortunate and are true believers, when he is taken from them it turns their 
faces from this world and they ﬁnd the True Bestower of Bounties. They 
say: “ The world is transitory and not worth binding one’s heart to. ” They 
become attached to where the child has gone, and this gains high spiritual 
rank for them.

The  people  of  neglect  and  misguidance  are  deprived  of  the  happiness 
and good news of these ﬁve points. You can see from the following how 
grievous their situation is: they see their only child in the throes of death, 
and because they imagine the world is eternal and as a result of their heed-
lessness and misguidance, they suppose death is non-existence and eternal 
separation. They think of him in the earth of his grave in place of his soft

bed,  and  due  to  their  heedlessness  or  misguidance,  the  merciful  Paradise 
and  bounteous  heaven  of  the  Most  Compassionate  of  the  Compassionate 
does not occur to them. You can see by comparison the despairing sorrow 
and grief they suffer. Whereas belief and Islam say to the believer: the Most 
Compassionate Creator will take this child of yours who is in the throes of 
death from this lowly world to Paradise. He will make him both an interces-
sor for you, and an eternal child. Don’t worry, separation is temporary! Say:

[ This letter consists of three important matters. ]

FIRST IMPORTANT MATTER

Famous saints like Muhyi’l-Din al-‘Arabi ( May his mystery be sanc-
tiﬁed ),  the  author  of  a l - F u t u h a t   a l - M a k k i y a ,  and  Sayyid  ‘Abd  al-Karim 
( May his mystery be sanctiﬁed ), the author of a well-known book entitled 
a l - I n s a n   a l - K a m i l ,  1  speak  of  the  seven  levels  of  the  globe  of  the  earth 
and  the  white  earth  beyond  the  Kaf  mountain,  and  strange  things  which 
in  Futuhat  are  called  “ m a s h m a s h i y a . ”  Are  these  true?  But  these  places 
do  not  exist  on  the  earth.  Furthermore,  the  things  that  they  say  are  not 
accepted by geography and science. And if they are not true, how can they 
be saints? How can people who say things contrary to reality and the truth 
in this way be people of reality?

T h e   A n s w e r :  They were the people of truth and reality. They were also 
saints and experienced direct vision of the realities. They saw correctly what 
they saw, but since they were not correct in declarations they made while in 
the state of illumination and witnessing, which is without comprehension, 
and  in  their  interpretations  of  their  visions,  which  were  like  dreams,  they 
were partially incorrect. People of unveiling and direct vision of that sort 
cannot interpret their own visions while in such a state, just as a person can-
not interpret his own dream while dreaming it. Those who can interpret them 
are  the  exact  scholars  of  the  legacy  of  prophethood,  called  “ the  puriﬁed 
ones. ” For sure, when they rise to the rank of the puriﬁed ones, the people 
of direct vision belonging to that group understand their errors through the

102

guidance of the Qur’an and the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices, and they cor-
rect them; and they did correct them.

Listen to this story which is the form of a comparison and will illustrate 

this truth. It is like this:

One time, there were two shepherds who were from among those who 
approach reality with their hearts. They milked their sheep into a wooden 
pail and put the pail beside them. They laid their shepherd’s pipe on the pail, 
then one of them stretched out, overcome by sleep. He slept for a while. The 
other shepherd was watching him carefully when he saw something like a 
ﬂy emerge from the sleeping man’s nose, look at the pail of milk, enter the 
pipe at one end, emerge from the other, then disappear into a hole under a 
bush. Some while later the thing emerged again, passed down the shepherd’s 
pipe, entered the sleeping man’s nose, whereupon he awoke. He exclaimed: 
“ I had an extraordinary dream! ” His friend replied: “ May Allah make good 
come of it. What was it? ” The other man said: “ I saw a sea of milk stretch-
ing over which was a strange bridge. The upper part of the bridge was closed 
and contained windows. I passed through the bridge. I saw a grove of oaks, 
the tops of which were all pointed. Beneath them was a cave; I entered it, and 
I saw some treasure full of gold. How can this be interpreted, I wonder? ”

His alert friend said to him: “ The sea of milk you saw was this wooden 
pail, and the bridge, our shepherd’s pipe. The pointed oak trees were this 
bush, while the cave was this small hole. Get the pickaxe and I’ll show you 
the treasure. ” He brought the pick and they dug under the bush, and there 
they found gold enough to make them both prosperous in this world.

Thus, what the sleeping man dreamt was right, and what he saw, correct, 
but because he had no comprehension while dreaming and no right to inter-
pret the dream, he could not distinguish between the physical world and the 
non-material world and his assertions were partially wrong; he said: “ I saw 
an actual physical sea. ” But since the man who was awake could distinguish 
between the physical world and the World of Similitudes, he had the right 
to interpret the dream; he said: “ What you saw in the dream was right, but 
it wasn’t an actual sea; our milk pail appeared to your imagination as a sea, 
and our pipe as a bridge, and so on. ” This means the physical and spiritual 
worlds  have  to  be  distinguished  from  one  another.  If  they  are  combined, 
assertions about them appear wrong. 

For example, you have a small room the four walls of which have been 
covered with four large mirrors. When you enter it, you see the small room 
to be as broad as a large arena. If you say, “ My room appears to be as large 

EIGHTEENTH LETTER

103

as a broad arena, ” what you say is correct. But if you assert, “ My room is 
as large as a broad arena, ” you would be wrong, for you are confusing the 
World of Similitudes with the actual world.

Thus,  having  failed  to  weigh  them  on  the  balances  of  the  Book  and 
Sunna,  the  descriptions  of  the  seven  levels  of  the  globe  made  by  certain 
people of unveiling do not refer only to its physical state from the point of 
view of geography. For instance, they said that one of the earth’s levels is 
that inhabited by the jinns and demons, and that it has a breadth of thou-
sands of years. But those strange levels are not found on our globe, which 
makes its circuit every one or two years. However, if we suppose the globe 
to be like a pine-seed in the World of Meaning, the World of Similitudes, 
the Intermediate Realm, and the World of Spirits, the similitude of the tree 
formed from it would be like a huge pine tree in relation to the seed. Thus, in 
the course of their spiritual journeyings, some of the people of direct vision 
have observed that some of the earth’s levels in the World of Similitudes 
are extremely extensive and that they stretch over a distance of thousands 
of years. What they saw was right, but because superﬁcially the World of 
Similitudes resembles the physical world, they saw the two worlds blended 
together,  and  interpreted  them  thus.  When  they  returned  to  the  world  of 
sobriety, since they lacked balance, and since they wrote exactly what they 
witnessed, it has been thought to be contrary to reality. Like the similitudes 
of a large palace and large garden may be found in a small mirror, so simili-
tudes and non-material realities as extensive as thousands of years may be 
situated in a single year’s distance in the physical world.

Conclusion: It is understood from this matter that the degree of direct 
vision  is  far  inferior  to  that  of  belief  in  the  Unseen.  That  is  to  say,  the 
uncomprehending disclosures of some of the saints relying only on direct 
vision do not attain to the statements about the truths of faith made by the 
puriﬁed and exact scholars, who are the people of the legacy of prophet-
hood and who rely on the Qur’an and Revelation, not on direct vision – 
their statements that are about the Unseen but are lucid, comprehensive, 
and  right.  That  is  to  say,  the  balance  of  all  illuminations,  mental  states, 
visions, and unveilings are the Book and Sunna, and their touchstone are 
the sacred principles of the Book and Sunna, and the conjectural laws of 
the puriﬁed and exacting scholars.

SECOND IMPORTANT MATTER

Q u e s t i o n :  The Unity of Existence is considered by many people to be 
the  most  elevated  station,  but  there  was  no  explicit  sign  of  it  among  the 

104

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

Companions and foremost the four Rightly-Guided Caliphs, who were at the 
level of the greatest sainthood, or among the Imams of the Prophet’s Family 
and foremost the ﬁve People of the Cloak, or the great interpreters of the law 
and the generation following the Companions and foremost the founders of 
the four schools of law. So did those who lived later advance further than 
them? Did they ﬁnd a better highway on which to proceed?

T h e   A n s w e r :  Allah forbid! Nobody at all has the ability to advance fur-
ther than those puriﬁed ones who were the stars and heirs closest to the Sun 
of Prophethood; the highway is indeed theirs.

As for the Unity of Existence, it is a way and a state, but it is deﬁcient. 
However, because it is illuminating and pleasurable, most of those who have 
reached that degree on their spiritual journeyings have not wanted to leave 
it; they have remained there and supposed it to be the ultimate degree.

If the spirit of the person who takes this way is divested of materiality and 
intermediaries and he has rent the veil of causes, and is immersed in a state 
of witnessing, then an experiential – not pertaining to knowledge – unity of 
existence that arises not from the Unity of Existence but from the Unity of 
Witnessing, may obtain for him a certain attainment, a spiritual station. He 
may even reach the degree of denying the universe for Allah’s sake. But if 
he  is  submerged  in  causes  and  preoccupied  with  materiality,  for  him,  the 
Unity of Existence may mean going so far as denying Allah on account of 
the universe. 

Yes,  the  great  highway  is  the  highway  of  the  Companions,  and  those 
that  followed  them,  and  the  Puriﬁed  Ones.  Their  universal  rule  was, 
ٌةَ(cid:99)ِ(cid:92)اَ(cid:102)   ِءاَ(cid:193) ْ(cid:130)َ
ْ(cid:202)ا  ُقِ(cid:86)اَ(cid:163)َ(cid:110)  1  In  accordance  with  the  sense  of 3 2 1 
( 42:11 )  Almighty  Allah  has  absolutely  nothing  that  resembles  Him.  He  is 
utterly beyond being comprehended in place or class and being divided into 
parts.  His  relation  with  beings  is  creativity.  Beings  are  not  imaginings  or 
fancies as those who followed the way of the Unity of Existence said. Vis-
ible things too are Almighty Allah’s works. Everything is not “ Him, ” eve-
rything is “ from Him. ” For events cannot be pre-eternal. We shall make this 
matter easier to understand with two comparisons:

The First: For example, there is a king. Through his name of Just Judge 
he has a Ministry of Justice which shows the manifestation of that name. 
Another  of  his  names  is  K h a l i f a ,  and  the  Shaikh  al-Islam’s  Ofﬁce  and 

1.  ‘Umar al-Nasafī, a l - A q ā ‘ i d , 1.

EIGHTEENTH LETTER

105

learned institution are the manifestations of that name. He has also the name 
of Commander-in-Chief, through which all the ofﬁces of the army perform 
their actions; the army is the manifestation of that name. Now, if someone 
were to appear and say: “ The king is only the Just Judge, he has no ofﬁce 
or ministry other than that of justice, ” then the attributes and states of the 
religious scholars in the Shaikh al-Islam’s Ofﬁce would have to be applied 
– not actually but theoretically – to the ofﬁcials of the Ministry of Justice; a 
secondary and shadowy Shaikh al-Islam’s Ofﬁce would have an imaginary 
existence within the actual Ministry of Justice. Again in hypothetical fash-
ion, the dealings and states of the Army Ofﬁce would be ascribed to the ofﬁ-
cials of the Judiciary, an unreal Army Ofﬁce would be imagined there, and 
so on. In this situation, the king’s true name is the name of Just Judge and his 
true sovereignty is his sovereignty in the Ministry of Justice. His names like 
K h a l i f a , Commander-in-Chief, and Sultan are not actual but hypothetical. 
However, the nature of kingship and reality of sovereignty demand all the 
names in actuality. And actual names require and necessitate actual ofﬁces.
Thus,  the  sovereignty  of  divinity  necessitates  in  actuality  numer-
ous  sacred  names  like  All-Merciful,  Provider,  Bestower,  Creator,  Doer, 
Muniﬁcent,  and  Compassionate.  And  those  true  and  actual  names  require 
actual  mirrors.  Now,  since  the  followers  of  the  Unity  of  Existence  say: 
َوُ(cid:182)  َ
ّ(cid:202)ِا َدوُ(cid:106)ْوَ(cid:174)  َ(cid:202) they downgrade the reality of beings to the level of imagina-
tion. Almighty Allah’s names Necessary Existent, Existent, One, and Sin-
gle  have  true  manifestations  and  spheres  of  application.  For  sure,  if  their 
mirrors  and  spheres  of  application  were  not  real  and  were  imaginary  and 
non-existent, it would not harm them. And perhaps if there were no colour 
of existence in the mirror of true existence, they would be purer and more 
brilliant, but the manifestations of such names as Merciful, Provider, Sub-
duer, Compeller, and Creator would not be real, they would be hypothetical. 
However, those names are realities like the name of Existent, they cannot be 
shadows; they are essential, not secondary.

Thus, the Companions and great interpreters of the law and Imams of the 
Family of the Prophet said: ٌةَ(cid:99)ِ(cid:92)اَ(cid:102)  ِءاَ(cid:193) ْ(cid:130)َ
ْ(cid:202)ا ُقِ(cid:86)اَ(cid:163)َ(cid:110) Almighty Allah has a manifes-
tation through all His names in actuality. Through His creativity, all things 
have an accidental existence. For sure, in relation to the Necessarily Exist-
ent’s existence their existence is an extremely weak and unstable shadow, 
but  it  is  not  imagination,  it  is  not  fancy.  Almighty  Allah  gives  existence 
through His name Creator and He continues that existence.

Second Comparison: For example, on the four walls of this house are 
four full-length mirrors. However much the house is depicted together with 
the other three mirrors in all the mirrors, each holds the things in itself in 
accordance with its own make-up and colour; it reﬂects a similitude of the 
house that is particular to itself. Now, two men enter the house. One of them 
looks at one of the mirrors and says: “ Everything is within it. ” When he 
hears of the other mirrors and the images in them, he applies what he hears 
to a tiny corner of the one mirror whose contents are shadows twice over, 
and whose reality has shrunk and has changed. He also says: “ I see it thus, 
in which case reality is thus. ” The other man says to him, “ Yes, you see it 
like that and what you see is true. But in actuality and reality the true form 
of reality is not like that. There are other mirrors besides the one you looked 
at; they are not the shadow of shadows and as tiny as you saw. ”

Thus, each of the divine names requires a different mirror. And, since 
Merciful and Provider, for example, are real and fundamental, they require 
beings worthy of them who are needy for sustenance and compassion. Just 
as All-Merciful requires real beings with spirits needy for sustenance in a 
real world, so too, All-Compassionate requires a paradise which is thus real. 
To maintain that only the names Existent, Necessarily Existent, and Single 
One  of  Unity  are  real  and  that  the  other  names  are  mere  shadows  within 
them, is a sort of injustice towards those other names.

It is due to this mystery that the great highway is surely the highway of 
the Companions, the Puriﬁed Ones, the Imams of the Prophet’s family, and 
the great interpreters of the law and founders of the four schools of law, who 
possessed greater sainthood and were directly the ﬁrst class of the Qur’an’s 
students.

An Addendum to the Second Matter

An Addendum to the Second Matter

Q u e s t i o n :   Muhyi’l-Din  al-‘Arabi  considered  the  Unity  of  Existence  to 
be of the highest level. Likewise, some of the great saints who took the path 
of love followed him. However, you say that this matter is not of the high-
est level, and is not real; that it is rather the way, to a degree, of those who 
become intoxicated and immersed in the divine, and of the people of love 
and ecstasy. So what, brieﬂy, is the high level of the afﬁrmation of divine 
unity pointed out by the clear verses of the Qur’an, through the mystery of 
the legacy of prophethood? Can you explain it?

T h e   A n s w e r :  It is a hundred times beyond the ability of an utterly pow-
erless unfortunate like myself to judge those elevated stations with his lim-
ited thought. I shall just explain one or two extremely brief points proceed-
ing from the effulgence of the Wise Qur’an. Perhaps they will be useful in 
understanding the matter.

FIRST POINT
There are many reasons for becoming embroiled in the way of the Unity 

of Existence. One or two of them may be explained as follows:

The First Reason: Because they could not squeeze into their brains the 
maximum degree of the creativity of divine dominicality, nor entirely estab-
lish in their hearts the idea that everything, through the mystery of divine 
oneness  (   e h a d i y e t   ) ,  is  held  directly  in  the  grasp  of  dominicality  and  that 
all things have existence through divine power, choice, and will, those who 
took that way were obliged to say that everything is either Him, or does not 
have existence, or is imaginary, or is His manifestation or emanation.

The Second Reason: The mark of passionate love is to want never to 
be separated from the beloved and to ﬂee desperately from such separa-
tion; to tremble at the thought of parting, to fear distance from the beloved 
as though fearing Hell, and to abominate transience; to love union with the 
love of one’s own spirit and life, and to yearn for nearness to the beloved 
as though longing for Paradise. Thus, through adhering to a manifestation 
of divine immediacy in all things, those who took the way of the Unity of 
Existence disregarded separation and distance; supposing union and meet-
ing to be permanent, they said: “ There is no existent but He; ” through the 
intoxication of love and as demanded by the ecstasy of permanence, meet-
ing, and union, they imagined that in the Unity of Existence was a most 
pleasurable  way  of  illumination  whereby  they  could  be  saved  from  the 
dreadfulness of separation. 

108

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

That is to say, the ﬁrst reason sprang from the fact that the hand of their 
intellects was unable to reach up to some of the truths of belief, which were 
extremely broad and elevated; they were unable to comprehend them and 
had not developed completely in regard to faith. And the source of the sec-
ond reason was the extraordinary unfolding of their hearts in respect of love, 
and their wondrous expansion and breadth.

However, the supreme level of divine unity that the Puriﬁed Ones – who 
were the people of sobriety and great saints of the legacy of prophethood 
–  saw  through  the  clear  expositions  of  the  Qur’an  is  both  extremely  ele-
vated,  and  shows  both  the  maximum  level  of  dominicality  and  creativity, 
and that all the divine names are real. It preserves the Qur’an’s principles 
and does not spoil the balance of the decrees of dominicality. For they say 
that together with the oneness of His essence and His being free of space, 
with His knowledge Almighty Allah encompasses and determines directly 
all things together with all their attributes, and through His will He chooses 
and speciﬁes them, and through His power He creates them. He creates and 
directs the whole universe as though it were a single being.

He creates the huge spring with the same ease as creating a ﬂower. Noth-
ing  obstructs  anything  else.  There  is  no  fragmentation  in  His  regarding 
things. He is present everywhere at the same instant through the disposal of 
His knowledge and power. There is no division or distribution in His dis-
posal. This mystery has been expounded and proved completely in the Six-
teenth Word and in the Second Stopping-Place of the Thirty-Second Word. 
Since, according to the rule, “ Comparisons are incontestible, ” no attention 
should be paid to defects in comparisons and allegories, I shall set forth a 
very faulty comparison so that the difference between the two ways may be 
understood to a degree.

For example, let us imagine a huge, matchless, and wondrously adorned 
peacock which can ﬂy from east to west in an instant, and opens and closes 
its wings, which stretch from north to south, are adorned with hundreds of 
thousands of ﬁne patterns, and in every single feather of which are included 
brilliant arts. Now, there are two men observing it; they want to ﬂy up with 
the  wings  of  the  intellect  and  heart  to  the  elevated  qualities  of  this  bird, 
to  its  wondrous  decorations.  One  looks  at  the  peacock’s  appearance  and 
form and the marvellous inscriptions of power on all its feathers; he loves it 
with extreme passion and ardour; he in part abandons his attentive reﬂective 
thought and clings on to love. But then he sees that every day those lovable 
decorations change and are transformed. Those objects of his love, which he 
worships, disappear and are lost.

EIGHTEENTH LETTER

109

While he should have said that through true divine unity, which he could 
not encompass with his mind, and absolute dominicality and the oneness of 
the divine essence, they were the artistic decorations of an Inscriber possess-
ing universal creativity, he said instead – in order to console himself – that 
the spirit of the peacock was so sublime that its maker was within it, or that 
the peacock had become Him, and that since its spirit had become one with 
its being and its being had combined with its outward appearance, its spirit’s 
perfection and being’s exaltedness displayed those manifestations, display-
ing every moment a different inscription and beauty; it was not a true crea-
tion through its will, but a manifestation, an emanation.

As for the other man, he said that those harmonious, orderly decorations 
so full of art deﬁnitely required will, choice, intention, and purpose. It was 
impossible for there to be a manifestation without will, an emanation with-
out choice.

Yes, the peacock had a beautiful and elevated nature, but it could not be 
the doer; it was passive. It could not become one with the active agent. Its 
spirit was ﬁne and exalted, but it could not be the creator and disposer, only 
receptive and a means. For observedly in each of its feathers was an art per-
formed with inﬁnite wisdom and an inscription and decoration made through 
an inﬁnite power. And these could not occur without will and choice. The 
arts  indicating  perfect  wisdom  within  perfect  power,  and  perfect  domini-
cality and mercy within perfect wisdom were not the work of some sort of 
manifestation. The scribe who had written that gilded notebook could not 
be inside it and be united with it. The notebook rather only had contact with 
the nib of the scribe’s pen. In which case, the wondrous decorations of the 
similitude of the peacock known as the universe were a gilded missive of the 
peacock’s Creator.

Now, look at the peacock and read the missive. Say to its Scribe: “ What 
wonders Allah has willed! Blessed be Allah! Glory be to Allah! ” The person 
who supposes the missive to be the scribe, or the scribe to be inside the let-
ter, or fancies the missive to be imagination, has surely hidden his reason in 
the veils of love and is unable to see the true form of reality.

Among the varieties of passionate love, the one most conducive to the 
way of the Unity of Existence, is love of this world. When it turns into true 
love, love of this world, which is temporary ( m e c a z î  ), is transformed into 
the Unity of Existence. A person loves his personal beloved with worldly 
( m e c a z î  ) love. Then, unable to accept in his heart his beloved’s transience 
and ephemerality, he consoles himself by saying that his beloved is a mirror 
reﬂecting the beauty of the True Object of Love and Worship, and attaches 
himself to a reality, so acquiring permanence for him through true love.

110

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

In the same way, when, due to the constant blows of death and separation, 
the strange love of the person who takes the huge world and the universe in 
its totality as his beloved is transformed into true love, he seeks refuge in 
the way of the Unity of Existence, in order to save that great beloved of his 
from death and separation. If he has extremely powerful and elevated faith, 
it becomes a pleasurable, luminous, acceptable level, as with those resem-
bling Muhyi’l-Din al-‘Arabi. However, there is the possibility of falling into 
various abysses, embracing materiality, and becoming submerged in causes. 
As for the Unity of Witnessing, it is harmless; it is an exalted way of the 
people of sobriety.

THIRD MATTER

An important matter that has not been solved by philosophy and reason.
( 85:16 ) Ë Ê É   ( 55:29 ) j i h g f

Q u e s t i o n :  What is the reason for the astonishing unceasing activity in the 
universe? What is the wisdom in it? Why do these ﬂeeting beings not stop, 
but are continuously changed and renewed?

T h e   A n s w e r :   To  explain  the  wisdom  in  this  would  require  a  thousand 
pages. So we shall leave aside a full explanation and condense in two pages 
an extremely brief summary of it.

If  a  person  performs  a  natural  function  or  social  duty  enthusiastically, 
anyone who observes him carefully will certainly understand that there are 
two things that make him act in this way:

The First are the beneﬁts, fruits, and advantages resulting from the duty, 

which are called the ultimate cause.

The Second: Such things as love, desire, and pleasure cause him to per-
form the duty enthusiastically, and these are called the necessitating cause 
and reason. 

For example, eating food; the pleasurable longing arising from appetite 
drive a person to eat, and afterwards, the result of eating is nourishing the 
body and perpetuating life. In the same way, j  i  h based on two 
sorts of divine names, the awesome and astonishing endless activity in the 
universe  occurs  for  two  vast  instances  of  wisdom,  each  of  which  is  also 
inﬁnite:

EIGHTEENTH LETTER

111

T h e   F i r s t :   Almighty  Allah’s  Most  Beautiful  Names  have  incalculable 
sorts of manifestations. The variety in creatures arises from the variety of the 
manifestations. The names require to be manifested in a permanent fashion; 
that is, they want to display their embroideries; that is, they want to see and 
display the manifestations of their beauties in the mirrors of their embroi-
deries;  that  is,  they  want  every  instant  to  renew  the  book  of  the  universe 
and missives of beings; that is, they necessitate the continuous meaningful 
writing, and to display each missive to the attentive gaze of the Most Pure 
and Holy Essence, the One signiﬁed, as well as to all conscious beings; they 
require to make each of the missives read.

T h e   S e c o n d   R e a s o n   a n d   I n s t a n c e   o f   W i s d o m :   Just  as  the  activity  of 
creatures arises from appetite, desire, and pleasure, and there is a deﬁnite 
pleasure in all activity; indeed, all activity is a sort of pleasure; so too, in a 
suitable way and form appropriate to His essential self-sufﬁciency and abso-
lute riches and in a manner ﬁtting for His absolute perfection, the Necessar-
ily  Existent  One  has  boundless  sacred  compassion  and  inﬁnite  holy  love. 
And He feels a boundless sacred ardour arising from that sacred compas-
sion and holy love, and an endless holy joy arising from that sacred ardour, 
and, if one may say so, an inﬁnite sacred pleasure arising from the sacred 
joy. And pertaining to that Merciful and Compassionate One, is, if the term 
is permissible, a boundless sacred gratiﬁcation and inﬁnite holy pride aris-
ing from the boundless feeling of compassion that springs from the sacred 
pleasure, sacred gratiﬁcation and pride which arise from the gratitude and 
perfections of creatures which result from their abilities emerging from the 
potential to the actual and their developing within the activity of power. It is 
these which necessitate in boundless fashion, an endless activity.

Because philosophy, science, and natural philosophy do not know this 
subtle  instance  of  wisdom,  they  have  confused  unconscious  nature,  blind 
chance, and lifeless causes in this utterly knowing, wise, percipient activity, 
and falling into the darkness of misguidance, have been unable to ﬁnd the 
light of reality.

The Nineteenth Letter 

This  treatise  describes  more  than  three  hundred  miracles.  And  as  it 
describes the messengership of Muhammad ( UWBP ), itself a miracle, so 
is it itself a wonder in three or four respects, proceeding from the miracle of 
his messengership.

T h e   F i r s t :   Although  it  is  more  than  a  hundred  pages  in  length  and  is 
based on traditions and narrations, it was written in an unusual fashion – in 
the mountains and countryside, completely from memory, and without refer-
ring to any book. It was completed, moreover, in a few days by working two 
to three hours every day, for a total of twelve hours.

T h e   S e c o n d :   Despite  its  length,  this  work  did  not  cause  tedium  to  its 
writer, nor does it lack pleasantness for its reader. In fact, it aroused such 
ardour and enthusiasm in even my lazy scribes that in these hard and dis-
tressing times, as many as seventy copies were handwritten in this neigh-
bourhood within a single year. Those aware of this property of the treatise 
concluded  that  this  must  be  a  wonder  proceeding  from  the  miracle  of  his 
messengership ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ).

T h e   T h i r d :  In the copies handwritten by nine different scribes who did 
not communicate with one another, including one very inexperienced and 
unaware of coincidence  1 – it was also before we were aware of the phe-
nomenon – the words referring to the Noble Messenger coincided to such 
a degree throughout the whole of the treatise, and in the ﬁfth part for the 
words referring to the Qur’an, that anyone who is fair to the slightest degree 
would not consider it to be the result of chance. In fact, whoever observed it 
concluded that it was a mystery of the Unseen and a marvel proceeding from 
the miraculousness of Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ).

1.  ‘Coincidence’ ( T. t e v â f ü k ; Ar. t a w ā f u q  ) refers to the unintentional correspondence 

of letters or words in lines or patterns on one or several pages. ( Tr. )

The principles explained at the beginning of this treatise have extreme 
importance.  As  for  the  prophetic  Hadiths  related,  they  are  accepted  as 
authentic by the authorities on Hadith, and they report the most established 
phenomena concerning the messengership of Muhammad ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ). Now, to enumerate the merits of this treatise, another 
treatise of the same length would be needed; we therefore invite those who 
wish to read it, if only once.

A REMINDER: In this work, I have related many Hadiths, despite having no books to 
refer to. Should there be any errors in their wording, I request that they either be corrected, 
or be considered as paraphrases. For, according to the prevailing opinion, “ To relate the 
meanings of Hadiths is permissible,” in which case the narrator puts the meaning of the 
Hadith into his own words. This being the case, Hadiths with possible errors of wording 
should be regarded as paraphrases.

[ Since the Nineteenth and Thirty-First Wo r d s  concerning the messen-

with  decisive  evidence,  we  assign  the  veriﬁcation  of  that  side  of  the 
subject to those Wo r d s . As a supplement to them we will merely show 
here, in nineteen ‘Signs,’ some of the ﬂashes of that great truth. ]

FIRST SIGN

The  Possessor  and  Master  of  the  universe  surely  does  everything  with 
knowledge, disposes every affair with wisdom, directs everything all-see-
ingly, treats everything all-knowingly, and arranges everything willing the 
instances of wisdom, purposes, and beneﬁts that are apparent in them. Since, 
then,  the  One  who  creates  knows,  surely  the  One  who  knows  will  speak. 
Since He will speak, surely He will speak to those who possess conscious-
ness and thought, and those who will understand His speech. Since He will 
speak to those who possess thought, surely he will speak to mankind, whose 
nature and awareness are the most comprehensive of all conscious beings. 
Since He will speak to mankind, surely He will speak to the most perfect 
of mankind and those most worthy of address. Since He will speak to those 

114

NINETEENTH LETTER – SECOND SIGN

115

who  are  most  perfect,  most  worthy  of  address,  highest  in  morality,  and 
who will guide humanity; He will certainly speak to Muhammad, who, as 
friend and foe alike testify, is of the highest disposition and morality, who is 
obeyed by one ﬁfth of humanity, to whose spiritual rule half of the globe has 
submitted, with the radiance of whose light the future of mankind has been 
illumined for thirteen centuries, to whom the believers, the luminous seg-
ment of humanity, renew ﬁve times daily the oath of allegiance, for whose 
happiness they pray, for whom they call down Allah’s blessings and bear 
admiration and love in their hearts. Certainly, He will speak to Muhammad 
( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  and  indeed  He  has  done;  He  will 
make him the Prophet, and indeed He has done; He will make him the guide 
for the rest of humanity, and indeed He has done.

SECOND SIGN

Allah’s  Most  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace ) 
declared his prophethood, and presented to humanity such a decree as the 
Qur’an of Mighty Stature and such manifest miracles as number, according 
to  the  scholars,  one  thousand.  1  The  occurrence  of  those  miracles  in  their 
entirety is as certain as the fact that he declared himself prophet. In fact, as 
is shown by the words of the most obstinate unbelievers quoted in various 
places of the Wise Qur’an, even they could not deny his miracles so called 
them – Allah forbid! – sorcery, in order to satisfy themselves or to deceive 
their followers.

The miracles of Muhammad ( UWBP ) have the certainty of conﬁrma-
tion by consensus to the hundredth degree. The miracle is the conﬁrmation 
by the Creator of the cosmos of his declaration of prophethood; it has the 
effect  of  the  words,  َتْ(cid:162)َد َ(cid:134)  Suppose  that  you  said  in  the  assembly  of  a 
ruler, while being observed by him, “ The ruler has appointed me to such-
and-such a position. ” Should you be asked for a proof of your claim, the 
word “ Yes ” uttered by the ruler would be sufﬁcient to support you. Or, if 
the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your request, this would 
conﬁrm your claim even more soundly and more deﬁnitely than would the 
word “ Yes. ”

In the same way, the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ) claimed: “ I am the envoy of the Creator of the universe. My proof is 
that He will change His unbroken order at my request and my prayer. Now 
look at my ﬁngers: He causes them to run like a fountain with ﬁve spigots. 

1.  al-‘Asqalānī, F a t ḥ   a l - B ā r ī , vi, 454; Nawawī, S h a r ḥ   Ṣ a ḥ ī ḥ   M u s l i m , i, 2.

116

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

Look at the moon: by a gesture of my ﬁnger, He splits it in two. Look at 
that tree: to afﬁrm me and to bear witness to me, it moves and comes near 
to me. Look at this food: although it is barely enough for two or three 
men, it satisﬁes two or three hundred. ” He demonstrated too hundreds 
of similar miracles.

However, the evidences of this person’s veracity and the proofs of his 
prophethood  are  not  restricted  to  his  miracles.  All  his  deeds  and  acts,  his 
words  and  behaviour,  his  moral  conduct  and  manners,  his  character  and 
appearance prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness. Indeed, 
many people such as ‘Abdullah b. Salam, the famous scholar of the Children 
of Israel, came to believe merely by seeing him, and said: “ No lie can hide 
in this face, nor fraud be found in it! ” 1

Although many scholars who have researched the matter have concluded 
that  the  proofs  of  Muhammad’s  ( UWBP )  prophethood  and  his  miracles 
number about one thousand, there are thousands, perhaps hundreds of thou-
sands, of proofs of his prophethood. And hundreds of thousands of men with 
varying  opinions  have  afﬁrmed  it  in  an  equal  number  of  ways.  The  Wise 
Qur’an alone demonstrates a thousand of the proofs of his prophethood, in 
addition to its own forty aspects of miraculousness.

Since prophethood is a phenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thou-
sands  of  persons  who  claimed  prophethood  and  performed  miracles  have 
lived  and  passed  away,  2  of  a  certainty  Muhammad’s  ( UWBP )  prophet-
hood  is  superior  to  all  the  others.  For  whatever  evidences,  qualities,  and 
attributes made prophets such as Jesus and Moses ( Upon whom be peace ) 
be known as prophets and were the means of their messengership, they were 
all possessed in a more perfect and comprehensive fashion by Muhammad 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). And since the causes and means of 
prophetic authority were more perfectly present in the person of Muhammad 
( UWBP ), this authority was to be found in him with more certainty than in 
all the others.

THIRD SIGN

The miracles of the Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ) were extremely varied. Since his messengership was universal, 
he was distinguished by miracles that related to almost all species of creation.

Just as the supreme lieutenant of a renowned ruler, arriving with many gifts 
in a city where various peoples live, will be welcomed by a representative of 
each people who acclaims him and bids him welcome in his own language; 
so  too,  when  the  supreme  Lieutenant  of  the  Monarch  of  Pre-Eternity  and 
Post-Eternity honoured the universe by coming as an envoy to the inhabit-
ants of the earth, and brought with him the light of truth and spiritual gifts 
sent by the Creator of the universe, which were connected to the truths of the 
whole universe, each species of creation – from water, rocks, trees, animals 
and human beings to the moon, the sun and the stars – each welcomed him 
and acclaimed his prophethood, each in its own language and each bearing 
one of his miracles.

Now it would require a voluminous work to mention all his miracles. As 
punctilious, investigating scholars have written many volumes concerning 
the proofs of his prophethood, here we will brieﬂy point out only the general 
categories into which fall miracles about which there are unanimous reports, 
both deﬁnite and in meaning ( k a t ’ î   v e   m a n e v î   m ü t e v a t i r  ). 1

The evidences of Muhammad’s ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 

prophethood fall into two main categories: 

T h e   F i r s t  is called i r h a s a t  and includes the paranormal events that hap-

pened at the time of his birth or before his prophetic mission. 

T h e   S e c o n d  group pertains to all the remaining evidences of his prophet-

hood, and contains two subdivisions: 

The ﬁrst are those wonders that were manifested after his departure from 
this world in order to conﬁrm his prophethood, and the second, those that 
he exhibited during the era of his prophethood. The latter has also two parts: 
The ﬁrst, the evidences of his prophethood that became manifest in his 
own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral conduct and perfec-
tions, and the second, the miracles manifested in the outer world. The last 
part again has two branches:

One, those concerning the Qur’an and spirituality, and the other, those 
relating to materiality and the universe. This last branch is again divided into 
two categories: 

The ﬁrst involves the paranormal happenings that occurred during his 
mission either to break the stubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment 
the faith of the believers. This category has twenty different sorts, such as 
the splitting of the moon, the ﬂowing of water from his ﬁngers, the satisfying

of  large  numbers  with  a  little  food,  and  the  speaking  of  trees,  rocks  and 
animals. Each of these sorts also has many instances, and thus has, in mean-
ing, the strength of conﬁrmation by consensus (   m a n e v î   t e v a t ü r   ) . As for the 
second category, this includes events lying in the future that occurred as he 
had predicted, on Allah’s instructions. Now, starting from the last category, 
we will summarize a list of them. 1

FOURTH SIGN

There  is  no  limit  to  the  reports  Allah’s  Most  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon 
whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  gave  concerning  the  Unseen  through  the 
instruction of the One All-Knowing of the Unseen. As we have mentioned 
the  types  of  these  reports  in  the  Twenty-Fifth  Word,  which  is  about  the 
miraculousness of the Qur’an, and to a degree explained and proved them, 
we now refer to that Wo r d  the explanation of the information he gave con-
cerning the Unseen about past times and prophets, as well as truths concern-
ing the Godhead, the universe, and the hereafter, and will point out a few 
of his many correct predictions about his Companions, his Family and his 
community. But ﬁrst, for a complete understanding of the subject, we will 
state six principles by way of an introduction.

First Principle

F i r s t   P r i n c i p l e

All the states and acts of the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ) testiﬁed to his veracity and prophethood, but not all of them 
had to be miraculous. For Allah Almighty sent him in the form of a human 
being so that he might be a guide and leader to human beings in their social 
affairs, and in the acts and deeds by means of which they attain happiness 
in this world and the next; and so that he might disclose to human beings 
the wonders of His art and His disposive power that underlie all occurrences 
and are in appearance customary, but in reality are miracles of divine power. 
If, then, he had abandoned the human state in his acts and become extra-
ordinary in all aspects, he could not have been a leader, or have instructed 
human beings with his acts, states, and conduct. He was, indeed, honoured 
with paranormal phenomena in order to prove his prophethood to obstinate 
unbelievers, and from time to time performed miracles as the need arose. 
But  as  required  by  the  examinations  and  trials  that  man  is  set,  his  mira-
cles never occurred so obviously as to compel everyone to believe, whether 
willingly or unwillingly. For the wisdom in man’s trial and accountability 
necessitates that the way be shown to him without depriving him of his will; 

1.  Unfortunately, I could not write as I had intended. Without choice, I wrote as my 

heart dictated, and I could not completely conform to the order of this classiﬁcation.

NINETEENTH LETTER – FOURTH SIGN

the door has to be opened to his intelligence without snatching its freedom 
from  its  hand.  If  the  Messenger’s  ( UWBP )  miracles  had  occurred  in  so 
apparent  a  way,  intelligence  would  have  had  no  choice;  Abu  Jahl  would 
have believed as did Abu Bakr; coal would have had the value of diamonds, 
and no purpose would have remained for testing and accountability.

It  is  a  source  of  amazement  that  while  thousands  of  men  of  different 
character came to believe through observing a single of his miracles, a single 
proof of his prophethood, or a word of his, or through merely seeing his face, 
some wretches are nowadays going astray as if those thousands of proofs 
of his prophethood were not sufﬁcient evidence, although they have come 
down to us through authentic transmission and with certain proofs, and have 
caused many thousands of exacting scholars and thinkers and different men 
to accept faith.

Second Principle

S e c o n d   P r i n c i p l e

Allah’s  Most  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace ) 
was a human being; hence he acted like a human being. He was also a mes-
senger and prophet, and with regard to his messengership, he was an inter-
preter and an envoy of Almighty Allah. His messengership was based upon 
revelation, which is of two kinds:

The First is explicit revelation. In this case, the Noble Messenger ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) is merely an interpreter and announcer, with 
no share in the content. The Qur’an and some sacred Hadith are included in 
this kind of revelation.

The Second is implicit revelation. The essence and gist of this is also 
based on revelation or inspiration, but its explanation and description were 
left to the Messenger ( UWBP ). When he explained and described such rev-
elation, sometimes he again relied on revelation, or on inspiration, or some-
times he spoke in terms of his own insight. When he resorted to his own 
interpretation, he either relied on the perceptive power given him on account 
of his prophetic mission, or he spoke as a human being and conformably to 
usage, custom and the level of common comprehension.

Thus, all the details of every Hadith were not necessarily derived from 
pure revelation, nor should the lofty marks of messengership be sought in 
such thoughts and transactions of his as were required by his participation 
in the human state. Since some truths were revealed to him in a brief and 
abstract form, and he himself described them in the light of his insight and 
according  to  common  comprehension,  the  metaphors  and  allusions  in  his 

120

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

descriptions sometimes may need explanation, or even interpretation. There 
are, indeed, some truths that the human mind can grasp only by way of com-
parison. For example, once in the presence of the Prophet ( UWBP ), a loud 
noise was heard. He said, “ T h i s   i s   t h e   n o i s e   o f   a   r o c k   t h a t   h a s   b e e n   r o l l i n g  
d o w n   f o r   s e v e n t y   y e a r s   a n d   h a s   n o w   r e a c h e d   t h e   l o w e s t   d e p t h s   o f   H e l l . ”  1 
An  hour  later  the  news  came  that  a  famous  dissembler  who  had  recently 
turned seventy years old had died and gone to Hell, thus explaining the event 
Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) had described by means 
of an eloquent comparison.

Third Principle

T h i r d   P r i n c i p l e

If there is a consensus of opinion concerning any related tradition ( Turk. 
t e v a t ü r ; Ar.  t a w ā t u r  ),  2 it is indisputable. There are two kinds of this sort 
of report: one is those reports about which there is ‘a clear, unambiguous 
t e v a t ü r  ),’  the  other  is  ‘consensus  in  meaning  ( m a n e v î  
consensus  ( s a r i h  
t e v a t ü r  ).’ The latter is also of two kinds: the ﬁrst includes those concerning 
which the consensus is implied by silence. For example, if a man in a com-
munity relates an incident in front of his people and those listening do not 
contradict him, that is, they respond to him by keeping silent, this implies 
their acceptance of the report. In particular, if that community is such as will 
not accept any error, will consider any lie reprehensible, is ready to criticize 
and, in addition, shows an interest in the reported incident, its silence testi-
ﬁes strongly to the incident having occurred.

The second kind of ‘consensus in meaning’ is that which occurs when 
different people relate a particular incident, for example, one o k k a  3 of food 
fed two hundred people, in different versions: one person describes in one 
way,  another  in  another  way,  and  another  in  yet  another  way,  but  all  are 
unanimously  agreed  on  the  occurrence  of  the  incident.  Thus,  its  certain 
occurrence is supported by ‘consensus in meaning’ and is deﬁnite; its actual 
occurrence is not harmed by differences in detail. Apart from this, there are 
times when a report supplied by a single person expresses the certainty of 
‘consensus,’ under certain conditions. It also sometimes happens that single 
report expresses certainity when supported by other, outside evidences. 

Most of the reports concerning the miracles and evidences of the Noble 
Messenger’s ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) prophethood that have

NINETEENTH LETTER – FOURTH SIGN

come down to us are either of the category of ‘clear consensus,’ or ‘con-
sensus  in  meaning,’  or  ‘consensus  implied  by  silence.’  As  for  the  others, 
although they are the report of a single person, they also have the certainty 
of  ‘consensus’  since  they  have  received  the  acceptance  of  the  meticulous 
authorities on Hadith. Of such meticulous authorities were those geniuses 
who were called a l - H a ﬁ z , who had committed to memory at least 100,000 
Hadiths, who offered for ﬁfty years their morning prayer with the ablution of 
the night prayer, and who produced the six accurate books of Hadith headed 
by those of Bukhari and Muslim. Without doubt, any report scrutinized and 
accepted by them cannot fall short of the certainty of ‘consensus.’ For they 
acquired such intimacy with the Noble Messenger’s ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ) Hadiths and became so familiar with his exalted style and 
manner that they could spot at ﬁrst sight a single false Hadith among a hun-
dred reports, and would reject it, saying, “ This cannot be a prophetic tradi-
tion; it does not have his wording. ” Since they were able to recognize the 
precious quality of the Hadith, like an expert jeweller, there was no possibil-
ity of their confusing any other word with that of the Messenger ( UWBP ). 
Some researchers, however, such as Ibn al-Jawzi, went to such excesses in 
their criticism that they regarded many accurate traditions as false. Never-
theless, this does not mean that every false wording is wrong in meaning, but 
that the wording itself is not that of the Messenger ( UWBP ).

Q u e s t i o n :  What is the use of citing the chain of transmission of a tradi-
tion so that even if it is not called for in the case of a well-known incident 
they say: “ So-and-so informed so-and-so, etc. ”?

A n s w e r :   Its  uses  and  beneﬁts  are  many;  one  is  that  the  citing  of  the 
chain shows the concurrence of the truthful, reliable and exacting scholars 
of Hadith and the unanimity of the discerning authorities whose names are 
included; each of the scholars and authorities endorses the accuracy of the 
tradition, and places his seal and signature on it.

Q u e s t i o n :   Why  were  the  miraculous  events  not  transmitted  through 
numerous chains concerning which there was a consensus of opinion and 
with  as  great  emphasis  as  the  basic  injunctions  of  the  Sacred  Law,  the 
Shari‘a?

A n s w e r :  Because the majority of the injunctions of the Shari‘a are needed 
by most people at most times, for they all are applicable to each person, like 
an obligation incumbent on all. But not everyone needs to know of every 
miracle; even if he does, it sufﬁces him to hear it only once. It is, in fact, like 
the kind of obligation the observance of which by some will absolve the rest; 

122

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

it is quite enough for miracles to be known only to some. For this reason, 
even if the occurrence and reality of a miracle ten times more certain than 
that of an injunction of the Shari‘a, it will still come to us through one or 
two narrators, whereas the injunction is narrated by ten or twenty persons.

Fourth Principle

F o u r t h   P r i n c i p l e

The future events that the Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ) predicted were not isolated incidents; he rather predicted 
general and recurring events in a particular way. Those events, however, had 
many sides to them and each time he mentioned them, he explained a dif-
ferent side. Then the narrator of the Hadiths combined all of those sides and 
they sometimes appear contrary to reality. There are, for example, varying 
narrations  concerning  the  Mahdi,  each  with  different  details  and  descrip-
tions. However, as was explained in a section of the Twenty-Fourth Word, 
the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) gave the tid-
ings, relying on revelation, of a Mahdi who would come in every century to 
preserve the morale of the believers, help them not to fall into despair in the 
face of disasters, and link the hearts of the believers with the people of the 
Prophet’s ( UWBP ) Family, who constitute a luminous line in the world of 
Islam. Every century has seen a Mahdi from the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) Family, 
or several, similar to the Great Mahdi who is promised to come at the end 
of time. One of the ‘Abbasid Caliphs even, who were said to be descendants 
of  the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  Family,  was  a  Mahdi  who  possessed  many  of 
the Great Mahdi’s characteristics. In this way the attributes of the Mahdi’s 
deputies and of the spiritual poles who were Mahdis who were to precede 
the Great Mahdi and were samples and forerunners of him, were confused 
with the attributes of the Great Mahdi himself, and the narrations concerning 
him were seen to conﬂict with one another.

to him the tidings of the Unseen, and he made them known. And since Allah 
Almighty is All-Wise and Compassionate, His wisdom and mercy require 
that  most  of  the  matters  of  the  Unseen  be  veiled  or  obscure.  For  in  this 
world, events disagreeable to human beings are numerous; prior knowledge 
of their happening would be painful. It is for this reason that death and the

human beings remain behind the veil of the Unseen. 

Again,  as  a  result  of  His  wisdom  and  mercy,  Allah  Almighty  did  not 
entirely  or  in  detail  inform  His  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace ) about the dreadful events that would befall his Family and Compan-
ions after his demise, in order not to hurt his extremely tender compassion 
for his community and his ﬁrm affection for his Family. 1 For certain divine 
purposes, He made some of these signiﬁcant events known to him, but not 
in all their awesomeness. As for pleasant events, He communicated them to 
the Messenger ( UWBP ) sometimes in outline and sometimes in detail, and 
the Messenger ( UWBP ) in turn made them known to his Companions. Thus 
those tidings were accurately transmitted to us by the scholars of Hadith, who 
were  at  the  height  of  piety,  justice,  and  truthfulness,  and  who  feared  very

Sixth Principle

Although  some  qualities  and  aspects  of  the  Most  Noble  Messenger 
( UWBP ) have been described in books of history and biography, most of 
those qualities relate to his humanness. But in reality, the spiritual personal-
ity and the sacred nature of that blessed person were so exalted and luminous 
that the qualities described in books fall short of his high stature. For accord-
ing to the rule,  ِلِ(cid:150)اَ(cid:159)ْ(cid:170)اﯬﯦ  ُبَ(cid:93) َ

tions of his vast community, in addition to being the object of inﬁnite divine 
mercy in an inﬁnite fashion and with an inﬁnite capacity to receive. He was,

the Camel so that his deep love and affection toward her ( May Allah be pleased with her ) 
would not be hurt. He said, in fact, to his wives: “ I wish I knew which one of you will be 
involved in that incident. ” Later he was apparently made aware of it to a slightly greater 
extent, as he once said to ‘Alī ( May Allah be pleased with him ): اَ(cid:183)َ(cid:179)َ(cid:174)ْاَ(cid:174) اَ(cid:183)ْ(cid:155)ِ

indeed, the result and the most perfect fruit of the universe, the interpreter 
and the beloved of the Creator of the cosmos. Hence his true nature in its 
entirety, and the truth of all his perfections, cannot be contained in the human 
qualities recorded in books of history and biography. Certainly, the stature 
of a blessed person with the Archangels Gabriel and Michael as two aides-
de-camp at his side in the Battle of Badr, 1 is not to be found in the form of a 
person bargaining with a beduin in the marketplace over the price of a horse, 
bringing forth Khuzayma as his sole witness. 2

In  order  not  to  proceed  in  error,  one  should  raise  his  head  beyond  the 
ordinary qualities of the Prophet ( UWBP ) that pertain to his participation in 
the human state, and behold instead his true nature and luminous stature that 
pertain to the rank of messengership. Otherwise, one will either show him 
irreverence, or instil doubts in oneself. Listen to the following comparison 
for an understanding of this mystery.

Suppose  that  a  date  seed  was  planted  in  the  earth,  has  sprouted  and 
become a large, fruit-bearing tree, and is still continuing to grow taller and 
broader. Or that a peahen’s egg was incubated, a chick was hatched from it 
and became a beautifully adorned peacock gilded all over with the imprint 
of power, and is still growing bigger and more beautiful. Now, there exist 
qualities, properties and precisely balanced elements that belong to the seed 
and the egg, but are not as great and signiﬁcant as those of the tree and the 
bird that emerge from them. So, while describing the qualities of the tree and 
the bird together with those of the seed and the egg, one should turn one’s 
attention from the seed to the tree, and from the egg to the bird, so that one’s 
reason may ﬁnd the description acceptable. Otherwise, if you claim: “ I have 
obtained thousands of dates from a seed, ” or, “ This egg is the king of all 
birds, ” you will invite others to contradict and deny your words.

The  humanness  of  Allah’s  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace ) may be likened to the seed or egg, and his essential nature, illumined 
with the function of messengership, to the Tuba tree of Paradise, or to the 
birds of Paradise. His essential nature is, moreover, continually moving to 
greater perfection. That is why, when you think of the man who disputed in 
the market with a beduin, you should also turn the eye of imagination to that 
luminous being who, riding the R a f r a f , leaving Gabriel behind, reached the 
“ d i s t a n c e   o f   t w o   b o w s t r i n g s .  ”( 53:9 ) Otherwise you will either be disrespect-
ful toward him, or fail to convince the evil-commanding soul.

All these certain and authentic traditions are the proven predictions of the 
struggles of ‘Ali against ‘A’isha, Zubayr and Talha during the Battle of the 
Camel, against Mu‘awiya at Sifﬁn, and against the Kharijites at Harawra’ 
and Nahrawan.

The  Messenger  ( UWBP )  also  informed  ‘Ali  about  a  man  who  would 
stain ‘Ali’s beard with the blood of his own head. 6 ‘Ali knew the man; it was 
‘Abd al-Rahman b. Muljam the Kharijite.

He  also  mentioned  a  man  marked  with  a  peculiar  sign,  Dhu’l-Thudia. 
When  the  man  was  found  among  the  dead  of  the  Kharijites,  ‘Ali  showed

him as a proof of the rightness of his cause, announcing at the same time the 
miracle of the Prophet ( UWBP ). 1

According  to  another  authentic  tradition  related  by  Umm  Salama  and 
others,  the  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  also 
predicted that Husain would be killed at Taff ( Karbala ). 2 Fifty years later 
the painful event took place as predicted.

He also repeatedly predicted that after his demise, his Family would face 
death, calamities, and exile, and gave some details. اًد(cid:192)ِر ْ(cid:131)َ(cid:98)َو  ً(cid:203)ْ(cid:99)َ(cid:162) َنْوَ(cid:163)ْ(cid:171)َ(cid:192) 3 What 
he had predicted later came true exactly.
In  this  connection,  a  question  may  be  asked:  although  ‘Ali,  with  his 
extraordinary bravery and profound knowledge in addition to his kinship to 
Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ), greatly deserved to be Caliph, why did he not 
precede the others in holding the caliphate, and why did Islam experience 
such disorder during his caliphate?

A n s w e r :  A supreme spiritual pole from the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) Family 
is reported as having said: “ The Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ) had desired that ‘Ali be Caliph, but it was made known to 
him from the Unseen that the will of Allah Almighty was different. He then 
abandoned his desire, submitting himself to Allah’s will. ” 4

One of the reasons Allah’s will was different could have been that after 
the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) demise when the Companions were more than ever 
in need of alliance and unity, if ‘Ali had taken the leadership it would most 
probably have aroused in many persons and tribes a tendency to compete, 
because  of  his  uncompromising  nature,  and  fearless,  ascetic,  heroic,  and 
independent character, and widely known courage – as was the case during 
his caliphate – and divisions among the believers would have resulted.

Another reason for the delay of ‘Ali’s caliphate was the following: at the 
time of his caliphate, the Muslim community, which had expanded rapidly 
through the intermingling of many tribes and peoples, possessed such traits 
as reﬂected the opinions of the seventy-three sects that the Noble Messen-
ger ( UWBP ) had predicted would evolve in due time.  5 Therefore, in the 
face of such disturbances, someone was needed with the wondrous strength,

courage, respectability and sagacity of ‘Ali, who had behind him the force 
of the respected Hashimites and the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) Family, so that he 
could resist the sedition. And indeed he did so, in a fashion conformable to 
the prediction of the Prophet, who had said to him: “ I   h a v e  f o u g h t   f o r   t h e  
r e v e l a t i o n   o f   t h e   Q u r ’ a n ;   y o u   w i l l   ﬁ g h t   f o r   i t s   i n t e r p r e t a t i o n . ” 1

A further reason for this delay was that without ‘Ali, worldly rule would 
most  probably  have  caused  the  Umayyad  kings  to  go  completely  astray. 
However, being confronted with ‘Ali and the Prophet’s Family, and having 
to appear equal to them and to preserve their prestige before the Muslims, 
all the leaders of the Umayyad dynasty, even if not they themselves, in any 
event due to their encouragement and recommendations, their followers and 
supporters, worked with all their strength to preserve and disseminate the 
truths  of  Islam  and  belief  and  the  Qur’anic  decrees.  Thus,  they  produced 
thousands of punctilious interpreters of the Law, and authorities on Hadith, 
and saints and puriﬁed scholars. Had they not been faced by the strong relig-
iosity,  sainthood,  and  virtuousness  of  ‘Ali  and  of  the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP ) 
Family, it is possible that the Umayyads would have gone completely astray 
as happened at the end of their rule, and as did the ‘Abbasids.

I t   m i g h t   a l s o   b e   a s k e d :  “ Why did the Islamic caliphate not remain in the 
Prophet’s ( UWBP ) Family, since they were the most deserving and ﬁtted 
for it? ”

T h e  A n s w e r :  Worldly rule is deceptive, and the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) Fam-
ily had been appointed to preserve the decrees of the Qur’an and the truths 
of Islam. Not to be deceived by power, the one who was to hold it and the 
caliphate had to be as sinless as a prophet, or as purehearted and unworldly 
as the Four-Rightly Guided Caliphs, ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-‘Aziz or the Mahdi 
of the ‘Abbasids. In fact, the caliphate of the Fatimid dynasty, which was 
founded in the name of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) Family in Egypt, and the 
rule  of  the  Almohads  in  Africa,  and  the  Safavid  dynasty  in  Iran  showed 
that worldly rule was not suitable for the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) Family, for it 
caused them to neglect their primary duty, the protection of religion and the 
service of Islam. When, on the other hand, they gave up worldly rule, they 
served Islam and the Qur’an brilliantly and successfully.

Now see: of the poles of sainthood descended from Hasan, especially the 
Four Poles 2 and above all ‘Abd al-Qadir Gilani, and the Imams of Husain’s

line, especially Zayn al-‘Abidin and Ja‘far al-Sadiq, each became like a spir-
itual  Mahdi,  dispelled  wrongdoing  and  spiritual  darkness,  and  spread  the 
light of the Qur’an and the truths of belief. In so doing each showed that he 
was a true heir of his noble forefather.

I t   m a y  

t h e n   b e   a s k e d :   “ What  was  the  wisdom  in  the  awesome  and 
bloody dissension that was visited on blessed Islam and the luminous Age 
of Bliss, and what aspect of mercy was there in it, for they did not deserve 
such distress?

T h e   A n s w e r :  Just as a heavy spring rainstorm stirs into action the poten-
tialities of all the varieties of plants, seeds,  and trees,  and causes them  to 
develop,  so  each  blossoms  in  its  particular  way  and  performs  the  duties 
inherent in its nature; so too, the dissension visited on the Companions and 
their successors stirred their potentialities into action, which were all differ-
ent and like seeds; it spurred them on. Exclaiming, “ Islam is in danger! Fire! 
Fire! ”, it put fear into all the groups and made them hasten to protect Islam. 
According to its abilities, each of the groups shouldered one of the numerous 
different duties of the Islamic community and strove in utmost earnestness. 
Some working for the preservation of the prophetic Hadiths, some for the 
preservation of the Shari‘a, some for the preservation of the truths of belief, 
some for the preservation of the Qur’an, and so on; each group undertook 
a  particular  duty.  They  strove  to  perform  the  duties  of  Islam.  Numerous 
multicoloured ﬂowers opened. Through the storm, seeds were cast to all the 
corners of the extensive world of Islam; half the earth was transformed into 
a rose garden. But sadly, together with the roses, the thorns of the deviant 
sects appeared in the garden.

It was as if the Hand of Power had shaken that era in wrath, rotated it with 
intense vigour, and electriﬁed the men of zeal. Through the centrifugal force 
of that movement, a great many enlightened interpreters of the Law, lumi-
nous  scholars  of  Hadith,  holy  memorizers  of  the  Qur’an,  gifted  scholars, 
men of purity, and poles of sainthood were ﬂung off and caused to emigrate 
to the remote corners of the world of Islam. It ﬁred with enthusiasm all the 
people of Islam from East to West and awakened them to the treasures of the 
Qur’an. Now we return to our subject.

There  are  thousands  of  events  that  Allah’s  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) predicted and that happened as he foretold. 
Here we shall mention a few of them. The majority of those we will cite 
are  agreed  upon  by  the  six  well-known,  most  authentic  books  of  Hadith,

particularly Bukhari and Muslim. There is a ‘consensus in meaning’ con-
cerning the reports, while others, on account of being veriﬁed by meticulous 
researchers, may also be considered to have this certainty.

According  to  an  authentic  and  certain  narration,  the  Noble  Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) said to his Companions: “ Yo u   w i l l  
b e  v i c t o r i o u s   o v e r   a l l   y o u r   e n e m i e s ,   w i l l   s u c c e e d   i n   t h e   c o n q u e s t   o f   M e c c a ,

a n t i n e s   a n d   t h e   P e r s i a n s . ” 5 He did not say this as a matter of conjecture or 
personal opinion; he said it as if he had seen it, and what he said came true 
as predicted. This was despite the fact that at the time he foretold it he had 
to migrate to Medina with a handful of followers, with the rest of the world, 
including the environs of Medina, hostile to him!

He  also  repeatedly  declared,  according  to  authentic  and  certain  narra-
tions, that Abu Bakr and ‘Umar would outlive him and be his Caliphs, that 
they would act for Allah’s sake and within the bounds of Allah’s pleasure 
and that of the Prophet ( UWBP ), that Abu Bakr’s rule would be short, and 
that ‘Umar would remain a long time to succeed in many conquests. Thus he

Two to three weeks later Ya‘la b. Munabbih returned from the battlefront. In

swore by Allah that what had taken place at the battle was exactly the same 
as the Bringer of Sure News ( UWBP ) had described. 4

He thus predicted the six-month-long caliphate of Hasan and the period of 
the  four  Rightly-Guided  Caliphs,  and,  following  that,  the  transition  from 
caliphate to monarchy and monarchy’s being plagued by intrigues and tyr-

the  Muslims  with  extraordinary  bravery,  would  face  terrible  attacks,  and 
that because of him fearsome events would befall people. What he foretold 
came about exactly: during Umayyad rule, ‘Abdullah b. Zubayr declared his 
caliphate  in  Mecca,  heroically  fought  in  many  battles,  until  ﬁnally  Hajjaj 
the Tyrant attacked him with a large force, and following a ﬁerce battle the 
illustrious hero was martyred.

Again, according to an authentic narration, he foretold the emergence of 

the Umayyad dynasty 4 and the tyrannical rule of many of its monarchs, 
including Yazid  5 and Walid, and Mu‘awiya’s assuming leadership of the 
Muslims. He advised justice and gentleness, and said:  ْحـ ِ(cid:107) ْ(cid:126)َاَ(cid:158)  َتﯰﯧَ(cid:171)َ(cid:174) اَذِاَو

to remain in power for a long time, and said:

All this proved to be true.

According  to  an  authentic  narration,  when  Sa‘d  b.  Abi  Waqqas  was

ّ(cid:99)َ(cid:110)  ُفَ
ّ(cid:171)َ(cid:151)َ(cid:170)  1  thus  predicting  that 
ﮱﮐوُرَ(cid:114)ٰا 
he would be a great commander winning many victories, and many peoples 
would beneﬁt from him entering the fold of Islam, while others would be 
destroyed by him. His words proved to be true; Sa‘d led the Muslim armies, 
wiped out the Persian Empire, and caused many peoples to reach guidance, 
the path of Islam.

Also according to an authentic narration, when the Negus, the Abyssinian 
ruler, who had accepted faith earlier, died in the seventh year of the Hijra, 
Allah’s Prophet ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) informed his Com-
panions  about  it;  he  even  performed  funeral  prayers  for  him.  2  One  week 
later came the news conﬁrming the death of the Negus on the very same day 
as the Prophet ( UWBP ) had said.

According to an authentic narration, when the Noble Prophet ( UWBP ) 
was with his closest four Companions on the top of Mount Uhud ( or Hira ), 
ّ(cid:178)ِاَ(cid:158)  ْتُ(cid:93)ْ(cid:102)ُا 3

and foretold the martyrdom of ‘Umar, ‘Uthman, and ‘Ali. It too proved true.
Now, O unfortunate, wretched man without heart who says that Muham-
mad ( UWBP ) was only a clever person and then closes his eyes to that Sun 
of Truth! Of all his ﬁfteen different kinds of miracle, you have thus far heard 
only a hundredth part of one kind, that relating to his predictions which have 
the certainty of ‘consensus in meaning.’ To discover future events through 
one’s own perspicacity and thus succeed in even one hundredth part of the 
Prophet’s ( UWBP ) predictions, one would have to be of the highest gen-
ius. Even if we merely called him a genius as you call him, could such a 
man have ever seen anything wrongly? Or could he have ever stooped to 
reporting it wrongly? Not to heed the word of such a hundredfold genius

According to an authentic narration, the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ) said to Fatima: ىِ(cid:92) اً(cid:162)وُ(cid:111)ُ(cid:170) ىِ(cid:99)ْ(cid:193)َ(cid:92)  ِلْ(cid:182)َا ُلَ

what he said took place.

He also told Abu Dharr:  َكَدْ(cid:110)َو  ُتوُ(cid:175)َ(cid:98)َو  َكَدْ(cid:110)َو

All this came true twenty years later.

Once,  as  he  awakened  in  the  house  of  Anas  b.  Malik’s  aunt,  Umm

Haram, he smilingly said: ِةَ
Umm Haram requested: “ Pray that I too will be with them. ” He said: “ You 
shall be. ” Forty years later she accompanied her husband, ‘Ubada b. Samit, 
on  the  conquest  of  Cyprus.  She  died  there,  and  her  grave  has  ever  since 
been visited by the believers. Thus, what the Messenger ( UWBP ) foretold 
proved to be true.

I t   m a y   b e   a s k e d   h e r e :  Love for the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) Family is a com-
mand of the Qur’an and was greatly encouraged by him. The affection of the 
Shi‘a may therefore serve as an excuse for them, since deep affection may 
be likened to intoxication. Why, then, can the Shi‘a, especially the Raﬁda, 
not beneﬁt from their love, and why is their love described by the Prophet 
( UWBP ) as transgression?

T h e   A n s w e r :  Love is of two kinds: 
The  First  is  to  love  something  or  someone  for  the  meaning  it  or  he 
signiﬁes. This means to love ‘Ali, Hasan, Husain, and the Prophet’s Fam-
ily in the name of Allah and of His Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ). This kind of love augments love of the Messenger ( UWBP ) 
and becomes a means to love Allah Almighty. Thus, it is permissible, and 
its excess is not harmful or aggressive, nor does it call for reproach and 
hostility towards others.

The  Second  Kind  of  love  takes  the  means  as  the  object,  it  is  to  love 
something or someone for itself or himself. In it, one does not think of the 
Messenger ( UWBP ), but devotes one’s love to ‘Ali on account of his brav-
ery, and to Hasan and Husain on account of their greatness and lofty quali-
ties, no matter if one knows the Messenger ( UWBP ) or recognizes Allah. 
This  love  does  not  lead  to  love  for  Allah  and  His  Messenger  ( UWBP ); 
besides, when excessive, it results in censure of others and enmity towards 
them. It was on account of this kind of love that such people held aloof from 
Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, and fell into loss. Their negative love, indeed, is the 
source of misfortune. 

According  to  an  authentic  narration,  Allah’s  Most  Noble  Messenger

Again, according to an authentic narration, he declared: 

ّىِ(cid:171)َ(cid:150)  ْىَدَ(cid:192) ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) ُرَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:193)َ(cid:114) ُحَ(cid:99)ْ(cid:159)ُ(cid:98)َو “ T h e   f o r t r e s s   o f   K h a y b a r   w i l l   b e   c o n q u e r e d   a t   ‘ A l i ’s  
h a n d . ”  1 As a miracle of his prophethood and beyond all expectation, the 
following day ‘Ali ripped off the gate of the fortress of Khaybar, used it as 
a shield, and seized the fortress. When he threw it aside after the conquest, 
eight strong men – or according to another version, forty – tried to lift it, but 
could not do so. 2

The Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) also pre-

dicted the Battle of Sifﬁn between ‘Ali and Mu‘awiya, saying: 

   3   ٌةَد ِ(cid:110)اَو ا َ(cid:175)ُ(cid:182)اَوْ(cid:150)َد  ِناَ(cid:99)َ(cid:87)ِ(cid:158)  َلِ(cid:99)َ(cid:99)ْ(cid:163)َ(cid:98) ىَ

ّ(cid:127)(cid:170)ا ُموُ(cid:163)َ(cid:98)  َ(cid:202)

He also declared that a group of rebels would kill ‘Ammar. 4 

ّ(cid:175)َ(cid:150) َ

ّنِا When  ‘Ammar  was  killed  at  the  Battle  of  Sifﬁn, 
ُةَ(cid:193)ِ(cid:154)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)ا ُةَ(cid:87)ِ(cid:159)ْ(cid:170)ا ُهُ(cid:171)ُ(cid:99)ْ(cid:163)َ(cid:98) اًرا َ
‘Ali  cited  this  as  a  proof  that  Mu‘awiya’s  followers  were  rebellious;  but 
Mu‘awiya  interpreted  it  differently,  and  also  ‘Amr  b.  al-‘As  said:  “ The 
rebels are murderers, not all of us. ”

The Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) also said: اً

happened.

Before accepting faith, Sahl b. ‘Amr was once captured in a battle. ‘Umar 
said to the Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ): “ Allow me to pull out his teeth, 
for he, with his eloquent speech, incited the idolatrous Quraysh to wage war 
against us. ” Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) replied:

calmed and comforted the Companions in Mecca with an address; while in 
Medina Abu Bakr, with his great ﬁrmness, was also giving a very important 
address to comfort the Companions. Surprisingly, the two addresses resem-
ble each other in regard to their wording.

To Suraqa, the Prophet ( UWBP ) once said: 

َكِ(cid:92)  َفْ(cid:193)ﯬﯦ “ Yo u   w i l l   w e a r   t h e   t w o   b r a c e l e t s   o f

C h o s r o e s .  ” 1 Chosroes was wiped out during the caliphate of ‘Umar. When 
Chosroes’  jewelry  arrived,  ‘Umar  put  the  bracelets  on  Suraqa,  saying, 
َةَ(cid:162)اَر ُ(cid:126) ا َ(cid:175)ُ(cid:183)َ(cid:127)َ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)َاَو ىَر ْ(cid:127)ﯮﯦ ا َ(cid:175)ُ(cid:183)َ(cid:93)َ(cid:171) َ(cid:126) ى ِذَ

ِ(cid:195) ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا 2 This conﬁrmed the report of 
the Prophet ( UWBP ).

The  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  also 
declared:  ُهَدْ(cid:151)َ(cid:92) ىَر ْ(cid:127)ﯮﯦ  َ(cid:203)َ(cid:158) ىَر ْ(cid:127)ﯮﯦ  َبَ(cid:182)َذ اَذِا “ O n c e   C h o s r o e s   t h e   P e r s i a n  
h a s   g o n e ,   t h e r e   w i l l   b e   n o   o t h e r . ” 3 So it turned out.

He  once  said  to  Chosroes’  envoy:  “ C h o s r o e s   h a s   n o w   b e e n   k i l l e d   b y  
h i s   s o n   S h i r v i y a   P a r v i z . ”  4 Upon investigating and ﬁnding out that he had 
indeed been murdered at that very time, the envoy accepted Islam. The name 
of the envoy occurs in some narrations as Firuz.

According to an authentic narration, the Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) once 
mentioned a secret letter that Khatib b. Balta‘a had sent to the Quraysh. He 
sent ‘Ali and Miqdad to fetch it, saying, “ There is a person at such-and-such 
a location bearing such-and-such a letter. Take it and bring it here. ” They 
went and brought exactly the letter he had described from exactly the place. 
The Prophet ( UWBP ) summoned Khatib and asked him why he had done it. 
Khatib apologized, and the Prophet ( UWBP ) pardoned him. 5

Again,  according  to  an  authentic  narration  concerning  ‘Utba  b.  Abi

the terrible fate of ‘Utba. For while on his way to the Yemen, ‘Utba was 
devoured by a lion. Both the malediction and the prediction of the Prophet 
were thus conﬁrmed.

At the conquest of Mecca, as is also related in an authentic narration, Bilal 
al-Habashi went up onto the roof of the Ka‘ba and made the call to prayer, 
while Abu Sufyan, ‘Attab b. Asid, and Harith b. Hisham, from among the 
leaders of the Quraysh, were sitting together nearby. ‘Attab said: “ My father 
was fortunate enough not to witness this moment. ” Harith said contemptu-
ously about Bilal: “ Could Muhammad have not found someone other than 
this black crow to make the mu’ezzin? ” Abu Sufyan said: “ I am afraid to 
say anything, for he will come to know of whatever I say. Even if nothing 
else informs him, the rocks of this Batha [ Mecca ] will do so. ” Indeed, a lit-
tle later the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) encoun-
tered them and repeated to them their conversation word for word. That very 
moment ‘Attab and Harith became Muslims. 1

See, wretched denier who does not recognize the Messenger ( UWBP )! 
Two stubborn leaders of the Quraysh came to believe on hearing this sin-
gle report of his from the Unseen. How corrupted your heart must be, for 
you hear about thousands of miracles having the certainty of ‘consensus in 
meaning’ like this one, and still you are not completely satisﬁed! However, 
to return to our subject.

According to an authentic narration, ‘Abbas was captured by the Com-
panions in the Battle of Badr. When he was asked for ransom, he said he 
did  not  have  money.  Allah’s  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace ) said to him: “ Yo u   a n d   y o u r   w i f e   U m m   F a d l   h i d   t h a t   m u c h   m o n e y  
i n   s u c h - a n d - s u c h   a   p l a c e . ”  2  ‘Abbas  con-
[   h e   g a v e  
ﬁrmed this, saying: “ This was a secret known by only the two of us, ” and 
became a Muslim.

t h e   e x a c t   a m o u n t   ]  

Also  according  to  an  authentic  narration,  a  dangerous  Jewish  sorcerer 
named Labid once concocted a strong and effective spell to harass Allah’s 
Messenger ( UWBP ). He wrapped hair and thread around a comb, bewitched 
it, and threw it into a well. The Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) told his Com-
panions including ‘Ali to go and bring the spell in the well, which they did,

ﬁnding it exactly as described. As they unwrapped the hair, the Messenger’s 
( UWBP ) discomfort lessened. 1

Again,  according  to  an  authentic  narration,  the  Noble  Messenger 
( UWBP ) once gave the news of the awesome fate of an apostate to a group 
that included such important persons as Abu Hurayra and Hudhayfa, saying: 
ٍدُ(cid:110)ُا  ْنـِ(cid:174) ُمَ(cid:147)ْ(cid:150)َا ِراَ
ُسْر ِ(cid:138) 2 Abu Hurayra related: “ I was afraid, 
as later only two remained from that group, one of which was me. Finally, 
the other man was killed in the Battle of Yamama as one of the followers 
of Musaylima. ” 3 The truth of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) prediction was thus 
conﬁrmed.

ّ(cid:179)(cid:170)ا ىِ(cid:158) ْمﯭﯦ ِدَ(cid:110)َا 

It is related through an authentic chain of reports that ‘Umayr and Safwan, 
before they became Muslims, once decided to kill the Most Noble Messen-
ger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) for a handsome reward that had 
been offered them. When ‘Umayr arrived in Medina with this intention, the 
Messenger  ( UWBP )  summoned  him,  and,  putting  his  hand  on  ‘Umayr’s 
chest, told him about what he had planned with Safwan. ‘Umayr afﬁrmed it 
and became a Muslim. 4

Like  those  mentioned  above,  many  predictions  which  the  Noble  Mes-
senger  ( UWBP )  gave  concerning  the  Unseen  have  been  recorded  in  the 
six best-known, authentic books of Hadith, together with the chains of the 
narrators. As for the occurrences related in this work, they are deﬁnite to 
the degree of ‘consensus in meaning,’ being related in Bukhari and Mus-
lim, which are accepted by the scholars as the most authentic sources after 
the Qur’an, and in the other collections like  Ti r m i d h i ,   N a s a ’ i ,   A b u   D a ’ u d ,  
M u s t a d r a k  a l - H a k i m ,  M u s n a d  a l - A h m a d  b .  H a n b a l ,  a n d  D a l a ’ i l  a l - B a y h a q i .
Now,  unthinking  denier!  Do  not  shrug  these  off,  saying,  “ Muhammad 
the Arabian was clever! ” Because the accurate predictions of Muhammad 
( UWBP ) concerning the Unseen cannot be explained except in either of the 
following  two  ways:  you  will  either  suppose  that  this  blessed  person  had 
such piercing vision and expansive genius that he saw and knew the past 
and the future and all the world; beheld the East, the West, and the whole

universe; and discovered what happened in the past and what will happen in 
the future. Such a quality is not to be found in a human being, but if it was to 
be, it would certainly be a wonder, a gift, bestowed on him by the Creator of 
the world, which would itself be the greatest of miracles. Or you will believe 
this blessed person to be an ofﬁcial and a student of One under whose dis-
posal and observation everything stands, under whose command are all ages 
and all the species and realms of beings in the cosmos, in whose great ledger 
is recorded everything, so that He may show and communicate them to his 
student whenever He wishes. Thus, Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ) instructs others as he himself is instructed by the 
Lord of Pre-Eternity.

It  is  related  in  an  authentic  narration  that  when  the  Prophet  ( UWBP ) 
appointed Khalid b. al-Walid to ﬁght against Ukaydir, the head of the Dumat 
al-Jandal, he informed Khalid that he would ﬁnd Ukaydir on a wild ox hunt,

lid captured Ukaydir in exactly this way.

According to an authentic narration, when the Quraysh hung up on the 
wall  of  the  Ka‘ba  a  leaf  on  which  were  written  words  against  the  Bani 
Hashim, the Prophet ( UWBP ) said to them: “ Wo r m s   h a v e   e a t e n   t h e   l e a f ,  
e x c e p t   t h e   p a r t s   b e a r i n g   t h e   n a m e s   o f   A l l a h . ”  2 They examined the leaf to 
ﬁnd it in the same condition as had been described.

According to an authentic narration, the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom 
be blesssings and peace ) said: “ T h e r e   w i l l   b e   a   b i g   e p i d e m i c   d u r i n g   t h e   c o n -

of ‘Umar, a widespread epidemic caused in three days the death of about 
seventy thousand people.

blesssings and peace ) predicted that Basra 4 and Baghdad would come into

Yet of this kind alone, we have not even mentioned one tenth. In addition to 
what is mentioned here, four general kinds of miracle concerning predictions 
of the Unseen have been described brieﬂy in the Twenty-Fifth Word, which 
is  about  the  miraculousness  of  the  Qur’an.  Now  consider  the  kinds  men-
tioned here together with the four extensive sorts communicated from the 
Unseen by the tongue of the Qur’an, you will see what conclusive, indisput-
able, sound, brilliant, and ﬁrm proof of his messengership they form. Indeed, 
anyone whose heart and mind are not corrupted will of a surety believe that 
Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) was the Messenger of a 
Glorious One who is the Creator of all things, the One All-Knowing of the 
Unseen, and received knowledge from Him.

SEVENTH SIGN

We  will  give  in  this  Sign  a  few  examples  from  among  the  Prophet’s 
( UWBP ) miracles that relate to his effecting increase in food and that are 
deﬁnite to the degree of ‘consensus in meaning.’ But before going into the 
subject, some introductory comments will be appropriate.

Introduction

Introduction: Each of the following examples of miracles is narrated, 
as authentic, through various – sometimes as many as sixteen – chains of 
transmission.  Most  of  them  occurred  in  the  presence  of  large  assemblies, 
and  were  narrated  by  many  truthful  persons  of  good  repute  from  among 
those present. For example, from among seventy men who partook of four 
handfuls of food and were ﬁlled, 1 one relates the incident and the others do 
not contradict him. Their silence thus indicates their conﬁrmation. For if in 
that era of truth and truthfulness the Companions, who were lovers of the 
truth and earnest and honest, had witnessed even the tiniest lie, they would 
have rejected and denied it. But the incidents we will be citing were narrated 
by many, and the others who witnessed them remained silent. Thus, each of 
these incidents has the certainty of ‘consensus in meaning.’

Furthermore,  books  of  both  history  and  the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  biog-
raphy testify that, next to the preservation of the Qur’an and its verses, the 
Companions worked with all their strength to preserve the deeds and words 
of Allah’s Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), 
and especially those relating to the injunctions of the Shari‘a and to mira-
cles, paying extreme attention to their accuracy. They never neglected even 
the tiniest aspect of his conduct, actions, and states. This and the fact that 
they recorded them is testiﬁed to by books of Hadith.

In addition, in the Era of Bliss, they wrote down and recorded very many 
of  the  Hadiths  concerning  the  injunctions  of  the  Law  and  his  miracles. 
The Seven ‘Abdullahs  1 in particular recorded them in writing. Especially 
‘Abdullah b. al-‘Abbas, known as the Interpreter of the Qur’an, and ‘Abdul-
lah b. ‘Amr b. al-‘As some thirty to forty years later, and the thousands of 
exacting scholars of the generation that followed the Companions recorded 
the Hadiths and miracles in writing. Still later, chieﬂy the four great inter-
preters of the Law and thousands of exacting scholars of Hadith related them 
and preserved them in writing. Then two hundred years after the Hijra, fore-
most Bukhari and Muslim and the six accepted books of tradition, under-
took the duty of their preservation. Many severe critics such as Ibn al-Jawzi 
emerged who identiﬁed false reports which had been produced by deniers, 
the unthinking, the ignorant, or those who had recalled them wrongly. Later, 
learned and exacting scholars like Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti, who seventy times 
was honoured in a waking state by the presence and conversation of Allah’s 
Noble Messenger ( UWBP ), differentiated the diamonds of authentic tradi-
tions from other sayings and fabrications. 

Thus, the incidents and miracles we shall speak of, have come down to us 
through numerous, perhaps uncountable, strong and trustworthy hands, and 
have reached us in sound condition. ىّ

 It is for this reason that one’s mind should be freed from the notion that 
these incidents have been distorted or confused in any way in being passed 
down all the way from that time to the present.

First Example

T h e  F i r s t  E x a m p l e  of deﬁnite miracles concerning the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) 
increase of food through his blessing. The six accurate books of tradition, 
Bukhari and Muslim included, unanimously relate that during the feast on 
the occasion of the Noble Messenger’s ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 
marriage to Zaynab, Anas’s mother, Umm Sulaym, prepared a dish by frying 
two handfuls of dates in oil and sent it with Anas to the Messenger ( UWBP ). 
The Messenger ( UWBP ) told him: “ G o   a n d   i n v i t e   s o - a n d - s o   (   n a m i n g   s o m e  
p e r s o n s   ) ,   a n d   a l s o  
i n v i t e   w h o m e v e r   y o u   e n c o u n t e r   o n   y o u r   w a y . ”  Anas 
invited  those  named  and  those  he  met.  About  three  hundred  Companions 
came  and  ﬁlled  the  Messenger’s  ( UWBP )  room  and  anteroom.  He  said: 
ًةَرَ(cid:131)َ(cid:150) ًةَرَ(cid:131)َ(cid:150) اوُ(cid:163)َ
ّ(cid:171)َ(cid:111)َ(cid:98) “ M a k e   c i r c l e s   o f   t e n . ” He placed his blessed hand on that

little  amount  of  food,  uttered  supplications,  and  told  them  to  help  them-
selves. All of them ate and were fully satisﬁed. Afterwards the Messenger 
( UWBP ) asked Anas to remove the food. Anas later related: “ I could not 
tell if there was more of it when I set it down, or when I removed it. ” 1

Second Example

ْ(cid:202)ا 

S e c o n d   E x a m p l e :  Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) host, 
relates  that  when  the  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace ) honoured his house, he had prepared a meal for two, which would 
sufﬁce the Messenger ( UWBP ) and Abu Bakr. But the Messenger ( UWBP ) 
told him: ِرا َ(cid:135)ْ(cid:178)َ
ِفاَر ْ(cid:130)َا  ْنـِ(cid:174)  َنـ(cid:193)ِ(cid:102) َ(cid:203)َ(cid:102) ُعْدُا 2 Abu Ayyub said: “ Thirty men came 
ِ(cid:99) ِ(cid:126) ُعْدُا ‘I n v i t e   s i x t y   m e n ,’ which I did, and they also 
and ate. He then said: َنـ(cid:193)ّ
came and ate. The Prophet ( UWBP ) said again:  َنـ(cid:193) ِ(cid:151)ْ(cid:93)َ(cid:126) ُعْدُا ‘I n v i t e   s e v e n t y  
m o r e .’ I invited them; they came, and when they ﬁnished eating, there was 
still food left in the bowls. All who came embraced Islam and took the oath 
of allegiance after witnessing this miracle. One hundred and eighty men ate 
the food of two men. ” 3

Third Example

T h i r d   E x a m p l e :  It is reported through many chains of transmission from 
‘Umar b. al-Khattab, Abu Hurayra, Salama b. Akwa‘, Abu ‘Amrat al-Ansari 
and others that on one expedition, the army went hungry. They referred them-
selves to the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), and 
he told them: “ G a t h e r   w h a t e v e r   f o o d   i s   l e f t   i n   y o u r   s a d d l e - b a g s . ” Everyone 
brought a few pieces of dates and put them on a mat. The most they could 
put  together  was  four  handfuls.  Salama  related:  “ I  estimated  it  amounted 
to the size of a sitting goat. ” Then the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ) announced: “ E v e r y o n e   b r i n g   h i s   d i s h !  ” They pressed 
forward, and no one in the whole army remained with an empty dish, all the 
dishes were ﬁlled. There was even some left over. One of the Companions 
later  said:  “ I  realized  from  the  way  that  increase  was  obtained  that  if  the 
whole world had come, the food still would have been sufﬁcient. ” 4

Fourth Example

F o u r t h   E x a m p l e :  As recorded in all of the six books including Bukhari 
and  Muslim,  ‘Abd  al-Rahman  b.  Abu  Bakr  al-Siddiq  relates:  “ We,  one

hundred and thirty Companions, were with the Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) 
on an expedition. About four handfuls of dough were prepared and a goat 
was slaughtered and cooked, and its liver and kidneys roasted. I swear by 
Allah that from that roasted meat ( the liver and kidneys ) Allah’s Messenger 
( UWBP ) gave a small piece to each and put the cooked meat into two large 
bowls. After we had all eaten until we were ﬁlled there was still some left 
over, which I loaded onto a camel. ” 1

Fifth Example

F i f t h   E x a m p l e :  As is recorded in the six books, Jabir al-Ansari related 
under oath: “ During the Ahzab expedition on the celebrated day of Khandaq, 
about a thousand people ate from four handfuls of rye bread and a young 
cooked goat; yet food was still left over. That day the food had been cooked 
in my house, and after the one thousand people had left, the pot was still 
boiling  with  meat  in  it,  and  bread  was  being  made  from  the  dough;  for 
the Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) had wetted the dough and the pot with his 
blessed mouth, beseeching Allah for plenty. ” 2

Sixth Example

S i x t h   E x a m p l e :   According  to  an  authentic  narration  from  Abu  Talha, 
the uncle of Anas who served Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ), the Messenger ( UWBP ) fed seventy to eighty men with a small 
amount of rye bread that Anas had brought under his arm. The Messenger 
( UWBP )  ordered:  “ B r e a k  
i n t o   s m a l l   p i e c e s !  ”,  and  prayed  for 
increase. Because the house was small, they came ten at a time, and left hav-
ing ﬁlled themselves. 3

S e v e n t h   E x a m p l e :   It  is  related  as  authentic  in  accurate  books  such  as 
a l - S h i f a ’  a l - S h a r i f  and  M u s l i m  that Jabir al-Ansari narrated: “ Once a man 
asked the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) for food 
for his household. The Messenger ( UWBP ) gave him a half load of barley. 
For  a  long  time  he  ate  of  the  barley  together  with  his  family  and  guests. 
From time to time they would take a look at it, but it never ﬁnished. Then 
they  measured  it  to  see  how  much  it  had  decreased.  After  that  the  bless-
ing of abundance disappeared and the barley began to dwindle rapidly. The 
man  went  to  the  Messenger  ( UWBP )  and  told  him  what  had  happened.

Eighth Example

E i g h t h   E x a m p l e :   According  to  accurate  books  such  as  Tirmidhi, 
Nasa’i, Bayhaqi, and a l - S h i f a ’  a l - S h a r i f , Samura b. Jundub related that a 
bowl of meat was brought to the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ). From morning to evening, many groups of men came and 
ate from it. 2

As we explained in the introduction to this section, this is not the narra-
tion of Samura alone, since he narrated this incident on behalf of all those 
present, and with their approval.

Ninth Example

N i n t h  E x a m p l e :  It is also narrated by reliable and trusted scholars such as 
the well-known author of a l - S h i f a ’  a l - S h a r i f , Ibn Abi Shayba, and Tabarani, 
that Abu Hurayra related: “ The Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-
t h e   p o o r   M e c c a n   m i g r a n t s   w h o  
ings  and  peace )  commanded  me,  ‘I n v i t e  
h a v e   m a d e   t h e   b e n c h  ( s u f f a  ) 3 of the mosque their home and who number 
more than a hundred.’ So I went and searched for them and gathered them 
together. A tray of food was set before us, and we ate as much as we wanted, 
then we arose. The dish was as full as it had been when ﬁrst set down, only, 
there were ﬁngermarks on the food. 4

Thus,  this  incident  was  related  by  Abu  Hurayra  in  the  name  of  all  the 
People of the Bench, supported by their conﬁrmation. Hence, the incident is 
as deﬁnite as if all the People of the Bench had related it. Is it at all possible 
that  if  it  had  not  been  true  those  men  of  truth  and  perfection  would  have 
remained silent and not denied it?

T e n t h   E x a m p l e :   According  to  an  authentic  narration  from  ‘Ali,  the 
Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) once gathered the 
Bani ‘Abd al-Muttalib. They were about forty, including some who would 
eat a young camel and drink a gallon of milk at one meal. Yet for them he 
had prepared only a handful of food. All ate and were satisﬁed, and the food 
remained just as it had been before. Later he brought milk in a wooden bowl

that would have been sufﬁcent for only three or four persons. They all drank 
their ﬁll. 1

Eleventh Example

A miracle of plenty as deﬁnite as ‘Ali’s courage and loyalty!
E l e v e n t h   E x a m p l e :  According to an authentic narration, on the occa-
sion of ‘Ali’s marriage to Fatima al-Zahra, The Noble Messenger ( Upon 
whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  ordered  Bilal  al-Habashi:  “ H a v e   b r e a d  
m a d e   f r o m   a   f e w   h a n d f u l s   o f   ﬂ o u r ;   a l s o   s l a u g h t e r   a   y o u n g   c a m e l !  ” Bilal 
relates: “ I brought the food and he put his hand on it to bless it. Later, the 
Companions arrived in groups, ate, and left. From the remaining food, he 
sent a full bowl to each of his wives, saying that they should eat and feed 
anyone who visited them. ” 2

Twelfth Example

Such blessed plenty was indeed necessary for such a blessed marriage!
T w e l f t h   E x a m p l e :  Imam Ja‘far al-Sadiq related from his father Muham-
mad  al-Baqir,  and  he  from  his  father,  Zayn  al-‘Abidin,  and  he  from  ‘Ali, 
that  Fatima  al-Zahra  had  prepared  enough  food  for  herself  and  ‘Ali.  She 
then sent ‘Ali to invite the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ) to come and eat with them. Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) came and 
told them to send a dish of food to each of his wives. Fatima said that after a 
dish of food had been set aside for himself, ‘Ali, Fatima, and their children, 
they lifted up the saucepan and it was full to overﬂowing. Through Allah’s 
will, they ate of the food for a long time afterwards. 3

Why do you not believe this miracle of increase just as if you had wit-
nessed it with your own eyes, since it comes from this luminous, elevated 
chain of transmission? Satan himself could ﬁnd no excuse in the face of 
this one!

Thirteenth Example

T h i r t e e n t h   E x a m p l e :  Veracious authorities such as Abu Da’ud, Ahmad 
b. Hanbal, and Bayhaqi, narrate from Dukayn al-Ahmasi b. Sa‘id al-Muz-
ayn, and from Nu‘man b. Muqarrin al-Ahmasi al-Muzayn, who with his six 
brothers was honoured with the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) conversation and was a 
Companion, and by way of Jarir through numerous chains of transmission 
from ‘Umar b. al-Khattab, that Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be

h o r s e m e n  
f o r   a   j o u r n e y !  ”  ‘Umar 
replied: “ O Messenger of Allah! What we have in hand is the equivalent of 
a seated young camel. ” The Messenger ( UWBP ) said: “ G o   a n d   g i v e   i t   t o  
t h e m !  ” So he went and out of that half load of dates, gave the four hundred 
horsemen  sufﬁcient  provisions.  And  he  stated  that  it  remained  as  before, 
without diminishing. 1

Thus,  this  miracle  of  plenty  occurred  in  connection  with  four  hundred 
men  and  ‘Umar  in  particular.  They  are  behind  the  narrations,  support-
ing them, and their silence conﬁrms them. Do not ignore these narrations 
because they are related by a few individuals only, for if the incident had 
only been reported by a single individual, it still would have the certainty of 
‘consensus in meaning.’

Fourteenth Example

F o u r t e e n t h   E x a m p l e :  All the accurate books of tradition, and foremost 
Bukhari and Muslim, narrate that when Jabir’s father died, he was heavily in 
debt. His creditors were Jews. Jabir offered the creditors all his father’s pos-
sessions but they did not accept them. The fruit produced by his orchard over 
many years would have been insufﬁcient to defray the debt. The Noble Mes-
senger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) said: “ P i c k   a n d   g a t h e r   i n   a l l  
t h e   f r u i t   i n   t h e   o r c h a r d !  ” They did so, then the Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) 
walked around the crop and prayed. Then Jabir gave from the amount corre-
sponding to his father’s debt. What was left was as much as the annual pro-
duce of the orchard. And according to another narration, it was equal to the 
amount he gave the creditors. The Jews were amazed and astounded at this. 2
See, this clear miracle of plenty was not only reported by a few narrators 
like Jabir; many people connected with it described and narrated it, thus giv-
ing it the degree of ‘consensus in meaning.’

Fifteenth Example

F i f t e e n t h   E x a m p l e :   Exact  scholars,  and  foremost  Tirmidhi  and  Imam 
Bayhaqi,  related  through  a  sound  chain  of  authorities  from  Abu  Hurayra 
that Abu Hurayra said: “ During one expedition – that of Tabuk according to 
another narration – the army went hungry. Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon

plunged his hand into them and took a handful. He put them into a dish, and 
offered a supplication for their increase. Then he called the men in groups of 
ten and they all ate of them. Then he said:

in my hands as many dates as I had brought. Later, during the lifetime of 
the Prophet ( UWBP ), and those of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, and ‘Uthman, I ate of 
those dates. ” – It is narrated through another chain of transmission: “ I gave 
several loads of those dates to be used in Allah’s way. Later the bag contain-
ing the dates was plundered when ‘Uthman was assassinated. ”

Abu Hurayra was a constant and important student and disciple among 
the  People  of  the  Bench,  the  sacred  school  and  t e k k e   of  the  Teacher  of 
the  Universe,  the  Pride  of  the  World  ( UWBP ).  In  addition,  that  Teacher 
( UWBP ) had prayed for his strength of memory. The miracle of plenty he 
reported which occurred in a large gathering like the expedition of Tabuk, 
should therefore be as sound and certain as the word of a whole army.

Sixteenth Example

S i x t e e n t h   E x a m p l e :   Foremost  Bukhari,  and  the  accurate  books  relate 
through an authentic line of transmission that once Abu Hurayra was hun-
gry,  so  he  followed  the  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace ) into his house. There they saw that a cup of milk had been brought as 
a gift. Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) said to him: “ C a l l   a l l   t h e   P e o p l e   o f   t h e  
B e n c h !  ” Abu Hurayra relates: “ I said to myself, I could drink all the milk 
myself, as I was most in need of it. But since it was Allah’s Messenger’s 
( UWBP )  order,  I  fetched  the  People  of  the  Bench,  who  numbered  more 
than a hundred. Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) told me to offer them the milk. 
I gave the cup to each in turn, and they all drank until satisﬁed. At the end, 
the Messenger ( UWBP ) told me,  ْبَر ْ(cid:130)اَ(cid:158)  َتْ(cid:178)َاَو اَ(cid:178)َا  ُت(cid:193)ِ(cid:163)َ(cid:92) 2 As I drank, Allah’s 
Messenger ( UWBP ) kept telling me to drink more, until I said, ‘I swear by 
the Glorious One who sent you with the truth that I am too full to drink any 
more.’ Then Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) drank the rest, invoking the name 
of Allah and offering Him thanks. ” May it be a blessing for him a hundred 
thousand times!

This indubitable, manifest miracle, as pure and sweet as milk itself, is 
related by all six books with their sound narrations, and foremost Bukhari, 
who  committed  to  memory  ﬁve  hundred  thousand  Hadiths.  Moreover, 
it  is  narrated  by  a  celebrated,  loyal,  and  brilliant  student  of  the  Prophet’s 
( UWBP ) blessed school of the Bench, Abu Hurayra, who also cited as wit-
ness – rather, represented – all the other students of the Bench. Therefore, 
not  to  regard  such  a  report  as  having  the  certainty  of  ‘consensus,’  either 
one’s  heart  must  be  corrupted,  or  one’s  brain,  destroyed!  Is  it  at  all  pos-

the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  Hadiths  and  to  religion,  and  who  heard  and  him-

An Important Point

An Important Point: It is well-known that when assembled to-gether, 
weak  things  become  strong.  Fine  threads  are  twisted  and  they  become  a 
strong rope; strong ropes are wound together and no one can break them. 
In this Sign, we have shown from among ﬁfteen different kinds of miracles 
only one, that related to the blessings of increase and plenty, and the sixteen 
examples we have given constitute barely a ﬁfteenth of this one kind. How-
ever, each of the examples mentioned is a proof on its own, with enough 
strength to prove prophethood. Even if some of them – supposing the impos-
sible – were to be regarded as weak, they could still not properly be called 
such, since whatever is united with the strong also becomes strong.

When considered together, the sixteen examples given above constitute 
a great and powerful miracle through the strength of deﬁnite, indisputable 
‘consensus in meaning.’ And when this miracle is joined by fourteen other 
miracles  of  plenty  that  have  not  been  mentioned,  it  manifests  a  supreme 
miracle that is as indestructable as a bunch of strong ropes. Now add this 
supreme miracle to the fourteen other kinds of miracle, and see what a def-
inite,  decisive  and  irrefutable  proof  they  provide  for  the  prophethood  of

Muhammad ( UWBP )! Thus, the pillar of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) prophet-
hood, formed by such a collection, has the strength of a mountain. Now you 
have understood how unreasonable it is to regard as unstable and liable to 
fall that lofty, ﬁrm heaven, due to doubts arising from lack of understand-
ing  in  particular  matters  and  examples.  Certainly  those  miracles  concern-
ing increase and plenty show that Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ) was the beloved ofﬁcial and honoured servant of One 
All-Compassionate and Muniﬁcent who creates all sustenance and provides 
all beings with it, for contrary to His practice, He sent him banquets of dif-
ferent varieties of food out of nothing, from the pure Unseen.

It is well-known that the Arabian Peninsula is a place where water and 
agriculture are scarce. For this reason, its people, and particularly the Com-
panions in the early days of Islam, suffered want and scarcity. They were 
also frequently afﬂicted with thirst. Because of this, many important, evident 
miracles of Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) were related 
to food and water. Rather than being miracles proving his claim to prophet-
hood, these wonders were on account of need and like divine gifts, domini-
cal bounty, and banquets of the Most Merciful One for His Most Noble Mes-
senger ( UWBP ). For those who saw the miracles had already assented to his 
prophethood. However, as the miracles took place, their belief increased and 
became more luminous.

Introduction

This  section  describes  miracles  which  were  manifested  in  connection 

Introduction: It is known that when events that take place among groups 
of people are related individually and not contradicted by others, it indicates 
the veracity of the reports. For by virtue of his very nature, man is inclined 
to call a lie a lie. In particular since the people in question were the Compan-
ions, who were more intolerant of lies than anyone else; if the incidents con-
cerned Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), and 
if the narrator was a renowned Companion, then certainly the narrator gives 
his report on behalf of all who witnessed the incident. However, all the mira-
cles involving water that we will cite below were transmitted through many 
channels, entrusted by many Companions to thousands of precise scholars 
of the following generation, who in turn passed them down correctly to the 
great  interpreters  of  the  Law  of  the  second  century.  They  received  them 
with complete seriousness and reverence, accepted them, then handed them 
down to the exacting scholars of succeeding centuries. Hence, the traditions 

152

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

have reached our times, passing through thousands of strong, reliable hands. 
Moreover,  the  texts  of  Hadiths  written  down  in  the  Era  of  Bliss,  the  era 
of  the  Prophet,  were  handed  down  in  accurate  form  till  they  reached  the 
brilliant  scholars  of  the  science  of  Hadith  like  Bukhari  and  Muslim.  And 
they, through punctilious examination and classiﬁcation, collected together 
those that were undoubtedly authentic, and presented and taught them to us.

Thus, the ﬂowing of water from the ﬁngers of Allah’s Messenger ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) and many men drinking from it has the cer-
tainty  of  ‘consensus.’  It  is  impossible  that  the  gathering  who  narrated  it 
would  have  agreed  upon  a  lie.  The  miracle  is  most  deﬁnite.  Moreover,  it 
was repeated three times in the presence of three vast assemblies. A great 
many  accurate  scholars,  primarily,  Bukhari,  Muslim,  Imam  Malik,  Imam 
Shu‘ayb,  and  Imam  Qatada,  recorded  from  deﬁnitely  authenticated  nar-
rations  from  a  great  many  of  the  well-known  Companions,  primarily,  the 
Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  servants,  Anas,  Jabir,  and  Ibn  Mas‘ud  how  abundant 
water ﬂowed from his ﬁngers and the army drank from it. We will cite here 
only nine examples from numerous narrations about this kind of miracle.

First Example

F i r s t   E x a m p l e :   Accurate  books  of  tradition,  in  particular  Bukhari  and 
Muslim, report from an authentic narration from Anas: “ About three hun-
dred  of  us  were  together  with  Allah’s  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be 
blessings and peace ) in the place named Zawra’. He ordered us to perform 
the ablution for the afternoon prayer, but we could ﬁnd no water. So he told 
us to bring a little water, which we did, and he dipped his auspicious hands 
into it. I saw water ﬂow from his ﬁngers like a fountain. His three hundred 
men performed the ablution with the water and drank from it. ” 1

Anas relates this incident in the name of three hundred men. Is it possible 
that those three hundred people did not in effect assent to it, or in the event 
of their not assenting to it, not deny it?

Second Example

S e c o n d   E x a m p l e :  As narrated in accurate books, and foremost Bukhari 
and Muslim, Jabir b. ‘Abdullah al-Ansari said: “ We were one thousand ﬁve 
hundred men on the Hudaybiyya expedition, and we were thirsty. The Noble 
Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) performed the ablutions 
from  a  leather  water-bag  called  a  q i r b a ,  then  he  dipped  his  hand  into  it.

I saw that water was ﬂowing from his ﬁngers like a spring. The one thousand 
ﬁve hundred men drank from it and ﬁlled their water-bags. ” Once, Salim b. 
Abi’l-Ja‘d asked Jabir: “ How many of you were there? ” He replied: “ The 
water would have been enough even if there had been a hundred thousand 
people, but we were ﬁfteen hundred. ” 1

Thus, the narrators of this clear miracle in effect number one thousand 
ﬁve hundred, for it is in man’s nature to reject lies. As for the Companions, 
who sacriﬁced their tribes and peoples, their fathers and mothers, their lives 
and all they possessed for the sake of truth and veracity, and could not have 
remained  silent  in  the  face  of  a  lie,  especially  in  the  light  of  the  warning 
given by the tradition, “ W h o e v e r   k n o w i n g l y   t e l l s   a   l i e   c o n c e r n i n g   m e   s h o u l d  
p r e p a r e   f o r   a   s e a t   i n   H e l l - ﬁ r e . ” Since they remained silent concerning this 
report, they accepted it, in effect joined Jabir, and conﬁrmed him.

Third Example

T h i r d   E x a m p l e :   Again  as  related  in  the  accurate  books  of  Hadith  and 
foremost  Bukhari  and  Muslim,  Jabir  reported:  “ During  the  Buwat  expe-
dition,  the  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  com-
manded:  ِءو ُ(cid:138)ُوْ(cid:170)اِ(cid:92) ِداَ(cid:178) ‘C a l l   f o r   t h e   a b l u t i o n s ! ’ They said there was no water. 
He said, ‘F i n d   a   s m a l l   a m o u n t ! ’ We brought a very small amount. He held

put his hands in the trough and spread his ﬁngers. I poured that very small 
amount of water onto his blessed hands, and I saw that abundant water was 
ﬂowing from his blessed ﬁngers and ﬁlling the trough. Then I summoned 
those who needed water. When they had all performed the ablutions with 
the water and drunk from it, I told the Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) that there 
was no one else. He lifted his hands, leaving the trough full to the brim. ” 2
This  clear  miracle  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP )  has  the  certainty  of  ‘con-
sensus  in  meaning,’  for  since  Jabir  was  prominent  in  the  matter,  he  had 
the right to recount it and proclaim it in everyone else’s name. Ibn Mas‘ud 
relates exactly the same thing in his narration: “ I saw water ﬂowing from 
the ﬁngers of Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) as 
from a spring. ” 3 If a truthful, well-known group of Companions composed

of Anas, Jabir, and Ibn Mas‘ud said: “ We have seen it, ” is it possible that 
they should not have seen it? Now combine these three examples and see 
how powerful and manifest a miracle it was, and how, if the three chains of 
transmission are combined, it proves the ﬂowing of water from his ﬁngers 
like ‘true consensus.’ Indeed, even Moses’ making water ﬂow from twelve 
different  places  in  a  rock  cannot  be  equated  with  the  water  ﬂowing  from 
Muhammad’s ten ﬁngers, for water may gush out of rock – examples are 
commonplace – but there is no equivalent of, no parallel for, water ﬂowing 
in abundance, like from the Spring of Kawthar, from ﬂesh and bone.

Fourth Example

F o u r t h  E x a m p l e :  Foremost Imam Malik in his esteemed book, Muwatta’, 
relates from the renowned Companion Mu‘adh b. Jabal: “ During the Tabuk 
expedition we came across a spring ﬂowing as meagrely as a piece of ﬁne 
string. The Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) ordered: 
‘C o l l e c t   a   l i t t l e   o f   t h e   w a t e r ! ’  They  collected  some  in  the  palms  of  their 
hands.  Allah’s  Messenger  ( UWBP )  washed  his  hands  and  face  in  it,  and 
we returned it to the spring. Suddenly the outlet of the spring opened up and 
water gushed forth; it was sufﬁcient for the whole army. ”

Another narrator, even, Imam Ibn Ishaq, stated: “ The water gushed forth 
from the spring under the earth making a roar like thunder. Allah’s Noble 
Messenger told Mu‘adh: 

اً(cid:178)اَ(cid:179) ِ(cid:106)  َئِ(cid:171)ُ(cid:174) ْدَ(cid:162) اَ(cid:179)ُ(cid:182) اَ(cid:182) اَ(cid:174) ىَرَ(cid:98) ْنَا ٌةاَ(cid:193)َ(cid:110)

Fifth Example

F i f t h   E x a m p l e :   Foremost  Bukhari  relates  from  al-Bara’,  and  Muslim 
from Salama b. Akwa‘, and other authentic books of Hadith from other nar-
rators,  unanimously  relate:  “ During  the  Hudaybiyya  expedition  we  came 
across a well. We numbered four hundred while the water in the well was 
barely sufﬁcient for ﬁfty. We drew the water and left nothing. Then Allah’s 
Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) came and sat at the head of 
the well. He asked for a bucket of water and we fetched one. He put some of 
his blessed spittle into the bucket and prayed, then poured the water into the 
well. Suddenly the well gushed and frothed with water, ﬁlling to the top. The 
whole army drank their ﬁll and watered their animals. They also replenished 
their water-bags. ” 2

He took the bag and placed his lips on its mouth. I do not know whether or 
not he blew into it. Then seventy-two men came and drank from the bag and

me and ‘Ali: ‘T h e r e   i s   a   w o m a n   i n   s u c h - a n d - s u c h   a   p l a c e   t o g e t h e r   w i t h   h e r

increase. He then commanded everyone to come to ﬁll his water-bag. All the 
men came, drank, and ﬁlled their water-bags. Afterwards he gave an order to 
collect something for the woman, and they ﬁlled her skirt. ” ‘Imran said: “ I

( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  to  pray.  The  Messenger  ( UWBP ) 
raised  his  hands,  and  before  he  had  lowered  them  clouds  gathered,  and 
such rain fell that we ﬁlled our containers. Then the rain stopped, and it had 
not fallen beyond the limits of the army. ”  1 That is to say, no chance was 
involved in the incident; it was purely a miracle of Muhammad ( UWBP ).

Ninth Example

N i n t h  E x a m p l e :  Relating from ‘Amr b. Shu‘ayb, the grandson of ‘Abdul-
lah b. ‘Amr b. al-‘As, on whom they relied for explanations of Hadiths, the 
Four Imams narrated – from a sound narration: “ Before his prophetic mis-
sion, the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) once came 
by camel with his uncle Abu Talib to the place called Dhu’l-Hijaz near ‘Ara-
fat. Abu Talib said he was thirsty. The Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ) dismounted from the camel and struck the ground with his foot. 
Water gushed out and Abu Talib drank from it. ” 2

One  of  the  researchers,  however,  stated  that  this  incident  should  be 
included in the category of i r h a s a t , 3 for it occurred before his prophethood. 
But since ever afterwards the spring of ‘Arafat ﬂowed from the spot, it may 
be considered a wonder of Muhammad ( UWBP ).

Similar  to  these  nine  examples,  ninety  different  narrations  –  if  not 
ninety  instances  –  have  reported  miracles  concerning  water.  The  ﬁrst 
seven examples are as sound and deﬁnite as ‘consensus in meaning.’ For 
sure the last two are not supported by the narrations of numerous narra-
tors or a strong chain of transmitters, but supporting and conﬁrming the 
incident mentioned in the eighth example as narrated by ‘Umar, is another 
miracle reported by the authentic books of Hadith, including Bayhaqi and 
al-Hakim; it is as follows: 

“ ‘Umar requested of Allah’s Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) that he should 
pray  for  rain,  because  the  army  was  in  need  of  water.  The  Messenger 
( UWBP ) raised his hands, and at once clouds gathered and rain fell, enough 
for the army’s needs, then they dispersed. ” 4 It was quite simply as though 
they were ofﬁcials charged with watering the army; they came, poured down 
sufﬁcient for its needs, then went.

This narration corroborates the eighth example and proves it decisively. 
So too, the famous learned scholar, Ibn al-Jawzi, who was extremely fas-
tidious in verifying Hadiths even rejecting as spurious many authentic ones, 
said that this event took place, but at the famous Battle of Badr. 1 He said that 
it  is  referred  to  by  the  verse,  ( 8:11 )  M L K J I H G 
Since that is the case, no doubt can remain concerning its certainty. Further-
more, rain fell on many occasions when the Prophet ( UWBP ) prayed for it, 
suddenly, swiftly, before he lowered his hands; it was on its own a miracle 
about which the reports are unanimous. It is also narrated unanimously that 
several times he raised his hands while in the pulpit and that rain fell before 
he lowered them. 2

NINTH SIGN

One  of  the  various  kinds  of  miracles  of  Allah’s  Most  Noble  Messen-
ger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) is that like human beings, trees 
obeyed his orders, and moving from their places, came to him. There is also 
‘consensus in meaning’ concerning the reports of these miracles, like those 
of  water  ﬂowing  from  his  ﬁngers.  They  have  been  narrated  in  numerous 
forms  and  through  numerous  channels.  Indeed,  the  consensus  concerning 
trees leaving their places and coming to him may be regarded as clear and 
unambiguous,  3  because  the  best-known  of  the  Companions  such  as  ‘Ali, 
Ibn ‘Abbas, Ibn Mas‘ud, Ibn ‘Umar, Ya‘la b. Murra, Jabir, Anas b. Malik, 
Burayda, Usama b. Zayd, and Ghaylan b. Salama all reported the same mira-
cle with certainty. Hundreds of scholars of the succeeding generation nar-
rated  the  miracle  from  one  of  the  above-mentioned  Companions  through 
a different line of transmission, as though transmitting it to us in the form 
of ‘multiple consensus.‘ Thus, this miracle of the trees has decisively and 
indisputably the certainty of ‘consensus in meaning.’ We will now cite only 
a few examples of it, although it was repeated many times.

First Example

F i r s t   E x a m p l e :  Foremost, Imam Maja, and al-Darimi narrate from Anas

Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ). He asked the tree three times to testify; each 
time it testiﬁed to his truthfulness. When he ordered, it went back and settled 
in its place. ” 1

According  to  the  authentic  narration  of  Ibn  Sahib  al-Aslami,  Burayda 
reports: “ When we were with the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-

F o u r t h   E x a m p l e :  Usama b. Zayd, one the brave commanders and serv-
ants of the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), reports 
in  an  authentic  narration:  “ We  were  together  with  Allah’s  Messenger  on 
an expedition. There was no secluded, private place in which to answer the 
call of nature. He asked: ٍةَراَ(cid:107) ِ(cid:110) ْوَا  ٍلْ(cid:115)َ(cid:178)  ْنـِ(cid:174) ىَرَ(cid:98)  ْلَ(cid:182)  I replied: ‘Yes, I can.’ He

These two incidents, which were reported by Jabir and Usama, were also 
reported by Ya‘la b. Murra, Ghaylan b. Salama al-Thaqaﬁ, and Ibn Mas‘ud, 
but as referring to the Battle of Hunayn. 2

Fifth Example

F i f t h   E x a m p l e :  Reported by Imam b. Fawrak, known for his excellence 
in interpretation as the foremost scholar of his time and the second Shaﬁ‘i: 
“ While travelling on horseback one night during the Ta’if expedition, sleep 
overcame Allah’s Noble Messenger ( UWBP ). While in that state a lote-tree 
loomed up before him. To make way for him and not to hurt his horse, the 
tree split in two, and the Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) passed between the two 
parts of the tree on the horse. ” The tree has remained with two trunks, in that 
honoured position, up to our time. 3

Sixth Example

S i x t h  E x a m p l e :  Ya‘la b. Murra relates in an authentic narration: “ During

Allah’s Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) as if circumambulating, and went back

Seventh Example

S e v e n t h   E x a m p l e :  Scholars of Hadith relate from Ibn Mas‘ud with an 
authentic narration: “ When, seeking guidance, the jinn of Nusaybin came 
to  the  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  in  the 
place  called  Batn  al-Nakhl,  a  tree  informed  him  of  their  coming. ”  Also, 
Imam  Mujahid  relates  from  Ibn  Mas‘ud  in  the  same  Hadith:  “ The  jinn 
asked  for  a  proof  of  his  prophethood,  so  the  Noble  Messenger  ( UWBP ) 
commanded the tree, and it left its place, came to him, then returned to its 
place. ”  5  That  single  miracle  was  sufﬁcient  for  the  race  of  jinns.  So  if  a 
human being does not come to believe having heard of a thousand miracles 
like this one, is he not more of a devil than those described by the jinn as,

E i g h t h   E x a m p l e :  Tirmidhi reports in his Sahih from Ibn ‘Abbas through 
a sound line of transmission: “ Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ) asked a beduin: 

ّ(cid:195)ا ُلو ُ(cid:126)َر ىّ

ِ(cid:178)َا ُدَ(cid:183) ْ(cid:131)َ(cid:98)َا ِةَ(cid:171)ْ(cid:115)َ

‘Wi l l   y o u   t e s t i f y   t h a t   I   a m   t h e   M e s s e n g e r   o f   A l l a h   i f   a   b r a n c h   o f   t h a t   t r e e   c o m e s   t o   m e  
w h e n   I   c a l l   t o   i t ?’ He replied: ‘Yes.’ The Messenger ( UWBP ) called to the 
branch. It broke off and jumped over near him, then jumped back when he 
told it to do so. ” 1

There are many other examples similar to these eight that are narrated 
through many chains of transmission. Seven or eight strands of rope form 
a strong cable when they are put together. Similarly, the miracles related to 
trees, which were reported on the authority of the best-known and most vera-
cious Companions in thus numerous chains of transmission, certainly have 
the  strength  of  ‘consensus  in  meaning,‘  indeed,  ‘true  consensus.’  In  fact, 
they take on the form of ‘consensus’ when passed down by the Companions 
to the following generation. In particular, the accurate books of Hadith such 
as Bukhari, Muslim, Ibn Hibban, and Tirmidhi, ensured that the chains of 
authorities leading back to the time of the Companions were so sound, and 
they kept them thus, that reading a Hadith, say in Bukhari, is like hearing it 
directly from the Companions. 

If,  as  seen  in  the  above  examples,  trees  recognize  Allah’s  Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) testify to his prophethood, visit and 
salute him, and obey his orders, aren’t those lifeless, unreasoning creatures 
who call themselves human beings yet do not recognize him or believe in 
him, more worthless than a dead tree? Do they not resemble pieces of wood, 
ﬁt for the ﬁre? 

TENTH SIGN

Corroborating the miracles concerning trees and reported in the form of 

‘consensus,’ is the miracle of the 

ِعْذ ِ(cid:107)ْ(cid:170)ا ُنـ(cid:193)ِ(cid:179)َ(cid:110) . Yes, the pole’s moaning in 

the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) mosque before a vast crowd because of its tempo-
rary  separation  from  him  both  conﬁrms  and  corroborates  the  instances  of 
miracles related to trees. For the pole also was of wood; their substance was 
the same. However, although there is a consensus of opinion concerning the

reports of this miracle, the other miracles are unanimously agreed upon only 
as a class; there is mostly no clear consensus about them individually or as 
separate instances.

When  delivering  the  sermon  in  the  mosque,  Allah’s  Noble  Messenger 
( UWBP ) used to lean against a pole consisting of a date-palm. But when 
the pulpit was made, he began to give the sermon from there. Whereupon the 
pole moaned and wailed like a camel; the whole congregation heard it. Only 
when the Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) came 
down from the pulpit, and placed his hand on it, speaking to it and consoling 
it, did the pole stop moaning. 1 This miracle of Muhammad ( UWBP ) was 
narrated through numerous chains of transmission, and there was agreement 
concerning it.

Indeed, the miracle of the 

ِعْذ ِ(cid:107)ْ(cid:170)ا ُنـ(cid:193)ِ(cid:179)َ(cid:110) is very widely known and there is 

‘true consensus ( h a k i k î   m ü t e v a t i r  )’ concerning it. 2 Hundreds of authorities 
on  Hadith  of  the  subsequent  generation  narrated  the  miracle  through  ﬁf-
teen chains of transmission 3 from an illustrious group of Companions, and 
passed it down to succeeding centuries. From that group, eminent scholars 
among the Companions and leading experts on Hadith such as Anas b. Malik 
4 and Jabir b. ‘Abdullah al-Ansari 5 – both servants of the Prophet ( UWBP ), 
‘Abdullah b. ‘Umar, 6 ‘Abdullah b. ‘Abbas, 7 Sahl b. Sa‘d, 8 Abu Sa‘id al-
Khudri,  9 Ubayy b. Ka‘b,  10 Burayda,  11 and Umm Salama, the Mother of

miracle to the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) community. Foremost Bukhari, Muslim, 
and the authentic books of Hadith gave accounts of this great miracle, which 
were unanimously accepted, together with its lines of transmission for suc-
ceeding generations.

Jabir,  in  his  chain  of  transmission,  says:  “ Allah’s  Messenger  ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) used to lean against a wooden pole called the

endure it when the pulpit was made and the Messenger ( UWBP ) used that 
for the sermon, and it began to moan and wail like a pregnant camel. ” In his 
narration, Anas says: “ It moaned like a water-buffalo causing the mosque to 
tremble. ” In his narration, Sahl b. Sa‘d says: “ The people started weeping 
and crying when the pole was moaning. ” In his narration, Ubayy b. Ka‘b 
says:  “ It  wept  so  much  it  split. ”  While  in  another  narration,  1  the  Noble

of the great authorities on theology, narrated: “ Allah’s Messenger ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) did not go to the pole, but it came to him, at 
his command. Then, at his command, it returned to its place. ”  1 Ubayy b. 
Ka‘b says: “ After this extraordinary event, Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ) ordered that the pole be put under the pulpit. It was 
put there and remained there until the mosque was pulled down before being 
rebuilt. Then Ubayy b. Ka‘b took it and kept it until it decayed. 2

The  famous  scholar  Hasan  al-Basri  would  weep  while  teaching  this 
miraculous event to his students, and say to them: “ A piece of wood dem-
onstrated love and longing for Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ), so you should feel more love than that. ” 3 As for us, 
we say, Yes, and love and longing for him is shown through following his 
illustrious Practices ( Sunna ) and sacred Shari‘a.

An Important Point
I f   i t   i s   a s k e d :  Why were the miracles that were displayed in connection 
with food – to satisfy fully a thousand men with four handfuls of food in 
the Battle of Khandaq, and another thousand men with water ﬂowing from 
the  Messenger’s  ( UWBP )  blessed  ﬁngers  –  not  narrated  through  numer-
ous chains of transmission as the miracle of the moaning of the pole was, 
although the former two miracles occurred in the presence of larger crowds?
T h e   A n s w e r :   The  miracles  that  were  manifested  were  of  two  kinds: 
one  were  manifested  at  the  hands  of  Allah’s  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be 
blessings  and  peace )  in  order  to  make  people  assent  to  his  prophethood. 
The  moaning  of  the  pole  was  of  that  kind.  It  occurred  solely  as  a  proof, 
an afﬁrmation, of prophethood, to increase the believers’ faith, to urge the 
dissemblers  to  sincerity  and  belief,  and  to  bring  to  belief  the  unbelievers. 
That is why everyone, the low and the high, saw it, and great attention was 
paid to broadcasting it. However, the miracles concerning food and water 
were wonders rather than miracles, or divine favours rather than wonders, 
or, more than favour, they were banquets bestowed by the All-Merciful One 
because of need. For sure, they were proofs of his claim to prophethood and 
miracles,  but  their  basic  aim  was  this:  the  army  was  hungry  so  Almighty 
Allah provided a feast for a thousand men out of a handful of food from His 
treasury in the Unseen, just as He creates a thousand pounds of dates from a 
single seed. And for a thirsty army ﬁghting in His way, He caused water to

ﬂow like the water of Kawthar from the ﬁngers of its Commander-in-Chief, 
and gave them to drink.

It is for this reason that all the examples of the miracles concerning food 
and water do not attain the degree of the miracle of the moaning of the pole. 
However, in their entirety, the various kinds of those two miracles are as 
numerous  and  unanimously  reported  as  the  moaning  of  the  pole.  Moreo-
ver, not everyone could see the increase of food and water ﬂowing from his 
ﬁngers; they could only see the results. Whereas everyone heard the pole 
moaning, so it was more widely broadcast.

I f   i t   i s   a s k e d :  All the actions and conduct of Allah’s Messenger ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) were recorded and transmitted by his Com-
panions  with  extreme  care.  Why  then  were  such  great  miracles  only  nar-
rated through ten or twenty chains of transmission, when they should have 
been narrated through a hundred? Also, why were many narrated from Anas, 
Jabir, and Abu Hurayra, and few related from Abu Bakr and ‘Umar?

The Answer: The answer to the ﬁrst part of the question has been given 
in the Third Principle in the Fourth Sign. Regarding the second part: just as 
someone in need of medicine goes to a doctor, mathematicians are consulted 
on mathematical problems, and questions to do with the Shari‘a are asked 
of the Mufti, and so on; so too, some of the scholars among the Compan-
ions were charged with the duty of instructing succeeding centuries in the 
Hadiths  of  the  Prophet,  working  with  all  their  strength  for  this  end.  Yes, 
Abu Hurayra devoted his entire life to memorizing Hadiths, while ‘Umar 
was occupied with the world of politics and the caliphate. ‘Umar therefore 
narrated  very  few  traditions,  relying  on  persons  like  Abu  Hurayra,  Anas, 
and Jabir, to teach the Hadiths to the Muslim community. Furthermore, on 
a  well-known,  truthful,  sincere,  honest,  and  trusted  Companion  reporting 
an  incident  through  one  chain,  it  was  regarded  as  sufﬁcient,  and  no  need 
remained for anyone else to narrate it. This is why some signiﬁcant events 
were narrated through only two or three chains of transmission.

transmission, Abu Dharr al-Ghifari says: “ Then he put them into ‘Umar’s 
hand, and again they gloriﬁed Allah. Then he took them and put them on

E i g h t h   E x a m p l e :   This  is  the  famous  story  of  the  well-known  monk 
Bahira. Before the beginning of his prophethood, Allah’s Noble Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) was travelling towards Damascus to 
trade  together  with  his  uncle  Abu  Talib  and  some  of  the  Quraysh.  They 
rested when they came near the church of Bahira the monk. Bahira, who was 
a hermit and did not mix with people, suddenly came out. He saw Muham-
mad  the  Trustworthy  ( UWBP )  among  the  caravan,  and  said:  “ He  is  the 
Lord  of  the  World;  he  will  be  a  prophet. ”  The  Quraysh  asked:  “ How  do 
you know? ” The holy monk replied: “ I saw a small cloud over the caravan 
as you were coming. When you sat down, the cloud moved toward him and 
cast its shadow over him. I also saw trees and rocks prostrate themselves 
before him, which they only do before prophets. ” 1

There are at least eighty examples similar to these eight instances. When 
they are put together, they form a chain so strong that no doubt can break 
it or shake it. Taken as a whole, this sort of miracle, that is, the speaking of 
inanimate beings in order to testify to Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) prophethood, 
expresses  the  same  certainty  as  ‘consensus  in  meaning.’  Each  example  is 
strengthened  by  the  whole.  Yes,  a  slender  pole  becomes  strong  when  put 
together with stout poles. If he joins the army and becomes a soldier, a weak, 
powerless man gains strength enough to challenge a thousand men.

ﬁlling it with a very strong poison. She then sent it to Allah’s Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). The Companions had begun to eat

eaten a single morsel and died from the effects of the severe poison. The 
Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) sent for the Jewess 
called Zaynab and asked her why she had done it. The inauspicious woman 
retorted: “ I considered that if you were a prophet, it would not harm you; 
and if you were a king, I would save the people from you. ” 2 According to 
some narrations, the Prophet ( UWBP ) did not have her put to death, but left 
her to Bishr’s family to be killed. 3 Now listen to a few points demonstrating 
aspects of the miraculousness in this extraordinary incident:

The Second: According to another, Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) said: 

ّ(cid:195)ا  ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) 

“ S a y,  
‘Asqalani does not accept this narration, but others do.

t h e   p o i s o n   w i l l   n o t   a f f e c t   y o u . ”  1  Ibn  Hajar  al-

The Third: The treacherous Jews wanted to deal a sudden blow at Allah’s 
Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  and  his  close  Compan-
ions, but being informed about this from the Unseen, the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) 
warning proved true, and their plot was uncovered and brought to naught. 
And when Muhammad ( UWBP ), from whom the Companions never heard 
an untrue statement, said: “ This goat tells me that...,  ” everyone believed 
him with conviction as sure as if they themselves had heard the goat. 2

Third Example

T h i r d  E x a m p l e :  This consists of three instances of another miracle which 

resembles the Shining Hand and Staff of Moses:

The First: Imam Ahmad b. Hanbal, explaining and authenticating a nar-
ration from Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri, reports: “ One dark and stormy night, the 
Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) gave Qatada b. al-
Nu‘man a staff, saying: ‘T h i s   s t a f f   w i l l   l i g h t   u p   t e n   y a r d s   a l l   a r o u n d   y o u .   Yo u  
w i l l   s e e   a   d a r k   s h a d o w   w h e n   y o u   a r r i v e   a t   y o u r   h o u s e ;   i t   i s   S a t a n .   T h r o w  
h i m   o u t   o f   t h e   h o u s e   a n d   d r i v e   h i m   a w a y ! ’ Qatada took the staff and set off. 
It cast a light like Moses’ shining hand. He came to his house, where he saw 
the shadowy ﬁgure, and he drove it away. ” 3

The Second: While ﬁghting the idolators during the great Battle of Badr, 
itself a source of wonders, ‘Ukkasha b. Muhassin al-Asadi had his sword 
broken.  Allah’s  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace ) 
gave him a stout staff in place of it, saying: “ Fight with this! ” Suddenly, 
with Allah’s leave, the staff became a long white sword, and he fought with 
it. He carried the sword on his person for the rest of his life until he fell as 
a martyr during the Battle of al-Yamama. 4 This incident is certain, because 
throughout his life he carried the sword with pride and it became famous 
with the name of Succour. Thus, two proofs of this incident are ‘Ukkasha’s 
pride, and the sword’s name, Succour and its widespread fame.

The Third: It is narrated by authorities on Hadith like Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr, 1 
a celebrated scholar known as the Scholar of the Age, that at the Battle of 
Uhud  the  sword  of  ‘Abdullah  b.  Jahsh,  a  cousin  of  the  Allah’s  Messen-
ger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace ),  was  broken.  The  Messenger 
( UWBP ) gave him a staff and it turned into a sword in his hand. He fought 
with it, and after the battle that product of a miracle remained a sword. 2

In his  S i y a r , the well-known Ibn Sayyid al-Nas reports that some time 
later ‘Abdullah sold the sword to a man called Bugha’ al-Turki for two hun-
dred  l i r a s .  3  Thus  these  two  swords  were  each  miracles  like  the  Staff  of 
Moses.  But  while  no  aspect  of  miraculousness  remained  in  his  staff  after 
Moses’ death, these swords remained unchanged.
THIRTEENTH SIGN

Another of the miracles of Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace )  of  which  there  are  numerous  instances,  which  are  reported  unani-
mously, is the sick and the wounded being healed through his blessed breath. 
The reports of this kind of miracle are, as a whole, unanimous in meaning. 
Some  of  the  instances  of  these  miracles  also  are  considered  to  be  unani-
mous in meaning. And if the others are single reports, since they have been 
rendered and conﬁrmed as authentic by the exacting authorities of the sci-
ence of Hadith, they afford the certainty of science. We shall mention a few 
instances of the miracles out of many.

First Example

F i r s t   E x a m p l e :  The learned scholar of the Maghrib, Qadi Iyad, in his a l -
S h i f a ’ a l - S h a r i f , narrates through an elevated chain of authorities and numer-
ous lines of transmission that Sa‘d b. Abi Waqqas, the Noble Messenger’s 
( UWBP ) servant and commander, and commander-in-chief of the army of 
Islam in the time of ‘Umar, the conqueror of Iran, and one of the ten prom-
ised Paradise, said: “ I was at the Noble Messenger’s ( UWBP ) side during 
the Battle of Uhud. He shot arrows at the unbelievers until his bow broke. 
Then he gave arrows to me, telling me to shoot them. The arrows he gave 
me were without ﬂights, that is, without the feathers which help them ﬂy. 
He was ordering me to shoot them, which I did, and they ﬂew like ﬂighted 
arrows, hitting the unbelievers’ bodies and piercing them. ” 4 At that point,

Qatada b. Nu‘man was hit in the eye by an arrow; it was struck out of his 
head, so that it was sitting on the side of his face. Allah’s Messenger ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) took the eye in his blessed, healing hand and 
placed it in its socket; it was healed as though nothing had happened to it and 
became the better of his two eyes. This event became very widely known. A 
grandson of Qatada, even, once described himself to ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-‘Aziz 
as, “ I am the grandson of one who, when Allah’s Most Noble Messenger 
( UWBP ) placed his eye back in its socket after it had been struck out, it was 
suddenly healed and became his best eye. ” 1 He said this in verse, introduc-
ing himself to ‘Umar in that way.

It  is  also  related  through  an  authentic  narration  that  during  the  battle 
known as the Ya w m   D h i - Q a r a d , Abu Qatada was hit in the face by an arrow. 
Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) touched his face 
with his blessed hand. Abu Qatada said: “ I felt no pain at all, nor did the 
wound fester. ” 2

Second Example

S e c o n d   E x a m p l e :  The authentic books of Hadith, and foremost Bukhari 
and Muslim, report that the Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) had appointed ‘Ali 
al-Haydari as standard-bearer during the Battle of Khaybar, but his eyes were 
aching severly due to illness. The moment the Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) 
applied his healing spittle to his eyes, they were cured, with no trace of the 
discomfort remaining. 3 The following morning, ‘Ali conquered the citadel 
of Khaybar by removing its extremely heavy gate and using it in his hand as 
a shield. During the same battle, Salama b. al-Akwa‘’s leg was struck and 
split open by a sword; Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) breathed onto it, and the 
leg was at once healed. 4

Third Example

T h i r d   E x a m p l e :   Authorities  on  the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  life,  and  fore-
most Nasa’i, report from ‘Uthman b. Hunayf, who said: “ A blind man came

A Passage Worthy of Being Written
in Gold and Diamonds 

Yes,  it  was  mentioned  above:  small  stones  glorifying  and 
praising Allah in his hand; and in accordance with the verse, 
( 8:17 )  - , + * ) ( '  earth  and  small 
stones  in  the  same  hand  becoming  missiles  and  projectiles

hand; and water flowing like a spring from the ten fingers of the 
same hand, and their providing a whole army with water; and 
the same hand being healing to the sick and wounded—all this 
shows what a wondrous miracle of Divine Power that blessed 
hand was. It was as if for friends its palm was a small place for 
the remembrance of Allah, for as soon as small stones entered 
it, they glorified Allah and recited His Names; while in the 
face  of  enemies,  it  was  a  small  dominical  ammunitions  store 
which when pebbles and earth entered it, they were transformed 
into missiles and projectiles. And for the sick and the wounded 
it was a small pharmacy of the Most Merciful One which 
was a cure for whatever ills it touched. When it rose with Glory, 
it split the moon, giving it the shape of two bows, while when it 
was lowered with Beauty, it became like a spring of mercy with 
ten spigots pouring forth the water of Kawthar. If the single 
hand of such a one is the means of those wondrous miracles, is 
it not then to be understood clearly how acceptable he is before 
the Creator of the Universe, and how loyal he is to his cause, 
and how fortunate are those who declare their allegiance to him?

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

Imam Jalil b. Wahab also reports: “ During that same battle, Hubayb b. 
Yasaf was struck on the shoulder by a sword so that he received a griev-
ous wound with part of it almost severed. The Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) 
joined the arm and shoulder back together again and breathed on it, and it 
was healed. 1

Thus, for sure these two incidents are separate, single reports, but if an 
authority like Ibn Wahab considered them to be sound, and if they occurred 
during a battle like that of Badr, which was a spring of miracles, and if there 
were many other examples that resembled these two incidents, for sure it 
may be said that they deﬁnitely occurred. Indeed, there are perhaps a thou-
sand examples established in authentic traditions for which the blessed hand 
of Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) was healing.

A   Q u e s t i o n :  You describe many things as being reported unanimously 
through many channels, but we are hearing most of them for the ﬁrst time. 
Surely something the various reports of which are numerous and unanimous 
cannot remain thus secret?

T h e   A n s w e r :  There are numerous things concerning the reports of which 
there is a consensus and which are self-evident to the learned scholars of the 
Shari‘a, but are unknown to those who are not one of them. For the schol-
ars  of  Hadith  there  are  many  such  things,  which  for  poets  have  not  even 
the status of isolated reports, and so on. The specialists of all the sciences 
explain  the  theories  and  axioms  of  their  science,  and  the  ordinary  people 
rely on them and either submit to them, or become one of them and see for 
themselves. Now, the events the reports of which we describe as forming 
‘true  consensus,‘  ‘consensus  in  meaning,’  or  which  express  certainty  like 
consensus, have been shown to be thus by both the scholars of Hadith, and 
the scholars of the Shari‘a, and the scholars of the principles of religion, and 
by most of the other levels of the ‘ulama. If ordinary people in their heed-
lessness or the ignorant who close their eyes to the truth do not know this, 
the fault is theirs.

Fifth Example

F i f t h   E x a m p l e :  Having explained and authenticated it, Imam Baghawi 
relates: “ At the Battle of Khandaq, ‘Ali b. al-Hakam’s leg was broken by 
the blow of an unbeliever. The Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ) rubbed it. At the moment he did so, it was healed so that ‘Ali b. 
al-Hakam did not even dismount from his horse. ” 2

Seventh Example

S e v e n t h   E x a m p l e :  This is the well-known story of Shurahbil al-Ju‘ﬁ. He 
had a morbid growth on the palm of his hand so that he could hold neither 
his  sword  nor  the  reins  of  his  horse.  Allah’s  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be 
blessings and peace ) rubbed the growth with his blessed hand and massaged 
it; not a trace of it remained. 2

Eighth Example

E i g h t h   E x a m p l e :  Six children, each the object of a different miracle of 

Muhammad ( UWBP ):

The  First:  Ibn  Abi  Shayba,  a  meticulous  researcher  and  well-known 
scholar of Hadith, relates that a woman brought her child to Allah’s Mes-
senger ( UWBP ). The child had an afﬂiction; he could not speak and was an 
idiot. Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) rinsed his mouth with water and washed 
his  hands,  then  gave  the  water  to  the  woman,  telling  her  to  give  it  to  the 
child to drink. After the child had drunk it, nothing remained of his illness 
and afﬂiction, and he became so intelligent, he surpassed even the brightest 
of the rest. 3

The Second: According to an authentic narration, Ibn ‘Abbas said: “ An 
insane child was brought to the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-
ings  and  peace ).  He  placed  his  blessed  hand  on  the  child’s  chest  and  the 
child suddenly vomited a small black object like a cucumber. The child was 
healed and went home. ” 4

( UWBP ) touched the arm, spreading his spittle over it; the same instant it 
was healed. 1

The Fourth: A child who was not young but was mute came to the Noble 
Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). He asked the child: “ W h o  
ّ(cid:195)ا ُلو ُ(cid:126)َر  َتْ(cid:178)َا and 
a m   I ?  ” The child, who had been mute from birth, replied: ِ
started to speak. 2

The Fifth: Jalal al-Din Suyuti, who was honoured with conversing with 
Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) on many occasions 
while awake and was the leading scholar of his age, explaining and authen-
ticating a narration, reports: Soon after being born, a famous person called 
Mubarak al-Yamama was taken to the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ). On his turning to the baby, it started to speak, saying: 
ّ(cid:195)ا ُلو ُ(cid:126)َر 
ّ(cid:178)َا ُدَ(cid:183) ْ(cid:130)َا The Messenger ( UWBP ) exclaimed: “ M a y   A l l a h   b l e s s  
y o u !  ” The child never spoke again in his infancy, and later became famous 
as Mubarak al-Yamama ( the blessed one, Yamama ), since he had been the 
object of this miracle of the Prophet ( UWBP ) and his prayer. 3

َكـَ

The  Sixth:  One  time,  an  ill-mannered  youth  interrupted  the  prayer  of 
the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), by passing in 
front of him while he was performing it. Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) said: 
ّمُ(cid:183)ٰ
ّ(cid:171)(cid:170)َا After this the child was unable to walk as a punishment for his 
ُهَرَ(cid:102)َا ْعَ(cid:143)ْ(cid:162)ا َ
bad behaviour. 4

The  Seventh:  A  shameless  woman,  who  was  like  a  child,  asked  for  a 
piece of the food Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 
was eating. He gave her some, but she said: “ No, I want a piece from your 
mouth. ” So he gave her a piece, and, after eating the morsel, she became the 
most modest and bashful woman in Medina. 5

books and books of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) biography. For sure, since the 
blessed hand of Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 
was like a pharmacy of Luqman the Wise, and his spittle was like a spring 
of Khidr’s water of life, and his breath soothing and healing like that of 
Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ), certainly many people would have recourse 
to him; and the sick, children, and the insane did ﬂock to him in great num-
bers, and they were all healed. Abu ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Yamani, known as 
Ta v u s , even, who made the Hajj forty times and for forty years performed 
the morning prayer with the ablution of the preceeding night prayers, and 
who met with many of the Companions and was one of the greatest schol-
ars of the generation following them, stated and made the certain report 
that however many lunatics came to Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ), he placed his hand on their chests and they were all 
healed; not one was not cured. 1

Thus, since a great scholar such as that who had direct connections with 
the era of the Prophet ( UWBP ), made such deﬁnite and general statements, 
for sure, none of the sick who came to Allah’s Prophet ( UWBP ) were not 
healed;  they  were  all  healed.  Since  this  was  the  case,  certainly  thousands 
would have had recourse to him.

FOURTEENTH SIGN

Another numerous sort of the various kinds of miracle of Allah’s Most 
Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) were the wonders 
manifested as a result of his prayers. This kind is deﬁnite and there is a ‘true 
consensus’ concerning their many reports. The instances and examples of 
it are so numerous as to be incalculable, and many of these have reached 
the  degree  of  ‘consensus,’  or  have  become  famous  as  such.  Others  have 
been related by such authorities that they bear the same certainty as ‘well-
known consensus.’ As examples, we shall quote only some of the numerous 
instances  of  this  kind  of  miracle  that  are  very  well-known  and  nearest  in 
degree to ‘consensus,’ giving some particulars of each instance.

First Example

F i r s t   E x a m p l e :   The  fact  that  prayers  of  the  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) for rain were always accepted has been trans-
mitted by authorities of Hadith, primarily Bukhari and Muslim. There were 
times  when  in  the  pulpit  he  raised  his  hands  to  pray  for  rain,  and  before 
he had lowered them even, rain began to fall.  2 As mentioned above, once 
or twice when the army had run out of water, the clouds came and poured

forth rain.  1 Before his prophetic mission, even, during his childhood, the 
Prophet’s ( UWBP ) grandfather ‘Abd al-Muttalib would go to pray for rain 
with him, and the rain came out of respect for Muhammad ( UWBP ). The 
fact became celebrated through a poem of ‘Abd al-Muttalib 2 And after the 
Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  death,  ‘Umar  prayed  citing  ‘Abbas,  saying:  “ O  our 
Sustainer!  This  is  the  uncle  of  your  Beloved.  Send  us  rain  for  his  sake! ” 
And it rained. 3

Bukhari and Muslim also relate that Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ) was asked to pray for rain. He did so and so much rain 
fell that they had to ask him to pray for it to stop. He did so, and it stopped 
at once. 4

Second Example

S e c o n d   E x a m p l e :   It  is  almost  as  well-known  as  those  incidents  about 
which there are many unanimous reports that when the number of Compan-
ions and believers had still not reached forty, Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) prayed secretly while performing his worship: 

ِماَ(cid:131)ِ(cid:183)ْ(cid:170)ا  ِنـْ(cid:92)ا وِر ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:151)ِ(cid:92) ْوَا  ِباَ

ّ(cid:171)(cid:170)َا   A few days later, ‘Umar 
b. al-Khattab came to believe and proclaimed and upheld Islam, so that he 
acquired the title of F a r u q  ( Discerner between truth and falsehood ). 5

ّ(cid:143)َ(cid:115)ْ(cid:170)ا  ِنـْ(cid:92)ا ِر َ(cid:175)ُ(cid:151)ِ(cid:92) َم َ(cid:203) ْ(cid:126)ِ

Third Example

T h i r d   E x a m p l e :  Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) prayed for various distin-
guished Companions for different purposes. His prayers were all accepted 
in  so  brilliant  a  fashion  that  the  wonders  of  these  prayers  reached  the 
degree  of  a  miracle.  For  instance,  foremost  Bukhari  and  Muslim  relate 
ّ(cid:171)(cid:170)َا 
that he prayed for Ibn ‘Abbas as follows:  َل(cid:192)ِوْاَ

glorious title of Interpreter of the Qur’an and reached the elevated degree of 
“ erudite scholar of the Muslim community. ” 1 When still very young even, 
‘Umar used to include him in the gatherings of the religious scholars and 
leading Companions. 2

Also,  foremost  Bukhari  and  the  writers  of  books  of  authentic  Hadith 
relate that the mother of Anas entreatied Allah’s Noble Messenger ( UWBP ): 
“ Pray  that  your  servant  Anas  will  be  blessed  with  abundant  wealth  and 

ّ(cid:171)(cid:170)َا 
offspring. ”  He  prayed,  saying: ُهَ(cid:99)ْ(cid:193)َ(cid:143)ْ(cid:150)َا ا َ(cid:175)(cid:193)ِ(cid:158) ُهَ(cid:170)  ْكِراَ(cid:92)َو ُهَدَ(cid:170)َوَو ُهَ(cid:170)اَ(cid:174) ْرِ(cid:103)ﯰﯦَا َ
Towards the end of his life, Anas said swearing by Allah: “ I have buried a 
hundred of my progeny with my own hand. No one has been as fortunate as 
myself in regard to wealth and possessions. You can see that my wealth is 
truly abundant. All these are the result of Prophet’s ( UWBP ) prayer for the 
blessing of plenty. ” 3

ّمُ(cid:183)ٰ

Also,  foremost  Imam  Bayhaqi,  and  the  scholars  of  Hadith  relate  that 
Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) prayed that one 
of the ten promised Paradise, ‘Abd al-Rahman b. ‘Awf, be blessed with 
abundance of wealth. Through the blessing of that prayer, he acquired such 
wealth  that  on  one  occasion  he  donated  seven  hundred  camels  together 
with  their  loads  to  Allah’s  cause  4  See  the  blessings  of  plenty  resulting 
from  the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  prayer,  and  say:  “ How  great  are  Allah’s 
blessings! ”

Also, narrators of Hadiths, and foremost Bukhari, relate: “ Allah’s Mes-
senger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) prayed that ‘Urwa b. Abi al-
Ja‘da might do proﬁtably at trade. ‘Urwa said: ‘Sometimes I would go to 
the marketplace in Kufa and come home in the evening having made a forty 
thousandfold proﬁt.’ ” Imam Bukhari says: “ If he took earth in his hand, he 
still would make a proﬁt from it! ” 5

Also, he prayed that ‘Abdullah b. Ja‘far would acquire an abundance of 
wealth,  1 and he became so rich he was famous for it. He also became as 
famous for his generosity as he was for the wealth he obtained through the 
Prophet’s ( UWBP ) prayer for the blessing of plenty. 2

There are numerous instances of this sort of miracle, but we consider the 

four described above to be sufﬁcient as examples.

Also,  foremost  Imam  Tirmidhi  relates:  “ The  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon 

whom be blessings and peace ) prayed for Sa‘d b. Abi Waqqas:

There is also the famous story of the poet Nabigha: he recited one of his 
poems  before  Allah’s  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace ), 
which ran:  اًرَ(cid:183)ْ(cid:147)َ(cid:174)

Through the blessing of this prayer, Imam ‘Ali used to wear summer clothes

prayer. ” 3

Also, Tufayl b. ‘Amr asked Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-

Also,  Abu  Hurayra  once  complained  to  the  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) that he sometimes suffered from forgetful-
ness. Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) told him to spread out a piece of cloth. 
He then made some movements with his blessed hand as though taking some 
invisible objects and putting them on the cloth. He repeated this two or three 
times,  then  told  him  to  gather  up  the  cloth.  Abu  Hurayra  later  swore  that

through the mystery of this prayer of the Prophet ( UWBP ), he never again 
forgot anything. 1 This event is also among well-known Hadiths.

Fourth Example

F o u r t h   E x a m p l e :   We  shall  describe  here  a  few  events  regarding  mal-

edictions of Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ).

The  First:  The  Persian  Shah  Parviz  tore  up  the  letter  sent  to  him  by 
Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ). When the Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-

ّ(cid:171)(cid:170)َا “ O   A l l a h ,   r e n d  
ings and peace ) received news of this, he prayed: ُهْ(cid:162)ّ
h i m   a s   h e   r e n t   m y   l e t t e r !  ” 2 It was as a result of this malediction that Chos-
roes Parviz’s son Shirviya cut him to pieces with a dagger.  3 And Sa‘d b. 
al-Waqqas broke his kingdom apart, so that in no part of the Sasanid empire 
did his sovereignty remain. However, the Emperor of Byzantium and other 
kings did not perish since they respected the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) letters.

ِزَ(cid:174) َ

ّمُ(cid:183)ٰ

The  Second:  An  event  almost  as  well-known  as  those  reported  unan-
imously,  which  some  verses  of  the  Qur’an  allude  to,  is  this:  in  the  early 
days of Islam, the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 
was performing the prayers in the Masjid al-Haram, when the chiefs of the 
Quraysh gathered and maltreated him. At the time, the Messenger ( UWBP ) 
called down curses on them. Ibn Mas‘ud stated: “ I swear that at the Battle 
of Badr I saw the corpses of all those who had ill-treated him and received 
his curse. ” 4

The  Third:  On  their  denying  him,  Allah’s  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon 
whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  prayed  that  a  large  Arab  tribe  called  the 
Mudariyya would be afﬂicted with drought and famine. All rain ceased and 
drought and famine occurred. Then the Quraysh, a branch of the Mudariyya, 
pleaded  with  the  Noble  Messenger  ( UWBP ),  and  he  prayed.  Whereupon 
the rains came and put an end to the drought. 5 The incident was well-known 
enough to be reported unanimously.

F i f t h   E x a m p l e :   The  fact  that  the  Messenger’s  ( UWBP )  maledictions 
against particular persons were accepted and realized in a dreadful way is 
illustrated by numerous instances. We shall recount three of these by way 
of example.

The First: He uttered the following curse against ‘Utba b. Abi Lahab: 

ِ(cid:171) َ(cid:126) َ

ّ(cid:171)(cid:170)َا “ O  A l l a h ,  b e s e t  a  d o g  o n  h i m  f r o m  a m o n g  
َكِ(cid:92) َ(cid:203)ﯮﯦ  ْنـِ(cid:174) اً(cid:93)ْ(cid:171)ﯬﯦ ِهْ(cid:193)َ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) ْطّ
y o u r   d o g s !  ” Some time later ‘Utba went on a journey during which a lion 
sought him out from among the caravan, and tore him to pieces. 1 This inci-
dent was famous and is narrated as authentic by the authorities on Hadith.

ّمُ(cid:183)ٰ

The Second: This is Muhallim b. Jaththama: he unjustly killed ‘Amir b. 
Adbat, whom Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) had sent him as the commander 
of a force to ﬁght in Allah’s way. When the news of this reached the Mes-
senger ( UWBP ), he was angry and cursed Muhallim, saying: 

ّمُ(cid:183)ٰ

ّ(cid:171)(cid:170)َا Muhallim died a week later. They put him in his grave, 
ِ(cid:171)َ(cid:111)ُ(cid:175)ِ(cid:170) ْرِ(cid:159)ْ(cid:155)َ(cid:98)  َ(cid:202) َ
ِمّ
but the grave cast him out. They buried him in several different places, but 
each time the grave rejected him. Finally they built a strong wall between 
two rocks, and in this way the corpse was housed. 2

The Third: Once Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ) saw a man eating with his left hand. He ordered him to eat with 
his right hand  َكِ(cid:179)(cid:193) ِ(cid:175)َ(cid:193)ِ(cid:92)  ْلﯭﯦ The man replied: ُع(cid:193) ِ(cid:143)َ(cid:99) ْ(cid:126)َا  َ(cid:202) “ I can’t. ” The Mes-
senger ( UWBP ) said as a malediction:  َتْ(cid:151)َ(cid:143)َ(cid:99) ْ(cid:126)ا  َ(cid:202) “ H e n c e f o r t h   y o u   w i l l   b e  
u n a b l e   t o   r a i s e   i t . ” And after that he was unable to use it. 3

Sixth Example

S i x t h   E x a m p l e :   Here,  out  of  the  numerous  wonders  resulting  from 
prayers  of  the  Noble  Messenger  ( UWBP ),  and  from  his  touch,  we  shall 
mention several incidents which are certain. 

The  First:  Allah’s  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace ) 
gave Khalid b. al-Walid, known as Allah’s Sword, several of his hairs and 
prayed for his victory in battle. Khalid put them in his cap. As the result of

the hairs and the blessings of the prayer, there was never a battle in which he 
then fought but he was victorious. 1

The Second: Salman al-Farsi had formerly been a slave of the Jews. His 
masters had asked for a very high ransom, saying: “ To gain your freedom, 
you must plant three hundred date-palms, and after they bear fruit, give us 
forty  o k k a s   2 of gold in addition to the fruit. ” He went to the Noble Mes-
senger ( UWBP ) and explained his situation. Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) 
then planted the three hundred palms in the region of Medina; only one of 
them was planted by someone else. That year, all three hundred trees bore 
fruit, with the exception of the one planted by the other person. The Mes-
senger ( UWBP ) uprooted it and planted another, and it too bore fruit. He 
then rubbed some of his spittle on a piece of gold the size of a hen’s egg, 
and offered a prayer. He gave it to Salman, telling him to go and give it to 
the Jews. Salman al-Farsi went and gave them forty  o k k a s  of gold out of 
that piece, while it remained in its original state. 3 This miraculous incident, 
which was narrated by the most trustworthy and respected authorities, was 
the most signiﬁcant event in Salman’s entire life.

The  Third:  A  woman  Companion  called  Umm  Malik  used  to  give 
the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) butter from a 
leathern bag called an ‘ u k k a , as a gift. On one occasion Allah’s Messenger 
( UWBP ) uttered a prayer over it while returning it to her, and told her not 
to empty it and squeeze it. Umm Malik took the ‘ u k k a , and thereafter as a 
result of the blessing of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) prayer, butter was found in 
it whenever her children asked for it. This continued for a long time, until 
they squeezed it, and the blessing disappeared. 4

Seventh Example

S e v e n t h   E x a m p l e :  There were also many examples of water becoming 
sweet and emitting a pleasant smell as a result of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) 
prayer and his touching it; we shall mention several by way of example: 

The First: Scholars of Hadith, and foremost Imam Bayhaqi, report that 
the well known as Bi’r al-Quba would sometimes dry up. On Allah’s Mes-
senger ( UWBP ) pouring the water with which he had taken ablutions into

the well and offering a prayer, its water became abundant and it never again 
dried up. 1

The Second: Scholars of Hadith, including Abu Nu‘aym in his D a l a ’ i l  
a l - N u b u w w a   ( Evidences  of  Prophethood ),  report  that  when  Allah’s  Mes-
senger ( UWBP ) spat into the well in Anas’ house and prayed, it became the 
sweetest water in Medina. 2

The Third: Ibn Maja reports that a bucketful of water from the spring of 
Zamzam was brought to the Messenger ( UWBP ). He took a little of it into 
his mouth then emptied it into the bucket. The bucket then emitted a sweet 
scent like musk. 3

The Fourth: Imam Ahmad b. Hanbal reports that a bucketful of water 
was drawn from a well. After Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) had put some of 
his spittle in the bucket and poured it into the well, it began to emit a sweet 
scent like musk. 4

The  Fifth:  Hammad  b.  Salama,  who  was  a  man  of  Allah  and  was 
trusted  and  accepted  by  Imam  Muslim  and  the  scholars  of  the  Maghrib, 
reports that the Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) ﬁlled a leather bag with water, 
and breathed into it while praying. He then tied it up and gave it to some 
of the Companions, saying: “ D o n ’t   o p e n   i t   e x c e p t   w h e n   y o u   p e r f o r m   t h e  
a b l u t i o n s !  ”  When  they  opened  the  bag  to  take  ablutions,  they  saw  pure 
milk with cream at its opening. 5

Thus, these ﬁve instances have been narrated by well-known and impor-
tant authorities. Together with those that are not mentioned here, they prove 
the occurrence of this kind of miracle as deﬁnitely as those about the various 
reports concerning which there is consensus in meaning.

Eighth Example

E i g h t h  E x a m p l e :  There were numerous instances of barren and dry goats 
producing  milk,  and  abundantly  at  that,  through  the  touch  and  prayers  of 
Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). We shall 
mention only two or three which are well-known and certain, as examples:

The First: All the reliable books of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) biography 
relate that when Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) and Abu Bakr the Veracious

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

were migrating to Medina, they came to the house of Umm Ma‘bad, called 
Atika Bint Khalid al-Khuza‘i. There was an extremely thin, barren, and dry 
goat there. Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) asked Umm Ma‘bad: “ H a s   t h i s   n o  
m i l k ?  ”  She  replied:  “ It  has  no  blood  in  its  body,  how  should  it  produce 
milk? ”  The  Messenger  ( UWBP )  stroked  its  loins  and  teets,  and  prayed. 
Then he said: “ B r i n g   a   v e s s e l ,   a n d   m i l k   i t . ” They milked it, and after the 
Messenger ( UWBP ) and Abu Bakr had drunk, all the people of the house 
drank to repletion. The goat grew strong, and remained thus blessed. 1

The Second: This is the famous story of Shat b. Mas‘ud: before becom-
ing a Muslim, Ibn Mas‘ud used to act as a shepherd for a number of people. 
Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) went together with 
Abu Bakr the Veracious to the place where Ibn Mas‘ud and his goats were. 
Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) asked Ibn Mas‘ud for some milk. On replying 
that they were not his but someone else’s, the Messenger ( UWBP ) told him 
to bring him a barren, dry goat. So he brought a nanny-goat that had not been 
mated for two years. Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) stroked its teets with his 
hand and prayed. Then they milked it, and obtained sweet milk which they 
drank. Ibn Mas‘ud came to believe after witnessing this miracle. 2

The Third: This is the well-known story of Halima Sa‘diya, the foster 
mother, that is, wet-nurse, of the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ). There was drought where the tribe was found, and all the 
animals were thin and without milk. They could not ﬁnd sufﬁcient to eat. But 
when the Messenger ( UWBP ) was sent to his foster mother there, through 
the blessing he brought, Halima Sa‘diya’s goats would return in the evening 
with both their stomachs and their teets full, contrary to everyone else’s.

There are further instances in the books of biography similar to these, but 

these examples are sufﬁcient for our purpose. 3

blessings and peace ) had touched the faces and heads of certain people, 
and prayed.

The  First:  He  passed  his  hand  over  the  head  of  ‘Umar  b.  Sa‘d,  and 
prayed. When the man died at the age of eighty, through the blessing of that 
prayer, there was not a single grey hair on his head. 1

The Second: He placed his hand on Qays b. Zayd’s head, and prayed. 
Through  the  blessing  of  the  prayer  and  effect  of  his  touch,  when  Qays 
reached a hundred years of age, his head was white except for where Allah’s 
Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) had placed his hand; that 
had remained totally black. 2

The Third: ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Zayd b. al-Khattab was both small and 
ugly.  Allah’s  Messenger  ( UWBP )  touched  his  head  with  his  hand  and 
prayed. Through the blessing of his prayer, ‘Abdurrahman acquired the loft-
iest stature and most beautiful form. 3

The Fourth: ‘A’idh b. ‘Amr received a wound on the face during the 
Battle of Hunayn. Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) wiped away the blood on 
his  face  with  his  hand.  The  part  of  his  face  that  the  Messenger  ( UWBP ) 
had  touched  acquired  a  shining  brilliance,  which  the  scholars  of  Hadith 
described as  ِسَرَ(cid:159)ْ(cid:170)ا ِةَ
ّرُ(cid:155)ﯬﯦ  resembling a white blaze on a chestnut horse. 4
The Fifth: He passed his hand over Qatada b. Malhan’s face and prayed, 

and Qatada’s face began to shine like a mirror. 5

The Sixth: When Zaynab, the daughter of the Mother of Believers Umm 
Salama and the stepdaughter of Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) was a child, 
he sprinkled some of his ablution water on her face. With the touch of the 
water, her face acquired an extraordinary beauty. 6

There  are  numerous  further  examples  similar  to  these,  most  of  which 
have been narrated by the leading scholars of Hadith. Even if we suppose

certainty of ‘consensus in meaning.’ For if an event is narrated in numerous 
different forms, the occurrence of the basic event becomes deﬁnite. Even if 
each is weak, it still proves the basic event. 

For example, a noise was heard; some people said that a house had col-
lapsed. Others said it was a different house, and so on. Each narration may 
be  a  single  report,  and  weak,  and  untrue,  but  the  basic  event  was  that  a 
house had collapsed; that was certain and they were unanimous concerning 
it.  However,  the  six  instances  we  enumerated  above  were  both  authentic, 
and some of them became famous. Suppose we consider each of them to be 
weak,  all  together  they  demonstrate  the  certain  occurrence  of  an  absolute 
miracle of Muhammad ( UWBP ), like the absolute collapse of the house in 
the comparison.

Thus, Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 
performed deﬁnite, evident miracles from every category. The instances of 
them are the forms or examples of those universal and absolute miracles. 
Just as the Messenger’s ( UWBP ) hand, ﬁngers, spittle, breath, and speech, 
that is, his prayer, were the means of numerous miracles, so too, his other 
subtle faculties and emotions and senses were the means of many wonders. 
The books of biography and history have described them and demonstrated 
that in his conduct, physical being, and senses were many evidences of his 
prophethood. 

FIFTEENTH SIGN

Just as rocks, trees, the moon and the sun recognized Allah’s Noble Mes-
senger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) and afﬁrmed his prophethood 
by each demonstrating a miracle, so too, animals, the dead, the jinn, and the 
angels recognized that blessed person and afﬁrmed his prophethood. For by 
each of those species of beings displaying a number of miracles, they dem-
onstrated that they recognized him and they proclaimed their afﬁrmation of 
his prophethood. This Fifteenth Sign contains three branches.

First Branch

The animal realm recognized Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ) and displayed his miracles. There are numerous exam-
ples of this Branch. Here as examples, we shall mention only those which 
are  well-known  and  deﬁnite  to  the  degree  of  ‘consensus  in  meaning,’  or 
have been accepted by authoritative scholars, or have been deemed accept-
able by the Muslim community.

The First Incident: This is well-known to the degree of ‘consensus in 
meaning,’ and concerns the two pigeons coming and waiting at the entrance 
to  the  cave  of  Hira,  where  Allah’s  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings 
and peace ) and Abu Bakr the Veracious hid from the pursuing unbelievers, 
and the spider veiling the entrance with a thick web, like a curtain holder. 
Ubayy b. Khalaf, one of the leaders of the Quraysh whom Allah’s Messen-
ger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) killed with his own hand at the 
Battle of Badr,  1 looked at the cave. When his companions suggested that 
they enter, he replied: “ Why should we? I see a large spider’s web which 
appears to have been there since before Muhammad was born. And look, 
those two pigeons are there. Would they perch there if there was someone 
in the cave? ” 2

In an instance similar to this, a blessed pigeon cast a shadow over the 
head of Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) during the conquest of Mecca, which 
was related by Imam Jalil b. Wahab. 3

Also  according  to  a  sound  narration,  ‘A’isha  al-Siddiqa  relates:  “ We 
had a bird in our house called a  d ā j i n , similar to a pigeon. When Allah’s 
Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) was present it would stay 
quiet, but as soon as he left the house, it would start hopping to and fro with-
out  stopping. ”  4  Thus,  the  bird  was  obedient  to  the  Messenger  ( UWBP ), 
remaining quiet in his presence.

The Second Incident: This is the extraordinary story of the wolf, which 
has been narrated through a number of chains of transmission from some 
well-known Companions and about which there is ‘consensus in meaning.’ 
In  short,  Abu  Sa‘id  al-Khudri,  Salama  b.  al-Akwa‘,  Ibn  Abi  Wahab,  and 
Abu Hurayra, and Uhban, a shepherd who was involved in another event, 
relate  through  numerous  chains  of  transmission:  “ A  wolf  seized  a  goat 
and the shepherd saved it from the wolf. The wolf exclaimed: ‘Don’t you 
fear Allah? You have deprived me of my sustenance!’ The shepherd mut-
tered to himself: ‘How strange! Can wolves speak?’ The wolf said to him:

‘You’re  the  strange  one,  for  beyond  the  hill  someone  is  calling  you  to 
Paradise.  He  is  a  Messenger  of  Allah,  yet  you  do  not  recognize  him!’ ” 
Although all the lines of transmission agree on the wolf’s speech, in his 
report, which has a strong line, Abu Hurayra says: “ The shepherd said to 
the wolf: ‘I am going to see him, but who will look after my goats?’ The 
wolf replied: ‘I’ll look after them.’ So the shepherd handed over the herd 
to the wolf and went to see the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ), believed in him, and returned to his herd. The shepherd 
found  the  wolf;  not  a  goat  had  been  lost.  So  he  slaughtered  one  for  the 
wolf, for it had become his teacher. ” 1

According  to  one  chain  of  transmission,  one  of  the  chiefs  of  Quraysh, 
Abu Sufyan, and Safwan saw a wolf pursuing a gazelle into the enclosure 
of the Ka‘ba. As it returned, the wolf spoke, telling of the messengership of 
Muhammad ( UWBP ). They were astonished. Abu Sufyan said to Safwan: 
‘Don’t let’s tell anyone about this; I’m frightened everyone will join him and 
Mecca will be emptied.’ 2

I n   S h o r t :  The story of the wolf gives one complete conviction, and is 
as  certain  as  those  unanimous  reports  about  which  there  is  ‘consensus  in 
meaning.’

The Third Incident: This is the narrative of the camel, which was unan-
imously  related  through  some  ﬁve  or  six  chains  of  transmission  by  such 
famous Companions as Abu Hurayra, Tha‘laba b. Malik, Jabir b. ‘Abdul-
lah, ‘Abdullah b. Ja‘far, and ‘Abdullah b. Abi Awfa, who are at the start of 
the chains. A camel approached Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ), prostrated itself before him as if saluting him, and spoke. 
According to a number of lines of transmission, the camel had been angered 
in a garden and become wild, attacking anyone who approached it. When 
Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) appeared, it came to him, prostrated as a sign 
of respect, and knelt down. He put a bridle on it, and the camel said to him: 
“ They made me do the heaviest work and now they want to slaughter me. 
That’s why I went wild. ” The Messenger ( UWBP ) asked its owner if this 
was true. “ Yes, ” he replied. 3

Also, Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 
had a camel called ‘Adba’. After he died, out of its grief, the camel neither 
ate nor drank, till it died. 1 A number of important authorities including Abu 
Ishaq Isfara’ini related that it spoke with the Messenger ( UWBP ) about a 
certain story. 2 In another instance, in an authentic narration, Jabir b. ‘Abdul-
lah’s camel became exhausted on a journey and could no longer continue. 
Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) gave it a slight prod. Such joy and nimbleness 
did the camel receive from that prod of the Prophet ( UWBP ) that due to its 
speed it could not be caught up with, nor could its reins be seized. 3

The Fourth Incident: The authorities on Hadith and foremost Bukhari 
report  that  it  was  rumoured  one  night  that  the  enemy  was  attacking  out-
side Medina. Brave horsemen went out to investigate. On the way they saw 
someone coming. They looked and saw that it was the Messenger ( Upon 
whom  be  blessings  and  peace ).  He  told  them  there  was  nothing.  He  had 
mounted Abu Talha’s famous horse, as his sacred courage impelled him to, 
and had gone before everyone else to investigate, then returned. He told Abu 
َكَ(cid:126)َرَ(cid:158)  ُتْدَ(cid:106)َو “ Yo u r   h o r s e   i s   e x t r e m e l y   s w i f t   a n d   u n f a l t e r i n g . ” 
Talha: اًرْ(cid:111)َ(cid:92) 
Whereas previously it had been extremely slow. After that night, there was 
no horse to compete with it. 4 On another occasion, as related in an authentic 
narration, while on a journey at the time for prayer, the Noble Messenger 
( UWBP ) told his horse to stop. It stopped, and until he had ﬁnished praying 
the horse did not make the slightest movement. 5

The  Fifth  Incident:  Saﬁna,  the  servant  of  the  Noble  Prophet  ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ), was commanded by him to go to the Gov-
ernor of Yemen, Mu‘adh b. Jabal. He set off and on the way encountered 
a lion. Saﬁna said to it: “ I am the servant of Allah’s Messenger! ” Upon 
which  the  lion  made  a  sound  as  if  saying  something,  and  left  without 
molesting him. According to another narration, Saﬁna lost his way when 
returning,  and  met  with  a  lion.  Not  only  did  the  lion  not  molest  him,  it 
showed him the way. 6

Also, it is narrated from ‘Umar that he said: “ A beduin came to the Noble 
Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). He was holding a lizard. 
He said: ‘If this reptile testiﬁes to you, I shall believe in you; otherwise I 
will not.’ Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) asked the lizard, and it testiﬁed to his 
messengership most eloquently. ” 1

Also, the Mother of Believers, Umm Salama relates: “ A gazelle spoke 
with the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), and testi-
ﬁed to his messengership. ” 2

Thus, there are numerous examples similar to these. We have described a 
few that are famous and certain. To those who do not recognize and obey the 
Noble Messenger ( UWBP ), we say this: O man! Take a lesson from these! 
The lion and the wolf recognized and obeyed him; you, then, should try not 
to fall lower than an animal!

This  concerns  corpses,  jinns,  and  angels  recognizing  Allah’s  Noble 
Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). There were very many 
instances of this. We shall describe a few examples which are famous and 
have been related by reliable scholars, ﬁrstly about corpses. As for jinns 
and angels, the many reports concerning them are unanimous, and exam-
ples of them number not one but a thousand. And so, examples of the dead 
speaking:

The First is this: Hasan al-Basri, an important and loyal student of Imam 
‘Ali and the greatest authority among the scholars of the external and eso-
teric sciences in the time of the generation subsequent to the Companions, 
related:  “ A  man  came  weeping  to  Allah’s  Messenger  ( UWBP ).  He  said: 
‘I had a little girl; she drowned in such-and-such stream nearby. I left her 
there.’ He pitied the man and said they would go there together. They went, 
and  the  Messenger  ( UWBP )  called  to  the  dead  girl,  saying  her  name.  At

The  Second:  Important  authorities  like  Imam  Bayhaqi  and  Imam  b. 
‘Adiyy  relate  from  Anas  b.  Malik:  Anas  said:  “ An  elderly  woman  had  a 
single son who suddenly died. The righteous woman was very grieved and 
prayed:  ‘O  Allah,  I  left  my  home  and  migrated  here  only  to  obtain  Your 
pleasure and to pay allegiance to Allah’s Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) and to 
serve him. For the sake of Your Messenger, return my son to me, who was 
the only person to look after me.’ ” Anas said: “ The dead man rose up and 
came and ate with us. ” 1

As regards angels appearing and serving Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ), 
and jinns believing in him and obeying him, these facts have been reported 
numerously  and  unanimously.  They  have  been  stated  explicitly  in  many 
verses of the Qur’an. 1 At the Battle of Badr, according to the Qur’an, 2 ﬁve 
thousand angels served him as soldiers in the front line, like the Compan-
ions.  Indeed,  those  angels  acquired  distinction  among  the  angels,  like  the 
men who fought in the battle.  3 There are two aspects to be considered in 
this matter:

T h e   F i r s t  is the fact that the existence of the different sorts of jinn and 
angels is as deﬁnite as that of the varieties and species of animals and human 
beings, and that they have relations with us. We have proved this decisively 
in the Twenty-Ninth Word as certainly as two plus two equals four, and we 
refer their proof to that Wo r d .

T h e   S e c o n d   A s p e c t  is members of Allah’s Messenger’s ( UWBP ) com-

munity seeing them and speaking with them, as a miracle of his.

Thus,  the  leading  scholars  of  Hadith,  and  foremost  Bukhari  and  Mus-
lim,  unanimously  relate:  “ One  time,  an  angel,  that  is,  Gabriel,  appeared 
in the form of a man dressed in white. He approached Allah’s Messenger 
( UWBP ), who was sitting among his Companions, and asked:

ْ(cid:202)ا اَ(cid:174)َو  ،  ُنا َ(cid:175)(cid:192)ِ

ْ(cid:202)ا اَ(cid:174) ‘What is Islam? What is belief? And 
what is goodness? Explain them.’ The Messenger ( UWBP ) explained them, 
and the Companions gathered there both received valuable instruction, and 
saw the person clearly. Although he seemed like a traveller, he displayed 
no sign of a journey. He suddenly rose and disappeared. Allah’s Messenger 
( UWBP ) then said: ‘G a b r i e l   d i d   t h a t   i n   o r d e r   t o   t e a c h   y o u ! ’ ” 4

Also, the authorities on Hadith relate through certain and authentic nar-
rations  about  which  there  is  ‘consensus  in  meaning:’  “ The  Companions 
saw Gabriel with Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) many times in the form of 
Dihya, who was very handsome. ” For instance, ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Abbas, Usama 
b.  Zayd,  Harith,  ‘A’isha  al-Siddiqa,  and  Umm  Salama  established  and 
related certainly: “ We frequently saw Gabriel with the Allah’s Messenger

( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) in the form of Dihya. ”  1 Is it at all 
possible that such people would say that they had seen him if they had not?
Also, the conqueror of Persia, Sa‘d b. Abi Waqqas, who was one of the 
ten promised Paradise, relates in an authentic narration: “ At the Battle of 
Uhud we saw two white-dressed persons either side of Allah’s Messenger 
( UWBP ),  guarding  him  like  sentries.  We  understood  that  they  were  the 
angels, Gabriel and Michael. ”  2 Is it possible that if such a hero of Islam 
says he saw them, he had not seen them?

Also, Abu Sufyan b. Harith b. ‘Abd al-Muttalib, the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) 
cousin,  relates  in  an  authentic  narration:  “ At  the  Battle  of  Badr,  we  saw 
horsemen dressed in white between the sky and the earth. ” 3

Also, Hamza pleaded with the Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) to see Gabriel. 
So he showed him to Hamza in the Ka‘ba, but he could not endure it and fell 
to the ground unconscious. 4

There were numerous occurrences like these of angels being seen. They 
all demonstrated one sort of the miracles of Muhammad ( UWBP ), and show 
that the angels too were like moths drawn to the lamp of his prophethood.

When it comes to jinns, it was not only the Companions, it frequently 
happens that ordinary members of the Muslim community meet with them 
and see them. But the most certain and authentic reports are given us by the 
leading scholars of Hadith, who say: Ibn Mas‘ud related: “ I saw the jinn on 
the night they accepted Islam at Batn al-Nakhl. I likened them to the Zut, a 
tall-statured Sudanese tribe; they resembled them. ” 5

There  was  also  the  incident  concerning  Khalid  b.  al-Walid,  which  is 
famous  and  has  been  authenticated  and  accepted  by  the  leading  scholars 
of Hadith: when the idol called ‘Uzza was destroyed, a jinn came out of it 
in the form of a black woman. Khalid cut it into two with his sword. The 
Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) said in connection

Also, is a narration from ‘Umar: he said: “ While we were with Allah’s 
Messenger ( UWBP ), a jinn called Hama came in the form of an old man 
carrying  a  staff;  he  accepted  Islam.  The  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom 
be  blessings  and  peace )  instructed  him  in  some  of  the  short  Suras  of  the 
Qur’an, which he listened to and then departed. ” 2 Some scholars of Hadith 
have questioned this last incident, but the most important of them declared it 
to be authentic. In any event, it is unnecessary to describe this sort at length, 
for the examples of it are many. We would only add this:

Through  the  light  of  Allah’s  Noble  Messenger  ( UWBP ),  through  his 
training and through following him, thousands of spiritual poles and puriﬁed 
scholars like Shaikh ‘Abd al-Qadir Gilani have met and spoken with angels 
and jinn. This fact has reached the degree of consensus a hundred times over 
through innumerable instances. 3 Yes, members of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) 
community being in contact with angels and jinn, and speaking with them, 
occurs through the miraculous guidance and instruction of the Noble Mes-
senger ( UWBP ).

The protection and preservation of Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ) was a clear miracle, and many instances of it are indi-
cated by the clear truth of the verse, ( 5:67 ) ] \ [ Z For sure, 
when Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) appeared, he was not only challenging 
one  group,  or  one  people,  or  a  few  rulers,  or  one  religion;  he  was  rather 
challenging single-handed all kings and the people of all religions. And yet 
until he died in perfect ease and happiness and rose to the heavenly court, 
for twenty-three years he was without guard or protector and was exposed 
to numerous plots, with his own uncle his greatest enemy and his own tribe 
and  people  hostile  to  him.  This  shows  what  a  powerful  truth  the  above-
mentioned verse expresses and what a ﬁrm point of support it was. We shall 
mention as examples only a few events classed as deﬁnite.

First Event: Scholars of Hadith and the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) biography 
report unanimously that the Quraysh had made a certain agreement to kill 
Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). Upon the sugges-
tion of a demon in human form, so as to prevent discord within the Quraysh, 
at least one member of every branch of the tribe formed a group of nearly 
two  hundred  men  under  the  leadership  of  Abu  Jahl  and  Abu  Lahab,  and 
they staged a surprise attack on the Messenger’s ( UWBP ) house. ‘Ali was 
together with him. He had told him to sleep that night in his bed. The Mes-
senger ( UWBP ) waited till the Quraysh came and completely surrounded 
the house, then he went out and threw a handful of earth at their heads, and 
not one of them saw him. He passed through them and disappeared. 1 When 
he reached the cave of Hira, two pigeons and a spider became his guards, 
and protected him against all the Quraysh. 2

The Second Event: It certainly occurred that when they emerged from 
the cave and set off towards Medina, they were followed by a very brave 
man called Suraqa, who, for a large reward, had been sent by the leaders 
of the Quraysh to kill them. Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ) and Abu Bakr the Veracious had seen Suraqa coming when they 
came out of the cave. Abu Bakr had been anxious, but Allah’s Messenger 
( UWBP ) said: ( 9:40 ) ¬ « ª © ¨ , as he had in the cave. Abu 
Bakr looked at Suraqa: his horse’s hooves were stuck in the sand. He was 
freed and started following them again. Then again the horse became trans-
ﬁxed,  and  something  like  smoke  was  rising  from  where  its  hooves  were 
stuck. At that point he understood that it was beyond his power and any-
one else’s power to harm Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ). He cried for mercy. The Messenger ( UWBP ) freed him, but said: 
“ Go back, but make sure no one else comes after us. ” 3

In connection with this incident, we should also mention that a shepherd 
spotted them and immediately set off for Mecca to inform the Quraysh. But 
on arriving at the city, he forgot why he had come. No matter how much he

tried, he could not remember. He was obliged to return. Then later he under-
stood that he had been made to forget it. 1

The Third Event: The leading scholars of Hadith relate through many 
chains of transmission that at the Battle of Ghatafan and Anmar, a bold 
tribal chief called Ghurath got close to the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ) without anyone seeing him, his sword ready in his 
hand. He said to Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ): “ Who will save you from 
me? ”  Allah’s  Messenger  ( UWBP )  replied:  “ A l l a h !  ”  Then  he  prayed:
ّ(cid:171)(cid:170)َا  Suddenly,  Ghurath  received  a  blow  from  the

Unseen between the shoulders and his sword fell to the ground. The Noble 
Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) picked up the sword and 
said: “ N o w   w h o   w i l l   s a v e   y o u   f r o m   m e ?  ” Then he forgave him. The man 
returned to his tribe. Everyone was astonished at the bold, valiant ﬁghter, 
and asked him what had happened to him and why he had done nothing. 
He replied to them: “ That’s the way it happened. I have come now from 
the best of men. ” 2

ّمُ(cid:183)ٰ

In an incident similar to this at the Battle of Badr, a dissembler approached 
the  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  from  behind 
when  no  one  was  aware  of  it.  Just  as  he  was  raising  his  sword  to  strike, 
Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) turned and looked at him; the man trembled 
and his sword slipped to the ground. 3

The Fourth Event: This is well-known almost to the degree of ‘consen-
sus in meaning,’ and is given by most Qur’anic commentators as the imme-
diate reason for the revelation of the verse, 

 l k j i  *   g f e d c b a ` _ ^

It is also related by the most learned commentators and scholars of Hadith. 
They relate that Abu Jahl took an oath, saying: “ I shall strike Muhammad 
with a stone if I see him prostrating. ” He took a large stone and went to ﬁnd 
Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ). He lifted his hands to cast the stone when he

saw him prostrating, and they remained raised. Allah’s Messenger ( Upon 
whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  stood  up  on  completing  the  prayers,  and 
Abu Jahl’s hand was released. He could move it either because the Mes-
senger ( UWBP ) permitted, or because there was no longer any need for it 
to remain thus. 1

In a similar incident, a man from the same tribe as Abu Jahl, al-Walid 
b. Mughira according to one narration, went to the Ka‘ba with a large stone 
in his hand, to strike the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace )  while  he  was  prostrating,  but  the  man’s  eyes  were  sealed  and  he 
could not see the Messenger ( UWBP ) entering, nor was he able to see the 
people  who  had  sent  him;  he  could  only  hear  their  voices.  When  Allah’s 
Messenger  ( UWBP )  ﬁnished  praying,  his  eyes  were  opened,  for  no  need 
remained for them to be sealed. 2

Also, it is related through an authentic narration from Abu Bakr the Vera-
cious  that  after  the  Sura  about  Abu  Lahab  3  had  been  revealed,  his  wife, 
ِبَ(cid:143)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)ا  َةَ(cid:170)ا َ
ّ(cid:175)َ(cid:110)  ( the  wood  carrier )  Umm  Jamil,  came  to  the  Ka‘ba  with  a 
stone  in  her  hand.  She  saw  Abu  Bakr,  who  was  sitting  beside  the  Noble 
Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), and asked him, “ Where’s 
your friend? I hear that he mocked me. If I see him, I will hit him in the 
mouth with this rock. ” She could not see Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ), although he was sitting beside him. 4 Of course, a 
wood-carrier of Hell like that could not enter the presence of “ the Sultan of 
Lawlak, ” 5 who was under divine protection, and see him. How could she?

The Fifth Event: It is related through a sound narration that ‘Amir b. 
Tufayl and Arbad b. Qays conspired to assassinate Allah’s Noble Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). ‘Amir said: “ I’ll keep him busy, and 
you strike him. ” They went, but Arbad did not do anything. Amir asked him 
later why he did not strike him. Arbad answered: “ How could I? Every time 
I intended to hit him, I saw you between us. How could I have struck you? ” 6

The Sixth Event: It is related through an authentic narration that at the 
battle either of Uhud or Hunayn, Shayba b. ‘Uthman al-Hajabayya, whose 
uncle and father Hamza had killed, crept up stealthily on the Noble Messen-
ger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) in order to avenge them. On his 
raising his drawn sword, it suddenly slipped from his hand. Allah’s Messen-
ger ( UWBP ) turned and looked at him, putting his hand on his chest. Shayba 
later said: “ At that moment there was no one in the world I loved more. ” He 
believed in him. The Messenger ( UWBP ) told him to go and ﬁght. Shayba 
said: “ I went and fought in front of Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ). If I had 
come across my own father at that time, I would have struck him! ” 1

Also, on the day of the conquest of Mecca, a man called Fadala approached 
Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) with the intention 
of striking him. The Messenger ( UWBP ) looked at him, and said, smiling: 
“ W h a t   h a v e   y o u   t o l d   y o u r s e l f ?  ”, praying that he might be forgiven. Fadala 
became a believer, and said: “ At that moment there was no one in the world 
I loved more. ” 2

The Seventh Event: According to a sound narration, at the very moment 
some Jews, with the intention of assassinating him, were going to drop down 
a  large  rock  on  Allah’s  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace ) while he was sitting, he rose through divine protection; so the plot 
came to nothing. 3

There were many events similar to these seven. The scholars of Hadith, 
and  foremost  Imam  Bukhari  and  Imam  Muslim,  relate  from  ‘A’isha  that 
after the verse,  ( 5:67 )  ] \ [ Z  was revealed, Allah’s Mes-
senger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) told those who guarded him 
from  time  to  time:  َ

Messenger ( UWBP ), and was connected with him. His miracles were mani-
fested  in  every  one  of  them.  This  means  that  the  person  of  Muhammad 
( UWBP ) was the ofﬁcial and Messenger of Allah Almighty, but in regard 
to His titles of Creator of the Universe and Sustainer of all Creatures. For 
example, every ofﬁce or department of government knows and recognizes 
a high-ranking ofﬁcial, an inspector, of the king, and whichever of them 
he enters, those in it show an interest in him, for he acts in the name of the 
king of all of them. If he is only an inspector in the judiciary, then only 
that department of government recognizes him; the other ofﬁces do not. 
And if he is an inspector in the army, the civil service does not recognize 
him. It is understood, then, that all the realms and spheres of divine rule, 
every  species  and  group  from  the  angels  to  the  ﬂies  and  spiders,  knew 
and recognized Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), 
or  had  been  informed  about  him.  That  is  to  say,  he  was  the  Seal  of  the 
Prophets and the Messenger of the Sustainer of All the Worlds. And his 
messengership was more comprehensive and all-embracing than those of 
the preceding prophets.

SIXTEENTH SIGN

The wonders that took place before his prophetic mission, but which were 
related to it, are called i r h a s a t , and these too were indications and proofs of 
his prophethood. They were of three kinds: 

The First Kind

The First Kind

This  kind  of  i r h a s a t   comprises  the  tidings  of  Muhammad’s  ( UWBP ) 
prophethood  given  by  the  Torah,  the  Bible,  the  Psalms  of  David,  and  the 
scriptures revealed to other prophets, as stated by the Qur’an. Indeed, since 
those  Books  are  revealed  scriptures  and  those  who  brought  them  were 
prophets,  it  is  necessary  and  certain  that  they  should  have  mentioned  the 
one who would supersede their religions, change the shape of the universe, 
and  illuminate  half  the  earth  with  the  light  he  brought.  Is  it  possible  that 
those scriptures, which foretold insigniﬁcant events, would not speak of the 
most important phenomenon of humanity, the prophethood of Muhammad 
( UWBP )?  Yes,  since  they  would  certainly  speak  of  it,  they  would  either 
denounce it as a falsehood and so save their religions from destruction and 
their books from abrogation, or they would afﬁrm it, and through that man 
of  truth,  save  their  religions  from  superstition  and  corruption.  Now,  both 
friend and foe agree that there is no sign of any such denouncement in the 
scriptures, in which case there must be afﬁrmation. And since there is certain 

204

afﬁrmation, and since there is a deﬁnite reason and fundamental cause for 
such afﬁrmation, we too shall demonstrate through three categorical proofs 
the existence of this afﬁrmation:

First Proof

F i r s t   P r o o f :   Allah’s  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace )  says  to  them  through  the  tongue  of  the  Qur’an:  “ Your  scriptures 
describe  and  conﬁrm  me;  they  conﬁrm  me  in  the  things  I  say. ”  He  chal-
lenges them with verses such as,

 ( 3:93 ) K J I H G F E 
 Å Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ » 
( 3:61 ) Ê É È Ç Æ
Despite his continuously taunting them with verses such as these, no Jewish 
scholar or Christian priest was able to show that he had made any error. If 
they had been able to, those very numerous and very obdurate and jealous 
unbelievers and dissembling Jews and the whole world of unbelief would 
have proclaimed it everywhere. The Messenger ( UWBP ) also said: “ E i t h e r  
y o u   ﬁ n d   a n y   e r r o r   o f   m i n e ,   o r   I   s h a l l   ﬁ g h t   y o u   u n t i l   I   d e s t r o y   y o u !  ” And they 
chose war and wretchedness. That means they could not ﬁnd any error. For 
if they had, they would have been saved from all that.

Second Proof

S e c o n d   P r o o f :   The  words  of  the  Torah,  the  Bible,  and  the  Psalms  do 
not have the miraculousness of those of the Qur’an. They have also been 
translated again and again, and a great many alien words have become inter-
mingled with them. Also, the words of commentators and their false inter-
pretations have been confused with their verses. In addition, the distortions 
of the ignorant and the hostile have been incorporated into them. In these 
ways, the corruptions and alterations have multiplied in those Books. In fact, 
Shaikh Rahmatullah al-Hindi, the well-known scholar, proved to Jewish and 
Christian scholars and priests thousands of corruptions in them, and silenced 
them.  Nevertheless,  despite  these  corruptions,  in  our  times  the  celebrated 
Husain Jisri ( May Allah have mercy on him ) found one hundred and four-
teen  allusions  to  the  prophethood  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP ),  and  included 
them in his R i s a l a t   a l - H a m i d i y a . This was translated into Turkish by the late 
Ismail Hakkı of Manastır; whoever wishes may refer to it. 1

Also, many Jewish and Christian scholars acknowledged and admitted 
that the attributes of Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom be blessings and

205

peace ) were written in their scriptures. 1 The famous Roman Emperor Hera-
clius, who was a non-Muslim himself, said: “ Jesus foretold Muhammad’s 
coming. ” 2

Also, another Roman ruler called Muqawqis, the Governor of Egypt,  3 
and  celebrated  Jewish  scholars  and  leaders  such  as  Ibn  Suriya,  Zubayr  b. 
Batiya, Ibn Akhtab and his brother Ka‘b b. Asad, although remaining non-
Muslim, admitted: “ He is described in our Books. ” 4

Also, some of the well-known Jewish scholars and Christian priests gave 
up their obduracy on seeing Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) attributes as described 
in the above-mentioned books, and believed in him. They then pointed out 
these references to other Jewish and Christian scholars, and convinced them. 
Among them were the famous ‘Abdullah b. Salam, Wahb b. Munabbih, Abu 
Yasir,  the  two  sons  of  Sa‘ya,  Asid  and  Tha‘laba,  and  Shamul.  The  latter 
lived at the time of Tubba‘, the ruler of Yemen. 5 Shamul became a believer 
before Muhammad’s prophetic mission and without ever seeing him, just as 
Tubba‘ did. While the guest of the Bani Nadir before the prophetic mission, 
ٍىِ(cid:93)َ(cid:178) ُروُ(cid:183)ُ(cid:146)  ٌب(cid:192)ِرَ(cid:162) 
a  gnostic  called  Ibn  al-Hayyaban,  declared:  ِهِ(cid:98)َرْ(cid:107)ِ(cid:182) ُراَد اَذٰ(cid:182)  ّ
He  died  there.  Later,  when  that  tribe  was  at  war  with  Allah’s  Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), Asid and Tha‘laba came forward and 
cried out to the tribe: ﮱﮐاَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:193)َ(cid:182) ُنـْ(cid:92)ا ِه(cid:193)ِ(cid:158) ْمﯭﯧْ(cid:193)َ(cid:170)ِا َدَ(cid:183)َ(cid:150) ى ِذَ
ّ(cid:195)اَو “ By Allah, he 
is the one Ibn al-Hayyaban promised would come. Don’t ﬁght him! ” 6 But 
they did not heed him, and paid the penalty.

Also,  many  Jewish  scholars  like  Ibn  Yasin,  Mikhayriq,  and  Ka‘b  al-
Ahbar, became believers on seeing the prophetic attributes in their Books, 
and silenced those who did not accept faith. 1

There  was  also  the  famous  Christian  scholar  and  monk,  Bahira,  2  who 
was  mentioned  above:  Allah’s  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace ) was twelve years old when he went to Damascus with his uncle, and 
it was for his sake that Bahira invited the Quraysh. For he had seen a cloud 
casting its shadow on the travelling caravan. When it continued to do so, he 
realized that the one he was seeking had remained with the caravan, and he 
sent someone to fetch him. He told Abu Talib: “ Return to Mecca! The Jews 
are  exceedingly  jealous  and  will  resort  to  treachery,  for  his  attributes  are 
described in the Torah. ” 3

Also,  Nestor  the  Abyssinian,  and  the  ruler  of  that  country,  the  Negus, 
came to believe on seeing Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) attributes written in their 
Books. 4

Also, a well-known Christian scholar called Daghatr became a believer 
on  seeing  the  description  of  the  Prophet  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace ), and was martyred when he proclaimed this among the Byzantines. 5
Also, from the Christian leaders, Harith b. Abi Shumar al-Ghasani and 
the  prominent  rulers  and  religious  leaders  of  Damascus  such  as  Sahib  al-
Ilya, Heraclius, Ibn Natur and al-Jarud, entered the fold of Islam after seeing 
the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) description in their Books. 6 Of them, only Heraclius 
concealed his belief, for the sake of worldly rule. 7

Also,  like  these,  Salman  al-Farsi  had  formerly  been  a  Christian.  He 
searched  for  the  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace ) 
after seeing his description. 1

Also, a famous scholar called Tamim, and the well-known Abyssinian 
ruler, the Negus, and the Abyssinian Christians, and the priests of Najran, 
all unanimously declared that they had seen the Prophet’s ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ) description in their scriptures, and had come to believe 
in him. 2

Third Proof

T h e   T h i r d   P r o o f :  Here, as examples, we shall point out from the Gospel, 
the Torah, and the Psalms, a few instances of verses concerning our Prophet 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ).

First: In the Psalms, there is the following verse:
ّمُ(cid:183)ٰ
 3  ِةَرْ(cid:99)َ(cid:159)ْ(cid:170)ا َدْ(cid:151)َ(cid:92) ِةَ

ّ(cid:179) ُ

Here, “ One who will establish an exemplary model ” refers to the Prophet 
Muhammad ( UWBP ). 

A verse from the Gospels says:

اَ(cid:143)(cid:193)ِ(cid:171)ْ(cid:162)َراَ(cid:159)ْ(cid:170)ا ُمﯭﯧَ(cid:170)  َثَ(cid:151)ْ(cid:93)َ(cid:193)ِ(cid:170) ْمﯭﯧ(cid:193)ِ(cid:92)َاَو ىِ(cid:92)َا ىٰ(cid:170)ِا  ٌبِ(cid:182)اَذ ىّ

ِ(cid:178)ِا ُح(cid:193) ِ(cid:127) َ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)ا  َلاَ(cid:162)

T h e   M e s s i a h   s a i d :   “   I   a m   l e a v i n g   f o r   m y   f a t h e r   a n d   y o u r   f a t h e r,   s o   t h a t  

H e   m a y   s e n d   y o u   t h e   P a r a c l e t e , ” 4 that is, Ahmad Muhammad.

A second verse from the Gospels:

Paraclete,  meaning  ِل ِ(cid:142)اَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)اَو  ّ

One of the Seven ‘Abdullah’s, ‘Abdullah b. ‘Amr b. al-‘As, who made 
extensive  studies  of  the  earlier  scriptures,  and  ‘Abdullah  b.  Salam,  who 
was  the  earliest  to  accept  Islam  from  among  the  famous  Jewish  scholars, 
and the famous scholar Ka‘b al-Ahbar from among the Children of Israel, 
all  pointed  out  in  the  Torah,  which  was  not  then  corrupted  to  its  present 
extent, the following verse, which after addressing Moses, then addresses 
the prophet-yet-to-come:

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

In several places in the Gospels, 1 a prophet who will come after Jesus is 

referred to as “ the Master of the World. ” He is described as:
ّ(cid:174)ُاَو ِهِ(cid:92)  ُلِ(cid:98)اَ(cid:163)ُ(cid:192)  ٍد(cid:192) ِدَ(cid:110)  ْنِ(cid:174)  ٌب(cid:193) ِ(cid:139)َ(cid:162) ُهَ(cid:151)َ(cid:174)

َكِ(cid:170)ٰذﯬﯦ ُهُ(cid:99)َ

 2 

This  verse  indicates  that  a  prophet  will  come  with  a  sword,  charged  with 
waging  j i h a d .   “ Q a d i b   m i n   h a d i d   ( literally,  staff  of  iron ) ”  means  sword. 
And so will be his community. In agreement with the Biblical verse men-
tioned above, and referring to it as well as some other verses, the following 
Qur’anic verse at the end of Sura al-Fath also states that his community, like 
him, will be commanded to wage jihad: 

 M L K J I H G F E D C B 
( 48:29 ) Q P O N
In the thirty-third chapter of the ﬁfth book of the Torah, 3 there is the fol-

lowing verse: 

T h e  L o r d  c a m e  f r o m  S i n a i ,  r o s e  u p  u n t o  u s  f r o m  S a ‘ i r,  a n d  s h i n e d  f o r t h  
f r o m   M o u n t   P a r a n . 4 

In this verse, with the phrase “ the Lord came from Sinai, ” the prophet-
hood of Moses is mentioned; with the phrase “ rose up unto us from Sa‘ir ” 
( Sa‘ir being a mountain near Damascus ), the prophethood of Jesus is indi-
cated.  And  the  phrase  “ He  shined  forth  from  Mount  Paran ”  ( the  Paran 
Mountains being the mountains of Hijaz ), gives tidings of the prophethood of 
Muhammad ( UWBP ), as all will agree. Moreover, conﬁrming the sentence, 
( 48:29 ) ... @ ? > = is the following verse of the Torah concerning 
the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) Companions, who would shine forth from the Paran 
Mountains:

T h e   ﬂ a g s   o f   t h e   b l e s s e d   o n e s   w i l l   b e   w i t h   h i m ,   a n d   t h e y   w i l l   b e   o n   h i s  
r i g h t . 5 

In this verse, the Companions are described as “ the blessed ones, ” that 

is, his Companions are blessed, righteous men, the beloved ones of Allah.

In the forty-second chapter of the Book of Isaiah, there are the following 

verses:

S e e   M y   s e r v a n t ,   w h o m   I   u p h o l d ;   M y   C h o s e n   O n e ,   i n   w h o m   I   d e l i g h t .

l a n d s   b e y o n d   t h e   s e a s   h a v e   p u t   t h e i r   t r u s t   i n   h i m . 1 

Here, the verses explicitly describe Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ), the prophet of the end of time.

In the fourth chapter of the Book of Micah, are the following verses:

B u t   i n   t h e   l a s t   d a y s   i t   s h a l l   c o m e   t o   p a s s   t h a t   t h e   m o u n t a i n   o f   t h e

These  verses  obviously  describe  the  most  blessed  mountain  in  the  world, 
Mount ‘Arafat, and the worship and proclamations of “ Allah is Most Great! ” 
of those making the Hajj, who will ﬂock there from all climes, and the Com-
munity of Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), famous for 
the divine mercy it will receive.

In  the  seventy-second  chapter  of  the  Psalms,  there  are  the  following 

verses:

A n d   h e   w i l l   r e i g n   f r o m   s e a   t o   s e a ,

A l l   n a t i o n s   w i l l   p r a i s e   h i m . 1 

These  verses  describe  the  Glory  of  the  World,  the  Prophet  Muhammad 
( UWBP ) most evidently. Apart from Muhammad the Arabian, what prophet 
has come since David ( Upon whom be peace ) who has spread his religion 
from East to West, made kings pay tribute, and brought rulers to submission 
as though prostrating; to whom every day one ﬁfth of mankind offer ben-
edictions and prayers, and whose lights have irradiated from Medina? Has 
there been any other?

Again, the Turkish translation of John’s Gospel, chapter fourteen verse 

thirty, says:

I   s h a l l   n o t   s p e a k   w i t h   y o u   f o r   m u c h   l o n g e r,   f o r   t h e   r u l e r   o f   t h e   w o r l d  
i s   c o m i n g ,   a n d   I   a m   n o t h i n g   c o m p a r e d   w i t h   h i m .

Thus, the title “ Ruler of the World ” means Glory of the World. And the title 
Glory of the World is one of the most famous of Muhammad the Arabian’s 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) titles. 

Again in John’s Gospel, chapter sixteen verse seven, it says: 

B u t   I   a m   t e l l i n g   y o u   t h e   t r u t h .   M y   d e p a r t u r e   i s   b u t   f o r   y o u r   b e n e ﬁ t .  
F o r,   u n l e s s   I   d e p a r t ,   t h e   C o m f o r t e r   w i l l   n o t   c o m e .

Now see, who other than Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ) is the Ruler of the World and true consoler of men? Yes, 
the Glory of the World is he, and he is the one who will save transitory man 
from eternal extinction and thus comforts him.

Again, the eighth verse of chapter sixteen in John’s Gospel:

W h e n   h e   c o m e s ,   h e   w i l l   g i v e   t h e   w o r l d   c o n v i n c i n g   e v i d e n c e   c o n c e r n -

Who  other  than  Muhammad  the  Arabian  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and 
peace )  has  turned  the  world’s  wrongdoing  into  righteousness,  saved  men 
from sin and associating partners with Allah, and transformed politics and 
world rule?

Also from the Gospel of John, the eleventh verse of chapter sixteen:

1.    Yūsuf  Nabhānī,  Ḥ u j j a t   A l l ā h   ‘ a l ā ’ l - ‘ Ā l a m ī n ,  91-104;  Jisri,  R i s a l e - i   H a m i d i y e

Here “ the Ruler of the World ” is certainly Ahmad Muhammad ( UWBP ), 
for he is known as the Master of Humanity. 2

Also, in John’s Gospel, the thirteenth verse of chapter twelve: 3

B u t   w h e n   h e ,   t h e   S p i r i t   o f   Tr u t h ,   c o m e s ,   h e   w i l l   g u i d e   y o u   a l l   t o   t h e

This verse is explicit. Who apart from Muhammad the Arabian ( UWBP ) 
has  called  all  men  to  the  truth,  whose  every  statement  was  based  on  rev-
elation, has spoken what he had heard from Gabriel, and informed man in 
detail about the resurrection of the dead and the hereafter? Who other than 
he could do this?

Also, the Books of other prophets include names in Syriac and Hebrew 
that  correspond  to  the  various  names  of  the  Noble  Messenger  ( UWBP ), 
such as Muhammad, Ahmad, Mukhtar. For example, in the scriptures of the 
Prophet Shu‘ayb, his name is  ْحَ
ّ(cid:159)َ(cid:131)ُ(cid:174) 5 and means Muhammad. In the Torah, 
ّ(cid:179) َ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:179)ُ(cid:174) which again means Muhammad, and as اَ(cid:142)اَ(cid:193) ْ(cid:175) ِ(cid:110) 6 
he is mentioned as اَ
which  means  the  Prophet  of  al-Haram.  In  the  Psalms,  he  is  called  “ al-
Mukhtar. ” 7 Again in the Torah, the name is ْمَ(cid:98)اَ(cid:115)ْ(cid:170)ا ُمَ(cid:98)اَ(cid:115)ْ(cid:170)َا 8 Both in the Torah 
ّ(cid:179) ُ
and in the Psalms, it is ِةَ
ّ(cid:127)(cid:170)ا ُم(cid:193)ِ(cid:163)ُ(cid:174) 9 in the scriptures of Abraham and in the 
Torah, he is mentioned as ْزاَ(cid:174)ْزاَ(cid:174) 10 and again in the Torah, as ْدَ(cid:193)ْ(cid:110)َا .

1.  Yūsuf Nabhānī, Ḥ u j j a t   A l l ā h   ‘ a l ā ’ l - ‘ Ā l a m ī n , 95-7; a l - A n w ā r   a l - M u ḥ a m m a d ī y y a .
2.  Yes, he is such a lord and ruler that in most centuries for one thousand three hundred 
and ﬁfty years he has had at least three hundred and ﬁfty million followers and subjects, 
who have obeyed his commands in complete submission, and every day renew their al-
legiance to him by calling down Allah’s blessings on him. ( Author )

himself  said:  ُدَ(cid:193)ْ(cid:110)َا ِة(cid:192) ٰرْوَ
1 In fact, the Bible refers to him as ِةَواَرِ(cid:183)ْ(cid:170)اَو  ِب(cid:193) ِ(cid:139)َ(cid:163)ْ(cid:170)ا  ُب ِ(cid:110)اَ(cid:134) “ The one with 
the sword and the staff. ” 2 Indeed, the greatest of the prophets who wielded 
the sword, and was charged with ﬁghting in Allah’s way together with his 
community, was Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). 
The Gospels also describe him as  ْجاَ
ّ(cid:99)(cid:170)ا  ُب ِ(cid:110)اَ(cid:134)  3 Yes, this title is particular 
to Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ), for “ crown ” means turban, for in former 
days, it was the Arabs who as a people, all wore the turban and headband. 
This deﬁnitely therefore refers to Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ).

The term ْط(cid:193)ِ(cid:171)ْ(cid:162)َراَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:170)َا in the Gospel, or ْط(cid:193)ِ(cid:171)ْ(cid:162)َراَ(cid:159)ْ(cid:170)َا is deﬁned in Biblical inter-
pretation as “ the one who distinguishes truth from falsehood. ” 4 It is there-
fore the name of one who in the future will lead people to the truth.

In one place in the Gospels, Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ) says: “ I am 
going so that the Lord of the World may come. ” 5 Who other than the Noble 
Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) has come after Jesus who 
will be the Ruler of the World, distinguish and separate truth from falsehood, 
and guide mankind in place of Jesus? That is to say, Jesus ( Upon whom be 
peace ) was constantly giving his community the good news: Another will 
come; no need will remain for me. I am his forerunner and herald. Conﬁrm-
ing this is the following verse of the Qur’an:

 1 0 / . - , + * ) ( ' & % $ # " !
( 61:6 ) 8 7 6 5 4 3 2
Yes, in the Gospels, Jesus gave the glad tidings many times, that the great-
est leader of mankind would come. He is mentioned with various names, in, 
of course, Syriac and Hebrew – and has been seen by scholars – which bear

the meaning of Ahmad, Muhammad, and the Distinguisher between Truth 
and Falsehood. 1 That is to say, on many occasions Jesus ( Upon whom be 
peace ) told of the coming of Ahmad ( UWBP ). 2

Q u e s t i o n :  Why is it that while the other prophets foretell the coming of 
Muhammad ( UWBP ), Jesus ( UWP ) does so more fully and in the form of 
good news?

T h e   A n s w e r :  Because Ahmad ( UWBP ) defended Jesus ( UWP ) against 
the fearsome denials and slander of the Jews, and saved his religion from 
corruption. Furthermore, in the face of the burdensome Shari‘a of the Chil-
dren of Israel, who did not recognize Jesus, he came with an elevated Shari‘a 
which was easy, all-encompassing, and completed the deﬁciencies of Jesus’ 
Shari‘a. For these reasons, Jesus often gave the good news: the Ruler of the 
World will come! 3

Now it is clear that in the Torah, the Gospels, the Psalms of David, and in 
the scriptures of other prophets, there are numerous discussions of a prophet 
who  is  to  come  at  a  later  time,  many  verses  mentioning  him.  Just  as  we 
pointed out examples of these, showing that he is mentioned in these Books 
under various names. Who, other than Muhammad ( UWBP ), the Prophet of 
the end of time, could it be that these scriptures of the prophets speak of so 
repeatedly in their verses, and with such importance?

The  signs  of  prophethood  that  were  manifested  by  way  of  irhasat  also 
include  those  tidings  of  his  coming  given  before  his  prophetic  mission  in

saints and gnostics at that time; they published their claims and passed them

down to subsequent generations in their poetry. These are numerous, and we 
shall mention some that are well-known and have been accepted and nar-
rated by the scholars of history and the Prophet’s life. 

F i r s t :   One  of  the  rulers  of  Yemen,  called  Tubba‘,  saw  descriptions  of 
Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) in former scriptures, and believed in him. He 
announced this by means of a poem, which went like this:

That is, I would have been like ‘Ali.

S e c o n d :   Quss  b.  Sa‘ida  was  the  most  renowned  and  most  signiﬁcant 
orator  of  the  Arabs,  a  monotheist,  and  man  of  enlightened  mind.  Before 
Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) prophetic mission, he announced his messengership 
with these lines:

scriptures, and believing in him, longed to see him. When ‘Abd al-Muttalib, 
Muhammad’s grandfather, went to Yemen with some of the Quraysh, Sayf 
summoned them and said:

“ A child will be born in Hijaz, with a mark between his shoulders resem-
bling a seal. He will be the leader of all humanity. ” Then, in private he told 
‘Abd al-Muttalib: “ You are his grandfather, ” 1 foretelling his mission in a 
wondrous way.

F i f t h :  Waraqa b. Nawfal was a cousin of Khadija. When the ﬁrst rev-
elation came, the Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) was deeply shaken. Khadija 
described the event to the well-known Waraqa b. Nawfal, who told her to 
send him to him. Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ) went to Waraqa and told him 
how the revelation had come. Waraqa said:

“ Good news, O Muhammad! I testify that you are the awaited prophet who

revelation.

S i x t h :  Before the prophetic mission, a gnostic called Athkalan al-Him-
yari asked the Quraysh when he saw them: “ Is there anyone among you who 
claims prophethood? ” They replied in the negative. He again asked them at 
the start of his mission, and this time their reply was afﬁrmative. Athkalan 
said: “ The world is awaiting him! ” 3

S e v e n t h :  Ibn al-‘Ala, a famous Christian scholar, told of Allah’s Messen-
ger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) before his mission, never having 
seen him. He later came, saw the Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ), and said:

“ By the One who sent you in truth, I found your description in the Gospels, 
and the Son of Mary gave glad tidings of your coming. ” 1

E i g h t h :  Mentioned above was the Negus of Abyssinia, who declared: 
ّ(cid:127)(cid:170)ا ِه ِذٰ(cid:182)  ْنـَ(cid:150)  ً(cid:202)َدَ(cid:92) ُهَ(cid:99)َ(cid:174)ْد ِ(cid:114) ىِ(cid:170)  َتْ(cid:193)َ(cid:170)  “ Would  that  I  had  been  the  servant  of 
ِةَ(cid:179)َ(cid:143)ْ(cid:171) َ
Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), rather than 
a king. To serve him would have been far superior to this sovereignty. ” 2

In addition to these tidings given by these learned men through divine 
inspiration from the Unseen, soothsayers too gave news from the Unseen 
of the coming of Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), 
and of his prophethood, by means of jinn and spirit beings. These are numer-
ous also, and we shall mention a few which are well-known, have reached 
the degree of ‘consensus in meaning,’ and are related in most of the books 
of  history  and  the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  biography.  Referring  the  lengthy 
accounts of them to those books, we shall give only a summary of them.

The First is the famous soothsayer, Shiqq, who had only one eye, one 
arm, and one leg; he was quite simply half a man. His repeated predictions 
concerning Muhammad’s ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) messenger-
ship have passed into the history books, with the certainty of consensus in 
meaning. 3

The  Second  is  the  famous  soothsayer  of  Damascus,  Satīh,  who  was  a 
monstrosity lacking bones, and even limbs, whose face was in his chest and 
who lived a very long time. He was highly reputed at that time for the cor-
rect information he gave concerning the Unseen. The Persian king, Chos-
roes, even, sent a learned envoy called Mubezan to ask Satih to interpret a 
strange dream he had at the time of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) birth, in which 
the  fourteen  pinnacles  of  his  palace  collapsed.  Satih  said:  “ Fourteen  men 
will rule over you, then your empire will be destroyed. Also someone will 
come who will announce a religion; he will abolish both your religion and 
your empire, ” sending news of this to Chosroes. In this way, Satih explicitly 
foretold the coming of the Prophet of the end of time. 4

NINETEENTH LETTER – SIXTEENTH SIGN

219

As written in detail in the books of history and the Prophet’s biography, 
soothsayers like Sawad b. Qarib al-Dawsi, Khunaﬁr, Af‘a Najran, Jidhl b. 
Jidhl al-Kindi, Ibn Khalasat al-Dawsi, and Fatima bint al-Nu‘man al-Najar-
iyya, foretold the coming of the Prophet of the end of time, stating that that 
Prophet was Muhammad ( UWBP ). 1

Also,  one  of  ‘Uthman’s  relations,  Sa‘d  b.  bint  al-Kurayz,  received 
knowledge from the Unseen by means of soothsaying about the prophethood 
of Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). In the early days of 
Islam, he told ‘Uthman Dhi’l-Nurayn to go and accept faith. ‘Uthman did so 
and entered the fold of Islam at the beginning. Sa‘d expressed the event with 
a poem, which went like this:

  2   ّ

ِقَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)ا ىَ(cid:170)ِا ى ِدْ(cid:183)َ(cid:192) ُ

ّ(cid:195)ا ىَدَ(cid:182)

Like soothsayers, jinns who were invisible but whose voices were heard, 
called  h ā t i f ,  repeatedly  foretold  the  coming  of  Allah’s  Noble  Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). For example:

An invisible jinn shouted out the following to Dhayab b. al-Harith, and 

was the reason that he and others accepted Islam: 

َباَ(cid:107)ُ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)ا  َبَ(cid:107)َ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)ا  ِع َ(cid:175) ْ(cid:126)ِا  ُباَ(cid:192)َذ اَ(cid:192)  ُباَ(cid:192)َذ اَ(cid:192)

ّ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ُ(cid:174)  َث ِ(cid:151)ُ(cid:92)

Another unseen jinn called out to Sama‘ b. Qarrat al-Ghatafani, 

َع َ(cid:175)َ(cid:163)ْ(cid:178)اَ(cid:158)  ٌل ِ(cid:142)اَ(cid:92) َرّ

ّقَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)ا َءاَ(cid:106) and caused him and some others to believe. 4
Such  messages  and  good  tidings  given  by  unseen  jinns  are  extremely 

ِ(cid:174)ُدَو َعَ(cid:143)َ(cid:127)َ(cid:158) ُ

well-known and numerous.

Just as the voices of jinns and the soothsayers foretold him, so too idols 
and  sacriﬁces  slaughtered  for  the  idols  gave  news  of  the  prophethood  of 
Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ). For example:

One is the famous story of the idol of the Mazan tribe, who shouted out:

accept  Islam:  there  was  an  idol  called  Dimar,  which  one  day  called  out:

Before he accepted Islam, ‘Umar heard an animal sacriﬁced to an idol 

exclaim: ُ

There are very many more examples like these, which have been accepted 

as authentic and narrated in reliable books.

And just as soothsayers, gnostics, invisible jinns, and even idols and sac-
riﬁces  told  of  Muhammad’s  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  mes-
sengership, and each instance was the cause of people coming to believe in 
him, so too inscriptions on stones over and in graves, and on gravestones, 
like ﮯﮑ(cid:193)ِ(cid:174)َا ٌحــِ(cid:171) ْ(cid:135)ُ(cid:174) ٌد َ
ّ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ُ(cid:174) were the means of some people coming to believe. 
4 Because, in the time shortly before Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ) lived, there were only seven men bearing that name, and not one 
of them deserved the epithet of righteous and trustworthy. 5

These are i r h a s a t  including the wondrous events which occurred at the 
time  of,  and  in  conjunction  with,  the  birth  of  Allah’s  Noble  Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). There were also events that occurred 
before his prophetic mission which were miracles. They were many and we 
shall mention a few examples that became famous, have been accepted by 
the authorities on Hadiths, and whose authenticity have been established.

The First: On the night of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) birth, both his mother, 
and the mothers of ‘Uthman b. al-‘As and ‘Abd al-Rahman b. ‘Awf, who 
were with her, saw a brilliant, widely scattered light, about which they said: 
“ At the time of his birth we saw a light so bright it lit up the east and the 
west for us. ” 1

The Second: That night most of the idols in the Ka‘ba toppled over and 

fell to the ground. 2

The Third: That night the famous a y w a n  of Chosroes’ palace shook and 

cracked apart, and its fourteen pinnacles collapsed. 3

The Fourth: That night the small lake of Saveh, which was considered 
to be holy, sank into the ground, 4 and at Istakhrabad the ﬁre which, burning 
continuously  for  a  thousand  years,  the  Zoroastrians  had  worshipped,  was 
extinguished. 5

These four events indicated that the person who had just been born would 
abolish  ﬁre-worship,  destroy  the  palace  of  the  Persian  kings,  and  prevent 
those things being sanctiﬁed that Allah did not permit.

The  Fifth:  Although  they  did  not  coincide  with  the  night  of  Muham-
mad’s ( UWBP ) birth, certain events that took place not long before it are 
also included in the i r h a s a t . One is the War of the Elephant, which is men-
tioned  in  the  Qur’an  in  Sura  al-Fil.  Abraha,  the  king  of  Abyssinia,  came 
to  destroy  the  Ka‘ba,  driving  a  huge  elephant  called  Mahmudi  before  his 
forces. When they came close to Mecca, the elephant was unable to move. 
They could not make it move forward, and had to retreat. While retreating, 
a ﬂock of birds attacked and routed them, and they ﬂed. This extraordinary 
story is recorded in detail in the history books. The event was one of the 
proofs of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) prophethood, for it occurred close in time 
to his birth and saved the Holy Ka‘ba, his q i b l a , birthplace, and native land, 
from Abraha’s destruction. 6

The  Sixth:  According  to  the  testimony  of  Halima  al-Sa‘diya  and  her 
husband,  when  Allah’s  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace ) 
was  with  them  in  his  childhood,  they  frequently  saw  a  cloud  above  him 
shielding him from the sun. They told everyone this, and it was well-known 
and authenticated. 1

Also,  as  testiﬁed  to  by  the  monk  Bahira,  when  the  Noble  Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) went to Damascus at the age of twelve, 
he saw a cloud casting a shadow over his head, and he pointed this out. 2

Again  before  his  prophetic  mission,  one  time  Allah’s  Messenger 
( UWBP ) returned from a trading journey he made together with Khadija’s 
servant, Maysara, when Khadija saw two angels shading him like clouds. 
She mentioned this to her servant Maysara, and he replied: “ I observed the 
same thing throughout our journey. ” 3

The Seventh: It is established in a sound narration that before his pro-
phetic mission, Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) sat 
down under a tree. Although the place was dried up, it suddenly grew green. 
The tree’s branches inclined over his head, twisting back and shading him. 4
The Eighth: When the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace )was small, he stayed in Abu Talib’s house. Whenever he ate together 
with  Abu  Talib  and  his  household,  they  would  eat  to  repletion;  whereas 
when he was not present, they were not satisﬁed. 5 This is both well-known 
and deﬁnite. 6

Also, Umm Ayman, who looked after and served the Noble Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) when he was small, said: “ Allah’s 
Messenger ( UWBP ) never complained about being hungry or thirsty, nei-
ther when small nor when he was older. ” 7

The Ninth: It is both well-known and deﬁnite that unlike other members 
of her tribe, his wet-nurse Halima al-Sa‘diya’s goats and possessions were 
very productive and abundant. 1

Also, ﬂies did not bother him; they never alighted on his clothes or blessed 
body 2 – just as one of his progeny, Sayyid ‘Abd al-Qadir Gilani, received 
this legacy from his forefather, for ﬂies never alighted on him either. 3

The Tenth: After Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ) was born, and especially on the night of his birth, there was a 
great increase in falling stars.  4 As shown with decisive proofs in the Fif-
teenth Word, falling stars are a sign of jinns and devils being barred from 
receiving news of the Unseen. Thus, since Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ) had appeared in the world together with revelation, 
it  was  necessary  to  prevent  the  knowledge  about  the  Unseen  being  trans-
mitted by soothsayers, diviners, and jinn, which was inaccurate and mixed 
with lies, so that their knowledge should not cause any doubts about revela-
tion, and should not resemble it. Before the prophetic mission, soothsaying 
was widespread. Then with its revelation, the Qur’an brought it to an end. 
Indeed, many soothsayers accepted Islam, for they could no longer ﬁnd their 
informers,  who  were  jinns.  That  is,  the  Qur’an  had  put  an  end  to  it.  And 
these days a new type of soothsaying has appeared in the form of mediums 
among the spiritualists of the West. But we shall not go into that now.

I n   S h o r t :   Very  many  events  occurred  and  persons  appeared  conﬁrm-
ing and causing others to conﬁrm the prophethood of the Noble Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) before the commencement of his mis-
sion. For sure, before the appearance of the one who was going to be the 
ruler of the world 5 and would change the world’s spiritual shape, and would

make this world into the tillage for the next, and proclaim the high value of 
the creatures of the world, and show to man and jinn the way to eternal hap-

isman of the world and riddle of the wisdom in its creation, and would know 
and make known the purposes of the universe’s Creator, and recognize the 
Creator and acquaint Him to all men – before such a one appeared, surely 
everything, all species and realms of beings would be happy at his coming, 
would await him and welcome and applaud him, and if his coming was made 
known to them by their Creator, they in turn would announce it. Indeed, we 
saw in the above Signs and examples how each realm of creature displayed 
his miracles as if welcoming him, and conﬁrmed his prophethood through 
the tongue of miracles.

SEVENTEENTH SIGN

After the Qur’an, the greatest miracle of Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) was his own self. That is, the elevated moral 
virtues brought together in his person, which as friend and foe agreed was in 
all respects of the very highest degree. A hero of the greatest bravery, ‘Ali, 
said again and again: “ Whenever the ﬁghting grew ﬁerce, we would take 
refuge behind Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ). ” 
1  Like  this,  his  was  the  highest  and  unattainable  degree  of  all  praisewor-
thy qualities. For this greatest miracle, we refer readers to the a l - S h i f a ’  a l -
S h a r i f  of Qadi Iyad, the learned scholar of the Maghrib, for he described and 
proved beautifully this miracle of praiseworthy moral qualities.

A  further  great  miracle  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP )  which  is  veriﬁed  by 
friend and foe alike is his illustrious Shari‘a, the like of which neither came 
before it nor will come after it. For a partial explanation of it, we refer read-
ers  to  the  thirty-three  Wo r d s ,  thirty-three  L e t t e r s ,  thirty-one  F l a s h e s ,  and 
thirteen R a y s  which we have written.

Among his greatest miracles, a certain one, the many reports of which 
are unanimous, is the Splitting of the Moon. This miracle is related through 
many chains of transmission from many of the leading Companions like Ibn 
Mas‘ud, Ibn ‘Abbas, Ibn ‘Umar, ‘Ali, Anas, and Hudhayfa. In addition, the 
Qur’an announced this supreme miracle to the whole world with the verse:

( 54:1 ) ﮯ ~ } | 
The obdurate idolators of the Quraysh at that time could not deny what 
this verse states; they could only declare that it was “ magic. ” 2 That is to say,

the unbelievers also conﬁrmed the splitting of the moon as certain. For this 
supreme miracle, we refer readers to the Addendum of the Thirty-First Word.
Furthermore, just as the Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) showed the inhabit-
ants of the earth the miracle of the Splitting of the Moon, so too he showed 
the inhabitants of the heavens his supreme miracle of the Ascension. Refer-
ring that greatest miracle to the Tr e a t i s e   o n   t h e   A s c e n s i o n , the Thirty-First 
Word,  which  demonstrates  with  decisive  proofs  –  even  to  deniers  –  how 
luminous,  exalted,  and  true  a  miracle  it  was,  we  shall  mention  here  only 
his journey to Jerusalem, the preliminary part of the miracle of the Ascen-
sion. For it was a miracle too that when asked by the Quraysh the following 
morning, he provided them with a description of the Masjid al-Aqsa. It was 
as follows:

The morning after the night of the Ascension, he informed the Quraysh 
about  the  Ascension.  They  dismissed  it  as  false,  and  said:  “ If  you  really 
went to the Masjid al-Aqsa in Jerusalem, then describe to us its doors, walls, 
and condition. ” The Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) later said: 
ّ(cid:171)َ(cid:107)َ(cid:158) ُ
ّ(cid:195)ا ىَ

“ I was annoyed by their question and denial in a way that I had never been 
annoyed before. Suddenly, Allah Almighty lifted the veil between me and 
the Masjid al-Aqsa and showed it to me; I looked at it, and saw and described 
it. ” 1 Then the Quraysh understood that he was giving the correct and com-
plete description.

Allah’s Noble Messenger ( UWBP ) also told them: “ During the journey, 
I saw one of your caravans. It will arrive here tomorrow at such-and-such 
a  time. ”  They  waited  for  the  caravan.  It  was  delayed  for  an  hour,  so  in 
order that the Messenger’s ( UWBP ) prediction should be right, the sun was 
arrested for an hour, as is conﬁrmed by those who investigated the event. 
That is to say, in order to prove what he said was right, the earth stopped its 
journeying, its duty, for an hour, and its immobility was shown as the sun 
being arrested in its motion. 2

EIGHTEENTH SIGN

The greatest miracle of Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace ), an eternal one, is the All-Wise Qur’an, which comprises 
hundreds of evidences of his prophethood, and forty aspects of whose own 
miraculousness  have  been  proven.  The  Twenty-Fifth  Word  has  explained 
concisely and proved those forty aspects in its approximately one hundred 
and ﬁfty pages. Therefore, referring that supreme miracle, a treasury of mir-
acles, to that Wo r d , here we shall explain only one or two points.

First Point

First Point

I f   i t   i s   a s k e d : The miraculousness of the Qur’an lies in its eloquence. But 
all classes of men have the right to a share of its understanding, and only one 
learned scholar out of a thousand can understand the miraculousness in its 
eloquence?

T h e  A n s w e r :  The All-Wise Qur’an has a different kind of miraculousness 
corresponding to the understanding of each class; it indicates the existence 
of its miraculousness to each in a different way. For example, to the scholars 
of rhetoric and eloquence, it exhibits the miraculousness of its extraordinary 
eloquence. To the poets and orators, it shows its exalted, beautiful, and origi-
nal style, which no one can imitate although it pleases everyone. The passage 
of time does not cause its style to age; it always remains fresh and new. Its 
prose and word-order are so well-ordered that it is both elevated and pleas-
ant. To soothsayers and other diviners of the Unseen, it displays its miracu-
lousness in its extraordinary reports concerning the Unseen. To historians, it 
demonstrates its miraculousness by giving information concerning events of 
past ages, as well as those of the future, and of the Intermediate Realm and 
the hereafter. To social and political scientists, it shows the miraculousness 
in its sacred principles. Yes, the Supreme Shari‘a, which proceeds from the 
Qur’an, indicates that mystery of miraculousness. To those occupied with 
knowledge of Allah and cosmic truths, it shows the miraculousness of the 
sacred divine truths in the Qur’an, or else it indicates the existence of that 
miraculousness. To the Suﬁs and saints, it shows the miraculousness in the 

NINETEENTH LETTER – EIGHTEENTH SIGN

227

hidden mysteries of its verses, which constantly rise and fall like waves in 
the sea of the Qur’an. And so on. To each of forty classes of men, it opens 
up a window and shows its miraculousness. The ordinary people even, who 
only listen to the Qur’an understanding a little of its meaning, conﬁrm that it 
does not resemble any other book. They say: “ The Qur’an is either inferior 
to all the other books we have heard read, which not even an enemy could 
claim – just as it is impossible – or it is superior to all of them and is thus a 
miracle. ” Now, in order to help him, we shall explain further the miraculous-
ness which the ordinary man understood by just listening. It is as follows:

When  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  appeared  challenging  the 

whole world, it aroused passionate feelings of two kinds in people:

The First: In friends, the desire to imitate it; that is, the desire to resem-

ble the style of their beloved Qur’an, and a wish to speak like it.

The Second: In enemies, the desire to criticize and dispute it; that is, the 

wish to invalidate its claim of miraculousness by competing with its style.

Thus,  because  of  these  two  intense  emotions,  millions  of  books  were 
written  in  Arabic,  and  are  to  be  seen.  Now,  whoever  listens  to  the  most 
eloquent,  the  most  brilliant,  of  these  books  being  read  together  with  the 
Qur’an is bound to say that it does not resemble any of them. That means 
that the Qur’an is not of the same level as them. In which case, it must either 
be inferior to all of them, which together with being impossible a hundred 
times over, no one, not even Satan, could claim, or the Qur’an of Miraculous 
Exposition is superior to all of them.

Furthermore,  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  demonstrates  its  miraculousness 
before the uneducated mass of people, who do not understand its meaning, 
by not wearying them. Indeed, they say: “ If I hear the ﬁnest and best known 
poems two or three times, I become bored of them. But the Qur’an never 
wearies me; the more I listen to it, even, the more it pleases me. It cannot 
therefore be written by man. ” 

To children who try to memorize it, the All-Wise Qur’an shows its mirac-
ulousness  by  settling  in  their  memories  with  the  greatest  of  ease,  despite 
their small, delicate, weak and simple heads being unable to retain for long a 
single page of other books, and many of the verses and phrases of that large 
Qur’an resembling one another, which should cause muddle and confusion.
Even to the sick and the dying, who are disturbed by the slightest sound 
and noise, the murmuring sound of the Qur’an makes felt a sort of its mirac-
ulousness, by being as sweet and agreeable for them as Zamzam water.

228

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

I n   S h o r t :  The All-Wise Qur’an demonstrates its miraculousness to forty 
different  classes  and  groups  of  people,  or  it  indicates  the  existence  of  its 
miraculousness.  It  neglects  no  one.  Even  for  those  who  can  comprehend 
only what their eyes see and who have no ear to hear with, no heart to feel 
with, and no knowledge to judge with, the Qur’an alludes to its miraculous-
ness in a fashion. 1 It is like this: 

In the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition handwritten by the calligrapher 
Haﬁz  Osman  and  later  printed,  many  of  the  words  look  to  one  another. 
For  example,  if  a  needle  is  passed  through  the  word  “ dog ”  in  the  phrase 
S R in Sura al-Kahf ( 18:22 ) and through the underlying pages, 
with a slight deviation it will go through the word ] in Sura al-Fatir 
( 35:13 )  ,  thus  establishing  the  dog’s  name.  In  a  similar  way,  the  words 
ﹶﻦﻳﺮ ﹶﻀ ﹾﺤ ﹸﻣ occur twice in Sura Ya. Sin. ( 36:32, 53, 75 ) , the ﬁrst overly-
Ò  
ing the second. The same words are again repeated twice in Sura al-Saffat 
( 37:57, 127 ), and these look both to each other and to those in Sura Ya. Sin. 
Also, the phrase “ in pairs ” ¼ occurs only three times in the Qur’an, and 
two of these corresponding cannot be mere coincidence. 2 There are numer-
ous similar examples. One word even coincides with slight deviation on ﬁve 
or six underlying pages. I have seen a copy of the Qur’an in which passages 
looking to one another on facing pages were written in red ink. At that time 
I said that that too indicated another sort of miracle. Some time later I saw 
that many phrases looked to others on the reverse of pages, corresponding to 
one another in a meaningful way. Thus, since the arrangement of the Qur’an 
in the writing and script of printed copies of the Qur’an also is through the 
guidance of the Prophet ( UWBP ) and divine inspiration, it is a sort of sign 
of its miraculousness. For it is neither the work of chance, nor of the human 
mind. Sometimes there are deviations, but that is generally the fault of the 
printing and if it had been absolutely in order, the words would have cor-
responded to one another exactly.

1.  Here the mention of the aspect of its miraculousness directed to those without ear, 
heart  and  knowledge,  and  who  see  only  with  their  eyes,  is  extremely  concise,  abbrevi-
ated, and even deﬁcient. But it has been demonstrated most clearly and brilliantly in the 
Twenty-Ninth and Thirtieth Letters,* so that even the blind can see it. We have had a copy 
of the Qur’ān written that shows this aspect of miraculousness. Allah willing, it will be 
published, then everyone will be able to see it.

* The Thirtieth Letter had been planned and intended, but it gave up its place to I s h ā r ā t  

a l - I ‘ j ā z  ( S i g n s   o f   M i r a c u l o u s n e s s  ), while itself never materialized. ( Author )

2.  The phrase occuring towards the end of Sūra al-Sabā’ ( 34:46 ) corresponds to the 

same phrase as the beginning of Sūra al-Fāṭir ( 35:1 ) .

NINETEENTH LETTER – EIGHTEENTH SIGN

229

Furthermore, on every page of the Qur’an’s Suras of long and medium 
length which were revealed in Medina, the word “ Allah ” has been repeated 
in the most wondrous manner. In addition to being repeated mostly ﬁve, six, 
seven, eight, nine or eleven times on the same page, the repetitions of the 
two sides of the same page or on facing pages display beautiful and signiﬁ-
cant numerical relationships. 1, 2, 3, 4

1.  Also, for those who practise the recitation of the divine names and praises and sup-
plicate Allah,  the  Qur’ān’s  adorned  and  rhymed  words,  and  eloquent  and  artistic  style, 
and the many virtues of its eloquence, which draw attention to itself, afford an elevated 
seriousness  and  sense  of  the  divine  presence,  and  a  collectedness  of  mind;  they  do  not 
mar or spoil these. Whereas, rhetoric, artistic wording, rhyme and poetic composition of 
that sort usually weaken seriousness, make their elegance felt, disturb the sense of Allah’s 
presence, and distract attention. In fact, I used to recite Imām al-Shāﬁ’ī’s famous supplica-
tion frequently, for it is a most subtle and serious supplication, is composed in an elevated 
versiﬁed form, and once caused the end of dearth and famine in Egypt. On reading it, I 
observed that it was in verse and rhymed, and that this spoilt its lofty seriousness. I recited 
it constantly for eight or nine years, and I was unable to reconcile the verse and rhyme 
with its serious nature. I understood from this that there is a sort of miraculousness in the 
rhyming and ordering and qualities of the Qur’ān’s words, which are particular and natural 
and original to it, that preserves completely the seriousness and sense of the divine pres-
ence, not spoiling them. Thus, even if those who recite supplications and the divine names 
and praises do not understand this sort of miraculousness with the mind, they perceive it 
with the heart.

2.  Another aspect of the Qur’ān of Miraculous Exposition’s miraculousness is that it 
expresses the most elevated and brilliant degree of the Noble Messenger’s ( UWBP ) be-
lief, who manifested the Greatest Name. It also expresses and instructs in a natural manner 
the religion of truth, which, being most vast, extensive, and lofty, sets forth the lofty truths 
of the worlds of the hereafter and of dominicality like a sacred map. It conveys too in all 
its inﬁnite glory and majesty, the address of the Creator of the universe, in respect of His 
being the Sustainer of all beings. Certainly, in the face of its exposition being thus, if, in 
accordance with the verse,

( 17:88 )

 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 / . - ,

all the minds of mankind were to unite and become a single mind, they could not contest 
ّ(cid:103)(cid:170)ا  َنـِ(cid:174) ىَرَ
it or oppose it. How could they? اَ
ّ(cid:103)(cid:170)ا  َنـْ(cid:192)َا For in view of the three above prin-
ciples, it is certainly not possible to imitate the Qur’ān, nor to compose its like.

ّ(cid:192)َرُ

3.  At the bottom of every page of the Qur’ān, the verses are complete and they end 
rhyming in a ﬁne way. The reason is this: when the verse called M u d ā y a n a  ( 2:292 ) pro-
vides the standard for the pages, and the Sūras Ikhlāṣ and Kawthar, the standard for the 
lines, this ﬁne quality of the All-Wise Qur’ān and sign of its miraculousness become ap-
parent.

4.  Because of unfortunate haste, we had to content ourselves in this section with some 
slight indications and brief instances and small signs of a highly important and magniﬁ-
cent wonder, one which from the point of view of the Risale-i Nur’s success is beautiful, 
illuminating, and encouraging. Now, that important truth and encouraging wonder – un-
der the name of ‘coincidence’ ( t e v â f u k  ), and ﬁve or six sorts at that – forms a chain ==

At  the  time  of  Moses  ( Upon  whom  be  peace ),  it  was  magic  that  was 
prevalent, so his most important miracles resembled it. And at Jesus ( Upon 
whom be peace )’s time, it was medicine that was prevalent and his miracles 
were mostly of that kind. Similarly, at the time of the Most Noble Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), in the Arabian Peninsula four things 
were prevalent: 

T h e   F i r s t :  Eloquence and rhetoric.
T h e   S e c o n d :  Poetry and oratory.
T h e   T h i r d :  Soothsaying and divining matters of the Unseen.
T h e   F o u r t h :  Knowledge of past events and cosmology.
Thus, when the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition appeared, it challenged 

those with knowledge of these four ﬁelds.

F i r s t l y ,  it made the men of rhetoric and eloquence bow before it; they all 

listened to it in astonishment. 

S e c o n d l y ,  it ﬁlled the poets and orators with amazement, that is, those 
who spoke well and declaimed ﬁne poetry, so that they bit their ﬁngers in 
astonishment. It nulliﬁed the value of their ﬁnest poems inscribed in gold, 
causing them to remove the famous Seven Hanging Poems, their pride and 
glory, from the walls of the Ka‘ba.

It silenced the soothsayers and sorcerers, who gave news of the Unseen, 
and made them forget the knowledge they had received. It drove away the 
jinns, and put an end to soothsaying.

It saved those with knowledge of the past and cosmology from supersti-
tion and falsehood, and instructed them in true facts and luminous knowl-
edge.

== of wonders of the Risale-i Nur, and ﬂashes of a visible sort of the Qur’ān’s miracu-
lousness, and a source of signs of the ciphers of the Unseen. Later, we had a copy of 
the Qur’ān written that showed in gilded letters a ﬂash of its miraculousness which ap-
peared from the coinciding of the word Allāh. And I wrote eight short pieces, called The 
Eight Symbols ( Rumûzat-ı Semaniye ), which explain the subtle relationships evident 
in the coinciding of the Qur’ān’s letters, and their allusions concerning the Unseen. I 
also wrote ﬁve treatises, one about the wonders of Ghauth al-Gīlānī, three about those 
of ‘Alī, and one called I n d i c a t i o n s   o f   t h e   Q u r ’ ā n  ( İ ş â r â t - ı   K u r ’ a n i y e  ), which by means

say, that important truth was perceived and written in summary fashion in the writing of 
T h e   M i r a c l e s   o f   M u ḥ a m m a d , but unfortunately the author saw and described only a tiny 
part of it; he continued without further pursuing it.

Thus, these four groups bowed before the Qur’an in perfect wonder and 
veneration, becoming its students. At no time could any of them attempt to 
contest it.

I f   i t   i s   a s k e d :  How do we know that no one could dispute or contest it?
T h e   A n s w e r :  If it had been possible to dispute it, for sure someone would 
have attempted it. For their religion, their possessions, their lives, and their 
families  had  been  put  into  peril.  If  they  had  disputed  it,  they  would  have 
been saved. If it had been possible, they were bound to contest it. And if 
they had done so, since those who wished to do this, the unbelievers and 
dissemblers were many, and truly many, they were sure to have supported 
such a contest and would have advertised it widely. Just as they spread eve-
rything that was against Islam. And if someone had disputed the Qur’an and 
they had made it known to everyone, it would certainly have been recorded 
in the books of history in glittering terms. But all the histories and books are 
in evidence; apart from a few passages about Musaylima the Liar, there is 
nothing in any of them. Whereas for twenty-three years the All-Wise Qur’an 
continuously taunted and challenged them in a way that would increase their 
obduracy. It in effect said:

“ Let someone unlettered like Muhammad the Trustworthy compose the 
like  of  the  Qur’an.  You  won’t  be  able  to,  so  come  on,  not  an  unlettered 
person, let someone very learned and literary do it. You won’t be able to do 
that either, so rather than a single person, gather together all your scholars 
and men of eloquence, and let them assist one another, and the false gods on 
which you rely can also lend a hand. You won’t be able to do this either, so 
use the literary works of the past, and even call on those of the future to help 
you, and then compose the like of the Qur’an. And if you can’t do this, don’t 
compose all the Qur’an, but only ten Suras. You won’t be able to manage 
ten which are truly like the Qur’an’s Suras, so put it together out of stories 
and  ﬁctitious  tales;  just  produce  something  similar  to  the  word-order  and 
eloquence. And don’t write a long Sura, just a short one. But if you can’t do 
this, your religion, lives, property, and families will all be in danger, both in 
this world and in the next! ”

With  these  eight  alternatives,  the  Wise  Qur’an  has  challenged  and 
silenced men and jinn, not for twenty-three years, but for one thousand three 
hundred. Nonetheless, in those early times, those unbelievers did not have 
recourse to the easiest way, dispute or contest, but chose the most difﬁcult 
way, that of war, putting their lives, possessions, and families into danger. 
That means, it was not possible to dispute it.

Wouldn’t any intelligent person, particularly the people of Arabia at that 
time – and the Quraysh, who were very clever – have ensured that one of 
their literary men composed a Sura similar to one of the Qur’an’s and so be 
saved from its attacks; would they have abandoned the short and easy way, 
cast all they possessed into peril, and travelled the way most fraught with 
difﬁculties?

In Short: As the famous Jahiz put it: “ Dispute with words was not pos-

sible, so they were compelled to ﬁght with the sword. ”

I f  i t  i s  a s k e d :  Some learned scholars have said that not one of the Qur’an’s 
Suras, but not a single of its verses can be disputed, nor even a single sen-
tence or a word, nor have they been disputed. But this appears to be exag-
gerated and unacceptable to reason, for many human words resemble those 
of the Qur’an. Why do they say this?

T h e   A n s w e r :  There are two schools of thought concerning the Qur’an’s 

miraculousness and inimitability. 

The prevailing and preferred school states that the subtle qualities of elo-

quence and meaning in the Qur’an are beyond human power.

The second and less preferred school states that it is within human ability 
to dispute one of the Qur’an’s Suras, but Almighty Allah has prevented this 
as a miracle of Muhammad ( UWBP ). Like a man may rise to his feet, but 
if a prophet tells him that he cannot and he is unable to, then it is a miracle. 
This opinion is called the Sarfa School. That is, Almighty Allah prevented 
men  and  jinn  from  successfully  disputing  a  single  of  the  Qur’an’s  Suras. 
According to this school, scholars who state that a single of its words can-
not  be  disputed,  are  correct.  Because  since  on  account  of  its  miraculous-
ness Almighty Allah prevented them, they could not so much as open their 
mouths  to  dispute  it.  And  even  if  they  had  done  so,  they  could  not  have 
uttered a word.

However, according to the ﬁrst-mentioned prevalent and preferred school 
of  thought,  that  statement  of  scholars  includes  the  following  subtlety:  the 
All-Wise  Qur’an’s  phrases  and  words  look  to  one  another.  It  sometimes 
happens that a single word looks to ten places; in it are ten relationships and 
ten ﬁne points of eloquence. We have pointed out examples of some of these 
in the commentary called I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z  ( Signs of Miraculousness ), in the 
phrases of Sura al-Fatiha and those of, 

( 2:1-2 )  (  & % $   #  *  !

For example, take a highly decorated palace; to situate in relation to all 
the decorations a stone which is like the central point of many varied deco-
rations, is dependent on knowing the entire wall together with all its deco-
rations. And to situate the pupil of the eye in a human head is dependent 
on knowing its relations with the whole body and all the body’s wondrous 
functions, together with the eye’s position in the face of those duties. In just 
the same way, the most advanced of the people of reality have demonstrated 
numerous relationships between the Qur’an’s words and their aspects and 
connections, and other verses and phrases. Scholars of the Huruﬁ School in 
particular have gone further, explaining and demonstrating to their followers 
a page of hidden meanings in a single of the Qur’an’s letters.

Furthermore, since it is the speech of the Creator of all things, each of its 
words may be like a heart or seed; that is, a heart contained in an immaterial 
body formed of mysteries, or the seed of an immaterial tree.

Thus, words like those of the Qur’an, and even phrases or verses, may 
occur in man’s speech, but an all-encompassing knowledge is necessary to 
situate them exactly as they are in the Qur’an, taking into account the many 
relationships.

The six aspects of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition are brilliant and 
luminous; neither doubt nor misgiving can penetrate it. For its back leans on 
Allah’s Throne; there is the light of revelation in that aspect. Before it and its 
goal is the happiness of this world and the next; it has laid its hand on post-
eternity and the hereafter, and contains the light of happiness and Paradise. 
Above it shines the seal of miraculousness. Beneath it lie the pillars of proof 
and evidence. Its inner face is pure guidance, while its right causes the mind 
to afﬁrm it with phrases like » º Providing spiritual sustenance to 
hearts, its left causes the conscience to testify to Allah’s blessings. So from 
what  side,  what  corner,  can  the  thieves  of  doubt  and  misgiving  enter  the 
Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition?

Yes,  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition  encompasses  all  the  points 
of agreement found in the books of the prophets, the saints, and those who 
afﬁrm divine unity, whose centuries, ways, and temperaments were all dif-
ferent; that is, those who sought the truth through either the intellect or the 
heart mentioned in their books the All-Wise Qur’an’s concise decrees and 
principles, in such a way as to conﬁrm them. Thus, they are like the roots of 
the heavenly tree of the Qur’an. 

The All-Wise Qur’an is also founded on revelation and is revelation. For 
the Glorious One who revealed it, demonstrated and proved it was revela-
tion  through  the  miracles  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP ).  And  the  Qur’an  too, 
which reveals, shows through the miraculousness upon it that it comes from 
the  Divine  Throne.  Then  the  alarm  of  the  Most  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) to whom it was revealed, when it was ﬁrst 
revealed  and  his  unconscious  state  during  its  revelation  and  his  sincerity 

ٰ
NINETEENTH LETTER – EIGHTEENTH SIGN

and veneration towards the Qur’an, which were greater than everyone’s, all 
demonstrate that it was revelation coming from pre-eternity; it was his guest.
Moreover, the Qur’an is self-evidently pure guidance, for its opposite is 
the misguidance of unbelief. It is also of necessity the source of the lights 
of belief, and the reverse of this is of course, darkness. We have proved this 
decisively in many of the Wo r d s .

Furthermore, the Qur’an is of a certainty the assembly of truths; illusion 
and  superstition  cannot  intrude  on  it.  The  elevated  perfections  which  the 
world of Islam, to which it gave form, and the Shari‘a, which it put forward, 
display testify and prove that it is pure truth and contains no contradictions. 
Its discussions concerning the World of the Unseen testify to this too, like 
those concerning the Manifest World.

Without doubt, the Qur’an also leads to the happiness of this world and 
the next, and urges man to it. If anyone doubts this, let him read the Qur’an 
once and heed what it says. Moreover, the fruits the Qur’an produces are 
both perfect and living. In which case, the roots of the tree of the Qur’an are 
founded on reality and are living. For the life of the fruit points to the life of 
the tree. See, how many perfect, living, luminous fruits it has produced each 
century, such as the saints and puriﬁed scholars!

Also, with a conviction arising from innumerable various signs, it may 
be said the Qur’an is accepted and sought after by both men, and jinn, and 
angels, for when it is recited, they gather around, drawn to it like moths.

And  together  with  being  revelation,  the  Qur’an  has  been  strengthened 
and fortiﬁed with rational proofs; the unanimity of the wise and intelligent 
testiﬁes to this. The great scholars of theology, and the geniuses of philoso-
phy like Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd unanimously demonstrated the Qur’anic 
principles, in accordance with their own methods and proofs.

The  Qur’an  is  also  afﬁrmed  by  all  sound  natures.  So  long  as  it  is  not 
corrupted  in  any  way,  human  nature  conﬁrms  it.  For  an  easy  conscience 
and peace of mind are to be found through its lights. That is to say, unspoilt 
human nature afﬁrms it through the testimony of a tranquil conscience, and 
says to the Qur’an through the tongue of disposition: “ Our natures cannot be 
perfected without you! ” We have proved this truth in many places.

The Qur’an is also observedly and self-evidently an eternal and perpetual 
miracle; it always displays its miraculousness. It never dies away like other 
miracles; its time never comes to an end; it is everlasting.

Furthermore,  there  is  such  breadth  in  the  Qur’an’s  guidance  that  the 
Angel Gabriel and a young child may listen to its same lesson side by side, 

236

and both receive their share. And a brilliant philosopher like Ibn Sina may 
study the same of its lessons side by side with an ordinary reciter, and they 
both will receive their instruction. It may even happen that due to the strength 
and purity of his belief, the common man may beneﬁt more than Ibn Sina.

Also, there is in the Qur’an an eye that sees and encompasses the whole 
universe, and holds it before it like the pages of a book, describing its levels 
and worlds. Like a watchmaker turns, opens, shows, and describes his clock, 
the Qur’an does the same with the universe, as though it were holding it in its 
hand. The Qur’an of Mighty Stature is thus; it declares: á à ß Þ Ý Ü 
and proclaims the divine unity.

NINETEENTH SIGN

It has been proved in the previous Signs most decisively and indubita-
bly that the Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 
was Allah Almighty’s Messenger. His messengership being thus established 
through  thousands  of  certain  evidences,  Muhammad  the  Arabian  ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) was the most brilliant and conclusive proof 
of divine unity and eternal happiness. In this Sign, we shall offer a concise 
and summary deﬁnition of that shining evidence, that articulate proof. For 
since  he  is  the  proof  and  his  conclusion  is  knowledge  of  Allah,  we  must 
surely recognize the proof and learn the manner of his evidence. With an 
extremely brief summary, therefore, we shall describe in what ways he is a 
proof of it and its correctness. It is as follows:

Like  all  the  beings  in  the  universe,  Allah’s  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) pointed through his own self to the Creator 
of the universe’s existence and unity; and he proclaimed with his tongue that 
evidence of his self, together with the evidence offered by all beings. Since 
he himself was the evidence, we shall point in ﬁfteen Principles to his proof 
and integrity, his truthfulness and veracity.

First Principle

F i r s t   P r i n c i p l e :   This  proof,  who  indicated  the  universe’s  Maker  with 
both  his  self,  and  his  tongue,  and  his  conduct,  and  his  speech,  was  both 

NINETEENTH LETTER – NINETEENTH SIGN

237

veriﬁed by the reality of the universe, and was veracious. For the evidence 
to  divine  unity  made  by  all  beings  is  surely  conﬁrmation  of  the  one  who 
proclaimed that unity. That is to say, the cause he proclaimed is veriﬁed by 
the whole universe. Also, since the perfection of divine unity and absolute 
good of eternal happiness he expounded are in agreement and conformity 
with the beauty and perfection of all the truths of the world, he was certainly 
veracious in his cause. That is to say, the Noble Messenger ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ) was an articulate proof of divine unity and eternal 
happiness who was both veracious and veriﬁed.

Second Principle

S e c o n d   P r i n c i p l e :   Also,  since  that  veracious  and  veriﬁed  proof  per-
formed thousands of miracles greater than all the previous prophets, came 
with a Shari‘a that will never be abrogated, and his call was to all men and 
jinn, he was surely the chief of the prophets, and therefore gathered together 
in himself the essence and unanimity of all their miracles. That means the 
strength of the prophet’s consensus and the testimony of their miracles forms 
a support for his truthfulness and veracity. He was also the master and leader 
of all the saints and puriﬁed scholars, who attained to perfection through his 
training and guidance and the light of his Shari‘a. In which case, gathered 
together in him were the mystery of their wonders, their unanimous afﬁrma-
tion, and the strength of their veriﬁcations. For they travelled the way their 
master  opened  up  and  left  open,  and  they  found  the  truth.  In  which  case, 
all  their  wonderworking  and  veriﬁcations  and  consensus  forms  a  support 
for their sacred master’s truthfulness and veracity. Also, as was seen in the 
previous Signs, this proof of divine unity was equipped with such certain, 
evident, and deﬁnite miracles and wondrous  i r h a s a t , and his prophethood 
was proved by such irrefutable evidences that their afﬁrmation could not be 
disputed, even if the whole universe were to unite against him.

Third Principle

T h i r d   P r i n c i p l e :  And in that herald of divine unity and giver of the tid-
ings of eternal happiness, who was himself a clear miracle, were such ele-
vated moral qualities, and in the duties of his messengership such sublime 
attributes, and in the Shari‘a he propagated such high virtues, that even his 
most bitter enemy had to conﬁrm them, being unable to deny them. Since 
the highest and best moral qualities, the most elevated and perfect attributes, 
and  the  most  precious  and  acceptable  virtues  were  present  in  his  self,  his 
duties, and his religion, for sure, that person was the exemplar, model, per-
soniﬁcation, and master of the perfections and elevated moral qualities in 
beings. In which case, those perfections in his self, his duty, and his religion 

238

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

form a support for his veracity and truthfulness so powerful that it can in no 
way be shaken.

Fourth Principle

F o u r t h   P r i n c i p l e :  And that herald of divine unity and happiness, who 
was the source of perfections and teacher of elevated virtues, did not speak 
of himself; he was made to speak. Yes, he was made to speak by the Crea-
tor  of  the  universe.  He  received  instruction  from  his  Pre-Eternal  Master, 
then  he  taught.  For  the  universe’s  Creator  showed  through  the  thousands 
of proofs of his prophethood, in part described in the above Signs, through 
all  those  miracles  He  created  through  his  hand,  that  he  was  not  speaking 
on  his  own  account,  but  conveying  His  speech.  Furthermore,  the  Qur’an 
that came to him shows through its forty aspects of miraculousness, outer 
and  inner,  that  he  was  Almighty  Allah’s  interpreter.  Also,  through  all  his 
sincerity,  fear  of  Allah,  seriousness,  reliability,  and  all  his  other  qualities 
and conduct, he showed that he was not speaking his own ideas in his own 
name, but was speaking in the name of his Creator. In addition, all those 
who  penetrate  to  reality  who  heed  him  have  afﬁrmed  him  with  the  truths 
they have investigated and laid open; they have believed with knowledge of 
certainty ( i l m e l y a k î n  ) that he was not speaking on his own behalf, but that 
the Creator of the universe was causing him to speak and teaching, teaching 
by means of him. In which case, his veracity and truthfulness are supported 
by the consensus of these four powerful principles.

Fifth Principle

F i f t h   P r i n c i p l e :   And  that  Interpreter  of  Pre-Eternal  Speech  saw  spirit 
beings,  conversed  with  angels,  and  offered  guidance  to  men  and  jinn.  He 
received  knowledge  surpassing  the  world  of  men  and  jinn,  and  even  the 
worlds of spirits and the angels; he had access to, and relationships with, the 
realms  that  lie  beyond  theirs.  The  miracles  mentioned  previously  and  the 
story of his life, which have the authenticity of consensus, all prove this fact. 
In which case, unlike soothsayers and others who give news of the Unseen, 
no jinn, no spirit being, no angel, and apart from Gabriel, not even the high-
est angels in attendance on Allah Almighty, could interfere in the tidings he 
gave. And on some occasions, he even left Gabriel, his companion, behind.
S i x t h   P r i n c i p l e :  And that person, the lord of the angels, jinn, and men, 
was the most illumined and perfect fruit of the tree of the universe, and the 
personiﬁcation  of  divine  mercy,  and  the  exemplar  of  dominical  love,  and 
the most luminous proof of the Truth, and the most radiant lamp of reality, 
and the key to the talisman of the universe, and the solver of the riddle of 
creation, and the expounder of the wisdom of the world, and the herald of 
divine sovereignty, and the describer of the beauties of dominical art, and in 

Sixth Principle

NINETEENTH LETTER – NINETEENTH SIGN

239

regard to the comprehensiveness of his disposition, he was the most com-
plete example of the perfections of beings. In which case, these attributes of 
his and his spiritual personality indicate, indeed, show that this being was 
the ultimate cause of the universe’s existence; that is to say, the universe’s 
Creator looked to this being and created the universe. It may be said that if 
He had not created him, He would not have created the universe. Yes, the 
truths of the Qur’an and lights of belief he brought to men and jinn, and the 
elevated virtues and exalted perfections apparent in his being are a decisive 
witness to this fact.

Seventh Principle

S e v e n t h   P r i n c i p l e :  And that proof of the Truth and lamp of reality dem-
onstrated a religion and Shari‘a that comprise principles ensuring the hap-
piness of this world and the next. Moreover, besides being comprehensive, 
they explain with complete correctness the universe’s truths and functions, 
and the Creator of the universe’s names and attributes. Thus, Islam and the 
Shari‘a  are  so  comprehensive  and  perfect,  and  describe  the  universe  and 
Himself in such a way, that anyone who studies them carefully is bound to 
understand that his religion is a declaration, a manifesto, describing both the 
One who made this beautiful universe, and the universe itself. In the same 
way that a palace’s builder writes an instruction sheet suitable to the palace 
so that he may describe himself through its features, the religion and Shari‘a 
of Muhammad ( UWBP ) demonstrate through their clear elevatedness, com-
prehensiveness,  and  truth  that  his  religion  proceeded  from  the  pen  of  the 
One who creates and regulates the universe. Whoever ordered the universe 
so well is the One who ordered this religion equally well. Yes, the perfect 
order of the one requires the perfect order of the other.

Eighth Principle

E i g h t h   P r i n c i p l e :  Thus qualiﬁed by the above-mentioned attributes and 
sustained by totally unshakeable, powerful supports, Muhammad the Ara-
bian ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) proclaimed his message over the 
heads of men and jinn in the name of the World of the Unseen, turned to the 
Manifest World; he addressed the peoples and nations waiting beyond the 
centuries of the future; he called out to all jinn and men; he made all places 
and all times hear. Yes, we too hear!

Ninth Principle

N i n t h   P r i n c i p l e :  His address is so elevated and powerful that all the cen-

turies heed it. Yes, all the centuries hear the echo of his voice.

Tenth Principle

T e n t h   P r i n c i p l e :  It is apparent from that person’s ( UWBP ) manner that 
he saw, and spoke accordingly. For at times of greatest peril, he spoke unhes-
itatingly, fearlessly, with utter steadfastness. On occasion he challenged the 
whole world on his own.

Eleventh Principle

240

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

E l e v e n t h   P r i n c i p l e :  With all his strength he made so powerful a call and 
summons that he caused half the earth and a ﬁfth of mankind to respond to 
his voice, declaring: “ Yes, we have heard and we obey! ”

Twelfth Principle

T w e l f t h  P r i n c i p l e :  He called with such seriousness and instructed so fun-
damentally that he inscribed his principles on the face of the centuries and 
on the very stones of all corners of the world; he engraved them on the face 
of time.

Thirteenth Principle

T h i r t e e n t h   P r i n c i p l e :  He proclaimed the soundness of the injunctions he 
conveyed with such conﬁdence and sureness, that should the whole world 
have gathered, they could not have made him revoke or abjure a single of 
those precepts. Witness to this are all his life and his illustrious biography.

Fourteenth Principle

F o u r t e e n t h   P r i n c i p l e :   He  called  and  summoned  with  such  conﬁdence 
and trust that he became obliged to no one and no difﬁculty upset him; with 
complete sincerity and honesty, he accepted before anyone the precepts he 
had brought, and acted accordingly, and proclaimed them. Witness to this 
were his famous asceticism and independence and his never stooping to the 
ephemeral glitter of this world, which were well-known by everyone, friend 
and foe.

Fifteenth Principle

F i f t e e n t h   P r i n c i p l e :   His  obedience  to  the  religion  he  brought,  and  his 
worship of his Maker, and his abstaining from whatever was forbidden, all 
of which he performed to a greater degree than everyone else, demonstrate 
conclusively that he was the envoy and herald of the Monarch of Pre-Eter-
nity and Post-Eternity; he was the most sincere servant of the One who is 
worshipped by right, and the interpreter of His pre-eternal word.

The  conclusion  of  these  ﬁfteen  Principles  is  this:  the  one  qualiﬁed  by 
the above-mentioned attributes proclaimed divine unity with all his strength 
repeatedly and constantly throughout his life, saying:

A Divine Gift
And a Mark of Dominical Favour

In the hope of complying with the meaning of the verse, 

( 93:11 ) s r q p I shall mention a mark of Almighty Allah’s favour 
and mercy that was apparent in the writing of this treatise, so that those who 
read it may understand its importance.

I had no intention of writing this treatise, for the Nineteenth and Thirty-
First  Wo r d s   about  the  messengership  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP )  had  been 
written.  Then  suddenly  I  felt  a  compelling  impulse  to  write  it.  Also  my 
power  of  memory  had  been  extinguished  due  to  the  calamities  I  had  suf-
fered. Moreover, in accordance with my way, I had not taken the path of nar-
rative, that is, “ he said that, ” “ it was said that, ” in the works I had written. 
Furthermore, I had no books of Hadith or the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) biography 
available to me. Nevertheless, saying: “ I place my trust in Allah, ” I began. 
It was extremely successful and my memory assisted me in a way that sur-
passed even that of the Old Said. Thirty to forty pages were written at speed 
every two or three hours. Once ﬁfteen pages were written in a single hour. It 
was mostly narrated from such books as Bukhari, Muslim, Bayhaqi, Tirmi-
dhi, a l - S h i f a ’  a l - S h a r i f , Abu Nu‘aym, and Tabari. My heart was trembling, 
because if there had been any error in relating them – since they are Hadiths 
– it would have been a sin. But it was clear that divine favour was with us 
and there was need for the treatise. Allah willing, what has been written is 
sound. If perhaps there are any errors in the wording of some of the Hadiths 
or in the names of the narrators, I request that my brothers will look on them 
tolerantly and correct them.

S a i d   N u r s i
Ustad Said Nursi, our master, dictated and we wrote the ﬁrst draft. He 
had no books with him, nor did he refer to any. He would suddenly dictate 
at great speed, and we wrote. We would write thirty, forty, and sometimes 
more, pages in two or three hours. We formed the conviction that this ease 
was itself a wonder proceeding from the miracles of the Prophet Muhammad 
( UWBP ).

First Droplet

First Droplet

There are three great and universal things which make known to us our 
Sustainer.  One  is  the  Book  of  the  Universe,  a  jot  of  whose  testimony  we 
have heard from the thirteen Flashes together with the Thirteenth Lesson of 
the Arabic R i s a l e - i   N u r . 1 Another is the Seal of the Prophets ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ), the supreme sign of the book of the universe. And 
the other is the Qur’an of Mighty Stature. Now, we must become acquainted 
with the Seal of the Prophets ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), who is 
the second, articulate, proof, and must listen to him.

Yes, behold the collective personality of this proof! The face of the earth 
is  his  mosque,  Mecca,  his  m i h r a b ,  and  Medina,  his  pulpit.  Our  Prophet 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), this clear proof, is the leader of all 
believers, preacher to all mankind, the chief of all the prophets, the lord of 
all the saints, and the leader of a circle for the remembrance of Allah com-
prising  the  prophets  and  saints.  He  is  a  luminous  tree  whose  living  roots 
are all the prophets, and fresh fruits are all the saints; whose claims all the 
prophets relying on their miracles and all the saints relying on their won-

All on right and left, that is, those luminous reciters of Allah’s names lined 
up in the past and the future, repeat the same words, and through their con-
sensus as though declare: “ You speak the truth and what you say is right! ” 
What false idea has the power to intrude on a claim that is thus afﬁrmed and 
corroborated by thousands?

Second Droplet

Second Droplet

Just as that luminous proof of divine unity is afﬁrmed by the unanimity 
and  consensus  of  those  two  wings,  so  do  hundreds  of  indications  in  such 
revealed scriptures as the Torah and Bible,1 all conﬁrm and corroborate him 
as do the thousands of signs that appeared before the beginning of his mis-
sion, and the well-known news given by the voices from the Unseen and the 
unanimous  testimony  of  the  soothsayers,  the  indications  of  the  thousands 
of his miracles like the Splitting of the Moon, and the justice of Shari‘a. So 
too, his person and his laudable morals, which were at the summit of perfec-
tion; and in his duties, his complete conﬁdence and elevated qualities, which 
were of the highest excellence, and his extraordinary fear of Allah, worship, 
seriousness, and fortitude, which demonstrated the strength of his belief, and 
his total certainty and his complete steadfastness, – these all show as clearly 
as the sun how utterly faithful he was to his cause.

Third Droplet

Third Droplet

If you wish, come! Let us go to Arabian Peninsula, to the Era of Bliss! In 
our imaginations, we shall see him at his duties and visit him. Look! We see 
a person distinguished by his ﬁne character and beautiful form. In his hand 
is a miraculous book and on his tongue, a truthful address; he is delivering a 
pre-eternal sermon to all mankind, indeed, to man, jinn, and the angels, and 
to all beings. He solves and expounds the obscure riddle of the world’s crea-
tion; he discovers and solves the abstruse talisman which is the mystery of 
the universe; and he provides convincing and satisfying answers to the three 
awesomely difﬁcult questions that are asked of all beings and have always 
bewildered and occupied minds: “ Where do you come from? What are you 
doing here? Where are you going? ”

See!  He  spreads  such  a  light  of  truth  that  if  you  look  at  the  universe 
as being outside the luminous sphere of his truth and guidance, you see it

to be a place of general mourning, and beings strangers to one another and 
hostile,  and  inanimate  beings  to  be  like  ghastly  corpses  and  living  crea-
tures like orphans weeping at the blows of death and separation. Now look! 
Through  the  light  he  spreads,  that  place  of  universal  mourning  has  been 
transformed into a place where Allah’s names and praises are recited in joy 
and ecstasy. The foreign, hostile beings have become friends and brothers. 
While the dumb, dead inanimate creatures all become familiar ofﬁcials and 
docile servants. And the weeping, complaining orphans are seen to be either 
reciting Allah’s names and praises or offering thanks at being released from 
their duties.

Fifth Droplet

Also, through his light, the motion and movement of the universe, and 
its variations, changes and transformations, cease being meaningless, futile, 
and the playthings of chance and rise to the level of being dominical mis-
sives, pages inscribed with the signs of creation, and mirrors to the divine 
names,  while  the  world  itself  becomes  a  book  of  the  Eternally  Besought 
One’s  wisdom.  Man’s  boundless  weakness  and  impotence,  poverty  and 
need, make him inferior to all other animals and his intelligence, an instru-
ment  of  grief,  sorrow,  and  sadness,  makes  him  more  wretched,  yet  when 
he is illumined with that light, he rises above all animals and all creatures. 
Through entreaty, his illuminated impotence, poverty, and intelligence make 
him  a  petted  monarch;  due  to  his  complaints,  he  becomes  a  spoiled  vice-
gerent of the earth. That is to say, if it were not for that Being’s light, the 
universe and man, and all things, would be nothing. Yes, certainly such a 
person is necessary in such a wondrous universe; otherwise the universe and 
ﬁrmament would not be in existence.

Sixth Droplet

Sixth Droplet

That  person  ( UWBP )  announces  and  brings  the  good  news  of  eternal 
happiness; he is the discoverer and proclaimer of an inﬁnite mercy, the her-
ald and observer of the beauties of the sovereignty of dominicality, and the 
discloser and displayer of the treasures of the divine names. If you regard 
him in that way, that is in regard to his being a worshipful servant of Allah, 
you will see him to be the model of love, the exemplar of mercy, the glory 
of mankind, and the most luminous fruit of the tree of creation. While if you 
look in this way, that is, in regard to his messengership, you see him to be the 
proof of Allah, the lamp of truth, the sun of guidance, and the means to hap-
piness. And look! His light has lit up east and west like dazzling lightning!

toms and habits of the various wild, unyielding peoples of that broad penin-
sula to which they were fanatically attached, and he decked them out with all 
the ﬁnest virtues, and made them teachers of all the world and masters of the 
civilized nations. See, it was not just an outward domination; he conquered 
and subjugated their minds, spirits, hearts, and souls. He became the beloved 
of hearts, the teacher of minds, the trainer of souls, the ruler of spirits.

You know that a small habit like cigarette smoking among a small nation 
can be eradicated permanently only by a powerful ruler with great effort. 
But look! This person ( UWBP ) eliminated numerous ingrained habits from 
intractable, fanatical large nations with slight outward power and little effort 
in a short period of time, and in their place he so established exalted quali-
ties that they became as ﬁrm as if they had mingled with their very blood. 
He achieved very many extraordinary feats like this. Thus, we present the 
Arabian Peninsula as a challenge to those who refuse to see the testimony 
of the blessed age of the Prophet ( UWBP ). Let them each take a hundred 
philosophers, go there, and strive for a hundred years: would they be able to 
carry out in that time one hundredth of what he achieved in a year?

Also, you know that an insigniﬁcant man of small standing among a small 
community in a disputed matter of small importance cannot tell a small but 
shameful lie brazenfaced and fearlessly without displaying anxiety or dis-
quiet enough to inform the enemies at his side of his deception. Now look 
at  that  person  ( UWBP );  although  he  undertook  a  tremendous  task  which 
required an ofﬁcial of great authority and great standing and a situation of 
great security, can any contradiction at all be found in the words he uttered 
among a community of great size in the face of great hostility concerning a 
great cause and matters of great signiﬁcance, with great ease and freedom, 
without  fear,  hesitation,  difﬁdence,  or  anxiety,  with  pure  sincerity,  great 
seriousness, and in an intense, elevated manner that angered his enemies?

Is it at all possible that any trickery should have been involved? Allah for-
bid!  ( 53:4 ) 4 3 2 1 0 The truth does not deceive, and one who per-
ceives the truth is not deceived. His way which is truth is free of deception. 
How could a fancy appear to be truth to one who sees the truth, and deceive 
him?

Now, look! What curiosity-arousing, attractive, necessary, and awesome 

truths he shows and matters he proves.

You know that what impels man most is curiosity. Even, if you were to 
be told: “Hand over half of your life and property, and someone will come 
from the moon and Jupiter and tell you all about them. He will also tell 
you the truth about your future and what will happen to you.” You would 
be sure to give them if you have any curiosity at all. Whereas that person 
(UWBP) tells of such a Monarch that in His realm, the moon ﬂies round a 
moth like a ﬂy, and the moth, the earth, ﬂutters round a lamp, and the lamp, 
the sun, is merely one lamp among thousands in one of his guesthouses out 
of thousands. 

Also, he speaks truly of a world so wondrous and a revolution so tremen-
dous that if thousands of earths were to become bombs and explode, it would 
not be all that strange. Look! Listen to some of the suras he is reciting: 

 ( 101:1 ) ,  ( 82:1 ) # " !   ( 81:1 ) # " ! 
Also, he speaks truly of a future in comparison with which the future in 
this world is a tiny mirage. And he describes most earnestly such happiness 
that it resembles an eternal sun in comparison with the ﬂeeting lightning-
ﬂash of happiness in this world.

For  sure,  such  wonders  await  us  behind  the  outer  veil  of  the  universe, 
which is thus strange and perplexing. So a Being thus wonderful and extraor-
dinary, a displayer of marvels, is necessary to tell of its wonders. It is appar-
ent from that person’s conduct that he has seen them, and sees them, and 
says that he has seen them. He instructs us most soundly concerning what 
the Allah of the heavens and the earth, Who nurtures us with His bounties, 
wants and desires of us. Everyone, therefore, should leave everything and 
hasten to this person and heed the numerous other necessary and curiosity-
arousing truths like these that he teaches. So how is it that most people are

deaf and blind, and mad even, that they do not see this truth, nor listen to it 
or understand it?

Just as this person (UWBP) is an articulate proof and evidence as true as 
the unity of the Creator of beings; so he is a decisive proof and clear evi-
dence for the resurrection of the dead and eternal happiness. Indeed, with 
his guidance he is the reason for eternal happiness coming about and is the 
means of attaining it; so too, through his prayers and supplications, he is the 
cause of its existence and the reason for its creation. Because of its relevance 
we repeat this mystery here, which is mentioned in the Tenth Word.

See! This Being ( UWBP ) prays with a prayer so supreme it is as if the 
Arabian Peninsula and the earth too perform the prayers through his majes-
tic prayer, and offer entreaties. See, he entreats in a congregation so vast it is 
as if all the luminous, perfected members of mankind from the time of Adam 
till our age and until the end of time, are following him and saying “ Amen ” 
to his supplications. And see! He is beseeching for a need so universal that 
not only the dwellers of the earth, but those of the heavens, and all beings, 
join in his prayer, declaring: “ Yes! O our Sustainer! Grant it to us! We too 
want it! ” He supplicates with such want, so sorrowfully, in such a loving, 
yearning, and beseeching fashion 1 that he brings the whole cosmos to tears, 
making them join in his prayer.

See!  The  purpose  and  aim  of  his  prayer  is  such  that  it  raises  man  and 
the  world,  and  all  creatures,  from  the  lowest  of  the  low,  from  inferiority, 
worthlessness, and uselessness to the highest of the high; that is, to having 
value, permanence, and exalted duties. See! He seeks and pleads for help 
and mercy in a manner so elevated and sweet, it is as if he makes all beings 
and the heavens and the earth hear, and bringing them to ecstasy, to exclaim: 
“ Amen, O our Allah! Amen! ” And see! He seeks his needs from One so 
Powerful, Hearing, and Muniﬁcent, One so Knowing, Seeing, and Compas-
sionate, that He sees and hears the most secret need of the most obscure liv-
ing being and its entreaties, accepts them, and has mercy on it. For He gives 
what is asked for, if only through the tongue of disposition. And He gives 
it in so Wise, Seeing, and Compassionate a form that it leaves no doubt that 
His nurturing and regulation is particular to Him, the All-Hearing and All-
Seeing One, the Most Generous and Most Compassionate One.

What does he want, this pride of the human race, who taking behind him 
all the eminent of mankind, stands on top of the world facing the sublime 
throne, and raising up his hands, is praying? What is he seeking, this unique 
being who is truly the glory of the cosmos? Listen! He is seeking eternal 
happiness. He is asking for eternal life, and to meet with Allah. He wants 
Paradise.  And  he  wants  all  the  sacred  divine  names,  which  display  their 
beauty and decrees in the mirrors of beings. Even if it were not for reasons 
for the fulﬁlment of those countless requests, like mercy, grace, wisdom, and 
justice, a single of that Being’s (UWBP) prayers would have been sufﬁcient 
for the construction of Paradise, the creation of which is as easy for divine 
power as the creation of the spring. Yes, just as his messengership was the 
reason for the opening of this place of examination and trial, so his worship 
and servitude of Allah were the reason of the opening of the next world.

Would  the  perfect  order  observed  in  the  universe,  which  has  caused

dominicality, permit the ugliness, the cruelty, the lack of order of its hear-
ing and responding to the least signiﬁcant, the least important desires and 
voices, and its considering unimportant the most important, the most nec-
essary wishes, and its not hearing or understanding them, and not carrying 
them  out?  Allah  forbid!  A  hundred  thousand  times,  Allah  forbid!  Such  a 
beauty would not permit such ugliness; it would not become ugly!

My imaginary friend! That is enough for now, we must return. For if we 
remain a hundred years in this age in the Arabian Peninsula, we still would 
comprehend completely only one hundredth of the marvels of that Person’s 
( UWBP ) duties and the wonders he carried out, and we would never tire of 
watching him.

Now, come! We shall look at the centuries, turning above us. See how 
each has opened like a ﬂower through the effulgence it has received from 
that Sun of Guidance! They have produced millions of enlightened fruits like 
Abu  Hanifa,  Shaﬁ‘i,  Abu  Bayazid  Bistami,  Shaikh  ‘Abd  al-Qadir  Gilani, 
Shah Naqshband, Imam Ghazali and Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi. But postpon-
ing  the  details  of  our  observations  to  another  time,  we  must  recite  some 
benedictions for that displayer of miracles and bringer of guidance, which 
mention a number of his certain miracles:

The  All-Wise  Qur’an,  the  treasury  of  miracles  and  supreme  miracle, 
proves the prophethood of Muhammad (UWBP) together with divine unity 
so decisively that it leaves no need for further proof. So here we shall set 
out its deﬁnition and indicate one or two ﬂashes of its miraculousness which 
have been the cause of criticism.

The  All-Wise  Qur’an,  which  makes  known  to  us  our  Sustainer,  is  as 
follows: it is the pre-eternal translation of the great book of the universe; 
the discloser of the treasures of the divine names concealed in the pages of 
the earth and the heavens; the key to the truths hidden beneath the lines of 
events; the treasury of the Most Merciful’s favours and of the pre-eternal 
addresses, which issue forth from the World of the Unseen beyond the veil 
of this Manifest World; the sun, foundation, and plan of the spiritual world 
of Islam, and the map of the worlds of the hereafter; the distinct expounder, 
lucid exposition, articulate proof, and clear translator of the divine essence, 
attributes, and deeds; the instructor, true wisdom, guide, and leader of the 
world  of  humanity;  it  is  both  a  book  of  wisdom  and  law,  and  a  book  of 
prayer and worship, and a book of command and summons, and a book of 
invocation and knowledge of Allah – it is book for all spiritual needs; and 
it is a sacred library offering books appropriate to the ways of all the saints 
and veracious, and the puriﬁed and the scholars, whose ways and paths are 
all different.

Consider the ﬂashes of miraculousness in its repetitions, which are imag-
ined  to  be  a  fault:  since  the  Qur’an  is  both  a  book  of  invocation,  and  of 
prayer and of summons, the repetition in it is desirable, indeed, it is essential 
and most eloquent. It is not as the faulty imagine. For the mark of invoca-
tion  is  illumination  through  repetition.  The  mark  of  prayer  is  strengthen-
ing through repetition. The mark of command and summons is conﬁrmation 
through repetition. Moreover, not everyone is capable of always reading the 
whole Qur’an, but mostly is able to read one sura. Therefore, since the most 
important purposes of the Qur’an are included in the longer suras, each is 
like a small Qur’an. That is to say, so that no one should be deprived, its 
purposes such as divine unity, the resurrection of the dead, and the story of 
Moses have been repeated. Also, like bodily needs, spiritual needs are vari-
ous. Man is in need of some things each breath; as the body needs air, so  
the spirit needs the word “ H ū  ” ( He ). Some he is in need of each hour, like 
ّ(cid:195)ا ِم ْ(cid:127)ِ(cid:92) And so on. This means the repetition of verses arises from the rep-
etition  of  need.  It  makes  the  repetition  in  order  to  point  out  the  need  and 
awaken and excite it, and to arouse desire and appetite.

Moreover, the Qur’an is a founder; it is the basis of the Clear Religion 
and the foundation of the world of Islam. It transformed human society, and 
is the answer to the repeated questions of its various classes. Repetition is 
necessary for a founder in order to establish things. It is necessary to corrob-
orate them. Conﬁrmation and repetition are necessary to strengthen them.

Furthermore,  it  speaks  of  such  mighty  matters  and  minute  truths  that 
numerous repetitions are necessary in different forms to establish them in 
the hearts of everyone. However, they are only apparently repetitions, for 
each verse has numerous meanings, numerous beneﬁts, and many aspects 
and levels. Each place a verse is found, it is mentioned for a different mean-
ing, beneﬁt, and purpose.

Also, the fact that the Qur’an is unspeciﬁc and concise in certain cosmic 
matters is a ﬂash of miraculousness, for purposes of guidance. This should 
not be a cause of criticism and is not a fault, as some atheists imagine.

I f   y o u   a s k :  “ Why does the All-Wise Qur’an not speak of beings in the 
same way as philosophy and science? Why does it leave some matters in 
concise form, and speak of others simply and superﬁcially so as to facilitate 
general understanding, and not wound people’s feelings or weary and tax the 
minds of ordinary people? ”

B y   w a y   o f   a n   a n s w e r   w e   s a y :  Philosophy has strayed from the path of 
truth,  that’s  why.  Also,  of  course  you  have  understood  from  the  previous 
Wo r d s  and what they teach that the All-Wise Qur’an speaks of the universe 
in order to make known the divine essence, attributes, and names. That is, it 
explains the meanings of the book of the universe to make known its Crea-
tor. That means it looks at beings, not for themselves but for their Creator. 
Also,  it  addresses  everyone,  while  philosophy  and  science  look  at  beings 
for themselves, and address scientists in particular. In which case, since the 
All-Wise Qur’an makes beings evidences and proofs, the evidence has to 
be superﬁcial so that it will be quickly understood generally. And since the 
Qur’an of Guidance addresses all classes of men, the ordinary people, which 
form the most numerous class, want guidance which is concise with unnec-
essary  things  beings  vague;  in  a  way  that  brings  subtle  things  close  with 
comparisons, and does not change things that in their superﬁcial view are 
obvious, into an unnecessary or even harmful form, lest it causes them to 
fall into error.

For example, it says about the sun: “ The sun is a revolving lamp or lan-
tern. ” This is because it does not speak of the sun for itself and its nature, but 
because it is a sort of mainspring of an order and centre of a system, and order 
and systems are mirrors of the Maker’s skill. It says: ´ ³ ( 36:38 )

that is, the sun revolves. Through calling to mind the orderly disposals of 
divine power in the revolutions of winter and summer, and day and night 
with the phrase, “ T h e   s u n   r e v o l v e s , ” it makes known the Maker’s tremen-
dousness. Thus, whatever the reality of this revolving, it does not affect the 
order, which is woven and observed, and which is the purpose. It also says,  
J I H ( 71:16 ) Here, by depicting with the word “ lamp ” the world 
in the form of a palace and the things within it as decorations, necessities, 
and provisions prepared for man and living beings, and the sun as a subju-
gated candleholder, it makes known the Creator’s mercy and bestowal. Now 
look and see what this foolish, prattling philosophy says:

“ The sun is a vast burning liquid mass. It causes the planets which have 
been ﬂung off from it to revolve around it. Its mass is such-and-such. It is 
this, it is that. ” Apart from a terrible dread and fearful wonder, philosophy 
imparts to the spirit no knowledge that will perfect it. It does not speak of it 
as the Qur’an does. You may understand from this the value of the matters 
of philosophy, whose inside is hollow and outside, ostentatious. So don’t be 
deceived by its glittering exterior and be disrespectful towards the miracu-
lous expositions of the Qur’an!

About the Miracle of the
Splitting of the Moon 

[ An Addendum to the Nineteenth and Thirty-First Wo r d s  ]

(cid:2)(cid:3)

 ¥ ¤ £ ¢ * ﮯ ~ } |
( 54:1-2 ) ¨ § ¦
Philosophers and their unreasoning imitators, who want to eclipse with 
their  vicious  delusions  the  Splitting  of  the  Moon,  which  is  a  miracle  of 
Muhammad  ( UWBP )  that  shines  like  the  moon,  say:  “ If  the  Splitting  of 
the Moon had occurred, it would have been known to the whole world and 
would have been related throughout the subsequent history of man. ”

T h e   A n s w e r :   Since  the  Splitting  of  the  Moon  was  demonstrated  as  an 
evidence of prophethood, and happened instantaneously at night when peo-
ple were asleep, and before a gathering who, although they witnessed such 
an evidence, denied it; and since there were obstacles hindering the sighting 
of it such as mist, clouds, and time-differences between different parts of the 
world; and since at that time science and civilization were not widespread, 
and observation of the skies was very limited, and the event itself was excep-
tional, there was, therefore, nothing to necessitate that it should have been 
seen all over the world and been recorded in the general histories. 1 For now, 
listen to ﬁve points out of many that will scatter those clouds of delusion 
concerning the Splitting of the Moon. 

First Point

First Point: The extreme stubbornness of the unbelievers there at that 
time  is  well-known  and  is  recorded  in  history.  And  yet,  when  the  All-
Wise  Qur’an  announced  this  event  to  the  whole  world  through  saying:  

1.  See, al-Nawawī, S h a r ḥ   a l - Ṣ a ḥ ī ḥ   M u s l i m , xvii, 143; Ibn Qutayba, Ta ’ w ī l   M u k h t a l i f  

a l - Ḥ a d ī t h , i, 21-5.

253

254

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

( 54:1 )  ﮯ ~  not  one  of  those  unbelievers,  who  denied  the  Qur’an, 
spoke up to give the lie to this verse; that is, not one of them denied the event 
it was announcing. If the event had not been considered a deﬁnite fact by the 
unbelievers, they would have made the verse a pretext, denied it strenuously, 
and tried to attack and nullify Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) claim to prophethood. 
However, the biographies of the Prophet ( UWBP ) and histories mentioning 
the event relate nothing to suggest that the unbelievers denied it. The only 
thing  that  history  relates  is,  as  the verse  ( 54:2 )  ¨ § ¦  points 
out,  the  unbelievers  who  saw  the  event  declared  it  to  be  magic,  and  said 
that  if  the  caravans  in  other  places  had  seen  it,  it  was  true,  otherwise  he 
had bewitched them. The caravans arriving the following morning from the 
Yemen  and  other  places  announced  that  they  had  seen  such  a  happening. 
So the unbelievers said of the Pride of All the Worlds ( UWBP ) that, Allah 
forbid, the magic of Abu Talib’s orphan had affected the heavens. 1

Second Point

Second  Point:  The  majority  of  the  most  illustrious  scholars,  like  Sa‘d 
al-din Taftazani, declared that like the Prophet ( UWBP ) had satisﬁed the 
thirst of a whole army with water ﬂowing from his ﬁngers, and the whole 
congregation had heard a dry wooden post against which he had leant while 
delivering the sermon weep on being separated from him, the Splitting of 
the  Moon  had  been  transmitted  by  numerous  authorities.  2  That  is  to  say, 
these events had been passed down from group to group forming such a vast 
congregation that a conspiracy to lie would have been impossible. Like the 
appearance  of  the  famous  Haley’s  Comet  a  thousand  years  ago  had  been 
unanimously reported, and the existence of the island of Ceylon was certain 
because of the unanimous reports concerning it, although we had not seen it.
It is therefore unreasonable to foster baseless doubts about such certain, 
witnessed matters. It is enough that they are not impossible. And as for the 
Splitting of the Moon, it is quite as possible as a mountain’s splitting with a 
volcanic eruption.

Third Point

Third  Point:  Miracles  are  for  proving  claims  to  prophethood  and  for 
convincing those who deny such claims, they are not for compelling people 
to believe. They have therefore to be shown to those who hear such claims

to an extent that will persuade them. It would be contrary to the All-Wise 
and Glorious One’s wisdom to display them all over the world or in so self-
evident  a  manner  that  everyone  would  be  compelled  to  believe.  It  would 
also  be  contrary  to  the  mystery  of  man’s  accountability.  For  this  requires 
“ opening the door to the reason without cancelling the power of choice. ” If 
the All-Wise Creator had left the moon split apart for a couple of hours so 
as to show it to the whole world as the philosophers wished, and it had been 
recorded in all the general histories of mankind, then it would have been like 
all other occurrences in the heavens and would not have been an evidence 
for Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) claim to prophethood, nor been special to it. Or 
else it would have been so self-evident a miracle that it would have annulled 
the reason’s power to choose, and compelled it to accept it; it would have 
had to assent to his prophethood. People with coal-like spirits like Abu Jahl 
would have remained on the same level as people with diamond-like spirits 
like  Abu  Bakr  the  Veracious;  the  mystery  of  man’s  accountability  would 
have been lost. It was due to this mystery that, being both instantaneous, and 
at nighttime, and at a time of sleep; and due to time differences, mist, and 
cloud and other factors concealing it, it was not shown to the whole world 
and did not pass into the histories.

Fourth Point

Fourth Point: Since this event occurred instantaneously at night while 
everyone was sleeping, of course it was not seen all over the world. Even 
if some people had seen it, they would not have believed their eyes. And if 
it had made them believe, such a signiﬁcant event would not have become 
lasting material for future histories due to isolated individual reports.

In some books it is written that after the moon split into two halves, it 
fell to earth, but veracious scholars have rejected such additions, saying that 
they were perhaps added by dissemblers with the intention of disparaging 
this evident miracle, and depreciating it. 1

Also, in England and Spain, which were then enveloped in mists of igno-
rance,  the  time  it  occurred  would  have  been  just  after  sunset,  in  America 
it would have been daytime, and in China and Japan, morning. Elsewhere 
there would have been other obstacles preventing it from being seen. Now 
consider those unreasoning objectors who say that the histories of peoples 
like the English, Chinese, Japanese, and Americans do not mention it, and 
that therefore it did not occur. A thousand curses be on the heads of those 
who toady to Europe and repeat such things.

Fifth Point Fifth  Point:  The  Splitting  of  the  Moon  happened  neither  of  its  own 
accord due to certain causes, nor as a result of chance, nor was it a natural 
event that occurred through the ordinary laws of nature. It was rather some-
thing  out  of  the  ordinary  which  the  All-Wise  Creator  of  the  sun  and  the 
moon caused to happen in order to conﬁrm His Messenger’s messengership 
and to illuminate his claim.

As required by the mysteries of guidance and human responsibility and 
the wisdom of prophethood, it was shown as a convincing proof to a number 
of people speciﬁed by dominical wisdom. The mystery of wisdom required 
that it was not shown to people in every region of the world, who had not yet 
heard of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) claim to prophethood. Numerous obstacles 
prevented them, therefore, such as mist, cloud, and time-differences, and the 
fact that in some countries the moon had not risen, and in others the sun had 
risen, while in others it was morning, and in yet others the sun had just set.

If it had been shown to all and sundry, it would have been shown as a sign 
of Muhammad ( UWBP ) and a miracle of his prophethood, in which case 
his messengership would have been so obvious that everyone would have 
been compelled to afﬁrm it. Human reason and will would have been can-
celled, and belief is attained through the faculties of reason and will. Human 
responsibility and accountability would have been nulliﬁed. If it had been 
shown merely as an occurrence in the heavens, its connection with Muham-
mad’s ( UWBP ) messengership would have been cut, and there would have 
been nothing about it that pertained to him.

To Conclude: No doubt remains concerning the possibility of the Split-
ting of the Moon; it has been proved decisively. Now we shall mention six 1 
of the many evidences pointing to its occurrence.

The concurrence of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) Companions, who were all 

men of justice, on its occurrence. 2

The agreement of all exacting commentators on the Qur’an in their expla-

nations of the verse,  ( 54:1 ) ﮯ ~
The  fact  that,  relying  on  numerous  different  chains  of  authorities  and 
lines of transmission, all the scholars of the prophetic traditions and trans-
mitters of the sound narrations narrated the event. 3

1.  That is to say, there are six proofs concerning the event in the form of a sixfold 

consensus. Unfortunately, the explanation of them is brief and they deserve more.

257

The testimony of all the saints and the veracious, those who receive inspi-

ration, and uncover the mysteries of the creation.

The conﬁrmation of learned scholars and theologians, whose ways differ 

greatly from one another.

The  fact  that  Muhammad’s  ( UWBP )  community  accepted  its  occur-

rence, which, on an established principle, never agrees upon error. 1

These six evidences prove the Splitting of the Moon as clearly as the sun.
Conclusion
Up to here this Addendum has aimed to establish the truth and to silence 
those enemies who deny it. The following sentences speak in the name of the 
truth and for the sake of belief. In the former, establishing the truth spoke; 
now the truth speaks:

The Seal of the Ofﬁce of Prophethood, who was the luminous moon of 
the heavens of messengership, proved his sainthood through his Ascension. 
It was his greatest wonder and the supreme miracle of sainthood, achieved 
through his worship, which was so elevated as to make him Allah’s beloved. 
That is to say, by travelling with his earthly body through the heavens, his 
superiority and his being Allah’s beloved were demonstrated to the dwell-
ers of the heavens and inhabitants of the lofty worlds. So too, through the 
moon, which is bound to the earth and suspended in the heavens, being split 
into two halves at the sign of an earth dweller, it displayed a miracle to the 
other inhabitants of the earth, which indicated the former’s messengership. 
Thus, the person of Muhammad ( UWBP ) ﬂew to the peak of perfections 
on the two luminous wings of messengership and sainthood – like the two 
luminous unfolded wings of the moon; he ascended to the distance of two 
bow-lengths; he became the cause of pride of the dwellers of both the heav-
ens and the earth.

t o   T h e   M i r a c l e s   o f   M u h a m m a d   (   U W B P   )  

[ This is about the Messengership of Muhammad ( UWBP ) and is the 
answer,  in  concise  index-like  form,  to  the ﬁrst  of  the  three  questions 
and difﬁculties in the Third Principle of the Thirty-First Word, about 
his Ascension. ]

Q u e s t i o n :  Why is this mighty Ascension special to Muhammad the Ara-

bian ( Upon whom be blessings and peace )?

T h e   A n s w e r   t o   y o u r   ﬁ r s t   d i f ﬁ c u l t y :   It  has  been  analysed  in  detail  in 
the  ﬁrst  thirty  Wo r d s ,  so  here  we  shall  set  out  as  follows  a  concise  list 
brieﬂy alluding to the perfections of Muhammad ( UWBP ), to the signs of 
his prophethood, and to the fact that he was the most worthy to make the 
Ascension.

Firstly: Despite numerous corruptions in the texts of such Holy Scrip-
tures  as  the  Torah,  Gospels,  and  Psalms,  in  recent  times  even,  an  exact-
ing  scholar  like  Husain  Jisri  found  one  hundred  and  fourteen  allusions  to 
Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) prophethood; these good tidings he set forth in his 
R i s a l e - i   H a m i d i y e . 1

Secondly: It has been proved historically that there were many predic-
tions accurately forecasting Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) prophethood, like those 
of the two soothsayers Shiqq and Satih, which, a while previously to it, gave 
news of it and the fact that he was to be the prophet of the end of time. 2

Thirdly: There were hundreds of extraordinary happenings, famous in 
history, called i r h a s a t , that is, signs forewarning men of a coming prophet. 
Among  them  were  the  idols  in  the  Ka‘ba  falling  from  their  places  on  the 
night of Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) birth, 3 and the famous palace of Chosroes 
the Persian being rent asunder. 4

Fourthly: History and the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) biographies show that he 
satisﬁed the thirst of an army with water ﬂowing from his ﬁngers, 1 that in 
the presence of a large congregation in the mosque, the dry wooden support 
against which he ( UWBP ) used to lean moaned like a camel and wept on 
being  separated  from  him  when  he  mounted  the  pulpit,  2  and  that  he  was 
distinguished by close on a thousand miracles attested to by such verses of 
the Qur’an as,  ( 54:1 ) ﮯ ~  referring to the splitting of the moon, 3 
and veriﬁed by those who investigated them.
Fifthly: Anyone who considers the facts and is fair and just cannot hesi-
tate to agree that, as is unanimously agreed by friend and foe alike, good 
moral qualities were to be found at the highest degree in his person, and that, 
in accordance with the testimony of all his dealings and actions, attributes 
and  character  of  the  loftiest  excellence  were  apparent  in  the  way  he  per-
formed  his  duties  and  proclaimed  Islam.  And  in  accordance  with  the  ﬁne 
qualities and conduct enjoined by the religion of Islam, laudable virtues of 
the highest order were to be found in the law he brought.

Sixthly: As is alluded to in the Second Indication of the Tenth Word, it 
is a requirement of wisdom that the Godhead be manifested. And this desire 
to be manifested is met at the widest level and in the most brilliant fashion 
by the comprehensive worship performed by Muhammad ( UWBP ) in the 
practice of his religion. Also, wisdom and truth require that the Creator of 
the world displays His beauty in its utter perfection through some means. 
And the one who met that wish, and displayed and described the Creator’s 
beauty in the most perfect fashion was self-evidently the person of Muham-
mad ( UWBP ).

It was also clearly Muhammad ( UWBP ) who, in response to the desire 
of the world’s Maker to exhibit His perfect art and inﬁnite beauty and attract 
attentive gazes towards them, heralded them with the loudest voice.

Again it was necessarily Muhammad ( UWBP ) who, in response to the 
desire of the Sustainer of All the Worlds to proclaim His unity in the levels 
of multiplicity, announced all the degrees of unity, each at its highest level.
And, as is indicated by the utter beauty of beings and is required by truth 
and wisdom, the world’s Owner desires to see His inﬁnite essential beauty

and the subtle qualities of His exquisiteness and to display them in mirrors. 
Again it was self-evidently Muhammad ( UWBP ) who in response to that 
desire acted as a mirror and displayed that beauty most radiantly, and loved 
it and made others love it.

And, in response to the desire of the Maker of the palace of this world to 
exhibit His hidden treasuries, ﬁlled as they are with wondrous miracles and 
priceless  jewels,  and  through  them  to  describe  and  make  known  His  per-
fections, it was again self-evidently Muhammad ( UWBP ) who exhibited, 
described, and displayed them in the most comprehensively.

And,  since  the  Maker  of  the  universe  adorns  it  with  various  wonders 
and embellishments and has included conscious creatures in it so that they 
might make tours and excursions and ponder over it and take lessons, wis-
dom requires that He should desire to make known the meanings and value 
of those works of art to those who will observe and ponder over them. And 
it was again self-evidently Muhammad ( UWBP ) who, in response to this 
desire  of  the  universe’s  Maker,  by  means  of  the  All-Wise  Qur’an,  acted 
as guide in the most comprehensive fashion to jinn and man, and to spirit 
beings and angels.

Also, the All-Wise Ruler of the universe wishes, by means of an envoy, 
to  cause  conscious  beings  to  unravel  the  obscure  talisman  containing  the 
aim and purpose of the change and transformations in the universe and to 
solve the riddle of the three perplexing questions: “ Where do beings come 
from? ”, “ Where are they going? ”, and “ What are they? ” And again it was 
self-evidently Muhammad ( UWBP ) who in response to this wish of the All-
Wise Ruler unravelled the talisman and solved the riddle by means of the 
truths of the Qur’an, in the clearest and most comprehensive fashion.

Also,  the  All-Glorious  Maker  of  the  universe  desires  to  make  Himself 
known to conscious beings by means of His ﬁne artefacts and to make them 
love  Him  through  all  His  precious  bounties,  and,  most  certainly,  to  make 
known to them by means of an envoy the divine wishes and what will please 
Him in return for those bounties. And again it was self-evidently Muham-
mad ( UWBP ) who, in response to this desire of the All-Glorious Maker, by 
means of the Qur’an, expounded those wishes and things that please Him by 
word and deed in the most exalted and perfect fashion.

Also, since the Sustainer of All the Worlds has given to man, who is the 
fruit of the universe, a comprehensive disposition which encompasses the 
universe  and  has  prepared  him  for  universal  worship;  and  since,  because 
of  man’s  faculties  and  senses,  multiplicity  and  the  world  afflict  him; 

NINETEENTH LETTER – THE THIRD ADDENDUM

261

the Sustainer desires to turn his face from multiplicity to unity, from transi-
ence to permanence. And again it was self-evidently Muhammad ( UWBP ) 
who, in response to this desire, by means of the Qur’an, acted as guide in the 
most comprehensive and complete fashion, and in the best way, and carried 
out the duty of prophethood in the most perfect manner.

Thus,  among  beings  the  most  superior  are  animate  beings,  and  among 
animate  beings  the  most  superior  are  conscious  beings,  and  among  con-
scious  beings  the  most  superior  are  true  human  beings,  and  among  true 
human  beings  the  one  who  carried  out  the  above-mentioned  duties  at  the 
most  comprehensive  level  and  in  the  most  perfect  form,  would  of  a  cer-
tainty rise through an all-embracing Ascension to “ t h e   d i s t a n c e   o f   t w o   b o w -
l e n g t h s , ” knock at the door of eternal happiness, open the treasury of mercy, 
and see the hidden truths of belief. Again it would be him.

Seventhly: As is plain to see, beings are made beautiful with the very 
ﬁnest embellishment. This demonstrates that their Maker possesses a pow-
erful will to make beautiful and intention to adorn. And this shows that the 
Maker necessarily possesses a strong desire and holy love towards His art. 
And among beings it was again most certainly he who displayed altogether 
in himself the most comprehensive and subtle wonders of art, and knew 
them and made them known and himself loved, and who appreciated the 
beauties to be found in other beings, declaring: “ What wonders Allah has 
willed! ”, and was most beloved in the sight of his Maker, who nurtures 
and loves His art.

Thus, it was again self-evidently he ( UWBP ) who, declaring: “ All glory 
be to Allah! What wonders Allah has willed! Allah is most Great! ” in the 
face of the exquisite qualities that gild beings and the subtle perfections that 
illuminate them, causes the heavens to ring out, and who, through the strains 
of the Qur’an, causes the universe to reverberate, and through his admira-
tion and appreciation, his contemplation and display, his mentioning of the 
divine names and afﬁrmation of divine unity, brings land and sea to a state 
of ecstasy.

Thus, in accordance with the saying  ِلِ(cid:150)اَ(cid:159)ْ(cid:170)اﯬﯦ  ُبَ(cid:93) َ

ّ(cid:127)(cid:170)َا  1 it is pure truth 
and sheer wisdom that the one on whose scales shall be found the equiva-
lent of all the good deeds performed by his community, and whose spiritual

will receive the same recompense as the one who performs it. ” See, Ti r m i d h ī , ‘Ilm, 14;

perfections draw strength from the benedictions of all his community, 1 and 
who,  as  a  result  of  the  duties  he  discharged  in  his  prophethood,  received 
immaterial recompense and boundless emanations of divine mercy and love, 
should  advance  by  the  stairway  of  the  Ascension  as  far  as  Paradise,  “ t h e  
L o t e - t r e e   o f   t h e   f a r t h e s t   l i m i t , ” the divine throne, and “ t h e   d i s t a n c e   o f   t w o

[ The Sixteenth Degree, on the Messengership of Muhammad ( UWBP ),

Then that traveller through the world addressed his own intellect saying: 
“ Since I am seeking my Master and Creator by means of the creatures of the 
cosmos, I ought before all else to visit the most celebrated of all these crea-
tures, the greatest and most accomplished commander among them, accord-
ing to the testimony even of his enemies, the most renowned ruler, the most 
exalted  in  speech  and  the  most  brilliant  an  intellect,  who  has  illuminated 
fourteen centuries with his excellence and with his Qur’an, Muhammad the 
Arabian Prophet ( May Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him ). ” In order 
thus to visit him and seek from him the answer to his quest, he entered the 
blessed age of the Prophet ( UWBP ) in his mind, and saw that age to be one 
of true felicity, thanks to that being. For through the light he had brought, he 
had turned the most primitive and illiterate of peoples into the masters and 
teachers of the world. 

He said too to his own intellect, “ Before asking him concerning our Cre-
ator, we should ﬁrst learn the value of this extraordinary being, the veracity 
of his words and the truthfulness of his warnings. ” Thus he began investi-
gating, and of the numerous conclusive proofs that he found we will brieﬂy 
indicate here only nine of the most general ones.

T h e   F i r s t :  All excellent qualities and characteristics were to be found in 
that  extraordinary  being,  according  to  the  testimony  even  of  his  enemies. 
Hundreds of miracles were made manifest at his hands, according to explicit 
Qur’anic verses or traditions enjoying the status of t a w a t u r . 1 Examples of 
these miracles are his splitting of the moon,  ( 54:1 ) ﮯ ~ with a sin-
gle  indication  of  his  ﬁnger;  his  casting  of  a  handful  of  dust  into  the  eyes 
of  his  enemies,  causing  them  to  ﬂee,  - , + * ) ( ' 
( 8:17 )   and his giving his thirsting army to drink from the water that ﬂowed 
forth from his ﬁve ﬁngers like the Spring of Kawthar. Since some of those

which there is consensus, and no room for doubt. ( Tr. )

263

264

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

miracles, numbering more than three hundred, have been set forth with deci-
sive proofs in the remarkable and wondrous work known as The Miracles of 
Muhammad ( the Nineteenth Letter ), we leave discussion of the miracles to 
that book, and permit the traveller to continue speaking:

“ A being who in addition to noble characteristics and perfections has all 
these luminous miracles to demonstrate, must certainly be the most truthful 
in speech of all men. It is inconceivable that he would stoop to trickery, lies 
and error, the deeds of the vile. ”

T h e   S e c o n d :  He holds in his hand a decree from the Lord of the universe, 
a decree accepted and afﬁrmed in each century by more than three hundred 
million people. This decree, the Qur’an of Mighty Stature, is wondrous in 
seven different ways. The fact that the Qur’an has forty different aspects of 
miraculousnes and that it is the word of the Creator of all beings has been 
set forth in detail with strong proofs in the Twenty-Fifth Word, T h e   M i r a c u -
l o u s n e s s   o f   t h e   Q u r ’ a n , a celebrated treatise that is like the sun of the R i s a l e -
i   N u r . We therefore leave such matters to that work and listen to the traveller 
as he says, “ There can never be any possibility of lying on the part of the 
being who is the conveyor and proclaimer of this decree, for that would be a 
violation of the decree and treachery toward the One who issued it. ”

T h e   T h i r d :  Such a Sacred Law, an Islam, a code of worship, a cause, a 
summons, and a faith did that being bring forth that the like of them does 
not  exist,  nor  could  it  exist.  Nor  does  a  more  perfect  form  of  them  exist, 
nor could it exist. For the Law appearing with that unlettered being has no 
rival in its administration of one ﬁfth of humanity for fourteen centuries, in 
a just and precise manner through its numerous injunctions. Moreover the 
Islam that emerged from the deeds, sayings, and inward states of that unlet-
tered being has no peer, nor can it have, for in each century it has been for 
three hundred million men a guide and a refuge, the teacher and educator 
of their intellects and the illuminator and puriﬁer of their hearts, the cause 
for the reﬁnement and training of their souls, and the source of progress and 
advancement of their spirits.

The Prophet ( UWBP ) is similarly unparalleled in the way in which he 
was the foremost in practising all the forms of worship found in his religion, 
and the ﬁrst in piety and the fear of Allah; in his observing the duties of wor-
ship  fully  and  with  attention  to  their  profoundest  dimensions,  even  while 
engaged in constant struggle and activity; in his practice of worship com-
bining in perfect fashion the beginning and end of worship and servitude of 
Allah without imitation of anyone.

NINETEENTH LETTER – THE FOURTH ADDENDUM

With the  J a u s h a n   a l - K a b i r , from among his thousands of supplicatory 
prayers  and  invocations,  he  describes  his  Sustainer  with  such  a  degree  of 
gnosis that all the gnostics and saints who have come after him have been 
unable, with their joint efforts, to attain a similar degree of gnosis and accu-
rate description. This shows that in prayer too he is without peer. Whoever 
looks at the section at the beginning of the Tr e a t i s e   o n   S u p p l i c a t o r y   P r a y e r , 
which sets forth some part of the meaning of one of the ninety-nine sections 
of the J a u s h a n   a l - K a b i r , will say that the J a u s h a n  too has no peer.

In his conveying of the message and his summoning men to the truth, 
he  displayed  such  steadfastness,  ﬁrmness  and  courage  that  although  great 
states and religions, and even his own people, tribe and uncle opposed him 
in the most hostile fashion, he exhibited not the slightest trace of hesitation, 
anxiety  or  fear.  The  fact  that  he  successfully  challenged  the  whole  world 
and made Islam the master of the world likewise proves that there is not and 
cannot be anyone like him in his conveying of the message and summons.

In his faith, he had so extraordinary a strength, so marvellous a certainty, 
so miraculous a breadth, and so exalted a conviction, illumining the whole 
world,  that  none  of  the  ideas  and  beliefs  then  dominating  the  world,  and 
none of the philosophies of the sages and teachings of the religious leaders, 
was  able,  despite  extreme  hostility  and  denial,  to  induce  in  his  certainty, 
conviction, trust and assurance, the slightest doubt, hesitation, weakness or 
anxiety. Moreover, the saintly of all ages, headed by the Companions, the 
foremost in the degrees of belief, have all drawn on his fountain of belief and 
regarded him as representing the highest degree of faith. This proves that 
his faith too is matchless. Our traveller therefore concluded, and afﬁrmed 
with  his  intellect,  that  lying  and  duplicity  have  no  place  in  the  one  who 
has brought such a unique sacred law, such an unparalleled Islam, such a 
wondrous devotion to worship, such an extraordinary excellence in suppli-
catory prayer, such a universally acclaimed summons to the truth and such 
a miraculous faith.

T h e   F o u r t h : In the same way that the consensus of the prophets is a strong 
proof for the existence and unity of Allah, so too it is a ﬁrm testimony to the 
truthfulness and messengerhood of this being. For all the sacred attributes, 
miracles and functions that indicate the truthfulness and messengerhood of 
the prophets ( Upon whom be peace ) existed in full measure in that being 
according to the testimony of history. The prophets have verbally predicted 
the coming of that being and given good tidings thereof in the Torah, the 
Gospels,  the  Psalms,  and  other  scriptures;  more  than  twenty  of  the  most 

266

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

conclusive examples of these glad tidings, drawn from the scriptures, have 
been set forth and proven in the Nineteenth Letter. Similarly, through all the 
deeds  and  miracles  associated  with  their  prophethood  they  have  afﬁrmed 
and – as it were – put their signature to the mission of that being which is 
the  foremost  and  most  perfect  in  the  tasks  and  functions  of  prophethood. 
Just as through verbal consensus they indicate the divine unity, through the 
unanimity of their deeds they bear witness to the truthfulness of that being. 
This too was understood by our traveller.

T h e   F i f t h :   Similarly,  the  thousands  of  saints  who  have  attained  truth, 
reality,  perfection,  wondrous  deeds,  unveiling  and  witnessing  through  the 
instruction  of  this  being  and  following  him,  bear  unanimous  witness  not 
only to the divine unity but also to the truthfulness and messengerhood of 
this being. Again, the fact that they witness, through the light of sainthood, 
some of the truths he proclaimed concerning the World of the Unseen, and 
that they believe in and afﬁrm all of those truths through the light of belief, 
either with ‘knowledge of certainty,’ or with the ‘vision of certainty,’ or with 
‘absolute certainty.’ He saw that this too demonstates like the sun the degree 
of truthfulness and rectitude of that great being, their master.

T h e   S i x t h :  The millions of puriﬁed, sincere, and punctilious scholars and 
faithful sages, who have reached the highest station of learning through the 
teaching and instruction contained in the sacred truths brought by that being, 
despite  his  unlettered  nature,  the  exalted  sciences  he  invented  and  divine 
knowledge  he  discovered  –  they  not  only  prove  and  afﬁrm,  unanimously 
and with the strongest proofs, the divine unity which is the foundation of his 
mission, but also bear unanimous witness to the truthfulness of this supreme 
teacher and great master, and to the veracity of his words. This is a proof 
as clear as daylight. The R i s a l e - i   N u r  too with its one hundred parts is but a 
single proof of his truthfulness.

T h e   S e v e n t h :   The  Family  and  Companions  of  the  Prophet  –  who 
with  their  insight,  knowledge,  and  spiritual  accomplishment  are  the  most 
renowned, the most respected, the most celebrated, the most pious and the 
most keensighted of men after the prophets – examined and scrutinized, with 
the utmost attention, seriousness and exactitude, all the states, thoughts and 
conditions of this being, whether hidden or open. They came to the unani-
mous conclusion that he was the most truthful, exalted, and honest being in 
the world, and this, their unshakeable afﬁrmation and ﬁrm belief, is a proof 
like the daylight attesting the reality of the sun.

NINETEENTH LETTER – THE FOURTH ADDENDUM

T h e   E i g h t h :   The  cosmos  indicates  its  Maker,  Inscriber,  and  Designer, 
who creates, administers, and arranges it, and through determining its meas-
ure and form and regulating it, has disposal over it as though it was a palace, 
a book, an exhibition, a spectacle. And so too it indicates that it requires and 
necessitates an elevated herald, a truthful unveiler, a learned master, and a 
truthful teacher who will know and make known the divine purposes in the 
universe’s creation, teach the dominical instances of wisdom in its changes 
and  transformations,  give  instruction  in  the  results  of  its  dutiful  motions, 
proclaim its essential value and the perfections of the beings within it, and 
express  the  meanings  of  that  mighty  book;  it  indicates  that  he  is  certain 
to exist. Thus, the traveller knew that it testiﬁed to the truthfulness of this 
being, who performed these functions better than anyone, and to his being a 
most elevated and loyal ofﬁcial of the universe’s Creator.

T h e   N i n t h :  There is behind the veil One who wishes to demonstrate with 
these  ingenious  and  wise  artefacts  the  perfection  of  His  talent  and  art;  to 
make Himself known and loved by means of these countless adorned and 
decorated  creations;  to  evoke  praise  and  thanks  through  the  unnumbered 
pleasurable and valuable bounties that he bestows; to cause men to worship 
Him with gratitude and appreciation in the face of His dominicality, through 
His solicitous and protective sustenance of life, and His provision of nurture 
and bounty in such manner as to satisfy the most delicate of tastes and appe-
tites; to manifest His Godhead through the change of seasons, the alternation 
of  night  and  day,  and  through  all  His  magniﬁcent  and  majestic  deeds,  all 
His awe-inspiring and wise acts and creativity, and thereby to cause men to 
believe in his Godhead, in submission, humility and obedience; and to dem-
onstrate His justice and truthfulness by at all times protecting virtue and the 
virtuous and destroying evil and the evil, by annihilating with blows from 
heaven the oppressor and the liar. There will of a certainty be at the side 
of this Unseen Being His most beloved creature and most devoted bonds-
man,  who,  serving  the  purposes  that  have  just  been  mentioned,  discovers 
and unravels the talisman and riddle of the creation of the universe, who acts 
always in the name of that Creator, who seeks aid and success from Him, 
and  who  receives  them  from  Him  –  Muhammad  of  Quraysh  ( Peace  and 
blessings be upon him! )

The traveller further said, addressing his own intellect: “ Since these nine 
truths bear witness to the truthfulness of this being, he must be the source 
of glory of mankind and the source of honour for the world. If we there-
fore call him the Pride of the World and Glory of the Sons of Adam, it will 

268

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

be  ﬁtting.  The  fact  that  the  awesome  sovereignty  of  that  decree  of  the 
Compassionate One, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition that he holds in 
his hand, has conquered half the world, together with his individual per-
fections and exalted virtues, shows that he is the most important person-
age in the world. The most important word concerning our Creator is that 
which he utters. ”

Now see: the foundation of the summons of this extraordinary being and 
the aim of all his life, based on the strength furnished by his hundreds of 
decisive and evident and manifest miracles, and the thousands of exalted, 
fundamental truths contained in his religion, was to prove and bear witness 
to the existence of the Necessary Existent, His unity, attributes and names, to 
afﬁrm, proclaim and announce Him. He is therefore like a sun in the cosmos, 
the most brilliant proof of our Creator, this being whom we call the Beloved 
of  Allah.  There  are  three  forms  of  great  and  infallible  consensus  each  of 
which afﬁrms, conﬁrms, and puts its signature to the witness he bears.

The First: the unanimous afﬁrmation made by that luminous assembly 
known and celebrated throughout the world as the Family of Muhammad 
( Upon  whom  be  blessings  and  peace )  including  thousands  of  poles  and 
supreme saints of penetrating gaze and ability to perceive the Unseen, such 
Imam ‘Ali ( May Allah be pleased with him ), who said, “ Were the veil to be 
lifted, my certainty would not increase, ” 1 and ‘Abd al-Qadir al-Gilani, the 
G h a u t h   a l - A ‘ z a m  ( May his mystery be sanctiﬁed ), who saw the Supreme 
Throne and the awesome form of Israﬁl while yet on the earth. 2

The  Second:  the  conﬁrmation  made  with  a  strong  faith  that  permitted 
men  to  sacriﬁce  their  lives  and  their  property,  their  fathers  and  tribes,  by 
the renowned assembly known as the Companions, who found themselves 
among a primitive people and in an unlettered environment, devoid of all 
social life and political thought, without any scripture and lost in the dark-
ness of a period between prophets; and who in a very brief time came to be 
the masters, guides, and just rulers of the most civilized and politically and 
socially advanced peoples and states, and to rule the world from east to west 
in universally approved fashion.

The  Third:  the  conﬁrmation  provided  with  unanimous  and  certain 
knowledge  by  that  lofty  group  of  punctilious  and  profound  scholars  of 
whom in each age thousands spring forth, who advance in wondrous fashion 
in every science and work in different ﬁelds.

Thus, the testimony brought by this being to the divine unity is not par-
ticular and individual, but general and universal and unshakeable. If all the 
demons that exist were to unite, they could not challenge it. Such was the 
conclusion reached by the traveller.

In reference to the lesson learned in the School of Light by that traveller 
from the world, that wayfarer in life, when he visited in his mind the blessed 
age of the Prophet ( UWBP ), we said at the end of the Sixteenth Degree of

Introduction
Be certain of this, that the highest aim of creation and its most important 
result is belief in Allah. The most exalted rank in humanity and its highest 
degree is the knowledge of Allah contained within belief in Allah. The most 
radiant happiness and sweetest bounty for jinn and human beings is the love 
of Allah contained within the knowledge of Allah. And the purest joy for 
the human spirit and the sheerest delight for man’s heart is the rapture of the 
spirit contained within the love of Allah. Yes, all true happiness, pure joy, 
sweet bounties, and untroubled pleasure lie in knowledge of Allah and love 
of Allah; they cannot exist without them.

The person who knows and loves Allah Almighty may receive endless 
bounties, happiness, lights, and mysteries. While the one who does not truly 
know and love him is afﬂicted spiritually and materially by endless misery, 
pain, and fears. Even if such an impotent, miserable person owned the whole 
world, it would be worth nothing for him, for it would seem to him that he 
was living a fruitless life among the vagrant human race in a wretched world 
without owner or protector. Everyone may understand just how forlorn and 
bafﬂed is man among the aimless human race in this bewildering ﬂeeting 
world if he does not know his Owner, if he does not discover his Master. But 
if he does discover and know Him, he will seek refuge in His mercy and will 
rely on His power. The desolate world will turn into a place of recreation and 
pleasure, it will become a place of trade for the hereafter. 

First Station

Each  of  the  eleven  phrases  of  the  above-mentioned  sentence  afﬁrming 
divine unity contains some good news. And in the good news lies a cure, 
while in each of those cures a spritual pleasure is to be found.

The First Phrase

THE FIRST PHRASE: ُ

ّ(cid:195)ا  َ

ّ(cid:202)ِا َهٰ(cid:170)ِا  ٓ
َ(cid:202)

This phrase conveys the following good news to the human spirit, suffer-
ing as it does countless needs and the attacks of innumerable enemies. On 
the one hand the spirit ﬁnds a place of recourse, a source of help, through 
which is opened to it the door of a treasury of mercy that will guarantee all 
its needs. While on the other it ﬁnds a support and source of strength, for the 
phrase makes known its Creator and True Object of Worship, who possesses 
the absolute power to secure it from the evil of all its enemies; it shows its 
master,  and  who  it  is  that  owns  it.  Through  pointing  this  out,  the  phrase 

ٰ
272

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

saves the heart from utter desolation and the spirit from aching sorrow; it 
ensures an eternal joy, a perpetual happiness.

The Second Phrase

THE SECOND PHRASE:  ُهَدْ(cid:110)َو

and a source of happiness:

This phrase announces the following good news, which is both healing 

Man’s spirit and heart, which are connected to most of the creatures in the 
universe and are almost overwhelmed in misery and confusion on account 
of this connection, ﬁnd in the phrase ُهَدْ(cid:110)َو a refuge and protector that will 
deliver them from all the confusion and bewilderment.

That is to say, it is as if  ُهَدْ(cid:110)َو is saying to man: Allah is One. Do not 
wear yourself out having recourse to other things; do not demean yourself 
and feel indebted to them; do not ﬂatter them and fawn on them and humili-
ate yourself; do not follow them and make things difﬁcult for yourself; do 
not fear them and tremble before them; for the Monarch of the universe is 
One, the key to all things is with Him, the reins of all things are in His hand, 
everything will be resolved by His command. If you ﬁnd Him, you will be 
saved from endless indebtedness, countless fears.

The Third Phrase

THE THIRD PHRASE:  ُهَ(cid:170) 

َك(cid:192)ِرَ(cid:130)  َ(cid:202)

Just as in His divinity and in His sovereignty Allah has no partner, He is 
One and cannot be many; so too He has no partner in His dominicality and 
in His actions and in His creating. It sometimes happens that a monarch is 
one, having no partner in his sovereignty, but in the execution of his affairs 
his ofﬁcials act as his partners; they prevent everyone from entering his pres-
ence, saying: “ Apply to us! ”

However, Allah Almighty, the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eter-
nity, has no partner in His sovereignty, just as He has no need for partners or 
helpers in the execution of His dominicality. 

If it were not for His command and will, His strength and power, not a 
single  thing  could  interfere  with  another.  Everyone  can  have  recourse  to 
Him directly. Since He has no partner or helper, no one seeking recourse can 
be told: “ Stop! It is forbidden to enter His presence! ”

This phrase, therefore, delivers the following joyful announcement to the 
human spirit: the human spirit which has attained to faith may, without let or 
hindrance, opposition or interference, in any state, for any wish, at any time 
and in any place, enter the presence of the All-Beauteous and Glorious One, 

TWENTIETH LETTER – FIRST STATION

273

The Fourth Phrase

the One of power and perfection, who is the Pre-Eternal and Post-Eternal 
Owner of the treasuries of mercy, the treasuries of bliss, and may present its 
needs. Discovering His mercy and relying on His power, it will ﬁnd perfect 
ease and happiness.
THE FOURTH PHRASE:  ُكْ(cid:171)ُ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)ا ُهَ(cid:170)

That is to say, ownership is altogether His. As for you, you are both His 
property, you are owned by Him, and you work in His property. This phrase 
announces the following joyful and healing news:

O man! Do not suppose that you own yourself, for you have no control 
over any of the things that concern you; such a load would be heavy. Also, 
you are unable to protect yourself, to avoid disasters, or to do the things that 
you must. In which case, do not suffer pain and torment without reason, the 
ownership is another’s. The Owner is both All-Powerful and All-Merciful; 
rely on His power and do not cast aspersions on His mercy! Put grief behind 
you, be joyful! Discard your troubles and ﬁnd serenity!

It  also  says:  You  love  and  are  connected  to  the  universe,  which  is  the 
property of the All-Powerful and Merciful One, yet although it grieves you 
by its wretchedness, you are unable to put it right. So hand over the property 
to its Owner, leave it to Him. Attract His pleasure, not His harshness. He 
is both All-Wise and All-Merciful. He has free disposal over His property 
and administers it as He wishes. Whenever you take fright, say like Ibra-
him Hakkı: “ Let’s see what the Master does; whatever He does, it is best; ” 
understand this thoroughly and do not interfere!

The Fifth Phrase

THE FIFTH PHRASE: ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)ا ُهَ(cid:170)

Praise, laudation, and acclaim are proper to Him, are ﬁtting for Him; that 
is to say, bounties are His; they come from His treasury, and as for the treas-
ury, it is unending. This phrase, therefore, delivers the following good news:
O man! Do not suffer and sorrow when bounties cease, for the treasury 
of mercy is inexhaustible. Do not dwell on the ﬂeeting nature of pleasure 
and cry out with pain, because the fruit of the bounty is the fruit of a bound-
less mercy. Since its tree is undying, when the fruit ﬁnishes it is replaced 
by more. If you thankfully think of there being within the pleasure of the 
bounty a merciful favour a hundred times more pleasurable, you will be able 
to increase the pleasure a hundredfold.

An apple an august monarch presents to you holds a pleasure superior to 
that of a hundred, indeed a thousand, apples, for it is he that has bestowed it 

274

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

on you and made you experience the pleasure of a royal favour. In the same 
way, through the phrase ُد ْ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)ا ُهَ(cid:170) will be opened to you the door of a spir-
itual pleasure a thousand times sweeter than the bounty itself. For the phrase 
means to offer praise and thanks; that is to say, to perceive the bestowal of 
bounty. This in turn means to recognize the Bestower, which is to reﬂect 
on the bestowal of bounty, and so ﬁnally to ponder over the favour of His 
compassion and His continuing to bestow bounties.

The Sixth Phrase

THE SIXTH PHRASE:  ىِ(cid:193)ْ(cid:111)ُ(cid:192)

That is to say, He is the giver of life. And it is He who causes life to con-
tinue by means of sustenance. He also supplies the necessities of life. And it 
is to Him that the exalted aims of life pertain and its important results look, 
and His are ninety-nine out of a hundred of its fruits. Thus, this phrase calls 
out in this way to ephemeral, impotent man, it makes this joyful announce-
ment:

O  man!  Do  not  trouble  yourself  by  shouldering  the  heavy  burdens  of 
life. Do not think of the transience of life and start grieving. Do not see only 
its worldly and unimportant fruits and regret that you came to this world. 
For the life-machine in the ship of your being belongs to the Ever-Living 
and Self-Subsistent One, and it is He who provides for all its expenses and 
requirements. Also, your life has a great many aims and results, and they 
pertain to Him, too.

As for you, you are just a helmsman on the ship, so do your duty well and 
take the wage and pleasure that come with it. Think of just how precious is 
the life-ship and how valuable its beneﬁts; then think of just how Generous 
and Merciful is the Owner of the ship. So rejoice and give thanks and know 
that when you perform your duty with integrity, all the results the ship pro-
duces will in one respect be transferred to the register of your actions, that 
they will secure an immortal life for you, will endow you with eternal life.

The Seventh Phrase

THE SEVENTH PHRASE:   ُت(cid:193) ِ(cid:175)ُ(cid:192)َو

He is the one who causes death. He discharges you from the duty of life, 
changes your abode from this transitory world, and releases you from the 
labour of service. That is, He takes you from a transient life to an immortal 
one. This phrase, then, shouts out the following to ephemeral jinn and man:
Here is good news for you! Death is not destruction, or nothingness, or 
annihilation; it is not cessation or extinction; it is not eternal separation, or 
non-existence,  or  a  chance  event;  it  is  not  authorless  obliteration.  Rather, 

TWENTIETH LETTER – FIRST STATION

275

it is to be discharged by the Author who is All-Wise and All-Compassionate; 
it is a change of abode. It is to be despatched to eternal bliss, to your true 
home. It is the door of union to the Intermediate Realm, which is where you 
will meet with ninety-nine per cent of your friends.

The Eighth Phrase

THE EIGHTH PHRASE:   ُتوُ(cid:175)َ(cid:192)  َ(cid:202)  ٌ

ّىَ(cid:110) َوُ(cid:182)َو
That  is  to  say,  the  Possessor  of  a  beauty,  perfection,  and  muniﬁcence 
that are inﬁnitely superior to the beauty, perfection, and muniﬁcence to be 
seen in the creatures of the universe, and that arouse love; and an Eternal 
Object of Worship, an Everlasting Beloved, a single manifestation of whose 
beauty is sufﬁcent to replace all other beloveds, has an enduring life through 
pre-eternity  and  post-eternity  –  a  life  free  from  any  trace  of  cessation  or 
ephemerality and exempt from any fault, defect, or imperfection. Thus, this 
phrase proclaims to jinn and man, to all conscious beings, and the people of 
love and ardour:

Here  is  good  news  for  you!  There  exists  an  Everlasting  Beloved  who 
will  cure  and  bind  the  wounds  caused  you  by  countless  separations  from 
the  ones  you  love.  Since  He  exists  and  is  undying,  whatever  happens  do 
not fret over the others. Furthermore, the beauty and generosity, virtue and 
perfection to be seen in them, the cause of your love, are, passing through 
many veils, the shadows of the palest of shadows of the manifestation of the 
Ever-Enduring Beloved’s ever-enduring beauty. Do not grieve at their dis-
appearance, for they are mirrors of a sort. The mirrors being changed renews 
and embellishes the manifestation of the Beauty’s radiance. Since He exists, 
everything exists.
THE NINTH PHRASE:  ُرْ(cid:193)َ(cid:115)ْ(cid:170)ا ِه ِدَ(cid:193)ِ(cid:92)

The Ninth Phrase

Every good action you perform is transferred to His register. Every right-
eous deed you do is recorded with Him. Thus, this phrase calls out to jinn 
and mankind with the following good news:

O  wretched  ones!  When  you  journey  to  the  grave  do  not  cry  out  in 
despair,  “ Alas!  Everything  we  owned  is  destroyed,  all  our  efforts  are 
wasted;  we  have  left  the  beautiful  broad  earth  and  entered  the  narrow 
grave, ” for everything of yours is preserved, all your actions written down, 
every service you have rendered recorded. A Glorious One in whose hand 
is all good and who is able to bring all good to fruition, will reward your 
service: drawing you to Himself, He will keep you only temporarily under 
the ground. Later, He will bring you to His presence. What happiness for 

276

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

those  of  you  who  have  completed  their  service  and  duty;  your  labour  is 
ﬁnished, you are departing for ease and mercy! Service and toil are over, 
you are going to receive your wage!

The Tenth Phrase

The All-Powerful One of Glory preserves seeds and grains, which are the 
pages of the register of last spring’s deeds and the deposit-boxes of its serv-
ices, and publishes them the following spring in glittering fashion, indeed, 
in a manner a hundred times more plentiful than the originals. The results of 
your life He is preserving in the same way, and will reward your service in 
a truly abundant fashion.
THE TENTH PHRASE:  ٌر(cid:192) ِدَ(cid:162)  ٍء ْي َ(cid:130)  ّ

ِلﯭﯦ ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) َوُ(cid:182)َو

He is One, He is Unique, He has power over everything. Nothing at all 
is difﬁcult for Him. To create the spring is as easy for Him as to create a 
ﬂower, and He creates Paradise with as much ease as He creates the spring. 
The innumerable artefacts which He continuously creates every day, every 
year,  every  century,  witness  with  numberless  tongues  to  His  boundless 
power. Thus, this phrase too delivers good news:

O  man!  The  service  you  have  offered  and  the  worship  you  have  per-
formed are not for nothing. A realm of reward, an abode of bliss, has been 
prepared for you. An unending Paradise is awaiting you in place of this ﬂeet-
ing world of yours. Have faith and conﬁdence in the promise of the Glorious 
Creator  whom  you  know  and  whom  you  worship,  for  it  is  impossible  for 
Him to break His promise. In absolutely no respect is there any deﬁciency 
in His power; impotence cannot impede His works. Just as He creates your 
tiny garden, so He is able to create Paradise for you, and He has created it 
and promised it to you. And because He has promised, He shall, of course, 
admit you to it!

We observe every year on the face of the earth that He gathers together 
and disperses with perfect order and balance, with perfect timing and ease, 
more than three hundred thousand species and groups of animals and plants. 
Most certainly such an All-Powerful One of Glory is capable of carrying out 
His promise. 

Since, being thus absolutely Powerful He creates samples of the resur-
rection and Paradise in thousands of forms every year; and since, promising 
eternal bliss through all His revealed scriptures, He gives the glad tidings 
of Paradise; and since all His actions and deeds are carried out with truth, 
veracity, and seriousness; and since, through the testimony of all His works 
of  art,  all  perfections  point  to  and  testify  to  His  inﬁnite  perfection,  there 

TWENTIETH LETTER – FIRST STATION

277

being  in  absolutely  no  respect  any  defect  or  fault  in  Him;  and  since  the 
breaking  of  a  promise,  lying,  falsehood,  and  deception  are  the  ugliest  of 
qualities  besides  being  defects  and  faults;  then  most  decidedly  and  most 
certainly that All-Powerful One of Glory, that All-Wise One of Perfection, 
that All-Merciful One of Beauty, will carry out His promise; He will open 
the gate to eternal bliss; He will admit you, O people of faith, to Paradise, 
which was the original home of your forefather Adam.

The Eleventh Phrase

THE ELEVENTH PHRASE:  ُر(cid:193) ِ(cid:135) َ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)ا ِهْ(cid:193)َ(cid:170)ِاَو

Human beings are sent to this world, the realm of trial and examination, 
with the important duties of trading and acting as ofﬁcials. After they have 
concluded their transactions, accomplished their duties, and completed their 
service, they will return and meet once more with their Generous Master and 
Glorious Creator who sent them forth in the ﬁrst place. Leaving this tran-
sient realm, they will be honoured and elevated to the presence of grandeur 
in the realm of permanence. That is to say, being delivered from the turbu-
lence of causes and from the obscure veils of intermediaries, they will meet 
with their Merciful Sustainer without veil at the seat of His eternal majesty. 
Everyone  will  ﬁnd  his  Creator,  True  Object  of  Worship,  Sustainer,  Lord, 
and Owner and will know Him directly. Thus, this phrase proclaims the fol-
lowing joyful news, which is greater than all the rest:

O  man!  Do  you  know  where  you  are  going  and  where  you  are  being 
driven? As is stated at the end of the Thirty-Second Word, a thousand years 
of happy life in this world cannot be compared to one hour of life in Para-
dise. And a thousand years of life in Paradise cannot be compared to one 
hour’s vision of the sheer loveliness of the Beauteous One of Glory. You are 
going to the realm of His mercy, and to His presence.

The loveliness and beauty in all the creatures of this world and in those 
worldly beloveds by which you are so stricken and obsessed and for which 
you  are  so  desirous,  are  but  a  sort  of  shadow  of  the  manifestation  of  His 
beauty and of the loveliness of His names; and all Paradise with all of its 
subtle  wonders,  a  single  manifestation  of  His  mercy;  and  all  longing  and 
love and allurement and captivation, but a ﬂash of the love of the Eternal 
Worshipful One and Everlasting Beloved. You are going to the sphere of 
His  presence.  You  are  being  summoned  to  Paradise,  which  is  an  eternal 
feasting place. Since this is so, you should enter the grave not weeping, but 
smiling in expectation.

The phrase announces this good news as well: O man! Do not be appre-
hensive, imagining that you are going to extinction, non-existence, nothing-
ness, darkness, oblivion, decay, and dissolution, and that you will drown in 
multiplicity. You are going not to extinction, but to permanence. You are 
being  impelled  not  to  non-existence,  but  to  perpetual  existence.  You  are 
going to enter not darkness, but the world of light. And you are returning to 
your true owner, to the seat of the Pre-Eternal Monarch. You will not drown 
in multiplicity, you will take your rest in the realm of unity. You are bound 
not for separation, but for union. ”

Second Station 

[ The  Second  Station  proves  divine  unity  at  the  level  of  the  Greatest 
Name, brieﬂy and in summary form. ]

The First Phrase

THE FIRST PHRASE: ُ

ّ(cid:195)ا  َ

ّ(cid:202)ِا َهٰ(cid:170)ِا  ٓ
َ(cid:202)

In this phrase is an afﬁrmation of the unity of the Godhead and of the 
True Object of Worship. An extremely powerful proof of this degree is as 
follows:

A most orderly activity is apparent on the face of the universe, especially 
on the page of the earth. And we observe there a most wise creativity. And 
we clearly see a systematic unfolding; that is, everything being expanded 
and revealed and given an appropriate shape and form. Furthermore, we see 
a most compassionate, generous, and merciful muniﬁcence and bountiful-
ness.  Since  this  is  so,  it  of  necessity  proves,  indeed  provokes  awareness 
of, the necessary existence and unity of an Active, Creative, Opening, and 
Muniﬁcent Possessor of Glory.

Indeed, the constant evanescence and renewal of beings demonstrate that 
those beings are the manifestations of the sacred names of an All-Powerful 
Maker, and are shadows of the lights of His names; that they are works of 
art produced by His actions, and impressions and pages inscribed by the pen 
of divine determining and power; that they are mirrors reﬂecting the beauty 
of His perfection.

Just as the Owner of the universe proves this mighty truth and exalted 
degree of the afﬁrmation of His unity with all the scriptures and sacred books 
that He has revealed, so have the people of truth and the perfected members 
of the human race proved it through their investigations and discoveries. The 
universe too points to this degree through the unceasing testimonies of the 
miracles of art, wonders of power, and treasuries of wealth that it displays, 
despite its impotence and poverty. That is to say, the scriptures and books of 
the Pre-Eternal Witness, and the investigations and unveilings of the people 
of witnessing, and the orderly states and wise and purposeful functions of 
the Manifest World are united in their agreement on this degree of the afﬁr-
mation of divine unity.

Those who do not accept the Single One of Unity ( V â h i d - i   E h a d  ), there-
fore, must either accept innumerable gods, or else like the foolish Sophists, 
deny both their own existence and that of the universe.

The Second Phrase

THE SECOND PHRASE:  ُهَدْ(cid:110)َو

This phrase demonstrates an explicit degree of the afﬁrmation of divine 

unity. A convincing and comprehensive argument proving it is as follows:

When we open our eyes, when the universe fastens our gaze on its face, 
the  ﬁrst  thing  to  attract  our  attention  is  a  universal  and  perfect  order;  we 
see that there is a comprehensive, sensitive equilibrium; everything exists 
within a precise order and delicate balance and measure.

When we look a little more carefully, a continual ordering and balancing 
strike our eye. That is to say, someone is changing the order with regularity 
and renewing the balance with measuredness. Everything is a model and is 
clothed in a great many orderly balanced forms.

When we study it even more closely, a wisdom and justice appear behind 
the ordering and balancing. A purpose and beneﬁt are considered, a truth, 
a  usefulness  are  followed  in  the  motion  of  everything,  even  the  minutest 
particles.

When we study it with even greater attention, what strikes our conscious 
gaze  is  the  demonstration  of  a  power  within  an  extremely  wise  activity, 
and the manifestation of a comprehensive knowledge that encompasses all 
things together with all their attributes.

That is to say, the order and balance in all beings show us plainly a uni-
versal  ordering  and  balancing;  and  the  ordering  and  balancing  show  us  a 
universal wisdom and justice; and the wisdom and justice in turn show us a 
power and knowledge. That is, it is apparent that behind these veils is One 
Powerful over all things who has Knowledge of all things.

Furthermore, we look to the beginning and end of everything, and we see, 
particularly in animate creatures, that their beginnings, origins, and roots are 
such that it is as if their seeds contain all the systems and members of those 
creatures, each in the form of an instruction sheet and timetable. Then their 
fruits and results are such that the meanings of those animate creatures are 
ﬁltered and concentrated in them; they bequeath their life histories to them. 
It is as if their seeds are collections of the principles according to which they 
were given existence, and their fruits and results a sort of index of the com-
mands that brought them into existence. Then we look to the outer and inner 
faces of those animate creatures: the free disposal of an utterly wise power 

TWENTIETH LETTER – SECOND STATION

281

and  the  fashioning  and  ordering  of  an  utterly  effective  will  are  apparent. 
That is, a strength and power create; a command and will clothe with form.
Thus, when we study beings attentively, we observe that their begin-
nings  are  instruction  sheets  prepared  by  One  Possessing  Knowledge, 
and that their ends are plans and manifestos of a Maker; that their outer 
faces are beautifully proportioned dresses of artistry devised by One who 
Chooses  and  Wills,  and  their  inner  faces,  well-designed  machines  of  an 
All-Powerful One.

This situation, therefore, necessarily and self-evidently proclaims that no 
time and no place, absolutely nothing, can be outside the grip of power of 
one  single  Glorious  Maker.  Each  thing  and  all  things  together  with  all  of 
their attributes are planned and directed within the grip of power of an All-
Powerful Possessor of Will; they are made beautiful through the ordering 
and graciousness of a Merciful and Compassionate One; and they are embel-
lished with the adorning of a Loving Benefactor.

Indeed, for anyone who is intelligent and has eyes in his head, the order 
and equilibrium, and ordering and adorning in the universe and in the beings 
within it demonstrate, at the degree of unity, One who is Single, Sole, Soli-
tary, Unique, All-Powerful, Possessing of Will, All-Knowing, and All-Wise.
Assuredly,  there  is  a  unity  in  everything,  and  as  for  unity,  it  points  to 
one. For example, the whole world is illuminated by one lamp, the sun; in 
which case, the world’s Owner is One and the same. And, for example, all 
the animate creatures on the earth are served by air, ﬁre, and water, which 
are the same. Since this is so, the One who employs them and subjugates 
them to us is also One.

This phrase is proved cogently and brilliantly in the First Station of the 
Thirty-Second Word, so we refer you to that. It cannot be more clearly elu-

The Fourth Phrase

THE FOURTH PHRASE:   ُكْ(cid:171)ُ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)ا ُهَ(cid:170)

That is, every creature from the face of the earth to the Divine Throne, 
from the ground to the Pleiades, from the minutest particles to the heavenly 
bodies,  everything  from  pre-eternity  to  post-eternity,  the  heavens  and  the 
earth, this world and the hereafter, belongs to Him. His is the highest degree 
of ownership in the form of the greatest afﬁrmation of divine unity ( t e v h i d - i  
â z a m  ). A mighty proof of this was imparted to this powerless one’s mind

ْ(cid:202)اَو  ّ

First Section

There  is  within  man  the  sample,  on  a  very  small  scale,  of  the  orderly 
art which is in the universe. And as the art that is present in the vast sphere 
testiﬁes to the Single Maker, so the microscopic art which is on a tiny scale 
in man points to the Maker and demonstrates His unity. Moreover, as man is 
a meaningful missive inscribed by his Sustainer, and a well-composed ode 
written by divine determining, so is the universe a well-composed ode writ-
ten by that same pen, but on a vast scale.

Is it at all possible that anything other than the Single One of Unity could 
have  a  hand  in  placing  the  stamp  of  uniqueness  on  men’s  faces,  which, 
although  they  resemble  one  another,  all  have  their  distinguishing  marks; 
and have a hand in setting the seal of unity on the universe, all of whose 
creatures co-operate, helping and supporting one another? Could anything 
interfere in this?

Second Section

Second Section: خ(cid:170)ا ... َكاَذِ(cid:170) ُهُ(cid:150)اَدْ(cid:92)ِا  It has this meaning: the All-Wise Maker 
created the macrocosm in such a novel, wonderful form, inscribing on it the 
signs of His grandeur, that He transformed it into a mighty mosque. And He 

TWENTIETH LETTER – SECOND STATION

created man in this way: giving him intellect and causing him to prostrate in 
wonderment with it at those miracles of His art and at His wondrous power, 
He caused him to read the signs of His grandeur. Thus girding him ready for 
worship in that mighty mosque, He created him as a prostrating slave.

Third Section

Is it at all possible that the true object of worship of those prostrating wor-
shippers in this mighty mosque could be other than the One, Single Maker?
Third Section: خ(cid:170)ا ... َكاَذِ(cid:170) ُهُ(cid:86)اَ(cid:131)ْ(cid:178)ِا It has this meaning: the Glorious Lord of 
All Dominion created the macrocosm, and especially the face of the earth, 
so that it resembles countless concentric circles or spheres. Every sphere is 
like an arable ﬁeld where, minute by minute, season by season, century by 
century, He sows, reaps, and harvests crops. He continuously administers 
His property, and works it.

He has made the world of minute particles, the largest sphere, into a ﬁeld. 
With His power and with His wisdom, He unceasingly sows crops in it to 
the extent of the universe, and reaps and harvests them. He despatches them 
from the Manifest World to the World of the Unseen; from the sphere of 
power to the sphere of knowledge.

Next  He  has  made  the  face  of  the  earth,  which  is  a  medium  sphere,  a 
place of cultivation in exactly the same way, where, season by season, He 
plants worlds, species, and reaps and harvests them. His immaterial crops 
too He sends to the immaterial worlds, to the Worlds of the Unseen, and the 
hereafter, and the World of Similitudes.

A garden, too, which is a smaller sphere, He ﬁlls hundreds and thousands 
of times with power and empties with wisdom. And from the even smaller 
sphere of an animate creature, a tree or a human being, for example, He har-
vests crops that are a hundred times greater than the being itself. That is to 
say, the Glorious Lord of All Dominion creates all things, great and small, 
universal and particular, as models, and clothes them in hundreds of ways in 
the weavings of His art, which are embroidered with continuously renewed 
inscriptions; He displays the manifestations of His names, the miracles of 
His power. He has created everything in His property as a page; He writes 
meaningful letters in hundreds of ways on each page; He displays His wis-
dom, His signs, and He invites intelligent creatures to read them.

In addition to bringing the macrocosm into being in the form of a culti-
vated property, He has created man and has given him such tools and abili-
ties, senses, feelings, and especially such a soul, such desires, needs, appe-
tities, greed and claims, that in that extensive property he is like a totally 
owned creature who is in need of all of it.

284

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

Is it therefore at all possible that anything apart from the Glorious Lord 
of All Dominion, who makes everything from the vast world of minute par-
ticles to a ﬂy, as a ﬁeld and cultivated property, and makes insigniﬁcant man 
a spectator, inspector, tiller, merchant, herald, worshipper, and slave in that 
vast property and takes him as an honoured guest and beloved addressee of 
Himself – could anything other than Him have free disposal over the prop-
erty and be lord over the totally owned slave?

Fourth Section

Fourth  Section:  خ(cid:170)ا  ... َكاَذ  ىِ(cid:158)  ُهُ(cid:99)َ(cid:151)ْ(cid:179)َ(cid:134)  Its  meaning  is  this:  the  Glorious 
Maker’s art in the macrocosm is so meaningful that because it is manifested 
in  the  form  of  a  book,  thus  making  the  universe  into  a  huge  volume,  the 
human intellect has extracted the library of true natural science and philoso-
phy from it and has written the library accordingly. And that book of wis-
dom is bound to reality and draws assistance from reality to such a degree 
that it has been proclaimed in the form of the All-Wise Qur’an, which is a 
copy of that huge manifested book. 

Moreover, just as His art in the universe is in the form of a book, describ-
ing its perfect orderedness, so too His colouring and the inscription of His 
wisdom in man has opened the ﬂower of speech. That is, His art is so mean-
ingful,  sensitive,  and  beautiful  that  it  has  caused  the  components  of  that 
animate machine to speak as though they were gramophones. It has given 
man such a dominical colouring in his “ fairest of forms ” that the ﬂower of 
speech  and  expression,  which  is  immaterial,  insubstantial  and  living,  has 
opened in his material, corporeal and solid head. And it has equipped the 
power of speech and expression, which is situated in man’s head, with such 
exalted tools and abilities that it has caused it to develop and progress to a 
degree whereat he becomes the addressee of the Pre-Eternal Monarch. That 
is, the dominical colouring in man’s essential nature has opened the ﬂower 
of divine address.

Is it at all possible that anything other than the Single One of Unity could 
interfere  in  that  art  in  creatures,  which  is  so  high  as  to  be  in  the  form  of 
a  book,  and  in  that  colouring  in  man  whereby  he  attains  to  the  station  of 
speech and address? Allah forbid!

Fifth Section

Fifth Section: خ(cid:170)ا ... َكاَذ ىِ(cid:158) ُهُ(cid:98)َرْدُ(cid:162) It has this meaning: divine power in the 
macrocosm demonstrates the majesty of His dominicality, whereas domini-
cal mercy arrays His bounties in man, who is the microcosm. That is, the 
Maker’s  power,  in  respect  of  grandeur  and  glory  ( c e l â l  ),  creates  the  uni-
verse in the form of a palace so magniﬁcent that its sun is a mighty electric 

TWENTIETH LETTER – SECOND STATION

light,  its  moon,  a  lamp,  and  its  stars,  candles,  gilded  fruits  and  scattered 
lights. While the face of the earth is a laden table, an arable ﬁeld, a garden, 
a carpet; and its mountains, each a storehouse, a mast, a fortress; and so on.
He demonstrates the majesty of His dominicality in brilliant fashion by, 
on  a  vast  scale,  making  all  things  into  the  huge  palace’s  necessities;  and 
His mercy, in respect of beauty ( c e m â l  ), bestows on all creatures with spir-
its, and even on the minutest animate creatures, the varieties of His boun-
ties, ordering their beings with them. He adorns them from head to toe with 
the bounties, embellishing them abundantly, muniﬁcently. He has counter-
poised the beauty of His mercy and that glorious majesty, those microscopic 
tongues and that vast tongue.

That is, while the huge heavenly bodies like the suns and constellations 
are proclaiming with the tongue of majesty: “ O Glorious One! O Mighty 
One! O August One! ”, those tiny animate creatures, like ﬂies and ﬁshes, are 
declaring, but with the tongue of mercy: “ O Beautiful One! O Compassion-
ate One! O Generous One! ”; they are adding their gentle songs to that great 
orchestra, sweetening it.

Is  it  at  all  possible  that  anything  other  than  the  All-Glorious  One  of 
Beauty and All-Beauteous One of Glory could have any part in the creation 
of the macrocosm and microcosm? Allah forbid!

Sixth Section

Sixth Section: خ(cid:170)ا ... َكاَذ ىِ(cid:158) ُهُ(cid:99) َ(cid:175) ْ(cid:131) ِ(cid:110) Its meaning is this: just as the majesty 
of dominicality, which is manifested in the totality of the universe, proves 
and  demonstrates  divine  unity  ( v a h d â n i y e t  ),  so  dominical  bounty,  which 
bestows  on  the  members  of  animate  creatures  their  regular  provisions, 
proves and demonstrates divine oneness ( e h a d i y e t  ).

As for unity, it is to say that all those creatures belong to One and they 
look to One and they are the creation of One. Whereas by oneness is meant 
that  most  of  the  names  of  the  Creator  of  all  things  are  manifested  in  all 
beings. For example, the light of the sun may be seen as analogous to unity 
by reason of its comprehending the face of the earth. While the fact that its 
light and heat, the seven colours in its light and some sort of shadow of it are 
found in all transparent objects and drops of water makes them analogous 
to oneness. And the fact that most of the Maker’s names are manifested in 
each single thing, especially in each animate creature, and above all in man, 
points to oneness.

Thus, this section indicates that the majesty of dominicality ( r u b û b i y e t  ), 
which has total disposal over the universe, makes the huge sun a servant, a 

286

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

lamp, and a stove for animate creatures on the face of the earth; and makes 
the mighty earth a cradle, a hostel, and place of trade for them; and ﬁre, a 
cook and friend present everywhere; and clouds, strainers and wet-nurses; 
and  mountains,  storehouses  and  treasuries;  and  the  air,  a  fan  for  animate 
creatures, for breathing in and out; and water, a nurse who suckles new arriv-
als to life and a seller of sweet drinks who supplies animals with the water of 
life; this divine dominicality demonstrates divine unity most lucidly.

Indeed, who other than the One Creator could subjugate the sun so that 
it is a servant of the inhabitants of the earth? And who other than the Single 
One of Unity could take the wind in His hand entrusting it with a great many 
duties and employing it as a swift and agile servant on the face of the earth? 
And who apart from the Single One of Unity would have the ability to make 
ﬁre a cook, and to cause a tiny ﬂame the size of a match-head to consume 
thousands of tons of goods? And so on. Every single thing, every single ele-
ment, every single heavenly body, points to the All-Glorious One of Unity, 
at the degree of the majesty of dominicality.

Thus,  as  divine  unity  is  apparent  in  respect  of  glory  and  majesty,  so 
bounty and muniﬁcence proclaim divine oneness in respect of beauty and 
mercy. This is because, within this all-embracing art, animate creatures and 
especially man possess the faculties and abilities to understand, accept, and 
desire the inﬁnite varieties of bounties, and to reﬂect all the divine names 
manifested in the universe. Simply, like a point of focus, man displays all the 
Beautiful Names together by means of his mirror-like essence, and through 
it, proclaims Allah’s oneness.

beauty, which are the causes of acclaim, and everything that gives rise to 
praise, are His, they belong to Him. Indeed, as the Qur’an indicates, wor-
ship,  gloriﬁcation,  prostration,  supplication,  and  praise  and  laudation  rise 
continuously, unceasingly, from all beings to the divine court. The following 
is a comprehensive proof which sets forth this truth afﬁrming divine unity.

When we look at the universe, it appears to us in the form of a park set 
with gardens, its roof gilded with lofty stars, its ground inhabited by orna-
mented beings. When we see it thus, we observe that the orderly, luminous, 
lofty heavenly bodies and purposive, ornamented earthly beings in this park 
are all saying, each in its particular tongue: “ We are the miracles of power of 
an All-Powerful One of Glory; we testify to the unity of an All-Wise Crea-
tor, an Omnipotent Maker. ”

Then we look at the globe of the earth within the park of the universe and 
we see it in the form of a garden in which uncountable varieties of multicol-
oured, beautifully adorned ﬂowering plants have been laid out and through 
which innumerable species of animals have been scattered. In this garden of 
the earth, all these adorned plants and decorated animals proclaim through 
their well-ordered forms and balanced shapes: “ We are each of us a miracle, 
a wonder of art, created by a Single All-Wise Maker; each of us heralds His 
unity and is a witness to His unity. ” 

Moreover, looking at the trees in the garden, we see fruits and ﬂowers in 
various forms which have been made knowingly, wisely, generously, sub-
tly, and beautifully to the utmost degree. And they are proclaiming unani-
mously: “ We are the miraculous gifts of a Compassionate One of Beauty, a 
Merciful One of Perfection; we are wondrous bounties. ”

Thus, the heavenly bodies and beings in the park of the universe, and the 
plants and animals in the garden of the earth, and the blossom and fruits on 
its trees and plants, testify and proclaim in an inﬁnitely resounding voice: 
“ Our Creator and Fashioner, the All-Powerful One of Beauty, the Peerless 
All-Wise One, the All-Generous Granter of Favours, who bestowed us as 
gifts, is powerful over all things. Nothing at all is difﬁcult for Him. Nothing 
at all is outside the bounds of His power. In relation to His power minute 

288

particles and stars are equal. A universal is as simple as a particular, while a 
particular is as valuable as a universal. The largest is as easy as the smallest 
in relation to His power, and the small is as full of art as the large; indeed, as 
far as art is concerned, the small is greater than the large.

“ All the occurrences of the past, which are wonders of His power, testify 
that that Absolutely Powerful One is also powerful over the wonders of the 
future and its contingencies. Just as the one who brought about yesterday 
will bring about tomorrow, so the All-Powerful One who created the past 
will also create the future. The All-Wise Maker who made this world, will 
also make the hereafter.

“ Yes, just as the All-Powerful One of Glory is the only one truly deserv-
ing of worship; so He is the only one deserving of praise. Just as worship is 
exclusively His, so are praise and laudation His alone. ”

Is it at all possible that an All-Wise Maker who created the heavens and 
the  earth  would  leave  without  purpose  human  beings,  who  are  their  most 
important result and the most perfect fruit of the universe? Is it at all possible 
that He would hand them over to causes and chance, that He would trans-
form His self-evident wisdom into futility? Allah forbid! Is it at all possible 
that  having  planned  then  formed  a  tree,  giving  it  the  utmost  importance, 
and having administered it and raised it with the greatest wisdom, someone 
who was wise and knowing would ignore its fruits, which are its aim and 
purpose? Would he attach no importance to them, and leave them either for 
thieves or to rot scattered on the ground? Of course it would be impossible. 
It is because of its fruit that the tree is given importance.

Now,  man  is  the  intelligent  being  of  the  universe  and  its  most  perfect 
fruit, result, and aim. Is it possible that the universe’s All-Wise Maker would 
give to others the praise and worship, and thanks and love, which are the 
fruits  of  its  intelligent  and  conscious  fruits,  thus  causing  His  self-evident 
wisdom to be nulliﬁed, His absolute power transformed into impotence, and 
His all-encompassing knowledge converted into ignorance? Allah forbid! A 
hundred thousand times!

Since intelligent beings are the pivot of the dominical aims in the palace 
of the universe, and man is the most eminent of intelligent beings, is it at all 
possible that the thanks and worship he offers in response to the bounties 
he receives should go to anyone other than the palace’s Maker, and that the 
Glorious Maker would permit the thanks and worship due to Him, which are 
the ultimate aim of man’s creation, to go to another?

TWENTIETH LETTER – SECOND STATION

Moreover,  is  it  at  all  possible  that  He  would  make  Himself  loved  by 
intelligent  beings  through  the  endless  varieties  of  His  bounties,  and  that 
He would make Himself known to them through the innumerable miracles 
of  His  art,  and  then,  attaching  no  importance  to  them,  abandon  to  causes 
and nature their thanks and worship, their praise and love, their recognition 
and gratitude. Is it at all possible that He would make His absolute wisdom 
denied and the sovereignty of His dominicality nulliﬁed? Allah forbid! A 
hundred thousand times, Allah forbid!

Is it at all possible that one who cannot create a spring, and cannot create 
all fruits, and cannot create all the apples on earth, the stamp on which is the 
same, could create one apple, which is a miniature specimen of all of them, 
and give it to someone to eat as a bounty? Is it possible that he should claim 
thanks for it and thus share in the praise due to the one absolutely deserving 
of praise? Allah forbid! For whoever creates one apple is he who creates all 
the apples produced in the whole world; for their stamp is the same.

Moreover, whoever creates all the apples is again the one who creates all 
the seeds and fruits in the world, which are the source of food. That is to say, 
the one who gives the tiniest bounty to the least signiﬁcant animate creature 
is directly the universe’s Creator and its Glorious Provider. Since this is so, 
thanks and praise are His directly. Since this is so, the reality of the universe 
declares unceasingly with the tongue of truth:

That is, it is He alone who gives life, in which case it is also He alone who 
creates all things. For life is the spirit, light, leaven, foundation, result, and 
summary of the universe, so whoever grants life must also be the universe’s 
Creator. It must be He who grants life, then, the Ever-Living and Self-Sub-
sistent One. We therefore point out as follows a mighty proof of this degree 
of the afﬁrmation of divine unity:

As  has  been  explained  and  proved  in  another  part  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r , 
we  see  before  us  the  magniﬁcent  army  of  animate  beings  with  their  tents 
pitched on the plain of the face of the earth. Every spring we behold a new 
army emerging from the World of the Unseen, freshly mobilized; one of the 
innumerable  armies  of  the  Ever-Living  and  Self-Subsistent  One.  Observ-
ing this army, we see within it more than two hundred thousand different 
nations from the plant families, and more than one hundred thousand from 

290

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

the animal tribes. Although the uniforms of each tribe and family, as well as 
their provisions, drill, discharge, arms, and period of service are all different, 
anyone who has eyes in his head will see, and having seen will be unable 
to deny, that a commander-in-chief provides all these different needs with 
perfect orderliness and precise balance at exactly the right time; and he does 
this through his inﬁnite power and wisdom, his boundless knowledge and 
will, his unending mercy, his inexhaustible treasuries, without forgetting a 
single one of them, or confusing or mixing-up or delaying any of them.

Is it at all possible, then, that anything could meddle, interfere, or have 
a share in this giving of life and administering, in this nurturing and sus-
taining, other than one who possesses knowledge comprehensive enough to 
encompass the army together with all of its affairs, and the absolute power 
to manage it in addition to providing all its necessities? Allah forbid! A hun-
dred thousand times!

It is obvious that if there are ten tribes in one battalion, impotent human 
beings  would  be  compelled  to  equip  them  in  a  single  fashion  because  to 
equip them all separately would be as difﬁcult as equipping ten battalions. 
The Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One, however, provides the equipment 
necessary  for  the  lives  of  the  more  than  three  hundred  thousand  different 
tribes  within  that  magniﬁcent  army.  And  He  does  this  with  no  trouble  or 
difﬁculty, in a light and easy manner, most wisely and maintaining orderli-

THE SEVENTH PHRASE:  ُت(cid:193) ِ(cid:175)ُ(cid:192)َو

It is He who causes death. That is, just as it is He who grants life, so it is 
again He who takes life and grants death. Indeed, death is not only destruc-
tion and extinction that it may be attributed to causes or nature. Just as a 
seed superﬁcially dies and rots while inside it a shoot is being kneaded and 
is coming to life, that is, it is passing from the particular life of a seed to the 
universal life of a shoot; so too, although death is apparently disintegration 
and banishment, in reality, for human beings it is the sign, introduction, and 
starting point of perpetual life. In which case, the Absolutely Powerful One 
who grants and administers life must certainly be the One who creates death. 
The following points to a mighty proof of this, the greatest degree of the 
afﬁrmation of divine unity, contained in this phrase.

TWENTIETH LETTER – SECOND STATION

291

As is explained in the Twenty-Fourth Window of the Thirty-Third Letter, 
through divine will, all beings are ﬂowing. At its Sustainer’s command, the 
universe is in continuous motion. With divine permission, all creatures are 
unceasingly ﬂowing in the river of time; they are being sent from the World 
of the Unseen; they are being clothed in external existence in the Manifest 
world; then they are being poured in orderly fashion into the World of the 
Unseen, and it is there that they alight. At their Sustainer’s command, they 
continuously come from the future, stop by in passing pausing for a breath, 
and are poured into the past.

This ﬂood of creatures is being made from top to bottom with instances 
of  wisdom,  beneﬁts,  results,  and  aims  within  the  sphere  of  a  most  wise 
mercy and muniﬁcence; as is this constant travelling, within the sphere of 
a most knowledgeable wisdom and orderliness; and this current, within the 
sphere of a most compassionate solicitude and equilibrium. That is to say, 
an All-Powerful One of Glory, an All-Wise One of Perfection, is continu-
ously giving life to and employing the families of beings, and the individu-
als within each family, and the worlds that those families form. Then, with 
His wisdom He discharges them, manifests death and despatches them to 
the World of the Unseen. He transfers them from the realm of power to the 
realm of knowledge.

Is it then at all possible that one who does not have the ability to admin-
ister the universe in its totality, whose authority does not stretch throughout 
time, whose power is not sufﬁcient to make the world manifest life and death 
like a single individual, who cannot bestow life on the spring as though it 
were a single ﬂower, attach it to the face of the earth and then pluck it from 
it with death and gather it up, could such a one be the owner of death and 
the  granter  of  death?  Yes,  the  death  of  the  lowliest  animate  being,  even, 
like  its  life,  must  necessarily  occur  according  to  the  law  of  the  Glorious 
One in whose hand are all the truths of life and varieties of death, and with 
His permission, and at His command, and through His power, and with His 
knowledge.

The Eighth Phrase

THE EIGHTH PHRASE:  ُتوُ(cid:175)َ(cid:192)  َ(cid:202)  ٌ

ّىَ(cid:110) َوُ(cid:182)َو
That is, His life is perpetual, it is pre-eternal and post-eternal. Death and 
evanescence,  non-existence  and  cessation,  cannot  befall  Him.  He  who  is 
pre-eternal must certainly be post-eternal. He who is sempiternal must cer-
tainly be eternally enduring. He who is necessarily existent, must certainly 
be without beginning or end. How could non-existence touch a life of which 

292

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

all existence, in all its varieties, is its shadow? Non-existence and ephemer-
ality and cessation could in no way encroach on a life through whose man-
ifestation  all  lives  continuously  come  into  being,  on  which  all  the  stable 
truths of the universe are dependent, and through which they subsist.

Yes, one ﬂash of that life’s manifestation accords a unity to the multiplic-
ity of things, all of which are subject to decline and decease, and makes them 
display permanence; it saves them from dispersal, preserves their existence, 
manifests in them a sort of continuance. That is, life accords a unity to mul-
tiplicity;  it  makes  it  permanent.  If  life  departs,  the  unity  disintegrates,  it 
ceases. Most certainly, ephemerality and transience cannot impinge on that 
necessary life, from a single manifestation of which all those innumerable 
ﬂashes of life proceed.

Decisive witnesses to this truth are the transience and ephemerality of the 
universe. That is, through their existence and lives, 1 beings bear witness to 
and point to the life of the Undying Ever-Living One and to the necessary 
existence of His life, and through their deaths and their ephemerality they 
bear witness to and point to the perpetuity of His life and its eternity. For the 
fact that on the demise of beings others follow on after them, manifesting 
life like them and taking their places, demonstrates that there is an unceas-
ingly living being who continuously renews life’s manifestation.

Bubbles on the surface of a ﬂowing river sparkle in the sun and disap-
pear. Troop after troop of bubbles appear, following on one after another. 
They display the same sparkle, are extinguished and vanish. Sparkling and 
being extinguished in this way, they point to the continuance of an elevated, 
enduring sun. Similarly, the alternation of life and death in these constantly 
moving  beings  testiﬁes  to  the  continuance  and  perpetualness  of  an  Ever-
Living Ever-Enduring One.

Yes, beings are mirrors. As darkness is the mirror to light, showing up 
the  light’s  brilliance  to  the  degree  of  its  intensity,  so  due  to  the  contrast 
of  opposites  beings  act  as  mirrors  in  many  respects.  For  example,  beings 
act  as  mirrors  to  the  Maker’s  power  through  their  impotence  and  to  His 
riches through their poverty; similarly, they act as mirrors to His everlast-
ingness through their ephemerality. Through their poverty in wintertime and 

1.   When  the  Prophet Abraham  ( Upon  whom  be  peace )  referred  the  subject  of  the 
rising and setting of the sun in his debate with Nimrod to life and death, * it was a transi-
tion and progress from a particular meaning of the giving of life and death to a universal 
meaning. It demonstrates the most illuminating and widest sphere of the proof, and does 
not, as some commentators on the Qur’an have asserted, abandon the hidden proof for the 
obvious one.

glittering  wealth  and  riches  in  springtime,  trees  and  the  face  of  the  earth 
act as mirrors in most unequivocal fashion to the power and mercy of an 
Absolutely Powerful One, a Possessor of Absolute Riches. It is as though all 
things are making supplication together with Uways al-Qarani through the 
tongues of their beings, and are saying:

The Ninth Phrase

All creatures, universal and particular, act as mirrors in a way that, like 
Uways  al-Qarani,  has  the  meaning  of  supplication.  All  proclaim  divine 
power and perfection through their impotence and poverty and deﬁciency.
THE NINTH PHRASE: ُرْ(cid:193)َ(cid:115)ْ(cid:170)ا ِه ِدَ(cid:193)ِ(cid:92)

That is to say, all good things are in His hand, all good deeds are in His 
account book, all beneﬁcence is in His treasury. Since this is so, those desir-
ing good must seek it from Him, those wishing for what is best must beseech 
Him. In order to demonstrate the truth of this phrase conclusively, we shall 
point out signs and ﬂashes from one of the many far-reaching evidences of 
divine knowledge, as follows:

294

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

The Maker who controls and creates with the acts that are apparent in 
the universe has all-encompassing knowledge, and such knowledge is His 
particular, inherent and necessary quality. Its separation from Him is impos-
sible. In the same way that it is not possible for the sun to exist but for its 
light not to exist, it is also not possible, though thousands of times more so, 
for the knowledge of the Being who creates these well-ordered beings to be 
separated from Him.

Such all-comprehending knowledge is necessary to that Being; it is also 
necessary to all things in so far as they are connected to Him. That is to say, 
it is not possible for anything to be hidden from Him. Just as it is not pos-
sible for objects on the face of the earth to face the sun with no barrier and 
not see it, so is it a thousand times less possible, it is impossible, for things 
to be hidden from the light of the All-Knowing One of Glory’s knowledge. 
For they are in his presence. That is, everything is within the range of His 
sight, is before Him, is within the compass of His witnessing; He penetrates 
into all things.

If  such  possessors  of  light  as  the  inanimate  sun,  impotent  man,  and 
unconscious  X-rays  can  see  and  penetrate  everything  that  faces  them 
although they are contingent, defective and accidental, surely nothing at all 
can remain hidden from or be beyond the light of pre-eternal knowledge, 
which is necessary, all-encompassing, and essential. The universe contains 
incalculable signs and marks pointing to this truth, as may be seen in the 
following examples:

All the instances of wisdom apparent in beings point to such knowledge. 
For He who performs His works kindly and graciously must know; He must 
know  what  He  is  doing.  And  all  well-ordered  beings,  each  with  balance, 
and  all  ﬁnely  balanced  and  measured  shapes  and  forms,  each  with  order, 
also indicate such all-encompassing knowledge. For to carry out work with 
wisdom means to do it with knowledge. And all favour and adornment point 
to such knowledge. For he who works skilfully and in a measured and bal-
anced way is surely relying on a powerful knowledge. And the regular meas-
uredness apparent in beings, their shapes cut out with a view to purposes 
and beneﬁts, and the fruitful situations and assemblages as though arranged 
according the principles of divine decree and the compasses of divine deter-
mining, all demonstrate an all-embracing knowledge. For sure, it is by virtue 
of all-encompassing knowledge that each thing is given an ordered, distinct 
form, as well as a particular shape that is appropriate and beneﬁcial to its life 
and existence; it could not occur any other way.

TWENTIETH LETTER – SECOND STATION

295

Also, it is only through all-embracing knowledge that the sustenance of 
animate  creatures  is  provided  in  a  suitable  form,  at  the  appropriate  time, 
from unexpected places. Because, since the One who sends the sustenance 
knows and recognizes those who are in need of it, and the appropriate time 
to send it, and perceives their need, He is able to provide their sustenance in 
a suitable form.

Also, although it is not clear to the creatures themselves, the appointed 
hour of their deaths, which is tied to a law of determination, demonstrates 
a  comprehensive  knowledge.  For  although  its  time  does  not  appear  to  be 
determined,  the  death  of  all  groups  and  individuals  is  appointed  within  a 
period of time with a beginning and an end. The fact that the seeds, fruits 
and results of a thing are preserved at the time of death, since they will con-
tinue its duties after it and are the means of its transformation into a new life, 
demonstrates an all-encompassing knowledge.

Also, mercy’s benevolence, which encompasses all beings and is in a 
form  appropriate  to  each,  demonstrates  all-embracing  knowledge  within 
vast mercy. For the One who feeds the offspring of animate creatures with 
milk, for example, and assists the plants of the earth needy for water with 
rain, most certainly knows the young and their needs, and sees the plants, 
perceives how necessary rain is for them and then sends it; and so on. All 
the  manifestations  of  wise  kindly  mercy  demonstrate  all-comprehensive 
knowledge.

Also, the care and attention, the artistic fashioning and skilful decoration 
and  art  in  all  things  demonstrate  all-embracing  knowledge.  For  it  is  only 
through a profound knowledge that an orderly, adorned, artistic, and pur-
poseful state can be chosen from among thousands of possible states. The 
choice apparent in all beings demonstrates all-encompassing knowledge.

Also, the total ease in the creation and origination of things points to per-
fect knowledge. For the facility in achieving a certain situation is commen-
surate with the degree of knowledge and skill. However well it is known, it 
will be achieved with that degree of ease. Thus, we see that beings, every 
one of which is a miracle of art, are created easily, without trouble or con-
fusion,  in  a  short  period  of  time,  in  a  wondrous,  yet  miraculous,  fashion. 
That is to say, there is inﬁnite knowledge, since it ﬁnds expression through 
inﬁnite ease; and so on.

There are thousands of veracious signs like those mentioned in the exam-
ples above indicating that the Being who has free disposal over the universe 
possesses all-encompassing knowledge; that He knows all the attributes of 

296

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

all beings, then he acts. Since the universe’s Owner has such a knowledge, 
He surely sees human beings and their actions, and He knows what human 
beings deserve and what is appropriate for them. And He deals with them 
and will deal with them in accordance with the requirements of wisdom 
and mercy.

O man! Come to your senses! Think carefully of just what sort of Being 
it is who knows you and watches you; think of it and pull yourself together!
I f   i t   i s   a s k e d :  Knowledge alone is not sufﬁcient; will is also necessary. If 

there were no will, knowledge would be insufﬁcient, wouldn’t it?

T h e   A n s w e r :   All  beings  both  indicate  and  testify  to  all-encompassing 
knowledge, and they point to the comprehensive will of the one possessing 
that knowledge. It is as follows:

While hesitating among great numbers of possibilities, an ordered indi-
viduality is given to all things, especially to animate beings, through a deter-
mined  probability  from  among  a  great  host  of  muddled  probabilities,  and 
through  a  productive  way  from  among  a  great  many  fruitless  ways.  This 
demonstrates a universal will of many facets.

Measured shapes and well-ordered identities have been given to all things 
in a most sensitive, delicate measure and with a most ﬁne and subtle order. 
They have been given these from among the inanimate elements which ﬂow 
without balance in confused, monotonous ﬂoods, and from among the bar-
ren,  fruitless  paths  and  endless  possibilities  that  surround  all  beings.  This 
necessarily  and  self-evidently  demonstrates  that  they  are  the  works  of  a 
comprehensive will. For choosing innumerable states occurs by means of a 
designation, a choice, a purpose, and a will. Deliberate intention and desire 
specify them. Specifying requires a speciﬁer and choice requires a chooser. 
And that speciﬁer and chooser is will.

For example, the creation of a being like man, who resembles a machine 
assembled from hundreds of different components and systems, from a drop 
of water; and the creation of a bird with its hundreds of different members 
out of a simple egg; and the creation of a tree, which is separated into hun-
dreds of different parts, out of a simple seed – the creation of these testify to 
power and knowledge, just as they indicate decisively and necessarily their 
Maker’s  universal  will.  And  with  that  will  He  gives  a  distinct,  particular 
shape to every component, every member, every part. He clothes them in a 
chosen state.

TWENTIETH LETTER – SECOND STATION

In Short: Just as there are between different things many resemblances 
and  coincidences  with  regard  to  their  essentials  and  results,  for  example, 
between the major members and organs of animals’ bodies, and they display 
a single stamp of unity, indicating decisively that all animals have the same 
Maker who is One, Single, and possesses Unity; so too the different identi-
ties and distinct features of the animals, all determined in accordance with 
wisdom and purpose, shows that their Single Maker acts with choice and 
will. He does what He wishes to do, He does not do what He does not wish 
to do; He acts with intention and will.

There  are  as  many  indications  of  and  attestations  to  divine  knowledge 
and dominical will as there are beings, indeed as the beings’ attributes and 
qualities.  Therefore,  some  philosophers  denying  divine  will,  and  some  of 
those who favour innovation denying divine determining, and some of the 
people of misguidance claiming that Allah is not concerned with minor mat-
ters,  and  the  naturalists  attributing  some  things  to  nature  and  causes,  are 
lies multiplied to the number of beings and a lunacy of misguidance com-
pounded to the number of those beings’ attributes. For whoever denies the 
innumerable instances of their veracious witnessing is telling a lie of inﬁnite 
proportions.

So, you can see for yourself just how mistaken and contrary to the truth 
it is to say of events, all of which come into existence through divine will, 
“ Naturally, naturally, ” instead of, “ Allah willing, Allah willing. ”

That  is  to  say,  absolutely  nothing  at  all  is  difﬁcult  for  Him.  However 
many things there are in the sphere of contingency, He is able to clothe all of

As soon as a skilful artist puts his hand to his work, it functions smoothly 
like a machine. One could say in order to express his speed and skill, that 
the work of art is so closely under his control that it is as if at his command, 
at  his  touch,  the  pieces  appear,  the  works  of  art  come  into  existence.  In 
the same way, the verse states: Å Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ 
alluding to the absolute subjugation and obedience of all things to the power 

298

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

of the All-Powerful One of Glory, and the absolute ease and lack of trouble 
with which His power functions. We shall elucidate in ﬁve points ﬁve of the 
innumerable mysteries contained in this mighty truth.

The First

The First

In relation to divine power the greatest thing is as easy as the smallest. 
The creation of a species with all of its members is as easy and trouble-free 
as  the  creation  of  a  single  member.  It  is  as  easy  to  create  Paradise  as  the 
spring and it is as easy to create the spring as a ﬂower.

This mystery has been explained and proved with the six comparisons 
– the Mystery of Luminosity, the Mystery of Transparency, the Mystery of 
Reciprocity, the Mystery of Balance, the Mystery of Order, the Mystery of 
Obedience, and the Mystery of Disengagedness – at the end of the Tenth 
Word, which is about the resurrection of the dead, and in the discussion also 
about the resurrection in the Second Aim of the Twenty-Ninth Word, which 
is about the angels, the immortality of man’s spirit, and the resurrection. It 
has been demonstrated in these that in relation to divine power the stars are 
as easy as atoms and that innumerable individuals are created as easily as 
one individual. Since these mysteries have been proved in those two Wo r d s , 
we refer you to them and cut short the discussion here.

The Second

The Second

A  decisive,  self-evident  proof  that  everything  is  equal  in  relation  to 
divine power is this: we see with our own eyes in the creation of animals 
and plants the highest degree of mastery and exquisiteness of art despite the 
inﬁnite multiplicity and liberality; and the greatest distinction and differen-
tiation within the utmost confusion and intermingling; and the highest worth 
as  regards  art  and  supreme  beauty  as  regards  creation  within  the  greatest 
abundance and profusion. While needing much equipment and much time, 
they are created with the utmost ease and speed with the greatest art. Simply, 
those miracles of art come into existence suddenly and out of nothing.

Thus, by observing this activity of power every season on the face of the 
earth, we see that it establishes irrefutably that the greatest thing is as easy as 
the smallest in relation to the power that is the source of those actions, and 
that the creation and administration of innumerable individuals is as easy as 
the creation and administration of a single individual.

TWENTIETH LETTER – SECOND STATION

299

The Third

The Third

The vastest whole is as easy as the smallest part in relation to the power 
of the All-Powerful Maker who rules in the universe with actions, direction, 
and disposal that are clearly to be seen. The creation of a universal consist-
ing  of  a  multiplicity  of  individuals  is  as  easy  as  the  creation  of  a  single 
particular, and in an insigniﬁcant particular, art of the highest worth may be 
displayed. This mystery and the wisdom in it arise from three sources:

The First Source

F i r s t l y :  from the assistance of unity ( v â h i d i y e t  ).
S e c o n d l y :  from the facility of unity ( v a h d e t  ).
T h i r d l y :  from the manifestation of oneness ( e h a d i y e t  ).
The Assistance of Unity, which is the ﬁrst source: That is, if all things 
are the property of a single being, then as a result of unity, he can concen-
trate the power of all things behind any single thing and all can be adminis-
tered as easily as one thing. We shall explain this mystery with a comparison 
in order to make it easier to understand:

For  example,  if  a  country  has  a  single  ruler,  by  reason  of  the  law  of 
his  sole  sovereignty  ( v a h d e t - i   s a l t a n a t  ),  he  is  able  to  mobilize  the  moral 
strength of the whole army behind every single soldier. And because he is 
able to do this, a single soldier is able to capture a king and have command 
over him in the name of his monarch. Furthermore, just as the monarch may 
employ  and  direct  a  single  soldier  and  a  single  ofﬁcial,  by  reason  of  the 
mystery of sole sovereignty, he is able to direct the whole army and all his 
ofﬁcials. It is as if, by reason of the mystery of sole sovereignty, he is able to 
send everyone, everything, to the assistance of one individual. 

Every single individual, therefore, will rely on the combined strength of 
all the individuals; that is, each will receive assistance from all. If the rope of 
sole sovereignty were to be unfastened and they become irregular soldiers, 
then each soldier, suddenly losing a boundless strength, would fall from a 
high position of inﬂuence to that of a common man. And to command and 
employ them would beget difﬁculties to the number of individuals.

In  exactly  the  same  way,  ( 16:60 )   j  i  h  since  the  universe’s 
Maker  is  One,  He  assembles  His  names,  which  look  to  all  things,  before 
each single thing, and He creates with inﬁnite art, in a valuable way. If there 
is need for it, He looks to a single thing by means of all things, He causes 
them to look to it; He gives assistance and strengthens it. Also, by reason 
of the mystery of unity, He creates, disposes, and administers all things as 
though they were a single thing.

300

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

It is due to the mystery of this assistance of unity that in the universe a 
certain quality is apparent which is exalted and sublime to the utmost degree 
as regards its art and value, and this within the utmost abundance and profu-
sion.

The Second Source

The  Facility  of  Unity,  which  is  the  second  source:  that  is,  matters 
which  occur  according  to  the  principles  of  unity,  in  one  centre,  from  one 
hand,  according  to  one  law,  occur  with  the  greatest  ease.  If  they  are  dis-
tributed among numerous centres, numerous laws, and numerous hands, it 
engenders difﬁculties.

For  example,  if  the  equipment  of  all  the  soldiers  of  an  army  is  manu-
factured  in  one  centre,  according  to  one  law,  and  at  the  command  of  one 
commander-in-chief, it is as easy as equipping one soldier. If on the other 
hand, all their equipment is made in different factories, in different centres, 
then all the military factories necessary to equip an army are necessary to 
equip one soldier. That is to say, if unity is relied upon, an army is as easy 
as a single soldier. Whereas, if there is no unity, as many difﬁculties arise in 
equipping one soldier as in equipping an army.

Furthermore, if with regard to unity, the elements necessary for life are 
given to a tree’s fruits, relying on one centre, one law, and one root, thou-
sands of fruits are as easy as a single fruit. If, on the other hand, each fruit 
is bound to a different centre and all their vital necessities are sent to them 
separately, each fruit will give rise to as many difﬁculties as the whole tree. 
For the elements necessary for the life of the whole tree will be necessary 
for each fruit.

Thus, like these two comparisons,  ( 16:60 )  j  i  h because the 
universe’s Maker is the Single One of Unity, He acts with unity ( v a h d e t  ), 
and because He acts with unity all things are as easy as one thing. Moreover, 
He is able to make a single thing as valuable as all things as regards its art. 
And  creating  innumerable  individuals  in  a  most  valuable  form,  He  dem-
onstrates absolute liberality through the tongue of the limitless abundance 
and endless profusion of beings, and He manifests boundless generosity and 
inﬁnite creativity.

The Third Source

The Manifestation of Oneness, which is the third source: that is, since 
the All-Glorious Maker is not physical or corporeal, time and space cannot 
restrict Him, creation and place cannot obtrude on His presence and witness-
ing, means and mass cannot veil His actions. There is no fragmentation or 
division in His regarding and acting towards creation. One thing cannot be 
an obstacle to another. He performs innumerable acts as though they were 

TWENTIETH LETTER – SECOND STATION

301

a single act. For this reason, in the same way that, as far as its meaning is 
concerned, a huge tree can be encapsulated in a seed, a world also can be 
contained  within  a  single  individual,  and  the  whole  world  can  be  encom-
passed by the Hand of Power.

We have explained this mystery in others of the Wo r d s  like this: the sun 
is  to  an  extent  unrestricted  with  regard  to  its  luminosity,  so  its  image  is 
reﬂected in every burnished and shining object. If thousands and millions 
of mirrors are exposed to its light, the manifestation of its likeness will be 
found  in  each  one  of  them  without  being  divided.  If  the  capacities  of  the 
mirrors are such, the sun will be able to demonstrate its effects in them in all 
their magnitude. One thing will not be an obstacle to another. Thousands of 
things will enter thousands of places with the ease of one thing entering one 
place. Each place will display the sun’s manifestation as much as thousands 
of places display it.

Thus,  ( 16:60 )   j  i  h  the  manifestation  of  the  universe’s  All-
Glorious Maker is such, with all His attributes which are light and with all 
His names which are luminous, that through the mystery of the regard of 
oneness, although He is not in any place, He is all-present and all-seeing in 
all places. There is no division in His regarding and acting 
towards the creation. He performs every task at the same time, in all places, 
without difﬁculty, without hindrance. 

Thus, it is through these mysteries of the assistance of unity, facility of 
unity, and manifestation of oneness, that when all beings are attributed to a 
single Maker, the creation of all of them becomes as simple and easy as that 
of a single being. And each being can be as valuable as all beings as regards 
the ﬁneness of its art. This truth is demonstrated by there being within the 
boundless plenitude of beings endless subtleties of art in every one of them. 
If the beings are not attributed directly to a single Maker, each becomes as 
problematical as all beings and the value of all of them decreases, it falls to 
that of a single being. If it were the case, either nothing would come into 
existence, or if it did, it would be without value, worthless.

This mystery led the Sophists, who were the most advanced philosophers, 
to realize that the path of associating partners with Allah was inﬁnitely more 
difﬁcult than the way of truth and path of afﬁrming divine unity; that it was 
irrational to the utmost degree. So because they had averted their faces from 
the way of truth and looked to that of unbelief and misguidance, they were 
compelled to renounce their reasons and deny the existence of everything.

The creation of Paradise is as easy as that of the spring in relation to the 
All-Powerful One’s power, who administers the universe with acts that are 
plain to see. The creation of spring is as easy as that of a ﬂower. The loveli-
ness of a ﬂower’s art and the ﬁneness in its creation may be as beautiful and 
valuable as the spring. The mystery of this truth is threefold:
F i r s t :  the necessity and total detachment of the Maker.
S e c o n d :  the complete otherness of His essence and His unrestrictedness.
T h i r d :  His not being bound by space and His indivisibility.
F i r s t   M y s t e r y :  The fact that necessity and total detachment give rise to 
inﬁnite ease and facility is an extremely profound mystery. We shall facili-
tate understanding of it with the following comparison:

First Mystery

The degrees of existence are different. And the worlds of existence are 
all different. Because they are all different, a particle from a level of exist-
ence that is deeply rooted in existence is as great as a mountain from a less 
substantial level; it contains the mountain. 

For example, the faculty of memory, which is the size of a mustard-seed 
in a head from the Manifest World, takes on an existence the size of a library 
from the World of Meaning. And a mirror the size of a ﬁngernail from the 
external world encompasses a mighty city from the level of the World of 
Similitudes. If the memory and the mirror from the external world had pos-
sessed  consciousness  and  creative  power,  they  would  have  been  able  to 
bring about endless transformations and activity in the Worlds of Meaning 
and Similitudes through the power of their minute existences in the external 
world. That is to say, when existence is ﬁrmly established, power increases; 
what is only a little becomes much. Especially if having acquired complete 
stability existence is disengaged and detached from materiality and is not 
restricted, only a partial manifestation of it will be able to transform many 
worlds of other less substantial levels of existence.

Thus,  ( 16:60 )  j  i  h the universe’s Glorious Maker is Neces-
sarily Existent. That is, His existence is essential, it is pre-eternal and post-
eternal, its non-existence is impossible, its cessation is impossible; it is the 
most ﬁrmly rooted, the most sound, the strongest, and the most perfect of the 
levels of existence. In relation to His existence, the other levels of existence 
are like extremely pale shadows. 

The  degree  of  Necessary  Existence  is  so  stable  and  real,  and  contin-
gent  existence  is  so  insubstantial  and  pale  that  many  of  those  who  have 

TWENTIETH LETTER – SECOND STATION

303

investigated  creation,  such  as  Muhyi  al-Din  al-‘Arabi,  have  relegated  the 
other levels of existence to the level of delusion and imagination; they said: 
َوُ(cid:182)  َ
ّ(cid:202)ِا َدوُ(cid:106)ْوَ(cid:174)  َ(cid:202) That is, things should not be ascribed existence relatively to 
the Necessary Existence. They asserted that they do not deserve to be called 
existent.

Thus,  for  the  Necessarily  Existent  One’s  power,  which  is  both  neces-
sary and essential, contingent beings’ both created and accidental existences 
and both unstable and powerless realities are inﬁnitely easy and simple. To 
raise all human beings to life and then judge them at the Great Gathering is 
as easy as resurrecting leaves, ﬂowers and fruits in the spring, indeed, in a 
garden, or on a tree.

Second Mystery

S e c o n d   M y s t e r y :   Easiness  in  regard  to  the  complete  otherness  of  His 
Essence and His unrestrictedness arises from this: most certainly, the uni-
verse’s Maker is not of the same kind as the universe. His Essence resembles 
no other essence at all. Since this is so, the obstacles and restraints within the 
sphere of the universe cannot hinder Him, they cannot restrict His actions. 
He has complete disposal over the universe and is able to transform all of it 
at the same time. If the disposal and actions that are apparent in the universe 
were to be attributed to it, it would cause so many difﬁculties and such con-
fusion that neither would any order remain nor would anything continue to 
exist; indeed, nothing would ever come into existence.

For  example,  if  the  masterly  art  in  vaulted  domes  is  attributed  to  the 
stones  of  the  domes,  and  if  the  command  of  a  battalion,  which  properly 
belongs  to  its  ofﬁcer,  is  left  to  the  soldiers,  either  neither  of  them  would 
ever come into existence, or with great difﬁculty and confusion they would 
achieve a state completely lacking in order. Whereas, if in order for the situ-
ation of the stones in the dome to be achieved, it is accorded to a master who 
is not a stone himself, and if the command of the soldiers in the regiment is 
referred to an ofﬁcer who possesses the essential quality of ofﬁcership, both 
the art is easy and the command and organization are easy. This is because, 
while the stones and the soldiers are obstacles to each other, the master and 
the ofﬁcer can look from every angle, they command without obstacle.

Thus,  ( 16:60 )   j  i  h  the  sacred  Essence  of  the  Necessarily 
Existent One is not of the same kind as contingent beings’ essences. All the 
truths of the universe are rays from the name of Truth, which is one of the 
Beautiful Names of His Essence. Since His sacred Essence is Necessarily 
Existent  and  completely  detached  from  materiality  and  different  from  all 

304

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

other essences, it has no like, no equivalent, no equal. So, most certainly, the 
administration and sustaining of the universe is as easy for that All-Glorious 
One’s pre-eternal power as that of the spring, indeed, of a tree; and the crea-
tion of the resurrection of the dead, the realm of the hereafter, and Heaven 
and Hell, is as easy as the resurrection in spring of a tree which had died the 
previous autumn.

Third Mystery

T h i r d   M y s t e r y :  The fact that indivisibility and not being bound by space 
result in the utmost facility has this meaning: since the All-Powerful Maker 
is free of the restrictions of space, He may be thought of as being present 
everywhere through His power. And since there is no division or fragmenta-
tion in regard to His Essence, He can regard and act towards all things with 
all of His names. And since He is present everywhere and acts towards eve-
rything, beings and intermediaries and mass cannot hinder and prevent His 
actions, indeed there is no necessity for them to do so.

Let us suppose there was some necessity, then things like electric wires, 
the  branches  of  trees,  and  veins  in  human  beings,  would  resemble  means 
of facilitation, of the arrival of life, and of swiftness in actions. So, let us 
ignore  the  idea  of  hindering,  restricting,  preventing,  and  intervening,  and 
say  that  they  are  means  of  facilitating,  expediting,  and  uniting.  That  is  to 
say, from the point of view of the obedience and submission of all things to 
the domination of the All-Powerful and Glorious One’s power, there is no 
need for them. If there were some need for them, it would be as a means of 
facilitating.

I n   S h o r t :  The All-Powerful Maker creates everything in an appropriate 
form without trouble, without undergoing any process, swiftly and easily. 
He creates universals as easily as particulars. He creates particulars as full of 
art as He does universals. Indeed, whoever creates universals and the heav-
ens and the earth must necessarily be the one who creates the particulars and 
animate individuals contained in the heavens and earth; it could be nothing 
other than him. For those tiny particulars are the fruits, seeds, and the mini-
ature specimens of universals.

Furthermore, whoever creates the particulars must also be the one who 
creates the elements and heavens and earth, which encompass the particu-
lars. For we see that particulars are each like a seed and tiny copy in relation 
to universals. Since this is so, the universal elements and the heavens and 
earth must be in the hand of the One who creates those particulars so that, 
according to the principles of His wisdom and the balances of His knowl-
edge, He can insert the gist, the meanings, the samples, of those universal 

TWENTIETH LETTER – SECOND STATION

305

and all-encompassing beings in those particulars, which are like their mini-
ature specimens.

Indeed, from the point of view of the wonders of art and marvels of crea-
tiveness particulars are not behind universals; neither are ﬂowers lower than 
the stars, nor seeds inferior to trees. Indeed, the tree’s meaning, which is the 
inscription of divine determining and is in the seed, is more wonderful than 
the physical tree, which is the weaving of divine power and is in the garden. 
And the creation of man is more wonderful than the creation of the universe. 
If a Qur’an of Wisdom were to be written in particles of ether on an atom, it 
would far surpass in value a Qur’an of Grandeur written in stars on the face 
of the heavens. Similarly, there are minute particulars that are superior to 
universals as regards the miraculousness of their art. 

The Fifth

We have demonstrated to an extent in our explanations above, the inﬁnite 
ease,  utmost  speed,  extreme  swiftnesss  of  actions,  and  boundless  facility 
apparent in the creation of beings, together with the mysteries and instances 
of wisdom in their creation. The existence of things with this utmost speed 
and utter facility, therefore, has given the people of guidance the following 
ﬁrm conviction, that in relation to the power of the One who creates beings, 
Paradises are as easy as the spring, the spring as easy as gardens, and gar-
dens as easy as ﬂowers.

According to the meaning of,

( 31:28 ) â á à ß Þ Ý Ü
the resurrection of all humankind is as easy as causing one person to die and 
raising him to life again. And according to the explicit statement of,

( 36:53 ) Ò Ñ Ð Ï Î Í Ì Ë Ê É
to  raise  to  life  all  human  beings  at  the  resurrection  is  as  easy  as  calling 
together with the sound of a bugle an army that has dispersed to rest.

Although this inﬁnite speed and boundless ease are decisive proofs and 
certain arguments for the self-evident perfection of the Maker’s power and 
for everything being easy for Him, in the view of the people of misguidance, 
the formation and creation of things by that power, which is so easy as to 
be necessary, gave rise to the notion that things form themselves, which is 
utterly impossible, and thus became the cause of confusion. That is to say, 
because they see that some ordinary things come into existence very easily, 

306

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

they imagine that they are formed spontaneously. That is, they are not cre-
ated, but come into existence of their own accord.

There,  look  at  this  sheer  stupidity!  The  people  of  misguidance  make 
what is the proof of an absolute power, the proof of its non-existence; they 
open the door to innumerable impossibilities. For if it were the case, such 
attributes of perfection as inﬁnite power and all-encompassing knowledge, 
which are necessary to the Maker of the universe, would have to be ascribed 
to every particle of every creature so that each could form itself.

The Eleventh Phrase

THE ELEVENTH PHRASE: ُر(cid:193) ِ(cid:135) َ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)ا ِهْ(cid:193)َ(cid:170)ِاَو

That is to say, everything will return to the realm of permanence from 
the transient realm, and will go to the seat of the Sempiternal Ever-Enduring 
One’s post-eternal sovereignty. They will go from the multiplicity of causes 
to the domain of the All-Glorious One of Unity’s power, and will be trans-
ferred from this world to the hereafter. Your place of recourse is His Court, 
therefore, and your place of refuge, His mercy. And so on.

There are a great many truths which this phrase and those like it state. 
One  is  that  you  will  return  to  eternal  bliss  and  Paradise.  This  has  been 
proved  so  decisively  by  the  irrefutable  certainty  of  the  twelve  arguments 
of the Tenth Word, and by the six “ Principles ” that comprise the numerous 
cogent proofs of the Twenty-Ninth Word, that they leave no need for further 
explanation. Those two Wo r d s  have proved with the certainty of the sun ris-
ing in the following morning after having set the previous day, that life too, 
which has the meaning of the sun in this world, will rise in an eternal form 
in the morning of the resurrection after its setting with the destruction of the 
world. Since the Tenth and Twenty-Ninth Wo r d s  have proved this truth to 
perfection, we refer you to them and here only say this:

Further  to  what  has  been  proved  decisively  above,  the  universe’s  All-
Wise Maker, who possesses boundless all-embracing power, limitless uni-
versal will, and inﬁnite all-encompassing knowlege – the all-Merciful Crea-
tor of human beings – has promised in all His heavenly books and decrees 
Paradise and eternal bliss to those of mankind who believe in Him. Since He 
has promised, He will most certainly bring it about, for it is impossible for 
Him to break His promise. Also, not to carry out a promise is an extremely 
ugly  fault,  and  the  One  of  Absolute  Perfection  is  totally  exempt  and  free 
from all fault. Failure to fulﬁl a promise arises either from ignorance or from 
impotence. However, since it is impossible for ignorance or impotence to be

ascribed in any way to that Absolutely Powerful One, the One Knowing of 
All Things, His breaking of a promise is impossible.

Moreover, ﬁrst and foremost the Pride of the Worlds ( Upon whom be 
blessings  and  peace ),  and  all  the  prophets,  saints,  puriﬁed  scholars,  and 
people of belief, continuously request and implore, desire and beseech the 
All-Generous and Compassionate One for the eternal bliss they have been 
promised. They beseech it through all His Most Beautiful Names. For fore-
most  His  compassion  and  mercy,  and  justice  and  wisdom,  His  names  of 
All-Merciful and Compassionate, and All-Just and Wise, and His domini-
cality and sovereignty, and most of His names including Lord and Sustainer 
( R a b b  )  and  Allah,  require  and  necessitate  the  realm  of  the  hereafter  and 
eternal  happiness,  and  they  testify  and  point  to  its  realization.  Indeed,  all 
beings with all of their truths point to the hereafter.

The  All-Wise  Qur’an,  the  greatest  of  the  revealed  books,  also  demon-
strates  and  teaches  this  truth  with  thousands  of  its  verses;  with  clear  evi-
dences and conclusive, veracious proofs.

The  Most  Noble  Beloved  One,  too,  who  is  the  cause  of  pride  for  the 
human  race,  relying  on  thousands  of  dazzling  miracles  taught  this  truth 
throughout his life, with all his strength; he proved it, proclaimed it, saw it, 
and demonstrated it.

Q u e s t i o n :   You  have  said  in  many  places  that  in  divine  unity  there  is 
an inﬁnite facility and in multiplicity and associating partners with Allah, 
endless difﬁculties; that there is such ease in divine unity that it is neces-
sary and such difﬁculty in associating partners with Allah that it is impos-
sible. Whereas, the difﬁculties and impossibilities that you demonstrate are 
also present with unity. For example, you say that if particles were not ofﬁ-
cials, it would be necessary for either all-encompassing knowledge or abso-
lute power or innumerable immaterial machines and printing-presses to be 
present in every particle. This of course is completely impossible. Even if 
those particles were divine ofﬁcials, it would still be necessary for them to 
bear the same qualities so that they would be able to accomplish their end-
less orderly duties. Could you unravel this problem for me?

T h e   A n s w e r :  We have expounded and proved in many Wo r d s  that if all 
beings are attributed to a single Maker, they become as easy and effortless 
as a single being. If they are attributed to numerous causes and to nature, a 
single ﬂy becomes as difﬁcult and arduous as the heavens, a ﬂower as the 
spring, a fruit as a garden. Since this mattter has been proved in other Wo r d s , 
we refer you to them and here only explain three comparisons, by means of 
three indications, which will reassure the soul and set the mind at rest in the 
face of that truth.

First Comparison

First Comparison: For example, a tiny transparent glistening speck can-
not of its own accord situate itself within a light the size of a match-head 

308

TWENTIETH LETTER – ADDENDUM TO THE TENTH PHRASE

309

even, and neither can it be the source of it. It is able to have as much light, 
in its own right, as a tiny particle, in accordance with its capacity and to the 
extent of its own mass. But if the speck is connected to the sun, if it opens its 
eyes and looks at it, it will be able to comprehend the immense sun together 
with its light, seven colours, heat, and even its distance; it will display a sort 
of greater manifestation. That is to say, if the particle remains on its own, it 
will be able to perform a function only to the extent of a particle, whereas if 
it is deemed to be an ofﬁcial of the sun, and is connected to it and is a mir-
ror to it, it will be able to demonstrate certain partial examples of the sun’s 
functioning, the same as the sun itself. 

Thus,  ( 16:60 )  j  i  h  if  all  beings,  all  particles,  are  attributed 
to multiplicity, causes, nature, themselves, or to anything other than Allah, 
then each of them must either possess all-embracing knowledge and abso-
lute power, or innumerable immaterial machines and printing-presses must 
take form within each, so that it can carry out its wonderful duties. However, 
if the particles are attributed to the Single One of Unity, each of them, each 
artefact, becomes connected to Him; it is as though each becomes His ofﬁ-
cial. Its connection allows it to display His manifestation. And through this 
connection and state of being a manifestation, it relies on an inﬁnite knowl-
edge and power. Thus, by reason of the mystery of the connection and its 
reliance, it performs functions and duties far beyond its own power, through 
the power of its Creator.

Second Comparison

Second Comparison: For example, there were two brothers, one brave 
and self-reliant, the other patriotic and devoted to his country. When a war 
broke out, the one who relied on himself did not form any connection with 
the state; he wanted to perform his service on his own. He was compelled 
therefore to carry his own sources of power, and to transport, as far as his 
strength  allowed,  his  equipment  and  ammunition.  In  accordance  with  his 
petty individual strength, he was only able to ﬁght with one corporal of the 
enemy army; to do more was beyond him. 

The other brother did not rely on himself; he knew himself to be weak 
and powerless so established a connection with the king and was enrolled in 
the army. Through this connection, the huge army became a source of sup-
port for him. And because of this support, he was plunged into war with the 
moral strength of an army behind him under the auspices of the king. When 
he  encountered  an  eminent  ﬁeld  marshal  of  the  defeated  enemy  army’s 
king, he declared in the name of his own king: “ I take you prisoner! Quick 
march! ” He captured him and handed him over. The meaning of this situa-
tion and the wisdom in it is this:

310

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

Since the ﬁrst, independent, man, was compelled to carry his equipment 
and  sources  of  strength  himself,  the  service  he  was  able  to  perform  was 
extremely insigniﬁcant. Whereas the one who was an ofﬁcial did not have to 
carry his source of strength; indeed, the army and the king carried him. Just 
like connecting his receiver to existing telegraph and telephone lines with a 
tiny wire, the man, through the connection he formed, connected himself to 
an inﬁnite power.

Thus, ( 16:60 )  j  i  h if all creatures, all particles, are attributed 
directly to the Single One of Unity and if they are connected to Him, through 
the power of the connection and through of its Lord, at His command, an 
ant can demolish the Pharaoh’s palace; a ﬂy can kill off Nimrod and consign 
him to Hell; a germ can despatch an iniquitous tyrant to the grave; a seed 
the size of a wheat grain becomes the workshop and machinery for produc-
ing a pine tree the size of a mountain; and a particle of air is able to operate 
efﬁciently and systematically in the different functions and structures of all 
ﬂowers  and  fruits.  All  this  ease  and  facility  self-evidently  arise  from  the 
connection and state of being an ofﬁcial. If the being in question reverts to 
independence, if it is left to causes, multiplicity, and to itself, if it travels the 
road of associating partners with Allah, then the service it will be able to 
perform will be only to the extent of its physical entity and to the degree of 
its consciousness.

Third Comparison

Third Comparison: For example, there were two friends who wanted to 
write a geographical and statistical work on a country they had never seen. 
One of them formed a connection with the king and entered the telegraph 
and telephone ofﬁce. With a piece of wire worth a few kurush, he connected 
his telephone receiver to the state lines and was able to communicate with 
everywhere  and  receive  information.  He  wrote  a  perfectly  composed  and 
well-arranged work of geography and statistics. As for the other man, either 
he would have had to travel continuously for ﬁfty years and see everywhere 
and learn of every event with great difﬁculty, or else, spending millions of 
liras he would have had to become the owner, like the king, of a telegraph 
and telephone system as extensive as that of the state so that he could write 
a perfect work like his friend.

Similarly, ( 16:60 )  j  i  h if innumerable things and creatures are 
attributed to the Single One of Unity, through the connection each becomes 
a place of manifestation. By displaying the manifestation of the Pre-Eternal 
Sun, it acquires a connection with the laws of His wisdom, the principles of 

TWENTIETH LETTER – ADDENDUM TO THE TENTH PHRASE

311

his knowledge, and the decrees of His power. Then, through divine strength 
and power, it displays such a dominical manifestation that it acquires an eye 
that sees all things, a face that looks to all places, and words that have weight 
in all matters. If the connection is severed, the thing will also be cut off from 
everything else, it will be squeezed into the smallness of its own bulk. In 
which case, it would have to possess absolute divinity so that it could per-
form the functions described above.

In Short: The easiness and facility on the way of divine unity and belief 
make it necessary, while the difﬁculties on the way of causes and assigning 
partners to Allah make it impossible. For one person may, without trouble, 
put numerous objects into a single situation and obtain one result. But if it 
is left to the objects themselves to bring about the situation and obtain the 
result, they could do so only with great trouble and much activity.

For example, as is stated in the Third Letter, every night, every year, a 
glittering expedition and passage glorifying Allah is accomplished through 
setting in motion the army of the stars in the ﬁeld of the heavens under the 
command of the sun and the moon. This is the alluring and captivating situ-
ation of the heavens. The alternation of the seasons and other momentous 
affairs are brought about; and this is the exalted and purposeful result of the 
motion of the earth. If the situation of the heavens and result of the revolv-
ing earth are ascribed to divine unity, the Pre-Eternal Monarch may easily 
appoint a soldier like the globe of the earth as commander of the heavenly 
bodies for the situation and the result to be achieved. After it has received its 
order, the earth will rise up with joy at its appointment to whirl and mention 
Allah’s names like a Mevlevi dervish. With slight expense that graceful situ-
ation will be obtained and the signiﬁcant result come about.

However, if it is said to the earth: “ You stop where you are, do not inter-
fere! ”; and if to obtain the result and situation, it is referred to the heavens; 
and if the road of multiplicity and associating partners with Allah is taken 
rather than that of divine unity, it will be necessary, every day and every 
year, to set in motion millions of stars which are thousands of times larger 
than the globe of the earth and to cover a distance of millions of years in 
twenty-four hours and a year.

Conclusion

C o n c l u s i o n :  The Qur’an and the believers ascribe limitless creatures to 
One Maker. They attribute every matter directly to Him. They travel a road 
so easy as to be necessary, and urge all towards it. While the people of rebel-
lion, who ascribe partners to Allah, by attributing a single creature to innu-
merable causes, travel a road so beset with diﬁculties as to be impossible. 

312

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

In which case, those on the way of the Qur’an are together with all creatures, 
and  those  on  the  way  of  misguidance,  with  a  single  creature.  Or  to  put  it 
another way, the issuing of all things out of one is inﬁnitely easier than the 
issuing of one thing out of many. In the same way that an ofﬁcer commands 
a thousand soldiers as easily as one soldier, if the command of one soldier 
were to be assigned to a thousand ofﬁcers, it would become as difﬁcult as 
commanding a thousand soldiers, it would cause chaos.

Thus, this mighty verse hurls this truth at those who assign partners to 

Allah, shattering their unbelief:

O heedless person who has in his house an elderly parent or an invalid 
or someone no longer able to work from among his relations or brothers in 
religion! Study the above verses carefully and see how on ﬁve levels in dif-
ferent ways it summons children to be kindly towards their elderly parents. 
Yes,  the  highest  truth  in  this  world  is  the  compassion  of  parents  towards 
their children, and the most elevated rights, their rights of respect in return 
for their compassion. For they sacriﬁce their lives with the utmost pleasure, 
spending them for the sake of their children’s lives. In which case, every 
child who has not lost his humanity and become a monster honours those 
respected, loyal, self-sacriﬁcing friends, serves them sincerely, and tries to 
please them and make them happy. Uncles and aunts, maternal and paternal, 
are like parents. 1

So  understand  from  this  how  base  and  lacking  in  conscience  it  is  to 
be  contemptuous  of  those  blessed  elderly  people,  or  to  want  their  deaths.

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

Know what a wicked wrong and iniquity it is to want the lives of those who 
sacriﬁced their lives for yours to pass quickly.

O you who struggles to secure his livelihood! That elderly or blind rela-
tive  of  yours  whom  you  belittle  is  a  source  of  plenty  and  mercy  in  your 
house and repels disaster. Beware! Do not say: “ I have a low income and 
difﬁculty in making ends meet, ” for if it were not for the plenty resulting 
from their presence, your circumstances would have been even more strait-
ened. Believe this fact which I am telling you; I could prove it decisively 
and convince you, but I am cutting it short so as not to prolong the discus-
sion.  Be  content  with  this  much.  I  swear  that  it  is  absolutely  certain;  my 
evil-commanding  soul  and  own  devil,  even,  have  submitted  to  it.  So  you 
should be persuaded by something that has smashed my soul’s obduracy and 
silenced my devil.

Yes, the All-Glorious and Muniﬁcent Creator, who, as the universe testi-
ﬁes, is inﬁnitely Merciful, Compassionate, Bountiful, and Generous, provides 
infants  with  the  ﬁnest  of  sustenance  when  He  sends  them  into  this  world, 
causing it to ﬂow into their mouths from the springs of their mother’s breasts. 
So too, He provides, in the form of plenty, the sustenance of the elderly, who 
are  like  children  though  even  more  in  need  and  deserving  of  kindness  and 
compassion. He does not burden the avaricious and miserly with their liveli-
hood. All living creatures and all their species declare through the tongues of 
their beings the muniﬁcent truth expressed by the following verses:

  ( 51:58 ) Z Y X W V U T

 ( 29:60 ) { z yw v u t s r q p o
In fact, it is not only the sustenance of elderly relations that comes in the 
form of plenty; the sustenance of creatures like cats who are friendly to man 
also comes in the form of plenty, sent together with the food of the human 
beings. An example supporting this, which I myself observed, is as follows: 
my close friends know that for two to three years my appointed lot every day 
was half a loaf of bread, the loaves in that village were small, and very often 
this was insufﬁcient for me. Then four cats came and stayed with me as my 
guests, and that same portion was sufﬁcient both for myself and for them. 
There was frequently some left over even.

This has recurred so often it has made me certain that I was beneﬁting 
from the plenty resulting from the cats. I declare most deﬁnitely that they 
were not a load on me. It was not they who were obliged to me, but I to them.

worldly life. I did not know the reason for this. Then later I understood that the 
reason for his achievement was that he had understood the rights of his elderly 
parents and observed them to the letter; thanks to them he had found ease and 
mercy. Allah willing, he repaired his life in the hereafter as well. Anyone who 
wants good fortune should try to resemble him.

Dispute  and  discord  among  the  believers,  and  partisanship,  obstinacy 
and  envy,  leading  to  rancour  and  enmity  among  them,  are  repugnant  and 
vile, are harmful and sinful, by the combined testimony of wisdom and the 
supreme humanity that is Islam, for personal, social, and spiritual life. They 
are in short, poison for the life of man. We will set forth six of the extremely 
numerous aspects of this truth.

1.  NOTE: The present translation of the Twenty-Second Letter was made by Hamid 
Algar,  Prof.  of  Near  Eastern  Studies  in  Univ.  of  California,  Berkeley,  U.S.A.,  and  ﬁrst 
published in 1976. It has been slightly amended to ﬁt the present work.

TWENTY-SECOND LETTER – FIRST TOPIC

317

First Aspect

First Aspect

They are sinful in the view of truth.
O unjust man nurturing rancour and enmity against a believer! Let us 
suppose that you were on a ship, or in a house, with nine innocent people 
and one criminal. If someone were to try to make the ship sink, or to set 
the house on ﬁre, because of that criminal, you know how great a sinner he 
would be. You would cry out to the heavens against his sinfulness. Even if 
there were one innocent man and nine criminals aboard the ship, it would be 
against all rules of justice to sink it.

So too, if there are in the person of a believer, who may be compared to a 
dominical dwelling, a divine ship, not nine, but as many as twenty innocent 
attributes such as belief, Islam, and neighbourliness; and if you then nurture 
rancour  and  enmity  against  him  on  account  of  one  criminal  attribute  that 
harms and displeases you, attempting or desiring the sinking of his being, 
the burning of his house, then you too will be a criminal guilty of a great 
atrocity.

Second Aspect

Second Aspect

They are also sinful in the view of wisdom, for it is obvious that enmity 
and love are opposites, just like light and darkness; while maintaining their 
respective essences, they cannot be combined.

If  love  is  truly  found  in  a  heart,  by  virtue  of  the  predomination  of  the 
causes that produce it, then enmity in that heart can only be metaphorical, 
and takes on the form of compassion. The believer loves and should love 
his brother, and is pained by any evil he sees in him. He attempts to reform 
him not with harshness but gently. It is for this reason that the Hadith of the 
Prophet ( UWBP ) says, “ No believer should be angered with another and 
cease speaking to him for more than three days. ” 1

If the causes that produce enmity predominate, and true enmity takes up 
its seat in a heart, then the love in that heart will become metaphorical, and 
take on the form of artiﬁce and ﬂattery.

O unjust man! See now what a great sin is rancour and enmity toward 
a brother believer! If you were to say that ordinary small stones are more 
valuable than the Ka‘ba and greater than Mount Uhud, it would be an ugly 
absurdity. So too, belief which has the value of the Ka‘ba, and Islam which

has the splendour of Mount Uhud, as well as other Islamic attributes, demand 
love and concord; but if you prefer to belief and Islam certain shortcomings 
which arouse hostility, but in reality are like the small stones you too will be 
engaging in great injustice, foolishness, and sin!

The unity of belief necessitates also the unity of hearts, and the oneness 
of our creed demands the oneness of our society. You cannot deny that if 
you ﬁnd yourself in the same regiment as someone, you will form a friendly 
attachment to him; a brotherly relation will come into being as a result of 
your both being submitted to the orders of a single commander. You will 
similarly  experience  a  fraternal  relation  through  living  in  the  same  town 
with someone. Now there are ties of unity, bonds of union, and relations of 
fraternity as numeous as the divine names that are shown and demonstrated 
to you by the light and consciousness of belief.

Your Creator, Owner, Object of Worship, and Provider is one and the 
same for both of you; thousands of things are and the same for you. Your 
Prophet ( UWBP ), your religion, your q i b l a  are one and the same; hundreds 
of things are one and the same for you. Then too your village is one, your 
state is one, your country is one; tens of things are one and the same for you. 
All  of  these  things  held  in  common  dictate  oneness  and  unity,  union  and 
concord, love and brotherhood, and indeed the cosmos and the planets are 
similarly interlinked by unseen chains. If, despite all this, you prefer things 
worthless and transient as a spider’s web that give rise to dispute and dis-
cord, to rancour and enmity, and engage in true enmity towards a believer, 
then you will understand – unless your heart is dead and your intelligence 
extinguished – how great is your disrespect for that bond of unity, your slight 
to that relation of love, your transgression against that tie of brotherhood!

Third Aspect

Third Aspect

In accordance with the meaning of the verse:

( 6:164 ) _ ^ ] \ [ 
which  expresses  pure  justice,  to  nurture  rancour  and  enmity  towards  a 
believer  is  like  condemning  all  the  innocent  attributes  found  in  him  on 
account of one criminal attribute, and is hence an act of great injustice. If 
you go further and include in your enmity all the relatives of a believer on 
account of a single evil attribute of his, then, in accordance with the follow-
ing verse in which the active participle is in the intensive form,

( 14:34 ) 0 / . 

TWENTY-SECOND LETTER – FIRST TOPIC

319

you will have committed a still greater sin and transgression, against which 
truth, the Shari‘a and the wisdom of Islam combine to warn you. How then 
can you imagine yourself to be right, and say: “ I am in the right ”?

In the view of truth, the cause for enmity and all forms of evil is in itself 
evil and is dense like clay: it cannot infect or pass on to others. If someone 
learns from it and commits evil, that is another question. Good qualities that 
arouse love are luminous like love; it is part of their function to be transmit-
ted and produce effects. It is for this reason that the proverb has come into 
being, “ The friend of a friend is a friend, ” 1 and also that it is said, “ Many 
eyes are beloved on account of one eye. ”

So O unjust man! If such be the view of truth, you will understand now, 
if you have the capacity for seeing the truth, how great an offence it is to 
cherish enmity for the likeable and innocent brothers and relatives of a man 
you dislike.

Fourth Aspect

Fourth Aspect

It is a sin from the point of view of personal life. Listen to the following 

four principles which are the base of this Fourth Aspect.

First Principle

F i r s t   P r i n c i p l e :  When you know your way and opinions to be true, you 
have the right to say, “ My way is right and the best. ” But you do not have 
the right to say, “ Only my way is right. ” According to the sense of 

 2 اَ(cid:192)ِواَ(cid:127) َ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)ا ى ِدْ(cid:93)ـُ(cid:98)  ِطـْ(cid:115) ُ
your unjust view and distorted opinion cannot be the all-decisive judge and 
cannot condemn the belief of another as invalid.

ّنﯮﯧٰ(cid:170)َو    ٌةَ(cid:171)(cid:193)ِ(cid:171)ﯬﯦ  ٍبْ(cid:193)َ(cid:150)  ّ

ِر(cid:170)ا ُنْ(cid:193)َ(cid:150)َو

Second Principle

S e c o n d   P r i n c i p l e :  It is your right that all that you say should be true, but 
not that you should say all that is true. For one of insincere intention may 
sometimes take unkindly to advice, and react against it unfavourably.

Third Principle

T h i r d   P r i n c i p l e :   If  you  wish  to  nourish  enmity,  then  direct  it  against 
the enmity in your heart, and attempt to rid yourself of it. Be an enemy to 
your evil-commanding soul and its caprice and attempt to reform it, for it 
inﬂicts  more  harm  on  you  than  all  else.  Do  not  engage  in  enmity  against 
other believers on account of that injurious soul. Again, if you wish to cher-
ish enmity, there are unbelievers and atheists in great abundance; be hostile 
to them. In the same way that the attribute of love is ﬁt to receive love as

its response, so too enmity will receive enmity as its own ﬁtting response. 
If you wish to defeat your enemy, then respond to his evil with good. For if 
you respond with evil, enmity will increase, and even though he will be out-
wardly defeated, he will nurture hatred in his heart and hostility will persist. 
But if you respond to him with good, he will repent and become your friend. 
The meaning of the lines:

is that it is the mark of the believer to be noble, and he will become submit-
ted to you by noble treatment. And even if someone is apparently ignoble, 
he is noble with respect to his belief. It often happens that if you tell an evil 
man, “ You are good, you are good, ” he will become good; and if you tell 
a  good  man,  “ You  are  bad,  you  are  bad, ”  he  will  become  bad.  Hearken, 
therefore, to these sacred principles of the Qur’an, for happiness and safety 
are to be found in them:

  ( 25:72 ) f e d c b

Fourth Principle

( 64:14 ) k j i h g f e d

F o u r t h   P r i n c i p l e :   Those  who  cherish  rancour  and  enmity  transgress 
against their own souls, their brother believer, and divine mercy. For such 
a person condemns his soul to painful torment with his rancour and enmity. 
He imposes torment on his soul whenever his enemy receives some bounty, 
and pain from fear of him. If his enmity arises from envy, then it is the most 
severe form of torment. For envy in the ﬁrst place consumes and destroys the 
envier, and its harm for the one envied is either slight or nonexistent.

The cure for envy: Let the envious reﬂect on the ultimate fate of those 
things  that  arouse  his  enmity.  Then  he  will  understand  that  the  beauty, 
strength, rank, and wealth possessed by his rival are transient and temporary. 
Their beneﬁt is slight, and the anxiety they cause is great. If it is a question 
of personal qualities that will gain him reward in the hereafter, they cannot 
be an object of envy. But if one does envy another on account of them, then 
he is either himself a hypocrite, wishing to destroy the goods of the hereafter 
while yet in this world, or he imagines the one whom he envies to be a hypo-
crite, thus being unjust towards him.

If he rejoices at the misfortunes he suffers and is grieved by the bounties 
he receives, it is as if he is offended by the kindness shown towards him by

divine determining ( k a d e r  ) and divine mercy, as if he were criticizing and 
objecting to them. Whoever criticizes divine determining is striking his head 
against an anvil on which it will break, and whoever objects to divine mercy 
will himself be deprived of it.

How  might  justice  and  sound  conscience  accept  that  the  response  to 
something worth not even a day’s hostility should be a year’s rancour and 
hostility? You cannot condemn a brother believer for some evil you experi-
ence at his hand for the following reasons:

F i r s t l y,  divine determining has a certain share of responsibility. It is nec-
essary to deduct that share from the total and respond to it with contentment 
and satisfaction.

S e c o n d l y,  the share of the soul and Satan should also be deducted, and 
one should pity the man for having been overcome by his soul and await his 
repentance instead of becoming his enemy.

T h i r d l y ,  look  at  the  defect  in  your  own  soul  that  you  do  not  see  or  do 
not wish to see; deduct a share for that too. As for the small share which 
then remains, if you respond with forgiveness, pardon, and magnanimity, in 
such a way as to conquer your enemy swiftly and safely, then you will have 
escaped all sin and harm. But if, like some drunken and crazed person who 
buys up fragments of glass and ice as if they were diamonds, you respond to 
worthless, transient, temporary, and insigniﬁcant happenings of this world 
with violent enmity, permanent rancour, and perpetual hostility, as if you 
were going to remain in the world with your enemy for all eternity, it would 
be extreme transgression, sinfulness, drunkenness, and lunacy.

If then you love yourself, do not permit this harmful hostility and desire 
for revenge, so harmful for personal life, to enter your heart. If it has entered 
your  heart,  do  not  listen  to  what  it  says.  Hear  what  truth-seeing  Haﬁz  of 
(cid:315)ْ(cid:300)ُد “ The world is not a commodity 
worth arguing over. ” It is worthless since it is transient and passing. If this is 
true of the world, then it is clear how worthless and insignﬁcant are the petty 
affairs of the world! Haﬁz also said:

I f   y o u   s a y :  “ I have no choice, there is enmity within my disposition. I 

cannot overlook those who antagonize me. ”

T h e   A n s w e r :   If  evil  character  and  bad  disposition  do  not  exhibit  any 
trace, and you do not act with ill intention, there is no harm. If you have no 
choice in the matter, then you are unable to abandon your enmity. If you rec-
ognize your defect and understand that you are wrong to have that attribute, 
it  will  be  a  form  of  repentance  and  seeking  of  forgiveness  for  you,  thus 
delivering you from its evil effects. In fact, we have written this Topic of the 
Letter in order to make possible such a seeking of forgiveness, to distinguish 
right from wrong, and to prevent enmity from being displayed as rightful.

A case worthy of notice: I once saw, as a result of biased partisanship, a 
pious scholar of religion going so far in his condemnation of another scholar 
with whose political opinions he disagreed as to imply that he was an unbe-
liever. He also praised with respect a dissembler who shared his own opin-
ions.  I  was  appalled  at  these  evil  results  of  political  involvement.  I  said:

Fifth Aspect

Obstinacy and partisanship are extremely harmful in social life.
I f   i t   i s   S a i d :  There is a Hadith which says: ٌة َ(cid:175)ْ(cid:110)َر ىِ(cid:99)َ

ّ(cid:174)ُا  ُف َ(cid:203)ِ(cid:99)ْ(cid:114)ِا 1 and differ-

ence requires partisanship. 

The sickness of partisanship also delivers the oppressed common people 
from the oppressor elite, for if the elite of a town or village join together, 
they will destroy the oppressed common people. If there is partisanship, the 
oppressed may seek refuge with one of the parties and thus save himself. 

It  is  also  from  the  confrontation  of  opinions  and  the  contradiction  of 

views that truth becomes apparent in its full measure.

The Answer:
To the ﬁrst part of the question, we say: The difference intended in the 
Hadith is a positive difference. That is, each party strives to promote and 
diffuse its own belief; it does not seek to tear down and destroy that of the 
other, but rather to improve and reform it. Negative difference is rejected by 
the Hadith, for it aims in partisan and hostile fashion at mutual destruction, 
and those who are at each other’s throats cannot act positively.

To  the  second  part  of  the  question,  we  say:  If  partisanship  is  in 
the  name  of  truth,  it  can  become  a  refuge  for  those  seeking  their  rights.

But  as  for  the  partisanship  obtaining  now,  biased  and  self-centred,  it  can 
only be a refuge for the unjust and a point of support for them. For if a devil 
comes to a man engaged in biased partisanship, encourages him in his ideas 
and takes his side, that man will call down Allah’s blessings on the Devil. 
But if the opposing side is joined by a man of angelic nature, then he will – 
may Allah protect us! – go so far as to invoke curses upon him.

To the third part of the question, we say: If the confrontation of views 
takes place in the name of justice and for the sake of truth, then the difference 
concerns only means; there is unity with respect to aim and basic purpose. 
Such a difference makes manifest every aspect of the truth and serves justice 
and truth. But what emerges from a confrontation of views that is partisan 
and biased, and takes place for the sake of a tyrannical, evil-commanding 
soul, that is based on egotism and fame-seeking – what emerges from this is 
not the ﬂash of truth, but the ﬁre of dissension. Unity of aim is necessary, but 
opposing views of this kind can never ﬁnd a point of convergence anywhere 
on earth. Since they do not differ for the sake of the truth, they multiply a d  
i n ﬁ n i t u m , and give rise to divergences that can never be reconciled.

name of the Shari‘a, his soul would have felt pity for the victim; he should 
have cut it off in a manner devoid of both anger and mercy. Since the incli-
nations of his soul had had some share in his deed, he did not perform the 
act with justice.

A  regrettable  social  condition  and  an  awesome  disease  affecting 
the life of society, ﬁt to be wept over by the heart of Islam: To forget 
and abandon internal enmities when foreign enemies appear and attack is a 
demand of social welfare recognized and enacted even by the most primi-
tive peoples. What then ails those who claim to be serving the Islamic com-
munity that at a time when numberless enemies are taking up positions to 
attack, one after the other, they fail to forget their petty enmities, and instead 
prepare the ground for the enemies’ attacks? It is disgraceful savagery, and 
treason committed against the social life of Islam.

A story to be pondered over: There were two groups of the Hasanan, 
a  tribe  of  nomads,  hostile  to  each  other.  Although  more  than  maybe  ﬁfty 
people had been killed on each side, when another tribe such as the Sibgan 
or Haydaran came out against them, those two hostile groups would forget 
their enmity and ﬁght together, shoulder to shoulder, until the opposing tribe 
had been repelled, without ever once recalling their internal dissensions. 

O Believers! Do you know how many tribes of enemies have taken up 
position  to  attack  the  tribe  of  the  people  of  belief?  There  are  more  than 
a  hundred  of  them,  like  a  series  of  concentric  circles.  The  believers  are 
obliged to take up defensive positions, each supporting the other and giv-
ing him a helping hand. Is it then at all ﬁtting for the people of belief that 
with their biased partisanship and hostile rancour they should facilitate the 
attack of the enemy and ﬂing open the doors for him to penetrate the fold 
of Islam? There are maybe seventy circles of enemies, including the mis-
guided, the atheist, and the unbeliever, each of them as harmful to you as 
all the terrors and afﬂictions of this world, and each of them regarding you 
with greed, anger and hatred. Your ﬁrm weapon, shield and citadel against 
all of them is none other than the brotherhood of Islam. So realize just how 
contrary to conscience and to the interests of Islam it is to shake the citadel 
of Islam on account of petty hostilities and other pretexts! Know this, and 
come to your senses!

According to a noble Hadith of the Prophet ( UWBP ), noxious and awe-
some persons like Sufyan and the Dajjal will come to rule over the godless

to anarchy and the vast world of Islam to slavery. 1

O people of faith! If you do not wish to enter a humiliating condition of 

slavery, come to your senses and enter and take refuge in the citadel of:

to defend yourselves against those oppressors who would exploit your dif-
ferences!  Otherwise  you  will  be  able  neither  to  protect  your  lives  nor  to 
defend  your  rights.  It  is  evident  that  if  two  champions  are  wrestling  with 
each  other,  even  a  child  can  beat  them.  If  two  mountains  are  balanced 
in  the  scales,  even  a  small  stone  can  disturb  their  equilibrium  and  cause 
one  to  rise  and  the  other  to  fall.  So  O  people  of  belief!  Your  strength  is 
reduced  to  nothing  as  a  result  of  your  passions  and  biased  partisan-
ships,  and  you  can  be  defeated  by  the  slightest  forces.  If  you  have  any

Sixth Aspect

Sixth Aspect

Spiritual life and correctness of worship will suffer as a result of enmity 
and rancour, since the purity of intention that is the means of salvation will 
be damaged. For a biased person will desire superiority over his enemy in 
the  good  deeds  that  he  performs  and  will  be  unable  to  act  purely  for  the 
sake of Allah. He will also prefer, in his judgement and dealings, the one 
who takes his side; he will be unable to be just. Thus the purity of intention 
and the justice that are the bases of all good acts and deeds will be lost on 
account of enmity and hostility.

The Sixth Aspect is extremely complex, but we will cut it short here since 

this is not the place to enlarge on it.

O  people  of  belief!  You  will  have  understood  by  now  how  harmful  is 
enmity. Understand too that greed is another awesome disease, as harmful 
for  the  life  of  Islam  as  enmity.  Greed  brings  about  disappointment,  deﬁ-
ciency,  and  humiliation;  it  is  the  cause  of  deprivation  and  abjection.  The 
humiliation  and  abjection  of  people  who  have  leaped  greedily  upon  the 
world, is a decisive proof of this truth. Greed demonstrates its evil effects 
throughout the animate world, from the most universal of species to the most 
particular of individuals. To seek out one’s sustenance while placing one’s 
trust  in  Allah  will,  by  constrast,  bring  about  tranquillity  and  demonstrate 
everywhere its beneﬁcient effects. 

Thus, fruit trees and plants, which are a species of animate being insofar 
as they require sustenance, remain contentedly rooted where they are, plac-
ing their trust in Allah and not evincing any greed; it is for this reason that 
their  sustenance  hastens  toward  them.  They  breed  too  far  more  offspring 
than do the animals. The animals, by contrast, pursue their sustenance greed-
ily, and for this reason are able to attain it only imperfectly and at the cost 
of great effort. Within the animal kingdom it is only the young who, as it 
were, evince their trust in Allah by proclaiming their weakness and impo-
tence; hence it is that they receive in full measure their rightful and delicate 
sustenance from the treasury of divine mercy. But savage beasts that pounce 
greedily on their sustenance can hope only for an illicit and coarse suste-
nance, attained through the expenditure of great effort. These two examples 
show that greed is the cause of deprivation, while trust in Allah and content-
ment are the means to Allah’s mercy.

In  the  human  kingdom,  some  peoples  have  clung  to  the  world  more 
greedily and have loved its life with more passion than any others, but the 
usurious wealth they have gained with great efforts is merely illicit property 
over which they exercise temporary stewardship, and it beneﬁts them little.

It  earns  them,  on  the  contrary,  the  blows  of  abjection  and  humiliation,  of 
death and insult, that are rained down on them by all peoples. This shows 
that greed is a source of humiliation and loss. There are in addition so many 
ُص(cid:192)ِرَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا 
instances of a greedy person being exposed to loss that ٌر ِ(cid:126)اَ(cid:114)  ٌبِ(cid:86)اَ(cid:114) 
has  become  a  universally  accepted  truth.  This  being  the  case,  if  you  love 
wealth, seek it not with greed but with contentment, so that you may have it 
in abundance.

The  content  and  the  greedy  are  like  two  men  who  enter  the  audience-
hall of a great personage. One of them says to himself: “ It is enough that 
he should admit me so that I can escape from the cold outside. Even if he 
motions me to sit in the lowest position, I will count it as a kindness. ”

The second man says arrogantly, as if he had some right in the matter 
and everyone were obliged to respect him: “ I should be assigned the highest 
position. ” He enters with greed and ﬁxes his gaze on the highest positions, 
wishing to advance toward them. But the master of the audience-hall turns 
him back and seats him in a lower position. Instead of thanking him as he 
should, he is angered against him in his heart and criticizes him. The lord of 
the palace will be offended by him.

The ﬁrst man enters most humbly and wishes to sit in the lowest posi-
tion. His modesty pleases the lord of the audience-hall, and he invites him 
to sit in a higher position. His gratitude increases, and his thankfulness is 
augmented.

Now this world is like an audience-hall of the Most Merciful One. The 
surface of the globe is like a banqueting spread laid out by His mercy. The 
differing degrees of sustenance and grades of bounty correspond to the seat-
ing positions in the audience-hall.

Furthermore, even in the minutest of affairs everyone can experience the 
evil effects of greed. For example, everyone knows in his heart that when 
two beggars request something, he will be offended by the one who greed-
ily importunes him, and refuse his request; whereas he will take pity on the 
peaceable one and give him what he asks.

Or to give another example, if you are unable to fall asleep at night and 
wish to do so, you may succeed if you remain detached. But if you desire 
sleep greedily, and say: “ Let me sleep, let me sleep, ” then sleep will quit 
you entirely.

Yet another example is this, that if you greedily await the arrival of some-
one for some important purpose and continually say: “ He still hasn’t come, ” 

328

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

ultimately you will lose patience and get up and leave. But one minute later 
the person will come, and your purpose will be frustrated.

The reason for all this is as follows. The production of a loaf of bread 
requires a ﬁeld to be cultivated and harvested, the grain to be taken to a mill, 
and the loaf to be baked in an oven. So too in the arrangement of all things 
there is a certain slow deliberation decreed by Allah’s wisdom. If on account 
of greed one fails to act with slow deliberation, one will fail to notice the 
steps one must mount in the arrangement of all things; he will either fall or 
be unable to traverse the steps, and in either event will not reach his goal.

O brothers giddied by preoccupation with your livelihood, and drunk on 
your greed for this world! Greed is harmful and pernicious; how is it then 
that you commit all kinds of abject deed for the sake of your greed; accept 
all kinds of wealth, without concern for licit or illicit; and sacriﬁce much of 
the hereafter? On account of your greed you even abandon one of the most 
important pillars of Islam, the payment of z a k a t , although z a k a t  is for every-
one a means of attracting plenty and repelling misfortune. The one who does 
not pay z a k a t  is bound to lose the amount of money he would otherwise have 
paid: either he will spend it on some useless object, or it will be taken from 
him by some misfortune.

In a veracious dream that came to me during the ﬁfth year of the First 

World War, the following question was put to me: 

“ What is the reason for this hunger, ﬁnancial loss, and physical trial that 

now afﬂicts the Muslims? ” I replied in the dream:

“ From the wealth He bestows upon us, Allah Almighty required from 
us  either  a  tenth  or  a  fortieth  1  so  that  we  may  beneﬁt  from  the  grateful 
prayers of the poor, and rancour and envy may be prevented. But in our 
greed and covetousness we refused to give z a k a t , and Allah Almighty has 
taken from us a thirtieth where a fortieth was owed, and an eighth where 
a tenth was owed.

“ He required of us to undergo, for no more than one month each year, 
a hunger with seventy beneﬁcial purposes. But we took pity on our instinc-
tual  souls,  and  did  not  undergo  that  temporary  pleasurable  hunger.  Allah 
Almighty then punished us by compelling us to fast for ﬁve years, with a 
hunger replete with seventy kinds of misfortune.

“ He  also  required  of  us,  out  of  each  period  of  twenty-four  hours,  one 
hour to be spent in a form of divine drill, pleasing and sublime, luminous 

1.  A tenth, that is, of wealth like corn that every year yields a new crop; and a fortieth 

of whatever yielded a commercial proﬁt in the course of the year.

TWENTY-SECOND LETTER – SECOND TOPIC

and  beneﬁcial.  But  in  our  laziness  we  neglected  the  duty  of  prayer.  That 
single  hour  was  joined  to  the  other  hours  and  wasted.  As  penance,  Allah 
Almighty then caused us to undergo a form of drill and physical exertion 
that took the place of prayer. ”

I then awoke, and upon reﬂection realized that an extremely important 
truth was contained in that dream. As proven and explained in the Twenty-
Fifth Word, when comparing modern civilization with the principles of the 
Qur’an, all immorality and instability in the social life of man proceeds from 
two sources:

T h e   F i r s t :  “ Once my stomach is full, what do I care if others die of hun-

ger? ”

T h e   S e c o n d :  “ You work, and I’ll eat. ”
That which perpetuates these two is the prevalence of usury and inter-
est on the one hand, and the abandonment of z a k a t  on the other. The only 
remedy able to cure these two awesome social diseases lies in implementing 
z a k a t  as a universal principle and in forbidding usury. Z a k a t  is a most essen-
tial support of happiness not merely for individuals and particular societies, 
but  for  all  of  humanity.  There  are  two  classes  of  men:  the  upper  classes 
and the common people. It is only  z a k a t  that will induce compassion and 
generosity in the upper classes toward the common people, and respect and 
obedience in the common people toward the upper classes. In the absence of 
z a k a t , the upper classes will descend on the common people with cruelty and 
oppression, and the common people will rise up against the upper classes in 
rancour and rebellion. There will be a constant struggle, a persistent opposi-
tion between the two classes of men. It will ﬁnally result in the confrontation 
of capital and labour, as happened in Russia.

O people of nobility and good conscience! O people of generosity and 
liberality! If acts of generosity are not performed in the name of z a k a t , there 
are three harmful results. The act may have no effect, for if you do not give 
in the name of Allah, you are in effect imposing an obligation, and impris-
oning some wretched pauper with a sense of obligation. Then you will be 
deprived of his prayer, a prayer which would be most acceptable in the sight 
of Allah. In reality you are nothing but an ofﬁcial entrusted with the distribu-
tion of Allah Almighty’s bounties among His servants; but if you imagine 
yourself to be the owner of wealth, this is an act of ingratitude for the boun-
ties you have received. If, on the contrary, you give in the name of z a k a t , you 
will be rewarded for having given in the name of Allah Almighty; you will 
have offered thanks for bounties received. The needy person too will not be 

330

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

compelled to fawn and cringe in front of you; his self-respect will not be 
injured, and his prayer on your behalf will be accepted. See how great is the 
difference between, on the one hand, giving as much as one would in z a k a t , 
but earning nothing but the harm of hypocrisy, fame, and the imposition of 
obligation; and, on the other hand, performing the same good deeds in the 
name of z a k a t , and thereby fulﬁlling a duty, and gaining a reward, the virtue 
of sincerity, and the prayers of those whom you have beneﬁted?

Concerning Backbiting
In the Fifth Point of the First Ray of the First Light of the Twenty-Fifth 
Word, a single Qur’anic verse having the effect of discouraging and restrain-
ing was shown to induce repugnance at backbiting in six miraculous ways. 
It was shown too how abominable a thing is backbiting in the view of the 
Qur’an, and that there is therefore no need for any further explanation of the 
subject. Indeed, after the Qur’an has made its declaration, there is neither the 
possibility nor the need for anything further.

The Qur’an reproaches the backbiter with six reproaches in the verse:

 ( 49:12 ) ; : 9 8 7 6 5 4 
and forbids him to commit this sin with six degrees of severity. When the 
verse is directed to those persons actually engaged in backbiting, its mean-
ing is the following.

As is well-known, the “ h a m z a  ” at the beginning of the verse has an inter-
rogative sense. This interrogative sense penetrates all the words of the verse 
like water, so that each word acquires an additional meaning. Thus the ﬁrst 
word asks, with its “ h a m z a : ” “ Is it that you have no intelligence capable of 
discrimination, so that you fail to perceive the ugliness of this thing? ”

The second word T asks: “ Is your heart, the seat of love and hatred, so 

corrupted that it loves the most repugnant of things? ”

The third word 5 asks: “ What befell your sense of social and 
civilized responsibility that you are able to accept something poisonous to 
social life? ”

The fourth word 8 7 6 asks: “ What has befallen your sense of 
humanity that you are tearing your friend apart with your fangs like a wild 
animal? ”

331

332

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

The ﬁfth word 9 asks: “ Do you have no fellow-feeling, no sense of 
kinship, that you are able to sink your teeth into some wretch who is tied to 
you  by  numerous  links  of  brotherhood?  Do  you  have  no  intelligence  that 
you are able to bite into your own limbs with your own teeth, in such lunatic 
fashion? ”

The sixth word : asks: “ Where is your conscience? Is your nature 
so corrupt that you abandon all respect and act so repugnantly as to consume 
your brother’s ﬂesh? ”

According then to the total sense of the verse, as well as the indications 
of each of its words, slander and backbiting are repugnant to the intelligence 
and the heart, to humanity and conscience, to nature and social conscious-
ness.

You  see  then  that  the  verse  condemns  backbiting  in  six  miraculous 
degrees  and  restrains  men  from  it  in  six  miraculous  ways.  Backbiting  is 
the vile weapon most commonly used by the people of enmity, envy, and 
obstinacy, and the self-respecting will never stoop to employing so unclean 
a weapon. Some celebrated person once said:

weapon of the weak, the low, and the vile. ”

Backbiting consists of saying that which would be a cause of dislike and 
vexation to the person in question if he were to be present and hear it. Even if 
what is said is true, it is still backbiting. If it is a lie, then it is both backbiting 
and slander and a doubly loathsome sin.

Backbiting can be permissible in a few special instances:
First: If a complaint be presented to some ofﬁcial, so that with his help 

evil be removed and justice restored.

Second: If a person contemplating co-operation with another comes to 
seek your advice, and you say to him, purely for the sake of his beneﬁt and 
to advise him correctly, without any self-interest: “ Do not co-operate with 
him; it will be to your disadvantage. ”

Third: If the purpose is not to expose someone to disgrace and notoriety, 
but  simply  to  make  people  aware,  and  one  says:  “ That  foolish,  confused 
man went to such-and-such a place. ”

TWENTY-SECOND LETTER – CONCLUSION

333

Fourth: If the subject of backbiting is an open and unashamed sinner; is 
not troubled by evil, but on the contrary takes pride in the sins he commits; 
ﬁnds pleasure in his wrongdoing; and unhesitatingly sins in the most evident 
fashion.

In  these  particular  cases,  backbiting  may  be  permissible,  if  it  be  done 
without self-interest and purely for the sake of truth and communal welfare. 
But apart from them, it is like a ﬁre that consumes good deeds like a ﬂame 
eating up wood.

If one has engaged in backbiting, or willingly listened to it, one should 

say: ُهاَ(cid:179)ْ(cid:93)َ(cid:99)ْ(cid:154)ا  ِنـ َ(cid:175)ِ(cid:170)َو اَ(cid:179)َ(cid:170)ْرِ(cid:159)ْ(cid:154)ا َ

My Dear, Enterprising, Serious, True, Sincere, and Sagacious Brother!
For brothers of the hereafter and the truth like us, differences of time and 
place are no obstacle to their conversing and intimacy. Even if one is in the 
east, one in the west, one in the past, one in the future, one in this world, 
and one in the next, they still may be thought of as being together and may 
converse. Especially those who have undertaken the same duty to achieve 
the same goal; they are as though united. Every morning I imagine that you 
are  here  with  me,  and  I  make  over  a  part,  a  third,  of  my  spiritual  gains 
to  you.  May  Allah  ﬁnd  them  acceptable!  In  my  prayers  you  are  together 
with  Abdülmecid  and  Abdurrahman.  Allah  willing,  you  always  receive 
your share. Your suffering difﬁculties in respect of worldly life saddened 
me a little, for your sake. But since this world is not eternal and good may 
come of disasters, it occurred to me to say on your behalf: “ This too will 
pass. ” I thought of the Hadith: ِةَر ِ(cid:114)ٰ

you belong to that class of His loved ones. Do not let the increased difﬁcul-
ties preventing the spreading of the  Wo r d s  upset you. Allah willing, when 
the  amount  you  have  distributed  comes  to  manifest  divine  mercy,  those 
light-ﬁlled seeds will open a profusion of ﬂowers.

You asked a number of questions. My dear brother! The majority of the 
Wo r d s  and L e t t e r s  that have been written occurred to my heart instantane-
ously without the exercise of will; and they turned out very well. If I reply 
to you relying on my will and strength of knowledge and thought like the 
Old Said, the answers will turn out dull and deﬁcient. For some time now 
my  heart  has  received  no  inspirations  and  the  whip  of  my  memory  been 
broken; so I shall reply extremely brieﬂy to each of them, so as not to leave 
you without an answer.

YOUR FIRST QUESTION

What is the best way believers can pray for one another?
T h e   A n s w e r :  Their prayer has to be within the bounds of what is accept-
able,  for  supplications  become  acceptable  under  certain  conditions;  their 
acceptability increases as these conditions are fulﬁlled. For instance, when 
a person wants to offer supplications, he should be puriﬁed spiritually by 
seeking  forgiveness;  then  he  should  recite  benedictions  ( ṣ a l a w ā t  )  for  the 
Prophet  ( UWBP ),  an  acceptable  prayer,  for  intercession;  and  following 
his  supplication  he  should  again  recite  the  s a l a w a t .  For  a  prayer  offered 
between two such acceptable prayers itself becomes acceptable; as is pray-
ing for another without their knowledge;  ِبْ(cid:193)َ(cid:155)ْ(cid:170)ا ِرْ(cid:183)َ(cid:147)ِ(cid:92) 1 and are the traditional 
supplications and prayers in the Qur’an and Hadiths. For example:
ّمُ(cid:183)ٰ
ّ(cid:171)(cid:170)َا

ِد(cid:170)ا ىِ(cid:158) ُهَ(cid:170)َو ىِ(cid:170) َةَ(cid:193)ِ(cid:158)اَ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)اَو َوْ(cid:159)َ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)ا

General supplications like these when offered sincerely and with humility 
and tranquillity of heart; and following the ﬁve daily prayers, and the morn-
ing prayer in particular; and in holy places, and mosques in particular; and 
on Fridays, and particularly during “ the hour when prayers are answered; ” 
and  during  the  three  months  of  Rajab,  Sha‘ban,  and  Ramadan,  and  on 
the well-known holy nights, such as the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) birthday and

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

Ragha’ib, and on the Night of Power in particular – it is to be strongly hoped 
from divine mercy that such supplications will be accepted. 1 The results of 
such acceptable prayers are either seen in this world exactly as requested, 
or they are accepted in respect of the eternal life in the hereafter of the one 
who offered them. That is to say, if what was sought does not occur exactly 
as wished, it should not be said that the prayer was not accepted, 2 but that it 
was accepted in a better form.

YOUR SECOND QUESTION

Since the phrase, “ May Allah be pleased with him ” is used for the Com-
panions of the Prophet ( UWBP ), is it appropriate to use it in the same way 
for others?

T h e   A n s w e r :  Yes, it may be used, because unlike “ Upon whom be bless-
ings and peace, ” which is a mark of Allah’s Messenger ( UWBP ), the epi-
thet,  “ May  Allah  be  pleased  with  him ”  is  not  particular  to  the  Compan-
ions, but should be used for persons who, like the Companions, attained to 
the “ greater sainthood ” known as “ the legacy of prophethood, ” rising to 
the station of Allah’s pleasure. Examples are the four Imams, and Shaikh 
‘Abd al-Qadir Gilani, Imam-i Rabbani ( Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi ), and Imam 
Ghazali. But the general practice among religious scholars has been to use 
“ May Allah be pleased with him ” for the Companions; “ May Allah have 
mercy on him ” for the two generations succeeding them; “ May Allah for-
give him ” for subsequent generations; and “ May his mystery be sanctiﬁed ” 
for the great saints. 

YOUR THIRD QUESTION

Which were superior, the great imams and interpreters of the Holy Law, 

or the s h a h s  and spiritual poles of the true Suﬁ paths? 

T h e   A n s w e r :   Not  all  the  interpreters  of  the  Law  were  superior  to  the 
shahs and spiritual poles, only Abu Hanifa, Malik, Shaﬁ‘i, and Ahmad b. 
Hanbal.  But  in  some  respects,  some  wondrous  spiritual  poles  like  Shaikh 
Gilani reached more brilliant stations in particular virtues. However, general 
virtue  was  the  Imams’.  Furthermore,  some  of  the  s h a h s   of  the  Suﬁ  paths 
were also interpreters of the Law; it cannot therefore be said that all inter-
preters of the Law were superior to the spiritual poles. But it may be said that 
after the Companions and the Mahdi, the four Imams were superior.

YOUR FOURTH QUESTION

What is the purpose and aim of the words: ( 2:153 ) Ì Ë Ê É ?
T h e   A n s w e r :   As  required  by  His  name  of  All-Wise,  Almighty  Allah 
placed in all things an arrangement like the steps of stairs. The impatient 
man does not act with slow deliberation, so either skips some of the steps 
and  falls,  or  leaves  some  deﬁcient;  he  cannot  mount  to  the  roof  of  his 
goal.  Greed  is  therefore  the  cause  of  loss.  Patience  however  is  the  key 
ُص(cid:192)ِرَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)َا    and  the  Hadith, 
to  all  difﬁculties,  and  the  saying,  ٌر ِ(cid:126)اَ(cid:114)   ٌبِ(cid:86)اَ(cid:114)  
ِجَرَ(cid:159)ْ(cid:170)ا  ُحاَ(cid:99)ْ(cid:159)ِ(cid:174)  ُرْ(cid:93) َ
ّ(cid:135)(cid:170)اَو  1  have  become  proverbial.  That  is  to  say,  Almighty 

Allah’s grace and favour are with the patient. For patience is threefold:

The First is to patiently persevere in refraining from sin; this patience is 

t a q w a  and manifests the meaning of the verse:

( 2:194 ) n m l k 
The Second is patience in the face of calamity; this to place one’s trust 
in Allah and to submit to Him. It is to be honoured by the manifestation of 
these verses: 

 ( 3:146 ) ´ ³ ²  ( 3:159 ) J I H G 
As for impatience, it amounts to complaining about Allah, and to criticizing 
His actions, accusing His mercy, and not liking His wisdom. For sure, man 
is weak and powerless, and weeps complainingly at the blows of misfortune, 
but his complaint must be to Him, not about Him. It should resemble Jacob’s 
( Upon whom be peace ) words:

( 12:86 ) Ð Ï Î Í Ì Ë
That is to say, he should complain to Allah, not lament saying: “ What have 
I  done  that  this  should  have  happened  to  me? ”  as  though  complaining  to 
other human beings about Allah; to excite the sympathy of impotent humans 
is harmful and meaningless. 

The Third Sort of Patience is patient perseverance in worship, which 
raises a person to the station of being beloved of Allah. It urges him towards 
perfect worship of Allah and servitude of Him, which is the most elevated 
station.

YOUR FIFTH QUESTION

Fifteen is accepted as the age of discretion. How did Allah’s Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) worship before his prophetic mission?
T h e   A n s w e r :  He used to worship in accordance with what remained of 
Abraham’s ( Upon whom be peace ) religion, which was still extant in Ara-
bia though in very obscure form. But this was his own choice, to perform a 
good act, not because he was obliged or compelled in any way. This truth is 
lengthy, so let it remain at that for now.

YOUR SIXTH QUESTION

What  was  the  wisdom  in  his  prophethood  commencing  when  he  was 
forty years of age, which is reckoned to be the age of perfect maturity, and 
his blessed life continuing for sixty-three years?

T h e   A n s w e r :  There were numerous purposes and instances of wisdom in 
this. One of them is as follows: prophethood brings with it extremely heavy 
responsibility. To bear it, the intellectual abilities have to mature and capac-
ity of the heart, increase and be perfected. Forty is the age they are most per-
fectly developed. In addition, the period of youth, when the passions of the 
soul are enﬂamed, the blood is ﬁery and exuberant, and worldly ambitions 
are  intense,  is  not  ﬁtting  for  the  duties  of  prophethood,  which  are  purely 
divine, sacred, and pertain to the hereafter. However serious and sincere a 
man is before the age of forty, the suspicion that he is working for worldly 
renown might occur to those who themselves seek fame. He could not easily 
be exonerated in the face of their accusations. But after the age of forty, the 
descent to the grave begins, and the hereafter looms larger for such a man 
than this world. He can be easily vindicated by his actions and works, which 
look to the hereafter, and he is successful. And others too are saved from 
thinking ill of him.

When  it  comes  to  his  blessed  life  lasting  sixty-three  years,  one  of  the 
instances of wisdom in it is this: the believers are charged by the Shari‘a to 
love and respect Allah’s Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ) to the utmost degree, to feel repelled at nothing about him at all, 
and  to  look  on  everything  about  him  as  good.  Almighty  Allah,  therefore, 
did not leave His Noble Beloved ( UWBP ) to live the difﬁcult, troublesome 
years of old age after sixty-three; He rather sent him to the Sublime Court at 
that age, which was the average life expectancy of the community of which 
he was the leader. He took him to Himself, showing that he was the leader 
in every respect.

best  youth  is  the  one  who  thinks  about  death  like  an  elderly  person,  and 
working for the hereafter, avoids joining those who become captive to the 
passions of youth and drown in heedlessness. And the worst of your elderly 
people is the one who tries to resemble the young in heedlessness and pas-
sion, and follows the lusts of the soul like a child. ”

The correct form of the second part you saw in the piece is as follows. I 
have hung it above my head for the wisdom it teaches. I look it at it every 
morning and evening and receive instruction:

If you want a friend, Allah is sufﬁcient. Yes, if He is your friend, eve-

rything is friendly.

If you want companions, the Qur’an is sufﬁcient. For in the imagina-
tion  one  meets  with  the  prophets  and  angels  in  it,  observes  the  events  in 
which they were involved, and becomes familiar with them. 

If you want possessions, contentment is sufﬁcient. Yes, the person who 

is content is frugal; and the frugal person receives the blessing of plenty.

If you want an enemy, the soul is sufﬁcient. Yes, the person who fan-
cies himself is visited with calamities and meets with difﬁculties, whereas 
the one who is not fond of himself, ﬁnds happiness, and receives mercy.

If you want advice, death is sufﬁcient. Yes, the person who thinks of 
death is saved from love of this world, and works in earnest for the hereafter. 
I am adding an eighth to your seven matters. It is like this: a couple of 

days ago, a Qur’an reciter read part of Sura Yusuf as far as,

( 12:101 ) Ç Æ Å Ä 
This point occurred to me in a ﬂash: everything concerning the Qur’an and 
belief is valuable; however insigniﬁcant a point appears to be, it has great 
value. Nothing that helps to win eternal happiness is insigniﬁcant. In which 
case, it may not be said that this is only a small point and not worth explain-
ing or being given importance. And certainly, the ﬁrst student and person 
addressed  in  matters  of  this  kind,  who  appreciates  the  ﬁne  points  of  the

340

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

Qur’an, Ibrahim Hulûsi, wants to hear this point! In which case, listen to it:
It is a ﬁne point about the ﬁnest of stories. An elevated, subtle, happy, and 

miraculous point of the verse, 

( 12:101 ) Ç Æ Å Ä 
which announces that the story of Joseph ( Upon whom be peace ), the best 
of  stories,  has  reached  its  conclusion.  It  is  this:  the  sorrows  of  death  and 
separation at the end of other happy stories sour the pleasure the listener has 
received from the story in his imagination, and dispel it. Especially if they 
describe death and separation just when recounting the moment of perfect 
joy and happiness; this is even more painful and causes those listening to cry 
out in sorrow. However, although this verse mentions Joseph’s death just at 
the most brilliant part of his story, when he is Ruler of Egypt, united with his 
mother and father, fondly meeting with his brothers, and is experiencing the 
greatest worldly happiness and joy, it does so in such a way as to say: Joseph 
himself asked Almighty Allah for his death in order to experience greater 
happiness and a more brilliant situation; and he did die and did receive that 
happiness. 

That is to say, there is beyond the grave a happiness and joy greater than 
the  pleasurable  happiness  of  this  world,  so  that  while  in  that  most  joyful 
worldly situation, a truth-seeing person like Joseph ( Upon whom be peace ) 
wished for bitter death, so as to receive that other happiness.

So note this eloquence of the All-Wise Qur’an, and the way it announces 
the end of the story of Joseph. It causes not sorrow and regret to those listen-
ing to it, but gives good tidings and adds further joy. It also gives guidance, 
saying: Work for beyond the grave, for it is there that true happiness and 
pleasure  will  be  found!  It  also  points  out  Joseph’s  exalted  veraciousness, 
saying:  Even  the  most  brilliant  and  joyful  situation  of  this  world  did  not 
cause him to become heedless; it did not captivate him; he still wanted the 
hereafter.

Q u e s t i o n :  How can the solicitous nurturing, the purposeful and beneﬁcial 
planning, the loving kindness of the names of All-Compassionate, All-Wise, 
and Loving, which are among the greatest of the divine names, be reconciled 
with death and non-existence, decline and separation, and disaster and hard-
ship, which are awesome and terrible? Very well, man goes to eternal hap-
piness so we can tolerate his passing down the road of death, but how about 
the delicate species of trees and plants, and the lovely ﬂowers, which are 
all living creatures, and the animal species, which are worthy of existence, 
lovers  of  life,  and  desire  permanent  life?  What  compassion  and  kindness 
are there in their continuously without exception being annihilated, in their 
being swiftly despatched to non-existence without being allowed to so much 
as open their eyes, in their being made to toil without so much as taking a 
breath, in their being changed by calamities with not one of them being left 
in peace, in their being killed without exception, in their dying with not one 
of them remaining, in their departing with none of them being gratiﬁed – 
what wisdom and purpose, what favour and mercy, are there in this?

T h e   A n s w e r :   Through  ﬁve  signs,  which  show  the  necessitating  cause

As is described at the end of the Twenty-Sixth Word, when making a pre-
cious garment, ornamented with jewels and embroidery, a skilful craftsman 
employs a poor man in return for a commensurate wage. In order to display 
his skill and art, he dresses the man in the garment, then measures and cuts 
it,  and  lengthens  and  shortens  it;  making  the  man  sit  down  and  stand  up, 
he gives it various forms. Does the wretched man have the right to say to 
the craftsman: “ Why are you meddling with this garment which makes me 
beautiful, altering and changing it? Why are you making me stand up and sit 
down, disturbing me and causing me trouble? ”

In  exactly  the  same  way,  in  order  to  display  the  perfections  of  His  art 
through the embroideries of His names, the All-Glorious Maker takes the 
essential  nature  of  beings  as  a  model,  then  He  clothes  them  all  and  espe-
cially living creatures in the garment of a body bejewelled with senses, and 
inscribes it with the pen of divine decree and determining, thus displaying 
the manifestation of His names. In addition, He gives to each one of them a 
perfection, a pleasure, an effulgence, in a way suitable to it and as a wage.

Does  anything  have  the  right,  then,  to  say  to  the  All-Glorious  Maker, 
ّر َ(cid:135)َ(cid:99)َ(cid:192)  ِكْ(cid:171)ُ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)ا  ُكِ(cid:170)اَ(cid:174)

What  falls  to  them  is,  by  offering  thanks  and  praise,  to  carry  out  what  is 
required by the degree of existence He has given them. For the degrees of 
existence that are given are occurrences, and each requires a cause. Degrees 
that are not given are possibilities, and possibilities are non-existent as well 
as  being  inﬁnite.  As  for  instances  of  non-existence,  they  do  not  require  a 
cause. For example, minerals cannot say: “ Why weren’t we plants? ”; they 
cannot complain. What falls to them is to offer thanks to their Creator for 
having been given mineral existence. And plants may not complain asking 
why they were not animals; what is due to them is to offer thanks, for they 
have received life as well as existence. As for animals, they cannot complain 

342

TWENTY-FOURTH LETTER – FIRST STATION

that they are not humans; what is incumbent on them, since they have been 
given the precious substance of spirit in addition to life and existence, is to 
offer thanks. And so on.

O querulous man! You did not remain non-existent; you were clothed in 
the  bounty  of  existence.  You  tasted  life;  you  neither  remained  inanimate, 
nor were made an animal. You received the bounty of Islam; you did not 
remain in misguidance. You have experienced the bounties of good health 
and well-being!

O  ungrateful  one!  Where  did  you  win  the  right  not  to  offer  thanks  in 
return for the degrees of existence Almighty Allah has given you as a pure 
bounty? How is it that because exalted bounties that are contingencies and 
non-existent and that you do not deserve have not been given you, you com-
plain about Almighty Allah with meaningless greed, and are ungrateful for 
the bounties you have received? If a man rises to an elevated position, such 
as climbing to the top of a minaret, and ﬁnds a high station, and on every 
step  receives  a  large  bounty,  then  does  not  thank  the  one  who  gave  him 
the bounties and complainingly asks why he did not rise even higher, how 
wrong he would be! What an ungrateful denial of the bounties, what a great 
foolishness it would be, as even a lunatic would understand!

O discontented greedy, thriftless wasteful, unjustly complaining, heed-
less  man!  Know  certainly  that  contentment  is  proﬁtable  thanks,  greed 
is  loss-causing  ingratitude,  and  frugality,  ﬁne  and  beneﬁcial  respect  for 
bounties. As for wastefulness, it is ugly and harmful contempt for boun-
ties. If you have any intelligence, accustom yourself to being content and 
try to be satisﬁed with little! If you cannot endure it, say: “ O Most Patient 
One! ”  and  request  patience.  Be  satisﬁed  with  your  lot  and  do  not  com-
plain! Understand who is complaining about whom, and be silent. If you 
have to complain, then complain about your soul to Allah Almighty, for 
that’s where the fault lies.

As  is  stated  at  the  end  of  the  last  matter  of  the  Eighteenth  Letter,  one 
instance of wisdom in the All-Glorious Creator’s constantly changing and 
renewing beings in an astonishing and awesome way through the activity of 
His dominicality is as follows:

Activity and motion in creatures arise from an appetite, a desire, a pleas-
ure, a love. It may be said that there is a sort of pleasure in all activity; or that 
activity is a sort of pleasure, even. Pleasure too is turned towards a perfection; 

344

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

indeed, it is a sort of perfection. Since activity indicates perfection, pleasure, 
beauty; and since the Necessarily Existent One, who is absolute perfection 
and the Perfect One of Glory, unites in His essence, attributes, and names 
every sort of perfection; for sure, in a manner ﬁtting for the necessary exist-
ence and holiness of the Necessarily Existent Essence, in a form suitable to 
His  absolute  riches  and  essential  self-sufﬁciency,  in  a  way  appropriate  to 
His absolute perfection and freedom from defect, He has a boundless sacred 
compassion and inﬁnite pure love. Of a certainty, there is an inﬁnite holy 
eagerness arising from that sacred compassion and pure love; and from that 
holy eagerness arises an inﬁnite sacred joy. And arising from that sacred joy, 
is, if the term is permissible, an inﬁnite holy pleasure. And from this holy 
pleasure  and  from  the  gratitude  and  perfections  of  creatures  which  result 
from the emergence and unfolding of their potentialities within the activity 
of His power, arise, if one may say so, an inﬁnite sacred gratiﬁcation and 
holy  pride  pertaining  to  that  Most  Merciful  and  Compassionate  Essence. 
It  is  these  that  necessitate  a  boundless  activity.  And  that  boundless  activ-
ity in turn necessitates boundless change and transformation, alteration and 
destruction. And the boundless change and transformation necessitate death 
and extinction, decline and separation.

At one time, the beneﬁts shown by human science and philosophy 1 con-
cerning  the  aims  of  beings  appeared  to  me  to  be  extremely  insigniﬁcant. 
I  understood  from  this  that  such  philosophy  leads  only  to  futility.  Conse-
quently, leading philosophers either fall into the swamp of nature, or they 
become Sophists, or they deny divine knowledge and choice, or they call the 
Creator “ self-necessitating. ”

At  that  point,  divine  mercy  sent  the  name  All-Wise  to  my  aid,  and  it 
showed me the great aims of creatures. That is to say, every creature, every 
artefact, is a dominical missive for conscious beings to study. This aim sat-
isﬁed me for a year. Then the wonders in the art of beings were unfolded 
to me, and the former aim began to seem deﬁcient. Another, much greater 
aim  became  apparent,  which  was  that  the  main  aims  of  creatures  look  to 
their Maker. I understood that it consists of creatures’ presenting to His gaze 
the  perfections  of  His  art,  the  embroideries  of  His  names,  the  embellish-
ments of His wisdom, and the gifts of His mercy; it is their being mirrors to 
His beauty and perfections. This aim satisﬁed me for a long time, then the

miracles of divine power and attributes of dominicality ( ş u û n â t - ı   r u b û b i y e t  ) 
in the extremely swift changes and transformations within the astonishing 
activity in the art and creation of things became apparent. The former aim 
too began to appear insufﬁcient. I understood that a necessitating cause, a 
motive, was necessary as great as that latter aim. It was then that the causes 
in this second Sign and the aims in the Indications to follow became appar-
ent. It was made known to me with complete certainty that the activity of 
divine power in the universe and the constant ﬂood of beings are so mean-
ingful that through them the All-Wise Maker causes all the realms of beings 
in the universe to speak. It is as if the beings of the earth and the skies and 
their motion and actions are the words of their speech; their motion is their 
speech. That is, the motion and decline arising from activity is speech glori-
fying Allah. The activity in the universe is the universe’s silent speech and 
that of the varieties of its beings; their being made to speak.

Third Sign

THIRD SIGN

Things  do  not  go  to  non-existence,  they  rather  pass  from  the  realm  of 
power to the realm of knowledge; they go from the Manifest World to the 
World of the Unseen; they turn from the world of change and transience to 
the worlds of light and eternity. In reality, the beauty and perfection in things 
pertain to the divine names and are their impresses and manifestations. Since 
the  names  are  eternal  and  their  manifestations,  perpetual,  certainly  their 
impresses  will  be  renewed,  refreshed,  and  made  beautiful.  Things  do  not 
vanish into non-existence; their relative determinations change; their reali-
ties, essences, and identities, from which spring their beauty and loveliness, 
effulgence and perfection, are enduring. 

The beauty of beings with no spirits pertain directly to the divine names; 
the honour is theirs; praise is due to them; the beauty is theirs; love goes to 
them; they suffer no harm on those mirrors changing.

For beings with spirits but no intellect, death is not a departure for extinc-
tion, a vanishing into non-existence; it is to be saved from physical existence 
and the turbulent duties of life. The beings make over the fruits of the duties 
they have performed to their spirits. Relying on a divine name, their immor-
tal spirits persist; indeed, they attain a happiness worthy of them. 

For beings that possess both spirit and intellect, death is anyway a jour-
neying to everlasting happiness, to the eternal realm, which is a spring of 
perfections, material and non-material, and to such other dwelling-places of 
the All-Wise Maker as the Intermediate Realm, the World of Similitudes, 

346

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

and the Spirit World, which all surpass this world in beauty and luminosity. 
Their passing does not lead to their death and extinction, separation and non-
existence, but to their attaining perfection.

I n   S h o r t :   Since  the  All-Glorious  Maker  exists  and  He  is  Eternal,  and 
since His attributes and names are perpetual and everlasting; certainly His 
names’ manifestations and impresses are renewed, affording them a sort of 
perpetualness;  they  are  not  destroyed  and  do  not  just  disappear;  they  are 
not ephemeral and despatched to non-being. It is clear that by reason of his 
humanity, man is connected with most other beings; he receives pleasure at 
their happiness and is grieved at their destruction. He feels more grief at the 
suffering  of  living  creatures,  of  humankind  in  particular,  and  particularly 
the people of perfection he loves and admires; and his happiness is greater 
at their happiness. Like a fond mother, he even sacriﬁces his own happiness 
and comfort for theirs. Thus, through the light of the Qur’an and mystery of 
belief, all believers – in accordance with their degree – may be happy at the 
happiness of other beings, and at their continued existence and being saved 
from  nothingness  and  their  being  valuable  dominical  missives;  they  may 
gain a light as extensive as the world. Everyone may proﬁt from this light 
according  to  his  degree.  As  for  the  people  of  misguidance,  in  addition  to 
their own pains they are grieved at the destruction of beings, at their transi-
ence and apparently being despatched to non-existence – and if they have 
spirits, at their suffering. That is to say, their unbelief ﬁlls their world with 
non-existence; it empties it over their heads, causing them hell before they 
go there.

As  we  have  said  in  many  places,  a  monarch  has  various  ofﬁces  and 
departments  proceeding  from  such  titles  of  his  as  Sultan,  K h a l i f a ,  Judge, 
and Commander-in-Chief. In the same way, Almighty Allah’s Most Beauti-
ful Names have innumerable different sorts of manifestations. All the dif-
ferent sorts of creatures arise from the varieties of manifestations. Thus, by 
virtue of the fact that every possessor of beauty and perfection has an innate 
desire to see and display his beauty and perfection, the names – since they 
are  constant  and  eternal  –  want  to  be  displayed  in  permanent  fashion  on 
account of the Most Pure and Holy Essence. That is to say, they want to see 
their impresses; that is, to see in the mirrors of their embroideries the mani-
festation of their beauty and reﬂection of their perfection; that is, to renew 
every instant the mighty book of the universe and the multifarious missives

of beings; that is, to constantly write them anew; that is, to write thousands 
of  different  missives  on  a  single  page  and  to  display  each  missive  to  the 
witnessing gaze of the Sacred Essence, the Most Pure and Holy One, who is 
signiﬁed; and in addition, to exhibit them to the meditative gazes of sentient 
beings, and to cause them to read them. Consider the following poem, which 
alludes to this truth:

Fifth Sign

FIFTH SIGN

First Point

The ﬁfth Sign consists of two points.
F i r s t   P o i n t :  Since Almighty Allah exists, everything exists. Since they 
have  a  relation  with  Almighty  Allah,  all  things  exist  for  everything.  For 
through  the  mystery  of  unity,  through  their  relation  with  the  Necessarily 
Existent One, all beings become connected with all other beings. This means 
that through the mystery of unity, every being that knows its relation with 
the  Necessarily  Existent  One,  or  whose  relation  is  known,  becomes  con-
nected to all beings since they are connected to  Him. This means that by 
virtue of that relation, all beings may manifest endless lights of existence. 
In that respect, for them there is no separation or death. To live for a single 
passing second yields innumerable lights of existence. Whereas if there is no 
such relation or it is not known, the being or person manifests inﬁnite sepa-
rations and deaths. For in the face of every being with which he could have 
been connected, he is exposed to a separation, a parting, a death. That is, he 
burdens his personal existence with endless instances of non-existence and 
separation. If he were to remain in existence for a million years even ( with-
out connection ), it would not be equal to living for an instant with the rela-
tion mentioned above. The people of reality ( e h l - i   h a k i k a t  ) have said there-
fore:  “ Illumined  existence  for  a  passing  instant  is  preferable  to  a  million 
years of proﬁtless existence. ” It is also because of this that veriﬁers of the 
realities ( e h l - i   t a h k i k  ) have said: “ The lights of existence become apparent 
through recognizing the Necessarily Existent One. ” That is to say: the uni-
verse is seen to be full of angels, spirit beings, and intelligent beings, bathed 
in lights of existence. Whereas without them, the darkness of non-existence 

348

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

and pains of death and separation encompass all beings. In such a view, the 
world appears to be an empty, desolate wasteland.

Indeed, all the fruits of a tree have a relation with all the other fruits, and 
since through the relation they are all friends and brothers, each possesses 
accidental existences to their number. But if one of the fruits is plucked from 
the tree, it suffers a separation and death in the face of all the other fruits; 
they  all  become  as  though  non-existent  for  it;  it  remains  in  the  resulting 
darkness of external non-existence.

In exactly the same way, in so far as they are connected to the power of 
the  Single  Eternally  Besoughted  One,  all  things  exist  for  everything.  The 
absence of such a relation results for all things in external non-existences to 
the number of things.

So see from this Sign the vastness of the lights of belief and the terrify-
ing darkness of misguidance. That is, belief is the mark of the elevated truth 
described in this Sign; and it may be beneﬁted from through belief. In the 
absence of belief, just as for someone who is blind, deaf, dumb, and stupid 
everything is non-existent, so is everything non-existent and dark for one 
without belief.

Second Point

S e c o n d   P o i n t :  The world and all things have three faces:
The  First  Face  looks  to  the  divine  names  and  is  their  mirror.  Death, 
separation, and non-existence cannot intrude on this face; it rather manifests 
renewal and remaking afresh.

The  Second  Face  looks  to  the  hereafter  and  gazes  upon  the  World  of 
Eternity; it is its arable ﬁeld. Here, enduring fruits and produce are raised. It 
serves eternity and makes ephemeral things as though eternal. On this face 
too there is no death and decline, but the manifestations of life and eternity.
The Third Face looks to transient beings, that is, to us. It is the beloved 
of ephemeral beings and those who follow the caprices of their souls; the 
place of trade for the conscious; the arena of trial and examination for those 
charged with duties. Thus, the salve and cure for the pains and wounds of 
the transience and decline, the death and extinction, on this third face, are the 
manifestations of life and eternity in its inner face.

I n   S h o r t :  This ﬂood of beings, these travelling creatures, are roving mir-
rors and ever-changing places of manifestation for the renewal of the Neces-
sarily Existent One’s lights of creation and existence.

Second Station

Introduction

First Topic

[ The Second Station consists of an introduction and ﬁve indications. 
The introduction contains two topics. ]

F i r s t   T o p i c :  In each of the following ﬁve Indications is a comparison, 
written in the form of a dull, short-ranged telescope with which to observe 
the attributes of dominicality. The comparisons cannot contain the reality of 
those attributes; they cannot encompass them and be the measure of them, 
but  they  can  assist  in  looking  at  them.  Any  phrases  or  expressions  in  the 
comparisons, or in the previous Signs, unﬁtting for the attributes of the Most 
Pure and Holy Essence are the fault of the comparisons.

For example, the meanings of pleasure, joy, and gratiﬁcation known by 
us cannot express the sacred attributes; each rather indicates an observatory 
and is an aid to reﬂective thought. Also, by showing in a small example the 
tip of an encompassing, mighty law of dominicality, each proves the reality 
of the law present in the attributes of dominicality. For example, it is said 
that a ﬂower departs from existence leaving thousands of existences behind 
it. This demonstrates a mighty law of dominicality that is in force in all the 
beings of spring, indeed, of all the world.

Yes, through whichever law the All-Compassionate Creator changes and 
renews  the  feathered  dress  of  a  bird,  through  the  same  law  that  All-Wise 
Maker renews the dress of the globe of the earth every year. Through the 
same law, He transforms the shape of the world every century. And through 
the same law, He will change the form of the universe at the resurrection of 
the dead.

Through whichever law He impels particles like Mevlevi dervishes, He 
makes the earth spin through the same law, like an ecstatic Mevlevi dervish 
rising  up  to  dance  the  s a m a ‘ .  And  through  that  law,  He  causes  worlds  to 
revolve, and the solar system to travel through space.

Through whichever law He renews, repairs, and dissolves the particles in 
your body’s cells, through the same law He renews your garden every year, 
making it anew many times every season. And through the same law, He 
renews the face of the earth every spring, drawing a fresh veil over its face.
Through  whichever  law  that  All-Powerful  Maker  raises  a  ﬂy  to  life, 
through the same law He restores to life the plane-tree opposite your win-
dow every spring; and through that law, He raises the globe of the earth to 

349

350

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

life in the spring; and through the same law He will raise creatures to life at 
the resurrection. The Qur’an alludes to this with the verse,

( 31:28 ) â á à ß Þ Ý Ü
And so on; you can make further examples in the same way.

There are many laws of dominicality like these which are in force from 
particles to the totality of the world. Consider the immensity of these laws 
within dominical activity; note carefully their breadth and see the meaning 
of unity within them. Understand that each law is a proof of divine unity. 
Yes, since all these numerous and immense laws are the manifestations of 
knowledge and will, and since they are both the same and all-encompassing, 
they offer certain proof for the Maker’s unity, knowledge, and will. 

Thus, most of the comparisons in the Wo r d s  show through small exam-
ples the tips of laws like these, and by doing so, point to the existence of 
the same law in the matter claimed. Since the existence of the law is dem-
onstrated through a comparison, it proves the assertion as categorically as a 
logical proof. That is to say, most of the comparisons in the Wo r d s  should be 
considered categorical proofs and certain arguments.

Second Topic

S e c o n d   T o p i c :   As  is  described  in  the  Tenth  Truth  of  the  Tenth  Word, 
however many ﬂowers and fruits there are on a tree, each of them has aims, 
purposes, and instances of wisdom to that number. These instances of wis-
dom are of three sorts:

One sort looks to the Maker and displays the embroideries of His names.
Another sort looks to intelligent and conscious beings, and in their view, 

things are valuable missives and meaningful words.

Another sort looks to the being itself and to its own life and perpetua-
tion; and if beneﬁcial for man, it contains instances of wisdom accordingly.
At  one  time,  while  contemplating  how  all  beings  have  such  numerous 
aims, the following phrases occurred to me in Arabic, which, like notes form-
ing the basis of the following Indications, allude to those universal aims:

and ten sorts of aims pointed out in the ﬁve Indications, acquire true faith. 
Otherwise, in addition to being deprived of all of them, you will be squeezed 
into that seed and you will rot!

This  section  expresses  the  following:  although  a  being  apparently  dis-
appears  into  non-existence  after  departing  from  [ external ]  existence,  the 
meanings it has expressed are preserved and perpetuated. Its identity, form, 
and essential nature also are preserved in the World of Similitudes, on the 
Preserved Tablets, which are samples of the World of Similitudes, and in 
memories, which are samples of the Preserved Tablets. That is, the being 
loses its visible existence and gains hundreds of immaterial existences and 
existences in knowledge.

For example, in order to print a page in a printing-press, the type is set up 
and arranged. Then after the page has bequeathed its form and identity on 
many pages when printed and after it has proclaimed its meanings to many 
minds, the arrangement of the type is changed. For no need remains for it 
and other pages have to be printed.

In  exactly  the  same  way,  the  pen  of  divine  determining  sets  up  and 
arranges  the  beings  of  the  earth,  especially  plants.  Divine  power  creates 
them on the page of the springtime. Then in order for them to express their 
beautiful  meanings  and  for  their  forms  and  identities  to  pass  to  the  ledg-
ers  of  the  World  of  the  Unseen,  for  instance  the  World  of  Similitudes,

divine wisdom requires that the arrangement be changed. In this way, the 
page of another, future spring may be written and its beings express their 
meanings too.

This  section  shows  that  before  departing  from  existence,  everything, 
whether particular or universal, and especially living beings, produces many 
truths pertaining to the Unseen. So too they leave behind them on the tablets 
and notebooks of the World of Similitudes forms to the number of the stages 
of their lives. Their life histories and those of their forms that are meaningful 
are inscribed and become objects of study for spirit beings. 

For example, a ﬂower passes from existence, but together with leaving 
behind its essential nature in its hundreds of seeds, it leaves thousands of its 
forms on small Preserved Tablets and in memories, which are small samples 
of the Preserved Tablets. And throughout the stages of its life it causes con-
scious beings to study the embroideries of the divine names and the domini-
cal gloriﬁcations it expresses; then it departs.

Similarly, the springtime is a ﬂower adorned with ﬁnely wrought beings 
in the ﬂower-pot of the face of the earth; it apparently dies and departs for 
non-existence, but in its place it leaves behind in existence the truths pertain-
ing to the Unseen it has expressed to the number of its seeds, and identities 
in the World of Similitudes it has published to the number of its ﬂowers, 
and  the  instances  of  dominical  wisdom  it  has  displayed  to  the  number  of 
its beings; only then is it hidden from us. Moreover, it makes room for its 
friends, other springs, to come and perform their duties. That is to say, the 
spring is divested of an external existence, and in meaning is clothed in a 
thousand existences.

This section states that the world is a workbench and an arable ﬁeld rais-
ing crops suitable for the market of the hereafter. We have proved in many 
of the Wo r d s  that just as jinn and men send their actions to the market of the 
hereafter, so too the other beings in the world perform numerous duties on 
account of the hereafter and produce many crops for it. It may even be said 
that the earth travels for them, or even that this is its purpose. This dominical

ship  traverses  a  twenty-four  thousand  year  distance  in  one  year,  circum-
scribing the ﬁeld of the resurrection.

For example, the people of Paradise will surely wish to recall their adven-
tures in this world and recount them to one another. They will be exceed-
ingly curious to see the images and pictures of those adventures, and they 
will  enjoy  it  immensely  if  they  can  watch  them  like  watching  a  cinema 
screen. Consequently, as the verse, 

( 15:47 ) º ¹ ¸ 
indicates, in Paradise, the realm of delight and happiness, worldly adven-
tures and scenes of worldly happenings will be recalled, amid everlasting 
panoramas.

Thus, the beautiful beings of this world appearing for a moment then dis-
appearing, and following on one after the other in succession, appear to be 
factories and workshops manufacturing the vistas of eternity. For example, 
in order to give ﬂeeting situations a permanence and leave souvenirs for the 
people of the future, the people of present-day civilization record the images 
of beautiful or strange happenings and present them as gifts to the future by 
means of the cinema screen; they show the past in the present and the future, 
and include it in them.

In  just  the  same  way,  the  All-Wise  Maker  of  the  beings  of  spring  and 
this world records the aims of their brief lives, which look to the World of 
Eternity, in that world. He records in everlasting scenes in the Eternal Realm 
the vital duties and the divine miracles they have performed throughout the 
stages of their lives, as required by His names All-Wise, All-Compassion-
ate, and Loving.

This section states that throughout the stages of their lives, beings per-
form numerous varieties of dominical gloriﬁcations. They also display vari-
ous situations that the divine names necessitate and require. For example, 
the  name  of  All-Compassionate  desires  to  be  compassionate.  The  name 
Provider necessitates the giving of sustenance. The name Gracious requires 
the granting of favours. And so on; all the divine names require and neces-
sitate something. Thus, in addition to demonstrating the requirements of the 
names through their lives and existences, all living beings glorify the All-
Wise Maker to the number of their members and faculties.

For example, a man eats delicious fruits which are then dissolved in his 
stomach  and  apparently  destroyed,  but  they  both  produce  a  pleasure  and 
eagerness  arising  from  activity  in  all  the  cells  of  his  body  as  well  as  his 
mouth and stomach, and comprise very many instances of wisdom like nur-
turing his life and every part of his body and causing his life to continue. 
And the food itself rises from vegetable existence to the level of human life; 
it progresses.

In exactly the same way, when beings are hidden behind the veil of death, 
in addition to their very many gloriﬁcations enduring in their places, they 
bequeath to the divine names many of the names’ embroideries and require-
ments. That is to say, they depart entrusting them to an eternal existence. If, 
then, when a transient and temporary existence departs thousands of exist-
ences manifesting a sort of permanence remain in its place, can it be said 
that the thing is to be pitied, or that it was all for nothing, or why did that 
lovable creature depart; can it be complained about? For the mercy, wisdom, 
and love that look to it required and necessitated it to be thus. Otherwise 
thousands  of  beneﬁts  would  have  to  be  abandoned  so  that  a  single  harm 
would  not  come  about;  in  which  case  the  harm  would  be  a  thousandfold. 
That is to say, the names All-Compassionate, All-Wise, and Loving One are 
not opposed to death and separation; indeed, they require and necessitate it.

This section states that on departing from visible existence, beings, and 
particularly  living  beings,  leave  behind  them  many  enduring  things.  As 
described in the Second Sign, among the attributes of dominicality (   ş u û n â t - ı  
r u b û b i y e t   )  – in a way beﬁtting the sacredness and perfect self-sufﬁciency 
of the Necessarily Existent Essence and in a form worthy of Him – are a 
boundless love, an inﬁnite compassion, an endless pride, and, if the term is 
permissible, a boundless holy pleasure, a joy, and if the expression is not 
mistaken, an inﬁnite sacred delight, and a transcendent happiness; the traces 
of which are to be observed and seen. 

Yes, through change and transformation, decline and transience, beings 
are driven on at speed within the astonishing activity necessitated by these 
attributes; they are constantly sent from the Manifest World to the World 
of  the  Hereafter.  Under  the  manifestations  of  the  attributes,  creatures  are 
shaken up in a continual ﬂow and ﬂood, motion and movement, scattering 
to the ears of the heedless the lamentations of death and separation, and to 

TWENTY-FOURTH LETTER – SECOND STATION

the hearing of the people of guidance a clamour of gloriﬁcation and recital 
of Allah’s names. It is by virtue of this mystery that all beings depart leav-
ing behind them in existence meanings, qualities, and states which will each 
be a means to the manifestation of the Necessarily Existent One’s eternal 
attributes.

Furthermore,  beings  depart  leaving  behind  them  the  stages  and  states 
they have undergone throughout their lives – a detailed existence which rep-
resents their external existence – on the Preserved Tablet, and in the Clear 
Book and Clear Record, and other spheres of existence like these that pertain 
to divine knowledge. This means that every transitory being abandons one 
existence and gains thousands of permanent existences. 

For example, a number of common substances are thrown into a wondrous 
machine in a factory; they burn up inside it and are apparently destroyed, but 
in those vats valuable chemical substances are precipitated. Also, through 
its force and steam, the factory’s machinery works: in one area of it textiles 
are woven, in another books are printed, while in another sweets and other 
rare confections are manufactured; and so on; it produces these. That is to 
say, thousands of things come into existence through the burning of those 
common substances and their apparent destruction. One common existence 
departs but leaves a legacy of numerous elevated existences. Can one there-
fore feel sorry for the common substance? Can one complain about the fac-
tory owner because he did not pity it and burnt it, destroying those lovable 
substances?

Similarly,  ( 16:60 )   j  i  h  as  necessitated  by  mercy,  wisdom, 
and  lovingness,  the  Wise,  Compassionate,  and  Loving  Creator  causes  the 
factory of the universe to work. He makes all transient existences the seeds 
of numerous perpetual existences; He makes them the means for the fulﬁl-
ment of the dominical aims; He makes them manifest the divine attributes; 
He makes them the ink for the pen of divine determining and shuttles for the 
weaving of divine power; and for many elevated aims and favours that we 
do not yet know, through the activity of His power He causes the activity of 
the universe; He causes particles to spin, beings to travel, animals to ﬂow, 
and the planets to rotate; He makes the universe speak, causing it to silently 
recite His verses, His signs, and to inscribe them. And of the creatures of 
the earth – with regard to His dominicality – He makes the air a throne for 
His command and will; the element of light a throne for His knowledge and 
wisdom; water a throne for His bounty and mercy; and earth a throne for His 
preservation and giving of life; and three of these thrones He rests on the 
creatures of the earth.

Know  certainly  that  the  shining  truth  demonstrated  in  these  ﬁve  Signs 
and ﬁve Indications is to be seen through the light of the Qur’an and may 
be laid claim to through the strength of belief. Otherwise a terrifying dark-
ness takes the place of this enduring truth. For the people of misguidance, 
the world is full to overﬂowing with deaths, separations, and non-existence; 
for them, the universe is a sort of Hell. Everything has only a ﬂash of exist-
ence and is surrounded by never-ending non-being. The past and the future 
are ﬁlled with the darkness of non-existence; they may ﬁnd a sad light of 
existence only in the ﬂeeting present. However, through the mystery of the 
Qur’an and the light of belief, a light of existence becomes apparent which 
shines from pre-eternity to post-eternity; believers are connected with that, 
and through it secure eternal happiness.

Listen now to ﬁve points concerning this verse.

First Point

First Point

Supplication is a mighty mystery of worship; indeed, it is as though the 
spirit of worship. As we have mentioned in many places, supplication is of 
three sorts.

The  First  Sort  of  Supplication:  This  is  the  tongue  of  latent  abil-
ity.  Through  it  all  seeds  and  grains  supplicate  the  All-Wise  Creator,  say-
ing: “ Make us grow! Make our tiny truths sprout and transform us into the 
mighty reality of a tree, so that we may display the elaborate embroideries 
of Your names! ”

Another sort of supplication through the tongue of latent ability is this: 
the  gathering  together  of  causes  is  a  supplication  for  the  creation  of  the 
effect. That is to say, the causes take up a position whereby they resemble 
a tongue of disposition through which they beseech the effect from the All-
Powerful One of Glory. For example, water, heat, earth, and light take up 
positions around a seed, and their doing this constitutes a tongue of supplica-
tion which says: “ O Our Creator, make this seed into a tree! ” For the tree, a 
wonderful miracle of power, cannot be attributed to those unconscious, life-
less, simple substances; that would be impossible. This means the coming 
together of causes is a sort of supplication.

358

TWENTY-FOURTH LETTER – THE FIRST ADDENDUM

359

The Second Sort of Supplication: This is through the tongue of innate 
need.  It  is  the  supplication  made  by  all  living  creatures  to  the  All-Com-
passionate Creator to give them the things they need and desire, which are 
beyond  their  power  and  will,  from  unexpected  places,  at  the  appropriate 
time. For an All-Wise and Compassionate One sends them all these things 
at the right time, from places they do not know. They are beyond their reach. 
That is to say, the bestowal is the result of supplication.

I n   S h o r t :  All that rises to the divine court from the universe is a supplica-

tion. Those things that are causes seek the effects from Allah.

The Third Sort of Supplication: This is the supplication of conscious 
beings, which arises from need. It is of two kinds: If it is made at a time of 
desperate  need,  or  is  completely  conformable  with  innate  need,  or  if  it  is 
close to the tongue of latent ability, or is made with the tongue of a pure, 
sincere  heart,  this  supplication  is  virtually  always  acceptable.  The  greater 
part of human progress and most discoveries are the result of this sort of sup-
plication. For the things they call the wonders of civilization and the matters 
and discoveries they take pride in are the result of what is in effect supplica-
tion. They were asked for with a sincere tongue of latent ability and so were 
given. So long as there is nothing preventing them and they are conformable 
with conditions, supplications made through the tongues of latent ability and 
innate need are always acceptable.

T h e   S e c o n d   K i n d :   This  is  the  well-known  supplication  and  it  too  is  of 
two kinds. One is by action and the other by word. For example, ploughing 
is supplication by action. It is not seeking the sustenance from the earth; the 
earth is a door to a treasury of mercy, and the plough knocks on the earth, 
the door to divine mercy.

We shall skip details of the remaining sorts, and explain in the following 

two or three points one or two of the secrets of supplication by word.

Second Point

Second Point

Supplication  has  a  powerful  effect.  It  almost  always  yields  results, 
indeed, its results are continuous, especially if it gains universality and is 
constant. It may even be said that supplication was one of the reasons for the 
world’s creation. That is to say, the supplications of chieﬂy mankind, and of 
them principally the Islamic world, and mainly the sublime supplications of 
Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) were a cause 
of  the  universe’s  creation.  That  is  to  say,  the  Creator  of  the  World  knew 
that in the future Muhammad ( UWBP ) would ask for eternal happiness and 

360

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

for a manifestation of the divine names in the name of mankind, indeed, on 
account of all beings, and He accepted that future supplicaton and created 
the universe.

Since  supplication  possesses  this  great  importance  and  capacity,  is  it 
at all possible that the supplications offered all the time for one thousand 
three hundred and ﬁfty years by three hundred million of mankind and by 
uncountable numbers of blessed beings from among men, jinn, angels, and 
spirit beings for the bestowal of supreme divine mercy and eternal happiness 
on the Person of Muhammad ( UWBP ), and for the accomplishment of their 
aims would not be accepted? Is it in any way possible that their supplications 
would be rejected?

Since all these supplications have acquired universality, extensiveness, 
and continuousness to this extent and have reached the level of the tongues 
of latent ability and innate need, for sure, as a result of them, Muhammad 
the Arabian ( UWBP ) has achieved such a rank and degree that if all minds 
were to gather together and become one mind, it could not completely com-
prehend it.

O Muslims! This is the intercessor you shall have on the Day of Resurrec-
tion! So if you want to attract his intercession, follow his practices ( S u n n a  )!
I f   y o u   a s k :  Since he is Allah’s Beloved, what need does he have of all 

these blessings and supplications?

T h e   A n s w e r :  This Being ( UWBP ) is concerned with the happiness of 
all his community and shares in the good fortune of each of its members. 
So too, he is disturbed by all their tribulations. For sure, the degrees of his 
own happiness and perfection are endless, but since he desires ardently the 
numberless kinds of happiness for the numberless members of his commu-
nity for an unlimited time, and is saddened at the numberless kinds of their 
wretchedness, he is surely worthy of and needy for endless blessings and 
supplications and mercy.

I f   y o u   a s k :  Sometimes supplications are offered for things that are deﬁ-
nite; for example, the supplications in the prayers offered during lunar and 
solar eclipses. Also, sometimes supplications are made for things that will 
never come about. What does this mean?

T h e   A n s w e r :  As is explained in others of the Wo r d s , supplication is wor-
ship. By means of it, Allah’s servant proclaims his powerlessness and want. 
The apparent purposes mark the times of the supplication and the supplica-
tory worship; they are not really the purpose. The purpose of worship and its 

TWENTY-FOURTH LETTER – THE FIRST ADDENDUM

361

beneﬁts look to the hereafter. If its worldly aims are not obtained, it should 
not be said that the supplication was not accepted, but that the time for it has 
not yet ended.

Also, is it at all possible that eternal happiness, which all the believers 
have asked for at all times, continuously, with complete sincerity and yearn-
ing and entreaty, should not be given to them, and that the Absolutely Gen-
erous One, the Absolutely Compassionate One, who according to the tes-
timony of the universe possesses boundless mercy, should not accept their 
supplications and that eternal happiness should not exist?

Third Point

Third Point

There are two ways in which voluntary supplication by word is accept-

able. It is either accepted exactly as desired or what is better is granted. 

For  example,  someone  asks  for  a  son  and  Almighty  Allah  bestows 
a  daughter  like  Mary.  One  should  not  say  that  his  supplication  was  not 
accepted, but that it was accepted in a better way.

Also,  sometimes  a  person  makes  supplication  for  his  happiness  in  this 
world and it is accepted for the hereafter. One should not say that his sup-
plication was rejected, but that it was accepted in a better form. Similarly, 
Almighty Allah is All-Wise; we seek from Him and He responds to us. But 
He deals with us in accordance with His wisdom.

A sick person should not cast aspersions on his doctor’s wisdom. If he 
asks for honey and the expert doctor gives him quinine, he should not say: 
“ The doctor didn’t listen to me. ” For the doctor listened to his sighs and 
moans; he heard them and responded to them. He prescribed something bet-
ter than what was asked for.

Fourth Point

Fourth Point

The best, ﬁnest, sweetest, most immediate fruit and result of supplica-
tion is this, that the person who offers it knows there is someone who listens 
to his voice, sends a remedy for his ailment, takes pity on him, and whose 
hand of power reaches everything. He is not alone in this great hostel of the 
world;  there  is  an  All-Generous  Being  who  looks  after  him  and  makes  it 
friendly. Imagining himself in the presence of the One who can bring about 
all  his  needs  and  repulse  all  his  innumerable  enemies,  he  feels  a  joy  and 
relief; he casts off his load, which is as heavy as the world, and exclaims:

Supplication is the spirit of worship and results from sincere belief. For 
the person who makes supplication shows that there is someone who rules 
the whole universe, saying: “ He knows the least signiﬁcant things about me, 
can bring about my farthest aims; who sees every circumstance of mine, and 
hears my voice. He hears the voices of all beings, and He hears my voice 
too. He does all these things, so I await my smallest needs from Him too. I 
ask Him for them! ” 

See the extensive, sincere belief in Allah’s unity that supplication gives, 
and the sweetness and purity of the light of belief that it shows! Understand

First Point

First Point

Süleyman Efendi, in the M e v l i d  which he wrote, recounts a sad love story 
about Buraq, which was brought from Paradise. Since Süleyman Efendi was 
one of the saints and the story is based on narrations, it must surely express 
a truth.

The truth of the matter must be this: the creatures of the Eternal Realm are 
closely connected with the light of Allah’s Most Noble Messenger ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ). For it is through the light that he brought 
that Paradise and the world of the hereafter will be inhabited by mankind 
and the jinn. If it had not been for him, there would have been no eternal 
happiness, and mankind and the jinn, who have the ability to beneﬁt from all

hammad ( UWBP ) written by Süleyman Çelebi, who died in Bursa 780/1378.

the creatures of Paradise, would not have dwelt there; in that sense it would 
have remained empty, a wasteland. 

As is explained in the Fourth Branch of the Twenty-Fourth Word, a sort 
of nightingale has been chosen from each of the animal species to proclaim 
the intense need of the species – and passion even – for the caravans of 
plant species which, proceeding from the treasury of mercy, bear their pro-
visions. The chief of these are the nightingale and the rose. The songs of 
these dominical orators, and the love-song of the nightingale for the rose, 
are a welcoming, an applause, glorifying Allah, before the most beautiful 
of the plants. 

Similarly,  Gabriel  ( Upon  whom  be  peace ),  one  of  the  angels,  served 
with perfect love Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ), who was the reason for the creation of the spheres, the cause of hap-
piness in this world and the next, and the beloved of the Sustainer of All the 
Worlds. He thus demonstrated the obedience and submission of the angels 
to Adam ( Upon whom be peace ) and the reason for their prostrating before 
him. Similarly, the people of Paradise – and some of its animals even – feel 
a connection with Muhammad ( UWBP ), and this found expression in the 
passionate feelings of Buraq, whom he mounted.

Second Point

Second Point

One  of  the  adventures  during  the  Ascension  concerned  Almighty 
Allah’s  transcendent  love  for  His  Most  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom 
be blessings and peace ), which was expressed by the phrase: “ I am your 
lover. ” In its common meaning, such words are inappropriate for the Nec-
essarily Existent One’s holiness and His essential self-sufﬁciency. Süley-
man Efendi’s  M e v l i d  has enjoyed great popularity; it may be understood 
from this that, as one of the people of sainthood and reality, his allusion is 
correct. Its meaning is this:

The Necessarily Existent One possesses inﬁnite beauty and perfection, 
for all the varieties of them dispersed through the universe are the signs and 
indications of His beauty and perfection. Those who possess beauty and per-
fection clearly love them. Similarly, the All-Glorious One greatly loves His 
beauty, and He loves it in a way that beﬁts Himself. Furthermore, He loves 
His names, which are the rays of His beauty, and since He loves them, He 
surely loves His art, which displays their beauty. In which case, He also loves 
His creatures, which are mirrors reﬂecting His beauty and perfection. Since 
He loves the creatures that display them, He certainly loves the creatures’ 

TWENTY-FOURTH LETTER – THE SECOND ADDENDUM

365

ﬁne qualities, which point to the beauty and perfection of His names. The 
All-Wise Qur’an alludes to these ﬁve sorts of love with its verses.

Thus, since the Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and 

peace ) was the most perfect of creatures and the most excellent of beings;

And since he displayed and applauded divine art with a clamour of glori-

ﬁcation and recitation of Allah’s names;

And since he opened through the tongue of the Qur’an the treasuries of 

beauty and perfection found in the names;

And since, through the tongue of the Qur’an he expounded brilliantly and 
compellingly the evidences for the Maker’s perfection in the creational signs 
of the universe;

And since through his universal worship he acted as a mirror to divine 

dominicality;

And since through the comprehensiveness of his essential nature he was 

the most perfect locus for the manifestation of all the divine names;

It surely may be said that since the All-Beauteous One of Glory loves His 
own beauty, He loves Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom be blessings 
and peace ), the most perfectly conscious mirror to His beauty. And since He 
loves His names, He loves Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom be bless-
ings  and  peace ),  who  was  the  most  brilliant  mirror  to  the  names,  and  He 
loves those who, according to their degree, resemble him.

And since He loves His art, He certainly loves Muhammad the Ara-
bian ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), who proclaimed His art to 
the universe in reverberating voice, making it ring in the ears of the heav-
ens, and who with a tumult of gloriﬁcation and recitation of the divine 
praises, brought to ecstasy the land and the sea; and He loves too those 
who follow him.

And since He loves His artefacts, He loves living beings, the most perfect 
of His artefacts, and intelligent beings, the most perfect of living beings, and 
human beings, the most superior of intelligent beings, and He surely loves 
most of all Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), 
who as is agreed by all was the most perfect of human beings.

And since He loves the moral virtues of His creatures, He loves Muham-
mad the Arabian ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), whose moral quali-
ties were at the very highest degree, as is agreed unanimously, and He loves 
too those who, as far as they can, resemble him. This means that like His 
mercy, Almighty Allah’s love encompasses the universe.

366

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

Thus, it was because among all those innumerable beloveds, the ultimate 
degree in every respect of the above-mentioned ﬁve aspects was unique to 
Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) that he was 
given the name of Allah’s Beloved.

This  was  the  reason  Süleyman  Efendi  expressed  this  highest  rank  of 
being Allah’s beloved with the words: “ I am your lover. ” The expression is 
meant to provoke thought; it is a distant allusion to this truth. Nevertheless, 
since it conjures up associations unﬁtting to the attributes of dominicality, it 
is best to say instead: “ I am pleased with you. ”

Third Point

Third Point

The  adventures  of  the  Ascension  cannot  express  those  sacred,  tran-
scendent truths through allusions that we understand. Its exchanges are like 
observation posts, means to reﬂective thought, indications of profound and 
elevated truths, reminders for some of the truths of faith, and allusions to 
inexpressible meanings. They are not adventures in the sense that we know. 
We  cannot  reach  those  truths  through  our  imaginations;  we  rather  feel  a 
pleasurable  excitement  in  our  hearts  through  our  faith,  a  luminous  joy  of 
the spirit. For just as Almighty Allah has no like or match or peer in His 
essence and attributes, so He has no like in His dominicality and its qualities. 
Nor does His love resemble the love of creatures, or His attributes resemble 
theirs. So, holding such expressions to be metaphors, we say this:

In  a  manner  that  beﬁts  His  necessary  existence  and  holiness  and  in  a 
form  appropriate  to  His  essential  self-sufﬁciency  and  absolute  perfection, 
the  Necessarily  Existent  One  possesses  certain  qualities,  like  love,  which 
are recalled through the adventures in the section of the  M e v l i d  about the 
Ascension. The Thirty-First Word about the Prophet’s Ascension explains 
and expounds its reality in the context of the principles of belief. Deeming 
that to be sufﬁcient, we leave the present discussion at this.

Fourth Point

The words, “ He saw Almighty Allah beyond seventy thousand veils ” 1 
express distance, whereas the Necessarily Existent One is free of space; He 
is closer to everything than anything else. What does this mean? 

The Answer: This truth has been explained in detail and with proofs in 

the Thirty-First Word, so here we only say this:

1.  See, al-Qasṭalānī, a l - M a w ā h i b   a l - L a d u n n i y a  ( Sharḥ: al-Zarghānī ), vi, 93-100.

TWENTY-FOURTH LETTER – THE SECOND ADDENDUM

Almighty  Allah  is  utterly  near  to  us,  but  we  are  utterly  distant  from 
Him. The sun is near to us through the mirror we are holding, and all trans-
parent objects on the earth are a sort of throne for it and a sort of dwell-
ing. If the sun had consciousness, it would converse with us by means of 
our mirror, despite our being four thousand years distant from it. Without 
drawing any comparisons, we can say that the Pre-Eternal Sun is closer to 
everything than anything else, for He is the Necessarily Existent, he is free 
of space; nothing at all can be a veil to Him. But everything is inﬁnitely 
distant from Him.

This is the mystery underlying the long distance of the Ascension on the 

one hand, and the absence of distance expressed by, 
( 50:16 ) / . - , + *  on the other. Allah’s Most Noble Messen-
ger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) made the Ascension and traversed 
a vast distance, yet he returned in a single instant. The Ascension was his 
spiritual journeying, an expression of his sainthood. For through their spir-
itual  journeying  from  forty  days  to  forty  years,  the  saints  advance  to  the 
degree of “ absolute certainty ” among the degrees of faith.

Similarly,  Allah’s  Most  Noble  Messenger  ( Upon  whom  be  blessings 
and  peace ),  the  lord  of  all  the  saints,  opened  up  a  mighty  highway  with 
his Ascension, which lasting forty minutes rather than forty years, was the 
supreme wonder of sainthood, and which he made not only with his heart 
and spirit, but also with his body and his senses and his subtle faculties. He 
rose to the ultimate degrees of the truths of faith. He mounted by the steps of 
the Ascension to the divine throne, and at the station of “ t h e   d i s t a n c e   o f   t w o  
b o w - l e n g t h s  ” witnessed with his own eyes with the vision of certainty belief 
in Allah and belief in the hereafter, the principal truths of faith; he entered 
Paradise and saw eternal happiness. Then he left open the highway he had 
disclosed through the door of the Ascension, and all the saints of his com-
munity travel on their spiritual journeyings under its shadow, with the spirit 
and heart, in accordance with their degrees.

The  recitation  of  the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  M e v l i d   and  its  section  about 
his Ascension is a ﬁne, beneﬁcial custom and admirable Islamic practice. 
It  strengthens  in  a  pleasant,  shining,  and  agreeable  way  the  fellowship  of 
Islamic social life; it is gratifying and pleasurable instruction in the truths of 
faith; and is an effective and stimulating way of depicting and encouraging 

368

the lights of belief, and love of Allah, and love for the Prophet ( UWBP ). 
May Almighty Allah cause this custom to continue to eternity, and may He 
grant mercy to the writers of M e v l i d s  like Süleyman Efendi, and a place in 
Paradise. Amen.

Conclusion
Since the Creator of the universe created in every species an outstand-
ing individual, including in it all the species’ perfections and making it the 
pride of the species, He would surely create – through the manifestation of 
His Greatest Name – an individual who within the universe would be excep-
tional and perfect. Just as among His names there is a Greatest Name, so 
among His creatures there should be a pre-eminent individual in whom He 
would bring together all the perfections dispersed through the universe, and 
through whom He would draw gazes upon Himself. 

Such  an  individual  would  surely  be  from  among  living  creatures,  for 
among  the  species  and  realms  of  beings  in  the  universe,  the  most  perfect 
are living beings. And among the animate species, the individual would be 
an intelligent being, for among living beings the most perfect are those with 
intelligence. And certainly, that exceptional individual would be a human 
being, for among intelligent beings, the one capable of endless progress is 
man. And among men, that individual would be Muhammad ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ). For no era in history, from the time of Adam to 
the present, has produced his like, and cannot and will not produce such a 
one. For taking half the globe of the earth and a ﬁfth of mankind under his 
spiritual rule, he has perpetuated it magisterially for one thousand three hun-
dred and ﬁfty years, and for all who seek perfection has become a universal 
master in every sort of truth and reality. As agreed by friend and foe alike, 
he possessed moral qualities of the very highest order. At the start of his mis-
sion, he challenged the whole world singlehanded. The person who brought 
the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, which is constantly recited by more 
than a hundred million men, is surely that excellent individual; it could be 
no one else. He is both the seed, and the fruit, of this world.

A Proof of the Qur’an Against Satan and His Party

This  ﬁrst  Topic  defeats  in  argument  the  Devil,  silences  the  rebellious, 
and strikes them dumb by refuting in the most clear manner a fearsomely 
cunning stratagem of the Devil, which is to be unbiased. It concerns an event 
part of which I described in summary form ten years ago in my work entitled 
L e m e â t . It is as follows:

Eleven years before this treatise was written, I was listening in the month 
of  Ramadan  to  the  Qur’an  being  recited  in  Bayezid  Mosque  in  Istanbul. 
Suddenly, although I could see no one, I seemed to hear an unearthly voice 
which captured all my attention. I listened with my imagination, and real-
ized that it was saying to me:

“ You consider the Qur’an to be extremely elevated and brilliant. Be unbi-
ased for a minute and consider it again. That is, suppose it to be man’s word. 
I wonder whether you would still see the same qualities and beauty in it? ”

In truth, I was deceived by the voice; I thought of the Qur’an as being 
written by man. Just as Bayezid Mosque is plunged into darkness when the 
electricity  is  switched  off,  I  observed  that  with  that  thought  the  brilliant 
lights of the Qur’an began to be extinguished. At that point I understood that 

370

TWENTY-SIXTH LETTER – FIRST TOPIC

371

it was the Devil who was speaking to me; he was drawing me towards the 
abyss. I sought help from the Qur’an and a light was at once imparted to my 
heart giving me ﬁrm strength for the defence. I began to argue back at the 
Devil, saying:

“ O  Satan!  Unbiased  thinking  is  to  take  a  position  between  two  sides. 
Whereas what both you and your disciples from among men call unbiased 
thinking is to take the part of the opposing side; it is not impartiality, it is 
temporary  unbelief.  For  to  consider  the  Qur’an  to  be  man’s  word  and  to 
judge it as such is to take the part of the opposing side; it is to favour some-
thing baseless and invalid. It is not being unbiased, it is being biased towards 
falsehood. ”

The Devil replied: “ Well, in that case, say it is neither Allah’s Word nor 

man’s word. Think of it as between the two. ” To which I rejoined:

“ That’s not possible either. For if there is a disputed property for which 
there are two claimants, and the claimants are close both to one another and 
to the property, the property will either be given to someone other than them, 
or will be put somewhere accessible so that whoever proves ownership can 
take it. If the two claimants are far apart with one in the east and the other in 
the west, then according to the rule, it will remain with the one who has pos-
session of it since it is not possible for it to be left somewhere between them.
“ Thus,  the  Qur’an  is  a  valuable  property,  and  however  distant  man’s 
word is from Allah’s, the two sides in question are that far apart; indeed, 
they are inﬁnitely far from one another. It is not possible for the Qur’an to 
be left between the two sides, which are as far apart as the Pleiades and the 
ground. For they are opposites like existence and non-existence or the two 
magnetic poles; there can be no point between them. In which case, for the 
Qur’an, the one who possesses it is Allah’s side. It will be accepted as being 
in His possession, and the proofs of ownership will be regarded in that way. 
Should the opposing side refute all the arguments proving it to be Allah’s 
Word, it may claim ownership of it, otherwise it cannot. Allah forbid! What 
hand can pull out the nails fastening that vast jewel to the sublime throne of 
Allah, riveted as it is with thousands of certain proofs, and break its support-
ing pillars, causing it to fall? ”

“ Inspite of you, O Satan!, the just and the fair-minded reason in this equi-
table and rightful manner. They increase their belief in the Qur’an through 
even the slightest evidences. While according to the way shown by you and 
your disciples, if just once it is supposed to be man’s word and that mighty 
jewel fastened to the divine throne is cast to the ground, a proof with the 

372

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

strength of all the nails and the ﬁrmness of many proofs becomes necessary 
in order to raise it from the ground and fasten it once more to the throne, and 
so be saved from the darkness of unbelief and reach the lights of belief. But 
because it is extremely difﬁcult to do this, due to your wiles, many people 
are  losing  their  faith  at  this  time  by  imagining  themselves  to  be  making 
unbiased judgements. ”

The  Devil  turned  and  said:  “ The  Qur’an  resembles  man’s  word.  It  is 
similar to the way men converse. That means it is man’s word. If it were 
Allah’s Word, it would be appropriate to Him and altogether out of the ordi-
nary. Just as His art does not resemble man’s art, so His Word should not 
resemble man’s word. ” 

I replied: “ It may be understood as follows: apart from his miracles and 
special attributes, the Prophet Muhammad ( UWBP ) was a human being in 
all his actions, conduct, and behaviour. He submitted to and complied with 
the divine laws and commands manifested in creation. He too suffered from 
the cold, experienced pain, and so on. His deeds and attributes were not all 
made out of the ordinary so that he could be the leader of his community 
through his actions, its guide through his conduct, and instruct it through all 
his behaviour. If he had been out of the ordinary in all his conduct, he could 
not have been the leader in every respect, the complete guide for everyone, 
the “ Mercy to All the Worlds ” through all his attributes.

“ In just the same way, the All-Wise Qur’an is the leader of the aware and 
the conscious, the guide of jinn and men, the teacher of those aspiring to per-
fection, and instructor of those seeking reality. It has necessarily, therefore, 
to be in a form similar to human conversation and style. For men and jinn 
take their supplications from it and learn their prayers from it; they express 
their concerns in its language, and learn from it the rules of social behaviour, 
and so on. Everyone has recourse to it. If it had been in similar form to the 
divine speech that the Prophet Moses ( Peace be upon him ) heard on Mount 
Sinai, human beings could not have borne listening to it and hearing it, nor 
made it a point of reference and recourse. Moses ( Peace be upon him ), one 
of the ﬁve greatest prophets, could only endure to hear a few words. He said: 

 1  ِةَ(cid:179) ِ(cid:127)ْ(cid:170)َ

ْ(cid:202)ا  ِع(cid:193) ِ(cid:175)َ(cid:106) ُةَ

َكُ(cid:174) َ(cid:203)ﯬﯦ اَذﯬﯧٰ(cid:182)َا

Next, the Devil said: “ Many people speak of matters similar to those in 
the Qur’an in the name of religion. Isn’t it possible, therefore, that a human 
being did such a thing and made up the Qur’an in the name of religion? ”

TWENTY-SIXTH LETTER – FIRST TOPIC

Inspired by the light of the Qur’an, I replied as follows:
“ F i r s t l y :  Out of love of religion, someone who is religious may say: ‘The 
truth is this; in reality, the matter is thus; Almighty Allah commands such-
and-such.’ But he would not make Allah speak to suit himself. Trembling 
at the verse,

( 39:32 ) ' & % $ # "
he  would  not  overstep  his  mark  to  an  inﬁnite  degree,  imitate  Allah,  and 
speak on His behalf.

“ S e c o n d l y :  It is in no way possible for a human being to be successful 
in doing such a thing on his own, in fact, it is completely impossible. People 
who resemble each other may imitate one another, people of the same nation 
look the same as one another, people who are close to one another in rank 
or status may impersonate one another and temporarily deceive people, but 
they cannot do so for ever. For in any event, the falseness and artiﬁciality 
in their behaviour will show up their imposture to the observant, and their 
deception will not last. If the person who is attempting to imitate another 
under  false  pretences  is  quite  unlike  them;  for  example,  if  an  uneducated 
man  wants  to  imitate  in  learning  a  genius  like  Ibn  Sina,  or  a  shepherd  to 
assume the position of a king, of course they will not deceive anyone at all, 
they will only make fools of themselves. Everything they do will proclaim, 
‘This is an impostor.’

“ Thus, to suppose – Allah forbid!, a hundred thousand times – the Qur’an 
to be man’s word is utterly impossible; no rational being could accept its 
possibility; to do so is a delirium like imagining to be possible something 
that is self-evidently impossible, like a ﬁreﬂy being regarded by astronomers 
as a real star for a thousand years; or a ﬂy appearing to observers in the form 
of a peacock for a year; or a bogus common private posing as a famous lofty 
ﬁeld marshal, taking over his position and remaining in it for a long period 
without  giving  away  his  deception;  or  like  a  slandering,  unbelieving  liar 
affecting the manner and position of the most truthful, trustworthy, upright 
believer throughout his life and being completely unrufﬂed before even the 
most observant while concealing his fraud from them.

“ In just the same way, if the Qur’an is supposed to be man’s word, then 
it has to be supposed, Allah forbid, that that Perspicuous Book – which is 
clearly a brilliant star; indeed, a sun of perfections perpetually scattering the 
lights of truth in the heavens of the world of Islam – is like a ﬁreﬂy, a spuri-
ous sham made up by a counterfeiting human; and those who are closest to 

374

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

it and study it most carefully do not realize this, and consider it to be a per-
petual, exalted star and source of truth. This is impossible a hundred times 
over, and even if you were to go a hundred times further in your diabolical 
machinations, O Satan, you could not make such an assertion, you could not 
deceive anyone of sound reason! Only sometimes you trick people by mak-
ing them look from a great distance, thus making the star appear as small as 
a ﬁreﬂy.

“ T h i r d l y :   Also,  if  the  Qur’an  is  imagined  to  be  man’s  word,  it  neces-
sitates  that  the  hidden  reality  of  a  criterion  of  truth  and  falsehood  that  is 
miraculous in its exposition, and through the testimony of its fruits, results, 
and effects, is gilded with the most spiritual and life-giving, the most truthful 
and happiness-bringing, the most comprehensive and exalted qualities in the 
world of humanity, is, Allah forbid, the fabrication of a single unaided and 
unlearned man’s mind, and that the great geniuses and brilliant scholars who 
observed him closely and studied him meticulously at no time saw any trace 
of  counterfeit  or  pretence  in  him  and  always  found  him  serious,  genuine, 
and sincere.

“ This is completely impossible, an idea so nonsensical as to shame the 
Devil himself, like dreaming up an utterly impossible situation. For it entails 
supposing a person who throughout his life demonstrated and taught trust, 
belief, conﬁdence, sincerity, seriousness, and integrity through all his con-
duct, words, and actions, and raised eminently truthful and sincere follow-
ers,  and  was  accepted  as  possessing  the  highest,  most  shining  virtues,  to 
be the most untrustworthy, insincere, and unbelieving. For in this question 
there is no point between the two.

“ If, to suppose the impossible, the Qur’an were not the Word of Allah, it 
would fall from the divine throne to the ground; it would not remain some-
where between. While being the meeting-point of truths, it would become 
a source of superstition and myth. And if, Allah forbid, the one who pro-
claimed that wonderful decree was not Allah’s Messenger, it would neces-
sitate his descending from the highest of the high to the lowest of the low, 
and from the degree of being the source of accomplishments and perfections 
to the level of being a mine of trickery and intrigue; he could not remain 
between the two. For one who lies and fabricates in Allah’s name falls to the 
very lowest of degrees.

“ It is as impossible as permanently seeing a ﬂy as a peacock, and all the 
time seeing the peacocks’s attributes in the ﬂy. Only someone lacking all 
intelligence could imagine it to be possible. 

TWENTY-SIXTH LETTER – FIRST TOPIC

375

“ F o u r t h l y :  Also, if the Qur’an is imagined to be man’s word, it neces-
sitates fancying that the Qur’an, which is a sacred commander of the com-
munity  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP ),  mankind’s  largest  and  most  powerful 
army, is – Allah forbid – a powerless, valueless, baseless forgery. Whereas, 
self-evidently, through its powerful laws, sound principles, and penetrating 
commands, it has equipped that huge army both materially, and morally and 
spiritually, has imposed on it such an order, regularity, and discipline that it 
has conquered both this world and the next, and has instructed the minds of 
people each according to his degree, and trained their hearts, conquered their 
spirits, puriﬁed their consciences, and employed and utilized their limbs and 
members. To imagine it to be a counterfeit necessitates accepting a hundred-
fold impossibility.

“ Such an impossibility entails the further total impossibility of suppos-
ing  that  a  person  who,  through  his  deliberate  conduct  throughout  his  life 
taught mankind Almighty Allah’s laws, and through his honest behaviour 
instructed humanity in the principles of truth, and through his sincere and 
reasonable  words  showed  and  established  the  straight  way  of  moderation 
and happiness, and as all his life testiﬁes, felt great fear at divine punishment 
and knew Allah better than anyone else and made Him known, and in splen-
did fashion has for one thousand three hundred and ﬁfty years commanded 
a ﬁfth of mankind and half the globe, and through his renowned qualities 
is  in  truth  the  pride  of  mankind,  indeed,  of  the  universe,  –  it  entails  the 
impossibility of supposing that, Allah forbid a hundred thousand times, he 
neither feared Allah, nor knew Him, nor held back from lying, nor had any 
self-respect. Because in this matter there is no point between the two. For 
if, to suppose the impossible, the Qur’an is not the Word of Allah, if it falls 
from the divine throne to the ground, it cannot remain somewhere between 
the two. Indeed, it has to be said to be the property of the very worst of liars. 
And as for this, O Satan, even if you were a hundred times more satanic, you 
could not deceive any mind that was not unsound, nor persuade any heart 
that was not corrupted! ”

The  Devil  retorted:  “ That’s  what  you  think!  I  have  deceived  most  of 
mankind, and their foremost thinkers, into denying the Qur’an and Muham-
mad. ” 

I replied: “ Firstly: When seen from a great distance, the largest thing 

appears the same as the smallest. A star may even look like a candle.

“ Secondly: Also, when seen both as secondary and superﬁcially, some-

thing which is completely impossible may appear to be possible.

376

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

“ One time when an old man was watching the sky in order to spot the 
new moon of Ramadan, a white hair fell on his eye. Imagining it to be the 
moon,  he  announced:  ‘I  have  seen  the  new  moon!’  Now,  it  is  impossible 
that the white hair was the moon, but because his intention was to spot the 
moon and the hair was by the way and secondary, he paid it no attention and 
thought the impossibility was possible.

“ Thirdly:  Also,  non-acceptance  is  one  thing  and  denial  is  something 
quite  different.  Non-acceptance  is  indifference,  a  closing  of  the  eyes  to 
something, an ignorant absence of judgement. It may mask many completely 
impossible things and the mind does not concern itself with them. As for 
denial, it is not non-acceptance, but the acceptance of non-existence; it is a 
judgement. The mind is compelled to work. So a devil like you takes hold of 
someone’s mind and leads it to denial. Showing the false to be truth and the 
impossible to be possible through such satanic wiles as heedlessness, mis-
guidance, fallacious reasoning, obstinacy, false arguments, pride, deception, 
and  habit,  you  make  those  unfortunate  creatures  in  human  form  swallow 
unbelief and denial, although they comprise innumerable impossibilities.

“ Fourthly:  Also,  if  the  Qur’an  is  supposed  to  be  the  word  of  man,  it 
necessitates imagining to be its opposite a book that has self-evidently guided 
the puriﬁed, veracious saints and spiritual poles, who shine like stars in the 
heavens of the world of mankind, has continuously instructed all levels of 
perfected men in truth and justice, veracity and ﬁdelity, faith and trustwor-
thiness, and has ensured the happiness of this world and the next through the 
truths of the pillars of faith and the principles of the pillars of Islam; a book 
that through the testimony of its achievements is of necessity veracious, and 
pure, genuine truth, and absolutely right, and most serious – it necessitates 
imagining, Allah forbid, that it comprises the opposites of these qualities, 
effects, and lights, and not only is a collection of fabrications and lies, but 
also a frenzy of unbelief that would shame even the Sophists and the devils, 
and cause them to tremble.

“ This  impossibility  necessitates  the  further,  most  ugly  and  abhorrent, 
impossibility that the person who, according to the testimony of the religion 
and Shari‘a of Islam that he proclaimed, and the extraordinary fear of Allah 
and pure, sincere worship that he demonstrated throughout his life, and as 
necessitated by the good moral qualities unanimously witnessed in him, and 
according to the afﬁrmation of the people of truth and perfection whom he 
raised, was the most believing, the most steadfast, the most trustworthy, and 
the most truthful, was – Allah forbid, and again, Allah forbid – without faith, 

TWENTY-SIXTH LETTER – FIRST TOPIC

377

that he was most untrustworthy, did not fear Allah, nor shrink from lying. 
To imagine this necessitates imagining the most loathsome form of impos-
sibility and perpetrating the most iniquitous and vicious sort of misguidance.
“ In Short: As is stated in the Eighteenth Sign of the Nineteenth Letter, 
the common people, who gain an understanding of the Qur’an’s miraculous 
nature by listening to it, say: ‘If I were to compare the Qur’an with all the 
other books I have listened to, or with all the other books in the world, it 
would resemble none of them; it is not the same as them in either kind or 
degree.’ The Qur’an, then, is either superior to all of them, or inferior to all 
of them. It is impossible that it is inferior, and no enemy or the Devil even 
could say that. In which case, the Qur’an is superior to all other books, and is 
therefore a miracle. In just the same way, we say according to the categorical 
proof called “ residue, ” taken from the sciences of method and logic:

“ O  Satan  and  O  disciples  of  Satan!  The  Qur’an  is  either  the  Word  of 
Allah, come from the supreme throne of Allah and His Greatest Name, or, 
Allah  forbid,  and  again,  Allah  forbid,  it  is  a  human  forgery  fabricated  on 
earth by someone without belief who neither feared Allah nor knew Him. 
In the face of the above proofs, O Satan, you can neither say that, nor could 
you have said it, nor will you be able to say it in the future. Therefore, the 
Qur’an is the Word of the Creator of the universe. Because there is no point 
between the two; it is impossible and precluded that there should be. And we 
have proved it most clearly and decisively; and you have seen it and heard it.
“ In the same way, Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) is 
either Allah’s Messenger and the highest of the prophets and the most supe-
rior of creatures, or, Allah forbid, he has to be imagined to be someone with-
out belief who fell to the lowest of the low because he lied concerning Allah, 
and did not know Allah, and did not believe in His punishment. 1 And as for 
this, O Devil, neither you, nor the philosophers of Europe or hypocrites of 
Asia on whom you rely, could say it; neither could you say it in the past, nor 
shall you be able to say it in the future, for there is no one in the world who 
would listen to it and accept it. It is because of this that the most corrupting 
of those philosophers and the most lacking in conscience of the hypocrites, 
even, admit that ‘Muhammad the Arabian ( UWBP ) was very clever, and 
was most moral and upright.’

1.  Relying on the fact that the Qur’an mentions the unbelievers’ blasphemies and ob-
scenities, in order to refute them, trembling, I too have been compelled to use these expres-
sions, in the form of impossibilities, to demonstrate the total impossibility and complete 
worthlessness of the blasphemous ideas of the people of misguidance.

“ Since  the  matter  is  limited  to  these  two  sides,  and  the  second  one  is 
impossible and no one at all claims it to be true, and since we have proved 
with decisive arguments that there is no point between them, for sure and 
of necessity, in spite of you and your party, Muhammad the Arabian ( Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ) was the Messenger of Allah, and the highest 
of the prophets and the best of all creatures. ”

One  time  while  reading  these  verses  from  Sura  Qaf,  the  Devil  said  to 
me:  “ You  consider  the  principal  aspects  of  the  Qur’an’s  eloquence  to  lie 
in its clarity and ﬂuency of style, but in these verses it jumps from one sub-
ject to another. It jumps from death agonies to the resurrection of the dead, 
from the blowing of the trumpet to the Last Judgement, and from that to the 
entry into Hell of the unbelievers. What ﬂuency of style can there be with 
this extraordinary switching about? In most places in the Qur’an, it brings 
together subjects like this that bear little relation to each other. Where is its 
eloquence and smoothness with such discontinuity? ”

I answered as follows:
After its eloquence, one of the chief elements of the Qur’an of Miracu-
lous Exposition’s inimitability is its conciseness. Conciseness is one of the 
strongest and most important elements of the Qur’an’s miraculousness. The 
instances of it are so numerous and beautiful that exacting scholars are left 
in wonder at it. For example:

 É È Ç Æ Å Ä Ã Â Á À ¿ ¾ ½ ¼
( 11:44 ) Í Ì Ë Ê
It describes the Great Flood and its consequences so concisely and miracu-
lously in a few short sentences that it has caused many scholars of rhetoric 
to prostrate before its eloquence. And, for example:

  *  ` _ ^ ] \ [ Z
( 91:11-15 ) d c b

380

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

In  these  few  short  sentences,  with  a  miraculousness  within  the  concise-
ness, ﬂuency, and clarity, and in a way that does not spoil the understand-
ing, the Qur’an relates the strange, momentous events involving the Tha-
mud  people  and  their  consequences,  and  the  Thamud’s  calamitous  end. 
And for example:

 j i h g f e d c b a ` _ ^
( 21:87 ) t s r q p o n m l k

Here, many sentences have been “ rolled up ” between the words 
g f e d and j i h but these omitted sentences neither 
spoil  the  understanding,  nor  mar  the  ﬂuency  of  the  style.  It  mentions  the 
chief elements of the story of Jonah ( Upon whom be peace ), and refers the 
rest to the intelligence.

And for example, in Sura Yusuf, the seven or eight sentences between 
the words 5 and ( 12:45-46 ) 9 8 7 have been skipped con-
cisely, yet it neither impairs the understanding, nor mars the smoothness of 
the style. There are a great many instances of this sort of miraculous concise-
ness in the Qur’an, and they are very beautiful indeed.

However, the conciseness of the verses from Sura Qaf are particularly 
wonderful and miraculous. For they each point out the truly dreadful future 
of the unbelievers when each endless day will last ﬁfty thousand years, and 
the dire things that will happen to them in the awesome revolutions of the 
future. It ﬂashes them over the mind like lightning, depicting that long, long 
period  of  time  to  the  mind’s  eye  as  a  single  present  page.  Referring  the 
events that are not mentioned to the imagination, it evokes them with truly 
elevated ﬂuency and smoothness of style.

And now if you have anything to say, O Satan, say it!
Satan replied: “ I cannot oppose what you say, nor defend myself. But 
there are many foolish people who listen to me; and many devils in human 
form  who  assist  me;  and  many  pharaohs  among  philosophers  who  learn 
things from me which ﬂatter their egos, and prevent the publication of works 
like yours. Therefore I shall not lay down my arms before you! ”

Second Topic 

[ This Topic was written in response to the wonder expressed by those 
who serve me permanently at the surprising contradictions they see in 
my conduct. It is also intended to rectify the excessively good opinions 
of me of two of my students. ]

I see that some of the perfections which properly pertain to the truths of 
the All-Wise Qur’an are attributed to the instruments who proclaim those 
truths.  And  this  is  wrong.  For  the  sacredness  of  the  source  demonstrates 
effects as powerful as many proofs; it is through these that it makes every-
one accept its injunctions. Whenever the herald or deputy obscures it, that is, 
whenever attention is turned to the herald, the sacredness loses its effective-
ness. It is because of this that I shall explain a truth to my brothers who show 
me greater regard than is my due. It is as follows:

One person may have numerous personalities, all of which display differ-
ent qualities. For example, when a high ofﬁcial is in his ofﬁce, his position 
necessitates dignity and requires a stance that will preserve its loftiness. If he 
is humble before his visitors, it will be lowering and will debase the position. 
But when in his own house, his position requires – contrary to his ofﬁcial 
position – that he should be as modest as he can. If he stands on his dignity, 
it will be arrogant. And so on. That is to say, a person assumes a personality 
when performing his duty or work that in many respects contradicts his true 
personality. If such a person is truly worthy of his duty and truly capable of 
it, the two personalities are close to each other. But if he lacks the capacity; 
if, for example, a common soldier is put in the position of a ﬁeld marshal, 
the two personalities are far apart; the individual, lowly, inferior qualities of 
the soldier are incompatible with the elevated, superior character demanded 
by the position of ﬁeld marshal.

Thus, this wretched brother of yours has three personalities, which are 

very distant from each other, truly very distant.

The  First:  In  so  far  as  I  am  a  herald  of  the  elevated  treasury  of  the 
All-Wise Qur’an, I have a temporary personality that pertains solely to the 
Qur’an. The extremely exalted character demanded by this position is not 
mine; I do not possess such a character. It rather consists of the qualities 
necessitated by the position and the duty. Any qualities this sort that you 

381

382

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

see in me are not mine, so do not suppose I possess them; they belong to 
the position.

The Second Personality: Through Almighty Allah’s grace, a personal-
ity is given me at the time of worship when I am turned towards the divine 
court; it displays certain marks. These arise from knowing one’s faults, real-
izing one’s want and impotence, and seeking refuge in utter humility at the 
divine court, which are the basis and meaning of worship. Through this per-
sonality, I know myself to be more wretched, powerless, wanting, and faulty 
than everyone. If the whole world were to praise and applaud me, it could 
not make me believe that I am good or possess perfection of any sort.

The  Third:  I  have  my  true  personality,  that  is,  the  faulty  personality 
of  the  Old  Said,  that  is,  certain  veins  of  character  inherited  from  the  Old 
Said.  Sometimes  it  inclines  to  hypocrisy  and  desires  rank  and  position. 
Also, because I do not come from a noble family, inferior qualities are to be 
observed, like my being frugal to the point of miserliness.

My brothers! I am not going to describe the many secret faults and ills of 

this personality, lest I chase you away altogether.

My brothers, since I am not someone capable and of high position, this 
personality of mine is very far from the character demanded by the duties 
of herald and of worship; it does not show their traits. Also, in accordance

sionately demonstrated His power in me so that He employs my personality,

the Qur’an, which resembles the highest position of ﬁeld marshal. Thanks 
be to Allah a hundred thousand times! The soul is baser than everything, and 
the duty higher!

Since  the  elevated  truth  stated  by  the  above  verse  concerns  the  life  of 
society,  I  have  been  compelled  to  write  it  in  the  tongue,  not  of  the  New 
Said, who wants to withdraw from society, but of the Old Said, who was 
involved in the social life of Islam. It is written intending to serve the Qur’an 
of Mighty Stature and to shield it against unjust attacks.

In  explanation  of  the  principle  of  mutual  acquaintance  and  assistance 
alluded to by the above verse, we say this: an army is divided into divisions, 
the divisions into regiments, the regiments into battalions, and companies, 
and squads, so that all the soldiers may know their many different connec-
tions and related duties. In this way, they all will perform properly a general 
duty in accordance with the principle of mutual assistance, and the collec-
tivity they form will be safe from the attacks of the enemy. The army is not 
arranged thus to be divided and split up, with one company competing with 
another, one battalion being hostile to another, and one division acting in 
opposition to another.

Similarly,  Islamic  society  as  a  whole  is  a  huge  army  that  is  divided 
into tribes and groups. Nevertheless, it has unity in numerous respects: its 
groups’ Creator is one and the same, their Provider is one and the same, their 
Prophet is one and the same, their q i b l a  is one and the same, their Book is 

383

384

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

one and the same, their country is one and the same; a thousand things are 
one and the same.

All these things being one and the same necessitates brotherhood, love, 
and unity. That is to say, being divided into groups and tribes should lead to 
mutual acquaintance and assistance, not to antipathy and mutual hostility.

The idea of nationalism has greatly advanced this century. The cunning 
European tyrants in particular awaken this among Muslims in negative fash-
ion so they may divide them up and devour them.

Furthermore, in the idea of nationalism is a thrill of the soul, a heedless 
pleasure, an inauspicious power. For this reason people involved in social 
life at this time cannot be told to give it up. However, nationalism is of two 
kinds: one is negative, inauspicious, and harmful; it is nourished by devour-
ing  others,  persists  through  hostility  to  others,  and  is  aware  of  what  it  is 
doing. It is the cause of enmity and disturbance. This is the reason the Hadith 
states that Islam has abrogated what preceded it and put an end to the tribal-

The above Hadith and verse reject in deﬁnite terms negative nationalism and 
racialism. For positive, sacred Islamic nationhood leaves no need for them.
What race has three hundred and ﬁfty million members? Which racial-
ism can gain for those who subscribe to it so many brothers – and eternal 
brothers at that – in place of Islam? Negative nationalism has caused untold 
harm in history.

I n   S h o r t :  The Umayyads combined some nationalistic ideas with their 
politics,  and  vexed  the  World  of  Islam.  They  also  brought  down  many 
calamities  on  themselves.  Also,  the  European  nations  have  promoted  the 
idea of racialism enormously this century; the ghastly events of the Great 
War  demonstrated  just  how  harmful  negative  nationalism  is,  in  addition

to the perpetual, ill-omened enmity of the French and Germans. And with 
us,  in  the  Second  Constitutional  Period,  –  like  the  myriad  tongues  at  the 
destruction of the Tower of Babel, known as the “ ramiﬁcation of peoples, ” 
and their resulting dispersal – various refugee societies called “ clubs ” were 
formed,  chieﬂy  by  the  Armenians  and  Greeks,  because  of  their  negative, 
nationalistic ideas, and these were the cause of division. From that time to 
now, the condition of those devoured by the Europeans due to those clubs, 
and of those made wretched by them, has again demonstrated the harm of 
negative nationalism.

As for the present, when the peoples and tribes of Islam are most in need 
of one another, and each is more oppressed and more poverty-stricken than 
the others, and they are crushed beneath European domination, to regard one 
another as strangers due to the idea of nationalism and look on each other 
as enemies, is such a calamity it is indescribable. It is quite simply a lunacy 
like turning one’s back on dreadful serpents so as to avoid being bitten by 
a mosquito and struggling with the mosquito – due to the idea of national-
ism. To attach no importance to the European nations, which are like huge 
dragons, at a time when with their insatiable greed their grasping hands are 
outstretched,  indeed,  to  in  effect  help  them  and  to  nurture  enmity  against 
fellow-citizens in the eastern provinces or brother Muslims to the south, and 
to take up positions opposed to them, is extremely detrimental and danger-
ous. In any event there are no enemies among the people to the south that 
they should form a front against them. The Qur’an’s light comes from the 
south; it is where the light of Islam came from. It is present among us and 
is found everywhere. So to be hostile towards those fellow Muslims is indi-
rectly harmful to Islam and the Qur’an. And hostility towards Islam and the 
Qur’an is hostility of a sort towards the lives in this world and in the next of 
all those fellow-citizens. To destroy the foundations of their two lives while 
claiming to serve their social life in the name of patriotism, is not patriotism 
but stupidity!

Positive nationalism arises from an inner need of social life and is the 
cause of mutual assistance and solidarity. It gives rise to a beneﬁcial strength, 
and is a way of reinforcing Islamic brotherhood.

The idea of positive nationalism should serve Islam and be its citadel and 
armour; it should not take its place. For within the brotherhood of Islam is a 
hundredfold brotherhood that persists in the Intermediate Realm and World 

386

of  Eternity.  So  whatever  its  extent,  national  brotherhood  may  be  an  ele-
ment of it. But to plant it in place of Islamic brotherhood is a foolish crime 
like replacing the treasure of diamonds within the citadel with the citadel’s 
stones, and throwing the diamonds away.

O sons of this land, who are the people of the Qur’an! Challenging the 
whole world, you have proclaimed the Qur’an as its standard-bearers, not for 
six hundred years, but for a thousand years since the time of the ‘Abbasids. 
You  have  made  your  nationhood  a  citadel  to  the  Qur’an  and  Islam.  You 
have  silenced  the  whole  world  and  repulsed  awesome  attacks.  You  have 
conﬁrmed the verse:

 ¡ ﮯ ~ } | { z y x w v u 
( 5:54 ) ¤ £ ¢
Now you must refrain from succumbing to the stratagems of Europe and the 
dissemblers  who  imitate  them,  thus  corroborating  the  passage  above;  you 
must be frightened of doing such a thing!

A  Noteworthy  Situation:  The  Turks  are  the  most  numerous  of  the 
Islamic peoples, and wherever they are found, they are Muslims. They have 
not  divided  into  Muslims  and  non-Muslims  like  other  peoples.  Wherever 
there are Turks, they are Muslims. Turks who have abandoned Islam or who 
are not Muslims are no longer Turkish, like the Hungarians. But even small 
races consist of both Muslims and non-Muslims.

O my Turkish brother! You watch out in particular! Your nationhood has 
fused with Islam and may not be separated from it. If you do separate them, 
you will be ﬁnished! All your glorious deeds of the past are recorded in the 
book of Islam’s deeds, and cannot be effaced from the face of the earth by 
any power. So don’t you efface them from your heart at the evil suggestions 
and devices of Satan!

The  peoples  awakening  in  Asia  are  embracing  the  idea  of  nationalism 
and imitating Europe precisely in every respect, and on the way are sacriﬁc-
ing many of the things they hold sacred. However, every nation requires a 
dress suitable to its particular stature. Even if the material is the same [ for 
all nations ], the styles have to be different. A woman cannot be dressed in a 
gendarme’s uniform, nor can an elderly h o j a  be clothed in a tango-dancer’s 
outﬁt.  Moreover,  blind  imitation  very  often  makes  people  into  laughing-
stocks. This is so for the following reasons:

TWENTY-SIXTH LETTER – THIRD TOPIC

387

F i r s t l y :   If  Europe  is  a  shop,  a  barracks,  Asia  is  an  arable  ﬁeld  and  a 
mosque. A shopkeeper can go to the ball, but a peasant cannot. The situation 
of a barracks and that of a mosque cannot be the same.

Moreover, the appearance of most of the prophets in Asia, and the emer-
gence of the majority of philosophers in Europe is a sign, an indication, of 
pre-eternal divine determining that what will arouse the Asian peoples and 
cause them to progress and to govern, are religion and the heart. As for phi-
losophy, it should assist religion and the heart, not take its place.

S e c o n d l y  : It is a grievous error to compare the religions of Islam and 
Christianity  and  to  be  indifferent  towards  religion  like  Europe.  Firstly, 
Europe has its religion. The fact that such European leaders as Wilson, Lloyd 
George, and Venizelos were as bigoted in their religion as priests, testiﬁes 
that Europe has its religion, and is even bigoted in one respect.

T h i r d l y :  To compare Islam with Christianity is a false comparison and 
wrong. For when it was bigoted in its religion, Europe was not civilized; it 
became civilized on giving up its bigotry. 

Furthermore, religion caused three hundred years of war between them. 
And since it was the means of despotic tyrants crushing the common people, 
the  poor,  and  thinkers  who  were  in  their  power,  they  all  felt  a  temporary 
disgust at religion. However, in Islam, history testiﬁes that apart from one 
occasion, religion has not been the cause of internal war. 

Also, whenever the people of Islam have adhered in earnest to their reli-
gion,  they  have  advanced  proportionately,  achieving  signiﬁcant  progress. 
Witness to this is the greatest master of Europe, the Islamic state of Andalu-
sia. But whenever the Islamic community has been slack in religion, it has 
sunk into wretchedness, and declined.

Furthermore, Islam has protected the poor and the common people with 
compassionate measures such as enjoining the payment of z a k a t  and prohib-
iting usury and interest. And in accordance with phrases like, 
 » º  
( 4:82 )  L K   َنوُرَ
ّ(cid:167)َ(cid:159)َ(cid:99)َ(cid:192)  َ(cid:203)َ(cid:158)َا    ( 36:68 )  it  has  called  on  the  intelligence 
and  encouraged  reason  and  knowledge  and  protected  scholars.  Islam  has 
therefore always been the stronghold and place of recourse of the poor and 
the people of learning. They have no reason to be vexed at Islam. The under-
lying  reason  Islam  differs  in  various  respects  from  Christianity  and  other 
religions is this:

388

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

The basis of Islam is the pure afﬁrmation of divine unity; it attributes 
no actual effect to causes and intermediaries, and affords them no value 
in  respect  of  creation  and  position.  Christianity,  however,  since  it  has 
accepted the idea of Jesus being the Son of Allah, it gives some value to 
causes and intermediaries; it cannot break egotism. It quite simply ascribes 
a  manifestation  of  divine  dominicality  to  its  saints  and  great  ones,  thus 
conﬁrming the verse:

( 9:31 ) ¯ ® ¬ « ª © ¨
It is because of this that, together with maintaining their pride and egotism, 
those  Christians  who  occupy  the  highest  worldly  ranks  are  religious  and 
bigoted, like the former American president, Wilson. In Islam, the religion 
of pure divine unity, those holding the highest worldly positions either give 
up their egotism and pride, or they give up their religion to an extent. For this 
reason, some are neglectful or even irreligious.

racialism we say this:

To those people who go to excess in the idea of negative nationalism and 

F i r s t l y :   The  face  of  the  world  and  especially  this  country  of  ours  has 
since ancient times seen numerous migrations and changes of population. 
In addition, when the centre of Islamic rule was established here other peo-
ples were drawn to it and they settled here. Consequently, only when the 
Preserved Tablet is revealed will the races truly be distinguished from each 
other.  To  construct  movements  and  patriotism  on  the  idea  of  true  race  is 
both meaningless and extremely harmful. It is for this reason that one of the 
nationalist leaders and racialists, who was very neglectful in religion, was 
compelled to say that a nation is a nation when its people share the same 
language and religion. Since that is so, relations based on language, religion, 
and country should be taken into account, not true race. If the three are the 
same, the nation will certainly be strong. But if one is lacking, there will still 
be nationhood. 

S e c o n d l y :  I shall describe by way of example, two of the hundreds of 
advantages the sacred nationhood of Islam has gained for the social life of 
the sons of this land:

The First

The First: What enabled this Islamic state, while numbering only twenty 
or thirty million, to preserve its life and existence in the face of all the large 
states of Europe was the following idea held by its army, which was born 

TWENTY-SIXTH LETTER – THIRD TOPIC

389

of the light of the Qur’an: “ If I die, I shall be a martyr; and if I kill, I shall 
be a g h a z i . ” They met death eagerly and with longing, laughing in its face. 
They always made Europe tremble. What in the world is there that will give 
rise to such elevated self-sacriﬁce in the spirit of a simple-hearted soldier? 
What patriotism can be instilled in its place? What can make him willingly 
sacriﬁce his life and all his world?

The Second

The Second: Whenever the dragons ( large states ) of Europe have dealt 
a blow at this Islamic state, they have caused three hundred and ﬁfty million 
Muslims to weep and cry out. So in order not to make them do that, those 
colonialists drew back their hands; they lowered them, even while raising 
them to strike. What power can be established in place of this constant moral 
support, which can be in no way belittled? Let them show it! No, that huge 
moral strength must not be offended by negative nationalism and independ-
ent patriotism.

Seventh Matter

Seventh Matter

We say to those who exhibit excessive patriotism and negative national-
ism: if you truly love this nation and feel pity for it, be patriotic in such a 
way that your pity is directed towards the majority of its people. For to serve 
the temporary heedless social life of the minority, who are in no need of pity, 
in a way that is the reverse of pity for the majority, is not patriotism. Patriotic 
works performed out of negative racialism may be temporarily beneﬁcial for 
two people out of eight. They receive the kindness arising from that patriot-
ism, although they do not deserve it. But the remaining six are either elderly, 
or sick, or afﬂicted with tribulations, or are children, or weak, or pious peo-
ple turned earnestly toward the hereafter; these people want a light, a solace, 
compassion, in the face of the Intermediate Realm and the hereafter, with the 
life of which they are concerned rather than worldly life; they are in need of 
helping hands that are blessed and patriotic. What patriotism could permit 
their light to be extinguished, their solace to be destroyed? Alas! Where is 
that pity for the nation, that self-sacriﬁce?

We  must  never  lose  hope  in  divine  mercy.  For  Almighty  Allah  will 
not cause to perish through temporary set-backs the magniﬁcent army and 
mighty community of the people of this land, which He employed for a thou-
sand years in the service of the Qur’an, appointing them its standard-bearer. 
He will once again kindle that light and cause them to continue their duty, 
Allah willing!

[ NOTE: The ten Matters of this Fourth Topic are unconnected, in the 
same way that the four Topics of this Twenty-Sixth Letter are uncon-

as they occurred to me. This is part of a letter to an important student of 
mine, consisting of the answers to ﬁve or six of his questions. ]

First Matter

T h e   F i r s t

S e c o n d l y :   In  your  letter  you  mention  that  explanations  and  interpreta-
tions of   ( 1:2 ) * )  state that there are eighteen thousand worlds,1 and 
you ask the wisdom in this number.
My brother, at the moment I do not know the wisdom in it, but I can say 
this much: the phrases of the Wise Qur’an are not restricted to a single mean-
ing; for since the Qur’an addresses all the levels of mankind, its phrases are 
like universals or wholes that comprise meanings for each level. The mean-
ings that are expounded are like parts of the general law. Every Qur’anic 
commentator,  every  adept,  mentions  one  part  of  the  whole.  Basing  it  on 
either his illumination, or his proofs, or his way, he prefers one meaning. 
Thus, in this verse too, one group disclosed a meaning which corresponded 
to that number. 

For example, the verses,

( 55:19-20 ) 2 1 0 /  * - , +
which the people of sainthood hold to be signiﬁcant and recite constantly in

Yes, the person who is fond of himself and relies on himself is unfortunate, 
while someone who sees his own faults is fortunate. So you are fortunate! 
Nevertheless, it sometimes happens that the evil-commanding soul is trans-
formed into the blaming soul or the tranquil soul, and that it hands over its 
weapons and equipment to the nerves. Then the nerves and veins of tem-
perament perform its function till the end of life. Although the person’s evil-
commanding soul died long beforehand, his nerves are still apparent. Many 
great  saints  and  holy  men  have  complained  about  their  evil-commanding 
souls although their souls were tranquil. They have lamented over sicknesses 
of the heart although their hearts were completely sound and illumined. But 
what afﬂicted these persons was not their evil-commanding souls, but the 
soul’s functions that had been handed over to their nerves. Their ailments 
were  not  of  the  heart,  but  of  the  imagination.  My  brother!  Allah  willing, 
what is attacking you is not your soul and a sickness of the heart, but the 
state which, as we said, by reason of human nature and to perpetuate striv-
ing, has been transferred to the nerves and results in constant progress.

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

His  First  Question:  Muhyi’l-Din  al-‘Arabi  said  in  his  letter  to  Fakhr 
al-Din Razi: “ To know Allah is different to knowing that He exists. ” What 
does this mean and what did he intend by saying it?

F i r s t l y :  In the introduction to the Twenty-Second Word, which you read 
to  him,  the  comparison  and  example  showing  the  difference  between  the 
true afﬁrmation of divine unity and its superﬁcial afﬁrmation point to what 
was intended. While the Second and Third Stopping-Places of the Thirty-
Second Word and its Aims, elucidate it.

A n d  s e c o n d l y :  Muhyi’l-Din al-‘Arabi said that to Fakhr al-Din Razi, who 
was a leading authority on theology, because the explications of the tenets of 
belief and the existence of the Necessary Existent and divine unity offered 
by the authoritative scholars of the principles of religion and theology were 
insufﬁcient in his view.

Yes, the knowledge of Allah gained through theology does not afford a 
complete knowledge and a complete sense of the divine presence. However, 
when gained through the method of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition, it 
affords both complete knowledge and a total sense of the divine presence. 
Allah willing, all the parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  perform the duty of an electric 
lamp on that light-ﬁlled highway of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition.

Furthermore,  however  deﬁcient  in  Muhyi’l-Din  al-‘Arabi’s  view  the 
knowledge of Allah was that Fakhr al-Din Razi obtained by means of theol-
ogy, the knowledge of Allah attained on the Suﬁ way is similarly deﬁcient 
in  relation  to  the  knowledge  obtained  through  the  legacy  of  prophethood 
directly from the All-Wise Qur’an. For in order to attain a constant sense of 
the divine presence, the way of Muhyi’l-Din al-‘Arabi said:  َوُ(cid:182)  َ
ّ(cid:202)ِا َدوُ(cid:106)ْوَ(cid:174)  َ(cid:202) 
going so far as to deny the existence of the universe. As for the others, again 
to  gain  a  constant  sense  of  the  divine  presence,  they  said:  َوُ(cid:182)  َ
ّ(cid:202)ِا َدوُ(cid:183) ْ(cid:131)َ(cid:174)  َ(cid:202) 
entering a strange state as though casting the universe into absolute oblivion. 
However,  the  knowledge  of  Allah  obtained  from  the  All-Wise  Qur’an 
affords a constant sense of the divine presence, but it neither condemns the 
universe  to  non-existence,  nor  imprisons  it  in  absolute  oblivion.  It  rather 
releases  it  from  its  purposelessness  and  employs  it  in  Almighty  Allah’s 
name. Everything becomes a mirror yielding knowledge of Him. As Sa‘di 
Shirazi said:

In everything a window opens up onto knowledge of Allah.
In  some  of  the  Wo r d s   we  have  illustrated  with  the  following  com-
parison the differences between the way of the scholars of theology and 
the  true  highway  taken  from  the  Qur’an:  in  order  to  have  water,  some 
is  brought  from  a  distant  place  by  means  of  pipes,  tunnelling  through 
mountains. And some of it is obtained by digging wells everywhere. The 
ﬁrst sort is fraught with difﬁculties; the pipes become blocked or broken. 
But those who know how to dig wells and extract water can ﬁnd water 
everywhere with no trouble.

ّ(cid:178)َا ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) ُ

Similarly, utilizing the impossibility of causation and causal sequences, 
the scholars of theology cut the chains of causes at the extremities of the 
world and then proved the existence of the Necessarily Existent One. They 
travelled a long road. However, the true highway of the Wise Qur’an ﬁnds 
water  everywhere  and  extracts  it.  All  its  verses  cause  water  to  ﬂow  forth 
wherever they strike, like the Staff of Moses. Each makes everything recite 
the rule: ٌد ِ(cid:110)اَو ُهَ

ِلﯭﯦ ىِ(cid:158)َو
Furthermore, faith ( î m â n  ) is not gained only through knowledge; many 
of the subtle faculties have their share of it. When food enters the stomach, 
it is distributed in various ways to various members. Similarly, after entering 
the stomach of the mind, the matters of faith that come through knowledge 
are absorbed by the spirit, heart, inner heart, soul, and other subtle faculties; 
each receives its share according to its degree. If they do not receive their 
share, faith is deﬁcient. Muhyi’l-Din al-‘Arabi was reminding Fakhr al-Din 
Razi of this point.

able with the verse, ( 33:72 ) Ã Â Á À? ?

T h e   A n s w e r :  There are explanations in the Eleventh and Twenty-Third 
Wo r d s , and in the Second Fruit of the Fifth Branch of the Twenty-Fourth 
Word. A summary is as follows:

With His perfect power, Almighty Allah makes many things from a sin-
gle thing, causes one thing to perform numerous duties, and writes a thou-
sand  books  on  a  single  page;  so  too  He  created  man  as  a  comprehensive 
species, in place of many species. That is to say, He willed that through man, 

394

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

a  single  species,  functions  would  be  performed  to  the  number  of  the  dif-
ferent levels of all the animal species. For this reason, He placed no innate 
limit on man’s powers and senses, no natural restriction, and left them free. 
Those of the other animals are limited and naturally restricted. Whereas each 
of man’s powers may roam free over an endless distance towards inﬁnity. 
For since he is a mirror to the inﬁnite manifestations of the names of the 
universe’s Creator, his powers have been given an inﬁnite capacity.

For  example,  even  if  the  whole  world  were  given  to  man,  due  to  his 
greed, he would say: ( 50:30 ) Ñ Ð Ï And due to his selﬁshness, he ﬁnds 
it acceptable that a thousand people should suffer harm for his own sake. 
And so on. He may advance endlessly in bad morality and reach the degree 
of the Nimrods and Pharaohs; as is shown by the use of the intensive form 
in the verse above  ( 33:72 ) , he is given to great wrongdoing. Similarly, he 
may manifest endless progress in good morality, and rise to the level of the 
prophets and veracious ones.

Moreover, contrary to the animals, man is ignorant about all the things 
necessary for life and is compelled to learn everything. He is in need of innu-
merable things, and therefore in accordance with the intensive form in the 
same verse, is “ most ignorant. ” But when animals come into the world, they 
need few things, and what they do need, everything necessary for their lives, 
they may learn in a couple of months, or even a couple of days, or in some 
cases, in a couple of hours. It is as if they have been perfected in another 
world and come thus. But man can only rise to his feet in one or two years, 
and only in ﬁfteen can distinguish between what is beneﬁcial and what is 
harmful. The intensive form of “ most ignorant ” indicates this too.

Since  man  himself  and  the  world  in  which  he  lives  are  being  continu-

individual human being consists of many individuals. He may be considered 
a different individual to the number of the years of his life, or to the number 
of its days or even hours. For since a single individual is subject to time,

he is like a model and each passing day clothes him in the form of another 
individual.

Furthermore,  just  as  there  is  within  man  this  plurality  and  renewal,  so 
also  is  the  world  in  which  he  lives  in  motion.  It  goes  and  is  replaced  by 
another. It varies constantly. Every day opens the door of another world. As 
for faith, it is both the light of the life of each individual in that person, and 

it is the light of the world in which he lives. And as for ُ
with which to turn on the light.

َ(cid:202) it is a key 

Then the instinctual soul, desire, doubts, and Satan exercise great inﬂu-
ence over man. In order to damage his faith, they are much of the time able 
to take advantage of his negligence, to trick him with their wiles, and thus to 
extinguish the light of belief with doubts and uncertainty. Also, man is prone 
to act and utter words which apparently oppose the Shari‘a, and which in the 
view of some religious authorities are no less than unbelief. Therefore, there 
is a need to renew belief all the time, every hour, every day.

Q u e s t i o n :  The masters of scholastic theology wrapped up the world in the 
abbreviated concepts of contingency and createdness and having disposed 
of it, so to speak, proved divine unity. And one school of Suﬁs, in order to 
experience Allah’s presence and afﬁrm His unity fully, said: َوُ(cid:182)  َ
ّ(cid:202)ِا َدوُ(cid:183) ْ(cid:131)َ(cid:174)  َ(cid:202) 
They thus forgot the universe and drew the veil of oblivion over it, and then 
fully experienced the divine presence. Another school of Suﬁs, in order to 
truly afﬁrm divine unity and enter Allah’s presence at the highest degree, 
said:  َوُ(cid:182)  َ
ّ(cid:202)ِا َدوُ(cid:106)ْوَ(cid:174)  َ(cid:202) They relegated the universe to the level of imagination 
and  cast  it  into  non-existence,  and  then  fully  entered  the  divine  presence. 
But you point out that in the Qur’an is a mighty highway besides these three 
ways. And you say that its mark is the phrases: َوُ(cid:182)  َ
ّ(cid:202)ِا َدوُ(cid:93)ْ(cid:151)َ(cid:174)  َ(cid:202) 
Can you show me a brief proof of the afﬁrmation of divine unity that this 
highway provides and point out a short way leading to it?

ّ(cid:202)ِا َدو ُ(cid:135)ْ(cid:163)َ(cid:174)  َ(cid:202)  * َوُ(cid:182)  َ

T h e   A n s w e r :  All the Wo r d s  and L e t t e r s  of the R i s a l e - i   N u r  point out that 
highway. For now, as you wish, we shall indicate concisely an extensive, 
lengthy and mighty proof of it.

Every thing in the world ascribes every other thing to its own Creator. 
And every artistically fashioned object in this world demonstrates that all 
such objects are the works of its own fashioner. And every creative act in 
the universe proves that all creative acts are the acts of its author. And every 

ٰ
396

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

name that is manifested in beings indicates that all names are the names and 
titles of the one whom it signiﬁes. That is to say, every thing is a direct proof 
of divine unity and a window yielding knowledge of Allah.

An object, especially if it is animate, is a miniature specimen of the uni-
verse, a seed of the world, and a fruit of the globe of the earth. Since this is 
so, the one who created the miniature specimen, seed and fruit must also be 
the one who created the universe. For the creator of the fruit cannot be other 
than the creator of the tree that bears it.

And so, in the same way that every object ascribes every other object to 
its own fashioner, every act ascribes every other act to its author. For we 
see that each creative act appears as the tip of a law of creativity that is so 
extensive as to encompass most other creatures, and so long as to reach from 
particles to galaxies. That is to say, whoever performs the creative act must 
be the author of all the creative acts which are tied to the universal law that 
encompasses those beings and stretches from particles to galaxies.

For sure, the one who gives life to a ﬂy must be the one who creates all 
insects and animals and who gives life to the earth. And whoever spins par-
ticles as though they were Mevlevi dervishes must be the one who sets suc-
cessive beings in motion as far as the sun travelling through the skies with its 
planets. For the law is a chain and the creative acts are tied to it.

That is to say, just as all objects ascribe all other objects to their fash-
ioner and all creative acts attribute all other acts to their author, in exactly 
the same way, every divine name manifested in the universe ascribes every 
other name to the One whom it describes and proves that they are His titles. 
For the names manifested in the universe are like intersecting circles, blend-
ing one with the other like the seven colours in light; they assist one another 
and perfect and adorn one another’s works of art.

For example, the instant the name Giver of Life is manifested on a thing 
and life is given, the name All-Wise also becomes manifest; it orders the body 
which is that animate creature’s dwelling-place with wisdom. At the same 
time, the name Muniﬁcent is manifested; it adorns the creature’s dwelling-
place. So too, the manifestation of the name All-Compassionate appears; it 
presents the body’s needs benevolently. At the same instant, the manifes-
tation  of  the  name  Provider  appears;  it  supplies  the  material  and  spiritual 
sustenance necessary for the continued existence of the animate creature in 
unexpected ways. And so on. This means that to whomever the name Giver 
of Life belongs, the name All-Wise, which is luminous and comprehensive 
in the universe, is also His. The name All-Compassionate, which nurtures 

TWENTY-SIXTH LETTER – FOURTH TOPIC

397

all creatures kindly, is His too. And the name Provider, which sustains all 
animate creatures muniﬁcently, is His name and title. And so on.

That is to say, every name, every act, every object is a proof of divine 
unity, and a proof that is a stamp of divine unity ( v a h d a n i y e t  ) and a seal 
of divine oneness ( e h a d i y e t  ) which has been inscribed on the pages of the 
universe and on the lines of the centuries. All of them indicate that all the 
words of the universe, which are called beings, are inscriptions traced by the 
pen of its own scribe.

S e c o n d l y :   You  ask  in  your  letter  whether  ُ

َ(cid:202)  is  sufﬁcient  on  its 
own. That is, intending the second part, you ask: can someone who does not 
ّ(cid:195)ا ُلو ُ(cid:126)َر ٌد َ

we shall only say this:

ّ(cid:202)ِا َهٰ(cid:170)ِا  ٓ

The two parts of the confession of faith cannot be separated; they prove 
each other, comprise each other; one cannot be without the other. Since the 
Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) was the Seal of the Proph-
ets and the heir of all the prophets, he is at the start of all the ways leading 
to Allah. There can be no way to reality and salvation outside his mighty 
highway. All the leading gnostics and veriﬁers of reality have said like Sa‘di 
Shirazi:

They also said:  َ

And it sometimes happens that they do not know the Prophet ( UWBP ), 

but the road they have taken is part of his highway.

It  happens  too  that  because  they  are  in  a  state  of  ecstasy  or  entirely 
immersed in contemplation or have withdrawn from the world, they do not 

think of the highway of Muhammad, and ُ

Nevertheless, the most important side of the matter is this: non-accept-
ance is one thing, while the acceptance of non-being is another. Ecstatics 
and  recluses  or  those  who  have  not  heard  or  are  uninformed  about  it,  do 
not know the Prophet ( UWBP ) or they do not think of him that they might 
َ(cid:202) only in 
accept him. They are ignorant in that respect. They know ُ
respect of esoteric knowledge of Him. They may well be saved. But if those 
people who have heard of the Prophet ( UWBP ) and know his message do 
not afﬁrm him, they do not recognize Almighty Allah. For them, the phrase 
ّ(cid:195)ا  َ
َ(cid:202) on its own does not express divine unity, the afﬁrmation of which 
is a means of salvation. For this is not ignorant non-acceptance, which may 
be excusable to a degree, it is rather the acceptance of non-being, which is 
denial. The person who denies Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and 
peace ), who with his miracles and works was the pride of the universe and 
glory of mankind, certainly cannot receive any light and will not recognize 
Allah. However, that is enough for now.

Sixth Matter

S i x t h   M a t t e r

T h i r d l y :  Some of the terms used in the First Topic, which is about Satan’s 
way and is called D i s p u t e  Wi t h  t h e  D e v i l ,  were very vehement, although they 
were modiﬁed with expressions like “ Allah forbid! Allah forbid! ” and “ to 
suppose  the  impossible. ”  They  still  make  me  tremble.  There  were  a  few 
small modiﬁcations in the piece that was later sent to you; have you been 
able to correct your copy accordingly? It’s up to you to do what you think; 
you can skip any of the expressions you think unnecessary.

My  dear  brother,  that  Topic  holds  great  importance,  because  Satan  is 
the  atheists’  master.  Only  when  he  is  silenced  will  his  imitators  cease  to 
be deceived. The fact that the All-Wise Qur’an mentions the unbelievers’ 
vile  expressions  gave  me  courage.  In  order  to  demonstrate  the  complete 
worthlessness of that diabolical way, trembling and by way of supposing the 
impossible, I used the ridiculous expressions the members of Satan’s Party 
are compelled by their way to accept and which willy nilly they utter through 
its tongue. And by using them, we cornered them at the bottom of the well 
and took possession of the whole ﬁeld on account of the Qur’an; we exposed 
their frauds. Consider the victory through the following comparison:

For example, let us imagine a tall minaret the top of which touches the 
skies, and at the base of which a well has been dug that goes down to the 
centre of the earth. Two groups are disputing over proving where, between 

ٰ
ُ

the top of the minaret and the bottom of the well, a man stands for his call to 
prayer to be heard by all the people throughout the country. The ﬁrst group 
says: “ He has to be at the top of the minaret reciting the call to prayer to the 
universe, because we hear it. It is vibrant; it is lofty. For sure everyone can-
not see him in that high position, but everyone can see him according to their 
degree on one of the steps when he climbs the minaret and when he descends 
it. They know that he ascends it, and that wherever it is that he appears, he 
is someone of high stature. ” However, the other, satanic and foolish, group 
says: “ No, his position is not at the top of the minaret; it’s at the bottom of 
the well, wherever it is he appears. ” But no one at all has seen him at the bot-
tom of the well, nor can they see him there. Let us suppose he was as heavy 
and lacking in will as a stone; surely he would have been at the bottom of the 
well and someone would have seen him there.

Now, the battleﬁeld of these two opposing groups is the long distance 
stretching from the top of the minaret to the bottom of the well. The people 
of light, called Allah’s Party, point out the m u ’ e z z i n  at the top of the mina-
ret to those with a lofty view. And to those whose sight cannot rise that far 
and to the short-sighted, they point him out on a step each according to his 
degree. A slight hint is enough for them, proving that the m u ’ e z z i n  is not a 
lifeless block of stone, but a perfect man who climbs upwards and appears 
and makes the call to prayer when he wishes. As for the other group, known 
as  Satan’s  Party,  they  pronounce  stupidly:  “ Show  him  to  everyone  at  the 
top of the minaret, or else his place is the bottom of the well. ” In their folly 
they do not know that he is not shown to everyone at the top of the minaret 
because everyone’s sight does not rise that far. Also, in exaggerated fashion, 
they want to claim possession of the whole distance with the exception of 
the top of the minaret.

Then someone appears intending to solve the dispute between the two 
communities.  He  says  to  Satan’s  Party:  “ You  inauspicious  group!  If  the 
supreme m u ’ e z z i n ’s  position was at the bottom of the well, he would have 
been as lifeless, inanimate, and powerless as a stone. It could not have been 
him who appeared on the well’s steps and minaret’s degrees. Since you saw 
him on the latter, he is certain not to be powerless and lifeless. His position 
must be at the top of the minaret. In which case, either show that he is at the 
bottom of the well – which you can’t, nor can you make anyone believe that 
he is there – or be silent! The arena of your defence is the well bottom. The 
remaining space and that long distance is the arena of this blessed commu-
nity; they have only to point him out somewhere other than at the bottom of 
the well, to win the case. ”

Like this comparison, the Topic about the dispute with the Devil takes 
the long distance from the divine throne to the ground from Satan’s Party 
and forcibly drives them into a corner. It leaves the most irrational, the most 
impossible, the most loathsome place to them. It drives them into a hole so 
narrow no one could enter it and takes possession of the entire distance in 
the name of the Qur’an.

If they are asked what the Qur’an is and they reply: “ It is a good book, 
written by man, that teaches good morality, ” they should be told: “ It must 
then be the Word of Allah and you have to accept it as such, for according to 
your way, you cannot say that it is ‘good’! ”

If they are asked what they know about the Prophet ( UWBP ), and they 
reply: “ He was a very clever person with good morals, ” they should be 
told: “ You should believe in him in that case, because if he was very moral 
and clever, he must have been Allah’s Messenger. You say he was ‘good,’ 
but that is unacceptable according to your creed; you can’t say that. ” And 
so on. Further aspects of the reality can be applied to other facets of the 
comparison.

In consequence, the First Topic, in which the Devil is disputed with, does 
not mean that the believers have to know about the miracles of Muhammad 
( UWBP ) and learn about their certain proofs in order to preserve their faith. 
A slight hint, a small indication, will save it. All the deeds, all the qualities, 
all the conduct of Muhammad ( UWBP ) are miracles of a sort, proving that 
his position is at the highest of the high, not at the lowest of the low at the 
bottom of the well.

Seventh Matter

An instructive matter:

S e v e n t h   M a t t e r

[ Because  some  of  my  friends  have  groundless  worries  and  are 
becoming  dispirited,  I  am  obliged  to  relate  a  dominical  favour  and 
an instance of divine protection which pertain solely to service of the 
Qur’an, in order to strengthen their morale, and since they have that 
weak vein of temperament, to save them. What I have to say is sug-
gested by seven signs. Four of them show how those friends received 
blows entirely contrary to their intentions, as a result of their taking 
up  hostile  positions  towards  me  not  personally  but  because  I  serve 
the  Qur’an,  purely  for  worldly  aims  and  despite  being  friends.  The 
three other signs denote earnest and constant friends who in order to 

TWENTY-SIXTH LETTER – FOURTH TOPIC

401

ﬁnd favour with the worldly 1 and achieve some worldly goal, and so 
that they could feel conﬁdent, temporarily failed to display the manly 
stance demanded by friendship. However, regretably, all those three 
friends were punished in ways that were the opposite of what they had 
intended. ]

The ﬁrst four, who were seemingly friends but later displayed enmity:
The First: Employing various means, a District Ofﬁcer begged me for a 
copy of the Tenth Word. I gave him one. But then, in order to be promoted, 
he spurned my friendship and turned hostile to me. This took the form of 
complaining to the Governor and informing on me. But as a mark of favour 
for service of the Qur’an, he was not promoted, but dismissed.

The Second: Another District Ofﬁcer assumed a competitive and hostile 
stance towards me although he was a friend, for the sake of his superiors and 
to attract the attention of the worldly, but he received a blow contrary to his 
intentions. He was sentenced to two and a half years’ imprisonment owing 
to some unforeseen matter. Later he asked for prayers from a servant of the 
Qur’an. Perhaps he will be saved, Allah willing, since prayers were offered 
for him.

The Third: A teacher appeared to be a friend and I looked on him as one. 
Then he moved to Barla to settle there and he chose to adopt a hostile stance. 
But he received a blow contrary to his intentions: he was posted away from 
teaching to serve in the army. He was sent away from Barla.

The Fourth: There was a teacher, who because he seemed to me to be 
both a h a ﬁ z  2 and pious, I was sincerely friendly towards in the hope that he 
would show friendship to me by serving the Qur’an. Then, in order to curry 
favour with the worldly, he behaved very coldly towards us and was fright-
ened, because of one single thing an ofﬁcial had said. He too received a blow 
contrary to his intentions: he was severely reprimanded by the inspector, and 
dismissed.

These four men received those blows because of their animosity. How-
ever, the following three friends did not display the manly attitude that seri-
ous friendship demands, and so received not blows, but warnings contrary 
to their intentions, which were admonitions of a sort.

T h e   F i r s t :  A respected person who was a most important, serious, and 
true student of mine used to write out the Wo r d s  continually and disseminate 

1.  “ The worldly ” (   e h l - i   d ü n y a   ) : those people whose view is restricted to the life of 

this world and who disregard the hereafter, or those who sell religion for this world. 

2.  H â ﬁ z :  a person who has memorized the Qur’an.

them. But when a confused high ofﬁcial arrived and an incident occurred, he 
hid the Wo r d s  he had written. He also temporarily gave up copying them out 
in the hope that he would not suffer any difﬁculty or hardship at the hands of 
the worldly and would be safe from their evil. But as a mark of his error of 
temporarily ceasing to serve the Qur’an, for a year he continuously suffered 
the calamity of having a thousand-lira ﬁne hanging over him, which he had 
to pay. Then the moment he formed the intention to write out more copies 
and returned to his former position, he was cleared in the case, till ﬁnally, 
praise be to Allah, he was acquitted. He was poor and needy, and was saved 
from paying a thousand l i r a s .

T h e   S e c o n d :  Intending to gain the good opinion of the worldly and the 
new ofﬁcer, a courageous, serious, and bold friend of mine of ﬁve years’ 
standing  unthinkingly  and  involuntarily  did  not  meet  with  me  for  several 
months, despite being my neighbour. He did not even pay me a visit dur-
ing Ramadan or the Festival. But the village question turned out exactly the 
opposite of what he had intended, and he lost his inﬂuence.

T h e   T h i r d :  A h a ﬁ z  who used to visit me once or twice a week became 
the prayer-leader, and so that he could wear the turban, deserted me for two 
months. He did not even visit me during the Festival. But contrary to his 
intention, and contrary to usual practice, he was not allowed to wear a tur-
ban, even after seven or eight months.

There have been numerous incidents like these, but I have not mentioned 
them so as not to offend the people concerned. Each of them is only a sign, 
but  when  they  are  put  together  one  perceives  a  strength.  It  gives  one  the 
conviction that – not directed towards myself, for I do not consider myself 
worthy of any favour, but purely in respect of serving the Qur’an – we carry 
out that service under dominical protection and through divine grace. My 
friends should think of this and not be carried away by groundless fears. I 
have explained these things to them privately because our service is a divine 
bestowal, and because it is the cause of thanks not pride, and because the 
Qur’an commands:

E i g h t h   M a t t e r

[ This forms the footnote to the third example in the Third Point about 
the  ﬁfth  of  the  obstacles  to  making  independent  judgements  of  the 
divine law ( ijtihad ), in the Twenty-Seventh Word. ]

A n   I m p o r t a n t   Q u e s t i o n :  Some of the veriﬁers of reality have said that 
each  of  the  words  of  the  Qur’an  and  of  supplications  and  other  gloriﬁca-
tions of Allah illuminate man’s spiritual faculties in numerous ways, provid-
ing spiritual sustenance. But if the meanings are not known, just to say the 
words is insufﬁcient. The words are a garment; would it not be more useful 
if  they  were  changed,  and  every  group  clothed  the  meanings  in  words  of 
their own language?

T h e   A n s w e r :   The  words  of  the  Qur’an  and  of  the  gloriﬁcations  of  the 
Prophet ( UWBP ) are not lifeless garments; they are like the living skin of 
a body; indeed, with the passage of time, they have become the skin. Gar-
ments  are  changed,  but  the  body  would  be  harmed  if  the  skin  were  to  be 
changed. Blessed words like those of the ﬁve daily prayers and the call to 
prayer have become the mark and sign of their usual meanings. And marks 
and signs cannot be changed. I have often observed in myself an inner state 
which I experience. It is a fact, and is this:

On  the  Day  of  ‘Arafa,  the  eve  of  the  Festival  of  Sacriﬁces,  I  used  to 
recite Sura al-Ikhlas hundreds of times. 1 I would observe that some of the 
non-physical senses in me would receive the sustenance several times, then 
would cease to do so and stop. Others like the faculty of reﬂective thought 
would turn towards the meaning for a time, receive their share, then they too 
would stop. And some like the heart would receive their share in respect of 
certain concepts that yielded a spiritual pleasure, then they too would fall 
silent. And so on. Gradually, with repetition only a few of the subtle facul-
ties would remain, becoming wearied long after the others. They would per-
sist, leaving no need for further study and meanings. Heedlessness did not 
have an adverse effect on them, as it did on the faculty of thought. The usual 
meanings, of which they were the marks and signs, and abbreviated mean-
ings of the expressive words, were enough for them. To think of the meaning 
at that point would have caused harmful boredom. Anyway, the subtle facul-
ties that persist do not need to study and comprehend but to recollect, turn

towards, and be prompted. And the words that are like skin are sufﬁcient for 
them and perform the duty of meaning. They are means of constant efful-
gence especially when it is recalled through those Arabic words that they are 
the Word of Allah and divine speech.

This state, which I myself experienced, shows that it is extremely harm-
ful to express in another language truths like the call to prayer and the t e s -
b i h a t  following the obligatory prayers, and frequently repeated Suras of the 
Qur’an like Fatiha and Ikhlas. For when the perpetual spring of the divine 
words and words of the Prophet ( UWBP ) are lost, the perpetual share of 
those perpetual subtle faculties is also lost. Also harmful are the loss of the 
minimum of ten merits for each word, and the heedlessness and darkness of 
spirit caused by the human terms of the translations, since the constant sense 
of the divine presence does continue for everyone throughout the prayers.

ّ(cid:195)ا  َ

ّ(cid:202)ِا َهٰ(cid:170)ِا  ٓ

Yes, just like Imam-i A‘zam said that ُ

َ(cid:202) is the mark and sign of 
the afﬁrmation of divine unity, so we say the following: the great majority 
of  the  words  of  divine  gloriﬁcation  and  praise,  and  especially  of  those  of 
the call to prayer and obligatory prayers, have come to be marks and signs. 
Like signs, their usual religious meanings are understood, rather than their 
literal  meanings.  So  according  to  the  Shari‘a,  it  is  not  possible  to  change 
them. Even an uneducated man can learn the gist of them, which all believ-
ers should know; that is, their meanings in summary. How can those people 
who pass their whole lives with Islam yet ﬁll their heads with endless trivia 
be excused from learning in one or two weeks the gist of what these blessed 
words mean, which are the key to eternal life? How can they be Muslims? 
How  can  they  be  called  “ reasonable  people ”?  It  surely  is  not  reasonable 
to destroy the protective cases of those springs of light for the sake of lazy 
loafers like them!

Furthermore, whatever nation a person belongs to, he understands from 
“ S u b h a n a l l a h ! Glory be to Allah! ” that he is declaring Almighty Allah free 
of all defect. Isn’t this enough? If he inclines towards the meaning in his own 
language, he will study it once with his intellect. But if he repeats it a hun-
dred times a day in its proper form, apart from his intellect’s share of study-
ing, the gist of it, which is derived from the words and spreads and blends 
with them, will produce many lights and much effulgence. The sacredness 
he  receives  from  the  words  being  divine  speech,  and  the  effulgence  and 
lights proceeding from the sacredness, are especially important.

I n   S h o r t :   Nothing  at  all  can  replace  the  sacred  divine  words  that  are 
the protective cases of the essentials of religion, and nothing can substitute 

ٰ
TWENTY-SIXTH LETTER – FOURTH TOPIC

405

them, and nothing else can perform their functions. Even if they can express 
them temporarily, they cannot do so permanently or in sacred and elevated 
fashion. As for the words that are the protective cases of the theoretical mat-
ters of religion, there is no necessity for them to be changed. For such a need 
is met by preaching, teaching, advice, and other instruction.

To Conclude: The comprehensiveness of the grammatical Arabic lan-
guage and the miraculousness of the Qur’an’s words make them untranslat-
able. I can say even that their translation is impossible. Anyone who doubts 
this should refer to the Twenty-Fifth Word. What they call translations are 
abbreviated,  deﬁcient  approximations.  How  can  such  approximations  be 
compared with the living, true meanings of the Qur’an’s verses, which have 
many aspects of ramiﬁcation?

Ninth Matter

N i n t h   M a t t e r

[ An important, conﬁdential matter, and a mystery related to sainthood. ]
The largest group in the World of Islam, the people of truth and modera-
tion,  called  the  A h l   a l - S u n n a   w a ’ l - J a m a ‘ a t   or  Sunnis,  have  preserved  the 
truths of the Qur’an and faith by following to the letter the illustrious prac-
tices ( T. s ü n n e t ; Ar. s u n n a  ) of the Prophet ( UWBP ) within the bounds of 
moderation. The great majority of the saints have emerged from within this 
sphere. Others have appeared outside it and on a path opposed to some of the 
Sunnis’ principles and rules. Observers of this latter category have divided 
into two groups:

One group has denied their sainthood because they oppose the Sunnis’ 
principles. This group has even gone so far as to declare some of those saints 
unbelievers.

The other group consists of their followers. They accept their sainthood 
and say: “ The truth is not restricted to the Sunnis’ way. ” They have formed 
a group of innovators and have taken the path of misguidance. They do not 
know that everyone who is rightly-guided cannot be a guide. Their shaikhs 
are to be excused for their mistakes because they are ecstatics, but their fol-
lowers may not be excused.

As for the middle group, they do not deny the saints’ sainthood, but do 
not accept their ways and paths. They say: “ Any things they say that are 
opposed  to  the  principles  [ of  religion ]  are  either  metaphorical  utterances 
the meaning of which is not known, or they [ the saints ] are in error, being 
overcome by their inward states. ”

406

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

Unfortunately, intending to protect the Sunni way, the ﬁrst group, espe-
cially  literalist  scholars,  have  denied  saints  of  great  importance  and  been 
compelled  to  accuse  them  of  misguidance.  While  the  saints’  supporters, 
which form the second group, have abandoned the right path due to their 
excessive good will towards shaikhs of that sort; they have fallen into inno-
vation, and even misguidance.

In connection with this, for a long time a matter preoccupied my mind: 
at a crucial time I execrated a group of the people of misguidance. Then an 
awesome  collective  strength  arose  in  the  face  of  my  malediction;  it  both 
turned it back on me and prevented me from repeating it.

Then I saw that facilitated by a collective strength in its wrongful activi-
ties, that group of the people of misguidance was dragging the people along 
behind it. It was being successful. This was not due to compulsion alone; 
rather, since it had combined with a desire aroused by the power of saint-
hood, some of the believers were being carried away by it; they looked on 
the group favourably and did not consider it to be too bad.

I took fright when I perceived these two secrets. “ Glory be to Allah! ” I 
exclaimed, “ can there be a sainthood other than that of the true way? Would 
the people of reality support such a terrible current of misguidance? ” Then 
one  blessed  Day  of  ‘Arafat,  following  a  praiseworthy  Islamic  practice,  I 
recited Sura al-Ikhlas hundreds of times and through its blessings, the matter 
entitled “ Answer to an Important Question ” was imparted to my impotent 
heart, together with the following truth, through divine mercy: 

As  is  told  in  the  well-known,  meaningful  story  of  Jibali  Baba,  which 
dates from the time of Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, some saints are in a 
state of ecstasy while appearing to be rational and reasonable. Others some-
times appear to be sober and in command of their reasoning faculties, and 
sometimes they enter a state outside this. One class of this sort are confused 
and cannot distinguish between things. They apply a matter they see while in 
a state of intoxication to things after they have returned to a state of sobriety. 
They are then in error but do not realize it. Some ecstatics are preserved by 
Allah and do not enter misguidance on their spiritual journeying. But others 
are not preserved, and may be found in the sects following innovation and 
misguidance. They have even been held to be unbelievers.

Thus, because they are temporarily or permanently in a state of ecstasy, 
they resemble “ blessed lunatics. ” And because they resemble them, they are 
not responsible. And because they are not responsible, they are not punish-
able. On their ecstatic sainthood persisting, they come to support the people 

TWENTY-SIXTH LETTER – FOURTH TOPIC

407

of  misguidance  and  innovation;  they  spread  their  ways  to  an  extent,  and 
inauspiciously cause some believers and people of truth to enter them.

Tenth Matter

Te n t h   M a t t e r

[ It was requested by some friends that a principle concerning visitors 
be explained. That is the reason this was written. ]

It  should  be  known  that  those  who  visit  me  either  come  in  respect  of 
worldly life, and that door is closed; or they come in respect of the life of the 
hereafter, and in that respect there are two doors: either they come supposing 
my person to be blessed and to possess high spiritual rank, and that door is 
closed too. For I do not like myself and I do not like people who like me. All 
thanks be to Almighty Allah that He did not make me like myself. Or they 
come purely in respect of my being a herald of the All-Wise Qur’an. I will-
ingly accept anyone who enters by this door. Such people are of three sorts: 
they are either friends, or brothers, or students.

The  characteristics  of  friends  and  conditions  of  their  friendship: 
They  have  to  earnestly  support  our  work  and  service  connected  with  the 
Wo r d s  and the lights of the Qur’an. They should not support injustice, inno-
vations, or misguidance in heartfelt fashion. They should themselves try to 
proﬁt from the Wo r d s . 

The characteristics of brothers and conditions of their brotherhood: 
Together with truly and earnestly working to disseminate the  Wo r d s , they 
should perform the ﬁve obligatory prayers and not commit the seven griev-
ous sins.

The characteristics of students and conditions of their studentship: 
To feel as though the Wo r d s  are their own property written by themselves, 
and to know their vital duty, their life’s work, to be the service and dissemi-
nation of them.

These three levels are connected with my three personalities. A friend is 
connected with my individual, essential personality. A brother is connected 
with  the  personality  that  springs  from  my  worship  and  bondsmanship  of 
Almighty Allah. And a student is connected with the personality that under-
takes the duties of herald of the Wise Qur’an and teacher.

Such meetings yield three fruits:
The First: In regard to being herald, it is to receive instruction about the 
jewels of the Qur’an from either myself or the  Wo r d s . Even if it is only a 
single lesson.

408

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

The Second: In respect of worship, it is to have a share of my gains of 

the hereafter.

The Third: It is to turn together towards the divine court, and binding 
our  hearts  to  Almighty  Allah  and  seeking  success  and  guidance,  to  work 
together in the service of the All-Wise Qur’an.

If a student, every morning he is with me in name and sometimes also in 

imagination, and he receives a share.

If a brother, he is several times together with me with his particular name 
and form in my supplications and gains, and he receives a share. Then he is 
included among all the brothers, and I hand him over to divine mercy so that 
when I say “ my brothers and sisters ” in prayer, he is among them. If I do not 
know them, divine mercy knows them and sees them.

If  a  friend  who  performs  the  obligatory  prayers  and  gives  up  grievous 
sins, he is included in my prayers together with all the brothers. My condi-
tion is that all three categories include me in their supplications and spiritual 
gains.

S e c o n d l y :  You want me to interpret now the dream you had three years 
ago  three  days  after  meeting  me,  whose  meaning  has  long  since  become 
apparent. That beautiful, happy, and auspicious dream has been consigned 
to the past, so I’m right to say the following regarding it, am I not?

Yes,  my  brother,  we  have  become  accustomed  to  discussing  with  you 
teachings concerning pure reality ( h a k i k a t  ), but to study dreams, the doors 
of which are open to fancy and illusion in order to ascertain reality, is not 
completely in keeping with our way of researching into and verifying real-
ity. So in connection with that minor incident of sleep, we shall explain six 
points about the reality of sleep, the small brother of death,  3 according to 
scholarly principles and from the angle indicated by verses of the Qur’an. In 
the seventh, we shall offer a brief interpretation of your dream.

Just  as  an  important  element  of  Sura  Yusuf  is  Joseph’s  dream,  so  the 

Qur’an indicates with many of its verses, such as:

that dreams and sleep may hold important, though veiled, truths.

The Second

The First

The Second

Veriﬁers of reality do not favour trusting in the interpretation of dreams 
and taking of omens through the Qur’an. For the All-Wise Qur’an strikes 
at  the  unbelievers  frequently  and  severely,  and  if  such  severity  is  shown 
towards the person who takes omens, it causes him to despair and confuses 
his heart. Dreams also, because although they are good they are thought to 
be evil and sometimes appear to be opposed to reality, may cause a person 
to fall into despair, destroy his morale, and make him think badly of things. 
There are many dreams the meanings and interpretations of which are very 
good although the form they take is terrifying, injurious, or unclean. Not eve-
ryone can discover the relation between the form a dream takes and its true 
meaning, so they become unnecessarily anxious, despairing, and unhappy. It 
was only because of this aspect of dreams that, like Imam-i Rabbani and the 

veriﬁers of reality, I said at the beginning:

An  authentic  Hadith  states  that  one  of  the  forty  parts  of  prophethood 
was made manifest in the form of true dreams during sleep, 1 which means 
that true dreams are both valid and have a connection with the functions of 
prophethood. This Third Point is both important, and lengthy and profound, 
and related to prophethood, so I am postponing it to another time and not 
opening this door for now.

Dreams are of three sorts. 2 Two of them, in the words of the Qur’an, are 
( 12:44 ) # " and not worth interpreting. If they have any meaning, 
it is of no importance. Either due to some ailment, the power of imagination 
mixes things up and depicts them accordingly; or it recalls some stimulating

event that happened to the person that day, or previously, or even at the same 
time a year or two earlier, and it modiﬁes and reproduces it in some other 
form. These are both # " and not worth interpreting.

The  third  sort  are  true  dreams.  When  the  senses  that  bind  man  to  the 
Manifest  World  and  roam  in  it  rest  and  cease  their  activity,  the  domini-
cal subtle faculty in man’s make-up forms a direct relation with World of 
the Unseen and opens up a window onto it. Through the window, it looks 
on events that are in preparation; it comes face to face with the manifesta-
tions of the Preserved Tablet and some samples of the missives of divine 
determining; it beholds some true occurrences. Sometimes the imagination 
governs in such dreams, dressing them in the garments of form. There are 
numerous types and levels of this sort of dream. Sometimes they turn out 
exactly as dreamed; sometimes they turn out slightly obscured, as though 
under a ﬁne veil; and sometimes they turn out heavily veiled.

It is narrated in Hadiths that the dreams Allah’s Most Noble Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) had at the outset of the revelations 
turned out as true and clear as the breaking of morning. 1

True  dreams  are  a  higher  development  of  premonitions.  Everyone  has 
premonitions to a greater or lesser degree. Animals even have them. At one 
time  I  discovered  two  senses  including  premonition  scientiﬁcally,  addi-
tional to the well-known external and inner senses such as the unconscious 
instinctive senses that impel and stimulate, and hearing and sight. Philoso-
phers  and  the  people  of  misguidance  mistakenly  and  foolishly  call  those 
little known senses “ natural instinct. ” Allah forbid! They are not “ natural ” 
instinct; divine determining impels human beings and animals through a sort 
of innate inspiration. For example, if some animals like cats lose their sight, 
through  this  impulse  of  divine  determining,  they  go  and  ﬁnd  a  plant  that 
heals their eyes and rub it on them, and they get better.

Also, birds of prey like eagles, which, similarly to the public health ofﬁ-
cials  of  the  earth  are  charged  with  the  duty  of  removing  the  carcasses  of 
nomadic  animals,  are  informed  through  that  impulse  of  divine  determin-
ing, that inspiration of the sense of premonition, that divine drive, of animal 
remains a day’s distance away, and they go and ﬁnd them.

Also, a young bee newly come into the world, ﬂies a day’s distance when 
only a day old without losing its way, and through that drive of divine deter-
mining and inspiring impulse, returns to its hive. 

even a saying in Kurdish which goes: (cid:303)ـَ(cid:301)(cid:314) ِر َو (cid:309)ِ(cid:292)  ْرا َ(cid:239)ْ(cid:300) َ(cid:378)אَ(cid:330) (cid:303)َ(cid:301)(cid:315)ِ(cid:214)

Also, it happens frequently to everyone that while speaking of someone, 
the  door  opens  and  totally  unexpectedly  the  same  person  enters.  There  is 
ِڤאَ(cid:300) “ Talk of 
the wolf and ready your gun, for it’s bound to appear. ” That is to say, through 
a premonition, that dominical subtle faculty perceives the person’s arrival in 
summary  fashion.  But  since  the  conscious  mind  does  not  comprehend  it, 
it prompts him to speak of it, not intentionally but involuntarily. Intuitive 
people sometimes say that someone is coming, almost miraculously. At one 
time I myself, even, was acutely sensitive in this way. I wanted to incorpo-
rate the condition into a principle, but was unable to adapt it and couldn’t. 
However, in righteous people, and particularly the people of sainthood, pre-
monition develops to a high degree, showing its effects wondrously.

(cid:243)ُ(cid:348) 

Thus, ordinary people even may manifest a sort of sainthood by virtue 
of which in true dreams, they dream of things appertaining to the Unseen 
and  the  future  like  the  saints.  Yes,  for  ordinary  people,  in  respect  of  true 
dreams sleep may resemble a degree of sainthood. So too, it is for every-
one a splendid dominical cinema. However, those with good morals think 
good thoughts, and someone who has good thoughts dreams of good things. 
But  since  those  with  bad  morals  think  bad  thoughts,  they  dream  of  bad 
things. Furthermore, for everyone, true dreams are windows in the Mani-
fest World that look onto the World of the Unseen. For restricted, ephem-
eral human beings, they are also an arena of inﬁnite proportions manifest-
ing a sort of eternity, and a place for gazing on the past and the future as 
though they were the present. They are also a resting-place for beings with 
spirits, crushed as they are beneath the responsibilities of life and who suf-
fer  great  hardship.  It  is  for  reasons  similar  to  these  that  with  verses  like:  
( 78:9 ) A @ ? the All-Wise Qur’an teaches about sleep ( h a k i k a t - i  
n e v m i y e  ), giving it importance.

The Sixth and Most Important

The Sixth and Most Important

Having experienced them numerous times, true dreams have become for 
me  decisive  proofs  at  the  degree  of  absolute  certainty  ( h a k k a l y a k î n  )  that 
divine  determining  encompasses  all  things.  Especially  the  last  few  years, 
these dreams have reached such a degree that they have made me certain

414

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

that  the  most  insigniﬁcant  events  and  unimportant  dealings  and  even  the 
most  commonplace  conversations  I  will  have  the  following  day  are  writ-
ten and ordained before they occur, and that by dreaming of them the night 
before, I have read them not with my tongue but with my eyes. Not once, not 
a hundred times, but perhaps a thousand times, the things I have said in my 
dreams or the people I have dreamt of at night, although I had not thought 
of them at all, have turned out exactly or with little interpretation the follow-
ing day. It means that the most trivial things are both recorded and written 
before they happen. That is to say, there is no chance or coincidence, events 
do not occur haphazardly, they are not without order.

The Seventh

The Seventh

Your  beautiful,  blessed,  and  auspicious  dream  was  very  good  for  the 
Qur’an and for us. Also, time has interpreted it and is interpreting it; there 
is no need for me to do so. Its partial interpretation also turned out well. If 
you study it carefully, you will understand. I shall point out only one or two 
aspects. That is, I shall explain a truth ( h a k i k a t  ). The visions you have had, 
which are like the true meanings ( h a k i k a t  ) of dreams, are the representa-
tions of those true meanings. It is like this: 

That vast ﬁeld was the world of Islam. The mosque at its end was the 
province of Isparta. The muddy water around it was the swamp of the disso-
luteness, idleness, and innovations of the present time. Your swiftly reach-
ing the mosque safely and without being contaminated by the mud was a 
sign  that  you  took  up  the  lights  of  the  Qur’an  before  everyone  else,  and 
had  remained  unspoilt  with  your  heart  uncorrupted.  The  small  congrega-
tion  in  the  mosque  consisted  of  some  of  the  people  who  have  taken  the 
Wo r d s  upon themselves, like Hakkı, Hulûsi, Sabri, Süleyman, Rüştü, Bekir, 
Mustafa, Ali, Zühtü, Lûtﬁ, Husrev, and Re’fet. As for the small platform, it 
was a small village like Barla. The loud voice was an allusion to the power 
and rapid spread of the  Wo r d s . The place assigned to you in the ﬁrst row, 
was that vacated for you by Abdurrahman. The indication and fact that the 
congregation, as though wireless receivers, wanted to make the whole world 
hear its teachings, will turn out at a later date, Allah willing. If the people 
now are like small seeds, with divine assistance, in the future they will all be 
like tall trees and telegraph ofﬁces. As for the turbanned youth, he is some-
one who will work together with Hulûsi, or even surpass him; he is destined 
to become one of the students and those who disseminate the Wo r d s . I can 
think of some of them, but I cannot say deﬁnitely. The youth is someone

who will come into prominence through the power of sainthood. You can 
interpret the remaining points instead of me.

Speaking with friends like you is both agreeable and acceptable, so I have 
spoken at length about this brief matter, and perhaps I have been prodigal. 
But since I began with the intention of showing a way of expounding the 
Qur’an’s verses about sleep, Allah willing, my prodigality will be forgiven, 
or not be prodigality even.

The Second Part,
which is the Second Matter 

[ This was written to put a stop to and solve a signiﬁcant argument about 
the Hadith which describes how Moses ( Upon whom be peace ) struck 
Azra’il ( Upon whom be peace ) in the eye, and the rest of the story. 1  ]
I  heard  a  scholarly  argument  in  Eğridir.  It  was  wrong  to  hold  such  an 
argument especially at this time, but I did not know it was an argument. I 
was asked a question and shown a Hadith in a reliable book marked with a 
(  ق  ) which signiﬁes the agreement of the two Shaikhs [ Bukhari and Mus-
lim ]. They asked me: “ Is it a Hadith or isn’t it? ”

I  replied  that  one  should  have  conﬁdence  in  someone  who,  in  a  relia-
ble book such as that, cites the agreement of the two Shaikhs concerning a 
Hadith; it means it is a Hadith. However, Hadiths may contain allegorical 
obscurities like the Qur’an, and only experts can ascertain their meanings. 
Even the literal meaning of this Hadith suggests that it may belong to the 
allegorical category of those obscure ones. If I had known that it was a point 
of argument, I would not have given such a short answer, and would have 
replied as follows:

Firstly: The primary condition for discussing matters of this sort is to 
argue fairly, intending to discover the truth. It is permissible for those who 
know about the subject to discuss it, so long as they do not do so stubbornly 
nor  give  rise  to  misunderstanding.  Evidence  that  such  an  argument  is  for 
the sake of the truth is that if the truth emerges through the opposite party, 
a person is not upset but pleased. For he will have learned something he did 
not know. If it had emerged through him, he would not have learned much 
and might well have become arrogant.

Secondly: If the argument is about a Hadith, the categories of Hadiths 
have  to  be  known,  as  well  as  the  types  of  implicit  revelation,  and  the 
varieties of prophetic speech. It is not permissible to discuss ambiguous 
Hadiths  among  the  ordinary  people,  and  to  show  off  and  justify  oneself 
like  a  lawyer,  and  to  rely  on  egotism  to  support  one’s  arguments  rather

than on truth and right. The question being broached and argued about is 
having an adverse effect on the minds of the poor ordinary people. They 
cannot comprehend obscure allegorical Hadiths like these, and if they deny 
them, it opens the terrifying door to their also denying deﬁnite, unambigu-
ous Hadiths that they cannot understand with their limited intelligences. If 
they take the Hadith on face value and accept the literal meaning and they 
spread it around, it paves the way for the people of misguidance to object to 
it and call it superstition. Since attention has been attracted to this allegorical 
Hadith unnecessarily and harmfully, and there are many Hadiths of this sort, 
it is essential to offer an explanation that will remove their doubts. Whether 
or not the Hadith is certain, the following fact should be mentioned.

We may deem sufﬁcient the detailed explanations in the treatises we have 
written;  that  is,  the  twelve  principles  in  the  Third  Branch  of  the  Twenty-
Fourth Word, and in the Fourth Branch; and in one of the principles in the 
Introduction in the Nineteenth Letter about the sorts of revelation; and here 
indicate only brieﬂy that truth. It is as follows:

The angels are not restricted to a having single form like human beings; 
although they are individual beings, they are also universals. Azra’il ( Upon 
whom be peace ) is the supervisor of the angels who are charged with taking 
possession of the spirits of the dying.

Q u e s t i o n :  “ Does Azra’il ( UWP ) himself take possession of them, or do 

his helpers do this? ”

There are three “ ways ” in this matter:
The  First  Way:  Azra’il  ( Upon  whom  be  peace )  takes  possession  of 
every dying person’s spirit. Nothing is an obstacle to another, for he is lumi-
nous. Something luminous can be present in innumerable places by means 
innumerable mirrors and appear in them. The similitudes of luminous beings 
possess their characteristics; they may be deemed the same as them and not 
other than them. The sun’s image in mirrors displays it’s light and heat. Sim-
ilarly, the images of such spirit beings as the angels in the various mirrors 
of the World of Similitudes are the same as them; they display their charac-
teristics. But they are represented in accordance with the capacities of the 
mirrors. The same instant Gabriel ( Upon whom be peace ) appeared before 
the  Companions  in  the  form  of  Dihya,  he  appeared  in  different  forms  in 
thousands of places and was prostrating with his magniﬁcent wings, which 
stretch from east to west, before the divine throne. His similitude was eve-
rywhere in accordance with the place’s capacity; at the same instant he was 
present in thousands of places.

418

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

According to this way, for the human and particular image of the Angel 
of Death represented in a human being’s mirror when he is taking possession 
of his spirit to receive the blow of a resolute, angry, awe-inspiring person 
like Moses ( Upon whom be peace ), and for that image-form, which resem-
bled the Angel of Death’s clothes, to have his eye put out, would be neither 
impossible, nor extraordinary, nor irrational.

The Second Way: The archangels Gabriel, Michael, and Azra’il are like 
general supervisors. They have helpers that are similar to them in kind and 
resemble them, but are lesser than them. The assistants differ according to 
the sorts of creatures; those who take possession of the spirits of the right-
eous 1 are of one sort, while those who take possession of the spirits of the 
wicked are of another, 2 as the following verses point out:

( 79:1-2 ) v u  *  s r
In view of this way, it is perfectly reasonable that, because he was natu-
rally  awe-inspiring  and  brave,  and  was  an  acceptable  suppliant  of  Allah, 
Moses  ( Upon  whom  be  peace )  should  have  dealt  a  blow  not  at  Azra’il 
( Upon whom be peace ), but at the wraith-like body of one of his helpers. 3
The Third Way: As is explained in the Fourth Principle in the Twenty-
Ninth Word and is indicated by some Hadiths, there are some angels who 
have  forty  thousand  heads,  and  in  each  of  their  heads  are  forty  thousand 
tongues, ( which means that they also have eighty thousand eyes ), and with 
each of those tongues they utter forty thousand divine gloriﬁcations. Yes, 
since the duties the angels are charged with are in accordance with the sorts 
of beings of the Manifest World, they represent those species’ gloriﬁcations 
in the Spirit World. It is certain to be thus, for the globe of the earth is a 
creature; it gloriﬁes Almighty Allah. It has not forty thousand, but perhaps a 
hundred thousand sorts of beings, which are like heads. Each sort has hun-
dreds of thousands of individual members which are like tongues; and so on. 

1.  In my native land, the Angel of Death charged with taking possession of the saints’ 
spirits came while a great saint well-known as Seyda was in the throes of death. Seyda 
shouted out beseeching the divine court: “ I love students of the religious sciences, so let 
the angel charged with taking possession of their souls take possession of mine! ” Those 
who were present testiﬁed to this incident.

3.  In my native land, even, a very bold man saw the Angel of Death while he was 
in the throes of death. He said: “ You’re seizing me while I’m lying in my bed! ” And he 
got up, mounted his horse and challenged him, taking his sword in his hand. He died on 
horseback, like a man.

That means the angel appointed to the earth must have not forty thousand 
heads but hundreds of thousands; and in every head must be hundreds of 
thousands of tongues; and so on. 

Thus, according to this way, Azra’il ( Upon whom be peace ) has a face 
and an eye that looks to each person. When Moses ( Upon whom be peace ) 
struck Azra’il ( Upon whom be peace ), it was not directed at his essential 
self and his true form, and it was not an insult, or non-acceptance; he struck, 
and strikes, in the eye the being who drew attention to his death and wanted 
to prevent his work, because he wanted his duties of prophethood to con-
tinue for ever.

The Third Piece,
which is the Third Matter 

[ This  matter  consists  of  a  private  and  particular  answer  to  a  general 
question asked by most of my brothers through the tongue of disposi-
tion, and by some of them verbally. ]

Q u e s t i o n :  You say to everyone who visits you: “ Don’t await any saintly 
intervention from me and don’t think of my person as being blessed. I have 
no spiritual rank. Like a common soldier may convey orders coming from 
the  rank  of  ﬁeld  marshal,  I  convey  the  orders  of  just  such  a  rank.  And 
like a bankrupt can advertise the precious diamonds of a jeweller’s shop, 
I  announce  the  wares  of  a  sacred,  Qur’anic  shop. ”  However,  our  hearts 
desire an effulgence in the same way that our minds need knowledge, and 
our spirits seek a light, and so on; we want many things in many respects. 
We came to visit you supposing you to be the person who will meet our 
needs. What we need is a saint, someone with saintly inﬂuence, someone 
of spiritual attainment, rather than a scholar. If the matter is really as you 
say, then perhaps we were wrong in visiting you? They ask this through 
the tongue of disposition.

A n s w e r :  Listen to the following ﬁve points, then think about them and 

judge whether your visits are pointless or beneﬁcial.

First Point

First Point

The common servant and wretched soldier of a king gives some generals 
and pashas royal gifts and decorations in the king’s name, and makes them 
grateful. If the generals and pashas ask: “ Why are we demeaning ourselves 
before  this  common  soldier  and  accepting  these  gifts  and  bounties  from 
him? ”, it will be arrogant foolishness. The soldier too, if, outside his duty, 
he does not stand up before the ﬁeld marshal and recognize him as superior 
to himself, it will be stupid folly. If one of the grateful generals thankfully 
condescends to visit the soldier’s humble dwelling, the king, who sees and 
knows of the situation, will send dishes from the royal kitchen for his loyal 
servant’s eminent guest, so the soldier will not be ashamed at having nothing 
to offer but dry bread.

420

TWENTY-EIGHTH LETTER – THIRD MATTER

421

Similarly,  however  lowly  he  may  be,  a  loyal  servant  of  the  All-Wise 
Qur’an  conveys  its  commands  unhesitatingly  and  in  its  name  to  even  the 
loftiest of people. With pride and independence, not abasing himself or beg-
ging, he sells the Qur’an’s precious diamonds to those who are rich in spirit. 
However lofty they are, they should not behave arrogantly towards the com-
mon servant while he is carrying out his duty. And if they apply to the serv-
ant, it should not make him proud either, or get above himself. If some of the 
customers for the sacred treasure regard the wretched servant as a saint and 
look on him as exalted, certainly it is the mark of the Qur’anic truth’s sacred 
compassion to send them assistance, succour, and enlightenment from the 
divine treasury, without the servant being aware of it or intervening, so that 
he should not be ashamed.

Second Point

Second Point

Imam-i  Rabbani,  the  Regenerator  of  the  Second  Millennium,  Ahmad 
Faruqi ( May Allah be pleased with him ), said: “ In my opinion, the unfold-
ing and clariﬁcation of a single of the truths of belief is preferable to thou-
sands of illuminations and instances of wonderworking. Moreover, the aim 
and result of all the Suﬁ paths are the unfolding and clariﬁcation of the truths 
of  faith. ”  Since  a  champion  of  Suﬁsm  like  Imam-i  Rabbani  made  such  a 
pronouncement,  surely  the  Wo r d s ,  which  expound  the  truths  of  faith  with 
perfect clarity and proceed from the mysteries of the Qur’an, may yield the 
results sought from sainthood.

Thirty years ago dreadful blows descended on the heedless head of the 
Old Said and he pondered over the assertion ٌ
ّقَ(cid:110)  ُتْو َ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)َا He saw himself in a 
muddy swamp. He sought help, searched for a way, tried to ﬁnd a saviour. 
He saw that the ways were many; he was hesitant. He took an omen from 
the book F u t u h   a l - G h a y b  of Gawth al-A‘zam, Shaikh Gilani ( May Allah be 
pleased with him ). It opened at these lines: 

 

َكَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:171)َ(cid:162) ىِواَدُ(cid:192) اً(cid:93)(cid:193)ِ(cid:93)َ(cid:142)  ْبُ(cid:171)ْ(cid:142)اَ(cid:158) ِة َ(cid:175)ﯰﯧ ِ(cid:111)ْ(cid:170)ا ِراَد ىِ(cid:158)  َتْ(cid:178)َا
It is strange, but at that time I was a member of the Darü’l-Hikmeti’l-
İslamiye. I was as though a doctor trying to heal the wounds of the people of 
Islam, but was sicker than they. A sick person should look ﬁrstly to himself, 
then to others.

422

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

The Shaikh was saying to me: “ You yourself are sick; ﬁnd a doctor for 
yourself. ”  So  I  said:  “ You  be  my  doctor! ”  I  took  him  as  my  doctor  and 
read the book as though it were addressing me. But it was most severe. It 
smashed my pride in truly fearsome manner. It carried out drastic surgery on 
my soul. I could not stand it. I read half of it as though it were addressing me, 
but did not have the strength and endurance to ﬁnish it. I put the book back 
on the shelf. Then a week later the pain of that curative operation subsided 
and I felt pleasure instead. I again opened the book and read it right through; 
I beneﬁted a lot from it, that book of my ﬁrst master. I listened to his prayers 
and supplications, and proﬁted abundantly.

Then  I  saw  M a k t u b a t   ( L e t t e r s  )  of  Imam-i  Rabbani  and  took  it  up.  I 
opened it purely to take an omen. It is strange, but in the whole of M a k t u b a t  
the word Bediuzzaman appears only twice and those two letters fell open 
for me at once. I saw that written at the head of them was: “ Letter to Mirza 
Bediuzzaman, ” and my father’s name was Mirza. “ Glory be to Allah! ” I 
exclaimed, “ these letters are addressing me. ” At that time the Old Said was 
also known as Bediuzzaman. Apart from Bediuzzaman Hamadani, I knew of 
no one in the last three hundred years famous with the name. Whereas in the 
Imam’s time there was such a person and he wrote him these two letters. His 
condition must have been similar to mine, for I found that these letters were 
the cure for my ills. Only, the Imam persistently recommended in many of 
his letters what he wrote in these two, which was: “ Make your q i b l a  one. ” 
That is, take one person as your master and follow him; do not concern your-
self with anyone else.

This most important recommendation did not seem ﬁtting for my dispo-
sition and mental state. However much I pondered over which of them to 
follow, I remained perplexed and confused. They all had different qualities 
that drew me; one was not enough. While thus bewildered, it was imparted 
to my heart by Allah’s mercy: “ The All-Wise Qur’an is the head of these 
various ways and the source of these streams and the sun of these planets; 
the true single  q i b l a  is to be found in it. In which case, it is also the most 
elevated guide and holy master. ” So I clasped it with both hands and clung 
on to it. Of course with my deﬁcient, wretched abilities I could not absorb 
the effulgence – like the water of life – of that true guide as was its due, but 
still, through it, we can show that effulgence, that water of life, according 
to the degree of those who receive it, those who perceive the truth through 
their hearts and attain to certain spiritual states. That is to say, the Wo r d s  and 
those lights, which proceed from the Qur’an, are not only scholarly matters 

TWENTY-EIGHTH LETTER – THIRD MATTER

423

that address the intellect, they are matters of faith that look to the heart, the 
spirit,  and  spiritual  states.  They  resemble  most  elevated,  valuable  knowl-
edge of Allah.

Fourth Point

Fourth Point

All the subtle inner faculties of those of the Companions and of the fol-
lowing two generations who possessed the very highest degree of the greater 
sainthood received their share from the Qur’an itself, and for them, 
the Qur’an was a true guide and sufﬁcient for them. This shows that just as 
the All-Wise Qur’an states realities, so it emanates the effulgences of the 
greater sainthood to those capable of receiving them.

Yes, there are two ways of passing from the apparent to reality:
One is to enter the intermediate realm of Suﬁsm, and to reach reality by 

traversing the degrees through spiritual journeying.

The  Second  Way  is,  through  divine  favour,  to  pass  directly  to  reality 
without entering the intermediate realm of the Suﬁ way. This is the elevated, 
direct way particular to the Companions and those who succeeded them. 

That is to say, the lights which issue from the truths of the Qur’an, and 
the  Wo r d s , which interpret those lights, may possess those characteristics, 
and do possess them.

Fifth Point

Fifth Point

We shall demonstrate through ﬁve small examples that the  Wo r d s  both 

instruct in the realities, and perform the duty of guide.

First Example

F i r s t   E x a m p l e :  I myself have formed the conviction through experienc-
ing, not ten or a hundred times but thousands of times, that just as the lights 
proceeding  from  the  Wo r d s   and  the  Qur’an  give  instruction  to  my  mind, 
so do they induce a state of belief in my heart and produce the pleasure of 
belief in my spirit, and so on. The same goes for worldly matters: just as 
the follower of a wonderworking shaikh awaits saintly assistance from him 
to answer his needs; so I have awaited from the wondrous mysteries of the 
All-Wise Qur’an that they answer my needs, and this has been achieved for 
me on numerous occasions in ways I had not hoped or anticipated. The fol-
lowing are only two minor examples:

The First: As is described in detail in the Sixteenth Letter, a large loaf of 
bread appeared in an extraordinary way to a guest of mine called Süleyman, 
at the top of a cedar tree. For two days the two of us fed off that gift from 
the Unseen.

424

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

The Second Example: I shall recount a very insigniﬁcant yet gratifying 

incident that occurred recently. It was this:

Before  dawn  the  thought  came  to  me  that  some  things  had  been  said 
about me in a way that would cast suspicion into a certain person’s heart. I 
said to myself: “ If only I had seen him and had dispelled the disquiet from 
his heart. ” At that moment, I needed part of one of my books which had 
been sent to Nis, and I said to myself: “ If only I had got it back. ” Then after 
the morning prayer I sat down and lo and behold!, that same person entered 
the room with that very part of the book in his hand. I said to him: “ What is 
it you are holding? ” He answered: “ I don’t know. Someone gave it to me 
outside my house saying that it had come from Nis; so I brought it to you. ” 
“ Glory be to Allah! ” I exclaimed, “ it does not look like chance this man 
coming from his house at this time of day and this part of the Wo r d s  arriving 
from Nis. ” And thinking: “ It was surely the All-Wise Qur’an’s saintly inﬂu-
ence that gave a man such as this a piece of paper such as that at the same 
moment and sent it to me, ” I exclaimed: “ All praise be to Allah! One who 
knows  the  smallest,  most  secret,  least  signiﬁcant  desire  of  my  heart,  will 
certainly have compassion on me and protect me; in which case, I owe the 
world nothing whatsoever! ”

Second Example

S e c o n d   E x a m p l e :  My nephew, the late Abdurrahman, had a much higher 
opinion of me personally than was my due, despite his having parted from 
me eight years previously and having been tainted by the heedlessness and 
worries of the world. He wanted such help and assistance from me as I did 
not  have  and  could  not  give.  But  the  All-Wise  Qur’an’s  saintly  inﬂuence 
came to his assistance: the Tenth Word about the resurrection of the dead 
came into his possession three months before his death. It cleansed him of 
his spiritual dirt and doubts and heedlessness. Quite simply as though he had 
risen to the degree of sainthood, he displayed three clear instances of won-
derworking in the letter he wrote me before he died. It is included among the 
pieces of the Twenty-Seventh Letter and may be referred to.

Third Example

T h i r d   E x a m p l e :   I  had  a  brother  of  the  hereafter  and  student  who  was 
one  of  those  who  approach  reality  with  their  hearts,  called  Hasan  Efendi 
from  Burdur.  He  had  an  excessively  good  opinion  of  me,  far  better  than 
I  deserved,  and  expected  assistance  from  my  wretched  person  as  though 
awaiting the grace and inﬂuence of a great saint. Suddenly, in completely 
unrelated fashion, I gave the Thirty-Second Word to someone to study who 

TWENTY-EIGHTH LETTER – THIRD MATTER

425

lived in one of the villages of Burdur. Later I remembered Hasan Efendi and 
I said: “ If you go to Burdur, give it to Hasan Efendi, and let him peruse it 
for ﬁve or six days. ” The man went and gave it to him straight away. It was 
only a month of so till Hasan Efendi died. He cast himself on the Thirty-
Second Word just like a man suffering a terrible thirst casts himself on the 
sweet water of Kawthar if he happens upon it. He studied it continuously 
and received its effulgence, especially the discussion on the love of Allah in 
the Third Stopping-Place, till he was completely cured of his ills. He found 
in it the enlightenment he would have expected from the greatest spiritual 
pole. He went to the mosque in good health, performed the prayer, and there 
surrendered his spirit to the Most Merciful ( May Allah have mercy on him ). 
F o u r t h   E x a m p l e :   As  is  testiﬁed  to  by  Hulûsi  Bey’s  piece  in  the 
Twenty-Seventh Letter, he found in the light-ﬁlled Wo r d s , which interpret 
the mysteries of the Qur’an, assistance and succour, effulgence and light 
greater than in the Naqshi way, which is the most important and inﬂuential 
Suﬁ order.

Fourth Example

Fifth Example

F i f t h   E x a m p l e :  My brother Abdülmecid suffered terribly at the death of 
Abdurrahman ( May Allah have mercy on him ) and at other grievous events. 
He also awaited from me assistance and inﬂuence I was unable to give. I 
was  not  corresponding  with  him.  Suddenly  I  sent  him  some  of  the  main 
parts of the Wo r d s . After studying them, he wrote to me and said: “ Praise be 
to Allah, I have been saved! I would have gone mad. Each of those Wo r d s  
has become like a spiritual guide for me. I had parted from one guide, but I 
suddenly found lots of them all at once and was saved! ” I realized that truly 
Abdülmecid  had  embarked  on  a  good  way  and  had  been  saved  from  his 
previous difﬁculties.

There are numerous examples like these ﬁve which show that if the sci-
ences of belief are experienced directly as cures from the mysteries of the 
All-Wise Qur’an in consequence of need and as healing for wounds, those 
sciences and spiritual cures are sufﬁcient for those who perceive their need 
and make use of them with earnest sincerity. Whatever the chemist and her-
ald is like who sells and announces them – be he commonplace, or bankrupt, 
or rich, or a person of rank, or a servant – it does not make much difference. 
There is no need to have recourse to candlelight while the sun shines. Since 
I am showing the sun, it is meaningless and unnecessary to seek candlelight 
from me, especially since I have none. Others should rather assist me with 
prayers, spiritual assistance, and even saintly inﬂuence. It is my right to seek 

426

help and assistance from them, while it is incumbent on them to be content 
with the effulgence they receive from the lights of the R i s a l e - i   N u r .

[ A short, private letter that may be added as a supplement to the Third 
Matter of the Twenty-Eighth Letter. ]

My Brothers of the Hereafter and Hard-Working Students, Husrev Efendi 

and Re’fet Bey!

We perceived three instances of Qur’anic wonderworking in the lights of 
the Qur’an known as the Wo r d s . Now through your effort and enthusiasm, 
you have caused a fourth to be added. The three I know are these:

The First is the extraordinary ease and speed in their writing. The Nine-
teenth Letter was written in two or three days working for three or four hours 
each  day  making  a  total  of  twelve  hours,  without  any  other  book,  in  the 
mountains and orchards. The Thirtieth Word was written in ﬁve or six hours 
at a time of illness. The Twenty-Eighth Word, the discussion on Paradise, 
was written in one or two hours in Süleyman’s garden in the valley. Tevﬁk, 
Süleyman and I were astonished at this speed. And so on. And just as there 
is this wonder of the Qur’an in their composition …

The Second, … so too in their being written out and copied there is an 
extraordinary facility, enthusiasm, and lack of boredom. One of these Wo r d s  
appears, and suddenly, although there are many things at this time to weary 
the  mind  and  spirit,  people  in  many  places  start  to  write  it  out  with  total 
enthusiasm. They prefer it to anything else despite other pressing occupa-
tions. And so on.

The Third Qur’anic Wonder: The reading of the Wo r d s  does not cause 
boredom either. Especially when one feels the need for them; the more one 
reads them, the more pleasure one receives, feeling no weariness.

Now you have proved a fourth Qur’anic wonder. A brother like Husrev 
who  was  lazy  and  although  for  ﬁve  years  he  had  heard  about  the  Wo r d s , 
did not start writing them seriously, in one month wrote out fourteen books 

TWENTY-EIGHTH LETTER – THIRD MATTER

427

beautifully  and  carefully,  which  was  doubtless  the  fourth  wonder  of  the 
Qur’an’s mysteries. He perfectly appreciated the value of the Thirty-Three 
Windows in particular, the Thirty-Third Letter, since it was written out most 
beautifully and carefully. Yes, it is a most powerful, brilliant piece for gain-
ing knowledge of Allah and belief in Allah. Only, the ﬁrst Windows are very 
concise  and  abbreviated,  while  the  subsequent  ones  gradually  unfold  and 
shine more brilliantly. Contrarily to other writings, most of the Wo r d s  start 
off concisely and gradually expand and illuminate.

[ The answer written for my brothers to a question about a minor, though 
alerting, incident. ]

Y o u   a s k :  On the arrival of a blessed guest, your mosque was raided on 

the night before Friday. What really happened? Why did they bother you?

T h e   A n s w e r :  I shall explain four points, necessarily in the tongue of the 
Old Said. Perhaps it will be a way of alerting my brothers, and you too will 
receive your answer.

First Point

First Point

In  reality  the  incident  was  a  satanic  plot  and  an  act  of  aggression  car-
ried out by dissemblers on account of atheism in a way that was a violation 
of the law and purely arbitrary, in order to alarm us on the eve of Friday, 
destroy the congregation’s enthusiasm, and prevent me from meeting with 
people. It was strange, but that day, that is, Thursday, I had gone somewhere 
to take some air. When returning, a long black snake that looked like two 
snakes joined together appeared from my left, and passed between me and 
the friend who was with me. Meaning to ask my friend if he had been terri-
ﬁed at the snake, I asked him: “ Did you see it? ”

He replied: “ What? ”
I said: “ That terrible snake. ”
He said: “ No, I didn’t see it and I can’t see it. ”
“ Glory be to Allah! ”, I exclaimed, “ Such a huge snake passes between 

us and you didn’t see it! How is that? ”

At the time nothing occurred to me. Then later this was imparted to my 
heart: “ It was a sign for you. Watch out! ” I thought it was like one of the 
snakes I used to see at night. That is, whenever an ofﬁcial visited me with a 
malicious intention, I would see him in the form of a snake. In fact, one time 

428

TWENTY-EIGHTH LETTER – FOURTH MATTER

429

I said to the District Ofﬁcer: “ Whenever you come intending evil, I see you 
as a snake. Be careful! ” I saw his predecessor many times like that. It means 
that the snake I saw clearly was a sign that their treachery would not only 
remain intentional but would take the form of actual aggression. For sure, 
this time their aggression was apparently minor and they wanted to mini-
mize it, but encouraged and joined by an unscrupulous teacher, the District 
Ofﬁcer ordered the gendarmes: “ Bring the visitors here! ” We were reciting 
the  t e s b i h a t   following  the  prayers  in  the  mosque.  Anyway  their  intention 
was to make me angry so that I would react in the vein of the Old Said and 
drive them out in the face of such unlawful, purely arbitrary treatment. But 
the wretch did not know that Said would not defend himself with the broken 
piece of wood in his hand while on his tongue he had a diamond sword from 
the workbench of the Qur’an, indeed, he would have used the sword like 
that. But the gendarmes were sensible, and since no state, no government 
at all, disturbs people in the mosque during prayer while performing their 
religious duties, they waited till the prayers and t e s b i h a t  were ﬁnished. The 
Ofﬁcer  was  angry  at  this  and  sent  the  rural  watchman  after  them  saying: 
“ The gendarmes don’t pay any attention to me. ” But Almighty Allah did not 
force me to struggle with them.

So I make this recommendation to my brothers: so long as there is no 
absolute necessity, don’t bother yourselves with them. In keeping with the 
saying: “ The best answer for the stupid is silence, ” do not stoop to speak 
with them. But watch out, for like showing weakness before a savage animal 
emboldens its attack, to show weakness by being sycophantic towards those 
with the consciences of beasts, encourages them to be aggressive. Friends 
must be alert so that the supporters of atheism do not take advantage of other 
friends’ indifference and heedlessness.

The verse:

( 11:113 ) m l k j i h g
threatens  in  awesome  and  severe  fashion  not  only  those  who  support  and 
are  the  tools  of  tyranny,  but  also  those  who  have  the  slightest  inclination 
towards it. For like consenting to unbelief is unbelief, so is consenting to 
tyranny and wrongdoing, tyranny and wrong.

One of the people of attainment perfectly interpreted as follows one of 

the many jewels of the above verse:

Yes,  some  of  them  are  snakes,  some  are  dogs.  The  one  who  spied  on  us 
on that blessed night when, with a blessed guest we were reciting blessed 
prayers, and informed on us as though we were commiting some crime, and 
raided us, certainly deserves the blow dealt by the above poem.

Q u e s t i o n :  Since you rely on the Qur’an’s saintly inﬂuence and its efful-
gence and light to reform and guide the most obstinate of the godless, and 
you actually do this, why do you not call to religion those aggressive people 
that are around you, and guide them?

T h e   A n s w e r :  An important principle of the Shari‘a is

not be condoned. ” Relying on the strength of the Qur’an, I say that on condi-
tion even the most obdurate irreligious person is not utterly vile and does not 
enjoy spreading the poison of misguidance like a snake, if I do not convince 
him in a few hours, I am ready to try. However, to speak of truth and real-
ity to a conscience that has fallen to the very lowest degree of baseness, to 
snakes in human form that have reached such a degree of hypocrisy that they 
knowingly sell religion for the world and knowingly exchange the diamonds 
of  reality  for  vile  and  harmful  fragments  of  glass,  would  be  disrespectful 
towards those truths. It would be like the proverb

Fourth Point

Fourth Point

The treatment I have received this seven years has been purely arbitrary 
and outside the law. For the laws concerning exiles and captives and those in 
prison are clear. By law, they can meet with their relatives and they should 
not  be  prevented  from  mixing  with  people.  In  every  country,  with  every 
people, worship and prayer are immune from interference. Others like me 
stayed  together  with  their  friends  and  relations  in  towns.  They  were  pre-
vented neither from mixing with others, nor from communicating, nor from 
moving  about  freely.  I  was  prevented.  And  my  mosque  and  my  worship 
even were raided. And while it is S u n n a  according to the Shaﬁ‘i School to 
َ(cid:202) in the prayers following the prescribed prayers, 

repeat the words, ُ

they tried to make me give them up. Even, one of the old exiles in Burdur, 
an illiterate called ﬁebab, and his mother-in-law, came here for a change of 
air. They visited me because we come from the same place. They were sum-
moned from the mosque by three armed gendarmes. The ofﬁcial then tried to 
hide that he had made a mistake and acted unlawfully, and apologized, say-
ing: “ Don’t be angry, it was my duty. ” Then he gave them permission and 
told them to go. Comparing other things and treatment with that incident, it 
is understood that the treatment accorded to me is purely arbitrary, and that 
they inﬂict vipers and curs on me. But I don’t condescend to bother with 
them. I refer it to Almighty Allah to ward off their evil. In fact, those who 
instigated the event that was the cause of the exile are now back in their own 
lands, and powerful chiefs are back at the heads of their tribes. Everyone has 
been discharged. They made me and two other people exceptions, although 
I have no connection with their world; may it be the end of them! But one of 
those two was appointed Mufti somewhere and can travel everywhere out-
side his own region, including to Ankara. And the other was left in Istanbul 
in the midst of forty thousand people from his native region, and he can meet 
with everyone. Moreover, those two persons are not alone and with no one, 
like me; they are very inﬂuential, with Allah’s permission. And so on and 
so forth. But they put me in a village and set those with the least conscience 
on me. I have only been able to go to another village twenty minutes away 
twice in six years, and they did not give me permission to go there for a few 
days’ change of air, crushing me even more under their tyranny. Whereas 
whatever form a government takes the law is the same for all. There cannot 
be different laws for villages and for different individuals. That is to say, 
the law as far as I am concerned is unlawfulness. The ofﬁcials here utilize 
government inﬂuence for their own personal grudges. But I offer a hundred 
thousand thanks to Almighty Allah, and by way of making known His boun-
ties, I say this:

All this oppression and tyranny of theirs is like pieces of wood for the ﬁre 
of ardour and endeavour which illuminates the lights of the Qur’an; it makes 
them ﬂare up and shine. And those lights of the Qur’an, which have suffered 
this persecution of theirs and have spread with the heat of endeavour, have 
made this province, indeed, most of the country, into a medrese in place of 
Barla. They supposed me to a prisoner in a village. On the contrary, in spite 
of the atheists, Barla has become the teaching desk, and many places, like 
Isparta, have become the m e d r e s e .

By  repeating  verses  like  these,  the  Qur’an  of  Miraculous  Exposition 
shows that thanks is what the Most Merciful Creator wants most from His 
servants. The Qur’an, the All-Wise Distinguisher between Truth and False-
hood,  calls  on  men  to  offer  thanks,  giving  it  the  greatest  importance.  It 
shows ingratitude to be a denial of bounties and in Sura al-Rahman utters a 
fearsomely severe threat thirty-three times with the verse,

It shows ingratitude to be denial and negation.

( 55:13, etc. ) } | { z

Indeed, just as the All-Wise Qur’an shows thanks to be the result of crea-
tion; so the universe, which is a mighty Qur’an, shows the most important 
result of the world’s creation to be thanks. For if the universe is observed 
carefully,  it  is  seen  from  the  way  it  is  arranged  that  everything  results  in 
thanks; each looks to thanks to an extent and is turned towards it. It is as 
though thanks is the most important fruit of the tree of creation, and grati-
tude is the most elevated product of the factory of the universe. The reason 
for this is as follows:

We see in the creation of the world that its beings are arranged as though 
in a circle with life as its central point. All beings look to life, and serve life, 
and produce the necessities of life. That is to say, the One who created the 
universe chose life from it, giving it preference. 

432

TWENTY-EIGHTH LETTER – FIFTH MATTER

433

Then we see that He created the animal kingdom in the form of a circle 
and  placed  man  at  its  centre.  Simply,  He  centred  the  aims  intended  from 
animate beings on man, gathering all living creatures around him and subju-
gating them to him. He made them serve him and him dominant over them. 
That is to say, the Glorious Creator chose man from among living beings, 
and willed and decreed this position for him in the world.

Then we see that the world of man, and the animal world too, are dis-
posed like circles with sustenance placed at their centre. He has made man-
kind and the animals enamoured of sustenance, has subjugated them to it, 
and made them serve it. What rules them is sustenance. And He has made 
sustenance such a vast, rich treasury that it embraces all His innumerable 
bounties. Even, with the faculty called the sense of taste, He has placed on 
the tongue sensitive scales to the number of foods so that they can recognize 
the  tastes  of  the  many  varieties  of  sustenance.  That  is  to  say,  the  strang-
est, richest, most wonderful, most agreeable, most comprehensive, and most 
marvellous truth in the universe lies in sustenance.

Now we see that just as everything has been gathered around sustenance 
and looks to it, so does sustenance in all its varieties subsist through thanks, 
both material and immaterial and that offered by word and by state; it exists 
through thanks, it produces thanks, its shows thanks. For appetite and desire 
for  sustenance  are  a  sort  of  innate  or  instinctive  thanks.  Enjoyment  and 
pleasure also are a sort of unconscious thanks, offered by all animals. It is 
only man who changes the nature of that innate thanks through misguidance 
and unbelief; he deviates from thanks and associates partners with Allah.

Furthermore, the exquisitely adorned forms, the fragrant smells, the won-
derfully  delicious  tastes  in  the  bounties  that  are  sustenance  invite  thanks; 
they awake an eagerness in animate beings, and through eagerness urge a 
sort of appreciation and respect, and prompt thanks of a sort. They attract 
the attention of conscious beings and engender admiration. They encourage 
them  to  respect  the  bounties;  through  this,  they  lead  them  to  offer  thanks 
verbally and by act, and to be grateful; they cause them to experience the 
highest, sweetest pleasure and enjoyment within thanks. That is, they show 
that, as well as a brief and temporary superﬁcial pleasure, through thanks, 
these  delicious  foods  and  bounties  gain  the  favours  of  the  Most  Merciful 
One, which provide a permanent, true, boundless pleasure. They cause con-
scious beings to ponder over the inﬁnite, pleasurable favours of the All-Gen-
erous Owner of the treasuries of mercy, and in effect to taste the everlasting 
delights of Paradise while still in this world. Thus, although by means of 

434

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

thanks  sustenance  becomes  such  a  valuable,  rich,  all-embracing  treasury, 
through ingratitude it becomes utterly valueless.

As is explained in the Sixth Word, when the sense of taste in the tongue 
is turned towards sustenance for the sake of Almighty Allah, that is, when it 
performs its duty of thanks, it becomes like a grateful inspector of the num-
berless kitchens of divine mercy and a highly-esteemed supervisor full of 
praise. If it is turned towards it for the sake of the soul, that is, without think-
ing of giving thanks to the One who has bestowed the sustenance, the sense 
of taste is demoted from being a highly-esteemed supervisor to the rank of 
a watchman of the factory of the stomach and a doorkeeper of the stable of 
the belly. Just as through ingratitude these servants of sustenance descend to 
such a level, so does the nature of sustenance and its other servants fall; they 
fall from the highest rank to the lowest; they sink to a state opposed to the 
Creator of the universe’s wisdom.

The measure of thanks is contentment, frugality, and being satisﬁed and 
grateful. While the measure of ingratitude is greed, wastefulness and extrav-
agance;  it  is  disrespect;  it  is  eating  whatever  one  comes  across,  whether 
lawful or unlawful.

Like ingratitude, greed causes both loss and degradation. For example, 
it is as though because of greed that the blessed ant even with its social life 
is crushed underfoot. For although a few grains of wheat would sufﬁce it 
for a year, it is not contented with this and collects thousands if it can. But 
the blessed honey-bee ﬂies overhead due to its contentment, and at a divine 
command bestows honey on human beings for them to eat.

The name All-Merciful – the greatest name after the name Allah, which 
signiﬁes the divine essence and is the greatest name of the Most Pure and 
Holy One – looks to sustenance, and is attained to through the thanks pro-
voked  by  sustenance.  Also,  the  most  obvious  meaning  of  All-Merciful  is 
Provider.

Moreover, there are different varieties of thanks, the most comprehensive 
of which are the prescribed prayers. The prescribed prayers are a universal 
index of the sorts of thanks.

Furthermore,  thanks  comprises  pure  belief  and  a  sincere  afﬁrma-
tion  of  Allah’s  unity.  For  a  person  who  eats  an  apple  and  utters,  “ Praise 
be  to  Allah! ”  is  proclaiming  through  his  thanks:  “ This  apple  is  a  souve-
nir bestowed directly by the hand of power, a gift directly from the treas-
ury of mercy. ” By saying this and believing it, he is ascribing everything, 

TWENTY-EIGHTH LETTER – FIFTH MATTER

435

particular and universal, to the hand of power. He recognizes the manifesta-
tion of mercy in everything. He announces through thanks, his true belief 
and sincere afﬁrmation of divine unity.

The  heedless  man  incurs  serious  loss  through  ingratitude  for  bounties. 

We shall describe only one of its many aspects. It is as follows:

If  someone  eats  a  delicious  bounty  and  gives  thanks,  by  virtue  of  his 
thanks the bounty becomes a light and a fruit of Paradise in the hereafter. 
If, because of the pleasure, he thinks of it as the work of Almighty Allah’s 
favour and mercy, it yields a true, lasting delight and enjoyment. He sends 
kernels and essences of its meanings and immaterial substances like these 
to the abodes above, while the material husk-like residue, that is, the matter 
that has completed its duty and now is unnecessary, becomes excreta and 
goes to be transformed into its original substances, that is, into the elements. 
If he fails to give thanks, the temporary pleasure leaves a pain and sorrow 
at  its  passing,  and  itself  becomes  waste.  Bounty,  which  is  as  precious  as 
diamonds, is transformed into coal. Through thanks, ephemeral sustenance 
produces  enduring  pleasures,  everlasting  fruits.  While  bounty  that  is  met 
with ingratitude is turned from the very best of forms into the most distaste-
ful. For according to the heedless person, after producing a ﬂeeting pleasure, 
sustenance ends up as waste-matter.

Sustenance is indeed in a form worthy of love, and this form is to be seen 
through  thanks.  However,  the  passion  of  the  misguided  and  heedless  for 
sustenance is animality. You can make further comparisons in this way and 
see what a loss the heedless and misguided suffer.

Among animate species, man is the most needy for all the varieties of 
sustenance. Almighty Allah created man as a comprehensive mirror to all 
His names; as a miracle of power with the capacity to weigh up and recog-
nize the contents of all His treasuries of mercy; and as vicegerent of the earth 
possessing  the  faculties  to  draw  to  the  scales  and  evaluate  all  the  subtle-
ties of His names’ manifestations. He therefore made man utterly resource-
less, rendering him needy for the endless varieties of sustenance, material 
and immaterial. Thanks is the means of raising man to “ the best of forms, ” 
which is the highest position in accordance with this comprehensiveness. If 
he does not give thanks, he falls to “ the lowest of the low, ” and perpetrates 
a great wrong.

I n   S h o r t :  Thanks is the most essential of the four fundamental princi-
ples of the way of worship and winning Allah’s love, the highest and most 
elevated way. These four principles have been deﬁned as follows:

( 10:58 ) j i h g f e d c b a

[ This matter consists of seven  S i g n s , but ﬁrstly, in order to recount a 
number of divine bounties, we shall explain seven R e a s o n s , which dis-
close the meanings of several divine favours. ]

First Reason

F i r s t   R e a s o n :   Before  the  Great  War,  or  around  the  beginning  of  it,  I 
had a true vision. In it, I was under the famous mountain of Ağrı, known as 
Mount Ararat. The mountain suddenly exploded with a terrible blast. Pieces 
the size of mountains were scattered all over the world. I looked and saw 
that in that awful situation, my mother was beside me. I said to her: “ Don’t 
be frightened. This is happening at Almighty Allah’s command, and He is 
All-Compassionate and All-Wise. ” Suddenly, while in that situation, I saw 
that a person of importance was commanding me: “ Expound the Qur’an’s 
miraculousness! ”  I  awoke  and  I  understood  that  there  was  going  to  be  a 
great explosion and upheaval, and that following it the walls surrounding the 
Qur’an would be destroyed. The Qur’an would then defend itself directly. It 
was going to be attacked and its miraculousness would be its steel armour. 
And in a way surpassing his ability, someone like myself would be appointed 
at this time to reveal one sort of its miraculousness; I understood that I had 
been designated.

Since the Qur’an’s miraculousness has been expounded to an extent in 
the Wo r d s , to set forth the divine favours received in our service, which are 
sorts of blessings and emanations of its miraculousness, will surely assist it 
and pass to its account, and should therefore be set forth.

Second Reason

S e c o n d   R e a s o n :  The All-Wise Qur’an is our guide, master, and leader, 
and shows us the way in all our conduct. So since it praises itself, following 
its instruction, we shall praise its commentary.

437

438

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

Furthermore, since the Wo r d s  that have been written are a sort of com-
mentary  on  the  Qur’an,  and  its  treatises  are  the  property  of  the  Qur’an’s 
truths and its realities; and since in most of its Suras, and particularly in the 
!’s and 4’s, the All-Wise Qur’an displays itself in all its magniﬁcence, 
tells of its own perfections, and praises itself in a way of which it is worthy; 
certainly  we  are  charged  with  making  known  the  ﬂashes  of  the  Qur’an’s 
miraculousness  that  are  reﬂected  in  the  Wo r d s ,  and  the  dominical  favours 
that  are  a  sign  of  that  service’s  acceptance.  For  our  master  does  this  and 
teaches us to do it.

Third Reason

T h i r d   R e a s o n :   I  do  not  say  this  about  the  Wo r d s   out  of  modesty  but 
in order to explain a truth, that the truths and perfections in the Wo r d s  are 
not mine; they are the Qur’an’s and they have issued from the Qur’an. The 
Tenth Wo r d , for instance, consists of a few droplets ﬁltered from hundreds 
of verses, and the rest of the treatises are all like that. Since I know it is thus 
and since I am transient, I shall depart, of course something, a work, which is 
enduring should not, and must not, be tied to me. And since it is the custom 
of the people of misguidance and rebellion to refute a work that does not 
suit their purposes by refuting its author, the treatises, which are bound to 
the stars of the skies of the Qur’an, should not be bound to a rotten post like 
me who may be the object of criticism and disapproval, and may fall. Also, 
it is generally the custom to search for the merits of a work in the qualities 
of its author, whom people suppose to be the work’s source and origin. To 
attribute those elevated truths and brilliant jewels to a bankrupt like me in 
keeping  with  that  custom,  and  to  my  person,  who  could  not  produce  one 
thousandth of them himself, is a great injustice towards the truth. I am there-
fore compelled to proclaim that the treatises are not my property; they are 
the Qur’an’s property, and issuing from the Qur’an, they manifest its virtues. 
Yes,  the  qualities  of  delicious  bunches  of  grapes  should  not  be  sought  in 
their dry stalks. I resemble such a dry stalk.

Fourth Reason

F o u r t h   R e a s o n :  Sometimes modesty suggests ingratitude for bounties, 
indeed, is ingratitude for bounties. Then sometimes recounting bounties is 
a  cause  of  pride.  Both  are  harmful.  The  only  solution  is  for  it  to  be  nei-
ther. To admit to virtues and perfections, but without claiming ownership of 
them, is to show them to be the works bestowed by the True Bestower. For 
example, suppose someone were to dress you in a robe of honour embroi-
dered and encrusted with jewels and you became very beautiful. The people 
then said to you: “ What wonders Allah has willed! How beautiful you are! 
How beautiful you have become! ”, but you modestly replied: “ Allah forbid! 

TWENTY-EIGHTH LETTER – SEVENTH MATTER

439

Don’t say such a thing! What am I? This is nothing! ” To do this would be 
ingratitude for the bounty and disrespectful towards skilful craftsman who 
had dressed you in the garment. While if you were to reply proudly: “ Yes, I 
am very beautiful. Surely there is no one to compare with me! ”, that would 
be conceited pride.

In  consequence,  to  avoid  both  conceit  and  ingratitude  one  should  say: 
“ Yes, I have grown beautiful. But the beauty springs from the robe and thus 
indirectly from the one who clothed me in it; it is not mine. ”

Like this, if my voice were strong enough, I would shout out to the whole 
earth: “ The Wo r d s  are beautiful; they are truth, they are reality; but they are 
not mine. They are rays shining out from the truths of the Noble Qur’an. ”

In accordance with the principle of:

ّ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ُ(cid:175)ِ(cid:92) ىِ(cid:99)َ(cid:170)اَ(cid:163)َ(cid:174)  ُتْ(cid:110)َدَ(cid:174)  ْنﯮﯧٰ(cid:170)َو  *  ىِ(cid:99)َ(cid:170)اَ(cid:163) َ(cid:175)ِ(cid:92) اًد َ
ٍد َ

ّ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ُ(cid:174)  ُتْ(cid:110)َدَ(cid:174) اَ(cid:174)َو

I say:

ﯗﮐٰاْرُ(cid:163)ْ(cid:170)اِ(cid:92) ىِ(cid:98)ا َ(cid:175)ِ(cid:171)ﯬﯦ  ُتْ(cid:110)َدَ(cid:174)  ْنﯮﯧٰ(cid:170)َو  *  ىِ(cid:98)ا َ(cid:175)ِ(cid:171)ﯬﯧِ(cid:92) َنٰاْرُ(cid:163)ْ(cid:170)ا  ُتْ(cid:110)َدَ(cid:174) اَ(cid:174)َو
That is to say, I did not beautify the truths of the Qur’an’s miraculousness, I 
could not show them beautifully; rather, the Qur’an’s beautiful truths made 
my words beautiful and elevated them. Since it is thus, it is acceptable to 
recount divine bounties and to make known in the name of the beauty of 
the Qur’an’s truths, the beauties of its mirrors known as the Wo r d s , and the 
divine favours which comprise those mirrors.

Fifth Reason

F i f t h   R e a s o n :  A long time ago I heard from one of the people of saint-
hood  that  he  had  divined  from  the  obscure  allusions  of  the  saints  of  old 
–  received  from  the  Unseen  –  that  a  light  would  appear  in  the  East  that 
would scatter the darkness of innovation. He was certain of this. I have long 
awaited the coming of the light, and I am awaiting it. But ﬂowers appear 
in the spring and the ground has to be prepared for such sacred ﬂowers. I 
understood  that  with  this  service  of  ours  we  are  preparing  the  ground  for 
those luminous people. So to proclaim the divine favours which pertain not 
to us but to the lights called the Wo r d s  should lead not to pride or conceit but 
to praise and thanks, and to recounting the divine bounties.

Sixth Reason

S i x t h   R e a s o n :  Dominical favours, which are an immediate reward for 
our serving the Qur’an by means of the Wo r d s , and an encouragement, are 
a success granted by Allah. And success should be made known. If they 
surpass success, they become a divine bestowal. To make known divine 
bestowal infers thanks. If they surpass that too, they become wonders of 

440

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

the Qur’an with no interference on the part of our wills; we have merely 
manifested them. It is harmless to make known wonders of this sort, which 
occur unheralded and without the intervention of will. If they surpass ordi-
nary  wonders,  they  become  rays  of  the  Qur’an’s  miraculousness.  And 
since  miraculousness  may  be  made  known,  the  making  known  of  what 
assists the miraculousness passes to the account of the miraculousness and 
cannot be the cause of any pride or conceit; it should rather be the cause 
of praise and thanks.

Seventh Reason

S e v e n t h   R e a s o n :  Eighty per cent of people are not investigative scholars 
who can penetrate to reality, recognize reality as reality and accept it as such. 
They rather accept matters by way of imitation, that they hear from accept-
able and reliable people, in consequence of their good opinions of them. In 
fact, they look on a powerful truth as weak when in the possession of a weak 
man, while if they see a worthless matter in the possession of a worthy man, 
they deem it valuable. Because of this, in order not to reduce the value of 
the truths of faith and the Qur’an in the eyes of most people since they are 
in the hands of a weak and worthless wretch like myself, I am compelled to 
proclaim that o u t s i d e   o u r   k n o w l e d g e   a n d   w i l l ,   s o m e o n e   i s   e m p l o y i n g   u s ;   w e  
a r e   n o t   a w a r e   o f   i t ,   b u t   h e   i s   m a k i n g   u s   w o r k . My evidence is this: outside 
our wills and consciousness, we manifest certain favours and facilities. In 
which case, we are compelled to shout out and proclaim those favours.

In consequence of the above seven reasons, we shall point out several 

signs of universal dominical favours.

First Sign

FIRST SIGN

Explained in the First Point of the Eighth Matter of the Twenty-Eighth 
Letter, are the ‘coincidences’ ( t e v â f u k a t  ). For example, in the Nineteenth 
Letter, about the miracles of Muhammad ( UWBP ), in a copy written by a 
scribe who was unaware of this factor, on sixty pages – with the exception 
of  two  –  from  the  Third  to  the  Eighteenth  Signs,  more  than  two  hundred 
instances of the phrase “ Allah’s Noble Messenger, Upon whom be bless-
ings  and  peace ”  look  to  each  other  corresponding  perfectly.  Anyone  fair 
who looks at two pages would conﬁrm that they are not the product of mere 
chance. If many instances of the same word corresponded to each other on 
the same page, half would be chance and half coincidence; it would only be 
wholly coincidence if this occurred on more than one page. So if two, three, 
four, or even more instances of the phrase “ Allah’s Noble Messenger, Upon 
whom be blessings and peace ” correspond to each other perfectly on all the 

TWENTY-EIGHTH LETTER – SEVENTH MATTER

441

pages, it surely is not possible for it to be chance. It shows too that a coin-
cidence that eight different scribes have been unable to spoil is a powerful 
sign from the Unseen. Although the various degrees of eloquence are to be 
found in the books of the scholars of rhetoric and eloquence, the eloquence 
of the All-Wise Qur’an has risen to the degree of miraculousness and it is in 
no one’s power to reach it. Similarly, the ‘coincidences’ in the Nineteenth 
Letter, which is a mirror of the miracles of Muhammad ( UWBP ), and in the 
Twenty-Fifth Word, which is an interpreter of the miracles of the Qur’an, 
and in the various parts of the R i s a l e - i  N u r , which is a sort of commentary on 
the Qur’an, demonstrate a degree of singularity surpassing all other books. 
It is understood from this that it is a sort of wonder of the miraculousness of 
the Qur’an and the miracles of Muhammad ( UWBP ) which is manifested 
and represented in those mirrors.

Second Sign

SECOND SIGN

The  second  of  the  dominical  favours  pertaining  to  the  service  of  the 
Qur’an is this: Almighty Allah bestowed on someone like me who has difﬁ-
culty in writing, is semi-literate, alone, in exile, and barred from mixing with 
people, brothers as helpers who are strong, earnest, sincere, enterprising, and 
self-sacriﬁcing, and whose pens are each like diamond swords. He placed 
on their powerful shoulders the Qur’anic duty that weighed heavily on my 
weak and powerless ones. Out of His perfect muniﬁcence, He lightened my 
load. In Hulûsi’s words, that blessed community is like a collection of wire-
less  and  telegraph  receivers,  and  in  Sabri’s,  like  the  machines  producing 
the electricity of the light factory. With their different virtues and worthy 
qualities, again in Sabri’s words, manifesting a sort of coincidence proceed-
ing from the Unseen, they spread the mysteries of the Qur’an and lights of 
faith  all  around  reﬂecting  each  other’s  enthusiasm,  effort,  enterprise,  and 
seriousness, making them reach everywhere. At this time, that is, when the 
alphabet has been changed, and there are no printing-presses, and everyone 
is in need of the lights of belief, and there are numerous things to dispirit a 
person and destroy his enthusiasm, their unﬂagging service and sheer fer-
vour and endeavour are directly a wonder of the Qur’an and a clear divine 
favour. Yes, just as sainthood has its wonders, so does a pure intention. So 
does sincerity. Especially serious, sincere solidarity  between brothers and 
brotherhood purely for Allah’s sake – they produce numerous wonders. In 
fact, the collective personality of such a community may achieve the perfec-
tion of a saint and manifest divine favours.

442

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

My  brothers  and  my  friends  in  the  service  of  the  Qur’an!  Just  as  it  is 
unjust and wrong to give all the glory and all the booty to the sergeant of 
a  company  that  conquers  a  citadel,  so  you  should  not  ascribe  the  divine 
favours in the victories won through the strength of your collective person-
ality and your pens to an unfortunate like myself! In fact, there is another 
indication of the Unseen in such a blessed community, more powerful than 
the ‘coincidences’ proceeding from the Unseen and I can see it, but I may 
not point it out to everyone at large.

Third Sign

THIRD SIGN

The  fact  that  the  various  parts  of  the  R i s a l e - i   N u r   prove  the  principal 
truths of belief and the Qur’an in brilliant fashion to even the most obdurate 
person is a powerful sign from the Unseen and divine favour. For among 
those truths are some that Ibn Sina, who was considered the greatest genius, 
confessed  his  powerlessness  to  understand,  saying:  “ Reason  cannot  solve 
these. ” Whereas the Tenth Word explains what he could not achieve with 
his genius to ordinary people, or even to children.

And for example, a learned scholar like Sa‘d al-Din Taftazani could only 
solve the mystery of divine determining and man’s will in forty to ﬁfty pages 
with  the  famous  M u q a d d i m ā t - i   I t h n a   ‘ A s h a r   in  his  work  Ta l w ī ḥ ā t .  Those 
same matters, which he set out for the elite alone, are explained completely 
in two pages in the Second Topic of the Twenty-Sixth Word, which is about 
divine determining, in a way that everyone can understand; if that is not a 
mark of divine favour, what is?

There are also what are known as the mystery of world’s creation and 
the riddle of the universe, which have perplexed everyone and no philoso-
phy  has  been  able  to  solve:  through  the  miraculousness  of  the  Qur’an  of 
Mighty Stature, that abstruse talisman and astonishing riddle are solved in 
the Twenty-Fourth Letter, and in the Allusive Point towards the end of the 
Twenty-Ninth Word, and in the six instances of wisdom in the transforma-
tions  of  minute  particles  explained  in  the  Thirtieth  Word.  They  have  dis-
closed and explained the mystery of the astonishing activity in the universe, 
and the riddle of the universe’s creation and its end, and the meaning and 
instances of wisdom in the motion and transformations of particles; they are 
there for all to see and may be referred to.

Furthermore, the Sixteenth and Thirty-Second Wo r d s  explain with perfect 
clarity the partnerless unity of dominicality, through the mystery of divine 

TWENTY-EIGHTH LETTER – SEVENTH MATTER

443

oneness,  together  with  the  astonishing  truths  of  inﬁnite  divine  proximity 
and  our  inﬁnite  distance  from  Allah.  While  the  exposition  of  the  phrase 
ِلﯭﯦ ىٰ(cid:171)َ(cid:150) َوُ(cid:182)َو in the Twentieth Letter and its Addendum which 
ٌر(cid:192) ِدَ(cid:162)  ٍء ْي َ(cid:130)  ّ
contains three comparisons demonstrate self-evidently that minute particles 
and the planets are equal in relation to divine power, and that at the resurrec-
tion of the dead, the raising to life of all beings with spirits will be as easy 
for that power as the raising to life of a single soul, and that the intervention 
of any partner to Allah in the creation of the 
universe  is  so  far  from  reason  as  to  be  impossible,  thus  disclosing  a  vast 
mystery of divine unity.

Furthermore,  although  in  the  truths  of  belief  and  the  Qur’an  there  is 
such a breadth that the greatest human genius cannot comprehend them, the 
fact that they appeared together with the great majority of their ﬁne points 
through someone like me whose mind is confused, situation wretched, has 
no book to refer to, and who writes with difﬁculty and at speed, is directly 
the work of the All-Wise Qur’an’s miraculousness and a manifestation of 
dominical favour and a powerful sign from the Unseen.

Fourth Sign

FOURTH SIGN

Fifty to sixty treatises were bestowed in such a way that, being works 
that could not be written through the efforts and exertions of great geniuses 
and exacting scholars, let alone someone like me who thinks little, follows 
the apparent, and does not have the time for close study, they demonstrate 
that they are directly the works of divine favour. For in all these treatises, 
the most profound truths are taught by means of comparisons to the most 
ordinary and uneducated people. Whereas leading scholars have said about 
most of those truths that they cannot be made comprehensible and have not 
taught them to the elite, let alone to the common people.

Thus, for these most distant truths to be taught to the most ordinary man 
in the closest way, with wondrous ease and clarity of expression, by some-
one  like  me  who  has  little  Turkish,  whose  words  are  obscure  and  mostly 
incomprehensible, and for many years has been famous for complicating the 
clearest facts and whose former works conﬁrm this ill-fame, is certainly and 
without any doubt a mark of divine favour and cannot be through his skill; it 
is a manifestation of the Noble Qur’an’s miraculousness, and a representa-
tion and reﬂection of the Qur’an’s comparisons.

Fifth Sign

444

FIFTH SIGN

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

The fact that although generally speaking the treatises have been widely 
distributed, and classes and groups of people from the loftiest scholars to 
the uneducated, and from great saints from among those who approach real-
ity with their hearts to the most obdurate irreligious philosphers, have seen 
them and studied them and have not criticized them, despite some of them 
receiving  blows  through  them;  and  the  fact  that  each  group  has  beneﬁted 
from them according to its degree; is directly a mark of dominical favour 
and a wonder of the Qur’an. And although treatises of that sort are written 
only after much study and research, these were written with extraordinary 
speed and at distressing times when my mind was contracted, confusing my 
thought and understanding, which is a mark of divine favour and a domini-
cal bestowal.

Yes, most of my brothers and all the friends who are with me and the 
scribes know that the ﬁve parts of the Nineteenth Letter were written refer-
ring to no book at all in several days working for two or three hours each 
day making a total of twelve hours; and the Fourth Part, which is the most 
important and displays a clear seal of prophethood in the phrase “ Allah’s 
Noble Messenger, Upon whom be blessings and peace, ” was written from 
memory  in  three  or  four  hours  in  the  rain  in  the  mountains;  and  that  the 
important  and  profound  treatise  of  the  Thirtieth  Word  was  written  in  six 
hours in an orchard; and that as with the Twenty-Eighth Word, which was 
written ﬁnally in two hours in Süleyman’s garden, most of them were writ-
ten  in  such  conditions;  my  close  friends  know  also  that  for  many  years, 
when I suffer difﬁculties and my mind is contracted, I cannot explain even 
the plainest facts, indeed, I do not even know them. Then especially when 
illness aggravates the distress, it prevents me from teaching and writing even 
more. Yet despite this, the most important of the Wo r d s  and their treatises 
were written when I was suffering most difﬁculty and illness, and with the 
most speed. If this was not a direct divine favour and dominical bounty and 
wonder of the Qur’an, what was it?

Furthermore, whatever book it may be, if it discusses the divine truths and 
realities of faith, it will certainly be harmful for some people, and for this 
reason all the matters it contains should not be taught to everyone. However, 
although I have asked many people, up to the present time these treatises 
have caused no harm to anyone; they have caused no ill effects or unfavour-
able reaction, nor have they disturbed anyone’s mind. It is absolutely certain 
in my opinion that this is a direct sign of the Unseen and dominical favour.

Sixth Sign

TWENTY-EIGHTH LETTER – SEVENTH MATTER

SIXTH SIGN

It has now become absolutely clear in my view that most of my life has 
been directed in such a way, outside my own will, ability, comprehension, 
and  foresight,  that  it  might  produce  these  treatises  to  serve  the  All-Wise 
Qur’an. It is as if all my life as a scholar had been spent in preparation and 
preliminaries, the result of which was the exposition of the Qur’an’s miracu-
lousness through the Wo r d s . I have no doubt even that these seven years of 
exile, and the situation imposed on me whereby I have been isolated for no 
reason and against my wish, living a solitary life in a village in a way opposed 
to my temperament, and my feeling disgust at and abandoning many of the 
ties and rules of social life to which I had long grown accustomed, was in 
order  to  make  me  carry  out  this  duty  to  serve  the  Qur’an  directly  and  in 
purely sincere fashion. I am of the opinion that the ill-treatment was very 
often  visited  on  me  by  a  hand  of  favour  under  the  veil  of  unjust  oppres-
sion, compassionately, in order to focus my thought on the mysteries of the 
Qur’an and restrict it and not allow my mind to be distracted. And being pre-
vented from studying all other books, despite formerly having great desire 
to study, I felt an aloofness towards them in my spirit. I understood that I 
had been made to give up studying, which would have been a solace and 
familiar in my exile, so that the verses of the Qur’an should be my absolute 
master directly.

Furthermore, the great majority of the works that have been written, the 
treatises, have been bestowed instantaneously and suddenly in consequence 
of some need arising from my spirit, not from any outside cause. Then when 
afterwards I have shown them to friends, they have said that they are the 
remedy for the wounds of the present time. And having been disseminated, 
I have understood from most of my brothers that they meet the needs of the 
times exactly and are like a cure for every ill.

I have no doubt therefore that the above-mentioned points and the course 
of my life and my involuntarily studying ﬁelds of learning opposed to nor-
mal practice, outside my own will and awareness, were a powerful divine 
favour and dominical bounty bestowed to yield sacred results such as these.

Seventh Sign

SEVENTH SIGN

In the course of our work over the past ﬁve to six years, without exag-
geration  we  have  seen  with  our  own  eyes  a  hundred  instances  of  divine 
bestowal and dominical favour and wonders of the Qur’an. We have pointed 
out some of them in the Sixteenth Letter, and others we have described in the 

446

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

various matters of the Fourth Topic of the Twenty-Sixth Letter, and in the 
Third Matter of the Twenty-Eighth Letter. My close friends know these, and 
Süleyman Efendi, my constant friend, knows many of them. We experience 
an extraordinary and wondrous ease in spreading the Wo r d s  in particular and 
other treatises, and in correcting them, and putting them in order, and in the 
rough and ﬁnal drafts. I have no doubt that this is a wonder of the Qur’an. 
There have been hundreds of instances of it.

Furthermore,  we  are  nurtured  with  great  tenderness  in  our  daily  lives 
with the Gracious One who employs us bestowing on us the least desires of 
our hearts in ways entirely outside the ordinary in order to gratify us. And so 
on. This situation is a truly powerful sign from the Unseen that we are being 
employed; we are being made to serve the Qur’an both within the sphere of 
divine pleasure, and through divine favour.

The Answer to a Conﬁdential Question

The Answer
to a Conﬁdential Question 

[ This instance of divine favour was written some time ago conﬁdentially 
and was added to the end of the Fourteenth Word. However, most of the 
scribes have forgotten it and not written it. That is to say, the appropriate 
place for it must have been here, since it remained unknown. ]

Y o u   a s k   m e :   “ How  is  it  that  in  the  Wo r d s   you  have  written  from  the 
Qur’an  are  a  power  and  effectiveness  rarely  to  be  found  in  the  words  of 
Qur’anic commentators and those with knowledge of Allah? Sometimes a 
single line is as powerful as a page, and one page as effective as a book? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  A good answer: since the honour belongs to the Qur’an’s 
miraculousness and not to me, I say fearlessly: it is mostly like that for the 
following reason:

The Wo r d s  that have been written are not supposition, they are afﬁrma-
tion; they are not submission, they are belief; they are not intuitive knowl-
edge ( m a r i f e t  ), they are a testifying and witnessing; they are not imitating, 
they are veriﬁcation; they are not taking the part of something, they are com-
prehension of it; they are not Suﬁsm, they are reality ( h a k i k a t  ); they are not 
a claim, they are the proof within the claim. The wisdom in this is as follows:
Formerly,  the  fundamentals  of  belief  were  protected,  submission  was 
strong. Even if the intuitive knowledge of those with knowledge of Allah 
lacked  proof,  their  expositions  were  acceptable  and  sufﬁcient.  But  at  this 
time, since the misguidance of science has stretched out its hand to the fun-
damentals and pillars [ of belief ], the All-Wise and Compassionate One of 
Glory, who bestows a remedy for every ill, in consequence of my impotence 
and weakness, want and need, mercifully bestowed in these writings of mine 
which  serve  the  Qur’an  a  single  ray  from  the  comparisons  of  that  Noble 
Qur’an, which are a most brilliant manifestation of its miraculousness. All 
praise be to Allah, distant truths were brought close through the telescope 
of the mystery of comparisons. Through the aspect of unity of the mystery 
of comparisons, truly disparate matters were collected together. Through the 
stairs of the mystery of comparisons, the highest truths were easily reached. 
Through the window of the mystery of comparisons, a certainty of belief in 
the truths of the Unseen and fundamentals of Islam was obtained close to 

448

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

the degree of witnessing ( ş u h û d  ). The intellect, as well as the imagination 
and fancy, and the soul and caprice, were compelled to submit, and Satan too 
was compelled to surrender his weapons.

I n   S h o r t :  Whatever beauty and effectiveness are found in my writings, 
they  are  only  ﬂashes  of  the  Qur’anic  comparisons.  My  share  is  only  my 
intense need and my seeking, and my extreme impotence and my beseech-
ing. The ill is mine, and the cure, the Qur’an’s.

The Conclusion of the Seventh Matte

The Conclusion
of the Seventh Matter 

[ This is to banish any doubts that have arisen or may arise concerning 
the signs from the Unseen apparent in the form of the above eight divine 
favours, and describes a further divine favour and its mighty mystery. ]

This conclusion consists of four points.

First Point

We claimed in the Seventh Matter of the Twenty-Eighth Letter that we 
saw a sign from the Unseen, called the Eighth Favour, which we perceived 
in the seven or eight universal, immaterial divine favours, and a manifesta-
tion of that sign in the embroideries known as the coincidences ( t e v â f u k a t  ). 
And we claim that those seven or eight universal divine favours are so pow-
erful and certain that each on its own proves those signs from the Unseen. 
If, to suppose the impossible, some appear weak, or are denied even, it will 
not damage the certainty of that sign from the Unseen. A person who cannot 
deny the divine favours, cannot deny the signs. But because people differ 
in  respect  of  their  level,  and  because  the  most  numerous  level,  the  mass 
of people, rely mostly on what they see, since the coincidences are not the 
most powerful but the most apparent of the eight divine favours – certainly 
the others are more powerful but since this is more general – I have been 
compelled to expound a truth by way of comparing them, with the intention 
of dispelling those doubts. It is like this:

We said concerning the apparent divine favour that so many coincidences 
appeared in the word “ Qur’an ” and the phrase “ Allah’s Noble Messenger, 
Upon whom be blessings and peace ” in the treatise we had written that no 
doubt remained that they had been ordered intentionally and given mutually 
corresponding positions. Our evidence that the will and intention is not ours 
is that we became aware of them only three or four years later. In which case, 
as a work of divine favour, the will and intention pertain to the Unseen. This 
singular situation was bestowed solely to corroborate the miraculousness of 
the Qur’an and of Muhammad ( UWBP ), and in the form of the coincidences 
involving those two words. In addition to the blessedness of these two words 
being a ratifying stamp of the Qur’an’s miraculousness and the miracles of 

450

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

Muhammad ( UWBP ), the great majority of similar phrases manifest coin-
cidences, but they appear only on a single page, while the two above phrases 
appear throughout the two treatises and in most of the others. We have said 
repeatedly that essentially coincidences may be found in other books, but 
not  to  this  extraordinary  extent,  which  demonstrates  an  elevated  will  and 
intention. Now, although it is not possible to refute what we claim, there are 
one or two ways that it might appear to be thus if glanced at superﬁcially.

One  is  that  they  may  say:  “ You  had  these  coincidences  in  mind  and 
brought them about in this way. It would be easy to do that intentionally. ” 
In reply we say this: in any matter two truthful witnesses are sufﬁcient, but 
in this case a hundred truthful witnesses may be found who will testify that 
our will and intention played no part and that we became aware of it only 
three or four years later. I want to say in this connection that this wonder of 
the Qur’an proceeding from its miraculousness is not similar in kind to its 
miraculous eloquence, or equal in degree. For that is beyond human power. 
But this wonder of its miraculousness could not occur through human power 
either; human power could not intervene in such a matter. If it did, it would 
be artiﬁcial and spoil it. 1

Third Point

In connection with particular signs and general signs, we shall indicate a 

ﬁne point of dominicality and mercifulness:

One of my brothers said something very good; I shall make it the subject 
here. What he said was this: one day I showed him a clear example of a coin-
cidence and he said: “ That’s good! In fact all truths and realities are good, 
but the coincidences in the Wo r d s  and its success are even better. ” “ Yes, ” 
I said, “ everything is in reality good, or in itself good, or good in respect of 
its results. And this goodness looks to general dominicality, all-embracing 
mercy, and universal manifestation. Like you said, the sign from the Unseen 
in this success is even better. This is because it takes the form of a particular 
mercy and particular dominicality and particular manifestation. ” We shall 
make this easier to understand with a comparison. It is like this:

Through his universal sovereignty and law, a king may encompass all the 

1.  In one copy, on a page of the Eighteenth Sign of the Nineteenth Letter, the word 
“ Qur’an ” coincided nine times in this way. We drew a line through these and the word 
“ Muhammad ” appeared. Then on the opposite the page, the word “ Qur’an ” appeared 
eight times, and from all these the name of “ Allah ” emerged. Many wondrous things like 
these have been observed in the coincidences. We saw this with our own eyes. 

Signed: Bekir, Tevﬁk, Süleyman, Galib, Said.

TWENTY-EIGHTH LETTER – SEVENTH MATTER

451

members of his nation with his royal mercy. Each receives the king’s favour 
and is subject to his rule directly. The members all have numerous particular 
connections within the universality.

The second aspect are the king’s particular bounties and particular orders: 

above the law, he bestows favours on persons and gives his orders.

Like this comparison, everything receives a share of the general domini-
cality and all-encompassing mercy of the Necessarily Existent One, the All-
Wise and Compassionate Creator. He has disposal over everything through 
His power, will, and all-embracing knowledge; He intervenes in the most 
insigniﬁcant matters of all things; His dominicality embraces them. Every-
thing is in need of Him in every respect. All of their works are performed 
and  ordered  through  His  knowledge  and  wisdom.  Neither  nature  has  the 
ability  to  hide  within  the  sphere  of  disposal  of  His  dominicality,  or  have 
any effect or intervene, nor can chance interfere in the works of His wisdom 
and  its  ﬁne  balance.  We  have  refuted  chance  and  nature  in  twenty  places 
in the R i s a l e - i   N u r  with decisive proofs, executing them with the sword of 
the Qur’an; we have demonstrated their interference to be impossible. But 
the people of neglect have called “ chance, ” matters they do not know the 
wisdom of and reason for in the sphere of apparent causes within universal 
dominicality. They have been unable to see some of the laws of the divine 
acts concealed beneath the veil of nature, the wisdom and purposes of which 
they do not comprehend, and they have recourse to nature.

The second is His particular dominicality and particular favours and mer-
ciful succour, through which the names Merciful and Compassionate come 
to the aid of individuals unable to bear the constraints of the general laws; 
they  assist  them  in  particular  fashion  and  save  them  from  those  crushing 
constraints. Therefore, all living beings and especially man may seek help 
from Him at all times, and receive succour.

Thus, the favours in this particular dominicality cannot be hidden under 

chance by the people of neglect, nor be ascribed to nature.

It  is  in  consequence  of  this  that  we  have  considered  and  believed  the 
signs from the Unseen in T h e   M i r a c u l o u s n e s s   o f   t h e   Q u r ’ a n  and T h e   M i r a -
c l e s   o f   M u h a m m a d  to be particular signs, certain that they are a particular 
succour and particular divine favour showing themselves against the obdu-
rate  deniers.  So  we  have  proclaimed  them  purely  for  Allah’s  sake.  If  we 
were mistaken in doing so, may Allah forgive us. Amen.

The Eighth Matter,
which is the Eighth Part 

[ This matter consists of six questions comprising eight points. ]

First Point

FIRST POINT

We have perceived many signs from the Unseen suggesting that we are 
being employed in the service of the Qur’an by a hand of favour, and some 
of these we have pointed out. Now, a new sign is this: most of the  Wo r d s  
contain  coincidences  from  the  Unseen  ( t e v â f u k a t - ı   g a y b i y e  ).  1  In  short, 
it  indicates  that  a  sort  of  manifestation  of  miraculousness  is  embodied  in 
the words “ Allah’s Most Noble Messenger, ” the phrase, “ Upon whom be 
blessings and peace, ” and in the blessed word “ Qur’an. ” However hidden 
and slight signs from the Unseen are, they indicate the acceptability of our 
service and rightness of the matters, and so in my opinion hold great impor-
tance and power. Furthermore, they break my pride and have demonstrated 
to me categorically that I am merely an interpreter. They leave nothing to 
cause  me  pride;  they  only  show  up  things  that  prompt  thanks.  Since  they 
pertain to the Qur’an and pass to the account of its miraculousness; and since 
our wills deﬁnitely do not interfere; and since they encourage those who are 
lazy in their service, and afford the conviction that the treatises are true; and 
since they are a form of divine bestowal to us, and to make them known is to 
make known a divine bounty, and to do so reduces to silence those obdurate 
people who understand only what they see; it is surely necessary to make 
them known; Allah willing, it causes no harm.

One of the signs from the Unseen is this: out of His perfect mercy and 
muniﬁcence, in order to encourage us in our service of the Qur’an and faith 
and  put  our  hearts  at  rest,  Almighty  Allah  bestowed  a  subtle  dominical 
favour on us and a divine gift in all the treatises we have written, and par-
ticularly in T h e   M i r a c l e s   o f   M u h a m m a d ,   T h e   M i r a c u l o u s n e s s   o f   t h e   Q u r ’ a n , 
and T h i r t y - T h r e e   Wi n d o w s , in the form of a sign from the Unseen indicating 
the acceptability of our service and that what we have written is the truth. 

1.    Coincidences  indicate  mutual  correspondence,  and  mutual  correspondence  indi-
cates agreement, and agreement is a sign of unity, and unity shows uniﬁcation, that is, the 
afﬁrmation of divine unity ( t a w h i d  ), which is the greatest of the Qur’an’s four aims.

That is, He causes the same words on a page to face one another. In this is 
a sign from the Unseen that they are ordered by an unseen will which says: 
“ Don’t rely on your own wills and comprehension. Without your knowing 
or  being  aware  of  it,  wondrous  embroideries  and  arrangements  are  being 
made. ” The words “ Allah’s Most Noble Messenger ” and “ Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ” in  T h e   M i r a c l e s   o f   M u h a m m a d  in particular are like 
mirrors showing clearly the signs of those coincidences from the Unseen. In 
a copy written by a new, inexperienced scribe, on all the pages other than 
ﬁve, more than two hundred “ Upon whom be blessings and peace ”s face 
one another in lines.

These  coincidences  are  not  the  work  of  chance,  which  might  uncon-
sciously give rise to one or two out of ten, neither do they spring from the 
thought of an unfortunate like myself, who is unskilled in art, and, concen-
trating only on the meaning, dictates thirty to forty pages at great speed in 
one hour, not writing himself but getting others to write. 

I became aware of them only after six years through the guidance of the 
Qur’an and the coinciding of nine instances of the pronoun اَ
ّ(cid:178)ِا in the Qur’anic 
commentary, I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z  ( S i g n s   o f   M i r a c u l o u s n e s s  ). The copyists were 
astounded when they heard about them from me. The words “ Allah’s Noble 
Messenger ” and “ Upon whom be blessings and peace ” in the Nineteenth 
Letter  were  like  a  small  mirror  reﬂecting  one  of  Muhammad’s  ( UWBP ) 
miracles.  Similarly,  the  word  “ Qur’an ”  in  the  Twenty-Fifth  Word,  T h e  
M i r a c u l o u s n e s s   o f   t h e   Q u r ’ a n , and in the Eighteenth Sign of the Nineteenth 
Letter, manifested a sort of miracle: of the forty classes of humanity, a kind 
of the Qur’an’s miraculousness was manifested before the class of people 
who rely on what they see with their eyes, in all the treatises in the form 
of coincidences from the Unseen, which is only one sort of the forty sorts 
of  that  kind  of  miraculousness.  And  of  its  forty  types,  it  was  manifested 
through the word “ Qur’an. ” It was as follows:

The word “ Qur’an ” was repeated a hundred times in the Twenty-Fifth 
Word and in the Eighteenth Sign of the Nineteenth Letter; it did not conform 
only rarely, once or twice; all the rest look to each other. For example, on 
page forty-three in the Second Ray, the word “ Qur’an ” appears seven times 
and they all face each other. On page ﬁfty-six, eight instances of it face each 
other; only the ninth is an exception. The ﬁve instances of the word on page 
sixty-nine, now open before me, face each other. And so on. On all the pages 
the instances of the word “ Qur’an ” correspond. Out of ﬁve or six only rarely 
does one remain outside the pattern. 

454

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

As  for  other  words,  on  page  thirty-three  –  now  open  in  front  of  me  – 
the  word  ْمَا  ( or )  is  repeated  ﬁfteen  times  and  fourteen  of  them  face  each 
other. And on this page there are nine instances of the word “ ī m ā n  ” ( faith 
or belief ); they face each other. Only, because the scribe left a large space, 
one of them has deviated a little. On the page now open before me, the word 
“ m a ḥ b ū b  ” ( beloved ) is repeated twice; one on the third line and one on the 
ﬁfteenth;  they  look  to  each  other  in  perfectly  balanced  fashion.  Between 
them,  four  instances  of  the  word  “ a ş k  ”  ( love )  have  been  arranged  look-
ing to each other. Other coincidences from the Unseen may be compared 
to these. Whoever the scribe, and whatever form their lines and pages take, 
these  coincidences  are  bound  to  occur  to  such  an  extent  that  it  cannot  be 
doubted  that  they  are  neither  the  work  of  chance  nor  the  creation  of  the 
author and scribes. However, they are more striking when written by some 
of them. This means there is a handwriting that ﬁts these treatises. Some of 
the scribes approach it. It is strange, it appears most not with the most skilful 
of them but with the most inexperienced. It is understood from this that the 
art, grace, and virtues of the Wo r d s , which are a sort of commentary on the 
Qur’an,  are  not  anybody’s;  the  garments  of  the  harmonious,  well-ordered 
style, which ﬁt the blessed stature of the orderly, beautiful Qur’anic truths, 
are not measured and cut out voluntarily and consciousnessly by anyone. It 
is that their stature requires them to be thus; it is an unseen hand that meas-
ures them and cuts them according to the stature, and clothes it in them. As 
for myself ( lit. us ), I am an interpreter among them, a servant.

FOURTH POINT

In your ﬁrst question, you ask ﬁve or six questions: “ What will the Great 
Gathering and Last Judgement be like? Will everyone be naked? How shall 
we ﬁnd our friends there, and how shall we ﬁnd Allah’s Noble Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) in order to avail ourselves of his inter-
cession? How will innumerable people meet with a single person? What will 
the garments of the people of Paradise and those of Hell be like? And who 
will show us the way? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  The answers to these questions are given most clearly and 
explicitly in the books of Hadith. Here we shall mention only one or two 
points related to our way and method. As follows: 

Firstly:  It  is  explained  in  a  letter  1  that  the  ﬁeld  of  the  resurrection  is 
within the earth’s annual orbit. Just as it now sends its immaterial produce 

1.  See, The First Letter, page 23-4.

TWENTY-EIGHTH LETTER – EIGHTH MATTER

455

to the tablets of that ﬁeld, so with its annual rotation it deﬁnes a circle, and 
through the produce of that existent circle is a source for the formation of the 
ﬁeld of the resurrection. The Lesser Hell at the centre of this dominical ship 
known as the earth will be emptied into the Greater Hell, so too its inhabit-
ants will be emptied into the ﬁeld of the resurrection.

Secondly: The occurrence of the resurrection, as well as the existence of 
the ﬁeld where it will take place, have been proved decisively chieﬂy in the 
Tenth and Twenty-Ninth Wo r d s , and in others of the Wo r d s .

Thirdly:  As  for  meeting  with  people,  it  is  proved  conclusively  in  the 
Sixteenth, Thirty-First, and Thirty-Second Wo r d s  that through the mystery 
of luminosity a person may be present in thousands of places at the same 
instant, and may meet with millions of people.

Fourthly: It is required by the name of All-Wise that at the Great Gather-
ing and resurrection of the dead, having been stripped of artiﬁcial clothes, 
Almighty Allah will clothe men in natural garments, just as He now clothes 
beings with spirits, other than man, in natural garments. In this world, the 
wisdom in artiﬁcial clothes is not restricted to protection against heat and 
cold, adornment, and covering the private parts; another important instance 
of  wisdom  is  their  resembling  an  index  or  list  indicating  man’s  power  of 
disposal over the other species of beings, and his relationship with them, and 
commandership over them. He might otherwise have been clothed in cheap 
and easy natural dress. For if it had not been for this wisdom, man would 
have draped himself in various rags, becoming the laughing-stock of con-
scious animals and a buffoon in their eyes; he would have make them laugh. 
At the resurrection of the dead this relation will not be present, nor will the 
instance of wisdom, so neither should the list be present.

Fifthly: When it comes to having someone to show the way, for those 
like yourself who have entered under the light of the Qur’an, it will be the 
Qur’an. Look at the start of the Suras which begin !  , and !  , and 4 : 
you  will  see  and  understand  how  acceptable  an  intercessor  is  the  Qur’an, 
how true a guide, how sacred a light! 

Sixthly: As for the garments of the people of Paradise and the people of 
Hell, the principle in the Twenty-Eighth Word explaining why the houris 
wear seventy dresses is applicable here too. It is as follows:

A person of Paradise will of course want to beneﬁt continuously from all 
the varieties of beings there. The good things of Paradise will vary greatly. 
He will all the time communicate with all the varieties of its beings. In which 

456

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

case, he will clothe himself and his houris in samples, in small amount, of 
the good things of Paradise, and they will each become like small Paradises.
For  example,  a  person  collects  together  in  his  garden  samples  of  the 
ﬂower species dispersed throughout the country, making it a miniature spec-
imen of it; and a shopkeeper collects samples of all his wares in a list; and 
a man makes for himself a garment and everything necessary for his house 
from samples of all the species of creatures in the world, which he governs, 
has disposal over, and with which he is connected.

Similarly, a person whose abode is Paradise – especially if he used all 
his senses and non-physical faculties in worship and has gained the right to 
experience the pleasures of Paradise – will himself and his houris be clothed 
by divine mercy in a sort of garment that will show every one of all the vari-
eties of the wonders of Paradise, so as to gratify all his senses, please all his 
members, and delight all his subtle faculties.

Evidence that those numerous garments will not all be of the same kind 
or sort is the Hadith: “ The houris will be dressed in seventy garments, yet 
the marrow in their leg bones will still be visible. ”  1 That is to say, from 
the top garment to the innermost one, there will be degrees gratifying and 
delighting all the senses and members with different subtle wonders in dif-
ferent ways. 

As for the people of Hell, since they committed sins in this world with 
their eyes, their ears, their hearts, their hands, and their minds, and so on, it 
does not seem contrary to wisdom and justice that in Hell they will be made 
to wear a garment made up of various pieces that will be a small Hell, and 
will cause them torment and pain in accordance with their sins.

You ask if in that period between prophets the forefathers of the Allah’s 
Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) belonged to a reli-
gion and were religious.

T h e   A n s w e r :  There are narrations stating that they were religious, adher-
ing  to  the  vestiges  of  the  religion  of  Abraham  ( Upon  whom  be  peace ),  2 
which, under the veils of heedlessness and spiritual darkness, persisted in

the Most Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) were not 
indifferent towards the light of the true religion and were not defeated by the 
darkness of unbelief. But in accordance with the verse,

( 17:15 ) ¿ ¾ ½ ¼ » º
people who live at a time between prophets will be saved. It has been stated 
unanimously  that  they  will  not  be  punished  for  their  mistakes  in  second-
ary matters. According to Imam Shaﬁ‘i and Imam Ash‘ari, even if they are 
deniers and do not believe in the fundamentals of belief, they will still be 
saved. For accountability to Allah is established with the sending of proph-
ets,  and  when  prophets  are  sent  people  become  accountable  by  knowing 
about their mission. Since heedlessness and the passage of time had obscured 
the  religions  of  the  former  prophets,  they  could  not  provide  the  proof  for 
the people of that time. If the people obeyed the former religion, they will 
receive reward; if they did not, they will not be punished. For since it was 
hidden, it could not be a proof.

SIXTH POINT

You  ask:  “ Were  there  any  prophets  among  the  forefathers  of  Allah’s 

Noble Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace )? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :   There  is  no  certain  narration  that  there  were  any  after 
Isma‘il ( Upon whom be peace ). Only two prophets appeared, called Khalid 
b. Sinan 1 and Hanzala, 2 who were not his ancestors. But one of his forefa-
thers, Ka‘b b. Lu’ayy, composed the following famous and explicit poem, 
as though quoting scripture: 

 3  اَ(cid:182)ُر(cid:193)ِ(cid:93)َ(cid:114) اً(cid:162)وُد َ(cid:134) اًراَ(cid:93)ْ(cid:114)َا ُرِ(cid:93)ْ(cid:115)ُ(cid:193)َ(cid:158)  *  ٌد َ

which resembles prophetic and miraculous utterance. Relying on both evi-
dence and illumination, Imam-i Rabbani said: “ Numerous prophets appeared 
in India, but some of them had no followers or only a few people, so they did 
not become well-known or were not called prophets. ” 4

According to this principle of the Imam, it is possible there were prophets 

of this kind among the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) forefathers.

You ask: “ Which of the narrations mentioning the faith of the Messen-
ger’s ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) parents, and that of his grandfa-
ther ‘Abd al-Muttalib, is the most authentic and sound? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :   For  ten  years  the  New  Said  has  had  no  book  with  him 
other than the Qur’an, which he says is sufﬁcient for him. I do not have the 
time to study all the books of Hadith about secondary matters such as that, 
and  write  which  is  the  soundest  and  most  authentic.  I  will  only  say  this 
much, that the Noble Messenger’s ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 
parents  were  believers  and  will  be  saved  and  go  to  Paradise.  1  Surely 
Almighty Allah would not wound His Noble Beloved’s blessed heart with 
its ﬁlial tenderness.

I f   i t   i s   a s k e d :  “ Seeing that it is thus, why weren’t they able to believe in 
Allah’s Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace )? Why didn’t they 
live to see his mission? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  Out of His muniﬁcence, in order to gratify the Messenger’s 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) ﬁlial sentiments, Almighty Allah did 
not put his parents under any obligation to him. His mercy required that to 
make them happy and to please His Noble Beloved, He did not take them 
from the rank of parenthood and put them in that of spiritual offspring; He 
did not place his parents and grandfather among his outward community. 
However,  He  bestowed  on  them  the  merit,  virtues,  and  happiness  of  his 
community. If an exalted ﬁeld marshal’s father, who has the rank of captain, 
entered his son’s presence, he would be overwhelmed by two opposing emo-
tions. So, compassionately, the king does not post the father to the retinue of 
his elevated lieutenant, the ﬁeld marshal.

loved  Almighty  Allah’s  Noble  Beloved  sincerely  and  protected  and  sup-
ported him; it was because of feelings like shame and tribal solidarity that he 
did not believe in him in acceptable fashion, not out of denial and obduracy. 
If due to this he goes to Hell, Allah Almighty may create a sort of particular 
Paradise for him, in reward for his good actions. As He sometimes creates 
the spring during winter, and for people in prison by means of sleep trans-
forms the prison into a palace, so too He may turn a particular Hell into a 
sort of particular Paradise.

My Dear, Loyal Brother and True Friend in the Service of the Qur’an!
This  time  in  your  letter  you  want  an  answer  to  an  important  question 

which neither my time nor my state of mind permit me to answer.

My brother! Praise be to Allah, this year the numbers of those writing out 
the treatises have grown considerably. The copies come to me for the second 
correction  and  I  am  busy  doing  them  speedily  from  morning  to  evening. 
Other important jobs remain undone but I consider this duty to be far more 
important. The heart predominates over the reason in the months of Sha‘ban 
and Ramadan in particular, and the spirit becomes animated. So I shall post-
pone this important matter to another time and write to you about it gradu-
ally whenever my heart is inspired by Almighty Allah’s mercy. For now I 
shall explain three points. 1

First Point

FIRST POINT

The idea expressed as: “ The All-Wise Qur’an’s mysteries are not known; 
the Qur’anic commentators have not understood its reality ” has two aspects, 
and there are two groups of people who say it:

The First are the people of truth and the exacting scholars. They say: 
“ The Qur’an is an unending, inexhaustible treasury. Every era both submits 
to and accepts its established, incontestible matters, and receives its share of 
its hidden truths as a sort of supplement; it cannot trespass on the shares of 

1.  The nine Points were ﬁnally completed.

460

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – FIRST SECTION

461

other ages which are concealed. ” Yes, that is to say, as time passes the All-
Wise Qur’an’s truths are increasingly disclosed. But not, Allah forbid! so 
as to cause doubt concerning the self-evident Qur’anic truths that previous 
generations have expounded. For belief in them is obligatory; they are estab-
lished, deﬁnite, fundamental, and basic. The verse,  ( 16:103 ) 1 0 
states that its meaning is clear. From beginning to end, the divine address 
revolves around those meanings, corroborating them and making them clear. 
Not  to  accept  those  authoritative  meanings  suggests,  Allah  forbid!,  deny-
ing Almighty Allah and insulting the Messenger’s ( UWBP ) understanding. 
That is to say, those authoritative meanings have been taken successively 
from the source of Messengership. Ibn Jarir al-Tabari wrote his great com-
mentary relating all the meanings of the Qur’an through chains of authentic 
transmission to the source of Messengership.

The Second Group are either foolish friends who cause harm and make 
matters worse, or they are diabolically cunning enemies who want to oppose 
the rulings of Islam and truths of belief. They want to ﬁnd a way into the 
fortiﬁed Suras of the All-Wise Qur’an, which, in your words, are each like 
steel strongholds. People like that spread about ideas like the above in order, 
Allah forbid!, to excite doubts about the truths of belief and the Qur’an.

Second Point

SECOND POINT

Almighty Allah swears by many things in the Qur’an. The Qur’anic oaths 
contain  numerous  mysteries  and  signiﬁcant  points.  For  example,  the  oath 
in   ( 91:1 ) " !  forms the basis of the splendid comparison in the 
Eleventh Word; it depicts the universe as a palace and a city. The oath of 
( 36:1-2 )    ? >  *    <    calls  attention  to  the  sacredness  of  the 
Qur’an’s miraculousness, and indicates that it is so worthy of veneration it 
can be sworn by. The oaths in  ( 53:1 ) # " ! and 
( 56:75-76 ) × Ö Õ Ô Ó  *   Ñ Ð Ï Î indicate 
that falling stars are a sign that jinns and devils have been prevented from 
receiving news from the Unseen so that they cannot cause doubts about rev-
elation. They also point to the vast power and perfect wisdom in the awe-
somely vast stars being set in their places in perfect order and in the planets 
being made to revolve in wondrous manner. With the oaths, ( 51:1 ) μ  
( 77:1 ) a it attracts attention to the angels appointed to the winds, in 

462

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

order to call to mind the signiﬁcant instances of wisdom in the disposal of 
the air and its movement in waves. For the elements, which are supposed 
to  be  governed  by  chance,  perform  important  duties  for  most  subtle  pur-
poses; and so on. All the oaths and their positions contain different points 
and different purposes. For now, since the time is inconvenient, I shall indi-
cate brieﬂy only one ﬁne point out of many in the oath,  ( 95:1 ) " ! 
as follows:
By swearing by the ﬁg and the olive, Almighty Allah calls to mind the 
immensity of His power and the perfection of His mercy and His extensive 
bounties, in order to redirect those people who are heading for the lowest of 
the low, showing that they may progress spiritually, through thanks, reﬂec-
tion, belief, and good works as far as the highest of the high. The reason for 
specifying the ﬁg and the olive is that as fruits they are most blessed and 
beneﬁcial, and their creation comprises many notable things and bounties. 
For the olive is utilized for illumination and food, and is a basic commodity 
in social and commercial life. The ﬁg is the same; it displays in its creation 
a miracle of power by encapsulating in its miniscule seed all the members 
of the huge ﬁg-tree, and is a divine bounty both in its being a food, and its 
uses, and contrary to other fruits its continuity, and many other advantages. 
It calls all this to mind with the oath and instructs man to draw lessons from 
them so as to believe and perform good works, and not to fall to the lowest 
of the low.

Third Point

THIRD POINT

The  disjointed  letters  at  the  start  of  some  Suras  are  a  divine  cipher. 
Almighty Allah makes allusion to matters of the Unseen with them for His 
special servant. The key to the cipher is with that servant, and with his heirs. 
The All-Wise Qur’an addresses all eras and all the groups of mankind. It 
contains numerous different aspects and meanings that comprise the share 
of every class in every age. The purest share was that of the righteous ﬁrst 
generations of Islam, and they expounded it. The people of sainthood and 
the  veriﬁers  of  reality  have  found  in  their  writings  numerous  allusions  to 
the matters of the Unseen pertaining to spiritual journeying. We have dis-
cussed them to a small extent from the point of view of the miraculousness 
of the Qur’an’s eloquence in the commentary called I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z  ( S i g n s  
o f   M i r a c u l o u s n e s s  ), at the start of Sura al-Baqara; it may be referred to.

The  Twenty-Fifth  Word  has  proved  that  a  true  translation  of  the  All-
Wise Qur’an is not possible. Also, the elevated style of its miraculousness 
cannot  be  translated.  It  would  be  extremely  difﬁcult  to  express  and  make 
understood  the  pleasure  and  reality  arising  from  the  elevated  style  in  the 
miraculousness of its meanings ( m â n e v î   i ’ c a z  ). However, we shall allude to 
one or two aspects of it in order to show the way, as follows:

( 30:22 ) v u t s r q p o
( 39:67 ) Ä Ã Â
( 39:6 ) : 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

( 57:6 ) _ ^ ] \
Through verses like these, with a wondrously elevated style and miraculous 
comprehensiveness, the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition depicts the reality 
of creativity for the imagination, indicating the following: “ With whichever 
hammer the universe’s builder, who is the Maker of the world, fastened the 
sun and moon in their places, with the same hammer and at the same instant 
He ﬁxes atoms in their places, for example in the pupils of living creatures’ 
eyes. And with whichever measure, whichever immaterial instrument, He 
arranged the heavens and unfolded them, at the same instant and with the 
same  arrangement,  He  opens  up  the  eye  removing  its  veils;  He  makes  it, 
orders  it,  and  situates  it.  And  with  whichever  immaterial  hammer  of  His 
power, the All-Glorious Maker fastens the stars to the skies, with that same 
hammer He fastens man’s innumerable distinguishing marks on his counte-
nance and his external and inner senses in their places. ”

That is to say, in order to show His works to both the eye and the ear 
while He is at work, the All-Glorious Maker strikes a hammer on an atom 
with  the  verses  of  the  Qur’an,  and  with  another  word  of  the  same  verse 
strikes the hammer on the sun; with an elevated style as though striking it 
right in the centre, He demonstrates His unity within His oneness, and His 
inﬁnite  glory  within  His  inﬁnite  beauty,  and  His  inﬁnite  tremendousness 
within His inﬁnite concealedness, and His inﬁnite breadth within His inﬁnite 
precision, and His inﬁnite majesty within His inﬁnite mercy, and His inﬁnite 

464

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

distance  within  His  inﬁnite  proximity.  The  Qur’an  expresses  the  ultimate 
degree of the combining of opposites, which is considered to be impossible, 
in a way that is necessary; it proves this and demonstrates it. Thus, it is this 
sort of exposition and style that causes the most wondrous literary genius to 
prostrate before its eloquence.

And for example, through the verse,

 , + * ) ( ' & % $ # " ! ﴿
( 25 :ﻡﻭﺮﻟﺍ )  ﴾1 0 / . -
Almighty Allah shows the magniﬁcence of the sovereignty of His domini-
cality in the following elevated manner:

At a single command or a signal like a bugle, the beings in the heavens 
and earth, which are like two obedient barracks or two orderly army head-
quarters, will spring up with alacrity and perfect obedience from their sleep 
in the veils of transience and non-existence. Declaring: “ At your service! ”, 
they will assemble on the ﬁeld of the resurrection and last judgement.

With what miraculous and elevated style it describes the resurrection of 
the dead and Great Gathering! It points to the following convincing proof 
contained  in  its  assertion:  observedly,  seeds  concealed  as  though  dead  in 
the  darkness  of  the  earth  and  drops  of  water  hidden  and  dispersed,  non-
existent, in the atmosphere are raised to life swiftly and with perfect order 
every spring. They emerge onto the ﬁeld of trial and examination, perpetual 
examples of resurrection. At the supreme resurrection, beings will emerge 
with same ease. Since you observe the one here, you cannot deny the other. 
And so on. You can compare the degree of eloquence in other verses with 
this one. Would it be possible to do a true translation of this sort of verse? 
Surely it would not! At best it would be an abbreviated meaning, or an inter-
pretation, with ﬁve or six lines for each phrase.

For example, “ All praise be to Allah ” U T is a Qur’anic phrase. Its 

briefest meaning, required by the rules of grammar and rhetoric, is this:

eternity  is  particular  to  and  due  to  the  Necessarily  Existent  One  alone, 
who  is  named  Allah. ”  It  is  as  follows:  “ Each  individual  instance  of  all 
the sorts of praise ” is the consequence of the deﬁnite article “ a l  ” in “ a l -
h a m d . ” As for the qualiﬁcation of “ that has been offered by whatever, ” 
since  “ praise ”  ( h a m d  )  is  the  verbal  noun  and  the  active  participle  has 
been  omitted,  it  expresses  generality  in  that  sense.  By  omitting  the  pas-
sive  participle  it  again  expresses  universality  and  generality,  and  there-
fore  expresses  the  qualiﬁcation  “ to  whatever. ”  As  for  the  qualiﬁcation 
of “ from pre-eternity to post-eternity, ” it expresses this meaning because 
the  rule  of  transposing  from  a  verbal  clause  to  a  noun  clause  indicates 
continuity. The prepositional “ l ā m  ” in “ l i ’ l l ā h  ” [ to Allah ], expresses the 
meaning of sole possession and worthiness. As for the qualiﬁcation of “ the 
Necessarily  Existent  One,  who  is  named  Allah, ”  since  necessary  exist-
ence is the necessary requisite of the Godhead and a term signifying the 
All-Glorious Essence; comprising all the divine names and attributes and 
being the greatest name, the name of “ Allah ” necessarily indicates both 
the necessary existence and the title of “ Necessarily Existent One. ” 

If the shortest apparent meaning of the phrase “ All praise be to Allah ” on 
which all the scholars of Arabic are agreed is thus, how could it be translated 
into another language with the same miraculousness and power?

Furthermore, among all the languages of the world, there is only one that 
can compare with Arabic in being the language of grammar, and that can 
never achieve the comprehensiveness of Arabic. Is it possible for transla-
tions into other composite and inﬂectional languages by people whose under-
standing is partial, comprehension short, ideas confused, and hearts dark, to 
take the place of the sacred words of the Qur’an, which have emerged in 
miraculous fashion in that comprehensive and wondrous grammatical lan-
guage through an all-encompassing knowledge that knows all its aspects at 
once and wills them. I can even say, and perhaps prove, that all the Qur’an’s 
words are like treasuries of truths, with sometimes a single letter teaching a 
page of truths.

I shall recount a luminous experience and true vision I had for the pur-

pose of elucidating the above. It was as follows:

One time, I was pondering over the use of the ﬁrst person plural in the 
verse    ( 1:5 )  5 4 3 2    and  my  heart  was  seeking  the 

466

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

reason  for  the  ﬁrst  person  singular  being  transposed  into  the  ﬁrst  person 
plural of “ we worship ”( n a ‘ b u d u  ). Suddenly from that “ N ū n  ” the mystery 
and virtues of performing the prayers in congregation were unfolded to me. 
I saw that my participating in the congregation in Bayezid Mosque, where 
I was performing the prayer, made each member of the congregation a sort 
of intercessor for me who testiﬁed to and afﬁrmed each of the statements I 
pronounced  while  reciting  the  prayers.  In  the  midst  of  the  great,  multiple 
worship of the congregation, I felt the courage to offer my deﬁcient worship 
to the divine court. Then a further veil was lifted. That is, all the mosques 
of Istanbul were added. The city became like Beyazid Mosque. Suddenly I 
felt as though I were receiving their prayers and afﬁrmation. Then within 
that, I saw myself in the mosque of the face of the earth, in the circular rows 
around the Ka‘ba. I declared: “ ) ( ' &  I have inter-
cessors to this great number; they are all reciting exactly the same words as 
I am saying, conﬁrming me. ” As this veil was raised by my imagination, the 
Noble Ka‘ba appeared to be the m i h r a b . Seizing the opportunity, I called on 
the ranks of the congregation to testify and entrusted to the Black Stone the 
َ(cid:202) ْنَا ُدَ(cid:183) ْ(cid:130)َا While 
interpreter of faith, that is, ِ
pronouncing this, a further situation was laid open before me: I saw that the 
congregation of which I was a part was divided into three circles:

ّ(cid:195)ا ُلو ُ(cid:126)َر اًد َ

ّنَا ُدَ(cid:183) ْ(cid:130)َاَو ُ

ّ(cid:175)َ(cid:111)ُ(cid:174) َ

ّ(cid:195)ا  َ

The First Circle was the vast congregation of believers and those who 

afﬁrm divine unity on the face of the earth.

The Second Circle: I looked and saw that I was part of a congregation 
consisting of all beings, all of which, performing prayers and gloriﬁcation, 
were occupied with the benedictions and gloriﬁcation particular to its group 
and species. Their worship consists of the activities we observe, called “ the 
ّ(cid:195)َا before this, I bowed my head in 
functions of things. ” Declaring: ُرَ(cid:93)ﯰﯦَا ُ
wonderment, and looked at myself:

Within  a  Third  Circle  I  saw  an  astonishing  microcosm  which  was 
apparently and qualitatively small, but in reality, number, and duties, great. 
This, from the particles of my being to my external senses was a congre-
gation  in  which  every  group  was  preoccupied  with  duties  of  worship  and 
thanks. In this circle, the dominical inner faculty in my heart was declaring: 
5 4 3 2 in the name of the congregation. Just as in the 
two former congregations my tongue had said it, having formed the inten-
tion to say it in their names.

I n   S h o r t :  The “ N ū n  ” of 3 indicates these three congregations. While 
pondering over this, the collective personality of Allah’s Noble Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), the Interpreter and Herald of the All-
Wise  Qur’an,  was  suddenly  embodied  in  all  its  majesty  in  his  immaterial 
pulpit in Medina. Like everyone, I as though heard his address of 
( 2:21 )  o n m l  and  everyone  in  those  three  congregations 
responded like me, saying, 3 2 In accordance with the rule, 
ِهِ(cid:174)ِزاَوَ(cid:171)ِ(cid:92)  َتَ(cid:93)َ(cid:102) ُء ْي َ

ّ(cid:131)(cid:170)ا  َتَ(cid:93)َ(cid:102) اَذِا the following truth was imparted to my mind:

Taking mankind as His addressee, the Sustainer of All the Worlds speaks 
with all beings, and His Messenger ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 
conveys that lofty address to mankind, indeed, to all beings with spirits and 
consciousness. All the past and the future have become like the present; the 
address is being delivered to mankind, all of which is in a single gathering, in 
the form of a congregation the rows of which all differ. I then saw that each 
Qur’anic verse possesses an elevated power, eloquence, and beauty which 
it had received from the grandeur and compass of its station, its extremely 
numerous, various, and signiﬁcant addressees, from the Pre-Eternal Speaker, 
the One of inﬁnite glory and grandeur, and from its exalted Interpreter, who 
is at the rank of Allah’s beloved; I saw each verse bathed in a brilliant, truly 
brilliant, light of miraculousness. Then, not the whole Qur’an, or a Sura, or a 
verse, but all its words seemed to be miracles. “ All praise be to Allah for the 
light of belief and the Qur’an, ” I declared. I emerged from my imagining, 
which was pure reality, the same as I had entered the “ N ū n  ” of 3 and I 
understood that not only the Qur’an’s verses and words, but some of its let-
ters, like the “ N ū n  ” of 3 are luminous keys to important truths.
After my heart and imagination had emerged from the “ N ū n  ” of 3 
my mind came forward and said: I want my share too. I cannot ﬂy like you; 
my feet are evidences and proofs. The way leading to the Creator, the Wor-
shipped One and One from whom help is sought, has to be pointed out in 
the same 3 and 5 ( “ You alone d o   w e   w o r s h i p  and from You 
alone d o   w e   s e e k   h e l p  ” ), so that I can accompany you. It then occurred to 
my heart to say the following to my bewildered mind:

Consider all the beings in the universe; whether living or inanimate, in 
perfect order and obedience they all have their worship which is in the form 
of duties. Although some of them lack feelings and intelligence, they perform 

468

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

their duties in conscious, orderly, and worshipful fashion. This means there 
is a True Object of Worship, an Absolute Commander, who impels them to 
worship and employs them.

Now consider too the beings and particularly the living ones; while each 
has  extremely  numerous  and  various  needs,  which  have  to  be  met  for  its 
continued existence, its hands cannot reach the smallest of them; its power 
is insufﬁcient. Yet they all receive their innumerable needs regularly, from 
unexpected places, at the appropriate time; this is clearly to be seen.

Thus, these boundless needs and this boundless want of beings and that 
extraordinary  assistance  from  the  Unseen  and  merciful  succour  self-evi-
dently demonstrate that the beings have a Protector and Provider who pos-
sesses absolute riches, is Absolutely Generous and Absolutely Powerful; it 
is from Him that everything and all living beings seek help and await suc-
cour, in effect saying: 5 4 So then my mind declared: “ We 
believe in this and assent to it! ”

Then, when I said: 

( 1:6-7 ) > = < ;  *   9 8 7
I saw among the convoys of mankind that were travelling towards the past, 
was the luminous, radiant caravan of the prophets, the veracious ones, the 
martyrs,  the  saints,  and  the  righteous.  They  were  scattering  the  darkness 
of  the  future  and  travelling  the  road  to  post-eternity  on  a  straight  way,  a 
direct highway. The phrase was showing me the way to join the caravan, 
indeed, it was joining me to it. Suddenly I exclaimed: “ Glory be to Allah! 
Anyone with an iota of intelligence must know what a loss it is not to join 
that  long,  light-scattering  caravan  which  is  illuminating  the  future  and 
travelling in perfect safety. Where can one who deviates from it by creat-

their skins now estranged, withered, thick, and extraneous. In exactly the 
same way, the prophetic and divine phrases of the marks of Islam are like 
a living, meritorious skin. On being stripped away, the luminosity of the 
meanings is temporarily naked and somewhat visible. But like a fruit that 
has been peeled of its skin, the spirit of those blessed meanings ﬂies away 
leaving  behind  the  human  skin  in  darkened  hearts  and  minds.  The  light

marks concern everyone and everyone participates in them. To interfere in 
them  without  the  consent  of  the  public  is  an  infringement  of  the  public’s 
rights. The most minor of those marks ( one which has the status of Sunna ) 
is equal in importance to the greatest matter. They concern the whole world

all the great ﬁgures of Islam since the Era of the Prophet till now have been

Instances of wisdom or beneﬁts cannot change the marks of Islam related 
to  worship;  the  aspect  of  them  related  to  worship  preponderates  and  they 
may not be touched. They may not be changed, even for a thousand ben-
eﬁts. Similarly, it is not right to claim that the uses of the marks of Islam are 
limited to their well-known purposes. It is a false idea. Such purposes are 
only one out of many. For instance, someone may say: “ The wisdom in and 
purpose of the call to prayer is to summon Muslims to prayer; in which case, 
it would be enough just to ﬁre a riﬂe. ” However, the foolish person does not 
know that the summons is only one purpose out of the thousands. Even if 
the sound of a riﬂe shot serves the purpose, how, in the name of mankind, 
or in the name of the people of the town, can it substitute the call to prayer, 
which  is  a  means  of  proclaiming  worship  before  divine  dominicality  and 
heralding divine unity, the supreme results of the creation of the universe 
and of mankind?

First Point

First Point

The fast of Ramadan is one of the ﬁve pillars of Islam; it is also one of the 

greatest of the marks and observances of Islam.

There are many purposes and instances of wisdom in the fast of Ramadan 
which  look  to  both  Allah  Almighty’s  dominicality,  and  man’s  social  life, 
and his personal life, and the training of his instinctual soul, and his grati-
tude for divine bounties. One of the many instances of wisdom in fasting in 
respect of Allah Almighty’s dominicality is as follows:

Allah Almighty creates the face of the earth in the form of a table laden 
with bounties, and arranges on the table every sort of bounty as an expres-
sion of ( 65:3 ) u t s r In this way He states the perfection of His 
dominicality and His mercifulness and compassionateness. People are una-
ble to discern clearly the reality of this situation while in the sphere of causes, 
under the veil of heedlessness, and they sometimes forget it. But during the 
month of Ramadan, the people of faith suddenly appear as a well-disciplined 
army:  as  sunset  approaches,  they  display  a  worshipful  attitude  as  though, 

471

472

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

having been invited to the Pre-Eternal Monarch’s banquet, they await the 
command of “ Fall to and help yourselves! ” They respond to that compas-
sionate, illustrious, and universal mercy with comprehensive, exalted, and 
orderly  worship.  Do  those  people  who  fail  to  participate  in  such  elevated 
worship and noble bounties deserve to be called human beings?

Second Point

Second Point

One of the many instances of wisdom in the fast of the blessed month of 
Ramadan with respect to thankfulness for Allah Almighty’s bounties is as 
follows:

As is stated in the First Word, a price is required for the foods a tray-
bearer brings from the royal kitchen. But to look on those priceless bounties 
as valueless while tipping the tray-bearer, and not to recognize the one who 
bestowed them is the greatest foolishness. 

Allah Almighty has spread innumerable sorts of bounties over the face 
of the earth for mankind, in return for which He wishes thanks, as the price 
of those bounties. The apparent causes and holders of the bounties resem-
ble tray-bearers. We pay a certain price to them and are indebted to them, 
and  even  though  they  do  not  merit  it  are  over-respectful  and  grateful  to 
them. Whereas the True Bestower of Bounties is inﬁnitely more deserving 
of thanks than those causes which are merely the means of the bounty. To 
thank Him, then, is to recognize that the bounties come directly from Him; it 
is to appreciate their worth and to perceive one’s own need for them.

Fasting in Ramadan, then, is the key to true, sincere, extensive, and uni-
versal thankfulness. For at other times of the year, most people whose cir-
cumstances are not difﬁcult do not realize the value of many bounties since 
they do not experience real hunger. If their stomachs are full and especially 
if they are rich, they do not understand the degree of bounty present in a 
piece of dry bread. But when it is time to break the fast, the sense of taste tes-
tiﬁes that the dry bread is a precious divine bounty in the eyes of a believer. 
During Ramadan, everyone from the monarch to the destitute manifests a 
sort of gratitude through understanding the value of those bounties.

Furthermore, since eating is prohibited during the day, they say: “ Those 
bounties do not belong to me. I am not free to eat them, for they belong to 
someone else and are his gift. I await his command. ” They recognize the 
bounty to be bounty and so give thanks. Thus, fasting in this way is in many 
respects a key to gratitude; gratitude being man’s fundamental duty.

Third Point

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – SECOND SECTION

473

Third Point

One of the many instances of wisdom in fasting from the point of view of 

man’s social life is as follows:

Human beings have been created differently with regard to their liveli-
hoods.  In  consequence  of  this,  Allah  Almighty  invites  the  rich  to  assist 
the poor, so that through the hunger experienced in fasting, they can truly 
understand the pains and hunger which the poor suffer. If there were no 
fasting,  many  self-indulgent  rich  would  be  unable  to  perceive  just  how 
grievous are hunger and poverty and how needy of compassion are those 
who suffer them.

Compassion for one’s fellow men is an essential part of true thankful-
ness. Whoever a person is, there will always be someone poorer than himself 
in some respect. He is enjoined to be compassionate towards such a person. 
If he were not himself compelled to suffer hunger, he would be unable give 
the person – through compassion – the help and assistance he is obliged to 
offer. And even if he were able, it would be deﬁcient, for he would not have 
truly experienced hunger himself.

Fourth Point

Fourth Point

One instance of wisdom in fasting in Ramadan with respect to training 

the instinctual soul is as follows:

The  instinctual  soul  wants  to  be  free  and  independent,  and  considers 
itself to be thus. According to the dictates of its nature, it even desires an 
imaginary dominicality and to act as it pleases. It does not want to admit that 
it is being sustained and trained through innumerable bounties. Especially if 
it possesses worldly wealth and power, and if heedlessness also encourages 
it, it will devour Allah’s bounties like a usurping, thieving animal.

Thus, in the month of Ramadan, the instinctual soul of everyone, from 
the  richest  to  the  poorest,  may  understand  that  it  does  not  own  itself  but 
is totally owned; that it is not free, but is a slave. It understands that if it 
receives no command, it may not do the simplest and easiest thing; it cannot 
even stretch out its hand for water. Its imaginary dominicality is therefore 
shattered; it performs its worship and begins to offer thanks, its true duty.

One of the many instances of wisdom in fasting in Ramadan from the 
point of view of improving the conduct of the instinctual soul and giving up 
its rebellious habits is as follows:

474

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

Due  to  its  heedlessness  the  human  soul  forgets  itself;  it  cannot  see  its 
utter powerlessness, want, and deﬁciency and it does not wish to see them. 
It does not think of just how weak it is, and how subject to transience and 
to disasters, nor of the fact that it consists merely of ﬂesh and bones, which 
quickly decay and fall apart. Simply, it assaults the world as though it pos-
sessed a body made of steel and imagined itself to be undying and eternal. 
It hurls itself on the world with intense greed and voracity, and passionate 
attachment  and  love.  It  is  captivated  by  anything  that  gives  it  pleasure  or 
that proﬁts it. Moreover, it forgets its Creator, who sustains it with perfect 
compassion, and does not think of the consequences of its life and its life in 
the hereafter. Indeed, it wallows in dissipation and misconduct.

However, fasting in the month of Ramadan awakens even the most heed-
less and obstinate to their weakness, impotence, and want. Hunger makes 
them  think  of  their  stomachs  and  they  understand  the  need  therein.  They 
realize how unsound are their weak bodies, and perceive how needy they 
are for kindness and compassion. So they abandon the soul’s pharaoh-like 
despotism and recognizing their utter impotence and want, perceive a desire 
to take refuge at the divine court. They prepare themselves to knock at the 
door of mercy with the hands of thankfulness – so long as heedlessness has 
not destroyed their hearts, that is.

Sixth Point

One of the many instances of wisdom in fasting in Ramadan from the 
point of view of the revelation of the All-Wise Qur’an, and the month of 
Ramadan being the most important time in its revelation, is as follows:

Since  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  was  revealed  in  the  month  of  Ramadan,  to 
shun  the  lower  demands  of  the  soul  and  trivialities  and  to  resemble  the 
angelic state by abstaining from food and drink in order to greet that heav-
enly address in the best manner, is to attain to a holy state. And to read and 
listen to the Qur’an as though it were just revealed, to listen to the divine 
address in it as if it were being revealed that very instant, to listen to that 
address as though hearing it from Allah’s Noble Messenger ( Upon whom 
be blessings and peace ), indeed, from the Angel Gabriel, or from the Pre-
Eternal Speaker Himself, is to attain to that same holy state. To act in this 
way is to act as an interpreter and to cause others to listen to it and in some 
degree to demonstrate the wisdom in the Qur’an’s revelation.

Indeed, it is as if the world of Islam becomes a mosque during the month 
of  Ramadan  in  every  corner  of  which  millions  of  those  who  know  the 

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – SECOND SECTION

475

whole  Qur’an  by  heart  make  the  dwellers  on  the  earth  hear  the  heavenly 
address.  Each  Ramadan  proclaims  in  luminous  shining  manner  the  verse 
( 2:185 )  m l k j i h  it  proves  that  Ramadan  is  the 
month of the Qur’an. Some of the members of the vast congregation listen 
to the reciters with reverence, while others read it themselves.

Following the appetites of the base instinctual soul while in that sacred 
mosque, and quitting that luminous condition through eating and drinking 
is truly loathsome and makes such a person the target of the aversion and 
disgust of the congregation in the mosque. People who oppose those fasting 
during Ramadan are to the same extent the target of the aversion and disgust 
of the whole world of Islam.

One of the many instances of wisdom in the fast of Ramadan with respect 
to man’s gain and proﬁt, who comes to this world to cultivate and trade for 
the hereafter, is as follows:

The  reward  for  actions  in  the  month  of  Ramadan  is  a  thousandfold. 
According to Hadith, each word of the All-Wise Qur’an has ten merits; each 
is counted as ten merits and will yield ten fruits in Paradise. While during 
Ramadan,  each  word  bears  not  ten  fruits  but  a  thousand,  and  verses  like 
Ay a t   a l - K u r s i   ( 2:255 ) thousands for each word, and on Fridays in Ramadan 
it is even more. And on the Night of Power, each word is counted as thirty 
thousand merits.

Indeed, the All-Wise Qur’an, each of whose words yield thirty thousand 
eternal  fruits,  is  like  a  luminous  Tree  of  Tuba  that  gains  for  believers  in 
Ramadan millions of those eternal fruits. So, come and look at this sacred, 
eternal proﬁtable trade, then consider it and understand the inﬁnite loss of 
those who do not appreciate the value of its words. 

To put it simply, the month of Ramadan is an extremely proﬁtable dis-
play and market for the trade of the hereafter. It is an extremely fertile piece 
of land for the crops of the next world. For the growth and ﬂourishing of 
actions it is like April showers in the spring. It is a brilliant holy festival for 
the  parade  of  mankind’s  worship  in  the  face  of  the  sovereignty  of  divine 
dominicality.  Since  it  is  thus,  mankind  has  been  charged  with  fasting  in 
order not to heedlessly indulge the animal needs of the instinctual soul like 
eating and drinking, nor to indulge the appetites lustfully and in trivialities. 

476

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

For,  by  temporarily  rising  above  animality  and  quitting  the  calls  of  this 
world  man  approaches  the  angelic  state  and  enters  upon  the  trade  of  the 
hereafter. By fasting, he approaches the state of the hereafter and that of a 
spirit appearing in bodily form. It is as if man then becomes a sort of mir-
ror reﬂecting the Eternally Besought One. Indeed, the month of Ramadan 
comprises and gains a permanent, eternal life in this ﬂeeting world and brief 
transient life. Certainly, a single Ramadan can produce fruits equal to that of 
a lifetime of eighty years. The Qur’an stating that the Night of Power is more 
auspicious than a thousand months is a decisive proof of this.

For example, a monarch may declare certain days to be festivals during 
his reign, or perhaps once a year, either on his accession to the throne or on 
some other days that reﬂect a glittering manifestation of his sovereignty. On 
those occasions he favours his subjects, not within the compass of his laws 
generally  but  with  his  special  bounties  and  favours  through  his  unveiled 
presence and his wondrous activities. He favours with his especial regard 
and attention those of his nation who are completely loyal and worthy .

In the same way, the All-Glorious Monarch of eighteen thousand worlds, 
who is the Sovereign of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity, revealed in Ramadan 
the illustrious decree of the All-Wise Qur’an, which looks to the eighteen 
thousand worlds. It is a requirement of wisdom, then, that Ramadan should 
be like special divine festival, a dominical display, and a spiritual gathering. 
Since Ramadan is such festival, Allah has commanded man to fast, in order 
to disengage him to a degree from base, animal activities.

The most excellent fasting is to make the human senses and organs, such 
as the eyes, ears, heart, and thoughts, fast together with the stomach. That is, 
to withdraw them from unlawful things and from trivia, and to urge each of 
them to their particular worship. For example, to ban the tongue from lying, 
backbiting, and obscene language and to make it fast; and to busy it with 
such  activities  as  reciting  the  Qur’an,  praying,  glorifying  Allah’s  names, 
asking for Allah’s blessings for the Prophet Muhammad ( Upon whom be 
blessings and peace ), and seeking forgiveness for sins; and for example, to 
prevent the eyes looking at members of the opposite sex outside the stipu-
lated degrees of kinship, and the ears from hearing harmful things, and to use 
the eyes to take lessons and the ears to listen to the truth and to the Qur’an, 
is to make other organs fast too. As a matter of fact, since the stomach is the 
largest factory, when it has an enforced holiday from work through fasting, 
the other small workshops are made to follow it easily.

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – SECOND SECTION

Eighth Point

One of the many instances of wisdom in Ramadan from the point of view 

of man’s personal life is as follows:

It  is  a  healing  physical  and  spiritual  diet  of  the  most  important  kind. 
When man’s instinctual soul eats and drinks just as it pleases, it is both 
harmful for man’s physical life from the medical point of view, and when 
it  hurls  itself  on  everything  it  encounters  whether  licit  or  illicit,  it  quite 
simply poisons his spiritual life. Further, it is difﬁcult for such a soul to 
obey the heart and the spirit; it wilfully takes the reins into its own hands 
and then man cannot ride it, it rather rides man. But by means of fasting 
in Ramadan, it becomes accustomed to a sort of diet. It tries to discipline 
itself and learns to listen to commands.

Furthermore, it will not invite illness to that miserable, weak stomach by 
cramming it with food before the previous consignment has been digested. 
And by abandoning even licit actions as it is commanded, it will acquire the 
ability to listen to the commands of the Shari‘a and the reason, and so to 
avoid illicit actions. It will try not to destroy his spiritual life.

Moreover, the great majority of mankind frequently suffer from hunger. 
Man, therefore, needs hunger and discipline, which train him to be patient 
and forbearing. Fasting in Ramadan is patient endurance of a period of hun-
ger that continues for ﬁfteen hours, or for twenty-four if the pre-dawn meal 
is not eaten, and it is a discipline and training. That is to say, fasting is also 
a cure for impatience and lack of endurance, which double man’s afﬂictions.
Futhermore, the factory of the stomach has many workers, and many of 
the human organs are connected to it. If the instinctual soul does not take a 
rest from activity during the day for a month, it makes the factory’s workers 
and those organs forget their particular duties; it busies them with itself so 
that they remain under its tyranny. Also, it confuses the rest of the organs in 
the human body with the clangour and steam of the factory’s machinery. It 
continuously attracts their attention to itself, making them temporarily for-
get their exalted duties. It is because of this that for centuries those closest to 
Allah have accustomed themselves to discipline and to eating and drinking 
little in order to be perfected.

Through fasting in Ramadan the factory’s workers understand that they 
were not created for the factory only. While the rest of the organs, instead of 
delighting in the lowly amusements of the factory, take pleasure in angelic 
and spiritual amusements, and ﬁx their gazes on them. It is for this reason 

478

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

that  in  Ramadan  the  believers  experience  enlightenment,  fruitfulness,  and 
spiritual joys which differ according to their degrees. Their subtle faculties, 
such as the heart, spirit, and intellect, make great progress and advancement 
in that blessed month through fasting. They laugh with innocent joy inspite 
of the stomach’s weeping.

Ninth Point

Ninth Point

One  of  the  instances  of  wisdom  in  fasting  in  Ramadan  with  regard  to 
shattering the instinctual soul’s imaginary dominicality and making known 
its worship through pointing out its impotence is as follows:

The instinctual soul does not want to recognize its Sustainer; it wants its 
own lordship, like Pharaoh. However much torment it suffers, it retains that 
vein. Hunger, however, destroys it. Hence, fasting in Ramadan strikes direct 
blows at the soul’s pharaoh-like front, shattering it. It demonstrates its impo-
tence, weakness, and want. It makes it realize that it is a slave.

Among the narrations of Hadith is the following: “ Allah Almighty said 
to the instinctual soul: ‘What am I and what are you?’ The soul replied: ‘I 
am myself and You are Yourself.’ So He punished it and cast it into Hell, 
then asked it again. Again it replied: ‘I am myself and You are Yourself.’ 
However He punished it, it did not give up its egoism. Finally He punished it 
with hunger; that is, He made it go hungry. Then again He asked it: ‘Who am 
I and who are you?’ And the soul replied: ُز ِ(cid:106)اَ(cid:151)ْ(cid:170)ا  َكُدْ(cid:93)َ(cid:150) اَ(cid:178)َاَو  *  ُم(cid:193) ِ(cid:110)َ

APOLOGY:  This  Second  Section  was  written  at  speed  when  both  myself  and  the 
rough-copy scribe were ill; it is bound therefore to contain disorder and defects. We await 
from our brothers that they look on it with tolerance. They may correct it as they think ﬁt.

The Third Section,
which is the Third Treatise

[ I wrote this section in order to present an important intention of mine 
to my brothers of the hereafter for their consideration. It concerns the 
writing  of  a  Qur’an  in  a  way  that  will  show  one  of  the  two  hundred 
sorts of the Qur’an of Miraculous Exposition’s miraculousness – a sort 
pertaining to its patterns – with the pages speciﬁed in accordance with 
the style of Hafız Osman and taking the M u d ā y a n a  Verse ( 2:282 ) as the 
measure, and taking Sura al-Ikhlas as the standard for the lines. This 
Third  Section,  which  I  wrote  to  consult  them  concerning  this  matter 
and to learn their ideas, and also as a reminder to myself, consists of 
nine matters. ] 

First Matter

FIRST MATTER

It is established with proofs in the Twenty-Fifth Word, called T h e   M i r a c -
u l o u s n e s s   o f   t h e   Q u r ’ a n , that the varieties of the Qur’an of Mighty Stature’s 
miraculousness number forty. Some of these are demonstrated in detail, and 
some brieﬂy, so as to convince even the obdurate. Also, the different sorts of 
miraculousness the Qur’an shows to each of forty of the classes of human-
ity were explained in the Eighteenth Sign of the Nineteenth Letter, and the 
shares received by ten of those groups were proved. The remaining thirty 
classes consist of the followers of all the different ways of sainthood and the 
scholars of all the various sciences, who demonstrated their certain, veriﬁed 
belief to the degrees of knowledge of certainty, vision of certainty, and abso-
lute certainty that the Qur’an is the true Word of Allah. That is to say, each 
of them discerned a different aspect of its miraculousness in a different way. 
Yes, just as the miraculousness a saint who seeks knowledge of Allah under-
stands will not the same as the beauty of the miraculousness a saint who is 
a lover of Allah witnesses, so the manifestations of the beauty of its miracu-
lousness vary according to the different ways and paths. And the aspect of 
miraculousness a profound scholar of the principles of religion sees will not 
be the same as that seen by an authoritative interpreter of the secondary mat-
ters of the Shari‘a sees; and so on. I am not able to show in detail all these 
different aspects; my comprehension cannot encompass them; my view falls 
short of them. For this reason only ten classes were explained and the rest 

479

480

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

were alluded to brieﬂy. Now, of those, two that were inadequately described 
in T h e   M i r a c l e s   o f   M u h a m m a d  although they needed to be elucidated, were 
the following:

The First Class is the uneducated mass of people, whom we call “ the 
listening  class; ”  they  only  listen  to  the  Qur’an,  understanding  its  miracu-
lousness by means of their ears. They say: “ The Qur’an, which I hear, does 
not resemble any other books, so it must either be inferior to all of them, or 
superior. No one could say that it is inferior, nor have they said it, nor could 
the Devil even say it. So it must be superior to all of them. ” It was written 
brieﬂy like this in the Eighteenth Sign and is further explained in the First 
Topic of the Twenty-Sixth Letter, called  A   D i s p u t e   w i t h   t h e   D e v i l , which 
illustrates and proves that class’s understanding of the miraculousness.

The Second Class is “ the seeing class. ” That is to say, it is claimed in the 
Eighteenth Sign that an aspect of the Qur’an’s miraculousness which may be 
seen with the eyes looks to the uneducated common people or to materialists 
whose minds see no further than their eyes. This claim needs much explana-
tion in order to elucidate and prove it. It was not explained there due to an 
important  instance  of  dominical  wisdom  which  only  now  we  understand. 
Only a few very minor particulars were pointed out. The wisdom in in this 
is now understood and we are certain its postponement was preferable. In 
order to facilitate this class’s understanding, we had a Qur’an written that 
shows this observable aspect, one of the forty aspects of its miraculousness.

[ The remaining matters of this Third Section together with the Fourth 
Section are about coincidences ( t e v â f u k a t  ). They have been included 
in the Index and not repeated here. Included here are only a reminder 
concerning the Fourth Section and its Third Point. ]

Reminder: One hundred and sixty verses were written in explanation of 
the important point concerning the word “ Messenger. ” In addition to these 
verses having a glorious quality, they form a Qur’anic supplication for those 
who want to memorize or recite different verses, since they prove and com-
plete one another with regard to the meaning and their meanings are very 
profound. In degree, the eloquence and beauty of the sixty-nine verses in the 
explanation of the sublime point concerning the word “ Qur’an ” is also most 
wondrous and elevated. This may be recommended to our brothers as a sec-
ond Qur’anic supplication. In regard to the word “ Qur’an, ” it was present in 
the seven lines of the word, which included all of them with the exception 
of two, and since these latter had the meaning of  q i r a ’ a t , their remaining 
outside the pattern strengthened the point. As for the word “ Messenger, ” 

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – THIRD SECTION

481

since the Suras most connected with the word are Sura Muhammad and Sura 
al-Fath, and since we limited it to the lines of the word appearing in those 
two Suras, the instances of the word outside those have not been included. 
If time permits, the mysteries these hold will be explained, Allah willing.

The Third Point consists of four points.

First Point

The  word  “ Allah ”  is  mentioned  two  thousand  eight  hundred  and  six 
times.  Including  in  the  B i s m i l l a h ’s  ( In  the  Name  of  Allah’s ),  the  word 
“ Merciful  ( R a ḥ m ā n  ) ”  one  hundred  and  ﬁfty-nine;  “ Compassionate 
( R a ḥ ī m  ), ”  two  hundred  and  twenty;  “ Forgiving  ( G h a f ū r  ), ”  sixty-one; 
“ Sustainer ( R a b b  ), ” eight hundred and forty-six; “ Wise ( Ḥ a k ī m  ), ” eighty-
six; “ Knowing ( ‘ A l ī m  ), ” one hundred and twenty-six; “ Powerful ( Q a d ī r  ), ” 
thirty-one; the “ He ( H ū  ) ” in “ There is no god but He, ” twenty-six times. 1 
The number of times the word “ Allah ” is repeated contains many mysteries 
and subtle points. For instance, the number of times “ Merciful, ” “ Compas-
sionate, ”  “ Forgiving, ”  and  “ Wise, ”  which  are  the  most  mentioned  after 
“ Allah ” and “ Sustainer, ” are repeated together with the word “ Allah, ” is 
equal to half the number of the Qur’an’s verses. And repetitions of “ Allah, ” 
together with “ Sustainer, ” which is mentioned instead of the word “ Allah, ” 
again equal half the number of the Qur’an’s verses. The word “ Sustainer ” 
is mentioned eight hundred and forty-six times, but if these are studied care-
fully, it will be seen that around ﬁve hundred of them are mentioned in place 
of the word “ Allah, ” while around two hundred are not.

Also,  repetitions  of  “ Allah ”  together  with  “ Merciful, ”  “ Compassion-
ate, ” “ Knowing, ” and the “ He ” of the phrase “ There is no god but He ” 
are again equal in number to half of the verses; the difference is only four. 
And together with “ All-Powerful ” instead of “ He, ” they again equal half 
the number of verses; the difference here is nine. There are numerous subtle 
points in the total number of time the word “ Allah, ” but for now we deem 
this point to be sufﬁcient.

Second Point

This is in respect of the Suras, and it too contains many subtle points. It 
contains coincidences ( t e v â f u k a t  ) in a way that points to an order, intention, 
and will.

1.  An important mystery is indicated by the total number of the Qur’an’s verses be-
ing six thousand six hundred and sixty-six, and on the eighty-ninth page here the above-
mentioned number of divine names being connected with the number six, but it has been 
left aside for now.

482

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

In Sura al-Baqara, the number of instances of the word “ Allah ” and the 
number  of  the  verses  is  the  same.  There  is  a  difference  of  four,  but  four 
“ He’s ” replace the word “ Allah, ” like the “ He ” in “ There is no god but 
He ”  and  they  correspond  exactly.  In  Sura  Al-i  ‘Imran,  again  the  word 
“ Allah ” and the number of verses coincide and are equal. Only, “ Allah ” 
is mentioned two hundred and nine times and there are two hundred verses, 
making a difference of nine. But small differences do not mar the ﬁne points 
of eloquence and literary merits such as these; an approximate coincidence 
is enough. The total number of verses of Suras al-Nisa, al-Ma’ida, and al-
An‘am coincides with the total number of instances of the word “ Allah: ” 
the  number  of  verses  is  four  hundred  and  sixty-four,  and  the  number  of 
instances of the word “ Allah ” four hundred and sixty-one; with the “ Allah ” 
of the B i s m i l l a h s , it coincides exactly.

And for example, the number of instances of the word “ Allah ” in the ﬁrst 
ﬁve Suras is twice the number of the word in Suras al-A‘raf, al-Anfal, al-
Tawba, Yunus, and Hud. That is, the second ﬁve are half the ﬁrst ﬁve. Then 
the number of instances of the word in the following suras, Yusuf, al-Ra‘d, 
Ibrahim, al-Hijr, and al-Nahl, is half that, and in the following Suras, al-Isra, 
al-Kahf, Maryam, Ta. Ha., al-Anbiya, and al-Hajj, it is again halved. 1 And 
so it continues to decrease in approximately the same ratio in the following 
groups of ﬁve Suras. There are, however, some differences and deﬁciencies 
but they cause no harm in such stations of address. For example, some are 
one hundred and twenty-one, others are one hundred and twenty-ﬁve, others 
are one hundred and ﬁfty-four, and yet others are one hundred and ﬁfty-nine. 
Then, the ﬁve Suras which begin with Sura al-Zukhruf decrease to an eighth. 
And in the ﬁve beginning with Sura al-Najm, it is a sixty-fourth, but this 
is approximate. Differences arising from small errors do not harm stations 
of address such as these. The subsequent three groups of ﬁve short Suras 
contain only three instances each of the word “ Allah. ” And this shows that 
chance has not interfered at all in the number of the word; the numbers of it 
have been speciﬁed in accordance with wisdom and order.

The Third Point is about the word “ Allah ”

This concerns its relation to the pages and is as follows:
The number of instances of the word on one page looks to that page’s 
reverse side, and that page sometimes looks to its facing page, and sometimes 

1.  A mystery was unfolded through this division into ﬁves. With not one of us be-
ing aware of it, six suras were written here. We have no doubt that outside our wills, and 
from the Unseen, the sixth was added here so that the important mystery concerning these 
halves should not be lost.

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – THIRD SECTION

483

to the left-hand facing page and to the reverse face of the facing page. I stud-
ied  a  coincidence  in  my  own  copy  of  the  Qur’an  and  observed  what  was 
generally  a  very  ﬁne  numerical  relationship.  I  marked  them  in  my  copy. 
Very often they are equal, and sometimes they are a half or a third. Their 
positioning tells of a wisdom, purpose, and order.

Fourth Point

This  concerns  coincidences  on  a  single  page.  My  brothers  and  I  com-
pared three or four different copies and we came to the conclusion that the 
coincidences  were  intended  in  all  of  them.  However,  since  copyists  for 
printed copies had different aims in view, the coincidences lost their order 
to a degree. But if they were set in order, coincidences would become appar-
ent to the number of the two thousand eight hundred and six instances of 
the word Allah in the whole Qur’an with only rare exceptions. A light of 
miraculousness shines in this, because the human mind could not encompass 
a page as extensive as this and interfere in it. And the hand of chance could 
not reach up to such a situation, so full of meaning and wisdom.

We are having a new Qur’an written in order to demonstrate this Fourth 
Point to a degree, which together with preserving the pages and lines of the 
most widely used copies of the Qur’an, will set in order the places that have 
lost their order due to the slackness of calligraphers, and will display the true 
order of the coincidences, Allah willing. Indeed, it was displayed.

While in a spiritual state during the month of Ramadan, I perceived one 
light of the many luminous mysteries of this light-ﬁlled verse; I saw it as 
though from afar. It was like this:

I had a vision of the heart and imagination which afforded me the convic-

tion that, as in the famous supplication of Uways al-Qarani,

all living creatures are offering supplications to Almighty Allah, and that a 
divine name illuminates each of the eighteen thousand worlds. It was like 
this:

I saw that within this world are thousands of worlds enwrapped in veil 
after veil, one within the other like a rose-bud with numerous petals. As each 
veil was unfolded I saw another world. It was like that depicted by the verse 
following the Light Verse:

it appeared to me in darkness, desolation, and terrible blackness. Suddenly, 
the manifestation of a divine name appeared like a refulgent light, illuminat-
ing it. Whichever veil was folded back another world appeared before my 
mind. But while appearing dark due to heedlessness, a divine name would 
be manifested like the sun, ﬁlling that world with light from top to bottom. 
And so on. This journey of the heart and imagination continued for a long 
time. In short:

When I saw the animal world it appeared to me as truly dark and grievous 
due to the animals’ endless needs and acute hunger, and their weakness and 
impotence. Then suddenly the name of Most Merciful rose like the shining 
sun in the sign of ( that is, meaning ) Provider, gilding that world from top to 
bottom with the radiance of its mercy.

Then within the animal world I beheld another world in which young and 
offspring were struggling in their weakness, helplessness, and need within 
a grievous darkness that would ﬁll anyone with pity. Suddenly the name of 
All-Compassionate rose in the sign of clemency, illuminating that world in 
so beautiful and sweet a fashion that it transformed the complaint, pity, and 
tears of sorrow into joy, happiness, and tears of pleasurable thanks. 

Then a further veil was lifted, as though revealing a cinema screen, and 
the world of man appeared to me. But it appeared to be so dark, so oppres-
sive, so terrible that in anguish I cried out “ Alas! ” For I saw that men had 
desires and hopes that stretched to eternity, and thoughts and imaginings that 
encompassed the universe, and a disposition and abilities that most earnestly 
yearned for eternity and everlasting happiness and Paradise, and wants and 
needs  that  were  directed  towards  endless  goals  and  aims.  Yet  they  were 
weak and impotent, and exposed to the attacks of innumerable calamities 
and  enemies;  they  lived  tumultuous  lives  for  a  brief  span  in  the  greatest 
hardship  and  difﬁculties.  Amid  the  continuous  tribulations  of  decline  and 
separation, a most grievous state for the heart, they were looking towards the 
grave, which for the heedless and neglectful is the door to everlasting dark-
ness; singly and in groups, they were being cast into that dark well.

The  moment  I  saw  this  world  in  the  midst  of  the  darkness,  my  heart, 
spirit,  and  mind,  and  all  my  human  faculties,  indeed,  all  the  particles  of 
my being, were ready to weep and cry out in pain. But suddenly Almighty 
Allah’s  name  of  All-Just  rose  in  the  sign  of  All-Wise,  the  name  of  Most 
Merciful rose in the sign of Muniﬁcent, the name of All-Compassionate rose 
in the sign of ( that is, meaning ) All-Forgiving, the name of Resurrector in 
the sign of Inheritor, the name of Giver of Life rose in the sign of Bountiful, 
and the name of Sustainer rose in the sign of Owner. They gilded and ﬁlled 
with light many worlds within the world of humanity. Opening up windows 
onto the luminous world of the hereafter, they scattered lights over the dark 
human world.

Then  another,  vast,  veil  was  folded  back  and  the  world  of  the  earth 
appeared.  Philosophy’s  dark  laws  of  science  showed  a  terrifying  world 
to  the  imagination.  The  situation  appeared  to  me  of  wretched  humankind

journeying through inﬁnite space on the aged earth, which covers in one year 
a distance of twenty-ﬁve thousand years moving seventy times faster than 
a cannon-ball, and whose inside is in a state of upheaval ever ready to split 
up and disintegrate. My head started spinning and my eyes darkened. Then 
suddenly the names of Creator of the Heavens and the Earth, All-Powerful, 
All-Knowing, Sustainer, Allah, Sustainer of the Heavens and the Earth, and 
Subduer of the Sun and Moon rose in the signs of Mercy, Tremendousness, 
and dominicality. They illuminated that world so that I saw the globe of the 
earth to be a safe liner, well-ordered, subjugated, perfect, and agreeable, all 
decked out for voyages of pleasure and trade.

In Short: Each of the thousand and one divine names turned towards the 
universe appeared like a sun, illuminating a world and the worlds within that 
world, and with respect to divine oneness ( e h a d i y e t  ), within the manifesta-
tion of each of them the manifestations of the rest of the names appeared to 
a degree. Then my heart espied a different light behind all the darknesses 
and felt an appetite for travel. It wanted to mount the imagination and rise to 
the heavens. At that point, a further, most extensive, veil was folded back, 
and my heart entered the world of the heavens. It saw that the stars larger 
than the earth, which appeared as twinkling smiles, were spinning and jour-
neying faster than the earth one within the other. If any of them confused 
its  motion  it  would  clash  with  another  causing  such  a  blast  the  universe 
would explode causing the whole world to fall apart. They were scattering 
ﬁre, not light, and were regarding me not with smiles, but with savagery. 
I  saw  the  heavens  within  endless,  all-enveloping,  empty,  awesome,  terri-
fying  darkness.  I  was  sorry  a  thousand  times  over  that  I  had  come.  Sud-

lamps. The heavens too, which had seemed empty and uninhabited, ﬁlled 
with angels and spirit beings. I saw that the suns and moons, which were 
in motion like an army of the Monarch of Pre-Eternity and Post-Eternity – 
one of His innumerable armies – were with their lofty manoeuvres display-
ing the majesty and magniﬁcent dominicality of that All-Glorious Sultan. I 
declared with all my strength, and had it been possible with all the particles

( 11:113 ) m l k j i h g
Allah willing, this Sixth Section will confound six stratagems of satans 

among jinn and men, and block up six of their ways of attack.

First Stratagem

FIRST STRATAGEM

In consequence of the instruction they have received from satans among 
the jinn, human satans want to deceive, by exciting the desire for rank and 
position,  the  self-sacriﬁcing  servants  of  the  party  of  the  Qur’an,  and  to 
make them give up their sacred service and elevated j i h a d  of the word. It 
is as follows:

Present in most people is a hypocritical desire to be seen by people and 
hold a position in the public view, which is ambition for fame and acclaim, 
and self-advertisement; it is present to a lesser or greater extent in all those 
who  seek  this  world.  The  desire  to  accomplish  this  ambition  will  drive  a 
person to sacriﬁce his life even. Such ambition is exceedingly dangerous for 
those who seek the hereafter, and even for those who seek this world it is a 
rough road. It is also the source of many bad morals and is man’s greatest 
weakness. A person only has to gratify this ambition to gain control over 
someone and draw him to himself; it ties the man to him, and he is over-
come. My greatest fear for my brothers is that the atheists may take advan-
tage of this weak vein of theirs. It has caused me much thought. For they did 
attract in this way some unfortunates who were not truly friends, drawing 
them into a dangerous situation. 1

1.  Those unfortunates think: “ Our hearts are together with Ustad, ” and suppose them-
selves to be in no danger. But someone who gives support to the atheists’ movement and 
is carried away by their propaganda, and perhaps unknowingly is used in spying activities, 
says: “ My heart is pure and loyal to Ustad’s way, ” resembles the following example: ==

488

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – SIXTH SECTION

489

My brothers and friends in the service of the Qur’an! Say the following 
to the secret agents of the cunning ‘worldly,’ or the propagandists of the 
people of misguidance, or the students of Satan, for they all try to deceive 
you by exciting the desire for rank: “ Firstly, divine pleasure, the favours 
of the Merciful One, and dominical acceptance are a position so high that 
beside them the attention and admiration of men are worth virtually noth-
ing. To receive divine mercy is sufﬁcient. The regard of men is acceptable 
in that it is the reﬂection and shadow of the regard of divine mercy; other-
wise it is not desirable. For it is extinguished at the door of the grave, so 
is worth nothing! ”

If the desire for rank and position cannot be silenced and eliminated, it 
should be directed towards something else: as in the following comparison, 
the emotion may have a licit side; if it is for reward in the hereafter, or with 
the intention of being prayed for, or for making one’s work effective.

For example, at a time Aya Sophia Mosque is ﬁlled with eminent and 
blessed people, virtuous and excellent, one or two idle youths and immoral 
loafers are hanging around the entrance, while next to the windows a few 
Europeans are watching for amusement. A man enters the mosque and joins 
the  congregation,  then  recites  a  passage  from  the  Qur’an  beautifully  in  a 
ﬁne voice; the gazes of thousands of the people of truth are turned on him 
and they gain reward for him through their regard and prayers. This does 
not please the idle youths and heretic loafers and the one or two Europeans. 
If when the man had entered the blessed mosque and joined the huge con-
gregation, he had shouted out lewd songs, and danced and jumped around, 
it would have made the idle youths laugh, have pleased the dissolute loaf-
ers since it encouraged immorality, and made the Europeans smile mock-
ingly, since they are gratiﬁed at seeing any faults in Islam. But it would have 
attracted looks of disgust and contempt from the vast and blessed congrega-
tion; in its view, the man would have fallen to the very lowest of the low.

Exactly like this example, the World of Islam and Asia is a huge mosque, 
and the people of belief and truth within it are the respected congregation 
in the mosque. The idle youths are the childish sycophants. The dissolute 
loafers are those villains who follow Europe and have no nation or religion. 
While the European spectators are the journalists who spread the ideas of the 
Europeans. All Muslims, especially the virtuous and perfected ones, have a 

== while performing the obligatory prayers, a person cannot hold his wind and expels it, 
and his prayer is invalidated. When he is told that his prayers are invalid, he replies: “ Why 
should they be? My heart is pure. ”

place in the mosque according to their degree; they are seen and attention is 
paid to them. If they perform actions and works as taught by the injunctions 
and sacred truths the All-Wise Qur’an in accordance with the sincerity and 
divine pleasure which are a fundamental of Islam, and if through the tongue 
of disposition they recite Qur’anic verses, they will then be included in the 
ّ(cid:171)(cid:170)َا which is constantly uttered by every-
prayer:  ِتاَ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174)ْؤُ(cid:175)ْ(cid:170)اَو  َنـ(cid:193)ِ(cid:179)ِ(cid:174)ْؤُ(cid:175)ْ(cid:171)ِ(cid:170) ْرِ(cid:159)ْ(cid:154)ا َ
one in the World of Islam. They will have a share of it and will become con-
nected to all the others in brotherly fashion. However, the value of this will 
not be apparent to some of the people of misguidance who are like harmful 
beasts and to some idiots who are like bearded children. If a man disowns all 
his forefathers, the source of honour, and all the past, the cause of pride, and 
abandons in the spirit the luminous highway of his righteous predecessors, 
which they considered to be their point of support, and if he follows his own 
whims and passions hypocritically seeking fame and following innovations, 
he will fall to the very lowest position in the view of all the people of truth 
ّ(cid:195)ا ِروُ(cid:179)ِ(cid:92) ُرُ(cid:147)ْ(cid:179)َ(cid:192) ُهَ

common and ignorant a believer may be, even if his mind does not realize it, 
his heart looks coldly and in disgust on such boastful, selﬁsh men.

And so, the man carried away by love of position and rank and obsessed 
by the desire for fame – the second man, descends to the very lowest of the 
low in the view of that numberless congregation. And he gains a temporary, 
inauspicious  position  in  the  view  of  a  few  insigniﬁcant,  mocking,  raving 
loafers. In accordance with the verse, 

( 43:67 ) r q p o n m l
he will ﬁnd a few false friends who will be harmful in this world, torment in 
the Intermediate Realm, and enemies in the hereafter. 

As for the ﬁrst man, even if he does not expunge the desire for position 
from  his  heart,  on  condition  he  takes  sincerity  and  divine  pleasure  as  his 
guiding  principles  and  does  not  make  rank  and  position  his  goal,  he  will 
attain a sort of spiritual rank, and a glorious one at that, which will perfectly 
satisfy  that  desire  of  his.  The  man  will  lose  something  insigniﬁcant,  very 
insigniﬁcant, and ﬁnd in place of it many, very many, valuable and harmless 
things. Indeed, he will chase away a few snakes and ﬁnd numerous blessed

creatures; he will become close friends with them. Or he will ward off sting-
ing wild hornets and attract blessed bees, the sherbert-sellers of mercy. He 
will eat honey at their hand, and through their prayers ﬁnd friends from all 
parts of the Islamic world through whom his spirit will receive effulgences 
like the water of Kawthar, and these will pass to his book of good deeds.

At one time, when through perpetrating a great wrong due to the desire 
for fame, a little man who was occupying a high worldly position became 
a laughing-stock in the eyes of the World of Islam, I spoke to him teaching 
him the meaning of the above comparison; I hit him over the head with it. He 
was badly shaken, but because I myself had not been saved from the desire 
for rank and position, my warning did not arouse him.

Second Stratagem

SECOND STRATAGEM

One of the strongest and most basic emotions in man is the sense of fear. 
Scheming oppressors proﬁt greatly from the vein of fear. They restrain the 
pusillanimous with it. The agents of the worldly and propagandists of the 
people of misguidance take advantage of this vein of the common people 
and  of  the  religious  scholars  in  particular.  They  frighten  them  and  excite 
their groundless fears. For example, in order to scare a coward who is on a 
roof and put him in danger, a scheming man shows him something which 
he supposes is harmful; he excites his fear and draws him gradually towards 
the edge of the roof; then he makes him fall and break his neck. In exactly 
the same way, they make people sacriﬁce most important things due to most 
unimportant fears. Trying to avoid a mosquito bite, they ﬂee into the drag-
on’s mouth.

One  time,  an  eminent  person  –  May  Allah  have  mercy  on  him  –  was 
frightened of climbing into a rowing-boat. One evening, we walked together 
to the Bridge in Istanbul. We had to board a boat; there was no carriage and 
we  were  going  to  Eyüp  Sultan.  I  insisted.  He  said:  “ I’m  frightened.  Per-
haps it’ll sink! ” I said to him: “ How many boats do you reckon there are, 
here on the Golden Horn? ” He replied: “ Perhaps a thousand. ” So I asked 
him:  “ How  many  boats  sink  in  a  year? ”  He  said:  “ One  or  two.  Perhaps 
none at all. ” I asked him: “ How many days are there in a year? ” “ Three 
hundred and sixty, ” he replied. So I said to him: “ The possibility of sink-
ing, which provokes these groundless fears and makes you anxious, is one 
in three hundred and sixty thousand. Someone who is frightened at such a 
possibility is not a human being, he couldn’t even be an animal! ” Then I 
asked him: “ How long do you reckon you will live? ” He replied: “ I am old; 

492

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

perhaps I’ll live another ten years. ” So I said to him: “ The appointed hour 
of death is secret, so we could die any day. In which case, you might die on 
any day of the three thousand six hundred. You see, there is a one in three 
thousand possibility that you might die today rather than one in three hun-
dred thousand like the boat; so tremble and weep, and write your will! ” He 
came to his senses, and I got him, trembling, to board the boat. When on 
board, I told him: “ Almighty Allah gave the sense of fear to preserve life, 
not to destroy it! He did not give life so that it would be burdensome, dif-
ﬁcult, painful, and torment. If fear is caused by a possibility of one in two, 
three, or four, or even one in ﬁve or six, it is a precautionary fear and may be 
licit. But to fear a possibility of one in twenty, thirty, or forty, is groundless, 
and makes life torture! ”

My brothers! If those who toady to the atheists attack you by frightening 
you into giving up your sacred j i h a d  of the word, say to them: “ We are the 
party of the Qur’an. According to the verse,

we are in the citadel of the Qur’an. The verse,

 ( 15:9 ) m l k j i h g

( 3:173 ) Ø × Ö Õ
is a ﬁrm bastion surrounding us. Utilizing fear at a one in thousands possibil-
ity of some minor harm coming to our ﬂeeting transient lives here, you can-
not drive us through our own wills down a way on which there is a hundred 
per cent possibility of its causing thousandfold harm to our eternal lives! ” 
And say too: “ Is there anyone who has suffered harm due to Said Nursi, our 
friend in the service of the Qur’an and Master and foreman in running this 
sacred work, or from people of truth like us who are his companions on the 
way of truth? Is there anyone who has been caused any trouble at the hand 
of his close students, that we might be caused it too? So should we be anx-
ious at the possibility of suffering it? This brother of ours has thousands of 
friends and brothers of the hereafter. Although for twenty to thirty years he 
played an inﬂuential role in the social life of this world, we have not heard 
that a single of his brothers suffered harm because of him, and at that time 
he was brandishing the club of politics. Now he holds the light of reality 
rather than the club. For sure, long ago they mixed him up in the Thirty-First 
of March Incident and they crushed some of his friends, but it later became 
clear that others had instigated the affair. His friends suffered misfortune, 
not because of him but because of his enemies. Moreover, at that time he 
saved very many of his friends. So satans like you shouldn’t get it into their 

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – SIXTH SECTION

493

minds to make us throw away an eternal treasury out of fear at a danger the 
possibility of which is not one in a thousand but in thousands. ” You should 
say that and hit those toadies of the people of misguidance in the mouth, and 
drive them away! And tell them this:

“ And if the possibility of death is not one in hundreds of thousands but 
a  hundred  per  cent  probability,  if  we  have  a  jot  of  sense,  we  will  not  be 
frightened and abandon him and ﬂee! ” For it has been seen through repeated 
experiences, and it is seen, that the calamity which is visited on those who 
betray  their  elder  brother  or  their  Master  in  times  of  danger,  strikes  them 
ﬁrst. And they are punished mercilessly and they are looked down upon con-
temptuously. Both physically dead and their spirits abased, they are in effect 
dead. Those who torment them feel no pity for them, for they say: “ Since 
they betrayed their Master who was loyal and kind to them, they must be 
completely despicable and deserve contempt, not pity! ”

Yes, the reality is this. Also, if a tyrannical, unscrupulous man throws 
someone to the ground and stands over him certain to crush his head with 
his foot, and the man on the ground kisses that savage oppressor’s foot, due 
to his abasement his heart will be crushed before his head, and his spirit will 
die  before  his  body.  He  will  lose  his  head,  and  his  self-respect  and  pride 
will be destroyed. By displaying weakness before the savage tyrant without 
conscience, he encourages him to crush him. But if the oppressed man spits 
in the tyrant’s face, he will save his heart and his spirit, and his body will be 
a wronged martyr. Yes, spit in the shameless faces of the oppressors!

One time when the British had destroyed the guns on the Bosphorus and 
occupied  Istanbul,  the  head  clergyman  of  the  Anglican  Church,  the  main 
religious establishment of that country, asked six questions of the Shaikh al-
Islam’s Ofﬁce. I was a member of the Darü’l-Hikmeti’l-Islamiye at the time. 
They asked me to answer them, saying that they wanted a six-hundred-word 
reply to their six questions. But I told them: “ I’ll answer them not with six 
hundred words, or even with six words, or even a single word, but with a 
mouthful of spit! For you can see that government; the moment it set foot on 
our Bosphorus, its clergyman arrogantly asked us six questions. Faced with 
this, we should spit in his face. So spit in the pitiless faces of those tyrants! ” 
And now I say:

My  brothers!  At  a  time  a  tyrannical  government  like  the  British  had 
occupied us the protection of the Qur’an was enough for me, although it 
was a hundred per cent certain that harm would come to me from confront-
ing them in this way through the tongue of the press, so it is deﬁnitely a 

494

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

hundred  times  more  sufﬁcient  for  you  in  the  face  of  the  harm  that  may 
come to you at the hand of these insigniﬁcant bullies, which is only a one 
in a hundred possibility.

Furthermore, my brothers! Most of you have done your military service. 
Any  who  haven’t,  have  certainly  heard  this.  And  any  who  haven’t  heard 
it, let them hear it now from me: “ The people who receive most wounds 
are those who abandon their trenches and run away. While the people who 
receive fewest wounds are those who persevere in their trenches! ”

The allusive meaning of the verse,

( 62:8 ) » º ¹ ¸ ¶ μ ´ ³
shows that those who run away are more likely to meet death through their 
ﬂight!

Third Satanic Stratagem

THIRD SATANIC STRATAGEM

They hunt many people through greed.
We have proved in many treatises with certain proofs that have issued 
forth  from  the  clear  verses  of  the  All-Wise  Qur’an  that  licit  sustenance 
comes not in accordance with power and will, but proportionately to pow-
erlessness and want. There are numerous signs, indications, and evidences 
demonstrating this truth. For instance:

Trees, which are animate beings of a sort and in need of sustenance, remain 
in their places and their sustenance comes hastening to them. While since ani-
mals chase after it greedily, they are not nurtured as perfectly as trees.

Also, although ﬁshes are the most stupid and powerless of the animals 
and are found in sand, their being the best nourished and generally appear-
ing fat while intelligent and capable animals like the monkey and fox are 
weak and thin from their scanty sustenance, shows that need is the means of 
sustenance, not power.

Also,  the  ﬁne  sustenance  of  all  young,  whether  human  or  animal,  and 
milk, the delicate gift of the treasury of mercy, being bestowed on them in an 
unexpected way out of compassion for their weakness and impotence, and 
the difﬁcult circumstances of wild animals, show that impotence and want 
are the means of licit sustenance rather than intelligence and power.

Also, among the nations of the world there are some that pursue suste-
nance more than others and are notorious for their greed. But these nations 
have suffered more than any from poor livelihoods, degradation and poverty. 
Even the rich among them live in lowly fashion. In any event, the possessions 

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – SIXTH SECTION

495

they have acquired by such illicit means as usury do not comprise licit suste-
nance that it might refute our discussion here. Also, the poverty of many lit-
erary ﬁgures and scholars, and the wealth and riches of many stupid people 
show that the means of attracting sustenance is not intelligence and power, 
but impotence and want; it is submitting to Allah while relying on Him, and 
supplication by word, state, and deed.

The verse,   Z Y X W V U T( 51:58 )  proclaims this truth, and 
is a powerful, ﬁrm proof of this assertion of ours, which all plants and ani-
mals and young recite. Every group of creature that seeks sustenance recites 
this verse through the tongue of disposition.

Since  sustenance  is  appointed  and  bestowed  and  it  is  Almighty  Allah 
who gives it, and since He is both All-Compassionate and Muniﬁcent, those 
who  degrade  themselves  by  making  illicit  gains  in  such  a  way  as  to  cast 
aspersions  on  His  mercy  and  insult  His  muniﬁcence,  and  give  their  con-
sciences and even certain sacred matters as bribes and accept things which 
are  unlawful  and  inauspicious  –  they  should  ponder  over  just  what  com-
pounded lunacy this is.

Yes, ‘the worldly’ and especially the people of misguidance do not give 
away  their  money  cheaply;  they  sell  it  at  a  high  price.  Sometimes  some-
thing which may help a little towards a year of worldly life is the means of 
destroying inﬁnite eternal life. And with that vile greed, the person draws 
divine  wrath  on  himself  and  tries  to  attract  the  pleasure  of  the  people  of 
misguidance.

Yes, my brothers! If those who toady to ‘the worldly’ and the dissem-
blers among the misguided lay hold of you due to this weak vein in human 
nature,  think  of  the  above  truth  and  take  this  poor  brother  of  yours  as  an 
example. I assure you with all my strength that contentment and frugality 
ensure your life and sustenance more than does a salary. As for any unlaw-
ful money that is given you, they will want a price a thousand times higher 
in return. It may also hinder your service of the Qur’an, which may open for 
you an everlasting treasury, or it may make you slack in that service. And 
that would be such a loss and emptiness that even if they gave you a thou-
sand salaries every month, they could not ﬁll its place.

Warning: The people of misguidance are not able to defend themselves 
and reply to the truths of belief and the Qur’an which we take from the All-
Wise Qur’an and disseminate, therefore, through intrigue and dissembling 
they employ snares of deception and wile. They want to deceive my friends 

496

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

through the desire for position, greed, and fear, and to refute me by ascrib-
ing certain things to me. We always act positively in our sacred service, but 
unfortunately, sometimes the duty of removing the obstacles in the way of 
some good matter impels us to act negatively.

It is because of this that I am warning my brothers concerning the above-
mentioned three points, in the face of the cunning propaganda of the dissem-
blers. I am trying to rebuff the attacks that are levelled at them.

The most signiﬁcant attack now is at my person. They say: “ Said is a 
Kurd. Why do you show him so much respect, and follow him? ” So I am 
forced to mention the fourth satanic stratagem in the language of the Old 
Said although I do not want to, in order to silence such villains.

Fourth Satanic Stratagem

FOURTH SATANIC STRATAGEM

In  order  to  deceive  my  brothers  and  excite  their  nationalist  feelings, 
certain  irreligious  people  who  occupy  high  positions  attack  me  with  their 
propaganda. At the promptings of Satan and suggestions of the people of 
misguidance,  they  say:  “ You  are  Turks.  Thanks  be  to  Allah,  among  the 
Turks are religious scholars and people of perfection of every sort. Said is a 
Kurd. To work along with someone who does not share your nationality is 
unpatriotic. ”

T h e   A n s w e r :   You  miserable  person  without  religion!  All  praise  be  to 
Allah, I am a Muslim. At all times there are three hundred and ﬁfty million 
members of my sacred nation. I seek refuge with Allah a hundred thousand 
times  from  sacriﬁcing  for  the  idea  of  racialism  and  negative  nationalism 
three hundred and ﬁfty million brothers who enjoy an eternal brotherhood 
and who help me with their prayers and among whom are the vast major-
ity of Kurds. And I seek refuge with Allah from gaining in place of those 
innumerable  blessed  brothers  a  few  who  have  embarked  on  a  way  that  is 
without religion or belongs to no school of law, who bear the name of Kurd 
and are reckoned to belong to the Kurdish people. O you without religion! 
There would have to have been some idiots like you who would abandon 
the  everlasting  brotherhood  of  a  luminous  beneﬁcial  community  of  three 
hundred  and  ﬁfty  million  true  brothers,  to  gain  the  brotherhood  –  which 
even in this world is without beneﬁt – of a handful of Hungarian inﬁdels or 
Europeanized Turks who have lost their religion. Since, in the Third Matter 
of the Twenty-Sixth Letter we have shown together with the evidences the 
nature of negative nationalism and its harms, we refer you to that, and here 
only  explain  a  truth  which  was  mentioned  brieﬂy  at  the  end  of  the  Third 
Matter. It is as follows:

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – SIXTH SECTION

497

I  say  to  those  pseudo-patriotic  irreligious  deviants  who  hide  under  the 
veil of Turkism and in reality are enemies of the Turks: “ I am closely and 
truly connected by means of an eternal, true brotherhood with the nation of 
Islam, with the believers of this country who are called Turks. On account of 
Islam, I have a proud and partial love for the sons of this land who for close 
on a thousand years victoriously carried the banner of the Qur’an to every 
corner of the world. As for you, you pseudo-patriotic imposters! You pos-
sess in a way that will make you forget the true national pride of the Turks, a 
metaphorical, racial, temporary, and hateful brotherhood. I ask you: does the 
Turkish nation consist only of heedless and lustful youths between the ages 
of twenty and forty? And is what is beneﬁcial for them and will serve them 
– as demanded by nationalist patriotism – an European education which will 
only increase their heedlessness, accustom them to immorality, and encour-
age them in what is forbidden? Is it to amuse them temporarily and so make 
them weep in old age? If nationalist patriotism consists of this, and this is 
progress and the happiness of life, yes, if you are a Turkist and nationalist 
like that, I ﬂee from such Turkism, and you can ﬂee from me, too! If you 
have even a jot of patriotism, intelligence, and fairness, consider the follow-
ing divisions of society and give me an answer. It is like this:

The sons of this land known as the Turkish nation consist of six parts. 
The ﬁrst part are the righteous and the pious. The second are the sick and 
those stricken by disaster. The third are the elderly. The fourth are the chil-
dren. The ﬁfth are the poor and the weak. And the sixth are the young. Are 
the ﬁrst ﬁve groups not Turks? Do they have no share of nationalist patriot-
ism? Is it nationalist patriotism to vex those ﬁve groups, spoil their pleasure 
in life, and destroy those things that console them in order to give drunken 
enjoyment to the sixth group? Or is it enmity towards the nation? According 
to the rule “ The word is with the majority, ” that which harms the majority 
is inimical, not friendly!

I ask you, is the greatest beneﬁt of the believers and the pious, the ﬁrst 
group, to be found in a European-type civilization? Or is it to be found in 
thinking of eternal happiness through the truths of belief, in travelling the 
way of truth, for which they are most desirous, and in ﬁnding a true solace? 
The way the misguided and bogus patriots like you have taken extinguishes 
the spiritual lights of the pious people of belief, destroys their true consola-
tion, and shows death to be eternal nothingness and the grave to be the door 
to everlasting separation.

498

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

Are  the  beneﬁts  of  the  disaster-stricken,  the  sick,  and  those  who  have 
despaired of life, who form the second group, to be found in the way of a 
European-type, irreligious civilization? For those unfortunates want a light, 
a solace. They want a reward in return for the calamities they have suffered. 
They want to take their revenge on those who have oppressed them. They 
want to repulse the terrors at the door of the grave, which they are approach-
ing. Through their false patriotism, people like you plunge a needle into the 
hearts of those unhappy victims of disaster who are much in need of com-
passion, soothing, and healing, and deserving of them. You hit them over the 
head! You mercilessly destroy all their hopes! You cast them into absolute 
despair! Is this nationalist patriotism? Is that how you provide beneﬁts for 
the nation?

The  elderly,  the  third  group,  forms  a  third.  They  are  approaching  the 
grave, drawing close to death, growing distant from the world, coming close 
to  the  hereafter.  Are  their  beneﬁts,  lights,  and  consolation  to  be  found  in 
listening to the cruel adventures of tyrants like Hulagu and Jenghiz? Do they 
have a place in your modern-type movements which make the hereafter for-
gotten, bind a person to the world, are without result, and have the meaning 
of decline while being superﬁcially progress? Is the light of the hereafter to 
be found in the cinema? Is true solace to be found in the theatre? If nation-
alist patriotism is in effect to slaughter them with an immaterial knife, and 
give them the idea that “ you are being impelled towards everlasting noth-
ingness, ” and to transform the grave, which they consider to be the gate of 
mercy, into the dragon’s mouth, and to breathe in their ears: “ You too will 
enter  there! ”  –  if,  while  these  unhappy  elderly  people  want  respect  from 
patriotism,  this  is  what  it  consists  of,  I  seek  refuge  with  Allah  a  hundred 
thousand times from such patriotism!

The  fourth  group  are  the  children.  They  want  kindness  from  national-
ist  patriotism;  they  await  compassion.  Also,  in  respect  of  their  weakness, 
impotence, and powerlessness, their spirits may expand through knowing a 
compassionate and powerful Creator; their abilities may unfold in a happy 
manner. If instilled with the reliance on Allah that springs from belief and 
with  the  submission  of  Islam  that  may  withstand  the  awesome  fears  and 
worldly  situations  of  the  future,  these  innocents  may  look  eagerly  to  life. 
Will this be achieved by teaching them things about the progress of civiliza-
tion, with which they have little connection, and the principles of lightless 
materialist philosophy, which destroys their morale and extinguishes their 
spirits? If man consisted only of an animal body and he had no mind in his 

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – SIXTH SECTION

499

head, perhaps these European principles which you fancifully call civilized 
education and national education could have afforded these innocent chil-
dren  some  worldly  beneﬁt  in  the  form  of  temporary  childish  amusement. 
Since they will be cast onto the surging tumult of life, and since they are 
human  beings,  they  will  certainly  have  far-reaching  desires  in  their  small 
hearts and large goals will be born in their little heads. Since the reality is 
thus, compassion requires that in the face of their inﬁnite want and impo-
tence an extremely powerful support and inexhaustible place of recourse are 
placed in their hearts, and these are belief in Allah and belief in the hereafter. 
This is kindness and compassion for them. It otherwise means slaughtering 
those wretched innocents with the drunkenness of nationalist patriotism, like 
a crazy mother slaughtering her child with a knife. It is a savage cruelty and 
wrong, like pulling out their brains and hearts and making them eat them to 
nourish their bodies.

The ﬁfth group are the poor and the weak. The poor, who, because of their 
poverty, suffer greatly at the heavy burdens of life, and the weak, who are 
grieved at life’s awesome upheavals – do they receive no share from nation-
alist patriotism? Is it to be found in the movements you have instituted under 
the name of European-style, unveiled, Pharaoh-like civilization, which only 
increase their despair and suffering? The salve for the wound of indigence 
may be found in the sacred pharmacy of Islam, not in the idea of racialism. 
The weak receive no strength and resistance from the philosophy of natural-
ism, which is dark, lacks consciousness, and is bound to chance; they may 
receive them from Islamic zeal and the sacred nationhood of Islam!

The sixth group is the youth. If the youth of these young people had 
been perpetual, the wine you have given them to drink through negative 
nationalism  would  have  had  some  temporary  beneﬁt  and  use.  But  when 
they painfully come to their senses as they advance in years, when they 
awaken from that sweet sleep in the morning of old age, their distress at 
the pleasurable drunkenness of youth will make them weep, and the pass-
ing of their pleasant dream will cause them much grief. It will make them 
exclaim: “ Alas! Both my youth has gone and my life has departed, and I 
am approaching the grave bankrupt; if only I had used my head! ” Is the 
share of nationalist patriotism for this group to enjoy themselves brieﬂy 
and temporarily, and to be made to weep regretfully for a very long time? 
Or is their worldly happiness and pleasure in life to be found in making 
their ﬂeeting youth permanent through worship and by spending that ﬁne, 
sweet bounty, not on the way of dissipation but on the straight path in the 

500

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

form of offering thanks so as to gain eternal youth in the Realm of Bliss? 
You say, if you possess even a grain of intelligence!

I n   S h o r t :  If the Turkish nation consisted only of young people, and if 
their youth was perpetual, and they had no place other than this world, your 
European-style  movement  under  the  screen  of  Turkism  might  have  been 
counted as nationalist patriotism. You might have been able to say about me 
as someone who attaches little importance to the life of this world, considers 
racialism to be “ the European disease, ” tries to prevent young people pursu-
ing illicit amusements and vices, and came into the world in another coun-
try: “ He is a Kurd. Don’t follow him! ” Perhaps you would have been right 
to say it. But since, as explained above, the sons of this land, who go under 
the name of Turks, consist of six groups, to cause harm to ﬁve of the groups 
and spoil their pleasure in life, and to afford a temporary, worldly pleasure 
the consequences of which are bad, to only one group, rather, to intoxicate 
them, is scarcely friendship to the Turkish nation; it is enmity.

Yes, according to race, I am not counted as a Turk but I have worked 
with  all  my  strength,  with  complete  eagerness,  in  compassionate  and 
brotherly  fashion,  for  the  groups  among  the  Turks  of  the  Allah-fearing, 
the disaster-stricken, the elderly, the children, and the weak and the poor. 
I  have  worked  for  the  young  people  as  well,  who  are  the  sixth  group;  I 
want them to give up any unlawful acts that will poison their worldly life, 
destroy their lives in the hereafter, and for one hour’s laughter, produce a 
year of weeping. The works I have taken from the Qur’an and published 
in the Turkish language – not only these six or seven years, but for twenty 
years  –  are  there  for  everyone  to  see.  Yes,  praise  be  to  Allah,  through 
these works derived from the All-Wise Qur’an’s mine of lights, the light 
is  shown  which  the  group  of  the  elderly  wants  more  than  anything;  the 
most efﬁcacious remedies for the disaster-stricken and the sick are pointed 
out  in  the  sacred  pharmacy  of  the  Qur’an;  the  door  of  the  grave,  which 
causes more thought to the elderly than anything else, is shown to be the 
door of mercy, not the door leading to execution. A truly powerful point 
of support in the face of the calamities and harmful things confronting the 
sensitive hearts of children, and a place of recourse to meet all their hopes 
and desires, have been extracted from the mine of the All-Wise Qur’an, 
and they have been demonstrated and proﬁted from in fact. And the heavy 
obligations of life, which crush most the poor and weak, have been allevi-
ated by the truths of belief of the All-Wise Qur’an.

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – SIXTH SECTION

501

Thus, these ﬁve groups are ﬁve out of the six parts of the Turkish nation, 
and we are working for their beneﬁt. The sixth group are the young people. 
We feel a powerful brotherhood with the good ones from among them. But 
between those like you who have deviated from the straight path, and us, 
there is no friendship at all! Because we do not recognize as Turks those who 
embrace misguidance and want to abandon Islamic nationhood, which holds 
all the true causes of pride of the Turks. We consider them to be Europeans 
hiding behind the screen of Turkishness! Because even if they claim to be 
Turkists a hundred thousand times over, they could not deceive the people 
of truth. For their actions and works would give the lie to what they claim.

O you who follow European ways! And you deviants who with your 
propaganda try to make my true brothers look coldly on me! How do you 
beneﬁt this nation? You extinguish the lights of the ﬁrst group, the pious 
and the righteous. You scatter poison on the wounds of the second group, 
who deserve kindness and care. You destroy the solace of the third group, 
who  are  most  worthy  of  respect,  and  you  cast  them  into  despair.  You 
destroy completely the morale of the fourth group, who are truly in need 
of compassion, and you extinguish their true humanity. You make fruit-
less the hopes and calls for help of the ﬁfth group, who are most needy for 
assistance, help, and solace, and in their eyes, you turn life into something 
more ghastly than death. And to the sixth group, who need to be warned 
and to come to their senses, you give such a heady wine to drink in the 
sleep of youth that its hangover is truly grievous and terrible. Is this your 
nationalist patriotism for the sake of which you sacriﬁce so many sacred 
things?  Is  this  what  Turkism  has  to  offer  the  Turks?  I  seek  refuge  with 
Allah from it a hundred thousand times!

Sirs! I know that when you are defeated in the face of truth, you have 
recourse to force. In accordance with the fact that power lies in the truth, not 
in force, you can set ﬁre to the world around my head, but this head, which 
has been sacriﬁced for the truth of the Qur’an, will not bow before you. And 
I tell you this, that not a limited number of people like you who are in effect 
despised by the nation, but if thousands like you were physically hostile to 
me, I would pay them no attention, attaching no more value to them than 
to injurious animals. Because what can you do to me? All you can do is to 
either bring my life to an end, or spoil my work and service. I am attached 
to nothing in the world apart from these. As for the appointed hour which 
befalls life, I believe as certainly as witnessing it that it does not change, 
it is determined. Since this is so, if I die as a martyr on the way of truth, 

502

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

I do not hang back from it, I await it longingly. Moreover, I am old and I ﬁnd 
it hard to believe that I shall live for more than another year. To transform 
one year’s apparent life into everlasting eternal life through martyrdom is 
an exalted aim for people like me. As for my work and service, through His 
mercy, Almighty Allah has given such brothers in the service of belief and 
the Qur’an that through my death it will be carried out in numerous centres 
instead  of  one.  If  my  tongue  is  silenced  by  death,  powerful  tongues  will 
speak in its place, continuing my work. I can even say that just as a single 
seed produces the life of a shoot by entering the earth and dying, and a hun-
dred seeds perform their duties in place of one, so I nourish the hope that my 
death will be the means to service greater than was my life!

Fifth Satanic Stratagem

FIFTH SATANIC STRATAGEM

Proﬁting from egotism, the supporters of the people of misguidance want 
to draw my brothers away from me. Truly, egotism man’s most dangerous 
vein. It is his weakest vein, too. They can make people do terrible things by 
encouraging it. My brothers! Beware, do not let them strike you with ego-
tism, do not let them hunt you with it! You should know that this century 
the people of misguidance have mounted the ego and are galloping through 
the valleys of misguidance. The people of truth have to give it up if they 
are to serve the truth. Even if a person is justiﬁed in making use of the ego, 
since he will resemble the others and they too will suppose he is self-seeking 
like them, it will be an injustice to the service of the truth. In any event, the 
service of the Qur’an around which we are gathered does not accept the ‘I’, 
it requires the ‘we.’ It says: “ Don’t say ‘I’, say ‘we.’ ”

Of course, you have realized that this poor brother of yours did not set out 
with the ‘I’. And he did not make you serve it. Indeed, he showed himself to 
you as an ego-free servant of the Qur’an. He does not care for himself and 
has made it his practice not to take the part of his ego. In any case, he has 
proved to you with decisive evidence that the works that have been presented 
for general beneﬁt are common property; that is, they have issued from the 
All-Wise Qur’an. Nobody can claim ownership of them egotistically. Even 
if, to suppose the impossible, I did claim them as my own because of my 
ego, as one of my brothers said: since this door of Qur’anic truth has been 
opened,  the  scholars  and  those  seeking  perfection  should  not  look  at  my 
defects and insigniﬁcance and hold back from following me; they should not 
deem themselves self-sufﬁcient. For sure, the works of the former righteous 
and exacting religious scholars are a huge treasury sufﬁcient for every ill, 

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – SIXTH SECTION

503

but it sometimes happens that a key holds more importance than the treas-
ury. For the treasury is closed and a key may open lots of treasuries.

I  reckon  that  those  who  are  excessively  egotistical  in  regard  to  their 
learning  have  understood  that  the  published  Wo r d s   are  each  keys  to  the 
truths of the Qur’an and diamonds swords smiting those who try to deny 
those truths. The people of virtue and perfection and those who are strongly 
egotistical in regard to their learning should know that the students are stu-
dents not of me but of the All-Wise Qur’an, and that I study along with 
them.

If, to suppose the impossible, I claimed to be the master, since we have a 
way of saving all the classes of the people of belief – from the common peo-
ple to the elite – from the doubts and scepticism to which they are exposed, 
then let those scholars either ﬁnd an easier solution, or let them take the part 
of  our  solution  and  teach  it  and  support  it.  The  corrupt  religious  scholars 
are faced with a grave threat; religious scholars have to be especially care-
ful at this time. So suppose, like my enemies, that I perform a service like 
this for the sake of egotism. Since a large number of people give up their 
egotism  and  gather  around  a  Pharaoh-like  man  with  complete  loyalty  for 
some worldly and national aim and carry out their work in complete solidar-
ity, does this brother of yours not have the right to ask for your solidarity 
around the truths of belief and the Qur’an by giving up egotism, like those 
corporals of that worldly society, so long as he conceals his egotism? If even 
the greatest of the scholars among you were not to agree, wouldn’t they be 
in the wrong?

My  brothers!  The  most  dangerous  aspect  of  egotism  in  our  work  is 
jealousy. If it is not purely for Allah’s sake, jealousy interferes and spoils 
it. Just as one of a person’s hands cannot be jealous of the other, and his 
eye cannot envy his ear, and his heart cannot compete with his reason, so 
each of you resembles a sense, a member, of the collective personality of 
the body we constitute. Your essential duty springing from the conscience 
is not to compete with one another, but to take pride and pleasure in each 
other’s good qualities. 

One other thing remains and it is the most dangerous: for yourselves and 
your friends to be jealous this poor brother of yours. There are scholars of 
standing among you, and some scholars are egotistical when it comes to their 
learning. In that respect they egotistical even if they themselves are modest. 
They cannot easily give it up. Whatever their hearts and minds may do, their 
evil-commanding souls seek pre-eminence and to sell themselves, and even 

504

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

to dispute the treatises that have been written. Although their hearts love the 
treatises and their minds appreciate them and recognize their worth, out of 
jealousy arising from the egotism of learning, their souls want to decry the 
value of the Wo r d s , as though nurturing implicit enmity towards them, for 
then the products of their own thought can compete with them and be sold 
like them. But I have to tell them this:

Even if the members of this circle of Qur’anic teaching are leading schol-
ars and authorities on the Law, their duties in respect of the sciences of belief 
are only to make explanations and elucidations of the Wo r d s  that have been 
written, or to set them in order. For I have understood through many signs 
that we have been charged with the duty of issuing f a t w a s  concerning these 
sciences of belief. If someone within our circle writes anything more than 
this due to a feeling in his soul arising from the egotism of learning, it will 
be like a cold dispute or a deﬁcient plagiarism. For it has been established 
through numerous evidences and signs that the parts of the R i s a l e - i  N u r  have 
issued from the Qur’an. In accordance with the rule of the division of labour, 
each of us has undertaken a duty, and we convey those distillations of the 
water of life to those who are in need of them!

Sixth Satanic Stratagem

SIXTH SATANIC STRATAGEM

It is this: they take advantage of the human traits of laziness, the desire 
for physical comfort, and attachment to other duties. Yes, satans among jinn 
and men attack from every angle. When they see those of our friends whose 
hearts  are  stout,  intentions  pure,  loyalty  strong,  and  enterprise,  elevated, 
they attack from other sides. As follows:

In order to put a stop to our work and discourage from our service, they 
proﬁt from those friends’ laziness, desire for physical comfort, and attach-
ment to other duties. They keep people from the service of the Qur’an with 
every  kind  of  trick  so  that  without  their  being  aware  of  it,  more  work  is 
found for some of them. Then they cannot ﬁnd the time to serve the Qur’an. 
And to others, they show the enticing things of this world so that arousing 
their desires, they become slack in their service; and so on. These ways of 
attack are numerous, so cutting them short, we refer them to your perspica-
cious understanding.

My brothers, take great care! Your duty is sacred and your service, ele-
vated. Every hour of your time may be as valuable as a day’s worship. Be 
aware of this and don’t waste any of them!

A Sacred Date

A Sacred Date 
The date a signiﬁcant mystery of the All-Wise Qur’an became clear was 

again contained in the word “ Qur’an. ” It was like this:

According to the a b j a d  system the numerical value of the word “ Qur’an ” 
is  three  hundred  and  ﬁfty-one.  It  contains  two  a l i f s ;  if  the  concealed  a l i f  
is read  a l f u n , it is  a l f u n  with the value of a thousand.  1 That is to say, the 
year  one  thousand  three  hundred  and  ﬁfty-one  may  be  called  the  Year  of 
the  Qur’an,  for  during  it  the  strange  mystery  of  the  ‘coincidences’  in  the 
word “ Qur’an ” became apparent in the parts of the R i s a l e - i   N u r , which is 
the Qur’an’s commentary. The miraculous mystery of the coincidences of 
the word “ Allah ” in the Qur’an appeared the same year. A Qur’an showing 
the miraculous patterns, arranged in a new way, was written the same year. 
That year students of the Qur’an endeavoured to preserve the Qur’anic script 
with all their strength in the face of its being changed. Important aspects of 
the Qur’an’s miraculousness became apparent that same year. And the same 
year  numerous  events  occurred  which  were  related  to  the  Qur’an,  and  it 
seems they will continue to occur.

1.  According to the rules of grammar, f a i l u n  is read f a ’ l u n , like k a t i f u n  is read k a t f u n . 
Therefore, a l i f u n  is read a l f u n . Then it becomes one thousand three hundred and ﬁfty-one.

Recently the concealed aggression of the irreligious has taken on a most 
ugly  form;  tyrannical  aggression  against  the  unfortunate  people  of  belief 
and against religion. Our private and unofﬁcial call to prayer and  i q ā m a   1 
was interrupted during the private worship of myself and one or two broth-
ers  in  the  mosque  I  myself  repaired.  “ Why  are  you  reciting  the  i q ā m a   in 
Arabic and making the call to prayer secretly? ” they asked. My patience is 
exhausted by keeping silent, so I say, not to those unscrupulous vile men 
who are not worth addressing, but to the heads of the Pharaoh-like society 
who with arbitrary despotism play with the fate of this nation: O you people 
of innovation who have deviated from the straight path of religion, I want 
the answer to six questions.

1.    I q ā m a   ( Ar. )  ( T.  k â m e t  ):  formulas  recited  by  the  muezzin,  signalling  the  com-

mencement of the ṣ a l ā t  ( T. n a m â z  ) or prescribed prayers.

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – SIXTH SECTION

The First

Every government in the world, every people which rules, and even can-
nibals or the chief of a band of brigands, have some principle, some law, 
by which they rule. So according to which principle do you carry out this 
extraordinary aggression? Show your law! Or do you accept as the law the 
arbitrary whims of a handful of contemptible ofﬁcials? Because no law can 
interrupt private worship in that way; there cannot be such a law!

The Second

On what force do you rely that you are so bold as to violate the princi-
ple  of  freedom  of  conscience,  which  governs  almost  everywhere  in  man-
kind, especially in this age of freedom and in civilized circles, and to treat 
it lightly and so indirectly to insult mankind and dismiss their objections? 
What power do you have that you attack religion and the people of religion 
in this way as though you had taken irreligion as a religion for yourselves 
in bigoted fashion, although by calling yourselves secular you proclaim that 
you will interfere with neither religion nor irreligion? Such a thing will not 
remain  secret!  You  will  have  to  answer  for  it!  So  what  answer  will  you 
give? Although you could not hold out against the objections of the smallest 
of twenty governments, you try to violate by force freedom of conscience, 
as though you completely disregard the objections of twenty governments.

The Third

According to what principle do you propose to people like me who fol-
low the Shaﬁ‘i school of law, the Hanaﬁ school, in a way opposed to the 
elevatedness and purity of that school, due to the false f a t w a s  of certain cor-
rupt religious scholars who have sold their consciences to gain the world? 
If, after abrogating the Shaﬁ‘i school, which has millions of followers, and 
making them all follow the Hanaﬁ school, it is forcibly proposed to me in 
tyrannical fashion, it may perhaps be said that it is a principle of irreligious 
people like you. Otherwise it is arbitrary and despicable, and we do not fol-
low the whims of people such as that, and we do not recognize them!

The Fourth

In  accordance  with  which  principle  do  you  propose  through  a  corrupt, 
innovating f a t w a , to “ perform the i q ā m a  in Turkish ” in a way completely 
contrary to Turkish nationalism, which is sincerely religious and sincerely 
respectful  towards  religion  and  has  since  early  times  blended  and  united 
with Islam, in the name of Turkism, which has the meaning of Europeanism, 

508

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

to those like me who belong to another nation? Yes, although I have friendly 
and brotherly relations with true Turks, I have in no respect any relation with 
the Turkism of imitators of Europe like you. How can you propose such a 
thing to me? Through which law? Perhaps, if you abolish the nationhood of 
the Kurds, of whom there are millions and who for thousands of years have 
not forgotten their nationhood and language, and are the true fellow-citizens 
and companions in j i h a d  of the Turks, and make them forget their language, 
then  perhaps  your  proposal  to  those  like  me  who  are  reckoned  to  be  of  a 
different race would be in accordance with some sort of savage principle. 
Otherwise it is purely arbitrary. The arbitrary whims of individuals may not 
be followed, and we do not follow them!

The Fifth

A government may apply all laws to its citizens and to those it accepts as 
its citizens, but it cannot apply its laws to those it does not accept. For they 
are able to say: “ Since we are not citizens, you are not our government! ”

Furthermore, no government can inﬂict two penalties at the same time. It 
either imprisons a murderer, or it executes him. To punish by both imprison-
ment and capital punishment is a principle nowhere!

However, despite the fact that I have caused no harm whatsoever to this 
country and nation, for eight years you have held me in captivity in a way 
not inﬂicted on even a criminal belonging to the wildest and most foreign 
nation. Although you have pardoned criminals, you have negated my free-
dom and deprived me of all civil rights. You have not said: “ He too is a son 
of this land, ” so in accordance with what principle and law do you propose, 
contrary to the wishes of your nation, these freedom-destroying principles 
to someone like me who is a foreigner to you in every respect? Since in the 
Great War you have counted as nothing all the heroic deeds to which this 
person was the means and were testiﬁed to by the army’s commanders, and 
considered  his  self-sacrﬁcing  struggles  for  the  sake  of  this  country  to  be 
crimes; and since you deemed his preserving the good morality of this unfor-
tunate nation and his serious and effective work to secure its happiness in 
this world and the next to be treason; and since you have punished for eight 
years ( and now the punishment has been for twenty-eight years ) someone 
who does not for himself accept your injurious, dangerous, arbitrary princi-
ples, which in reality are without beneﬁt and spring from unbelief and from 
Europe; the punishment is the same. I did not accept its application so you 
made me suffer it. So according to what principle is it to enforce a second 
punishment?

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – SIXTH SECTION

509

The Sixth

In view of the treatment you have meted out to me, according to your 
belief, I oppose you in general fashion. You are sacriﬁng your religion and 
life in the hereafter for the sake of your lives in this world. According to you, 
due to the opposition between us and contrary to you, we are all the time 
ready to sacriﬁce our life in this world for our religion and for the hereafter. 
To sacriﬁce two or three years of humiliating life under your domination in 
order to gain sacred martyrdom, is like the water of Kawthar for us. How-
ever, in order to make you tremble, relying on the effulgence and indications 
of the All-Wise Qur’an, I tell you this with certainty:

You shall not live after killing me! You shall be driven out of the world, 
your paradise and your beloved, by an irresistible hand, and swiftly cast into 
everlasting darkness. Behind me, your Nimrod-like chiefs will be quickly 
killed and sent to me. In the divine presence I shall grasp hold of them by 
their collars, and on divine justice casting them down to the lowest of the 
low, I shall take my revenge!

O you miserable wretches who sell religion and your lives in the here-
after for this world! If you want to live, do not interfere with me! I hope 
from divine mercy that my death will serve religion more than my life and 
will explode over your heads like a bomb, scattering you! Cause me trou-
ble if you have the courage! If you do anything, you shall see! With all my 
strength I proclaim this verse in the face of all your threats:

Like all the bad things they do, the arguments which those people who are 
attempting to change the marks of Islam cite to support themselves spring 
from their blind imitation of Europe. They say:

“ In London, Europeans who have embraced Islam translate many things 
like the call to prayer and i q ā m a  into their own languages in their own coun-
try. The World of Islam says nothing in the face of this and does not object. 
That  must  mean  it  is  permissible  according  to  the  Shari‘a,  since  they  are 
silent? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  There is such a glaring difference here that no conscious 
being could make such a comparison and imitate them. For the European 
lands  are  called  the  Abode  of  War  in  the  terminology  of  the  Shari‘a,  and 
there are numerous things that are permissible in the Abode of War that are 
not lawful in the Abode of Islam.

Furthermore, the lands of Europe are the realm of Christendom. They are 
not an environment that communicates and instils the meanings of the terms 
of the Shari‘a and concepts of the sacred words, so necessarily the sacred 

510

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – SEVENTH SECTION

511

meanings  have  been  preferred  to  the  sacred  words;  the  words  have  been 
abandoned for the meaning; the lesser of two evils has been chosen. In the 
Abode of Islam, however, the very environment teaches the people of Islam 
the abbreviated meanings of those sacred words. The conversations of Mus-
lims about Islamic traditions and Islamic history and the marks of Islam and 
the pillars of Islam, all continuously instil in them the concise meanings of 
those blessed words. In this country, besides the mosques and the m e d r e s e s , 
even the gravestones in the graveyards inculcate those sacred meanings in 
believers like teachers and recall them to them. If for some worldly advan-
tage, someone who calls himself a Muslim learns ﬁfty words a day from a 
French dictionary, and then in ﬁfty years does not learn the sacred phrases 
ّ(cid:195)ا َناَ(cid:111)ْ(cid:93) ُ(cid:126) , ِ
ّ(cid:195)َا which are repeated ﬁfty times 
daily, does he not fall lower than an animal? These sacred words cannot be 
translated and corrupted and deported for such beasts! To change and deport 
them means erasing all the gravestones; it means turning all the dead in the 
graveyards against them, trembling at such an insult.

In order to deceive the nation, corrupt religious scholars who have been 
misled  by  the  irreligious,  say  that  contrary  to  the  other  Imams,  Imam-i 
A‘zam  1 said: “ If the need arises in distant countries, it is permissible for 
those who know no Arabic at all to recite the F a t i h a  in Persian. ” 2 We are in 
need of this, so can we recite it in Turkish?

T h e   A n s w e r :   The  most  important  of  the  leading  authorities  as  well  as 
the other twelve leading  m u j t a h i d s  have given  f a t w a s  opposing this  f a t w a  
of Imam-i A‘zam. The great highway of the World of Islam is their high-
way; the Muslim community may follow it. Those who drive the commu-
nity towards another, special and narrow, way are leading it astray. Imam-i 
A‘zam’s f a t w a  is particular in ﬁve respects:

F i r s t l y :  It addresses people who are far from the centre of Islam.
S e c o n d l y :  It is in consequence of real need.
T h i r d l y :   According  to  one  narration,  it  refers  only  to  translations  into 

Persian, which is supposed to be a language of the people of Paradise.

F o u r t h l y :  The ruling is limited to the  F a t i h a , so that those who do not 

know it will not give up performing the obligatory prayers.

F i f t h l y :  Permission was given so that the sacred meanings could be under-
stood by the ordinary people whose Islamic zeal arose from their powerful 
belief. But to translate them and discard the Arabic original due to weakness 
of belief, negative nationalism, and hatred for the Arabic language, driven 
by a destructive urge, will cause people to renounce religion. 

Second Sign

SECOND SIGN

The people of innovation who have changed the marks of Islam ﬁrst of all 
sought f a t w a s  from corrupt religious scholars. They had previously pointed 
out  that  the  f a t w a   we  explained  was  particular  in ﬁve  respects.  Secondly, 
the people of innovation adopted the following inauspicious idea from the 
European reformists: being dissatisﬁed with the Catholic Church foremost 
the  revolutionaries,  reformists,  and  philosophers,  who  were  innovators 
according to the Church, favoured Protestantism, which was considered to 
Mu‘tazilite,  and  taking  advantage  of  the  French  Revolution  they  partially 
destroyed the Catholic Church and proclaimed Protestantism.

Then the pseudo-patriots here, who are accustomed to imitating blindly, 
said: “ A revolution like that came about in the Christian religion. At ﬁrst the 
revolutionaries  were  called  apostates,  then  later  they  were  again  accepted 
as  Christians.  So  why  shouldn’t  there  be  a  similar  religious  revolution  in 
Islam? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  The difference here is even greater than in the false com-
parison in the First Sign. Because in the religion of Jesus ( Upon whom be 
peace ),  only  the  fundamentals  of  religion  were  taken  from  him.  Most  of 
the injunctions relating to social life and the secondary matters of the law 
were formulated by the disciples and other spiritual leaders. The greater part 
were taken from former holy scriptures. Since Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ) 
was not a worldly ruler and sovereign, and since he was not the source of 
general social laws, the fundamentals of his religion were as though clothed 
with the garment of common laws and civil rules taken from outside, hav-
ing  been  given  a  different  form  and  called  the  Christian  law.  If  this  form 
is changed and the garment transformed, the fundamental religion of Jesus 
( Upon whom be peace ) may persist. It does not infer denying or giving the 
lie to Jesus himself ( Upon whom be peace ). 

However, the Glory of the World ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) 
was the founder of the religion and Shari‘a of Islam. He was the sovereign of 
this world and the next, and the East and West and Andalusia and India were 
his seat of rule. He himself therefore both taught the fundamentals of the 
religion of Islam, and brought its secondary matters and other injunctions, 

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – SEVENTH SECTION

513

including even minor matters of conduct; he himself taught them; he com-
manded them. That is to say, the secondary matters of Islam are not like a 
garment capable of change, so that if they are changed, the essential religion 
will persist. They are rather a sort body for the fundamentals of religion, or 
at least a skin. They have blended and combined with it and cannot be sepa-
rated. To change them infers direct denial and contradiction of the one who 
brought the Shari‘a.

As  for  the  differences  in  the  schools  of  law,  this  has  arisen  from  dif-
ferences in ways of understanding the theoretical principles shown by the 
Shari‘a’s  owner.  Principles  called  “ the  essentials  of  religion, ”  which  are 
not  open  to  interpretation,  and  those  called  “ incontrovertible ”  cannot  be 
changed in any way and may not be interpreted. Anyone who does change 
them quits the religion and is included under the rule:

The people of innovation have found the following pretext for their irreli-
gion and deviation from the straight path. They say: “ The French Revolution 
was the cause of a sequence of events in the world of humanity; the clergy 
and spiritual leaders and the Catholic Church, which was their Church, were 
attacked and eliminated. Later the Revolution was condoned by a lot of peo-
ple; also, the French made greater progress. Is this not so? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  Like with the previous comparisons, the differences here 
are clear. For in France, the Christian religion and particularly the Catholic 
Church had for a long time been a means of domination and despotism in 
the hands of the upper and ruling classes. It was the means by which they 
perpetuated their hold over the ordinary people. And since it was through 
the Catholic Church that the patriots were oppressed, who among the com-
mon people were awakened and were called “ Jacobins, ” and the freedom-
seeking thinkers were persecuted, who attacked the despotism of the upper 
class tyrants; and since for nearly four hundred years the Catholic Church 
had been an imputed cause, through revolutions in Europe, of overturning 
the stability of social life, it had been attacked, not in the name of irreligion, 
but by the other Christian sects. A feeling of indignation and enmity arose 
among  the  common  people  and  the  philosophers  as  a  result  of  which  the 
above-mentioned historical event took place. 

However,  no  oppressed  person  and  no  thinker  has  the  right  to  com-
plain about the religion of Muhammad ( UWBP ) and the Shari‘a of Islam.

For it does not injure them, it protects them. Islamic history is there for all 
to see. Apart from one or two incidents, no internal wars of religion have 
occurred. Whereas the Catholic Church caused four hundred years of inter-
nal revolutions.

Furthermore, Islam has been the stronghold of the common people rather 
than of the upper classes. Through enjoining the payment of z a k a t  and pro-
hibiting usury and interest, it has made the upper classes not despots over 
the common people but servants in a way! It says: ْمُ(cid:183)ُ(cid:174)ِداَ(cid:114) ِمْوَ(cid:163)ْ(cid:170)ا ُدّ

the All-Wise Qur’an calls on the intellect to testify; it warns, refers to the 
reason, it urges investigation. Through this, it accords scholars and the peo-
ple of reason a position; it gives them importance. It does not dismiss the 
reason like the Catholic Church; it does not silence thinkers, or require blind 
imitation of them.

Since  the  fundamentals  of,  not  true  Christianity,  but  the  present-day 
Christian  religion  and  the  fundamentals  of  Islam  have  parted  on  another 
important point, they go their separate ways in many respects like the above-
mentioned differences. The important point is this:

Islam is the religion of the true afﬁrmation of divine unity ( t e v h i d - i   h a k -
i k î  )  so  that  it  dismisses  intermediaries  and  causes.  It  breaks  egotism  and 
establishes sincere worship. It cuts at the root every sort of false dominical-
ity, starting from that of the soul, and rebuffs it. It is because of this that if a 
person of high position from the upper class is going to be completely reli-
gious, he will have to give up his egotism. If he does not give up egotism, he 
will lose his strength of religion and to an extent give up his religion. 

As for the Christian religion of the present day, since it has accepted the 
belief of Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ) being the Son of Allah, it ascribes 
an  actual  effect  to  causes  and  intermediaries.  It  cannot  break  egotism  in 
the name of religion. Rather, saying that egotism is a holy deputy of Jesus 
( Upon whom be peace ), it ascribes it a sacredness. For this reason, members 
of the Christian upper classes who occupy the highest worldly positions may 
be completely religious. In fact, there are many like the former American 
President,  Wilson,  and  the  former  British  Prime  Minister,  Lloyd  George,

who were as religious as bigoted priests. But any Muslims who rise to those 
positions rarely remain completely religious and ﬁrm in their religion, for 
they cannot give up their pride and egotism. And true t a q w a  cannot be com-
bined with pride and egotism.

Yes, just as the religious bigotry of the Christian upper class and slack-
ness in religion of the Muslim upper class demonstrate an important differ-
ence, so the fact that the philosophers who emerged from Christianity were 
indifferent towards religion or else opposed it, while the great majority of 
those who emerged from Islam constructed their philosophy on Islamic fun-
damentals, demonstrates yet another important difference.

Furthermore, generally, ordinary Christians who have fallen on hard times 
or are sent to prison cannot expect assistance from religion. Formerly, most 
of  them  became  irreligious.  In  fact,  the  revolutionaries  famous  in  history 
who instigated the French Revolution and were called “ irreligious Jacob-
ins, ” were mostly disaster-stricken common people. Whereas in Islam, the 
great majority of those who suffer disaster or imprisonment await succour 
from religion and they become religious. This situation too, demonstrates an 
important difference.

The  people  of  innovation  say:  “ Religious  bigotry  made  us  backward. 
Living  this  age  necessitates  giving  up  bigotry.  Europe  advanced  when  it 
abandoned it. Isn’t this so? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  You are wrong and you have been deceived! Or else you 
are deceiving, for Europe is bigoted in religion. Tell an ordinary Bulgar or 
an English soldier or a French Jacobin: “ Wear this turban, or else you’ll be 
thrown into prison! ”, and their bigotry will force them to reply: “ Not prison, 
if you kill me even, I won’t insult my religion and nation in that way! ”

Also, history testiﬁes that whenever the people of Islam have adhered to 
their religion, they have advanced in relation to the strength of their adher-
ence. And whenever they have become less ﬁrm in their religion, they have 
declined. Whereas with Christianity, it is the opposite. This too arises from 
an essential difference.

Also, Islam cannot be compared with other religions; if a Muslim aban-
dons Islam and gives up his religion, he will not accept any other prophet; 
indeed, he will not acknowledge Almighty Allah either nor probably recog-
nize anything sacred. He will have no conscience that will allow him moral 
and spiritual attainment; it will be corrupted. Therefore, in the view of Islam, 

516

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

in wartime, an unbeliever has the right to life. His life is protected accord-
ing to Islam if he is outside the country and makes peace, or if he is inside 
the country and pays the head-tax. But an apostate does not have the right 
to life. For his conscience is corrupted and he becomes like poison in the 
life of society. But a Christian may still contribute to society, even if he is 
irreligious. He may accept some sacred matters and may believe in some of 
the prophets, and may assent to Almighty Allah in some respects.

I wonder, what advantage do these innovators, or more accurately devi-
ants or heretics, ﬁnd in this irreligion? If they are thinking of government 
and public order, to govern ten irreligious anarchists who do not know Allah 
and to repulse their evils is much more difﬁcult than governing a thousand 
people with religion. If they are thinking of progress, such irreligious people 
are an obstacle to progress, just as they are harmful for the administration 
and government. They destroy security and public order, which are the basis 
of progress and commerce. In truth, they are destructive due to the very way 
they have taken. The biggest fool in the world is one who expects progress, 
prosperity, and happiness from irreligious anarchists like them. One of those 
fools  who  occupied  a  high  position,  said:  “ We  said  ‘Allah!  Allah!’  and 
remained backward. Europe said ‘Guns and cannons,’ and advanced. ”

According  to  the  rule,  “ A  fool  should  be  answered  with  silence, ”  the 
answer for such people is silence. But because behind certain fools there are 
inauspicious clever people, we say this:

O you wretches! This world is a guesthouse. Every day thirty thousand 
witnesses  put  their  signature  with  their  corpses  to  the  decree  “ Death  is  a 
reality ” and they testify to it. Can you kill death? Can you contradict those 
witnesses? Since you can’t, death makes people say: “ Allah! Allah! ” Which 
of your guns and cannons can illuminate the everlasting darkness confront-
ing someone in the throes of death in place of “ Allah! Allah! ”, and trans-
form his absolute despair into absolute hope? Since there is death and we 
shall enter the grave, and this life departs and an eternal life comes, if guns 
and cannons are said once, “ Allah! Allah! ” should be said a thousand times. 
And  if  it  is  in  Allah’s  way,  the  gun  also  says  “ Allah! ”,  and  the  cannon 
booms “ A l l a h u   A k b a r !  ” It breaks the fast with “ Allah, ” and starts it.

The destructive innovators are of two kinds:
The First Kind say as though on account of religion and out of loyalty to 
Islam, as though to strengthen religion with nationalism: “ We want to plant 

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – SEVENTH SECTION

the luminous tree of religion, which has grown weak, in the earth of nation-
alism, in order to strengthen it. ” They appear to be supporting religion.

The Second Sort say in the name of the nation and on account of nation-
alism, in order to strengthen racialism, say: “ We want to graft Islam onto the 
nation, ” thus creating innovations.

T o   t h e   F i r s t   S o r t ,   w e   s a y :  O unhappy, corrupt scholars of religion who 
conﬁrm the saying “ loyal fools, ” or ecstatic, unthinking, ignorant Suﬁs! The 
Tuba tree of Islam, whose roots are founded in the reality of the universe and 
whose branches spread through the truths of the universe, cannot be planted 
in  the  earth  of  imaginary,  temporary,  partial,  particular,  negative,  indeed, 
baseless,  rancorous,  tyrannical,  and  dark  racialism!  To  try  to  do  so  is  to 
attempt something foolish, destructive, and innovative.

T o   t h e   S e c o n d   S o r t   o f   n a t i o n a l i s t s ,   w e   s a y   t h i s :  O you drunken pseudo-
patriots! Perhaps the previous century could have been the age of national-
ism.  This  century  is  not  the  age  of  racialism!  Communism  and  socialism 
pervade everything, destroying the idea of racialism. The age of racialism 
is  passing.  Eternal,  permanent  Islamic  nationalism  cannot  be  bound  onto 
temporary unstable racialism and grafted onto it. And even if it were to be, 
it would corrupt the Islamic nation, but it would not reform racialist nation-
alism. Yes, there appears to be a pleasure and temporary strength in a tem-
porary graft, but it is very temporary and the consequences are dangerous.

Furthermore, it would open up a split in the Turkish people that could 
not be healed in all eternity. Then the nation’s strength would be reduced to 
nothing, since one section would have broken the power of the other. If two 
mountains are placed in the two pans of some scales, a few pounds weight 
can move the two, raising one, and lowering the other.

Fifth Sign

The Second Question consists of two signs: 
The First is the FIFTH SIGN, and is a very brief answer to an important 
question:

Q u e s t i o n :  There are numerous authentic narrations about the appearance 
of the Mahdi at the end of time and his putting the world to rights, which 
will have been corrupted. However, the present time is the time of the group 
or social collectivity, not of the individual. However great a genius an indi-
vidual person is, even a hundredfold genius, if he is not the representative of 
a group and if he does not represent a group’s collective personality, he will 
be defeated in the face of the collective personality of an opposing group. At 
this time, however exalted the power of his sainthood, how can he reform 

518

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

the world amid the widespread corruption of a human group such as that? If 
all the Mahdi’s works are wondrous, it would be contrary to the divine wis-
dom and laws in the world. We want to understand the reality of this matter 
of the Mahdi. How can we?

T h e   A n s w e r :  Out of His perfect mercy, every time the Muslim commu-
nity has been corrupted, Almighty Allah has sent a reformer, or a regenera-
tor, or a vicegerent of high standing, or a supreme spiritual pole, or a perfect 
guide,  or  blessed  persons  resembling  a  Mahdi,  as  a  mark  of  His  protect-
ing  the  Shari‘a  of  Islam  until  eternity;  they  have  removed  the  corruption, 
reformed the nation, and preserved Muhammad’s ( UWBP ) religion. 

Since His custom has always been thus, certainly at the time of greatest 
corruption at the end of time He will send a luminous person as both the 
greatest  interpreter  of  the  Law,  and  the  supreme  renewer,  and  ruler,  and 
Mahdi, and guide, and spiritual pole, and that person will be from the Proph-
et’s ( UWBP ) Family. Almighty Allah ﬁlls and empties the world between 
the heavens and earth with clouds, and in an instant stills the storms of the 
sea, and in an hour in spring creates samples of the summer and in an hour in 
summer creates a winter storm. Such an All-Powerful One of Glory can also 
scatter the darkness covering the World of Islam by means of the Mahdi. He 
has promised this and certainly He will carry out His promise. 

If considered from the point of view of divine power, it is most easy. And 
if thought of from the point of view of causes and divine wisdom, it is again 
so reasonable and necessary that thinkers have asserted that even if it had 
not been narrated from the Bringer of Sure News ( UWBP ), it still should be 
thus. And it will be. It is like this: All praise be to Allah, the prayer,

all blessed chains of spiritual authorities in the assemblies of all the regions

Another is Sayyid Idrīs, who commands more than one hundred thousand. Another Sayy-
id, Sayyid Yaḥyā, commands hundreds of thousands of men. And so on. Just as among the 
members of this tribe of Sayyids there are numerous outward commanders, so too there ==

a mighty army. If they took on physical form and with their solidarity were 
formed into a division, if they awakened the religion of Islam and bound it 
together in unity and established a sort of sacred nationhood, the army of 
no other nation could withstand them. Thus, that numerous, powerful army 
is the Family of the Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), the 
Mahdi’s most select army.

Yes, today in the world there is no family distinguished by such high hon-
our and elevated qualities and nobility in its descendants, in unbroken suc-
cession and well-documented genealogy, which is as powerful and impor-
tant as the line of Sayyids of the Family of the Prophet ( UWBP ). Since early 
times it is they who have been at the heads of all the groups of the people of 
truth, and they who have been the renowned leaders of the people of perfec-
tion. Now it is a blessed line numbering millions. Vigilant and circumspect, 
their hearts full of belief and love of the Prophet ( UWBP ), they are distin-
guished by the honour of their world-renowned lineage. Momentous events 
shall occur which will awaken and arouse that sacred force within the vast 
community. Certainly, the elevated ardour in that huge force will surge up 
and the Mahdi shall come to lead it, guiding it to the way of truth and reality. 
We await from the divine law and divine mercy that it should be such, and 
its being such, like we await the coming of spring after winter; and we are 
right to await it.

Sixth Sign

The Second Sign, that is, the SIXTH SIGN

The  Mahdi’s  luminous  community  will  repair  the  destruction  of  the 
innovative regime of the secret society of the Sufyan, and will restore the 
Prophet’s ( UWBP ) glorious S u n n a . That is to say, the secret society of the 
Sufyan will try to destroy the Shari‘a of Muhammad ( UWBP ) in the World 
of Islam with the intention of denying his messengership, and will be killed 
and routed by the miraculous immaterial sword of the Mahdi’s community.
Moreover, in the world of humanity, the secret society of the Dajjal will 
overturn  civilization  and  subvert  all  mankind’s  sacred  matters,  with  the 
intention  of  denying  the  Godhead.  A  zealous,  self-sacriﬁcing  community 
known as a Christian community but worthy of being called “ Muslim Chris-
tians, ” will work to unite the true religion of Jesus ( Upon whom be peace ) 
with the reality of Islam and will kill and rout that society of the Dajjal under 
the leadership of Jesus ( UWP ), thus saving humanity from atheism.

That  is,  the  Third  Question.  They  say:  “ Your  former  refutations  and 
strivings in the way of Islam were not in your present style. Also you do not 
defend Islam against Europe in the manner of the philosophers and thinkers. 
Why have you changed the style of the Old Said? Why do you not act in the 
same way as those who strive for the cause of Islam by non-physical means?
T h e   A n s w e r :  The Old Said and certain thinkers in part accepted the prin-
ciples  of  human  and  European  philosophy,  and  contested  them  with  their 
own weapons; they accepted them to a degree. They submitted unshakeably 
to some of their principles in the form of the physical sciences, and therefore 
could not demonstrate the true worth of Islam. It was quite simply as though 
they were grafting Islam with the branches of philosophy, the roots of which 
they  supposed  to  be  very  deep;  as  though  strengthening  it.  But  since  this 
method  produced  few  victories  and  it  reduced  Islam’s  worth  to  a  degree, 
I  gave  it  up,  and  I  showed  in  fact  that  Islam’s  principles  are  so  profound 
that  the  deepest  principles  of  philosophy  cannot  reach  them;  indeed,  they 
remain superﬁcial beside them. The Thirtieth Word, Twenty-Fourth Letter, 
and  Twenty-Ninth  Word  have  demonstrated  this  truth  with  proofs.  In  the 
former  way,  philosophy  was  supposed  to  be  profound  and  the  matters  of 
Islam, external; it was supposed that by binding it with the branches of phi-
losophy, Islam would be preserved and made to endure. As if the principles 
of philosophy could in any way reach the matters of Islam!

which is an important principle of the science of j a f r , and a val-

First Allusion

Underlying the terms Suﬁsm, path, sainthood, and spiritual journeying is 
an agreeable, luminous, joyful, and spiritual sacred truth. This truth has been 
proclaimed, taught, and described in thousands of books written by authori-
tative scholars among the people of illumination and unveiling, who have 

told the Muslim community and us about it. اًر(cid:193)ِ(cid:103)ﯬﯦ اًرْ(cid:193)َ(cid:114) ُ

and  the  unfolding  of  the  truths  of  faith  –  through  a  spiritual  journeying 
with  the  feet  of  the  heart  under  the  shadow  of  the  Ascension  of  Muham-
mad ( UWBP ), to manifest the truths of faith and the Qur’an through tasting

and certain enhanced states, and to an extent through direct vision; it is an 
elevated human mystery and perfection called the Suﬁ path or Suﬁsm.

Yes, since man is a comprehensive index of the universe, his heart resem-
bles  a  map  of  thousands  of  worlds.  For  innumerable  human  sciences  and 
ﬁelds  of  knowledge  show  that  man’s  brain  in  his  head  is  a  sort  of  centre 
of  the  universe,  like  a  telephone  and  telegraph  exchange  for  innumerable 
lines. Similarly, the millions of light-scattering books written by incalcula-
ble saints show man’s heart in his essential being to be the place of manifes-
tation of innumerable cosmic truths, and to be their pivot, and seed.

Since the human heart and brain are thus central, and comprise the mem-
bers of a mighty tree in the form of a seed, and within them are encapsulated 
the parts and components of an eternal, majestic machine pertaining to the 
hereafter, certainly the heart’s Creator willed that it should be worked and 
brought  out  from  the  potential  to  the  actual,  and  developed,  and  put  into 
action, for that is what He did. Since He willed it, the heart will certainly 
work  like  the  mind.  And  the  most  effective  means  of  working  it  is  to  be 
turned towards the truths of faith on the Suﬁ path through the remembrance 
of Allah in the degrees of sainthood.

Second Allusion

Second Allusion

The keys and means of this journeying of the heart and spiritual progress 
are  remembrance  of  Allah  and  reﬂective  thought.  Their  virtues  are  too 
numerous to be described. Apart from uncountable beneﬁts in the hereafter 
and human attainments and perfections, a minor beneﬁt pertaining to this 
tumultuous  worldly  life  is  as  follows:  everyone  wants  a  solace  and  seeks 
enjoyment in order to be saved a little from the upheavals of life and its heavy 
burdens, and to take a breather; everyone searches out something friendly 
to banish the loneliness. For one or two people out of ten, the social gather-
ings in civilized life offer a temporary, but heedless and drunken familiarity, 
intimacy, and solace. But eighty per cent live solitary lives in mountains or 
valleys, or are driven to distant places in search of a livelihood, or due to 
such agencies as calamities or old age which recall the hereafter, they are 
deprived  of  the  companionship  of  human  groups  and  societies.  Their  cir-
cumstances allow them no familiarity, friendliness, or consolation.

For  such  a  person,  true  solace,  intimacy,  and  sweet  pleasure  are  to  be 
found in addressing his own heart in those distant places and desolate moun-
tains and distressing valleys, in working it through remembrance of Allah 
and  reﬂection.  Calling  on  Allah  Almighty,  he  may  become  intimate  with 

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – NINTH SECTION

523

Him in his heart, and by virtue of that intimacy think of the things around 
him, which were regarding him savagely, as smiling on him familiarly. He 
will say: “ My Creator, whom I am recollecting, has innumerable servants 
here  in  my  place  of  solitude,  just  as  He  has  everywhere.  I  am  not  alone; 
loneliness has no meaning. ” Thanks to his faith, he receives pleasure from 
that sense of familiarity. He grasps the meaning of life’s happiness, and he 
offers thanks to Allah.

Third Allusion

Third Allusion

Sainthood is a proof of divine messengership; the Suﬁ path is a proof of 
the  Shari‘a.  For  the  truths  of  belief  which  messengership  preaches,  saint-
hood sees and conﬁrms with a sort of direct vision with the heart and tasting 
with  the  spirit  at  the  degree  of  the  vision  of  certainty.  Its  conﬁrmation  is 
a certain proof of the veracity of messengership. Through the experiential 
knowledge of the Suﬁ path and its unveilings, and through its beneﬁts and 
effulgences, it is a clear proof of the truths and the matters which the Shari‘a 
teaches; it demonstrates that they are the truth and that they come from the 
truth.  Yes,  just  as  sainthood  and  the  Suﬁ  path  are  evidence  and  proof  of 
divine messengership and the Shari‘a, so they are a perfection of Islam and 
a means of attaining to its lights, and through Islam, a source of humanity’s 
progress and moral enlightenment.

Although this vast mystery holds such importance, certain deviant sects 
have tended to deny it. They have been deprived of those lights and they 
have caused others to be deprived. The most regretable thing is that making 
a pretext of abuses and faults they have seen committed by the followers of 
the Suﬁ path, some literalist Sunni scholars and some neglectful politicians 
who  are  also  Sunnis  are  trying  to  close  up  that  supreme  treasury,  indeed, 
to destroy it, and to dry up that source of Kawthar which distributes a sort 
of water of life. However, there are few things and ways and paths that are 
without fault and are good in every respect. They are bound to contain some 
faults and abuses. For if the uninitiated embark on something, they are sure 
to misuse it. But as with the accounting of deeds in the hereafter, Almighty 
Allah demonstrates His dominical justice through the weighing up of good 
deeds and bad deeds. That is to say, if good deeds preponderate and weigh 
heavier, He accepts them and grants reward; whereas if evil deeds prepon-
derate, he punishes for them and rejects them. The balancing of good and 
evil deeds looks to quality rather than quantity. It sometimes happens that a 
single good deed will weigh heavier than a thousand evils, and cause them 
to be forgiven. Divine justice judges thus and reality too considers it right. 

524

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

Thus, the evidence that the good deeds of the Suﬁ path – that is, paths within 
the  bounds  of  the  Prophet’s  ( UWBP )  practices  –  deﬁnitely  preponderate 
over  their  evils  is  that  those  who  follow  them  preserve  their  belief  when 
attacked by the people of misguidance. A sincere ordinary follower of the 
Suﬁ path preserves himself better than a superﬁcial, apparent Muslim with 
a modern, scientiﬁc background. Through the illumination of the Suﬁ path 
and the love of the saints, he saves his faith. If he commits grievous sins, he 
becomes a sinner but not an unbeliever; he is not easily drawn into atheism. 
No power at all can refute the chain of shaikhs he accepts, with a strong love 
and ﬁrm belief, to be spiritual poles. And because no power can refute it, his 
conﬁdence in them cannot be shaken. And so long as his conﬁdence is not 
shaken, he will not accept atheism. In the face of the atheists’ stratagems at 
the present time, it has become difﬁcult for a person unconnected with the 
Suﬁ path, whose heart has not been brought to action, to preserve himself 
completely, even if he is a learned scholar.

There is another thing; the Suﬁ path should not be condemned because 
of the evils of some orders that have adopted practices outside the bounds 
of  t a q w a ,  and  even  of  Islam,  and  have  wrongfully  called  themselves  Suﬁ 
paths. Quite apart from the elevated religious and spiritual fruits of the Suﬁ 
path and those that look to the hereafter, Suﬁ orders were the ﬁrst, and most 
effective and ardent, means of spreading and strengthening brotherhood, the 
sacred bond of the Islamic world. They were also one of the three unassail-
able strongholds of Islam, which held out against the awesome attacks of 
the world of unbelief and the politics of Christendom. What preserved Istan-
bul, the centre of the Caliphate for ﬁve hundred and ﬁfty years against the 
whole Christian world, were the lights of belief that poured out of ﬁve hun-
dred places in Istanbul and the powerful faith of those who recited “ Allah! 
Allah! ” in the t e k k e s  behind the big mosques, which were a ﬁrm source of 
support for the people of belief in that centre of Islam, and their spiritual 
love arising from knowledge of Allah, and their fervent murmurings.

O you unreasoning pseudo-patriots and false nationalists! What evils are 
there in the Suﬁ paths that can negate all this good in the life of your society? 
You say!

Fourth Allusion

Fourth Allusion

Together with being very easy, the way of sainthood is very difﬁcult. 
Together with being very short, it is very long. In addition to being most 
valuable, it is very dangerous. And together with being very broad, it is 
very narrow. It is because of these points that some of those who take the 

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – NINTH SECTION

525

path drown, others become harmful, and yet others return and lead other 
people astray.

I n   S h o r t :  There are two ways on the Suﬁ path, known by the terms of 

inner journeying and outer journeying.

The Inner Way starts from the self, and drawing the eyes away from the 
outer world, looks to the heart. It pierces egotism, opens up a way from the 
heart, and ﬁnds reality. Then it enters the outer world. The outer world then 
looks luminous. The journey is completed quickly on this way. The reality 
seen in the inner world, is seen on a large scale in the outer world. Most of 
the paths that practise silent recollection take this way. Its essential princi-
ples are breaking the ego, renouncing the desires of the ﬂesh, and killing the 
evil-commanding soul.

The Second Way starts from the outer world; it gazes on the reﬂections 
of  the  divine  names  and  attributes  in  their  places  of  manifestation  in  the 
greater sphere, then it enters the inner world. It observes their lights on a 
small scale in the sphere of the heart and opens up the shortest way within 
them. It sees that the heart is a mirror to the Eternally Besoughted One, and 
is united with the goal it is seeking.

If  people  who  travel  the  ﬁrst  way  are  unsuccessful  in  killing  the  evil-
commanding soul, and if they cannot give up the desires of the ﬂesh and 
break the ego, they fall from the rank of thanks to that of pride, then descend 
from  pride  to  conceit.  If  such  a  person  feels  the  captivation  of  love  and 
becomes  intoxicated  by  it,  he  will  make  high-ﬂown  claims  far  exceeding 
his mark, called ecstatic utterances. This is harmful both for himself and for 
others.

For  example,  if  a  lieutenant  becomes  conceited  out  of  pleasure  at  his 
position of command, he will suppose himself to be a ﬁeld marshal and will 
confuse his small sphere with the universal one. He will confuse a sun that 
appears in a small mirror with the sun whose manifestation appears in all 
its splendour on the surface of the sea, due to their similarity in one respect. 
In just the same way, there are many people of sainthood who, resem-
bling the difference between a ﬂy and a peacock, see themselves as greater 
than those who in reality are greater than them to the same degree; that is 
how they see it and they think they are right. I myself even saw someone 
whose heart had just been awakened and had faintly perceived in himself the 
mystery of sainthood; he supposed himself to be the supreme spiritual pole 
and assumed airs accordingly. I said to him: “ My brother, just as the law of 
sovereignty  has  particular  and  universal  manifestations  from  the  ofﬁce  of 

526

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

Prime Minister down to that of District Ofﬁcer, so sainthood and the rank 
of spiritual pole have varying spheres and manifestations. Each station has 
many shades and shadows. You have evidently seen the manifestation of the 
rank of supreme spiritual pole, the equivalent of Prime Minister, in your own 
sphere, which is like that of a District Ofﬁcer, and you have been deceived. 
What you saw was right, but your judgement of it was wrong. To a ﬂy, a cup 
of water is a small sea. ” The person came to his senses, Allah willing, as a 
result of this answer of mine, and was saved from the abyss.

I have also seen many people who thought themselves to be Mahdis of 
a sort, and they proclaimed their Mahdiship. Such people are not liars and 
deceivers, they are deceived. They suppose what they see to be reality. As 
the divine names have manifestations from the sphere of the Sublime Throne 
down to an atom, and their places of manifestation differ to the same degree; 
so the degrees of sainthood, which consist of manifesting the names, differ 
in the same way. The most important reason for the confusion is this:

In some of the stations of the saints, the characteristics of the Mahdi’s 
function  may  be  observed,  or  a  special  relation  may  be  formed  with  the 
Supreme Spiritual Pole, or with Khidr; certain stations are connected with 
certain famous persons. In fact, the stations are called the station of Khidr, 
the station of Uways, or the station of the Mahdi. Because of this, people 
who attain to these stations or to minor samples or shadows of them, suppose 
themselves to be the famous persons connected with them. They suppose 
themselves to be Khidr, or the Mahdi, or the Supreme Spiritual Pole. If such 
a person’s ego does not seek rank and position, he is not condemned to the 
state. His excessively high-ﬂown claims are deemed ecstatic utterances for 
which he is probably not responsible. But if his ego is secretly set on acquir-
ing  rank  and  position,  and  if  he  defeated  by  it  and  leaves  off  thanks  and 
becomes proud, from there he will gradually fall into arrogance, or descend 
to the depths of madness, or deviate from the path of truth. For he reckons 
the great saints to be like himself and his good opinion of them is spoiled, 
for however arrogant a soul is, it still perceives its own faults. Comparing 
those great saints with himself, he imagines them to be at fault. His respect 
towards the prophets diminishes, even.

Those suffering from this should hold fast to the balance of the Shari‘a, 
and  adopt  the  rules  of  the  scholars  of  the  principles  of  religion,  and  take 
as their guides the instructions of such authoritative scholars from among 
the  saints  as  Imam  Ghazali  and  Imam-i  Rabbani.  They  should  constantly 
accuse their own souls, and attribute nothing to themselves other than fault, 

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – NINTH SECTION

impotence, and want. Ecstatic utterances made by followers of this way arise 
from love of self, for love-ﬁlled eyes see no faults. Because of his self-love, 
such a person supposes a faulty, unworthy fragment of glass to be a brilliant 
or a diamond. The most dangerous of all these faults is that he imagines the 
partial meanings which occur to his heart in the form of inspiration to be 
“ Allah’s Word, ” and he calls them “ verses ( â y â t  ). ” This infers disrespect 
towards divine revelation, which is at the most holy and exalted degree. Yes, 
all inspirations from the inspirations of bees and animals to those of ordinary 
people and the elite among men, and from the inspirations of ordinary angels 
to those of the sublime cherubim, are divine words of a sort. But they are 
dominical speech in conformity with the capacity of the places of manifes-
tation and their stations; they are the varying manifestations of dominical 
address shining through seventy thousand veils.

However,  it  is  absolutely  wrong  to  use  the  proper  nouns  “ revelation ” 
and “ divine speech ” for such inspirations, and the word “ verse, ” which is a 
noun proper to the stars of the Qur’an – the most evident exempliﬁcation of 
Allah’s Word. As is explained and proved in the Twelfth, Twenty-Fifth, and 
Thirty-First Wo r d s , the relation between the inspiration in the hearts of those 
making the above claims and the verses of the sun of the Qur’an, which is 
divine speech directly, resembles the relation between the tiny, dim, obscure 
image of the sun appearing in the coloured mirror in your hand and the sun 
in the sky. Yes, if it is said that the sun’s reﬂected images appearing in all 
mirrors are the sun’s and are related to it, it would be right, but the globe of 
the earth cannot be attached to the suns in those tiny mirrors, nor be bound 
by their attraction.

Fifth Allusion

Fifth Allusion

An extremely important way within Suﬁsm is the Unity of Witnessing, 
which is another name for the Unity of Existence. This restricts the gaze to 
the existence of the Necessarily Existent, and sees other beings to be so weak 
and shadow-like in relation to Him that it declares that they do not deserve 
the name of existence. It envelops them in veils of imagination, and in the 
station of abandoning all things other than Allah, counts them as nothing. 
It even imagines them to be non-existent, and goes so far as to belittle the 
manifestations of the divine names, saying they are mere imaginary mirrors.
A signiﬁcant fact about this way is that due to the powerful faith it incul-
cates and the elevated sainthood of those on it advancing to the degree of 
absolute certainty, the existence of contingent beings is so diminished that 

528

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

nothing remains in its view other than imagination and non-existence; it is 
as though it denies the universe on account of the Necessarily Existent One.
But this way holds dangers, the ﬁrst of which is this: there are six pillars 
of faith, and such pillars as belief in the Last Day and belief in Allah require 
the  existence  of  contingent  beings.  These  ﬁrmly-founded  pillars  of  belief 
cannot be constructed on imagination! For this reason, when a person fol-
lowing this way re-enters the world of sobriety from the worlds of ecstasy 
and intoxication, he should not bring them with him, nor should he act in 
accordance with them. 

Furthermore, he should not convert this way, which pertains to the heart 
and to illuminations and certain states, into a form that pertains to the rea-
son, knowledge, and words. For the laws and principles related to reason, 
knowledge, and speech, which proceed from the Qur’an and the practices 
of the Prophet ( UWBP ), cannot sustain that way and are inapplicable to it. 
For this reason, the four Rightly-Guided Caliphs, and the leading authori-
ties and interpreters of the law, and the authorities of the ﬁrst generations of 
Islam were not seen to practise it. This means that it is not the most elevated 
way. It may be elevated, but it is also deﬁcient. It is very important, but it 
is  also  very  perilous  and  difﬁcult.  Yet,  it  is  still  very  pleasurable.  Those 
who embark on it for the pleasure, do not want to leave it, and because of 
their  self-centredness,  they  suppose  it  to  be  the  highest  degree.  We  have 
explained the basis and nature of this way to an extent in the treatise called 
N o k t a   R i s a l e s i , and in some of the Wo r d s  and L e t t e r s , and shall sufﬁce with 
them. Here, we shall describe one of the serious hazards on that important 
way. It is as follows:

For the highest of the elite, who pass beyond the sphere of causes and 
renouncing everything other than Allah, sever their attachment to contingent 
beings and enter a state of complete absorption in Allah, this way is a right-
eous way. But, to present it in terms of intellectual knowledge to those who 
are submerged in causes, are enamoured of the world, and are plunged into 
materialist philosophy and nature, will drown them in nature and materiality 
and distance them from the reality of Islam. For those who love the world 
and are attached to the sphere of causes want to ascribe a sort of permanence 
to this transitory world. They do not want to lose their beloved. On the pre-
text of the Unity of Existence, they imagine it to have permanent existence. 
On account of the world, their beloved, and by ascribing permanence and 
eternity  to  it,  they  make  it  an  object  of  worship;  and,  I  seek  refuge  with 
Allah, this paves the way to the abyss of denying Allah.

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – NINTH SECTION

This century, materialism is so widespread, materiality is thought to be 
the source of everything. If in such an age, the elite believers consider mate-
riality to be so unimportant as to be non-existent, thus furthering the way of 
the Unity of Existence, the materialists will lay claim to it, saying: “ We say 
the same thing. ” Whereas, among all the ways in the world, the one furthest 
from that of the materialists and nature-worshippers, is the way of the Unity 
of Existence. For the followers of the Unity of Existence attach such impor-
tance, due to their belief, to the divine existence that they deny the universe 
and beings. Whereas the materialists attach so much importance to beings 
that  on  account  of  the  universe  they  deny  Allah.  How  can  the  two  come 
together or be compared?

Sixth Allusion

Sixth Allusion

First Point

This consists of three points.
First Point: Among the ways of sainthood, the ﬁnest, straightest, rich-
est,  and  most  brilliant  is  following  the  practices  ( S u n n a  )  of  the  Prophet 
( UWBP ). That is, to think of the practices in one’s actions and deeds, and to 
follow and imitate them. In conduct and dealings with others, it is to think of 
the rulings of the Shari‘a and take them as one’s guide.

When  followed  in  this  way,  daily  conduct,  dealings,  and  habitual  acts 
become worship, and thinking of the practices and Shari‘a in one’s actions, 
recalls the injunctions of the Shari‘a. This causes a person to think of the 
Shari‘a’s owner. By thinking of him, it brings to mind Almighty Allah, and 
that  induces  a  sort  of  sense  of  His  presence.  This  may  transform  all  the 
moments of the person’s life into worship in the divine presence. This great 
highway  is  the  highway  of  the  Companions  and  the  righteous  of  the  ﬁrst 
generations of Islam, who received the legacy of prophethood, the greater 
sainthood.

Second Point

Second Point: Sincerity is the basis of the ways of sainthood and of the 
branches of the Suﬁ path, for through sincerity a person may be saved from 
implicitly associating partners with Allah. One who does not obtain sincer-
ity cannot travel those ways. The most powerful force of those ways is love. 
Yes, love does not seek pretexts for its beloved and does not wish to see the 
beloved’s faults. It looks on frail signs of its beloved’s perfection as power-
ful proofs, and always takes the part of its beloved.

It  is  because  of  this  that  those  who  are  turned  towards  knowledge  of 
Allah with the feet of love, do not give ear to doubts and objections; they 
are easily saved. Even a thousand satans can not negate a hint of their true 

530

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

beloved’s perfection. If they do not possess such love, they would struggle 
desperately in the face of their souls and Satan and the objections of the out-
side devils. They would have to have heroic fortitude and strength of belief 
and an attentive gaze in order to save themselves.

It is because of this that in all the degrees of sainthood, the chief leaven 
and elixir is the love arising from knowledge of Allah. But love leads to an 
abyss, which is this: it jumps from beseeching and self-effacement, which 
are  the  essence  of  worship,  to  complaint  and  claims  and  to  imbalanced 
actions. When regarding things other than Allah, a person ceases to see how 
they  point  to  their  Maker  and  starts  to  see  them  as  signifying  themselves 
alone, so while being the cure, love becomes poison. That is to say, although 
when loving things other than Allah, the person should ﬁx his heart on them 
for Allah’s sake and in His name and because they are mirrors reﬂecting His 
names, sometimes he loves them for themselves and on account of their per-
sonal perfections and own beauty. He loves them with no thought for Allah 
and  His  Messenger  ( UWBP ).  Such  love  does  not  lead  to  love  of  Allah; 
it obscures it. Whereas if the person loves those things as signifying their 
Maker,  it  leads  to  love  of  Allah;  indeed,  such  love  may  be  said  to  be  its 
manifestation.

Third Point

Third Point: This world is the realm of wisdom, the realm of service; it 
is not the realm of reward and recompense. The wage for deeds and acts of 
service here is given in the Intermediate Realm and the hereafter. Acts here 
produce fruits there. This being the truth of the matter, the results of actions 
that  look  to  the  hereafter  should  not  be  sought  in  this  world.  If  they  are 
given, they should be received not gratefully, but regretfully. For in Para-
dise, the more fruits are picked the more they grow. So it is hardly sensible 
to consume in this world in ﬂeeting fashion the fruits of actions that pertain 
to the hereafter, which are lasting. It is like exchanging a permanent lamp for 
one that will last a minute and then ﬂicker out.

It  is  because  of  this  that  the  people  of  sainthood  look  on  service,  dif-
ﬁculty,  misfortune,  and  hardship  as  agreeable.  They  do  not  complain  and 
lament, but say: “ All praise be to Allah for all situations! ” When illumina-
tions and wonders, unfoldings and lights are bestowed on them, they accept 
them as divine favours, and try to conceal them. They do not become proud, 
but offer more thanks and worship. Many of them have wanted those states 
to be concealed or to cease, lest they spoil the sincerity of their actions. Yes, 
the highest divine favour for an acceptable person is not to make him realize 
the favour, so that he does not give up beseeching and offering thanks, or 
become complacent and start complaining.

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – NINTH SECTION

531

It is because of this truth that if those who seek sainthood and follow the 
Suﬁ path do so for illuminations and wonders, which are some of the emana-
tions of sainthood, and they are turned towards those and receive pleasure 
from  them,  they  as  though  consume  in  transient  fashion  in  this  transient 
world the enduring fruits of the hereafter. This too opens up the way to loss 
of sincerity, the leaven of sainthood, and to sainthood eluding them. 

Seventh Allusion

Seventh Allusion

First Point

This consists of four points.
First Point: The Shari‘a is directly, without shadow or veil, the result 
of the divine address, through the mystery of divine oneness in respect of 
absolute dominicality. The highest degrees of the Suﬁ path and of reality are 
like parts of the Shari‘a. Or they are always like its means, introduction, and 
servant. Their results are the incontrovertible matters of the Shari‘a. That is 
to say, the ways of the Suﬁ orders and of reality are like means, servants, and 
steps for reaching the truths of the Shari‘a, till at the highest level they are 
transformed into the meaning of reality and essence of the Suﬁ way, which 
are  at  the  heart  of  the  Shari‘a.  So  then  they  become  parts  of  the  Greater 
Shari‘a. It is not right to think of the Shari‘a as an outer shell and reality as 
its inner part and result and aim, as some Suﬁs do. Yes, the Shari‘a unfolds 
according to the levels of men. It is wrong to suppose that what the mass of 
people imagine is the external aspect of the Shari‘a is its reality, and to give 
the names of reality and Suﬁ path to the degrees of the Shari‘a that are dis-
closed to the elite. The Shari‘a has degrees which look to all classes.

It is in consequence of this that the further the Suﬁs and those who seek 
reality advance, their longing for the truths of the Shari‘a increases, as does 
their captivation by them and their following them. They consider the most 
minor aspect of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices to be their greatest aim, 
and strive to follow them and imitate them. For however higher divine rev-
elation is than inspiration, the conduct of the Shari‘a, which is the fruit of 
revelation, is higher to the same degree than the conduct of the Suﬁ path, the 
fruit of inspiration. Therefore, following the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices is 
the basis and principal element of the Suﬁ path.

Second Point

Second Point: The Suﬁ path and way of reality should not exceed being 
means. If they are made the ultimate aim, the incontrovertible teachings and 
actions of the Shari‘a and following the practices of the Prophet ( UWBP ) 
become merely a matter of form, while the heart looks beyond them. That is 
to say, such a person thinks of his circle for the remembrance of Allah rather 

532

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

than the obligatory prayers; he is drawn more to his recitations and supplica-
tions than to his religious obligations; he is more concerned with avoiding 
offending against his order’s rules of behaviour than with avoiding grievous 
sins. Whereas the recitations of the Suﬁ path cannot be the equivalent of the 
obligatory acts that constitute the incontestible matters of the Shari‘a; they 
cannot  take  their  place.  The  etiquette  of  the  Suﬁ  path  and  its  invocations 
should be a solace and a way of obtaining true pleasure from the obligatory 
acts; they should not themselves be the source. That is, the t e k k e  should lead 
a person to perform the ﬁve daily prayers assiduously in the mosque. If he 
performs them there hurriedly as a formality, thinking that he will ﬁnd true 
pleasure and perfection in the tekke, he is drawing away from reality. 

Third Point

Third Point: It is sometimes asked: “ Can there be any Suﬁ path outside 

the practices of the Prophet ( UWBP ) and matters of the Shari‘a? ”

T h e   A n s w e r :  There are some such paths, and there are not. There are, 
because some of the highest saints were executed by the sword of the Shari‘a. 
And there are not, because the authoritative scholars among the saints have 
agreed on this rule of Sa‘di-i Shirazi: 
(cid:309)َ(cid:281)َ(cid:265) ْ(cid:257)ُ(cid:296)  ِ(cid:309)َ(cid:330)  ْرَد  ْ(cid:245) ُ(cid:228)  ْنَد

(cid:243)َ(cid:214) ى ِ(cid:239) ْ(cid:273) َ(cid:248)  ْ(cid:219) ْ(cid:249)َ(cid:292)א َ(cid:233)ُ(cid:296)

That is, it is impossible for one outside the highway of Allah’s Messenger 
( Upon whom be blessings and peace ), who does not follow him, to attain 
the true lights of reality. The meaning of this is as follows: 

(cid:243)َ(cid:281)َ(cid:268) * אَ(cid:281) َ(cid:256) ِها

(cid:243)ُ(cid:214) 

Allah’s Messenger ( Peace and blessings be upon him ) was the Seal of the 
Prophets and the addressee of Allah in the name of all mankind; mankind, 
therefore, cannot advance outside his highway; it is essential to be under his 
banner. But since ecstatics and those immersed in divine contemplation are 
not responsible for their opposition; and since man possesses certain subtle 
faculties  that  are  not  held  accountable,  and  when  such  faculties  dominate 
a person, he cannot be held responsible for opposing the obligations of the 
Shari‘a;  and  since  man  possesses  subtle  faculties  that  just  as  they  are  not 
accountable,  so  they  are  not  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  will  and  cannot 
be controlled by the mind, for they do not heed the heart or the mind; cer-
tainly, when those faculties dominate in a person, – but only at that time – he 
does not fall from the rank of sainthood by opposing the Shari‘a, he is held 
excused. On condition, however, that he does not deny or insult the truths of 
the Shari‘a and rules of belief, or display contempt towards them. Even if he 
does not carry out the injunctions, he has to acknowledge that they are right. 
But if he is overcome by that state and assumes a position, I seek refuge with 

ْ

َ
TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – NINTH SECTION

533

Allah, which infers denial and giving the lie to those incontestible truths, it 
is the sign that he has deviated from the path!

In  Short:  There  are  two  groups  that  follow  the  Suﬁ  path  outside  the 

bounds of the Shari‘a.

O n e   g r o u p :  As described above, these people are either overwhelmed by 
their mental state, immersion, or ecstasy or intoxication, or they are domi-
nated by some of their subtle faculties that do not heed the injunctions of 
religion  nor  listen  to  the  will;  they  therefore  transgress  the  bounds  of  the 
Shari‘a. But this is not due to their disliking its rulings or not wanting to 
follow them; they are rather compelled to, involuntarily. Among this group 
are people of sainthood some of whom have even been temporary saints of 
high rank. But the authoritative scholars from among the saints have ruled 
that of these some have been not only outside the bounds of the Shari‘a, but 
outside the bounds of Islam. But they are considered to be people of saint-
hood on condition they have not denied any of the injunctions brought by 
Muhammad ( Peace and blessings be upon him ). It is that they do not think 
of them, or cannot keep them in view, or are not aware of them. They cannot 
not accept them if they are aware of them.

A s   f o r   t h e   S e c o n d   G r o u p ,  they are carried away by the brilliant pleasures 
of the Suﬁ path and way of reality, and since they cannot attain to the pleas-
ures of the truths of the Shari‘a, which are far more elevated, they suppose 
them to be dull formalities and are indifferent towards them. They gradually 
accept the idea that the Shari‘a is an external shell, and that the reality they 
have found is the essential goal. They say: “ I have found it; it is enough for 
me, ” and act in a way contrary to the injunctions of the Shari‘a. Any in this 
group who are in their right minds are responsible; they stray from the path, 
indeed, become the playthings of Satan to an extent.

Fourth Point

Fourth Point: Some persons who belong to the divisions of the people 
of misguidance and innovation are found acceptable by the Muslim commu-
nity, while others, just like them and not apparently different, are rejected. 
I  always  used  to  wonder  about  this.  For  example,  although  someone  like 
Zamakhshari was one of the most bigoted members of the Mu‘tazilite sect, 
the  authoritative  Sunni  scholars  did  not  pronounce  him  an  unbeliever  or 
misguided, despite his severe objections; they rather searched for a way to 
exonerate him. But then they held that Mu‘tazilite authorities like Abu ‘Ali 
Jubba’i, who was far less bigoted than Zamakhshari, should be rejected and 
refuted. I was curious about this for a long time. Then through divine grace 

534

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

I understood that Zamakhshari’s objections about the Sunnis arose from his 
love of his way, which he looked on as right. 

That  is  to  say,  for  example,  in  his  view  Allah  could  be  truly  declared 
free of all fault and defect by saying that animals create their own actions. 
It was out of love for declaring Allah free of all fault that he did not accept 
the Sunnis’ principles concerning the creation of actions. Whereas the other 
Mu‘tazilite authorities were rejected because their inadequate intelligences 
could not aspire to the elevated principles of the Sunnis and they could not 
ﬁt the Sunnis’ extensive laws within their own narrow ideas, and so denied 
them. In the same way that the Mu‘tazilites opposed the Sunnis in theology, 
so the opposition of some followers of the Suﬁ path outside the Prophet’s 
( UWBP ) practices is of two kinds:

T h e   ﬁ r s t :   Like  Zamakhshari,  out  of  love  for  their  way  or  state,  they 
remain  somewhat  indifferent  towards  the  conduct  of  the  Shari‘a,  because 
through it they cannot obtain the same degree of pleasure.

A s  f o r  t h e  o t h e r  k i n d :  Allah forbid! They think the conduct of the Shari‘a 
is unimportant relatively to the principles of the Suﬁ path. For their narrow 
understandings  cannot  comprehend  those  broad  pleasures,  and  their  short 
stations cannot attain to that elevated conduct.

Eighth Allusion

Eighth Allusion

The First

This describes eight abysses.
The First: Some people who embark on spiritual journeying do not con-
form completely to the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices, and fall into the abyss 
of preferring sainthood to prophethood. It is proved in the Twenty-Fourth 
and Thirty-First Wo r d s  how elevated is prophethood, and how dull sainthood 
is in relation to it.

The Second

The Second: Some of followers of the Suﬁ path fall into the abyss of 
preferring extremist saints to the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) Companions and even 
of believing those saints to be prophets. It is proved decisively in the Twelfth 
and Twenty-Seventh Wo r d s  and in the Addendum on the Companions, that 
the  Companions  acquired  such  qualities  through  conversation  with  the 
Prophet  ( UWBP )  that  cannot  be  attained  through  sainthood,  and  that  the 
Companions  cannot  be  surpassed,  and  that  the  saints  can  never  reach  the 
degree of the Companions.

The Third

The Third: Some of those who are excessively bigoted concerning the 
Suﬁ path oppose the practices of the Prophet ( UWBP ) and give them up 
because of their preference for the customs, conduct, and recitations of the 

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – NINTH SECTION

535

Suﬁ way, which they never give up. In this way, they become slack in prac-
tising the conduct of the Shari‘a, and fall into that abyss.

As is proved in many of the  Wo r d s , and as veracious authorities of the 
Suﬁ  path  like  Imam  Ghazali  and  Imam-i  Rabbani  said:  “ The  degree  of 
acceptance gained by following a single of the Prophet’s ( UWBP ) practices 
cannot be won through a hundred personal practices and supererogatory acts 
of worship. And just as a single obligatory act is superior to a thousand acts 
taken from the Prophet’s practices, so a single of those practices is superior 
to a thousand practices of Suﬁsm. ”

The Fourth

The Fourth: Some extremist Suﬁs suppose inspiration to be like divine 
revelation  and  of  similar  kind  to  revelation,  and  fall  into  an  abyss.  It  has 
been proved most deﬁnitely in the Twelfth Word and in the Twenty-Fifth 
Word about the miraculousness of the Qur’an, how elevated, universal, and 
sacred is divine revelation, and how insigniﬁcant and dull inspirations are 
in comparison.

The Fifth

The  Fifth:  Some  Suﬁs  who  do  not  understand  the  essence  of  the  Suﬁ 
path, in order to strengthen the weak, encourage the slack, and to lighten the 
hardships and weariness arising from strenuous service, ﬁnd the lights, illu-
minations, and wonders, which are not sought but given, to be pleasurable, 
and  they  become  captivated  by  them  and  fall  into  the  abyss  of  preferring 
them to worship, acts of service, and recitation of supplications. It is men-
tioned brieﬂy in the Third Point of the Sixth Allusion in the present treatise 
and  proved  decisively  in  others  of  the  Wo r d s   that  this  world  is  the  realm 
of service and not the realm of reward. People who seek their recompense 
here, both transform enduring, perpetual fruits into a transitory, temporary 
form, and ﬁnd permanence in this world pleasing, so they do not yearn for 
the Intermediate Realm. Quite simply, they love the life of this world in one 
respect, since they ﬁnd a sort of hereafter within it.

The Sixth

The Sixth: Some of those who embark on spiritual journeying fall into 
an abyss by confusing the shades and shadows and partial samples of the 
stations of sainthood with its fundamental, universal stations. As is proved 
clearly in the Second Branch of the Twenty-Fourth Word and in others of 
the Wo r d s , the sun becomes numerous by means of mirrors and thousands of 
its similitudes possess light and heat like the sun itself, despite their paltri-
ness in relation to the actual sun. In exactly the same way, the stations of the 
prophets and the great saints possess shades and shadows. Those who jour-
ney with the spirit enter these, and see themselves as greater than those great 
saints, or even to have advanced further than the prophets, and so fall into 

536

an abyss. However, the way to avoid this is to always take the principles of 
belief and fundamentals of the Shari‘a as one’s basis and guide, and to look 
on one’s illuminations and visions as opposed to them.

The Seventh

The Seventh: Some of the people of illumination and ecstasy fall into an 
abyss in their spiritual journeyings by preferring pride, complaint, ecstatic 
utterances, public regard, and being referred to, to offering thanks and sup-
plication,  beseeching  Almighty  Allah,  and  self-sufﬁciency.  Whereas  the 
highest degree is Muhammadan worship, which is termed “ belovedness. ” 
The basis and essence of worship is to manifest the perfection of that real-
ity  by  supplicating  and  beseeching  Almighty  Allah,  showing  deep  humil-
ity before Him, offering thanks, and through impotence and want, and by 
displaying  self-sufﬁciency  in  the  face  of  others.  Some  of  the  great  saints 
have  involuntarily  and  temporarily  become  proud  and  made  complaints 
and ecstatic utterances, but they should not be followed voluntarily on such 
points; they are rightly-guided but not the guide; their way may not be taken!
The Eighth Abyss: Some of those who journey spiritually are self-cen-
tred and precipitate and want to consume in this world the fruits of saint-
hood, which will be given in the hereafter; they fall into an abyss by seeking 
them on their spiritual journeyings. But, as such verses as, 

The Eighth

( 3:185 ) ¨ § ¦ ¥ ¤ £ 
proclaim, and as is proved decisively in many of the  Wo r d s , a single fruit 
in  the  realm  of  eternity  is  superior  to  a  thousand  gardens  in  this  ﬂeeting 
world. For this reason, those blessed fruits should not be consumed here. If 
without being sought they are given to eat here, they should be thanked for, 
and deemed divine favours bestowed, not as reward, but for encouragement.

beneﬁts of the Suﬁ path.

The First

Here we shall describe brieﬂy nine out of the truly numerous fruits and 

T h e   F i r s t  is the unfolding and clariﬁcation, by means of the Suﬁ paths 
that are on the straight way, of the truths of faith, which are the keys, sources, 
and springs of the eternal treasuries of everlasting happiness; it is their mani-
festation at the degree of the vision of certainty.

The Second

T h e   S e c o n d :   Since  the  Suﬁ  path  is  a  means  of  working  the  heart,  the 
mainspring of the human machine, and of causing it to stir the other subtle 
faculties into motion, it drives them to fulﬁl the purposes of their creation 
and thus makes a person into a true human being.

The Third

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – NINTH SECTION

537

T h e   T h i r d :  On the journey to the Intermediate Realm and the hereafter, 
it is to join one of the lines of the Suﬁ orders, and become a member of its 
luminous  caravan  on  the  road  to  eternity.  The  person  is  thus  saved  from 
loneliness and ﬁnds the friendship of the other members in this world and 
in the Intermediate Realm; and relying on their consensus and accord in the 
face of the attacks of doubts and fears, and seeing each of their masters as 
a powerful support and proof, he repulses through them those doubts and 
instances of misguidance.

The Fourth

T h e   F o u r t h  is to understand by means of the pure Suﬁ way the knowl-
edge of Allah to be found in belief in Allah, and the pleasure of love of Allah 
within the knowledge of Allah, and by so understanding, to be saved from 
the desolation of this world and man’s exile in the universe. We have proved 
in many of the Wo r d s  that the happiness of both worlds, and pain-free pleas-
ure, and intimacy untainted by loneliness, and true delight, and untroubled 
happiness are all to be found in faith and the reality of Islam. As is explained 
in the Second Word, faith produces the seed of a Tuba tree of Paradise. It is 
through the training and nurturing of the Suﬁ path that the seed grows and 
develops.

The Fifth

T h e   F i f t h  is to perceive through an awakening of the heart elicited by the 
Suﬁ path and remembrance of Allah, the subtle truths contained in the obli-
gations of the Shari‘a, and to appreciate them. Then the person obeys and 
performs his worship, not under compulsion, but with longing.

The Sixth

T h e   S i x t h  is to rise to the station of reliance on Allah and the rank of sub-
mission to Him and winning His pleasure, which are the means of obtain-
ing true delight, real solace, painfree pleasure, and friendship untainted by 
loneliness.

The Seventh

T h e   S e v e n t h   is,  through  sincerity,  which  is  the  essential  precondition 
for travelling the Suﬁ way and its most valuable result, to be delivered from 
base qualities like implicitly associating partners with Allah, hypocrisy, and 
artiﬁciality. It is also to be saved, through purifying the soul, which is like 
the  surgical  operation  of  the  Suﬁ  path,  from  the  dangers  of  the  evil-com-
manding soul and the perils of egotism.

The Eighth

T h e   E i g h t h :  Through the regard, sense of the divine presence, and pow-
erful intentions of the Suﬁ path, gained by recalling Allah with the heart and 
reﬂecting on Him with the mind, this is to transform customary actions into 
worship and make mundane dealings into actions beneﬁting the hereafter. 
Utilizing the capital of life, it is to make all its minutes into seeds that will 
produce the shoots of eternal happiness.

538

The Ninth

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

T h e   N i n t h  is to struggle to be a perfect human being through journey-
ing with the heart and striving with the spirit and spiritual progress; that is 
to say, to be a true believer and total Muslim; that is, to gain not superﬁcial 
belief, but the reality of belief and the reality of Islam; that is, to be directly 
the bondsman of the Glorious Creator of the Universe, in the universe and 
in one respect as the universe’s representative, and to be His addressee, and 
friend, and beloved, and to be a mirror to Him; and through showing man to 
be on the best of patterns, it is to prove man’s superiority to the angels. It is 
to ﬂy through the lofty stations with the Shari‘a’s wings of faith and works, 
and to behold eternal happiness in this world, and even to enter upon it.

Addendum 

[ This short addendum has great importance; it is beneﬁcial for everyone. ]

(cid:2)(cid:3)
The ways leading to Almighty Allah are truly numerous. While all true 
ways are taken from the Qur’an, some are shorter, safer, and more general 
than others. Of these ways taken from the Qur’an is that of impotence, pov-
erty, compassion, and reﬂection, from which, with my defective understand-
ing, I have beneﬁted.

Like ecstatic love, impotence is a path which, by way of worship, leads 
to winning Allah’s love; but it is safer. Poverty too leads to the divine name 
All-Merciful.  And,  like  ecstatic  love,  compassion  leads  to  the  name  All-
Compassionate, but it is a swifter and broader path. Also like ecstatic love, 
reﬂection  leads  to  the  name  All-Wise,  but  it  is  richer,  broader,  and  more 
brilliant path. This path consists not of ten steps like the ten subtle faculties 
of some of the Suﬁ paths employing silent recollection, nor of seven stages 
like the seven souls of those practising public recitation, but of four steps. It 
is reality ( h a k i k a t  ), rather than a Suﬁ way ( t a r i k a t  ). It is Shari‘a.

However, let it not be misunderstood. It means to see one’s impotence, 
poverty and faults before Almighty Allah, not to fabricate them or display 
them to people. The method of this short path is to follow the practices of 
the Prophet ( UWBP ), perform the religious obligations and give up serious 
sins.  It  is  especially  to  perform  the  prescribed  prayers  correctly  and  with 
attention, and following them to say the t e s b i h a t .

The verse,  ( 53:32 ) « ª ©  points to the ﬁrst step.
The  verse,  ( 59:19 )  G F E D C B A  points  to  the 

second step.

The verse,  ( 4:79 ) ã â á à ß Þ Ý Ü Û Ú Ù Ø × points 

to the third step.

The verse,  ( 28:88 ) j i h g f  points to the fourth step.
A brief explanation of these four steps is as follows:

First Step

539

540

First Step

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

As the verse,   « ª ©  suggests, it is to not purify the soul. For 
on account of his nature and innate disposition, man loves himself. Indeed, 
he loves himself before anything else, and only himself. He sacriﬁces eve-
rything  other  than  himself  to  his  own  soul.  He  praises  himself  in  a  man-
ner  beﬁtting  some  object  worthy  of  worship.  He  absolves  and  exonerates 
himself  from  faults  in  the  same  way.  As  far  as  he  possibly  can,  he  does 
not see faults as being appropriate for him, and does not accept them. He 
defends himself passionately as though worshipping himself. Even, using on 
himself the members and faculties given him as part of his nature in order 
to praise and glorify the True Object of Worship, he displays the meaning 
of the verse, ( 25:43 ) Ä Ã Â Á  He considers himself, he relies on 
himself, he fancies himself. Thus, his puriﬁcation and cleansing at this stage, 
in this step, is to not purify himself; it is not to absolve himself.

Second Step

Second Step

As  the  verse,  G F E D C B A  teaches,  man  is 
oblivious  of  himself  and  not  aware  of  himself.  If  he  thinks  of  death,  it  is 
in relation to others. If he sees transience and decline, he does not attribute 
them to himself. His evil-commanding soul demands that when it comes to 
inconvenience and service of others, he forgets himself, but when it comes 
to  receiving  his  recompense,  and  to  beneﬁts  and  enjoyment,  he  thinks  of 
himself  and  takes  his  own  part  fervently.  His  puriﬁcation,  cleansing,  and 
training at this stage is the reverse of this. That is to say, when oblivious of 
himself, it is not to be oblivious. That is, to forget himself when it comes to 
pleasure, and ambition and greed, and to think of himself when it comes to 
death and service of others.

Third Step

Third Step

As the verse, 

 ã â á à ß Þ Ý Ü Û Ú Ù Ø × teaches, 
the  nature  of  the  evil-commanding  soul  demands  that  it  always  considers 
goodness to be from itself and it becomes vain and conceited. Thus, at this 
step, a person sees only faults, defects, impotence, and poverty in himself, 
and understands 
that all his good qualities and perfections are bounties bestowed on him by 
the All-Glorious Creator. He gives thanks instead of being conceited, and 
offers praise instead of boasting. According to the meaning of the verse, 

TWENTY-NINTH LETTER – ADDENDUM

541

( 91:9 ) C B A @
his puriﬁcation at this stage is to know his perfection to lie in imperfection, 
his power in impotence, and his wealth in poverty.

Fourth Step

Fourth Step

As the verse, j i h g f teaches, the evil-commanding soul 
considers  itself  to  be  free  and  independent  and  to  exist  of  itself.  Because 
of this, man claims to possess a sort of dominicality. He harbours a hostile 
rebelliousness  towards  his  True  Object  of  Worship.  Thus,  through  under-
standing the following fact, he is saved from this. The fact is this:

According to the apparent meaning of things, which looks to each thing 
itself, everything is transitory, wanting, accidental, non-existent. But accord-
ing to the meaning that signiﬁes something other than itself and in respect 
of each thing being a mirror to the All-Glorious Maker’s names and charged 
with various duties, each is a witness, it is witnessed, and it is existent. The 
puriﬁcation and cleansing of a person at this stage is as follows:

In his existence he is non-existent, and in his non-existence he has exist-
ence. That is to say, if he values himself and attributes existence to himself, 
he is in the darkness of non-existence as great as the universe. That is, if 
he relies on his individual existence and is unmindful of the True Giver of 
Existence, he has an individual light of existence like that of a ﬁreﬂy and is 
submerged in an endless darkness of non-existence and separation. But if 
he gives up egotism and sees that he is a mirror of the manifestations of the 
True Giver of Existence, he gains all beings and an inﬁnite existence. For 
he who ﬁnds the Necessary Existent, the manifestation of whose names all 
beings manifest, ﬁnds everything.

Conclusion

Conclusion
The four steps in this way of impotence, poverty, compassion, and reﬂec-
tion have been explained in the twenty-six Wo r d s  so far written, which are 
concerned with knowledge of reality, the reality of the Shari‘a, and the wis-
dom of the Qur’an. So here, we shall allude brieﬂy to only one or two points, 
as follows:

This path is shorter, because it consists of four steps. When impotence 
causes a person to give up the soul, it turns him directly to the All-Powerful 
One of Glory. Whereas when a person on the way of ecstatic love, the swift-
est way, gives up the soul, his way directs him to a temporary beloved. Only 

542

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

when  he  discovers  the  beloved’s  impermanence  does  he  turn  to  the  True 
Beloved.

Also, this path is much safer, because the ravings and high-ﬂown claims 
of  the  soul  are  not  present  on  it.  For  apart  from  impotence,  poverty,  and 
defect, the soul possesses nothing so that it oversteps its mark.

Also,  this  path  is  much  broader  and  more  universal.  For  in  order  to 
attain  to  a  constant  awareness  of  Allah’s  presence,  a  person  is  not  com-
pelled  to  imagine  the  universe  to  be  condemned  to  non-existence  and  to 
declare: “ There is no existent but He, ” like those who believe in the Unity 
of Existence, nor to suppose the universe to be condemned to imprisonment 
in absolute oblivion and to say, “ There is nothing witnessed but He, ” like 
those who believe in the Unity of Witnessing. Rather, since the Qur’an has 
most  explicitly  pardoned  the  universe  and  released  it  from  execution  and 
imprisonment, the person on this path disregards the above, and dismissing 
beings from working on their own account and employing them on account 
of the All-Glorious Creator, and in the duty of manifesting the Most Beauti-
ful Names and being mirrors to them, he considers them from the point of 
view of signifying something other than themselves; and being saved from 
absolute heedlessness, he enters the divine presence permanently; he ﬁnds a 
way leading to the Almighty Allah in everything.

In Short: Dismissing beings from working on account of other beings, 

this way is to not look at them as signifying themselves.

ﬁve years ago called H a k i k a t   Ç e k i r d e k l e r i . ]

PREFACE t o   t h e   o r i g i n a l   e d i t i o n :
For  some  time  now,  my  uncle  considers  matters  with  the  heart  alone, 
rather than with the intellect. If something is imparted to his heart clearly, 
he gets me to write it down. He says: “ Knowledge is that which settles in 
the  heart.  It  is  valueless  if  it  is  grasped  with  the  intellect  alone. ”  And  he 
says: “ These matters are not only scholarly rules; they are ﬁrm, heart-felt 
principles of mine that are rooted in my conscience. ” He told me to choose 
those I wanted from these aphorisms, which are “ inspirations of the heart, ” 
and I have shown the works from which they are selected: N o k t a   m i n   N u r i  
M a ‘ r i f e t i ’ l l a h ;  I s h a r a t   a l - I ‘ j a z ;  S u n û h a t ;  Ş u a ‘ a t   M a ‘ r i f e t i ’ n - N e b i ;  R u m û z ;

1. The prescription for a sick age, an ailing nation, an ill member, is to follow 

the Qur’an.

2. The prescription for a glorious though unfortunate continent, an illustrious 
though hapless state, a noble though ownerless people, is Islamic Unity.
3.  Someone  who  lacks  the  strength  to  raise  and  turn  the  earth  and  all  the 
stars and suns as though they were the beads of a t e s b i h  cannot lay claim 
to creating anything in the universe. For everything is tied to everything 
else.

4. The raising to life of all animate beings at the resurrection of the dead 
can be no more difﬁcult for divine power than restoring to life a ﬂy in 
the spring, heavy with the death-stained sleep of winter. For pre-eternal 
power  is  essential;  it  does  not  change;  impotence  cannot  penetrate  it; 
obstacles cannot intervene in it; there can be no degrees in it; everything 
is the same in relation to it.

5. Whoever created the mosquito’s eye, created the sun.
6. Whoever ordered the ﬂea’s stomach, ordered the solar system.
7.  There  is  such  miraculousness  in  the  universe’s  compilation  that  if 
to  suppose  the  impossible  all  natural  causes  possessed  will  and  the 
power  to  act,  they  would  still  prostrate  in  utter  impotence  before  such

8. An actual effect has not been given to causes, for divine unity and glory 
require it to be thus. Only, in the outer aspect of things, causes are a veil 
to the hand of power; and this, divine dignity and grandeur require, so 
that in the superﬁcial view the hand of power should not be seen to be 
directly in contact with lowly things.

SEEDS OF REALITY

545

10. The Manifest World is a lace veil strewn over the Worlds of the Unseen.
11. An  inﬁnite  power  sufﬁcient  to  create  all  the  universe  is  necessary  to 
create a single point and set it in its place. For every letter of this mighty 
book  of  the  universe,  and  particularly  all  its  living  letters,  has  a  face 
looking to all the sentences and an eye that beholds them.

12. It is well-known: they all looked for the crescent moon of the ‘Id, but no 
one could see it. An elderly man swore he had seen it. But what he had 
seen was not the crescent moon; it was a curved white eyelash. What is an 
eyelash compared with the moon? What is the motion of minute particles 
compared with the one who fashions all beings?

13. Nature resembles a printing-press, not the printer. It is an embroidery, 
not the Embroiderer. It is passive, not active. It is a pattern, not a source. 
It is an order, and not the Orderer. It is a law, not a power. It is a code of 
laws proceeding from a will, not an external reality.

14. The lure and attraction in the conscience, which is the essential nature of 

conscious beings, is felt through the appeal of a drawing truth.

15. The essential nature of beings does not lie. The inclination to grow in 
a seed declares: “ I shall sprout and produce fruit! ” It speaks the truth. 
An egg displays the desire for life; it says: “ I shall be a hen!, ” and this 
comes about, with divine permission. It speaks the truth. Owing to the 
inclination  to  freeze,  a  handful  of  water  says:  “ I  shall  take  up  more 
space!, ” and unyielding iron cannot give it the lie; the rightness of its 
words  splits  the  iron.  These  inclinations  are  the  manifestations  of  the 
creative commands proceeding from divine will.

16. Pre-eternal power, which does not leave ants without a prince or bees 
without  a  queen,  certainly  does  not  leave  mankind  without  prophets. 
As  the  Splitting  of  the  Moon  was  a  miracle  of  Muhammad  ( UWBP ) 
for men in the Manifest World, so his Ascension was a supreme miracle 
before the angels and spirit beings in the World of the Inner Dimensions 
of Things. Through this clear wonder, the sainthood of his prophethood 
was proved, and like lightning or the moon, that shining Being scattered 
light through those inner worlds.

17. The two phrases of the confession of faith testify to each other. The ﬁrst 
is the proof of cause to effect of the second, while the second is the proof 
of effect to cause of the ﬁrst.

18. Life is a sort of manifestation of unity within multiplicity, and therefore 

leads to unity. Life makes one thing the owner of everything.

546

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

19. Spirit is a law possessing external existence, a conscious law. Like the 
stable and enduring laws of creation, spirit comes from the World of the 
Divine  Command  and  the  attribute  of  will.  Divine  power  clothes  it  an 
existence decked out with senses. He makes a subtle, ﬂowing being the 
shell to that jewel. Existent spirit is the brother of the conceivable law. 
Both are enduring and come from the World of the Divine Command. 
If  pre-eternal  power  had  clothed  the  laws  governing  in  the  species  of 
beings  in  external  existence,  they  would  have  been  spirits. And  if  the 
spirit banishes consciousness, it still would be an undying law.

20. Beings are visible through light, and their existence is known through 

life. Both are revealers.

21. Christianity will either erupt, or being puriﬁed will lay down its arms 
before Islam. It was split apart several times and Protestantism emerged. 
Then  Protestantism  was  rent  and  approached  the  true  afﬁrmation  of 
divine unity. It is preparing to be rent again. It will either erupt and be 
extinguished, or it will see before it the truths of Islam, which encompass 
the basis of true Christianity, and it will lay down its arms.

The Prophet Muhammad ( Upon whom be blessings and peace ) alluded to 
this  great  mystery  when  he  said:  “ Jesus  will  come  having  descended 
from the skies; he will be of my community and will act in accordance 
with my Shari‘a. ” 1

22. It is the sacredness of the authority more than proof that drives the mass 

of the people to comply with it.

23. The essentials and incontestable matters of religion, which form ninety-
nine per cent, are each diamond pillars, while the controversial matters 
which are open to interpretation form only ten per cent. Ninety diamond 
pillars  may  not  be  put  under  the  protection  of  ten  gold  pillars.  Books 
and interpretations should be telescopes for observing the Qur’an; they 
should be mirrors; not shadows or deputies!

24. Anyone who is capable may make interpretations of the law for his own 

self; but he cannot make the law.

25.  Calling  others  to  accept  an  idea  is  dependent  on  acceptance  by  the 

‘ulama; otherwise it is innovation, and should be rejected.

26. Since by nature man is noble, he seeks the truth. Sometimes he encounters 
the false, but supposing it to be the truth preserves it in his heart. Then,

when delving into reality, without his willing it misguidance strikes him 
on the head; supposing it to be reality, he plunges his head into it.

27. Divine power has many mirrors, each more subtle and transparent than 
the  last;  they  vary  from  water  to  air,  and  air  to  ether,  and  ether  to  the 
World  of  Similitudes;  from  the  World  of  Similitudes  to  the  World  of 
Spirits, and even to time, and to thought. A single word in the mirror of 
the air becomes millions of words. The Pen of Power writes this mystery 
of reproduction in truly wondrous manner. The reﬂection contains either 
its identity or its identity together with its nature. The images of dense 
beings are moving but dead. While the images of a luminous spirit in their 
own mirrors are living and linked with it; even if they are not identical, 
they are not other than it.

28.  Since  the  sun  shakes  itself  in  its  axial  rotation,  its  fruits  do  not  fall; 
whereas if it did not shake itself, the planets would fall and be scattered.
29. If the light of thought is not illuminated with the light of the heart and 
blended  with  it,  it  is  darkness  and  breeds  tyranny.  If  the  white  of  the 
eye, which resembles day, were not together with its black pupil, which 
resembles  night,  the  eye  would  not  be  the  eye;  it  would  be  unseeing. 
Similarly, if the black core of the heart is not present in white thought, it 
lacks insight. 

30. If knowledge lacks the insight of the heart, it is ignorance. Taking the 

part of something is one thing, belief is something else.

31. Embroidering meaningless things is for misleading simple minds.
32. A learned guide should be a sheep, not a bird. A sheep gives its lamb 

milk, while a bird gives its chick regurgitated food.

33. The existence of something is dependent on the existence of all its parts. 
As for non-existence, since it occurs though non-existence of one part, a 
weak man supports destruction in order to demonstrate his power; he acts 
negatively instead of positively.

34.  If  the  laws  of  government  are  not  combined  with  the  principles  of 
wisdom, and the bonds of force not combined with the laws of truth, they 
will not be fruitful among the mass of the people.

35.  Tyranny  has  donned  the  hat  of  justice;  treachery  has  clothed  itself  in 
the garment of patriotism;  j i h a d  has been given the name of rebellion; 
captivity has been called freedom! Opposites have exchanged forms!

36. Politics which revolves around beneﬁt is savagery.

37. To show friendliness towards a hungry beast excites not its compassion 

but its hunger. Both its fangs and its claws will want their rent!
38. Time has shown that Paradise is not cheap, nor Hell unnecessary.
39. While  the  qualities  of  those  known  by  the  world  as  the  upper  classes 
should be the cause of modesty and humility, they have led to oppression 
and arrogance. And while the poverty and powerlessness of the poor and 
common  people  should  be  the  cause  of  compassion  and  bounty,  they 
have resulted in servitude and enthralment.

40. So long as honour and good things are to be obtained from something, 
they offer it to the upper classes, but if it is something bad, they divide it 
among the ordinary people.

41. If a person lacks an imagined goal, or if he forgets it or pretends to for 

get it, his thoughts will perpetually revolve around his ‘I’.

42. The origin of all revolutions and corruption, and the spur and source of 

all bad morals are just two sayings:
The First Saying: “ So long as I’m full, what is it to me if others die of 
hunger? ”
The Second Saying: “ You suffer hardship so that I can live in ease; you 
work so that I can eat. ”
There is only one remedy for extirpating the ﬁrst saying, and that is the 
obligatory payment of z a k a t . While the remedy for the second is the pro-
hibition of usury and interest. Qur’anic justice stands at the door of the 
world  and  says  to  usury  and  interest:  “ No  entry!  It  is  forbidden!  You 
don’t have the right to enter here! ” Mankind did not heed the command, 
and received a severe blow. So it must heed it before it receives one even 
more severe!

43. War between nations and states is relinquishing its place to war between 
the classes of mankind. For just as man does not want to be a slave, so he 
does not want to be a labourer.

44. The person who pursues his goal by illicit means is usually punished by 
receiving  the  opposite  of  what  he  intended. The  recompense  for  illicit 
love, like love for Europe, is the beloved’s cruel enmity.

45.  The  past  and  calamities  should  be  considered  in  the  light  of  divine 
determining ( k a d e r  ), while the future and sins from the point of view 
of responsibility before Allah. The Jabriyya and Mu‘tazila are reconciled 
on this point.

46. Impotence should not be resorted to when a solution may be found, and 

when there is no solution, punishment should not be resorted to.

47. Life’s wounds may be healed, but Islamic pride and honour, and national 

pride, their wounds are extremely deep.

48. It sometimes happens that a single word causes an army to perish, and 
one bullet leads to the annihilation of thirty million.  1 Some conditions 
are such that a small act raises man to the highest of the high, while in 
others a small action relegates him to the lowest of the low.

49.  One  grain  of  truth  consumes  a  stack  of  lies.  One  grain  of  reality  is 

superior to a stack of illusions.

Everything you say should be true, but it is not right to say everything true.

50. A person who sees the good in things has good thoughts. And he who has 

good thoughts receives pleasure from life.

51. What gives life to people is hope; what kills them is despair.
52. Since early days, this Islamic state took on itself the upholding of the 
Word of Allah, the maintenance of independence, and jihad for Islam, an 
obligation which if undertaken by part of the community, released the rest; 
it considered itself to be charged with sacrificing itself for Islam, which 
was  united,  and  carrying  the  banner  of  the  Caliphate.  The  misfortune 
it  now  suffers  will  therefore  be  made  up  for  by  the  future  prosperity 
and freedom of the Islamic World. For this calamity has speeded up in 
wondrous fashion the growth of Islamic brotherhood, the leaven of our 
lives.

53. To attribute to Christianity the virtues of civilization, which are not its 
property, and to show retrogression, the enemy of Islam, to be its friend, 
is to suggest that the ﬁrmament is revolving in the opposite direction.
54. A tarnished, matchless diamond is always superior to a piece of glistening 

glass.

55. Those who seek everything in materiality know only what their eyes see, 

and such eyes are blind in spiritual matters.

56.  If  metaphors  fall  from  the  hands  of  learning  into  those  of  ignorance, 
they  are  transformed  into  their  literal  meanings,  opening  the  door  to 
superstition.

1.  A single bullet ﬁred by a Serbian soldier at the Austrian crown-prince set off the 

Great War, and was the cause of thirty million souls being lost.

that allows for the happiness of all, or at least of the majority.  M o d e r n

Its point of support is force, the mark of which is aggression.
Its aim and goal is beneﬁt, the mark of which is jostling and tussling.
Its principle in life is conﬂict, the mark of which is strife.
The  bond  between  the  masses  is  racialism  and  negative  nationalism, 
which are nourished through devouring others; their mark is collision.
Its enticing service is inciting lust and passion and gratifying the appe-
tites. But lust transforms man into a beast.

Its point of support is truth instead of force, the mark of which is justice 
and harmony. 
Its goal is virtue in place of beneﬁt, the mark of which is love and attrac-
tion. 
Its means of unity are the ties of religion, country, and class, in place of 
racialism and nationalism, and the mark of these is sincere brotherhood, 
peace, and only defence against external aggression. 
In life its principle is mutual assistance instead of conﬂict, the mark of 
which is accord and solidarity. 
And it offers guidance instead of lust, the mark of which is human prog-
ress and spiritual advancement.
Do  not  loosen  your  hands  from  Islam,  the  preserver  of  our  existence; 
cling onto it with all your strength or you shall be lost!

62. A general disaster results from the error of the majority. Disaster is the 

result of crime and the introduction to reward.

63. A martyr supposes himself to be alive. He did not suffer the pangs of 
death,  so  he  thinks  the  life  he  sacriﬁced  is  perpetual  and  has  not  been 
severed. But he ﬁnds it purer.

64. The pure justice of the Qur’an does not spill the life-blood of an innocent, 
even for the whole of humanity. The two are equal in the view of both 
divine power, and justice. Self-interest, however, makes man such that 
he will destroy anything that impedes his ambition, even the world if he 
can, and mankind.

65. Fear and weakness invite outside inﬂuences.
66. Deﬁnite beneﬁts should not be sacriﬁced for imaginary harms.
67. Istanbul politics at the present time are as sick as Spanish ’ﬂu.
68. Tell a bad man, “ You are good, you are good, ” and it is not unheard of 
that he will become good. And tell a good man “ You are bad, you are 
bad, ” and it is not rare for him to become bad.

69. So long as the enemy of an enemy remains his enemy, he is a friend; and 
so long as the friend of an enemy remains his friend, he is an enemy.
70.  Obduracy  is  this:  if  Satan  assists  someone,  he  calls  him  an  angel  and 
calls down blessings on him. But if among his opponents he encounters 
an angel, he calls him a satan in other clothes and curses him.

71. The remedy for one ill may be poison for another. An excessive dose is 

the cause of ills.

73. If the community is not one and a whole, undivided number, addition 

makes smaller, like multiplying fractions. 1

74.  Non-acceptance  is  confused  with  the  acceptance  of  non-being.  The 
evidence  for  non-acceptance  is  the  absence  of  established  proof.  The 
acceptance of non-being requires proof of non-being. One is doubt while 
the other is denial.

75.  If  doubt  in  the  questions  of  belief  destroys  one,  or  even  a  hundred, 
evidences,  it  does  not  harm  what  is  posited;  for  there  are  hundreds  of 
evidences.

1.  It is well-known that in arithmetic, multiplication and addition increase: four times 
four makes sixteen, while in fractions, on the contrary multiplication and addition make 
smaller: a third multiplied by a third makes a ninth. In just the same way, if there is not 
integral  wholeness,  correctness,  and  unity  among  people,  by  multiplying  they  become 
smaller, spoilt, and valueless.

76. The majority of Muslims should be followed. For when they followed 
the majority the Umayyads, who were slack in religion, ﬁnally entered 
the  Sunni  community. As  for  the  Shi‘a,  who  were  ﬁrm  in  religion  but 
remained in the minority as regards their practices, ﬁnally only a part of 
them followed the Rāﬁḍa.

77. If unanimity concerning good leads to conﬂict concerning what is better, 
then  sometimes  good  is  better  than  the  better;  right  is  truer  than  what 
is truer. Everyone should say about his own way that “ It is right, ” he 
should not say “ it is the only right way. ” Or he should say, “ It is good, ” 
but he should not say “ It is the only good way. ”
78. If Paradise did not exist, Hell would not be torment.
79.  As  time  grows  older,  the  Qur’an  grows  younger;  it  signs  become 
apparent. Just as light sometimes appears to be ﬁre, so sometimes intense 
eloquence appears to be exaggeration.

80. Degrees in heat occur through the intervention of cold; the degrees of 
beauty occur through the intervention of ugliness. Pre-eternal power is 
essential,  necessary,  and  inherent.  Impotence  cannot  penetrate  it;  there 
can be no degrees it in; everything is equal in relation to it.

81. The sun’s image, which is the effulgence of its manifestation, displays 

the same identity on the surface of the sea and in all its droplets.

82. Life is a manifestation of unity; unity is also its consequence.
83. So long as it remains unknown who are the saints among men, which 
moment prayers are accepted on Fridays, which night in Ramadan is the 
Night of Power, and which among the divine names is the greatest name, 
other things retain their value and importance is given to them. Twenty 
years  of  doubtful  life  is  preferable  to  a  thousand  years’  life  the  end  of 
which is speciﬁed.

84. The consequence of sin in this world is evidence for its punishment in 

the next.

85. In the view of power, sustenance is as important as life. Power brings 
into existence, divine determining clothes in form, divine favour nurtures. 
Life is a summary, a speciﬁed product and is apparent. Sustenance is not 
a summary; it is gradual and widespread, and provokes thought. No one 
dies from hunger, for death occurs before the food stored up in the body 
in the form of fat is exhausted. That is to say, illness resulting from the 
giving up of habit kills, not lack of sustenance.

SEEDS OF REALITY

86.  The  licit  sustenance  of  carniverous  wild  animals  are  the  innumerable 
remains of dead animals; they both cleanse the face of the earth, and they 
ﬁnd their food.

87. Before entering the mouth and disappearing down the throat, a mouthful 
worth one  k u r u s h  and one worth ten are the same. There is only a few 
seconds’ difference in the mouth. To raise the price from one to ten in order 
to gratify the sense of taste, which is like an inspector and doorkeeper, is 
most prodigal and wasteful.

88.  When  pleasure  calls,  a  person  should  say:  “ It  is  as  though  I  ate  it. ” 
( S a n k i   y e d i m . ) For a person who took it as his guiding principle, could 
have eaten a mosque called “ S a n k i   Ye d i m , ” but he didn’t. 1

89. Formerly, most Muslims did not go hungry; they desired a comfortable 

life. Now they are hungry, and they have no wish for pleasure.

90. Temporary pains rather than temporary pleasure should be greeted with 
smiles  and  welcomed.  For  past  pleasures  make  one  say:  “ Alas! ”,  and 
“ Alas! ” is an expression of concealed pain. While past pains make one 
say: “ Oh! ”, and “ Oh! ” tells of permanent pleasure and bounty.

91. Forgetfulness is also a bounty; it allows one to suffer the pains of only 

one day and causes the rest to be forgotten.

92.  Every  calamity  holds  a  degree  of  bounty,  like  a  degree  of  heat.  One 
should think of greater calamities and should note the degree of bounty 
in the small one, and thank Allah. For if the calamity is blown up, it will 
grow; and if it is worried over, it will double; the image, the imagining, 
in the heart will be transformed into reality; and they will pound the heart 
as well.

93. In society as a whole, everyone has a window, known as rank, through 
which to see and be seen. If the window is higher than a person’s stature, 
he will grow taller through arrogance, but if it is lower, he will bow down 
out of modesty to see and be seen at that level. The measure of greatness 
in man is smallness, that is, modesty. The scale of smallness is bigness; 
that is, arrogance.

94. The dignity of the weak before the strong becomes arrogance in the strong; 
while  the  modesty  of  the  strong  before  the  weak  becomes  abasement 
in the weak. The seriousness of someone in authority in their ofﬁce is 
dignity, and his humility is abasement. While his seriousness in his house 

1.  That is, the person put aside the money saved through his abstinence, and built the 

mosque with the proceeds. It is in the Fatih district of Istanbul. ( Tr. )

554

BEDIUZZAMAN SAID NURSI – LETTERS

is haughtiness, and his humility, modesty. If an individual is on his own, 
then his tolerance and self-sacriﬁce are good acts. But if he is more than 
one and attached to others, they are treachery and inauspicious. Someone 
should swallow his pride in his own name and not be boastful, but he may 
boast in the name of his nation and should not swallow his pride.

95. To leave it to others in planning the preliminaries of a matter is laziness, 
while in awaiting the outcome it is reliance on Allah. Resignation with 
the fruits of one’s labour and with fate is contentment, and strengthens the 
wish to strive. Whereas making do with what exists is to lack enterprise.
96. Just as there are obedience and rebellion in the face of the commands 
of  the  Shari‘a,  so  there  are  obedience  and  rebellion  in  the  face  of  the 
creative commands in the universe. With regard to the ﬁrst, the reward 
and punishment are mostly in the hereafter, while with the second, they 
are mostly in this world. For example, the reward for patience is victory; 
the punishment for idleness is poverty; the reward for effort is wealth, 
and  the  reward  for  constancy,  triumph.  Justice  without  equality  is  not 
justice.

97. Mutual resemblance is the cause of contradiction; congruity is the basis 
of solidarity; smallness of character is the source of arrogance; weakness 
is the source of pride; impotence is the source of opposition; and curiosity 
is the teacher of knowledge.

98.  Through  need,  and  especially  through  hunger,  the  Creator’s  power 
has reined in foremost man, and all the animals, and put them in order. 
Also, He saved the world from anarchy, and making need the master of 
civilization, ensured progress.

99. Distress teaches vice; despair is the source of misguidance; and darkness 

of heart, the source of spiritual distress.

103.  For  someone  who  has  truly  entered  into  the  bounds  of  Islam  by 
conforming precisely to its incontestable matters, the desire to expand is 
the desire to be perfected. But for someone deemed outside those bounds 
due  to  slackness,  the  desire  to  expand  is  the  desire  to  destroy.  In  time 
of storm and earthquake, it is advisable to not open the door of i j t i h a d , 
and  to  close  the  windows  too. The  overly  free  and  easy  should  not  be 
indulged with dispensations, but determinedly and severely warned.

104. Unfortunate truths become worthless in worthless hands.
105. Our globe resembles a living being; it displays the signs of life. 

Would it not become a sort of animal if it were reduced to the size of an 
egg? Or if a microbe were to be enlarged to the size of the globe, would it 
not resemble it? If it has life, it has a spirit too. If the world were reduced 
to the size of man, and the stars made the particles and substance of his 
being, would it not also be a living conscious being? Allah has many such 
animals.

106. There are two Shari‘as:

The First is the Shari‘a that we know which orders the actions and con-
duct of man, the microcosm, and proceeds from the attribute of speech.
The Second is the Supreme Shari‘a of Creation, which orders the motion 
and rest of the world, the macroanthropos, proceeds from the attribute of 
will, and is sometimes wrongly called nature. The angels are a vast com-
munity; they are the bearers, representatives, and personiﬁcations of the 
creative commands which proceed from the attribute of will and are the 
Shari‘a of Creation.

108. Materialism is a spiritual plague that has infected man with a terrible 
fever, causing him to be visited by divine wrath. The more the ability to 
inculcate and criticize expands, so does that plague spread.

109. The most wretched, distressed, and suffering of men is the man with no 
work, for idleness is the cousin of non-existence. Labour, however, is the 
life of existence and the waking state of life.

110. Proﬁting from banks, the doors of usury and interest, is for the inﬁdels, 
who  are  the  worst  of  men,  and  for  the  most  tyrannous  of  the  former,

and  for  the  most  degenerate  of  the  latter.  Banks  cause  absolute  harm 
to  the  Islamic  world,  so  mankind’s  afﬂuence  should  not  be  taken  into 
consideration. For if the inﬁdels are warmongers and aggressive, so they 
are disrespectful and dishonourable.

111.  The  purpose  of  the  k h u t b a   during  the  Friday  Prayers  is  to  mention 
the  essentials  and  incontestable  matters  of  religion,  not  to  instruct  in 
theoretical matters. The Arabic terms recall the essentials best. 

112. When Hadiths and Qur’anic verses are balanced, it is clear that even the 
most eloquent of men cannot attain to the verses’ eloquence nor resemble 
them.

established meaning]; they are the foundation of the Book; others are allegorical.

Message except men of understanding.
