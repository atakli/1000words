A day will come when this assembly of examination is closed and the period of trial is finished, and the divine names have carried out their decree, and the pen of divine determining has completed writing its missives, and divine power completed the embroideries of its art, and beings have fulfilled their duties, and creatures accomplished their acts of service, and everything has stated its meaning, and this world produced the seedlings of the hereafter, and the earth has displayed and exhibited all the miracles of power of the All-Powerful Maker and all the wonders of His art, and this transient world has attached to the string of time the tableaux forming the panoramas of eternity. For the eternal wisdom and pre-eternal providence of the All-Glorious Maker necessitate such truths as the results of the examination and trial, the truths of those divine names’ manifestations, the truths of the missives of the pen of divine determining, the originals of those sample-like embroi deries of art, the aims and beneﬁts of the duties of beings, the wages of the acts of service of creatures, the truths of the meanings that the book of the universe’s words stated, the sprouting of the seeds of innate disposition, the opening of a supreme court of judgement, the displaying of the sample-like panoramas taken from this world, the rending of the veil of apparent causes, and the surrendering of everything directly to the All-Glorious Creator. Since the All-Glorious Maker’s pre-eternal wisdom and providence neces sitate these truths, they require the puriﬁcation of those opposites in order to deliver the world from the turmoil of change and transience, transformation and extinction, and to separate out the causes of change and the matters of conﬂict. Most certainly they will bring about the resurrection and purify those opposites in order to obtain these results. Thus, as a result of this puriﬁcation Hell will take on its eternal and dread ful form and its inmates will manifest the threat: AYET While Paradise will assume its everlasting and majestic form, and its people and companions will manifest the address of: AYET As is proved in the Second Question of the First Station of the Twenty Eighth Word, through His perfect power, the Pre-Eternally All-Wise One will give the inhabitants of these two houses eternal and permanent bodies which will not be subject to dissolution, change, old age, or decline. For there will be no causes of change, which are the cause of decline.
