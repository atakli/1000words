Yes, O man! In regard to your vegetable physical being and animal soul, you are a miniscule particle, a contemptible atom, a needy creature, a weak animal, who, tossed on the awesome waves of the ﬂood of beings, is depart ing. But being perfected through the light of belief, which comprises the radiance of divine love, and through the training of Islam, which is enlight ened, in regard to humanity and servitude to Allah, you are a king, and a universal within particularity, and within your insigniﬁcance, a world, and within your contemptibility, a supervisor of such high rank and extensive sphere that you can say: “ My Compassionate Sustainer has made the world 372 THE WORDS a house for me, the sun and moon lamps for it, and the spring, a bunch of ﬂowers for me, and summer, a table of bounties, and the animals, He has made my servants, and plants the decorated furnishings of my house. ” T o c o n c l u d e : If you heed Satan and your soul, you will fall to the lowest of the low. But if you heed truth and the Qur’an, you will rise to the highest of the high and become the Most Excellent Pattern of the universe. Fifth Remark FIFTH REMARK Man has been sent to this world as an ofﬁcial and guest, and has been given abilities of great signiﬁcance. And he has been entrusted with impor tant duties in accordance with those abilities. In order to employ man in fulﬁlling those aims and duties, powerful encouragement and severe threats have been made. We shall here summarize the fundamentals of worship and of man’s duties, which we have explained at length elsewhere, so that the mystery of ‘the Most Excellent of Patterns’ may be understood. On coming into the universe man has two aspects related to worship and being a slave of Allah. One is worship and contemplation in the absence of the Object of Worship. The other is worship and supplication in His pres ence and addressing Him directly. First Aspect: It is to afﬁrm submissively the sovereignty of dominicality apparent in the universe and to observe its perfections and virtues in wonder. Then it is to proclaim and herald the unique arts which consist of the inscriptions of the sacred divine names and to display them as an example to others. Then it is to weigh on the scales of perception the jewels of the dominical names, which are all like hidden treasures; it is to appreciatively afﬁrm their value with a discerning heart. Then it is to study and ponder over in wonder the pages of beings and leaves of the earth and sky, which are like missives of the pen of power. Then through beholding admiringly the adornment and subtle arts in beings, it is to feel love for knowledge of their All-Glorious Creator, and to yearn to ascend to the presence of their All-Perfect Maker and to receive His favours.
