Sixth Question: The neglectful and heedless put it about that the earthquake resulted from a fault in the rock strata inside the earth, and they look upon it as quite simply a chance event, natural, and without purpose. They do not see the non-material causes and results that they may come to their senses. Does matter, on which they base their views, have some reality? The Answer: It has no reality other than misguidance for the following reason. Take the fly out of all the species on the earth, which each year is clothed in and changes more than fifty million finely embroidered wellproportioned shirts: the intention, will, purpose, and wisdom manifested on the wing of a single fly, which is only one organ out of hundreds of one individual fly out of the countless numbers of all the flies on the face of the earth, and the fact that it is not neglected or left to its own devices, all show that no aspect of the significant acts and states of the huge globe of the earth, whether particular or universal, can be outside the divine will, choice, and purpose, for it is the cradle, mother, place of recourse, and pro tector of innumerable conscious beings. However, as is required by His wis dom, the Possessor of Absolute Power makes apparent causes a veil to His disposals. When He wills an earthquake, and sometimes He does, He com mands the movement of the strata and ignites them. Even if it results from this movement or a fault in the strata, it is still at the divine command and in accordance with His wisdom; it cannot occur in any other way. For example, one man shot another with a riﬂe. If the man who ﬁred the shot is entirely disregarded and only the gunpowder in the bullet igniting is taken into consideration, the rights of the wretched victim would be com pletely violated, and it would be the epitome of foolishness. In just the same way, the earth is a docile ofﬁcial of the All-Powerful One of Glory, rather, a ship or an aircraft of His. So to forget the dominical command concerning it: “ Explode a bomb inside the earth prepared through wisdom and will in order to arouse the heedless and the rebellious! ” and to deviate into nature, is the very peak of stupidity. A n A d d i t i o n a n d F o o t n o t e t o t h e S i x t h Q u e s t i o n : In order to defend their way and counter the awakening of the believers and hinder them, the people of misguidance and the atheists display an obduracy so strange and a stupidity so peculiar it makes a person regret his humanity. For example, in order to make men give up their wicked and wrongful rebellion which recently has become somewhat general, and to arouse humanity and make it forego this awesome revolt and recognize the universe’s Sovereign, Whom it does not want to recognize, the Crea tor of the heavens and the earth – not on account of a particular title but as Sustainer and Ruler of the whole universe and all the worlds and through a widespread and general manifestation throughout the universe in the universal sphere of His dominicality – has struck humankind in the face with awesome, widespread calamities like earthquakes, storms, and world wars due to the universal elements coming to anger, with water, the air, and electricity, which are matchless and constant. He has demon strated through them in all clarity His wisdom, power, justice, and self subsistence.
