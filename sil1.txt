this wretched, strange Nursi, who although he deserves to be called the Oddity of the Age became known as the Wonder of the Age ( Bediuzzaman ), cries out in extreme pain at the nation’s decline, alas and alack! For abandoning the essence and kernel of Islam, we fixed our gazes on its exterior and shell. And due to misunderstandings and ill manners, we did not afford Islam its right nor pay it the respect it was due. So in disgust it swathed itself in clouds of illusion and delusion, and concealed itself. And it had the right, for we mixed i s r a i l i y y a t 1 with the fundamentals of belief, and stories with the tenets of faith, and metaphors with the truths of belief, and did not appreciate its value. So to punish us in this world, it left us in abasement and penury. And what will save us, is again its mercy. O Muslim brothers! We shall offer it an apology. Together we shall declare our loyalty and pay it allegiance. We shall grasp hold of its strong rope. Also, I declare fearlessly that what has stirred me up and given me the courage to contest the ideas of past centuries, and to defend against the imaginings and misapprehensions that have gained strength through the strategies of hundreds of years, is my certain conviction that truth will sprout and grow, although it is concealed in the earth; and its partisans and supporters will be triumphant, although they may be weak and few in number due to the inclemency of time and place. It is also my belief that it shall be the reality of Islam (   h a k i k a t - ı İ s l a m i y e   )  which will prevail over the future and be absolute ruler in every continent. It is Islam that will conquer them; the signs of this are to be seen. For in the past, eight obstacles prevented the Illustrious Shari‘a vanquishing completely the bigotry and blind imitation of tent-dwellers in their far-ﬂung privation, and the embellished trivia and despotism of house-dwellers in the lands of ignorance. But now they have been routed by three truths, or are being routed. The obstacles obstructing the Europeans were their blind imitation, ignorance, and bigotry, and the authority of their priests; while those obstructing us were various forms of despotism, immorality, our confused circumstances, and despair, which leads to idleness. These obstacles caused the steady eclipsing of the sun of Islam. The eighth, and principal, obstacle and chief calamity is this: together with the Europeans we deludedly imagined ( tevehhüm ) there to be a clash and contradiction between some of the apparent matters of Islam ( zevâhir-i İslamiyet ) and some questions of science. Bravo to the abounding efforts of education and science ( fünun ) ! For they have decked us out with the desire to search for the truth, love of humanity, and the tendency to be fair, and have overturned those obstacles and got rid of them, and are so doing.
